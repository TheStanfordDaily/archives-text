# LECTURE BY EGYPTOLOGIST.
## Dr. Georg Steindorff Speaks in Chapel on Religious Beliefs of Ancient Egyptians. 
### 
I)r. Georg Steindorff, professor of
Egyptology in the University of
Leipsig, delivered an interesting
lecture in the chapel this afternoon
on "The Views of the Ancient
Egyptians on Life after Death."
Dr. Steindorff speaks fluent Eng
lish, and has an attractive person
ality.
He opened his address by saying
that we are not to he surprised to
find the most opposite ideas in the
closest proximity in the religious
beliefs of the Egyptians. This an
cient race was firmly imbued with
the idea that the only way in
which man can rejoice in life is to
believe in a personal survival after
death. He said in part:
"The oldest notion of the Egyp
tians was that the human being!
leads the same life after death as
before. The child is still a child —
there is no change whatever. The
cemetery is only the home of the
body—its tomb. The same joys
that made man's earthly life happy
are still given to him. He must
still breathe, eat, drink, and sleep
as before. The deceased is sup
ported by his relatives, who fur
nish life's necessities through sac
rifice. What is lacking in nature
for the dead man's welfare is se
cured by the incantations of the
priests. The body leaves the grave
by day and roams about. It often
interferes with the living, being
jealous of life and desiring more
companions."
Dr. Steindorff then related char
acteristic incidents that illustrate
the beautiful simplicity of the idea.
He quoted a solig sung by an anx
ious mother as she feels the pres
ence of a dead soul trying to steal
the life of her child. The letter of
an afflicted man to his deceased
wife was read, in which the hus
band pleads that his wife cease tor
menting him.
The Egyptians, like the Greeks,
thought enduring life inseparably
connected with the body. At death
the soul was represented as leaving
the body in the form of a bird with
a human head. They thought that
the soul enjoyed 1 iherty from the
dead body at certain times. In
order to avoid confusion, it was
thought necessary that the soul be
able to distinguish its own corpse,
and for this reason embalming was
extensively practiced by the Egyp
tians.
" We have seen that the dead
man can leave his tomb by day.
He can do more: he can change
himself into other forms, arid may
become a swallow, a crocodile, or
even a flower. The Greek and
Egyptian ideas differ in this re
spect. The Egyptians taught that
the soul could change at will, while
the Greeks taught that the soul
underwent a series of purifying
transmigrations. In both beliefs
the residence of the soul is confined
to the earth.
" It is quite a different concep
tion in which the dead are received
into heaven with the gods. Souls
are represented as birds, even
grasshoppers, living through the
ether. In another conception, a
golden ladder is used as a means of
entering heaven. At the top the
soul entered a long valley traversed
by a river like the Nile, where there
were many hikes and canals in
which a purification process had to
take place."
The speaker then entered into a
description of the Egyptian idea of
heaven. There were two principal
abodes for the dead. In one the
soul was looked upon as a demi
god, in the other the dead occupied
themselves with the favorite Egyp
tian industry, that of agriculture.
Besides these two conceptions
there was still a third and contra
dictory one —that the dead had
an abode in the lower world. By
dny it was a region of desolation and
mourning, but by night, when the
sun had descended below the hori
zon, its splendor filled the dead with
happiness and joy. The under
world was divided into twelve re
gions, each one guarded by gods
and demons.
Dr. Steindorff told at this junc
ture some of the best Egyptian
myths. The Egyptians believed
that it was tlie lot. of each man to
arrive at a life of eternal blessed
ness after passing through life's
hardships, and this belief was illus
trated by the lives of the gods. In
conclusion be gave a brief exposi
tion of the varied attitudes with
which the Egyptians looked upon
death and its approach.

ious mother as she feels the pres
ence of a dead soul trying to steal
the life of her child. The letter of
an afflicted man to his deceased
wife was read, in which the hus
band pleads that his wife cease tor
menting him.
The Egyptians, like the Greeks,
thought enduring life inseparably
connected with the body. At death
the soul was represented as leaving
the body in the form of a bird with
a human head. They thought that
the soul enjoyed 1 iherty from the
dead body at certain times. In
order to avoid confusion, it was
thought necessary that the soul be
able to distinguish its own corpse,
and for this reason embalming was
extensively practiced by the Egyp
tians.
" We have seen that the dead
man can leave his tomb by day.
He can do more: he can change
himself into other forms, arid may
become a swallow, a crocodile, or
even a flower. The Greek and
Egyptian ideas differ in this re
spect. The Egyptians taught that
the soul could change at will, while
the Greeks taught that the soul
underwent a series of purifying
transmigrations. In both beliefs
the residence of the soul is confined
to the earth.
" It is quite a different concep
tion in which the dead are received
into heaven with the gods. Souls
are represented as birds, even
grasshoppers, living through the
ether. In another conception, a
golden ladder is used as a means of
entering heaven. At the top the
soul entered a long valley traversed
by a river like the Nile, where there
were many hikes and canals in
which a purification process had to
take place."
The speaker then entered into a
description of the Egyptian idea of
heaven. There were two principal
abodes for the dead. In one the
soul was looked upon as a demi
god, in the other the dead occupied
themselves with the favorite Egyp
tian industry, that of agriculture.
Besides these two conceptions
there was still a third and contra
dictory one —that the dead had
an abode in the lower world. By
dny it was a region of desolation and
mourning, but by night, when the
sun had descended below the hori
zon, its splendor filled the dead with
happiness and joy. The under
world was divided into twelve re
gions, each one guarded by gods
and demons.
Dr. Steindorff told at this junc
ture some of the best Egyptian
myths. The Egyptians believed
that it was tlie lot. of each man to
arrive at a life of eternal blessed
ness after passing through life's
hardships, and this belief was illus
trated by the lives of the gods. In
conclusion be gave a brief exposi
tion of the varied attitudes with
which the Egyptians looked upon
death and its approach.
