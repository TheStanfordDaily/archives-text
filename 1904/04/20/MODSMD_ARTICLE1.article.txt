# BEST ATHLETES TO COMPETE.
## Many Stanford Men in Olympian Try-outs at Berkeley on Saturday. 
### 
On Saturday afternoon the final
try-outs for the selection of the best
Pacific Coast athletes to be sent to
the Olympian games at the St.
Louis Exposition will be held on
the track of the University of Cali
fornia. The same try-outs will de
cide the Pacific Coast champion
ships, so that the contests promise
to be very interesting. Practically
all the best athletes of the Coast
will be brought together in compe
tition, and if the weather and track
conditions are favorable, some new
Coast records will probably be set
in the different events. There will
be entries from nearly every uni
versity, college, and preparatory
school of athletic prominence on
the Coast.
The delegation from Stanford
University will be a representative
one, although it is not known ex
actly who will take part. No for
mal notice of entry seems to be
necessary, and as a consequence a
number of Stanford men may enter
the contests at the last minute. It
is almost certain that a majority
of the winners in last Saturday's
field day with California will take
part. Dunn, '04, will go up to run
in the 220- and 440-yard dashes.
Dunn has taken part in the first
two preliminaries, and has prac
tically assured his place on the
team. Dunn has no equal on the
Coast in the quarter, and in the
220-yard dash he has run close to
0:22.1. Crossman, '04, will also
probably compete on Saturday.
Crossman is believed to be capable
of far better work than he did in
the last intercollegiate field day,
and ought to run second only to
Dunn. Captain Holman,'o4, will
enter the half mile, and perhaps also
the mile. He won first place
in both events last Saturday, but
will specialize on the half-mile.
Lanagan,'o4, and MacFarland, '07,
may take part in the hurdles.
In the field events Stanford will
he well represented. At the head
of this section will be N. E. Dole,
'04, who is without peer in the
West as a pole-vaulter. Dole's po
sition on the team is assured, but
his work on Saturday will be inter
esting because of the possibility of
his breaking the world's record of
11 feet 10 inches. Last Saturday
he did 11 feet 8| inches without
any great effort. J. M. Peach, '04,
will also take part in the contest,
and should get second place. In
the broad jump Hell, '05, and West,
'06, will take part. These two hold
the Stanford record of 22 feet 2$
inches. Bell will also take part in
the high jump. O. E. Hyde, '04,
who last Saturday broke the Amer
ican intercollegiate record by put
ting the 16-pound shot 45 feet
inches, will be a competitor in the
meet, and Crawford, '05, will throw
the hammer. Although Crawford
threw only 133 feet 5J inches in the
intercollegiate meet, he has done as
much as 149 feet in practice.
