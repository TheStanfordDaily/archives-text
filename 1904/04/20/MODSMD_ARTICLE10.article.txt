# PREPARATIONS FOR DEBATE.
## Twelfth Intercollegiate Contest Will Be Held in Alhambra Theatre Saturday Night. 
### 
The debating team that will
represent Stanford in the twelfth
intercollegiate contest has practi
cally completed its work of prepa
ration. The question has been by
no means an easy one to handle.
Its length and the numerous pro
visions attached to it have been
difficult to interpret and formulate
into a basis for logical argument.
However, the three speakers have
now finished with a proportion
ate division of the question, and the
preparation of the combined line of
argument.
While Stanford will be repre
sented by a veteran team, there is
no reason to predict a Cardinal
victory. The California team has
the two men who have carried off
the Carnot medal during the past
two years. Their third speaker is
new on the intercollegiate platform,
but the excellence and experience
of his colleagues are sufficient to
give California a debating strength
greater than she has had in a team
for several years.
Arrangements for holding the
debate have been completed in
detail. The Alhambra Theatre, at
the corner of Jones and Eddy
streets, San Francisco, has been
engaged. The time of the contest
has been set for 8, which will allow
Stanford constituents enough time
to return from the intercollegiate
baseball game to be played at Oak
land in the afternoon. No admis
sion will be charged, but it will be
allowed only on presentation of
tickets, which may be obtained by
Stanford people from O.C.Spencer,
'04, at the University Library from
3:30 to 6:30 daily. It will not be
necessary for those in the cheer
section to provide themselves with
tickets. They will be admitted to
the right balcony, which has been
reserved for the Stanford contin
gency. On the lower floor a block
of seats has been reserved for Stan
ford representatives who do not
wish to occupy the cheer section.
For them seat tickets are necessary
and can be had free of charge as
directed above.
