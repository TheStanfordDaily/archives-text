The showing the Stanford men
make in the Olympian try-outs at
Berkeley next Saturday will he of
considerable importance to the
University, aside from the import
ance it will have for the
individual competitors. Adver
tisement of a university through
the medium of its athletic
prominence is hut a poor way in
which to attract a desirable class
of students to an institution, and
it is with no desire to advertise our
college that we are anxious to see
Stanford represented by a strong
collection of athletes at the Olym
pian games at St. Louis next sum
mers. If these men make a good
showing there in the events in
which they are entered it will be to
the credit of Stanford athletics, and
so, indirectly, to the credit of the
University. There is at least one
man on the Stanford track team
who has a good chance of being
victorious in open competition in
his event against any athlete in the
world, and there are two others
who will he in the front rank in
the fiercest kind of competition.
There is but little question that these
men will represent us at the World's
Fair, and that they will be suc
cessful in the events in which they
are entered can hardly be doubted.
As a collection of the representative
athletes of the Pacific Coast, next
Saturday's meet will be unique, and
Stanford is fortunate in that her
colors will be worn by those who
stand in the front rank of the first
place men.
