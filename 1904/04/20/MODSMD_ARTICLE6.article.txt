# Varsity Will Practice at Oakland.
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that it was
found necessary to call off the game
which was scheduled to be played
between the Varsity and St. Mary's
College of Oakland at Idora Park
this afternoon, the baseball man
agement has decided to take the
Varsity to Oakland tomorrow after
noon for practice. As the field at
idora Park is different in construc
tion from the campus diamond, the
trip to Oakland has been planned
in order that the men may accus
tom themselves themselves to the
diamond on which the third inter
collegiate match will be played.
