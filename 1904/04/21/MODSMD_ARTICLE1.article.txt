# VARSITY CREW WILL ROW.
## Stanford Will Be Represented in Three-Cornered Regatta With California and Washington. 
### 
At an important meeting of the
Athletic Committee last night
action was taken which gives to
the Stanford Boat Club the right
to enter a crew in the intercolle
giate boat race between California
and Washington. If the club de
cides to enter a crew in this con
test — a step it will probably take —
the men will row as representatives
of Stanford UniVe'rsity, and not as
merely representatives of a Stan
ford boating association. Although
this action makes rowing strictly
an intercollegiate event this year,
the committee so protected its
action that next year it may re
frain from sanctioning the entry
of a crew as representative of Stan
ford.
There is but little question but
that a crew will be entered in the
race. There are a number of men
who are creditable oarsmen as indi
viduals, although it is questionable
whether they have had the exper
ience and training that will enable
then) to play an important figure
in the deciding of the race when in
competition with tried oarsmen.
The most likely candidates for the
crew are A. B. Cheadle, '06, W. H.
Dole, '05, J. M. Beach, '04, \V. J.
Morin, '05, Bv Bryan, '06, and M.
M. Stearns, '06. The race will be
rowed in a four-oared barge over a
mile and a half course on the
Oakland estuary, Fridav April
29th.
