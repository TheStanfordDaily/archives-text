### 
The Sierra Club of San Francisco |
offers an exceptional opportunity to
those students who wish to visit the
Yosemite Valley and neighboring
regions of the high Sierras this
summer. The association includes
many notable men of science. Dr.
Jordan is president of the commit
tee on publication, and Professor
W. R. Dudley is the corresponding
secretary of the club.
The membership of the party
which will make the outing this
summer has been limited to 150,
preference being given to members
of the club. Those Stanford people
who desire to take the trip, or join
the association, should communi
cate with Professor Dudley, from
whom details of the excursion may
be secured.
The party will leave San Fran
cisco about, thft last, of .Tnne. and

will go directly to the Yosemite.
The dedication of the Le Conte
Memorial Lodge will take place on
the 3d of July. This lodge was
built in the valley by the Sierra
Club, in memory of Joseph Le
Conte, late professor in the Univer
sity of California. The money was
contributed by popular subscrip
tion. An article in the Sierra
Club Bulletin for January describes
the completed lodge.
After the dedication the party
will go to the Tuolumne Meadows,
where a stop of two weeks will be
made. The rest of the month will
be spent in minor stops, and the
return to San Francisco will be
made on July 29th. The expenses
of the outing will vary between
thirty and fifty dollars.
