# STANFORD WOMEN DEFEATED.
## California Girls Prove Too Strong for Cardinal Players and Win Hard-Fought Victory. 
### 
The second annual intercolle
giate tennis tournament between
the women of the University of
California and Stanford was played
on the California courts in San
Francisco yesterday. The Stan
ford players, although stronger
than was expected, were unable to
hold their own against their oppo
nente, but, though weak at the net,
in the back court they played a
strong, clever game.
The doubles proved to be the most
interesting and the most spectacu
lar match. The best playing was
done by Miss Marion Edwards,
who was largely responsible for the
California victory. She was ably
assisted in her superior play by
Miss Wickson, whose net work was
especially good.
In the first set the Stanford
players won after a strong game by
the score of 6-4. The second set
was won easily by California, 6-3.
In the third set came the surprise
of the match. The players from
both colleges rallied and the score
varied until 5-5 was reached. In
the eleventh game Miss Ray and
Miss Pitman led 40-0, but lost
finally and the deciding game was
won easily by California.
In the first match of the singles
Miss Ratcliffe won from Miss Ray,
although the latter played a deter
mined game. The score was 6-2,
6-2. The second singles match
was more closely contested. Miss
Owen, '07, made a splendid show
ing against her stronger California
antagonist. Miss Edwards, the
state champion, proved too strong,
however, and Miss Owen lost by
the scores of 7-5, 6-2.
