# BELL ELECTED TRACK CAPTAIN
## High-Jumper Unanimously Chosen to Lead the Varsity Track Team During Next Season. 
### 
Harry Wesley Bell, '05, was
today elected captain of the Var
sity track team for the season of
1905. Hell was regarded as the
logical candidate for the position,
and he was elected by the unani
mous vote of the men who were en
tered in the recent tield-day against
California.
The newly elected captain has
earned his reward by the three
years of hard work and consistent
training that have made him one
of the most successful of Stanford's
track athletes. His level head and
athletic ability thoroughly qualify
him for the position of captain.
In his freshman year Bell became
a wearer of the Varsity " S " by win
ning third place in the high jump
of the 1902 intercollegiate meet.
The following year he tied for sec
ond place in the same event, and
this year tied for first place in the
high jump and won second place in
the broad jump. Bell's record has
been one of constant improvement.
His track work has been steady,
and he can always be relied upon
to do as well or better in competi
tion than in practice. Bell is reg
istered in the Department of Min
ing Engineering, from Healdsburg.
He is a member of Encina Club.
