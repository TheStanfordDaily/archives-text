# STANFORD ATHLETES MAY GO EAST.
## Plan to Send a Picked Team of Five or Six Men to the National Intercollegiate Contest on Soldiers' Field. 
### 
There seems at the present time
to be a strong probability that a
small team of Stanford's best ath
letes will be sent East to represent
the University at the national am
ateur intercollegiate championship
contests, hitherto held lit Mott
Haven, but which this year will
probably be held at the end of May
on Soldiers' Field, Philadelphia,
the grounds of the University of
Pennsylvania. If the response of
the general student body, the
alumni, and others interested in
the success of the college to the cali
for funds proves generous, there is
little doubt but that a picked few
will wear the Stanford colors in
competition with the greatest ath
letes of the American universities
and colleges.
The project took form at the
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students last
night. Treasurer Cowden reported
that he had received a letter from
J. F. English, '01, president of the
Stanford Club of San Francisco,
offering on behalf of alumni to
raise half of the money necessary
to send Norman Dole, the pole
vaulter, and O. E. Hyde, the shot
putter, to the great intercollegiate
meet, the remainder of the neces
sary amount to be made up by the
student body. The alumni of San
Francisco are enthusiastic over the
recent performances of Dole and
Hyde, and regard both of them as
capable of taking first places in the
eastern meet. It was roughly esti
mated by Treasurer Cowden that
the expense of sending Dole and
Hyde would be in the neighbor
hood of $350.
Treasurer Cowden stated that
business men of Palo Alto had sug
gested to him their willingness to
raise a fund to send East a team of
Stanford men if they would in
some way represent Palo Alto.
This led to a general discussion of
the possibility of the student body
itself sending such a team to repre
sent the University, and the gen
eral idea was that such a course
would be entirely practicable and
very desirable. It was roughly fig
ured that the cost of sending five
or six men would be between $1000
and $1200, and it is believed that
this amount can he raised in vari
ous ways. It is thought that an
appeal to the general body of un
dergraduates will meet with ready
response, and it is expected that
the alumni not only of San Fran
cisco but those scattered over the
State, will help liberally such a
project. It is hoped, too, that
many of the business men of Palo
Alto, to whom the success of all
that concerns the University means
much, will be inclined to lend
assistance. Treasurer Cowden may
also arrange a big baseball game
or some other event to swell the
fund. Cowden will communicate
with President English of the
Stanford Club of San Francisco at
once, to see what encourage

ment that organization may hold
out.
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee last night a committee ■
of investigation was appointed,
consisting of Treasurer Cow-1
den, F. O. Ellenwood, '04, |
0. S. Lousley, '05, and W. H. B.|
Fowler, '06. This committee will
inquire fully into the proposition,
which will be definitely acted upon
at the meeting of the Executive
Con) mil tee next Wednesday. In
order to raise as large an amount'
as possible among the students and
others connected with theUniver-j
sity, it is probable that President j
Roehr of the Associated Students
will appoint a number of represen- j
tative men and women to make
collections. Owing to the limited
time before the end of the semester,
it is necessary to press the matter
as rapidly as possible.
Several years ago the University
of California eent a team of her
best athletes to Mott Haven. Some
of these men were very fine per
formers, and the team left behind
it a very creditable record, not only
in the Mott Ha*.en contests, hut in
meets with the big colleges of the
East. The team that Stanford
could send this year would not be
such a well balanced aggregation,
but it would be a squad certain of
making an excellent showing. In
Dole and Hyde, if they perform up
to their records, Stanford has two
men who will be hard to beat. In
practice Dole has gone over 12 feet
in the pole-vault, better by
inches than the world's record,
held by Clapp of Yale. It seems
to be only a matter of time before
he will set a new mark in open
competition. At any rate he ought
to be good for one first place for
Stanford in the national champion
ship contests.
Hyde's work in the shot-put last
Saturday indicated that great
things might be expected of him.
A third man for the team would be
W. F. Dunn, '04, the best 440 man
on the Coast,whose best show in the
East, however, would probably be
in the 220 yard dash, in which he
is good for something close to 22
seconds fiat. Holman's work in
the half-mile at Berkeley next Sat
urday will be interesting, because
it will show of what he is capable
in that event. In the past inter
collegiate contests he has always
run the half-mile after having
done the mile previously. Bell has
a record in the broad jump of 22
feet 22 inches, which might have a
chance for a place in the East this
year. A sixth man might be Craw
ford, who as a hammer-thrower
has few superiors today when lie
throws to form.

could send this year would not be
such a well balanced aggregation,
but it would be a squad certain of
making an excellent showing. In
Dole and Hyde, if they perform up
to their records, Stanford has two
men who will be hard to beat. In
practice Dole has gone over 12 feet
in the pole-vault, better by
inches than the world's record,
held by Clapp of Yale. It seems
to be only a matter of time before
he will set a new mark in open
competition. At any rate he ought
to be good for one first place for
Stanford in the national champion
ship contests.
Hyde's work in the shot-put last
Saturday indicated that great
things might be expected of him.
A third man for the team would be
W. F. Dunn, '04, the best 440 man
on the Coast,whose best show in the
East, however, would probably be
in the 220 yard dash, in which he
is good for something close to 22
seconds fiat. Holman's work in
the half-mile at Berkeley next Sat
urday will be interesting, because
it will show of what he is capable
in that event. In the past inter
collegiate contests he has always
run the half-mile after having
done the mile previously. Bell has
a record in the broad jump of 22
feet 22 inches, which might have a
chance for a place in the East this
year. A sixth man might be Craw
ford, who as a hammer-thrower
has few superiors today when lie
throws to form.
There seems at the present time
to be a strong probability that a
small team of Stanford's best ath
letes will be sent East to represent
the University at the national am
ateur intercollegiate championship
contests, hitherto held lit Mott
Haven, but which this year will
probably be held at the end of May
on Soldiers' Field, Philadelphia,
the grounds of the University of
Pennsylvania. If the response of
the general student body, the
alumni, and others interested in
the success of the college to the cali
for funds proves generous, there is
little doubt but that a picked few
will wear the Stanford colors in
competition with the greatest ath
letes of the American universities
and colleges.
The project took form at the
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students last
night. Treasurer Cowden reported
that he had received a letter from
J. F. English, '01, president of the
Stanford Club of San Francisco,
offering on behalf of alumni to
raise half of the money necessary
to send Norman Dole, the pole
vaulter, and O. E. Hyde, the shot
putter, to the great intercollegiate
meet, the remainder of the neces
sary amount to be made up by the
student body. The alumni of San
Francisco are enthusiastic over the
recent performances of Dole and
Hyde, and regard both of them as
capable of taking first places in the
eastern meet. It was roughly esti
mated by Treasurer Cowden that
the expense of sending Dole and
Hyde would be in the neighbor
hood of $350.
Treasurer Cowden stated that
business men of Palo Alto had sug
gested to him their willingness to
raise a fund to send East a team of
Stanford men if they would in
some way represent Palo Alto.
This led to a general discussion of
the possibility of the student body
itself sending such a team to repre
sent the University, and the gen
eral idea was that such a course
would be entirely practicable and
very desirable. It was roughly fig
ured that the cost of sending five
or six men would be between $1000
and $1200, and it is believed that
this amount can he raised in vari
ous ways. It is thought that an
appeal to the general body of un
dergraduates will meet with ready
response, and it is expected that
the alumni not only of San Fran
cisco but those scattered over the
State, will help liberally such a
project. It is hoped, too, that
many of the business men of Palo
Alto, to whom the success of all
that concerns the University means
much, will be inclined to lend
assistance. Treasurer Cowden may
also arrange a big baseball game
or some other event to swell the
fund. Cowden will communicate
with President English of the
Stanford Club of San Francisco at
once, to see what encourage

ment that organization may hold
out.
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee last night a committee ■
of investigation was appointed,
consisting of Treasurer Cow-1
den, F. O. Ellenwood, '04, |
0. S. Lousley, '05, and W. H. B.|
Fowler, '06. This committee will
inquire fully into the proposition,
which will be definitely acted upon
at the meeting of the Executive
Con) mil tee next Wednesday. In
order to raise as large an amount'
as possible among the students and
others connected with theUniver-j
sity, it is probable that President j
Roehr of the Associated Students
will appoint a number of represen- j
tative men and women to make
collections. Owing to the limited
time before the end of the semester,
it is necessary to press the matter
as rapidly as possible.
Several years ago the University
of California eent a team of her
best athletes to Mott Haven. Some
of these men were very fine per
formers, and the team left behind
it a very creditable record, not only
in the Mott Ha*.en contests, hut in
meets with the big colleges of the
East. The team that Stanford
