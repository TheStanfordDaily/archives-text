Although a number of the men
who have been largely instrumen
tal in winning two successive track
victories for Stanford will leave
college this year, we may be able
to develop another winning team
by an exercise of the same spirit
that gave birth to the first. We
are fortunate because Trainer Moul
ton will be back —and that he will
have an able second in Captain
elect Bell there can be little doubt
when it is remembered that he was
so eminently the man for the place
that he was elected by the unani
mous vote of the squad. We should
begin working for a track victory
at once, and we will find two able
men ready to direct our efforts
along intelligent lines.
