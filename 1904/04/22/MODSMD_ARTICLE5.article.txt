# INTERCOLLEGIATE BASEBALL AND DEBATE.
## Stanford and California Will Play Third Game on Diamond at Oakland in Afternoon.— Debate in Evening at Alhambra Theatre. 
### 
Stanford will play the baseball
team of the University of Califor
nia at Idora Park tomorrow, in ihe
third and final game of the inter
collegiate series. California won
the iirst game, which was played
three weeks ago on the campus at
Berkeley by the score of G to 2,
while Stanford wan victorious a
week later on her own diamond by
the same score. The final game,
according to the intercollegiate
agreement, will be played on neu
tral ground.
The prospect of a Cardinal vic
tory in tomorrow's game is very
bright. The team has played good
ball at times throughout the season,
and during the last two weeks the
work has been of a very high order.
Since the last intercollegiate match
the Varsity has not lost a game,
but has defeated such teams as St.
Mary's, Mayer Bros., and the sol
diers from the Presidio. The re
sults of these games have given rise
to the hope and expectancy of a
victory tomorrow.
When the Varsity met the team
from St. Mary's College it was for
the third time this season, Stanford
having been defeated in the two
previous games. The second vic
tory over the Mayer Bros', team
was of a poor order, the Varsity
winning by a large score. One en
couraging feature of this game was
the ease with which the Stanford
batters hit a left-handed pitcher.
The game with the Presidio on last
Saturday was the best seen on the
campus during the season. The
Varsity won a clean victory by
timely hitting and good fielding
over this team hitherto practically
undefeated.
The personnel of the Stanford
nine in the next game will be the
same as in the second contest with
California. Sales will again oc
cupy the box and is expected to
keep the hits of the Californians
scattered. The entire infield may
be relied upon to give Sales good
support, Swain at third base having
especially shown marked improve
ment during the last two weeks.
In the outfield Chalmers, Wirt, and
Knight will again form the trio.
Knight, whose phenomenal batting
won the last game, has been hitting
the ball hard during the practice
matches.
Stanford will not have the ad
vantage of playing on her home
grounds tomorrow, as she did in
the last game. California will not
be handicapped so heavily as Stan
ford in this respect, as the Blue
and Gold players have practiced
on the new grounds, which the
Cardinal team has been unable to
do. The pitcher's box at Idora Park
is raised above the ground. This
may bother Sales to some extent,
but the game on the campus yes
terday was played with a raised
box, in order to accustom the
pitcher to this peculiarity. A
point in favor of the Varsity is
that it has had the benefit of two

weeks' coaching under Lanagar),
and is now batting better than at
any time during the reason. On
tbe other hand, California aleo has
had time to improve, and will be
ready to play hard ball without
the over confidence that handi
capped her in the second game.
California will probably play
the same men as she did in the
two former games, although there
is talk of a new pitcher being tried.
Strub,.who played third base dur
ing the first two games, has been
tried in the box during practice
games; West, a left-handed man, is
another possibility for this posi
tion. It seems likely, however,
that Heitmuller will pitch again
for California.
The game will begin at 2:30. It
is probable that George Green, who
officiated in the last contest, will
again act as umpire.

Intercollegiate Debate.
Tomorrow night Stanford and
the University of California will
meet in an annual Intercollegiate
debate for the twelfth time. Of the
eleven previous debates Stanford
has won five and California six.
The question for discussion in
tomorrow night's debate is as fol
lows: " liesolved, That in cities of
the United States of over forty
thousand inhabitants a system |of
municipal government, concentrat
ing executive and administrative
powers in the mayor, should be
adopted. Note—The mayor to have
[tower to appoint and remove heads
of departments and chief city olli
cers, except the treasurer and
controller; all subordinates to be
appointed by heads of departments
under civil service rules. The
power of the mayor in conjunction
with the heads of departments to
include the purchase of materials
and supplies, the construction and
control of public works, the grant
ing of licenses and franchises sub
ject to confirmation of the council,
and the making of estimates for the
following fiscal year, said estimates
not to be increased by the council."
The question is one that has
long been before the public, and is
of particular interest us a phase of
municipal government. Its great
length makes it difficult to handle
in a debate, and its provisos give
too much chance for the sides tak
ing interpretations that will not
meet. Stanford will uphold the
affirmative, while the representa
tives of California will maintain
the negative of the question.
In this contest Stanford is being

championed by F. Roehr, '04, H.
M. Lewis, '04, and A. Sherriffs, '05.

The California team is composed
of Max Thelan, '04, J. P. Lucey,

McWilliams, '04. The first two
men of the trio have been Carnot
medal winners, and are expected to
make an excellent showing. Their
associate is a new man on the in
tercollegiate platform.
F. Roehr, who will represent
Stanford in an intercollegiate con
test for the fourth time tomorrow
night, was a member of the victo
rious team of last year, and has
twice been on the Carnot team.
He is registered in the Department
of Law, and is a member of Kappa
Sigma and Phi Delta Phi fraterni
ties.
H. M. Lewis is another debater
who will make his fourth intercol
legiate speech tomorrow night.

any time during the reason. On
tbe other hand, California aleo has
had time to improve, and will be
ready to play hard ball without
the over confidence that handi
capped her in the second game.
California will probably play
the same men as she did in the
two former games, although there
is talk of a new pitcher being tried.
Strub,.who played third base dur
ing the first two games, has been
tried in the box during practice
games; West, a left-handed man, is
another possibility for this posi
tion. It seems likely, however,
that Heitmuller will pitch again
for California.
The game will begin at 2:30. It
is probable that George Green, who
officiated in the last contest, will
again act as umpire.

Intercollegiate Debate.
Tomorrow night Stanford and
the University of California will
meet in an annual Intercollegiate
debate for the twelfth time. Of the
eleven previous debates Stanford
has won five and California six.
The question for discussion in
tomorrow night's debate is as fol
lows: " liesolved, That in cities of
the United States of over forty
thousand inhabitants a system |of
municipal government, concentrat
ing executive and administrative
powers in the mayor, should be
adopted. Note—The mayor to have
[tower to appoint and remove heads
of departments and chief city olli
cers, except the treasurer and
controller; all subordinates to be
appointed by heads of departments
under civil service rules. The
power of the mayor in conjunction
with the heads of departments to
include the purchase of materials
and supplies, the construction and
control of public works, the grant
ing of licenses and franchises sub
ject to confirmation of the council,
and the making of estimates for the
following fiscal year, said estimates
not to be increased by the council."
The question is one that has
long been before the public, and is
of particular interest us a phase of
municipal government. Its great
length makes it difficult to handle
in a debate, and its provisos give
too much chance for the sides tak
ing interpretations that will not
meet. Stanford will uphold the
affirmative, while the representa
tives of California will maintain
the negative of the question.
In this contest Stanford is being

championed by F. Roehr, '04, H.
M. Lewis, '04, and A. Sherriffs, '05.
All three have represented Stanford
in previous debates, and as a team
they form one of the strongest that
has ever defended the Cardinal.
The California team is composed
of Max Thelan, '04, J. P. Lucey,
Hastings College of Law, and R.
McWilliams, '04. The first two
men of the trio have been Carnot
medal winners, and are expected to
make an excellent showing. Their
associate is a new man on the in
tercollegiate platform.
F. Roehr, who will represent
Stanford in an intercollegiate con
test for the fourth time tomorrow
night, was a member of the victo
rious team of last year, and has
twice been on the Carnot team.
He is registered in the Department
of Law, and is a member of Kappa
Sigma and Phi Delta Phi fraterni
ties.
H. M. Lewis is another debater
who will make his fourth intercol
legiate speech tomorrow night.
Last year he made both the Carnot
and Intercollegiate teams, and was
successful in being listed on both
again this year. He is a member
of Delta Upsilon fraternity and of
Euphronia Debating Society.
Alexander Sherriffs is the young
est man on the team. Last, year
he debated with Stanford's second
team against the University of
Washington. This year he made
a place on the Carnot team. He
is a member of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity.
The judges who will pass upon
the merits of the debate are United
States Circuit Judge W. W. Mor
row; State Supreme Court Justice
Lucien Shaw; and J. A. Cooper,
commissioner of the State Supreme
Court.
The debate will be held in the
Alhambra Theatre at eight.
Stanford will play the baseball
team of the University of Califor
nia at Idora Park tomorrow, in ihe
third and final game of the inter
collegiate series. California won
the iirst game, which was played
three weeks ago on the campus at
Berkeley by the score of G to 2,
while Stanford wan victorious a
week later on her own diamond by
the same score. The final game,
according to the intercollegiate
agreement, will be played on neu
tral ground.
The prospect of a Cardinal vic
tory in tomorrow's game is very
bright. The team has played good
ball at times throughout the season,
and during the last two weeks the
work has been of a very high order.
Since the last intercollegiate match
the Varsity has not lost a game,
but has defeated such teams as St.
Mary's, Mayer Bros., and the sol
diers from the Presidio. The re
sults of these games have given rise
to the hope and expectancy of a
victory tomorrow.
When the Varsity met the team
from St. Mary's College it was for
the third time this season, Stanford
having been defeated in the two
previous games. The second vic
tory over the Mayer Bros', team
was of a poor order, the Varsity
winning by a large score. One en
couraging feature of this game was
the ease with which the Stanford
batters hit a left-handed pitcher.
The game with the Presidio on last
Saturday was the best seen on the
campus during the season. The
Varsity won a clean victory by
timely hitting and good fielding
over this team hitherto practically
undefeated.
The personnel of the Stanford
nine in the next game will be the
same as in the second contest with
California. Sales will again oc
cupy the box and is expected to
keep the hits of the Californians
scattered. The entire infield may
be relied upon to give Sales good
support, Swain at third base having
especially shown marked improve
ment during the last two weeks.
In the outfield Chalmers, Wirt, and
Knight will again form the trio.
Knight, whose phenomenal batting
won the last game, has been hitting
the ball hard during the practice
matches.
Stanford will not have the ad
vantage of playing on her home
grounds tomorrow, as she did in
the last game. California will not
be handicapped so heavily as Stan
ford in this respect, as the Blue
and Gold players have practiced
on the new grounds, which the
Cardinal team has been unable to
do. The pitcher's box at Idora Park
is raised above the ground. This
may bother Sales to some extent,
but the game on the campus yes
terday was played with a raised
box, in order to accustom the
pitcher to this peculiarity. A
point in favor of the Varsity is
that it has had the benefit of two

weeks' coaching under Lanagar),
and is now batting better than at
any time during the reason. On
tbe other hand, California aleo has
had time to improve, and will be
ready to play hard ball without
the over confidence that handi
