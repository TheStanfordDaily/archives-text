Tomorrow Stanford will meet
California in two intercollegiate
contests. The Blue and Gold will
be represented by one of the strong
est debate teams that she has
ever had. California's baseball
team has defeated our own by ex
actly the same score with which we
turned the tables on the players
from the State University. Both
contests will be close, but that
Stanford will win no one of us
doubts after the fine showing made
by the track men last Saturday.
Besides the work of the contestants,
there is a chance for the student
body to help things along. Every
one who can should be at Oakland
in the afternoon to cheer the men
under Captain Ball, and should
return to San Francisco at night to
support the three debaters, who
have worked faithfully for the
honor of their college.
