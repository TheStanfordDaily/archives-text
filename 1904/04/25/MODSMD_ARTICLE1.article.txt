# STANFORD WINS DEBATE.
## Cardinal Trio Defeats Strongest Team That Has Ever Represented University of California. 
### 
The Stanford debaters won the
annual Intercollegiate debate Sa
turday night for the second consecu
tive time. Pitted against the
strongest debating trio that the
State University has put forth in
many years, the representatives of
the Cardinal rose to the occasion
and made their victory so well de
fined that even before the an
nouncement of the decision there
was no doubt as to the outcome of
the contest. Stanford won by pre
senting in excellent form a line of
argument , the logic and gradual
development of which was as nearly
perfect as brains, time, and pains
taking work could make it. The
case was so well arranged that it
was impregnable to the attacks of
California's brilliant speakers, and
the weight of merit was so far on the
Stanford side that the judges spent
but a fraction of a minute in unan
imously declaring the verdict for
the affirmative.
California had three very good
reasons on the strength of which she
expected to win the debate. Her
team contained two Carnot medal
winners, her men had prepared
under the system of coaching em
ployed at Harvard, and her team
believed that they had on their
side of the question, the truer and
deeper arguments to deal with, in
the face of these odds the three
Stanford speakers won, and for that
reason more than average credit is
due them. For their laudable ef
forts there are some minor things
gained beyond the joy of victory.
The debaters themselves will re
ceive as a result of the decision, the
cash prize of $100, offered to the
winning team by Mr. George C.
Ross, an attorney of Redwood City.
Stanford will receive custody of the
Hearst debating trophy for the en
suing year, and a second claim
toward the first three out of five
victories necessary to permanent
possession of the cup.
By eight o'clock an immense au
dience had filled the Alhambra
Theatre. California was represent
ed by the stronger body of rooters,
but Stanford had a sufficient quota
to make the cheering interesting.
President David Starr Jordan pre
sided, and after a few introductory
remarks announced the question
for discussion as follows: " lie
solved, That in cities of the United
States of over forty thousand in
habitants a system of municipal
government, concentrating execu
tive and administrative powers in
the mayor, should be adopted."
Frank Roehr of Stanford opened
the case for the affirmative. He
maintained that lack of concentra
tion in city governments has led
to certain evils, viz., irresponsibil-,
ity and inefficiency. He ad
vocated concentration of adminis
trative functions in the mayor and
showed why such functions prop
erly belong to that official. He
further showed that the tennency
of all cities has been and is in that

direction, and that such a system !
as advocated by the affirmative
has received the sanction of the j
highest authorities 011 municipal j
government.
R. McWilliams was the first |
speaker for California. He opened I

the negative side of the question by
contending that the system advocat
ed bythe affirmative goes too far,and
tends to make out of a mayor a
dictator whose concentrated power
would not be used to the best ad
vantage for the community which
placed him in power. The speaker
took up separately each one of the
provisos to the question, and at
tempted to show how they would
operate to make true his opening
contentions.
Alexander Sherriffs continued the
cause for Stanford and very in
geniously turned the humor of the
preceding speaker back upon him.
Sherriffs went on to prove that the
principle advocated by the affirma
tive gave a more efficient adminis
tration, and lessened chances for
political corruption in municipal
government. He also took up the
provisions of the note appended to
the question, and showed that
while they did not give the mayor
dictatorial power, they did give a
business-like administration to city
government.
Joseph P. Lucey spoke next on
the negative. He offered the objec
tion that the system advocated was
not a remedy for existing evils be
cause it did not locate responsibil
ity. He developed this idea and
