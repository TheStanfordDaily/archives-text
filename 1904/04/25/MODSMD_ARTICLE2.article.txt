# LOSE THIRD GAME.
## State University Wins Baseball Series in Close and Interesting Contest.—Score Was 4 to 2. 
### 
California defeated Stanford on
Saturday by the score of 4 to 2,
j thereby winning the intercollegiate
baseball championship for 1904.
| The game was played on the Idora
! Park diamond and was even closer
i than the score shows, as Stanford
was one run in the lead up to the
fatal eighth inning. In this inning,
after two men were out, Sales weak
ened, and after the next two men
had succeeded in getting on base,
Heitmuller knocked out a long

three-base hit scoring both men
and winning the game.
The personnel of the California
team was changed from that of the
two previous games. Strub, the
former third baseman, took Heit
muller's place in the box, the big
pitcher displacing Hamilton in left
field. Gunn took Strub's place at
third and played the position with
out an error.
Fine fielding by both teams
made the game a pitchers' battle
between Sales and Strub. The
Stanford man was pitching the
better ball up to the eighth inning,
but then California's best bat
ters bunched three hits which re
sulted in the winning runs. Strub's
worst inning came in the seventh
but he managed to get himself out
of a bad place with the addition of
but one run to the Stanford score.
For California Heitmuller was

the particular star. doing similar
work to that of Knight in the sec
ond contest of the series. Heit
muller knocked out a three-base
hit and a two bagger which
brought in three of California's
runs, and he scored the fourth him
self on Graham's hit in the eighth.
Strub tilled the pitcher's position
with credit and held the Stanford
team down to five hits.
Sales and Wirt played good ball
for Stanford. The Stanford pitcher
allowed but one more hit than
Strub and brought in the first run
for the Cardinal. Wirt in center
field cut off some hard drives that
looked like hits.
The score:

but then California's best bat
ters bunched three hits which re
sulted in the winning runs. Strub's
worst inning came in the seventh
but he managed to get himself out
of a bad place with the addition of
but one run to the Stanford score.
For California Heitmuller was

the particular star. doing similar
work to that of Knight in the sec
ond contest of the series. Heit
muller knocked out a three-base
hit and a two bagger which
brought in three of California's
runs, and he scored the fourth him
self on Graham's hit in the eighth.
Strub tilled the pitcher's position
with credit and held the Stanford
team down to five hits.
Sales and Wirt played good ball
for Stanford. The Stanford pitcher
allowed but one more hit than
Strub and brought in the first run
for the Cardinal. Wirt in center
field cut off some hard drives that
looked like hits.
The score:

California defeated Stanford on
Saturday by the score of 4 to 2,
j thereby winning the intercollegiate
baseball championship for 1904.
| The game was played on the Idora
! Park diamond and was even closer
i than the score shows, as Stanford
was one run in the lead up to the
fatal eighth inning. In this inning,
after two men were out, Sales weak
ened, and after the next two men
had succeeded in getting on base,
Heitmuller knocked out a long

three-base hit scoring both men
and winning the game.
The personnel of the California
team was changed from that of the
two previous games. Strub, the
former third baseman, took Heit
muller's place in the box, the big
pitcher displacing Hamilton in left
field. Gunn took Strub's place at
third and played the position with
out an error.
Fine fielding by both teams
made the game a pitchers' battle
between Sales and Strub. The
Stanford man was pitching the
better ball up to the eighth inning,
but then California's best bat
ters bunched three hits which re
sulted in the winning runs. Strub's
worst inning came in the seventh
but he managed to get himself out
of a bad place with the addition of
but one run to the Stanford score.
