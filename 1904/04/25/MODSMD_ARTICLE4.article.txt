That the result of the intercolle
giate baseball series has filled us
with the deepest disappointment it
would be idle to deny. And this
feeling is deeper because it is tinged
with not the slightest abatement of
confidence in Captain Ball and his
team. Every one of us who saw
the game feels sure that another
contest would bring a victory to the
Cardinal, â€”but the season is over;
we have lost, and there is nothing
to do but to wait for another sea
son in which we may hope to wipe
out a long list of California victo
ries on the diamond. The team
has worked well this year, and its
advancement has been apparent to
the most casual observer. Next
year's captain has but to continue
the work where it stopped this sea
son in order to bring the champion
ship of 1905 to Stanford.
