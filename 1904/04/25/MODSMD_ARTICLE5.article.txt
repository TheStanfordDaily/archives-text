The elation with which our rivals
were filled in the afternoon was
decidedly dampened when they
learned that Stanford had defeated
the strongest debating team that
has represented California for

the Stanford team that by working

a trio which included two Carnot
medal winners. This kind of spirit
is that which counts —earnest,
faithful, unassuming work.
