While Stanford as a college lost
in the athletic contest Saturday
afternoon, one who bears a name
that will ever awaken a thrill of
pride in Stanford men succeeded in
breaking the world's record in the
pole-vault. He did no more than
we all expected him to do, but by
his performance he has brought not
only much honor to himself but a
great deal to the college for which
he has already done so much. It
is for us to congratulate both him
and ourselves on his remarkable
and successful effort to win a
world's championship.
