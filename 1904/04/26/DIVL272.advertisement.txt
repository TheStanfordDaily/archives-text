Spirit of
Helpfulness
In cases of accident everybody manifests
a desire to be of assistance. At such times
the spirit of helpfulness asserts itself, but so
often t lie wrong thing is done and the right
thing left undone. The first thing to do in
such fin event is to quickly and freely apply
Pond's Extract—Vie old family doctor—a
recognized emergency remedy, for over 60
years used by nurses, physicians and hos
pitals. Every student should have a bottle
close at hand. Quickly stops bleeding in
deep cuts; cures bruises, sprains, and pre
vents muscles becoming sore from gym-
Snasium exercises; re
lieves earache, toothache,
rheumatism and all pains.
Soothes and freshens the
faceafter shaving. Watered
Witch Hazel, a weak solu
tion—sometimes .ottered in
place of Pond's Extract
has no medicinal value—is
positively worthless. Pond's
Extract OUUES—therefore
Sold only in ten led bottlet
under buff'wrapper.
