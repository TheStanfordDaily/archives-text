Tiik annual student body elec
tion,which will be held on the quad
tomorrow, promises, through lack
of competition, to come far from
arousing the usual keen interest
Because of this two things should
be borne well in mind: First, there
should be no relaxation in what is
rapidly becoming a principle in
Stanford elections â€”the determina
tion that there shall be no pledging
of votes; and second, every member
of the student body should take
enough interest in the identity of
those who will direct student body
affairs next year to register himself
for some particular candidate. The
election is little more than a farce
if it does not excite the active inter
est of a large proportion of the
students.
