substantiated it by specific cases.
Howard M. Lewis closed the pos
itive argument for the affirmative.
He showed that the system advo
cated had proved successful in
those cities where it had been tried.
He explained in detail the working
of the system in New York City,
Cleveland, Indianapolis, Philadel
phia, and Brooklyn. He then con
tended that the tendency in these
instances had not been to make a
perfect government, but to better
existing conditions.
The negative argument was fin
ished by Max Thelen of California.
His arguments were designed to
show that the system advocated by
the affirmative would introduce
new evils, among which were the
furthering of political patronage
and the up-building of political
machines. A great part of Thelen's
time was devoted to an ineffectual
attempt to rebut the argument of
the affirmative.
The rebuttal speech for the
affirmative was given by Frank
Roehr, who forcibly summed up
and substantiated the three ele
ments in the affirmative's positive
argument. He also answered the
objection which the negative speak
ers had brought against the case
of the affirmative.
The judges who had been sitting
apart during the debate rendered
a decision for the affirmative a few
seconds after they were brought
together. Those who passed upon
the merits of the contest were
United States Circuit Judge W. W.
Morrow, State Supreme Court Jus
tice Lucien Shaw, and J. A. Cooper,
Commissioner of the State Supreme
Court.
