The Pacific coast championship
and Olympian games try-out field
day at the University of California
Saturday afternoon proted to be
the most remarkable athletic meet
ever held in this state. One
world's record and three Pacific
coast records were broken, and
there were many sensations and
surprises. The most important
event of the day, and the one that
means the most to Stanford Uni
versity, was the breaking of the
world's pole-vaulting record by
Norman Dole, '04. He set a mew

mark at 12 feet 1 32-100 indhes,
better'by inches than the record
by C&app of Yale, 11 feet Ho|
inches, which has stood since 1898.
Dole cleared the bar with a margin
of nearly four inches, and after the
height had been carefully meas
ured so that affidavits might be
prepared, the cross-pieee was raised
to 12 feet 4 inches. Dole made
several 'tries at this distance, but
the time taken up in the formalities
of measuring his first jump had let
him get cold, and he could not get
over at the greater height. Several
timee he got>his body over, but
always disturbed the bar so that it
toppled to the ground. On-ce his
pole broke and he received a heavy
fall Pluckilv he took another
pole without a moment's delavand
started down the take-off for an
other try. His whole performance
aroused the wildest enthusiasm
among the crowd of nearly 3000
people who witnessed the perform
ance.
IMaw of California broke his own
Coast record of H>B feet 10 inches
in the hammer-throw by sending
the ball 170 feet 5 3-10 inches.
The 100-yard dash proved a very
sensational race, and added new
laurels to the versatile athelete,
Snedigar. It was a clean-cut vic
tory for Snedigar over the finest
sprinters on the Coast. Abadie
and Cadogan, California's crack
men, were outrun, and Cope of
Lick could do no better than
fourth.
Miller of the Bakerevillw high
school proved to b« the strongest
man in the mile run, winning it

The Pacific coast championship

day at the University of California
Saturday afternoon proted to be
the most remarkable athletic meet
ever held in this state. One
world's record and three Pacific
coast records were broken, and
there were many sensations and
surprises. The most important
event of the day, and the one that
means the most to Stanford Uni
versity, was the breaking of the
world's pole-vaulting record by
Norman Dole, '04. He set a mew

mark at 12 feet 1 32-100 indhes,
better'by inches than the record
by C&app of Yale, 11 feet Ho|
inches, which has stood since 1898.
Dole cleared the bar with a margin
of nearly four inches, and after the
height had been carefully meas
ured so that affidavits might be
prepared, the cross-pieee was raised
to 12 feet 4 inches. Dole made
several 'tries at this distance, but
the time taken up in the formalities
of measuring his first jump had let
him get cold, and he could not get
over at the greater height. Several
timee he got>his body over, but
always disturbed the bar so that it
toppled to the ground. On-ce his
pole broke and he received a heavy
fall Pluckilv he took another
pole without a moment's delavand
started down the take-off for an
other try. His whole performance
aroused the wildest enthusiasm
among the crowd of nearly 3000
people who witnessed the perform
ance.
IMaw of California broke his own
Coast record of H>B feet 10 inches
in the hammer-throw by sending
the ball 170 feet 5 3-10 inches.
The 100-yard dash proved a very
sensational race, and added new
laurels to the versatile athelete,
Snedigar. It was a clean-cut vic
tory for Snedigar over the finest
sprinters on the Coast. Abadie
and Cadogan, California's crack
men, were outrun, and Cope of
Lick could do no better than
fourth.
