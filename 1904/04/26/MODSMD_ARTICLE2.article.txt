# College Editors' Convention.
## 
### 
A great deal of attention will be
devoted to the undergraduate ac
tivities of American colleges at the
St. Louis Exposition this summer,
and among other things a conven
tion of college editors will be held
during the latter part of June.
College journalism is climbing into
an important position; and Ameri
can colleges are sending their grad
uates yearly to great cosmopolitan
newspapers. Hut with its growth
the duties and responsibilities of
t.he college editor are increasing.
It is with this fact in view that
an attempt is being made to inter
est all of the college editors in the
convention to be held at St. Louis.
Whatever the success of the con
vention may be, it will be instru
mental in bringing together a large
number of students who represent
varied interests and all of the
phases of college journalism.
