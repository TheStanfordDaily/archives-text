# Work on Tennis Court.
## 
### 
Work has been resumed on the
two dirt tennis courts which were
started some time ago. Although
work was delayed during a long
period, owing to rainy weather, the
contractors expect to have both
courts ready for use within two
weeks. About all that remains to
be done is to oil the courts, and af
ter this process several weeks of
clear weather must follow in order
that they may dry out properly.
The contractors have requested that
no playing be done on the asphalt
court which lies between the dirt
courts as any disturbance of the sur
face of the new courts at the present
time would necessitate them being
rolled again.
