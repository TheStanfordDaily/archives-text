Rev. J. K. McLean, president of
the Pacific Theological Seminary,
preached in Memorial Church Sun
day morning. His text was Psalm
lxxiii, 16-17: ''When I thought to
know this it was too painful for
me, until 1 went into the sanctuary
ofGod; then understood I their end."
Dr. McLean spoke of this psalm
as the story of a great soul-battle,
related after the battle has been
fought and the victory won. The
great stumbling-block is here de
picted. This problem has been the
most perplexing of the ages: Is
there real knowledge of the Most
High? and why the visible pros
perity of the unworthy, contrasted
with the frequent poverty of more
deserving souls? The psalmist
looked beyond the visible, and saw
that apparent prosperity is not real
prosperity. The disposition of us all
is to ponder, to wonder, to philoso
phize, but the more we speculate
the farther from a solution do we get.
The sanctuary light is the only
true light for these dark problems.
The term is often misapplied; the
sanctuary of God is not confined to
a place of public worship. It is the
place where a desiring soul comes
into contact with the divine Crea
tor. â€” wherever a human soul comes
into touch with the Divine soul.
The movement to sanctity is a
movement upward, from which we
gain a clearer conception of things.
The perplexities of many problems
are made clear by their being
viewed from the proper standpoint.
Most of the trouble lies in the fact
that we make ourselves the center
of the universe. Resort to the
sanctuary of God, if rightly at
tained, will bring us into under
standing with the Architect of the
universe, and give us the proper
comprehension of our share of the
great plan.
