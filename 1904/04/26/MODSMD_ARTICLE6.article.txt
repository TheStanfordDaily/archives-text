# ENTRY OF STANFORD MEN.
## Communication Has Been Started with James E. Sullivan, Secretary of A.A.U. 
### 
Every effort is being put forth to
ensure the sending of a representa
tive team of Stanford athletes to
the Mott Haven games. The games
will be held on Franklin Field,
Philadelphia, May 25th. The near
ness of the date and the short time
before college closes necessitated
quick action if Stanford is to be
represented.
Bast night Treasurer Cowden
wired to James E. Sullivan, secre
tary-treasurer of the Amateur Ath
letic Union, and head of the phys
ical culture department of the St.
Louis Exposition, to find out if
there would be any protest against
Stanford's track men being entered
in the Mott Haven games. A reply,
has not yet been received, but there
will doubtless be no trouble in
effecting the entries.
The main question confronting
those interested in putting Stan
ford into the eastern competition is
in regard to finances. It will take
about $200 per man to send the
athletes East, and at present the
best means of raising money seems
to be by subscription. It is be
lieved that a considerable amount
can be raised among Palo Alto and
San Jose business men by this
means. Upon the donations of
undergraduates and alumni the
chief dependence must be placed,
however. In all probability sub
scription lists will be started as
soon as the subcommittee of the
Executive Committee has reported
upon the feasibility of the plan.
