called the old college doctor. For over
60 years Pond's Extract has been doing
a work of mercy—curing cuts, bruises,
burns; relieving aches and pains;
easing suffering, and making life
brighter. If, is just as efficient, to-day.
A bottle should always be kept conve
nient. Soothes and freshens the face
after shaving. Don'texperiment, with
so-called remediessaidto
be "just as good as Pond's

value—is positively
worthless. Pond's Ex
tract CURES—therefore
is priceless.
