# New System of Track Judging.
## 
### 
In connection with the proposed
trip of the Stanford athletes to the
intercollegiate games to be held on
Franklin Field, Philadelphia, May
27th and 28th, it is interesting to
note the system of judging that
will be adopted there.
There will be a raised platform
for the exclusive use of the judges
of the game. Thus they will be
prevented from collecting around
the finish, as they have done in the
past. They will be stationed about
twenty-five feet from the finish line
on an elevated stand.
This is the method used in Eng
land, and was chosen for the com
ing meet on account of the diffi
culty over the work of the judges
last year at New York.
This new plan was given its first
trial at the Pennsylvania relay
games on April 23d.
Another innovation for judging
the finishes will he the use of a
white line on the ground. The
tape at the breast will be used as
before, but not for the final deci
sion of the judges. Although these
innovations will appear novel to
the Stanford athletes they will be
more of a help than a handicap, as
they will tend directly to leave the
contestant less hampered, and they
will ensure a more accurate deci
sion by the judges.
