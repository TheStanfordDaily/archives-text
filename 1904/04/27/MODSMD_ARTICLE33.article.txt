# Plain Sweaters for Oarsmen.
## 
### 
The Executive Committee last
night authorized Treasurer Cowden
to provide the Varsity and Fresh
man boat crews with plain red
jerseys. The crews which will row
against the universities of Califor
nia and Washington in Saturday's
regatta have been allowed to enter
as University crews, because they
would not be eligible otherwise, but
the event was not recognized by
the Athletic Committee as an inter
collegiate sport, even for the pres
ent year. The work of the men on
Saturday, however, will undoubt
edly go a long way toward fixing
the future status of the sport at
Stanford.
