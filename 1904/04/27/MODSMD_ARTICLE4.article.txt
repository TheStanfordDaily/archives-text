# FIRE SYSTEM IS PERFECTED.
## Truck-House Being Erected on Salvatierra Street.—Hook and Ladder Truck Will be Installed. 
### 
Workmen are engaged on the
foundations of the new building
which is to serve as a fire-station
and truck-house for the newly pur
chased fire apparatus. The build
ing, which is situated on Salvatier
ra street, will he of frame, 45 feet
by 25 feet, two stories in height.
It was designed by Architect Hod
ges.
On the ground floor is the space
for accommodating the hook and
ladder truck. This floor will be of
cement throughout. In the rear
will be two stairways leading to
the sleeping quarters above, there
being also firemen's chutes in each
of the two back corners. On
the second floor, in front, is a large
room, 24 by 30 feet, accommodating
eight beds, for students, who will
have charge of the building and
apparatus. Back of this will be a
living-room, by 12 feet, a bath
room, and the stairways and chutes
to the floor below. Adjacent to the
fire-truck house will be erected a
frame, 56 feet in height, which will
be used for the drying of hose.
The new hook and ladder truck,
which arrived Friday, has been set
up and is now in working order.
It was made by the Revere Rubber
Co., of San Francisco, and is com
pletely equipped, carrying, besides
five ladders (including one of
thirty feet extension), pikes,
hooks, fire-axes, rubber buckets, a
long chain and grappling hook,
and two large bicarbonate fire-ex
tinguishers. The frame and wheels
of the truck are enameled in bright
cardinal and the metal parts are
nickel-plated.
The hose-carts, of which there are
twelve —five on the campus, five at
the Stock Farm, and two at the
Stanford residence—are being re
colored to correspond to the hook
and ladder truck. There are over
forty hydrants placed at conveni
ent spots on the campus, with a
gravity pressure of ninety-five
pounds, which is sufficiently strong
to cope successfully with any fire
which is likely to occur.
In keeping with this general pro
gram,the gymnasium management
last semester inaugurated a system
of fire drills, and there were posted
placards) giving the loca
tions indicated by the fire-whistles
at the power-house. As the Uni
versity buildings are practically
fire-proof these precautions apply
more to the residence section of the
campus than to the University
proper.
