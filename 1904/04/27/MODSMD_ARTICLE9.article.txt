# NEW ORGANIZATION ADOPTED.
## Changes in Manner of Conducting University Made by the Trustees. 
### 
At its meeting on March 31st the
Board of Trustees of Stanford Uni
versity adopted a detailed form of
organization for the internal man
agement of the University so far as
this relates to the faculty. These
articles of organization define at
length the duties of the President,
Registrar, and Librarian of the
University. They provide for a
Vice-President or Acting President
to he appointed hy the Hoard of
Trustees in case of absence of
the President or his inability to
perform the functions of the presi
dential office.
The President is defined as the
executive officer of the University,
with responsibility for the disci
pline of the institution. He is ex
officio chairman of the Academic
Council, of the Executive Commit
tee, and of the faculty or faculties
of any schools which may be or
ganized in connection with the
University. He is the medium of
communication between the teach
ing force and the Board of Trus
tees on the one hand, and between
the students and the Trustees on
the other. He designates the execu
tive heads of the department facul
ties and appoints the administra
tive committees of the faculty.
The Registrar is responsible for
the records of the students, and is
the official medium of communica
tion between the students and the
academic committees of the faculty.
He is editor of the official publica
tions of the University and secre
tary of the Academic Council.
The Librarian is a member of the
University Council and has the
custody of the books of the Univer
sity and department libraries.
Provision is made under the
new plan of organization for the
Academic Council as the governing
body of the University faculty. In
it are vested the powers and duties
usually pertaining to faculties of
similar institutions. It has power
to discuss and decide upon matters
of internal policy and administra
tion. It recommends candidates
for graduation. It instructs the
standing committees of the faculty
as to general policy or regulations.
All general University regulations,
statutes, and rules relating to mat
ters within the province of the fac
ulty are to be initiated in and
passed by the Council, subject to
the powers and duties vesting in
the Trustees. The Trustees and
President may suggest to the Coun
cil, in general terms, legislation
which may seem desirable. All
committees and department facul
ties may be instructed in their
duties and may be called upon to
report their action to the Coun
cil.
The Academic Council, as out
lined in the new plan of organiza
tion, is essentially the same as the
present University Council, itß
duties being amplified and more
clearly defined,and its membership
increased by the addition of such
assistant professors us have been in
the service of the University for
three years.
New in the plan of faculty organ
ization is the Advisory Board, con
sisting of nine members of the rank
of professor, elected in part from
certain department groups and in
part from the faculty at large. The
system of department groups is as
follows:
1. English, Germanic Languages,
Latin, Greek, Romanic Languages.
2. Zoology, Physiology, Hygiene,
Entomology, Botany, Geology.
3. Mathematics, Physics, Chem
istry, Psychology.
4. Law, History, Economics, Ed
ucation.
5. Engineering, Applied Mathe
matics, Drawing.
The members of the Advisory
Board are elected by the Council
by sealed ballot, without nomina
tion,on the first Wednesday in May
of each year. The term of office is
for three years, one-third of the
members going out of office each
year. The President may call

upon this board for advice upon
any matter which he may wish to
refer to it. All executive acts of
general importance —such as recom
mendations for appointments, pro
motions, or dismissals —are to he
submitted by the President to the
Advisory Board for approval before
they become operative or before
they are submitted to the Trustees
for action, when such action is nec
essary. The Advisory Board is
privileged to make such recommen
dations to the President regarding
policy as it may decide by vote to
be expedient, but shall not make
such recommendations in the case
of appointments, promotions, or
dismissals. It may, by a two thirds
vote, appeal differences between
itself and the President to the
Board of Trustees. The Advisory
Board has the power to convene
the Academic Council, and may in
turn be convened at any time by
the President of the Univer
sity.
The routine work of the faculty
is to be carried on through stand
ing committees, fourteen in num
ber, divided into two groups, ac
cording to the nature of their func
tions. Under the head of Admin
istrative Committees are those on
Student Affairs, Athletics, Public
Exercises, Contests, Public Health,
and Scholarship. The standing
committees which have to do with
academic matters are the Executive
Committee of the Council, and the
committees cn Admission, Regis
tration, Graduation, Examinations,
Graduate Study, Library, and Pub
lications. The administrative com
mittees are appointed by the Presi
dent Of the academic committees,
the Executive Committee is elected

by the Academic Council. It con
sists oi thirteen members, the
President, Vice-President and Reg
istrar being ex-oflicio members, and
the remaining ten members being
chosen, two from each department
group,for a term of two years. This
Executive Committee appoints the
other academic committees and de
fines their duties, subject to the
approval of the Council.
The conduct of department
affairs is regulated by a system of
department faculties. The in
jstructing body in each department
is made responsible for the work
of instruction and for the internal
administration of the department,
subject to general control of the
Board of Trustees, President, or
Academic Council. Matters are to
\ be decided by conference or by vote
of the department faculty, those
members only voting who are also
members of the Academic Council.
An executive head of each depart
ment is designated by the Presi
dent, and he is the executive officer
of the department, acting as its
representative in its official rela
; tions with the President, the Coun
cil, and other departments. In
case of differences within the de
partment faculties, appeals in ad
ministrative matters are to be taken
to tho Advisory Board, and in aca
demic matters to the Executive
Committee of the Council. After
consideration by these bodies ap
peals go to the President for final
decision.
The articles of organization are
I i
| subject to amendment or repeal by
the Board of Trustees, and are sub
ject to the powers and duties vested
in the Board and President under
the University trusts.
