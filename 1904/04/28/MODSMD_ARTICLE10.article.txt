# Women's "Chaparral" Will Be Out.
## 
### 
The women's edition of the Chap
arral will he placed on sale on the
quad tomorrow morning. The edi
tion is larger than the ordinary
one —and in many ways better.
There are at least two articles in
the issue that are as clever as those
current when the inimitable
founder of the magazine established
a reputation for his paper that re
cent issues have hard work to live
up to.
" As It Was in the Beginning,"
is the title of a prose sketch by
"A. W. K." that has touched on
the hidden secrets of college life
and laid them bare, mercilessly,
unflinchingly, yet in a manner that
is neither bitter nor objectionable.
It is not ordinary Chaparral
"copy," but it is good reading and
it points a moral as forcefully,
although not so pointedly, as
though it had been given a place in
the •' Now That " column. "Dra
matis Personae," unsigned, is that
rara avis, a clever pun on names.
In heroic couplets the Senior opera
committee is held up to good
natured criticism, and its action in
choosing an opera instead of a
farce made the theme of a decidedly
wittv sketch.
"Chappita" avowedly lays away
"Chappie's" hammer in the first
editorial, and the tone throughout
is commendatory rather than fault
finding. A " Now That " devoted
to a discussion of segregation as a
possible innovation at Stanford
presents the proposition in what is
at least an unusual light. The art
work is meagre and not particu
larly good.
The following names are at the
head of the editorial column: Alice
W. Kimball, editor-in-chief; board
of co-editors; Edith Mirrielees, Ma
rie Burnham, Gertrude Morrison,
Ethel Traphagen, Gertrude Feath
erstone, Anne Scott, Hazel Patter
son, Jeannette Hayward, Stella
Wynne; business manager, Alice
Richards.
