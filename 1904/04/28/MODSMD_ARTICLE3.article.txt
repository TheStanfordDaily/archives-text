The matter of sending a number
of athletes to the big intercollegiate
field-day on Franklin Field, Phila
delphia, came up again at the
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee last night. It was deemed in
advisable to take any definite
action until word is received from
James E. Sullivan, secretary of the
American Athletic Union, to whom
Treasurer Cowden telegraphed a
few days ago in reference to the
conditions of entrance and the eli
gibility of athletes representing
Stanford University. Cowden said
that he would look into the matter
further and report at as early a
date as possible.
The committee expressed itself
as strongly in favor of sending five
men to the eastern meet. The dif
ferent members of the committee
who had discussed the matter with
many students reported a unani
mous sentiment in favor of the
plan, and a general expression of
willingness to contribute liberally

to the fund. Palo Alto business
men have offered to subscribe for
the purpose, and it is believed
money can be secured in San Jose.
J. F. English. '01, president of the
Stanford Club of San Francisco,
has offered to stand by any action
that may be decided upon by the
Executive Committee, and to secure
subscriptions from San Francisco
alumni. Treasurer Cowden said
he believed the organized student
body could afford to give $200 to
the project.
As soon as the question of eligi
bility has been settled, a special
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee will be held and definite action
taken.
