# Guild Fee Fixed for Year.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents last night the recommenda
tion of the hoard of directors of
the Students' Guild that the Guild
fee for next year he fixed at $2 each
semester was accepted. Under the
recently adopted amendment to
the Guild constitution, the final
approval of the fee rests with the
Executive Committee, after free
discussion between the two bodies.
Representing the Guild last night
were President .J. P. Mitchell,
Treasurer Barrett, Dr. Snow, Dr.
Gilbert, and E. K. Putnam, direc
tors. There was considerable dis
cussion of the advisability of plac
ing the fee at $2, but the represen
tatives of the Guild stated that that
amount alone would provide suffi
cient revenue for the proper con
duct of theStudents'Guild Hospital.
They stated that the management
had been badly handicapped dur
ing the past year by lack of money,
it having been necessary for two
members of the board 10 borrow
funds upon their own responsibil
ity. It was deemed inadvisable to
increase the fee for hospital services
to $1.50 a day, it being thought
that this would work a hardship
upon poorer students who might be
taken ill. The only way of raising
funds which the Guild thought
would be satisfactory was the $2
assessment. This figure was there
fore approved by the Executive
Committee.
