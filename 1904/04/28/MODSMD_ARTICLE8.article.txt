# ENGLISH CLUB MEETS.
## Dr. Jordan and C.K. Field, '95, Address the Members at Last Meeting of Semester. 
### 
The last regular meeting of the
English Club was held last night
at the Alpha Phi house. Dr. Jor
dan and C. K. Field, '95, were the
guests of honor and entertained the
club with informal talks on certain
phases of the early history of the
University.
Dr. Jordan spoke of the dark
days of the University, when its
very existence hung in the balance,
which needed scarcely the weight
of a hair to turn the scale one way
or the other. These were the days
and months immediately following
Senator Stanford's death, the days
of the lawsuit, the settling of which
decided forever the financial status
of the University.
Field spoke of the early dormi
tory life here â€”of Encinafrom first
hand experience, of Roble from the
Encina point of view. He told of
his arrival at Encina as a fresh
man; of the dining arrangement,
when Roble came over to Encina
en masse and were gallantly grant
ed the first table by polite but hun
gry men, who managed, however,
to get their share.
Both of these subjects will be
written and published as chapters
of the book which the English Club
is planning to issue in the early
fall.
Miss Carolyn Smith, '06, gave
two piano solos, which were much
enjoyed.
