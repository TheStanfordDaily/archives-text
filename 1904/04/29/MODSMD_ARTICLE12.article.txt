Stanford will compete against
other colleges on the water for the
first time in her history tomorrow
afternoon. While our oarsmen
have been handicapped by lack of
facilities for practice, both in re
gird to equipment and a suitable
sheet of water on which to row,
nevertheless we expect them to
make a creditable showing against
their more experienced rivals. The
college has taken little interest in
boating and has done little to sup
port the crews. Tomorrow we
emerge from the peace of our own
campus into open competition with
rival institutions. Stanford men
must rally behind the crews tomor
row as they would behind a foot
ball or baseball team. The future
status of boating at Stanford will,
in no small measure, be determined
by the outcome of tomorrow's con
test; but whatever the result, we
must remember that our oarsmen
represent Stanford, and so are en
titled to our enthusiastic support.
The sport should be given a fair
trial, something it has never had
here in the past.
