# Decides in Favor of Class Secretaries.
## 
### 
At the Senior class meeting held
this afternoon it was decided by a
unanimous vote to have a perma
nent class secretary. This impor
tant step established at Stanford
a custom which has been in effect
successfully in the large eastern
universities for some years. Miss
Alice Kimball, '04, was elected
permanent secretary and $150 was
appropriated for her use in carry
ing on business of the oflice.
The proposal to have the men
wear caps and gowns at the Com
mencement exercises was voted
upon and rejected by a fair major
ity.
The class voted the sum of $(J7.30
to pay the Quad deficit, which was
reported at the last meeting.
