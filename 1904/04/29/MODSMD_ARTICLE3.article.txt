# Combined Concert at Berkeley.
## 
### 
In return for the combined con
cert in Assembly Hall in which
the University of California (Jlee
and Mandolin Clubs took part on
the evening of the field-dav, the
Stanford (ilee and Mandolin Clubs
will journey to Berkeley tomorrow
and will participate in a similar
concert in Harmon gymnasium at
8. The combined concert held
here proved a success from a finan
cial as well as a musical stand
point. and there is every reason to
believe that this success will lie
repeated at Berkeley tomorrow
night.
Pratically same program
will lie rendered as at the last con
cert. It is expected that the re
turns from this concert and from
the one given at San Jose Friday
night will pratically clear the
deficit which the clubs incurred on
their northern trip during the hol
idays.
