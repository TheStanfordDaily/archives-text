between the freshman crews of Cal

finished their hard practice yester
day. Today the men will practice
starting, and this will end .their
work. The men are all in fine
condition, especially the freshmen.
This crew is composed of men who
are experienced o a ram el), and its
supporters have every reason to
expect, them to win. The Varsity
crew has only engaged in regular
practice for about three weeks, but
the men are strong and are in *good
condition,so that they should make
a good showing.
Ample preparations have been
made to handle the large numbers
of spectators who will witness the
races. Many fast launches and
tugs have been rented by the
boating clubs,and they will be able
to keep up with the races from
start to finish. Some of the boats
will convey people from San Fran
cisco to the races; the other "boats
will leave Oakland from the
Columbia boat-house. The boat
for invited guests will leave the
Columbia boat-house at 1:45. Boats
for Stanford students and rooters
will leave Peterson's boat-house at
the foot of Folsom street, San Fran
cisco, at 1. In order to connect
with the launch Stanford neople
can take Third street car at South
ern Pacific depot and transfer to
Folsom street. Those wishing to
connect with boats from Berkeley,
take Telegraph avenue car and
transfer at Oakland to Lake Mer
riit branch and then get oft' at
Clinton station.

men tomorrow.
