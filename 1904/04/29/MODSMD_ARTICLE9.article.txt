# THE
						JUNIOR ANNUAL.
## 1905 "Quad" Filled with Work of Stanford Artists.—Athletics Well Handled. 
### 
The chief features of the 1905
Quad are the art work and the
athletic department. The cover
design is a narrow panel reproduc
tion of the University seal by R.
W. Borough, '04. There are a ser
ies of sketches by Shimada which
represent three different phases of
Japanese art —landscape, birds and
flowers, and human figures. These
drawings are unusually fine, aside
from their novelty.
The title-page is the work of Miss
Jeanette Hay ward,'os. H.R.John
son, '04, has drawn a fine design
for the page entitled "In Memor
iam." B. C. Bubb, '04, has done
good drawing, both in illustrating
Miss Henry's story and in the title
page for " Publications." All the
drawings in the athletic section are
the work of Bristow Adams and up
to his usual high standard. The
class drawings and "Junior Day"
page are the work of R. S. Sterrett,
'08.
The class headings sketch in
humorous detail the University ex
periences and feeling of the under
graduate from his first entrance
through the sphinx-guarded gates
until the close of his four years of
college life. The drawing for the
title-page of the music section is the
work of R. \V. Borough, '04, and
the title-page for " Organizations"
is by Miss C. INI. Lathrop, '0(5. R.
K. Culver, '99, has done the art
work for the joke department,
which is much more limited this
year than formerly.
One of the best, features of
the book is a fine statement of
what constitutes the Stanford spirit,
by C. K. Field,'9s. Two of the
leading articles are "Biding Our
Time" by David Starr Jordan, and
"In the Senior Year" by C. M.
Marrack,'ol. The title-page for the
literary department is the work of
Miss T. H. Holly,'o3. " Ryerson's
Annie" by Miss G. M. Henry,
ex-'O5, is the prize story. The class
history is written in a humorous
way by Miss M. S. Burnham, '04.
E. (i. Teal haR drawn the title
page for the fraternity section.
There will be no fraternity photo
graphs in the 1905 but,
instead, each fraternity will have
a page insert of its seal.

review of the year's athletics. The
athletic department contains a
great many photographs, especially
snap-shots of the football games,
Besides the usual photographs of
Varsity football men, there will be
individual half-tones of the point

field meet. Professor C. A. Duni

ing, and " Dramatics " are reviewed
