# MRS. STANFORD'S RETURN.
## Expected Home Tomorrow After a Year's Tour of the World. 
### 
The steamship China, upon
which Mrs. Stanford is a passenger,
was due to arrive in San Francisco
today. If no delay was met with
in the voyage from the Orient, it is
very probable that Mrs. Stanford
will arrive on the campus tomorrow
afternoon. She will probably not
stay at her San Francisco residence
for more than one day. In case the
steamer does not arrive until to
morrow Mrs. Stanford will not b
at the University until the follow
ing day. Her return is rather
unexpected at this time, as she
intended when she left last July to
remain abroad two years. From
San Francisco Mrs. Stanford went
direct to Australia, where she re
mained for several weeks. Since
then she has visited New Zealand,
India and Egypt, returning by way
of Hong Kong. During her ab
sence many rare collections of
curios that she has procured have
arrived at the Museum.
A demonstration by the student
body is being planned for Mrs.
Stanford's arrival on the campus.
It will take place on the night of
her return, and will not differ
greatly from similiar occasions in
the past. The procession of root
ers, headed by the University
Band, will assemble at the main
arch, and march to the residence,
where Mrs. Stanford will be greeted
by the customary speech of the
student body president and the
cheers of the rooters.
