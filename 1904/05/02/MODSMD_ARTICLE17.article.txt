Both of the crews which repre
sented Stanford in the first inter
collegiate boat-race in her history
were defeated. Both crews did well
in the face of discouraging odds, a
poor boat and unfamiliar surround
ings. We have lost nothing, nor
have we suffered any disgrace bv
this defeat, but it places us face to
face with a problem. Shall Stan
ford continue to encourage rowing,
shall the Athletic Committee sanc
tion it as an intercollegiate sport
and make for an annual event
what, during a number of years,
will almost necessarily be a defeat
for the Cardinal? We believe that
it should, for if the event be placed
on the intercollegiate calendar the
sport will be supported, and win
ning crews will be developed. We
have labored under the handicap
of having nothing but a "lakelet"
upon which to practice. With
proper support by the student body
it would be possible to establish
quarters upon San Francisco bay.
The first defeat should cause
neither discouragement nor dissat
isfaction. It will be remembered
that California did not despair,
although for many years she was
willing to accept a tie upon the
football field as virtually a victory
for the Blue and Gold.
