# Treasurer Has Good Surplus.
## 
### 
The finances of the student body
for the closing year will show a
surplus of about $350 after the
paying off of a large deficit from
the previous year. When Treas
urer Cowden took charge at the
beginning of the college year he
had to face debts amounting to
$3,500. During his term of office
he has not only paid off that sum,
but he has turned into the sinking
fund $1800, made permanent im
provements to the value of $300,
and will turn over to his successor
a surplus of about $350.
