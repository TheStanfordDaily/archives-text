# DEFEATED ON WATER.
## First Boat-race in History of College Results in Victory for California. 
### 
The first intercollegiate regatta,
which was rowed between the crews
of Stanford and California on the
waters of the Oakland estuary Sat
urday, resulted in a victory for the
University of California. Wash
ington did not enter a crew in the
varsity race, owing to the fact that
her boat was placed out of commis
sion by a broken seat. Both the
Varsity and Freshman crews of
Stanford were defeated by their op
ponents from California.
Interest in the event was mani
fested by the presence of a large
crowd of spectators. Rooters of
the rival universities were accom
modated on tug-boats, and other
people viewed the races from
launches and from the shore. In
all probably about a thousand peo
ple witnessed the races. The day
was a bad one for the races. A
cold wind was blowing and the
waters of the estuary were whipped
into a choppy sea. At the same
time the tide was going out, so that
the crews faced a very unsatisfac
tory situation. This had more
effect on the Stanford men than on
those of California, for the former
have been practicing on very
smooth water, while the California
crew uses this channel as a regular
practice course.
California won the toss and
chose the course near the wharf,
which was comparatively protected.
The two Freshman crews started
about even, but before the Stanford
boat had gone two hundred yards
the barge bad partially filled with
water, owing to the choppy sea,
and it became evident that the
Freshmen stood little chance of
winning the race. The California
oarsmen increased their lead and
finished about four hundred yards
ahead of their opponents. The
Stanford barge sank soon after the
finish line was crossed. The time
for the course, which was a mile
and a half in length, was eleven
minutes and thirty-two seconds.
The original plan in the Varsity
contest was to row a three-cornered
race between California, Washing
ton, and Stanford, but owing to an
accident to Washington's barge
only Stanford and California could
enter. The Varsity race was excit
ing from start to finish. The race
started late and at that time the
estuary was comparatively smooth.
California gained a lead of about a
length and a half by a beautiful
springing start. At the quarter
mile California had increased her
lead to three lengths. From here
the two crews kept this relative po
sition until the finish. The Stan
ford crew worked valiantly, but did
not succeed in gaining on their
rivals. The time was nine minutes
and fifty-eight seconds, or one min
ute and thirty-four seconds faster
than the time made by the Fresh
men.
The Varsity crews were as fol
lows:
Stanford — Butterfield, bow; W.
H. Dole, three ; B. Bryan, two;
Cheadle, stroke; Gaither,coxswain.
California — Grindley, captain,

bow; Bannister, time; Auloff, two;
Bunnell, stroke; Loeb, coxswain.
The Freshman crews were:
Stanford —(J. E. Dole, bow; Zim
merman, three; N. i\ Bryan, two;
Bee, stroke; Rosenfeld, coxswain.
California—Reeves, bow; Jones,
three; Joy, two; Schrieber, stroke;
Gray, coxswain.
