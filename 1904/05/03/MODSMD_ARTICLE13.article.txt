We are glad that Mrs. Stanford
has returned to the campus after
an absence of nearly one - year. The
University has grown to such an
extent and the surviving founder
has been away from the campus so
frequently during the last few years
that the personal relation between
student body and founders, which
was such a beautiful feature of
Stanford life during the early years
of the University, has been to some
extent clone away with. We all
hope that Mrs. Stanford's return
will make more close the feeling of
love and respect which we as stu
dents feel for her whose devotion
made possible the existence of the
University.
