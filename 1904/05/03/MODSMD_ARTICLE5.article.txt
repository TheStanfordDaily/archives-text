# "QUAD" APPEARS.
## 1905 Annual Placed on Sale Today. Well Rounded Account of Past Year. 
### 
The eleventh volume of the Stan
ford Quad, published l>y the Junior
class of 1905, was put on sale this
morning.
The exterior of the hook pre
sents a very attractive appearance.
It is firmly "bound in red buckram
cloth, surmounted by the seal of
the University in black and gold.
Exclusive of the advertisements
the book contains 370 pages, in
which is given a well rounded re
view of the year. All branches of
student activities are represented
in well balanced and finished form.
In this respect the book continues
the advance that has been made
during lute years toward making
the Quad what it should beâ€”purely
a record and history of the college
year. A noticeable reduction in
the number of "joshes" is com
mendable. Some of those that ap
pear are probably carried too far,
and it is probable that future an
nuals vvil 1 see fit to do away with this
feature entirely. Uniformity has
evidently been one of the chief
aims of the editor, and that char
acteristic of the book shows that
the aim has been realized.
Probably the only features of the
book that warrant adverse criticism
are the typographical errors and
the work on the half-tones, the
Junior class plates being far from
good.
The volume is dedicated to
George Edward Crothers, '95, secre
tary of the Board of Trustees. The
resolutions include the document
from the Board of Trustees to Mrs.
Stanford at the time they accepted
control of the University. "The
Stanford Spirit," by C. K. Field,
'95, is one of the best individual
features of the book. In a few
words it gives a beautiful exposi
tion of its title.
Three excellent contributions in
verse are " Exiled," by Mildred
Stanford,'ol, "Geisha," by R. E.
Renaud, ex-'O3, and Miss lrma
garde Richards' " Homer."
" Biding Our Time," by Presi
dent Jordan, briefly but compre
hensively states the link which the
past year has wrought in the his
tory of Stanford. This is followed
by a worthy article by C. M. Mar
rack, '01.
The list of faculty, organizations,
and fraternities is thorough and
complete. Several new additions
have been made to the usual lists.
Otherwise they follow the lines of
previous volumes.
The art work is thoroughly rep
resentative. Among the contribu
tors are a number of the best artists
who have been at Stanford in late
years. All the sketches and full
page illustrations deserve high
praise. Among the artists whose
work forms an attractive feature of
the volume are Miss Theodora
Holly, '04, R. W. Borough, '04,
Bristow Adams, ex-'OO, B. C. Bubb,
'04, H. R. Johnson, '04, and R. J.
Sterrett, '03.
" Ryerson's Annie," a story bv
Miss Gertrude M. Henry, '05, is
printed as the best prose literar}'
production of the year. Miss May

Hurlburt, '02, gives the attitude of
a graduate toward the University
in a commendable article. Presi
dent Jordan has a second contribu
tion, which outlines what the dis
tinctive college atmosphere of Stan
ford should be.
