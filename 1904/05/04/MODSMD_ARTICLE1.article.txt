# SPEAKS AT ASSEMBLY.
## Manager of the San Francisco "Call" Advocates Professional Schools of Journalism. 
### 
John McNaught, manager of the
San Francisco Call, gave an inter
esting address before the student
body assembly this morning. Mr.
McNaught spoke on the subject of
professional schools of journalism,
of which he expressed himself in
favor.
'"A few years ago," Mr. McNaught
said, ''the idea was dismissed as a
matter of no importance. Since
Pulitzer's endowment of a $2,000,-
000 school the matter has become
one of deep consideration in all the
great universities of the country.
There are three points to be consid
ered in connection with the matter:
First, is there anything about the
profession that can be taught theo
retically? Is there any great system
upon which it works? Second,
if such a system exists, can it be
taught at all? Third, is it of suf
ficient importance to engage the
attention of our highly-paid uni
versity professors?
"If the matter were left to a vote
of the university or of the press I
have little doubt that the decision
would be adverse. Both sides look
on the plan with distrust. But I
hold that all three points may be
answered in the affirmative. Jour
nalism may be defined as the
'science which treats of the rela
tion of current events to the public
interests.' A newspaper man will
succeed just in as far as he can tell
how much the news is going to
affect the public interests. Can the
relation of current events to public
interests be taught? It is taught
in every newspaper office in the
country today. Is it worth while
teaching? Here we have the for
midable opposition of those who
believe in art for art's sake. The
newspaper's whole art is bringing
matters of current interest down to
the level of the people. The spread
of knowledge among the common
people is surely commendable. But
this brings the scorn of those who
speak of "degrading and human
izing the higher mathematics."
Mr. McNaught said that because
of the growth of the great news
gathering associations the journal
ism of the future would be mainly
a matter of selecting and editing
matter. It will be a critical profes
sion, and the time will come when
there will be so great improvement
that the profession will be a liter
ary one. Here, he said, is where
the university could help by train
ing men to be critical, to look into
things and judge them correctly.
President Jordan, in opening the
assembly, announced the return of
Mrs. Stanford, who, he said, had
found that the shortest and best
way to England was across the
United States. Mrs. Stanford was
not present at the A'ssembly, but
she was heartily cheered. C. H.
Baker, '04, was assisted in the yell
leading by E. R. May, '06.
