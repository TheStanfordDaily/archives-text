# BOOK ON STANFORD.
## English. Club Has Begun Collection of Material, Which Will Be Published Next Semester. 
### 
The English Club will devote
itself from now until the publica
tion of the book to collecting mate
rial and compiling in book form a
history of the beginning and early
days of the University. The need
for such a volume has been ad- j
vanced very strongly on many oc
casions, and it has been considered
very essential that something!
should be accomplished before any
more time should have elapsed
and valuable material have been
lost.
It is expected that the book upon ,
which the English Club is now at
work will be ready for publication]
not later than next December. The
matter has been in the hands of a
committee for the whole of the past, j
year, but the work has necessarily ;
been slow, and as yet only a few of
the chapters have been completed.
Most of the work will be done dur
ing the vacation, however, so that
by next semester practically every-j
thing will have been finished except
the editing.
With the list of contributors se
cured by the English Club, there
can he no doubt that the book will i
be first-class, and of extreme value!
to all persons connected with, or |
interested in, the University. The!
general scheme consists of a com-J
prehensive view of the conditions!
lea ding upto the foundation of the [
University, the development and)
the gradual evolution of the organ
ization, told directly hymen and i
women who were intimately con-1
nected with Stanford from the start. I

Dr. Jordan will contribute the
leading and introductory chapter,
j His subject will be "The Planning
of the University," and will include
an account, by the man who was
more instrumental than any one
else in bringing it about, of the
temporary and permanent organi
zation of Stanford as a modern
I American university. Dr. Jordan
will also contribute a later chapter
j entitled "Dark Days," which will
describe the memorable period
| when the very life of the Univer
sity was endangered.
The entire growth of the Univer
sity will be covered in the different
accounts. G. K. Field, '95, will
(ell of early life in the dormitories.
! F. J. Batchelder, ex-'95, the first
student to register in the Univer
sity, will give an account of the
growth of the fraternities and the
founding of the various papers,
clubs, and student organizations
; that are in existence today.
One of the most interesting ac
counts will be that of the early be
ginnings of athletics at Stanford,
by Dr. Angell. Mrs. O. L. Elliott
will contribute a chapter on the
domestic life on the campus during
early days, and Mrs. Bartlett will
supplement this with an account
of similar conditions among stu
dents and members of the faculty
living in Palo Alto.
The last chapter will probably be
I an historical and geographical ac
count of Santa Clara county and
the country immediately in the
vicinity of the University prior to
its founding. This chapter will be
contributed by I. Russell, ; 04.
Throughout the book an effort
will be made to present as clearly
as possible the atmosphere sur

rounding the col lege,and especially
that of the early days, which it
endeavors to chronicle. It will be
profusely illustrated. Many of the
pictures which have been procured
possess a great deal of value and
interest themselves, in preserving
different phases in the growth of
the Universit}'.

bringing out the book consists of
the following: Mrs. L. K. Mat
thews, Mrs. O. L. Elliott, H. 11.
Johnson, '03, I. Russell, '04, and S.
S. Seward Jr., chairman.
