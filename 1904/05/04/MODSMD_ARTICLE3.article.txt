# TRACK ATHLETES TO GO TO CHICAGO.
## Stanford's Entry in Western Intercollegiate Field Day Accepted.—Seven or Eight Men Will Be Sent. 
### 
It has now been definitely de
cided that a number of Stanford's
best track men shall be sent to
Chicago to take part in the annual
Western intercollegiate field-day
on Marshall Field on June 4th.
The first step toward this was taken
at a special meeting of the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students Monday night, and today
word was received that Stanford's
representatives would be allowed to
compete. Nothing remains to be
done, therefore, but to collect the
money necessary for the men's ex
penses, which will be from $1000 to
$1200.
After the last California-Stanford
field-day a dispatch from Chicago
published in a San Francisco paper
stated that the two big colleges of
the West might bo invited to take
part in the Western intercollegiate
meet because of the good showing
that they had made. A letter had
also been received by Dr. Angell
from Evans Holbrook, an old Stan
ford graduate, and now a member
of the executive committee of the
Western Intercollegiate Associa
tion, offering to use his good offices
to secure the admission of Stanford.
After the refusal of the Eastern In
tercollegiate Association to accept
the entries of Stanford, the offer of
the Western association was fur
ther inquired into. In response to
Treasurer Cowden's telegram, the
following was received this morn
ing:
"Chicago, May 4. —Track meet
June 4th. Will forward entry
blanks. Evans Holbrook."
This reply is taken as an accept
ance of Stanford's request, and as
granting her permission to enter.
The matter of raising the neces
sary funds it is not believed will be
a difficult one. The Executive
Committee at its special meeting
Monday night made an appropria
tion of $800 toward the fund. It
is hoped the students, recognizing
the unusual merit of the team that
will he sent East and the good that
will come to the college from their
work, will contribute liberally to
make up the necessary amount. A
number of prominent men and wo
men will be named to canvass the
balls and the fraternities and
sororities. The members of the
faculty and others connected with
the University it is believed will be
glad to subscribe. The Stanford
Alumni Club of San Francisco has
already promised to support any
plan the students may form, and
graduates all over the country will
be appealed to.
An encouraging feature is the
readiness of the Palo Alto business
men to subscribe liberally. In a
brief canvass made as a test yester
day It. W. Barrett, '04, treasurer
elect of the student body, who is in
charge of the financial end of the
plan, collected $55. Every man
from whom he solicited a subscrip
tion gave it. The list is as follows:

F. C. Thiele $25 00
Thoits Bros 10 00
G. PI. Parkinson 10 00
Franklin, photographer.... 500
C. E. Jordan 2 50
Fuller & Co 2 50
An active canvass will now be
begun of Palo Alto and Mayfield,
and it is believed subscriptions can
also be obtained from San Jose and
San Francisco.
The following men have already
been appointed by Treasurer-elect
Barrett to collect subscriptions: M.
H. Thorpe, '05, A. M. Dibble, '05,
O. S. Lousley, '05, 11. E. Savage,
'05, W. H. Dole, '05, H. B. Haw
kins, '05, L. Gonsalves, '05, J. E.
Campbell, '06, H. I. Cruzan, '06.
All these men will carry receipt
books and render accounts to
Treasurer-elect Barrett. It has
been urged by the Executive Com
mittee that, as the time for action
is brief, subscriptions he made as
early as possible.
The team which will be sent East
will be composed of seven men, and
probably of eight. These will be
Norman Dole, '04, the pole-vaulter
and high jumper; O. E. Hvde, '04,
shot-putter; H. W. Bell, '05, broad
jumper and high jumper; R. F.
West, '06, broad jumper; J. M.
Beach, '04, pole-vaulter; W. F.
Dunn, '04, 220- and 440-yard
runner; and Captain F. S. Hol
tnan, '04, 880-yard and mile run
ner. The uncertain man is W. H.
Lanagan, the hurdler, who is at
present undecided, but who it is
hoped will see his way clear to
make the trip.
Some of the men have been
training regularly since the inter
collegiate field-day, and those who
have not will at once recommence.
It is the plan of Captain Holman,
who will be in charge of the squad,
to reach Chicago about five days
before the meet, to enable his men
to recover entirely from the effects
of their railway trip and be in the
best possible shape for the contests.

field-day a dispatch from Chicago
published in a San Francisco paper
stated that the two big colleges of
the West might bo invited to take
part in the Western intercollegiate
meet because of the good showing
that they had made. A letter had
also been received by Dr. Angell
from Evans Holbrook, an old Stan
ford graduate, and now a member
of the executive committee of the
Western Intercollegiate Associa
tion, offering to use his good offices
to secure the admission of Stanford.
After the refusal of the Eastern In
tercollegiate Association to accept
the entries of Stanford, the offer of
the Western association was fur
ther inquired into. In response to
Treasurer Cowden's telegram, the
following was received this morn
ing:
"Chicago, May 4. —Track meet
June 4th. Will forward entry
blanks. Evans Holbrook."
This reply is taken as an accept
ance of Stanford's request, and as
granting her permission to enter.
The matter of raising the neces
sary funds it is not believed will be
a difficult one. The Executive
Committee at its special meeting
Monday night made an appropria
tion of $800 toward the fund. It
is hoped the students, recognizing
the unusual merit of the team that
will he sent East and the good that
will come to the college from their
work, will contribute liberally to
make up the necessary amount. A
number of prominent men and wo
men will be named to canvass the
balls and the fraternities and
sororities. The members of the
faculty and others connected with
the University it is believed will be
glad to subscribe. The Stanford
Alumni Club of San Francisco has
already promised to support any
plan the students may form, and
graduates all over the country will
be appealed to.
An encouraging feature is the
readiness of the Palo Alto business
men to subscribe liberally. In a
brief canvass made as a test yester
day It. W. Barrett, '04, treasurer
elect of the student body, who is in
charge of the financial end of the
plan, collected $55. Every man
from whom he solicited a subscrip
tion gave it. The list is as follows:

F. C. Thiele $25 00
Thoits Bros 10 00
G. PI. Parkinson 10 00
Franklin, photographer.... 500
C. E. Jordan 2 50
Fuller & Co 2 50
An active canvass will now be
begun of Palo Alto and Mayfield,
and it is believed subscriptions can
also be obtained from San Jose and
San Francisco.
The following men have already
been appointed by Treasurer-elect
Barrett to collect subscriptions: M.
H. Thorpe, '05, A. M. Dibble, '05,
O. S. Lousley, '05, 11. E. Savage,
'05, W. H. Dole, '05, H. B. Haw
kins, '05, L. Gonsalves, '05, J. E.
Campbell, '06, H. I. Cruzan, '06.
All these men will carry receipt
books and render accounts to
Treasurer-elect Barrett. It has
been urged by the Executive Com
mittee that, as the time for action
is brief, subscriptions he made as
early as possible.
The team which will be sent East
will be composed of seven men, and
probably of eight. These will be
Norman Dole, '04, the pole-vaulter
and high jumper; O. E. Hvde, '04,
shot-putter; H. W. Bell, '05, broad
jumper and high jumper; R. F.
West, '06, broad jumper; J. M.
Beach, '04, pole-vaulter; W. F.
Dunn, '04, 220- and 440-yard
runner; and Captain F. S. Hol
tnan, '04, 880-yard and mile run
ner. The uncertain man is W. H.
Lanagan, the hurdler, who is at
present undecided, but who it is
hoped will see his way clear to
make the trip.
Some of the men have been
training regularly since the inter
collegiate field-day, and those who
have not will at once recommence.
It is the plan of Captain Holman,
who will be in charge of the squad,
to reach Chicago about five days
before the meet, to enable his men
to recover entirely from the effects
of their railway trip and be in the
best possible shape for the contests.
It has now been definitely de
cided that a number of Stanford's
best track men shall be sent to
Chicago to take part in the annual
Western intercollegiate field-day
on Marshall Field on June 4th.
The first step toward this was taken
at a special meeting of the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students Monday night, and today
word was received that Stanford's
representatives would be allowed to
compete. Nothing remains to be
done, therefore, but to collect the
money necessary for the men's ex
penses, which will be from $1000 to
$1200.
