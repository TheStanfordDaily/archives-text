David S. Jordan, President;
S. W. Young,
Chairman Committee.
Items "printing and incidentals"
include expenses for tickets, adver
tising, ushers, doorkeepers, etc.
"General incidentals" includes ex
pressage, telephoning, tuning, and
traveling expenses. Madame Schu
mann-Heink's generosity in reduc
ing her guarantee from $900 to
$500 nearly offset the deficit due to
delinquent subscribers.
During the year the Herschel
fund and the surplus from the
Schumann-Heink-Bispham con
cert of two years ago were turned
over to the committee to be devoted
to the purchase of a new piano.
These funds amounted to $385.
The balance due on the piano, in
cluding the expenditure forelevator
and other appliances for handling
and protecting the instrument,
is secured by a note signed by
members of the faculty.
For next year the committee is
in hopes of giving a series of four
or more concerts. It believes, how
ever, that the interest in chamber
music is not sufficiently great to
warrant all the concerts being of
that nature, and it therefore pro
poses to choose a more varied series
of programs. Just what the nature
of these programs will be can not
be told until next year, but the
committee is in close touch with
managers in San Francisco and
elsewhere, and if its plans for next
year do not fail, it feels certain
that it will be able to secure for
the University community the very
best attractions that its financial
backing will permit.
A canvass will be made in the
