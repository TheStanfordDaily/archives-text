The news that Stanford will be
allowed to enter a track team in
the Western intercollegiate meet
will be well received by all Stan
ford constituents. The opportun
ity that is now afforded the track
men is a rare one, and one that
should not be allowed to slip by.
To send a representative number
of athletes to these games requires
but one thing—sufficient funds.
The able showing that Stanford
can make this year and the un
usual opportunity are such that
the question of finances should not
prevent the completion of the pro
ject. Already a good start has
been made toward raising money.
But it is not expected that all
of the necessary amount can bp
raised from business men. A gen
erous and prompt effort on the part
of the students and other members
of the University community will
alone result in the successful com
pletion of the trip. Such assist
ance is, however, absolutely neces
sary and it is expected that no one
will refuse to aid the project by not
contributing to its finances. There
is much to be derived from sending
a team to the East. A creditable
showing will bring to Stanford a
greater appreciation by Eastern
institutions. The athletes will ad
vertise the University in a legiti
mate way. The fact that our track
men are given a trip of this kind
will draw much good athletic
material here that might not other
wise come. With these advantages
in view we should not overlook the
present duty that is placed upon
us.
