That the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students should
be forced to adopt the stringent
measures passed at last night's
meeting to compel students to pay
their subscriptions to the college
paper is further evidence of the
lack of support which the student
body renders to its publications.
Much has been said in regard to
the comparatively few subscribers
to the college papers, but the phase
considered by the Executive Com
mittee last night has not been
mentioned publicly before. For a
number of years past there have
been subscriptions which, through
no fault of the management of the
paper, have not been collected.
Last year a considerable loss whs
due to this cause. It is now late
in the college year and, as has been
the case in previous years, many
subscriptions are still unpaid. To
assure the payment of outstanding
debts the Executive Committee, has
taken action. Its action is thor
oughly justifiable in view of the
fact that the Daily Palo Alto is
published bv the students, and also
for the reason that a loss in sub
scriptions means a considerable
financial loss to the student body
treasury, which shares in any sur
plus made by the paper.
