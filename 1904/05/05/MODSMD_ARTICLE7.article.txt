# FOOTBALL RULES FOR 1904.
## Several Important Changes Will Go Into Effect Next Year. 
### 
The college football rules com
mittee met recently in Philadel
phia and made several radical
changes which are intended to
make the game more open and lees
dangerous than formerly.
The principal new rules relate to
the scoring of points, number of
men allowed back of the line, the
running of the quarter-back with
the ha 11, penalties, and the prefer
ence of the kick-off. Hereafter a
drop-kick or a place-kick will count
four instead of live points. This
prevents a team that has worked
hard for a touch-down from having
the score tied by a lucky place
kick. Had this rule been in force
during the last few seasons, many
victories would have been reversed.
During next season the quarter
back will be allowed to run with
the ball on any part of the grid
iron. Last year that player was
allowed to take the ball for the
first time, but his territory was
restricted to the space between the
twentv-fi ve-yard lines. Six instead
of seven men will be required on
the scrimmage line. With the
quarter-back and four men behind
the line, one of whom, however,
must play outside the tackle, the
offensive game will be greatly
strengthened. The committee de
cided that twenty yards was too
great a penalty, and the maximum
was fixed at fifteen yards. The
ten-yard penalty for off-side play,
and similar offences, was reduced
one-half. A new penalty of five
yards will be imposed by the
officials if a player draws an oppo
nent off side by any trick.
Definite rules were adopted re
garding the fair catch. If a man
is intefered with while making a
fair catch, his team may either re
ceive fifteen yards and put the ball
in play by a scrimmage, or the
player may be given five yards and
a free kick. A losing team may
have its choice of the kick-off.
When a team, kicking the ball
out from the twenty-yard line,
after a touch-back or safety, shall
kick the ball out of bounds twice,
the ball shall be putin play from
the thirty-five-yard line. The cen
ter must then be fifteen yards from
the ball in the kick-off.
