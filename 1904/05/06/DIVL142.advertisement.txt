a desire to be of assistance. At such times
the spirit of helpfulness asserts itself, but so

Pond's Extract—the old family doctor—a
recognized emergency remedy, for over «0
years used by nurses, physicians and hos
pitals. Every student should have a bottle
close at hand. Quickly stops bleeding In
deep cuts; cures bruises, sprains, and pre
