## Nearly One Thousand Students Entertained at the Residence of the Surviving Founder. 
### 
The reception in honor of Mrs.
Stanford's home-coming occurred
on the grounds of the residence
last night. The affair was a com
plete success in every respect, and
will long he remembered by every
one present as an earnest display
of enthusiasm and loyalty.
The students formed in line at 9
in front of Memorial Arch, and,
headed by the University Hand,
marched to the residence where
preparations had been made for
their reception. There were between
eight hundred and a thousand
students participating. The grounds
at the residence were brilliantly
lighted by Japanese lanterns and
electric lights. Mrs. Stanford ap
peared on the porch, where she was
greeted with cheer after cheer by
those who had gathered in front of
the house.
In her words of welcome Mrs.
Stanford spoke feelingly of the
receptions and manifestations of
loyalty with which the men and
women of the University have
always greeted her upon her return
from travels. She said that it is
the one thing above all others
which makes her home-coming a
joy and a pleasure, and that not
alone at the University is she so
welcomed, but everywhere she has
gone there are Stanford students
who have greeted her with warm
regard and have done everything
they could to make her travels
pleasant. In both India and
Japan she met old Stanford grad
uates, both native and American,
scattered in different parts of those
countries, where they hold positions
of importance. In the faculty of
the Itoyal University of Japan
there are twenty-six Stanford grad
uates. Mrs. Stanjord told of a
number of incidents during her
trip showing conditions in the
Orient pertaining to the war now
in progress. To all inquiries made
there regarding entrance to the
University she replied that the
requirements must be passed, as
the University will continue to
keep the attendance down to a
number which can be well handled
and properly trained.
After the conclusion of Mrs.
Stanford's words of welcome the
students joined in the college songs
and yells until their repertoire was
exhausted, and then repaired to the
long tables under the trees, where
an elaborate luncheon had been
spread.
