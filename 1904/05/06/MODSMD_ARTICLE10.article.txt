Nothing could be more signifi
cant m showing the sportsmanlike
spirit and friendly feeling that
have grown up between the Univer
sity of California and Stanford
during the past few years than the
act of California's student body in
presenting to Norman Dole a mark
of appreciation for his brilliant
athletic work. The students of a
rival university have in this way
shown the spirit of "sport for
sport's sake" that now exists in
the two great universities of the
West. The well-merited gift goes
to one of Stanford's athletes indi
vidually, but it carries with it a
broader meaning to the Stanford
student body, which can not say too
much in appreciation of the act.
