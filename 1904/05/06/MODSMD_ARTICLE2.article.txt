Preparations for the production

are progressing rapidly. Thus far
fourteen full rehearsals have been

Tonight the cast and orchestra
rehearse together for the first time,
and a like rehearsal will be held
every day next week.
The part of the "Solicitor,"
which was not assigned at the first
announcement of the cast, will be
filled by P. C. Edwards, '06.
