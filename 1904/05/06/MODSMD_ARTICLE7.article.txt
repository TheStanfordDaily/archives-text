# ANNUAL ADDRESS TO SIGMA XI.
## Instructive Lecture on Solar System Delivered Last Evening by Dr. W.W. Campbell. 
### 
Dr. W. W. Campbell last night
delivered the second annual ad
dress before the Stanford chapter
of the Society of Sigma Xi, on
"The Motion of the Solar System
in Space."
He began with a brief description
of the solar system, laying especial
stress upon the magnitude of the
center of the system. Very little
progress in 6teliar astronomy could
be made before about 1860, when
the spectroscope appeared in the
held as a new and powerful instru
ment in astronomical research. By
means of this instrument it is pos
hihle to determine the motion of
the stars in the line of sight, while
the telescope can give evidence of
only proper motion. The develop
ment of the lines in the spectra in
dicate whether the motion is one of
approach or recession. A large
number of stars have thus been
proved binary while the dark com
panion has never been Been by the
telescope and probably never can
be seen. About one out of every
seven stars that we see in the
heavens is a binary.
About one hundred years ago
Herschel noticed that the stars near
the constellation Hercules tend to
separate, while those which lie
180 degrees from this point tend
to approach each other. He con
cluded that our solar system is
moving toward this constellation.
This conclusion has been verihed
by a large number of observations.
One of the problems which is now
being investigated at the Lick Ob
servatory and its branch in Chile
is a more exact determination of
the point in the heavens toward
which we are moving and of the
rate of motion. The observations
which have been reduced indicate
a motion of about miles per
second, which is about one-half of
the average motion of the stars.
At the end of the address the
lecturer exhibited a number of very
beautiful slides of nebulae in vari
ous stages or development, begin
ning with the great nebulae of
Orion. He explained how stars are
supposed to have developed, and
called attention to the points on
various nebulae which will prob
ably develop into future suns. The
large number of spiral nebulae
seems to give evidence of such mo
tion as we have in the solar system,
while it does not furnish an ex
planation of this motion. Hence
it appears that thousands of such
systems as our solar system are
now in process of development, and
that many new stars will appear
in future aces, while some of the
older ones will disappear.
