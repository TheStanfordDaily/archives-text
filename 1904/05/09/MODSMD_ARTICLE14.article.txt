# SERMON BY BISHOP HAMILTON.
## Speaks in Memorial Church on the Fulfillment of Paul's Prophecy. 
### 
Bishop John \V. Hamilton of
San Francisco preached in Memo
rial Church Sunday morning. Dr.
Hamilton sought to show that the
present era is beholding the fulfill
ment of the prophecy in the text,
Galatians iii, 28: "There is neither
Jew nor Greek, there is neither
bond nor free: for ye are all one in
Christ Jesus."
The speaker said that we have
been permitted to see the close of
the first Christian century since
Christ ilied. There has been much
of Christianity in former centuries,
but this is the first in which the
humanitarian side has been prac
ticed. Faith consisted then in out
ward form of worship, confined to
a particular hour in a particular
place. Christianity is now much
wider. Formerly to the priests
were delegated all the duties of the
Church. They were supposed to be
better than the laymen and to have
such intimacy with God that they
excused the others, it was not
until our time that the truer rela
tion was found — that all things are
related to Him, with Him, and
should he so* regarded as to help
Him. Christianity is everywhere
and includes everything.
No longer is one ministry dele
gated to attend to moral obliga
tions. Teachers, farmers, all classes,
are ministers as well as are the
preachers. There are great move
ments abroad among men for
Christianity, and the notable fea
ture is not so much in the individ
uals so engaged as in the method,
the general motive.
The Jewish faith, from which
ours was copied, has always been

exclusive. It was not until the be
ginning of the nineteenth century
that the great missionary move
ments, the great altruistic move
ments, began. The missionary
movement breaks down the wall
between the exclusive and the
broad, destroys divisions into caste.
From 1800 to 1825 may be said to
be the announcement of this move
ment.
The next ethical movement,
"there is neither bond nor free,"
began about this time in the agita
tion for the abolition of slavery.
In this the American movement |
became the world movement, and
its results were adopted by Ena
land and bv Russia even before
they were accomplished in this
country.
The third ethical movement,
"neither male nor female," is ex- i
emplified in the destruction in civ
ilized countries of the former in
equality between the two and the I
granting to women of equal privi-l
leges of education and vocation.
. . I
Woman's life the whole world wide
has been one of drudgery and
slavery, and it. is still so to an ex- j
tent in all other countries than our
own. But America lias set the pace
in the last third of the century,
I which, like the slavery agitation,!
will become world-wide and will
result in recognizing woman in her
true position.
The last great ethical movement, |
"all one in Christ J%sus," is simply i
! the culmination of the beginning.
The missionary movement would!
! be nothing without the fulfillment
I of this. It has resulted in a gen
eral movement toward union of be
lief in spirit, whether or not we are
of the same Bocial castes and cir
cumstances. The Christian church
is the only institution that takes a
man without reputation, without

character, and gives him both. It
is this unity of fellowship that is to
found that unity of race which is
to unite us in Christian lands.
