# MEETING OF LAW ASSOCIATION.
## Dean of the Harvard Law School to Deliver Principal Address Next Friday. 
### 
The Stanford Law Association,
which was formed last year by the
students of the Law department,
will hold its second annual meet
ing next Friday. The meeting will
be much in the nature of a celebra
tion, which will continue through
out the day. There will be a busi
ness meeting in the morning in the
chapel, for the election of officers
for the ensuing year. A lecture
will take place in Assembly Hall
in the afternoon, and a banquet at
the University Inn in the evening.
The lecture, which will be a not
able one, will occur at 2. Dr.
James Barr Ames, dean of the
Harvard Law School, will speak
on "Fair Competition under the
Law." J)r. Ames will make a spec
ial trip to this Coast for the pur
pose of delivering this lecture.
The address will be one of great
value, as Dr. Ames is considered
one of the foremost of American
jurists. Shortly after the lecture a
reception will be held in the Law
building in honor of Dr. Ames, to
which all the University commun
ity is invited. The rooms will be
fittingly decorated for the occasion,
and music will be furnished by
Yanke's orchestra.
A banquet will be given at 6:30
at the University Inn for the mem
bers of the Law Association. Toasts
will be responded to by prominent
members of the faculty and stu
dents, and probably by Dr. A nes.
The large dining-rooms of the Inn
will be decorated with potted plants
and flowers, and arrangements will
be made to accommodate over one
hundred persons. Yanke's orches
tra will furnish music during the
dinner.
