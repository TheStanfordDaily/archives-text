# BASEBALL REVIEW.
## List of Batting Averages Made by Varsity During the Past Season. 
### 
Of the men that composed Stan
ford's baseball team this year it is
probable that with the exception of
Captain Ball and Knight every
man will be back next spring.
With so many old men back, Stan
ford should have a strong team
next season. Captain Ball's posi
tion behind the bat may be filled
by Stott, who played good ball
during the early part of the season,
while Knight's position in the field
will be contested for by a number
of good second-team men. With
so many old players the coach will
not have the difficulty of making a
team out of the large amount of
new material that confronted Coach
Doyle this year. California will
also have a veteran team next sea
son. Captain Adams, the short
stop, will be the only man lost by
the Blue and Gold. Roth teams
will naturally be much stronger
next season,and high class baseball
is to be expected.
In a review of the season's bat
ting Sales has the highest average
and is followed by Ball and Knight.
Seven of this year's Varsity batted
over the two hundred mark, while
but one got a higher average than
three hundred. Most of the play
ers fell below their average in inter
collegiate games. In the three
games against California, Knight
has the highest average, five hun
dred per cent, obtaining four hits
out of eight times at the bat. Ball
is second, with an average of two
hundred and fifty. Williams, who
headed the list in batting last sea
son, has dropped back to sixth
place, while Sales, who hit in poor
form last season, leads.
The following is the list of all
the men who played on the Var
sity at any time during the season,
with the number of times at bat,
hits, and average for the season:
