# DOLE RECEIVES MEDAL.
## Pacific Athletic Association Rewards Pole-Vaulter.â€” Cup from California. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Norman
Dole, '04, was presented with a
gold medal by Herbert Mauser,
secretary-treasurer of the Pacific
Athletic Association. This medal
was given in commemoration of
Dole's wonderful vault of 12 feet
1.82 inches, which lie made on the
University of California oval at the
Olympian games try-outs on April
23d. The medal is made of gold
and is suspended from a small gold
bar. The lettering, which states
the height of the vault and also
gives Dole's name, is in blue en
amel. In the middle of the medal
there is a representation of an ath
lete in the act of vaulting. The
workmanship is first-class and the
medal is very handsome.
Next Monday morning Dole will
go to Berkeley to receive a loving
cup which is to be presented to him
by the students of the University
of California. All the arrange
ments have been made, and the
presentation will be a function of
great interest. It takes place on
Class Day, which is one of the most
important days in the college year
at California. The presentation
probably will be made in the great
Greek amphitheatre.
