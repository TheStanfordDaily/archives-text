College
Doctor
Pon d's Ex trac tis an every day stand-by
among college students. They know
that it Is a sovereign remedy for the
many accidents incidental to school
life. Pond's Extract—the old family
doctor—might with equal propriety he
called the old college doctor. For over
60 years Pond's Extract lias been doing
a work of mercy—curing cuts, bruises,
burns; relieving aches and pains;
easing suffering, and making life
brighter. It, is just as efficient to-day.
A bottle should always lie kept conve
nient. Soothes and freshens the face
after shaving. Don'texperiment with
so-called remedies said to
tie "just as good ns Pond's
Extract"—there is no
.substitute. Watered Witch
Hazel, a weak solution
—sometimes offered in
place of Pond's Extract
—has no medicinal
value—ls positively
worthless. Pond's Ex
tract CURES—therefore
is priceless.
Sold only in scaled bottle»
under huff wrapper.
ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE.
