# PROF. A. W. SMITH LEAVES.
## Elected Director of Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering at Cornell. 
### 
Professor Albert W. Smith, head
of the departments of Mechanical
and Electrical Engineering, has re
signed his position in order to ac
cept the directorship of Sibley col
lege of Mechanical and Electrical
Engineering, Cornell University.
Professor Smith received his ap
pointment on Saturday, when the
Cornell trustees met at Ithaca. He
left immediately for the East in
answer to their call, in order that
appointments and other details of
administration for the year might
be gone over. He will return to

has not yet been settled.
The appointment of Professor
Smith to the head of Sibley confers
upon him the highest honor that
could come to an instructor in his
line of work. He is putin charge
of the largest and most important
school of mechanical engineering in
the United States, which has an en
rollment of over one thousand stu
dents from all over the world. He
succeeds Dr. R. H. Thurston, the
distinguished engineer under whose
administration from 1885 until his
death last fall, Sibley College has
been built up to be the most im
portant department of Cornell Uni
versity and one of the leading
engineering colleges of the world.
Professor Smith has been chosen as
the man best fitted in the United
States to carry on the important
work.
Albert William Smith was grad
uated as bachelor of mechanical
engineering from Cornell Univer
sity in 1878 and as master of
mechanical engineering in 1886.
Between these dates he worked as
machinist, foreman and superin
tendent in various Eastern shops.
In 1880-87 he held a fellowship in
mechanical engineering at Cornell,
and for the next four years was as
sistant professor of mechanical en
gineering in that institution. Dur
ing 1891-92 he was professor of
machine design at the University
of Wisconsin. In the fall of the
latter year he came to Stanford
University to become head of the
Mechanical Engineering depart
ment. During the past few years
Professor Smith has spent consid
erable time with big engineering
linns of the East, lie spent his
sabbatical year, 1898, with the
Dickson Manufacturing Company
at Scranton, and for two years, be
ginning June, 1900, he was with
Westinghouse, Church, Kerr it Co.

specialty is heat engines.
Professor Smith has always been
remarkably successful as u teacher.
Through his line personality he has
been able to reach young men, and
he is held in the highest esteem and
admiration by all his students.
Professor Smith is a member of the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineering and has written a num
ber of books oil the materials of
engineering and also on machine

design. He was one of the founders
of the Sigma Xi scientific honor
society at Cornell. Ah an under
graduate he was prominent as an
oarsman, having rowed on the vic
torious freshman crew in 1875 and
in the varsity crew in 1870. He
has been the most active promoter
of rowing at Stanford, and his de
parture will he a serious loss to the
boating men. He has long been
