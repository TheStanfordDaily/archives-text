# Last "Chaparral" Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The fifth annual commencement
number of the Chaparral will he
on sale tomorrow. The editors
have made every effort to make the
final number the best of the year
and representative of the maga
zine's growth. The leading art
feature is a full-page drawing by
It. \V. Borough, '05, and is a varia
tion from his usual style. Oppen
heim, '05, has a humorous pictorial'
sketch entitled "The Boarding
club." A sketch based on com
plications growing out of the
fact that Commencement comes at
the same time this year at Berke
ley and at Stanford, is the leading
prose feature. The verse deals
largely with the Senior "sourball"
and the general tired feeling of the
final weeks. Editorially tribute is
paid to Will 11. Irwin, '99, who is
soon to leave the Coast to take an
editorial position on the New York
Sun.
