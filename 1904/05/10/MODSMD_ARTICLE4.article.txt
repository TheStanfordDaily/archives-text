# MUSICAL CLUBS' OFFICERS.
## W.H. Lanagan and A.W. Hooper Will Lead Musicians Next Year. 
### 
The combined Glee and Mando
lin Clubs held a business meeting
last evening in the chapel, and
elected officers for the next college
year. The following were elected
without a contest: Leader of the
(jilee Club, A. W. Hooper, '05;
manager of the Glee Club, Hugh
Park, Jr., '00; leader of the Man
dolin Club, YV. H. Lanagan, '04;
manager of the Mandolin Club, M.
L. Van Norden, '04; president of
Combined Clubs, 13. R. Cocks, '05;
secretary-treasurer, Norman E.
Dole, '04.
'1 he two men who will lead the
clubs next year are well known in
musical circles at Stanford, and
have been identified with the or
ganizations since their first year in
college. Lanagan has had con
siderable experience, having very
successfully led the Mandolin Club
during the past year. It was
largely due to his leadership that
the Mandolin Club reached the
high mark which it attained this
year. Hooper has sung on the
Glee Club for two years and is be
sides a valuable specialty man.
Owing to the fact that the con
stitutions of the clubs do not per
mit a member to serve on the ex
ecutive committee who has not
made the clubs for two years, it
was found necessary to put over
the election of permanent executive
committees until next semester, a
fact which points decidedly to the
large number of underclassmen at
present in the organizations. Tem
porary committees, which will be
entitled to pick the men in next
semester's try-out, and to act in the
place of the regular executive com
mittees, were elected. The com
mittee for the Glee Club is as fol
lows: A. W. Hooper, '05, It. H.
Lachmund, '00, and H. L. Dearing,
'06; for the Mandolin Club, W. 11.
Lanagan, '04, E. R. May, '06, and
F. B. Goudy, '05.
It was decided that "shingles"
should be awarded to all members
of the clubs who took the Northern
trip during the holidays. Those in
possession of "shingles" will not be
compelled to take part in future
try-outs, but will he entitled to
their places without further com
petition.
In taking the chair, President
elect Cocks spoke of several matters
that have come before the clubs
during the past year, and outlined
the plans which he had in mind
for next year. He laid particular
stress upon the general attitude of
the student body toward the clubs
because of the latter's alleged fail
ure to keep their engagements.
The chief stated cause for dissatis
faction he said has been the failure
of the Glee Club t<> be present in a
body at Assemblies, where their
singing would be an important
factor. As a matter of fact, Cocks
stated that on only two occasions
did the Glee Club promise to be on
hand, and on both of these occa
sions kept their promise.
Next year the clubs should show
considerable improvement, as the
loss from graduation will be com

para lively light, and with the
usual amount of new material and
thin year's training, a decided ad
vance should he made. A trip to
the southern part of the State is
contemplated, and it is expected
that it will prove more successful
than this year's tour, as the ex
penses will he much lighter and the
chances for big houses correspond
ingly better.
