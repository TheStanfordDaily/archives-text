# JUNIORS VOTE SUBSCRIPTION.
## $100 Given Toward Track-Team Fund from Treasury of '05 Class. 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior class
held in the chapel at 1:15 today a
motion whs unanimously carried to
subscribe $100 from the class treas
ury toward the fund now being
raised for the eastern trip of the
track team. The class at the pres
ent time has about $-150 in its
treasury. A deduction of the $100
voted today will leave the Juniors
$350 with which to begin their
Senior year. The meeting today
also authorized the class president
to appoint a committee to consider
and act upon the advisability of
giving class sweaters to men who
played on the Junior baseball
team.
A big benefit baseball game has
been arranged for Thursday after
noon to add to the fund required
to send the track team to the West
ern intercollegiate lield-day on
Marshall Kield. The teams will be
the Varsity and a strong aggrega
tion of alumrii and other good
players. This will be the last
game of the Varsity, and every
man will be in his place. Iteid of
Belmont, the Harvard catcher, and
J. F. Lanagan, '00, will be the bat
tery for the opposing team. George
Hatch, the University of California
catcher, will play first base, and
Cowden, '03, will be on second.
Elston, a California varsity man
of some years ago and assistant
coach last season, will cover short,
and F. A. Brown, '03, Stanford
varsity captain last year, will be
on the third bag. McGilvray, ex
'o4, will be in left field; Parker,
'03, in center; and Ireland, the
captain and manager of the Inde
pendents of San Francisco, in right
field. The game will be called at
3:30. The price of admission will
be 50 cents.
Since yesterday, in addition to
the donation by the Juniors,
Treasurer-elect Barrett has received
$60 in subscriptions from students.
No further collections have been
made from business men. The
amount that can be relied upon at
the present time is about as fol
lows:
Business men $194 50
Students 281 00
Associated Students 300 00
Junior class 100 00
Total $875 50
These figures still show a short
age of $325, which must lie raised
before the necessary amount will be
reached. As the canvass has been
thoroughly made in the business
districts the balance will have to
come from the students.
