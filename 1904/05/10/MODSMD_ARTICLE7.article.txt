Thk action taken by the Junior
class today in voting one hundred
dollars toward the track fund is
indeed commendable. This money
will help materially to remove any
question as to whether or not Stan
ford will he able to send a team to
the Western intercollegiate field
meet. An additional amount of sixty
dollars subscribed by students has
also helped to swell the fund to a
point where the student body can
not now afford to give up the
project. Yet the whole difficulty
has not been surmounted. Nearly
every source has been given a
thorough canvass and still there
remains a balance unraised of over
three hundred dollars. The Alum
ni and a benefit baseball game will
not furnish all the deficit. More
must be forthcoming from individ
ual subscriptions by students. It
is true that at this particular time
of the year there are many drains
upon the finances of members of
the University community. But
it is also true that the opportunity
now afforded is one that is worthy
of considerable self-sacrifice. The
importance of prompt donations
should bring forth the remaining
amount within the next few days
from those who have not yet sub
scribed.
