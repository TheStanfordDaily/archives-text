# BOATING REVIEW.
## Next Season's Prospects and Plans. Outline of Rowing History at Stanford. 
### 
The success of the Stanford Boat
ing Association was sufficiently
marked during the past year to
place boating on the list of Stan
ford athletics, for a time at least.
Next year land is to be purchased
on the slough and the Boat Club
will there install a boathouse with
proper facilities for rowing. Quiet
water is available for a course al
most four miles long, so the disad
vantages encountered on Lagunita
this year for want of sufficient
space to practice will be overcome.
The financial condition of the club
is good and plenty of funds will be
available to make the intended im
provements next year.
The members of both the Varsity
and Freshman crews will all be
back next year. With these men
and the large number of other en
thusiastic rowers which are here,
Stanford should turn out a first
class crew next year.
The natural rivals of Stanford on
water will be the University of
Washington and California. At
both of these Colleges boating has
been a prominent sport for years,
but not until now has the boating
spirit at Stanford been strong
enough to enter the new field.
As long ago as 1893 there were
a few undergraduates who sought
to install boating as a regular in
tercollegiate sport. Efforts were
made to organize a crew to repre
sent Stanford at the intercollegiate
regatta held at the World's Fair
in Chicago in 1893. Senator Stan
ford subscribed $800 toward the

necessary shell and outfit. A boat
club was quickly organized and a
boat-house built on lake Lagunita.
The enthusiasm of the College at
large, however, proved not to be
equal to that of those directly in
terested. This, together with the
fact that there were no experienced
oarsmen in college, led to the
abandonment of the scheme and
the gradual disintegration of the
boat-club. The boat-house which
was erected then, has been remod
eled during the past season, and is
being used as the training quarters
of the present club.
Last season the boating spirit at
Stanford took a brace, mainly
owing to the encouragement of
Professor A. W. Smith, whose valu
able assistance will be missed next
year. The Stanford boat-club was
organized with a membership of
nearly fifty, not a fourth of whom
ever took active interest in rowing
or attended the meetings. A sub
scription list was circulated and as
a result about $500 was collected.
This was sufficient to begin on,
and accordingly a pair-oared barge
was bought, and a four-oared barge
rented from the University of Cali
fornia Boating Association. With
these two boats to practice with
Professor Smith succeeded in leach
ing a few men the rudiments of
boating, and helped to develop
some who were more or less famil
iar with the sport.
This year prospects seemed
brighter than >-ver. The Freshman
class contained several men who
were interested in boating, and a
few of them -had had considerable
experience. With this influx of
new material and the return of last
year's enthusiasts, a real Stanford

spirit asserted itself. Theclubwas
reorganized and only those actual
ly engaged in rowing were allowed
to join. It now has a membership
of over fifty.
