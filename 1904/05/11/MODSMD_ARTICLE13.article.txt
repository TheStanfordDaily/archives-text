# ANNUAL GUILD REPORT.
## Review of Work Done by Students' Hospital During Its First Year. 
### 
Following is a report on the
management of (he Students' Guild
Hospital for the six months begin
ning September 1, 1903, and end
ing April 30, 1904. The report
was prepared by J. P. Mitchell,
president of the guild.
During this period of eight
months 124 patients were admitted
to the Palo Alto hospital for an
average stay of 8.5 days each. The
longest stay was 42 days (but this
patient was still in the hospital on
May Ist), and the shortest stay was
1 day. The total number of
days' nursing furnished was
1036.
The greasiest number in the
hospital at one time was 15 ; and
the average number in the hospital
at a time throughout the entire
eight months was about four.
The expense of running the hos
pital may be divided under three
heads â€”Household Expenses, Main
tenance Expenses, and Patients'
Expenses. The first two should be
met by the required fee, the last by
the charge for hospital service. The
first and last will vary with the
number of nurses and patients in
the hospital, the second will vary
somewhat in the same way but to a
much less degree. Under house
hold expenses are included all the
expenses incurred in providing
board for the matron, nurses, and
patients; under maintenance ex
penses, the salaries of the matron,
head nurse and night nurse, the
janitor service beyond that fur
nished for room and board, and the

other expenses which are not de
pendent upon the number in the
hospital; under patients'expenses
are included all those incurred in
the care of the patients and which
depend on the number and nature
of the cases in the hospital.
A statistical tabulation shows
that the average number in the
household was 5.1, the average cost
of board per month was $9.85, and
the total cost of running the house
hold was $403.77. The total sal
aries were $791, the average per
month $98.87. The cost of furnace
coal was $103.95, janitor service
$47.05, and the total cost of main
tainance was $1,403.61.
The charge of $1.00 per day cov
ered the cost and left a surplus of
$119.15, or an average surplus of
$14.89 per month. This means
that if all the household and main
tenance expenses, as well as the
cost of equipment, permanent im
provements from time to time, and
various incidental expenses which
are not included in the above table,
can be met by the income from the
Guild fee, then it is possible to pro
vide for the additional cost of each
patient by the charge of $1.00 per
day. If, however, the fee should
not be adequate to meet all these
running expenses then the charge
for hospital service would have to
be raised.
A great variety of diseases were
treated in the hospital, the most
important numerically being: Ton
silitis 29, diphtheria 9, bronchitis
7, and measles 9. If was found to
be impossible to provide adequate
accommodations for properly segre
gating the contagious diseases, and
jin view of the possibility of infec-
I lion under the present conditions,
