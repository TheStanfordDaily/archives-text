# NO RIGHT TO SELL NOTES.
## Interesting and Instructive Paper by a Member of the Law Faculty. 
### 
The question of the right of a
teacher to control the publication
of his lecture-notes has recently
and inadvertently arisen here, and
a correct answer to this question
and to certain secondary questions
â€¢may be of importance.
The teacher who delivers orally
iin his class-room lectures which
are his own literary composition
does not within the meaning of the
copyright law "publish" such lec
tures to the whole world, so as to
entitle any one to republish them
without the permission of the
author. On the contrary, such
publication would he ground for an
injunction restraining further sim
ilar acts, and for damages. The
position has been taken by some
judges that the reconstruction of
the lectures, with some improve
ment in form, and correction of
errors, is a sufficiently original and
creative act to entitle the reporter
to lie regarded as an independent
author and within the protection
of the copyright law. This view is
not sustained by later cases. In
the case of Professor Caird of Glas
gow a further principle was estab
lished by the House of Lords, to
the effect that the oral delivery of
lectures in a university to students
who paid to hear them is not a
''publication" to the world. It was
argued that by delivering the lec
tures in such a public place they
thereby became public property, but
this construction was not sustained.
Besides the legal wrong to the
lecturer from such publication,
there is a wrong to the university.
In some institutions two devices
are employed to abridge the labor
of students: one is the private tutor
to coach, and the other the dealer
in lecture-notes. Both are profit
able, both enable a student to idle
until a few days before examina
tions, when with the aid of coach
or notes he can frequently pass a
creditable examination. But either
device is destruction of mental
training and real knowledge. Any
person who deals in lecture-notes T
without the sanction of the instruc
tor, is contributing to the decline
of scholarship among his patrons.
Such a trade is profitable and eas
ily can be carried on. Only a right
view of its demoralizing effect can
counteract it; only a healthy sen
timent in the university body can
overcome such bacteria. It is
much to be desired that Stanford
be saved from the fight against this
practice which has been going on
in one or two Eastern universities.
