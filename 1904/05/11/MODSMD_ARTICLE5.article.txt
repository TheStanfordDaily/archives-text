# OPERA WILL OPEN FESTIVITIES.
## Synopsis of "Patience."—Final Rehearsals Point to Very Successful Presentation Tomorrow Night. 
### 
Tomorrow evening at 8:15 Gil-1
I>ert and Sullivan's comic opera, t
" Patience," will he presented in
Assembly Hall by the Senior class.
The opera this year takes the place
of a class farce. Rehearsals have
been in progress for several weeks
under the direction of \V. B. Hart-1
lett, a professional trainer, and as
a result the whole production is
given in an excellent manner. The
cast is made up of the best actors
and singers in college, and the suc
cess of the production is practically
assured. The main part of the
play is as follows:
Twenty rapturous maidens, who j
have fallen in love with Bunthorne,!
a super-aesthetical poet, appear
upon the stage singing of their love
which is, however, unrequited,
because Bunthorne loves the milk
maid Patience. Twenty dragoons
then appear, and find to their hor
ror that the maidens have eyes
only for the poet Bunthorne and
despise the military men whom
the)' adored only a year before.
In great indignation they leave
the stage, and when Bunthorne
finds himself alone he confesses
that he is merely an "aesthetic
sham."
Patience then refuses Bun
thorne's proffer of his love, and con
fesses to the Lady Angela that she
loves one whom she knew as a
child. Grosvenor then enters and
proves to be the "little boy" who
had loved Patience since childhood.
Grosvenor has also become a poet,
and so absolutely perfect that in 1
loving him Patience feels that she
is wholly selfish. He thinks so too, !
and since they believe that love
must be wholly unselfish, they
part.
Bunthorne again enters, and
upon the advice of his solicitor,:
puts himself up to lie rallied. Just
as Lady Jane is about to draw a
ticket, Patience appears and an
nounces her readiness to marry j
Bunthorne, for to love such a man
is pure unselfishness. The girls!
then turn to the Dragoons and re
nounce their allegience to Bun
thorne. At this juncture, Grosve
nor, an aesthetic poet, appears, and j
the girls all fall in love with him,
to the great indignation of Bun
thorne and the Dragoons. Finally
Bunthorne, seeing there is no hope
for him unless he follows Grosve- j
nor's example, becomes an idyllic
poet also. Grosvenor at last re
forms, becomes a "commonplace
young man," wins Patience, and
Bunthorne has to accept Lady
Jane, in case he has a bride at all.
The Duke, however, suprises Bun
thorne, and himself chooses Lady
Jane. The maidens pair off with
the Dragoons and nobody is Bun- i

Miss E. J. Brown, '04, will take
the title role of Patience. Her
voice is fully equal to the demands
for range and power which the role
requires, and her acting is spirited
and natural. Miss E. R. Miller,
'06, as Lady Angela; Miss A. S.

Hayes, '06, as Lady Ella; and Mies
E. A. Say re, '05, as Lady Saphir,
brilliantly take the leading parts
in the action, and are well sup
ported by the chorus of"twenty
love-sick maidens."
The parts of the two poets, Bun
thorne and Grosvenor, are well
acted by C. H. Baker, '04, and E.
R. May, '06, reppecti velv. The
versatile part of Lady Jane, which
is taken by E. K. Wilson, '05, is
cleverly done and is a prominent
part in the action.
