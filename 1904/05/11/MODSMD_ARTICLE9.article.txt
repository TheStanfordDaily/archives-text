The article by a member of the
Stanford Law faculty, which ap
pears in another column of this
paper, deserves the especial atten
tion of every member of the stu
dent body. In a clear and instruc
tive manner the article shows that
there is no legal right existing
whereby a student may sell to suc
ceeding classes notes that he has
taken on a course of lectures. The
writer of the article considers not
only the legal side, but very prop
erly and forcibly brings out the
wrongs that such a practice works
upon the University and upon the
individual student. At Stanford
it can be safely said that any abuse
of this nature has never become!
general, and it is to be doubted If
there has been more than ;# single
instance where the sale of notes has]
been attempted; Yet there has re
cently been one such attempt, and
it is now that the student body
should rise up against any further
practice of this kind. In some
Eastern universities a serious prob
lem has grown out of the sale of
lecture notes. That Stanford may
be free from any similar problem,
the practice must be put down at
the start. An alert exertion of the
present sound sentiment of the stu
dent body will alone forestall any
detrimental practice of this nature.]
