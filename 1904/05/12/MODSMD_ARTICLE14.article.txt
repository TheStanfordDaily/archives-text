# Boating Club Meets.
## 
### 
The Boating Club held its last
meeting for the semester on the
quad at 1:30 this afternoon, and
elected officers for the ensuing vear.
H. G. Butterfield, '04, who pulled
a strong oar on the Varsity in the
regatta with California, was elected
president; and Dr. Frank Angell
was chosen treasurer-manager, to
succeed Prof. A. W. Smith. Owing
to Professor Smith's "loss, it will be
necessary next year to secure the
services of a regular coach. Pro
fessor Smith will endeavor to get
a Cornell man to come to the
Coast, but in case he is unsuccess
ful in this, Professor S. S. Seward
Jr., of the English department,
will in all probability act as coach.
