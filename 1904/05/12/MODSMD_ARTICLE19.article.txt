# "DAILY PALO ALTO" FINANCES
## Statement for the Year 1902-03 Shows Profits of Seven Hundred Dollars. 
### 
'At last night's meeting of the
Executive Committee the report of
J. A. Quelle, business manager of
the Daily Palo Alto, for the col
lege year 1902-03 was submitted
by the auditing committee. The
lateness of the report is explained
by the fact that the collections on
advertisements and subscriptions
have been running along during
the past year, and, in fact, have
not yet all been made. The report
shows that the net profits of the
eight and one-half months of its
publication were $724.82. Accord
ing to the terms of the constitution,
the business manager and editor
are entitled to profits up to $100 a
month, so that the student body
would not begin to receive its fifty
per cent until $850 had been
earned. If the debts outstanding,
amounting to $270 80, could be col
lected there would be a surplus,
but many of them are of little or
no value.
The auditing committee reported
that many subscription payments
for the closing year had been made
as a result of the recent action of
the Executive Committee in caus
ing special notices to be sent to the
delinquents. On Saturday, May
14th, the time limit set by the
Executive Committee will expire,
and the names of all those who
have then failed to pay will be
submitted to the faculty committee
on student affairs.
The report of Business Manager
Quelle is as follows:
The receipts and expenditures
for the college year 1902-03 were
as follows:
Total receipts $4,014 67
Total expenditures 3,289 85
Total gain $724 82
Paid editors 415 05
Balance, to manager $309 77
In addition there is still out
standing $270 80, of which some
part may possibly be collected.
