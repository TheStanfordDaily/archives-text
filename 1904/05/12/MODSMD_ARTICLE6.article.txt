# PLANS FOR TRACK MEN'S TRIP.
## Athletes Will Leave for Chicago on May 21st.â€”Large Amount Yet to Be Raised. 
### 
The last, regular meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Associ
ated Students was held last night.
The principal business was a dis
cussion of the arrangements made
for sending the selected track team
to Chicago to take part in the
Western Intercollegiate Field-day
on Marshall Field. Treasurer-elect
Barrett, who has the collections and
other arrangements in charge, re
ported that lie had on hand $950
in cash or its equivalent, compris
ing the contributions of students
and business men and the appro
priations of the Associated Students
and the Junior Class. This left a
substantial sum yet to be raised,
but Barrett reported that he believ
ed all would be secured in time.
An excursion granted by the rail
road up to May 13th has been ex
tended to May 21st for the benefit
of the team. The men will there
fore leave on the 21st for Chicago,
and will complete their training
there. This will permit them to
get acclimated and to recover from
the bad effects of the long railway
trip. They will travel over the
Union Pacific route.
Barrett today received a letter
from J. F. English, '01, president
of the Stanford Club of San Fran
cisco, in which the latter states
that he has already raised $125
among the alumni of San Francisco
and expects to raise the amount to
the $200 promised. He is making
an effort to reach all the old Stan
ford men in and about the city.
A letter from Trainer Moulton to
Dr. F. Angell, chairman of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, was
submitted to the Executive Com
mittee. Moulton wrote that he
would be glad to seek a release
from his present contract as ath
letic trainer at Willamette Uni
versity if it was thought that his
services would be of any value to
the track men. lie said that if the
men were in their best condition
on the day of the meet they had a
very good chance of taking third
or even second place. First place
he conceded to Michigan. The Ex
ecutive Committee decided toadvise
Moulton that under the circum
stances it did not believe .it neces
sary or advisable for him to come.
The track team will be here but a
few days more, and most of them
are veterans who will observe strict
training of their own accord. The
main obstacle to sending the train
er with the men to Chicago is the
lack of the necessary money.
Treasurer-elect Barrett's bond
was accepted by the Executive
Committee. The bond is for $5000,
the security being a trust company.
A special meeting of the Executive
Committee has been called for Wed
nesday, May 18th, at 7, when the
bonds of the managers of the stu
dent publications will be submitted
and acted upon. During the week
the auditing committee of the Ex
ecutive Committee will go over the
accounts of Treasurer Cowden, and
at the special meeting Wednesday
the retiring treasurer will be re
leased from his bond.
