Except for the special Com
mencement edition, this is the last
issue of the Daily Palo Alto for
the semester. Whether the paper
has retrograded or progressed is a
question that can he answered only
by its readers. While the editors
are not satisfied with their work
and can realize as perhaps can no
one else its shortcomings, neverthe
less they are satisfied with the
motives which have directed the
course of the paper. The aim has
been two-fold—to cover the news
field of the University, and to
represent editorially the thought of
a majority of its students. What
ever of success the paper has
accomplished in its first aim has
been due to the generous and faith
ful work of a board limited numer
ically but boundless in its unselfish
devotion to the interests of the
paper. The second aim has natur
ally been most difficult of attain
ment; but whenever possible the
editor has not relied too materiiilly
upon his own judgment, but has
sought the advice and counsel of
the thinking men of the University,
so that the paper should not be a
"one man" affair, but should, as
intended in its founding, reflect the
opinion of a majority of the student
body. Two innovations of the past |
year have become firmly estab-1
lished as the future policy of the!
Daily Palo Alto —the limitation
placed upon the board of editors,
and the policy of excluding items
of minor importance from the news
columns unless these items are of
general interest. The board has
worked in close harmony during
the past year, and no editor has
tried an innovation unless by the
sanction of the present board he
could be assured that its life would
be more than ephemeral. It is
with the feeling that the paper will
continue along its present lines
and will grow, improve, and de
velop in the hands of the next
man to be in charge that alone
compensates the editor for laying

aside what has been a thoroughly
enjoyable task. The future success
of the Daily Palo Alto is assured
as long as it remains in charge of
BUch men as will constitute the
bond of editors during the ap
proaching semester.
