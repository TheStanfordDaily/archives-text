The Opportunity of a Lifetime
Evergreen park \ s located within one block of
4 Mayfield railway station. This V>eautiful tract of
land has just been purchased and subdivided. The
Leland Stanford Junior University ground adjoins
11 iis property on two sides. The main street of Mayfield,
or county road, borders it on one side. The Southern Pa
cific railway is on the other. The property extends into
the business portion of Mayfield. The magnificent uni
versity buildings are close by and within plain sight of
these lots ; in fact the center of the tract on
the county road is nearer in a direct line to the university
buildings than is the railway station at l'alo Alto. The
foothills and mountains offer a charming view. The cli
mate is pronounced by all to be everything that could be
desired.
City water will be piped over this tract; in fact, the
main ten-inch artery runs along one of our streets, and
laterals will be run out through other streets from this main
pipe. A splendid, wide boulevard will run from the coun
ty road to and through the evergreen grove, and from there
to the depot. Cement sidewalk and cement curbing will
be placed in front of each lot without cost to the purchaser.
Klectric light and telephone conveniences are already on
the ground. The park, covered with large, evergreen
trees, -nine of them nearly a hundred feet high, is a
charming place, and appreciated by all. No other
ground can he purchased and subdivided that is as
near the university buildings as this tract. This is
the best opportunity vnu will ever have to purchase lots
at first cost. These lots will be placed on the market at
very reasonable prices and sold on small monthly pay
ments, <>r for cash, as the purchaser may desire. There
will be building restrictions, and the prohibition of the sale
of intoxicating liquors, incorporated in each contract and
deed. This will be a high-class residence district. It is
absolutely clean at this time, and will be so maintained.
The above picture shows a bird's-eye view of Ever
green Park, a part of Mayfield. a part of Palo Alto, the
university grounds and university buildings, and the
mountains in the background.
If you are a citizen of the State of ('alifornia, this is
your opportunity to personally inspect property that is
undoubtedly the very best property that will ever be placed
on the market near the Leland Stanford Junior 1 Diversity.
If you are not a citizen of Palo Alto, or of the State, if
you ever expect to locate in California, this is your
opportunity to purchase a lot in the very best locality,
with the very best surroundings and influences, that you
will ever have. I>o not wait, as prices will be much
higher. It is our purpose to revise prices from time to
time. The early purchasers will receive the advantage.
We operate in Ranch Property, Business Property,
in City, Town and Country Property throughout
the State. Our motto is, "California our Field; the
World for Buyers." Our purpose is to have the Buy
er and the Seller Meet. If you wish fo sell property,
or desire to purchase property, it will be for your interest
to see what we have t<> otter before investing elsewhere.

be placed in front of each lot without cost to the purchaser.
Klectric light and telephone conveniences are already on
the ground. The park, covered with large, evergreen
trees, -nine of them nearly a hundred feet high, is a
charming place, and appreciated by all. No other

the best opportunity vnu will ever have to purchase lots

very reasonable prices and sold on small monthly pay

The Opportunity of a Lifetime
Evergreen park \ s located within one block of
4 Mayfield railway station. This V>eautiful tract of
land has just been purchased and subdivided. The
Leland Stanford Junior University ground adjoins
11 iis property on two sides. The main street of Mayfield,
or county road, borders it on one side. The Southern Pa
cific railway is on the other. The property extends into
the business portion of Mayfield. The magnificent uni
versity buildings are close by and within plain sight of
these lots ; in fact the center of the tract on
the county road is nearer in a direct line to the university
buildings than is the railway station at l'alo Alto. The
foothills and mountains offer a charming view. The cli
mate is pronounced by all to be everything that could be
desired.
City water will be piped over this tract; in fact, the
main ten-inch artery runs along one of our streets, and
laterals will be run out through other streets from this main
pipe. A splendid, wide boulevard will run from the coun
ty road to and through the evergreen grove, and from there
to the depot. Cement sidewalk and cement curbing will
be placed in front of each lot without cost to the purchaser.
Klectric light and telephone conveniences are already on
the ground. The park, covered with large, evergreen
trees, -nine of them nearly a hundred feet high, is a
charming place, and appreciated by all. No other
