# ADDRESS BY DR. JORDAN.
## "The College Man in American Life," Delivered to the Graduating Class on Commencement Day. 
### 
This diploma of the University
is now in your hands at last. It
grants you all the powers and
privileges which any diploma ever
gave —those which you have al
ready. It certifies that you are
youth of promise, college men and
women, ready for life, — the life
which each of you is best fitted to
live.
I had occasion not long ago to
say that the future of our country
lies in the hands of three classes of
men —young men, strenuous men,
and college men. These consti
tute our first, our second,
and our third estate, as they
used to say in France, but
with this difference —which is all
the difference in the world —that
all three form but one class. The
future of America lies in the hands
of her young, strong college men.
It lies in the hands of her young
men because they are men of the
future, because they can do things,
because the light of the new cen
tury is i.i their eyes, because the
aspirations of the new century fill
their hearts, because the winds of
freedom were blowing where they
were born and reared. Not that
they will be the oflice-holders of the
country, although some of them
will become such; not that they
will have a clean sweep at the polls
or a sure thing at conventions,
though some of them may have this;
not that they will carry the mails
or hold the post-oflices, or go as
consuls to Zanzibar, or command
the fleets, or be deputy sheriffs, or
do anything else which draws the
eyes of the multitude. Such posi
tions belong to service, not to lead
ership, —though service and leader
ship are never far apart in the
affairs of the republic. He is the
leader who can forecast the future
and is not afraid to trust it, who
understands men and can bring out
the best they have in them, who
can make his country respected be
cauee he can help to hold her just
and true and thus worthy of re
spect, who can stand with the
party if need be, but who can in
equal need force the party to stand
with him. It is one hope of
democracy that a man's influence
is not shown by the oflice he holds,
but by the service he renders. If
the service be moral and intellect
ual, so much more does it count.
Because action which counts
rests on right and conscience, and
there is nothing enduring which is
not wrought by good men —because
of the great deeds to be done by a
nation of free men —our young men
shall see visions, like those of the
prophet Jonah, and these visions
they shall live to make realities.
Because you are young men and
strong, you shall be wanted for the
life of action. Because you have
been trained in mind and in morals,
because you have a scholar's hori
zon, because above all you have a
sense of solidarity, because, in
short, you are college men, you
will find yourselves devoted to the
noblest of missionary work —the
service of a free people.
You will find everywhere about
you evidences of all this. A typi
cal college man is President of
the United States; typical college
men comprise his cabinet; typical
college men hold positions of trust

in every quarter. Harvard men,
with the clown (-till on their cheeks,
Yale men, Princeton men, Cornell
men, California men, Stanford
men —young, strong, and skilled in
team work—are directing mines,
are holding courts, are filling pro
fessorships, are managing news
papers, are ministers to churches,
are in positions everywhere which
direct popular thought and control
public action. Stanford is very
young, with very few alumni, — not
one apiece for each of the many
cities of the United States —yet
every city which I visit, East or
West, North or South, seems to
have plenty of them —one, ten,
twenty, fifty maybe—each one the
center of the Stanford spirit, the

spirit of team work, which we
claim as our own. It is indeed our
own, our revised version, our
Stanford version, of the true
American spirit, the spirit of him
to whom "America means oppor
tunity," the opportunity to act and
to help and to stand together while j
we do it.
A college education means much
more than intellectual awakening,
much more than mental discipline.
It means the capacity for team
work in the higher affairs of life.
It means the ability to act together.
It means the generalship of sym
pathy, the power to know men and
to assign to each the work he can
do best and most loyally. It is this
trait of college men, the social
trait, the moral trait of loyal soli
darity, which most appeals to the
world. It is this which gives the
advantage to the college-bred men
as compared with other men who
may have equal native ability, |
equal skill, or equivalent experi-j
ence.
In considering the future of our
country, her power to weather
storms or to Folve problems, her
ability to cut the Gordian knots of
tangling tyrannies, we can not lay j
too much stress on the part the col-1
lege man shall take. He is ever}'-!

where. He is self-confident, reso
lute, kindly, joyous, tremendous,
and irresistible. When need arises,
he and his kind will stand together.
1 here is a freemasonry among
them beyond any grip or sign or
magic password. They know how
to help each other out, and they
will do it. In face of the careless,
jesting earnestness, the terrible,
jovial, conscientiousness of the col
lege man, tyranny and superstition
can not stand. Thefe have their
foundations in ignorance and dull
ness. The man who knows and is
not afraid to do, with the free help
of hundreds of his own kind, will
prevail against disorganized stu
pidity. The college is no longer
an ascetic resort, a dim cell where
men play with their higher feelings
because there are no other toys
within their reach. It is a little
world in itself, a world of open air
with a little of all the great world
has to offer, the same rewards, the
same punishments, with a feeling
of brotherhood, of loyalty, of team

service which shall be as power
ful in the great world as in the
small.
You men and women of Stanford
have passed through these lesser
experiences. We now commend
you to the greater. You have ful
filled all our requirements, met all
our petty exactions, carried all the
burdens we have for four years
scrupulously weighed and meas
ured and laid upon your backs.
You have shown yourselves youth
of promise—young, strong, loyal
college men and women. Our na
tion is waiting for you outside the
campus gate. To our nation we
commend you in fullest hope and
confidence. We shall know a Stan
ford man in the life of him that
overcometh, of him who stands for
truth and justice, who never loses
his hope or his temper, and who is
never ashamed or afraid.
