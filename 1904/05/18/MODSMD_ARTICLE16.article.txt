Daniel A. Goodsell preached a pow

class. At 4 in the afternoon Cecil
M. Marrack, '01, delivered the Le
land Stanford Junior memorial

Baccalaureate Sermon.
Bishop Goodsell took as his text
the eleventh verse of the thirteenth
chapter of the First Corinthians:
"When I was a child, I spake as a
child, I thought as a child, I un
derstood as a child; but when 1
became a man 1 put away childish
things."
He said in part: "The ability to
put truth into a truer and perma
nent form is a mark of genius. No
one, except the Lord Jesus himself,
had the genius for putting thought
into one word, as the writer of these
words. A man who can condense
thoughts into a sentence that shall
be, in weight and importance, like
a shot from a great gun, ban the
right to be called a genius. Paul,
in this verse, put a truth in a
memorable way. lie was trying
to find out what charity is, like a
wise chemist, by first finding out
what it is not.
"These words of Paul have an
all-important message to us, and
especially to those who are about to
leave this University to begin their
life's work. He who is without
high motive, without the inspiring
help of God, who walks in the way
of sin, will never attain the stature
which God intended. To use
phraseology common today, he will
never grow up. The Bible pours
contempt upon childishness, but not
childlikeness. Only to him who
has the spirit of the child will the
gates be opened. We are taught
by Christ Jesus that we are to
carry into our manhood some of
the beautiful characteristics of
childhood. No truer or more val
uable message can come to a soul
than the thought that he who is a
child must be borne forth through
childishness to have at all the pos
sibilities of growth.
"The child is busy with little
things. He sees the flash of the
flame and would put forth his hand
to take it. Later on he passes to
larger things. He sees the light
ning flash, but he asks whence it
conies. Passing from external to
internal things, he comes from
childhood to maturity; he is no
longer a babe, but a man.
"Consider how our Master has
described childlikeness, and that be
who has not these qualities will
not have power in the life that, is.
The child lives in a world that is
making history. The child is grow
ing under these living forces, but
what does he know of them ? He
comes from childhood to maturity
by seeing the significance of these
things. The child will try to em
ploy great forces, without knowing
itheir importance. Unless we have
the right motive, we will not know
how to direct these great forces.
"The child is careless of the
value of time. Days come, and
days go unregarded. The child is
so moved by the instincts of his
lower nature that he does not heed

the hours. Lessons are not learned;
habits of industry are not formed;
and when he comes to manhood he
sees himself passed hy others who
have a better sense of the value of
time.
"These three lessons of childhood
are to be learned, especially by
those who are about to leave here.
When we see men passing through
life without raising their thoughts
on high, without learning the great
things of nature, what can we say
except that they are like the child
who knows not the importance of
single acts ?"
The speaker dwelt on the glories
of the heavens, the wonderful forces
implied by the relations of the
heavenly bodies. This earth of
ours, through ages of erosion and
transformation, has become a hab
itable place for man. Even the
very dust of the field plays its
part in the interrelation of all
things. The Bishop continued:
"Now think of a life so intoxi
cated with thoughts of wealth and
other selfish things that none, or
only a few, of these great truths
are seen. We, who are- here this
morning, are soon to have this
question put before us —whether our
life is to be a life of growth, a life
of stationary existence, or a life of
decay. We cannot, by the nature
of life, remain stationary. We must
either be in the process of growth
or of decay; we must be filled with
the energy of God, or must pass
into a state of mental death.
"The man of the future is to be
greater than the man of the past;
we who are the men of today may
be the children of tomorrow. If
the men in power forty years ago
were resurrected they would be
startled by what are matters of fact
today. The larger man is yet to
be born; the final man no one can
foretell, lie who does not place
himself in touch with the truths of
God will never attain the maturity
of which the Apostle Paul speaks."
Memorial Address.
At the afternoon service C. M.
Mar rack said:
"The most precious thing in
human life is personality. It is by
this we know our friends, and for

this we
love them.
I n the
same way,
a univer
sity must
have per
sonality
else it can
n o t be
great. A
university
is an ag
g re gat ion
of profes
sorships,

departments, buildings,books, sem
inaries, and laboratories. But it is
more than this—without these the
university could not live,but by these
one university would notdiffer from
another. It is not for these things
all have in common that we know
universities. Just as with men, it
is the subtle element of personali
ty. The Harvard spirit, the Cornell
spirit, the Yale spirit, the spirit of
California, the spirit of Stanford—

all these are matters as real as the
buildings or the books, and more
important. For the most valuable
feature of a university is its char
acter, the nature of its atmosphere
—its personality.
"Today we speak of the person
ality of our University, and it is
something very real and influential.
In a dozen years it has sprung
forth, and, whatever it is, by it
shall Leland Stanford Jr. be le
membered. From him as its centre
has the personality of this Univer
sity developed. Every energy of
its founders has been devoted to the
task of interpreting into splendid
realities their first great memorial
conception. And they have suc
ceeded, for the name of Leland
Stanford Jr. is forever insepar
ably associated with this institu
tion. To the world at large, and
even more truly to those who have
come within her walls, this Univer
sity—our University, embodies
what we know and love in Leland
Stanford Jr. W r e knew him
not, on that day when the mother's
heart first grieved at parting, but
now we know him well, and love
him truly, as we know and love our
own University.
"And if this thought be true, that
I have tried so feebly to express —
if it be true that in this University
there is embodied a corporate per
sonality — a spirit which, in its in
fluence on the world, is, at every
point, a living memorial of Leland
Stanford Jr. —it should be to us
a source of splendid inspiration.
For think, the vital element, the
element which determines whether
the personality of Stanford Univer
j sity is to be a mean or a noble per-
I sonality, is your personal influence,
j Students, alumni, faculty, trustees,
president most of all, as interpret
ing the spirit of the founders—all
are contributing to the corporate
personality. Oh, how this dignifies
every thought and every act of
every Stanford man and woman.
And here, as always, with great
dignity there goes a great respons
ibility.
"And to us all, as a precious jewel
with its shining surfaces, this truth
presents different aspects of dignity
and responsibility. As coming with
in my own experience, I may ven
ture in a few words to interpret its
meaning to the student and to the
alumnus. For the undergraduate
l there is a growing appreciation of
j his privilege. He comes at once,
! and at a period of life when he is
i most sensitive to impressions, into
direct contact with the Stanford
; personality.
"Then begin the countless proces
! ses of growth. Fellow students, pro
fessors, president —each element in
1 the complex college life plays upon
' and moulds his character. Not all
'at oncc is he made over into a
worthy Stanford man. He may
have started handicapped, and 'no
J man can learn what he has not
I preparation for learning, however
S near to his eyes is the object,
i God screens us evermore from
' premature ideas. Our eyes are
holden that we cannot see things
that stare us in the face until the
hour arrives when the mind is rip
ened. Then we behold them, and
the time when we saw them not is
like a dream.'
"The student scarcely notices the
change, so subtle are tlie processes
of growth, until perhaps, in the re
trospective glances of commence
-1 ment week, there flashes upon him a
vision of the freshman that he was
|— and then in all humility there
'dawns upon him too the full reali

zation of the dignity and privilege
of college life.
"Not till afterwards perhaps does
there come the knowledge of the
responsibility that rested upon him
as an undergraduate. Hut it should
have come before, and been a stim
ulus to noble effort.
"Students ofStanford University,
your character is being moulded,
but it is not passive. You are af
fecting those about you. You are
influencing those who will come to
take your place, for you are helping
to create a sentiment that will live
when yo"u are gone. In years to
come there will be freshmen whoee
standards of conduct will be raised
(or lowered) in conformity with
the college spirit which you have
helped to create. Within these
sacred walls, and in the classrooms,
and beneath the arches of the quad,
there lingers now the subtle senti
ment of student generations—the
atmosphere of a corporate, a com
posite personality—the Stanford
spirit.
"And the alumnus finds quite
soon, that Commencement is, in
truth, only the beginning of new
dignity and new responsibility. Go
where he will, he cannot shake off,
if he would, his high distinction.
Always and everywhere, he is a
Stanford man. Always and every
where, men and women estimate
his every word and action as an ex
pression of the Stanford personality.
And they are right, for wherever,
within the breast of man or
woman there beats a loyal Stanford
heart, there lives the Stanford per
sonality— there Leland Stanford Jr.
is commemorated in every word
and act.
"In estimating the forces wh'ih
determine the nature of the Stan
ford spirit, we cannot exaggerate
the influence of this matchless edi
fice. The memory of that unique
service three years ago to which I
at first alluded, brings up a picture
of the Assembly Hall, beautifully
adorned it is true, but lacking the
distinctive religious associations of
this Memorial Church. The Stan
ford spirit must be a religious
spirit."
