The annual Senior-Faculty base
ball game was played on the cun
pus diamond from 10:30 until 1
Saturday. The remarkably large
number of runs made during the
game gave the victory to the Sen- i
iors by the score of 20 to 19. The
faculty nine on the whole played'
the better ball. McPhail, the Sen
ior pitcher, proved an easy man
for the instructing force, who landed
on his delivery repeadlyfor one-,
two-, and three-base hits. The
runs piled up for the Faculty until
the eighth inning, and then the
tide changed. Dr. Whitaker was
relieved in the pitcher's box by Prof.
J. C. L. Fish. The fielding of the
professors weakened, and the Sen
iors began to score when it was
apparently too late. But the '04
score continued to grow until ten
runs had been made in one inning.
Then the Faculty came to the bat
for the last time and were put out
in close order, thereby losing a
game that they should have won.
The line-up of the team was as
follows:
FACULTY SENIORS
Whitaker (
Fish j • P McPhail
Blair c Hamilton
Jordan 1 b Brua
Angell 2 b Knight
Newson es Frink
Fish 3 b McNeil
