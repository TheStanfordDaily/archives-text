# The
						Senior Ball.

### 
The Senior Ball, held at the Ven
dome Hotel in San Jose Monday
night, proved to be the most suc
cessful social function of the year.

A large attendance was present,
and all who were there had a
thoroughly enjoyable evening. The
dancing hall was profusely decor
ated with ferns and flowers, and
the music was all that could be
desired. The idea of serving re
freshments on the train while re
turning home was carried out very
well.
