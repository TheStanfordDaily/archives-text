# EVENTS OF CLASS DAY.
## The 						Forenoon Taken Up With Customary Exercises in Chapel, and Laying of Plate. Senior Ball in the Evening. 
### 
The festivities of Senior Week
were formally opened by the Class
Day exercises, which were held in the
chapel Monday morning, May 16th.
The entire class, together with sev
eral hundred friends, listened with
interest to the address of the class
president, the history, and the will.
Following the exercises in the chapel
the laying of the class plate, with the
customary ceremonies, took place in
the arcade in front of Memorial
Church.
Address of Welcome.
E. G. Brua, president of the class,
opened the exercises in the chapel at
10:30 with the following words:
"On behalf of the graduating
class of 1904 I extend to each of you
a most cordial welcome to our Senior

Week exercises.
It is our wish to
make this week
one of the bright
spots in the lives
of all those in at
tendance.
"It is with a mix
ture of feelings that
we watch the ap
proach of the event

which marks the end of our college
days. Of these the thought of grati
tude is uppermost in our minds.
Gratitude first of all toward those who
have founded this great institution of
learning—an expression of parental
love —who have thus made it pos
sible for us to realize our ambitions
in the acquirement of a university
training. Our appreciation can only
be felt within ourselves. It can not
be expressed in words.
"Then we are indeed grateful to
the Faculty and other officers of the
University for their kindly attentions
toward us. We have been fortunate
in that most of the classes have been
small, thus permitting a personal
acquaintance with our instructors.
We cannot but feel that much of the
benefit which we have received while
here has come from this personal
contact with the members of the
Faculty. We owe them a debt
which we can only repay by proving
ourselves worthy in the years to
come.
"I desire to thank most heartily
those who have assisted in making
our Senior Week a success.
"Then there is a sense of freedom
among us. We are glad to have

finished the college
course and to be
ready to enter upon
our life's work.
The new life will
be one of responsi
bility. We will
have the good
name of the Uni
versity in our keep
ing wherever we
may go. We must

remember that the world will judge
Stanford by out lives and by our
works.
" There is also a feeling of sorrow
that we as a class are soon to leave

Stanford. Within the next few days
we must say goodbye to our pro
fessors and our fellow students. We
will bid farewell to the old familiar
places, to the quad, the laboratories
and classrooms, to the lake, the
arboretum. j ■
"It is claimed by some that the
Stanford spirit was dead four years
;jgo. If that be true there has been
a wonderful awakening. It is a
pleasant thought to us that perhaps
we as a class have had some part in
this good work. We have a feeling
of pride for the class of Naught-four.
We fully recognize the qualities of
classes which have gone before, but
it is no more than natural that we |
should be proud of the reputation
which 'Naughty-four' has won.
History of '04 Class.
The history of the graduating class
was read by Miss Marie S. Burnham,
class historian. In part it was as
follows:
Nine years of Stanford history
were complete before the Class of

1904 came in past
thesphinxes. Since
that time it has
been our privilege
to contribute some
part to four years
more of it. Makers
of history form it,
all unaware, for
the most part, that
their deeds are to
be recorded and

live after them. But we, of these
early classes, who have shared
in the growth and development of
our University, have felt the respon
sibility of establishing her precedents
worthily, and of living for those who
shall come after us, down through
the ages.
Aware,apparently, that events worth
discussion were about to occur, our
earliest activity was in debating. We
organized a class society in our first
semester; in our second, we, repre
sented by Spencer, Roehr, and
Wood,defeated the Sophomore team.
During our second year we invaded
the literary societies—Euphronia,
Nestoria, Philolexian—and gradually
we have made our way into their
controlling offices. In 1903 the
ninth Carnot team was composed of
three members of this class which is
now about to graduate; this year we
held two places. Finally, last year,
as a fitting reward for faithful endeav
or, a trio of'o4 men had the pleasure
of defeating Berkeley in the Intercol
legiate debate; while this year in the
eleventh Intercollegiate, the strongest
team that California has ever sent
j against Stanford was beaten by a
j team which contained two '04 men.
j What the present graduating class
has accomplished in debating is well
summed up in the names of Frank
Roehr, Howard M. Lewis, O. C.
Spencer, and (). H. Ritter.
The last four years of Stanford
; dramatics are alight with the stars
this class has set in that firmament;
the farce and comedy committees of

the future will look far for others of
their magnitude. When as venerable
alumni we happen in on student
plays of the future, we shall note the
leading ladies with equal scepticism;
will they compare with Misses Hale,
Kerr, and Jeraldine Brown ? Then,
too, so long as we recall Assembly
Hall, or the football bleachers, or
bring to mind the farces we have
here enjoyed, just so long we shall
remember Cleveland Baker, of the
class of nineteen-four; as "stuntist,"
as comic actor, as yell leader, and
merry voice in all good fellowship,
we count him back through the last
four years as part of our best history.
In the field of undergraduate liter
ature and art, this class has been

unusually far to the
fore. Unwilling to
wait our turn, we
seized two of the
publications as ear
ly as our Junior
year: then Wally
Young edited the
Sequoia, and Ike
Russell the Chap
arral. We have

kept our hold through the present
year. We have been at the head of
the Daily Palo Alto for the custo
mary two semesters. We have
ventured to occupy the editorship
of the Alumnus while we are
as yet undergraduates. O. A.
Wilson, A 1 Hampson, and Fred
Powell, are names to remind us what
has been our ability in newspaper
work. Ike Russell represents our
originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any

Writer of the W ill
ill-gotten hours to the generations
that come after them.
The Class of 1903 we thank for its
gift to us of that brilliant collection of
Stanford stars —Ball, Baker, Perrin,
Dehy, Beach, and Norman Dole,
all whom we have been proud of as
our adopted children, and who have
added much to our prestige and their
glory while in our midst. As a
memorial to their works we do dedi
cate and bequeath unto the Class of
1905, these men, viz : Lanagan,
Hampson, F. H. Fowler, Hunter,
Bansbach, Wilson, Henley, and Gay,
regretting to leave them behind, but
doing so strong in the assurance that
they will prove as great a boon to
'05 as our inheritance from '03 has
proven to us.
We dedicate the football suits, the
track shoes, the baseball caps, the
editorial pen, and the purse strings of
Bansbach, Holman, Ball, Hampson,
and Cowden to their successors in
Stanford life—George Clark, Harry
Bell, A. L. Trowbridge, Ben Dey,
and Richard Barrett —assuring these
incoming men that they will find in
the work of Bansbach, Holman, Ball,
Hampson, and Cowden an example
of good government, faithful service,
and unostentatious attention to busi
ness that all may well emulate but
few excel.
To Norman Dole we offer our love
in 110 spirit of mere formality, assur
ing him that could he vault as high
over the wooden cross-bar as he has
vaulted into our hearts, he would
make the world's record a bigger
Stanford cinch than Greek pipology.
To Holman, Hyde, Dole, Bell,
West, Lanagan, Beach, and Dunn,
who will carry the Cardinal banner on
the fields of Chicago, we wish a
pleasant journey and a safe return to
the land of the Red Tile rich laden
in eastern booty.
To Lousley and Campbell we be
queath all the wire, bent and unbent,
that may be by them found in the
scrap-heap of ancient politics.
To Charles Firebaugh we dedicate
the opera Patience, confident that as
the lovely Dudley would say, it has
for him a motto well worth following.
To Arthur Cooley and Archibald
Fay we dedicate the Delta Gamma
lawn to be held as a stamping-ground
for whatever time they can spare
from the Alpha Phi premises.
The new tennis courts we dedicate
to George Hodge, whose plucky play
ing makes us hopeful for the future
of Stanford tennis. For these same
courts we thank Frank Leib, who
more than any other one man is re
sponsible for their being here.
To Professor Albert W. Smith
we bequeath a return-trip ticket from
Cornell to Stanford University and a
most hearty welcome should he ever
decide to use it.
To Miss Alice Kimball we dedi
cate the task of keeping us in touch
with one another during our journey
down the four wide ways of the world.
To Stanford women we commend her
record as an example of that unob
trusive, loyal interest in the Univer
sity which makes for the ideal of
what a Stanford woman should be.
To each one of us here assembled
the Class wishes a prosperous life filled
with memories of the Quad, and of
the Stock Farm, the Arboretum, and
Lagunita, Frenchman's Lake, the
tables of Mayfield, King's Mountain,
and Cooley's Landing, and even the
recitations which helped us to get in
the ten hours of sleep required daily
during the four years we have been
guests within the portals of our Alma
Mater.
And now endeth this last will and
testament, given on this sixteenth

day of" May, in the month of Brua,
in the first year of the reign of Roehr,
and of the reign of King David the
thirteenth.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises in
the chapel the class gathered in the
arcade in front of Memorial Church
to lay the '04 plate. President Brua
first introduced O. H. Ritter, the
class orator, who spoke as follows:
"This occasion is fraught with a
deeper meaning than appears at first
sight and with a greater significance
than the mere laying of a memorial
to the Class of 1904, for it is in these

characters that the
history of Stanford
University is to be
written, and these
numerals which we
are laying will be
the hieroglyphics
from which the fu
ture will decipher
the words success
or failure. And
whether it be suc-

cess or whether it be failure which
crowns the work of our Alma Mater
depends upon the success or the fail
ure in life of those whom she sends
forth. It is this occasion which
should bring vividly before us the
responsibility which rests upon us as
the latest addition to the ranks of the
alumni.
"It is but a few hours till we shall
receive the official seal of this Uni
versity announcing the completion of
our preparation and our readiness
for life's active struggles. This, per
haps our last official act as a class,
should cause us to reflect upon not
only our responsibility, but more
upon our duty. Our responsibility
is to keep unsullied the name of our
college, to safeguard and prove the
dignity of the Stanford degree. Our
duty is to show our appreciation of
the splendid endowment by aiming
to the utmost of our powers to live
up to our responsibilities.
"We muse realize that the fame
of the Stanford degree rests as much
upon those who receive the degree
as upon those who grant it. If those
who receive do not prove by their
successes the worth of their training,
the Stanford name will be stained
with failure. We who have received
the degree and accepted of what our
Alma Mater has to bestow, if we do
not become a success we shall not
have lived up to our responsibility,
and if we do not at least strive to
stand the test in the crucible of life
we shall be stamped as ingrates.
"We should be a success, then, in
order that our college may become
increasingly notable, for it is by our
triumphs in life's battles and by the
nobility of the ideals which we pur
sue that we shall attract the attention
of the world to the place whence we
received our training and shall draw
to Stanford the kind of men from
whom greater things may be expect
ed. These going forth into life and
sending to Stanford in increasing de
gree the finer elements of the nation
will make the work of our college
more and more famous.
" Further, this increasing dignity
and glory of the University adds to the
inlluence of its degree, and we, as
the recipients of the degree, shall
receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our
University fame and glory. May
this bronze of mystic import help the
future spell for our Alma Mater the
verdict of the world success
Reply by Dr. Jordan.
In accepting the plate in behalf of
the University, I)r. Jordan spoke of
the symbolism that the slab of brass
stood for. The American people, he
said, had been criticised -as always
active in pursuit of the "almighty
dollar." But no nation, he said, was
so full of ideals as they. In Europe
a man married for social advantage,
for money, for political advancement.
In America a man marries for love
alone.
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the love
of the undergraduate for his Alma
Mater, and especially for the small
institution. The strongest pledge of
the American institution for the
future, he said, lay in the fact that
there are always some who love it
when it is in its youth. We don't
always feel this spirit when we are
traveling around in our corduroys,
but it exists within us nevertheless.
This spirit, he said, had been con
spicuous at Stanford, and although
the institution was small, we could
look along and see a bright and
prosperous future.
The exercises closed with the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Mail" by the
assemblage.

The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any

Writer of the W ill
ill-gotten hours to the generations
that come after them.
The Class of 1903 we thank for its
gift to us of that brilliant collection of
Stanford stars —Ball, Baker, Perrin,
Dehy, Beach, and Norman Dole,
all whom we have been proud of as
our adopted children, and who have
added much to our prestige and their
glory while in our midst. As a
memorial to their works we do dedi
cate and bequeath unto the Class of
1905, these men, viz : Lanagan,
Hampson, F. H. Fowler, Hunter,
Bansbach, Wilson, Henley, and Gay,
regretting to leave them behind, but
doing so strong in the assurance that
they will prove as great a boon to
'05 as our inheritance from '03 has
proven to us.
We dedicate the football suits, the
track shoes, the baseball caps, the
editorial pen, and the purse strings of
Bansbach, Holman, Ball, Hampson,
and Cowden to their successors in
Stanford life—George Clark, Harry
Bell, A. L. Trowbridge, Ben Dey,
and Richard Barrett —assuring these
incoming men that they will find in
the work of Bansbach, Holman, Ball,
Hampson, and Cowden an example
of good government, faithful service,
and unostentatious attention to busi
ness that all may well emulate but
few excel.
To Norman Dole we offer our love
in 110 spirit of mere formality, assur
ing him that could he vault as high
over the wooden cross-bar as he has
vaulted into our hearts, he would
make the world's record a bigger
Stanford cinch than Greek pipology.
To Holman, Hyde, Dole, Bell,
West, Lanagan, Beach, and Dunn,
who will carry the Cardinal banner on
the fields of Chicago, we wish a
pleasant journey and a safe return to
the land of the Red Tile rich laden
in eastern booty.
To Lousley and Campbell we be
queath all the wire, bent and unbent,
that may be by them found in the
scrap-heap of ancient politics.
To Charles Firebaugh we dedicate
the opera Patience, confident that as
the lovely Dudley would say, it has
for him a motto well worth following.
To Arthur Cooley and Archibald
Fay we dedicate the Delta Gamma
lawn to be held as a stamping-ground
for whatever time they can spare
from the Alpha Phi premises.
The new tennis courts we dedicate
to George Hodge, whose plucky play
ing makes us hopeful for the future
of Stanford tennis. For these same
courts we thank Frank Leib, who
more than any other one man is re
sponsible for their being here.
To Professor Albert W. Smith
we bequeath a return-trip ticket from
Cornell to Stanford University and a
most hearty welcome should he ever
decide to use it.
To Miss Alice Kimball we dedi
cate the task of keeping us in touch
with one another during our journey
down the four wide ways of the world.
To Stanford women we commend her
record as an example of that unob
trusive, loyal interest in the Univer
sity which makes for the ideal of
what a Stanford woman should be.
To each one of us here assembled
the Class wishes a prosperous life filled
with memories of the Quad, and of
the Stock Farm, the Arboretum, and
Lagunita, Frenchman's Lake, the
tables of Mayfield, King's Mountain,
and Cooley's Landing, and even the
recitations which helped us to get in
the ten hours of sleep required daily
during the four years we have been
guests within the portals of our Alma
Mater.
And now endeth this last will and
testament, given on this sixteenth

day of" May, in the month of Brua,
in the first year of the reign of Roehr,
and of the reign of King David the
thirteenth.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises in
the chapel the class gathered in the
arcade in front of Memorial Church
to lay the '04 plate. President Brua
first introduced O. H. Ritter, the
class orator, who spoke as follows:
"This occasion is fraught with a
deeper meaning than appears at first
sight and with a greater significance
than the mere laying of a memorial
to the Class of 1904, for it is in these

characters that the
history of Stanford
University is to be
written, and these
numerals which we
are laying will be
the hieroglyphics
from which the fu
ture will decipher
the words success
or failure. And
whether it be suc-

cess or whether it be failure which
crowns the work of our Alma Mater
depends upon the success or the fail
ure in life of those whom she sends
forth. It is this occasion which
should bring vividly before us the
responsibility which rests upon us as
the latest addition to the ranks of the
alumni.
"It is but a few hours till we shall
receive the official seal of this Uni
versity announcing the completion of
our preparation and our readiness
for life's active struggles. This, per
haps our last official act as a class,
should cause us to reflect upon not
only our responsibility, but more
upon our duty. Our responsibility
is to keep unsullied the name of our
college, to safeguard and prove the
dignity of the Stanford degree. Our
duty is to show our appreciation of
the splendid endowment by aiming
to the utmost of our powers to live
up to our responsibilities.
"We muse realize that the fame
of the Stanford degree rests as much
upon those who receive the degree
as upon those who grant it. If those
who receive do not prove by their
successes the worth of their training,
the Stanford name will be stained
with failure. We who have received
the degree and accepted of what our
Alma Mater has to bestow, if we do
not become a success we shall not
have lived up to our responsibility,
and if we do not at least strive to
stand the test in the crucible of life
we shall be stamped as ingrates.
"We should be a success, then, in
order that our college may become
increasingly notable, for it is by our
triumphs in life's battles and by the
nobility of the ideals which we pur
sue that we shall attract the attention
of the world to the place whence we
received our training and shall draw
to Stanford the kind of men from
whom greater things may be expect
ed. These going forth into life and
sending to Stanford in increasing de
gree the finer elements of the nation
will make the work of our college
more and more famous.
" Further, this increasing dignity
and glory of the University adds to the
inlluence of its degree, and we, as
the recipients of the degree, shall
receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our
University fame and glory. May
this bronze of mystic import help the
future spell for our Alma Mater the
verdict of the world success
Reply by Dr. Jordan.
In accepting the plate in behalf of
the University, I)r. Jordan spoke of
the symbolism that the slab of brass
stood for. The American people, he
said, had been criticised -as always
active in pursuit of the "almighty
dollar." But no nation, he said, was
so full of ideals as they. In Europe
a man married for social advantage,
for money, for political advancement.
In America a man marries for love
alone.
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the love
of the undergraduate for his Alma
Mater, and especially for the small
institution. The strongest pledge of
the American institution for the
future, he said, lay in the fact that
there are always some who love it
when it is in its youth. We don't
always feel this spirit when we are
traveling around in our corduroys,
but it exists within us nevertheless.
This spirit, he said, had been con
spicuous at Stanford, and although
the institution was small, we could
look along and see a bright and
prosperous future.
The exercises closed with the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Mail" by the
assemblage.


O. H. Ritteu, Orator
The festivities of Senior Week
were formally opened by the Class
Day exercises, which were held in the
chapel Monday morning, May 16th.
The entire class, together with sev
eral hundred friends, listened with
interest to the address of the class
president, the history, and the will.
Following the exercises in the chapel
the laying of the class plate, with the
customary ceremonies, took place in
the arcade in front of Memorial
Church.
Address of Welcome.
E. G. Brua, president of the class,
opened the exercises in the chapel at
10:30 with the following words:
"On behalf of the graduating
class of 1904 I extend to each of you
a most cordial welcome to our Senior

Week exercises.
It is our wish to
make this week
one of the bright
spots in the lives
of all those in at
tendance.
"It is with a mix
ture of feelings that
we watch the ap
proach of the event

which marks the end of our college
days. Of these the thought of grati
tude is uppermost in our minds.
Gratitude first of all toward those who
have founded this great institution of
learning—an expression of parental
love —who have thus made it pos
sible for us to realize our ambitions
in the acquirement of a university
training. Our appreciation can only
be felt within ourselves. It can not
be expressed in words.
"Then we are indeed grateful to
the Faculty and other officers of the
University for their kindly attentions
toward us. We have been fortunate
in that most of the classes have been
small, thus permitting a personal
acquaintance with our instructors.
We cannot but feel that much of the
benefit which we have received while
here has come from this personal
contact with the members of the
Faculty. We owe them a debt
which we can only repay by proving
ourselves worthy in the years to
come.
"I desire to thank most heartily
those who have assisted in making
our Senior Week a success.
"Then there is a sense of freedom
among us. We are glad to have

finished the college
course and to be
ready to enter upon
our life's work.
The new life will
be one of responsi
bility. We will
have the good
name of the Uni
versity in our keep
ing wherever we
may go. We must

remember that the world will judge
Stanford by out lives and by our
works.
" There is also a feeling of sorrow
that we as a class are soon to leave

Stanford. Within the next few days
we must say goodbye to our pro
fessors and our fellow students. We
will bid farewell to the old familiar
places, to the quad, the laboratories
and classrooms, to the lake, the
arboretum. j ■
"It is claimed by some that the
Stanford spirit was dead four years
;jgo. If that be true there has been
a wonderful awakening. It is a
pleasant thought to us that perhaps
we as a class have had some part in
this good work. We have a feeling
of pride for the class of Naught-four.
We fully recognize the qualities of
classes which have gone before, but
it is no more than natural that we |
should be proud of the reputation
which 'Naughty-four' has won.
History of '04 Class.
The history of the graduating class
was read by Miss Marie S. Burnham,
class historian. In part it was as
follows:
Nine years of Stanford history
were complete before the Class of

1904 came in past
thesphinxes. Since
that time it has
been our privilege
to contribute some
part to four years
more of it. Makers
of history form it,
all unaware, for
the most part, that
their deeds are to
be recorded and

live after them. But we, of these
early classes, who have shared
in the growth and development of
our University, have felt the respon
sibility of establishing her precedents
worthily, and of living for those who
shall come after us, down through
the ages.
Aware,apparently, that events worth
discussion were about to occur, our
earliest activity was in debating. We
organized a class society in our first
semester; in our second, we, repre
sented by Spencer, Roehr, and
Wood,defeated the Sophomore team.
During our second year we invaded
the literary societies—Euphronia,
Nestoria, Philolexian—and gradually
we have made our way into their
controlling offices. In 1903 the
ninth Carnot team was composed of
three members of this class which is
now about to graduate; this year we
held two places. Finally, last year,
as a fitting reward for faithful endeav
or, a trio of'o4 men had the pleasure
of defeating Berkeley in the Intercol
legiate debate; while this year in the
eleventh Intercollegiate, the strongest
team that California has ever sent
j against Stanford was beaten by a
j team which contained two '04 men.
j What the present graduating class
has accomplished in debating is well
summed up in the names of Frank
Roehr, Howard M. Lewis, O. C.
Spencer, and (). H. Ritter.
The last four years of Stanford
; dramatics are alight with the stars
this class has set in that firmament;
the farce and comedy committees of

the future will look far for others of
their magnitude. When as venerable
alumni we happen in on student
plays of the future, we shall note the
leading ladies with equal scepticism;
will they compare with Misses Hale,
Kerr, and Jeraldine Brown ? Then,
too, so long as we recall Assembly
Hall, or the football bleachers, or
bring to mind the farces we have
here enjoyed, just so long we shall
remember Cleveland Baker, of the
class of nineteen-four; as "stuntist,"
as comic actor, as yell leader, and
merry voice in all good fellowship,
we count him back through the last
four years as part of our best history.
In the field of undergraduate liter
ature and art, this class has been

unusually far to the
fore. Unwilling to
wait our turn, we
seized two of the
publications as ear
ly as our Junior
year: then Wally
Young edited the
Sequoia, and Ike
Russell the Chap
arral. We have

kept our hold through the present
year. We have been at the head of
the Daily Palo Alto for the custo
mary two semesters. We have
ventured to occupy the editorship
of the Alumnus while we are
as yet undergraduates. O. A.
Wilson, A 1 Hampson, and Fred
Powell, are names to remind us what
has been our ability in newspaper
work. Ike Russell represents our
originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as

field-day, do hereby make, draw up,

bring together this last will and tes

Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of

note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,

Reply by Dr. Jordan.
In accepting the plate in behalf of
the University, I)r. Jordan spoke of
the symbolism that the slab of brass
stood for. The American people, he
said, had been criticised -as always
active in pursuit of the "almighty
dollar." But no nation, he said, was
so full of ideals as they. In Europe
a man married for social advantage,
for money, for political advancement.
In America a man marries for love
alone.
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the love
of the undergraduate for his Alma
Mater, and especially for the small
institution. The strongest pledge of
the American institution for the
future, he said, lay in the fact that
there are always some who love it
when it is in its youth. We don't
always feel this spirit when we are
traveling around in our corduroys,
but it exists within us nevertheless.
This spirit, he said, had been con
spicuous at Stanford, and although
the institution was small, we could
look along and see a bright and
prosperous future.
The exercises closed with the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Mail" by the
assemblage.


O. H. Ritteu, Orator
The festivities of Senior Week
were formally opened by the Class
Day exercises, which were held in the
chapel Monday morning, May 16th.
The entire class, together with sev
eral hundred friends, listened with
interest to the address of the class
president, the history, and the will.
Following the exercises in the chapel
the laying of the class plate, with the
customary ceremonies, took place in
the arcade in front of Memorial
Church.
Address of Welcome.
E. G. Brua, president of the class,
opened the exercises in the chapel at
10:30 with the following words:
"On behalf of the graduating
class of 1904 I extend to each of you
a most cordial welcome to our Senior

Week exercises.
It is our wish to
make this week
one of the bright
spots in the lives
of all those in at
tendance.
"It is with a mix
ture of feelings that
we watch the ap
proach of the event

which marks the end of our college
days. Of these the thought of grati
tude is uppermost in our minds.
Gratitude first of all toward those who
have founded this great institution of
learning—an expression of parental
love —who have thus made it pos
sible for us to realize our ambitions
in the acquirement of a university
training. Our appreciation can only
be felt within ourselves. It can not
be expressed in words.
"Then we are indeed grateful to
the Faculty and other officers of the
University for their kindly attentions
toward us. We have been fortunate
in that most of the classes have been
small, thus permitting a personal
acquaintance with our instructors.
We cannot but feel that much of the
benefit which we have received while
here has come from this personal
contact with the members of the
Faculty. We owe them a debt
which we can only repay by proving
ourselves worthy in the years to
come.
"I desire to thank most heartily
those who have assisted in making
our Senior Week a success.
"Then there is a sense of freedom
among us. We are glad to have

finished the college
course and to be
ready to enter upon
our life's work.
The new life will
be one of responsi
bility. We will
have the good
name of the Uni
versity in our keep
ing wherever we
may go. We must

remember that the world will judge
Stanford by out lives and by our
works.
" There is also a feeling of sorrow
that we as a class are soon to leave

Stanford. Within the next few days
we must say goodbye to our pro
fessors and our fellow students. We
will bid farewell to the old familiar
places, to the quad, the laboratories
and classrooms, to the lake, the
arboretum. j ■
"It is claimed by some that the
Stanford spirit was dead four years
;jgo. If that be true there has been
a wonderful awakening. It is a
pleasant thought to us that perhaps
we as a class have had some part in
this good work. We have a feeling
of pride for the class of Naught-four.
We fully recognize the qualities of
classes which have gone before, but
it is no more than natural that we |
should be proud of the reputation
which 'Naughty-four' has won.
History of '04 Class.
The history of the graduating class
was read by Miss Marie S. Burnham,
class historian. In part it was as
follows:
Nine years of Stanford history
were complete before the Class of

1904 came in past
thesphinxes. Since
that time it has
been our privilege
to contribute some
part to four years
more of it. Makers
of history form it,
all unaware, for
the most part, that
their deeds are to
be recorded and

live after them. But we, of these
early classes, who have shared
in the growth and development of
our University, have felt the respon
sibility of establishing her precedents
worthily, and of living for those who
shall come after us, down through
the ages.
Aware,apparently, that events worth
discussion were about to occur, our
earliest activity was in debating. We
organized a class society in our first
semester; in our second, we, repre
sented by Spencer, Roehr, and
Wood,defeated the Sophomore team.
During our second year we invaded
the literary societies—Euphronia,
Nestoria, Philolexian—and gradually
we have made our way into their
controlling offices. In 1903 the
ninth Carnot team was composed of
three members of this class which is
now about to graduate; this year we
held two places. Finally, last year,
as a fitting reward for faithful endeav
or, a trio of'o4 men had the pleasure
of defeating Berkeley in the Intercol
legiate debate; while this year in the
eleventh Intercollegiate, the strongest
team that California has ever sent
j against Stanford was beaten by a
j team which contained two '04 men.
j What the present graduating class
has accomplished in debating is well
summed up in the names of Frank
Roehr, Howard M. Lewis, O. C.
Spencer, and (). H. Ritter.
The last four years of Stanford
; dramatics are alight with the stars
this class has set in that firmament;
the farce and comedy committees of

the future will look far for others of
their magnitude. When as venerable
alumni we happen in on student
plays of the future, we shall note the
leading ladies with equal scepticism;
will they compare with Misses Hale,
Kerr, and Jeraldine Brown ? Then,
too, so long as we recall Assembly
Hall, or the football bleachers, or
bring to mind the farces we have
here enjoyed, just so long we shall
remember Cleveland Baker, of the
class of nineteen-four; as "stuntist,"
as comic actor, as yell leader, and
merry voice in all good fellowship,
we count him back through the last
four years as part of our best history.
In the field of undergraduate liter
ature and art, this class has been

unusually far to the
fore. Unwilling to
wait our turn, we
seized two of the
publications as ear
ly as our Junior
year: then Wally
Young edited the
Sequoia, and Ike
Russell the Chap
arral. We have

kept our hold through the present
year. We have been at the head of
the Daily Palo Alto for the custo
mary two semesters. We have
ventured to occupy the editorship
of the Alumnus while we are
as yet undergraduates. O. A.
Wilson, A 1 Hampson, and Fred
Powell, are names to remind us what
has been our ability in newspaper
work. Ike Russell represents our
originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any

Writer of the W ill
ill-gotten hours to the generations
that come after them.
The Class of 1903 we thank for its
gift to us of that brilliant collection of
Stanford stars —Ball, Baker, Perrin,
Dehy, Beach, and Norman Dole,
all whom we have been proud of as
our adopted children, and who have
added much to our prestige and their
glory while in our midst. As a
memorial to their works we do dedi
cate and bequeath unto the Class of
1905, these men, viz : Lanagan,
Hampson, F. H. Fowler, Hunter,
Bansbach, Wilson, Henley, and Gay,
regretting to leave them behind, but
doing so strong in the assurance that
they will prove as great a boon to
'05 as our inheritance from '03 has
proven to us.
We dedicate the football suits, the
track shoes, the baseball caps, the
editorial pen, and the purse strings of
Bansbach, Holman, Ball, Hampson,
and Cowden to their successors in
Stanford life—George Clark, Harry
Bell, A. L. Trowbridge, Ben Dey,
and Richard Barrett —assuring these
incoming men that they will find in
the work of Bansbach, Holman, Ball,
Hampson, and Cowden an example
of good government, faithful service,
and unostentatious attention to busi
ness that all may well emulate but
few excel.
To Norman Dole we offer our love
in 110 spirit of mere formality, assur
ing him that could he vault as high
over the wooden cross-bar as he has
vaulted into our hearts, he would
make the world's record a bigger
Stanford cinch than Greek pipology.
To Holman, Hyde, Dole, Bell,
West, Lanagan, Beach, and Dunn,
who will carry the Cardinal banner on
the fields of Chicago, we wish a
pleasant journey and a safe return to
the land of the Red Tile rich laden
in eastern booty.
To Lousley and Campbell we be
queath all the wire, bent and unbent,
that may be by them found in the
scrap-heap of ancient politics.
To Charles Firebaugh we dedicate
the opera Patience, confident that as
the lovely Dudley would say, it has
for him a motto well worth following.
To Arthur Cooley and Archibald
Fay we dedicate the Delta Gamma
lawn to be held as a stamping-ground
for whatever time they can spare
from the Alpha Phi premises.
The new tennis courts we dedicate
to George Hodge, whose plucky play
ing makes us hopeful for the future
of Stanford tennis. For these same
courts we thank Frank Leib, who
more than any other one man is re
sponsible for their being here.
To Professor Albert W. Smith
we bequeath a return-trip ticket from
Cornell to Stanford University and a
most hearty welcome should he ever
decide to use it.
To Miss Alice Kimball we dedi
cate the task of keeping us in touch
with one another during our journey
down the four wide ways of the world.
To Stanford women we commend her
record as an example of that unob
trusive, loyal interest in the Univer
sity which makes for the ideal of
what a Stanford woman should be.
To each one of us here assembled
the Class wishes a prosperous life filled
with memories of the Quad, and of
the Stock Farm, the Arboretum, and
Lagunita, Frenchman's Lake, the
tables of Mayfield, King's Mountain,
and Cooley's Landing, and even the
recitations which helped us to get in
the ten hours of sleep required daily
during the four years we have been
guests within the portals of our Alma
Mater.
And now endeth this last will and
testament, given on this sixteenth

day of" May, in the month of Brua,
in the first year of the reign of Roehr,
and of the reign of King David the
thirteenth.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises in
the chapel the class gathered in the
arcade in front of Memorial Church
to lay the '04 plate. President Brua
first introduced O. H. Ritter, the
class orator, who spoke as follows:
"This occasion is fraught with a
deeper meaning than appears at first
sight and with a greater significance
than the mere laying of a memorial
to the Class of 1904, for it is in these

characters that the
history of Stanford
University is to be
written, and these
numerals which we
are laying will be
the hieroglyphics
from which the fu
ture will decipher
the words success
or failure. And
whether it be suc-

cess or whether it be failure which
crowns the work of our Alma Mater
depends upon the success or the fail
ure in life of those whom she sends
forth. It is this occasion which
should bring vividly before us the
responsibility which rests upon us as
the latest addition to the ranks of the
alumni.
"It is but a few hours till we shall
receive the official seal of this Uni
versity announcing the completion of
our preparation and our readiness
for life's active struggles. This, per
haps our last official act as a class,
should cause us to reflect upon not
only our responsibility, but more
upon our duty. Our responsibility
is to keep unsullied the name of our
college, to safeguard and prove the
dignity of the Stanford degree. Our
duty is to show our appreciation of
the splendid endowment by aiming
to the utmost of our powers to live
up to our responsibilities.
"We muse realize that the fame
of the Stanford degree rests as much
upon those who receive the degree
as upon those who grant it. If those
who receive do not prove by their
successes the worth of their training,
the Stanford name will be stained
with failure. We who have received
the degree and accepted of what our
Alma Mater has to bestow, if we do
not become a success we shall not
have lived up to our responsibility,
and if we do not at least strive to
stand the test in the crucible of life
we shall be stamped as ingrates.
"We should be a success, then, in
order that our college may become
increasingly notable, for it is by our
triumphs in life's battles and by the
nobility of the ideals which we pur
sue that we shall attract the attention
of the world to the place whence we
received our training and shall draw
to Stanford the kind of men from
whom greater things may be expect
ed. These going forth into life and
sending to Stanford in increasing de
gree the finer elements of the nation
will make the work of our college
more and more famous.
" Further, this increasing dignity
and glory of the University adds to the
inlluence of its degree, and we, as
the recipients of the degree, shall
receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our
University fame and glory. May
this bronze of mystic import help the
future spell for our Alma Mater the
verdict of the world success

said, had been criticised -as always

And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any

Writer of the W ill
ill-gotten hours to the generations
that come after them.
The Class of 1903 we thank for its
gift to us of that brilliant collection of
Stanford stars —Ball, Baker, Perrin,
Dehy, Beach, and Norman Dole,
all whom we have been proud of as
our adopted children, and who have
added much to our prestige and their
glory while in our midst. As a
memorial to their works we do dedi
cate and bequeath unto the Class of
1905, these men, viz : Lanagan,
Hampson, F. H. Fowler, Hunter,
Bansbach, Wilson, Henley, and Gay,
regretting to leave them behind, but
doing so strong in the assurance that
they will prove as great a boon to
'05 as our inheritance from '03 has
proven to us.
We dedicate the football suits, the
track shoes, the baseball caps, the
editorial pen, and the purse strings of
Bansbach, Holman, Ball, Hampson,
and Cowden to their successors in
Stanford life—George Clark, Harry
Bell, A. L. Trowbridge, Ben Dey,
and Richard Barrett —assuring these
incoming men that they will find in
the work of Bansbach, Holman, Ball,
Hampson, and Cowden an example
of good government, faithful service,
and unostentatious attention to busi
ness that all may well emulate but
few excel.
To Norman Dole we offer our love
in 110 spirit of mere formality, assur
ing him that could he vault as high
over the wooden cross-bar as he has
vaulted into our hearts, he would
make the world's record a bigger
Stanford cinch than Greek pipology.
To Holman, Hyde, Dole, Bell,
West, Lanagan, Beach, and Dunn,
who will carry the Cardinal banner on
the fields of Chicago, we wish a
pleasant journey and a safe return to
the land of the Red Tile rich laden
in eastern booty.
To Lousley and Campbell we be
queath all the wire, bent and unbent,
that may be by them found in the
scrap-heap of ancient politics.
To Charles Firebaugh we dedicate
the opera Patience, confident that as
the lovely Dudley would say, it has
for him a motto well worth following.
To Arthur Cooley and Archibald
Fay we dedicate the Delta Gamma
lawn to be held as a stamping-ground
for whatever time they can spare
from the Alpha Phi premises.
The new tennis courts we dedicate
to George Hodge, whose plucky play
ing makes us hopeful for the future
of Stanford tennis. For these same
courts we thank Frank Leib, who
more than any other one man is re
sponsible for their being here.
To Professor Albert W. Smith
we bequeath a return-trip ticket from
Cornell to Stanford University and a
most hearty welcome should he ever
decide to use it.
To Miss Alice Kimball we dedi
cate the task of keeping us in touch
with one another during our journey
down the four wide ways of the world.
To Stanford women we commend her
record as an example of that unob
trusive, loyal interest in the Univer
sity which makes for the ideal of
what a Stanford woman should be.
To each one of us here assembled
the Class wishes a prosperous life filled
with memories of the Quad, and of
the Stock Farm, the Arboretum, and
Lagunita, Frenchman's Lake, the
tables of Mayfield, King's Mountain,
and Cooley's Landing, and even the
recitations which helped us to get in
the ten hours of sleep required daily
during the four years we have been
guests within the portals of our Alma
Mater.
And now endeth this last will and
testament, given on this sixteenth

day of" May, in the month of Brua,
in the first year of the reign of Roehr,
and of the reign of King David the
thirteenth.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises in
the chapel the class gathered in the
arcade in front of Memorial Church
to lay the '04 plate. President Brua
first introduced O. H. Ritter, the
class orator, who spoke as follows:
"This occasion is fraught with a
deeper meaning than appears at first
sight and with a greater significance
than the mere laying of a memorial
to the Class of 1904, for it is in these

characters that the
history of Stanford
University is to be
written, and these
numerals which we
are laying will be
the hieroglyphics
from which the fu
ture will decipher
the words success
or failure. And
whether it be suc-

cess or whether it be failure which
crowns the work of our Alma Mater
depends upon the success or the fail
ure in life of those whom she sends
forth. It is this occasion which
should bring vividly before us the
responsibility which rests upon us as
the latest addition to the ranks of the
alumni.
"It is but a few hours till we shall
receive the official seal of this Uni
versity announcing the completion of
our preparation and our readiness
for life's active struggles. This, per
haps our last official act as a class,
should cause us to reflect upon not
only our responsibility, but more
upon our duty. Our responsibility
is to keep unsullied the name of our
college, to safeguard and prove the
dignity of the Stanford degree. Our
duty is to show our appreciation of
the splendid endowment by aiming
to the utmost of our powers to live
up to our responsibilities.
"We muse realize that the fame
of the Stanford degree rests as much
upon those who receive the degree
as upon those who grant it. If those
who receive do not prove by their
successes the worth of their training,
the Stanford name will be stained
with failure. We who have received
the degree and accepted of what our
Alma Mater has to bestow, if we do
not become a success we shall not
have lived up to our responsibility,
and if we do not at least strive to
stand the test in the crucible of life
we shall be stamped as ingrates.
"We should be a success, then, in
order that our college may become
increasingly notable, for it is by our
triumphs in life's battles and by the
nobility of the ideals which we pur
sue that we shall attract the attention
of the world to the place whence we
received our training and shall draw
to Stanford the kind of men from
whom greater things may be expect
ed. These going forth into life and
sending to Stanford in increasing de
gree the finer elements of the nation
will make the work of our college
more and more famous.
" Further, this increasing dignity
and glory of the University adds to the
inlluence of its degree, and we, as
the recipients of the degree, shall
receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our
University fame and glory. May
this bronze of mystic import help the
future spell for our Alma Mater the
verdict of the world success
Reply by Dr. Jordan.
In accepting the plate in behalf of
the University, I)r. Jordan spoke of
the symbolism that the slab of brass
stood for. The American people, he
said, had been criticised -as always
active in pursuit of the "almighty
dollar." But no nation, he said, was
so full of ideals as they. In Europe
a man married for social advantage,
for money, for political advancement.
In America a man marries for love
alone.
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the love
of the undergraduate for his Alma
Mater, and especially for the small
institution. The strongest pledge of
the American institution for the
future, he said, lay in the fact that
there are always some who love it
when it is in its youth. We don't
always feel this spirit when we are
traveling around in our corduroys,
but it exists within us nevertheless.
This spirit, he said, had been con
spicuous at Stanford, and although
the institution was small, we could
look along and see a bright and
prosperous future.
The exercises closed with the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Mail" by the
assemblage.


O. H. Ritteu, Orator
The festivities of Senior Week
were formally opened by the Class
Day exercises, which were held in the
chapel Monday morning, May 16th.
The entire class, together with sev
eral hundred friends, listened with
interest to the address of the class
president, the history, and the will.
Following the exercises in the chapel
the laying of the class plate, with the
customary ceremonies, took place in
the arcade in front of Memorial
Church.
Address of Welcome.
E. G. Brua, president of the class,
opened the exercises in the chapel at
10:30 with the following words:
"On behalf of the graduating
class of 1904 I extend to each of you
a most cordial welcome to our Senior

Week exercises.
It is our wish to
make this week
one of the bright
spots in the lives
of all those in at
tendance.
"It is with a mix
ture of feelings that
we watch the ap
proach of the event

which marks the end of our college
days. Of these the thought of grati
tude is uppermost in our minds.
Gratitude first of all toward those who
have founded this great institution of
learning—an expression of parental
love —who have thus made it pos
sible for us to realize our ambitions
in the acquirement of a university
training. Our appreciation can only
be felt within ourselves. It can not
be expressed in words.
"Then we are indeed grateful to
the Faculty and other officers of the
University for their kindly attentions
toward us. We have been fortunate
in that most of the classes have been
small, thus permitting a personal
acquaintance with our instructors.
We cannot but feel that much of the
benefit which we have received while
here has come from this personal
contact with the members of the
Faculty. We owe them a debt
which we can only repay by proving
ourselves worthy in the years to
come.
"I desire to thank most heartily
those who have assisted in making
our Senior Week a success.
"Then there is a sense of freedom
among us. We are glad to have

finished the college
course and to be
ready to enter upon
our life's work.
The new life will
be one of responsi
bility. We will
have the good
name of the Uni
versity in our keep
ing wherever we
may go. We must

remember that the world will judge
Stanford by out lives and by our
works.
" There is also a feeling of sorrow
that we as a class are soon to leave

Stanford. Within the next few days
we must say goodbye to our pro
fessors and our fellow students. We
will bid farewell to the old familiar
places, to the quad, the laboratories
and classrooms, to the lake, the
arboretum. j ■
"It is claimed by some that the
Stanford spirit was dead four years
;jgo. If that be true there has been
a wonderful awakening. It is a
pleasant thought to us that perhaps
we as a class have had some part in
this good work. We have a feeling
of pride for the class of Naught-four.
We fully recognize the qualities of
classes which have gone before, but
it is no more than natural that we |
should be proud of the reputation
which 'Naughty-four' has won.
History of '04 Class.
The history of the graduating class
was read by Miss Marie S. Burnham,
class historian. In part it was as
follows:
Nine years of Stanford history
were complete before the Class of

1904 came in past
thesphinxes. Since
that time it has
been our privilege
to contribute some
part to four years
more of it. Makers
of history form it,
all unaware, for
the most part, that
their deeds are to
be recorded and

live after them. But we, of these
early classes, who have shared
in the growth and development of
our University, have felt the respon
sibility of establishing her precedents
worthily, and of living for those who
shall come after us, down through
the ages.
Aware,apparently, that events worth
discussion were about to occur, our
earliest activity was in debating. We
organized a class society in our first
semester; in our second, we, repre
sented by Spencer, Roehr, and
Wood,defeated the Sophomore team.
During our second year we invaded
the literary societies—Euphronia,
Nestoria, Philolexian—and gradually
we have made our way into their
controlling offices. In 1903 the
ninth Carnot team was composed of
three members of this class which is
now about to graduate; this year we
held two places. Finally, last year,
as a fitting reward for faithful endeav
or, a trio of'o4 men had the pleasure
of defeating Berkeley in the Intercol
legiate debate; while this year in the
eleventh Intercollegiate, the strongest
team that California has ever sent
j against Stanford was beaten by a
j team which contained two '04 men.
j What the present graduating class
has accomplished in debating is well
summed up in the names of Frank
Roehr, Howard M. Lewis, O. C.
Spencer, and (). H. Ritter.
The last four years of Stanford
; dramatics are alight with the stars
this class has set in that firmament;
the farce and comedy committees of

the future will look far for others of
their magnitude. When as venerable
alumni we happen in on student
plays of the future, we shall note the
leading ladies with equal scepticism;
will they compare with Misses Hale,
Kerr, and Jeraldine Brown ? Then,
too, so long as we recall Assembly
Hall, or the football bleachers, or
bring to mind the farces we have
here enjoyed, just so long we shall
remember Cleveland Baker, of the
class of nineteen-four; as "stuntist,"
as comic actor, as yell leader, and
merry voice in all good fellowship,
we count him back through the last
four years as part of our best history.
In the field of undergraduate liter
ature and art, this class has been

unusually far to the
fore. Unwilling to
wait our turn, we
seized two of the
publications as ear
ly as our Junior
year: then Wally
Young edited the
Sequoia, and Ike
Russell the Chap
arral. We have

kept our hold through the present
year. We have been at the head of
the Daily Palo Alto for the custo
mary two semesters. We have
ventured to occupy the editorship
of the Alumnus while we are
as yet undergraduates. O. A.
Wilson, A 1 Hampson, and Fred
Powell, are names to remind us what
has been our ability in newspaper
work. Ike Russell represents our
originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to

but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,

there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac

and was equally replete with ingen

of the more serious aspects of college

Unto the Class of

receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our
University fame and glory. May
this bronze of mystic import help the
future spell for our Alma Mater the
verdict of the world success
Reply by Dr. Jordan.
In accepting the plate in behalf of
the University, I)r. Jordan spoke of
the symbolism that the slab of brass
stood for. The American people, he
said, had been criticised -as always
active in pursuit of the "almighty
dollar." But no nation, he said, was
so full of ideals as they. In Europe
a man married for social advantage,
for money, for political advancement.
In America a man marries for love
alone.
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the love
of the undergraduate for his Alma
Mater, and especially for the small
institution. The strongest pledge of
the American institution for the
future, he said, lay in the fact that
there are always some who love it
when it is in its youth. We don't
always feel this spirit when we are
traveling around in our corduroys,
but it exists within us nevertheless.
This spirit, he said, had been con
spicuous at Stanford, and although
the institution was small, we could
look along and see a bright and
prosperous future.
The exercises closed with the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Mail" by the
assemblage.


O. H. Ritteu, Orator
The festivities of Senior Week
were formally opened by the Class
Day exercises, which were held in the
chapel Monday morning, May 16th.
The entire class, together with sev
eral hundred friends, listened with
interest to the address of the class
president, the history, and the will.
Following the exercises in the chapel
the laying of the class plate, with the
customary ceremonies, took place in
the arcade in front of Memorial
Church.
Address of Welcome.
E. G. Brua, president of the class,
opened the exercises in the chapel at
10:30 with the following words:
"On behalf of the graduating
class of 1904 I extend to each of you
a most cordial welcome to our Senior

Week exercises.
It is our wish to
make this week
one of the bright
spots in the lives
of all those in at
tendance.
"It is with a mix
ture of feelings that
we watch the ap
proach of the event

which marks the end of our college
days. Of these the thought of grati
tude is uppermost in our minds.
Gratitude first of all toward those who
have founded this great institution of
learning—an expression of parental
love —who have thus made it pos
sible for us to realize our ambitions
in the acquirement of a university
training. Our appreciation can only
be felt within ourselves. It can not
be expressed in words.
"Then we are indeed grateful to
the Faculty and other officers of the
University for their kindly attentions
toward us. We have been fortunate
in that most of the classes have been
small, thus permitting a personal
acquaintance with our instructors.
We cannot but feel that much of the
benefit which we have received while
here has come from this personal
contact with the members of the
Faculty. We owe them a debt
which we can only repay by proving
ourselves worthy in the years to
come.
"I desire to thank most heartily
those who have assisted in making
our Senior Week a success.
"Then there is a sense of freedom
among us. We are glad to have

finished the college
course and to be
ready to enter upon
our life's work.
The new life will
be one of responsi
bility. We will
have the good
name of the Uni
versity in our keep
ing wherever we
may go. We must

remember that the world will judge
Stanford by out lives and by our
works.
" There is also a feeling of sorrow
that we as a class are soon to leave

Stanford. Within the next few days
we must say goodbye to our pro
fessors and our fellow students. We
will bid farewell to the old familiar
places, to the quad, the laboratories
and classrooms, to the lake, the
arboretum. j ■
"It is claimed by some that the
Stanford spirit was dead four years
;jgo. If that be true there has been
a wonderful awakening. It is a
pleasant thought to us that perhaps
we as a class have had some part in
this good work. We have a feeling
of pride for the class of Naught-four.
We fully recognize the qualities of
classes which have gone before, but
it is no more than natural that we |
should be proud of the reputation
which 'Naughty-four' has won.
History of '04 Class.
The history of the graduating class
was read by Miss Marie S. Burnham,
class historian. In part it was as
follows:
Nine years of Stanford history
were complete before the Class of

1904 came in past
thesphinxes. Since
that time it has
been our privilege
to contribute some
part to four years
more of it. Makers
of history form it,
all unaware, for
the most part, that
their deeds are to
be recorded and

live after them. But we, of these
early classes, who have shared
in the growth and development of
our University, have felt the respon
sibility of establishing her precedents
worthily, and of living for those who
shall come after us, down through
the ages.
Aware,apparently, that events worth
discussion were about to occur, our
earliest activity was in debating. We
organized a class society in our first
semester; in our second, we, repre
sented by Spencer, Roehr, and
Wood,defeated the Sophomore team.
During our second year we invaded
the literary societies—Euphronia,
Nestoria, Philolexian—and gradually
we have made our way into their
controlling offices. In 1903 the
ninth Carnot team was composed of
three members of this class which is
now about to graduate; this year we
held two places. Finally, last year,
as a fitting reward for faithful endeav
or, a trio of'o4 men had the pleasure
of defeating Berkeley in the Intercol
legiate debate; while this year in the
eleventh Intercollegiate, the strongest
team that California has ever sent
j against Stanford was beaten by a
j team which contained two '04 men.
j What the present graduating class
has accomplished in debating is well
summed up in the names of Frank
Roehr, Howard M. Lewis, O. C.
Spencer, and (). H. Ritter.
The last four years of Stanford
; dramatics are alight with the stars
this class has set in that firmament;
the farce and comedy committees of

the future will look far for others of
their magnitude. When as venerable
alumni we happen in on student
plays of the future, we shall note the
leading ladies with equal scepticism;
will they compare with Misses Hale,
Kerr, and Jeraldine Brown ? Then,
too, so long as we recall Assembly
Hall, or the football bleachers, or
bring to mind the farces we have
here enjoyed, just so long we shall
remember Cleveland Baker, of the
class of nineteen-four; as "stuntist,"
as comic actor, as yell leader, and
merry voice in all good fellowship,
we count him back through the last
four years as part of our best history.
In the field of undergraduate liter
ature and art, this class has been

unusually far to the
fore. Unwilling to
wait our turn, we
seized two of the
publications as ear
ly as our Junior
year: then Wally
Young edited the
Sequoia, and Ike
Russell the Chap
arral. We have

kept our hold through the present
year. We have been at the head of
the Daily Palo Alto for the custo
mary two semesters. We have
ventured to occupy the editorship
of the Alumnus while we are
as yet undergraduates. O. A.
Wilson, A 1 Hampson, and Fred
Powell, are names to remind us what
has been our ability in newspaper
work. Ike Russell represents our
originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any

Writer of the W ill
ill-gotten hours to the generations
that come after them.
The Class of 1903 we thank for its
gift to us of that brilliant collection of
Stanford stars —Ball, Baker, Perrin,
Dehy, Beach, and Norman Dole,
all whom we have been proud of as
our adopted children, and who have
added much to our prestige and their
glory while in our midst. As a
memorial to their works we do dedi
cate and bequeath unto the Class of
1905, these men, viz : Lanagan,
Hampson, F. H. Fowler, Hunter,
Bansbach, Wilson, Henley, and Gay,
regretting to leave them behind, but
doing so strong in the assurance that
they will prove as great a boon to
'05 as our inheritance from '03 has
proven to us.
We dedicate the football suits, the
track shoes, the baseball caps, the
editorial pen, and the purse strings of
Bansbach, Holman, Ball, Hampson,
and Cowden to their successors in
Stanford life—George Clark, Harry
Bell, A. L. Trowbridge, Ben Dey,
and Richard Barrett —assuring these
incoming men that they will find in
the work of Bansbach, Holman, Ball,
Hampson, and Cowden an example
of good government, faithful service,
and unostentatious attention to busi
ness that all may well emulate but
few excel.
To Norman Dole we offer our love
in 110 spirit of mere formality, assur
ing him that could he vault as high
over the wooden cross-bar as he has
vaulted into our hearts, he would
make the world's record a bigger
Stanford cinch than Greek pipology.
To Holman, Hyde, Dole, Bell,
West, Lanagan, Beach, and Dunn,
who will carry the Cardinal banner on
the fields of Chicago, we wish a
pleasant journey and a safe return to
the land of the Red Tile rich laden
in eastern booty.
To Lousley and Campbell we be
queath all the wire, bent and unbent,
that may be by them found in the
scrap-heap of ancient politics.
To Charles Firebaugh we dedicate
the opera Patience, confident that as
the lovely Dudley would say, it has
for him a motto well worth following.
To Arthur Cooley and Archibald
Fay we dedicate the Delta Gamma
lawn to be held as a stamping-ground
for whatever time they can spare
from the Alpha Phi premises.
The new tennis courts we dedicate
to George Hodge, whose plucky play
ing makes us hopeful for the future
of Stanford tennis. For these same
courts we thank Frank Leib, who
more than any other one man is re
sponsible for their being here.
To Professor Albert W. Smith
we bequeath a return-trip ticket from
Cornell to Stanford University and a
most hearty welcome should he ever
decide to use it.
To Miss Alice Kimball we dedi
cate the task of keeping us in touch
with one another during our journey
down the four wide ways of the world.
To Stanford women we commend her
record as an example of that unob
trusive, loyal interest in the Univer
sity which makes for the ideal of
what a Stanford woman should be.
To each one of us here assembled
the Class wishes a prosperous life filled
with memories of the Quad, and of
the Stock Farm, the Arboretum, and
Lagunita, Frenchman's Lake, the
tables of Mayfield, King's Mountain,
and Cooley's Landing, and even the
recitations which helped us to get in
the ten hours of sleep required daily
during the four years we have been
guests within the portals of our Alma
Mater.
And now endeth this last will and
testament, given on this sixteenth

day of" May, in the month of Brua,
in the first year of the reign of Roehr,
and of the reign of King David the
thirteenth.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises in
the chapel the class gathered in the
arcade in front of Memorial Church
to lay the '04 plate. President Brua
first introduced O. H. Ritter, the
class orator, who spoke as follows:
"This occasion is fraught with a
deeper meaning than appears at first
sight and with a greater significance
than the mere laying of a memorial
to the Class of 1904, for it is in these

characters that the
history of Stanford
University is to be
written, and these
numerals which we
are laying will be
the hieroglyphics
from which the fu
ture will decipher
the words success
or failure. And
whether it be suc-

cess or whether it be failure which
crowns the work of our Alma Mater
depends upon the success or the fail
ure in life of those whom she sends
forth. It is this occasion which
should bring vividly before us the
responsibility which rests upon us as
the latest addition to the ranks of the
alumni.
"It is but a few hours till we shall
receive the official seal of this Uni
versity announcing the completion of
our preparation and our readiness
for life's active struggles. This, per
haps our last official act as a class,
should cause us to reflect upon not
only our responsibility, but more
upon our duty. Our responsibility
is to keep unsullied the name of our
college, to safeguard and prove the
dignity of the Stanford degree. Our
duty is to show our appreciation of
the splendid endowment by aiming
to the utmost of our powers to live
up to our responsibilities.
"We muse realize that the fame
of the Stanford degree rests as much
upon those who receive the degree
as upon those who grant it. If those
who receive do not prove by their
successes the worth of their training,
the Stanford name will be stained
with failure. We who have received
the degree and accepted of what our
Alma Mater has to bestow, if we do
not become a success we shall not
have lived up to our responsibility,
and if we do not at least strive to
stand the test in the crucible of life
we shall be stamped as ingrates.
"We should be a success, then, in
order that our college may become
increasingly notable, for it is by our
triumphs in life's battles and by the
nobility of the ideals which we pur
sue that we shall attract the attention
of the world to the place whence we
received our training and shall draw
to Stanford the kind of men from
whom greater things may be expect
ed. These going forth into life and
sending to Stanford in increasing de
gree the finer elements of the nation
will make the work of our college
more and more famous.
" Further, this increasing dignity
and glory of the University adds to the
inlluence of its degree, and we, as
the recipients of the degree, shall
receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our

originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any

Writer of the W ill
ill-gotten hours to the generations
that come after them.
The Class of 1903 we thank for its
gift to us of that brilliant collection of
Stanford stars —Ball, Baker, Perrin,
Dehy, Beach, and Norman Dole,
all whom we have been proud of as
our adopted children, and who have
added much to our prestige and their
glory while in our midst. As a
memorial to their works we do dedi
cate and bequeath unto the Class of
1905, these men, viz : Lanagan,
Hampson, F. H. Fowler, Hunter,
Bansbach, Wilson, Henley, and Gay,
regretting to leave them behind, but
doing so strong in the assurance that
they will prove as great a boon to
'05 as our inheritance from '03 has
proven to us.
We dedicate the football suits, the
track shoes, the baseball caps, the
editorial pen, and the purse strings of
Bansbach, Holman, Ball, Hampson,
and Cowden to their successors in
Stanford life—George Clark, Harry
Bell, A. L. Trowbridge, Ben Dey,
and Richard Barrett —assuring these
incoming men that they will find in
the work of Bansbach, Holman, Ball,
Hampson, and Cowden an example
of good government, faithful service,
and unostentatious attention to busi
ness that all may well emulate but
few excel.
To Norman Dole we offer our love
in 110 spirit of mere formality, assur
ing him that could he vault as high
over the wooden cross-bar as he has
vaulted into our hearts, he would
make the world's record a bigger
Stanford cinch than Greek pipology.
To Holman, Hyde, Dole, Bell,
West, Lanagan, Beach, and Dunn,
who will carry the Cardinal banner on
the fields of Chicago, we wish a
pleasant journey and a safe return to
the land of the Red Tile rich laden
in eastern booty.
To Lousley and Campbell we be
queath all the wire, bent and unbent,
that may be by them found in the
scrap-heap of ancient politics.
To Charles Firebaugh we dedicate
the opera Patience, confident that as
the lovely Dudley would say, it has
for him a motto well worth following.
To Arthur Cooley and Archibald
Fay we dedicate the Delta Gamma
lawn to be held as a stamping-ground
for whatever time they can spare
from the Alpha Phi premises.
The new tennis courts we dedicate
to George Hodge, whose plucky play
ing makes us hopeful for the future
of Stanford tennis. For these same
courts we thank Frank Leib, who
more than any other one man is re
sponsible for their being here.
To Professor Albert W. Smith
we bequeath a return-trip ticket from
Cornell to Stanford University and a
most hearty welcome should he ever
decide to use it.
To Miss Alice Kimball we dedi
cate the task of keeping us in touch
with one another during our journey
down the four wide ways of the world.
To Stanford women we commend her
record as an example of that unob
trusive, loyal interest in the Univer
sity which makes for the ideal of
what a Stanford woman should be.
To each one of us here assembled
the Class wishes a prosperous life filled
with memories of the Quad, and of
the Stock Farm, the Arboretum, and
Lagunita, Frenchman's Lake, the
tables of Mayfield, King's Mountain,
and Cooley's Landing, and even the
recitations which helped us to get in
the ten hours of sleep required daily
during the four years we have been
guests within the portals of our Alma
Mater.
And now endeth this last will and
testament, given on this sixteenth

day of" May, in the month of Brua,
in the first year of the reign of Roehr,
and of the reign of King David the
thirteenth.
Laying of the Plate.
Immediately after the exercises in
the chapel the class gathered in the
arcade in front of Memorial Church
to lay the '04 plate. President Brua
first introduced O. H. Ritter, the
class orator, who spoke as follows:
"This occasion is fraught with a
deeper meaning than appears at first
sight and with a greater significance
than the mere laying of a memorial
to the Class of 1904, for it is in these

characters that the
history of Stanford
University is to be
written, and these
numerals which we
are laying will be
the hieroglyphics
from which the fu
ture will decipher
the words success
or failure. And
whether it be suc-

cess or whether it be failure which
crowns the work of our Alma Mater
depends upon the success or the fail
ure in life of those whom she sends
forth. It is this occasion which
should bring vividly before us the
responsibility which rests upon us as
the latest addition to the ranks of the
alumni.
"It is but a few hours till we shall
receive the official seal of this Uni
versity announcing the completion of
our preparation and our readiness
for life's active struggles. This, per
haps our last official act as a class,
should cause us to reflect upon not
only our responsibility, but more
upon our duty. Our responsibility
is to keep unsullied the name of our
college, to safeguard and prove the
dignity of the Stanford degree. Our
duty is to show our appreciation of
the splendid endowment by aiming
to the utmost of our powers to live
up to our responsibilities.
"We muse realize that the fame
of the Stanford degree rests as much
upon those who receive the degree
as upon those who grant it. If those
who receive do not prove by their
successes the worth of their training,
the Stanford name will be stained
with failure. We who have received
the degree and accepted of what our
Alma Mater has to bestow, if we do
not become a success we shall not
have lived up to our responsibility,
and if we do not at least strive to
stand the test in the crucible of life
we shall be stamped as ingrates.
"We should be a success, then, in
order that our college may become
increasingly notable, for it is by our
triumphs in life's battles and by the
nobility of the ideals which we pur
sue that we shall attract the attention
of the world to the place whence we
received our training and shall draw
to Stanford the kind of men from
whom greater things may be expect
ed. These going forth into life and
sending to Stanford in increasing de
gree the finer elements of the nation
will make the work of our college
more and more famous.
" Further, this increasing dignity
and glory of the University adds to the
inlluence of its degree, and we, as
the recipients of the degree, shall
receive .additional prestige thereby.
So then Success must be our motto.
"The realization of this fact should
bring to each and every person whose
name is written beneath this bronze
a mighty determination to be a suc
cess in life, and a success in true
accord with the high ideals of the
Stanford spirit, a success based on

honest effort and determined striving
for a fixed goal, a success filled with
the fraternal feeling and the social
fellowship of the Stanford student.
''But while success must be our
motto, yet we must not yield to dis
appointment, nor consider ourselves
a failure if immediate triumphs do
not grace our banners. For we are
but freshmen in life's great univer
sity, while those whom we are to
meet for the first time as associates
on the quad of experience have
reached the status of the upperclass
nian.
''We must expect to spend our first
years in readjusting ourselves to the
new conditions, in finding our place
and making ready to forge to the
front when we have put behind us
the trials of the freshman years.
"And though we have come from
Stanford, life's great preparatory
school, we are crude in the ways of
life. We must expect errors, and
serious ones, too, and here is where
those who wear the corduroys in
life's curriculum should lend us their
aid, and give the advice which their
greater experience prompts, even as
the junior in college to the wayward
freshman.
"So, then, this ceremony is teeming
with suggestions, and if we but inter
pret it aright, it brings us a message
fraught with encouragement, and if
we shall tune our ear to catch its
note, we recognize the trumpet-call
summoning the Stanford regiments
to battle for the honor and the glory of
their college.
"And so now to the Class of 1904
I dedicate this plate. May the lesson
which it brings pass not unheeded,
but inspiring us with the realization
of the work before us, urge us 011 to
triumphant progress, building for our
University fame and glory. May
this bronze of mystic import help the
future spell for our Alma Mater the
verdict of the world success
Reply by Dr. Jordan.
In accepting the plate in behalf of
the University, I)r. Jordan spoke of
the symbolism that the slab of brass
stood for. The American people, he
said, had been criticised -as always
active in pursuit of the "almighty
dollar." But no nation, he said, was
so full of ideals as they. In Europe
a man married for social advantage,
for money, for political advancement.
In America a man marries for love
alone.
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the love
of the undergraduate for his Alma
Mater, and especially for the small
institution. The strongest pledge of
the American institution for the
future, he said, lay in the fact that
there are always some who love it
when it is in its youth. We don't
always feel this spirit when we are
traveling around in our corduroys,
but it exists within us nevertheless.
This spirit, he said, had been con
spicuous at Stanford, and although
the institution was small, we could
look along and see a bright and
prosperous future.
The exercises closed with the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Mail" by the
assemblage.
