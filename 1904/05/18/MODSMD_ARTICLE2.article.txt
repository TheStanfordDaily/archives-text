# EVENTS OF CLASS DAY.
## The
						Forenoon Taken Up With Customary Exercises in Chapel, and Laying of Plate. Senior Ball in the Evening. 
### 
The festivities of Senior Week
were formally opened by the Class
Day exercises, which were held in the
chapel Monday morning, May 16th.
The entire class, together with sev
eral hundred friends, listened with
interest to the address of the class
president, the history, and the will.
Following the exercises in the chapel
the laying of the class plate, with the
customary ceremonies, took place in
the arcade in front of Memorial
Church.
Address of Welcome.
E. G. Brua, president of the class,
opened the exercises in the chapel at
10:30 with the following words:
"On behalf of the graduating
class of 1904 I extend to each of you
a most cordial welcome to our Senior

Week exercises.
It is our wish to
make this week
one of the bright
spots in the lives
of all those in at
tendance.
"It is with a mix
ture of feelings that
we watch the ap
proach of the event

which marks the end of our college
days. Of these the thought of grati
tude is uppermost in our minds.
Gratitude first of all toward those who
have founded this great institution of
learning—an expression of parental
love —who have thus made it pos
sible for us to realize our ambitions
in the acquirement of a university
training. Our appreciation can only
be felt within ourselves. It can not
be expressed in words.
"Then we are indeed grateful to
the Faculty and other officers of the
University for their kindly attentions
toward us. We have been fortunate
in that most of the classes have been
small, thus permitting a personal
acquaintance with our instructors.
We cannot but feel that much of the
benefit which we have received while
here has come from this personal
contact with the members of the
Faculty. We owe them a debt
which we can only repay by proving
ourselves worthy in the years to
come.
"I desire to thank most heartily
those who have assisted in making
our Senior Week a success.
"Then there is a sense of freedom
among us. We are glad to have

finished the college
course and to be
ready to enter upon
our life's work.
The new life will
be one of responsi
bility. We will
have the good
name of the Uni
versity in our keep
ing wherever we
may go. We must

remember that the world will judge
Stanford by out lives and by our
works.
" There is also a feeling of sorrow
that we as a class are soon to leave

Stanford. Within the next few days
we must say goodbye to our pro
fessors and our fellow students. We
will bid farewell to the old familiar
places, to the quad, the laboratories
and classrooms, to the lake, the
arboretum. j ■
"It is claimed by some that the
Stanford spirit was dead four years
;jgo. If that be true there has been
a wonderful awakening. It is a
pleasant thought to us that perhaps
we as a class have had some part in
this good work. We have a feeling
of pride for the class of Naught-four.
We fully recognize the qualities of
classes which have gone before, but
it is no more than natural that we |
should be proud of the reputation
which 'Naughty-four' has won.
History of '04 Class.
The history of the graduating class
was read by Miss Marie S. Burnham,
class historian. In part it was as
follows:
Nine years of Stanford history
were complete before the Class of

1904 came in past
thesphinxes. Since
that time it has
been our privilege
to contribute some
part to four years
more of it. Makers
of history form it,
all unaware, for
the most part, that
their deeds are to
be recorded and

live after them. But we, of these
early classes, who have shared
in the growth and development of
our University, have felt the respon
sibility of establishing her precedents
worthily, and of living for those who
shall come after us, down through
the ages.
Aware,apparently, that events worth
discussion were about to occur, our
earliest activity was in debating. We
organized a class society in our first
semester; in our second, we, repre
sented by Spencer, Roehr, and
Wood,defeated the Sophomore team.
During our second year we invaded
the literary societies—Euphronia,
Nestoria, Philolexian—and gradually
we have made our way into their
controlling offices. In 1903 the
ninth Carnot team was composed of
three members of this class which is
now about to graduate; this year we
held two places. Finally, last year,
as a fitting reward for faithful endeav
or, a trio of'o4 men had the pleasure
of defeating Berkeley in the Intercol
legiate debate; while this year in the
eleventh Intercollegiate, the strongest
team that California has ever sent
j against Stanford was beaten by a
j team which contained two '04 men.
j What the present graduating class
has accomplished in debating is well
summed up in the names of Frank
Roehr, Howard M. Lewis, O. C.
Spencer, and (). H. Ritter.
The last four years of Stanford
; dramatics are alight with the stars
this class has set in that firmament;
the farce and comedy committees of

the future will look far for others of
their magnitude. When as venerable
alumni we happen in on student
plays of the future, we shall note the
leading ladies with equal scepticism;
will they compare with Misses Hale,
Kerr, and Jeraldine Brown ? Then,
too, so long as we recall Assembly
Hall, or the football bleachers, or
bring to mind the farces we have
here enjoyed, just so long we shall
remember Cleveland Baker, of the
class of nineteen-four; as "stuntist,"
as comic actor, as yell leader, and
merry voice in all good fellowship,
we count him back through the last
four years as part of our best history.
In the field of undergraduate liter
ature and art, this class has been

unusually far to the
fore. Unwilling to
wait our turn, we
seized two of the
publications as ear
ly as our Junior
year: then Wally
Young edited the
Sequoia, and Ike
Russell the Chap
arral. We have

kept our hold through the present
year. We have been at the head of
the Daily Palo Alto for the custo
mary two semesters. We have
ventured to occupy the editorship
of the Alumnus while we are
as yet undergraduates. O. A.
Wilson, A 1 Hampson, and Fred
Powell, are names to remind us what
has been our ability in newspaper
work. Ike Russell represents our
originality and wit in another class of
writing; in the more strictly literary
line we may well be proud of Miss
Kimball, Fred 11. Fowler, and Hugh
A. Moran. In art work we have
done better than the best of other
years. Miss K. E. Traphagen, B.
C. Bubb, and R. W. Borough were
never surpassed in the studio.
Nevertheless, while its excellence
in the lines of endeavor mentioned is
generally recognized, the Class of
1904 is destined to stand in Stanford
history preeminent for another qual
ity. We have been an athletic class,
—one of the greatest the college has
owned. We won our Freshman
football game in 1900, in a victory
which was as decisive as it was unex
pected. That same fall we gave to
the Varsity a pair of its best men
Louis Bansbach and Ralph McFad
den. Without them Traeger could
not have kicked the goal. Last fall
we came into our own. In football
we had Captain Bansbach, Clark,
Shields, Jacobs, Thompson, and
Hauverman; while under a '04 cap
tain, Holman, this year saw our sec
ond glorious track victory, in which

eight of our class
werepoint winners.
The '04 men who
took part were
Barrett, Bounds,
Waring, Bubb, the
two Hainiltons,
Morin, Thomson,
Gay, Crossman,
I lyde, Beach, Men
ley, Holman, Dunn,

Lanagan, and Dole. Bubb, Gay,
and Norman Dole are precious leg
acies to us from the Class of '03.
And now the Class of 1904, the
thirteenth team that Stanford Univer
sity has sent up, is about to enter
the field for the first play in the Big

Game of Life. For four years Alma
Mater has trained us diligently.
Most of us have survived the practice
season and enter the contest stamped
with the degree of our coaches' ap
proval. We take our leave amid the
cheers of a partisan rooting section.
They have picked their favorites ac
cording to the star-plays the mem
bers of this team have made, during
the preparatory games of the last few
years, and therein they can have
made few mistakes.
Yet here it is well to stop and think
for a moment of the men who, by
affording means of competition, by
also keeping training rules, by just
being loyal Stanford men, ready to
sub whenever the call shall come to
fill the place of a fallen star, ready to
step into the breach wherever a
breach shall occur; above all, those
who have been too busy doing team
work to afford the spectacular plays,
but whose very team work has made
these plays possible—we honor them,
too, from our hearts—the men of the

second team. Quiet
and unapplauded
though they be,
and unmentioned
here, by name,
there are those
among them who
will yet live to
bring these Cardi
nal-loving bleach
ers to their feet in
recognition. There

will be many a surprise in the long
course of the Big Game, which now,
for us, is called.
The Will of 1904.
The last will and testament of the
class was written and read by Isaac
Russell. It abounded in local hits,
and was equally replete with ingen
ious and humorous references to many
of the more serious aspects of college
activities. In part the will read as
follows:
We, the tribe of Nawtifore, being
of full age, and assembled here at the
end of our sojournings in the wilder
ness of Orrin and in the waste places
of Rufus, being possessed of a sound
mind and 77 points in the interclass
field-day, do hereby make, draw up,
construct, and otherwise frame and
bring together this last will and tes
tament, without compulsion from
Gilbert or restraint from Elliott.

Unto the Class of
1905 we do devise
and beqeath the
new gymnasium,
the finished quad
rangles, the new
library, and even
the income that,
soon to be released
from building funds
will make Stanford
the promised land

unto the borders of which, like Moses
of old, we have been permitted to
journey, and look down into from the
heights of the new fire-tower on the
row.
Unto said Class of 1905, their heirs
and assigns, we do dedicate William
: Hlake, Hauverman, and all other
1 heirlooms of our inheritance from the
J life class, charging them that they
! preserve these men from any gradu
ating influences, and hand them
down with record unsullied by any
