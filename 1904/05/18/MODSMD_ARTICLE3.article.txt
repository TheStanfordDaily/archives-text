# "THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND PROGRESS."
## Dr. O. L. Elliott Delivers the Thirteenth Annual Commencement Address to the Graduating Class. 
### 
The steady march of material
progress is one of the most impres
sive phenomena in human history.
There are some lost arts —arts
practiced by peoples of a high de
gree of civilization whose names
are all but forgotten. There has
been great destruction of the handi
work of man —of his art, his litera
ture, his palaces, his monuments,
his accumulations everywhere. Yet
how little of material advancement
has been lost. Man has set him
self resolutely to the task of mas
tering the world. He has studied
its constitution, experimented with
its forces, uncovered its secrets.
The results are so familiar, so a
part of our every day environment,
that we hardly grasp the marvel
ous unfolding to which the ages
bear testimony. From the first
rude grappling with wind and
wave to the latest triumphs of
wireless telegraphy and the modern
battleship there is comprehended
an almost infinite advance. From
Archimedes to Copernicus, from
Galileo to Watt and Stephenson,
from Gutenberg to Morse and Hell
and the host of inventors and dis
coverers who have made our later
times illustrious, there is one con
tinuous record of achievement.
From a period long antedating the
Christian era to the beginning of
its twentieth century there has
been no break in this progress.
What one ci vilization accomplished
another inherits. The position
reached by one generation becomes
the starting-point for the next. It
has been a progress that has min
istered to the wants of man, mak
ing the conditions of life ever more
agreeable, and leaping ahead to
open wider and wider avenues of
desire. It has made luxuries com
mon, brought widely separated
countries together, provided means
of travel and rapid communica
tion, improved dwellings, sanita
tion, clothing, and food. Through
its wealth and leisure it has reacted
upon science and philosophy, art
and literature, promoting intelli
gence, refinement, and the endless
quest for human welfare. Butchery
and wars of conquest, cruel impris
onments, persecution for opinion's
sake, oppression of woman —these
have waned, while the humane vir
tues in individuals and states, the
care for others and especially for
the unfortunate, forbearance, toler
ation, sympathy, kindliness, have
waxed and diffused themselves
throughout the civilized world.
The Brotherhood of Man and the
Federation of the World are at last
brought within the range of human
vision.
This picture is a perfectly real
one of the world in which we live.
Who can contemplate it without a
thrill of pride and exultation ?
Surely it is a good world in which
to be and to work.
Yet this is not all of the picture.
It is not the part which appeals to
many; and in that other part there
is enough to make all of us pause.
Civilization builds our cities, it
gives us ventilated, electric-lighted,
steam-heated houses; but it cuts
down our forests and turns us from
outdoors and independence to
shops and dependence. It gives us
hospitals, skilled physicians and
surgeons; it also provides the

rasped nerves and weakened con
stitutions which need them. It
brings leisure, aesthetic pleasures,
wide knowledge, opportunities of
travel; but it cuts us off from the
elemental forces. It gives us men
tal poise, nice discrimination, criti
cal taste, but God and duty are less
real. It gives us wealth and the
power of wealth, but not always the
ability to escape from the artificial
living, the ennui, the immoral idle
ness which wealth invites. Con
sider the crass display of riches,
the corruption in government, the
easy tolerance of vice, the sordid
ness of much living. How much
has this unprecedented material
advancement accomplished for the
permanent betterment of the world?
Have we progressed so far from the

time of Plato and Socrates? Ia the
ideal Republic so much nearer
realization than it was two thou
sand years ago ? What gladHome
ness there was in Greece ! How free
the human spirit ! In what an
empyrean of beauty, art, eloquence,
philosophy the Hellenist exulted !
In Attica art,literature, philosophy
soared to heights which have never
been outreached. Ln Rome gov
ernment was more resplendent than
the modern world has boasted. Yet
it is the glory that was Greece and
the grandeur that was Rome. One
after another the best of ancient civi
lizations have passed away. Egypt,
Babylon, Phoenecia, Greece, Car
thage, Rome wrote their names and
placed their monuments upon the
splendid heights, but they could
not transmit their spirit or their
genius. Instead of going on to
greater and greater achievements
in beauty, in sanity, in right living,
—instead of realizing the ideals of
Socrates and Plato, the Gracchi
and Marcus Aurelius, there came
arrest and decay, the races degener
ated, forgot virtue and sobriety,

lost the sense of beauty and holi
ness, and the sceptre passed away.
it is such a survey as this which
lends to the confident philosophy
that neither material advancement
nor art, nor philosophy, nor culture
has any necessary coincidence with
lasting progress—rather that they
arrest progress and finally accom
plish its overthrow. Wealth, cul
ture, refinement are the accompan
iments of maturity and matured
powers. May there not be, for
nations as for individuals, a matur
ity which is only a stage on the
way to decay and death? Other
civilizations have had their day;
our turn has come. The great
Anglo-Saxon race passing now out
of its virile youth is coming into
its inheritance of wealth and cul
ture. Even in America, latest come
to maturity, busied still with ex
ploitation, still the land of oppor
tunity, the burden of civilization is
becoming heavy. Wealth and art
and culture, the choicest products of
civilization, center in the cities.
The cities eat out the virility of the

! race. Continually they must be
fed from the country, and to this
j Moloch our youth are sacrificed in
| larger and larger numbers. Physi
cal vigor is declining. The power
|of wealth and the mysteries of
fortune-getting, the sense of depend
ence brought about by our complex
industrial situation, the widening
gulf between classes, the relative
| success of the grafter and the bood
ler and their comparative respecta
bility, the feeling that the rich and
powerful are not expected t<> obey
inconvenient laws —all lend to hope
lessly confuse moral values. The
reformer has spurts of enthusiastic
activity and righteous wrath. At
such times thieves and parasites
fare badly. Hut evil is always
alert. We magnanimously succor
Cuba, sparing nor life nor treasure
to set her free. Hut we find it
difficult to keep the generous spirit
I alive. We manage, at what cost
of labor and effort, to keep faith
with the Philippine people, serving
them gladly and ungrudgingly;
but we hardly dare hope that the
speculator will not eventually get

the upper hand. We form societies,
make indefatigable collections, and
dispatch missionaries to all the
dark corners of the earth; but do
the best we can, the conscienceless
trader, for whom no societies exist
and no collections are made, is first
on the ground. The White Man's
Burden is the burden of being
white, and nations which weep
over old-world oppressions find it
easier to take a city than to rule
their own spirit. The material
achievements of civilization may
be heaped up and passed on
to succeeding generations, intel
lectual poise, courtesy, courage,
self-control, virtue, are qualities
that can not be transmitted. They
must be won afresh by each indi
vidual. Every new generation
must begin at the beginning; and
luxury and easy going morality
are heavy handicaps, impairing the
elementary qualities upon which
virtue and wisdom must be based,
and breaking down the stimulus of
environment. Wealth we can
transmit —perhaps ; but not the
mental and moral mastery. The
resolute millionaire may for him
self successfully resist the corroding
influences of overmuch money and
power; but how hard for the second
generation to escape Newport and
nonentity.
Such a balancing, however, of
the good and evil in our civiliza
tion helps very little toward a set
tlement of the old dispute between
optimist and pessimist. But the
attitude of [our world toward these
uncompromising facts is vastly sig
nificant. Men have labored, and
prayed, and waited for a better civ
ilization. Betterment has come;
but betterment coincident with and
partly depending upon great com
plexity, a complexity which has
led to moral confusion and threat
ens disaster. Our age has recog
nized this confusion, but it has not
despaired. The biologization of so
ciety and civilization it sees is
purely fanciful. There is no neces
sary cycle from birth to decay and
death. The analogy, in the case
of nations which have passed away,
is striking; but it is only analogy.
It is our privilege to trace the
causes of decay, not in the nature
of the organism, but in the laws
which were violated. We are try
ing to study and understand the
dangers which accompany our
prosperity and which threaten it.
The disposition of the age —and
this is its hopeful sign—is to meas
ure well the difficulty and to under
take boldly. It is inquiring how
physical vigor can be preserved,
how virtue can be made to prevail
in the state, how the things which
deepen and enrich a human life
can be carried over to those who
follow us. Some achievements in
deed are without alloy. Antisep
tic surgery ministers only to human
weal, and is the priceless possession
of all who shall come ater us. Hu
man slavery, if it has not wholly
come to an end, has lost forever its
respectability. We do not easily
i write new Iliads, hut the old Iliad
remains. And between the best of
Greece and our own civilization are
the Gospels and Magna Charta,
Columbus, Wilberforce, Living
stone, Darwin, Shakspere, Dante,
Raphael, Paul, and .Jesus. True,
what we are and become cannot be
directly bestowed, but mistakes and
achievements are both schoolmas
ters of the race. In the fresh page
! of childhood is, after all, the hope
I of the world. Youth is forever the
I great asset of civilization. And
I the instrument upon which the
