# "THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND PROGRESS."
## Dr. O. L. Elliott Delivers the Thirteenth Annual Commencement Address to the Graduating Class. 
### 
The steady march of material
progress is one of the most impres
sive phenomena in human history.
There are some lost arts —arts
practiced by peoples of a high de
gree of civilization whose names
are all but forgotten. There has
been great destruction of the handi
work of man —of his art, his litera
ture, his palaces, his monuments,
his accumulations everywhere. Yet
how little of material advancement
has been lost. Man has set him
self resolutely to the task of mas
tering the world. He has studied
its constitution, experimented with
its forces, uncovered its secrets.
The results are so familiar, so a
part of our every day environment,
that we hardly grasp the marvel
ous unfolding to which the ages
bear testimony. From the first
rude grappling with wind and
wave to the latest triumphs of
wireless telegraphy and the modern
battleship there is comprehended
an almost infinite advance. From
Archimedes to Copernicus, from
Galileo to Watt and Stephenson,
from Gutenberg to Morse and Hell
and the host of inventors and dis
coverers who have made our later
times illustrious, there is one con
tinuous record of achievement.
From a period long antedating the
Christian era to the beginning of
its twentieth century there has
been no break in this progress.
What one ci vilization accomplished
another inherits. The position
reached by one generation becomes
the starting-point for the next. It
has been a progress that has min
istered to the wants of man, mak
ing the conditions of life ever more
agreeable, and leaping ahead to
open wider and wider avenues of
desire. It has made luxuries com
mon, brought widely separated
countries together, provided means
of travel and rapid communica
tion, improved dwellings, sanita
tion, clothing, and food. Through
its wealth and leisure it has reacted
upon science and philosophy, art
and literature, promoting intelli
gence, refinement, and the endless
quest for human welfare. Butchery
and wars of conquest, cruel impris
onments, persecution for opinion's
sake, oppression of woman —these
have waned, while the humane vir
tues in individuals and states, the
care for others and especially for
the unfortunate, forbearance, toler
ation, sympathy, kindliness, have
waxed and diffused themselves
throughout the civilized world.
The Brotherhood of Man and the
Federation of the World are at last
brought within the range of human
vision.
This picture is a perfectly real
one of the world in which we live.
Who can contemplate it without a
thrill of pride and exultation ?
Surely it is a good world in which
to be and to work.
Yet this is not all of the picture.
It is not the part which appeals to
many; and in that other part there
is enough to make all of us pause.
Civilization builds our cities, it
gives us ventilated, electric-lighted,
steam-heated houses; but it cuts
down our forests and turns us from
outdoors and independence to
shops and dependence. It gives us
hospitals, skilled physicians and
surgeons; it also provides the

rasped nerves and weakened con
stitutions which need them. It
brings leisure, aesthetic pleasures,
wide knowledge, opportunities of
travel; but it cuts us off from the
elemental forces. It gives us men
tal poise, nice discrimination, criti
cal taste, but God and duty are less
real. It gives us wealth and the
power of wealth, but not always the
ability to escape from the artificial
living, the ennui, the immoral idle
ness which wealth invites. Con
sider the crass display of riches,
the corruption in government, the
easy tolerance of vice, the sordid
ness of much living. How much
has this unprecedented material
advancement accomplished for the
permanent betterment of the world?
Have we progressed so far from the

time of Plato and Socrates? Ia the
ideal Republic so much nearer
realization than it was two thou
sand years ago ? What gladHome
ness there was in Greece ! How free
the human spirit ! In what an
empyrean of beauty, art, eloquence,
philosophy the Hellenist exulted !
In Attica art,literature, philosophy
soared to heights which have never
been outreached. Ln Rome gov
ernment was more resplendent than
the modern world has boasted. Yet
it is the glory that was Greece and
the grandeur that was Rome. One
after another the best of ancient civi
lizations have passed away. Egypt,
Babylon, Phoenecia, Greece, Car
thage, Rome wrote their names and
placed their monuments upon the
splendid heights, but they could
not transmit their spirit or their
genius. Instead of going on to
greater and greater achievements
in beauty, in sanity, in right living,
—instead of realizing the ideals of
Socrates and Plato, the Gracchi
and Marcus Aurelius, there came
arrest and decay, the races degener
ated, forgot virtue and sobriety,

lost the sense of beauty and holi
ness, and the sceptre passed away.
it is such a survey as this which
lends to the confident philosophy
that neither material advancement
nor art, nor philosophy, nor culture
has any necessary coincidence with
lasting progress—rather that they
arrest progress and finally accom
plish its overthrow. Wealth, cul
ture, refinement are the accompan
iments of maturity and matured
powers. May there not be, for
nations as for individuals, a matur
ity which is only a stage on the
way to decay and death? Other
civilizations have had their day;
our turn has come. The great
Anglo-Saxon race passing now out
of its virile youth is coming into
its inheritance of wealth and cul
ture. Even in America, latest come
to maturity, busied still with ex
ploitation, still the land of oppor
tunity, the burden of civilization is
becoming heavy. Wealth and art
and culture, the choicest products of
civilization, center in the cities.
The cities eat out the virility of the

! race. Continually they must be
fed from the country, and to this
j Moloch our youth are sacrificed in
| larger and larger numbers. Physi
cal vigor is declining. The power
|of wealth and the mysteries of
fortune-getting, the sense of depend
ence brought about by our complex
industrial situation, the widening
gulf between classes, the relative
| success of the grafter and the bood
ler and their comparative respecta
bility, the feeling that the rich and
powerful are not expected t<> obey
inconvenient laws —all lend to hope
lessly confuse moral values. The
reformer has spurts of enthusiastic
activity and righteous wrath. At
such times thieves and parasites
fare badly. Hut evil is always
alert. We magnanimously succor
Cuba, sparing nor life nor treasure
to set her free. Hut we find it
difficult to keep the generous spirit
I alive. We manage, at what cost
of labor and effort, to keep faith
with the Philippine people, serving
them gladly and ungrudgingly;
but we hardly dare hope that the
speculator will not eventually get

the upper hand. We form societies,
make indefatigable collections, and
dispatch missionaries to all the
dark corners of the earth; but do
the best we can, the conscienceless
trader, for whom no societies exist
and no collections are made, is first
on the ground. The White Man's
Burden is the burden of being
white, and nations which weep
over old-world oppressions find it
easier to take a city than to rule
their own spirit. The material
achievements of civilization may
be heaped up and passed on
to succeeding generations, intel
lectual poise, courtesy, courage,
self-control, virtue, are qualities
that can not be transmitted. They
must be won afresh by each indi
vidual. Every new generation
must begin at the beginning; and
luxury and easy going morality
are heavy handicaps, impairing the
elementary qualities upon which
virtue and wisdom must be based,
and breaking down the stimulus of
environment. Wealth we can
transmit —perhaps ; but not the
mental and moral mastery. The
resolute millionaire may for him
self successfully resist the corroding
influences of overmuch money and
power; but how hard for the second
generation to escape Newport and
nonentity.
Such a balancing, however, of
the good and evil in our civiliza
tion helps very little toward a set
tlement of the old dispute between
optimist and pessimist. But the
attitude of [our world toward these
uncompromising facts is vastly sig
nificant. Men have labored, and
prayed, and waited for a better civ
ilization. Betterment has come;
but betterment coincident with and
partly depending upon great com
plexity, a complexity which has
led to moral confusion and threat
ens disaster. Our age has recog
nized this confusion, but it has not
despaired. The biologization of so
ciety and civilization it sees is
purely fanciful. There is no neces
sary cycle from birth to decay and
death. The analogy, in the case
of nations which have passed away,
is striking; but it is only analogy.
It is our privilege to trace the
causes of decay, not in the nature
of the organism, but in the laws
which were violated. We are try
ing to study and understand the
dangers which accompany our
prosperity and which threaten it.
The disposition of the age —and
this is its hopeful sign—is to meas
ure well the difficulty and to under
take boldly. It is inquiring how
physical vigor can be preserved,
how virtue can be made to prevail
in the state, how the things which
deepen and enrich a human life
can be carried over to those who
follow us. Some achievements in
deed are without alloy. Antisep
tic surgery ministers only to human
weal, and is the priceless possession
of all who shall come ater us. Hu
man slavery, if it has not wholly
come to an end, has lost forever its
respectability. We do not easily
i write new Iliads, hut the old Iliad
remains. And between the best of
Greece and our own civilization are
the Gospels and Magna Charta,
Columbus, Wilberforce, Living
stone, Darwin, Shakspere, Dante,
Raphael, Paul, and .Jesus. True,
what we are and become cannot be
directly bestowed, but mistakes and
achievements are both schoolmas
ters of the race. In the fresh page
! of childhood is, after all, the hope
I of the world. Youth is forever the
I great asset of civilization. And
I the instrument upon which the

democratic state must stake its ex
istence anil its future, the instru
ment 011 which the progress of soci
ety depends, is Education.
It was nothing short of the in
spiration of genius which planted
the schoolhouse in every American
community, which rested the foun
dations of the Republic upon the
education of every citizen, which
set up the American college in
every considerable community.
This is not the place to speak of
what the common school has ac
complished and of its vital relation
to the stability of the Republic.
It has univeralized intelligence. It
has responded to the deep thirst for
knowledge characteristic of Ameri
can democracy. But common
school and college and university,
falling short of adequate service to
the state, have slowly yielded to
new demands and new ideals, and
are transforming themselves before
our eyes. Education is of many
kinds, and training in citizenship
does not cease when school days
are over. But the schools have
the inspiring advantage of dealing
with youth and with the intel
lectual aspect of training. It is of
these new demands and new ideals,
particularly as affecting the higher
education, that I am to speak.
The college, and in time the uni
versity, while they kept pace with
the march of settlement, were
hardly counted as of or for the
common man. Free to the aristoc
racy of intellect, they existed di
rectly for the elect, only very indi
rectly for the mass. The chosen
youth, prepared by a long course
of mental discipline, with trained
minds and a good conscience, arriv
ing at the portals of the college,
were to enter in to a favored land
where they would be shielded from
the distracting influences of the
business and profane world, with
large leisure for thought and quiet,
under the guidance of wise teacherß,
with four golden, protected years in
which to train the reason, develop
the taste and imagination, polish
and perfect the intellectual powers.
The Greek had conceived of knowl
edge as the highest good — not
meaning by knowledge mere intel
lectual dexterity, nor acquaintance
with facts, but the highest cultiva
tion of the faculties, the knowledge
which gave poise, sanity, judgment,
wisdom, which refined the taste and
cultivated the imagination. It was
the passionate thesiß of Greek phi
losophy that no one would willingly
do wrong, that knowing the good
one would not, could not, choose the
evil. The American college adopt
ed the Greek ideal of intellectual
development, following itsomewhat
haltingly, it is true, and endeavor
ing to add, for the transmutation
of knowledge into virtue, the pro
fession and practice of the Chris
tian religion. College graduates,
with the stamp of culture upon
them, were then to proceed to the
professional schools, there to be
fitted to become the doctors, preach
ers, and lawyers of the world, to
occupy the chief positions of influ
ence and responsibility, to make
the laws, to administer justice, to
write the books, to interpret the
ways of God to man. How far
short of its own ideal the college
fell, how the husksof grammar and
the niceties of logic caricatured
this culture and failed to fuse it
with character, the college graduate
of half a century ago can tell. But
at its worst, as well as at its best,
it claimed four years of youth, and

in those four years there was time
for much besides grammar and
hair-splitting. The time apart, tbe
association with one's fellows, the
saturation, to some extent at least,
with tbe best that had been known
and thought in the world, the influ
ence of great-hearted men,redeemed
the inadequacy of curriculum and
teaching. All honor to the Ameri
can college for what it did! That
the work-a-day world felt little or
no dependence upon the college
trained man, that in the business
world he was distanced by the ap
prentice, did not trouble the college.
It was not supposed that the higher
education was especially for the
business man, or that it would fit
him to do his particular work. In
deed it was tbe pride of the college,
as distinguished from tlie profes
sional school, that it was di
vorced from utilitarian needs,
that it had nothing to do
with the merely useful. Cul
ture was the necessary prerequisite
to professional life, the sign and
seal of the educated man; but the
mere business of the world must be
done by the common man who got
his training, not in college, not in
any school, but in his business.
For the elect the goal must be
culture, than which there is none
higher. The way to culture is
through the humanities —the study
of Greek and Latin, mathematics,
and philosophy.
A new country, thinly populated,
with vast unexplored and unex
ploited riches, and a thrifty and
enterprising population, is protect
ed from most of the evils of a high
state of civilization. Its strength
is in the self-reliance, the sturdi
ness and independence of its citi
zens, its wealth of opportunity,
which forbids the closing of the
door upon any citizen's indepen
dent living. With that age passing
for America, with no more broad
and fertile prairies to assimilate
the surplus home population and
the stream of immigration, with
the balance of power passing from
country to city, with humanity
congested, with great wealth and
great poverty jostling each other,
with class divisions becoming pro
nounced, with the proletariat be
ginning to arrive, with the strong
grasp of Puritanism relaxed, the
inadequacy of the old humanistic
training to meet the needs of the
state became evident. Democracy
must seriously take stock of its re
sources and prepare to fight for its
own preservation; and of these re
sources its schools are first in im
portance.
The first reconstruction came in
an enlargement of the avenues to
culture. The humanities, it was
contended, did not exhaust the sub
jects of human interest,and through
other studies t he powers the of mind
might be developed, the taste and
imagination refined. One by one
as the modern languages, science,
history, economics, and the others
made their demand for recognition
in the college curriculum, they
were challenged on the ground of
lack of culture value. They ac
cepted the challenge, and a furious
controversy followed. In the end
they were admitted to the sacred
curriculum, grudgingly at first, but
their admission justified on the
ground that they had won their
case, their culture value was dem
onstrated. How vastly the higher
education gained by this infusion
of new subjects and by the scientific
method which accompanied them,
and which was also applied to the
old subjects, is now a matter of
common agreement.
But this movement, far-reaching
and beneficent as it has been, was
only a beginning. Democracy has
been a long time in becoming dem
ocratic. It was the old idea even
for a democracy that the masses
were to spontaneously choose wise
leaders, or to be persuaded, by
whatever artifice was necessary, to
accept those clearly pointed out
by reason of their training and
wisdom. The masses were to be
rustic, ingenuous, deferential, look
ing up for direction to specially
trained superiors. Almost with a
savage suddenness we have seen
this ideal rejected. Suddenly dem
ocracy has become all of us, choos
ing its own kind lo be its instru
ments and leaders. Rank, crude,
coarse, with its brawling jour
nalism, its cheap and tawdry
rhetoric, its brutal politics, its
coarse amusements, its rag-time
literature, it is still the major
ity become conscious that it
is the majority. The mantle of
authoritative leadership has fallen
from the old learned professions.
The business world, on the one
hand, with its enormous enter
prises and its quickly gathered
wealth, the workingman on the
other, with his highly centralized
organization and newly achieved
solidarity, both formerly quite
without the pale of the higher edu
cation, have ceased to look up very
much for direction to culture.
There is very little holding the ear
to the ground to catch what the
aristocracy of learning has to say.
It is no longer worth while to ten
der to this majority ready-made
leaders of a superior brand. Only
those will be received as leaders
who are able to lead. College men
have made their way under these
new conditions by playing the
demagogue and forgetting the ideals
of the cloister, or through a rude
awakening and painful readjust
ment, or else by virtue of a train
ing which has fitted them to grasp
effectively the problems of today
and press them toward solution.
Democracy must accept its major
ity, and there is hope for its future
only as there is the possibility of
effective training and advancing
ideals for all its citizens. How
shall the training necessary to
independence and wise citizenship
be brought within the reach of all?
The idea of education as a direct
training and fitting for the work-a
day world is pretty foreign to all
orthodox conception and seems to
contrast sharply with the venerated
culture ideal. The education which
the common school gave—a knowl
edge of the three '.'RV with some
acquaintance with grammar, geog
raphy, and the outline facts of
history, was primarily a process of
mental discipline. This elemen
tary mental training was for the
majority of its citizens not only all
that the State could afford to give,
but all that its citizens could need
or make use of. If intended for
the ranks of unskilled labor, they
went early to their tasks with the
ability to read and write and
cipher too, perhaps; if ambitious
to fill places requiring skill, they
entered upon the necessary appren
ticeship, or, in the day of easy op
portunity, set up for themselves.
For those of presumably larger
mental development, whose am
bitions were aroused, whose parents
could afford it or whose resources

could compass it, there followed
the high school, which further de
veloped the mental powers, broad
ened the outlook, anil so made pos
sible apprenticeship for larger un
dertakings. At the apex stood the
college with its finer discipline and
final arrival of the select few at the
paradise of culture.
Whether it was the observation
that this mental training was mak
ing small impress upon a great
mass of coming citizens, whether
the conviction that this culture was
too often a veneer in no way trans
muted into virtue and character,
whether its relative inefficiency
compared with the demands of a
modern world was too glaring,
whether for alarm for its own pres
ervation and the progress of civili
zation, whatever the precipitating
cause, triumphant democracy has
emphatically rejected this ideal,
and rejected it, as it believes, in the
interests of a larger and better
civilization. Because the success
of America has been so great, be
cause there is such mastery of ma
terial conditions, such daring for
the future, such possibilities in the
midst of great dangers, the State
has turned to education as the con
serving, uplifting force in the
progress of civilization. The
schools must become a larger factor
in the life of society, and furnish a
larger equipment for the practical
duties of life. The school years are
the years in which character and
capacity are fixed. Tomorrow is
bound up with today; it will be to
a large extent what the schools
make it. Every citizen of the
republic is entitled, during his
formative years, to all the prelim
inary training for citizenship he
can acquire and assimilate. And
the State, in its generous provision
for education, must have in mind
the best preparation for, and the
most direct connection which can
be made with, the life he is to live.
Character, power, efficiency—this
three-fold purpose must run
through all education.
Two questions at once arise. Is
the higher education, then, to be
imposed upon everbody ? And is
it, after all, only utilitarian train
ing for the shop, the farm, and the
counting-room? Is the pure search
for knowledge, the lofty idealism,
the life of the epirit, to be degraded
to the base uses of trade and
money-getting ? Are we to be a
nation of engineers, shopkeepers
only ? Granted that the old curri
culum was not varied enough to
meet the needs of everybody: we
have enlarged it by the addition
of other and varied subjects of
human interest. Is the age utili
tarian, absorbed in money-getting?
Let us hold high the torch of cul
ture. Let us emphasize the things
of the spirit. Let the university
with its leisure and philosophic
calm oppose the rush, the worry,
the hopeless vulgarity of modern
life. To open and enlarge the
mind, to saturate it with the clas
sics of literature and philosophy,
to withdraw contemplation from
the practical, every-day aspect of
the world, to imbed the student in
an atmosphere where not much
that is useful is taught, to prepare
a place apart, a kingdom of the
mind to which the later man of
affairs may retire for refreshment
and renewal—let this be the high
aim of the college and the univer
sity. First the time apart, the
cloister, the development of the
taste and imagination; after that
as much training for professional
work as time and opportunity per
mit. " We believe," says the pres
ident of Williams College in his last
annual report, "that a college should
not become simply a preparatory
department for the professional
schools, but should claim for the
full course in Liberal Arts, and for
its appropriate degree, an inde
pendent dignity and worth. . . .
Science must be given its rightful
place of honor, and the scientific
method must be understood, wel
comed, and adopted. The New
Humanities, such as the modern
languages, economics, and gov
ernment must have their place, and
the college must be kept in vital
touch with living questions of
patriotism and the great enthusi
asms of humanity. At the same
time we all believe in the unique
value of the full classical training.
Certainly if we are to cultivate
here the highest literary taste and
form, if we are to secure precision
and elegance of style as a charac
teristic of Williams men, we can
not afford to neglect Greek. . . .
If the trend under the new curric
ulum is too much away from the

humanities, it, and not the human
ities, must he set aside."
It may he that in forming for
itself a new ideal of education
based upon social need, the State
has seemed sometimes to emphasize
unduly its ulilitarian character. It
may he that proportion and se
quence have sometimes been lost
sight of. Hut in saying that
democracy has rejected the culture
ideal as the end of education we
are merely insisting that it has
passed on to a larger conception of
the value of human life and of the
possibilities of its development.
Indeed, if we accept Matthew
Arnold's definition of culture as
"vital knowledge," we may dismiss
at once all controversy which the
term has engendered. Only our
conception of the function and field
of the higher education is immense
ly enlarged.
But here again we meet with
contradiction. In spite of the large
infusion of new subjects, in spite of
the "vital touch with living ques
tions of patriotism and the great
enthusiasms of humanity," it is
becoming the fashion to doubt
whether education is the panacea
it is claimed to be and to wonder if
there are not already too many men
and women seeking the universities
and unfitting themselves for plain
tasks on their own particular levels.
Valuable as culture is held to be in
and for itself, it somehow dissolves
in contact with the street-car con
ductor's punch. The overcrowding
of the professions, the struggling
lawyers and doctors, the unsuccess
ful teachers, the bewildered schol
ars, the misfits and failures
everywhere among college gradu
ates seem to bear out thecontention
that not only the cultivation of the
taste and imagination, but the
practical training of science and
government, and even scholarship
as well, has its limitations.
It may be freely conceded that
there are too many young men and
young women pressing into our
colleges and universities. They
have been sent by parents who did
not understand the university, or
who, having means, followed the
fashion, or who did not know what
else to do with their children's
time, or who regarded the univer
sity, alas, as a reformatory. These
recruits come listlessly, without
any real preparation of the heart,
not gripped by any great purpose,
thinking merely of good times and
college pranks, or, it may be, with
the fair nsset of youth already
squandered. There are tests, which
weed out those who do not roughly
measure up to some prearranged
intellectual standard. Alas that
character tests are not more effec
tive, that the unfit are not rigidly
turned back before the corrosion of
their presence has wrought its un
told mischief. The university is
equipped for its special purpose. It
is possible for it, by means of cum
brous machinery, by large expendi
ture of effort, by an occasional and
almost accidental contact with the
springs of action, to reclaim the
wayward and convert the vicious.
Hut it is too costly and wasteful a
process —not only in the effort
spent, but in the demoralization
and lowering of standards which
the toleration of slovenliness,
shamming, and dissipation in
volves. There are reformatories
with better adaptation for the kind
of work here needed. Policemen
are out of place in a university.
But the university must deliver
itself from the morally disinte
grated and from the idler. The
higher education must remain for
the elect—hut always the self
elected—those prepared in heart
and mind and who come to it as to
a joyful task. There cannot be too
much efficiency in the world, there
cannot he too many of the elect
coming up to the universities. The
world guarantees no salaried posi
tions, and is shy of its gifts to those
whose conception of education does
not rise above place-hunting. But
self-reliance and the mastery of some
good tool will always land their
possessor on his feet, and if by
some freak of a usually wise world
he finds himself in a humble place,
the place is dignified and not he
degraded.
It is a familiar commonplace
that just the atmosphere of the
cloister and the intimate associa
tions of the four years are of more
importance than all the formal in
struction which the college can give.
The stricter truth is that atmos
phere and association condition all
the college work. The impulse
which turns the whole life, the
touch which opens unseeing eyes,
may and often does come from this
stimulating air and these fortuitous
associations. But if the college has
taken anything like its rightful
place, these are but portals leading
into the treasure-house of learning.
It is pardonable in after-dinner
reminiscence of far-away times to
dwell upon the external, the chance
situation, the burlesque. But tbe
man who seriously looking back
upon his four years of college life
seeß in it chiefly his fraternity,
athletics, college pranks or dissipa
tions confesses to having missed
that which was chiefly worth the
getting and which alone justifies
the college's existence. There is
much unconsidered talk about
treating college youth as men. The
important point is how they treat
themselves. College students who
hold themselves steadily as men
and women thereby become enti
tled to every consideration which ob
tains among men and women. The
college interposes no hindrances.
For them is the high privilege of
undivided and unimpeded coopera
tion with the vital process of train
ing. For the most part, however,
the university is summoned to pro
mote, at its most important and
most difficult stage, the tremendous
task of making men out of boys.
The university cannot escape its
responsibility by any fine theory
about being concerned only with
the presentation of subjects, which
the student can take or leave as he
chooses. Twenty and opportunity
is a far greater asset than sixty and
millions. It is too much to expect
youth to see this obvious bit of
maturer wisdom, but it is none the
less incumbent upon the university
to do what it can to avert the in
credible folly of throwing away
this unrenewable inheritance. For
tunately the course of the univer
sity is simple. It does not look for
the sustained gravity of mature
manhood; it no longer feels it nec
essary to suppress the rebellious
mood natural to youth; fun and
exuberance are its good allies. But
the university can meet and catch
the entering freshman with a grip
ping task, it can surround him
with the fragrance of learning and
with the freshening breath of high
purpose in the accomplishment of
definite things, and it can hold to
unflinching standards.
As helps in accelerating this pas
sage over very thin ice—the transi
tion from immaturity to self-control
and mastery —there is no doubt

that two of the great discoveries of
modern higher educution are ath
letics and co-education. Co-educa
tion, more than any other one
thing, discovers to the hoodlum and
the evil-minded that they have ar
rived at the wrong place. Frank
comradeship is the sovereign anti
dote to boorishness, to sentimen
tality on the one side and disloy
alty on the other. Athletics, in
spite of the severe strain which is
put upon the athletic hero, in spite
of the mock heroics with which we
surround intercollegiate sports, in
spite of the all too vicarious char
acter of much athletic activity, —
athletics is still among the whole
some, clarifying, manly-making
influences of the university.
Does progress, then, mean more
plows, more steamships, more trol
leys, larger cities, greater enter
prises and greater success in them?
Now it is not the purpose of the
higher education to frown upon en
terprise. It will promote enterprise
by equipping men with decision,
with courage, with power. If the
higher education prepares you to
earn your living and your indepen
dence in straight-forward, honest,
capable fashion, by doing a task
which the world wants done and
for which it is willing to pay, it has
done well. "In this world," writes
Theodore Roosevelt, "the one thing
supremely worth having is the op
portunity, coupled with the capa
city, to do well and worthily a
piece of work the doing of which is
of vital consequence to the welfare
of mankind." But the promotion
of enterprise is not everything. The
higher education does not dissipate
its resources by attempting what
belongs to the shop and the farm.
Democracy has rejected a culture
not based upon high seriousness
and co-existing with vapidity of
character and an invertebrate will;
but it has no quarrel with a schol
arship that is real, nor with the
humanities that really make the
connection between knowledge and
virtue. In our day, with its lack
of reverence for dogmatics and
its intolerance of cant, a layer
of religion cannot be added on* to
culture to do this work. To be
merely religious is to be merely
useless, and religion can work only
in what is vital and alive. Democ
racy can also believe in the
"unique value of the full classical
training" —because it believes in
the unique value of many another
training which brings youth and
reality into intimate and loving
touch. The essence of the higher
education is not in its pursuit of
precision and elegance of style, any
more than in its pursuit of super
intendencies in the railway ser
vice: but the one as legitimately as
the other. Education must have
in mind more than precision and
elegance on the one hand and more
than a salaried position on the
other—by-products, as it were. Ed
ucation proceeds on the plan of a
more efficient man playing his part
in the life of the community and
of the state. The higher education
exemplifies the fine right and duty,
for every man and woman who can
compass it, of prolonging the years
of training that the life may be
worthier, the service better. Dem
ocracy asks the university to touch
human activity everywhere with
the university ideal—with mastery
consecrated to service. The higher
education is as much of engineer
ing and agriculture, of music and
the fine arts, as it is of the human
ities, of science, of history, of gov
ernment. There is a stimulation, a
gain in effectiveness, in having all
these varied educational divisions
included in a single foundation.
Poverty of resources usually forbids
this. But in selecting different
fields, let.not one institution esteem
itself better than another unless it
more effectively trains men and
women for wise and useful living.
The future of the small college is
undecided. It is secure so long as
whatever it does is genuine and
genuinely responds to the needs of
a higher civilization. Must we say
that precision and elegance are to
come first and agriculture and en
gineering afterward, lest there be
no large vision? With four of the
choicest years of youth, in the com
panionship and under the instruc
tion of men worthy of such tasks,
gaining mastery of real problems
and ascending to wider and wider
outlooks, are we still afraid of ar
riving only in Philistia?
America has learned pretty well
how to do things; the time has
come when it needs to emphasize
the things worth doing. The higher
education must promote, not merely
in the so-called learned professions,
but throughout the world of enter
prise, that largeness of view which
leads to a recognition of values and
that courage which comes from see
ing life steadily and whole. America
stands squarely for the Open Door.
Is our interest mere solicitude for
the American merchant and trader,
or are the real interests of China
and civilization a part of our con
cern? In California we are very busy
displaying our resources. What
is it that our promotion commit
tees are chiefly promoting? Is it a
million-peopled San Francisco that
we should chiefly desire, or is it to
make a city safer and sweeter to
live in, less responsive to the yellow
newspaper and the demagogue?
Mr. James Bryce, keenest of ob
servers and most sympathetic of
critics, seeing our ceaseless rush,
our grasping at the future, the
passion to bring about in a lifetime
what the past took centuries to ac
complish, was moved to exclaim:
"Why in heaven's name this haste?
You have time enough. No enemy
threatens you. No volcano will
rise from beneath you. Why sac
rifice the present to the future, fan
cying you will be happier when
your fields teem with wealth and
your cities with people? In Europe
we have cities wealthier and more
populous than yours, and we are
not happy. Why do things rudely
and ill which need to be done well,
seeing that the welfare of your de
scendants may turn upon them?
Why in your hurry to subdue and
utilize Nature, squander her splen
did gifts? Why allow the nox
ious weeds of Eastern politics to
take root in your soil, when by a
little effort you might keep it pure?
Why hasten the advent of that
threitcning day when the vast
spaces of the continent shall all
have been filled, and the poverty or
discontent of the older states shall
find no outlet? You have oppor
tunities such as mankind never had
before, and may never have again.
Your work is great and noble: it is
done for a future larger and vaster
than our conceptions can embrace.
Why not make its outlines and be
ginnings worthy of these destinies,
the thought of which gilds your
hopes and elevates your purposes?"
Progress is a moral event; and
life is a joint undertaking. The
interrelation of society is beyond
recall: if one member suffer all the
members suffer. We cannot undo
the complexity, but in the common
experience and the common service
life may be in home real way uni
fied. Not complexity, but artifi
ciality and consequent decay of
moral fiber have been the undoing
of nations. Life must be complex,
but it need not be artificial. God's
desire for us is possible for us —
possible in the masterful daring of
youth full-armed and untainted.
The cloister and the desert may
clarify the vision, arm the under
standing, strengthen the purpose
while yet it is morning; they may
become a temporary refuge in the
burning heat of the day. But the
world we work in is not of the des
ert or the high mountains. We
shall not be judged by our success
in retired places and among cloud
capped peaks, hut by how we make
for manhood and sainthood in the
world of men and things. The
mistake of all our Utopias has been
the trying to make life too easy.
Life is up-hill work, and is not to
be conquered on other terms. To
be sincere, to he courageous, to keep
faith and fineness of temper, not to
give in when life surprises us by
becoming hard, and to keep goine
on —this is the only road to any
Utopia worth the having.
After all, the Greek was right.
At the gate of manhood, with clean
lived youth behind, with the poise
of mastery and the vision that
comes from full-rounded knowl
edge, man will not willingly do
wrong. This is the truth that
makes free, the alchemy that trans
mutes knowledge into virtue. The
whole structure of society is built
upon this principle. All the race
has accomplished in its long ascent,
all its hope for the future, all the
plan of God, is staked on this di
vine spark in the human soul. The
educated man's burden is that he
is educated, that he holds his own
self-respect only on the rigid terms
of absolute sincerity, that for him
baseness and power are forever in
compatible. Over and above its
fine training of the instrument the
higher education fuses and synthe
sizes all values; in all the varied
garnering of life its function is to
separate the wheat from the chaff
and to burn the latter with un
quenchable fire.
If the twentieth century shows
little interest in abstract Utopias,
if the happy Republic, the govern
ment without problems,seems only
a "far-off, divine event," too intan
gible for a present program, there
is compensation in the knighthood
which our own fresh contact with
reality, our genuine passion for
sincerity and for usefulness, is
surely developing. The modern
Knight of the Order of Progress
rides no foam-crested steed 'gainst
windmill or moat. Armed
with knowledge become virtue he
does his piece of honest work in
the world, and in the doing it helps
to right the wrong everywhere.
"Musical,
Tremulous, impressional,
Alive to gentle influence
Of landscape and of sky,
And tender to the spirit-touch
Of man's or maiden's eye:
Hut, to his native centre fast,
Shall into Future fuse the Past,
And the world's flowing fates in
his own mould recast."
