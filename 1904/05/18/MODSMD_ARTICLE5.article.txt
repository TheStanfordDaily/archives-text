Today our alumni are increased
in numbers and in spirit by the
graduation of another large class of
Stanford men and women. The
dissemination of the members of
the Class of 1904 throughout this
and foreign countries adds immeas
urably to the prestige of the Uni
versity. The undergraduates who
will remain are satisfied with the
work of their predecessors, and con
eider it worthy of emulation. Hut,
while the graduating class strength
ens the alumni, it must be remem
bered that it also removes the
greater part of the sober senior
sense and influence from under
graduate activities. The Com
mencement exercises today, in a
sense, mark the close of the period
of formation and molding of under
graduate life at Stanford. Through
this period of construction the Class
of 1904 has played a large part,
and has capably met. and overcome
every difficulty. It now remains
for those of us who are left to take
up the work where 1904 left it.
The undergraduate duty now be
comes a perpetuation of the Stan
ford spirit, and a continuance of
the customs outlined by those who
have gone before.
