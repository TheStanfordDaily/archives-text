# "Patience" a Success.
## 
### 
In a highly artistic performance,
marred only by a few details of
minor importance, the Senior class
successfully gave its rendition of
''Patience" in Assembly Hall
Thursday evening. Excellent work
was done by both the principals
and the chorus. Throughout the
opera the songs were well executed,
and scarcely any of them failed to
receive applause. The chorus of
dragoons did particularly well.
Miss Jeraldine Brown scored a
distinct hit as Patience, the village
milkmaid. She not only sang the
part extremely well, but acted it in
a graceful and attractive manner.
Her songs were sung in a very
sweet soprano voice, and never
failed to receive an encore.
The comedy work was well taken
care of by C. H. Baker, '04, as
Bunthorne, and 1). 11. Wilson, '06,
as Lady Jane. Bunthorne's first
appearance on the stage, surround
ed by a group of twenty love-sick
maidens, and Lady Jane's solo on
the viol at the beginning of the sec
ond act, brought down the house,
as did also the clever acting of E.
R. May, '06, in the character of
Archibald Grosvenor.
Miss E. R. Miller, '07, as Lady
Angela, and Miss E. A. Sayre, '06,
as Lady Ella, sung their parts with
great ease, and their brilliant work
in the quintet was one of the most
enjoyable parts of the play. C. L.
Firebaugh, '04, M. L. Van Norden,
'04, and B. R. Cocks, '04, who filled
the other places in the quintet, de
serve especial mention for their
clever work throughout the play.
Financially the opera was suc
cessful, although the seats were by
no means all sold. After paying
all expenses the Senior class will
net a trifle over $600 from the per
formance.
