From
Home
away from the tender, solioitous care
of Mother—at school—studying hard,
exercising harder, accidents will some
times happen. If at home, mother
would use Pond's Extract—the old family
doctor— and the pain would soon vanish
—the injury soon heal. For over (50
years mothers have eased imins and
healed wounds, burnsand bruises with
Pond's Extract and have never been
disappointed in it. There is no remedy
which will take its place—no substitute.
Keep a bottle handy for
quick use. Soothes and
freshens the face after
shaving. Watered
Witch Hazel—a weak
solution— sometimes
offered in place of
Pond's Extract—has no
medicinal value—is
positively wor th 1 ess.
Pond's Extract CURES,
therefore is priceless.
Sold only in sealed bot
tles under buff tcrupper.
ACCEPT IMO SUBSTITUTE.
