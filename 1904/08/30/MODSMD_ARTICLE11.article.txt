With this number the Daily
Palo Alto begins its thirteenth
year as a college newspaper. Dur
ing its twelve years of existence it
has made a gradual growth toward
that efficiency which a college
daily newspaper should attain, and
the growth has been most rapid
during the past three years. Every
editor has profited by the experi
ence of his predecessors, but no
editor has reached the ideal; nor
can the ideal be expected by any
editor for several semesters yet to
come. When the news-gathering
becomes so thoroughly systema
tized that the events which take
place in the University community
will he recorded promptly and
without exception, and when the
editorial column of the paper gives
expression that is in perfect har
mony with the will of the sober
minded majority of the student
body on all matters in which the
Associated Students are concerned,
the paper will have attained the
highest efficiency that can be rea
sonably expected. The purposes
of any college daily should be to
supply its readers with the news of
the institution which it represents,
and to express editorially the most
sound views on student body
affairs. That the Daily Palo Alto
has fulfilled these requirements
fairly well in the past is generally
conceded. That there has been a
constant improvement in fulfilling
these requirements by each suc
ceeding editor is also generally
recognized; and that there is still
room for much further advance
ment of the paper along these lines
is well realized by those who will
direct the policy of the paper dur
ing the coming semester.
The methods outlined by the
last three editors of the Daily
Palo Alto will he carried
out during the next four months.
Whether or not the news field
is successfully covered depends
wholly upon the energy and spirit
of the editorial staff, and the co
operation of those who are in a
position to supply the members of
the reportorial board with the in
formation necessary to make a true
record of college activities and
events. In order to make an ap

pointment to the editorial staff
mean something more than a figure
head, and in order to have the
board made up of the best avail
able material, a limitation to the
number of staff members and close
competition for appointments to
positions on the staff were insti
tuted one year ago by the then
editor-in-chief of the paper. The
good results of these innovations
over the old method of appoint
ment have been so marked that
they may now be considered per
manent features in the manage
ment of the editorial board. Ac
cordingly it is necessary to
announce to those students who
are entering Stanford for the
first time that the member
ship of the staff is limited to fif
teen, and that constant effort com
bined with ordinary ability and
sincerity of purpose are necessary
for a candidate to receive an ap
pointment to the staff. A fair
knowledge of the English language
together with a disposition for
serious and careful work will in
time insure any applicant of an
appointment to the staff, and it is
with pleasure that the present
editor extends an urgent invitation
to all members of the student body
who have any inclination to be
come experienced in college jour
nalism to enter the competition at
once. The reward for work on the
paper is the invaluable experience
which every man who has been
connected with the staff for a rea
sonable time has gained, and the
great opportunity which the work
offers in the way of familiarizing
one with all the various branches
of college activities.
On Friday, September 2d, at
1:30, a meeting of all candidates
for the staff will be held in the
office of the Daily Palo Alto, and
at that time further explanation of
the work will be made. The
period of competition for appoint
ments will begin at once, and elec
tions to the etaff will be announced
on October 15th.
