Attention of all new students is
called to the fact that there are
regular annual student body dues,
which ore to be paid to Treasurer
R. W. Barrett, at the Registrar's
office, immediately after registra
tion is completed. These dues
amount to one dollar a year, and
are supposed to be paid in advance.
They are not compulsory, in that
there is no absolute power to make
members of the student body pay
them. However, the member of
the student body who does not pay
them and who is known not to
have paid them does not stand
high in the estimation of his fellow
students. The money helps defray
the expenses of athletics and other
student body activities, and no
loyal Stanford man or woman will
neglect to pay his or her dollar to
Treasurer Barrett to-morrow.
