# SUCCESSFUL SUMMER SCHOOL.
## Many Stanford Students Attend Greatest Session Ever Held at California. 
### 
Several hundred Stanford stu
dents took advantage of the oppor
tunities for extra work offered this
year at the summer session of the
University of California. This
year's session is declared by the
California University authorities to
be by far the most successful ever
held at Berkeley, both in point of
attendance and in the large number
of eminent scholars and scientists
who conducted courses.
The six weeks' session began
June 27th, and at that time over
one thousand applications had
been received. Of these only 908
actually completed the work, but
even then thia number exceeded by
half a hundred the record-breaking
registration of the previous year.
Of twenty instructors with the
full rank of professor who headed
the staff of the summer school,
twelve were noted scholars from
Eastern and European universities.
Noteworthy among these were the
famous physicist Svanta Arrhenius,
from the University of Stockholm,
and Hugo de Vries, from the Uni
versity of Amsterdam, probably the
greatest living authority on botany.
Both of these men delivered several
courses of lectures.
