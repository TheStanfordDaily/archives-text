# EASTERN TRACK MEET.
## Record of Work Done by Stanford's Representation at Chicago and St. Louis. 
### 
The track team on its Eastern
trip competed at the Conference
Meet at Chicago, June 4th, taking
fifth place with nine points. On
June 11th at St. Louis Stanford's
twenty-seven points took second
place in the Western Intercollegi
ate. All in all, the results of the
meets were disappointments to
Stanford supporters, as the team
did not do so well as had been ex
pected, nor so well as it had done
against California. This was due
principally to the change of cli
mate.
The Conference Meet at Chicago
was the best in many years. Dole
won the pole-vault at 11 feet 6:f
inches, on a very windy day. Hyde
put the shot 44 feet 4f inches, tak
ing second place to Rose of Michi
gan.
At St. Louis the best Stanford
performances were those of Lana
gan and Bell. Captain-elect Bell
won the high jump at 5 feet 9
inches, and the broad jump at 21
feet 6 inches. Lanagan won the
low hurdles in 24:4. In the 120-
yard hurdles Lanagan ran second
in 15 flat, world's record time. The
watches did not agree, so the rec
ord will not be accepted by the
national American Athletic Asso
ciation.
On account of the heat of the
day, Dole failed to take a place in
the pole-vault, though he took sec
ond place in the high jump. Hyde
took first in the shot, and Holman
third in the half.
Though disappointing, the per
formances of the Stanford men
were remarkable when the extreme
change of climate, the wind of Chi
cago, and the heat of St. Louis are
considered.
