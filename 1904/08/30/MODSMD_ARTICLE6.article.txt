# FOOTBALL PROSPECTS BRIGHT.
## Nine Varsity Men Return to Defend Positions on Last Year's Eleven. 
### 
Stanford will start this football
season with better prospects for a
victory in November than has been
the case for a number of years. Of
the twelve men that played in last
year's big game nine will return this
fall, and a majority of the second
team men will be on the field.
The old Varsity men that will re
turn are: Weller, fullback; Dole, left
half; Chalmers, right half; Bans
bach, quarter-back; Thompson, left
guard; Shields and Sprott, tackles;
Clark and Smith, ends. Besides
these men two other Varsity players
will probably try for positions.
They are Bartell, end on the 1902
varsity, and Roosevelt, guard on
the 1901 team, who has not played
since he was injured in the game
with Michigan that year. The men
who played against California last
season, and will not be back, are
Scholfield, fullback; Hauverman,
center; and Jacobs, guard.
The fight for the vacant guard
and center positions will be the
most hotly contested, and a number
of good men will try for these
places. Van Sickle, Hyde and
Monzingo were all promising play
ers for guard last season, and will
be out again this year. Roosevelt
will try for center, as will also Nis
sen, center on last year's second
eleven, and Molfino, the 1907 Fresh
man center.
The Varsity men will find a num
ber of good players trying for their
places. For the halfback positions
Dole, '07, and Brennan will put up
a good game. The latter is much
heavier and stronger than last year.
Stott will not try for the quarter
back position, and this leaves Bans
back, last year's captain, almost
alone in the race. Thompson seems
at present to have no serious rival
for his place at guard. Butterfield,
tackle on the Freshman team last
year, proved a player of ability and
will again be on the field, but Still
man will not be out. An interest
ing struggle will take place for the
ends between Captain Clark, Smith
and Bartell, all Varsity men.
Stanford was weak in punting
last season, but both Dole and
Sprott will no doubt improve this
year. Besides this, the necessity of
relying upon team work, and not
upon individual playing, has be
come a principle of football at
Stanford, and Lanagan will again
carry out this poli-cy. Thus the
coacheß will not have to face the
same problem that they did last
season in training the Varsity play
ers the in rudiments of the game.
A rally will be held in Encina
club-room during the early part of
next week,when the men who intend
to go out for football will register.
Practice will commence not later
than Thursday, September 7th,and
it iB probable that the players will
start a day earlier. Lanagan has
been on the campus, but assistant
coach Erb, the former Stanford
halfback and Columbia quarter
back, has not yet arrived.
Manager Barrett has arranged a
schedule of Varsity games, but
several more contests will probably

be added to the list. All of the
games will take place on the cam
pus excepting the contest with Cali
fornia, which will he played on the
new gridiron that has just been
finished at Berkeley. So far the
games arranged will all be played
on Saturdays except the one with
the Multnomah Athletic Club,
which will take place on a Wednes
day. The schedule of games and
dates arranged to the present date
follows:
September 17th, Olympic Club.
October Ist, Olympic Club.
October Bth, Sherman Indians.
October 12th, Multnomah Club.
October 22d, Nevada.
October 29th, Oregon.
November 12th, California.
