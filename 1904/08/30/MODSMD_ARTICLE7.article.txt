# ERS TO BE ASSISTANT COACH.
## Is Expected to Arrive Here and to Help Lanagan Early in September. 
### 
Wm. Erb, ex-'Ol, the man who
has been chosen to aid Lanagan
this year in coaching the football
team, in a player of wide experience
both at Stanford and in the East.
Erb entered Stanford with the
class of 1901 and played quarter
back on his class team. During
the freshman intercollegiate game,
in which Stanford defeated Cali
fornia by a score of 16 to 8, the
captain was injured and Erb took
charge of the team. During the
seasons of '98 and '99 he was quar
ter-back and captain of the second
eleven, and distinguished himself
for good generalship. The next
season Erb played half on the
Varsity of 1900, which defeated
California by the score of 5 to 0.
This was the team that was coached
by Yost, so that Erb has some of
the methods employed by that
great football expert.
In 1901 Erb went East and in
1902 played on the Columbia var
sity. Here he resumed his old po
sition at quarter-back, and was
also field general of his team. Erb
played in all the principal games
Columbia had with the Eastern
teams that season. Last season he
was engaged by Vanderbilt Univer
sity as head coach, and was about
to take up his duties in that ca
pacity when he was taken ill with
typhoid fever and had to abandon
his plans.
During the summer Erb has
been traveling in Europe and when
last heard of was in Paris. He is
expected on the campus during the
early part of September, when he
will probably take charge of the
Freshman squad.
