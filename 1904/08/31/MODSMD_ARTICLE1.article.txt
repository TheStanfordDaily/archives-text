# SUCCEEDS A.W. SMITH.
## Prof. W.F. Durand from Sibley College to Head Department of Mechanical Engineering. 
### 
Prof. William Frederick Durand,
who comes this year to occupy the
position at the head of the Mechan
ical Engineering department left
vacant by the departure of Prof.
A. W. Smith, has served for the
past ten years in the Sibley College
of Engineering at Cornell, to accept
the directorship of which Professor
Smith left Stanford. Durand was
one of Cornell's most distinguished
professors, and in the unusual ex
change which has taken place it is
a question as to which institution
has come out ahead.
William F. Durand was born at
Bethany, Conn., in 1859, and pur
sued his academic studies at the
Naval Academy at Annapolis,
graduating in 1880. The work
he had done in the academy was
largely in the engineering course,
and after serving three years in
the naval corps he continued his
studies in Lafayette College, receiv
ing his degree of Ph.D. in 1887.
He then permanently left the engi
neering corps and became profes
sor of marine engineering in the
Agricultural and Mechanical Col
lege of the University of Michigan,
in which capacity he acted for four
years.
In 1891 came his first connection
with the Cornell faculty, when he
was released from an appointment
as professor of marine engineering
at Purdue, which he had already
accepted, to become professor of
marine engineering and naval ar
chitecture at Sibley College. This
professorship had not existed at
Cornell up to the time of Professor
Durand's appointment, but under
his guidance it has grown to be one
of the most widely known branches
of Sibley College, and has helped to
make Cornell one of the greatest
schools for naval engineering in the
world.
Besides his work in this depart
ment, Professor Durand was closely
associated with Director Thurston,
and served for years as secretary of
the Sibley faculty. When Thurs
ton died, in October last, Durand
was chosen acting director and
brought the year's work to a suc
cessful conclusion.
While at Cornell Professor Du
rand became closely identified with
student activities, and his loss at
Cornell will be felt very much as
that of Professor Smith will be
noticed at Stanford. For Beveral
years he served on the athletic
council, and last year was chosen
president of that body.
During his residence at Ithaca
Professor Durand published several
books which stamp him as an
authority on naval engineering and
architecture. Notable among his
works is his "Resistance and Pro
pulsion of Ships. 1 ' He is further
known to all students of naval
science from his frequent contribu
tions to the leading scientific mag
azines. He is a life member and
gold medalist of the American So
ciety of Naval Engineers, and of the
Society of Naval Engineers and
Architects.
In addition to the work he has

done at Cornell University, Pro
fessor Durand has done outside
work which lias brought him wide
recognition. For a number of
years he has held the position of
advisory engineer to the great ship
building firm of Cramps at Phila
delphia, while numerous tests made
by him in the hydraulic laboratory
have been of great value to the
shipping interests of this country.
The entire University community
and especially the students who
major in Mechanical Engineering
may well feel elated over the suc
cess of President Jordan in being
able to secure so valuable a man
to succeed Professor Smith.
