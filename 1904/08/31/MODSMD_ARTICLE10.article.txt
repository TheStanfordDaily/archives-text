For the benefit of the strangers
within our gates we may say that
Memorial Church was given to the
University by Mrs. Stanford in
memory of her husband. It is en
tirely non-sectarian in character
and method. The services are
simple and congregational and all
seats are free. There is no mem
bership, students of varied eccle

siastical affiliations finding a com
mon ground in the services. Al
though dedicated but eighteen
months ago the church has taken
a firm place in the affections of the
students, standing as it does for
definite spiritual principles with
out compulsion in the matter of
attendance or creed.
