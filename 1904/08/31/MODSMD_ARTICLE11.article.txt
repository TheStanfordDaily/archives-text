# Mayfield Passes Liquor Law.
## 
### 
Early in the present month the
town trustees of Mayfield passed an
ordinance which will result in
closing the eight saloons of the
town on January 1, 1905, and the
removal of the proverbial relation
which that town has held in Stan
ford life ever since the beginning of
the University. The ordinance
prohibits the sale of beer, wines,
and other alcoholic beverages with
in the town limits, and provides for
wholesale distribution, and for the
serving of drinks with meals during
certain specified hours.
The action of the town trustees
is the culmination of an agitation
carried on for some time past by a
majority of the citizens of Mayfield
against all those things which have
retarded the healthful growth of
the college town. It is expected
that after the ordinance goes into
effect on January 1, 1905, the .town
will rapidly become a desirable
residence district, and finally form
one of the strongest districts of the
University community.
