# Scholarship for Mrs. Matthews.
## 
### 
Mrs. Lois Kimball Matthews,
who received her Master of Arts
degree from Stanford last May, has
been granted a scholarship in his
tory at Hadcliffe College, Cain
bridge, Mass. It was her historical
thesis on "The Spread of Settle
ment in New England from 1620
to 1650," written while at Stanford,
that earned for Mrs. Matthews the
scholarship appointment.
A number of original maps which
accompanied the thesis attracted
the attention of Professors Howard
and Turner of the University of
California. Professor Turner used
the maps in a series of lectures
which he gave at Harvard, and it
was primarily due to his recom
mendation that the scholarship has
been granted.
At Radcliffe Mrs. Matthews will
take up her work in history in the
fall with the intention of taking
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
