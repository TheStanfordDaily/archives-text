# NEW ALUMNI DIRECTORY.
## Interesting Statistics Compiled by C.F. Wright, '96, Regarding University Graduates. 
### 
The Alumni Directory, compiled
by Charles F. Wright, '96, was
published by the University last
May, and is now on sale at the
Bookstore. Although the editor
has been handicapped by the fail
ure of many alumni to respond to
requests for information, the book,
nevertheless, contains much valua
ble and interesting information, it
has an alphabetical list of all
alumni, with their present ad
dresses, and a list by chisses, with
information as to each person's
present occupation. Then follows
a residence index, in which the
alumni are grouped according to
their place of residence.
The statistical summaries are
interesting. Up to May 1, 1904,
the total number of degrees con
ferred was 1892, of which 1215 were
given to men and 677 to women.
Some of these degrees were dupli
cates, so that the total number of
alumni is 1753. The graduating
class of last May added 162 new
names to the roll, making a
total at the present date of 1915.
Of the degrees conferred to Jan
uary, 1904, 1672 were bachelors of
arts, 184 masters of arts, sixteen
doctors of philosophy, thirteen
bachelors of law, and seven engi
neers. The small number of bach
elors of law is explained by the fact
that the degree was not granted
until 1901.
The statistics regarding present
occupations show that teaching is
very far in the lead. More than
one-fourth of all the graduates of
the University are now engaged in
instruction work. This is explained
by the large number of women who
take college work with the special
purpose of preparing for teaching.
The law claims the next largest
number of graduates, while busi
ness life has absorbed many. More
than 100 still remain students.
The figures follow: Teachers, 532;
lawyers, 149; students, 114; busi
ness men, 101; physicians, 58; civil
engineers, 54; miners or mining
engineers, 52; electrical engineers,
49; mechanical engineers, 22;
journalists, 36; Government posi
tions, 26; chemists, 26; ministers,
15; real estate and insurance, 12;
public offices, 11; scientific posi
tions, 10: miscellaneous, 22; no
occupation given, 255.
Under the heading of "occupa
tions" are included deaths and
married women. The figures show
that forty-seven of those to whom
the University degree has been
granted have passed away to
another world. One hundred and
thirty-nine of the women who have
passed through the University, ac
cording to Editor Wright, are now
married, or nearly one of every
four. The editor makes no account
of the number of male graduates
who have married, nor of graduates
who have wedded graduates.
The great majority of graduates
have been Californians. Ten hun
dred and ninety one came from
within the borders of the State.
The State of Washington follows
with sixty-six, and then New York
and Illinois with fifty-three and
thirty-five respectively. Oregon,
Colorado, Pennsylvania, Indiana,
and Massachusetts follow in the
order named. Hawaii sent seven
teen, the Philippines thirteen, and
Alaska two. Of the foreign coun

tries Japan leads with eleven,
followed by Mexico with eight, and
China and Canada with five each.
