# RUSH IN ENCINA HALL.
## Sophomores and Freshmen Meet in a Contestâ€”No One Badly Injured. 
### 
Encina Hall was the scene last
night of the rush between sopho
mores and freshmen which has
been expected for several days.
The affair was conducted without
undue violence and with hardly a
single case of viciousness, and as a
consequence no one was seriously
hurt. As it was generally known
that the Hoard of Trustees and
President Jordan are opposed to
rushes, some effort was made by a
number of upper-classmen to pre
vent the outbreak, but without
success.
The freshmen gathered in the
vestibule of the hall, while the
sophomores met at Encina gym
nasium. Both sides were given
careful instructions that there
should be no use of fists and that
all property should be carefully re
spected. The freshmen numbered
about 75 and the sophomores 50,
and both sides had gathered men
from all over the campus.
A few minutes after the lights
went out at 10:30 o'clock the rush
began. The bathrooms at one end
of Encina's first floor were reserved
for the freshmen, and those at the
other end for the sophomores.
The plan was for the men on each
side to get their opponents to the
tubs and properly ducked, and the
result was some strenuous tussles.
Many on both sides went into the
water, and especially the men who
are regarded as the class leaders,
but the freshmen are generally
credited with the best of the argu
ment as a result of their greater
number. The rush was stopped by
upper-classmen after about an
hour.
