# ADDITION TO GUILD HOSPITAL.
## New Building Will Provide Accommodations for Nearly Forty Patients. 
### 
During the summer many im
provements have been made in the
Guild Hospital, chief of which is
the construction of a large addition
to the present building, which will
increase its capacity very materi
ally. The building proved its in
adequacy during the diphtheria
epidemic last year, when it was
necessary to rent a number of
rooms outside, with a heavy atten
dant expense for rent, nurses, etc.
The building as it then was could
accommodate only about ten per
sons comfortably, so that in cases
of emergency temporary quarters
had to be secured for the overflow.
It was therefore decided to provide
more ample quarters. The special
committee in charge of the work is
composed of the following: Dr. W.
K. Snow, chairman; E. Y. Pomeroy,
'05, treasurer of the Guild; Miss
Helen Crandall, '05, vice-president
of the Guild; and Professors C. H.
Gilbert and A. B. Show.
After suflicient funds had been
raised the committee deliberated
on the advisability of constructing
a new building, but finally decided
to purchase the one occupied last
year, under verj' satisfactory terms
offered, and to build an addition
large enough to meet present re
quirements.
The addition is being built at the
rear of the old hospital. It is to
be 33x41 feet in ground dimen
sions, and a basement and two
stories in height. In the basement
will be a furnace-room, a laundry,
a diet kitchen, a laboratory, a dis
iniecting-room, and store-rooms.
One-half of the first floor will be
arranged for a four-bed ward, and
bath-rooms, service-room, nurses'
room, and a vestibule and large
porch. The other part will have
two two-bed wards, two private
rooms, bath- and service-rooms,
and a room for medical supplies.
On the second floor will be two
large ward-rooms, baths, service
rooms, and rooms for nurses. There
will be a large vestibule into which
beds may be moved to give the
patients sun-baths. Hoth floors
will have food elevators from the
diet kitchen in the basement. Pro
vigion has been made for twenty
beds, and five can be added in case
of necessity, making the capacity
of both buildings suflicient for
thirty-five to forty patients.
The addition will have a shingled
exterior, with rustic base, and will
have an imposing elevation. It is
about ten feet from the old build
ing, but will be connected with it
on both floors by covered bridges.
It. is supplied with many large
windows, giving an abundance of
light. Hoth buildings are to he
heated by furnace and lighted by
electricity.
It is expected that this hospital
will fulfill the needs of the Univer
sity community for some years to
come. But the Guild looks for
ward to the time when sufficient
funds can be secured to have a
building especially designed for
this purpose, located in large
grounds. The present addition is

well under way, and it is expected
that it will be ready for occupancy
in a month or six weeks. Much
credit is due the members of the
committee for the arduous and suc
cessful work they have accom
plished during the summer. Dr.
Snow, as chairman, has been par
ticularly earnest in the work and
is giving much of his time to the
undertaking, for all of which he is
entitled to especial commendation.
The officers who will have charge
of the Guild during the coming
year are: President, 0. S. Lousley,
'05; vice-president, Miss Helen L.
Crandall, '05; secretary, N. E.
Dole, '04; treasurer, E. Y. Pom
eroy, '05. The general plan of the
board is to operate the hospital
along practically the same lines as
last year. All students of the Uni
versity are eligible to membership
in the Guild, and are required to
pay a semester fee of two dollars.
This entitles them to the privileges
of the hospital at the rate of one
dollar .per day. This rate includes
room, board, stock drugs, and the
attendance of the hospital nurses.
The charge of one dollar per day
for hospital care is designed only
to cover the average cost of room
and board. The expenses incident
to the hospital service and equip
ment are met by the semester fees.
The increase of the semester fee
from one to two dollars has been
found necessary in order to main
tain the low rate of hospital
charge.
With the increased facilities the
hospital is now able to care for any
emergency, and by means of the
isolated wards can handle conta
gious diseases without inconven
ience.
