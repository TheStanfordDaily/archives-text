# Repairs on Oval.
## 
### 
In preparation for the opening of
the football season, work was com
menced on the oval several days
a go. The grass and weeds have
heen burned from the gridiron, and
the ground is now being harrowed.
At present the field is in fair shape,
but to avoid the possibility of acci
dent from hard ground more saw
dust will be added.
The rubbing-shed has been ex
tended about fifteen feet. Addi
tional rubbing-tables will be placed
in the shed, and a new stove will
be added to the equipment.
The practice of employing stu
dent rubbers, as inaugurated last
year, will be continued this season.
Coach Lanagan has expressed him
self as much pleased with the sys
tem, which enables the players to
receive immediate attention on
leaving the field.
The schedule for Varsity games
is not yet complete, but Treasurer
Barrett is now negotiating for games
on the vacant dates, and it is very
probable that they soon will be
filled. September 23d :md Novem
ber sth are the dates still open.
