From a number of 750 old stu
dents who had registered up to five
o'clock last evening, Treasurer Bar
rett had received 574 student body
dues, it may he well to remind
the 17(3 students who managed to
slip out the door of the Registrar's
office that it is still not too late to
return to the place of registration
or to the office of Treasurer Barrett
and meet their just obligations in
this matter of student body dues.
The payment of one dollar each
year is not a hardship to any indi
vidual, yet when taken in the ag
gregate it means a considerable
addition to the finances of the
Associated Students. That there
should be nearly twenty-five per
cent of the first seven hundred and
fifty old students registering either
to carelessly or intentionally avoid
the Treasurer's desk yesterday is
certainly cause for some thought.
If the percentage of delinquents
continues to be as high as it was
yesterday, and if the old students
continue to 6et such a deplorable
example for the freshmen, there can
be but one result. That result will
be the disfranchising at all student
body elections of all those who
have not paid their yearly dues.
At present it is impossible to state
what percentage of delinquents
were men and what percentage
were women, but when' registration
is completed the Daily Palo Alto
will take particular pains to in
quire into the matter and discover
as far as possible just who the de
linquents are, in order that the
more loyal members of the student
body may be able to apply some
remedy.
