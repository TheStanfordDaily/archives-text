YOUR EYES
and your success in school are so closely related
that you cannot afford to neglect them in the
least. At the flrst sign of fatigue or failure
you should come to us for an examination.
Many students attempt to go through school
suffering from headache, nervousness, indiges
tion, neuralgia, vertigo, and many other afflic
tions which are often caused by eye-strain, and
which may be permanently relieved by properly
fitted glasses.
If there's the least question about your eyes,
any ache, or pain, or blur, you should consult us
at once. Appointments will be made at any
time to suit your convenience.
We guarantee entire satisfaction.
