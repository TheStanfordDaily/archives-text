During the summer the work of
putting in the mosaic in Memorial
Church has been progressing
steadily. The design in the organ
loft is now comlpeted and the scaf
folding has been removed. The
pattern consists of a field of gold
set with blue stars, creating a beau
tiful effect.
Scaffolding has been erected in
the east and west transepts and
galleries, preparatory to putting in
extensive mosaic designs. The
mosaic on the front of the church
will also be added to or changed in
the near future. The work now
under way will require about six
months for completion.
