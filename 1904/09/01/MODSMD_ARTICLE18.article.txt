# FEW OLD MEN RETURN.
## California Loses at Least Six of Her Players on the Last Varsity. 
### 
The University of California foot
ball squad has commenced prac
tice on the new lield completed
during the summer on the Hillegas
tract. The outlook for a victorious
team is not so bright as it was last
year, but there seems plenty of ma
terial from which James Hopper,
the coach, may develop a winning
team.
Of last season's varsity, Overall,
captain and right guard; Hudson,
left end; Stow, left guard; More,
quarter-back; Whipple, right half;
and Mini, left half, will not return.
The only men who have made their
big "C" in football and have re
ported for practice this season are:
Stroud, captain and center; How
ard, left tackle; and Stern, full
back. More old varsity players
are expected to turn out for prac
tice before the season is far ad
vanced. Among these are Demer
ritt, left end; Snedigar, right half;
and Force, fullback.
California may have two former
Dartmouth players in her line-up
this season. They are Sabin, end,
and Belknap, quarter-back. Bel
knap played quarter-back on the
Reliance team during part of last
season, and showed himself to be a
good man at his position.
Heitmuller, the big tackle who
was largely responsible for the tie
score in the big game last year, had
an attack of appendicitis during
the summer and is at present not
able to enter the game, but it seems
probable that he will turn out in
time to get into shape for the big
contest.
Force and Stern were last year's
fullbacks, hut it is likely that the
former will play a line position
this fall. At present it seems that
California will be weakest in the
guard positions. The places left
vacant by Stow and Overall will be
hard to fill. These are the men
who have done the kicking for Cal
ifornia for several years past, Over
all at punting and place-kicking,
and Stow at the kick-offs. A new
punter will have to be developed
by the Blue and Gold coach.
James Hopper, who has been
chosen head coach at California,
has had a varied career as a foot
ball player. He was a member of
the team that defeated the Stanford
Freshmen in 1894, and he played
end in '97, when the California
varsity was defeated by the score
of 28 to 0. In '99 he was quarter
back on the victorious California
varsity. In 1900 he coached Ne
vada, which defeated Stanford 6 to
0. The next, year he was assistant
coach of the California team that
won the intercollegiate contest by
the score of 2 to 0.
F. G. Greisberg was yesterday
chosen to assist Coach Hopper.
Greisberg played guard on the
California teams of 1898 and 1899.
In 1897 he played fullback, but his
best playing was done in the line
in the two succeeding years. Bart
Thane, who played quarter-back
on California's '98 eleven, has also
volunteered to assist Head-Coach
Hopper.
