# NEW LIBRARY BUILDING BEGUN.
## Structure Will Be Among Largest and Most Imposing of Stanford's Edifices.â€”Will Be Completed in Two Years. 
### 
The foundations of the new Uni
versity Library, the last of the
large structures to be built to com
plete the structural scheme as origi
nally planned by the founders of
the University, are now well under
way, and the work will be contin
ued as rapidly as possible. Ground
for the new Library was broken on
January 1, 1904, but the actual

work of laying the foundations was j
not begun until June 16th. The
progress made since then is regard
ed as very satisfactory. It will
probably be some time yet before
things are ready for the laying of j
the cornerstone, a ceremony which,
it is understood, will be largely
under the direction of the student
body.
In style of architecture the new
Library will combine the Spanish
of the buildings of the quadrangle
with the Romanesque of the gym
nasium, and in general appearance
will be much more ornate than
any of the other buildings of the
University. The ground dimen
sions of the main structure will be
304 feet in length, with a width
through the wings of 98 feet and
through the stack-room of 200 feet.
The circular addition to the rear
embracing this stack-room will
have a diameter of 132 feet. In
height the building will be three
stories and basement, surmounted
by a beautiful glass dome 90 feet
in diameter, which will afford ex
cellent light to the general reading
room below. The total height
from the ground-line to the top of
the dome will be 141 feet.
Two entrances, one at each end
of the front of the building, will
lead into the first floor. In the
wings of this floor will bewaiting
and conversation-rooms, the cata
loging department and general
reference-rooms. In the central
portion, directly beneath the great
dome, will be located the general
reading- and study-room, which
will be circular in form. Directly
back of this, in the semicircular
addition, will be the great stack
room, the stacks radiating away
from the delivery desk in the man
ner found in the best libraries of
the world. The shelf capacity here
alone will be over 100,000 volumes.
Marble stairways will lead to the
second floor, which will be devoted
to a large number of seminar
rooms and special libraries belong

ing to the various departments.
The floors of the rooms will be of
oak, while the corridors will be
laid with tiles. The third floor
will be divided into rooms, which
have not yet been assigned to any
special use. The basement will be
finished in concrete and will be
fitted with a book-bindery, pack
ing-rooms and iron stacks, which

will be used for the accommodation
of an immense number of Govern
ment documents and similar vol
umes.
The plans for the new building
were drawn by Clinton Day, the
well-known San Francisco archi
tect, but the erection of the struc
ture will be entirely under the
supervision of C. E. Hodges, the
resident architect of the Univer
sity, who is also the architect for
the Gymnasium and the Museum.
The contract for the laying of the
foundations calls for an expendi
ture of $25,000, and the cost of the
stone and brick work will he
$217,241. The cost of the interior
decoration and equipment of the
new structure will probably in
crease the entire cost to about
$600,000.
