# FISH COMMISSION EXPEDITIONS
## Three Parties of Stanford Scientists Did Summer Work for the Government. 
### 
Early in the summer two mem
bers of the Stanford faculty were
appointed to assist in a scientific
investigation of the golden trout
and other species of fish found in
the streams of the country lying
about Mt. Whitney. The party
was in charge of Dr. Barton \V.
Evermann,chief ichthyologist of the
United States Fish Commission.
The trip, which lasted five weeks,
was most successful from a scien-

tifie point of view, but the
party accomplished its
work only after many haz
ardous experiences and
with extreme difficulty,
owing to the rough charac
ter of the country which
had to be traversed.
The expedition was sent
out about the first of July,
at the special request of
President, Roosevelt whose
attention had been called to
the gradual destruction of
the golden trout by Stewart
Edward White, author of
"The Blazed Trail." The

danger of extermination of the
trout resulted mostly from fish
ing done by camping parties
which have been frequenting
the Mt. Whitney region during the
past few years ; and that some
measures of protection might be
adopted to preserve the species, the
United States Fish Commission
acted on the President's suggestion
immediately, and a scientific party
composed of Dr. Evermann, Profes
sors It. L. Green and 0. P. Jenkins
of Stanford, Professor Chancy Ju
day of the University of Colorado,
and Captain Charles B. Hudson,
scientific artist in the employ of
the Fish Commission, was sent out
to determine the present distribu
tion of the golden trout, in what
streams it is now found, into what
streams it has been transplanted,
into what additional ones it might
be introduced, and whether the
species can be propagated artifi
cially. All these questions were
successfully determined and were
embodied in a report to the United
States Fish Commission at Wash
ington. The party during its
labors frequently consulted Dr.
Jordan concerning the work.
Drs. Evermann and Jenkins de
voted their attention to the biolog
ical and fish-cultural problems
involved, and to the geographic
distribution of the species. Pro
fessor Juday made a special inves
tigation of the food and feeding
habits of the trout, while Captain
Hudson made several drawings
and paintings of the fish in life
colors. Professor Green compiled
valuable data on the value and
temperature of the water in the
various streams, and made some
important measurements of the
different altitudes in which the fish
were found.
Another expedition went into
the lake region of southern Oregon,
for the purpose of making a care
ful survey of the country. For
several years the United States
Fish Commission has been carry
ing on the work of examining the
streams of the Pacific Coast. Un
der the direction of Mr. George M.
Bowers the tributaries of the Co
lumbia, Colorado, and Sacramento
rivers have been surveyed, as well
as the smaller coast streams. A
preliminary survey of the Oregon
streams had been made by Dr. B.
W. Evermann, the ichthyologist of
the United States Fish Commission.
The results gained were putin the
hands of Assistant Professor J. O.
Snyder, of the Zoology department,
and the more extended survey of
the past summer was only a con
tinuation of the previous work.
The party consisted of Assistant
Professor Snyder, Zoological Cura
tor E. C. Starks, and E. L. Morris,
'04. Over forty days were spent
on the trip, twelve hundred miles
being covered by team. Fish from
the lakes and streams of about
twenty-five localities were taken
aB specimens of the fish fauna of
the region.
A report of the results of the ex
pedition will be written by Dr.
Snyder. It will treat of the rela
tion of the fish in the various iso
lated lakes to each other and to the
fish of the coast streams. The col
lection will eventually be forwarded
to the Bureau of Fisheries at Wash
ington, D. C., a complete set of
specimens being retained at the
Universitv.
