If we are to profit by experience
a careful perusal of the financial
report of the track team's Eastern
trip, which is printed in another
column, may be of some assistance.
The trip cost in the neighborhood
of fifteen hundred dollars, one-third
of which came from the treasury of
the Associated Students. The trip
was carefully managed, and no
money was wasted. Another trip
could not be made for less money.
The question that arises is whether
or not the benefits derived from
sending the team East are great
enough to offset the financial ex
penditure. Another question is
whether it is possible to send a
bunch of track athletes from the
Coast to the East and have them
do as well as they have done at
home. If the Stanford track ath
letes had equalled, or nearly
equalled, their previous records no
one would hesitate in saying that
the trip was successful. But, the
men as a whole did not begin to
make the showing they did on the
Coast. This, no doubt, may be
partly attributed to a change of
climate and strange surroundings,
but it was also due very largely to
the absence of a trainer. The men
were no doubt strict in the matter
of the more common training rules,
but proper dieting was no doubt
neglected when the men were not
under the eye of Trainer Moulton.
A trainer was more necessary on
the trip than a manager, and had
Moulton been sent with the team
the result would have been different.
However that may,be Stanford has
tried an experiment which cost
much money and did not profit a
great deal. It has been an experi
ence that should be borne in mind
when a similar project is advanced.
If another team is sent East it should
go under the direction of a trainer.
At least that seem√ü to be the gen
eral feeling among those who have
closely followed the recent trip and
its results.
