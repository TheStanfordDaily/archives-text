It seems to be an invariable rule
that every incoming Freshman
class shall furnish material for a
ridiculous exhibition of gullibility.
The happenings of to-day were as
pitiable a display of greenness as
has ever been witnessed on the
campus. It is true that such
affairs afford a certain amount of
amusement to a great number of
older students, but there is a more
serious side to the matter than is
realized on first thought. Those
who conduct the gullible candidate
through his foolish performances
do not stop to think of the results.
The amusement which they gain
does not offset the injustice which
they do the unsuspecting freshman,
and the stigma with which they
brand him and which he will carry
throughout his college career. An
average man can not live down a
mistake as grave as that made to
day. A movement on the part of
the students themselves to do away
with such practice in the future
would save many an embarrassing
moment for those whose ignorance
of college affairs and the lack of
advising friends lead them to make
mistakes.
