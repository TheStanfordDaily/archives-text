# First Number of "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The first number of the Chaparral
for the current year, which was on
Hale to-day, marks the beginning of
I). M. Reynold's editorship of the
humorous paper. Although smaller
than the average, the present num
ber contains some very creditable
work. The first poem, in a serious
vein, is good, and the " Fable of
the Sub-Freshman" is an amusing
monologue.
Editorially the issue treats hu
morously the "holdovers," and
the improvements finished dur
ing the past summer, while the
second "now that" congratulates
the University on the acquisition
of Erb for assistant football coach.
Although there are indications of
hurried preparation of material,the
issue as a whole is good.
