# Dormitories Well Filled.
## 
### 
Every room in Encina Hall has
been signed for, and there are still
men on the waiting list. Although
the exact number of students resid
ing in Encina is not yet known, it
is estimated that at least three
hundred men are now rooming in
the dormitory.
The plan of keeping the electric
lights on until twelve o'clock is to
be continued this semester. Last
semester the arrangement worked
satisfactorily to all concerned. It
is understood that the men in the
Hall will turn out their lights
when leaving their rooms, thus sav
ing any waste of power.
The register at Roble Hall shows
no decrease in the number of stu
dents in the dormitory. There are
one hundred girls already regis
tered, thus leaving room for only
four more. Of this number there
are sixty-three old students and
thirty-seven freshmen. iMrs. H. S.
Blynn has been re-appointed ma
tron.
