# TRACK ATHLETICS.
## Outlook for 1905 Cardinal Team Far from Discouraging.â€”Many New Men. 
### 
Trainer Moulton feels highly en
couraged in regard to track pros
pects for next year, as a result of
the advent of a number of promi
nent Freshman track athletes. The
most hopeful feature, perhaps, is
that the new men will be strongest
in the events left weakest by the
departure of old men.
Of the twelve point-winners of
the last intercollegiate meet, Dole,
Dunn, Hyde, Holman, Beach,
Hamilton, and probably Henley
will not compete next year. Lan
agan will graduate at the end of
the present semester, and in all
probability will not remain in col
lege for the track season. Captain
Bell. Crawford, West, and McFar
land, together with Weller of the
1902 track team, will furnish a
nucleus for next year's team.
It has always been Trainer
Moulton's policy that one year's
second team is next year's first
team. There were many men on
last year's team who did not make
points, but who may be relied on
for next year. Among them are
Crossman, '05, Bounds, '05, Ball,
'06, El well, '07, and Freeman, '06.
The team should receive valuable
assistance from the coaching of the
veterans, who, though not eligible
to compete, will be registered in
college. Norman Dole, O. E. Hyde,
Fred Holman,and more especially
J. C. McCaughern, will be of great
help in the development of new
men. On the Eastern trip, the
men learned many new things
which may be of value and which
can be applied to conditions at
Stanford.
The Freshman team will include
many preparatory school stars.
Cope, from the Lick high school,
San Francisco, will run the 100
and 220. Miller, the Bakersfield
distance man, won the mile in the
P. A. A. meet April 23d, in 4:39.
Horton of Ukiah has a creditable
record in the Academic League in
hurdles and weights. Gartzman
from Los Angeles and Cadwalader
from the preparatory department
of Pomona College are perhaps
Gope's equals in the sprints. Ab
bott of the Lowell high school, San
Francisco, has done the quarter in
54 1-5. From Pasadena comes
Severy, who took second in the
Hearst interscholastic meets at St.
Louis. Pemberton of San Fran
cisco and Gay of Redlands may be
expected to do good work in the
high jump. Besides Miller, Bakers
field sends Harmin and Myers,who
will try weights and distances.
At Christmas a brother of M. J.
Weller enters from Ukiah. He is
said to be good in the mile and
quarter.
From the previous showings of
these Freshmen the first-year class
should take first or second place in
the interclass meet next year.
Of the men mentioned, Horton,
Pemberton, Miller, Myers, Har
mon and Cadwalader are football
men of repute.
The last two days a number of
these Freshmen have been on the
track in the afternoon, having light
practice in the weights, the jumps,
hurdles and the short distances.
