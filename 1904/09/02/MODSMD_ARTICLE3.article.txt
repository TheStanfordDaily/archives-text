# Freshman President Elected.
## 
### 
After several hundred upper class
inen and freslnnen had assembled
at the chapel at one o'clock this
afternoon to elect a president for
the incoming class of 1908, the
meeting was adjourned to the base
ball diamond, and the election held
there will probably go down as one
of the most amusing in the histor}'
of Freshman presidents. The meet
ing was called to order by President
C. A. Beardsley of the Junior class,
with E.C. Rittenhouse as secretary
Several candidates for the position
were brought forward, but finally
E. W. Itust, '08, of Pasadena, was
elected by acclamation, and he sub
sequently proved his right to the
distinction beyond a doubt.
After the election had taken
place, and speeches had been lis
tened to from the newly elected
president and some of the unsuc
cessful candidates, a procession was
formed. The long line moved to
Roble Hall, where a cordial recep
tion awaited it from the residents
of the dormitory, and from I)r.
Jordan. President Rust received a
large bouquet of flowers, for which
he expressed profuse thanks.
The procession then formed once
more and counter-marched, stop
ping at the post-office long enough
for some pictures to be taken, and
at the Delta Gamma house, in
order that Rust might not overlook
the sororities in thanking everyone
for the honor thrust upon him. It
next proceeded to Encina,where the
president was given the opportunity
of proving his ability as a reader
and a vocalist. He was tried out
for the Freshman football team,and
awarded a varsity "S" by acclama
tion, and after undergoing a severe
physical examination was allowed
to retire.
Mr. Culver, of San Jose, also of
the class of '08, acted as class yell
leader. Messrs. Whitman and Cul
ver were very acceptable, if not suc
cessful, candidates for the office of
president. Later in the evening
Rust was initiated into a fake fra
ternity.
