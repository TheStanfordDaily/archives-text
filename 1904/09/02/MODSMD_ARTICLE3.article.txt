# Freshman President Elected.
## 
### 
After several hundred upper class
inen and freslnnen had assembled
at the chapel at one o'clock this
afternoon to elect a president for
the incoming class of 1908, the
meeting was adjourned to the base
ball diamond, and the election held
there will probably go down as one
of the most amusing in the histor}'
of Freshman presidents. The meet
ing was called to order by President
C. A. Beardsley of the Junior class,
with E.C. Rittenhouse as secretary
Several candidates for the position
were brought forward, but finally
E. W. Itust, '08, of Pasadena, was
elected by acclamation, and he sub
sequently proved his right to the
distinction beyond a doubt.
After the election had taken
place, and speeches had been lis
tened to from the newly elected
president and some of the unsuc
cessful candidates, a procession was
formed. The long line moved to
Roble Hall, where a cordial recep
tion awaited it from the residents
of the dormitory, and from I)r.
Jordan. President Rust received a
large bouquet of flowers, for which
he expressed profuse thanks.
