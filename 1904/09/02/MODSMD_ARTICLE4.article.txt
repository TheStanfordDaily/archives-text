# CHAUCER DICTIONARY.
## Complete List of Staff. â€” Progress of the Undertaking to Date. 
### 
Miss Alice Kim hall,'o4, has been
appointed to fill the vacancy on
the Chaucer Dictionary staff
caused by the resignation of Ya
sunosuke Fukukita, '04, who has
received the appointment to the
Harvard Club scholarship. While
in college Miss Kimball was an
English major, and was prominent
in literary lines, being a member
of the English Club, an associate
editor of the '04 Quad, and author
of last year's prize football song,
"The Cardinal." She is a member
of the Delta Gamma sorority. The
appointment of Miss Kimball com
pletes the staff for the compilation
of the dictionary. In addition to
Dr. E. Fliigel, editor-in-chief, and
Instructor E. K. Putnam, first
assistant, who have been granted
leave of absence from the Univer
sity, the stuff will consist of Mr. E.
P. Anderson, second assistant, and
Miss Mason and Miss Kimball,
copyists.
The reason the staff is so large
now is to get all the material in
shape as soon as possible, in order
that the individual words may be
ready for study by Dr. Fliigel be
fore he goes to Europe to examine
a number of the unpublished
Chaucer manuscripts, some of
which may throw light on doubt
ful meanings.
When this dictionary is finally
printed it will mean the comple
tion of the work begun by the
Chaucer Society of England at the
time of the publication of its edi
tion of the Canterbury Tales. Slips
were then written for a Chaucer
concordance to be published by the
society. These slips were turned
over to Dr. Fliigel shortly before he
came to America to accept the
chair of English Philology at Stan
ford. Since he has been at Stan
ford Dr. Fliigel has continued the
work on these slips, adding the
readings of other manuscripts, and
making them complete for the
words in all of Chaucer's writings.
The magnitude of the undertaking
will be appreciated when it is un
derstood that Chaucer's writings
contain over 400,000 words, each of
which is entered on a separate slip,
with its context., variance, and ref
erence. Dr. Fliigel is also collect
ing and having entered on slips
material from other Middle English
and Old French writers, which will
throw light on Chaucer's use of
words. Until this year Dr. Fliigel
has been giving the dictionary
what time he could spare from his
University instruction, and has
been aided by many volunteers
among his graduate students.
Recognizing the importance of
the undertaking and realizing that
it would be many years before it
could be completed without assist
ance, the Carnegie Institute has
made sufficient grant to enable Dr.
Fliigel to devote his entire time
and energy to the work and to se
cure the necessary help.
When finally printed the diction
ary will be more complete than
any similar work. The reason
why work of this sort is done for

Chaucer is partially on account of
interest in him as one of the great
est narrative poets, but largely on
account of the importance of his
writings in the history of the Eng
lish language. He came at a per
iod when the Anglo-Saxon and
Norman French elements were be
coming finally amalgamated into
modern English. Chaucer's usage
is therefore necessary for a study
of the life history of words and
idioms. Oftentimes, for instance,
the meaning of a word in Chaucer
throws light on some obscure pass
age in Shakspere.
In the printed dictionary there
will be comprehensive entry for
each of the 17,000 or more words.
This will give the spelling, form,
accent, and rime of the word, with
variance according to the seven
published manuscripts. The ety
mology of the word will be briefly
given. Especial attention will be
paid to the meaning of the word.
Under this head will be complete
references to all examples of its use
in Chaucer, and when necessary
references to other Middle English,
Old French, or Mediaeval Latin
writers when these would throw
light on the meaning in Chaucer.
The dictionary will therefore be
come not merely a Chaucer con
cordance, but also practically a
dictionary of the English language
at the end of the 14th century.
During the three years that Dr.
Fliigel expects to be engaged with
the dictionary he will not give in
struction in the University. Dur
ing the present year the only
courses to be given in English
Philology will be the Anglo-
Saxon by Assistant Professors Sew
ard and Alden, and the Elementary
Chaucer by Instructor Putnam
during the second semester.
