# ERB WILL NOT COACH.
## Several New Assistants to Lanagan Will Be Chosen for the Coming Season. 
### 
In a private letter to a friend in
San Francisco, which was received
yesterday, William Erb, ex-'Ol,
stated positively that he would not
coach at Stanford this fall. Erb
said that it was not probable that
he would visit this Coast at all this
year, as his business would keep
him in the East, making it impos
sible for him to leave. During the
summer months Erb has been trav
eling in Europe, and this is the
first word that has been heard
from him since last semester.
No written contract to coach this
fall was ever signed by Erb, but
last year's student body treasurer
had an understanding with him
that he was to assist Lanagan this
fall. Manager Barrett, when he
received no word from the former
Stanford halfback, began to doubt
whether Erb intended to coach,and
commenced looking about for a
man to help Lanagan, in the event
of Erb not taking up his duties.
Barrett has several former Stanford
players in view, and arrangements
are now being made with these
men. It is intended to select three
or four old football players who can
lend their assistance at different
times during the season.
Erb had had considerable ex
perience in the backfield and would
have been a valuable man, but the
plan of having a number of men
some of whom have played in the
line and some at the backfield
positions will probably give better
results.
