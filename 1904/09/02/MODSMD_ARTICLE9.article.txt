# New Crematory Built.
## 
### 
Early this summer a large garb
age crematory was built in the
foothills near the rock quarry.
The crematory, which is situated
about a mile from the University
campus, is built on the most mod
ern plans. There is a large oven
and all other up-to-date facilities
for disposing of garbage.
The construction of this crema
tory is a very important improve
ment over the former method of
disposing of the campus refuse.
On account of its size and modern
improvements the new crematory
will be large enough to fill the
needs of the community for years
to come.
