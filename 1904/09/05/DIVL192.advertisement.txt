EYES AND DOLLARS
Botli good things to liave.
Both hard to do without.
Both are usually well cared for by
sensible people.
When you spend your money for eye
care bear in mind that we charge no
more for the best optical service than
you pay a peddler or storekeeper for
letting you "guess" at your own correc
tion.
We examine your eyes carefully, ex
plain your case honestly, set a reason
able price, and then you do as you
please. Come and SEE.
Don't put it off too long.
Your eyes are of more value than
your dollars.
