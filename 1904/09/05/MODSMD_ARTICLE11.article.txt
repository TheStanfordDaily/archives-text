The annual reception to the
Freshmen by the Christian Associ

The principal feature of the
evening was Dr. Jordan's address
of welcome to the Freshmen. He
outlined the policy of the Univer
sity regarding the regulations and
requirements, and told what kind
of students are wanted and what
kind are not wanted. He- assured
the Freshmen that they will be
come more attached to the Univer
sity the longer they stay. He said
that the institution iB just emerg
ing from the "stone age," and the
buildings now in the course of con
struction are expected to be com
pleted within a year. Then the
University will begin on its life
proper. The immense income, the
bulk of which is now being used
for building, will be devoted entire
ly to the building-up of the de
partments, to the hiring of more
professors, the adding of new
departments, and the securing of
equipment and apparatus which
shall make the University the best
in the country in its departments
and instruction, as well as in its
buildings. The present Freshman
class will benefit largely from the
new era. are doubly fortu
nate, as they will also have a taste
of the transitional period, the
building period, which has charac
terized the University during the
thirteen years of its existence.
