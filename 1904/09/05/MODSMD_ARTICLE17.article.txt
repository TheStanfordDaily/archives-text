The present generation of Stan
for undergraduates has never seen
a Varsity football season open un
der more auspicious conditions
than that which will be inaugu
rated in Encina Hall to-morrow
evening. Everybody seems unani
mous in the feeling that this year
will be a banner football year for
the Cardinal. Everything points
to success. Possibly nine and cer
tainly seven of last year's team
will be among those who sign the
roll to-morrow night. These men
will take on to the field what they
learned from Lanagan last year.
They will go onto the field with
the knowledge that Stanford has
not won a Varsity game while the
class of 1905 has heen in college,
and with the feeling that this year
offers an opportunity for unusual
success. The men who sign the
roll to-morrow night will go into
their work backed by a student
body that is in perfect harmony in
every phase of activity. The spirit
of 44 all together lustily" is as
marked this year as it ever has
been. All these things seem to
constitute the elements necessary
to success. But, there is one thing
more which is as good an omen as
could be hoped for, and that is the
fact that Lanagan is here to take
up the work where he left off last
year, and to once more throw his
wonderful personality into the
game. He has the support of
every man and woman in the stu
dent body; his players have the
same support; the result cannot
but be a happy one.
There are always a number of
men who work hard throughout a
football season and are not re
warded with a Varsity emblem, —
those are the men of the second
team; and to them great credit is
due —in fact, more credit than they
often receive. However that may
be, no one who has the physical
requirements can do his duty by
his University and at the same
time not sign the football roll to
morrow night. Even if there be
small chance for a man to make the
team, he should get out. If he does

not make either the Freshman or
Varsity elevens his assistance in
practice will nevertheless be inval
uable. However, in signing up for
football a man takes a certain obli
gation in regard to training rules.
If he cannot live up to them
it is far better for him to stay
off the field. This principle of
keeping training regulations to
the letter is one that is
now well rooted in Stanford's
athletics, and it may be well
to call the attention of the Fresh
men to the fact that a man who
goes on the football field and does
not adhere strictly to the prescribed
rules is not only thrown off the
squad, but bis name is published
and he himself is cast into disre
pute by his fellow students.
