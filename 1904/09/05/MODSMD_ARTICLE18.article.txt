# Services in Memorial Church.

Chaplain Gardner preached the
matriculate sermon in Memorial
Church Sunday morning. He con
fined his talk principally to a dis
cussion, for the benefit of the new
students, of the nature of the Me
morial Church, its founding, it ob
ject, and its place in the University.
The church was planned by the
Founders as a regular part of the
University,to fill a place and round
out the education of the student in
a way which could not be done in
the class-room. As the class-room
and gymnasium are to provide for
intellectual, practical and physical
development, so is the church to
administer to the spiritual side.
Like all other Stanford institutions
attendance at the church services
is entirely optional: it is placed for
those who wish to take advantage
of it. But in order that all may be
encouraged to look to their spiritual
advancement nothing has been
spared to make this edifice as at
tractive and impressive as poss
ible.
The church shall always be abso
lutely non-sectarian in character,
and nothing but the simple gospel
and philosophy which is common
to all Christian sects shall be
preached. It is intended thus that
members of all denominations may
meet here at a common service
which shall in no way disaccord
with their own convictions. With
this in view prominent ministers
from all denominations are brought
here to preach at the morning ser
vice.
Dr. Gardner disclaimed any
tendency, of which the church has
sometimes been accused, to teach
doctrines contrary to those which
are advanced by the scientific de
partments of the University. He
emphasized the fact that there need
be no discord between the church
and the sciences, as their spheres
are entirely different, and that the
one supplies a place which the other
cannot fill. The church from its
standpoint of faith takes up and
answers questions which science
from its standpoint of material
things and conditions is unable to
handle. So in this, a seat of the
most advanced scientific thought,
the church is placed to teach that
the two branches can be and are to
be reconciled, without aifecting the
principles or teachings of either.
