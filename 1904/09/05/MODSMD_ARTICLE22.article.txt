# Student Body Assessments.
## 
### 
Of the 1807 students registered
in .Stanford this semester 1079
have paid their student body as
sessment. This number has never
before been equalled or even close
ly approached. The women stu
dents, who have hitherto been very
lax in meeting this obligation,were
as prompt as the men in paying
their dollar to aid student activi
ties. Those students who have not
yet paid their assessment will have
the opportunity to do so any after
noon between 1 and 2 at Treasurer
Barrett's office in Encina gym
nasium.
