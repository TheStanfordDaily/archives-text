# GAME WITH NAVAL CADETS.
## Match with Sailors to Fill Open Date of Saturday, September 24th. 
### 
Treasurer Barrett has almost
completed negotiations with the
manager of the football team from
the Naval Training School at Goat
Island for a match with the Var
sity on September 24th, the first of
the two dates which still remain
open.
The sailors have a heavy team,
and they will have the benefit of
coaching from several of their in
structors who have played on the
Annapolis eleven.
Manager Barrett has experienced
considerable difficulty in tilling the
September dates, since compara
tively few clubs are organized so
early in the season. The Goat
Island game seems a certainty, and
this will complete the schedule for
the present month.
The appointment of an assistant
coach to take the place of Erb, who
is unable to assume the position, is
still a matter of speculation. Both
manager and coach announce that
the vacancy will be acceptably
filled before the season is well
under way. In the meantime the
team will not suffer for lack of
coaching, as there are several ex-
Varsity men in the vicinity of the
University, who have volunteered
their services.
New goal-posts were erected, and
the field thoroughly soaked with
water this afternoon in preparation
for active practice, which begins
Wednesday afternoon.
The old football men will receive
their outfits Tuesday morning be
tween 9 and 12, and the new men
will call for their suits between 1
and 4 the same (lav.
