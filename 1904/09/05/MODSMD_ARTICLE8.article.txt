# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY PLANS.
## First Student Body Meeting to be Addressed by Dr. Jordan and J.F. Lanagan. 
### 
The first University Assembly
will heat 11:15 Wednesday, Sep
tember 14th in Assembly Hall. Dr.
Jordan will be the principal speaker
and his address will he particularly
for the benefit of the Freshman
class, although it will interest the
entire student body.
â€¢James F. Lanagan,football coach,
will speak at this assembly, and
naturally his address will be along
athletic lines. Every football man
in college and every member of the
student body will be interested in
what Coach Lanagan will say about
the plans and outlook for the com
ing football season.
President Arthur M. Dibble of
the Associated Students will also
address the assembly. The plan
for the University assemblies this
year will differ somewhat from that
pursued last semester. Instead of
having several speakers from among
the faculty for each assembly, an
effort will be made to obtain out
side speakers of ability who have
some specialty on which they will
address the students. This change
is due to the fact that last year
members of the faculty were often
called upon to address when they
had no time for preparation and
merely spoke because it was their
turn. It is thought that by bring
ing outside men of ability the
assemblies will be of more general
interest on account of the variety of
subjects discussed.
An improvement will be made in
the music and singing by having
the glee club appear at all the
assemblies. This was a difficult
task last year, but during the com
ing semester strenuous efforts will
be made to have good singing at all
the assemblies. As usual, the yell
ing will be a leading feature of the
assemblies.
The fourth speaker for the com
ing assembly has not yet been
selected, but his name will be an
nounced within a day or two.
