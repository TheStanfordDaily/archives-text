Thekk is si certain amount of con
fidence that will aid any individual
or any group of individuals in
accomplishingany particular thing.
There is also such a thing hs over
confidence, which is a drawback to
any individual or group of indi
viduals. This is an excellent thing

The football sqund turns out to
morrow for the first time. The
candidates will start the season
under favorable conditions, but
with no reason to feel that they

start that Stanford, at best, has*
only an even break in the 1904
football game, they will have the
situation in mind as it really is.
Practice starts to-morrow, and the
bleachers should be crowded every
afternoon from now until Coach
Lanagan declares secret practice.
The squad has a hard tight. It

body to be with the team at everv
opportunity and give it the support
it needs to bring a victory on No
vember 12th.
