# REORGANIZATION OF BAND.
## University Band to Be Enlarged and New Music to Be Played This Year. 
### 
The first meeting of the Univer
sity Band this semester will take
place on Thursday night, when a
complete reorganization will lie
brought about. The meeting will
be held in the old band-room in
the Mechanical Engineering build
ing at 7:30. New applications for
membership will be received, and a
new leader and a manager will be
elected.
The outlook for a good band this
year is particularly bright. With
the exception of G. W. Bernhard,
'04, and B. 0. Bubb, '04, all the
men who were members of the
band last year are back to fill their
old positions. Besides these there
is some very promising material
among the new men; —and all who
can play any reed or brass instru
ment are expected to appear at the
first meeting.
It is intended to increase the
size of the band to twenty-eight
members, which is eight more than
the membership last year. This
number will probably be made up
of the following instruments: two
piccolos, six clarinets, six cornets,
four altos, four trombones, two
baritones, two basses, and two
drums.
The rehearsals will be held twice
each week, the time to be set at the
meeting Thursday night. A large
repertoire of new music lias been
secured, and practice upon it will
be begun as soon as possible.
The band will appear ottener
this fall than it has in the past. It
will be on the bleachers often, and
will play, at the practice games.
As soon as the band is well organ
ized it is probable that the prome
nade concerts which were success
fully inaugurated last semester
will be renewed.
On account of over-pressure of
college work, M. H. Thorpe, '05,
will not be a candidate for re-elec
tion as band leader, but he will re
tain a position in the band.
