# Dr. Starbuck's New Place.
## 
### 
Dr. Edwin IX Starbuck, for the
past seven years assistant professor
of Education in Stanford Univer
sity, has been appointed to the
same position at Earlham College
at Richmond, Ind., which is con
sidered the best known Quaker col
lege in the Middle West. Earlham
College makes a specialty of teach
ing, and it is for this reason that
the trustees desired to add so strong
a man as Dr. Starbuck to the edu
cational department of the institu
tion. Dr. Starbuck has been absent
from Stanford on leave during the
past year.
