# New Preparatory School.
## 
### 
Plans are being considered
for the establishment of a new
preparatory school at Evergreen
Park, the tract of land on the
county road between Mayfield
and Palo Alto. There are at
present two clubhouses upon
the land, and it is proposed to use
these as dormitories, to which addi
tions might be made as required.
A number of new buildings for
class-room and laboratory purposes
will be put up. The plan is to be
ready for opening about September,
1905. Negotiations with promi
nent educators throughout the state
have already been begun with a
view to securing a teaching force for
the proposed institution.
