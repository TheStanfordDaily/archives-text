# NEW FOOTBALL RULES.
## Three Important Changes in Regulations of Last Seasonâ€”Should Aid Stanford. 
### 
The football rules for 1904 have
just appeared in the new official
football guide, which is edited by
Walter Camp, and issued by the
American Sports Publishing Co.
The rules were revised by the
rules committee, which had among
its members Dashiell of Annapolis,
Stagg of Chicago, and WalterCamp
of Yale.
This year the quarter-back may
run with the ball in any part of
the field. Stanford made touch
downs with this play last year in
both Freshman and Varsity games.
California did not use it to nearly
the same extent, and as Berkeley
this year will have a new quarter,
while the Cardinal retains her
crack ends of last season, this
change should operate to Stanford's
advantage.
The next most important change
is that the backs can be re-enforced
with a man from the line in any
part of the field. Stanford should
have as many experienced linemen
as her opponent, so this will not
work against the Stanford team.
The limitation that when five men
are behind the line one must play
outside of tackle, will not mater
ially affect Lanagan's system, as
when plays using five men were
tried in the last twenty-five yards
last year, one man was always sta
tioned far over to buck the oppos
ing half.
A field-goal this year counts hut
four points, cne point less than last
year. As California has been more
successful in this line, since Stan
ford lost Traeger, it has no great
effect on the Cardinal. However,
both varsities start this year with
an even break, as neither possesses
a man experienced in kicking field
goals.
Penalties are classified and more
definitely fixed this year than ever
before. Distance penalties are
either for five or fifteen yards. The
loss of fifteen yards is imposed in
case of (1) the offensive side unlaw
fully using hands or arms or hold
ing ; or for (2) misuse of the
quarter-back run ; (3) interference
with a fair catch.
For all minor offenses the pun
ishment is fixed at the loss of five
yards.
Unnecessary roughness disqual
ifies the offender.
By refusing to play within two
minutes of referee's order, or delay
ing a losing game by repeated fouls,
a team forfeits its game.
As to officials, the linemen's
authority is lessened. 'The umpire's
signal is made different from the
referee's whistle.
A penalty imposed by the umpire
takes effect at the close of a play.
The side offended may choose
whether or not it will accept the
penalty.
