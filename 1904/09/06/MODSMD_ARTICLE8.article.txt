# ATTRACTIONS FOR THE YEAR.
## No Chamber Concerts, but Productions of a More General Nature. 
### 
The faculty committee on enter
tainments has decided not to
attempt to give the Chamber Con
certs this year. This decision was
reached after a thorough review of
the result attained last year, with
its questionable success due to the
lukewarm patronage accorded these
entertainments by the student body.
The great amount of work involved
and the relatively small support
which was received would not,
therefore, justify an attempt to re
peat them. The committee will
endeavor,on the other hand, to give
a series of high class entertain
ments of a more general nature,
productions which can be better ap
preciated by the students as a whole.
The first of these for which the
committee has arranged is to be a
production by the Ben Greet Com
pany, though just what the play is
to be has not yet been announced.
This will be early this semester,
probably sometime in October. If
this is successful there is a chance
of the same company returning a
little later to give a mammoth pro
duction of "Hamlet" in its en
tirety. "Hamlet" as generally
given on the stage is cut down to
about half its original size, so that
a great deal of it is lost to the
audience. To produce the whole
play requires about five hours. As
Mr. Greet will give it, it will be
divided into two parts, the first to
be given in the afternoon and the
second in the evening. All who
were fortunate enough to see the
Greet Company last year in their
rendition of "Everyman" and of
" Twelfth Night" will be glad to
know that they are coming again.
The Ben Greet Company is a band
of English actors who are touring
the country and giving to the inter
pretation of productions of Shak
spere their best talent for the sake
of the art itself, and not for com
mercial aggrandizement. They
play principally before universities,
literary clubs, and other cultured
communities capable of appreci
ating the art and depth of the
plays. But, as was said, whether
or not "Hamlet" is to be given
will depend largely upon the sup
port accorded the first play.
There is also a chance of an ap
pearance this semester by the
Royal Italian Band under its old
leader, Creatore. It was Creatore
who made the hand famous, and
brought it to a state of excellence
which made it noted throughout
both Europe and America. Under
subsequent management the band
deteriorated somewhat, and, though
still good, has not been up to its
old standard during the past sea
son or two. With the return of its
old great leader it will undoubted
ly resume its former prestige.
No further definite arrangements
have as yet been made by the
committee, but a number of artists
of national reputation will visit
the Coast this winter whom the
committee members hope to be able
to secure. They wish to provide
all the entertainment that the sup
port of the public will justify.
