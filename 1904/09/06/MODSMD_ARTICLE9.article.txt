# GEOLOGY WORK COMPLETED
## Stanford Men Finish Survey on Exploration of Santa Cruz Quadrangle. 
### 
Several years of the most exten
sive geological investigation ever
conducted on this Coast came to an
end about two weeks ago. The
work was carried on under the
supervision of Dr. J. C. Branner
and Prof. J. F. Nevvsom, of the
Stanford Geology department, with
the co-operation of the United
States Geological Survey.
During the investigation, which
was carried on mainly during the
summers, many students in the de
partments of Geology and Mining
took active part in the work.
lialph Arnold, Stanford "J9, who
had spent six or seven years explor
ing this region, was appointed by
the Government to take up the
work. He cooperated with Professor
Newsom, who was in charge of the
squad of student workmen in the
absence* of Dr. Branner, who has
been in Europe since January.
The territory explored, technically
termed the Santa Cruz quadrangle,
lies between Santa Cruz and Red
wood City, reaching westward to
Half-Moon Bay and Lower Crystal
Lake. The maps and text of the
survey when completed will take in
San Jose, Sunnyside, Palo Alto, the
southern foot of the bay, and the
coast as far north as Pillar Point,
thence down the coast to below
Santa Cruz. The region comprises
an area of 800 square miles. It in
cludes the Santa Cruz mountains,
the redwood belt, the Big Basin,
and the volcanic area around La
Honda.
The territory covered is very rich
in geological specimens, and con
tains almost every variety of rock
formation known to the geological
world. The oldest formations were
found to be the schists, limestones,
and granites around lien Lomond.
These are represented by the de
posits which form Black Mountain.
The most recent formations are the
rocks making the floor of the valley
on the east 6ide of the range, main
ly sandstones and shales.
On Mindego and Langley hills,
near La Honda, indications of
former volcanic activity are evi
dent. The lava sheet extends in a
star-shaped area from this region
as a center, and comprises about
one-twentieth of the whole quad
rangle. One isolated lava tongue
reaches down to the foothills back
of the University. Much of the
decomposed rock used in macad
amizing the roads about the Uni
versity came from it.
The redwoods seem to be best
developed along the steeper sides
of the mountains, and are
densest in the Big Basin, along
Butero Ridge, and northward to
Pescadero Creek. The growth is
also heavy around Castle Rock
Ridge and Ben Lomond, and north
as far as Puriseima Creek. Oil rock
was discovered in several places,
mostly between the coast and the
main ridge from Pescadero Creek
northward. Larpe deposits of as
phaltum were found on the slopes
of Ben Lomond, northwest of Santa
Cruz. The oil, a product from the
