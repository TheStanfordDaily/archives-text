OR LET US
Some one will "mind" it sooner or
later. Why not lis? t
MIND nature, she's just, she always
warns; if you lieeil not her cries for rest
and help you must take the consequences
that come from neglect.
Mind the warnings, the dull heavy
aches or the sharp, shooting pains.
"MIND" your eyes. Let us care for
them.
With us this means a thorough ex
amination, an accurate record of the
physical and optical conditions, the
right glasses, or none, and our future
care for both your eyes and your glasses.
That's easy for you, inexpensive and
safe.
