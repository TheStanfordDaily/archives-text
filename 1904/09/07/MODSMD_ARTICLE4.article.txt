# ENTHUSIASTIC RALLY OPENS SEASON.
## Speeches by Football Leaders Strike Key-note of the Situation.—Seventy-six Men Sign Training Rules. 
### 
The first gun of the football sea
son was fired last night, when sev
eral hundred men gathered in En
cina Hull to listen to addresses by
Coach Lanagan and others on the
prospects of the season and the
duties of football men and of those
who do not play. After the speech
making, all those present intending
to play signed up. Seventy-six
men handed in their names, thirty
three of whom are old men and
forty-three freshmen. This num
ber is about twenty-five less than
last year's total, but it will be in
creased within the next few days
by men who were not present at
the rally last night.
The rally was a ver}' enthusiastic
affair, but every speaker was given
the closest attention. The points
upon which most stress was laid
were the strict observance of train
ing rules and the danger of over
confidence. Coach Lanagan de
clared that Stanford has the hard
est kind of a struggle before it, and
if through various influences the
men grow over confident, the result
will surely be disaster to the Cardi
nal .
The first speaker was Prof. C. R.
Lewers of the Law department,
whose remarks were largely words
of advice for the man who does not
play. He said in part: "I particu
larly urge you all to do your level
best to help out Lanagan. Last
year your team pulled together and
the students pulled with the team.
The result you know. This year
Lanagan is capable of doing far
more. His experience bus taught
him things, and he desires to profit
by everything he sees. I feel more
confidence in Lanagan than in any
other coach we have ever had.
Last year I made an exception of
Walter Camp. This year I make
no exception whatever."
Professor Lewers then urged the
men of the college in general not
to while away the time of the
player in useless discussions, but
to help him utilize his time to the
best advantage, so that he may not
be .'oat to the football squad be
cause of deficient scholarship. He
urged all Freshmen to come out,
because large numbers are needed
from which to select the best men.
Trainer Moulton was given a
very varm reception. He said:
"I come with that same old song
about training rules. 1 want to
emphasize one thing—that as soon
as a man signs his name here to
night he goes into training, and he
must keep the rules faithfully. 1
know it means hardship, but the
game and the finish are well worth
it. There is entirely too much
confidence this year. 1 want to
say that the California men are
good hard citizens to go against,
and if you beat them you have to
do hard work.- To the new men I
want to say that I can tell if you
break training-rules even if I don't
see you do it. Your work will
show it on the field, and the first

; thing you know you will be taken
j off the field and you won't know
I why. Don't break training rules
i —cut out smoking, drinking, and
I society all you possibly can. You
j can't succeed any other way. At
California they have a new coach
j who is going to have a good, fast
; team. Training rules will be en
forced as never before. They will
only be beaten by hard football —
real, honest football."
Captain Clark's address was
short, but to the point. He said:
" I think there is entirely too much
confidence over the prospects for
the big game. We may be rather
hopeful, but I especially warn you
that there should not be too much
over-confidence. We will have to
put up the hardest fight of our
lives.
"Another thing I want to call to
your attention. I have seen it
stated that we have a veteran team.
As a matter of fact, we have no
team. There is no team. Seven of
the men who made up the team of
last year have come back, but these
will have to fight as hard as any
others for their positions. Every
one must keep training rules and
obey the coaches without a ques
tion. I wish that all would sup
port Lanagan and the others who
are managing the team."
Lanagan, who was wildly cheered
when he mounted the table to
speak, said: '• Three things should
be understood as being absolutely
essential to success. The first of
these is good spirit. This means
that when a fellow is told to do a
thing, he must do it right away,
and he must do it in the best of
spirit. In the second place, we
must have a crowd of men that will
fight. There are plenty to fight
fairly hard, but this year we will
have men who can do a little bet
ter than their best. This was well
illustrated during the last game.
In that game there was a man who
before had not kicked more than
forty yards. But when it was up to
him, he kicked sixty yards. 'That's
the kind of man we want. Finally,
the men must absolutely keep the
training rules. They must not
smoke or chew, and they must be
in bed by 11 o'clock. Anyone who
breaks these rules will be sent from
the field at once. Last year the
California team didn't train, and
that fact was our best card. If the
men had been properly trained and
handled, we would have been wiped
off the face of the field. This year
they have got a headier coach and
new ideas, and there is no question
that training rules will be strictly
enforced. Stanford must put to
gether a better team now than we
had last year, or we will be wiped
off as we should have been then.
To the old men we are grateful for
the support given last year. We
have still greater need of it this
year."

The first gun of the football sea
son was fired last night, when sev
eral hundred men gathered in En
cina Hull to listen to addresses by
Coach Lanagan and others on the
prospects of the season and the
duties of football men and of those
who do not play. After the speech
making, all those present intending
to play signed up. Seventy-six
men handed in their names, thirty
three of whom are old men and
forty-three freshmen. This num
ber is about twenty-five less than
last year's total, but it will be in
creased within the next few days
by men who were not present at
the rally last night.
The rally was a ver}' enthusiastic
affair, but every speaker was given
the closest attention. The points
upon which most stress was laid
were the strict observance of train
ing rules and the danger of over
confidence. Coach Lanagan de
clared that Stanford has the hard
est kind of a struggle before it, and
if through various influences the
men grow over confident, the result
will surely be disaster to the Cardi
nal .
The first speaker was Prof. C. R.
Lewers of the Law department,
whose remarks were largely words
of advice for the man who does not
play. He said in part: "I particu
larly urge you all to do your level
best to help out Lanagan. Last
year your team pulled together and
the students pulled with the team.
The result you know. This year
Lanagan is capable of doing far
more. His experience bus taught
him things, and he desires to profit
by everything he sees. I feel more
confidence in Lanagan than in any
other coach we have ever had.
Last year I made an exception of
Walter Camp. This year I make
no exception whatever."
Professor Lewers then urged the
men of the college in general not
to while away the time of the
player in useless discussions, but
to help him utilize his time to the
best advantage, so that he may not
be .'oat to the football squad be
cause of deficient scholarship. He
urged all Freshmen to come out,
because large numbers are needed
from which to select the best men.
Trainer Moulton was given a
very varm reception. He said:
"I come with that same old song
about training rules. 1 want to
emphasize one thing—that as soon
as a man signs his name here to
night he goes into training, and he
must keep the rules faithfully. 1
know it means hardship, but the
game and the finish are well worth
it. There is entirely too much
confidence this year. 1 want to
say that the California men are
good hard citizens to go against,
and if you beat them you have to
do hard work.- To the new men I
want to say that I can tell if you
break training-rules even if I don't
see you do it. Your work will
show it on the field, and the first

; thing you know you will be taken
j off the field and you won't know
I why. Don't break training rules
i —cut out smoking, drinking, and
I society all you possibly can. You
j can't succeed any other way. At
California they have a new coach
j who is going to have a good, fast
; team. Training rules will be en
forced as never before. They will
only be beaten by hard football —
real, honest football."
Captain Clark's address was
short, but to the point. He said:
" I think there is entirely too much
confidence over the prospects for
the big game. We may be rather
hopeful, but I especially warn you
that there should not be too much
over-confidence. We will have to
put up the hardest fight of our
lives.
"Another thing I want to call to
your attention. I have seen it
stated that we have a veteran team.
As a matter of fact, we have no
team. There is no team. Seven of
the men who made up the team of
last year have come back, but these
will have to fight as hard as any
others for their positions. Every
one must keep training rules and
obey the coaches without a ques
tion. I wish that all would sup
port Lanagan and the others who
are managing the team."
Lanagan, who was wildly cheered
when he mounted the table to
speak, said: '• Three things should
be understood as being absolutely
essential to success. The first of
these is good spirit. This means
that when a fellow is told to do a
thing, he must do it right away,
and he must do it in the best of
spirit. In the second place, we
must have a crowd of men that will
fight. There are plenty to fight
fairly hard, but this year we will
have men who can do a little bet
ter than their best. This was well
illustrated during the last game.
In that game there was a man who
before had not kicked more than
forty yards. But when it was up to
him, he kicked sixty yards. 'That's
the kind of man we want. Finally,
the men must absolutely keep the
training rules. They must not
smoke or chew, and they must be
in bed by 11 o'clock. Anyone who
breaks these rules will be sent from
the field at once. Last year the
California team didn't train, and
that fact was our best card. If the
men had been properly trained and
handled, we would have been wiped
off the face of the field. This year
they have got a headier coach and
new ideas, and there is no question
that training rules will be strictly
enforced. Stanford must put to
gether a better team now than we
had last year, or we will be wiped
off as we should have been then.

as a man signs his name here to
night he goes into training, and he
must keep the rules faithfully. 1
know it means hardship, but the
game and the finish are well worth
it. There is entirely too much
confidence this year. 1 want to
say that the California men are
good hard citizens to go against,
and if you beat them you have to
do hard work.- To the new men I
want to say that I can tell if you
break training-rules even if I don't
see you do it. Your work will
show it on the field, and the first

; thing you know you will be taken
j off the field and you won't know
I why. Don't break training rules
i —cut out smoking, drinking, and
I society all you possibly can. You
j can't succeed any other way. At
California they have a new coach
j who is going to have a good, fast
; team. Training rules will be en
forced as never before. They will
only be beaten by hard football —
real, honest football."
Captain Clark's address was
short, but to the point. He said:
" I think there is entirely too much
confidence over the prospects for
the big game. We may be rather
hopeful, but I especially warn you
that there should not be too much
over-confidence. We will have to
put up the hardest fight of our
lives.
"Another thing I want to call to
your attention. I have seen it
stated that we have a veteran team.
As a matter of fact, we have no
team. There is no team. Seven of
the men who made up the team of
last year have come back, but these
will have to fight as hard as any
others for their positions. Every
one must keep training rules and
obey the coaches without a ques
tion. I wish that all would sup
port Lanagan and the others who
are managing the team."
Lanagan, who was wildly cheered
when he mounted the table to
speak, said: '• Three things should
be understood as being absolutely
essential to success. The first of
these is good spirit. This means
that when a fellow is told to do a
thing, he must do it right away,
and he must do it in the best of
spirit. In the second place, we
must have a crowd of men that will
fight. There are plenty to fight
fairly hard, but this year we will
have men who can do a little bet
ter than their best. This was well
illustrated during the last game.
In that game there was a man who
before had not kicked more than
forty yards. But when it was up to
him, he kicked sixty yards. 'That's
the kind of man we want. Finally,
the men must absolutely keep the
training rules. They must not
smoke or chew, and they must be
in bed by 11 o'clock. Anyone who
breaks these rules will be sent from
the field at once. Last year the
California team didn't train, and
that fact was our best card. If the
men had been properly trained and
handled, we would have been wiped
off the face of the field. This year
they have got a headier coach and
new ideas, and there is no question
that training rules will be strictly
enforced. Stanford must put to
gether a better team now than we
had last year, or we will be wiped
off as we should have been then.
To the old men we are grateful for
the support given last year. We
have still greater need of it this
year."
