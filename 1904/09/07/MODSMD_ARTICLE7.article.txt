Last night's rally started the
football season by impressing every
one at the outset with a correct idea
of conditions as they really exist.
For the benefit of those who did not
attend it may be well to repeat in
this column one or two things that
developed in the rally speeches.
The most important matter to be
borne in mind by the large major
ity of the student body who do not
play football, is the fact that the
football man is entitled to some
time for rest and study. He is ex
pected to do the same amount of
university work as the man who
does not play. In addition to that
he has to putin two or more hours
of the hardest kind of work on the
gridiron every afternoon. He should
have his early afternoons and eve
nings for college work and for rest.
Every man and woman in the stu
dent body can help win the game
this year if he or she will follow
Professor Lewers' advice and leave
the football men alone,and not bur
den them with foolish questions
which keep their minds on the game
all the time.
Another important thing was
mentioned last night by the cap
tain of the team, and should be es
pecially noted by the football men.
The assurance that there is no
Varsity team at the present time
ought to be felt by every man on
the squad. That assurance means
that every person who signed the
rules last night has an opportunity
to show what he can do, and also
that he has a fair chance for any
position on the team provided he
plays as good ball as does the so
called "veteran."
