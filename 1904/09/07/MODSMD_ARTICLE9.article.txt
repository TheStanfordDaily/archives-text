# High-Salaried Graduate Here.
## 
### 
F. J. Dennis, who graduated
from Stanford in 18S2, has been
visiting the campus for the last few
days. Dennis it* probably the
highest-salaried graduate of Stan
ford, with a single possible excep
tion. He took liis degree as a Min
ing Engineer in 1892, after com
pleting one year of work at the
University, having taken his other
three years at Cornell. Since 1892
his success has been phenomenal,
and his rise rapid. He has worked
at different times in Africa, China,
Manchuria, and Western Australia.
In China he received the extraordi
nary sum of $5000 a month and
expenses, while engaged for some
months in carrying on difficult
operations for a large London min
ing corporation. The same con
cern later offered him a permanent
position at $25,000 a year, which
he accepted and has held for the
last three years. Dennis is now
residing temporarily in San Fran
cisco, but will soon begin some
mining explorations on his own ac
count.
