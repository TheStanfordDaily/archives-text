Will know or boou h»arn that it is Use
less to wink and blink, move your paper
off, or move it up, —you can't get clear,

that may work a permanent injury. Al
low us to look into the matter. It will
be a satisfaction for you to know if yogr
glasses are right, and a comfort to get
them right if t.hev are wrong.
We'll be honest with you—we can't
afford to be otherwise.
