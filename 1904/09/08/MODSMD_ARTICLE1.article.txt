# PHI BETA KAPPA ORGANIZED.
## Local Chapter Granted at Last Meeting of United Chapter. 
### 
At the triennial meeting of the
United Chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa, just closed, a local charter
was granted to Stanford University.
This will be welcome news to all
those who are vitally interested in
the welfare of Stanford. It comes
as the result of continued efforts on
the part of prominent members of
our faculty who are members of this
fraternity.
An application for a charter at
Stanford was made by these men
six years ago, but owing to a mis
understanding no action was taken
by the United Chapter at that time.
Two years afterward a second ap
plication was made,which came be
fore the meeting three years ago.
Action at that time was postponed
until the next meeting, which has
just taken place.
A meeting will be called shortly
to formulate plans for the future of
the local organization. A constitu
tion, which was prepared four years
ago, will he revised if necessary and
adopted. This constitution will
prescribe the conditions and meth
ods of election, and makes provi
sion for all other matters incident
to the life of the fraternity.
Phi Beta Kappa is purely an
honorary scholarship society, and
is practically non-secret. In the
majority of institutions only gradu
ate students are eligible to member
ship, but in some instances mem
bers of the junior class have been
admitted. This matter lies wholly
in the hands of the local chapters.
As a rule about ten members of the
senior class, either men or women
who have maintained a high grade
of scholarship, are each year chosen
to membership. In some institu
tions all members of the fraternity
vote in these elections, while in
others only faculty members vote.
Historically Phi Beta Kappa is
a fraternity recruiting its member
ship from among students of arts
and letters. On the other hand the
Sigma Xi fraternity, which has a
local chapter, seeks members from
among students of science. The
latter fraternity, however, as a local
chapter, has not as yet hegun the
custom of electing students to mem
bership. The aims of the two fra
ternities are almost identical, and
they usually exist side by side.
Phi Beta Kappa traces its organ
ization back to Revolutionary
times, when it was a mere local
organization at the College of Wil
liam and Mary. During this
period records were lost and tradi
tions blurred, yet the romantic in
terest was not lost but on the
contrary enhanced. During all
these years the ideals of the society
have been growing and its badge
has meant more to its members
each succeeding year. To-day there
are in existence about fifty chap
ters in men's and women's colleges
and coeducational institutions, and
at each place it stands for high
purpose, lofty ideals, and acts as a
bond between the greater Amer
ican universities. Among the
members of Phi Beta Kappa
in the faculty of Stanford Uni

versity are: O. L. Elliott, regis
trar; J. E. Matzke, professor of lio
manic Languages; V. L. Kellogg,
professor of Entomology; H. R.
Fairclough, professor of Latin; C.A.
Duniway, associate professor of
history; M. G. Dodge, associate li
brarian; W. A. Cooper, assistant
professor of German; S. S. Seward,
Jr., assistant professor of English;
It. M. Alden, assistant professor of
English; and H. L. Cannon, instruc
tor in History.
