# FIRST FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Nearly Eighty Men Began Light Work Yesterday.â€”Hauverman Arrives. 
### 
Nearly eighty men turned out
yesterday for the first football prac
tice of the season. Punting, the
handling of kicks, and running
down on punts hy the linemen,
were the main points of the game
engaged in.
The men assembled at the gym
nasium a little before five, and
then the squad proceeded to the
field, where the players were put
through different exercises to limber
their muscles. Then Coach Lana
gan explained to the men how to
handle punts, and the correct man
ner of starting after the ball had
been caught.
The candidates were divided up
into two squads irrespective of
Freshmen or old men, and these
squads were in turn divided into
those trying for the back-field posi
tions, and those trying for places
on the line. The backs were sta
tioned at one end of the field, and
practiced catching punts, while the
ends, tackles, and guards started
dowti the field, two at a time, after
the ball.
Yesterday Lanagan was in sole
charge of the field, but C. 1). Hau
verman, ex-'O4, who will be assist
ant coach, arrived this morning,
and will be out on the field this
afternoon. He will devote his en
tire time to the Freshman squad.
The hot weather makes practice
difficult, and it is doubtful whether
either the Varsity or Freshman
teams will line up before next Tues
day or Wednesday. Both teams
have games scheduled for a week
from Saturday, and it is certain
that no good team work can be ac
complished by that time.
