The establishment of a chapter
of the scholarship honorary society,
Phi Beta Kappa, will he generally
welcomed at Stanford. It will be
especially appreciated by those
faculty members who are Phi Beta
Kappa men, and who have been
trying for a number of years to
have a charter granted for a chap
ter at Stanford. Phi Beta Kappa
is almost universally regarded as a
most desirable organization. Stan
ford has long deserved a chapter of
the society, but even at this time
the advent of the organization is an
indication of the high standing in
which the University is regarded
by Eastern scholars.
That many brilliant Stanford
graduates of the past have not had
the privilege and honor of member
ship which will fall to the lot of
Stanford's best students of the
future, is to be regretted. The
honor is a great one, but it should
not be the incentive for good
scholarship. When it does become
the incentive it cannot possibly
mean as much as when it comes to
a student as an incident in his col
lege work.
