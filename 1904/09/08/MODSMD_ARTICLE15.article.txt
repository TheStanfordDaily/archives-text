Within the next week it is ex
pected that two of the famous
French mathematicians who are at
present on the Coast will make a
visit to Stanford. The two noted
men who will be here are Professors
Emile Picard and Ilenrie Poincare
of the mathematics department of
the University of Paris.
Both Picard and Poincare are
members of the French Academy,
and are recognized as heing among
the greatest mathematicians now
living. Poincare heads the depart
ment of applied mathematics at
Paris, and has published works
which have made him a recognized
authority on hydrodynamics. He
is also famous as an astronomer
and as a mathematical physicist.
Picard holds the position of pro
fessor of higher algebra at Paris,
having succeeded the famous Her
mite in that position. Besides his
regular work in the university be
has published a great deal of work
in scientific magazines, advancing
beyond the limits which had been
reached before in algebra, and calj
cuius. Both he and Professor
Poincare are making a pleasure
trip to the Pacific Coast, prior to

their attending the great interna
tional congress of arts and sciences
at St. Louis, on September 15th, at
which both are to make addresses.
In visiting the University of
California last week ihe two pro
fessors expressed surprise at the
amount of work done by the staffs
of the departments. At Paris they
are Accustomed to deliver but two
lectures a week.
