# MR. SAMPSON TALKS.
## Interesting Lecture, With Stereopticon Views, Regarding Forest and Game Preserves. 
### 
Alden Sampson, United States
game preserve expert, and former
ly secretary of the Boone and
Crockett Club, lectured in the
chapel last night on the forest re
serves of California and of Wash
ington. He illustrated his talk
with fine stereopticon views of for
est scenes and animals. The
boone and Crockett Club, in which
Mr. Sampson has heen a prominent
worker, was organized by Theodore
Roosevelt, before he became known
in public affairs, as an assaciation
of hunters to preserve, by legisla
tive and other means, certain
classes of game from extermination.
It served as a forerunner of a num
ber of similar organizations, so
that the movement has become
general, the natural evolution from
hunting to the preservation of
game. The game soon learn where
to find the protected preserves, and
they have developed an instinct for
neeking them now when pursued.
It was partly for this reason that
the forest reserves were started, the
other causes being to save the
mountain springs and streams and
to prevent the w niton destruction
of timber.
By means of a map Mr. Samp
son showed the distribution of the
various forest reserves in the
Rocky Mountain and Pacific states.
In all, the area covered approxi
mates 63,000,000 acres, or about
98,000 square miles. This is equal
to the areas of New York and
Pennsylvania combined. The first
reserves were made by President
Harrison and they have been added
to by each of the succeeding Presi
dents.
Mr. Sampson has just returned
from an examination of the Sierra,
San Bernardino, and San Diego re
serves in California and the Olym
pic reserve in Washington. He
had many very interesting views
showing the prevailing vegetation,
shrubbery, natural scenery, and
animals in the regions visited by
him. Throughout the trip were
constant signs of wanton destruc
tion and carelessness on the part
of hunters and rangers. This will
be closely watched hereafter by the
government; and much good has
already resulted from its super
vision by means of these reserves.
Mr. Sampson gave full accounts
of the habits, conditions and states
of preservation of the various
species of game in these preserves,
discussing them from a thorough
sportsman's point of view. He
gave startling statistics showing
the killing and indiscriminate
slaughter of game by reckless hun
ters who had no object but to kill,
leaving countless specimens to die
of wounds simply because they had
no use for them. Formerly there
was a high regard for the preserva
tion of game due to religious pre
cepts. Now the motive, in the new
movement, is due to scientific
reasons. True hunters are begin
ning to realize that in order to pre
vent complete extermination of all
kinds of game, as has been the case
with some kinds, there must be
moderation used in their destruc
tion. This has given rise to the
game laws now generally prevalent
in the several states.
Mr. Sampson was given the
closest attention by those present.
His stereopticon views were attrac

tive from an artistic point of View
as well as from that of information
and of science. Those who heard
him will be in hearty sympathy
with the movement to preserve the
native grandeur of the forests as
well as the game inhabiting them.
