# FORM RELIEF PARTY.
## Professor W.R. Dudley Leaves for Big Basin District with Twelve Students. 
### 
Over in Big Basin,where some of
California's forest giants are fast
burning, a number of people are
penned in by the great tires which
have been raging for the past few
days. Prof. \V. R. Dudley, head of
the department of Systematic Bot
any, who is also secretary of the Big
Basin Korest Preserve Commission,
to-day arranged for aid to be cent.
He gathered together a band of
eleven prominent students, and left
in charge of the expedition at four
o'clock this afternoon. The party
purpose to carry food to those who
are penned in by the fire, and to be
of assistance in bringing the spread
ing flame into check.
Several lumber mills, a number
of residences, and much other prop
erty have already been destroyed.
The entire country from the head
of Pescadero Creek to Bloom's mill
has been burned over. Two fire
fighters were burned to death yes
terday, and others are in great
peril. The front of the fire through
which the Stanford party must
enter is ten miles long, and is
practically one unbroken line of
flame. The expedition hoped to be
able to make an entrance through
the wall of flames by way of creek
beds. Unless such an entrance can
be made there will be little hope
for those imprisoned by the fire, for
an entrance from the south side of
the Big Basin is absolutely impos
sible. That is one of the main
reasons for the organization of a
party from this side of the moun
tains.
The men left in a four-horse bus
for Iverson's ranch near Pescadero.
Early to morrow morning they will
leave the ranch and make a des
perate attempt to get through the
circle of fire and rescue the im
prisoned inhabitants of the burn
ing region.
The men who went on the trip
are: E.G. Dudley,'os, H. M.Lewis,
'04, H. B. Jordan, '05, H. S. Gay,
