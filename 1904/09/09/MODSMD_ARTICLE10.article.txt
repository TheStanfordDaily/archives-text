Prof. W. R. Dudley and the
party of students who left the Uni
versity this afternoon to assist in
the work of saving the Big Basin
forest preserve from devastating
tires, are deserving of much praise
for their undertaking. The mission
on which they have gone is one
that requires public spirit and
courage. If the expedition is suc
cessful in doing even a small part
toward relieving the distress of the
fire fighters or bringing the flames
into control, it will have done the
government a most valuable service.
