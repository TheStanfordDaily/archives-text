# "Sequoia" Will be Out Monday.
## 
### 
The Sequoia will make its first
appearance as a monthly college
magazine next Monday. Jt is the
intention of the management to
bring the magazine out on the 10th,
or the first college day after the
10th, of each month.
The new Sequoia will be about
three times as large as the bi
monthly of former years, contain
ing approximately sixty reading
pages. This is considerably larger
than the average college literary
publication, but the exceptional
amount of creative work which
Stanford has always produced
seems to justify the experiment.
In paper, binding and general
make-up the Sequoia is now fully
the equal of any college magazine
in the West.
The table of contents for the Sep
tember issue is, in part, as follows:
Stanford Sunrise Song
