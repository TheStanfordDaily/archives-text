# ALL-PACIFIC FOOTBALL.
## Archie Rice, '95, Discusses Western Games and Players in Official Guide. 
### 
In this year's edition of the Offi
cial Football Guide, Walter Camp
and Caspar Whitney give their se
lections for an All-American eleven,
with their reasons for their choices.
Besides the ruleß, much space is
given to thesumniariesof last year's
football teams in the various sec
tions of the country.
This year's issue of the guide is
noteworthy on account of the addi
tional interest given to Western
teams. In ranking the Eastern
team Princeton is placed first and
Yale next, then Dartmouth and
Harvard in the order named. The
W'estern teams are placed in the
following order: Michigan, Minne
sota, Chicago, and Wisconsin.
A. B. Rice, '95, has an article in
the guide on "Pacific Coast Foot
ball." He summarizes Pacific foot
ball history, and shows the influ
ence of the Yale system on Stan
ford playing and the Princeton
style on California's football.
Among other things he says:
"Stanford draws nearly forty per
cent of her players from distant
states, particularly from Colorado
and Washington. During the past
decade the Coast has developed
perhaps a half dozen players who
could have starred on any eleven
in America, but in general the
Coast teams at their best have put
too great a premium on rigid de
fense and neglected swift scoring
methods that load and fire plays
with confusing rapidity.
"The last season has been the
best, most sportsmanlike, and
gamiest in the history of the
Coast. More teams have met, and
widely separated sections have for
the first time tried each other's
strength.
"Stanford, like Princeton, Michi
gan and Minnesota, was one of the
four big teams of the country to go
through last season without a
single defeat."
Rice concludes by picking an
All-Pacific eleven on which Stan
ford is represented by Clark,
Sprott, Dole and Weller.
A notable gift has been made to
the University by Dr. James Barr
Ames, dean of the Harvard Law
School. At the annual meeting of
the Stanford Law Association,
which took place May 13th, Dr.
Ames delivered a most excellent
lecture on " Honest Competition
Under the Law." He made a trip
from Harvard to the Coast for the
sole purpose of delivering this lect
ure. • At the time it was expected
that he would be paid for his time
and expense, but since then Dr.
Ames has refused to accept any re
compense, and wishes that his trip
be considered as a gift to the Law
department of the University.
