# Y.M.C.A. RALLY.
## First Meeting of the Year Held in the Chapel.—Dr. Alden Speaks. 
### 
The first Y. M. C. A. rally of the
year was held in the chapel last
night. The main object of the
meeting was to enlist in the Associ
ation and its interests the new men
who are entering college for the
first time. The spirit displayed
throughout the meeting would in
dicate that the Association is to
have a prosperous and profitable
term. A number of new
names were added to the rolls
of membership. The general pol
icy of the organization is to be the
same as that carried out last year,
namely, the confining of its line of
work to its own sphere of action,
the furnishing of employment for
needy students, the providing of
bible classes and other forms of de
votional service for those who wish
to participate in them, and the
serving as the religious unit for the
men of the University.
The principal speaker of the eve
ning was Assistant Professor K. M.
Alden of the English department.
He took for his theme the necessity
of making definite decisions, upon
entering college, regarding one's
course of action for the four years
of his University life. Here, in a
certain atmosphere of solemnity
(because upon the course while
here depends our whole future)
there are boundless opportunities
fur decision. Especially at the be
ginning of college there is a "sift
ing out of the hearts of men," be
cause within a few months they
will have decided their careers in
the various lines of athletics, so
ciety, scholarship, etc.; and they
shall be fixed in those courses for
the rest of their college life. 'The
order of things makes it so, for here,
in a great university, where compe
tition is so great, the strict rule
which applies is the survival of the
fittest, and one must concentrate
and apply himself along certain
lines if he is to succeed in any of
them. According to the psycholo
gist James, there are two kinds of
option or choice: they may be ab
solute or open. In the first class
one may choose or not as he pleases,
and his being will not be material
ly affected thereby, whichever he
decides, —as, the dining with a
friend, the taking of a stroll, etc.
But the other class is much more
serious, as a decision must be made
one way or the other and one's
whole career rests upon that de
cision. This is exemplified in the
choice of one's course of study, of
his line of action, of his associations
in a new community and a new
sphere of life. In this case if one
does not decide it means that he
decides not to, — for that is the ulti
mate result; the so-called "drifting
decisions" will always result nega
tively. The obligation is upon us
all; we must set our lives on de
cisions that have to be made.
Among this class of decisions
Dr. Alden named those which
should be for faithful work in the
class-room, for friendship, fellow
ship, a social atmosphere, and for
one's moral and religious policy.
As for faithfulness in university

work, other circumstances help to
decide that, so that if one is to re
main in college at all he must be at
least fairly diligent along that line.
But as to the other sides the option
is left entirely with the student.
For this reason Dr. Alden urged
every man present to participate in
some outside student activities, for,
besides helping the good name of
the institution, there is more of life
of all kinds to be had by comming
ling with the other students in this
fashion than could ever be gained
in the class-room.
As for one's moral attitude, Dr.
Alden pointed out the fatal mistake
that many make in deciding, either
affirmatively or negatively, to drop
their religious associations and
habits for the four years of college,
expecting to resume them when
they return to the old associations.
In ten cases to one the intended re
sumption never takes place, and
the new habits and lines of action
remain with one. He closed with
an admonition to make definite de
cisions at the outset to keep one's
idea in God, and to keep one's fra
ternal and fellowship ideas.

mate result; the so-called "drifting
decisions" will always result nega
tively. The obligation is upon us
all; we must set our lives on de
cisions that have to be made.
Among this class of decisions
Dr. Alden named those which
should be for faithful work in the
class-room, for friendship, fellow
ship, a social atmosphere, and for
one's moral and religious policy.
As for faithfulness in university

work, other circumstances help to
decide that, so that if one is to re
main in college at all he must be at
least fairly diligent along that line.
But as to the other sides the option
is left entirely with the student.
For this reason Dr. Alden urged
every man present to participate in
some outside student activities, for,
besides helping the good name of
the institution, there is more of life
of all kinds to be had by comming
ling with the other students in this
fashion than could ever be gained
in the class-room.
As for one's moral attitude, Dr.
Alden pointed out the fatal mistake
that many make in deciding, either
affirmatively or negatively, to drop
their religious associations and
habits for the four years of college,
expecting to resume them when
they return to the old associations.
In ten cases to one the intended re
sumption never takes place, and
the new habits and lines of action
remain with one. He closed with
an admonition to make definite de
cisions at the outset to keep one's
idea in God, and to keep one's fra
ternal and fellowship ideas.
