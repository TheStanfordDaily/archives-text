# LIGHT FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Work of Squad Held Back Yesterday by Extreme Heat. 
### 
'f'he football men yesterday after
noon practiced running with the
ball for the first time. Candidates
for center and quarter were tried at
their positions and the rest of the
backs given the ball for a buck to
the right of center. This was the
only play practiced during the
afternoon.
The men as usual were put
through a set of exercises as soon
as they reached the field, and then
the squad was divided into
two divisions. Lanagan had charge
of one and Hauverman directed
the other. Captain Clark watched
the work of the new men on the
field. The players were again
coached in catching punts and
running down the field on kicks.
Owing to extremely hot weather
the work was very light.
The men were later tried at run
ning with the ball. The centers
and quarter-backs were all put at
passing the ball, while the other
players were practiced at bucking.
No interference or tackling was at
tempted. Several men are punting
very well for so early in the season,
and some of the Freshmen have
shown great possibilities in this
branch of the game.
The eight former Varsity players
now at work practicing will prob
ably be joined shortly by Harvey
Shields, right tackle on last year's
team, who arrived on the campus
yesterday, in splendid condition.
