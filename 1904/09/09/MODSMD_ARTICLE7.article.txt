# NEW EVENT FOR TRACK.
## Returned Track Men Strongly Favor Discus Throw as Intercollegiate Event. 
### 
The track men who made the
Eastern trip returned home strongly
impressed with the advisability of
introducing the discus throw as a
I'acific Coast athletic event. It now
takes a prominent place in all the
Eastern track meets,and of all field
event this one appeals most to the
spectator.
The discus itself weighs 4£
pounds. It is about 9 inches in
diameter, and 84 inches thick. The
discus thrower takes much the same
position at the start as the hammer
thrower. He turns three times and
throws the weight so that it sails
through the air. The event was
won at the Conference meet in Chi
cago at 128 feet. This mark is very
near the record. The event should
be popular, as weight does not give
so much advantage as it does in
the hammer-throw and shot-put.
At St. Louis the discus-throw was
won by Rodman of Illinois, who is
a comparatively small man.
Definite action will probably be
taken by the Athletic Committee at
its next meeting, and if the meas
ure passes proposals will be made
to California for the introduction of
the discus-throw into the Stanford-
California field meet.
Hyde, '04, threw the discus 114
feet with very little practice. Al
though Hyde, '04, is no longer
eligible, there are now in college
men who with practice should make
good throwers, such as Crawford,
'05, C. E. Hyde, '05, Weller, '07,
and Horton, '08. Chalmers, '07,
has had Bome experience in the
event.
The discus-throw is of classic ori
gin, being one of the contests of
the ancient Olmpian games. It
was held in high esteem by the
ancients, figuring frequently in art
and literature. The statue of l)io
scobulos (discus-thrower) is held
even now to be in art the repre
sentation of the ideal physical man.
