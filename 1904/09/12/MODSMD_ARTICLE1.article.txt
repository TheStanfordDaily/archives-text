# FIRE-FIGHTERS RETURN.
## Prof. W.R. Dudley Gives Detailed Account of Damage Done. 
### 
The party of Stanford students,
headed by Prof. \V. R. Dudley, left
the northern end of the California
Redwood Park in the Big Basin at
four o'clock Sunday afternoon,
when the great fire which has been
raging within the park boundaries
since Thursday morning had been
practically brought under control,
by means of a " back-fire" line five
miles long on the eastern side of the
«ast fork of Waddell creek and its
branches. Fortunately the central
portion of the park about the Gov
ernor's Camp, where the largest and
most valued redwoods stand, the
woods south of the new road, all of
the beautiful woods between the
eaßt and west forks of (he Waddell
creek, and the west fork valley
itself, are entirely untouched by the
fire. As a matter of fact, the best
and the largest portion of the forest,
for the preservation of which the
park was purchased, remains un
injured, in spite of the largely
exaggerated reports to the contrary.
The greater portion of the forested
park lands in the valley of the east
fork, where the fire forced itself,
have only suffered through the
burning of the huckleberry, myrtle
and smaller oaks, and the occa
sional complete burning of a Doug
las spruce or a redwood, the trunk
of which was wholly consumed.
The rest of the park lands to the
eastward are severely burned over,
and along Sempervirens Creek and
the Union-Mill Creek the only
green oasis remaining is the well
known Sempervirens or Slippery
Rock Camp, inside of whose un
touched circle of great redwoods
the azelias, wax-myrtles and tan
oaks are as green as ever. The
timbers prepared for the warden's
new lodge at the entrance of the
park were on a space thoroughly
cleared of brush and grass, and
were uninjured. The potrero near
the entrance to the forest, and the
thick redwoods along Redwood
Hollow, which extended from the
west down toward the Sempervirens
Creek just below Slippery Rock,
are melancholy sights and will re
main so for some years.
The redwood, however, is not
killed by fires which may scorch
the foliage, even to the top of the
tree. New limbs and foliage will
grow in time, and therefore most of
the trees in a severely burned forest
will sometime assume much of their
former beauty.
There are some compensating ad
vantages in a fire of this kind in
the redwood forest. The down tim
ber and tops from cut tan-oaks,
which were abundant along Union-
Mill Creek and the east part of the
park, are cleared away, and the
Commissioners will begin in this
region with a cleared field to make
preparations for the future growth
along better park lines. The north
ern projection of the park, which
consists largely of chaparral and
cut-over lands, is almost com
pletely cleared of vegetation in
places. Eastward from the park,
where the fire passed on Thursday
during the high north wind,

the woods are burned far worse
[than in any portion of the state
lands.
From this region and the Boul
der Creek road, Professor Dudley's
party was the first to pass to the
Sempervirens Camp and the Gov
ernor's Camp on Saturday. At that
time the fire was largely under
control, but on Thursday and Fri
day the region had been a veritable
furnace. The fire was so fierce for
a time, through the north wind
and great solar heat, that it cre
ated fierce whirlwinds ahead of the
flames which sucked in and some
times twisted off the tops of green
trees. It is said that the flames
leaped from one hundred yards to
half a mile and lighted fires in ad
vance.
This fire originated nearly at the
same time with approximately
twenty others in Santa Cruz
county. It came from the head of
Pescadero Creek on Tuesday after
noon, and by Friday there was a
nearly unbroken line reaching as
far as Ben Lomond Ridge, and ap
proaching the town of Boulder
Creek. All communication with
the park and all means of help was
cut off. This news was received at
Stanford and led at once to the
organization of Professor Dudley's
relief party, which entered by way
of Pescadero Creek in order to
carry the necessary supplies and
help.
By Saturday the warden had
succeeded in getting a good party
of fire-fighters into the park from
Boulder Creek, but the danger to
the Pescadero and Butano forests
from the big fire which was com
ing northward rapidly in the up
per part of the park was evident,
and it was only by vigorous work
on Saturday afternoon and night
that its advance was checked.
The region above Iverson's, the
Butano and Gazos Creek forests, the
beautiful ridges between these and
the Hollow Tree Camp, the region
of Berry Creek in the Big Basin,
and the Whitehouse Creek have
been reached by no fire whatever,
although the newspapers have re
ported the contrary. There is still
a severe fire about Carmichael's
Mill on Upper Pescadero Creek,
but probably this can be con
trolled.
In speaking of the work done by
the Stanford party, Professor Dud
ley desired to express his thanks to
the twelve students who composed
it, and his appreciation of the val
uable service which they did. Pro
fessor Dudley states that it was
solely through the efforts of the
party that the fire was prevented
from crossing the Pescadero Ridge
on Saturday, in which case the
famous Pescadero woods would have
been destroyed.
