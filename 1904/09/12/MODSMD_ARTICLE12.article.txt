In answer to the invitation ex
tended to members of the student
body, and especially to members of
the Freshman class, to enter into
the competition for positions
on the staff of the Daily Palo
Alto, there has not been a very
great number of candidates. The
Freshman class apparently has a
wealth of material for every line of
student activities; and 110 doubt a
number of first-year students,
through either carelessness or
reticence, have failed to begin work
along this line, and are there
by missing a most valuable oppor
tunity to become engaged in an
activity that offers splendid open
ings for advancement and training
in newspaper work. It is not yet
too late to enter the first period of
ompetition, and any student who
have been hesitating over the matter
are urgently requested to report at
once to the editor of this paper.
