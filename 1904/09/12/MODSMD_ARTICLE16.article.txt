# MEMORIAL CHURCH SERVICE.
## Dr. Gardner Speaks on Subject of Conscience and a Moral Consciousness. 
### 
Chaplain Gardner preached at
the morning service in Memorial
Church Sunday. He took for his
text Acts 24:20, "And herein do I
exercise myself to have always a
conscience void of offense toward
God and toward man." The con
text of the sermon follows: The
principal function of Christianity
is to develop the moral and spirit
ual side of youth, to teach them to
heed the call of an awakened con
science and to gain control of a
resolute will. What our country
needs to-day is the education for
complete man. Great attention is
paid to the physical and intellec
tual development, and no less re
gard should he directed toward the
spiritual and moral growth as well.
For complete development we dare
not break the trinity,—physical,
mental, and moral.
Education has to do with two
distinct functions, namely, the de
velopment of faculties and the
imparting of information. Such a
preponderance of attention is given
over to these issues that the relig
ious side has heen neglected and we
are in the midst of a serious depres
sion morally and spiritually. The
remedy lies in old fashioned prin
ciples and old fashioned virtues.
There are a number of causes for
the weakening of our moral status,
chief of which are the dominant
materialism, the secular public
school, and the modem ethics with
out religion. Youth is so torn and
tossed upon its own sea of emotions
that guidance is necessary. For
this reason religious teachings and
principles should be restored to the
public schools, where the character
of the growing child is being
moulded. For human happiness
and human misery are largely con
ditioned by the make-up of the
individual, and upon the care or
neglect bestowed upon them as chil
dren will depend their future status.
As with conscience which judges
one's self, so with moral conscious
ness which judges the characters of
others. One cannot get rid of a
conscience or of a moral conscious
ness. The function of the con
science as the soul's judge is to de
cide every question of right and
wrong. The power of conscience
may be insignificant, but its right
is indisputable; ami if it had
might as well as right it would gov
ern the world. Religion brings
conscience into power. Moral law
is the eternal law of God. Obedi
ence to His law is the highest duty
of man. In moral judgment one
need fear no foe, as we are respon
sible in our conscience to God alone
and not to any mortal being.
Therefore we should have the cour
age to stand up for our convictions,
and should dare to have a purpose
and dare to make it known. We
should heed the commendation and
condemnation of conscience. We
should listen to the voice of con
science because it is the voice of
God, because it will make of us
moral men and moral women, to
whom the Republic looks to lead.
