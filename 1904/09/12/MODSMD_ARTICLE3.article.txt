tering from Baltimore, Maryland.
She made German her major sub
ject but at the end of the year ill
health forced her to take out a leave
of absence. During the last sum
mer Miss Stephens has been acting
as private secretary to Mrs. Stan
ford. She entered the Univer
sity again this fall, pursuing her

The Leland Stanford Jr. Memo
rial Scholarship originated in a pe
culiar way. After the death of Le
land Stanford Jr., Senator Stanford
in looking over his son's effects
came across the boy's private bank
book. This showed that Leland
had saved a considerable sum un
known to his parents. With Ithe
interest on this money it was de
cided to start a memorial scholar
ship.
