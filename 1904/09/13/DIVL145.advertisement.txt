"JUST AS GOOD"
"Just as good" is what you hear in
buying almost any kind of goods. "Just
as good" means taking chances. Taking
chances in business matters is bad
policy. Taking chances with your eyes
is downright carelessness. Your eyes
are entitled to the very best of care.
They should be properly cared for as
soon as they show any need of care, and
they will show their need of care sooner
or later. Right then is the time for you
to come to us. We can tell you just
what your eyes need, and if it's glasses
we can supply them at right prices.
