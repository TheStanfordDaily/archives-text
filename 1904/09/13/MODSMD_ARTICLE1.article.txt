# FIRST ASSEMBLY TO-MORROW.
## Dr. Jordan and A.M Dibble Will Address the Student Body To-morrow Morning. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 11:15 the
first University Assembly of the
year will be held in Assembly Hall.
Dr. Jordan will be the principal
speaker, and his address will be on
some general topic, probably of
particular interest to Freshmen.
Arthur M. Dibble', '05, president
of the student body, will also speak
at the Assembly. His topic has not
yet been announced, but he will
probably speak about the plans for
future assemblies this year and
also impress upon the student
body the importance of attending
these monthly meetings.
The Glee Club will be present to
take part in the singing, but it will
give no special selections, as it is
not yet thoroughly organized.
