Every student in the University
should he present at the Assembly
to-morrow .morning. The ad
dresses will deal with those things
about Stanford which every Fresh
man ought to know, and which
every old student can well afford
to hear repeated. The Assembly
is an institution founded solely for
the good that it will do the mem
bers of the student body. It brings
together the entire student body in
order that the individuals may be
come better known to one another,
and that they may feel more keenly
that they are all members of one
organization for which they have a
common interest. The succes√ü of
the Assembly depends very largely
on attendance, and in order that
one of the best features of Stanford
life may be continued it is essential
that every student attend regularly.
