At every football practise since
the season opened there have been a
number of men leave the bleachers
and flock around the coaches and
players on the field. In the first
place, no man who is not directly
connected with the practise has a
right to be even on the side lines of
the gridiron; and in the second
place no man who wants to help
out the coaches and squad would
get in the way, even if he had the
privilege to do so. There is much
that goes on between coaches and
players that is meant for them
alone, and when others force them
selves into what, in a certain de
gree, is private conversation they
not only transgress beyond their
rights, but beyond what we may
call ordinary courtesy. The older
men in college should know better
than to go on the field at all, and
it would seem that it is their duty
to see that Freshmen are told to
keep their place. It is well to re
member that the coaches have a
thousand and one things to take
up their attention, and that they
hnve no time to devote to keeping
off the field people who have no
business there.
