# FOOTBALL MEN IMPROVE.
## Noticeable Advance Made by the Squad.â€”Scrimmage Work Soon to Commence. 
### 
It will be a week to-morrow since
the first football practice, and al
ready marked improvement is
noticeable in the squad. The men
handle and run in punts much
better and faster than they did at
the beginning of the season. The
players have now almost passed
through the preliminary stage of
merely kicking the ball and run
ning down the field, and the scrim
mage work will soon commence.
Both the Freshman and Varsity
squads have been given their sig
nals, and the men are being in
structed in the main points of the
positions they are trying for. The
players have been taught many of
the principles of the game, and
Lanagan has taken the line men
in hand and has laid special stress
on their positions on the offense
and defense.
Van Sickle, '05, guard on last
year's second team, and Stott, '07,
substituta Varsity quarter, were
out on the field yesterda}' for the
first time. The appearance of
Stott relieves Lanagan of the task
of developing a new quarter-back as
a substitute to Bansbach. The
Varsity squad has also been
strengthened by men who have
played the game at other colleges.
These men will not be eligible for
the intercollegiate contests, but
they will prove valuable to the
Varsity in strengthening the
second team.
The game with the Palo Alto
high school eleven scheduled for to
morrow afternoon has been post
poned until Thursday.
