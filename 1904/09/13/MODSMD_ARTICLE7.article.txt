# TENNIS PROSPECTS.
## Completion of New Courts Will Increase Cardinal's Chances This Year. 
### 
Although only one member of
last year's intercollegiate tennis
team has returned to college, the
prospects of a victory over Califor
nia next spring are bright. The
ground for hope is the completion
of the new oil courts in front of
Encina Hall. Hitherto the Car
dinal has been badly handicapped
by a lack of adequate facilities for
practice, but this difficulty is now
obviated by two newly finished oil
courts, in addition to the splendid
asphalt court recently completed.
It is possible that an additional
coat of oil will be applied to the
two new courts before the rainy
season, but in the meantime net
posts will be putin place and the
court properly lined.
Grading on the two oil courts for
the women students has been com
menced, and it is expected the work
will lie completed in two weeks.
Ground for the new courts is being
leveled between the old asphalt
courts and the quadrangle. These
courts for the women are badly
needed, as the cracks and hollows
in the old courts have become so
pronounced that it is almost im
possible to play tennis on them.
C. H. Baker, '04, who represented
Stanford in four intercollegiate
tournaments, iB the most valuable
man lost by the Cardinal this year.
G. A. Hodge, '0(5, who, with Baker
as partner, met the California team
in doubles last spring, has returned
to college and will be the mainstay
of this year's team. Hodge is a
cool,.heady player, and as he is in
better health than last year his
playing will improve. Other mem

hers of the tennis squad still in col
lege are Hooper, '05, Mori, '04,
Cassell, '07. Among the Freshmen,
Gay and Sterling, of Redlands, and
Newlands, of Palo Alto, have good
records.
The tennis club which had con
trol of tennis matters last y£ar will
be reorganized in order to continue
its projects for the advancement
and encouragement of the sport.
Any student who signifies his in
tention to try for the Varsity tennis
team will be welcomed as a mem
ber of the organization. The Ex
ecutive Committee of the student
body entrusted the building and
management of the new courts to
the tennis club, and it is expected
that this policy will be continued.
Plans for interclass tournaments
were broached last spring, but too
late to be put into operation at that
time. This project has been re
vived, and the first interclass tour
naments will probably take place
this fall.
