# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL.
## Team to Play Five Games Before the Intercollegiate Match. 
### 
Treasurer Barrett has practically
completed the Freshman football
schedule for the season. Five
games will be played before the in
tercollegiate match with Califor
nia, and in four of the preliminary
contests the Freshmen will meet
the fastest preparatory school teams
in California. Palo Alto and Oak
land high schools have heavy fast
teams, while the teams from (Santa
Clara and Belmont always make
it interesting for the Freshmen.
The fifth and last game before the
intercollegiate contest will proba
bly be played against a team from
Hoitt's school.
Since the football rally last
week, when thirty-five Freshmen
signed up, more new men turned
out every practice, until now
the number has reached exactly
fifty. This is the largest Freshman
squad that ever appeared on the
gridiron.
With the old men, it is expected
that the total number of football
men out will reach something over
a hundred. Manager Barrett is
making this number the basis for
bis calculations in ordering the
necessary suits and other football
paraphernalia.
