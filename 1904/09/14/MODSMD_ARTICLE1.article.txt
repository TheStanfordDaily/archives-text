## Freshmen Will Play Team from Palo Alto High School Tomorrow. 
### 
The first football game of the
season will be played on thecatnpus
to-morrow,when the Freshmen meet
the eleven from the Palo Alto high
school. This team was one of the
strongest of the schools that met
the Freshmen last year, and it de
feated the '07 eleven by the scores
of 11-5 and 6-5. Three of Palo
Alto's best players of last year are
now in college and will play with
the Freshmen to-morrow. These
men are Tomasini at guard, Van
dervoort at half, and Kearne at
quarter.
So far this season the Freshmen
have not lined up for a single
scrimmage, and it is not expected
that they will make a very good
showing to-morrow. Last night
four squads of first-year men were
put through their signals under the
eye of Assistant Coaches Hauver
man and Williams.
The line-up of the Freshman team
will not be announced until a few
minutes before the game, but the
coaches will give every man on the
squad a chance before the contest is
over.
Two Freshman teams lined up
yesterday, but they were not put
through any scrimmage work. As
sistant Coach Hauverman had
charge of one team, while Captain
Clark had charge of the second
squad. The two squads executed
plays awkwardly and without snap,
showing no sign of team work.
To-night several Freshman teams
lined up against one another for the
first scrimmage work of the season.
The game will be for fifteen-minute
halves, and will begin promptly at
4. The admission to all Freshman
campus games will be 25 cents.
The line-up of the Palo Alto high
school is as follows: Center, Van
Ebber ; right guard, Tyler ; left
guard,Arnott; right tackle, Thomas;
left tackle, Burchatn; right end,
Gossett; left end, Wagliey and
Derst; left half, Jordan; right half,
Clark;full-back,Tomasini; quarter
back, Fletcher and Beasley; substi
tute, Ostrander.
Two teams made up of Varsity
aspirants lined up against each
other for light scrimmage work yes
terday. One team devoted itself to
the task of breaking through the
line of the opposing team to block
kicks. This team was in charge of
"Heff" Williams, who was the
greatest offensive center ever pro
duced by Stanford. The backs, who
did the punting, and the defensive
line, were directed by Coach Lana
gan.
The Varsity men are still coached
in the elementary essentials of the
game, and the good result of the
policy is already apparent in the
improved manner in which the ball
is handled. The Varsity men went
through signals to-night, but did
not line up for scrimmage work.
