# English Club Committee Meets.

### 
The executive committee of the
English Club at its first meeting of
the semester considered plans for
the work of the club during the com
ing eight months. No new mem
bers were elected, but several mat
ters of importance were decided
upon.
The chief attraction to appear
under the auspices of the English
Club this semester will he Ben
Greet's famous company in "Every
man." "Everyman" was given very
successfully last year, both at Cal
ifornia and Stanford, and if this
success is repeated, it is probable
that a performance of "Hamlet 1 '
will be given later. During the sum
mer the matter came before the fac
ulty committee on entertainments,
which signed the contract with
Greet, leaving the remainder of the
work in connection with bringing
out the play in the hands of the
English Club.
The history of Stanford Univer
sity, on which the club has been
gathering material for the past
year, will be brought out in final
shape in the early part of Decem
ber. Already most of the manu
scripts are in, and only the work
of editing remains to be done. Up
to this time Assistant Professor S.
S. Seward has been in charge of the
work, but as he will not have time
to give to the undertaking this
semester, Miss Alice Kimball, '04,
was appointed to finish up the work,
with A. R. Fletcher, '06, assistant.
During the next year the English
Club will meet on the second and
fourth Wednesdays of each month.
Although no single program has
yet been determined upon, it is
planned to have a series of talks,
running through the semester, on
works of noted California writers.
