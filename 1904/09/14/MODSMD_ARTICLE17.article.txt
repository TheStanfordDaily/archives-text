# BOAT CLUB MEETS.
## Reorganization Takes Place.â€” Plane for the Coming Year Discussed. 
### 
The first meeting of the Stanford
Boat Club for this year took place
last night. It was an enthusiastic
meeting in every way, and steps
were taken to organize the club on
a firm foundation. This year
membership in the club can be
gained upon payment of an initia
tion fee of two dollars. About
twenty of last year's members, who
were present, signed up and were
admitted to membership. There
were practically no Freshmen in at
tendance at the meeting, and as
the club is especially desirous of
securing all available material,
another meeting will be held next
Tuesday at which all those inter
ested in boating are urged to be
present. In the meantime any who
may wish to join can do so by sign
ing application papers, which are
in the hands of the president, H. G.
Butterfield, '05, the captain, W. H.
Dole, '05, W. J. Morin, '05, and F.
Zimmerman, '07.
Plans for purchasing a four
oared shell were discussed. The
University of California Boating
Association has decided to pur
chase a shell, and is anxious to
have the club at Stanford buy one
at the same time, as quite a saving
can be made. The two shells can
be bought for $600, while one separ
ately would cost at least $350. As
there is but $46 in the treasury,
plans for raising money were dis
cussed. Besides the initiation fee
of two dollars several other plans
were submitted, but definite action
was deferred until the next meet
ing. The question of a coach will
also be decided at the meeting next
Tuesday.
It was the unanimous desire of
all that fall training should be
engaged in, and as there is no
water in Lagunita, a committee
composed of Captain Dole, R. H.
Gaither, '05, and \V. D. Carter,'os,
was appointed to investigate the
problem of rowing on the sloughs
in the vicinity of Cooley's Landing.
It is also a question whether it
is feasible to use a shell on La
gunita. So to provide for future con
tingencies, and to secure the stabil
ity of boating at Stanford, it seems
necessary that a body of water for
practice purposes be secured on the
bay.
