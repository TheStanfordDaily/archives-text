# FIRST STUDENT BODY ASSEMBLY HELD.
## Dr. Jordan and President A. M. Dibble of the Associated Students Make Addresses—Mrs. Stanford Present. 
### 
The first University Assembly of
the semester was held this morning,
the speakers being President Jor
dan and President Dibble of the
Associated Students. Both of them
were given warm receptions, and a
hearty cheer was given for Mrs.
Stanford, who was in the audience.
The yell leading was by E. R. May,
'06. In outlining his policy for
the year, President Dibble said:
" The only thing I can say is
that in all that I do or attempt to
do I shall be actuated by one im
pulse, guided by but one principle
—what are the best interests of the
student body as a whole? The
student body aB a whole I say, and
advisedly so. For we have passed
the days of factions, passed the
days of discord and friction, passed
the days when personal difference
will ever compromise our athletic
teams and football teams; and with
our faces toward the sunshine, are
looking forward to the achieve
ments and possibilities of a united
student bod}'.
" The student body is a team,
not of eleven men nor twenty-two
men but of hundreds, and every
man should be a wheel-horse. The
problems of student body govern
ment are your problems. Share its
privileges, share its duties. Did
you ever stop to realize where the
sovereign executive power of our
student body lies? In the hands
of nine men. Who conserve our
athletic honor? Eleven men.
Where do these men get their ideas?
Who influences their action? You
should. You should make your
self felt."
President Jordan Baid, in part:
" By a long established custom
it is the duty of the President to
give at this time a talk to the
entering Freshmen. But I am sure
that they do not need this talk.
They have come to understand
what is expected of them, and have
got down to work like veterans.
There are not many University
rules which you need to remember.
The most important one is to study
your major professor. He is a man
who has succeeded in the line along
which you are hoping to go, and it
will be good for you to know him
as well as you can. Know him as
a man —not alone as a teacher.
You will find biff personal help
worth more than many a lofty pre
cept.
"For the rest, the University ex
pects you to be ladies and gentle
men; it expects you to be sober,
honest and industrious. If you are
not the University will find it out
and send you home to ripen. It
will send away those who are not
competent and those who are not
willing to do its work. It will send
away all these, so as to leave its
classes for the strong and willing.
For the rest the University will
send away its 'grafters,' its idlers,
and those who do more harm to
others than the University does

good to them. This is not for any
thing these men may do, but for
what they are. It is not worth
while to try to give them a Stanford
education. Of this class of men
Stanford gets but few—but it doesn't
want any.
"Besides the University rules
based on the Golden Rule, the Ten
Commandments and the statutes of
California, there are certain police
rules which tend to prevent viola
tion of personal liberty, or injury
of University property, or harm
to the reputation of the University
itself —for the good name of the
University is in the hands of its
students. Wherever you go, you
take its reputation with you, and
there is nothing wicked or foolish
one of you may do which does not
react on the reputation of the whole.
'A city that is set on a hill cannot
be hid.' The doings of Stanford are
in the public eye. We cannot hide
anything in darkness, and there
fore we must act so as to have noth
ing to hide.
"A recent writer in the East says
that college men are divided into
three classes —grinds, sports, and
just boys. Just boys you are —
most of you, —but a little grinding
will sharpen your minds. Grinds
we expect you all to be, when you
have found yourselves and taken
stock of life a little. But "just
boys" will satisfy us all for the
present, with the hope that none of
you may be old before your time.
But the sports, let them take to
their clubs; they do not belong in
college, and Stanford gives them
no welcome. Grinds, girls, and
"just boys," these are enough to fill
the classes of Stanford.
"One great help in the keeping of
training rules has come to us this
summer. Mayfield has reformed
and signed the pledge. Let us
help her to keep it. Since the
University opened 800 men have
been sent away because they failed
to do a man's work in their classes.
Half of these failed because they
had caught the Mavfield habit.
They had so grossly violated the
training rules that the University
was no place for them. The trouble
with Mayfield was not alone a mat
ter of beer and tobacco. It is the
habit of loafing, the false idea of
manhood and of good fellowship,
the abuse of one's senses till he
finds a dirty bar-room, with its
thick air, foul jests, and dissolute
company, more acceptable than the
real joys of real life. It is a shame
to Stanford that Stanford men
kept the old Mayfield alive for
thirteen years with their presence
and their money. It is to the
glory of Stanford that Stanford
men and Stanford influence have
made the new Mayfield possible.
She will soon join hands with Palo
Alto as the University town worthy
of Stanford —one and indivisible.
"It is worth while to live and it
is worth while to live a clean life.
The Puritan Conscience, which
makes the strength of our country,
was not the product of its austere
creed. It was built on the keeping
of training rules. The story of
men who kept the rules they
knew is the history of America. It
must be the history of Stanford.
''Over the door of an historic
house is this famous motto, worthy
to be carved on every Stanford
arch: Innocue vivito numen adest;
Live blameless: God is here. If
we need a narrower impulse to
bring this thought near, let us say,
Live blameless: here is Stanford.
The blame that falls on you must
come to her, and we love her. Live
blameless, —and hers is the glory.
But we may bring this motive even
closer: Live blameless; you are
here. Your actions make yourself.
You are Number One. 'I can get
along without the praise of the
world or even its respect,' said a
wise man we love to honor, 4 but I
cannot get along without the re
spect of Number One.' You must
all think well of yourselves. Life
is not worth much without our own
good opinion. But we cannot keep
this good opinion unless we de
serve it. We are here all the while.
Let us then live blameless. Let us
be just boys, just girls, if need be —
and there is no baste to change—
but all the while let us take a care
not to shame our college by putting
ourselves to shame. Let us keep
the training rules we know of and
then go into the game for all that
we are worth."
I)r. Jordan took occasion to say
some encouraging words on the
subject of boating, which he said
should prosper at Stanford, as
should many other sports.

got down to work like veterans.
There are not many University
rules which you need to remember.
The most important one is to study
your major professor. He is a man
who has succeeded in the line along
which you are hoping to go, and it
will be good for you to know him
as well as you can. Know him as
a man —not alone as a teacher.
You will find biff personal help
worth more than many a lofty pre
cept.
"For the rest, the University ex
pects you to be ladies and gentle
men; it expects you to be sober,
honest and industrious. If you are
not the University will find it out
and send you home to ripen. It
will send away those who are not
competent and those who are not
willing to do its work. It will send
away all these, so as to leave its
classes for the strong and willing.
For the rest the University will
send away its 'grafters,' its idlers,
and those who do more harm to
others than the University does

good to them. This is not for any
thing these men may do, but for
what they are. It is not worth
while to try to give them a Stanford
education. Of this class of men
Stanford gets but few—but it doesn't
want any.
"Besides the University rules
based on the Golden Rule, the Ten
Commandments and the statutes of
California, there are certain police
rules which tend to prevent viola
tion of personal liberty, or injury
of University property, or harm
to the reputation of the University
itself —for the good name of the
University is in the hands of its
students. Wherever you go, you
take its reputation with you, and
there is nothing wicked or foolish
one of you may do which does not
react on the reputation of the whole.
'A city that is set on a hill cannot
be hid.' The doings of Stanford are
in the public eye. We cannot hide
anything in darkness, and there
fore we must act so as to have noth
ing to hide.
"A recent writer in the East says
that college men are divided into
three classes —grinds, sports, and
just boys. Just boys you are —
most of you, —but a little grinding
will sharpen your minds. Grinds
we expect you all to be, when you
have found yourselves and taken
stock of life a little. But "just
boys" will satisfy us all for the
present, with the hope that none of
you may be old before your time.
But the sports, let them take to
their clubs; they do not belong in
college, and Stanford gives them
no welcome. Grinds, girls, and
"just boys," these are enough to fill
the classes of Stanford.
"One great help in the keeping of
training rules has come to us this
summer. Mayfield has reformed
and signed the pledge. Let us
help her to keep it. Since the
University opened 800 men have
been sent away because they failed
to do a man's work in their classes.
Half of these failed because they
had caught the Mavfield habit.
They had so grossly violated the
training rules that the University
was no place for them. The trouble
with Mayfield was not alone a mat
ter of beer and tobacco. It is the
habit of loafing, the false idea of
manhood and of good fellowship,
the abuse of one's senses till he
finds a dirty bar-room, with its
thick air, foul jests, and dissolute
company, more acceptable than the
real joys of real life. It is a shame
to Stanford that Stanford men
kept the old Mayfield alive for
thirteen years with their presence
and their money. It is to the
glory of Stanford that Stanford
men and Stanford influence have
made the new Mayfield possible.
She will soon join hands with Palo
Alto as the University town worthy
of Stanford —one and indivisible.
"It is worth while to live and it
is worth while to live a clean life.
The Puritan Conscience, which
makes the strength of our country,
was not the product of its austere
creed. It was built on the keeping
of training rules. The story of
men who kept the rules they
knew is the history of America. It
must be the history of Stanford.
''Over the door of an historic
house is this famous motto, worthy
to be carved on every Stanford
arch: Innocue vivito numen adest;
Live blameless: God is here. If
we need a narrower impulse to
bring this thought near, let us say,
Live blameless: here is Stanford.
The blame that falls on you must
come to her, and we love her. Live
blameless, —and hers is the glory.
But we may bring this motive even
closer: Live blameless; you are
here. Your actions make yourself.
You are Number One. 'I can get
along without the praise of the
world or even its respect,' said a
wise man we love to honor, 4 but I
cannot get along without the re
spect of Number One.' You must
all think well of yourselves. Life
is not worth much without our own
good opinion. But we cannot keep
this good opinion unless we de
serve it. We are here all the while.
Let us then live blameless. Let us
be just boys, just girls, if need be —
and there is no baste to change—
but all the while let us take a care
not to shame our college by putting
ourselves to shame. Let us keep
the training rules we know of and
then go into the game for all that
we are worth."
I)r. Jordan took occasion to say
some encouraging words on the
subject of boating, which he said
should prosper at Stanford, as
should many other sports.
The first University Assembly of
the semester was held this morning,
the speakers being President Jor
dan and President Dibble of the
Associated Students. Both of them
were given warm receptions, and a
hearty cheer was given for Mrs.
Stanford, who was in the audience.
The yell leading was by E. R. May,
'06. In outlining his policy for
the year, President Dibble said:
" The only thing I can say is
that in all that I do or attempt to
do I shall be actuated by one im
pulse, guided by but one principle
—what are the best interests of the
student body as a whole? The
student body aB a whole I say, and
advisedly so. For we have passed
the days of factions, passed the
days of discord and friction, passed
the days when personal difference
will ever compromise our athletic
teams and football teams; and with
our faces toward the sunshine, are
looking forward to the achieve
ments and possibilities of a united
student bod}'.
" The student body is a team,
not of eleven men nor twenty-two
men but of hundreds, and every
man should be a wheel-horse. The
problems of student body govern
ment are your problems. Share its
privileges, share its duties. Did
you ever stop to realize where the
sovereign executive power of our
student body lies? In the hands
of nine men. Who conserve our
athletic honor? Eleven men.
Where do these men get their ideas?
Who influences their action? You
should. You should make your
self felt."
President Jordan Baid, in part:
" By a long established custom
it is the duty of the President to
give at this time a talk to the
entering Freshmen. But I am sure
that they do not need this talk.
