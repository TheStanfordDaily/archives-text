## List of Those Who Will Assist in Getting Out the Class Annual. 
### 
E. It. May, editor-in-chief of the
'06 Quad, to-day announced his list
of appointments to associateships
on the editorial staff of the annual.
The staff will be composed of the
same number of associates as last
year, and includes the nine mem
bers of the class who have stood
forth prominently in a literary
way during the past two years.
It will l)e made up as follows: Miss
E. R. Mirrielees, P. C. Edwards, L.
R. Weinmann, W. H. B. Fowler, J.
F. Cahoon, J. Nibley, M. M.
Stearns, B. S. Allen, and E. G.
Dudley. With the election of J.
L. Maloy to the bußiness-manager
ship last week, the board is now
complete.
As yet none of the departments
have been assigned, and little can
be said as to the plans for getting
out the book. This year's Quad
will follow in the main the ideas
that have been embodied in those
of the last three years, and beyond
a few minor details will not at
tempt any striking departure. Its
chief idea, in common with last
year's Quad, will be to present a
record-book, but at the same time
the greatest amount of attention
possible will be paid to the literary
and art departments. The josh
department will be slightly en
larged if the quality of the joshes
handed in seems to warrant it. In
the department of organizations
uniformity will be the chief aim.
