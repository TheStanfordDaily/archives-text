The first football game of the
season is to take place to-morrow
afternoon, between the Freshman
eleven and the Palo Alto high
school team. This is the initial
test of the first-year men in college
football. Everyone wants to see
them get started off in the right
way and under favorable condi
tions. Moreover, everyone wants
to see the entire series of contests
begin with an enthusiasm and
spirit that has never been equalled
in the past. To-morrow's game
and all subsequent practice games
of the season should see every
available seat on the bleachers oc
cupied. The rooters cannot begin
too early to encourage the players
and to show the Freshmen candi
dates the good that comes from
loyal support. It is hoped that
Stanford will carry off both games
this year. The football men are
going to do their best, and have
been doing so for over a week. It
rests with the rooters to keep up
the pace and turn out the best
body of enthusiasts that can pos
sibly be gathered together. No
time for beginning the songs and
yells is more opportune than at the
first game of the season.
