Time of halves, 10 and 15 min
utes. Officials: Clark, '05, referee,
and Bartell, '05, umpire and time
keeper.
The Freshmen took the kick-off
in the first half and sent the ball
to the 30-yard line, where Wag
hey of the high school team
fumbled to the first-year men. In
side of two minutes a series of line
smashing bucks by the '08 men
landed the ball safely across their
opponents' goal-line. The touch
down by Vandervoort was followed
by a well-directed goal by Moody,
and the score stood 6 to 0.
The first-year team kicked off
again to the 25-yard line, and then
forced the Palo Alto eleven to kick
on the third down. The Freshmen
advanced the ball 30 yards on end
runs, but on trying to gain through
the line were held and forced to
kick. The high school returned the
punt, and time was called with the
Freshmen in possession of the ball
on their opponents' 25-yard line.
Between halves the personnel of
the Freshman eleven was entirely
changed, and throughout the rest
of the game many first-year men
were given a trial.
Palo Alto kicked off in the second
half to the 30-yard line. The Fresh
men ran the ball in ten yards.
After a series of small gains the
Freshmen lost the ball on an inex
cusable fumble. Palo Alto then
kicked to the 20-yard line, where
the ball was again secured by the
Freshmen. The first-year team con
tinued to advance the ball to the
35-yard line. There they were
penalized 5 yards for an off-side
play. Unable to gain the requisite
5 yards, the Freshmen were com
pelled to punt. It was now Palo
Alto's ball, in the middle of the
field. Another penalty of 5
yards was imposed on the Fresh

men for an off-side plav. Palo Alto
punted, and the Freshmen got the
ball on their 30-yard line. The
first-year men again lost the ball
by a bad fumble. Palo Alto failed
to gain and tried an unsuccessful
place-kick.
The Fresh i:en secured the ball
on their 5-yard line. The Fresh
men kicked to 40-yard line, and
Palo Alto fumbled the ball. The
Freshmen advanced the ball 15
yards by a series of end runs, but
the backs did not seem to be able to
successfully buck the high school
line. The game ended with the ball
near the center of the field.
