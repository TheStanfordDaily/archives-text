# California Freshmen Win.
## 
### 
The freshmen of the University
of California won their first game
of the season against a team from
the Oakland high school by a score
of 6-0 yesterday. The game was
played on the University of Cali
fornia gridiron, and the Oakland
team took the place of the San
Francisco Polytechnic School,
which sent word at the last mo
ment that they could not play.
The California players tore
through their opponents' line and
ran the ends at will. Short halves
were played, but the periods were
replete with fast and interesting
plays. More than one member of
the California freshman squad
showed up as a distinct varsity
possibility. This was particularly
true in the case of the back field,
where Sperry and Golcher proved
themselves ground gainers of no
small ability.
The good showing of the baby
team of the University of Califor
nia so early in the season proves
that - the Stanford freshmen will
have a hard team to face in the
intercollegiate Freshman match.
