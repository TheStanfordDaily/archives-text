# MANDOLIN CLUB TRY-OUT.
## Unusually Small Number in Last Night's Competition.—To Give New Opportunity. 
### 
The Mandolin Club preliminary
try-out was held in room 50 last
night. The following new men
were chosen by the committee:
Mandolins —H. E. Suggles, '07,
C. N. Leach, '08, L. Wathey, '08,
F. W. Dorr, '08, W. T. Young, '08,
and F. R. Lanagan, '08.
Guitars —F. P. Whitaker, '05, E.
R. Garfias, '06, E. lv. Soper, '08,
W. G. Bateman, '08, F. D. Mahone,
'08, and H. S. Ross, '08.
The following old men are back,
and with the new men will com
pose the club this semester:
Mandolins —N. E. Dole, '04, \V.
H. Lanagan, '05, H. Powers, '05,
A. \V. Hooper, '05, C. Cortes, '05, J.
Rosenfeld, '06, and G. E. Dole, '07.
Guitars —F. B. Goudy, '05, W.
1). Carter, '05, E. R. May, '06, and
A. Rosenfeld, '07.
The small number of men who
tried out was a surprise, as it was
expected that there would be plenty
of material in the entering class.
A great many men do not come out
because of lack of confidence or be
cause they have an exaggerated
idea of what will be required of
them. There is a good chance this
year for new men, especially guitar
players, and any man who has
any knowledge of an instrument
should at least come out and see
what he can do. The experience
will do him good and help him to
make the club later on even if he
should fail to do so this year. Any
one wishing to try-out, who has not
already done so, will be given an
opportunity by seeing the leader,
\V. H. Lanagan, '05.
The stuntists who are to accom
pany the clubs will be selected
later. With the loss of Bush and
Baker there is plenty of room for
good competition along this line.
Of the stuntists now in college who
have been with the clubs before,
there are E. R. May, '06, who last
year made a hit in some original
stunts with D. R. Wilson, ex-'O6;
M. M. Stearns, '06, and L. I).
Byrne, '05, monologists. But as
not all, if any, of these men expect
to try-out this year, there is a fine
opening for new men with original
ideas.
