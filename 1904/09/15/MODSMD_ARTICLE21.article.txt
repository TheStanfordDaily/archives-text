# UNIVERSITY ORCHESTRA.
## Leader and Manager Elected.â€”Preparations Made for a Larger Body of Players. 
### 
The election of officers by the
University Orchestra last night re
sulted in there election of M. H.
Thorpe, '05, to the position of
leader, and C. W. Weiser, '02, as
manager.
It is the intention of the manage
ment to enlarge the orchestra to a
membership of forty or fifty this
year. Candidates for the various
places are numerous, but there are
more players wanted. The orches
tra has room for all the stringed
instruments that can qualify, being
particularly in need of violins, vio
lincellos, and bass viols. Men to
play horns, oboes, and saxaphones
are also wanted, and as yet no one
has been secured to play the traps.
The orchestra will practice once a
week. The first practice is to be
held in the chapel on Wednesday
evening, September 21st. All stu
dents desiring to join the organiza
tion should be present at that time.
Although not under the control
of the student body, the orchestra
will endeavor to become more de
cidedly a student organization. It
will be prepared to play at student
gatherings upon request, and will
be heard oftener this year than in
the past. As yet no definite plans
as to trips have been formed, but it
is expected that the orchestra will
take one or more short trips, as was
done last year.
