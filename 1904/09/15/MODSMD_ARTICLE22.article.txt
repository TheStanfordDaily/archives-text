# Improvements at Residence.
## 
### 
A great amount of improvement
is being made on the private
grounds of Mrs. Stanford. The
stone and the bronze gates that
were at the main entrance of the
arboretum have been placed at the
private entrance near the Menlo
bridge. New driveways and lawns
are being made, and a number of
rustic benches are being built. A
retaining wall of heavy timber is
being built along the creek in order
to prevent the washing away of the
grounds.
