# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Governing Body of Associated Students Fill Vacancy on Committee. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students met last night
in regular session and transacted
some important business.
The project of electing an assist
ant yell leader was discussed at
length, but no definite action was
taken. It was suggested, however,
that several men be tried out for
the place, and the most successful
chosen. E. Y. Pomeroy, '05, is
prominently mentioned in connec
tion with the place, and he will
assist M. H. Thorpe on the oval for
a few days.
A committee from the Tennis
Club appeared before the commit
tee and requested that the new ten
nis courts be completed. Manager
Barrett was instructed to proceed
with the work at an expense not to
exceed $40. The Tennis Club has
agreed to assist Manager Barrett in
directing the completion of the
courts.
R. M. Blodget, '07, was elected a
member of the Executive Com
mittee to fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of I. A. Swain, ex
'o7, who will not return to college
this year. Blodget is a chemistry
special and registers from Bakers
field.
