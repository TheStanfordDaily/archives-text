# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Light Scrimmage Work by Both Varsity and Freshman Squads. 
### 
The football squad was instruct
ed in all departments of the game
by the coaches last night. Falling
on the ball was practiced for some
time, and the awkwardness of the
men showed that further practice in
this line its badly needed.
Two Varsity squads again lined
up against each other in order to
block kicks, but neither line showed
up very well either in tactics or de
fense. Just at present the coaches
are devoting more attention to
the line than the backs. In run
ning down on punts the ends are
showing more Bpeed than they ex
hibited last week, but the slow grid
iron is not favorable to fast work.
The dust on the gridiron has also
caused some annoyance to the play
ers, but this trouble will be obvi
ated by the application of another
coat of sawdust. Coach Lanagan
prefers, in practice and preliminary
matches, to sacrificespeed for safety.
After being put through some se
vere signal work, two Freshman
teams were lined up against each
other for the first scrimmage work of
the season. Both teams were awk
ward, and played very loose ball.
On straight bucks each line held
after a fashion, but on end runs
neither team had much difficulty in
advancing the ball. Both teams
punted frequently, and the work of
catching the punts and running
down on the ball was very ragged.
Fumbles were frequent and costly,
and the plays were executed with
out snap or vim.
The last preliminary game be
fore the intercollegiate Freshman
match will be played October Bth,
against a team from the Palo Alto
Academy. This is the first football
season for the academy, and its team
is practically an unknown quan
tity. It has an abundance of ma
terial to select from, and the team
will be strengthened by men who
have good records from other pre
paratory schools.
M. J. Bartell, '05, who played
right end on the'o2 Varsity,returned
yesterday and will probably be out
on the field next week.
