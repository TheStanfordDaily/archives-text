# STANFORD VS. OLYMPIC.
## Varsity Will Meet Club Men in First Big Preliminary Event. 
### 
The Varsity football Beason will
be opened to-morrow in a game
against the Olympic Club team of
San Francisco. The club men
have one of the heaviest teams on
the Coast, and the Varsity will do
well to hold their own against
them in the game to-morrow. The
Varsity will be crippled by the ab
sence of W. H. Dole, '05, and W.
K. Roosevelt, '05, who are both ill,
and will not appear in the line-up.
A large number of the Varsity can
didates will be given an opportun
ity to show what they can do in
the game against the heavy club
men, and it is probable that three
distinct Varsity teams will line up
against the club team before the
contest is finished.
This is the first season for several
years that the Olympic Club has
been represented by a football
team, and unusual efforts have
been made to choose a team worthy
of the big athletic club. The names
of most of the players on the team
have become familiar to Stanford
football followers on account of
their connection with the Reliance
Club team during former seasons.
Cavanaugh, who played center for
the University of Chicago, and
made the All-Western team, will
probably prove the most formid
able obstacle to Cardinal success in
the game to-morrow, as the Varsity
has no experienced center to pit
against him. Smock, quarter-back
and captain of the team, also
played with Reliance last year.
He is a fast, heady player, and
handles his te im with rare general
ship. Gaffey played a good game
on the line for Reliance last year.
Bishop has a brilliant record as a
preparatory school player. Ralph
McFadden, who will play right
tackle for the club men, played
that position on the Stanford Var
sity for two years. Slaker is also
an old Varsity man who will figure
in the club team line-up. After
representing his college for two
years on the football team, Slaker
became assistant coach at Stanford
and held that position until this
season. The other players in the
Olympic line-up are not so well
known to the University public,
but they are reputed to be first
class football men.
The game will commence prompt
ly at 3:30, and twenty-minute
halves will be played. The ad
mission will be fifty cents to all
Varsity campus games.
The line-up of the Olympic Club
team is as follows: Center, Cava
naugh; left guard, Gaffey; right
guard, Keegan; left tackle, Martin;
right tackle, McFadden; left end,
Golcher; right end, Thomas or
Harper; quarter-back, Smock (cap
tain); left half, Moody; right half,
Bishop; full-back, Slaker; substi
tutes, La Roue, Lange, Abies,
Kingston, and Harper.
