The efforts of Captain Bell and
Trainer Moulton in getting the
year'fi track work under way at this
early date are, indeed, commend
able. But few of last year's point
winners have returned to college,
and with many men to be devel
oped into athletes of Varsity qual
ity, it is important that fall train
ing begin early, and that it be
more thorough than ever before.
The attitude of those in charge of
track athletics clearly shows that
they realize the situation and the
urgency of turning every stone
from now until next April. Every
Freshman of sound physique
should turn out in answer to the
call of captain and trainer. If a
Freshman has never done track
work before, that fact will make no
difference. Trainer Moulton has
developed many new men before,
and will be only too willing to de
vote his time to candidates who
are willing to try.
