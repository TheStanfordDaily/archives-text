# Removal of Mosaics.
## 
### 
Workmen are engaged in chang
ing parts of the mosaics which
decorate the front of the Memorial
Church. The two larger figures at
each side of the arch are to he re
moved to make way for new
mosaics. These new mosaic de
signs will be a continuation of the
large central group which depicts
"The Sermon on the Mount." It
is believed that in this way the
effectiveness of the whole will be
greatly enhanced. The new mosa
ics are now nearing completion at
Naples, Italy, and are expected
here in the course of a month.
