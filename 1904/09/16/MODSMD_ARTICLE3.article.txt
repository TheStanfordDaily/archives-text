# TO HAVE FALL TRAINING.
## Captain Bell Will Have Old and New Men Out for Light Work. 
### 
Captain Bell of the track team
and Trainer Moulton are already
making plans for the development
of the material at their hands into
a winning team next season. The
first step to be taken will be the
beginning of fall training, which
will commence next Monday. Cap
tain and trainer are anxious that
every man who intends to do track
work next spring shall come out at
the present time, and to that end
all men who are taking gymnasium
work will be relieved of twenty
minutes of indoor work if they wish
to substitute track therefor. It is
regarded as especially desirable
that the new men answer the call
at once, not only that a line may
be secured upon their capabilities,
but also that there may be longer
time for development along proper
lines. Men from a preparatory
school or entirely new to the cinder
path frequently work upon a wrong
system or upon no system at all,
and if the coaches have several
months in which to detect and
remedy the error, the best that a
man has in him may be brought
out in his first season.
For the veterans of the track and
the field, fall training is valuable
because it serves to keep them in
good general condition. It is prob
able that most of the team of last
year who are now in college will
answer Captain Bell's call, and to
some of these will be entrusted the
coaching of new men in their special
work. Among the point winners
of last season who have returned,
besides Captain Bell, are W. H.
Lanagan, '05, who took first place
in both high and low hurdles in
the last intercollegiate meet; R. \V.
West, '06, who took first in the
broad jump; W. E. Crawford, '05,
who beat Sperry of California in
the hammer-throw; MacFarland,
'07, second in the low hurdles; N.
Dole, '04, the pole-vaulter; O. E.
Hyde, '05, who won the shot-put,
making a new Western intercol
legiate record; and former Captain
Holman, '05, who easily won the
mile and the half-mile. Dole,
Hyde and Holman are ineligible
for further intercollegiate contests
because of the four-year rule.
Work will be done both in the
morning and the afternoon, and
will be under the general super
vision of Trainer Moulton and Cap
tain Bell. Moulton will be upon
the track in the morning, and in
the afternoon will attend to the
track men until the football squad
claims his attention. In the after
noon Captain Bell himself will be
out to attend to the jumpers.
Owing to the fact that the gridiron
absorbs the old jumps, new ones
will probably be built to the rear
of the northern goal-posts.
There will practically be a volun
teer training board to assist Captain
Bell and Trainer Moulton in the
work. Holman, last year's captain,
cannot compete again because of
the four-year rule, but he will be
out on the track to assist with the
middle-distance men. O. E. Hyde,
the shot-putter, is likewise barred

from future intercollegiate meets,
but his help will be invaluable in
developing new men in this special
event, which threatens to be one of
Stanford's weakest points if new
men do not turn out very well.
Dole will probaly also be out at the
pole-vault to keep in form for the
Pacific Coast championship, when
he will have another chance at the
world's record in case the record of
12 feet If inches made by him
at the University of California last
spring should not be allowed by the
Amateur Athletic Union. With the
dropping out of Dole and Beach,
the Cardinal has lost its best two
vaulters. F. P. Whitaker, '05, has
returned, and Bell may vaultagain,
but an effort will be made to de
velop promising new men.
Captain Bell is at present looking
forward to a handicap field-day to
occur soon after the intercollegiate
football game in November, and
perhaps another scratch meet a lit
tle later to afford means of judging
the progress made. The men are
expected to work only three days a
week —Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays —and they will not be re
quired to sign regular training
rules, although expected to live with
reasonable regularity. A meeting
to talk over the situation will be
called by Captain Bell for next Fri
day evening, September 23d.
