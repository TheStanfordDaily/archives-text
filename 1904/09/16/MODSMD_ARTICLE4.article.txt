# Gymnasium Registration.
## 
### 
The registration at Encina gym
nasium for this semester has been
completed. The figures show that
an unusually large number of men
are taking the work, and the classes
at 11:15, 4:30, and 5:15 are
crowded. The total number en
rolled is 392, and by classes is as
follows: 10:15 class, 44; 11:15
class, 111; 4:30 class, 111; 5:30
class, 126. The number of men in
the 5:15 class is the largest num
ber which the gymnasium can pos
sibly accommodate. Fifteen men,
who cannot take the work at any
other time, are waiting to get into
this class, in case any of the men
now there change to another hour.
