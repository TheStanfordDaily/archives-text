# DR. RODGER SPEAKS.
## Interesting Lecture in Chapel on Scientific View-point of Religion. 
### 
Dr. J. G. Rodger spoke in the
chapel last night on the subject,
"Does Science Furnish a Basis for
Religion?" He said in substance
as follows: We must make a new
adjustment of our broader ideas
gained through science to the old
ideas of Christianity and religion.
As our scientific knowledge devel
ops we must ask the question, Does
science give us any basis for re
ligion? We must face the question
honestly and squarely, Does science
supplant or support the idea of re
ligion? All students, especially
those who do any thinking, invari
ably at some time begin to ques
tion. It is not less doubting
which we want in religion; it is
more thinking. If honest in his
questionings, one will invariably
arrive at the true conception of
things. And when this has been
attained, he is far stronger than
the one who has never sought to
investigate.
All men, skeptics as well as
Christians, accept one great funda
mental religious truth —and all
truth when rightly considered is
religious, for truth is simply the
right relation to the great ultimate
source of all being. It is this:
Does any man doubt his own self,
his conscious individuality, his
rational being, capable of thinking
and of loving? This fact is the
great scientific basis for coming to
the conclusion that the great
source of all is personal, rational,
and capable of loving. Is there
any connection between this start
ing point and the conclusion? The
starting point is admitted by the
atheist and the Christian alike.
We have before us exhibitions of
physical life in plants and animals,
as living, developing organisms.
Have we any right to say that that
plant or that animal comes from a
source higher than, or at least as
high as, itself? —or from a lower
source? Dr. Rodger drew an
analogy, by way of illustration, be
tween the physical law of life and
the physical law of gravitation,
showing that any fountain of water
must always come from a source at
least as high as itself. The great
scientist Tyndall once said, " I see
in eternal matter'the promise and
potency of every form of life."
Some years after, having tried in
numerable experiments to prove
his statement, he was forced to com
pletely reverse his verdict and say,
"We have no scientific data for
saying that life can come from any
thing but life." The biologist has
changed his basis. It is now an
undisputed law of science that there
cannot be brought forth life from
matter devoid of germs. This gives
rise to the following corollary:
Primitive life must have come,
directly or indirectly, from a source
as high as itself. Whatever grade
of life we see is the primitive plus
the result of forces and laws.
Taking it from a purely scientific
standpoint, the law of biology is the
law of the stream of life: There has
never been a life except from a life
at least as high as itself. Sen
suousness, however, is not the
only characteristic of all life; it is
simply the universal characteristic
seen in every animal. Can the
source of the stream of life come
from any lower than scientific sen
suousness? The stream has risen,
through evolution and development,
to personality and rationality and
lovability in man. Can the source
be a fraction of an inch lower? We
are living books, living radiations,
that the great Source must stand at
least as high as we are; that the
Source must be an Intelligence, per
sonal, rational, loving. And as by
development we shall continue to
rise, it is a living sign that the
Source is yet higher than we. We
shall soon he recognising the sci
ences as revelations of the ultimate
Truth, and they will become the
greatest aid which religion could
have in harmonising what we know
with what we believe.
An effort will be made to have
Dr. Rodger give a series of lectures
along this line sometime during the
winter.
