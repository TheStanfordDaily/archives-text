# DR. RODGER SPEAKS.
## Interesting Lecture in Chapel on Scientific View-point of Religion. 
### 
Dr. J. G. Rodger spoke in the
chapel last night on the subject,
"Does Science Furnish a Basis for
Religion?" He said in substance
as follows: We must make a new
adjustment of our broader ideas
gained through science to the old
ideas of Christianity and religion.
As our scientific knowledge devel
ops we must ask the question, Does
science give us any basis for re
ligion? We must face the question
honestly and squarely, Does science
supplant or support the idea of re
ligion? All students, especially
those who do any thinking, invari
ably at some time begin to ques
tion. It is not less doubting
which we want in religion; it is
more thinking. If honest in his
questionings, one will invariably
arrive at the true conception of
things. And when this has been
attained, he is far stronger than
the one who has never sought to
investigate.
All men, skeptics as well as
Christians, accept one great funda
mental religious truth —and all
truth when rightly considered is
religious, for truth is simply the
right relation to the great ultimate
source of all being. It is this:
Does any man doubt his own self,
his conscious individuality, his
rational being, capable of thinking
and of loving? This fact is the
great scientific basis for coming to
the conclusion that the great
source of all is personal, rational,
and capable of loving. Is there
any connection between this start
ing point and the conclusion? The
starting point is admitted by the
atheist and the Christian alike.
We have before us exhibitions of
physical life in plants and animals,
as living, developing organisms.
Have we any right to say that that
plant or that animal comes from a
source higher than, or at least as
high as, itself? —or from a lower
source? Dr. Rodger drew an
analogy, by way of illustration, be
tween the physical law of life and
the physical law of gravitation,
showing that any fountain of water
must always come from a source at
least as high as itself. The great
scientist Tyndall once said, " I see
in eternal matter'the promise and
