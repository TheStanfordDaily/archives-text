"A
FRIEND
Close friendships follow an introduction to
our glasses. They will supply just the help
you need if worn in time. Let us introduce you.
Too many people never come to glassesâ€”they
wait for glasses to come to them.
The strain which flrst manifests itself as a
slight discomfort should be promptly removed
by proper glasses.
When in doubt about the right time for
glasses or uncertain iu regard to the right kind
" See us and see right."
