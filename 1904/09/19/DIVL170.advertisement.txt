College
Doctor
Pond's Extract is an everyday stand-by
among college students. They know
that it is a sovereign remedy for the
many accidents incidental to school
life. Pond's Extract—the old family
doctor—might with equal propriety bo
called the old college doctor. For over
60years Pond's Extract has been doing
a work of mercy—curing cuts, bruises,
burns; relieving aches and pains;
easing suffering, and making life
brighter. It is just as efficient to-day.
A bottle should always be kept conve
nient. Soothes and freshens the face
after shaving. Don'texperiment with
so-called remediessaidto
lie "just as good as Pond's
Extract"—there is no
substitute. Watered Witch
Hazol, a weak solution
—sometimes offered in
place of Pond's Extract
—has no medicinal
value—is positively
worthless. Pond's Ex
tract CURES—therefore
is priceless.
•Sold only in sealed bottles
under buff wrapper.
ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE.
