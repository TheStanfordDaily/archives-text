# VARSITY DEFEATED.
## Olympic Club Eleven Outplays Stanford in First Preliminary Contest. 
### 
The first Varsity football game
of the season was lost to the Olym
pic Club by a score of 5-0. The
game, while brilliant occasionally,
was on the whole a poor exhibition.
The Olympic team proved to be an
aggregation of iieavy, fast players,
but they showed a lack of practice.
The best work for the clubmen was
done by Slaker and McFadden,
both former Varsity men. Slaker,
who was assistant coach for two
years after playing the same length
of time on the Varsity, played full
back for the visitors, and distin
guished himself by making the
only touch-down of the game. Mc-
Fadden, who played tackle on the
Varsity for two years, occupied his
old position, and made many yards
for the Olympics. He also did the
punting for the clubmen.
The Olympic team is much faster
than the Reliance was last year,
and it is probable that they will
continue to be formidable oppo
nents of the two college teams before
the season is over.
During the progress of the game
practically every player on the Var
sity squad was given a chance to
show what he could do against the
heavy clubmen. At no time during
the game were there more than four
old Varsity men in the Stanford line
up at the same time.
The one unpleasant feature of the
game was an injury to F. W. Hasel
wood, '06, who had his collarbone
badly fractured in a scrimmage. It
is not probable that he will be able
to play again this season.
The touch-down by the Olympic
team was made early in the second
half, and was partly due to a bad
fumble. During the first half the
ball was kept near the center of the
field, but with one exception it was
in Olympic territory during the
whole of the first period of play.
The same thing was true of the sec
ond half.

Stanford kicked off in the first
half, and the ball was carried back
and forth near the middle of the
field during the whole of that per
iod. Both teams failed repeatedly
to gain the requisite five yards, and
punting was frequent on both sides.
Slaker was the principal ground
gainer for the clubmen during this
half. Neither team was able to run
the ends, but line bucking by either
seldom failed to gain. The first
half ended with the ball near the
middle of the gridiron, but in Olym
pic territory.
Stanford was making good gains
in the second half when the Var
sity left-half fumbled a high pass.
Goschen secured the ball and
was downed on the ten-yard line.
Slaker carried the ball over the
Stanford goal-line for a touch-down.
Captain Smock of the Olympics
failed to kick a goal, and the score
was 5-0 in favor of the visitors,
Play was resumed and Stanford
carried the ball to the Olympic
twenty-yard line, and the second
period ended without further scor
ing.
