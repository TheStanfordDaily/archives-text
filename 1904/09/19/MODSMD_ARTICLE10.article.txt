Eighty is a conservative estimate
of the number of men who viewed
the football game last Saturday
from the windows of Encina Hall,
and thereby showed that they are
sadly lacking in the rudimentary
principles that form the foundation
of the Stanford spirit. If there had
been none but Freshmen among the
unlicensed onlookers there might
be some small ground on which to
excuse the offense. But such was
not the case, for several pairs of
corduroys were seen by those more
loyal members of the student body
who occupied seats on the bleachers.
Every Freshman ought to know,
and every old student does know,
that viewing a football game from
any place, other than an honestly
purchased space within the oval, is
nothing more nor less than grafting
on the student body. In other words,
those eighty men who crowded
the windows of Encina last Satur
day unlawfully took forty dollars
worth of goods from the stock in
trade of the Associated Students
This matter is not new. It has
been harped on by every past edi
tor of the Daily Palo Alto, and it
has been preached from the plat
form of Assembly Hall on many
different occasions. The general
sentiment of the student body is
strong against this violation of
Stanford principles. A more forci
ble assertion of that sentiment by
upper-classmen ought to be suffi
cient to stop the unlawful prac
tice.
