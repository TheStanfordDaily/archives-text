# Zoologists Campfire.
## 
### 
On Friday evening a party of
twenty-eight Zoology majors, at the
invitation of Associate Professor
Heath, picnicked at the black basalt
columns on the E'ortola road. The
outing served merely as a prelimi
nary to more extended expeditions
which will take place in the near
future. It is Professor Heath's in
tention to have the Zoology stu
dents camp for a night in the foot
hills around San Jose in order to
gather specimens for the laboratory
work.
