# MEMORIAL CHURCH SERVICES.
## Regular Sunday Sermon Preached by Dr. Gardner Yesterday Morning. 
### 
Chaplain Gardner preached at
the morning service in Memorial
Church Sunday. His text was
from Genesis 4:9, "Am I My Broth
er's Keeper?" The question is
veritably aa old as Adam, but
though very old it is yet ever new.
it is exemplified in later biblical
teachings in the story of the Good
Samaritan. And in that story lies
the very genius of Christianity,
for it teaches loyalty and altruism
not only to those of our own rela
tion and race but to everybody. It
is the expression of Universal
Brotherhood.
No one would dare to deny that
he is his brother's keeper in regard
to life. Nor do we, generally speak
ing, fail in all our duty to our blood
relations; nor to others in extreme
cases of sickness and distress. But
we are broadening in our concep
tion of our duty toward our fellow
men in general. Twenty centuries
of Christian teaching has done its
work, and the brotherhood idea is
taking active form in the formation
of fraternal orders and college set
tlements and Christian humani
tarian missions.
There is an organization now be
ing formed in San Francisco look
ing toward the protection of the
shop girls from the insatiable and
selfish greed of their employers.
This should receive the support of
every Stanford student, for though
we are not directly concerned we
are potentially members of busi
ness, thought, etc., of the future,
and as such should learn not to
lose sight of moral duty. There
is more question bound up in the
problem of capital and labor than
is ever shown in the study of eco
nomics. There are social and re
ligious duties, and some moral
qualities about it—justice, wisdom,
kindness, and action.
The fraternal idea in this Uni
versity is menaced by the methods
of temptition placed before new
men being rushed. Some of the
fraternities lose sight of the fact
that they should protect rather than
discredit a man's moral principles
and character, upon his first enter
ing into the new surroundings and
associations. It is a common say
ing that a fraternity will make or
break a man according to the spirit
with which it is imbued; and
where the sense of moral duty is
overlooked its greatest power for
good is lost. It has been a custom
on the part of many to "knock"
the Y. M. C. A. here. But this is
unjust and unreasonable, for there
is no organization in college which
accomplishes as much good in its
way or has a higher or more altru
istic purpose —the true idea of
brotherhood. At least let the
"knockers" imitate them in the
unselfishness of their work.
We should cultivate by prayer
and by action love of our brother
being. Take this principle of
brotherhood for your own code. It
is the purest sentiment which can
possibly come out of your -life.
