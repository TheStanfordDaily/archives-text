Times during the past year your eye
lids have opened and closed. Thirty
thousand times a day you wink.
The muscles of the eye are used
more than any other muscles in the
body. From the moment you wake
in the morning until you go to sleep
at night your eyes are at work, and
unless they are in perfect condition
they are unable to stand this constant
labor.
Care for your eyes and they will
care for you. When they need help
come to us. We can supply the
only help for defective eyes—right
GLASSES.
EXAMINATION FREE.
