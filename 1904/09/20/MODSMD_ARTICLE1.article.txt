# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Both Squads Still Coached in the Fundamentals of the Game. 
### 
Both the Varsity and Freshman
squads are still being coached in
the rudiments of the game, and a
considerable portion of each prac
tice period is devoted to elementary
tactics. It is Lanagan's policy to
thoroughly ground the candidates
in the first principles of the game
before two teams are lined up
against each other. In pursuance
of this plan the players were in
structed yesterday in all the de
partments of the game except heavy
scrimmage work. Several men of
the Varsity squad were tried at
kicking goals, and did good work
considering their lack of practice.
T. M. Williams, 'S7, was again on
the gridiron, assisting Coach Lana
gan in the instruction of linemen.
While the ends were running down
on punts, one line was opposed to
another in an effort to block the
kicks. Considerable improvement
was noticed in the defensive work
of the linemen. The work of the
ends in running down on punts is
becoming much surer and faster.
The large Freshman squad has
been materially reduced this week,
and Hauverman is now enabled to
give each candidate more personal
attention. The coaches have had
so i:e difficulty with members of
the Freshman squad, who were not
disposed to obey orders without
protest. The summary expulsion
of one of these malcontents from
the squad has served to teach the
others that infractions of discipline
will not be tolerated by the coaches.
The work of the Freshmen, while
showing slight improvement, is not
progressing to the satisfaction of
the coaches, who may make several
radical changes in the line-up of
the '08 team this week.
In contrast to the '07 Freshman
team, only one candidate on this
year's squad has proved a distinct
Varsity possibility. Last year the
names of four members of the
Freshman team appeared constant
ly in the Varsity line-up until
within a week of the Freshman in
tercollegiate match.
The next preliminary Freshman
game will take place Thursday.
The opposing team will be from
Santa Clara College. This team
in former years has given a good
account of itself in contests against
Freshman teams, and the aggrega
tion representing the college this
season consists mainly of veterans
who have had considerable football
experience.
