The college papers and periodi
cals are direct products of the stu
dent body, and as such they should
have the support of every man and
woman in the University. It is
generally reported this year that
there is not as large a subscription
list to the magazines as there was
last year. As a matter of fact there
should he a larger number of sub
scribers than ever before, for the
constant growth of the student
body and of the alumni ought
naturally to be accompanied by a
similar growth in the subscription
list. The reason that there are
not more subscribers is not because
the students do not read college
publications, but because a great
many of them read the copies pur
chased by friends and neighbors.
It is not an exaggeration to say
that there is no man or woman
in the student body but who
can afford to take at least one
of the college papers; that
there are a number who can
afford to take two, and a great
many who can afford to subscribe
for all three of the undergraduate
publications. Consequently, the
man or woman who does not sub
scribe for any of the papers is, or
at least should be, rated along with
those persons who stand along the
limits of the baseball diamond
without paying for the privilege.
A sorority house or a fraternity
house that does not have at least
eight or ten copies of each paper
on the reading-table is not a place
where Freshmen can learn to be
thorough Stanford men and women
with a proper conception of the
Stanford spirit.
