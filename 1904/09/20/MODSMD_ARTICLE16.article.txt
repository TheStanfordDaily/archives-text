### 
In his annual review of track ath
letics Caspar Whitney, editor of
Outing, gives Norman E. Dole,
'04, credit for his record pole-vault.
Whitney is an authority on ama
teur athletics in this country, and
as he is one of the first Eastern crit
ics to accept Dole's record, his state
ment is of interest.
Whitney says:
"In point of quality as well as
quantity, this has been a remark-'
able track athletic season.
Of indivdual performances, the
most notable was that of Rose, of;
Michigan University, who put the
16-pound shot 48 feet 7 1-5 inches,
supplanting Horgan's worl'drecord
of 48 feet 2 inches. Of pole-vault
ing, there has been no end of high
class performances, but Norman
Dole, on the Pacific Coast, attained
to record figures with 12 feet 1 inch,
while W. Lanahan of Yale reached
11 feet 84 inches, though credited
with 12 feet in exhibition. Noth
ing extraordinary was done in the
sprints or jumps, but Williams of
Princeton did a half mile in 1:56
