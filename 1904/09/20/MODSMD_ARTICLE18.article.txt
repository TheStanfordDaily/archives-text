# FOOTBALL AT CALIFORNIA.
## Several Changes in the Line-up of the Varsity. â€” Light Practice. 
### 
Coach Hopper of the University
of California has made several
changes in the line-up of his foot
ball team during the past week.
Stern and Force, who alternated as
full-backs last year, have been
placed on the line, where they are
much needed. Force will play right
tackle, and Stern will play beside
him at guard. The most likely can
didate for the vacant full-back posi
tion is Sperry, '08, who was tried
out for that place by Hopper last
night. Elliott, who made a close
fight for the full-back position last
year, will try out for end this sea
son. It is unusual to take a Fresh
man on the Varsity this early in
the season, but it is predicted that
Sperry will gain the place without
much effort. These changes were
made early in the week because of
next Saturday's game with the
Olympic eleven,-and because Coach
Hopper considers the early forma
tion of the team imperative. It is
probable that the following team
will go against the clubmen Satur
day: Captain Straud,center; Gray,
left guard ; Howard, left tackle;
Henry, left end; Oliver, right end;
Force, right tackle; Stern, right
guard ; Kittrelle, quarter - back ;
Kern, left half; Snedigar, right
half; Sperry, full-back.
Coach Hopper is not at all
anxious to set his men to hard work
too early in the season. Scrim
mages have hardly begun, and the
players are only going through sig
nal formations and running down
on punts. By these conservative
conditioning processes there need be
no fear of injuring the players, who
are not yet in proper physical trim.
