# Tennis Courts to be Oiled.
## 
### 
The Roble and Encina tennis
courts will be oiled on Friday and
Saturday. This will make it im
possible to play on these courts for
about two or three weeks. How
ever, the improvement made by
oiling will be great, and as the
rainy season is approaching it is
necessary to get the courts into
condition to withstand the winter
storms.
As soon as the courts are in con
dition to be used arrangements will
be made for a preliminary tourna
ment.
