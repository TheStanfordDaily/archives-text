# FEW CHESS PLAYERS BACK.
## Only Two Members of Last Year's Varsity.â€”Plans for Tournament. 
### 
Only two of the men who played
a tie with the California chess team
last April have returned to college
this year, and unless some new
material is developed in the Fresh
man class or elsewhere the pros
pects for a victory next spring do
not seem very bright. While A.T.
Parsons, who captained last year's
team, and J. H. Page, who tied the
score in the intercollegiate match,
were expected to graduate in May,
the loss of A. B. Rhuart, '05, H,
W. Strong, '06, and F. E. Ulrich.
'06, was unexpected, and will
greatly cripple the team, as they
were conceded to be the three
strongest players in college.
The two men left from last year's
team are R. A. Fuller, '05, and M.j
M. Stearns, '06; and besides these
N. C. Powers, '03, and F. P. Whit
aker, '05, who played two years
ago, have returned, and should
have no difficulty in regaining
their old places. G. E. Dole, '07,
who acted as alternate last year,
should make a position on the team
this year. Other members of the
Chess Club who have returned and
will try for places are: J. F. Ga
boon, '06, E. \V. Ooane, '04, N. E.
Dole, '04, J. F. Cassell, '07. There
are also several good players who
are known to have entered from the
Palo Alto high school.
The first meeting of the Chess
Club will be held on Friday night,
September 30th, when two new
members will be elected to the ex
ecutive qommittee, and definite ar
rangements will be made for carry
ing on the fall tournament, and for
holding meetings during the term.
In all probability the tournament
will be run on the same plan as
that of last year, and those play
ers who win a sufficient number of
games by December, together with
the old Varsity men, will consti
tute next year's club, from which
the team-will be drawn.
In order to stimulate interest in
the game, and to aid in developing
better players for the team, ar
rangements have been made with
Dr. Lovegrove, the champion
chess player of the Coast, for a
series of exhibition games to be
given under the auspices of the
club. This step should be highly
beneficial, as Dr. Lovegrove is not
only the best player on the Coast,
but has defeated such players as
Lasker and Pillsbury.
A change has been made in the
design of the pin which is awarded
to members of the chess team. The
pin formerly consisted of a large
"S" surrounded by a circle. The
present design omits the circle, and
the "S", topped with a gold pawn,
is very much more effective.
