# NEW FIRE SYSTEM.
## Trained Corps of Students Will be in Constant Readiness for Alarms. 
### 
Arrangements have been com
pleted whereby the University is to
have the fire protection so badly
needed. During the summer a mod
ern well-equipped two-story fire
house was erected on Salvatierra
street. In this lias been placed a
serviceable hand hook-and-ladder,
carrying four twenty-five foot lad
ders, fire axes, etc., and a hose cart
bearing several hundred feet of four
inch hose.
Within, the new houße is arranged
after the style of the regulation city
fire station. The lower floor con
sists of one large room, where is
situated the fire apparatus, with
swinging doors leading to the street.
These doors are so arranged
as to be opened at a second's
notice.
The upper floor is arranged to
quarter six men and furnished
after the style of the Encina Hall
rooms. A modern bath-room is
another feature. In a side room
has been placed a large study
table, where the men may do their
evening work. To make a quick
descent possible, the upper and
lower floors are connected by two
steel .poles down which the men
may slide. The men, who will live
in the house and form the nucleus
of the volunteer tire department,
will be six in number. Five will
be University students and the
sixth will be a man in the employ
of the University.
It is the purpose of the Univer
sity Trustees to allow Dr. Jordan to
select five men each year from the
students who are working their
way through college and whom he
thinks are especially deserving of
help. Preferably large and physi
cally sound men will be chosen, in
order to increase the efficiency of
their firework. These men will be
required to spend their nights and
a part of each day at the fire sta
tion, ready to respond to all fire
calls. In return for this service the
University will allow them free
use of the living rooms and sup
ply them with free light and
water.
By this arrangement the Univer
sity will not only have a system of
fire protection that will free it from
all danger of serious conflagrations,
but there will bean opportunity for
deserving workers in college to ob
tain their lodging without any ser
ious loss of time to their University
work. In many of the larger East
ern universities such a practice is
in vogue, and it has long been the
desire of the community that some
such plan be established here.
The five students who will con
stitute the fire department were
examined by Dr. Snow, found to be
physically fitted for the position,
and are now established in their
new quarters.
