# FOOTBALL STATISTICS.
## Extensive Investigation into Football Injuries Made by Professor Dexter. 
### 
The official Football Guide for
this year gives the following sum
mary of an extensive investigation
into football injuries made by Pro
fessor Edwin G. Dexter, of the Uni
versity of Illinois.
1. About one college man in ten
the country over plays football.
2. About twice as large a propor
tion of the men in the small col
leges play the game as in the larger
universities.
3. The proportion of men playing
seems to be slightly decreasing.
4. About one player in thirty
five is injured sufficiently each sea
son to necessitate loss of time from
college duties.
5. The number of college football
players who are permanently in
jured, or who die from the effects of
the game, is so small as to be
practically a negligible quantity.
6. College football is adequately
supervised in nearly all the institu
tions.
7. The opinion of college officers
regarding the value of the game is
about 17 to 1 in favor.
8. The newspaper reports of in
juries to college football players
seem to be greatly exaggerated.
9. Accident insurance statistics
would lead us to believe that many
other forms of sport are more dang
erous than football.
These results are based on statis
tics furnished by the officers of sixty
of the more important colleges of
the country. The figures cover the
last ten years, and are comprehen
sive in their character.
During the ten years covered by
Professor Dexter's investigation,
out of 22,766 students playing the
game only 654 were injured to such
a degree as to cause them to lose
time from their classes. This would
be in the proportion of less than 3
to every 100 players.
Of the more serious injuries but
eight were of a permanent nature.
Three cases resulted fatally; two
of the three were untrained men.
