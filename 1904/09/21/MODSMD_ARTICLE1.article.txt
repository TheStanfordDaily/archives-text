# FRESHMEN VS. SANTA CLARA.
## Second Game Will Take Place on the Campus Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
The Becond Freshman football
game of the season will take place
on the campus tomorrow, when
the '08 team lines up against the ele
ven from Santa Clara college. All re
ports from Santa Clara indicate
that the college team this year is,
on the average, older and heavier
than the Stanford Freshmen, and
it is not expected that the '08 play
ers will be able to score. It is not
unlikely, however, that Santa
Clara will cross the Freshman
goal line more than once.
The length of the halves will be
longer than the periods of the Palo
Alto high school game last week.
This will be done in order to give
each candidate more chance to get
into the game. Practically every
man on the Freshman squad will
be given an opportunity to line-up
against the Santa Clara team.
The game will commence prompt
ly at 4 in order that the contest may
not interfere with Varsity practice.
The line-up of the Freshmen for the
first kick-off will be as follows:
Center, Coe; right guard, Gay; left
guard, Moody; right tackle, Bryan;
left tackle, Horton; right end, Wil
son; left end, Overman; quarter
back, Kearne ; right half, Cad
wallader; left half, Kocher; full
back, Peinberton.
The line-up of Santa Clara is as
follows: Center, Hubbard; right
guard, Blow; left guard, McElroy;
right tackle, Woodford; left tackle,
Donlan; right end, Ivancovich (c);
left end, Haack; right half,
Schmitz; left half, Sweeney; quar
ter-back, Magee; full-back, Murphy.
