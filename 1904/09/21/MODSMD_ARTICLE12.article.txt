In another column is printed an
interview with Captain Ahern of
the Bureau of Forestry of the Phil
ippine Islands. This interview
comes from one who has had long
experience in his line, and one who
may be relied upon to give an ac
curate account of the opportuni
ties offered. The opinion given
in the article will hear a careful
reading by all those who have any
inclination toward botanical or
forestry work.
Another matter brought out by
this interview particularly applies
to (Stanford. At the present time
there is no school of forestry on
this coast, and any institution that
adds one to its list of departments
will have taken a most valuable
step. The subject is one for which
there is an extensive field in Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington, as
well as in the Philippines. With
this adjacent territory to which
foresters can profitably devote any
amount of time, it would seem that
the establishment of a forestry de
partment at Stanford would be an
exceptionally popular and strength
ening addition to the University.
It is understood that there is now
being considered a movement to
change the department of system
atic botany into one of forestry. If
this change is made it will be gen
erally welcomed as an advantageous
move for the University and for the
whole Pacific Coast.
