The action of the Sophomore
class in selecting a specific style of
headgear to distinguish its mem
hers from other classes in college,
calls up the question whether or
not such practices are commend
able among the under-classmen.
In Eastern universities, where so
called class spirit is stronger than
it is at Stanford, such distinction
in garb is regarded with great favor,
and in some institutions is carried
to such an extent that the Fresh
men are required to wearsome uni
form article of apparel that will
mark them as first-year men. This

custom has lately been adopted at
California.
It is doubtful if conditions at
Stanford will ever warrant such a
regulation for Freshmen, but in
case of the Sophomore class the
practice is, at least, not objection
able. The one important purpose
it serves is to bring the men of the
class in close touch, something that
was not true among second-year
men before the practice was intro
duced. Not until students have
been at least a year in college do
they begin to feel a vital interest in
the affairs of their class. At this
time it is important that means
should be afforded them of becom
ing generally acquainted with their
classmates. The kind of emblem
they adopt is immaterial, as any
thing distinctive serves the end in
view, but a little discretion would
not be amiss when the selection is
made. One condition attaches to
the custom. So long as the hat or
other mark of distinction is a reas
onable exhibition in the eyes of the
college public, the practice is good.
If not, the custom misses its pur
pose and becomes an excuse for rid
icule.
The class of 1907 is to be com
mended for its selection of a hat
that is at once distinctive and bet
ter adapted to practical use than
any headgear that has been worn
by Sophomores of the past. It
would be well for future second
year men to consider this factor in
making their choice and to make
the emblem chosen to day a per
manent insignia for Sophomores.
