A communication has been re
ceived by President Jordan from
the Frederich Wilhelms University
at Berlin, granting concessions to
graduates of Stanford and certain
other American universities who
wish to pursue their studies toward
a doctor's degree in Germany. As
all of the German universities are
under the supervision of the gov
ernment and have the same re
quirements and standard, this will
apply to any of the universities in
that country. In the letter the
faculty of the Frederich-Wilhelms
University recognizes a bachelor's
degree given in any of the Ameri
can universities below named as
equivalent to a degree from the
German gymnasium.
Alter the prescribed three yeara
the faculty at the recommendation
of the United States minister will
take into account the years passed
in winning an A. B. in one of the
universities which belong to the
Association of American Univer
sities. Before this will be done,
however, the student must have
studied at least three semesters in
a German university.
The following institutions are
named as the Association of Ameri
can Universities: Harvard Univer
sity, Clark University, Yale Uni
versity, Columbia University, Cor
nell University, Princeton Univer
sity, University of Pennsylvania,
Johns Hopkins University, Catho
lic University of America, Uni
