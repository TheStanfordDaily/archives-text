# Plan for Rooting Sections.
## 
### 
Yell leader Bulkley of the Uni
versity of California has proposed
to have the rival rooting sections
opposite each other at the big game.
If this plan is carried through it
will bring about an additional ex
pense of about $200, as the present
contract calls for a roofing on only
one side of the field. A part of
each side would be covered under
this this new plan. As the scheme
will benefit both sides Stanford's
assistance will he asked in the mat
ter. It is believed students would
be willing to pay a little more for
tickets if the seats were nearer the
center of the field and in this way
help pay the additional expense.
