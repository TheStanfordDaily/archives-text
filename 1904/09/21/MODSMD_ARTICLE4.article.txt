The San Francisco branch of the
American Mathematical Society
will hold its annual meeting at the
University of California on Satur
day, October Ist. The*meeting will
be opened by Prof. Irving String
ham of the University of California,
and it is expected that a large num
ber of mathematicians from Cali
fornia and Stanford, and from the
high schools of this part of the
State, will attend.
The following members of the
Stanford faculty will read papers
before the meeting: Professor L. M.
Hoskins on the "Stresses in an
Elastic Sphere Due to a Superficial
Layer of Heavy Matter of Uniform
Thickness"; Associate Professor G.
A. Miller, on "The Determination
of all the Groups of Order 2'" which
Contain an Odd Number of Cylic
Sub-groups"; Assistant Professor H.
F. Blichfeldt, on "The Primitive
Continuous Groups". Assistant Pro
fessors E. J. Wilzynski, D. N. Leh
mer, and Instructor T. M. Putnam
of the University of California will
also read papers.
The program also provides for a
conference on recent investigations
in the foundations of geometry, in
which other members of the Stan
ford faculty will take part. There
will be two sessions beginning at
11 and 2 respectively. The mem
bers of the Stanford Mathematics
department will be entertained by
the California mathematics depart
ment, and there will probably be
an informal conference during the
evening.
