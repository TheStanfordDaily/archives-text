# Sophomores Select Hat.
## 
### 
The Sophomore class met this
afternoon for the purpose of re
ceiving the report of the committee
appointed last week to consider the
matter of a class emblem. Chair
man L. M. Edwards of this com
mittee first presented a red blazer
jacket similar to that worn at
Princeton. Then a red cap was
suggested and later two hats, one
of which was of gray cloth and the
other of red felt, with a wide gray
band.
It was first decided to vote on
the question whether a hat or a
coat should be selected. The class
voted to choose some kind of a hat.
After a lengthy and spirited dis
cussion in regard to material, cost,
and appearance, it was decided to
adopt a red felt hat with a gray
band. The same committee, which
was appointed to consider various
kinds of emblems, will find out the
price of these hats and where they
may he obtained.
