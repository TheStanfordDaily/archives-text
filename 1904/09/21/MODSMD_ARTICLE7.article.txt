# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Heavy Work Begun.—Manager Barrett Engages California Theatre for November 12th. 
### 
For the first time this week both
Varsity and Freshman squads went
through heavy scrimmage work
last night. Four Varsity teams
were lined up during the practice
period, and one team of each squad
succeeded in crossing its opponent's
goal line. Last year's Varsity men
were so evenly distributed in the
line-up of the opposing teams that
no distinction as to Varsity and
second elevens could be made.
The defensive work of the teams
wau ragged, but the players showed
more aggressiveness and spirit than
usual. Now that the teams are
pitted against each other, the con
test for places is becoming keen,
and practice is interesting and
spirited.
Several changes have occurred in
the positions of the candidates, and
probably the most interesting of
these is the shifting of Thompson,
'05, from guard to tackle position.
This change leaves the center trio
of positions to be gained by untried
men, and a number of heavy play
ers are out for the vacant places.
Another radical change is the shift
ing of two end candidates —Stan-
ford, '06, and Trowbridge, '05 —to
the back field. W. H. Dole, '05,
and W. K. Roosevelt, '05, are still
ill, and will not be able to appear
on the gridiron for several weeks,
if at all.
Two Freshman teams lined up
for heavy scrimmage work last
night, and their playing showed
that some little improvement has
been made since their last line
up.
Treasurer Barrett after negotiat
ing with the managers of several
San Francisco theaters for some
time, has succeeded in leasing the
California Theatre on Bush street
for the night of the intercollegiate
football game. Barrett will reserve
several blocks of seats for the Uni
versity public, and will dispose of
the remainder of the seats to the
general public. The play to be
presented that night is "Sweet
Clover," a comedv-drama, which
will be played on the Pacific Coast
for the first time this winter. Otis
B. Thayer and Gertrude Bond hill,
who are comparatively unknown to
Western theatre-goers, have the
leading parts in the cast.
