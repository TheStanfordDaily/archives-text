# PHILIPPINE FORESTRY.
## Commissioner Ahern Speaks of Openings in the Islands for University Graduates. 
### 
Captain George P. Ahem, form
erly of the ninth United States in
fantry, who has been in charge of
the Bureau of Forestry in the
Philippine Islands, since its estab
lishment four years ago, was on
the campus yesterday, and in an
interview with Prof. W. 11. Dudley
of the Botany department stated
that there were large opportunities
in his field of work in the islands
for men with University training.
The Bureau of Forestry in the
Philippines is largely under the
control of the Philippine Commis
sion, by which it was established,
but it is also under the supervision
of the United States Bureau of For
estry at Washington. It controls
over 40,000,000 acres of forested
lands, formerly crown lands of
Spain, which became forest reserves
of the United States, upon the
American occupation of the island.
As most of the forested lands in the
United States come under the con
trol of the land office, this amount
almost equals that which is con
trolled bv the home bureau itself.
Last year the amount of money
taken out in grants of milling con
cessions and handed over to the
Commission by Captain A hern as
revenue reached $500,000, showing
an increase of $350,000 in the past
three years. This demonstrates the
rapidity with which the islands are
filling up, and the vast opportuni
ties which are offered for the devel
opment of wealth in the line of for
estry alone.
The most important point which
Captain Ahern mentioned was his
desire that the universities of the
Pacific Coast should work hand in
hand with the bureau in the devel
opment of the forestry and agricul
tural interests of the islands. He
offers not only to supply the Uni
versity with specimens from the
vast number of flora and fauna,
that have been gathered at the
station, for the purposes of their be
ing studied in America, but states
that foresters who desire to study
in the islands may avail them
selves of the facilities that may be
had at the station.
Since the commencement of the
work Ahern says that there has
been a great demand for capable
foresters, a'nd states that upon his
endeavoring to secure ten men,
only two could be found with the
requisite university training. Asa
diploma from some school of for
estry is required before a position
in the Bureau can be had, it' is
highly desirable that some school
should be established on the Coast.
In view of the fact that the
Bureau will constantly be in need
