The Optic Nerve
The picture above shows the posterior
position of the human eye and the en
trance of the optic nerve.
When the optic nerve becomes dis
eased, glasses will not relieve or cure.
These cases, however, are quite rare.
Nearly all eye troubles arise from visual
defects which are relieved only by
glasses.
Diseases and accidents require opera
tions or treatment. These we do not
give.
The correct fitting of glasses is our
exclusive business.
