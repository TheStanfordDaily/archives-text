# ATHLETIC GROUND PLANS
## Preliminary Survey of Land in Arboretum Will Begin in Ten Days. 
### 
Within the next ten days a pre
liminary survey of the new athletic
grounds will lie begun under the su
pervision of Dr. Frank Angell. The
exact dimensions of the plot will
be found, and the location of all
the trees taken, preparatory to the
beginning of active work 011 the
new field.
It is generally known that the
extensive field beyond the faculty
clubhouse is the land assigned for
the new athletic grounds which
have been planned for some time.
A survey was made last spring by
the Southern Pacific Company and
a route for a side-track to the
grounds laid out. This switch will
connect with the side-track run
ning from Mayfield to the campus
at the old running track.
The field includes a forty-acre
tract, and will give ample room for
the extensive improvements that
are planned. The number of trees
on the land is the one objection to
the use of the tract as an athletic
field. It is desired to preserve as
many of the trees as is possible, es
pecially the live oaks. With the
removal of the eucalyptus trees, it
is expected that the grounds can
be laid out without necessitating
the cutting down of the more beau
tiful trees.
The new field will then be locat
ed at a considerable distance from
any of the University buildings.
It was considered best not to have
the grounds any nearer the new
gymnasium, because they would
then be too close to the Library
now being started.
Although the plans for the new
field have not yet taken a definite
shape, it is intended to build at
least two football fields, an excel
lent track, and three or four base
ball diamonds. The whole grounds
will be completed and ready for
use next fall. Undoubtedly they
will be equal in extensiveness and
convenience to .any in the world.
The work is being carried on under
the direction of the Training-house
Corporation.
