# Orchestra Begins Practice.
## 
### 
The first regular practice of the
University orchestra was held last
night in the chapel. Most of the
old men returned to fill their
places, and an exceptionally large
number of new men were on hand.
The orchestra will he larger this
year than ever before. As yet no
personnel of the organization can
be given, the try-out for places not
yet being ended. More men are
still wanted, however, to play cellos,
oboes, French horns, bassoons, bass
viols, and a trombone. The orches
tra will meet regularly every Wed
nesday evening in the chapel.
