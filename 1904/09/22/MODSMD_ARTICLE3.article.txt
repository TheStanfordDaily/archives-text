# DR. JORDAN'S ADDRESS AT ST. LOUIS.
## Speech Before International Congress of Arts and Sciences.— One of His Best in Recent Years. 
### 
The address of I)r. Jordan 011
" Utilitarian Science," delivered
Monday before the International
Congress of Arts and Sciences at
the St. Louis Exposition, was one
of the most notable efforts of the
President in recent years. The ad
dress is of interest not alone to
scientists and students, but also as
general reading for college men and
women, and the Daily Palo Alto
publishes to-night as liberal ex
tracts as its space will permit. The
address was, in part, as follows:
"In point of development, pure
science must precede utilitarian
science. Historically this seems to
be not true; for the beginnings of
science in general, as alchemy,
astrology, and therapeutics, seem to
have their origin in the desire for
the practical results of knowledge.
Men wanted to acquire gold, to save
life, to forecast the future, not for
knowledge's sake, but for the i im
mediate results of success in these
directions. But even here accurate
knowledge must precede any suc
cess in its application, and accuracy
of knowledge is all that we mean
by pure science. Moreover, as
through the ages the representatives
of the philosophies of the day, the
a priori explanations of the uni
verse, were bitterly and personally
hostile to all inductive conclusions
based on the study of base matter,
men of science were forced to dis
guise their work under a utilitarian
cloak. This is more or less true
even to this day, and the greatest
need of utilitarian science is still,
as two thousand years ago, that
this cloak should be thrown off,
and that a larger and stronger body
of workers in pure science should
be developed to give the advance in
real knowledge on which the thou
sands of ingenious and noble appli
cations to utilitarian ends must
constantly depend.
"It is a fundamental law of psy
chology that thought tends to pass
over into action. Applied science
is knowledge in action. It is the
flower of that highest philanthropy
of the ages by which not even
thought exists for itseif alone, but
must find its end in the enlarge
ment of human control over matter
and force, or the amelioration of
the conditions of human life.
"The development of all science
has been a constant struggle;a strug
gle of fact against philosophy; of
instant impressions against tradi
tional interpretations. For men
are prone to trust a theory rather
than a fact: a fact is a single point
of contact; a theory is a circle
made of a n infinite number of points,
none of them, however, it may be,
real points of contact.
"The history of the progress of
science is written in human
psychology rather than in hu
man records. It is the struggle
of the few realities or present sense
impressions against the multitude
of past impressions, suggestions and
explanations. I have elsewhere said
that the one great discovery of the

Nineteenth century — forestalled
many ages before —was that of the
reality of external things. Men
have learned to trust a present fact
or group of facts, however contra
dictory its teachings, as opposed to
tradition and philosophy. From
this trust in the reality,of the envir
onment of matter and force, what
ever these may be, the great fabric
of modern science has been built up.
"Science is human experience of
contact with environment tested,set
in order, and expressed in terms of
other human experience. Utilita
rian science is that part of all this
knowledge which we use in our
lives, in our business. What is
pure science to one, is applied sci
ence to another. The investigation
of the laws of heredity may be
strictly academic to us of theU Diver
sity, but they are utilitarian as re
lated to the preservation of the na
tion or the breeding of pigs. In
the warfare of science, the real in
act and motive has been persist
ently substituted for the unreal.
Men have slowly learned that the
true glory of life lies in its wise
conduct; in the daily acts of love
and helpfulness; not in the vaga
ries fostered by the priest nor in
the spasms of madness which are
the pride of war. To live here and
now as a man should live consti
tutes the Ethics of Science; and this
ideal has been in constant antithe
sis to the Ethics of Ecclesiasticism,
of asceticism, and of militarism.
"The physical history of the
progress of science has been a
struggle of thinkers, observers, and
experimenters, against the domi
nant forces of society. It has been
a continuous battle, in which the
weaker side in the long run is win
ner, having the strength of the
Universe behind it. It has been
incidentally a conflict of earthborn
knowledge with opinions or men
sanctioned by religion of present
facts, with pre-established system,
visibly a warfare between inductive
thought and dogmatic theology.
"The real struggle, as already
indicated, lies deeper than this. It
is the effort of the human mind to
relate itself to realities, in the
midst of the traditions and super
stitions; to realize that Nature
never contradicts herself; is al
ways complex, but never myster
ious. As a final result all past
systems of philosophy —perhaps
all possible systems —have been
thrown back to the realm of litera
ture, no longer controlling the life
of action which rests on action.
"This conflict of tendencies in
the individual has become a con
flict among individuals, as each is
governed by a dominant impulse.
The cause of tradition becomes that
of theology —for men have always
claimed a religious sanction for
their own individual bit of cosmic
philosophy. Just as each man in
his secret heart, the center of his
own universe, feels himself in some
degree the subject of the favor of
