# DR. JORDAN'S ADDRESS AT ST. LOUIS.
## Speech Before International Congress of Arts and Sciences.— One of His Best in Recent Years. 
### 
The address of I)r. Jordan 011
" Utilitarian Science," delivered
Monday before the International
Congress of Arts and Sciences at
the St. Louis Exposition, was one
of the most notable efforts of the
President in recent years. The ad
dress is of interest not alone to
scientists and students, but also as
general reading for college men and
women, and the Daily Palo Alto
publishes to-night as liberal ex
tracts as its space will permit. The
address was, in part, as follows:
"In point of development, pure
science must precede utilitarian
science. Historically this seems to
be not true; for the beginnings of
science in general, as alchemy,
astrology, and therapeutics, seem to
have their origin in the desire for
the practical results of knowledge.
Men wanted to acquire gold, to save
life, to forecast the future, not for
knowledge's sake, but for the i im
mediate results of success in these
directions. But even here accurate
knowledge must precede any suc
cess in its application, and accuracy
of knowledge is all that we mean
by pure science. Moreover, as
through the ages the representatives
of the philosophies of the day, the
a priori explanations of the uni
verse, were bitterly and personally
hostile to all inductive conclusions
based on the study of base matter,
men of science were forced to dis
guise their work under a utilitarian
cloak. This is more or less true
even to this day, and the greatest
need of utilitarian science is still,
as two thousand years ago, that
this cloak should be thrown off,
and that a larger and stronger body
of workers in pure science should
be developed to give the advance in
real knowledge on which the thou
sands of ingenious and noble appli
cations to utilitarian ends must
constantly depend.
"It is a fundamental law of psy
chology that thought tends to pass
over into action. Applied science
is knowledge in action. It is the
flower of that highest philanthropy
of the ages by which not even
thought exists for itseif alone, but
must find its end in the enlarge
ment of human control over matter
and force, or the amelioration of
the conditions of human life.
"The development of all science
has been a constant struggle;a strug
gle of fact against philosophy; of
instant impressions against tradi
tional interpretations. For men
are prone to trust a theory rather
than a fact: a fact is a single point
of contact; a theory is a circle
made of a n infinite number of points,
none of them, however, it may be,
real points of contact.
"The history of the progress of
science is written in human
psychology rather than in hu
man records. It is the struggle
of the few realities or present sense
impressions against the multitude
of past impressions, suggestions and
explanations. I have elsewhere said
that the one great discovery of the

Nineteenth century — forestalled
many ages before —was that of the
reality of external things. Men
have learned to trust a present fact
or group of facts, however contra
dictory its teachings, as opposed to
tradition and philosophy. From
this trust in the reality,of the envir
onment of matter and force, what
ever these may be, the great fabric
of modern science has been built up.
"Science is human experience of
contact with environment tested,set
in order, and expressed in terms of
other human experience. Utilita
rian science is that part of all this
knowledge which we use in our
lives, in our business. What is
pure science to one, is applied sci
ence to another. The investigation
of the laws of heredity may be
strictly academic to us of theU Diver
sity, but they are utilitarian as re
lated to the preservation of the na
tion or the breeding of pigs. In
the warfare of science, the real in
act and motive has been persist
ently substituted for the unreal.
Men have slowly learned that the
true glory of life lies in its wise
conduct; in the daily acts of love
and helpfulness; not in the vaga
ries fostered by the priest nor in
the spasms of madness which are
the pride of war. To live here and
now as a man should live consti
tutes the Ethics of Science; and this
ideal has been in constant antithe
sis to the Ethics of Ecclesiasticism,
of asceticism, and of militarism.
"The physical history of the
progress of science has been a
struggle of thinkers, observers, and
experimenters, against the domi
nant forces of society. It has been
a continuous battle, in which the
weaker side in the long run is win
ner, having the strength of the
Universe behind it. It has been
incidentally a conflict of earthborn
knowledge with opinions or men
sanctioned by religion of present
facts, with pre-established system,
visibly a warfare between inductive
thought and dogmatic theology.
"The real struggle, as already
indicated, lies deeper than this. It
is the effort of the human mind to
relate itself to realities, in the
midst of the traditions and super
stitions; to realize that Nature
never contradicts herself; is al
ways complex, but never myster
ious. As a final result all past
systems of philosophy —perhaps
all possible systems —have been
thrown back to the realm of litera
ture, no longer controlling the life
of action which rests on action.
"This conflict of tendencies in
the individual has become a con
flict among individuals, as each is
governed by a dominant impulse.
The cause of tradition becomes that
of theology —for men have always
claimed a religious sanction for
their own individual bit of cosmic
philosophy. Just as each man in
his secret heart, the center of his
own universe, feels himself in some
degree the subject of the favor of
the mysterious unseen powers, so
does society in all ages find a mys
tic or divine warrant for its own
attitude toward life and action,
whatever that may be.
"It is against limited and pre
conceived notions that the warfare
of science has been directed. It is
the struggle for realities on the
part of the individual man. Ig
norance, prejudice, and intolerance
in the long run are one and the
same thing. In some one line at
least, each lofty mind throughout
the ages has demanded objec
tive reality. This struggle has
been one between science and
theology, only because theo
logical misconceptions were en
tangled with crude notions of
other sorts. In the experience of
a single human life there is little
to correct, even the crudest of theo
logical conceptions. From the
supposed greater importance of re
ligious opinions in determining the
fate of men and nations, theologi
cal ideas have dominated all others
throughout the ages; and in the
nature of things, the great religious
bodies have formed the stronghold
of conservatism against which the
separated band of science have
hurled themselves, seemingly, in
vain.
" But the real essence of conserva
tism lies not in theology. The
whole conflict is a struggle in the
mind of man. From some phase
of the warfare of science no indiv
idual is exempt. It exists in
human psychology before it is
wrought in human history. There
is no better antidote to bigotry
than the study of the growth of
knowledge. There is no chapter in
history more encouraging than that
which treats of the growth of open
mindedness. The study of this his
tory leads religious men to avoid
intolerance in the present, through
a knowledge of the evils intolerance
has wrought in the past. Men of
science are spurred to more earnest
work by the record, that through
the ages objective truth has been
the final test of all theories and
conceptions. All men will work
more sanely and more effectively as
they realize that no good to religion
or science comes from 'wishing to
please God with a lie.'
"It is the mission of science to
disclose—so far as itggoethes —the real
nature of the universe. Its func
tion is to eliminate, wherever it be
found, the human equation. By
methods of precision of thought,
and instruments of precision of ob
servation and experiment, science
seeks to make our knowledge of the
small, the distant, the invisible,
and the mysterious, as accurate, as
practical as our knowledge of com
mon things. Moreover, it seeks to
make our knowledge of common
things accurate and precise, that
this accuracy and precision may be
translated into action. For the
ultimate end of science, as well as
its initial impulse, is the regulation
of human conduct. Seeing true
means thinking right, llight think
ing means right action. Greater
precision in action makes higher
civilization possible. Lack of pre
cision in action is the great cause
of human misery; for misery is the
inevitable result of wrong conduct.
'Still, men and nations reap as they
have strewn.' These words of Hux
ley represent a classic thought in
the history of applied science.
'There can be no alleviation of the

sufferings of man except in absolute
veracity of thought and action, and
a resolute facing of the world as it
is.' 'The world as it is,' is the
province of science. 'The God of
the things as they are is the God of
the highest heaven,' and so to the
sane man, the world as it is is
glorious, beautiful, harmonious, and
divine, so will science, our tested
and ordered knowledge of it, be the
inspiration of art, poetry, and re
ligion."

true glory of life lies in its wise
conduct; in the daily acts of love
and helpfulness; not in the vaga
ries fostered by the priest nor in
the spasms of madness which are
the pride of war. To live here and
now as a man should live consti
tutes the Ethics of Science; and this
ideal has been in constant antithe
sis to the Ethics of Ecclesiasticism,
of asceticism, and of militarism.
"The physical history of the
progress of science has been a
struggle of thinkers, observers, and
experimenters, against the domi
nant forces of society. It has been
a continuous battle, in which the
weaker side in the long run is win
ner, having the strength of the
Universe behind it. It has been
incidentally a conflict of earthborn
knowledge with opinions or men
sanctioned by religion of present
facts, with pre-established system,
visibly a warfare between inductive
thought and dogmatic theology.
"The real struggle, as already
indicated, lies deeper than this. It
is the effort of the human mind to
relate itself to realities, in the
midst of the traditions and super
stitions; to realize that Nature
never contradicts herself; is al
ways complex, but never myster
ious. As a final result all past
systems of philosophy —perhaps
all possible systems —have been
thrown back to the realm of litera
ture, no longer controlling the life
of action which rests on action.
"This conflict of tendencies in
the individual has become a con
flict among individuals, as each is
governed by a dominant impulse.
The cause of tradition becomes that
of theology —for men have always
claimed a religious sanction for
their own individual bit of cosmic
philosophy. Just as each man in
his secret heart, the center of his
own universe, feels himself in some
degree the subject of the favor of
the mysterious unseen powers, so
does society in all ages find a mys
tic or divine warrant for its own
attitude toward life and action,
whatever that may be.
"It is against limited and pre
conceived notions that the warfare
of science has been directed. It is
the struggle for realities on the
part of the individual man. Ig
norance, prejudice, and intolerance
in the long run are one and the
same thing. In some one line at
least, each lofty mind throughout
the ages has demanded objec
tive reality. This struggle has
been one between science and
theology, only because theo
logical misconceptions were en
tangled with crude notions of
other sorts. In the experience of
a single human life there is little
to correct, even the crudest of theo
logical conceptions. From the
supposed greater importance of re
ligious opinions in determining the
fate of men and nations, theologi
cal ideas have dominated all others
throughout the ages; and in the
nature of things, the great religious
bodies have formed the stronghold
of conservatism against which the
separated band of science have
hurled themselves, seemingly, in
vain.
" But the real essence of conserva
tism lies not in theology. The
whole conflict is a struggle in the
mind of man. From some phase
of the warfare of science no indiv
idual is exempt. It exists in
human psychology before it is
wrought in human history. There
is no better antidote to bigotry
than the study of the growth of
knowledge. There is no chapter in
history more encouraging than that
which treats of the growth of open
mindedness. The study of this his
tory leads religious men to avoid
intolerance in the present, through
a knowledge of the evils intolerance
has wrought in the past. Men of
science are spurred to more earnest
work by the record, that through
the ages objective truth has been
the final test of all theories and
conceptions. All men will work
more sanely and more effectively as
they realize that no good to religion
or science comes from 'wishing to
please God with a lie.'
"It is the mission of science to
disclose—so far as itggoethes —the real
nature of the universe. Its func
tion is to eliminate, wherever it be
found, the human equation. By
methods of precision of thought,
and instruments of precision of ob
servation and experiment, science
seeks to make our knowledge of the
small, the distant, the invisible,
and the mysterious, as accurate, as
practical as our knowledge of com
mon things. Moreover, it seeks to
make our knowledge of common
things accurate and precise, that
this accuracy and precision may be
translated into action. For the
ultimate end of science, as well as
its initial impulse, is the regulation
of human conduct. Seeing true
means thinking right, llight think
ing means right action. Greater
precision in action makes higher
civilization possible. Lack of pre
cision in action is the great cause
of human misery; for misery is the
inevitable result of wrong conduct.
'Still, men and nations reap as they
have strewn.' These words of Hux
ley represent a classic thought in
the history of applied science.
'There can be no alleviation of the

sufferings of man except in absolute
veracity of thought and action, and
a resolute facing of the world as it
is.' 'The world as it is,' is the
province of science. 'The God of
the things as they are is the God of
the highest heaven,' and so to the
sane man, the world as it is is
glorious, beautiful, harmonious, and
divine, so will science, our tested
and ordered knowledge of it, be the
inspiration of art, poetry, and re
ligion."
The address of I)r. Jordan 011
" Utilitarian Science," delivered
Monday before the International
Congress of Arts and Sciences at
the St. Louis Exposition, was one
of the most notable efforts of the
President in recent years. The ad
dress is of interest not alone to
scientists and students, but also as
general reading for college men and
women, and the Daily Palo Alto
publishes to-night as liberal ex
tracts as its space will permit. The
address was, in part, as follows:
"In point of development, pure
science must precede utilitarian
science. Historically this seems to
be not true; for the beginnings of
science in general, as alchemy,
astrology, and therapeutics, seem to
have their origin in the desire for
the practical results of knowledge.
Men wanted to acquire gold, to save
life, to forecast the future, not for
knowledge's sake, but for the i im
mediate results of success in these
directions. But even here accurate
knowledge must precede any suc
cess in its application, and accuracy
of knowledge is all that we mean
by pure science. Moreover, as
through the ages the representatives
of the philosophies of the day, the
a priori explanations of the uni
verse, were bitterly and personally
hostile to all inductive conclusions
based on the study of base matter,
men of science were forced to dis
guise their work under a utilitarian
cloak. This is more or less true
even to this day, and the greatest
need of utilitarian science is still,
as two thousand years ago, that
this cloak should be thrown off,
and that a larger and stronger body
of workers in pure science should
be developed to give the advance in
real knowledge on which the thou
sands of ingenious and noble appli
cations to utilitarian ends must
constantly depend.
"It is a fundamental law of psy
chology that thought tends to pass
over into action. Applied science
is knowledge in action. It is the
flower of that highest philanthropy
of the ages by which not even
thought exists for itseif alone, but
must find its end in the enlarge
ment of human control over matter
and force, or the amelioration of
the conditions of human life.
"The development of all science
has been a constant struggle;a strug
gle of fact against philosophy; of
instant impressions against tradi
tional interpretations. For men
are prone to trust a theory rather
than a fact: a fact is a single point
of contact; a theory is a circle
made of a n infinite number of points,
none of them, however, it may be,
real points of contact.
"The history of the progress of
science is written in human
psychology rather than in hu
man records. It is the struggle
of the few realities or present sense
impressions against the multitude
of past impressions, suggestions and
explanations. I have elsewhere said
that the one great discovery of the

Nineteenth century — forestalled
many ages before —was that of the
reality of external things. Men
have learned to trust a present fact
or group of facts, however contra
dictory its teachings, as opposed to
tradition and philosophy. From
this trust in the reality,of the envir
onment of matter and force, what
ever these may be, the great fabric
of modern science has been built up.
"Science is human experience of
contact with environment tested,set
in order, and expressed in terms of
other human experience. Utilita
rian science is that part of all this
knowledge which we use in our
lives, in our business. What is
pure science to one, is applied sci
ence to another. The investigation
of the laws of heredity may be
strictly academic to us of theU Diver
sity, but they are utilitarian as re
lated to the preservation of the na
tion or the breeding of pigs. In
the warfare of science, the real in
act and motive has been persist
ently substituted for the unreal.
Men have slowly learned that the
true glory of life lies in its wise
conduct; in the daily acts of love
and helpfulness; not in the vaga

nature of the universe. Its func

found, the human equation. By
methods of precision of thought,
and instruments of precision of ob
servation and experiment, science
seeks to make our knowledge of the
small, the distant, the invisible,
and the mysterious, as accurate, as
practical as our knowledge of com
mon things. Moreover, it seeks to
make our knowledge of common
things accurate and precise, that
this accuracy and precision may be
translated into action. For the
ultimate end of science, as well as
its initial impulse, is the regulation
of human conduct. Seeing true
means thinking right, llight think

precision in action makes higher
civilization possible. Lack of pre

of human misery; for misery is the
inevitable result of wrong conduct.
'Still, men and nations reap as they

'There can be no alleviation of the

sufferings of man except in absolute
veracity of thought and action, and
a resolute facing of the world as it
is.' 'The world as it is,' is the
province of science. 'The God of
the things as they are is the God of
the highest heaven,' and so to the
sane man, the world as it is is
glorious, beautiful, harmonious, and
divine, so will science, our tested
and ordered knowledge of it, be the
inspiration of art, poetry, and re

The address of I)r. Jordan 011
" Utilitarian Science," delivered
Monday before the International
Congress of Arts and Sciences at
the St. Louis Exposition, was one
of the most notable efforts of the
President in recent years. The ad
dress is of interest not alone to
scientists and students, but also as
general reading for college men and
women, and the Daily Palo Alto
publishes to-night as liberal ex
tracts as its space will permit. The
address was, in part, as follows:
"In point of development, pure
science must precede utilitarian
science. Historically this seems to
be not true; for the beginnings of
science in general, as alchemy,
astrology, and therapeutics, seem to
have their origin in the desire for
the practical results of knowledge.
Men wanted to acquire gold, to save
life, to forecast the future, not for
knowledge's sake, but for the i im
mediate results of success in these
directions. But even here accurate
knowledge must precede any suc
cess in its application, and accuracy
of knowledge is all that we mean
by pure science. Moreover, as
through the ages the representatives
of the philosophies of the day, the
a priori explanations of the uni
verse, were bitterly and personally
hostile to all inductive conclusions
based on the study of base matter,
men of science were forced to dis
guise their work under a utilitarian
cloak. This is more or less true
even to this day, and the greatest
need of utilitarian science is still,
as two thousand years ago, that
this cloak should be thrown off,
and that a larger and stronger body
of workers in pure science should
be developed to give the advance in
real knowledge on which the thou
sands of ingenious and noble appli
cations to utilitarian ends must
constantly depend.
"It is a fundamental law of psy
chology that thought tends to pass
over into action. Applied science
is knowledge in action. It is the
flower of that highest philanthropy
of the ages by which not even
thought exists for itseif alone, but
must find its end in the enlarge
ment of human control over matter
and force, or the amelioration of
the conditions of human life.
"The development of all science
has been a constant struggle;a strug
gle of fact against philosophy; of
instant impressions against tradi
tional interpretations. For men
are prone to trust a theory rather
than a fact: a fact is a single point
of contact; a theory is a circle
made of a n infinite number of points,
none of them, however, it may be,
real points of contact.
"The history of the progress of
science is written in human
psychology rather than in hu
man records. It is the struggle
of the few realities or present sense
impressions against the multitude
of past impressions, suggestions and
explanations. I have elsewhere said
that the one great discovery of the

Nineteenth century — forestalled
many ages before —was that of the
reality of external things. Men
have learned to trust a present fact
or group of facts, however contra
dictory its teachings, as opposed to
tradition and philosophy. From
this trust in the reality,of the envir
onment of matter and force, what
ever these may be, the great fabric
of modern science has been built up.
"Science is human experience of
contact with environment tested,set
in order, and expressed in terms of
other human experience. Utilita
rian science is that part of all this
knowledge which we use in our
lives, in our business. What is
pure science to one, is applied sci
ence to another. The investigation
of the laws of heredity may be
strictly academic to us of theU Diver
sity, but they are utilitarian as re
lated to the preservation of the na
tion or the breeding of pigs. In
the warfare of science, the real in
act and motive has been persist
ently substituted for the unreal.
Men have slowly learned that the
true glory of life lies in its wise
conduct; in the daily acts of love
and helpfulness; not in the vaga
ries fostered by the priest nor in
the spasms of madness which are
the pride of war. To live here and
now as a man should live consti
tutes the Ethics of Science; and this
ideal has been in constant antithe
sis to the Ethics of Ecclesiasticism,
of asceticism, and of militarism.
"The physical history of the
progress of science has been a
struggle of thinkers, observers, and
experimenters, against the domi
nant forces of society. It has been
a continuous battle, in which the
weaker side in the long run is win
ner, having the strength of the
Universe behind it. It has been
incidentally a conflict of earthborn
knowledge with opinions or men
sanctioned by religion of present
facts, with pre-established system,
visibly a warfare between inductive
thought and dogmatic theology.
"The real struggle, as already
indicated, lies deeper than this. It
is the effort of the human mind to
relate itself to realities, in the
midst of the traditions and super
stitions; to realize that Nature
never contradicts herself; is al
ways complex, but never myster
ious. As a final result all past
systems of philosophy —perhaps
all possible systems —have been
thrown back to the realm of litera
ture, no longer controlling the life
of action which rests on action.
"This conflict of tendencies in
the individual has become a con
flict among individuals, as each is
governed by a dominant impulse.
The cause of tradition becomes that
of theology —for men have always
claimed a religious sanction for
their own individual bit of cosmic
philosophy. Just as each man in
his secret heart, the center of his
own universe, feels himself in some
degree the subject of the favor of
the mysterious unseen powers, so
does society in all ages find a mys
tic or divine warrant for its own
attitude toward life and action,
whatever that may be.
"It is against limited and pre
conceived notions that the warfare
of science has been directed. It is
the struggle for realities on the
part of the individual man. Ig
norance, prejudice, and intolerance
in the long run are one and the
same thing. In some one line at
least, each lofty mind throughout
the ages has demanded objec
tive reality. This struggle has
been one between science and
theology, only because theo
logical misconceptions were en
tangled with crude notions of
other sorts. In the experience of
a single human life there is little
to correct, even the crudest of theo
logical conceptions. From the
supposed greater importance of re
ligious opinions in determining the
fate of men and nations, theologi
cal ideas have dominated all others
throughout the ages; and in the
nature of things, the great religious
bodies have formed the stronghold
of conservatism against which the
separated band of science have
hurled themselves, seemingly, in
vain.
" But the real essence of conserva
tism lies not in theology. The
whole conflict is a struggle in the
mind of man. From some phase
of the warfare of science no indiv
idual is exempt. It exists in
human psychology before it is
wrought in human history. There
is no better antidote to bigotry
than the study of the growth of
knowledge. There is no chapter in
history more encouraging than that
which treats of the growth of open
mindedness. The study of this his
tory leads religious men to avoid
intolerance in the present, through
a knowledge of the evils intolerance
has wrought in the past. Men of
science are spurred to more earnest
work by the record, that through
the ages objective truth has been
the final test of all theories and
conceptions. All men will work
more sanely and more effectively as
they realize that no good to religion
or science comes from 'wishing to
please God with a lie.'
"It is the mission of science to
disclose—so far as itggoethes —the real
nature of the universe. Its func
tion is to eliminate, wherever it be
found, the human equation. By
methods of precision of thought,
and instruments of precision of ob
