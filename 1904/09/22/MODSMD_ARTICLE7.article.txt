The willingness with which a
great number of athletes have
turned out for fall track work
should not be overlooked without a
word of praise. The Freshmen
especially should receive due credit
for the spirit they have shown by
turning out at the first call of the
captain and trainer. There are
more Freshmen out than there are
old men. That is the situation
that should exist. The old men
have already had the advantage of
working under a thoroughly com
petent college trainer, but the
Freshmen have not, and for that
reason it is more urgent that first
year men lie out now. From the
new men there must be a number
of point winners developed and at
present there is every indication
that there will he. However, the
most encouraging feature is the un
usual number of Freshmen who are
willing to putin the fall season at
regular training. These men are
beginning their athletic career in
college with exactly the right spirit.
