# Executive Committee Meets.

### 
â€¢
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students met in regular
session last night. The matter of
new uniforms for the band was con
sidered, but no definite arrange
ment for their purchase has yet
been made. A committee from the
Glee Club appeared to confer with
the Executive Committee in regard
to the annual musical club tour,
but action on the matter was laid
over until the next meeting. After
some discussion the cardinal hat
used last year was again adopted
as the official rooter's headgear.
The remainder of the session was
devoted to routine business.
