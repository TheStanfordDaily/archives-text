Too Much Bother
The most annoying tiling one encoun
ters in the wearing of glasses is the con
stant care necessary to keep the lenses
clean and clear.
It is a foolish person indeed who will
risk his sight rather than take the
trouble to care for it properly. The
time to care for the sight is while you
have it. Don't wait until it is irretriev
ably impaired and then spend money
and time trying to regain it.
Eye care is our specialty. If your
glasses are wrong it's of no use to rub
and clean. You can't make them right
thutway. We fit glasses right.
