# VARSITY VS. PENSACOLA.
## Stanford Will Meet the Naval Apprentices on the Oval To-morrow. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon the Y T arsity
will meet the Pensacola sailors in the
second preliminary football game
of the season. Little is known of
the ability of the naval team, for
only three members of the team
that lost to the Varsity by a score
of 24-0 last year appear in the
line-up this season. It is known,
however, that the Goat Island
eleven is being coached by two for
mer Annapolis football stars.
Lieutenant Smith, who has been
detailed by the Navy department
to coach Annapolis this fall, has
been in San Francisco for the last
month, and it is probable that the
naval apprentices have received the
benefit of his coaching. The Pen
eacola team averages 178 pounds to
the man, and this weight is not
equaled by the Yarsity.
Coach Lanagan does not believe
in long halves so early in the sea
son, and he will insist on fifteen
and twenty minute periods for to
morrow's contest. Following his
usual plan, he will put as many
candidates into the game ae the lim
ited time permits.
The line-up of the two teams for
the first kick-off is as follows:
STANFORD PENSACOLA
Nissen c Regan
Zimmerman. . ,r g 1 Holm
Shields r t 1 Tople
Smith r e 1 Fowler
Monzingo 1 g r Donnelly
Sprague 1 t r Melville
Clark 1 e r Samuels
Bansbach q Jones
Chalmers r h 1 Weaver
Trowbridge.. .. 1h r McClure
Bogle 112 Acuff (c)
The officials will be: Referee,
Prof. C. 11. Lewers; timekeeper,
Prof. C. Searles; lineman, R. J. Mc-
Fadden, '05, and W. K. Sprott, '06.
The umpire will be selected by the
Pensacola eleven.
The severest blow sustained by
the Varsity this season is the loss
of Dole, '05, and Roosevelt, '05,
who cannot possibly be in condi
tion to take part in the intercol
legiate match. Both men are still
in the hospital, and will not be out
before three weeks from now. An
other distinct loss to the squad is
Haselwood, '06, who had his collar
bone fractured in the game with
the Olympic Club last Saturday.
Haselwood weighs 200 pounds, and
was a very promising guard.
