# JAPANESE-RUSSIAN WAR
## Rev. Dr. Frank Makes Interesting Address on Situation in the Far East. 
### 
Rev. Henry Frank of New York
Bpoke in the chapel this afternoon
on the historical and sociological
causes of the present struggle be
tween Russia and Japan. Before
speaking about the present war Dr.
Frank reviewed the more important
wars in the world's history and
discussed briefly their influence on
the development of the various na
tions.
In regard to the present Russian-
Japanese war he spoke in part as
follows:
"The modern government of
Russia rose in the 15th century,
when the country was over-run by
the Tartars. Before that the peo
ple had been absolutely free. Serf
dom in Russia is a comparatively
modern product. In comprehend
ing the possibilities and promise
of this government we must study
the motives and the actions psy
chologically; must make a study
of the people, and of the powers
operating in their social and politi
cal make-up. We are reminded of
the prophecy of Napoleon at St.
Helena, when he predicted that all
Europe must be eventually either
all cossack or all republican, that
either Russia shall rule univers
ally in Europe or the new in
spiration of democracy must pre
vail.
"If this war is not the most mo
mentous the world has ever
known it is at least one of the
most serious and important. A
great war means not the shedding
of blood nor the overthrowing of
dy nasties; hut it means the change
of status psychologically, morally,
spiritually, esthetically. History
helps us to a study of intellectual
and political conditions. The dis
position of every race grows out of
the original nature of the founders.
All peoples, unless hindered by
revolutions or other great factors,
carry the qualities of their found
ers. In the case of Russia this was
Peter the Great, who by his great
strength placed his immortal
stamp upon the people who are his
descendants. The Russia of to-day
inherits the nature of this monarch
with his narrow yet aggressive
nature.
"Japan is also a new country,
but there has been a marked differ
ence in her direction of develop
ment. She threw off Buddhism
and the Orientalism of China in
the 7th century, and until recent
times has lived secluded in a pa
triotic endeavor to maintain Japa
nese ideals and principles. In the
last century she has adopted the
most advanced modern civilization,
and represents the spirit of prog
ress.
"Japan is to the Russian ag
gressions what Greece was to those
of Persia. The princfpal danger is
from a Slavic peril, not a yellow
peril; the present war is to be
world-wide in its results of check
ing the Slavic peril."
