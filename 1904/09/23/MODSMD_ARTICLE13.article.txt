Whatever over-confidence there
may have been at the commence
ment of the football season must
now have disappeared, for in the
loss of two former Varsity men
from the squad Stanford's chances
of winning are decreased to a point
where only the hardest kind of work
and truining on the part of the
football men, and the most loyal
support by all Stanford sympa
thizers, will give a fighting chance
for victory. This matter cannot
be taken too seriously. We have
suffered a reverse that, although
unavoidable, is unfortunate in the
extreme. The loss of the two men
must be counterbalanced in part
by additional efforts on the part of
others.
