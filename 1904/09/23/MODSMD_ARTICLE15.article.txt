# BAND PURCHASES UNIFORMS.
## Complete New Outfit Will Be Worn by Men This Year. 
### 
It has been made possible to pur
chase new uniforms for the Univer
sity Band by the raising of $400
through subscription. The Execu
tive Committee agreed to appro
priate $250 to the fund upon
condition that the remaining $150
could be guaranteed. The mem
bers of the band contributed $50 by
individual subscription, and the
$100 necessary to complete the sum
was subscribed through the efforts
of Mr. Edwards of the Haber
dasher and M. H. Thorpe, '05.
Twenty-five new uniforms will be
ordered from the tailoring depart
ment of Frazer & Co., Palo Alto.
The color of the uniforms will be
cardinal, a shade darker than those
now used by the band, and the
trimming will be of black braid.
A good quality of cloth will be used
in making the uniforms. They
will be lined throughout, and are
expected to last several years. The
old uniforms were purchased sev
eral years ago, and were of such
quality that it was found necessary
to replace several of them each
year. As a result the uniforms
now being worn by the band are in
poor condition, and the enlarge
ment of the organization made it
advantageous to buy new ones.
The band will first appear in the
new uniforms in about two weeks.
Regular practices are being held
and the improvement in the band
work is rapid. A consignment of
new music has been received and
will be tried at once. The band
will be out at all the Saturday foot
ball games between now and the
intercollegiate contest, and will also
be on the bleachers at other times
during the week. Promenade con
certs will be resumed as soon as
arrangements can be completed.
