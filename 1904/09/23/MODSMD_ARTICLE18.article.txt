# FRESHMEN DEFEATED.
## Santa Clara College Easily Wins Second Preliminary Game. Score, 10-0. 
### 
The Freshman team lost the sec
ond preliminary football game to
the eleven from Santa Clara Col
lege by a score of 10-0. The score,
however, does not indicate the de
cisiveness of the defeat sustained
by the '08 team, and good fortune
rather than good playing saved
them from a more crushing reverse.
From the start to the finish of the
match the Freshmen were hope
lessly outplayed, and throughout
the entire contest Santa Clara's
goal was never once threatened.
The visitors were heavier and faster
than the Freshmen, and in their
team work showed evidence of ex
cellent coaching. The rapid change
of players on the Freshman team
was not conducive to good team
work, but this phase of the game
was no worse on the average than
the individual work of the players.
The Freshmen lost the ball to
Santa Clara several times on inex
cusable fumbles. Santa Clara also
fumbled frequently, but was usual
ly quick enough to recover the ball
before it fell into the hands of their
opponents. Perhaps the most
stupid playing of the day was done
by the ends, who were directly re
sponsible for at least one of the
touch-downs made by Santa Clara.
For the visitors Feeney, Schmitz,
Magee, and Ivancovitch played the
best game; and the line-bucking of
Feeney, and the end-running of
Schmitz were the special features
of the game.
The game was somewhat marred
by frequent wrangles between of
ficials and players. Another un
fortunate feature was a painful in
jury sustained by Pemberton in
one of the scrimmages. The liga
ments of his right ankle are badly
torn, and it is possible that he may
not be able to play again this sea
eon.
The line-up of the teams was as

Santa Clara kicked off, and the
Freshmen ran the ball in five
yards. By a series of end runs
and cross bucks the Freshmen ad
vanced the ball to the middle of
the gridiron. At this stage of the
game the Freshmen fumbled and
Santa Clara gained the ball.
Steadily and surely the Freshman

line was hammered for bucks of
from three to five yards each until
the hall was on Stanford's one
yard line. Here the Freshmen
held like veterans, and Santa Clara
was forced to surrender the ball.
A long punt put the ball out of
immediate danger, but in the pos
session of Santa Clara near the
center of the field. By the same
tactics Santa Clara again carried
the ball down the field and over
the line for a touch-down. On the
last buck Schmitz fumbled the ball
but it was thrown over the goal
line, where Ivancovitch fell on it.
Magee failed to kick the goal, and
the half ended with the score 5-0
in favor of Santa Clara.
The second half found the Fresh
man team weaker, and the Santa
Clara players in better form. A
fake end run gained thirty-five
yards for Santa Clara, and placed
the ball within fifteen yards of the
'08 goal-line. A fake quarter-back
play by Magee covered the remain
ing distance, and made the second
touch-down for Santa Clara. Ma

time was called with the score

Officials: McFadden, '05, and
Byrnes alternated as referee and
umpire.
Santa Clara kicked off, and the
Freshmen ran the ball in five
yards. By a series of end runs
and cross bucks the Freshmen ad
vanced the ball to the middle of
the gridiron. At this stage of the
game the Freshmen fumbled and
Santa Clara gained the ball.
Steadily and surely the Freshman

line was hammered for bucks of
from three to five yards each until
the hall was on Stanford's one
yard line. Here the Freshmen
held like veterans, and Santa Clara
was forced to surrender the ball.
A long punt put the ball out of
immediate danger, but in the pos
session of Santa Clara near the
center of the field. By the same
tactics Santa Clara again carried
the ball down the field and over
the line for a touch-down. On the
last buck Schmitz fumbled the ball
but it was thrown over the goal
line, where Ivancovitch fell on it.
Magee failed to kick the goal, and
the half ended with the score 5-0
in favor of Santa Clara.
The second half found the Fresh
man team weaker, and the Santa
Clara players in better form. A
fake end run gained thirty-five
yards for Santa Clara, and placed
the ball within fifteen yards of the
'08 goal-line. A fake quarter-back
play by Magee covered the remain
ing distance, and made the second
touch-down for Santa Clara. Ma
gee again failed to kick a goal, and
time was called with the score
10-0 in favor of Santa Clara Col
lege.
