# Statement by Dr. Murray.
## 
### 
The "Ajax" of Sophocles is to be
presented in the Greek by students
of the University of California on
Thursday. October 15th. The play
will be given in the new Greek
theater, and will be under the
direction of Miss Mabel Barrows,
who so successfully directed the
presentations in New York and Chi
cago last year.
This production, in a theater,
and amid surroundings so uniquely
adapted to it, cannot fail to be of
the very highest interest and
beauty, and it is to be hoped that
many from our community will be
able to be present. I shall be very
glad to meet with any who may
desire to read the play in the Greek
at any hour and place that may be
found mutually convenient. Ten
tatively, I will fix upon 2:30 in
room 20, on Tuesday, September
27th, as an initial hour.
If any, who are unable to read
the play in the Greek, desire to
hear it interpreted or translated, I
shall be glad to meet them at some
hour to be arranged.
A. T. Murray.
