# Girls' Glee Club Meeting
## 
### 
Informal practice was the feature
of the first meeting of the Girls'
Glee Cluh, which was held in the
chapel yesterday. There were six
teen candidates for membership, a
large per centage of these being
former members. The absence of a
number of promising candidates
prevented the committees from an
nouncing the final list that goes to
make up the permanent organiza
tion.
