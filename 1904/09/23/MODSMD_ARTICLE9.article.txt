# Campus Improvement.
## 
### 
The road in front of the Engi
neering buildings is being improved.
After it has been leveled some five
inches, the road will be rolled and
putin first-class condition. This
leveling has been found necessary
to assure good drainage. During
the rainy season the road has hith
erto been almost useless for traffic.
An extra step has been added to
the entrance of the Mechanical En
gineering building to meet the new
level.
