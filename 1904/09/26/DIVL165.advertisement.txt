DARKNESS AND LIGHT
Are in no greater contrast than the old
haphazard method of fitting glasses and
onr modern scientific methods.
Defects of vision which once bathed
the optician are quickly discovered and
easily corrected.
Troubles which were formerly treated
with drugs and operations are now known
to be only symptoms of eye strain, which
can only be relieved by right glasses.
Glasses nearly right often cause more
trouble than none. We tit them RIGHT,
JUST RIGHT, and guarantee satisfac
tion in every case.
