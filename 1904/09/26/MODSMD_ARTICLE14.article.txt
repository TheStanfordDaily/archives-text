One of the most important mat
ters before the student body at the
present time, and one that presents
a perplexing problem to be decided
in the near future by the Executive
Committee, is whether or not the
Associated Students shall be finan
cially responsible foÂ«r another tour
of the musical clubs. The ques
tions which arise in a discussion of
this proposition seem to be: (1)
have the trips of the last two years
been an advantage to the Univer
sity; (2) if so, has the benefit been
great enough to offset the financial
deficit incurred; and (3) does the
outlook for future trips give more
promise than in the past?
It will be generally conceded
that a poor musical organization
standing as a representation of an
institution is far worse than none
at all. It has been claimed that
the musical clubs advertise the
University in a legitimate way, and
that they are the cause which
draws a considerable number of
students to Stanford. This has not
always been true in the past.
When the clubs have been highly
efficient they have probably done
some good in the way of advertise
ment. But too often have the per
formances been such that they
have not made a favorable impres
sion. So it would seem, first of all,
that if the clubs are to be sent out
they should be required to reach
and maintain a standard of excel
lence that will excel any other sim
ilar college organization on the
Coast, and that will reflect due
credit upon the University which
they represent. Even at best
the clubs cannot do a great
amount of good in the way
of distributing favorable impres
sions of Stanford over the country,
and the second question as to
whether the good to be done by a
first-class organization will offset
the financial risk is one that is
open to debate.
University musical clubs are a
very common thing in nearly every
part of the country, and even the
territory covered by the Stanford
clubs last year was traversed by

organizations from institutions in
the Northwest. In other words per
formances of college glee clubs have
ceased to hold the distinction and
attractiveness that formerly charac
terized them. This proved true
with the Stanford clubs last year,
and the deficit incurred by the trip
was no small hardship on the
whole student body. If these state
ments are true then there is not
much prospect that future trips will
do better than those in the past.
On the whole it does not seem
advisable that the student body
should send out the clubs and
stand responsible for financial
losses. Last year notes were signed
by the members of the clubs as
part guarantee against a deficit,
but it is stated on good authority
that few, if any, of these notes were
paid. That experience would not
warrant a similar method of secur
ity in the future, and if the musi
cal clubs are desirous of making
holiday tours in years to com?, it
would seem that it is only just that
the individual members advance a
sum sufficient to guard against as
heavy losses as have been incurred
in the past.
