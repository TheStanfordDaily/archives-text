## Rev. D. Charles Gardner Preaches on the Subject of Godliness. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner preached
in Memorial Church Sunday morn
ing. His text was from 1 Timothy
4:8, "For bodily exercise profiteth
little: but Godliness is profitable
unto all things, having promise of
the life that now is, and of that
which is to come." Dr. Gardner
said in part:
" 1 am constantly asked questions
about religion. To answer these
questions adequately would require
a course of lectures. But there are
one or two elementary ideas which
may be developed in a sermon, and
so I wish to speak simply and
briefly about true religion. Speak
ing broadly, religion is indepen
dent of outward observances. In
its true genius it lies behind all
creeds and churches. In itself it
is the tap-root of all religions,
flowering in the utmost diversity of
forms. Religion thus depicted is
the key to all civilization; it has
inspired great reformations; it is
the motive of every creed and the
life of every church.
"But what is religion as it con
cerns human nature? Is it feeling
or emotion, is it obedience to a
code of morals, is it loyalty to a
body of doctrine, is it loyalty to
the church? True religion em
braces all these elements, but in its
essence it is something much
simpler: it is our relation to God.
Religion finds its moral expression
in right living, for it dominates
the moral faculty with its con
science; its intellectual expression
is found in creeds; its social ex
pression in worship. But the inner
spiritual meaning of religion is
private and personal: it is a relation
established between the soul and
God. It helps above every other
principle in the development of
character and the regulation of
conduct. It is the power which
can alone guide us aright through
time to eternity.
"I know there are many hin
drances: instincts and appetites
and passions run riot in our blood
and vex the mind and distort the
conscience; and our social environ
ment, so frankly pleasure-loving,
and the crushing materialism of
our time, all conspire against that
Godliness of which the apostle
speaks. But have a little grit in
the matter; and don't shirk the
intellectual difficulties. Face them.
In your studies you are dealing in
facts and principles capable of veri
fication. In religious matters you
often find yourselves compelled to
say: not 'I know,'but '1 believe.'
Learn once and for all that there
are many things we cannot know;
that is, we cannot have them dem
onstrated as a problem in mathe
matics or an experiment in chem
istry.
" Even in science there is a vast
domain as yet unexplored,â€” many
elementary problems remain un
solved. As to the why and where
fore of things we can but risk a
magnificent guess. And beyond
the suggestions which concern self,
beyond the world of earth, there
rests some deeper mystery still;
there lies some other world of
which we only dream. We have
but faith; we cannot know."
