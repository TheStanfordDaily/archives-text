# VARSITY DEFEATS SAILORS.
## Pensacola Apprentices Proved to Be No Match for Stanford Eleven. 
### 
Last Saturday's game was a walk
over for the Varsity, and in limited
halves of 15 and 20 minutes each
34 points were scored against the
Pensacola sailors. While the score
was large, the playing of the Var
sity was not altogether satisfactory.
Bad fumbles were frequent, and in
more than one play the hacks were
badly mixed in their signals. One
especially pleasing feature of the
game, however, was the speed with
which the plays were executed.
The inexperienced sailors were
overwhelmed by the quickness of
the Varsity attacks, and had it not
been for frequently imposed penal
ties Stanford would have increased
the score considerably.
The nix touch-downs were made
by Sprague, Trowbridge, Stott,
Tomasini, Weller, and Brennan.
Four of the touch-downs were con
verted into goals by Smith and Stott,
each kicking two. The sailors
made their distance twice, and held
the Varsity for downs the same
number of times.
The line-up of the teams was as

The Varsity relied on straight
football to gain their yards, and
most of the pi ays were end runs,
straight bucks, and the tackle
around formations. Trowbridge
and Brennan ran the Pensacola
ends for 20 and 30 yards, while
Thompson and Tomasini would al
most equal their gains with the
tackle-around play. Tomasini's
punting and work at the tackle po

sition Saturday would indicate that
he is a distinct Varsity possibility.
The naval apprentices played a
gritty determined game, but their
work showed that they are novices
at football, and that they could not
play successfully against the supe
rior skill of the Varsity. Acuff,
who is coach as well as captain of
the visiting team, played a good
game for the sailors. Jones and
McClure were also among the most
efficient on the sailors' line-up.
Stanford kicked off, secured the
ball from the sailors on a fumble,
and bucked it over the goal-line
three minutes after play began.
The second touch-down was made
by the same tactics in about the
same space of time. The Varsity
lost so many yards on penalties in
flicted for holding in the line and
off-side plays that more time was
consumed in making the third
touch-down. The first half ended
with the score 17-0 in favor of Stan
ford. For the opening of the sec
ond period the line-up of the Var
sity was almost entirely changed.
Three touch-downs were made in
this half, which was a duplicate of
the first. The game ended with the
score 34-0 in favor of the Varsity.
