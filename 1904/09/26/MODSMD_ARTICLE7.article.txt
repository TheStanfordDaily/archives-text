the men who are taking advanced
or graduate law courses. The sec
ond election, to take in men who
are taking junior-year law courses,
will be held near the end of the
present semester.
The initiation of the new mem
bers is already in progress. The
men appeared on the quad during
the day muffled up in overcoats,
but without hats. This was only
the preliminary performance, how
ever, and to-morrow there will be
new and more varied feats on the
inner quadrangle. During each
intermission of the morning hours
the men will have something to
say or do. The formal initiation
will take place in San Jose to-mor
row night.
