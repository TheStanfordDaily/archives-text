# FRESHMEN VS. OAKLAND HIGH.
## Third Preliminary Game Will Be Played by First-Year Squad To-morrow at 4. 
### 
The Freshmen will line up against
a team from the Oakland high
school for the third preliminary
game of the season to-morrow after
noon. This will probably prove
one of the most interesting of the
preliminary contests, as the Oak
land team lias the reputation
of being one of the best elevens in
the Academic League this year.
Oakland played the California
freshmen two weeks ago, and al
though scored against in the first
five minutes of play, managed to
outpoint their opponents during
the greater part of the match. Last
Saturday the Oakland team de
feated an eleven from the Stockton
high school by a score of 84-0.
The plan of playing as many
men as the limited halves permit
will be continued in the game to
morrow, and it is probable that
every player on the freshman squad
will be given a chance to play
against the high school team. Cad
wallader, who played right-half in
the Santa Clara game, may not be
able to play to-morrow on account
of an injury to his leg, which he
sustained in practice Saturday.
Pemberton has not recovered suffi
ciently from his injuries to be in
to-morrow's game, but he will be
well in time to participate in the
other preliminary contests.
The game will commence
promptly at 4, and the admission
will be 25 cents.
The two teams will line-up for
the kick-off as follows:
FRKSHMEN OAKLAND HIGH
Overman r e 1.. .Livingstone
Bryan r t 1 Havens
Moody r g 1 Davis
Coe c Bra m ha 11
Gav 1 g r... Lanagan
Forrest 1 t r Greeley
Wilson 1 e r Spangler
Fenton q Ghiradelli
Oadwallader .. .r h 1 Jackson
Kocher 1 hr.. Countryman
Newman 112 Stow
It is announced that the training
table will be started about the first
of October. No definite arrange
ments for the location and fare of
the table have been completed, but
it is expected that the matter will
be finally settled in the course of a
few days.
Manager Barrett is engaged in
an attempt to procure a game for
the Varsity on the first Tuesday
after the Freshman intercollegiate
contest. There is no Varsity game
between the 12th and the 22d of
October, and this period is con
sidered too long for the Var
sity to go without a prac
tice game. The number of
ex-Varsity men who are now in
the neighborhood of the University
has suggested the feasibility of an
alumni game, and it is possible
that such a contest may be secured.
If this plan fails an attempt will
l)e .made to secure a game with
Santa Clara College.
