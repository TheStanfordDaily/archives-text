United States Commission of Fish
and Fisheries, Dr. Jordan, in col
laboration with Curator E. C.
Starks, publishes ii report of the
research work accomplished during
the trip of the steamer Albatross in
the summer of 1900. The report is

steamer Albatross off the coast of
Japan in the summer of 1900, with
descriptions of new species, and a

one hundred and twenty-five kinds
of fishes that were met with during
the trip. The bulletin is profusely
illustrated.
Dr. Jordan and Curator Starks
have also published a description
of a new cyprinoid fish, which
appeared in the April number
of the bulletin of the Smith
sonian Institute. The fish de
scribed is the Hemibarbus Joiteni,
and is found in the I'ei Ho

other paper on the fishes of Korea
appeared in a recent number of the
Fish Commission's bulletin, and
described twelve new species of fish
that have been discovered in Korean
waters.
Starks has recently published an
article in the Biological Bulletin
entitled "A Synopsis of Character
of Some Fishes Belonging to the
Haplomi," and has written one
which will soon appear in the- Ger

''The Osteology of Vallia Pector
alis." He is at present working on
the terms used in the osteology of
fishes, for the Century dictionary.
