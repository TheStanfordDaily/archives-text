# SUMMARY OF NEW STUDENTS.

### 
Registration of Matriculates for
Present Semester Breaks
Record.
The Registrar's office lias pre
pared an interesting statement of
the registration of freshmen and
other new students for the present
semester. The figures show that
the class of '08 is the largest that
has ever matriculated in the Uni
versity, exceeding by 22 the class
of '06, which held the record «s
the greatest in numbers. The total
number of men and women regis
tering at Stanford for the first time
is 488, as compared with 437 a
year ago, and 466 two years ago.
The number of students from other
colleges and universities shows a
considerable increase, as also does
the number from preparatory
schools. The number of special
students remains practically sta
tionary as a result of the enforce
ment of the rule against the ad
mission of women specials and the
greater qualifications required of
men specials.
Owing to pressure of news on its
columns the Daily Palo Alto is
unable to print the entire list of
names in one issue. It publishes
to-night, therefore, the general sum

maries and a partial list of students
from preparatory schools. The re
maining lists of students from pre
paratory schools, from other uni
versities, and special students, will
follow during the week.
