# SELECT DATE FOR PLUG UGLY.
## Committee Will Require Manuscripts to be in by October Seventh. 
### 
The committee in charge of the
Plug Ugly met last night and de
cided upon the date for the produc
tion, and passed upon a number of
other details. The Plug Ugly will
be given this year on Friday even
ing, October 28th, a few days later
than last year. Owing to the fact
that the plugs have to lie brought
from New York, and in order to
allow plenty of time for the re
hearsal of the Ping Ugly when the
latter is chosen, it was considered
impossible to have the performance
at an earlier date. The plugs have
been ordered sent out by express,
and the contract calls for their de
livery in ample time. October
28th is the evening before the foot
ball game with the University of
Oregon.
The committee also decided to
require that all manuscripts shall
be submitted not Inter than Friday
evening, October 7th, instead of
October 10th, as previously an
nounced. The purpose of the
change is to allow the committee to
have the manuscripts read and
pass upon them during the follow
ing two days, Saturday and Sun
day, when University work need
not interfere with the task. When
the piece is finally selected no time
will be lost in choosing the cast,
and rehearsals will be begun at
once. These will be to a large ex
tent under the direction of the suc
cessful author.
