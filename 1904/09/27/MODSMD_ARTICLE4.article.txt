Encina Club held a meeting last
night for the purpose of deciding
whether the regular Encina dance
should be held before or after the
intercollegiate football game.
F. S. Holman. '05, president of
the club, made a short speech in
regard to the use of the magazines
in the club-room, and a few other
matters of importance to club mem
bers. Pie also spoke in regard to
the regular dance given by the club
during the first semester of the col
lege year, and urged that it would
be an advantage to the football
men if this were given after the in
tercollegiate game. On motion it
was decided to hold the "at home"
on the evening of either November
18th or 19th.
President Holman appointed a
committee composed of E. G. Brua,
'04, G. R. Stevens, '05, and 0. E.
Hyde, '05, to draft resolutions of
sympathy in memory of Irving H.
Sevier, ex-'O5, the news of whose
