# WOMEN ATHLETES MEET.
## Discuss Work for the Ensuing Year. Club Started by the Association. 
### 
The Women's Athletic Associa
tion met this afternoon at 1:15,
and heard the work for the year
outlined by those most interested
in the various branches.
Miss M. Ray, '05, the tennis cap
tain, spoke in much the same strain
as yesterday, when she addressed
her remarks to tennis enthusiasts
alone. In the absence of Miss Helen
Salisbury, '05, Miss Emma Hay
ward, '06, spoke in the interests of
basket-ball. The old squad lias
deemed it advisable to adopt a set
of by-laws to be used by the
Basket-hall Club. From this club,
to which all women interested in
basket-ball are eligible, the squad
members will lie chosen. A series
of three try-outs has been decided
upon, the winners in the series
being chosen as members of the
intercollegiate team. Two games
were played with California last
year, and it is hoped that this sea
son the squad may join the Basket
ball League, thus insuring games
with Mills College, Nevada and sev
eral other teams. After the work is
well organized and under way, it
is hoped that light practice may be
instituted for those who are inter
ested in the game and are unable
to give the time or strength to the
more vigorous work.
A new branch of athletics has
been added to the list. This is to
be known as the Walking Club.
Upon the request of several of the
members this department has been
organized with Miss Shirley Hyatt,
'06, at the head. A Senior walking
club at Roble Hall last year proved
very successful, and the association
has planned to have one club com
posed of women from the rows, two
from Roble, and one from Palo
Alto. The members are required to
walk for one hour Hix days a week.
Fines for non-performance of the
regulations will be enforced.
The constitution of the associa
tion may be found in the library of
the Education department, and it
is earnestly desired that all women
not already members will become
members at once by signing the
constitution. There is no fee re
quired other than the regular stu
dent body fee.
