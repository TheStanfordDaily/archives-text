"Telangiectases"
You want the eye taken away from its
technicalities, you want some one to lay
aside all talk about telangiectases,
anthelasma, etc., and in plain, every
day language, which anybody can under
stand, present the subject.
Here is a plain talk which all who
have normal vision can read.
Caution about theUse and Selection ofSpectar: \
*'P«».oni hftrinf normal vUlon will t» abU to read thl# print at a a
of 14 inchea from the ejee with eaa« and oomfort; alao will b« able to read if
•tth each eje aeparatelj. If u&ahle to do bo your e?es are defective and
ihould hare immediate attention. When the eyes beoome tired from reading
or aewing, or if the letters look blurred and mn together, it Is a sure indica
tion that (lasses are needed. The lenses sold in the cheap goods are of un
equal density and bare imperfectly formed surfkoee. Continued use of tbeae
poorer lenaes will reault in positive injury from the oonatant strain upon tfaft

Do you value your eyesight?
Then don't wear glasses unless you
know that they are right.
If you need glasses or a change of
lenses, come and see us.
We'll be glad to have you come in
and talk it over, whether you purchase
or not.
