# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Week Sees Improvement in Play of Both Varsity and Freshmen. 
### 
The work of the Varsity football
squad has improved notably dur
ing the past week, and the rivalry
for places on the team is becoming
keener each day. The unusual
cool weather had aided Coach Lan
agan materially in his determina
tion to develop a fast team, and in
speed if nothing else the play of
the candidates this week lias ap
proached Varsity form. Lanagan
lias expressed the opinion that the
climate of this Coast is not detri
mental to the development of an
eleven equal to tbe best Eastern
teams in swiftness of attack.
Instruction in the rudiments of
the game has become of minor im
portance in the practice period, but
the good effects of the severe drill
in this department of the game is
seen in tbe improved manner in
which tbe ball is handled by the
men. The rough edges have been
worn off, and the players are
tackling in good form and showing
better judgment in running down
on punts.
The scrimmage work last night
was notable for the good offensive
playing of both teams. Pne of tbe
most sensational plays of the even
ing was made by Stott, who caught
a punt, and aided by brilliant in
terference ran tbe ball in for thirty
yards. Brennan, Chalmers,Crowe,
and Trowbridge played well in the
back field, and their work showed
that the coaches will experience
some difficulty in selecting the
halves for tbe Varsity. Weller is
bucking much lower this year than
last season, and this change will
make him a much more dangerous
factor to opposing teams, while ren
dering him less liable to injury.
Horton, who has been playing
tackle on the Varsity, was tried at
full-back this week. While his foot
ball knowledge is limited, he prom
ises to develop into a strong, fast
player.
The Freshman squad is gradually
rounding into shape, and the final
selection of the team is being sim
plified. About one more prelim
inary game will be necessary to
determine the line-up of the team
which will oppose California in the
annual Freshman game. The play
ing of the Freshmen this week has
been a little more consistent than
usual, but the squad still suffers
from attacks of listlessness.
