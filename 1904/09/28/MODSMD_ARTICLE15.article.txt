With the approach of the Plug
Ugly, the song competition, and
other student literary productions,
it is opportune to call attention to
the movement, published in an
other column, which has for its
object the preservation of all
original manuscripts, posters, and
the like, by presenting them to the
University collection in the Mu
seum. It is suggested that the
committees having these various
entertainments in charge make it a
point to save for the Museum this
interesting data. The custom once
started will become fixed, and much
of the personal history of the stu
dent life of the University will thus
be preserved.
