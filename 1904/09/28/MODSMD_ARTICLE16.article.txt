W'k wish to say to the men who
sit on the bleachers and watch the
football practice a few words on
behalf of the track men. Last year
it became a practice for the specta
tors to "josh" the runners as they
went by the grandstand. The fun
was always good natured, but none
the less embarrassing for the vic
tims because of that fact. The
result is becoming evident this
year, when a number of new and
old men refuse to appear on the
track during football hours because
they are afraid of being made fun
of before the crowd, and a number
refuse to come out at all. Even
the gymnasium classes will not run
before the bleachers, but double on
the back stretch.
This is not at all as it should be.
The men and women on the bleach
ers should always remember that
the men who get out on the track
are doing just as much work for
their college as are the men who
play football, although at the pres
ent day they may not be uppermost
in the college public's mind. Many
of these men are new to the college,
and some may never have been
upon a track before. But it is
from these that future Varsity ath
letes are made, and their first efforts
should not be the subject of rid
icule. They should be applauded
and encouraged. It is only in this
way that the best results can be

secured for the future, and it is re
sults that every Stanford man and
woman wants. Therefore to the
Stanford spirit of decency and fair
play let us add that of courtesy.
