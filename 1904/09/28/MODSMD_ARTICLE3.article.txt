# STANFORD BOAT CLUB MEETS.
## Shell Ordered from the East.â€”Finances of the Club Discussed. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club met last
night to formulate plans for the
coming season. The main topic of
discussion was the way in which to
raise funds to carry on the work
already planned. The question of
ordering a shell came up. Some
did not favor the idea of buying a
shell until there was enough money
on hand to pay for it. It was also
argued that a shell could not be
used until Lagunita was filled with
water, which will not be until Jan
uary, and hence should not be or
dered this early. It was further
suggested by a few that the prog
ress of boating had thus far not
been sufficient to warrant buying a
shell. The number of men who
have signed the membership rolls
thus far numbers fifty, and a con
siderable number more are expect
ed to join at once. The initiation
fee is two dollars, making the
amount collected from dues at
present <$100. There is a surplus
left from last year of .$46. So the
club has now on hand <$146. With
this to start on and the probability
of a material addition by future
dues, it was thought that the
finances of tbe club would warrant
buying a shell. A unanimous vote
followed authorizing the purchase
of a shell. The shell will be a four
oared boat and will be fitted for
use with a coxswain. It will cost
<$800, and will be shipped west
with the shell recently ordered by
the California Boating Association,
thus making a saving in freight.
Considerable discussion occurred
as to the manner in which tbe re
maining money should be raised.
It was suggested that a local play
be given, but it was opposed by
some because it was encroaching
on the ground of the classes, who
have been tbe only ones to stage
plays with a local setting. Other
means were proposed without re
sult, so a committee of N. P. Bryan,
'07, 11. H. Gardner, '07, and F. W.
Turner, '08, was appointed by
President Butterfield to look over
the ground and make a report at
the next meeting.
It was proposed to buy pleasure
boats for the use of club members
who could not enter into regular
training. Boats of this kind made
of galvanized iron could be bought
for about $35. Some discussion as
to tiie advisability of such a pur
chase resulted, and the question
was referred to a committee com
posed of W. J. Morin, '05, and C.
E. Bee, '07.
The committee which had in
charge tbe work of finding a loca
tion on the bay for a boat-bouse
could make no definite report, as
they had been unable to ascertain
who owned tbe land in the location
they considered best for the erection
of a building.
