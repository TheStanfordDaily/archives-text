# HISTORICAL COLLECTION.
## Contributions Coming in Slowly to the Department Illustrative of Student Life. 
### 
Interest has been revived in the
University historical collection of
the Museum by the presentation
from one of Stanford's earliest
graduates of his entire collection
of souvenirs and memorabilia of
his student life. The donor, F. B.
Wootten, '95, was one of the very
few who retained the various pro
grams, posters, papers, and the like
which characterized the first gen
eration of Stanford life. There is
included a complete file of registers,
the early Quads, a set of registra
tion cards, numerous photographs,
song-books, invitations, schedules,
and other University publications
of that period. These will be of
great value as a nucleus from
which the collection will be built.
A number of other souvenirs
have been received from different
graduates, which will be classified
and added to these. The Museum
is receiving the co-operation of the
Library in this effort. Accordingly
notice was sent out with each copy
of the late issue of the Alumni di
rectory calling attention lo the new
collection and inviting contribu
tions. Special stress is laid upon
the desirability of all articles writ
ten by the faculty, alumni, and
students. These need not neces
sarily be relative to Stanford. It
is urged that the students also be
come interested in the matter and
turn over whatever may be of in
terest historically. Duplicate post
ers and publications are in the
possession of the Museum which
may be exchanged profitably.
The famous Yale and Harvard
historical collections are a direct
result of personal contributions of
this nature.
