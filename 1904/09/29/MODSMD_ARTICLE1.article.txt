# PRESIDENT JORDAN RETURNS.
## Congress of World's Scientists at St. Louis the Greatest Ever Held. 
### 
President Jordan returned to the
University yesterday after an ab
sence of about two weeks, during
which he attended the International
Congress of Arts and Sciences at
the St. Louis Exposition. This
was probably the greatest gather
ing of its kind that has ever been
held, and one that wili not be re
peated in a great many years.
About 250 of the most distin
guished scientists and literary men
of the world were present, in some
cases, as in chemistry, all the ac
knowledged leaders of to-day at
tending. Each one of these schol
ars read an address, the whole cov
ering the general aspect of all
knowledge. These addresses will
all be gathered together and pub
lished, making ten large volumes.
This will be the greatest contribu
tion to scientific literature ever
made at one time.
At the opening of the great con
gress seven general addresses were
made, and to President Jordan of
Stanford fell the honor of deliver
ing one of these. Dr. Jordan
spoke on the"Utilitarian Sciences."
Liberal extracts from his address
were printed in these columns a
few days ago. After these seven
preliminary addresses, the congress
was divided up into sections, each
science or art having its own sep
arate meetings and conducting its
own business. At these separate
sessions the other Stanford profes
sors who attended the congress
made speeches. Dr. Abbott of the
Law department spoke before the
lawyers on "The History of the
Common Law," and Professor
Dennis on "International Law."
Professors Durand and C. D. Marx
of the Engineering department
made addresses before the sectional
gathering of engineers. President
Jordan presided over the section
on national administration, one of
the addresses before which was de
livered by James Bryce, the famous
English writer.
From Europe a large percentage
of the greatest scholars were pres
ent, especially those representing
chemistry, geology, botany, astron
omy, and theology. Among these
were the four greatest chemists of
the world â€” Ostwald, Vant'hoff,
Arrhenius, and llamsav; Sir Ron
ald Ross, who discovered the car
rying of disease by mosquitoes;
De Vries of Amsterdam and Wil
mack of the University of Berlin,
both great botanists; and M. Phil
ippovitch of Vienna, famous as a
railroad economist.
The gathering afforded an op
portunity for President Jordan to
make the acquaintance of the
brightest minds of the sciences and
of the universities of Europe. With
the breaking-up of the congress
many of the delegates have scat
tered all over the United States.
Some of them have already visited
the Pacific Coast, viewing thecoun
try and studying the conditions,
but others are yet to come. Among
these will be Atili Brunialti, a
member of the Italian parliament
and of the royal Council of State,

notice of whose lecture at Stanford
University next Monday evening
iH given in another column.
Signor Brunialti is one of Italy's
greatest orators, and his address
before the Congress of Arts and
Sciences at St. Louis is said hy
President Jordan to have been one
of the interesting features of the
convention.
