It is often necessary to urge the
members of the community to sup
port some student activity that is
not given due assistance, but that
should not be true with football,
which above all other branches of
student life would seem to receive
sufficient patronage. And yet it is
a fact that yesterday's game did
not pay expenses of advertising and
transportation. Why the campus
games this year should be so poorly
attended is hard to explain.
Surely if ever a football season
gave reason for support and enthu
siasm it is the present. The pre
liminary games so far have been as
good or better than those of former
years. The game yesterday from
the standpoint of the spectator was
one well worth seeing, and nothing
more than lack of interest can
account for the small crowd on the
bleachers. The othercampus games
will be first-cbiss contests, deserving
of the support which it is hoped will
be given them.
