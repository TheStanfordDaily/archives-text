# FRESHMEN DEFEAT OAKLAND.
## High-School Team Easily Defeated by a Score of 16-0. 
### 
The third preliminary game of
the season was won yesterday by
the Freshmen against the Oakland
high school eleven by the score of
10 to 0. Two touch-downs were
made, and the additional four
points were secured as the game
was almost ended by a drop-kick
made from the twenty-five-yard
line by qnarter-back Fenton.
After the first twor touch-downs
the game was slow, and an unusual
amount of time taken out made the
contest slow and tedious. The Oak
land team played a listless game,
but their work improved as the
game progressed, and they cleariy
outpointed the Freshmen in the
second half. In this period the
Freshmen punted frequently, and
the yards gained by this means
probably saved them from being
scored on by the high school team.
During the second half the Fresh
man line was battered for from two
to five yards on each buck. Straight
bucks through guard found the
most vulnerable point of attack in
the Freshman line, and a knowl
edge of this fact gained many yards
for the high school players.
The line-up was as follows:

The most successful plays em
ployed by the Freshmen were end
runs,which the Oakland ends could
not stop. The longest run of the
game was made by Vandervoort,
who carried the ball sixty-five
yards.
As was expected, the game yes
terday simplified the selection of
the team which will meet the Cali
fornia freshmen in the annual con
test. The coaches refuse to discuss
the showing made by the Freshmen,
but they could not conceal their
disappointment at the poor playing
of the men on the line. The first
touch-down was made by Vander
voort after the ball had been in
play for four minutes. And the
second was made by the same
player exactly three minutes later.
The Oakland team took a brace,
and the remainder of the first per
iod was more evenly contested.

The second half was clearly to
the advantage of the Oakland
eleven, and bj' straight bucks and
quarter-back runs the ball was
carried almost the entire length of
the field. A punting duel then
ensued which was in favor of the
Freshmen, and an unfortunate fum
ble by Oakland left the '08 team in
possession of the ball on their op
ponents' 25-yard line. Only a few
seconds of play remained, and see
ing the futility of carrying the ball
over the goal-line, the Freshman
quarter-back signaled for a drop
kick, and booted the hall squarely
between the goal-posts. The game
ended shortly afterwards with the
score 16 to 0 in favor of the Fresh
men.
