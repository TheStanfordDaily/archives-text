# VARSITY VS. OLYMPICS.
## Stanford Will Play Club Men for the Second Time To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
For the second time this season
the Varsity will meet the football
team from the Olympic Cluh on
the campus oval to-morrow after
noon. Two weeks ago the Varsity
suffered defeat at the hands of the
heavy cluh men, and the efforts of
the Stanford team to reverse that
result will make to-morrow's game
decidedly interesting.
Coach Hopper refused to allow
the California varsity to play
against the Olympics last Saturday,
so the game to-morrow will be the
second contest of the season for the
club men. Although the number of
games played by the club eleven
this season is thus limited, the
Olympics have been more faithful
in their practice than is usual with
club teams, and they are in shape
to stand a hard contest.
The Varsity has lined up for
heavy scrimmage work each after
noon of this week, and the men are
in shape to put up a swift game,
and if the weather is cool it is
probable that longer halves than
usual will be played.
The two teams will line up for
the kick-off as follows:
STANFORD OLYMPICS
