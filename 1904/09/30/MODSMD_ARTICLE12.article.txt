# Small Registration of Voters.
## 
### 
The registration of voters for the
approaching national election has
closed. The Stanford precinct at
Palo Alto received less than the
ordinary number of names, the
total reaching 151. This is due to
the strict enforcement, this year, of
the State law which declares that
no man may gain or loee a resi
dence while attending a university.
Only students that could prove the
University to he their true home
were allowed to register.
