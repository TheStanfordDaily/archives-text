# Debate Preliminaries Arranged.
## 
### 
The executive committee of the
Intersociety Debating League met
this afternoon in room 11. The
subjects of Carnot, Freshman, and
Sophomore preliminaries were
taken up and discussed in full.
The Carnot preliminaries were set
for November 18th, and it was de
cided to excuse from the prelimi
naries any who have before served
as regular members or alternates
of an intercollegiate or Carnot
team. This will excuse 0. C.
Spencer, '05, Alexander Sherriffs,
'05, A. M. Dibble, '05, and W. L.
Blair, '05. It was decided to limit
the number entering the finals to
eight men. However, if a sufficient
number, fifteen or sixteen, do not
enter the preliminaries, there will
be but one try-out, in which all
will participate. All names of
those desirous of entering the Car
not preliminaries must be handed
to A. Sherriffs, '05, before next
Thursday, October 6th.
It seemed to be the consensus of
opinion among those present that a
second debating team was a very
desirable thing, and accordingly
the president was instructed to ap
point a committee who should look
up the second-team matter and re
port next meeting. P. D. Swing, '05,
M. H. Thorpe, '05, and W. L.
Blair, '05, were appointed.
The date of the Freshman try
outs was set for December 2d, and
that for the Sophomore December
3d. All those wishing to enter
these try-outs must hand their
names to their respective presi
dents, the Freshmen to the presi
dent of their debating society, and
the Sophomores to their class presi
dent. No time limit was set for
handing in these names, as the
Freshman-Sophomore contest does
not occur until next semester.
To assist the Freshmen in their
work and encourage their efforts it
was decided to have at least two
men present at each meeting of
their society, to criticise and give
general assistance. P. I). Swing,
'05, and M. 11. Thorpe, '05, were
delegated to be present to-morrow
evening.
