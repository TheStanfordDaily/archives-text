# Junior Women Adopt Hat.
## 
### 
The Junior women met in the
chapel this afternoon at 1:15, and
made their final choice of a class
hat. The vote was unanimously in
favor of a white hat, of smooth felt
and with a rolling brim. A white
leather bund, with the class numer
als stamped in the front, will lend
to the distinctive appearance of the
hat.
A committee consisting of Miss
Jane Spalding, Miss Emma May
ward, and Miss Laura Falk was ap
pointed to ascertain the number of
women desiring the hat, and to at
tend to the purchasing. All those
wishing to procure hats are re
quested to hand their names to any
member of the committee before
Wednesday, October 4th, so that
the order may he sent in by the
end of the week.
At a meetirg of the Sophomore
women held this afternoon it was
decided to drop the question of a
class hat, and wait until next year
before adopting a distinctive em
blem.
