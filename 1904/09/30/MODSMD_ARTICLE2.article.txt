will he preached hy the llev. D.
Charles Gardner. The subject will
be "The Christian Idea of Mar
riage." The morning service will

Lord's Supper.
Attention is called to the fact
that for the present the afternoon

the separate organ recital. Instead
of the two distinct features both
will be combined into one service, so
as to make it a harmonious whole.
Rev. Gardner has given out the
following statement with reference
to certain courtesies that have been
neglected in the past:
" Unhappily the afternoon service
has become seriously disorganized
by late arrivals, habits of irrever
ence, and by the noise caused by
thoughtless visitors retiring from
the church. It is earnestly hoped
that the members of the University
will defend the dignity of these
gatherings in God's house by
prompt attendance, devotional
habits, and by frowning upon preva
lent disorder."
