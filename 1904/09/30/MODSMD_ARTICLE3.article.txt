# SOCIETY OF SIGMA XI.
## History of Its Establishment at Stanford. â€” Its Ideals and Field of Work. 
### 
A conception of the honorary
society or fraternity that stands for
the traditional ideas of liberal cul
ture was recently gained when the
establishment of a local chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa took place.
Usually coexisting with Phi Beta
Kappa and with ideals closely
allied is the scientific honor society,
Sigma Xi. While Phi Beta Kappa
stands for the highest degree of in
tellectual society in the arts and
letters, Sigma Xi maintains this
position in all branches of science.
A local chapter of Sigma Xi was
established at Stanford in 1901, and
the first regular meeting took place
in January, 1902. The history of
Sigma Xi at Stanford has been one
of rapid growth. Beginning less
than three years ago with but thir
teen members, the society has en
larged so that its members now
number tifty-six. Many of this
number are well known throughout
the United States as scientists of
the first rank.
The object of this society, as out
lined in its constitution, is " to
encourage original investigation in
science, pure and applied; by meet
ing for the discussion of scientific
subjects; by the publication of such
scientific matter as may be deemed
desirable; by establishing fraternal
relations among investigators in the
scientific centers; and by granting
the privilege to such students as
have during their college course
given special promise of future
achievement." In the Stanford
chapter up to this time, election to
membership has been based on
actual work done, thus practically
conferring membership to grad
uates. It is possible that a change
in this plan will be made in the
future, but at present none is antici
pated. Besides graduate students
any professor or instructor in the
University who has shown note
worthy achievement as an original
investigator is eligible to active
membership.
The society was established at
Cornell in 1860 by a few earnest
workers in the engineering sciences,
as a means of rallying and encour
aging those qualities which were
deemed of the first importance in
their own lines of investigation. It
soon became broadened and en
larged to represent the general
ideals of highest scholarship in the
minds and before the ambitions of
every earnest student in any branch
of science. There exist at the
present time chapters in nearly all
of the prominent universities of the
United States.
Following is a complete list of
members of Sigma Xi now at Stan
ford, and also of those who were
elected to membership at the Uni
versity, but are not now here:

A conception of the honorary
society or fraternity that stands for
the traditional ideas of liberal cul
ture was recently gained when the
establishment of a local chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa took place.
Usually coexisting with Phi Beta
Kappa and with ideals closely
allied is the scientific honor society,
Sigma Xi. While Phi Beta Kappa
stands for the highest degree of in
tellectual society in the arts and
letters, Sigma Xi maintains this
position in all branches of science.
A local chapter of Sigma Xi was
established at Stanford in 1901, and
the first regular meeting took place
in January, 1902. The history of
Sigma Xi at Stanford has been one
of rapid growth. Beginning less
than three years ago with but thir
teen members, the society has en
larged so that its members now
number tifty-six. Many of this
number are well known throughout
the United States as scientists of
the first rank.
The object of this society, as out
lined in its constitution, is " to
encourage original investigation in
science, pure and applied; by meet
ing for the discussion of scientific
subjects; by the publication of such
scientific matter as may be deemed
desirable; by establishing fraternal
relations among investigators in the
scientific centers; and by granting
the privilege to such students as
have during their college course
given special promise of future
achievement." In the Stanford
chapter up to this time, election to
membership has been based on
actual work done, thus practically
conferring membership to grad
uates. It is possible that a change
in this plan will be made in the
future, but at present none is antici
pated. Besides graduate students
any professor or instructor in the
University who has shown note
worthy achievement as an original
investigator is eligible to active
membership.
The society was established at
Cornell in 1860 by a few earnest
workers in the engineering sciences,
as a means of rallying and encour
aging those qualities which were
deemed of the first importance in
their own lines of investigation. It
soon became broadened and en
larged to represent the general
ideals of highest scholarship in the
minds and before the ambitions of
every earnest student in any branch
of science. There exist at the
present time chapters in nearly all
of the prominent universities of the
United States.
Following is a complete list of
members of Sigma Xi now at Stan
ford, and also of those who were
elected to membership at the Uni
versity, but are not now here:
