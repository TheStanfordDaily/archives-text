# Phi Beta Kappa Meets.

### 
The faculty members of Phi Beta
Kappa met Wednesday at 4:30 in
the Registrar's office to discuss plans
for the future of the local chapter.
The meeting, which was presided
over by Dr. O. L. Elliott, was
largely preliminary in character.
Steps were taken toward the final
issuing of the local charter, which
is expected in a comparatively short
time.
It was decided that the regular
elections of upper-class members
will proceed this year, but the num
ber of eligibles was not determined.
