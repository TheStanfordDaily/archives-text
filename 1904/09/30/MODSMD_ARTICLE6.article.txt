# TENNIS CLUB MEETS.
## Arrangements Made for Interclass Tournament.â€”G.A. Hodge Chosen Captain. 
### 
Last night the Tennis Club held
the second regular meeting of the
semester. At this meeting plans
were discussed for arousing inter
est in tennis. The first important
step in this direction is the plan
for holding an interclass tourna
ment. G. A. Hodge, '06, and A.
Ames, '06, formed the committee to
take action on the interclass tourna
ment, i'lid decided to begin the
tournament to-morrow morning.
The Freshmen, who wish to enter
this tournament, must appear on
the Encina courts at 8:30 tomor
row morning. Drawings for the
singles tournament will take place
on the courts, and after the singles
are completed the doubles will be
played. Every Freshman who en
ters the tournament will be re
quired to pay tennis dues of one
dollar before his name will be
placed on the entry list.
When the singles and doubles
players have been selected to repre
sent the Freshmen in the interclass
tournament, then the Sophomores
will hold a class tournament. Fol
lowing this the Juniors will hold a
tournament; and finally the Seniors
will choose their representatives.
These separate tournaments will be
played off as rapidly as possible.
It is expected that the Freshmen
will finish their tournament to
morrow. The Sophomores, owing
to the large number of entries, will
probably require two days to select
their players. As soon as these
class tournaments are finished the
winners will meet in an interclass
contest. The reason for hastening
these tournaments lies in the fact
that the courts will be oiled again
soon and then play will be impos
sible.
