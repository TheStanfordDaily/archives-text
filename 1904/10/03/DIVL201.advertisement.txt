In Eye Care.
Relief does not come by waiting—
Trouble does.
Defective vision may seem to you a
small thing, but the trouble behind it is
often of such magnitude that unless
promptly and properly attended to the
results may be, and often are, serious.
It will cost you nothing to ascertain just
the condition of your eyes, and by so
doing you may avoid mistakes that
would cause you life-long sorrow and re
gret. Don't wait for trouble to come to
you. Come to us and avoid it.
