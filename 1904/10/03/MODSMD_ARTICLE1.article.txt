# VARSITY DEFEATS OLYMPICS.
## Stanford Eleven Wins an Exciting Game from Olympic Club Team. 
### 
In the best game of the present
season the Varsity defeated the
Olympic Club team on the campus
oval last Saturday by the score of
12-0. Although the final result of
the contest was never in doubt af
ter the first five minutes of play,
the plucky fight of the club men
held the interest until the end of
the game. The excessive heat of
the afternoon bore Heavily on the
untrained Olympics, and they were
much weakened before the end of
the second half.
The game was notable for the
number of long runs made by the
Stanford backs. The most sensa
tional of these was a forty-one-yard
run to a touch-down by Brennan.
The play was started through the
opposing tackle, but the runner was
temporarily stopped by the Olym
pic backs. Assisted by his team
mates Brennan broke loose, and
distancing his pursuers dropped on
the ball directly back of the Olym
pic goal-posts. Stott gained twen
ty-five yards on a quarter-back
run, and Bansbach ran in the ball
through a scattered field for over
thirty-five yards.
The Olympic team played in
belter form than two weeks ago,
but they had the advantage at
only one stage of the game, when
they carried the ball down the
field by bucking the center of the
Varsity line.
The most discouraging feature of
the game was the persistent fum
bling by the Stanford backs. For
tunately the ball was usually re
covered, and the Varsity did not
lose as many yards as they would
had they been opposed by a faster
team.
The line-up was as follows:

In the first few minutes of play
the ball was kept near the center
of the gridiron, but straight- and
cross-bucks by Weller, Trowbridge,
and Chalmers, and the tackle
around formation by Thompson

and Tomasini, placed the ball on
the club men's one-yard line
twelve minutes after the whistle
blew. At this point Weller fum
bled, but Clark fell on the ball
back of the goal-line for a touch
down. Stott kicked the goal, and
the score was 6-0 in favor of Stan
ford. During the remainder of
this half the ball was in Olympic
territory most of the time.
Five minutes after the whistle
blew for the second period Bren
nan crossed the club men's goal
line for the second touch-down.
The goal was kicked by Smith,
making the score 12-0.
The Olympic's goal-line was
again but the weary
club men rallied, and the game
ended with the ball on their forty
yard line.
