# Proposed Mandolin Club.
## 
### 
An effort is being made to or
ganize a mandolin club among the
men who live in Encina Hall.
The new organization will be
known as the Encina Mandolin
Club, and will lead the musical
part of the program at all rallies
held in Encina Hall. There are a
great many men living in Encina
who play the mandolin or guitar,
and it seems that a good club
ought to be formed. In order to
get a list of those who wish to try
for the proposed club, all guitar or
mandolin players who live in En
cina are requested to hand their
names to V. R. Garfias, '06, or J.
W. Rosenfeld, '06.
