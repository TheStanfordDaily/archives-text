# TENNIS TRY-OUTS HELD
## Freshmen Select Their Singles Player for Interclass Tournament. Won by A.R. McSwain. 
### 
The interclass tennis tournament
was begun Saturday morning, when
the Freshmen held their singles
try-outs to select a class representa
tive. Owing to the large number
of '08 entries their tournament was
held first.
This is the first time that an
interclass tennis tournament has
been attempted, and it seems that
the innovation will be successful.
There was a great number of entries
in the Freshman class, and some of
the new men give promise of be
coming Varsity candidates. Some
of the best men in the Freshman
class did not enter the tournament,
but the winner, A. R. McSwain,
showed excellent form.
