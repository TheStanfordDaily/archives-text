# Football Rally Wednesday.
## 
### 
Arrangement are being made for
a football rally to be held Wednes
day night in the chapel from 7:15
to 8. This will be the first rally of
the season, and every effort is being
made to make it a complete suc
cess. The University band will be
present to furnish the music. The
old yells and songs will be re
hearsed, and a number of new ones
are to be tried. It is probable that
there will be but two such rallies
before the Freshman game, and it
is imperative that every student
be present.
