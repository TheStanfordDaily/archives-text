# BEN GREET AT BERKELEY.
## Company Gives Production of Hamlet at University of California. 
### 
Ben Greet opened his season at
the University of California Satur
day, coming directly from Eng
land, with a single stop at Syra
cuse, where two out-door perform
ances of Shakspere were given.
In the Greek theatre at Berkeley
Hamlet was produced in its en
tirety according to the second
Quarto of 1604 and the first Folio
of 1623. As this original text of
the play would occupy something
like six hours if given in the way
Shaksperean plays are usually
presented on the modern stage, the
performance was divided into
two parts, the first half, including
Act 111, Scene 1, being given in
the morning, and the balance in
the afternoon. As no intermis
sions were needed between the
scenes, the total amount of time oc
cupied was about five hours and a
half. At noon there was a period
of an hour during which players
and spectators could enjoy a wel
come rest after the intense heat
from the sun in the morning. Al
though no effort was made to ad
vertise the play in the ordinary
way, more than 3000 people at
tended the performance.
The play was given without
scenery, the severity of the Greek
stage heing relieved only by por
tieres back of the slightly raised
throne platform and by a few
chairs and a table. As a result
the interest was centered entirely
in the actors and the action, and
the ordinary scenery was not
missed. It was surprising how
effective this made the play, giving
it a dignified simplicity.
The part of Hamlet was taken
by Ben Greet himself, who inter
preted the character in his own
artistic way. Mrs. Crawley, who
will be well remembered by Stan
ford people, took the part of Ophelia.
One or two other members of the
old company are also in the troop
this year. But there are a number
of new actors. As the cast of Ham
let is very large.it was necessary to
make use of thirty or forty Cali
fornia students, who were trained
especially for this play. Half a
dozen of them had speaking parts,
and others acted as guards, cour
tiers and sailors. All of the parts,
both of the regular actors and of
the students, were well taken. As
a whole the play was a great suc
cess.
The only other performance of
Hamlet by the Greet company in
this part of the country will be that
given at Stanford on his return
visit in November, when an after
noon and evening will be devoted
to it.
On his way south Mr. Greet will
stop at Stanford Friday, October
21st, for a performance of "Much
Ado About Nothing" in Assembly
Hall. The arrangements for this
are being made by the faculty en
tertainment committee with the co
operation of the English Club.
