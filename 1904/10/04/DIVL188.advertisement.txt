WHOSE HEAD
Aches? Yours? If so what's the cause?
Does a little worry or over-work bring
that tight, sore, uneasy, aching sensa
tion at the base of the brain just back of
the ear? Have you ever thought it
might be due to your eyes? Could we
convince you by removing it with
glaeses? This is one of the eye head
aches so common with those having
pronounced refractive errors. Proper
glasses will correct the defect. The
cause removed the effects disappear.
Why not find out about that headache
of yours? A thorough examination
costs you nothing.
