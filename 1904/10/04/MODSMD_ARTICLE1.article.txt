# ASSEMBLY TO-MORROW.
## Dr. Jordan and Professor Dennis Will Address the Student Body. 
### 
The second University Assembly
of the present semester will be held
in Assembly Hall to morrow morn
ing at 11:15. Dr. Jordan and As
sistant Professor W. C. Dennis of
the Law department will be the
speakers. Both speakers attended
the International Congress of Arts
and Sciences held very recently at
St. Lonis, and this will he the sub
ject of their remarks.
These addresses should be inter
esting, as the gathering of scholars
at St. Louis contained the most
distinguished scientists and literary
men of the world to-day. Besides
these two addresses there will be
the usual yelling and singing. This
is of importance at present, as it is
necessary to get in form for the
Freshman game.
Assistant Professor W. C. Dennis
is one of the new additions to the
Law faculty this lyear. He re
ceived his A. B. from Earlham
College, Indiana, in 1896; he took
an A. B. from Harvard in 1897,
and an A. M.in 1898, and an
LL.B. degree in 1901.
