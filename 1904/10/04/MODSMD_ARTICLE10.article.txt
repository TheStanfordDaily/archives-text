# Football Injuries.

### 
A number of players on both
football squads have suffered from
minor injuries during the past
week, but unless unexpected com
plications ensue none of them will
be kept from practice more than a
week. C. E. Hyde, '05, is suffering
from water on the knee, but if con
ditions are favorable, lie will be
playing again by the end of this
week. West, '06, had the liga
ments in his left knee torn in last
Saturday's game, and tbe injury
will keep him off of tbe gridiron
for at least a week. It is now al
most certain that neither \V. H.
Dole, '05, nor W. K. Roosevelt, '05,
will be out of tbe hospital in time
to try out for places on the Varsity
football team. Although both men
are now practically convalescent,
they will not be permitted to leave
the hospital for two weeks.
Of the Freshman squad, Overman
has a sprained ankle which will
necessitate his temporary retire
ment. from the game. Pemberton,
who had his ankle badly injured
iti tbe Santa Clara game, is recov
ering the use of his leg so slowly
that there is little hope of his again
playing with the Freshman squad.
