# Dr. Jordan's Team Runs Away.
## 
### 
President Jordan and Signor
Brunialti, of the Italian Parlia
ment, who lectured this afternoon
in the chapel, narrowly escaped
meeting with a serious accident this
morning. While on the way to
the quad from the 11:45 train one
of the horses became frightened,
and the team started to run in the
direction of the quad. The driver,
however, managed to avert what
might have been a serious accident
by turning the horses into the oval
lawn in front of the Memorial Arch,
where he finally succeeded in quiet
ing them. Fortunately no one was
hurt, and the only damage done
was to the lawn, which was badly
ploughed up in some places.
