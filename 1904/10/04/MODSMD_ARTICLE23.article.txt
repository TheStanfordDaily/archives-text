In the number of Science which
appeared on August 19th, notice
waß taken of the fact that in both
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia an unusually small number
of degrees of Doctor of Philosophy
have been granted. The writer of
the article pointed out that in the
past seven years but twenty-five
Doctor's degrees had been awarded,

and in comparing this number with
the much greater average which
prevails among the Eastern and
European colleges, was unable to
find any explanation.
In tlie current number of the
magazine Dr. Jordan prints the fol
lowing answer to the problem:
''Among the reasons for this are
two: The authorities of this institu
tion advise their advanced students,
for the sake of breadth of ex
perience, to take part of their work
in the East or in Europe. This is
generally the concluding part. On
the other hand, the California insti
tutions grant few artificial aids to
students as such. At Stanford this
is regarded as a matter of principle,
tuition heing free to graduate stu
dents. By wider introduction of
the trading-stamp system in higher
education, the number of degrees
could he greatly increased, hut with
no gain to science and art."
