—William M. Erb, ex-'Ol, who

football coach this season, is now
helping Coach Morley of Columbia.
—This season's registration on
the Yale football squad is the
smallest it has been for ten years.
Only thiry-five men have turned
out, and the new material is not
promising. The registration at
Harvard is eighty, and at Princeton
seventy.
—Pennsylvania, Columbia and
Cornell have agreed to form a tri
angular debating league. The
league will hold three debates an
nually. These debates will be held
on the same evening, on the same
question, each university being
represented by two teams.
—Yale, Harvard, Columbia, the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the Colorado School of

mer schools of these universities
will work the mine under instruc
tions, doing all the work, from

—It has been proposed at Brown

ond plan, athletics would be regu
larly endowed and members of the
university and the public alike
