# Use of Books in Library.
## 
### 
The daily circulation of hooks in
the University Library indicates a
steady growth. Statistics show that
during the month of September,
1904, 1G,962 hooks were given out
over the loan desk, as against
15,894 during the corresponding
month last year. The numher of
books drawn for home use last
month was 1096.
During the summer vacation the
books on Greek and Latin litera
ture were classified according to the
Dewey decimal system, and author
and subject cards for all of them
may be found in the dictionary
catalogue. The rearrangement of
these two subjects brings all the de
partments of the library under one
system, with the exception of the
works in science, philosophy, and
arts secured before 1902.
