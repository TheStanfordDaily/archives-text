# FRESHMEN VS. BELMONT.
## First-Year Team Will Meet Strong Preparatory School Eleven at Belmont To-morrow. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon the Fresh
man team will meet the Belmont
Military Academy eleven on the
Belmont gridiron. This contest
will probably be a more severe test
for the Freshmen than any of the
preceding preliminary games. The
Belmont team has benefitted by
Lanagan's coaching, and the style
of play employed by both teams
will be very similar.
In anticipation of a hard struggle
the coaches of the Freshman squad
have lined up their charges for hard
scrimmage work this week. Satur
day, before the Varsity game, part
of the squad went through signal
formations under the eye of Coach
Lanagan.
For the first time this season
Horton and Tomasini lined up with
the Freshman team. They played
right and left tackle respectively,
which positions they will undoubt
edly occupy when the '08 team
faces California October 15th.
Cadwalader and Vandervoort
will play the two half-back posi
tions in to-morrow's game, and in
all probability they will occupy the
same places in the intercollegiate
Freshman game. Since Pemberton
is out of the game, the light for the
full - back position lies between
Kocher and Moody. Both men
will play in the game to-morrow.
The contest for the other back
field position is between Fenton and
Kearne, both of whom will be in
the line-up to-morrow. The play
ing of the two quarter-backs in the
Belmont game will probably decide
the contest. Koerner and Wilson
will play the ends to-morrow, but
Overman, who is suffering at pres
ent from a sprained ankle, may dis
place Koerner in the final line-up.
Gay and Meyers will be the
guards to-morrow, and they are
likely to occupy the same positions
October 15th.
Meyers and Coe are fighting hard
for the center position,and Coe will
pass the ball in to-morrow's contest.
