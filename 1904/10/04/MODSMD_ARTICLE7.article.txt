# FIRST FOOTBALL RALLY
## Will be Held in Chapel To-morrow Night.â€”New Songs and Yells. 
### 
The football rally to be held in
the chapel at 7:15 to-morrow night
is planned as an event to break the
spirit of indifference that has per
vaded the University public since
the opening of the football season.
The fact that there will be no cam
pus games until Saturday should
insure the attendance of the whole
student body, since this will be the
only chance to practice concerted
yelling and singing.
The University band will meet
in front of Encina Hall at 7.
After playing several selections, it
will lend the crowd in the march
to the chapel, where the rally will
begin at 7:15. The new songs to
be tried will be printed and dis
tributed on slips at the rally. The
new yells include several parodies
on those used at California, besides
a number of original Stanford pro
ductions. A yell for the Fresh
man class will be selected some
time before the rally. Thus far
there have been but two yells sub
mitted by members of the Fresh
man class, and unless more are
handed in before to-morrow night
the selection will be made from
these two. There seems to be a
great lack of interest* among the
members of the class of '08 about
choosing a yell.
The following is the yell that
will probably be used to-morrow
night:
L! S! J! U!
Rah! Huh! Rah!
Naughty-eight! Stanford!
Rah! Huh! Rah!
Thus far comparatively few
songs and yells have been sub
mitted to the committee. A pro
posed yell to substitute the old
"Hold That Line," is as follows:
Fight 'um, Stanford!
Fight 'um fair! Fight 'um square!
Fight 'um! Fight 'um! Fight'um!
It is probable that several short
speeches will he made during the
evening. The rally will end at 8.
