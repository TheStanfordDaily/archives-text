# CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL
## Ten Men of the Football Squad Placed in Training Quarters. 
### 
Ten members of the University
of California football squad have
been placed on the training-table,
and will have quarters in the
training-house, which has been re
vived this year. From time to
time additional players will be
added to the number, who will eat
and live together until the big
intercollegiate game with Stanford
on November 12th. It is believed
that this policy will improve the
spirit of the team.
The ten men thus far selected
are: Captain Stroud, center; Stern,
last year's full-back, who is now
playing guard; Force and Heit
muller, tackles; Howard, tackle
and end; Oliver, end; Kittrelle,
quarter; Snedigar, Kern and White,
half-backs. The men who have
been playing on the first eleven
but who have not yet been granted
the privilege of the training-table
are: Gray, guard; Henry, end;
Sperry, half-back; Lasater, full
back. These are all varsity possi
bilities, and unless there is a radical
change in the line-up they will be
taken on in a few days.
