A is for ALLâ€”
For none are too wise
To learn something new
About glasaee and eyes.
Tlie public generally <lo not know as
much about their eyes and the proper
use of glasses as is necessary for their
welfare.
All through this month we will print
a series of plain eye talks in an alpha
betical form.
We'will tell about the care of eyes,
their common defects and their correc
tion, and give one or two wimple tests
by means of which you may be able to
get an idea in regard to your own prob
able defect. '
Of course we do this to advertise our
work. We believe that most people
who have defective eyes would be glad
to have them corrected if they were
sure that they were entirely safe from
injury through ignorance or careless
ness.
Our satisfied patients are recommend
ing us to their friends.
If you come to us, WE'LL NOT BE
SATISFIED TILL YOU'RE SATIS
FIED.
