# ASSEMBLY THIS MORNING.
## Dr. Jordan Asks Aid of Students in Putting an End to Thefts. 
### 
The second University Assembly
of the semester was held at the last
hour this morning. The speakers
were President Jordan and Assist
ant Professor W. C. Dennis of the
Law department. The attendance
was unusually large, the Assembly
Hall being well tilled. The occa
sion also marked the reappearance
of the musical clubs at the as
semblies. The clubs gave two stan
zas of "One, Two, Three, Four" so
effectively that they were heartily
encored, and completed the song.
The principal topic of the two
speakers was the recent Inter
national Congress of Arts and
Sciences at St. Louis, to which both
were delegates. Before beginning
his talk, however, Dr. Jordan made
a statement of an unusual kind.
The President said there were two
classes of individuals at Stanford
whom the University did not want,
but whom it was difficult to keep
out. The first of these classes are
called kleptomaniacs. Most of them
are women whose minds are dis
eased. The second class is made
up of those we call plain thieves —
grafters who pick up things that
belong to others. Both classes are
very undesirable in a university
community, Dr. Jordan said. The
insane asylum is the proper place
for the first type, and for the second
the State maintains at great ex
pense another kind of institution
—the penitentiary at San Quen
tin.
Dr. Jordan cited the case of a
young lady who dropped her books
from a carriage to the ground,where
they were picked up and carried off
by some one. He said that if the
books were returned no questions
would be asked, but if they were
not no quarter would be given to
the guilty person if discovered. The
students were urged in their own
interest to help the University in
getting rid of this class of people.
Dr. Jordan's main talk was upon
the importance and significance of
the Congress of Arts and Sciences.
He described the organization of
the convention, and told some in
teresting stories of his personal ex
periences, and of the scholars and
scientists who were gathered to
gether.
Assistant Professor Dennis, who
was secretary of the department of
International Law of the Congress,
gave in a brief manner a number of
interesting sidelights upon the work
of the convention. He paid a tri
bute to the address of Dr. Abbott,
whose subject, "The Fundamental
Conceptions of the Common Law,"
required him to put into a twenty
five minute speech the cogitations of
a life-time. Dennis told something of
what he regarded as the defects of
the congress. He said it was duly
impressed upon the delegates that
they were the 500 wisest men in the
world, and consequently they had
to be careful about what they said
and did.
There were few extemporaneous
speeches, although there were men
present who would have been well
worth while listening to.
