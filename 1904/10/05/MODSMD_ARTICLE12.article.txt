Stanford has never seen a more
active interest in tennis than is
being manifested at the present
time. The series of interclass tour
naments is an excellent thing.
By creating interesting competition
they are bringing out a number of
strong players who might otherwise
have not come into prominence,
and by such competition they are
giving the older players a most un
usual opportunity for valuable
practice. With tennis interests be
ing organized as they now are, the
season will open next semester with
a squad of well-trained players who
will be in better form for the inter
collegiate contest than the tennis
men have been for years past. Too
much encouragement cannot be
given to those tennis enthusiasts
whose energy has developed the
present situation.
