While the words of Dr. Jordan
are still fresh in the mind of the
University public, it is opportune
to call attention to the fact that
several sweaters and jerseys have
been taken from the side lines and
other parts of the football field by
persons other than the rightful
owners. It is hard to believe that
any member of the University
would carry off the sweater of a
football player who happens to be
hurriedly called into thu game
without having time to place his
possessions in safe keeping. The
fact remains true, however, that
several instances of this kind have
occurred recently ; whether the
guilty parties are strangers is not
known, but it is to be hoped
that they are in no way connected
with Stanford. Hut, be that as it
may, it becomes the duty of all visi
tors to the oval to keep this matter
in mind, and if any acts of the kind
are viewed with even slight sus
picion by anyone, an inquiry into
the case can at least bring harm to
no honest person, and may do great
good toward the apprehension of
the offenders.
