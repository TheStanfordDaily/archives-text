# California Freshmen Win.
## 
### 
The football game yesterday be
tween the University of California
freshmen and the Oakland high
school eleven resulted in a victory
for the former by a score of G-5.
The freshmen were able to make
gains, but fumbled often, and this
discounted their work. Two weeks
ago the California first-year eleven
defeated Oakland 6-0, and a week
ago the Stanford Freshmen de
feated the same team 16-0.
