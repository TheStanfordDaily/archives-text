A copy of the Codex Magliabec
chiano XIII, 3 Manuscrit. Mexi
cain Post-Colombien has been re
ceived at the Museum, the present
of the Due de Loubat of Paris.
The Due de Loubat is a member of
the famous French Institute. He
lias manifested considerable inter
est in Stanford, and at various
times has presented the Museum
with copies of his published re
searches. The Codex Magliabec
chiano XIII 3 is the result of his
latest investigations among the
Mexican manuscripts in the
national library of Florence. The
volume contains principally a di
gest of the illustrations and notes
pertaining to natural history,
music, materia medica, religious
rites, and symbolic patterns as
shown in the ancient Mexican and
Aztec manuscripts. The book con
tains a great many facsimiles of
these, printed in their original col
ors; and the striking and elabor
ate color combinations and designs
brought out are characteristic of
the work of these Indians. A com
plete record in thus given in pic
tures of the habits of the people,
their customs and manners, their
ideals, and their conceptions of
art, religion, and science. Though
the printed explanations are all in
Italian, the work is of much inter
est, through its graphic illustra
tions, from an archeological stand
point.
