# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Varsity Candidates Engage in Scrimmage Work.—Freshmen in Light Signal Practice. 
### 
At football practice last evening
Coach Lanagan divided the Var
sity candidates into first, second,
and third squads, according to the
present merit of the players. The
personnel of these squads will be
subject to daily revision according
to the degree of improvement
which the individual players may
show.
In the regular preliminary drill
in blocking, kicking, and catching
punts both the Varsity and the
Freshman squads showed some im
provement. The backs and the
ends are using better judgment in
the running-in of the punts. Most
of the punting for the Varsity was
done by Weller, Bogle, ami Toma
sini, while that for the Freshmen
was by Sumner, Cadwallader, Fen
ton, and Franklin. In falling on
the ball the Freshmen particularly
must improve very materially if
they are not to he placed at a big
disadvantage in the game. "The
work at the tackling-bag is some
better, though many persist in
tackling too high.
The first and second Varsity
teams were lined up according to
rank and engaged in scrimmage
for twenty-five minutes. Follow
ing was the line-up:

Lachmund and Hyde are both
out of the game at center and are
unable to go on the squad again
this season. Accordingly Shields
has been taken from his place at
tackle and is being tried for center.
His passing of the ball, especially
for kicks, was at times erratic, on
account of a lack of familiarity
with the position. Weller'n work
on several bucks was up to his old
time form, and Crow did good work
at righ thalf. Bogle is playing a
good consistent game at full.
But the team work as a whole
lacks snap and coherence. Both
lines were weak. The second team
line especially was unable to hold.
The first team advanced down the
field by line bucks for a touch
down without losing the ball. The
Varsity lost the ball several times
on fumbles, and the backs showed
a lack of familiarity with the sig
nals which resulted two or three
times in their being thrown back
for a loss.
The two Freshman teams lined
up for signal practice, but did not
engage in scrimmage. Their play
ing is still ragged, and they show a

painful slowness in lining up after
a down.
The rooting showed considerable
improvement. The bleachers were
well filled, and there was more in
terest manifested in the yelling
than at any previous practice this
year. The leaders are overcoming
their former inability to lead in
unison. Several new yells were
tried which, if practiced diligently,
will be able to do good work at the
Freshman game.
