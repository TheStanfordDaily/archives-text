# SIGNOR BRUNIALTI LECTURES.
## Speaks in the Chapel on Ancient and Modern Rome.—Stereoscopic Views. 
### 
The chapel was crowded to over
flowing yesterday afternoon by stu
dents to hear the Hon. Atilie
Brunialti, the distinguished Italian
statesman. Signor Brunialti has
been attending the St. Louis Expo
sition, where he was one of the
honorary vice-presidents of the
Congress of Arts and Sciences, and
is now making a tour of the coun
try. The subject of his discourse
was Rome, as it is and as it was.
With the aid of stereopticon views
Signor Brunialti was able to give a
very graphic description of that
famous city.
The views embraced scenes of
famous ruins, modern buildings,
restorations, copies of noted paint
ings, and reproductions of sculp
tural art. Each of the pictures, as
it was thrown upon the screen, was
fully explained by the speaker, who
gave the history, statistics, and
other information with which it
was concerned. The photographs
were exceptionally good, and the
collection included, among others,
the following:
Of modern Rome —Panoramic
views of the city, St. Peter's, the
Tiber, the Palatine, views from the
dome of St. Peter's, ruins of the
walls of the first city, excavations
on the site of the old Forum, the
new Imperial Forum, the Imperial
University, the Temples of Ves
pasion and of the Tribuna, the
Temple of Caesar and the site of

In art there were a great many
reproductions of masterpieces by
Michael Angelo, Reubens, and other
old masters. These included scenes
from the Bible, madonnas, and
other conceptions, found in the gal
leries of the Vatican, on the walls
of St. Peter's, and elsewhere. The
works of sculpture are of the Apollo,
Juno, Jupiter, Laocoiin, the Three
