# Boat Club Meets.
## 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club met last
night to hear the report of several
committees and discuss other im
portant business. The attendance
was so small that it was not con
sidered advisable to act on the
questions before the meeting. A
meeting will be held next Thurs
day to consider the same business,
and a full attendance is desired.
