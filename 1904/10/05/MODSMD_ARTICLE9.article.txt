# Basket-Ball Practice.
## 
### 
Much interest is being manifested
in the basket-ball practices, which
are being held twice a week on the
Roble courts. The time of the sec
ond practice has been changed from
Wednesday to Thursday at 4:45.
The try-out for membership in the
squad is still in progress, and the
captain feels well satisfied with the
material which is constantly being
brought out. All who are inter
ested in the game, and who have
not been out to any of the practices,
are especially urged to be out to
morrow afternoon.
