Bis for blindness,
A terrible thing.
Neglect oft contributes
This evil to bring.
Beside those cases in which blindness
is caused by accident, nearly all people
who lose their sight do so through
neglect.
Some little trouble or defect is let go
011, hoping against hope that nature
will overcome it.
The most common cause of partial or
total blindness among aged people is
cataract. In a large majority of cases
cataract is found in eyes that have some
defect which has never been properly
corrected. Many people who have cat
aract boast that they never had to use
glasses till they were fifty or even sixty
years old; and this very fact that they
have abused and neglected their eyes at
the time when help was first needed
probably gave rise to the condition in
which they now find themselves.
We don't cure or remove cataracts. In
fact we can do nothing for those who are
blind from any cause.
We do fit glasses to protect and pre
serve the sight, remove strain, and give
the best possible vision.
Eyes that need attention now will
never need it less till they get it.
See us and see right.
