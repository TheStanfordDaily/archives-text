The protest that has been
brought against the eligibility of
M. A. Cadwalader to play on the
Freshman football eleven, and the
reasons urged by the University of
California, should be well consid
ered by both institutions before an
interpretation of the intercollegiate
agreement is finally decided upon.
An interpretation such as has been
asked by the University of Cali
fornia will fxclude from the ath
letic teams of both universities
many first-rate athletes, and while
the large majority of such men
would probably come from Cali
fornia, that fact should not influ
ence Stanford in passing judgment.
The essential question in the mat
ter would seem to be whether or
not the granting of eligibility to men
from preparatory departments of
other colleges will work contrary to
the spirit that is desired in inter
collegiate athletics. We do not be
lieve that it will. It is difficult to
see good reasons for shutting out
men who attend merely the pre
paratory departments of other col
leges. Even if an achdemic athlete
does participate in a contest along
with men from the collegiate de
partment, that should not debar
him, because the institution then
represented is not alone the college
but rather a combination of the
college and the preparatory school.
There is nothing in the intercol
legiate agreement which says that
a man in a preparatory school de
partment and playing on such a
combination team shall not be
eligible to compete during his first
year at Stanford or at California.
The present case is that of a man
who comes, not from another col
lege of standing, but from a pre
paratory school which holds no
higher rank than any high school
or academy in the State. It is
true that the candidate has par
ticipated in athletics along with
athletes from the college depart
ment of Pomona College,but he did
so as a representative of the com
bined institutions and not as a
representative of the college. He
could not have represented the col

lege proper for he was never con
nected with it. And so it would
seem that there is not good ground
for the protest, and that any inter
pretation of the intercollegiate
agreement such as has been pro
i posed can not be justifiably urged.
