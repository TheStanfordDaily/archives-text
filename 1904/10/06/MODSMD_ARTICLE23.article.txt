# CADWALADER IS PROTESTED.
## California Cites Fact that He Was Member of Pomona College Track Team. 
### 
Colonel George Edwards?, chair
man of the faculty athletic com
mittee of the University of Califor
nia, has formally protested the eli
gibility of M. A.Cadvvalader to play
on the Stanford Freshman team.
Colonel Edwards bases his protest
upon that clause of the intercol
legiate agreement which says that
students from another institution
of collegiate rank shall not take
part in intercollegiate contests un
til they have been at the institu
tion to which they come for one
year. It is understood that Colonel
Edwards holds Cadwalader to have
been a student in Pomona College,
as evidenced bv the fact that he
was a member of the track team
which represented the college in the
meet with Stanford last April.
It is believed here tbat Califor
nia's protest is not well founded,
and that Cadwalader will not be
kept out of the intercollegiate game
beciuse of it. Cadwalader was
never a student in Pomona College
proper, but took work in the pre
paratory department of the college.
All his credits come from that de
partment, and he enters Stanford
as an ordinary Freshman, with no
advanced standing whatever. The
fact that he was a member of the
Pomona College track team is not
regarded as important. In all
small colleges where the amount of
athletic material available is small
little cognizance is taken of the line
between the advanced and prepara
tory departments. A case similar
to Cadwalader's was that of W. P.
Magee, ex-'O(5, who came to Stan
ford from the preparatory depart
ment of Santa Clara College. The
University of California raised a
question as to his eligibility, but
did not press it far, and Magee
played on the Freshman team and
later on the Varsity. The stand
taken by the Stanford faculty com
mittee on athletics then, and the
stand taken now, is that the clause
of the intercollegiate agreement un
der which Colonel Edwards makes
the present protest applies only to
students who come from the ad
vanced departments of another col
legiate institution, and not to those
who come from a preparatory de
partment attached thereto.
The fact that this question has
been raised again by the Univer
sity of California may result in a
new and important interpretation
of the portion of the intercollegiate
agreement referred to. It is under
stood that in answering Colonel
Edwards' protest Dr. Angell has
asked him whether California
wishes to keep out of athletics for
one year all men who come from
another college, regardless of
whether they come from the ad
vanced or from the preparatory de
partments. Such a policy is not
regarded as especially just or de
sirable, but if California desires to
put this new interpretation upon
the rule, it is stated that Stanford
will agree to it. This course would
affect California much more seri
ously through the loss of men than
it would Stanford, and it is not
considered probable that Colonel
Edwards will favor it.
