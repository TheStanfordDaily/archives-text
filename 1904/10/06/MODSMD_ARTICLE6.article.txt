# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Varsity Men Line Up for Scrimmage. Frequent Fumbles and Ragged Plays. 
### 
The Varsity squad engaged in
practice at blocking punts and
breaking up interference yesterday
afternoon, followed by a twenty
five-minute scrimmage between the
first and second teams. The ab
sence of the Freshmen left the en
tire field to the use of the Varsity
men, which enabled them to move
with much more freedom than
heretofore.
Some time was devoted to drill
in heeling the ball and in practic
ing the kick-off. In this Toma
si 11 i and Stott showed up particu
larly well, sending the ball at
times fifty yards. Tomasini
placed-kicked two goals from the
thiity-five-yard line. The men are
still fumbling the ball badly. Yes
terday's practice was unusually
poor in this regard. This was
partially due, however, to a strong
wind blowing across the field. The
interference formation is slowly
improving in the running-in of
punts. The second team line was
unable to hold, and the first team
men broke through for big gains.
Twice they blocked kicks of the
second team.
Sensational features of the scrim
mage work were two runs by Stott,
one of seventy yards for a touch
down and the other of twenty
yards. In the first, Chalmers did
good interference. In the second,
Shields did great work at center in
helping to drag the formation
through the entire second team.
Captain Clark did some good
tackling. Bansbach was slightly
injured before the scrimmage so he
did not go into the game.
