# SIX TO SIX.
## Freshmen Play an Even Game Against Belmont Military Academy. 
### 
In a slow, evenly contested game
on the Belmont gridiron yesterday
the Freshman team tied the eleven
from the military school by the
score of G to 6. The two touch-downs
were made early in the first half,
and the prospects for a fast game
were good, but during the rest of
the game both teams seemed more
intent on protecting their respective
goals than in advancing the ball.
The defensive work of both teams
was ragged, but the play of the
Freshmen in this respect was worse
than their preparatory school op
ponents. Some inexcusable fum
bles were made by the '08 team at
critical periods of the game.
The effect of Reid's coaching was
apparent in the Harvard system of
play used by the Belmont team.
The cross-buck outside of tackle
was used to good advantage by both
teams, and both touch-downs were
made by this play. The Belmont
backs made many yards around the
right end, where the Freshmen ap
peared particularly weak. Fre-
penalties were imposed on
the Freshmen for off-side plays
and holding in the line. The '08
team has been guilty of these faults
in other games, and if the defect is
not corrected before the day of the
contest with California the Fresh
men may suffer the loss of many
yards.
In the Freshman back-field Van
dervoort, Cadwalader and Moody
did the best work, and Corbett and
Miller were the star backs for the
Belmont eleven.
In the punting duel which ter
minated the game, although kick
ing against the wind, Fenton ex
celled his Belmont opponent.
The line-up was as follows:

the line, and the goal was kicked.
Score, Freshman 6, Belmont 6.
The Belmont goal was again threat
ened in this half, but no further
scoring was done.
Freshmen kicked off in the sec
ond half, and Corbett ran the ball
in 10 yards. A fake kick netted
20 yards for Belmont. Stanford
then held their opponents for
downs, and the rest of the second
half was devoted to a punting duel,
with the Freshmen getting slightly
the better of the contest.
