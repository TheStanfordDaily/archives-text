away from the tender, solicitous care
of Mother—at school—studying hard,
exercising harder, accidents will some
times happen. If at home, mother
would use Pond's Extract—the old family
doctor— and the pain would soon vanish
—the injury soon heal. For over liO
years mothers have eased pains and
healed wounds, burns and bruises with
Pond's Extract and have never been
disappointed In it. There is no remedy
which will take its place—no substitute.
Keep a bottle bandy for
quick use. Soothes and

Pond's Extract—has no
medicinal value—is
positively worthless.
Pond's Extract CUKES,
therefore is priceless.
Sold only in sealed bot
tles under buff icrupper.
