# VARSITY VS. INDIANS.
## Stanford Will Meet Eleven From Sherman Institute To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon the Varsity
football team will play the Indian
eleven from the Sherman Institute,
on the campus oval. Last week the
Indians were defeated by the Cali
fornia varsity by the score of 6 to 0
in a hard contest which was not al
together to the advantage of the
State University team. The Indian
eleven will be strengthened by the
addition of the famous Carlisle full
back, Williams, who did not arrive
on the Coast soon enough to partici
pate in the game against California.
He lined up for the first time with
the Indians this afternoon during
their short practice period on the
campus gridiron. Williams played
full-back on the Carlisle Indian
team and made a good record as a
line-plunging back. This year he
was attending Northwestern Uni
versity and expected to play with
the football team of that institu
tion. Recently, however,he changed
his mind and came to California to
enroll himself in the Sherman -In
stitute. Williams' arrival is fortu
nate for the Indians, as Schoulder,
who played against California, was
so badly injured in that game that
he will be unable to play again for
some time.
The Sherman squad, consisting
of twenty-one members, arrived on
the campus this forenoon, and are
now domiciled at various fraternity
houses. Early this afternoon the
squad putin an hour on tlie oval
going through fast signal work un
der the direction of Coach Warner,
brother of the former Carlisle
coach.
The Indian team will average
169 pounds to the man, while the
Varsity will probably weigh a few
pounds more. Coach William
Warner, the Cornell guard, captain
and member of the All-American
team, has succeeded in developing
a formidable team from the forty
men who compose the Sherman
squad. Their defeat last Saturday
at the hands of California was due
in a large measure to the lightness
of the line, which could not with
stand the 'plunges of the heavy
State University backs.
Nefus, who will do the punting
for the Indians, has the reputation
of being one of the best punters on
the Coast. He formerly played
with the Chemawa Indian team,
which met both varsities last sea
son.
The line-up of the two teams for
the first kick-off will be as follows:
STANFORD SHERMAN INSTITUTE
Clark (c) 1 e r (c) Boles
Thompson 1 tr Lubo
Van Sickle. . . .1 g r. . . . Blacktooth
Shields c Saunders
Monzingo r g 1 Albanez
Tomasini r t 1 Lugo
Smith r e 1 Tortes
Stott q Nefus
Chalmers 1 hr Magee
Trowbridge. , .. r h 1 Payne
Weller 112 Williams
The line-up of the Sherman In
dians is little changed from the
team which faced Stanford in the
Thanksgiving game last year. On

that occasion the Varsity was vic
torious by a score of 18 to 0, but
there is small probability of any
such score being made in the game
to-morrow. The Varsity will go
into the game severely crippled by
the loss of several good men, who
are out of the game on account of
injuries. It is not probable that
Lanagan will put more than twen
ty-two men into the game Satur
day.
The officials will be as follows:
H. C. Hamilton, referee; Major
Collins, umpire; C. Searles and
Van Kirk, timekeepers; Schoulder
and Sprott, linesmen.
