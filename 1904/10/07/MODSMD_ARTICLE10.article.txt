When a football team or any
other organization comes to the
Stanford campus to compete against
our representatives, its members
are our guests and as such they
are entitled to every privilege that
we can extend to them. It is noth
ing more than ordinary courtesy to
allow a visiting football team full
possession of the oval to practice
signals and formations away from
the view of inquisitive specta
tors. That we are compelled to
say that the Sherman Indians were
not given that courtesy to-day un
til, at their request, the bleachers
were cleared, is a matter to be re
gretted. We are here to treat our
guests hospitably and not to pry
into their style of football playing,
or even to lead them to think that
we want to see what they are doing
on the field; and the best way to
show that we have a slight idea of
what common courtesy is, and at
the same time to make a favorable
impression with our guests, is to
sta)' off the field and away from
Encina Hall windows when a
visiting team is practicing on
the gridiron. There are several
other teams that will be here this
season for visits of a few days, and
it is to be hoped that when they
come they will be allowed to have
the oval to themselves, and not be
compelled to Bhare it during prac
tice with a number of people who do
not know their proper place.
