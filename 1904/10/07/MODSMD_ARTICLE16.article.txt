# Improvements at Fire House.
## 
### 
The effectiveness of the new fire
house is being enhanced by the
construction of a solid gravel road
which will directly connect the
back of the station with the side
street, some fifty feet in the rear.
As the back of the fire house is
equipped with large doors similar
to those in front, the new road will
make it possible to take the fire
apparatus out this way. In case
of fire in the eastern portion of the
campus, much time will be saved.
A new alarm system has been es
tablished in the fire station itself.
By means of a switch placed down
stairs, it is possible for the watch
man to throw on all the lights and
ring a large gong in the sleeping
apartments of the men, in an in
stant. The men who are living in
the house have greatly improved
their living quarters. By the aid
of a heavy curtain the sleeping
apartment has been divided off
from the remainder of the main
room. A large table, chairs, etc.,
have been placed here, and the
men are using it as a study and
lounging room. The other room
is soon to be fixed up as a library.
