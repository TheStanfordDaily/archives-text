Cis for careful,
Conscientious, correct, —
The examination we give
You, your eyes to protect.
Those who find it necessary to have
their eyes examined often hesitate to do
so for varions reasons.
Some hate to go to an optician for fear
he will tell them they must wear
glasses, regardless of conditions.
Again, they may have heard of people
who have tried to wear glasses and
found them of little or no benefit.
Sometimes dread of the examination
stands in the way. Perhaps a friend
whose eyes were examined was unable
to use them for several days on account
of the drug used to dilate the pupil.
None of these reasons need deter you
from coming to us.
We won't tell you to wear glasses
unless you really need them.
We won't fit you with glasses that do
you no good, for if we did our guarantee
of "entire satisfaction" would justify
their return.
We won't put anything into your
eyes.
We give a careful, conscientious, cor
rect examination which uncovers every
defect of vision.
We correct these defects with perfectly
ground and accurately centered lenses.
Careful, conscientious, correct exam
ination free.
