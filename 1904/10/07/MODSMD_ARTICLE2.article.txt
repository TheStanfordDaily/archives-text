# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.

Scrimmage by Varsity Squad.—Sig
nal Practice by Freshmen.—Sev
eral Men Injured.
There were no new developments
at the football practice yesterday
afternoon. Considerable time was
devoted to the regular preliminary
drill. Major Collins of Belmont
was on the field and assisted in the
punting. For the Varsity squad
Macdonald, Bogle, and Weller did
the kicking, and for the Freshmen
Kenton, Sumner, and Franklin.
The Varsity did better work at
running in the ball, but the Fresh
men are still fumbling badly.
Last night's practice was the poor
est exhibition of falling on the
ball by the Freshmen this season.
The two Freshman teams were run
through light signal practice, but
did not engage in scrimmage. They
are developing more speed, and are
slightly faster in lining up after
downs.
A number of men on the Varsity
squad were absent from the field
yesterday, including Bansbach,
Stott, Lane, Tomasini, and Thomp
son. During the line-up between
the first and second teams both
Chalmers and Brennan were in
jured and had to leave the field.
The first team's work was charac
terized by breaking through their
opponents' line consistently for
gains.
Following was the line-up of the
two teams:

The rooting continues to improve.
The yelling is good, but the singing
is still weak. Printed sheets con
taining several new songs were dis
tributed on the bleachers, and it is
hoped that by this means a new
stimulus may be given to the prac
tice of this branch of the rooting.
