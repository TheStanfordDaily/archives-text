# Will Present Play.

### 
At a meeting of the Stanford
Boat Club last night it was decided
to give a play under the auspices
of the club. The play has not been
chosen, but it will be in the nature
of a comedy. A committee com
posed of L. L. Carter, '06, It. H.
Gardner, '07, N. P. Bryan, '07, F.
W. Turner, 'OS, and M. M. Stearns,
'00, chairman, was appointed to
make the selection of a play. The
talent for the parts will be taken
from the college at large. Members
of Sword and Sandals have already
signified their willingness to take
part. The play will be given on
the evening of December 2d.
Several plans were proposed by
club members for raising the re
quired money for the purchase of a
shell. For a time it was consid
ered probable that the Sophomore
class would give a play for the
benefit of the club. After consid
erable discussion the club members
deemed it advisable to give the
play themselves.
