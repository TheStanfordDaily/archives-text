# Football Song Competition.
## 
### 
The competition for the prize
football songs and yells is not pro
gressing as favorably as the com
mittee desires. Some twenty songs
have been handed in, but only one
or two come up to the standard set
last year. The committee is par
ticularly anxious that Stanford
words be written to such spirited
songs as "Dixie," "Maryland, my
Maryland," and "Old Zip Coon."
The yell competition is in about
the same condition. Some of the
new yells have been tried out on
the bleachers at football practice,
and there is plenty of room for im
provement. The contest will close
next Tuesday, when the prizes of
$10 and $5 for the songs,and the $5
prize for the best yell will be
awarded. The committee urges
every man and woman in the Uni
versity to get down to work and
endeavor to turn out a song or yell
that will be a credit to the Univer

sity. Contributions to be handed
in to M. H. Thorpe, '05, A. L. j
Trowbridge, '05, or A. W. Hooper,
'05.
The song-book will be published
about the first of November.
