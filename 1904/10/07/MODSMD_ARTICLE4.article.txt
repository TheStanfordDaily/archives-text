### 
Beginning next Monday morn
ing eighteen players of the Var
sity football squad will be put
on training fare at the Stanford
Inn. Trainer Moulton has pre
pared the bill-of-fare, which will be
rigidly enforced. An effort, how
ever, will be made to relieve the
usual monotony of training fare by
a large variety of dishes which
have been recommended for the
athletes. The names of the men
who will be privileged to gather
around the training-table have not
yet been announced, but it is prob
able that the playing of the Var
sity candidates in the Sherman
Indian game to-morrow will great
ly influence the final selection.
Manager Barrett announces that
tickets for the intercollegiate Fresh
man game will be put on sale Mon
day. The sale will commence Mon
day, and tickets may be purchased
on the quad or at the Bookstore.
Some difficulty is being experi
enced by Manager Barrett in an
effort to secure a game for the
Freshmen next Tuesday. Early
in the season tentative plans were
made with Polytechnic high school
of San Francisco for a game on
that date, but the schedule of the
Academic League will prevent them
from playing. At present Barrett
is negotiating with Santa Clara
College and the Berkeley high
school, but no definite arrange
ment with either team has yet been
made.
