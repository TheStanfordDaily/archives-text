# BASEBALL OUTLOOK POOR.
## But Four of Last Season's Varsity Nine Have Returned to College. 
### 
At the close of last season it
looked as if Stanford would have a
veteran baseball team to represent
her in 1905, but of the ten men
who played against California last
April but four are at present in
college. These men are Captain A.
L. Trowbridge, '05, D. D. Sales, '06,
J. H. Colbert, '06, and A. J. Chal
mers, '07. The other Varsity men
who have not returned to college
this semester are R. B. Ball, ex-'O4,
R. B. Knight, '04, \V. E. Tritch,
ex-'O4, W. W. Wirt, ex-'Oft, R. A.
Williams, ex-'OG, and I. Swain,
ex- ! 07.
Of these six members of last
year's team who are not at college
at present it is probable that several
may return in the spring. It is ex
pected that Swain will be back,
and it is possible that Wirt and
Ball again may aid the nine. In
case these men putin an appear
ance Stanford will have the nucleus
for a strong team, but at pres
ent the outlook is far from
bright.
Chalmers, who played left field
on the team, is the only outfielder
in college. In the infield the sec
ond base, third base, and the
catcher positions are vacant. It
will be a serious problem to fill
these places with good men, for with
a very few exceptions the substi
tutes of last year, though average
fielders, were poor batters. There
is always the possibility of the
Freshman class furnishing valuable
men to the team, but past experi
ence has shown that it is an un
usual thing when more than two
men of the entering class make the
Varsity.
Although the situation looks as
though fall practice would be ad
visable, it is improbable that prac
tice will be engaged in until toward
the last of the semester, if at all.
The cause of this arises from the
fact that both Trowbridge and
Chalmers, beside many second team
men, are playing foot ball The men
will not have any one to take them
in hand and advise them during
the fall, as Cowden did last season,
and the regular coach will not be
selected until next spring.
At California the canditates for
the freshman baseball team are
practicing preparatory to the first
intercollegiate Freshman baseball
game next semester. The Fresh
man baseball candidates at Stan
ford will probably be taken in
charge by some Varsity player, aft
er the Freshman football game has
taken place. The intercollegiate
Freshman baseball game will be
played on the Stanford campus
next spring, and will alternate each
year thereafter between the two
universities.
