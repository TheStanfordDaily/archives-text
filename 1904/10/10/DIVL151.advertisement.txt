Dis for darkness,
The absence of light.
Are you groping in darkness
In regard to your sight?
Many people go on day after day
groping in darkness who might easily
know pist the condition and need of
their own eyes. They prefer to take the
advice of their neighbor, who says,
"Put off wearing glasses just as long as
possible, for if you once put them on
you will always have to wear them."
Possibly you will. What of it?
Isn't the fact that you must wear them
positive proof that you need them?
Hundreds of eyes are injured by not
wearing glasses when first needed. "The
sooner the better in eye care."
We examine your eyes, tell you all
about their needs, and tit them with
right glasses if glasses are necessary.
The examination is free, the price of
glasses reasonable.
We believe you'll remember the qual
ity long after the price is forgotten.
