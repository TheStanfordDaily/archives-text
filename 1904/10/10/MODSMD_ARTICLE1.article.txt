a unanimous vote. The title of
the piece is "A Corner Knocked
Off."
The plot is purely local, depict
ing with slight exaggeration well
known features of Stanford life.
The plot is definite enough to hold
the attention from start to finish,
so that the interest of the specta
tors will not lag, and there is a great
deal of good-natured raillery inter
spersed throughout the piece. There
will be eighteen characters in the
cast. The play will be divided into
two acts and several scenes.

features of the show. Of the eight
songs almost all will be distinctly
Stanford in spirit, and ones that
will be likely to live and be passed
on. They all tend to strengthen
the traditions that are recognized
as great factors for good in Stan
ford life. The music is original
and very catchy. There are two
choruses and two trios which will
be given with song and dance.

ments made, rehearsals will be be
