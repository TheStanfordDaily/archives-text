C. E. Hyde, who is suffering from
an injured knee, is rapidly improv
ing, and will probably appear on
the gridiron again this week. F.
Lane, '05, injured his shoulder so
badly in practice last week that he
will be unable to play again this
season.
G. E. Dole, '07, who played half
back on the Freshman team, and
was substitute half-back on the
Varsity, appeared on the gridiron
Monday for the first time this year.
W. H. Dole, '05, and W. K.
Roosevelt, '05, are both out of the
hospital, and the first named will
appear on the football field in a few
days. Roosevelt has not decided to
try out for the Varsity, but there is
a bare possibility that his name
may appear in a Varsity line-up
befere the end of the season.
A. E. Preston, '05, who played
end on the 1901 team, is in college,
and will try for his old position.
