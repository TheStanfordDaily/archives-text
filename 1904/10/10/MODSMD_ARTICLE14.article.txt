If the results of the football games |
played last Saturday nt California
and Stanford are taken as an in
dication of the present strength of
the two varsity elevens, the odds j
are very great against us. Stanford j
was overwhelmingly defeated by a
team that lost to California one
week before. The small score made
by the Indians is out of all propor
tion to their superiority over our
team. Furthermore, we have had
an additional week of practice since
California defeated the same team,
and for that reason should be
stronger. Moreover,the Indians have
had no opportunity for advantage
ous practice since they met Califor
nia, and the only way in which
they could be regarded as more
formidable than they were a week
ago is by the addition of Williams,
but as he was rendered useless for
offensive work early in the game
little can be attributed to him as a
cause of additional strength. On
the other hand, California's strong
est line-up scored two toucn-downs
in the first half of the game against
theOlympic Club eleven. Stanford's
best line-up was able to score but
one touch-down in the same length
of time one week before. It is very
true that too much faith ought not
be placed in comparative scores,
but even when full allowances are
made these results do not give a
brilliant outlook for Stanford. On
the other hand, they show very
clearly that California, at the pres
ent time, can put much the stronger
team into the field, and if the var
sity game were to be played next
Saturday instead of four weeks
from then, the Cardinal would have
no hope of winning. The game is
now less than five weeks off. There
has got to be a great change, and
that change must come quickly, or
the class of 1905 will never have seen
a winning intercollegiate contest.
The spirit this year is not what it
should be. The players are not re
ceiving the support that should be
given them. The rooting is gener
ally conceded to be worse than it

has been for at least three years.
When the yells were given last
Saturday, one end of the rooting
section invariably had a handicap
on the other end. But one new
song was tried and that one fell
flat. The remedies for the present
situation would seem to lie, first, in
a general laying aside of the spirit
of over-confidence which has been
evident on the gridiron since the
season opened; and in more fre
quent and more thorough practices
by a greater body of rooters than
have yet been out regularly.
