# CADWALADER ELIGIBLE.
## Freshman Half-back from Pomona Will Enter the Game Next Saturday. 
### 
Word has been received from
Professor George Edwards, chair
man of the faculty athletic com
mittee of the University of Cali
fornia, stating that the objections
to the eligibility of M. A. Cadwala
der to play on the Stanford Fresh
man team will not be urged. Cad
walader will therefore be able to
play in the intercollegiate Fresh
man game next Saturday.
The intention of California to
protest Cadwalader was based on
the fact that he was a member of
the Pomona track team last spring.
Although a member of the track
team of that institution, he was
not a student in the college proper,
but took work in the preparatory
department of the institution. He
enters Stanford with no advance
standing from Pomona, but with
the ordinary entrance credits from
the preparatory department. The
protest against his eligibility was
based on the understanding that
he had been a member of Pomona
College proper. When it was
pointed out by the Stanford ath
letic committee that he was simply
a member of the preparatory de
partment the objections were with
drawn. The whole affair arose
through a lack of information on
California's part regarding the
standing of the Freshman player.
In replying to California's pro
test, Dr. Angell asked whether or
not the California authorities
wished to bar from athletics for one
year all men who come from an
other college regardless of whether
they come from advanced or pre
paratory departments. It was not
thought that California would wish
to inaugurate such a policy, since
it would seriously affect her through
the loss of men. The failure of the
California committee to press the
objections against Cadwalader is
considered as indicating California's
position in regard to the matter.
