# California Defeats Olympics.
## 
### 
The University of California foot
ball team defeated the eleven from
the Olympic Club on the new Cali
fornia gridiron by a score of 10
to 0. Both touch-downs were
scored in the first half, and no
goals were kicked. After the game
a member of the Olympic team who
i6 also a former Stanford Varsity
man declared that California pos
sesses the fastest back-field seen on
this Coast for several years. He
further said that the State Univer
sity line is much better than the
line last year, and far superior to
the Stanford line this season. The
player quoted above has faced both
varsities this year, and he ex
pressed the opinion that California
is certainly one, and perhaps two,
touch-downs better than Stanford
at the present date.
