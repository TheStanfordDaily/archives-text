## Dr. Gardner Speaks on Faithfulness to One's Spiritual Ideals. 
### 
Rev.Gardner preached in Memor
ial Church Sunday morning. He
took for his text Romans xiv:l2,
"So then everyone shall give ac
count of himself to God." Dr.
Gardner said in part: "I wish to
impress upon your minds this fact,
—that in life's experience you will
often find your motives, your words,
your works misunderstood. You
will be vexed by criticism, mis
representation, and lack of appre
ciation. And this is my message:
nevertheless be true to yourself, to
your ideals, to your conscience, re
membering that in the final reck
oning you shall give account of
yourself, not to your enemies, not
to your critics, not to the world, but
to God.
"This solemn truth may comfort
us all, but it has especial meaning
for youth. I know from my own
experience that as you face the
louse morality, the sharp compe
tition, the vulgar materialism of the
world,you will have a hard spiritual
struggle. And so I want you to
find here, in these student days,
the moral and spiritual principles
which can alone strengthen your
character, regulate your conduct,
and comfort you in dark days,
You are here to be trained up for
the work of the world. You are to
go forth and be the progressive men
and women of your state, to con
tribute of your thought and life to
the thought and life of the Republic.
But why do young men and young
women drop so naturally into the
happy, selfish philosophy of the
world? The reason is probably
two-fold in its character:
"First, the majority of men and
women you see are busy about their
own affairs, busy in their endeavor
to win a fortune —or at least gain a
competence. No reasonable man
would criticise thrift or honest am
bition. But surely no university
man or woman will be bound down
to any common, sordid view of life.
Surely you want to be happy and
useful. Men of ample wealth, and
women who possess everything the
world has to offer, have confessed
that they were unhappy. The fact
is that money will buy comfort and
luxury and power, but not peace or
happiness. And it is a sad fact
that in the getting of money and
power men and women too often
lose their simple ideas of honor and
honesty; they neglect the spiritual
elements of their nature; they grow
cynical and hard. By all means
set out to succeed; do your best to
win a name and fame, but keep
your mind open to truth, keep your
heart warm and your sympathies
tender, and keep your conscience
clear.
"But another, and perhaps more
subtle reason why so many are hin
dered from public and spiritual
activity, and why so many fine
hearted, hard working men and
women are disappointed and sad, is
the notorious ungratefulness of
human nature. You give of your
heart's best blood, you lend your
best energies to the cause of educa
tion, you dedicate a fortune to
humanity, you work for years hon
estly and faithfully in the cause of
truth and righteousness, and what
is your reward? You are criticised,
misunderstood, and neglected. And
in some dark moment you ask, For
what good? In so far as your work

is honest it will add to the sum of
human knowledge or human hap
piness. What need you care for
the careless criticism of the world,
why need you worry because your
work is not appreciated or your toil
neglected? Remember you shall
give all of your work and yourself
to God, and He will under
stand."
