# Southern High Schools Want Trophy.
## 
### 
The Intersociety Debating League
is in receipt of a communication from
the high school debating league of
Southern California asking for some
such recognition as has been granted
to the high schools of the northern
part of the state. In 1901 the stu
dent body of the University put up
a cup to be contested for by the
high schools in this part of the
state, the high school first winning
three debates to take the cup. No
school has as yet secured permanent
possession. The southern schools
seem desirous of being likewise
recognized, and are so earnest in the
matter that they have sent a man
to confer personally with the Stan
ford authorities. The executive
committee of the Intersociety De
bating League will take the matter
up to-morrow afternoon. Since the
practice has so far brought very
good results and secured many good
debaters for Stanford, there is but
little doubt that some trophy will
be offered for which the southern
high schools may debate. The win
ners in each section will then prob
ably be matched against each other
and an additional interest thereby
aroused.
