# STANFORD DEFEATED.
## Sherman Indians Outplay Varsity Eleven in Every Department of the Game. 
### 
For the second time this season
the Varsity football team suffered
defeat at the hands of a visiting
eleven. In the game on the cam
pus oval Saturday afternoon the
Indian team from the Sherman In
stitute won a well-earned victory
by the score of 5 to 0. Although
the Varsity went into the contest
handicapped by the absence of
some of its best players, who are
temporarily out of the game on ac
count of minor injuries, a defeat
was not anticipated, and the show
ing made by the team was a keen
disappointment to Stanford sup
porters. Twice in the first half the
Varsity was in a position to score,
but forfeited the chance each time
by inexcusable blunders.
Shields, Weller, and Brennan
did the best work for the Varsity.
Shields played center for the first
time, and considering his compara
tive inexperience at the position,
his playing was nearer Varsity
form than that of any other player
on the team. Weller bucked the
line in his old-time form, but his
defensive work was not up to the
usual standard. Brennan's de
fensive playing was a feature of the
game, and he made one of the best
plays of the day by stopping
Payne behind the line before the
Indian could get under way with
the ball.

Saturday's game indicates that
the Varsity has taken a deplorable
slump in its work since the victory
over the Olympics a week ago. At
no department of the game did the
Stanford team show Varsity form,
but the most unsatisfactory phase
of the contest was the utter lack of
coherent team work which charac
terized the play. Unless the work
of some of the substitutes who par

ticipated in the game Saturday im
proves considerably, it is not likely
that they will play in any of the
remaining preliminary contests.
The poor playing of the Varsity
does not discredit the good game
played by the Indians. Their
team work was superior to any
seen on the campus oval this sea
son, and their swiftness of attack
and formation gave indication of
careful coaching. The backs hit
the line hard and low, and the
Indian line-men proved their su
periority by invariably getting the
start on their opponents. Williams,
the former Carlisle star, played his
first game with the Indians, and
proved a tower of strength for the
Sherman team. Despite his lack
of practice the big full-back showed
himself the greatest ground gainer
on the Indian eleven, and his de
fensive work was no less valuable.
