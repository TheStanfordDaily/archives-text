# No Freshman Game To-morrow.
## 
### 
Treasurer Barrett has been un
able to schedule a game for the
Freshman football eleven to-mor
row. An unsuccessful attempt was
made to secure a game with one of
several different San Francisco high
schools. It is barely possible that
another game may be played at
Belmont to-morrow, but there is
little hope of arrangements being
made at this late date.
