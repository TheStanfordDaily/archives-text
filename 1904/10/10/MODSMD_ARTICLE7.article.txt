# Freshman Class Meets.
## 
### 
The Freshman class met at 1:15
this afternoon in the chapel for the
purpose of selecting a class yell.
The number of yells submitted was
so small that the class did not
choose one, but appointed a com
mittee which will get some other
yells and report on them soon. The
committee is composed of J. R.
Hickev, J. 0. Miller and F. H.
Abbot.
