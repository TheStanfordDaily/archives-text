# VARSITY VS. MULTNOMAH.
## Stanford Team Will Meet Northern Eleven on the Campus Gridiron To-morrow. 
### 
The Multnomali Athletic Club
football team from Portland, Ore
gon, arrived on the campus early
this afternoon. The players were
taken to the Encina gymnasium,
where they put on "their football
suits preparatory to an hour of fast
signal work on the oval. After
wards the members of the team
were taken to various fraternity
houses 011 the campus, where they
will remain until after the game.
Wednesday afternoon the Oregon
club men will line-up against the
Varsity in a game, which will be
called promptly at 3:80. Last year
the Multnomah eleven suffered de
feat at the hands of the Varsity by
the score of 12 to 0.
The line-up of the club eleven
presents the names of several men
who have good records on several
Eastern college gridirons. Dowling,
right end, and captain of the team,
played the same position for Lehigh
several years ago. Seeley, the big
right guard of the Multnomah
eleven, has played at both Williams
and Stanford. Grieves, who plays
center, was formerly p. star on the
University of Oregon team. Ross,
left guard, has played with the club
team for the past several years.
Kerrigan, the fast little quarter
back of the Multnomah eleven, is a
former Stanford man, but he did
not play football while he was here.
Horan, right half, played guard for
Lafayette College. He also attended
Stanford and California for short
periods, but did not represent either
university in an intercollegiate foot
ball game. Coatee, the full-back,
who is a track athlete of some note,
learned to play football at Albany
College. The other members of the
team, while not so well known, are
all veteran flayers from strong
elevens.
The line of the club team is un
usually heavy, the center trio aver
aging over 210 pounds to the man.
The back field is Also heavy, and
the halves are fast arid good at line
bucking. George McMillan, who
has been the strongest man on the
club team during the past several
years, accompanies the eleven as
manager, but Will not be in the
game this year.-'' He was formerly
one of Stanford's best guards, and
it is probable that while he is here
he will assist in coaching the can
didates for that position on this
year's Varsity. . .
The line-up of the Varsity for
the first kick-off in to-morrow's
game is considerably changed from
the first line-up of the Indian
game. R. Nispen will pass the
ball, and Shields,will resume his
old place at right tackle. Thomp
son, who has been playing right
tackle, sprained his ankle during
practice last night, and will be un
able to appear on the gridiron for
several days. Sprague, who has
been out of the game with an in
jured shoulder for a week, will play
left tackle. Bansbach's ankle is
still weak, and he. may not play in
to-morrow's contest. ), ■; ;
