Thursday night the football rally
in honor of the Freshman team will
he held in the chapel. One of the
objects of this meeting is to. perfect
the rooting, and to this end it is de
sirable that as many men as possi
ble attend. At the same time a
large number of the women of the
University will undoubtedly desire
to be present, and roam- must be
found for them, for they are as
vitally interesteclMn' the' Freshman
team as are the ui.pn. The spirit
they show in coming out is excellent.
However, certain arrangements
in regard to the seating at the
rallies held in the chapel' should be
made and observed. To get the best
results from the rooters it is essen
tial that a large body of men occupy
the seats in the front part of the
building, and it is suggested that the
women who attend take seats in the
rear. This plan will provide for a
solid body of rooters, and at the
same time will give opportunity
for the women to be seated comfort
ably.
