### 
The following is an extract taken
from an extended article in the Cor-!
Nell Daily Sun commenting on Prof, j
A. W. Smith, who left Stanford this j
year to accept the chair of Sibley
College of Engineering at Cornell: j
"Although"always a good student
Professor Smith was also foremostj
in Cornell athletics. He was a
member of bis freshman crew in
1875 and the following year won a
seat in the varsity shell. Professor
Smith has already organized the)
shops and has made an important
step in reducing the number of
hours of that department from
three to two each term."
