# Minnesota's New Hour System.
## 
### 
The six day, three-hour system
is now in full operation at the Uni
versity of Minnesota, and opinions
about the change are no longer
mere conjecture. The system is
not meeting with the enthusiastic
approval of the student body he
cause of the irregular hours which
it necessitates, says the Minnesota
Daily. Very few favorable com
ments have been heard. The fac
ulty believed that the new sys
tem would distribute the students'
work over six days instead of five.
In the case of freshmen this result
has been obtained, but many of the
upper-classmen have hunched their
work more than before. This
bunching, however, is a great ad
vantage to the many students who
are working their way. It gives
them one or two whole days for
work instead of a few hours, as un
der the old system.
