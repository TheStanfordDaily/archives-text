# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## First Team Outplayed by Second in Interference Formation. 
### 
The football practice yesterday
afternoon was characterized by a
show of listlesaness on the part of
the men which does not speak well
for this part of the season. Unless
the Varsity men show more dash
and spirit in the game with the
Multnomah Club to-morrow, Stan
ford will be defeated. The men do
not get into the game with the fire
which they displayed last year.
The second team clearly outplayed
the first team on the Varsity squad
yesterday.
There was no scrimmage, but the
teams were lined up to oppose each
other in breaking up interference.
The whole practice was devoted to
punting the ball and drilling in
team work. Several times the second
team broke through the first team
line, blocked the punts, and se
cured the ball. Bogle did the kick
ing for the first team, and Coach
Lanagan for the second. There was
some bad fumbling, particularly on
the part of the first team. Coach
Lanagan introduced an innovation
in the drill at interference forma
tion by having the men stop sud
denly as soon as the play started so
that he could note their relative
positions, and criticize their man
ner of formation.
During the practice R. A.Thomp
son wa√ü injured by a badly sprained
ankle. He will be off the field for
at least a week. Bansbach, who
has recovered from his sprained
ankle, was back on the Bquad to
day. There is 110 longer any ques
tion about the re-appearance of
Roosevelt and W. H. Dole, as the
former was in practice to day, and
the latter will be out later in the
week.
