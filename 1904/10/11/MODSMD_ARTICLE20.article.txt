# RECEIVES DOCTOR'S DEGREE.
## P.H. Olsson-Seffer of the Department of Systematic Botany Takes Ph. D. 
### 
At the last meeting of the Uni
versity Council, Instructor P. H.
Olsson-Seffer, of the department of
Systematic Botany, was awarded
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy,
having fulfilled all the necessary
requirements. Although the Board
of Trustees has not yet officially
confirmed the degree, it will do so
at the next regular meeting, which
will be held at the end of the pres
ent month.
Peter Hjalmar Olsson-Seffer is a
native of Sweden, and prior to his
coming to America has held a long
list of positions and honors that
make his present assumption of
the Doctor's degree more in the na
ture of a mere form than anything
else. Besides being widely known
as a botanist from his numerous
and valuable contributions to
botanical literature, he is well
known as a journalist and a lin
guist. He is master of ten different
languages, among them Danish,
Finnish, Russian and Swedish, be
sides the usual scientific languages,
and from his earliest college days
he has been more or less connected
with journalism.
In 1892 he graduated with honors
from the University of Helsingfors,
Sweden, and from 1893 to 1895
held a fellowship in botany at that
university. In 1895 he was ap
pointed assistant in botany at the
same university. In 1896 he be
came instructor in Swedish at Mari
chamn College, and from 1895 to
1897 acted as university extension
lecturer. Spending two years more
independently as a student at the
universities of Upsala, Helsingfors,
and Dorpat, he then became an in
structor in botany at Helsingfors,
holding that position for a year.
During this time he had com
pleted sufficient work to secure him
his Master's degree, but decided to
pass this over with the intention of
securing the Doctor's degree later.
For the last four years he had also
edited a Finnish political paper,
named the "Vart Land," which he
had himself founded, and which
bitterly opposed the Russian policy
in Finland. In order to escape the
resentment which was beginning to
manifest itself on the part of the
Russian authorities, and partly in
order to gain material for his doc
tor's thesis, Olsson-Seffer left Eu
rope in 1900 and went to Aus
tralia.
In Australia he at once gained
recognition, and after holding
several responsible positions under
various companies there he became
advisor in the Department of Lands
of Queensland and Western Aus
tralia. This position he held for
the remainder of his stay in Aus
tralia.
In the spring of 1902 he came to
Stanford, first as assistant in the
department of Systematic Botany,
and one year later becoming in
structor in the same
The work that he has published on
botany alone in the past twelve
years consists of over forty books
and pamphlets. There are few im
portant botanical magazines to
which he has not at one time been
a contributor.
The thesis upon which his degree
is conferred is entitled "A Compar
ison of Land Floras on Marine
Coasts." It will be printed during
the fall.
