the grandstand, but there will be
no reserved seats. Beginning to

on sale at the Bookstore. Word
comes from the University of Cali

bleachers on the new field will be
completed in time to allow the play

field. Otherwise the game will be
played on the old practice field,
which is in poor condition.
