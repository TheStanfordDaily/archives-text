ject of Carnot preliminaries was
first taken up. There have been but

held. The following have entered:
D. D. Sales, '06, R. G. Barnett, '05,

The petition of the southern Cali
fornia high schools for such recog
nizance as is given the northern
schools in debating, was also dis
cussed in full. The league making
the petition includes sixteen high
schools of Los Angeles county.
There are, however, two minor
leagues, one in San Bernardino
county and another in Riverside
county. The committee did not
think it advisable to grant a trophy
to the Los Angeles League when
there are two other similar organ
izations in the field. Accordingly
it was decided to suggest to the
Executive Committee of the student
body that they offer a cup to the
southern high schools if they will
unite in one league.
It was thought advisable to put
two debating teams in the field this
year. An effort will be made to
arrange a debate with Nevada, and
negotiations with that end in view
will be entered into immediately.
