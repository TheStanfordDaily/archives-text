# Rally Thursday Night.
## 
### 
The final rally before the inter
collegiate Freshman game will be
held Thursday evening in the
chapel. Arrangements are being
made to hold a rousing meeting of
the student body at that time.
Aside from the usual singing and
yelling, speeches will be made by
several faculty members, and it is
probable that the coaches will
speak. By that time the Fresh
man class will have decided upon
a yell which will be used at the
Freshman game. The new songs
chosen by the committee will prob
ably be tried. A detailed account
of the rally will be published in
the Daily Palo Alto to-morrow
night. , 1
