# ENGLISH CLUB LECTURE.
## Dr. Anderson Will Speak in Chapel Tomorrow on "Much Ado About Nothing." 
### 
On Wednesday evening at 8
o'clock Dr. M. B. Anderson of the
English department will deliver a
lecture in the chapel on "Much
Ado About Nothing," the play
which is to be given by Ben Greet
on October 21st. The lecture will
be in the nature of an open meet
ing of the English Club, and is
given for the purpose of creating a
greater interest in Greet's coming
performance, as well as to give the
foundation for a better appreci
ation of the play. Before the lec
ture Dr. Jordan will say a few
words of introduction, and will
then be followed by President D.
M. Reynolds of the English Club,
who will introduce Dr. Anderson.
Greet brings with him only three
members of his former company,
but from the performances so far
given on the Coast it is evident
that the present one is more than up
to the standard of last year. The
three members of the old company
to return are Mrs. Crawley, who
took the part of Everyman; Mr.
Crawley, who took the part of
Death; and Mr. Goodwyn, who is
remembered in the role of the
monk for his splendid chanting of
the confession.
"Much Ado About Nothing" is
to be presented Friday night, Octo
ber '21st, and upon the return of
the company from its southern
trip "Hamlet" will be given. The
date has been set for Saturday,
November 19th.
Ben Greet has made arrange
ments with Instructor Hassett of
the English department to have a
number of the minor roles of
"Hamlet" rendered by students of
the University. Several more or
less important roles are to be in
cluded in this, and altogether fif
teen or sixteen parts will be as
signed. Instructor Bassett will as
sign the parts himself, and see to
the proper preparation of those
undertaking them. Greet will hold
two full rehearsals, one upon the
presentation of "Much Ado About
Nothing" and the other when he re
turns from his southern trip.
There will also be a small number
of less important parts given to
students in "Much Ado About
Nothing," but these will not be
speaking parts, and will require
only a few simple instructions.
This assignment of parts to stu
dents was attended with great suc
cess when "Hamlet" was produced
at California a week ago.
