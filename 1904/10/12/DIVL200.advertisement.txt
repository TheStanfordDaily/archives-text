San Jose, Cal., July 5, 1904.
I)rs. Pratt & Kerr: Gentlemen —The
glasses you fitted for my eon give full
satisfaction. His eyes began troubling
him about a year ago. They were
treated by a physician, with no benefit,
and continued to grow worse, until he
had severe pains in his eyeballs. They
became so bad he was obliged to give up
school. About this time you fitted him
with glasses, which gave him immediate
relief. lie can now read or study with
ease and has no headaches.
Yours very truly,
[Signed] G. L. Dunlap.
We have many other letters which

reason that what we have done for
others we can probably do for you?
Satisfaction guaranteed.
