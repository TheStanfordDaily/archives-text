# PRACTICE GAME.
## Freshmen Score Two Touch-downs on Second Team in Fast Game. 
### 
Last night the Freshman team de
feated the second Varsity eleven in
a fast game by the score of 10 to 0.
The '08 team played brilliantly
and outgeneraled their heavy anta
gonists from the start to the end of
a twenty-minute half.
The team work of the Freshmen
was excellent, and the individual
members of the team played with
more dash and vim than they have
exhibited in any other preliminary
game. Coach Lanagan, Assistant
Coach Hauverman and Captain
Clark took advantage of the inter
missions between downs to instruct
the players while the mistakes they
made were still fresh in their minds.
The '08 back-field was quick and
aggressive, and the line by holding
better than usual was of material
aid in assisting in the formation of
good interference.
Tomasini and Horton, who
lined up with the Freshman eleven
for the first time, played the tackle
positions with good effect.
A point of value developed by
yesterday's game was the marked
ability exhibited by the Freshmen
in aiding the runner to keep his
feet. One of the touch-downs made
by the '08 team may be directly at
tributed to the aid given the run
ner by his team-mates.
The second team kicked off to
the Freshmen, and after making a
few yards on two straight bucks
Vandervoort was given the ball for
a cross buck outside of tackle. A
hole was made for him through the
opposing line, and dodging the
quarter-back he sped down the
field for a jrun of seventy-five yards.
He was tackled on the second
team's twenty-yard line. After
two more bucks Tomasini was
pushed over the line for a touch
down. No goal was kicked, leav
ing the score 5 to 0 in favor of '08.
Assisted by superb interference, a
few moments afterward Tomasini
on the tackle-around formation
ran twenty yards to a second touch
down. Moody again failed to kick
the goal, and the game ended with
the score 10 to 0 in favor of the
Freshmen.
