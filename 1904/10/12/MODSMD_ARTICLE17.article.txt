# Returns from Far East.

### 
N. F. Drake, A. B. 1894, A. M.
1895, and Ph. D., 1897, has recently
returned from China, where he has
been engaged in geological work for
the past six years. Drake has done
highly successful work in the Far
East, and expects to return to
China next January to resume a
professorship in the Imperial Uni
versity at Tien-Tain, which he held
prior to the closing of the univer
sity during the Boxer troubles.
Drake has made a study of the
coal possibilities of China, and has
held positions under many of the
foreign companies that are at pres
ent engaged in developing the min
ing industry. In America he is well
known for his numerous connec
tions with various geological sur
veys. The relief map of California
which accompanied his doctor's
thesis is generally accepted as the
finest relief that has ever been made
of any state.
