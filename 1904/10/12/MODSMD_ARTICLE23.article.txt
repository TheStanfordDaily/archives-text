## Review of the Prospects at Yale, Harvard and Princeton Universities. 
### 
The month of September ended
with the Yale coaches trying bard
to find an effective back-field for
her eleven. Already the line be
gins to assume shape, says the
Alumni News, with the exception of
the ends; but if Rockwell be ex
cepted no backs of more than ordi
nary ability are in sight. Roome,
who began well, has stopped dead
in his progress. Quill shows a good
offense, hut is poor defensively.
The same criticism can be made
truthfully of Stevenson, Flinn and
Hoyt and White. Shevlin has been
moved from right end to full-back
to help in the second line of defense.
When he learns the duties of the
position he will add greatly to the
defensive strength of any back-field,
but there seems to be a question as
to the advisability of taking him
from the end of the line when ends
are so scarce in the Y'ale squad.
But for that matter good backs are
scarcer. The change is an experi
ment. Cates and Stevens are the
prominent candidates for ends, with
Cates the best of the two. Stillman
injured his knee again and can not
be counted on for that reason. Bow
man, the best punter on the field,
will probably not return to the
game, having injured his shoulder
badly in the early practice. Some
heavy men have been found to
strengthen the line of the second
eleven, but they are inexperienced
and slow, and will have to be
coached hard for two or three weeks
before they are of much value.
Y r ale showed nothing of particu
lar interest in the first football
game of the season with Wesleyan
at the field Wednesday, September
28th. Her plays were rarely stopped
short of a gain, and for a first game
there were comparatively few pen
alties inflicted. What were inflicted
helped largely to prevent further
scoring. Wesleyan proved to be
stronger than usual, and fought
hard to keep the score down, par
ticularly in the second half. Yale
depended principally on straight
plunges into the line by her backs.
A few times the tackles were used
to carry the ball, and twice a slow
form of mass play was tried just as
an experiment. The latter was
poorly executed, and was not an
impressive success.
Yale will probably have no game
to test her until the West Point
game, October 22d. Trinity, Holy
Cross and the Pennsylvania State
College, the first three games in
October, will probably be easy.
Last year Holy Cross, although
beaten bv a large score, kicked two
place-goals from scrimmage and got
teu points against Y'ale.
Among the coaches who have
been at the field helping Hogan
and Rafferty have been Walter
Camp, W. H. Corbin, F. S. Butter
worth, Frank Hinkey, J.O. Rodgers
and Burr Chamberlain. Mitchell,
'04, is working with the punters.
Harvard has one of the largest
and best squads of material that
has ever reported for a Harvard
eleven. There is an abundance of
heavy men for all positions, and the
little work that has been done at
this writing shows the beginning of
a systematic development. Edgar
Wrightington is head coach and
Bowditch the field coach. Besides
these there will be a staff of coaches
to decide difficult problems and

give assistance to Captain Hurley
when needed. The team is Bure to
be very heavy. West Point, Octo
ber 15th, the week before Yale
meets the same team, will be Har
vard's first game to test her players.
Princeton has seventy men on the
football field, and the coacbes have
difficulty in speaking modestly of
the outlook. Several preparatory
players of reputation are daily
proving themselves in 'the early
practice, and it begins to look as
though the losses by graduation
would be made good very quickly.
The first game, September 28th,
with Dickinson, was not impressive.
Princeton scorced only twelve
points, while Dickinson carried the
ball frequently for long distances
through the line and lost chances
to score twice on fumbles. But this
was the first game and doesn't
mean anything.

a systematic development. Edgar
Wrightington is head coach and
Bowditch the field coach. Besides
these there will be a staff of coaches
to decide difficult problems and

give assistance to Captain Hurley
when needed. The team is Bure to
be very heavy. West Point, Octo
ber 15th, the week before Yale
meets the same team, will be Har
vard's first game to test her players.
Princeton has seventy men on the
football field, and the coacbes have
difficulty in speaking modestly of
the outlook. Several preparatory
players of reputation are daily
proving themselves in 'the early
practice, and it begins to look as
though the losses by graduation
would be made good very quickly.
The first game, September 28th,
with Dickinson, was not impressive.
Princeton scorced only twelve
points, while Dickinson carried the
ball frequently for long distances
through the line and lost chances
to score twice on fumbles. But this
was the first game and doesn't
mean anything.
