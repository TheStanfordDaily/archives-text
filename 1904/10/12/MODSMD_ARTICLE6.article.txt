# Varsity Football Practice.
## 
### 
The Varsity squad was engaged
in punting and in light signal
practice yesterday afternoon. The
practice was short in order to clear
the field for the game between the
second team and the Freshmen.
Dole, Trowbridge, and Macdonald
did the punting for the regular
drill at running in the ball. There
is some improvement in handling
the ball, and the ends are showing
more speed in getting down on
punts. The two teams did not op
pose each other either in scrim
mage or in interference formation,
but both eng'ged in light signal
practice.
The reappearance of Dole at
half and Roosevelt at guard
strengthens the first team ma
terially. A. E. Preston, '05, also
appeared on the gridiron last night
for the first time. Preston played
as a substitute end in the intercol
legiate game of 1901.
