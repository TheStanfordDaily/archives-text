Gis for Glasses.
Frames of nickel or gold—
But the part most important
Is the lenses they hold.
Spectacle and eye-glass frames and
mountings should be litted with three
ends always in view:
First: They most hold the lenses in
the correct position before the eye, the
center of the lens exactly at the center
of the pupil.
Second: They should be so adjusted
that they fit the face properly.
Third: The cosmetic effect is impor
tant. There is 110 excuse for unbecom
ing glasses. The great variety of styles
and sizes make it possible to fit every
face with a becoming arrangement of
frames and lenses.
We lit frames and mountings cor
rectly—l nit. after all the part of para
mount importance is the lenses. They
must be RIGHT—JUST RIGHT.
Right lenses. Right frames. Right
prices. Satisfaction guaranteed.
