# NOTHING TO NOTHING.
## Varsity Eleven Fails to Score Against the Multnomah Club Team. 
### 
The game between the Varsity
and Multnomah on the campus
oval yesterday afternoon ended
without a score being made by
either side. The loose, listless
playing of the Stanford team indi
cated that the players are still in
a slump. While the individual
work of the Varsity back-field waß
on the average good, its effective
ness was mitigated by the unsteadi
ness of the line, which failed to
hold at critical times. Much of
the disastrous fumbling by the
backs was due to the weakness of
the line, which allowed the Mult
nomah line-men to break through
before the ball was securely in pos
session of the runner. Although
Stott backed up the line well, and
made several brilliant runs in a
scattered field, he did not direct
the team with his usual good judg
ment. His failure to pass the five
yard limit on a quarter-back run
lost a touch-down to the Varsity
early in the game. Shields was
the only man on the line who
played in consistent Varsity form.
By closely following the ball he
was enabled to secure it several
times on bad fumbles made by the
club backs. Weller, Brennan,
Trowbridge, and Stanford played
good ball, but their interference
was so poor that their playing was
not effective.
The individual playing of the
club men was on the whole fair,
but their frequent mistakes in sig
nals caused them to fumble even
more disastrously than the Varsity.
Substantial gains were made by
the Multnomah players on an as
sortment of trick plays which the
Varsity seemed unable to cope
with. Perhaps the chief indication
of a lack of practice on the part of
Multnomah was the lack of con
certed team work. The best play
ing for the club eleven was done
by Seeley, Horan, Pratt, and
Coates. The last named, who
played full-back, had the ligaments
of his left leg severely torn as the
game was almost over, and it is
not probable that he will be able
to play again this year.
Stanford kicked off, and Kerri
gan carried the ball 7 yards
before he was stopped by the Stan
ford ends. Dolph was sent through
tackle, but fumbled the ball,
and it was in possession of Stan
ford on Multnomah's 15-yard line.
Bucks by Shields, Weller, and
Brennan carried the ball 5 yards
farther. At this juncture Stott
took the ball on a quarter-back
run, and carried it over the line.
He failed, however, to run out
yards, and the ball was brought
back to its starting point. Multno
mah secured the ball on downs, and
punted out of danger. Stanford
again worked the ball up within
striking distance of the Multnomah
goal, only to lose it on an unfortu
nate fumble.
Multnomah again punted to the
middle of the field, and by break
ing three times regained possession
of the ball. A series of long gains
through tackle, and around the
ends, by the club backs placed the
ball in dangerous proximity to the
Stanford goal. The longest gain
was a 30-yard dash made outside of
tackle by Horan. Stanford gained
the ball and punted out of danger.
The half ended with the ball on the
Varsity's 25-yard line.
The second period was more
clearly to the advantage of Mult
nomah, although the Varsity threat
ened their goal-line once. On this
occasion the club men held on their
12-yard line, and taking the ball
gradually worked it up the field.
The game ended with the ball near
the middle of the field.

The game between the Varsity
and Multnomah on the campus
oval yesterday afternoon ended
without a score being made by
either side. The loose, listless
playing of the Stanford team indi
cated that the players are still in
a slump. While the individual
work of the Varsity back-field waß
on the average good, its effective
ness was mitigated by the unsteadi
ness of the line, which failed to
hold at critical times. Much of
the disastrous fumbling by the
backs was due to the weakness of
the line, which allowed the Mult
nomah line-men to break through
before the ball was securely in pos
session of the runner. Although
Stott backed up the line well, and
made several brilliant runs in a
scattered field, he did not direct
the team with his usual good judg
ment. His failure to pass the five
yard limit on a quarter-back run
lost a touch-down to the Varsity
early in the game. Shields was
the only man on the line who
played in consistent Varsity form.
By closely following the ball he
was enabled to secure it several
times on bad fumbles made by the
club backs. Weller, Brennan,
Trowbridge, and Stanford played
good ball, but their interference
was so poor that their playing was
not effective.
The individual playing of the
club men was on the whole fair,
but their frequent mistakes in sig
nals caused them to fumble even
more disastrously than the Varsity.
Substantial gains were made by
the Multnomah players on an as
sortment of trick plays which the
Varsity seemed unable to cope
with. Perhaps the chief indication
of a lack of practice on the part of
Multnomah was the lack of con
certed team work. The best play
ing for the club eleven was done
by Seeley, Horan, Pratt, and
Coates. The last named, who
played full-back, had the ligaments
of his left leg severely torn as the
game was almost over, and it is
not probable that he will be able
to play again this year.
Stanford kicked off, and Kerri
gan carried the ball 7 yards
before he was stopped by the Stan
ford ends. Dolph was sent through
tackle, but fumbled the ball,
and it was in possession of Stan
ford on Multnomah's 15-yard line.
Bucks by Shields, Weller, and
Brennan carried the ball 5 yards
farther. At this juncture Stott
took the ball on a quarter-back
run, and carried it over the line.
He failed, however, to run out
yards, and the ball was brought
back to its starting point. Multno
mah secured the ball on downs, and
punted out of danger. Stanford
again worked the ball up within
striking distance of the Multnomah
goal, only to lose it on an unfortu
nate fumble.
Multnomah again punted to the
middle of the field, and by break
ing three times regained possession
of the ball. A series of long gains
through tackle, and around the
ends, by the club backs placed the
ball in dangerous proximity to the
Stanford goal. The longest gain
was a 30-yard dash made outside of
tackle by Horan. Stanford gained
the ball and punted out of danger.
The half ended with the ball on the
Varsity's 25-yard line.
The second period was more
clearly to the advantage of Mult
nomah, although the Varsity threat
ened their goal-line once. On this
occasion the club men held on their
12-yard line, and taking the ball
gradually worked it up the field.
The game ended with the ball near
the middle of the field.
