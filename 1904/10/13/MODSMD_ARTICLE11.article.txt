# Band Uniforms Completed.

### 
The new uniforms purchased by
the University band have been
completed by Frazer & Co. of Palo
Alto. The uniforms are designed
to last several years, being well
lined throughout, and carefully
sewed. The color is a dark cardi
nal, with white braid trimming.
The band will first appear in them
at the Freshman game Saturday.
