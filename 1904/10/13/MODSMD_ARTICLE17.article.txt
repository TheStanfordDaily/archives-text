# SHAKSPEREAN LECTURE.
## Professor M.B. Anderson Delivers Instructive Address on "Much Ado About Nothing." 
### 
The chapel was crowded last
evening to hear Professor Melville
Best Anderson of the English de
partment speak on "Much Ado
about Nothing." which is to he pre
sented by the Ben Greet Company
in Assembly Hall Friday, October
21st. First, Dr. Anderson spoke in
behalf of the Greet company, prais
ing them in their earnest and sin
cere effort to put forth a high-class
entertainment untainted with the
faults which so often accompany
the work of professional actors.
Turning to the play itself Dr. An
derson said that "Much Ado About
Nothing," "The Merchant of Ven
ice," and "Richard III" are the
three most popular of Shakspere's
plays on the stage. He gave an
interesting review of the play in
question, discussing the plot and
movement, and reading passages
and comments. The pleasant
story of the merry war between Ben
edick and Beatrice, where each finds
an equal antagonist in wit, was
brought out. The unflattering re
marks of Beatrice, in which "she
speaks poignards and every breath
stabs," and Benedick's fiery retorts
were reviewed by the speaker, who
showed that in spite of their viva
cious criticisms and affected dis
dain they had a wholesome respect
and regard for each other. The
plot of the prince and Claudio and
the ladies to entrap the two into a
conscious affection for each other
gives to the motif a fascinating in
terest, and their ingenious acts in
bringing it about are well contrived
by the writer. By means of solilo
quies Shakspere reveals the real
thoughts for each other as they de
velop in Beatrice and in Benedick.
In the speech used by the actors,
some of the language, though full
of life and vigor in that day, is
meaningless to-day unless the met
aphors are explained. This Dr.
Anderson did, throwing light on
many passages, livening the play.
In this play, as in his others,
Shakspere shows his master hand
in arrangement and movement.
The practical joke on Beatrice and
Benedick is in no light coarse. In
stead of building a false relation
between them it breaks down the
barrier caused by their wit.
By the introduction of Don John,
Dogberry, and other characters, the
author's delicate touch is used to
relieve a situation which otherwise
might be lagging or strained. The
approach to the tragic in the
wedding is necessary in order to get
the proper sympathy with the
heroes from the audience. Above
all, Shakspere in this play shows
his skill in handling the complica
tions attendant not only to the
tying and untying of the knot, but
to that intervening part between
which is the critical stage, and in
which so many playwrights fail.
In closing Dr. Anderson praised
the character and intelligence of
Shakspere's women. He said that
they remind him moreof the modern
American woman, particularly of
that type common in the West,
than of any others he knew of.
The combination of intelligence,
sound sense, winning ways, and
charming manner found in these
characters is far in advance of any
type in Shakspere's day, and finds
its exponent only in the American
woman of to-day.
