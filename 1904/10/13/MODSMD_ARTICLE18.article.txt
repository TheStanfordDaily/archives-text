The Freshman football squad
elected Kenneth L. Fenton captain
of the first-year team this evening.
He was chosen on the first ballot
and his election was then made
unanimous. Fenton hails from
Portland, Ore., where he has played
with the Portland Academy eleven
for the past three or four years.
He plays quarter-back on the first
year team, and will direct the plays
in Saturday's game. He is re
garded as a heady field general, a
consistent punter, and a safe man
in the back-field. He is a law
major and a member of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity.
The Freshman squad engaged in
light signal practice yesterday, the
first team being under the super
vision of Coach Lanagan and the
second team of Assistant Coach

mage or field work. The first team
has developed more speed, and has
improved materially in the han
dling of the ball.
