# H.R. THOMAS, '07, WINS PRIZE.
## Football Song Competition Brings Out Fifty-two Songs.â€”No New Yells Selected. 
### 
The first prize of ten dollars in
the football song competition which
closed last night has been awarded
to H. li. Thomas, '07, for his origi
nal song entitled "Stanford Wilis
To-day." This is to be sung to the
tune of "Solomon Levi." F. B.

Goudy, '06, will receive the second
prize of five dollars for an original
song to the tune of "Contrary
Mary," and named "Weeping Wil
lows." Both of the prize winners
are spirited football songs of excep
tional cleverness. The range of
the music is within everyone's
reach and there is no reason why
they should not be a great success.
Three other songs have been
given honorable mention and will

be printed in the song-book. They
are as follows: "Raise the Cardi
nal," by A. H. Rose, '05, to the
tune of the High Ball song; "Go
Tell Old Berkeley,'' by Miss Mabel
Baum, '04, to the tune of "Aunt
Rhodv"; and a clever song by
Miss Claire Soule,'os, to the tune of
"Three Jolly Sailor Boys."
In all fifty-two songs were en
tered in the competition. This is
nearly twice as many as were
banded in last year, and the com
mittee had considerable difficulty
in making the selections. The
words were considered first, then
the adaptability of the tune to root
ing conditions. The song-book
will be printed and placed on sale
the last of next week.
In regard to the new yells con
tributed, the committee has decided
that none are worthy of the prize.
The "Fight 'em" yell, which has al
ready been tried on the bleachers,
will be adopted and printed, but
this yell was not entered in the
competition.
