# Stanford Wins To-day.
## 
### 
Tune, " Solomon Levy."
Our sturdy team is on the field, our colors they proudly wear,
The air is ringing with Stanford shouts, the Cardinal's everywhere;
We'll show these fellows a thing or two,
We'll teach them how to play;
So give a big cheer for the Varsity team,
For Stanford wins to-day !
Chorus.
Poor old Berkeley ! What is the matter with you?
Poor, sorrowing Berkeley ! Why are you looking so blue?
Our team will scatter the enemy's line,
They'll soon roll up the score,
The Stanford spirit will win the day,
As it has done before.
The Stanford men are lining up, they're ready for the fray,
So give a big cheer for the Varsity team, for Stanford wins to-day.
We'll trim the whiskers and pare the claws of the hoary old Berkeley bear,
We'll paint his nose a cardinal hue, and make him dye his hair.
It's " back to the woods" with Hopper and Stroud
And the rest of the Berkeley crew,
For the Cardinal banners are waving to-dav
Over the Gold and Blue.
Weeping Willows.
Tune, "Contrary Mary."
Berkeley, 0 Berkeley, we come to do you,
We will surprise you, when we start through you,
Your palms of victory we'll change to willows
Weeping aloud for poor old Berkeley. •
Long have you boasted how you could do ue,
We're from Missouri, you'll have to show us, show us.
Your palms of victory we'll change to willows
Weeping aloud for poor old Berkeley.
Go Tell Old Berkeley.
Tune, "Aunt Rliotly."
Go tell old Berkeley,
Poor, poor old Berkeley,
She'll have to learn the game.
Watch us now n-coming,
See the ball a-humming,
(There's to be no bumming),
While Stanford makes the score.
Go tell old Berkeley, etc. (Repeat.)
Raise the Cardinal.
Tune, " High Ball " Song.
Raise the cardinal, our cardinal,
For our hearts are stout and strong.
Sing the story of her glory,
For the praise to her belongs.
Every man in every play,
And the Stanford spirit leading,
We'll surely win the day.
The Valiant Varsity.
Tune, "Three Jolly Sailor Boys."
Oh! Come now all ye loyal Stanford men,
Come and cheer, cheer, cheer, for your valiant Varsity,
For the day of battle strong has come again
And the team is marching on to victory.
Chorus.
Oh! Stanford, can't you see our team is winning,
Watch 'em play, play, play, all those, all those mighty Stanford men,
For the Cardinal is now waving high,
And the Golden Bear will never score again.
Oh! Stanford's lusty voices fill the air,
In the breeze the Stanford red is fluttering,
And the Golden Bear is searching for his lair,
There to hibernate in sorrow while we sing.
Chorus.
