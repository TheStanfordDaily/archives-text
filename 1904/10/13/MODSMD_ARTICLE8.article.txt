Nor many semesters have passed
since class officers, especially in
the Senior and Junior classes, were
elected not only according to pro
visions of a class constitution, but
also according to a long-standing
custom. Former class constitu
tions provided for nominations
which were followed by an election
that could not take place sooner
than five days after the regular
meeting for nominations was held.
At any time between the class
meeting and the date set for the
election additional candidates could
be named for offices. There is
nothing to contradict the fact that
this plan [is still in vogue; and if
that be true, it would seem that
the Senior class at its meeting yes
terday afternoon overstepped the
customary bounds of class elections.
It is true that there is often no
competition for class offices, and
in that case there is no immediate
harm that can result from an elec
tion by acclamation. But the
precedent is a bad one. It allows
too much room for unfairness. And
then it is never possible to know
whether or not other nominees who
are not at the meeting wish to an
nounce themselves. The acclama
tion system for these reasons should
be done away with before it results
in an attempt at railroading
through a slate of class officers at
an election in which there is con
siderable interest shown. The
only thoroughly fair system for
class elections is that which was
formerly followed. A reasonable
length of time should elapse be
tween nominations and elections.
