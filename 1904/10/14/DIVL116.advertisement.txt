Hie for hypermetropia,
A cause of much strain.
A pair of our glasses
Will relieve all the pain.
Hypermetropia, or fur sight, is the
most common cause of eye-strain, with
its accompaniment of headaches and re-
Hex nervous troubles.
Here's the result of our treatment of
one case:
July 6, 1904.
Drs. Pratt it Kerr—Dear Sirs: The
glasses you fitted for my little daughter
have been of great benefit to her. She
no longer complains of watery eyes,
itching lids,or loosened eyelashes. That
scaly and inflamed appearance has all
disappeared. Her general health is also
much improved, and she does not now
have nervous,irritable spells,as was often
the case before she began wearing the
glasses.
Thanking you for the good you have
done my little girl, 112 am yours very truly,
[Signed] ]\lus. K. L. Hancock.
If your young friends have any of the
symptoms of this case we invite you to
bring them in. We'll give you an
honest opinion.
