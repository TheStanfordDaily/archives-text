# NEW "ALUMNUS" APPEARS.
## Graduate Publication Edited by A B. Rice, '95, a Decided Improvement. 
### 
An advance copy of the Alumnus
in its new form reached us to-day.
The innovation is a decided im
provement over the old form, and it
is now one of the most interesting
and attractive papers to be found
among college publications. In its
new appearance it is of a neat little
magazine size, with cover index,
and is to be issued monthly. The
editor, Archie Rice, '95, is to do all
the work one year for nothing, and
at the end of that time have things
so systematized that, if acceptable
to the Alumni Association, future
charge may be taken of it by edi
torial and advertisement commit
tees of the Stanford Club of San
Francisco; and the probable profits
of $70 or $80 a month devoted to
rental of Stanford club-rooms for
Stanford's biggest and most ac
cessible graduate colony.
The issue contains a number of
interesting articles on present con
ditions and plans for future move
ments of both the student body
and the Alumni Association. The
Alumnus is vigorously urging the
projected general campus reunion
to be held next spring. There is a
comprehensive article, illustrated,
011 changes and developments about
Stanford University, interesting to
the general public. Among the
pictures are the new Library, the
new Gymnasium, the Museum and
the mosaics on the front of Memor
ial Church. "Why Mayfield Is
to Abolish Its Saloons" is interest
ing, showing that the "Mayfield
habit" has cost Stanford in thirteen
years the expulsion of 400 men.
The Alumni Association is taken to
task for lethargy and want of or
ganization. There are comments
on the Freshman class, with sta
tistics and comparisons. Foot
ball prospects are treated, and
features suggested for the big game
at Berkeley. There are also re
views of track and baseball pros
pects. Cuts are given of Coach
Lanagan, Captain Clark, and Nor
man Dole, '04. The developments
of the musical organizations are
taken up.
Tabulated lists are given of
alumni as located by groups all
over the world, showing numbers
in each locality. It is interesting
to note in this connection that
those places having the largest
groups of alumni are as follows:
San Francisco 211, I'alo Alto 118,
San Jose 93, Los Angeles 86, Stan
ford University 60, New York 44,
San Bernardino 42, Pasadena and
Seattle, each 25; Oakland 22, Ber
keley, Sacramento, and Portland,
each 21; San Diego and Denver,
each 16; Fresno, Santa Ana, and
Tacoma, each 15; Stockton 14,
Alameda, Riverside, Santa Rosa,
San Luis Obispo, and Eureka, each
13, and so on, Honolulu having 10,
Manila 8, and London 4. There
are lists of all Stanford graduates
who are lawyers, doctors, journal
ists, college teachers, and preachers.
Besides these are general personal
notes of Stanford people.
Much credit is due the new edi-
tor, Archie Rice, who has written
ever)' word in the edition, in his
vigorous style, from cover to cover.
The movement to apply the receipts
to a rental of Stanford cluh-rooms
should receive recognition by sub
scriptions from alumni, particu
larly those in the neighborhood of
San Francisco, who will be most
benefited by it. Of the 1875 liv
ing graduates of Stanford and a to
tal of 5000 Stanford men and
women out in the world, at least 450
are in that vicinity.
