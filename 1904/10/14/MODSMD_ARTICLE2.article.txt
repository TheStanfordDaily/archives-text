The merits of the 1908 team are
now ready to be tested in the eleventh
annual intercollegiate Freshman
game with the University of Cali
fornia. The playing of the Stan
ford Freshmen in the preliminary
games has been extremely erratic,
but during the last week the team
has rounded into shape, and is now
playing consistent ball. The final
selection of the team by the coaches
meets with general approval.
Some of the candidates so narrowly
missed making the team that their
substitutes, in case any of the reg
ular members are compelled to re
tire from the contest on account of
injuries, will not materially weaken
the eleven. The coaches and train
ers have devoted much time to the
Freshmen, and they will enter to
morrow's contest prepared to play
the best game of which they are
capable.
There is no great difference in
the ability of the Freshman line and
back-field, and if Stanford wins to
morrow the result will be due to
the combined team-work of the
whole eleven. While the 1908
team has no such stars as Weller
and Stott, it lacks the weak places
which were so marked in the Fresh
man line-up last year. Star plays
by individuals have been discour
aged by the coaches, and the
marked ability of the whole team
to get into each play has been a
feature of the last week of practice.
Another valuable point developed
during the last weeks of practice is
the speed with which the plays are
executed by the Freshman team.
Every man is in his place as soon
as the signal is given, and not a
player ceases lighting until the ball
is declared down.
Coach Lanagan had the follow
ing to say concerning the chances
of the Stanford Freshmen against
California in to-morrow's game:
"The Freshmen have a hard game
before them and they must play

their best ball if they hope to win
Saturday. Having had little to
do with the Freshman team, and
not having seen the California
freshmen play, I have had little op
portunity to compare the work of
the two teams, but from current re
ports I am satisfied that the game
to-morrow will be a close, hard con
test."
Assistant Coach Hauverman,who
has had full charge of the Fresh
man squad this season, expects the
team to gain a victory from Cali
fornia Saturday. He expressed
himself as follows: "If the Fresh
men play the ball that have
showed themselves capable of in
the last week's practice, victory is
assured to them in the contest to
morrow. Although the team this
year possesses no such stars as Wel
ler and Stott of the 1907 Freshmen,
the eleven is very evenly balanced,
and will depend on concerted team
work rather than individual play
ingtogain againsttheheavy Califor
nia aggregation. The line is com
paratively light, but what it lacks
in weight is made up in speed and
aggressiveness. Stanford will rely
on straight football to win to-mor
row's game."
"Dad" Moulton predicts victory
for the '08 team in the following
terms: "If condition counts for any
thing we ought to win the game
Saturday, for the Freshmen are in
as good physical condition as ath
letes can expect to be without the
aid of a training-table. Although
there has been a large number of
men injured during the season,
none of the candidates have shirked
their work, and they are as gritty
a lot of fighters as I have ever had
the pleasure of training. I have
every reason to believe that Stan
ford rooters will dance the serpen
tine on California's new field to
morrow."
The end positions will be played
by Wilson and Overman, two men
w.ho have played steady games
throughout the season, and al
though they have stood out promi
nently above the other candidates
for their positions they have never
theless worked as hard for their
places as have any men on the
team. Both of them are fast in
getting down on punts, and in
tackling they are accurate. In
weight Overman will just offset his
opponent, while Wilson will have
to handle a man who outweighs
him by fifteen pounds.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are at tackles.
These positions will be filled by
Horton and Tomasini, and there is
every reason to expect that with
a slight advantage in weight both
men will outplay their opponents.
Of the two players Horton is con
ceded to be the stronger. He is
not as heavy as Tomasini, but has
a better head for football. He gets
out of the line fast and is good at
carrying the ball. The team relies
upon Tomasini and Horton for
strong defense and it also expects
them to do a good part in advanc
ing the ball. Both of these men
have been playing with the Varsity
squad until the first of the week,
when they were transferred to the
Freshman eleven. Thus they have
had the advantage of Coach Lana
gan's instructions besides the valu
able opportunity for experience of
fered in the preliminary Varsity
games.
The positions which have given
the most trouble to the coaches are
the guards. For these places there
are no exceptionally strong players
and the men who will first play
the guards to-morrow have been
selected from a number of candi
dates who have showed about equal
ability, and although they are
probably up to the average for a
Freshman eleven, none of them
have distinguished themselves as
being more than mediocre. Sum
ner, who will play right guard, is
essentially a back-field man. He
has shown an excellent spirit
throughout the season, has worked
hard, and in view of the fact that
he has not played the position be
fore, he has shown up remarkably
well. Clay, at left guard, is lack
ing in snap, and if his opponent is
fast the position will be a vulner
able point. However, if Gay plays
as he has been coached he ought to
be able to stop any attempt of the
California backs to gain through
his position. Both Sumner and
Gay will be outweighed several
pounds by their opponents.
Coe, at center, won his position
on his speed and accuracy in pass
ing the ball. He has had consider
able previous experience at the
Portland Academy and at Belmont,
playing center on both of those
teams. He will be an even match
for Allen of the California eleven.
Quarter-back Fenton, who was
yesterday elected captain of the
Freshman team, is the youngest
and lightest man in the line-up.
He weighs but 121 pounds and is
seventeen years old. He comes
from the Portland Academy, where
he has played both quarter- and
half-back. He will give the sig
nals in to-morrow's game and will
also do the punting. Although
lacking in form, his punting is un
usually speedy. He uses good
judgment in directing the plays,
and with the exception of uncer

tainty in catching punts plays a
remarkable game in the back-field.
Of the other men behind the
line Cadwalader and Vandervoort
will play halves. The former
came to Stanford with a bril
liant record and has lived up
to it in every preliminary game
he haß entered. He is a good
running back and is valuable on
defense. He will work with Fen
ton in handling punts. Vander
voort is a first-class line-bucking
Freshman back. He plays a hard,
steady game and can be relied upon
to advance the ball at critical
periods in the game.
Moody, the full-back, comes from
Belmont, where he played with
much success. He has shown a
fine spirit on the Stanford field and
is regarded as a cool, heady player
in offense and a valuable man in
backing up the line.
Much credit is due to the men
who will substitute. All of them
have been worthy rivals to the men
who will enter the game first.
Their names and the positions
which they will be ready to fill are:
YV. Ivoerner. end or tackle; A. B.
Cocks, guard; Myers, center; A. L.
Kearne, quarter; K. A. Kocher,
half-back; J. R. Pemberton, full
back.
A bus will be at Encina gym
nasium at 9 in the morning to take
the team to the train. They will
leave on the regular 9:45 train for
San Francisco, accompanied by the
University band. The game will
be called* at 2:30, on the new ath
letic field at the University of Cali
fornia. Bleachers have been erected
with a capacity for 8,000 spectators.
Those who will serve as officials at
the game are the following: C. M.
Fickert, '98, referee; Percy Hall, U.
C., umpire; J. T. Nourse, '00, and
I. J. Mumn, U. C., linemen; D. E.
Brown, '97, and William Powell, U.
C., timekeepers.

them to do a good part in advanc
ing the ball. Both of these men
have been playing with the Varsity
squad until the first of the week,
when they were transferred to the
Freshman eleven. Thus they have
had the advantage of Coach Lana
gan's instructions besides the valu
able opportunity for experience of
fered in the preliminary Varsity
games.
The positions which have given
the most trouble to the coaches are
the guards. For these places there
are no exceptionally strong players
and the men who will first play
the guards to-morrow have been
selected from a number of candi
dates who have showed about equal
ability, and although they are
probably up to the average for a
Freshman eleven, none of them
have distinguished themselves as
being more than mediocre. Sum
ner, who will play right guard, is
essentially a back-field man. He
has shown an excellent spirit
throughout the season, has worked
hard, and in view of the fact that
he has not played the position be
fore, he has shown up remarkably
well. Clay, at left guard, is lack
ing in snap, and if his opponent is
fast the position will be a vulner
able point. However, if Gay plays
as he has been coached he ought to
be able to stop any attempt of the
California backs to gain through
his position. Both Sumner and
Gay will be outweighed several
pounds by their opponents.
Coe, at center, won his position
on his speed and accuracy in pass
ing the ball. He has had consider
able previous experience at the
Portland Academy and at Belmont,
playing center on both of those
teams. He will be an even match
for Allen of the California eleven.
Quarter-back Fenton, who was
yesterday elected captain of the
Freshman team, is the youngest
and lightest man in the line-up.
He weighs but 121 pounds and is
seventeen years old. He comes
from the Portland Academy, where
he has played both quarter- and
half-back. He will give the sig
nals in to-morrow's game and will
also do the punting. Although
lacking in form, his punting is un
usually speedy. He uses good
judgment in directing the plays,
and with the exception of uncer

tainty in catching punts plays a
remarkable game in the back-field.
Of the other men behind the
line Cadwalader and Vandervoort
will play halves. The former
came to Stanford with a bril
liant record and has lived up
to it in every preliminary game
he haß entered. He is a good
running back and is valuable on
defense. He will work with Fen
ton in handling punts. Vander
voort is a first-class line-bucking
Freshman back. He plays a hard,
steady game and can be relied upon
to advance the ball at critical
periods in the game.
Moody, the full-back, comes from
Belmont, where he played with
much success. He has shown a
fine spirit on the Stanford field and
is regarded as a cool, heady player
in offense and a valuable man in
backing up the line.
Much credit is due to the men
who will substitute. All of them
have been worthy rivals to the men
who will enter the game first.
Their names and the positions
which they will be ready to fill are:
YV. Ivoerner. end or tackle; A. B.
Cocks, guard; Myers, center; A. L.
Kearne, quarter; K. A. Kocher,
half-back; J. R. Pemberton, full
back.
A bus will be at Encina gym

the team to the train. They will
leave on the regular 9:45 train for
San Francisco, accompanied by the
University band. The game will
be called* at 2:30, on the new ath

The merits of the 1908 team are
now ready to be tested in the eleventh
annual intercollegiate Freshman
game with the University of Cali
fornia. The playing of the Stan
ford Freshmen in the preliminary
games has been extremely erratic,
but during the last week the team
has rounded into shape, and is now
playing consistent ball. The final
selection of the team by the coaches
meets with general approval.
Some of the candidates so narrowly
missed making the team that their
substitutes, in case any of the reg
ular members are compelled to re
tire from the contest on account of
injuries, will not materially weaken
the eleven. The coaches and train
ers have devoted much time to the
Freshmen, and they will enter to
morrow's contest prepared to play
the best game of which they are
capable.
There is no great difference in
the ability of the Freshman line and
back-field, and if Stanford wins to
morrow the result will be due to
the combined team-work of the
whole eleven. While the 1908
team has no such stars as Weller
and Stott, it lacks the weak places
which were so marked in the Fresh
man line-up last year. Star plays
by individuals have been discour
aged by the coaches, and the
marked ability of the whole team
to get into each play has been a
feature of the last week of practice.
Another valuable point developed
during the last weeks of practice is
the speed with which the plays are
executed by the Freshman team.
Every man is in his place as soon
as the signal is given, and not a
player ceases lighting until the ball
is declared down.
Coach Lanagan had the follow
ing to say concerning the chances
of the Stanford Freshmen against
California in to-morrow's game:
"The Freshmen have a hard game
before them and they must play

their best ball if they hope to win
Saturday. Having had little to
do with the Freshman team, and
not having seen the California
freshmen play, I have had little op
portunity to compare the work of
the two teams, but from current re
ports I am satisfied that the game
to-morrow will be a close, hard con
test."
Assistant Coach Hauverman,who
has had full charge of the Fresh
man squad this season, expects the
team to gain a victory from Cali
fornia Saturday. He expressed
himself as follows: "If the Fresh
men play the ball that have
showed themselves capable of in
the last week's practice, victory is
assured to them in the contest to
morrow. Although the team this
year possesses no such stars as Wel
ler and Stott of the 1907 Freshmen,
the eleven is very evenly balanced,
and will depend on concerted team
work rather than individual play
ingtogain againsttheheavy Califor
nia aggregation. The line is com
paratively light, but what it lacks
in weight is made up in speed and
aggressiveness. Stanford will rely
on straight football to win to-mor
row's game."
"Dad" Moulton predicts victory
for the '08 team in the following
terms: "If condition counts for any
thing we ought to win the game
Saturday, for the Freshmen are in
as good physical condition as ath
letes can expect to be without the
aid of a training-table. Although
there has been a large number of
men injured during the season,
none of the candidates have shirked
their work, and they are as gritty
a lot of fighters as I have ever had
the pleasure of training. I have
every reason to believe that Stan
ford rooters will dance the serpen
tine on California's new field to
morrow."
The end positions will be played
by Wilson and Overman, two men
w.ho have played steady games
throughout the season, and al
though they have stood out promi
nently above the other candidates
for their positions they have never
theless worked as hard for their
places as have any men on the
team. Both of them are fast in
getting down on punts, and in
tackling they are accurate. In
weight Overman will just offset his
opponent, while Wilson will have
to handle a man who outweighs
him by fifteen pounds.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are at tackles.
These positions will be filled by
Horton and Tomasini, and there is
every reason to expect that with
a slight advantage in weight both
men will outplay their opponents.
Of the two players Horton is con
ceded to be the stronger. He is
not as heavy as Tomasini, but has
a better head for football. He gets
out of the line fast and is good at
carrying the ball. The team relies
upon Tomasini and Horton for
strong defense and it also expects
them to do a good part in advanc
ing the ball. Both of these men
have been playing with the Varsity
squad until the first of the week,
when they were transferred to the
Freshman eleven. Thus they have
had the advantage of Coach Lana
gan's instructions besides the valu
able opportunity for experience of

ular members are compelled to re
tire from the contest on account of
injuries, will not materially weaken
the eleven. The coaches and train
ers have devoted much time to the
Freshmen, and they will enter to
morrow's contest prepared to play
the best game of which they are
capable.
There is no great difference in
the ability of the Freshman line and
back-field, and if Stanford wins to
morrow the result will be due to
the combined team-work of the
whole eleven. While the 1908
team has no such stars as Weller
and Stott, it lacks the weak places
which were so marked in the Fresh
man line-up last year. Star plays
by individuals have been discour
aged by the coaches, and the
marked ability of the whole team
to get into each play has been a
feature of the last week of practice.
Another valuable point developed
during the last weeks of practice is
the speed with which the plays are
executed by the Freshman team.
Every man is in his place as soon
as the signal is given, and not a
player ceases lighting until the ball
is declared down.
Coach Lanagan had the follow
ing to say concerning the chances
of the Stanford Freshmen against
California in to-morrow's game:
"The Freshmen have a hard game
before them and they must play

their best ball if they hope to win
Saturday. Having had little to
do with the Freshman team, and
not having seen the California
freshmen play, I have had little op
portunity to compare the work of
the two teams, but from current re
ports I am satisfied that the game
to-morrow will be a close, hard con
test."
Assistant Coach Hauverman,who
has had full charge of the Fresh
man squad this season, expects the
team to gain a victory from Cali
fornia Saturday. He expressed
himself as follows: "If the Fresh
men play the ball that have
showed themselves capable of in
the last week's practice, victory is
assured to them in the contest to
morrow. Although the team this
year possesses no such stars as Wel
ler and Stott of the 1907 Freshmen,
the eleven is very evenly balanced,
and will depend on concerted team
work rather than individual play
ingtogain againsttheheavy Califor
nia aggregation. The line is com
paratively light, but what it lacks
in weight is made up in speed and
aggressiveness. Stanford will rely
on straight football to win to-mor
row's game."
"Dad" Moulton predicts victory
for the '08 team in the following
terms: "If condition counts for any
thing we ought to win the game
Saturday, for the Freshmen are in
as good physical condition as ath
letes can expect to be without the
aid of a training-table. Although
there has been a large number of
men injured during the season,
none of the candidates have shirked
their work, and they are as gritty
a lot of fighters as I have ever had
the pleasure of training. I have
every reason to believe that Stan
ford rooters will dance the serpen
tine on California's new field to
morrow."
The end positions will be played
by Wilson and Overman, two men
w.ho have played steady games
throughout the season, and al
though they have stood out promi
nently above the other candidates
for their positions they have never
theless worked as hard for their
places as have any men on the
team. Both of them are fast in
getting down on punts, and in
tackling they are accurate. In
weight Overman will just offset his
opponent, while Wilson will have
to handle a man who outweighs
him by fifteen pounds.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are at tackles.
These positions will be filled by
Horton and Tomasini, and there is
every reason to expect that with
a slight advantage in weight both
men will outplay their opponents.
Of the two players Horton is con
ceded to be the stronger. He is
not as heavy as Tomasini, but has
a better head for football. He gets
out of the line fast and is good at
carrying the ball. The team relies
upon Tomasini and Horton for
strong defense and it also expects
them to do a good part in advanc
ing the ball. Both of these men
have been playing with the Varsity
squad until the first of the week,
when they were transferred to the
Freshman eleven. Thus they have
had the advantage of Coach Lana
gan's instructions besides the valu
able opportunity for experience of
fered in the preliminary Varsity
games.
The positions which have given
the most trouble to the coaches are
the guards. For these places there
are no exceptionally strong players
and the men who will first play
the guards to-morrow have been
selected from a number of candi
dates who have showed about equal
ability, and although they are
probably up to the average for a
Freshman eleven, none of them
have distinguished themselves as
being more than mediocre. Sum
ner, who will play right guard, is
essentially a back-field man. He
has shown an excellent spirit
throughout the season, has worked
hard, and in view of the fact that
he has not played the position be
fore, he has shown up remarkably
well. Clay, at left guard, is lack
ing in snap, and if his opponent is
fast the position will be a vulner
able point. However, if Gay plays
as he has been coached he ought to
be able to stop any attempt of the
California backs to gain through
his position. Both Sumner and
Gay will be outweighed several
pounds by their opponents.
Coe, at center, won his position
on his speed and accuracy in pass
ing the ball. He has had consider
able previous experience at the
Portland Academy and at Belmont,
playing center on both of those
teams. He will be an even match
for Allen of the California eleven.
Quarter-back Fenton, who was
yesterday elected captain of the
Freshman team, is the youngest
and lightest man in the line-up.
He weighs but 121 pounds and is
seventeen years old. He comes
from the Portland Academy, where
he has played both quarter- and
half-back. He will give the sig
nals in to-morrow's game and will
also do the punting. Although
lacking in form, his punting is un
usually speedy. He uses good
judgment in directing the plays,
and with the exception of uncer

tainty in catching punts plays a
remarkable game in the back-field.
Of the other men behind the
line Cadwalader and Vandervoort
will play halves. The former
came to Stanford with a bril
liant record and has lived up
to it in every preliminary game
he haß entered. He is a good
running back and is valuable on
defense. He will work with Fen
ton in handling punts. Vander
voort is a first-class line-bucking
Freshman back. He plays a hard,
steady game and can be relied upon
to advance the ball at critical
periods in the game.
Moody, the full-back, comes from
Belmont, where he played with
much success. He has shown a
fine spirit on the Stanford field and
is regarded as a cool, heady player
in offense and a valuable man in
backing up the line.
Much credit is due to the men
who will substitute. All of them
have been worthy rivals to the men
who will enter the game first.
Their names and the positions
which they will be ready to fill are:
YV. Ivoerner. end or tackle; A. B.
Cocks, guard; Myers, center; A. L.
Kearne, quarter; K. A. Kocher,
half-back; J. R. Pemberton, full
back.
A bus will be at Encina gym
nasium at 9 in the morning to take
the team to the train. They will
leave on the regular 9:45 train for
San Francisco, accompanied by the
University band. The game will
be called* at 2:30, on the new ath
letic field at the University of Cali
fornia. Bleachers have been erected
with a capacity for 8,000 spectators.
Those who will serve as officials at
the game are the following: C. M.
Fickert, '98, referee; Percy Hall, U.

The merits of the 1908 team are
now ready to be tested in the eleventh
annual intercollegiate Freshman
game with the University of Cali
fornia. The playing of the Stan
ford Freshmen in the preliminary
games has been extremely erratic,
but during the last week the team
has rounded into shape, and is now
playing consistent ball. The final
selection of the team by the coaches
meets with general approval.
Some of the candidates so narrowly
missed making the team that their
substitutes, in case any of the reg
ular members are compelled to re
tire from the contest on account of
injuries, will not materially weaken
the eleven. The coaches and train
ers have devoted much time to the
Freshmen, and they will enter to
