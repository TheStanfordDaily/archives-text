The merits of the 1908 team are
now ready to be tested in the eleventh
annual intercollegiate Freshman
game with the University of Cali
fornia. The playing of the Stan
ford Freshmen in the preliminary
games has been extremely erratic,
but during the last week the team
has rounded into shape, and is now
playing consistent ball. The final
selection of the team by the coaches
meets with general approval.
Some of the candidates so narrowly
missed making the team that their
substitutes, in case any of the reg
ular members are compelled to re
tire from the contest on account of
injuries, will not materially weaken
the eleven. The coaches and train
ers have devoted much time to the
Freshmen, and they will enter to
morrow's contest prepared to play
the best game of which they are
capable.
There is no great difference in
the ability of the Freshman line and
back-field, and if Stanford wins to
morrow the result will be due to
the combined team-work of the
whole eleven. While the 1908
team has no such stars as Weller
and Stott, it lacks the weak places
which were so marked in the Fresh
man line-up last year. Star plays
by individuals have been discour
aged by the coaches, and the
marked ability of the whole team
to get into each play has been a
feature of the last week of practice.
Another valuable point developed
during the last weeks of practice is
the speed with which the plays are
executed by the Freshman team.
Every man is in his place as soon
as the signal is given, and not a
player ceases lighting until the ball
is declared down.
Coach Lanagan had the follow
ing to say concerning the chances
of the Stanford Freshmen against
California in to-morrow's game:
"The Freshmen have a hard game
before them and they must play

their best ball if they hope to win
Saturday. Having had little to
do with the Freshman team, and
not having seen the California
freshmen play, I have had little op
portunity to compare the work of
the two teams, but from current re
ports I am satisfied that the game
to-morrow will be a close, hard con
test."
Assistant Coach Hauverman,who
has had full charge of the Fresh
man squad this season, expects the
team to gain a victory from Cali
fornia Saturday. He expressed
himself as follows: "If the Fresh
men play the ball that have
showed themselves capable of in
the last week's practice, victory is
assured to them in the contest to
morrow. Although the team this
year possesses no such stars as Wel
ler and Stott of the 1907 Freshmen,
the eleven is very evenly balanced,
and will depend on concerted team
work rather than individual play
ingtogain againsttheheavy Califor
nia aggregation. The line is com
paratively light, but what it lacks
in weight is made up in speed and
aggressiveness. Stanford will rely
on straight football to win to-mor
row's game."
"Dad" Moulton predicts victory
for the '08 team in the following
terms: "If condition counts for any
thing we ought to win the game
Saturday, for the Freshmen are in
as good physical condition as ath
letes can expect to be without the
aid of a training-table. Although
there has been a large number of
men injured during the season,
none of the candidates have shirked
their work, and they are as gritty
a lot of fighters as I have ever had
the pleasure of training. I have
every reason to believe that Stan
ford rooters will dance the serpen
tine on California's new field to
morrow."
