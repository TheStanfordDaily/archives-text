To the Freshman football team
we wish to say that on the eve of
the first intercollegiate athletic con
test of the year, the result of which
depends on you, the student body
U behind you heart and soul.
Whatever shortcomings you have
shown during the season have been
largely weeded out by a thoroughly
good system of coaching. There is
much confidence placed in your
ability. It is generally believed
that you are going to win the game
to-morrow, and you have got to do
it. You have a fast, well trained
team that will pull together and
carry your adversaries down the
Held before you. Let every one of
you get into the game for all he is
worth at the very first blow of the
whistle, and the outcome will take
care of itself. Upon you rests the
responsibility of saying whether or
not the athletic year will start out
with a victory or a defeat. The
student body and every member of
the University community expects
you to win the game. You are rep
resentatives not only of your class
but of the whole University. Your
University is awaiting the result of
the contest with no little anxiety.
You must win the game; and fur
thermore, you must win it by play
ing straightforward football.
