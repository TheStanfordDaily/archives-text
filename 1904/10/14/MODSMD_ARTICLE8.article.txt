The Stanford Alumnus in its new
form is a decided improvement over
anything that lias been attempted
by past editors. If the standard
set by the first issue is continued
throughout the year there ought to
be no question about tlie success of
the paper. The editor lias intro
duced so many new ideas in the
present magazine, and lias made it
such an attractive publication, that
the alumni of the University will
find it a most valuable source for
information about Stanford. In a
concise and interesting manner are
told the current happenings ih stu
dent activities, and the present
status of the buildings, and other
progress of the University. The
magazine, as it now appears, is the
result of hard work and great sac

rifice on the part of the editor and
manager. They ask for no pecuni
ary reward, hut they rightfully ex
pect that their effort will hear fruit
in the form of appreciation by those
whom they have tried to serve. It
therefore rests with the members of
the Alumni Association to give the
magazine the unanimous support of
its members â€”a support that the
paper justly merits.
