I is for Iris,
Blue, black, brown or gray,
From an excess of light,
It stands guarding the way.
The irin is the delicate membrane sur
rounding the pupil. It gives the eye its
distinctive colors—blue, black, brown,
etc. Its function is to control the
quantity of light which •liters the eye.
In a bright light its muscles contract
and the pupils become smaller, while in
a dim light the muscles relax and the
pupil is enlarged.
The old time method of eye testing
required the use of a drug which par
alyzed these muscles. This treatment
resulted in much discomfort, loss of time
and a considerable expense.
Modern methods, as practiced by us,
make it possible to correct all defects of
vision without recourse to drugs.
Many people who come to us seem to
expect to pay more for glasses than they
have paid elsewhere, and often express
surprise that we charge no more than
the usual prices.
It don't cost us any more to do good
work than it would to do the other kind.
It won't cost you any more to get it.
