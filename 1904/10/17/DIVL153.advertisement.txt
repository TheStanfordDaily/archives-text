Away
From
Home
away from the tender, solicitous care
of Mother—at school—studying hard,
exercising harder, accidents will some
times happen. If at home, mother
would use Pond's Extract—the old family
doctor— and the paiu would soon vanish
—the injury soon heal. For over 00
years mothers have eased pains and
healed wounds, burns and bruises with
Pond's Extract and have never been
disappointed In it. There is no remedy
which will take its place—no substitute.
Keep a bottle handy for
quick use. Soothes and
freshens the face after
shaving. Watered
Witch Hazel—a weak
solution— sometimes
ofFered in place of
Pond's Extract—has no
medicinal value—is
positively worthies s.
Pond's Extract CURES,
therefore is priceless.
Solel only in sealed bot
tles under buff wrapper.
