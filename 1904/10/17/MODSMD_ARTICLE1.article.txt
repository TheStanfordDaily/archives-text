# TRACK MEET.
## Try-out Preliminary to Pacific Coast Championship Games at Portland Exposition. 
### 
As a result of the revival of inter
est in track and field spurts created
by the Olympic games at St. Louis,
the eyes of Pacific Coast athletes
are now turned toward Portland,
where the various coast Champion
ships will be held at the Lewis and
Clark Exposition. Director-Gen
eral Goode has promised President
Hinchman of the Pacific Athletic
Association that the control of the
games will he entirely in the hands
of the association. This will be a
great chance for California ama
teurs, for the trip to Portland will
be comparatively inexpensive, and
it is the intention of the Pacific
Athletic Association to see that this
state is well represented in every
branch of sport, especially track
and field events. With this end in
view a handicap meet as a prelim
inary try-out will he held on the
University of California oval next
Saturday.
Athletes from all over the stale
are displaying great interest in the
projected meet, and a large entry
list is already assured. Track men
of both universities have been doing
light fall training for several weeks,
and a number of them will take
this opportunity to show what they
can do. It will he an excellent
chance for the new material in each
college to tryout, and it is probable
that the track captains will urge
their freshmen to enter the meet.
N. E. Dole, '04, A. E. Plaw of
California, C. Hall of Oakland
high school, the junior American
high jump champion, are among
the entries. Miller, '08, who won
the mile in last year's P. A. A.
meet, and E. C. Cope, '08, the Aca
demic League champion sprinter,
have signified their intention of
competing in Saturday's meet. The
coming field-day will be one of
three or four which the association
will hold.
