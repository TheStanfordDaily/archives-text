Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
Is it permissable for anyone who
has not won his "S" to wear one of
the enclosed kind [block letter Var
sity emblem] on his plug? Will
you please answer this through
your columns as early as possible.
A Junior.
To the above inquiry we can say
that the general sentiment is against
the wearing of the Varsity emblem
in any shape, manner, or form by
anyone who has not earned it in an
intercollegiate contest. The block
"S" is not a common mark of the
University, but it is a design adop
{ ted by the student body, and given
;as a reward to those who have
rserved their college in athletics, de
bate, or some other student activity.
|No man or woman who has not
| earned it should be permitted to
| wear it on a plug, or a watch fob,
on a lapel button, or any where else.
The Varsity emblem, to mean what
it should menu and to stand forth
| as a reward «>f merit, cannot be too
highly regarded. Now that the
! question has arisen squa rely it would
! seem that the Athletic Committee
: might take some definite action on
the matter /is was the case with the
removal from the campus view of
all preparatory school sweaters.
The fact that the Varsity emblem
lias been worn on pings and in
other ways in the past by men who
have not been entitled to the privi
lege affords no excuse for further
abu-e of the l>lock "S.'' We must
an>wer the inquiry in the negative.'
