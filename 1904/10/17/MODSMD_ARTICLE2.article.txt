# New "Chaparral" Issued.
## 
### 
The fourth number of the Cha}>-
arral was put on sale to-day. Chap
pie has the usual number of good
jokes and bad ones, not the least of
which is the presentation of a <;col
ored supplement." The best fea
ture of the issue is a portrait by
Snodgrass of "The Czar," a well
known Eticina character. With
the exception of a few remarks
about the singing and yelling at
the football practice and games, the
editorial comments are of very
doubtful value. The editor has
considerable advice to give to the
newspaper correspondents, but in
the particular case he cites his crit
icisms are entirely unjust, as in
quiry would have shown him. The
timeliness of his third editorial is
very questionable.
