# STANFORD WINS FRESHMAN GAME.
## Brilliant Victory Gained Over California's Heavy First-Year Eleven by Plucky Cardinal Teamâ€”Score 6 to 5. 
### 
The eleventh intercollegiate Fresh
man football game has been played,
and the number of annual victories
which Stanford has scored is now
raised from six to seven. Al
though the Cardinal team was far
outweighed at almost every position,
the player made up for that disad
vantage in spirit and head work.
Every man on the team fought for
all that was in him, and it was that
spirit of determination,coupled with
the ability of individual players to
rise to emergencies, that won the
game for Stanford. When the two
teams first came on the field the
California players towered above
the Stanford eleven so much in
size that it seemed impossible that
the resulting victory could be the
final outcome. Hut California
lacked a heady general. Her line
was heavy, her backs were fast and
weighty, but there was lacking the
knowledge of the game which was
necessary to direct the plays effec
tively.
Just where California was weak
Stanford was strong, and to the
head work of Captain Kenton may
be attributed the success attained
by the team. His generalship was
all that could be hoped for, his
punting was far superior to that
of his opponent, and his hurdling
and back-field work were the most
spectacular features of the game.
The game being a punting contest
offered little opportunity for the
Stanford backs to advance the ball,
but it gave them much chance for
defensive work, and in thai branch
of the game ti e Stanford back-field
proved equal to their rivals. On
several occasions after the Stanford
line had been penetrated by the
heavy California backs the buck
was stopped by the combined ef
forts of the back-field. Although
he was only given the ball a few
times, Vandervoort managed to
make a short gain each time.
Moody made two sensational
tackles during the progress of the
game by getting the California
runner back of the line. Sperry
made several attempts to run the
end of the Stanford line, defended
by Tomasini and Overman, but
was thrown back for a. loss each
time. Golcher. who played right
half after Snowden had retired
from the game, made three good
gains around Stanford's left end.
The weakest part of the team, how
ever, was the center trio, the great
est number of yards made by Cali
fornia being gained on straight
plunges by her heavy backs. The
California guards were heavier, and
for the most part faster than their
opponents. Although outclassed,
Gav and Sumner fought desper
ately and managed to hold several
times when a gain might have
meant a touch-down for California.
Coe and Myers both passed the
ball well, and their defensive work
was good. Horton was pitted
against California's best tackle,
but he managed to hold his own

without much difficulty. Wilson
played a good game at left end, and
I with his teammate Overman ran
down under the punts in much
better form than their California
opponents. Koerner, who replaced
Wilson, played a reliable game.
Cadwalader was injured in his ef
forts to stop the bucks through the
Stanford center, and had to give
way to Kocher, who filled his place
very acceptably. Cocks, who took
(jay's place at left guard, played
an aggressive game.
The legality of the play which
j immediately preceded the second
1 touch down was disputed, but the
ball was finally awarded to Stan
ford. The decision on the field
J Saturday was final, and no agree
ment by the coaches can change
the result of the game, no matter
what the ultimate ruling made by
the rules committee may be.
California won the toss and
elected to defend the south goal.
Tomasini kicked off to California's
10-vard line, and the ball was run
in for 20 yards by Kendall. Fenton
at this juncture hit the interference
Iso hard that be was laid out, and
! did not recover his best form until
the first touch down was made.
Riley punted to the middle of the
field, and the punt was immediately
returned by Fenton to Sperry, who
ran in for 12 yards. California at
tempted a straight buck and Stan
ford got the ball on a fumble. After
another series of punts the ball
was in California's possession on
Stanford's 40-yard line. Sperry
cross-bucked for 2 yards, and Riley
and Snowden each made 3 yards on
straight bucks. The three Califor
nia backs continued to hammer the
Stanford line until the ball was on
the 11-yard line. Here Stanford
held, and California was compelled
to surrender the ball on downs.
1 Fenton made a poor punt to the 30-
! yard line, which was run in 5 yards
by Sperry. Another series of punts
j ensued, and ended by California
I obtaining possession of the ball on
!a fumble. Snowden and Riley
j made 5 yards on straight bucks, but
two attempts to run the Stanford
ends proved unsuccessful, and the
ball was gained by Stanford on
downs. Fenton punted, and the
kick was returned by Riley. Fen
! ton tried a quarter-back run, but
! the line did not hold, and he was
| tackled for a loss. Fenton punted,
but the hall was blocked by Riley,
j who fell on it back of the line, scor
ing 5 points for California after
fifteen minutes of play. Richardson
failed to kick a difficult goal.
Stanford kicked off to California's
j 30-yard line. Riley punted to the
middle of the field. Cadwalader
I failed on an end run, and Vander
| voort made 3 yards on the same
play. Fenton punted to California.
Kendall signaled for a fake kick,
but no one received the pass, and
it rolled to California's 10-yard line.
Both teams continued to punt fre-
