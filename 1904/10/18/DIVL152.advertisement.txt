If you want your full
At the first sign of failure
Give your eyes proper care.
There is no other one thing which
brings so much pleasure to the aged as
good vision. As the years go on we lose
our interest in the activities of life and
rind our greatest pleasure in the reading
of good books and papers.
The old people who enjoy the best
vision are those who have given their
eyes proper care in youth and middle
age.
It is a mistake to try to put off the
wearing of glasses. At the lirst sign of
failure the eyes should be carefully ex
amined and the glasses given that will
overcome the strain.
Thus the vision may be preserved in
most cases as long as the other faculties.
Save yourself from regret by having
your eyes cared for here. It may be
easier now than later.
