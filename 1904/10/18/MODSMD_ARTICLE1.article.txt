# SPROTT PLAYING AGAIN.
## Varsity Squad Strengthened by Appearance on Field of Brilliant Tackle. 
### 
\V. K. Sprott, '06, who has played
the left tackle position in two inter
collegiate games, appeared on the
gridiron this afternoon for the first
time tliis season. The task of de
veloping a good line has been the
chief problem confronting the
coaches, and the addition of Sprott
at this time will aid materially in
solving the difficulty. Sprott's de
termination to plav will probably
result in Lanagan's retaining
Shields at center, where he is more
urgently needed than at his former
tackle position. Football experts
agree that Sprott is one of the best
tackles now playing the game on
this Coast, and it is expected that
he will regain his old place on the
team without much difficulty.
Most of the men who have been
out of the game on account of
injuries and illness appeared for
practice Monday evening. West,
who has been suffering from water
on the knee, is again playing.
Chalmers, who did not play in the
last preliminary game because of a
bruised muscle, is now fully recov
ered and ready for hard scrimmage
work. C. E. Hyde recovered from
a severe attack of water on the knee,
and will appear in the line-up
to-night. W. H. Dole and Roose
velt are rapidly rounding into
form, and both players will be able
to stand heavy scrimmage work
before the Nevada game. Weller
has been threatened with water on
the knee, but prompt measures of
relief, which included three days of
absolute rest,have obviated anydan
ger of an immediate recurrence of
the trouble. As the date of the
intercollegiate game approaches the
coaches will take every precaution
to save the players from injury.
Any player who shows even the
slightest indication of an injury
will be kept out of the game until
he is fully recovered.
Only three members of the Fresh
man squad appeared on the field
last night. Tomasini and Horton
are both heavy enough for Varsity
positions, and they both stand a
chance of making the team. Fen
ton was out last night, but has
since decided to discontinue prac
tice.
In last night's practice Lanagan
took charge of the first division
while Hauverman directed the work
of the second squad. During the
first part of the practice period both
squads alternated at falling on the
ball and working on the tackling
bag. No regular scrimmage work
was held, but two lines were op
posed to each other in an endeavor
to block punts. \V. H. Dole and
Macdonald did the punting. The
work of the ends, in getting down
under the punts, was faster and
surer than usual.
