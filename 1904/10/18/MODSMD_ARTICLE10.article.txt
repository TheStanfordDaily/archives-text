Before the members of the Fresh
man football team decide definitely
upon the kind of sweater and nu
merals that they want, to wear, it
may be well to suggest that the vari
ations in class football sweaters
which have taken place in the past
have been far from satisfactory. This
would seem to be a case where uni
formity is a very desirable thing.
For a number of years the classes
were forced to buy the football
sweaters for their Freshmen out of
class funds, but during the past
three years the student body treas
ury has supplied the purchase
money. Until last year the em
blem which designated a Freshman
football player was a regulation
carninal sweater bearing large class
numerals in white. Last year the
Freshmen changed to red sweater
vests with small numerals. The
results of such changes, if contin
ued, will be a conglomeration of
numerals so varied that no one will
be able to distinguish between the
different emblems, and know for
just what branches of athletics they
stand. This matter ought to be
taken up by the Athletic Commit
tee and passed upon for all time to
come. Since the student body pays
for the sweaters, it has the privilege
of saying what design shall appear
upon them. And then the advent
of intercollegiate Freshman boating
and baseball makes it even more
urgent that some regulation gov
erning first-year emblems in thene
sports be defined absolutely. The
cardinal sweater with large numer
als should be continued for Fresh
man football players. The white
sweater with large red numerals
seems to be an appropriate design
for the Freshman crew. Some other
distinctive combination should soon
be adopted for those who partici
pate in the intercollegiate Fresh
man baseball games, the first of
which will be played during the
present college year.
