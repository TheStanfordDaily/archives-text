spending over $13,000 in improving
its athletic field.
—About 175 men have handed
in their names for fall track work
at Harvard, and practice lias been
held daily since October 4th.
—Two dormitories are now un
der course of construction at Colum
bia University. They will be nine
stories high and will contain 303
rooms.
—The new $400,000 gymnasium
of the University of Pennsylvania
is now practically finished and will
soon be ready for use by the stu
dents.
—Dr. Parkin, representative of
the Rhodes Scholarship Trust, states
that the qualifying examinations
for Rhodes scholarships this year
will be held sometime in January.
—Thirty-five students living in
various States of the Union, who
won the Cecil Rhodes scholarship
for a course of study at Oxford
University, recently sailed from
Boston on the steamship Ivernia
for Liverpool.
—The most important gifts to
Yale during 1904 were as follows:
$100,000 for a mining laboratory,
$50,000 to the medical school,
$40,000 to library funds, and a be
quest of $250,000 for the construc
tion and maintenance of a building
as a memorial to Dr. Jared Linsly.
—The last annual report of the
Yale financial union, which em
braces the reports of the football,
baseball, crew, track athletics and
Yale field management, showed an
expenditure in 1902-03 of $28,471
for football, $14,712 for track ath
letics and $22,600 for the mainten
ance of stands and grounds at Yale
field.
—Preliminary architect's sketches
of the new Yale library building,
for which about $250,000 was be
queathed last year by the late Wil
liam B. Ross, Yale '52, show a
skilful adaptation of the lines of
the old library building to those of
the proposed building. It was
feared by many graduates that
this beautiful old structure would
have to come down to meet the
needs of the growing library. It
now seems possible to retain intact
the wing next to Chittenden Li
brary and possibly more.
—'The influence of the Yale As
sociation of Class Secretaries is be
ing shown in the frequent an
nouncement of a new class record.
Two new records have recently ap
peared, and six records are at pres
ent in process. The delinquent
secretaries are being stirred up to
do their work and are doing it bet
ter than ever before, but there is
still plenty of room for improve
ment. Subscriptions have been
paid to the association by secre
taries of thirty-four different
classes.
