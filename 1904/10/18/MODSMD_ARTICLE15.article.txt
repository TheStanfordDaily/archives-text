# Report of County Health Officer.
## 
### 
The following extract from the
last report of William Simpson,
health officer of Santa Clara county,
is reprinted because of its bearing
on the University community:
"With the opening of the year at
Stanford there has been, as there
always will be when students have
been scattered in every direction
during vacation, some sickness, but
all cases are immediately cared for,
and no epidemic and no serious re
sults need be feared. There were
no deaths at the University the
past year. The garbage crematory
is disposing of the waste, and the
sewer with a fall of 81 feet in three
and one-half miles is ample, and
the water supply above suspicion.
The water used for irrigation from
the lake is charged with a small
amount of sulphur, making it some
what offensive, but in no way harm
ful. The death rate of Palo Alto
last year is as low as that of any
town of which I have a record, be
ing but ten to the thousand, which
is a low rate for any district, and
probably lower than that of any
town of its size outside of Califor
nia. I have looked into and re
ported specially on this because of
an unwarranted report that Palo
Alto is an unhealthy town having
come to my ears. The numbers
and causes of death are on file in
my office, and are open to inspec
tion. The deaths for the month in
this county number 33, of which 24
(a very large proportion) are males,
and 9 females. Nineteen births
were reported, 6 males and 13 fe
males. Respectfully submitted,
"William Simpson, M. D.,
"County Health Officer."
