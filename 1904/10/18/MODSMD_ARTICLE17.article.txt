# Boring Well for New Gymnasium.
## 
### 
A well is being sunk about
twenty-five feet east of the new
Gymnasium building for the pur
pose of supplying the swimming
tanks and shower baths which will
be installed. The water will be
secured by pumping, since the loca
tion here is such that artesian wells
are rarely found. The work has
already been under way ten days
and no water is yet in sight.
Progress has been unusually slow
because of the hard formations and
strata encountered. The first thirty
feet was drilled almost entirely
through rock and boulders. So far
the well has been sunk ninety feet.
Water is found in this vicinity at a

depth of from one hundred and
twenty to one hundred and seventy
five feet. At the present rate of
progress, then, water ought to be
encountered inside of a week. A
well was rendered necessary on
account of the scarcity of the good
water which is ÜBed on the campus
for house purposes.
