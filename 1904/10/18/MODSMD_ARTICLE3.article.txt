Arrangements have been made
by the Tennis Club with Treasurer
Barrett for getting the new courts
into shape at once. The two dirt
courts will not be oiled until next
June, as oiling them would stop all
practice for at least a month. How
ever, both courts have been lined
and are in very good condition at
present, and as it is the intention
of the Tennis Club to keep them
rolled and sprinkled, they should
do well without the oiling.
Besides the money which the
club will draw from its member
ship dues, Treasurer Barrett has
set aside forty dollars which is btf
ing used in improving the courts.
Two new r nets have been bought,
and steel posts are to replace the
wooden ones on the asphaltum
court.
Next semester the Tennis Club
will devote whatever surplus re
mains in the treasury after the ex
penses of the try-outs are met to
affording the members of the team
opportunities for practice. In or
der to do this it will be necessary
to bring some of the leading San
Francisco players down to the
campus, and if need to send
the team to San Francisco. It is
only by this means that it will be
possible to compete with Califor
nia on equal terms, as the Califor
nia players are constantly prac
ticing in San Francisco, and
accordingly have a decided ad
vantage.

Arrangements have been made
by the Tennis Club with Treasurer
Barrett for getting the new courts
into shape at once. The two dirt
courts will not be oiled until next
June, as oiling them would stop all
practice for at least a month. How
ever, both courts have been lined
and are in very good condition at
present, and as it is the intention
of the Tennis Club to keep them
rolled and sprinkled, they should
do well without the oiling.
Besides the money which the
club will draw from its member
ship dues, Treasurer Barrett has
set aside forty dollars which is btf
ing used in improving the courts.
Two new r nets have been bought,
and steel posts are to replace the
wooden ones on the asphaltum
court.
Next semester the Tennis Club
will devote whatever surplus re
mains in the treasury after the ex
penses of the try-outs are met to
affording the members of the team
opportunities for practice. In or
der to do this it will be necessary
to bring some of the leading San
Francisco players down to the
campus, and if need to send
the team to San Francisco. It is
only by this means that it will be
possible to compete with Califor
nia on equal terms, as the Califor
nia players are constantly prac
ticing in San Francisco, and
accordingly have a decided ad
vantage.
The Junior class tennis tourna
ment is now finished and, as was
generally expected, G. A. Hodge
proved the winner. In the semi
final match C. G. Guyer beat L. J.
Webb 6-0, 6-0. This left Guyer to
meet Hodge in the final, but Guyer
defaulted and consequently G. A.
Hodge will represent the Junior
class in the interclass tournament.
The interclass singles tournament
will take place Saturday. It has
not yet been decided whether
this will be a round-robin
or an ordinary tournament in
which one defeat will put a player
out. This week the doubles tourna
ment of the different classes will be
held to decide the teams which will
represent each class in the inter
class doubles tournament to be held
next week.
There has been a great deal of
interest manifested in these class
tournaments, and the indications
are that Stanford will be repre
sented by well-trained players in
the next intercollegiate match. G.
A. Hodge is undoubtedly the best
player in college at present. In
the Senior class tournament the
two players who have shown the
best form are A. W. Hooper and J.
Mori. These two players met in
