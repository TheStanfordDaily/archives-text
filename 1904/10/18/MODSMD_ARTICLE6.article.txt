# GREAT DEMAND FOR SEATS.
## Success of Mr. Greet as a Result of Increased Popularity of His Company. 
### 
The demand for seats for "Much
Ado About Nothing" continues
large both on the campus and in
Palo Alto, and a crowded house is
assured. The growing reputation
of Mr. Greet and his English play
ers made his recent Beason in San
Francisco even more successful
than that of last year.
This is pleasing to Mr. Greet,
who believes that the plays of
Shakßpere acted in their old simple
setting may be made both beauti
ful and attractive. It is the gen
eral testimony of those who have
seen the old plays acted in the
Elizabethan manner in England
and the Eaßt, as well as here on
the Coast, that the absence of elab
orate scenery adds to the effective
ness of the play itself. More in
terest is centered in the actors and
the action, and a little imagination
easily supplies all the background
that is needed. Often in Shak
spere a single phrase suggests as
much as a modern stage setting.
In the case of "Much Ado About
Nothing" the single piece of scenery
remains unchanged throughout the
entire play. This has been beauti
fully designed and is made effective
by means of the rare old tapestries
which Mr. Greet carries with him.
The moving of tables and chairs
and the few properties by two
stage-boys is all that is needed to
indicate a change of scene. As
there is no shifting of scenes it is
possible for the play to proceed
without the customary delays.
There are two Bhort intermissions,
but not of a nature to interfere
with the unity of effect. One re
sult of this is that the play as a
whole occupies much less time
than it would otherwise.
The picturesqueness of the play
is increased by the care which Mr.
Greet has displayed in the choice of
costumes. These represent accur
ately the dress of the men and
women in the gay court circles of
Elizabethan times.
Mr. Greet, in addition to his
company of twenty players, will
make use of several Stanford stu
dents as gentlemen and ladies of
the court, and as guards. None of
these, however, will have speaking
parts.
The English Club has arranged
for the entertainment of the actors
on the campus. Most of them will
be the guests of the fraternities and
sororities.
