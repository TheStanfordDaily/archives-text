Kis for Kryptok.
If your lenses are double,
The new Kryptok lens
Will relieve all yourtrouble.
The Kryptok "invisible" bifocal lens
is the only double or bifocal lens made
which has no objectionable features. It
is made without a line, without a break,
without a ridge to collect dust and dirt
—in short, a perfect bifocal lens.
If you need "bifocals" see us about
Kryptoks.
Our regular cement bifocals are also
giving "great satisfaction," as is shown
by this letter:
Los Gatos, Cau, Aug. 2, 1904.
Drs. Pratt & Kerr: Dear Sirs—The
glasses you fitted for me, 1 can truly say,
are giving me great satisfaction. They
are the double lenses and where the two
parts join are so line as to be almost im
perceptible, consequently give me no
trouble whatever. Very sincerely yours,
[Signed] Mas. Dkxtkk Pierce.
