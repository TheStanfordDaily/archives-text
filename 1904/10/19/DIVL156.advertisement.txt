Spirit of
Helpfulness
In cases of accident everybody manifests
a desire to be of assistance. At such times
the spirit of helpfulness asserts itself, but so
often the wrong thing i8 done and the right
thing left undone. The first thing to do in
such an event is to quickly and freely apply
Pond's Extract—the old family doctor—a
recognized emergency remedy, for over tiO
years used by nurses, physicians and hos
pitals. Every student should have a bottle
close at hand. Quickly stops bleeding In
deep cuts; cures bruises, sprains, and pre
vents muscles becoming sore from gym
nasium exercises; re
lieves earache, toothache,
rheumatism and all pains.
Soothes and freshens the,
face after shaving. Watered
Witch Hazel, a weak solu
tion—sometimes offered in
place of Pond's Extract
has no medicinal value—is
positively worthless. Pond's
Extract CURES—therefore
is priceless.
Sold only in settled bottle*
under buff wrapper.
ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE.
