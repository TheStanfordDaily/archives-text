## Varsity Scores One Touch-down Against Second Team in Exciting Game. 
### 
Last night the Varsity lined up
against the second team for the
first hard scrimmage work of the
week, and by completely over
whelming the opposing line scored
one touch-down. The improve
ment of the Varsity in its team
work was notable, and the speed
with which the plays were executed
shows a decided advance over the
practice of last week. The punting of
the second team was superior to
the kicking of the Varsity and
probably paved them from being
scored on a second time. The ends
of the second team did not get
down well on the punts, and long
runs were made by the Varsity
backs who received the kicks.
W. H. Dole took part in heavy
scrimmage work for the first time
since his recent illness. Although
a trifle uncertain, his playing indi
cated that he will soon attain his
old-time form. Hyde and Thomp
son were on the field last night, but
neither player was able to join in
the practice. Both men, however,
are recovering from their injuries,
but it is hardly possible that either
will appear in the line-up against
Nevada in next Saturday's game.
Dole will play for a short time in
the game Saturday, but it is not
likely that Roosevelt's name will
appear in the Varsity line-up.
J. N. Stanford, who began the
season at the end position, but was
later shifted to the back-field, is
again back at his old place at right
end. He played that position on
the second eleven in the practice
match last night.
Shields, who has been playing
center on the Varsity, injured his
hand so severely in practice Mon
day night that he will be unable to
use it for several days.
