# HOSPITAL NEARS COMPLETION.
## Annex to Old Guild Building Practically Finished.â€”Modern Conveniences. 
### 
The new hospital erected under
the direction of the Students' Guild
is now practically complete. The
finishing work on tlie interior and
the painting remains to be done,
and is expected to he finished in a
short time. The necessity of using
the new building before the finish
ing work had been done delayed
the completion of the contract
within the specified time, October
15th. The work suspended will be
resumed as rapidly as the board of
directors is able to relinquish the
temporary possession of the new
building. The plastering of the
rooms on the lower floor is being
resumed this week.
The total cost of the new annex
to the Guild Hospital will be about
$4000. The price named in the
original contract was $8800, but it
wan found necessary to make cer
tain alterations of the first plane
costing an additional $200. Another
$500 has recently been spent in
making alterations and renovations
in the old building, making the
total expenditure for a new hospital
approximately $4500. The im
provements in the old hospital,
which were necessary to make it
thoroughly practical, consist chiefly
in the establishment of a new
plumbing system and changes in
the construction of the second floor.
A new bathroom was added and a
hallway built, which opens to the
porch joining the old and new
buildings. Other improvements
are: the building of a main diet
kitchen adjoining the regular
kitchen in the basement, the build
ing of food elevators, and replas
tering, repainting and recalcimin
ing. These changes make the old
building equally as fine as the new
annex.
The completed annex is a two
story building with a large base
ment practically above ground.
The ground dimensions are 34 by
41 feet. The building is a frame
structure) with a rustic exterior in
keeping with the old building. It
is heated by a hot-air furnace sys
tem and lighted by electricity.
Covered porches connect it with the
old building, making them prac
tically one. The south side of the
first floor is made up of one four
bed ward, with one isolating or
special nurse's room, a diet kitchen,
bathroom, and service and toilet
rooms. The nurse's room, ward,
and diet kitchen each open separ
ately to the large alcove porch be
tween the buildings, which in turn
opens out on the still larger sun
porch, having a southern protected
exposure. The sun porch is an ex
cellent feature of the new hospital.
Patients are taken there on cots to
enjoy the warm outdoor air and
