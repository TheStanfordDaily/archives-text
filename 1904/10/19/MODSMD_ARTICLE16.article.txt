# HOSPITAL NEARS COMPLETION.
## Annex to Old Guild Building Practically Finished.â€”Modern Conveniences. 
### 
The new hospital erected under
the direction of the Students' Guild
is now practically complete. The
finishing work on tlie interior and
the painting remains to be done,
and is expected to he finished in a
short time. The necessity of using
the new building before the finish
ing work had been done delayed
the completion of the contract
within the specified time, October
15th. The work suspended will be
resumed as rapidly as the board of
directors is able to relinquish the
temporary possession of the new
building. The plastering of the
rooms on the lower floor is being
resumed this week.
The total cost of the new annex
to the Guild Hospital will be about
$4000. The price named in the
original contract was $8800, but it
wan found necessary to make cer
tain alterations of the first plane
costing an additional $200. Another
$500 has recently been spent in
making alterations and renovations
in the old building, making the
total expenditure for a new hospital
approximately $4500. The im
provements in the old hospital,
which were necessary to make it
thoroughly practical, consist chiefly
in the establishment of a new
plumbing system and changes in
the construction of the second floor.
A new bathroom was added and a
hallway built, which opens to the
porch joining the old and new
buildings. Other improvements
are: the building of a main diet
kitchen adjoining the regular
kitchen in the basement, the build
ing of food elevators, and replas
tering, repainting and recalcimin
ing. These changes make the old
building equally as fine as the new
annex.
The completed annex is a two
story building with a large base
ment practically above ground.
The ground dimensions are 34 by
41 feet. The building is a frame
structure) with a rustic exterior in
keeping with the old building. It
is heated by a hot-air furnace sys
tem and lighted by electricity.
Covered porches connect it with the
old building, making them prac
tically one. The south side of the
first floor is made up of one four
bed ward, with one isolating or
special nurse's room, a diet kitchen,
bathroom, and service and toilet
rooms. The nurse's room, ward,
and diet kitchen each open separ
ately to the large alcove porch be
tween the buildings, which in turn
opens out on the still larger sun
porch, having a southern protected
exposure. The sun porch is an ex
cellent feature of the new hospital.
Patients are taken there on cots to
enjoy the warm outdoor air and
sunlight. In windy, disagreeable
weather u larger canvas curtain is
dropped down between the build
ings, which prevents any draught
reaching them. The north division
of the first floor contains two two
bed wards, a diet kitchen, and two
single rooms, besides a large store
room and the toilet and service
rooms.
On the second floor there is a
four-bed ward on the south side,
with a nurse's single room, a diet
kitchen, a service and a toilet room.
The north division corresponds to
the south side, except that the four
bed ward can be divided into two
two-bed wards by means of a heavy
drop-curtain. All the rooms are
arranged so as to have direct con
nection with the large alcove porch,
8 by 24 feet, which is continued in
an open porch joining the old build
ing. The recently constructed hall
of the old hospital opens directly
to this porch, and the stairway of
the annex descends from it to the
outside of the building.
The arrangement of the diet
kitchens is of great importance. A
large shaft iB built in the center of
the building, and the two diet kitch
ens of each floor open directly to it
on opposite sides. Food elevators
running up and down the shaft con
nect these diet kitchens with the
basement, which in turn is con
nected with the diet kitchen in the
main building by a system of dumb
waiters. Thus it is possible to send
food prepared in main diet kitchen,
located in the basement of the old
building, to the diet kitchens on
either floor of the annex, to be
served to the patients. A system
has been provided whereby the food
is kept hot by encasing it with hot
water. In each diet room are sep
arate stoves and sinks which have
their outlets connected with the
main flues in the large shaft. It is
possible to elevate uncooked food to
the diet kitchens, where it can be
prepared for the patients without
any inconvenience.
The completion of the addition
makes possible an excellent system
for the handling of contagious dis
eases. In case of necessity any in
tercourse between the two buildings
can be entirely stopped; the two
floors of each building can be iso
lated from each other, and the diet
kitchens and service rooms make
complete isolation of each ward
practicable. Four distinct hospi
tals could be made, and even more
if necessity demanded. To enable
the carrying out of this plan, the
sections of the hospital have sepa
rate plumbing and telephone sys
tems. The building is arranged so
that a house telephone system can
be installed at any time. Each
cot has its own electric call bell
and drop light. Communication
throughout the hospital is easy,
quick, and safe.
In the old building the reception
room, office, operating room, anaes
thetic room, and a number of rooms
for the resident staff of nurses and
housekeepers are located on the
lower floor. The second floor has
three two-bed wards and three pri
vate roomg. The kitchen, general
main staff dining-room, main diet
kitchen, janitor's room, and section
furnace are located in the basement.
The operating room, which was
equipped last cpring, had its effi
ciency proven recently when two
cases of appendicitis were success
fully operated on. One of these
would probably have resulted fatal

ly had it been necessary to cause
a delay of the operation for the pa- j
tient's removal to San Francisco.
The new hospital is capable of
accommodating twenty-eight pa
tients under ordinary conditions, j
There has already been that num
ber in the hospital at one time, j
which was the cause of the delay in
the completion of the annex. By
crowding a little, as many as forty
can be cared for at one time, and
even more could be taken in if it
were necessary. This is made pos-1
Bible by the size of the ward rooms, j
The four-bed wards can be made to j
accommodate six beds with little j
inconvenience, and the private
rooms are available for patients, so j
that by doubling up, a much larger
number can be cared for than ordi- j
narily. The equipment of the hoe- j
pital, although not entirely com- i
plete, is sufficient to satisfy the 1
present needs. Everything is thor
oughly up-to-date, and the condi- j
tions will be constantly improved :
as necessity demands.
