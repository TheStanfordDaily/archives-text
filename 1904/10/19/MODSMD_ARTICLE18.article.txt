# Junior Women Meet.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior women
held in the chapel at 1:15 to-day
the question of a suitable hat band
was finally decided upon. After some
discussion it was agreed to omit the
class numerals from the hat. The
evening of the Plug Ugly was
agreed upon as the time on which
the hats are first to be worn, and
the Monday following was chosen
as the first day on which the bats
will be seen on the quad. The hats
have been received by the Palo Alto
dealer, and immediately upon the
receipt of the bands they will be
ready for distribution.
