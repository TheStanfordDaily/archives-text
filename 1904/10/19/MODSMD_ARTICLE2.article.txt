## 
### 
In a fast game played at Berke
ley yesterday the University of Cal
ifornia eleven defeated the Multno
mah Club team by a score of 20 to
0. All of the scoring was done in
the second half. Three touch
downs and one field-goal were
made. During the first half the
heavy Multnomah players held
their own, and were able to make
substantial gains through the cen
ter of the State University line. In
the second period California played
faster ball, and the pace soon told
on the poorly trained club men,
and their line whb penetrated for
the requisite five yards almost
every time a California back was
given the ball. Half-back Kern
made a 55-yard run through a
scattered field, but with this excep
tion the game was without sensa
tional features. Fourteen men
were played in yesterday's game by
the California coaches.
