# Cover Design Selected.
## 
### 
Out of some ten or twelve de
signs for the new song-book cover,
a drawing handed in by Miss J. E.
Herron, '06, has been selected.
The new design draws away from
the stereotyped forms of past years.
There is no drawing representing a
football player or the like, but the
design consists simply of scroll work
combined with artistic lettering
reading "Stanford Songs, 1904."
The cover will be red with the
design stamped in white. As yet
the exact list of songs which will
be included in the book has not
been decided on. The five new
songs and the best of the old songs
will be printed. Probably the old
Mandalay song will be revived.
The committee is making every ef
fort to get the song-books made up.
