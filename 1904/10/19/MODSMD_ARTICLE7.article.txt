# "MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING."
## Features of the Shaksperean Comedy Which Will Be Presented Friday Night. 
### 
"Much Ado About Nothing" is
one of the plays of Shakspere that
lias delighted the public from the
time it was first acted by "the right
honourable,the Lord Chamberlaine,
his servants," in the last years of
the 16th century down to the pres
ent day. As one of the old com
mendatory verse writers puts it:
let but Beatrice
And Benedicke be seene, loe in a
trice
The Cockpit, Galleries, Boxes, are
all full.
This designating the play by the
names of Beatrice and Benedick
suggests what is, perhaps, the chief
element of its lasting popularity.
The "merry war of the sexes" car
ried on by these two characters is
full of wit that flows and sparkles
like a mountain stream in the sun
shine. It stirs us as much to-day
as ever. One reason for this is that
they themselves are sympathetically
drawn, true to human nature, and
therefore just as real as of flesh and
blood. This applies especially to
Beatrice, who, as has been pointed
out, has all the vivaciousness and
common sense that are found in
the American ideal of womanhood.
Her character is complex. Furni
wall calls her "the sauciest, most
piquant, sparkling, madcap girl
that Shakspere ever drew," but
adds that she is "a loving, deep
natured. true woman, too."
Beatrice and Benedick appear to
be creatures of the dramatist, per
haps drawn from life, for the Ital
ian plot, which is used as a back
ground, concerns itself with the
love of Hero and Claudio, the com
plication coming in the conspiracy
of Don Juan.
An almost burlesque element is
furnished by Dogberry, who in
sists on being " writ down an
ass," and by the simpletons of his
night-watch. With superb irony
these ridiculous characters are made
to untangle the complication in the
main action.
The effectiveness of the play as
a whole is much increased when it
is staged in the Elizabethan man
ner, without change of scene, with
out distracting intermissions, and
with a well-balanced company of
players instead of one or two stars
and a lot of sticks. In his artistic
revival of the old plays Mr. Ben
Greet has wisely chosen to keep
them free from some of the unfortu
nate features of the modern stage.
"The play's the thing;" it does not
need as much extraneous help as
we sometimes think.
Those who wish to witness one of
Shakspere's representative come
dies, acted very much as it was in
his own day, cannot afford to miss
seeing Mr. Greet's players in the
Assembly Hall Friday evening
when they enact "Much Ado About
Nothing." For the student of lit
erature the performance has an
educational value, but for every
man and woman capable of human
emotion it has a message of sympa
thetic laughter.
