# Supplies for Rooters.
## 
### 
Arrangements have been made
by Treasurer Barrett for securing
megaphones and rooters' hats to be
used at the intercollegiate football
game. The Haberdasher of Palo
Alto has agreed to deliver mega
phones at the football field, the stu
dent body paying one-half the cost
of their manufacture. This is the
same arrangement that was carried
out last year.
The official contract for furnish
ing rooters' hats has also been given
to the same firm. Individual or
ders are to be taken, the hats to
cost 60 cents each. Orders will be
taken by C. B. Taylor, '06, and G.
0. Spurrier, '07. The hats will be
ready for delivery some time before
the game.
