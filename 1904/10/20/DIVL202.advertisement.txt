Not a flaw or defect
Should ever be found.
The price of optical goods depends
mainly upon the quality of the lenses.
Telescopes, microscopes, field glasses,
opera glasses, and cameras all depend
for their value upon the lenses they con
tain.
It is the same way with eye glasses
and spectacles. The "first consideration
should always be the lenses.
The eyes should he carefully exam
ined, their needs ascertained and a lens
exactly centered and accurately ground
furnished to correct the defect or supply
the needed power.
Perfectly ground and perfectly fitted
lenses give easy, restful vision.
They enable you to read or work with
out pain or discomfort.
They afford the only permanent relief
from headaches and nervousness caused
by eye strain. They straighten most
crossed or "sqiiinty" eyes if worn in
time. The lenses we furnish must be
right. Our guarantee covers every point.
EXAMINATION FREE.
