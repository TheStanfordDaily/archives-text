# "QUAD" PRIZE COMPETITION.
## Conditions Under Which Manuscript Must be Submitted Similar to Last Year. 
### 
The prize story arid poem to be
published in the 1906 Quad are to
be selected this year as usual by
means of a competitive contest.
Work done by any Stanford stu
dent, past or present, may be
entered in this competition under
the following conditions:
(1) All manuscripts must he
handed in before February 3, 1905.
(2) Manuscripts must be type
written, and should have on the
outside the name of the author and
an estimate of the number of words
contained. (3) That a story or
poem has been published elsewhere
does not bar it from the competi
tion, provided it has appeared
between February 1, 1904, and
February 1, 1905. It must, how
ever, be handed in in manuscript.
(4) The story must be between
1500 and 3000 words in length.
(5) Two or more manuscripts may
be submitted by the same author.
The prize offered for the success
ful story is $15.00, for the poem
$7.50. Something of local interest
is desirable, but this is not made a
condition of the contest. A com
mittee of three members of the
English faculty will act as
judges of the material submitted.
The right is reserved to them to
reject all manuscripts, provided no
one is found of sufficient excellence
to merit publication. Manuscripts
may be sent to Miss E. 11. Mir
rielees, '06. and should be marked
" For Quad competition."
