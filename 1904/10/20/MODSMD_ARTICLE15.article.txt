The unusual sale of tickets for
''Much Ado About Nothing," which
will be presented in Assembly Hall
to-morrow night by the Ben Greet
Company, is sufficient evidence
that the efforts of the English Club
in bringing this attraction to the
campus have not been in vain.
The opportunity to see the Shak
sperean play in the form in which
it will be given to-morrow night is
a rare one, and the fact that it can
be seen at the University is a great
convenience to all residents of the
community. This is not the first
time that the English Club has
taken steps toward presenting or
having presented exceptionally fine
dramatic features, and it is to be
hoped that the future efforts of the
organization will receive the gener
ous support that has been given to
those of the past.
