## Slow Game Played by Varsity and Second Team Last Night. 
### 
Last night's practice was dis
tinguished by good individual play
ing, but the team work was ragged
especially the interference, which
formed so slowly tbat it was a hin
drance rather than a help to the run
ner. Consistent gains were made
through the second team line by the
Varsity backs, but the formations
were executed soslowly thatonly one
touch-down was made during the
half hour of play. The punting of
both teamß was poor, but the sec
ond was slightly superior to the
Varsity in this department of the
game. Dole, Roosevelt, and Sprott
took part in heavy scrimmage work
for the first time since they reap
peared on the field. The three
players were in the name for a
short time only, but their playing
showed that it will not take long
for them to regain their old form.
Weller was not in the Varsity
line-up, as he has been instructed
by the trainer to refrain from hard
work until the Nevada game Sat
urday. He has been threatened
with water on the knee, and every
precaution will be taken to prevent
further development of the trouble.
R. A. Thompson appeared in a
suit last night, but his injured
ankle will not permit him to take
part in scrimmage work. F. W.
Haselwood, '06, who broke his col
lar-bone in the first Olympic game,
was out for practice last night. It
was thought at the time of the ac
cident that the nature of the frac
ture precluded his again being able
to play this year, but his recovery
has been unusually rapid, and he
will soon be in condition for hard
play.
J. F. Brennan sustained a frac
ture of the collar-bone in last
night's practice. The bone is only
slightly cracked, and it is not ex
pected that the injury will keep
him out of the game for more than
ten days.

practice game as follows:
