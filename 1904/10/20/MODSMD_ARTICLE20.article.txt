# SHAKSPERE PLAY TO-MORROW.
## Ben Greet's Company Will Appear in Assembly Hall at 8. 
### 
The Ben Greet players, who will
present "Much Ado About Noth
ing" to-morrow night in Assembly
Hall, will arrive on the campus to
morrow morning, and will be the
guests of the various fraternities
and sororities. Most of the mem
bers of this company have come
with Mr. Greet from London, where
for years he has enjoyed a wide
reputation as a manager of pastoral
performances given on the lawns of
the Royal Botanical Gardens, and
elsewhere. Mr. Greet has been one
of those most interested in the re
vival of the old plays by the Eliza
bethan Stage Society. The best
known of these is the old morality
of "Everyman," which was acted at
Stanford last year, and which con
tinues its remarkable hold upon
the public. In his sincere effort to
present plays in the Elizabethan
manner Mr. Greet has shown that
they gain in both beauty and force.
The advance sale assures a large
house for to-morrow evening, and
in addition there will undoubtedly
be a number of seats sold at the
door. The performance will begin
at eight o'clock, and although the
play is given in full it will be over
by half-past ten. This is made pos
sible because no time is lost chang
ing scenes.
In addition to Mr. Greet and Mr.
and Mrs. Crawley, who will be well
remembered from last year, the
company consists of Messrs. Eugene
Cleeves, Frank Dorch, Leonard
Shepard, Percival Aylmar, Mau
rice Robinson, Samuel Goodwin,
Eric Blind and Sydney Greenstreet;
Misses Shyrard, Helen Head, Daisy
Robinson, Sybil Thorndike, Agnes
Scott and Margaret Buckley, and
Manager Pierce.
