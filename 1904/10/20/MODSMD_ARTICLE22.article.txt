C. M. Darling and C.C. Murphy,
two journalists of Jackson, Michi

view of its description in a book to
be written by them entitled,
"Around the United States by Bi

country on wheels on a wager of
$5000, and intend to enter the
University of Michigan at the con
clusion of the trip. They are now
three weeks ahead of their schedule.
