# Track Being Repaired.
## 
### 
The tirst work toward getting the
track in condition for the handicap
field meet to be held soon after the
intercollegiate football game has
begun. Along the inside edge of
the track, from the turn in front of
the training-house down the stretch
to the first turn, new dirt is being
used to fill in and this will be cov
ered with cinders and packed solid.
This improvement was necessary
on account of the large number of
men out on the track for fall train
ing. The dirt being used to fill in
the edge of the track is brought
from a cellar in Palo Alto and is
expected to dry out quickly after a
rain. One of the great faults of
the track heretofore has been the
length of time required for the
track to dry out after a rain. If
this work is well done now it will
save much of the usual spring re
pairing and it will be easy to keep
the track in good condition.
