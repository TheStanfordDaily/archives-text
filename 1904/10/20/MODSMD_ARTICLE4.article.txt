# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Debating Trophy Granted to the Southern California High School League. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students met in regular
session last night. The only busi
ness of importance before the com
mittee was the proposition to offer
a trophy to be contested for by the
high school debating league of
Southern California. The plan was
brought before the Intersocietv
Debating League some time
ago, and met with instant favor.
On recommendation of the Inter
society League the committee de
cided to put up a silver cup, which,
will be contested for on the same
terms as the trophy offered to the
central California high school de
bating league by the student body
several years ago.
Like the first cup, the present tro
phy is offered for the purpose of
stimulating interest in debating
among the preparatory schools em
braced in the league, and for the
further purpose of drawing debaters
to Stanford. Try-outs will be held
each year, and the team that wins
out in these will hold the cup for
the first year. After the first an
nual contest the winner of the tro
phy will defend it against the school
that wins the league try-out. The
team which first wins the cup three
times will retain permanent pos
session.
The membership of the southern
league is limited to the high schools
of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los
Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Orange, and San Diego counties.
The league has been in existence
for two years.
