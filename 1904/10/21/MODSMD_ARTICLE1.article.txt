To-morrow afternoon on the cam
pus gridiron Stanford will meet the
University of Nevada football team
for the sixth annual contest. Of
the five previous contests Stanford
has won three, Nevada one, and one
was a tie. Nevada began playing
football seven years ago, and in
spite of the handicap of a small
student body, has succeeded in de
veloping a number of strong teams
which have proved worthy rivals of
California and Stanford. In 1897
the Belmont school defeated Nevada
74 to 8. In 1898 a Stanford second
eleven met defeat at the hands of
the sagebrushers by a score of 22
to 0. The following year Nevada
had so improved that she was able
to score on Stanford in a game
which was won by the Cardinal.
In 1900 much to the surprise of
football critics Nevada defeated the
strong Stanford team of that year
by a score of 6 to 0. Last year,
although no scoring was done by
either team, the Varsity was clearly
outplayed by Nevada.
Dr. A. C. Steckle, a famous Mich
igan tackle and member of the Ail-
American team in 1899, was coach
of the team until this year, when
he went to Corvallis to coach the
team of the Oregon Agricultural
College. lie has been succeeded by
Short, another noted Michigan
tackle, who played against Traeger
in the Michigan-Stanford game at
Pasadena. The Nevada eleven has
been considerably weakened this
year by the loss of some of its best
players. Smith, captain of the
1903 team, was counted one of the
fastest ends on the Coast. His
name does not appear in this year's
line-up. Lawrence, Levaitt, and
Hoffman, who played a good game
in last year's contest, are not in
college this season. Steckle and
Friesell are two of last year's stars
who are still on the team. Chism
and Hart are the only other mem
bers of the 1903 team who will
play in to-morrow's game.
A comparison of preliminary
scores prophesies a Cardinal vic
tory in to-morrow's contest. In the
first game of the season Nevada de
feated the soldier team from Fort
Baker by a score of 17 to 0. In a
slow game last Saturday Nevada
defeated Olympic Club at Reno 8
to 5, a touch-down and a touch
back being responsible for the score.
Two weeks before, Stanford beat
the same team with ease by a score
of 12 to 0. It is hardly possible
that the Nevadans will cross the
Varsity goal-line to-morrow, but
they may make a field-goal, as
Friesell is an accurate place-kicker.
Short has been instilling the
Michigan system of play in his
charges, and the team will depend
on speed rather than weight to
gain against Stanford in Satur
day's game. Lanagan is also an

exponent of swift formations and
fast line-ups after downs, so the
game to-morrow ought to be a fast,
snappy contest.
The Varsity line-up will be the
most formidable that has gone into
any game this season. The only
Varsity men omitted from the list
are Thompson, Shields and Smith,
who are unable to play on account
of injuries. It is probable that
Nissen will pass the ball through
out the entire contest, as the other
candidates for center have not fully
recovered from recently sustained
injuries. To-morrow's contest will
he the first game of the season for
Sprott, Dole, and Roosevelt, and
the work of these players will be
watched with interest. The line-up
for the first kick-off will be as fol
lows:
STANFORD NEVADA
Clark 1 e r Knox
Sprott 1 t r Steckle
Van Sickle 1 g r Chism
Nissen c Hamlin
Roosevelt r g 1 Wenke

Officials will be as follows: W.
T. Reid, Jr., referee; Major Collins,
umpire; McFadden, linesman; Bar
tell, timekeeper.
The play of the Varsity has
gradually improved this week, and
in last night's practice the players
got into the game with more dash
and vim than they have shown
since the slump of last week. The
back-field of the Varsity in the
practice scrimmage last night was
the same as the one which played
against California in the last inter
collegiate game. The return to the
field of the men who have been
injured has stimulated competition
for places on the team, and there
has been a corresponding improve
ment in the work of the various
candidates.
Some time was devoted last night
to pl*ce- and drop-kicking. W. H.
Dole sent the ball squarely between
the goal-posts on two drop-kicks
from the 30-yard line. Several
attempts to make place-kicks by
Tomasini and Sprott were frus
trated by the second team line
men, who broke through and
blocked the ball.
G. W.Smith collided so violently
with Weller while endeavoring to
block a kick that he was severely
injured, and will not be able to
play for several days.
Hereafter all persons not in foot
ball uniform will be excluded from
the sidelines. The crowd of specta
tors has frequently encroached on
the gridiron, and interfered with
practice during the past week; and
in consequence it is the wish of the
football management that specta
tors should be restricted to the
bleachers.
