It is the wish of Coach Lanagan
that no one appear along the side
lines of the football field during
practices and preliminary games,
except those who are playing on
the squad or others duly author
ized to be there. This latter class
at daily practice includes only the
trainers and a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto, and at the
preliminary games it is limited to
the same with the addition of other
newspaper correspondents. The
wishes of the football coach and
his assistants must be respected in
every particular, and in the future
we shall expect to see a marked
decrease in the number of people
along the sidelines. For visitors
and members of the community,
not actually connected with the
game, a more comfortable place
than the sidelines is provided on
the bleachers.
