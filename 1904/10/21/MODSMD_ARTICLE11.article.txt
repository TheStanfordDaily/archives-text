The announcement that an
amendment to the State constitu
tion has been proposed with the
purpose of freeing from taxation the
property of the California Academy
of Sciences will bear the careful con
sideration of every voter in the

University community. The amend
ment Jb a worthy one, and is deserv
ing of not only the votes but also the
support and influence of Stanford
students and constituents. The
Academy of Sciences is ranked as
one of the three leading scientific in
stitutions of the Pacific Coast. Its
museums are free to the general
public, and its valuable collections
are open to the scientific investiga
tions of students and faculty mem
bers of Stanford and all other
universities. In every respect the
academy is a benefit to the general
public, and has been one of the
most important factors in the ad
vancement of scientific research in
the State.
