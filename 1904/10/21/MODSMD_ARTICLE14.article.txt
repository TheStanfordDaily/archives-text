# HISTORY OF FOOTBALL.
## A 						Very Old Game, Played by Ancient Greeks and Romans. 
### 
The story of football begins far
back in history, and has, except for
a brief period, steadily grown in
favor. Even in the early dawn of
Grecian civilization a simple form
of this sport was enjoyed. Then a
rude ball, made of bladder or rough
skin, was used, and the players
propelled it by kicking, not being
allowed to put the ball forward, in
any manner, by the use of the
hands.
The Romans, too, were expert
players. They called it harpastum.
As the history of the word implies,
they, unlike the Greeks, were per
mitted to seize the ball in their
hands and carry it, as well as kick
it.
Football is a much older game
than cricket, and is more suitable
for the winter season. In fact, it
was soon called the "winter game,"
cricket being dubbed the "summer
game."
It is believed that "The History
of London," by William Fitz
stephen, written about the year
1175, makes the first historic men
tion of this game in England, al
though it seems certain that it was
introduced into Great Britain in
early times by the Romans, in
England, for a long time, there
were no clubs, no code of rules, and
no special organizations to give
control, in any way, of this excit
ing pastime. On Shrove Tuesday
people of all ages and both sexes
were seen on the football field in
two great contending forces, to be
found wherever there was oppor
tunity for this spirited contest.
There seemed to be little organi
zation. Each person was permit
ted to use almost any means, fair
or foul, to get the ball to the de
sired goal. So rough did the game
grow that even throughout the city
of London window shutters became
a necessity, and in many cases
barricades were built around
houses in localities where the game
was waged most fiercely. This
sort of thing could not last long.
The game fell into great disre
pute. Even in the time of James
I.the heir apparent to the throne
was forbidden to play, the king
saying: "The game is meeter for
laming than making able the users
thereof." Into such disfavor had
the game come in 1830 that for
thirty years almost nothing was
seen of this rollicking, noisy,
turbulent scene of the Shrovetide
season.
But in 1860 amateur athletics
were organized in England by the
public school and university men,
and in this widespread movement
football was to have due promi
nence.
At once the game again grew
popular. The whole English na
tion was strangely moved by this
amusement. Soon it was seen that
carefully formulated rules must be
made. There must be a society
with power to legislate. So the
football association was organized
in 1863. This society stood for a
strictly and carefully played game.
If possible every play was to be
regulated by exact rules. So in
1871 the Rugby football union
was instituted. This society stood
for a less strictly guarded game.
The association used a ball in
the shape of a perfect sphere, the
union one egg-shaped. The balls
were now much improved, being

made then much as now, by using
inflated India rubber bladders cov
ered with leather carefully laced
together.
In the United States the great
colleges and universities, as in
England, led in giving popularity
to football. And the interest mani
fested in this form of athletics has
been, and is now, in most sections,
intense and absorbing.
Now not only do the colleges
and universities have their teams
to win honors for their respective
institutions, but, also, it is found
that almost all the small schools,
the town high schools, villages, etc.,
are represented by well organized
teams.
