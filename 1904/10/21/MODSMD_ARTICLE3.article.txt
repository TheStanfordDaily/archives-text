# INTERCLASS TOURNAMENT.
## Best Singles Players in College Will Meet To-morrow Morning. 
### 
The intercla√üs singles tennis
tournament will be held to-morrow
on the Encina courts. As all the
best players in college entered the
try-outs, this tournament will be
between the picked players of the
University. The Junior class will
be represented by G. A. Hodge,
who is captain of the tennis team.
It is very likely that Hodge will
win the interclass tournament, but
there will be some interesting
matches to decide who will meet
in the finals. At present Hodge
holds a position as assistant in the
Civil Engineering department.
This would prevent him from play
ing intercollegiate tennis, but his
appointment expires next Decem
ber and it will not be renewed.
It has not yet been decided who
will represent the Seniors in to
morrow's contest. A. W. Hooper
and E. A. Luce will play the finals
in the Senior class tournament, and
the winner of this match will play
in the interclass.
J. F. Caesell will represent the
Sophomore class in the interclass
tournament. Cassell played in the
intercollegiate try-outs lastvear and
has showed good form this year.
There were several good players in
the Sophomore try-out, and Cassell
had to play good tennis to defeat
T. B. Brown and C. L. Lewis.
The Freshman class try-out was
won by A. R. Mac Swain, and he
will represent the Freshmen to
morrow. Mac Swain comes from
Santa Clara, where he has played
for several years. In the Fresh
man tournament he outclassed the
other entries and played a fine
game. He is a hard player and
promises to make a strong bid for
a place in the finals of the inter
class.
This is the first interclass tennis
tournament that has been held in
recent years, and it is expected that
to-morrow's matches will arouse a
great deal of interest. The first
match will be played at 9:30 to
morrow morning between J. F.
Cassell, '07, and A. R. Mac Swain,
'08. The final in the interclass
tournament will be played at 2:30
to-morrow afternoon.
