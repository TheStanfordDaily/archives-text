Dr. B. C. Blodgett, organist of
Memorial Church, desires to call
the special attention of the student
body to the organ recitals which are
given daily in Memorial Church
from 4 to 5. Although Dr. Blodgett
desires to have outside visitors at
tend also, these recitals are given
primarily for the students of the
University, and it is to them that
he appeals. He wishes to make
these recitals a regular feature of
the University life. Students are
urged to attend, even if they can
stay only a few minutes at a time.
The program is prepared with the
idea of pleasing the general body of
students, and is not ultra-classical.
On every Friday afternoon a "re
quest" program will be rendered,
and Dr. Blodgett will be glad to
play such selections as are suggested
by individual students.
