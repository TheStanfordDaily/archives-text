stitution, which will be voted upon

The Academy is especially valu
able for the opportunities it offers
for scientific investigation, and,

larly useful to Stanford students
and faculty members who are en
gaged in scientific branches of
work. For this reason the amend
ment is strongly favored by the
faculty, several of whom are ac
tively engaged in forwarding its
