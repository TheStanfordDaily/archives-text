For the troubles which come
From neglect or abuse.
If any of the human body is re
quired to do an excessive amount of
work the nervous system must supply to
that organ enough extrtf power to do the
extra work. To do this some other or
gan must be drawn upon, and, as in all
nature the strong robs the weak, so any
weak organ from which the eye gets its
excess supply of nerve force may suffer.
The eyes work from early morning
until closed in sleep, often sixteen or
eighteen hours a day, and any defect
which the eyes can, even partially, over
come by strain adds greatly to the tax
upon the nerve centers.
Only those who have experienced the
relief from nervous ailments which is
often afforded by right glasses can ap
preciate their value in these cases.
If you've tried everything else for
your headaches, nervousness, etc., let us
demonstrate what right glasses will do.
