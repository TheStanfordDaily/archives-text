# STANFORD 17, NEVADA 0.
## Cardinal Makes Good Score in Fastest Game of the Season. 
### 
The sixth annual football game
between Stanford and the Univer
sity of Nevada resulted in a victory
for the Cardinal after the best game
seen on the campus this season.
The score of 17 to 0 does not ade
quately represent the scoring pow
ers of the Varsity, for bad fumbling
alone prevented the scoring of two
more touch-downs. The heat and
numerous minor injuries to play
ers caused the first half to be un
duly protracted. During the sec
ond period, while the ball was in
Stanford's possession the playing
was unusually fast, and the second
touch-down was made by travers
ing almost the entire length of the
gridiron within three minutes after
play commenced. For the greater
part of the game the Stanford back
field was the same as opposed Cali
fornia in last year's intercollegiate
match. The addition of Sprott
and Roosevelt to the rush line im
measurably strengthened that part
of the team, and throughout the
game it was practically impreg
nable to the fierce onsets of the
Nevada backs. Not until several
substitutes had been placed in the
line near the close of the game did
the Nevadans find a vulnerable
point of attack.
The Michigan style of play used
by Nevada showed the effects of
Short's coaching, and the end run
ning was protected by as fine in
terference as has ever been Been on
the campus gridiron. The two
Harts, Freeman, Steckle, and
Friesell were the bright stars of the
visiting team, but their best play
ing was necessarily done on the
defensive, as they made their downs
only four times during the prog
ress of the game.
Although members of the Stan
ford back-field made many brilliant
gains, team work and not individ
ual playing accounts for the score
piled up by the Cardinal. Weller
and Chalmers excelled at bucking
the line, and it was seldom that a
buck by either of these players
failed to gain at least five yards.
Aided by superb interference Dole
was sent outside of tackle for re
peated gains. Dole's punts were
high and well placed, and an ex
change of kicks between him and
Friesell usually resulted in a gain
for Stanford. Bansbach directed
the team with rare generalship, and
gained many yards for the Cardi
nal by running in punts.
Nevada started the game with a
rush which fairly took the Stan
ford players off their feet. Two
end runs for 8 and 18 yards were
made, but Stanford held, and tak
ing the ball, soon had it in danger
ous proximity to the Nevada goal.
An unfortunate fumble gave the
sphere to Nevada, and regaining it
on a punt the Varsity carried it up
the field and Chalmers was sent
over the line for a touch-down.
Weller made the second score
shortly after the Becond half
opened, and he wa? hurled over the
line for the thiid before the second
period was more than half over.
Determined to increase the score,
the ball was again worked down
the field to Nevada's 10-yard line.
Here the sphere was fumbled, and
before the dazed Stanford players
had time to recover it C. Hart was
speeding toward the defenseless Car
dinal goal. Van Sickle was soon at
the runner's heels, and, although
thrown aside by the interference
several times, he finally tackled
Hart on Stanford's 40-yard-line.
The encouraged Nevadans began to
play fiercely, and a couple of punts
and two bucks for 8 and 3 yards
left the ball on Stanford's 20-yard
line, and in possession of Nevada
when the game closed.
