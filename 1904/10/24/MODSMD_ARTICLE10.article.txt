The spirit displayed by certain
individuals on the bleachers last
Saturday was on of which we deeply
feel ashamed. That there are men
in the Stanford student body who
will hoot at players on a visiting
athletic team, and who are so lack
ing in ordinary courtesy that
they do not show any hesitancy in
jeering the supporters of a visiting
team, are matters of painful regret.
Such demonstrations should be
stamped out in the future, and as
long as we remain burdened with a
goodly share of muckers, the only
way to keep down disgraceful exhi
bitions is by harsh measures on the
part of the majority of men who
know what good spirit is.
