# Roble Courts Completed.
## 
### 
The new Roble tennis courts are
now practically completed, and will
be ready for use by the first of next
week. Owing to the recent rains
the courts have been too soft to
line, but this will be done on Thurs
day or Friday of the present week.
With the completion and use of
the new courts it h expected that
tennis among the women students
will assume a more active aspect.
Practice is kept up by some of the
players, but there has been no reg
ular squad work yet this season.
