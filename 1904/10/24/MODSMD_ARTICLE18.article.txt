# Interclass Tennis Matches Played.

### 
The interclass singles tennis
tournament began Saturday morn
ing, and there was a large crowd
present to witness the matches. In
the first match Mac Swain, '08, de
feated J. F. Cassell, '07, by a score
of 6-2, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Cassell was
easily defeated in the first set, but
in the second set he picked up and
nearly every game was deuce, and
the set was much more close than
the score 6-3 would indicate. The
third set was won by Cassell and
the fourth set was close, Mac Swain
finally winning out by the score
6-4. All through the match Mac-
Swain showed good judgment in
placing the ball and was fast in
getting around the court. He gives
promise of developing into a first
class Varsity tennis player.
In the second match of the
tournament G. A. Hodge, '06, beat
Aâ€ž W. Hooper, '05, 6-1, 6 -0, 6-2.
Hooper had played a hard match
with E. A. Luce earlier in the
morning and consequently did not
play his strongest game against
Hodge. The playing of Hodge
showed improvement, and he will
probably defeat Mac Swain in finals.
