# Try-Out for Stuntist.
## 
### 
An opportunity for men to try
out for stuntist to accompany the
combined musical clubs on holi
day trip will be given on Wednes
day night, November 2nd, in the
chapel. There are a number of
stuntists now in college who have
gone on previous trips with the
clubs, but it is not probable that
many of these men will again try
out for positions. The loss of Bush
and Baker, the clever Btuntists of
last year, leaves plenty of room for
competition for men to fill their
places. New men, especially, are
urged to be present at the try-out
and to present original ideas.
