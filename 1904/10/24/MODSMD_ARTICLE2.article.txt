# SHAKSPEREAN PLAY.
## "Much Ado About Nothing" Given Before Large Audience by Ben Greet Company. 
### 
Over a thousand persons wit
nessed the presentation of Shaks
pere's "Much Ado About Nothing,"
by the Ben Greet player's in Assem
bly Hall Friday evening. The un
relaxed attention, and the ripples
of laughter, as well as the applause,
showed that the comedy was en
joyed and appreciated by all.
Those who had seen "Twelfth
Night" by the same players last
year were prepared for the "Eliza
bethan manner" in which Mr.
Greet presents these plays. The
simple hut artistic stage setting,
which remained unchanged except
for the drawing of portieres, and
the shifting of a few properties by
the blue-coated stage-boys,suggested
rather than accurately reproduced
the Elizabethan theater. But it was
successful in showing that the elab
orate scenery of modern times, with
its pasteboard realism, and its lime
light, is an unnecessary intrusion
detracting from the play itself.
One great advantage of the sim
ple scenery was that the play pro
ceeded without break. This showed
the continuity and unity of the
whole in a way that would have
been impossible had the scenes and
acts been separated by intermis
sions full of the noise and bustle of
changing scenery. The effect
throughout was to throw the em
phasis on the words and action of
the play, to give "more of the author
and less of the stage carpenter."
Herein lies the great merit of the
revival of old plays by the Eliza
bethan Stage Society of London,
and their presentation in this coun
try by Mr. Greet's players.
Another one of Mr. Greet's ideas
in presenting Shakspere in the
Elizabethan manner is to keep the
interest centered in the play itself
instead of in some one "star." It
was no doubt a great event to see
Booth, but that is no reason why
those of us who unfortunately were
born too late should not see "Ham
let." Too often the actor is adver
tised instead of the play. In
"Much Ado About Nothing" Mr.
Greet as Benedick and Mrs. Craw
ley as Beatrice had the important
parts and justly won much ap
plause, but there was no effort to
make these two characters any
more prominent than intended
by the dramatist. As a whole
the company was well balanced,
although in one or two cases there
was a slight tendency toward
"mouthing," yet for the most part
the lines were spoken with intelli
gent and sympathetic expression,
the rich quality of the English
voice adding to the pleasing effect.
In the grouping and in many of
the little things that go into what
is known as "stage business" there
was constant evidence of the care
Mr. Greet exercises in these details.
Mr. Greet and his players will
return to Stanford on Saturday,
November 19th, when they will
act "Hamlet" in full according to
the first folio version. As this will
take over five hours, half of the
play will lie acted in the afternoon
and half in the evening.
