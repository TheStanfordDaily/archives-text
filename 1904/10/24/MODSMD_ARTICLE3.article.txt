# CHESS CLUB MEETS.
## Arrangements for Fall Tournament Completed.—Large Number of Entries. 
### 
At a meeting of the Chess Club
held Saturday evening in room 129
Encina Hall arrangements were
completed for carrying through the
fall tournament. A large number
of new men were present at the
meeting, and there is considerable
evidence to show that there will be
greater interest in the game this
year, and keener competition for
places in the club and on the
team.
The fall tournament is to be
played along the same lines as that
of last year, except that two games
instead of three will be played.
This point was definitely settled at
the meeting, and an amendment to
the constitution formally adopting
it was passed.
All games must be finished by
December Ist, and all players who
have not already entered their
names must do so before November
Ist, when the lists will be closed.
Names may be given to R. A. Fuller,
'05. N. C. Powers, '05, or M. M.
Stearns, '00.
One more innovation will be car
ried out during the tournament.
Up to the present time it has been
the custom to select members on
the basis of the number of games
won during the tournament. In
this way men who had only played
two or three gameß were sometimes
able to make the club. This year
players must complete over one
third of the total numberof matches
possible in order to qualify, and
the selection will then be based
upon the percentage of games won
and lost.
There are at present nine mem
bers of the Chess Club in college,and
of these F. B. Whitaker, '05, N. C.
Powers, '05, 11. A. Fuller, '05, M.
M. Stearns, '06, and G. E. Dole,'o7,
have played on the team, and are,
therefore, sure of their places in the
club. This leaves nine places open
to competition.
The following is the list of entries
up to date: E. W. Doane, '04, L.
Gonsalves, '05, J. F. Cahoon, '06,
C. W. Anderson, '06, F. M. Red

players, and L. Newland last year

team, which easily defeated the
Stanford club in a practice match,
Arrangements have been com
pleted with P. B. Neville, a noted
San Francisco chess player, for an
exhibition on the campus during
the early part of December.
