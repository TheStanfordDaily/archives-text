# INTERCLASS SINGLES FINISHED
## G.A. Hodge, '06, Defeats A.R. MacSwain, '08, in the Final Match. 
### 
The final match in the interclass
singles tournament was played
yesterday afternoon between G. A.
Hodge, '06, and A. R. Mac Swain,
'08. Hodge won the match by
the score of 6-3, 7-5, 6-1. Both
men played good tennis through
out the match and it was by far
the best seen on the courts recently.
In the first set Hodge won rather
easily, although Mac Swain played
good tennis. The second set was
the most exciting of the entire
match. Mac Swain started off well
and had the set almost won, the
score being 5-3, when Hodge began
to play a stronger game and finally
pulled up and took four straight
games, winning the set 7-5. It was
in the latter part of this set that
Hodge played his best game and
Mac Swain seemed a little careless.
The final set was won by Hodge
by the score of 6-1. This set was
much more close than the score
would show, as every point was
hard fought. Hodge showed by
his playing yesterday that by
practice next spring with the good
players in San Francisco he will
develop into as good a tennis player
as has represented Stanford for
some years.
