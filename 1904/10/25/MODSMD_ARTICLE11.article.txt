# Women's League.

### 
The executive committee of the
Women's League met this after
noon to discuss plans for the next
meeting of the League. It has been
found difficult to conduct the after
noon receptions, which have been
part of the League's work, so as to
interest the large part of the Uni
versity women. Owing to the nu
merous functions which are sched
uled for the month of November, it
has been decided to omit the recep
tion for that month, and to give an
evening affair on December Ist. It
has been planned to make this a
more interesting meeting than any
of the others, and to this end a
committee, with Miss Julia Boyn
ton, '06, as chairman, was appointed
to furnish the entertainment for the
evening.
