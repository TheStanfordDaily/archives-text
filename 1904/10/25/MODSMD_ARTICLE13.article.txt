# Captain Stroud Out of the Game.
## 
### 
Ben Stroud, captain and center
of the Universityof California foot
ball team, has been taken to a hos
pital, where he will undergo an
operation for an abscess of the
inner ear. It is not expected that
Stroud will be sufficiently recovered
from the effects of the operation in
time to take part in the annual
game between California and Stan
ford. Stroud is a good center and
one of the most popular men on
the eleven. While his loss will be
keenly felt, it will not prove dis
astrous to the team, for in Haffey
California has a very acceptable
substitute.
