We cannot accept the excuse
given by a member of the Plug
Ugly committee and printed in an
other column as a sufficient reason
for the increase in the price of ad
mission to the entertainment at
which the Juniors will dedicate
their plugs. Formerly the Plug
Ugly admission fee was ten cents,
—and the classes always made
money. Last year the price was
raised to fifteen cents, and the Class
of 1905 cleared one hundred and
twenty dollars. There was no
great objection to the rise in prices
last year, because the difference was
a small matter. But even at that
small increase there should have
been general opposition. The Plug
Ugly was not originated as a
money-making institution. It has
long been given as a rough-house
show on the football oval. That is
what we want to see it continued to
be. Theoretically there should be
no admission at all charged to the
Plug Ugly, nor would there ever
have been had it not been for the
fact that a few incidental expenses
connected with the production had
to be met. In that fact the admis
sion fee of ten cents had its origin,
and as it was merely a nominal
amount no one objected. It is
urged by the present Plug Ugly
committee that the play is going
to be elaborate and for that
reason there must be an ad
mission fee of twenty-five cents
charged. The committee would
have shown better judgment had it
made some effort toward ascertain
ing whether or not the college com
munity wants to see the Plug Ugly
turned into an elaborate affair.
Much of the charm of the Plug
Ugly performance has been found 1
in its extreme simplicity and rough
ness; and when anything else is sub
stituted there is going to be great
disappointment among those who
have witnessed past performances

of this character. We are not told
how elaborate the coming event is
going to be, but we are safe in
saying that the student body has
yet to see the Plug Ugly that is
worth more than ten cents for an
individual admission, and we are
certain that the committee in
charge of "A Corner Knocked Off"
will find a difficult task in making
the students and other residents of
the community believe that the per
formance to be given Friday night
will be worth twenty-five cents. It
now seems that the attempt of
1906 class to make a big finan
cial gain from the Plug Ugly
will not be countenanced by the
community, and if an attendance
that will approximate those of for
mer years is desired the price
must be lowered. It may be that
a large number of people will attend
if no change is made in price,—
but in that case the entrance will
surely be effected from the east,
north and south sides of the foot
ball oval, where there are no ticket
offices.
