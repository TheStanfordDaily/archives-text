# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Team Goes Through Fast Signal Work.—Several Changes in Line-up. 
### 
As the members of the football
squad who took part in Saturday's
game had not fully recovered from
the effects of that fast contest, only
signal practice was held last even
ing. The Varsity section was in
charge of Lanagan, while the sec
ond squad worked under the direc
tion of Hauverman. After the
usual work on the tackling ma
chine the two squads worked alter
nately at running down on punts.
The two Nissens, Hyde and Bee
passed the ball, and Sprott, Dole
and Trowbridge did the punting.
Of the four centers, Hyde did the
best passing. It was his first ap
pearance on the field since his
knee was injured several weeks ago.
His passing was fast and fairly ac
curate, but he was a trifle slow in
getting started. J. Nisßen's work
in the Nevada game was a marked
improvement over his former play
ing. His passing last night was
swift, but inclined to be a little
wild. R. Nissen has not complete
ly recovered the use of his injured
shoulders. Bee's passing showed
his lack of experience at the center
position. The punting of Sprott
and Dole was hardly up to their
usual standard.
The Varsity rush-line for the
signal work last night presented
several interesting changes. R. A.
Thompson, whose sprained ankle
has kept him from the field for
over a week, appeared last night at
his old position of left guard.
Thompson's work at the tackle po
sition has proven eminently satis
factory to Lanagan, but he will
probably prove more valuable at
his former position, where his
weight and experience will be of
great assistance to an inexperienced
center. Shields played his old
tackle position. His playing in
the last two preliminary games
showed better form than he dis
played at any time last year.
Hyde was at the center position,
and if his work continues to im
prove he will stand a good chance
of passing the ball in the big game.
