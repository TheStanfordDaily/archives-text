# New Song-books Out.
## 
### 
The new eong-books have been
completed and are now ready for
distribution. They will be placed
on sale to-morrow morning on the
quad and at the Bookstore, and
they may be obtained on the foot
ball bleachers in the afternoon.
The regular price of ten cents a

copy will be charged. Every stu
dent of the University is urged to
obtain one of these books and to
learn all the songs. Only in this
way may the singing for this year
be brought up to the standard set
by other years. The supply is
limited and so those desiring copies
should obtain them at once.
