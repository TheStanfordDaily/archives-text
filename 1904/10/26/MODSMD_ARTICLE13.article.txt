One of the most enjoyable re
ceptions given to the Stanford
musical clubs on their last holiday
tour was at the University of Ore
gon. An opportunity to repay
those who spared nothing to make
the visit of our musical representa
tives a pleasant one will be afforded
us during the next three days
while the University of Oregon
football players will be our guests.
We should make especial effort
to see that the football oval is turned
over to the visiting team for practice
at a certain time each day. The
team will probably wish to practice
early in the afternoon, and when it
is on the field it should be left free
from the gaze of inquisitive specta
tors. This is but one of many cour
tesies that we can extend to our visi
tors. It has been several years
since we have had a Stanford-Ore
gon game, and the impression of
Stanford which the players take
back with them must be a good one.
