# Basket-ball Notes.

### 
The women's ba√üket-ball squad
has been keeping up faithful prac
tice twice a week on the Roble
courts, with the result that the cap
tain has found several instances of
promising material for a good
team. There have been many play
ers in attendance at Monday and
Thursday practices, and it has
been decided to hold a series of in
terclass games for the class trophy.
The arrangements for this series
have not yet been completed. The
chief feature of Monday's practice
was the election of a new manager
to take the place made vacant by
the resignation of Mary Downing
Cocks, '05. Miss Jane Spalding,
'06, was unanimously chosen for
the place. Miss Spalding was a
member of the team that played
the University oi California last
spring.
