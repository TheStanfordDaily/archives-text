# PROGRESS IN TRACK WORK.
## Large Number of Freshmen Out for Fall Training.— General Outlook. 
### 
Fall training on the track has
begun in earnest and there are a
large number of men out for this
preliminary work. There is an un
usual amount of good track ma
terial in the Freshman class this
year, and a great many of the tiret
yea r men have come out on the
track already. More than twenty
old men are out on the track now,
and about ten of these men were in
the last intercollegiate field meet.
Up to the present time there
have been eight men out for the
100-yard dash, and most of these
will also run the 220-yard dash.
E. C. Cope, '08, and R. Gartzmann,
'08, are probably the best sprinters
among the Freshmen. P. A. Wood,
'07, Garfias, '06, Ryone, '07, and
Singletary, '06, are men who have
been out before and whose work
will improve.
In the 440-yard dash R. S. Car
ter, '05, L. G. Russell, '06, A. C.
Freeman, '06, C. F. Elwell, '07, and
L. M. Edwards, '07, are all men
who did good work in the interclass
field meet last spring. There are a
few Freshmen out for the 440-yard
dash at present, arid it is possible
that there are others who will not
come out until the spring. W. C.
Harman, who comes from Bakers
field high school with a good repu
tation as a runner, and F. H.
Abbott, from Lowell high school,
are probably the two best Fresh
men in the quarter.
In the half-mile I. J. Bounds,'os,
who ran a good race last spring, is
again out for this distance. At
present Bounds is the only old man
out for the half-mile, but J. O.
Miller, '08. the fast miler from
Bakersfield, will probably enter
both the mile and the half-mile.
Dunn, '08, a brother of W. F.Dunn,
'04, may be out for the half-mile.
He is running on the track at
present, but he has not yet decided
what event he will enter. C. L.
Severy is also a Freshman who will
probably run in the half-mile.
There are two Freshmen with ex
cellent preparatory school records
out for the mile. They are J. O.
Miller, and Mugler, a miler who has
done some good work at Modesto
high school. At present there
seems to be a scarcity of old men
out for the mile, but there will
probably be several men out before
the handicap field meet.
In the two-mile there are no new
men. L. G. Burr, '05, who made a
fine showing laßt spring in the
intercollegiate field meet, is out
again. W. J. Morin, '05, G. A.
Waring, '05, and F. J. Fraser, '05,
are all old men who will enter the
two-mile.
W. H. Lanagan, '05, who won
both hurdles in the last intercol
legiate field meet, is out for the
hurdles again. C. A. 8a11,'06, who
won a trial heat in the last inter
collegiate, is out for the high
hurdles. J. C. Macfarland, '07,
who won a place in the low hurdles
last spring, is now out for that
event. Among the new hurdlers
F. H. Thomas, '08, and H. L. Hor
ton, '08, two men from Ukiah high
school, seem the most promising.
Thomas is training on the track
now, but Horton is now out for
football.
Captain H. W. Bell, '05, is out
for the high and broad jumps.
There has been no broad jumping

done yet this fall because the regu
lar jumping place is not in any
condition to be used. Besides Bell,
the men on the high jump are A. L.
Kearne, '07, who tied for third in
the Pomona meet last spring, and
F. H. Thomas, '08, and J. R. Pem
berton, '08, from Mission high
school.
W. E. Crawford, '05, who won the
hammer-throw in the last intercol
legiate meet, is out again for that
event. On account of lack of shot
putters this year Crawford is also
trying that event. M. W. Haws,
'05, is also out for the shot-put. C.
E. Hyde, '05, who is playing foot
ball at present, will be out for the
shot-put after football season.
Tomasini, the Freshman football
player, iB reported to be a good man
in both the hammer-throw and
shot-put.
F. P. Whitaker, '05, who won a
place in the pole-vault two years
ago, is now out for that event.
Captain Bell may enter the pole
vault this year, but he will try to
develop some new men. R. A.
Kocher, '08, is the most promising
Freshman now out for the pole
vault.
Altogether, the outlook for track
this year is very good, and it is es
pecially encouraging because of the
number of men out for fall training.
A handicap field meet will be held
about two weeks after the intercol
legiate football game for the pur
pose of getting a line on the work
of the different men.

who won a place in the low hurdles
last spring, is now out for that
event. Among the new hurdlers
F. H. Thomas, '08, and H. L. Hor
ton, '08, two men from Ukiah high
school, seem the most promising.
Thomas is training on the track
now, but Horton is now out for
football.
Captain H. W. Bell, '05, is out
for the high and broad jumps.
There has been no broad jumping

done yet this fall because the regu
lar jumping place is not in any
condition to be used. Besides Bell,
the men on the high jump are A. L.
Kearne, '07, who tied for third in
the Pomona meet last spring, and
F. H. Thomas, '08, and J. R. Pem
berton, '08, from Mission high
school.
W. E. Crawford, '05, who won the
hammer-throw in the last intercol
legiate meet, is out again for that
event. On account of lack of shot
putters this year Crawford is also
trying that event. M. W. Haws,
'05, is also out for the shot-put. C.
E. Hyde, '05, who is playing foot
ball at present, will be out for the
shot-put after football season.
Tomasini, the Freshman football
player, iB reported to be a good man
in both the hammer-throw and
shot-put.
F. P. Whitaker, '05, who won a
place in the pole-vault two years
ago, is now out for that event.
Captain Bell may enter the pole
vault this year, but he will try to
develop some new men. R. A.
Kocher, '08, is the most promising
Freshman now out for the pole
vault.
Altogether, the outlook for track
this year is very good, and it is es
pecially encouraging because of the
number of men out for fall training.
A handicap field meet will be held
about two weeks after the intercol
legiate football game for the pur
pose of getting a line on the work
of the different men.
Fall training on the track has
begun in earnest and there are a
large number of men out for this
preliminary work. There is an un
usual amount of good track ma
terial in the Freshman class this
year, and a great many of the tiret
yea r men have come out on the
track already. More than twenty
old men are out on the track now,
and about ten of these men were in
the last intercollegiate field meet.
Up to the present time there
have been eight men out for the
100-yard dash, and most of these
will also run the 220-yard dash.
E. C. Cope, '08, and R. Gartzmann,
'08, are probably the best sprinters
among the Freshmen. P. A. Wood,
'07, Garfias, '06, Ryone, '07, and
Singletary, '06, are men who have
been out before and whose work
will improve.
In the 440-yard dash R. S. Car
ter, '05, L. G. Russell, '06, A. C.
Freeman, '06, C. F. Elwell, '07, and
L. M. Edwards, '07, are all men
who did good work in the interclass
field meet last spring. There are a
few Freshmen out for the 440-yard
dash at present, arid it is possible
that there are others who will not
come out until the spring. W. C.
Harman, who comes from Bakers
field high school with a good repu
tation as a runner, and F. H.
Abbott, from Lowell high school,
are probably the two best Fresh
men in the quarter.
In the half-mile I. J. Bounds,'os,
who ran a good race last spring, is
again out for this distance. At
present Bounds is the only old man
out for the half-mile, but J. O.
Miller, '08. the fast miler from
Bakersfield, will probably enter
both the mile and the half-mile.
Dunn, '08, a brother of W. F.Dunn,
'04, may be out for the half-mile.
He is running on the track at
present, but he has not yet decided
what event he will enter. C. L.
Severy is also a Freshman who will
probably run in the half-mile.
There are two Freshmen with ex
cellent preparatory school records
out for the mile. They are J. O.
Miller, and Mugler, a miler who has
done some good work at Modesto
high school. At present there
seems to be a scarcity of old men
out for the mile, but there will
probably be several men out before
the handicap field meet.
In the two-mile there are no new
men. L. G. Burr, '05, who made a
fine showing laßt spring in the
intercollegiate field meet, is out
again. W. J. Morin, '05, G. A.
Waring, '05, and F. J. Fraser, '05,
are all old men who will enter the
two-mile.
W. H. Lanagan, '05, who won
both hurdles in the last intercol
legiate field meet, is out for the
hurdles again. C. A. 8a11,'06, who
won a trial heat in the last inter
collegiate, is out for the high
hurdles. J. C. Macfarland, '07,
who won a place in the low hurdles
last spring, is now out for that
event. Among the new hurdlers
F. H. Thomas, '08, and H. L. Hor
ton, '08, two men from Ukiah high
school, seem the most promising.
