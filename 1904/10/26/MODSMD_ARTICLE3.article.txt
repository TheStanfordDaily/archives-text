# Sale of Song-Books.
## 
### 
The new song-books were placed
on sale on the quad this morning
and by noon something over two
hundred copies had been sold, ex
hausting the supply at hand. An
other supply will be obtained from
the printer this afternoon and
placed on sale on the bleachers at
practice. The books also may be
had to-morrow morning on the
quad and at the University Assem
bly. Some eleven hundred copies
have been printed, but it seems
doubtful whether this number will
meet the great demand. The books
are adorned with a very attractive
cover, done in red and white, and
contain fourteen of Stanford's best
songs.
