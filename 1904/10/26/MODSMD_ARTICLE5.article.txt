# WOLF LECTURES.
## Famous Jew Speaks on Egyptian Civilization and Lessons to Be Drawn Therefrom. 
### 
The Hon. Simon Wolf, late Con
sul General to Egypt, spoke before
an interested audience in the chapel
yesterday afternoon. He took for
his subject the causes for the de
cline of Egyptian civilization.
Mr. Wolf first spoke of his pleas
urable surprise at the surroundings
and spirit which he finds at Stan
ford upon this his first visit here.
He eulogized the founders and ex
pressed the boundless opportuni
ties for doing good which their
generosity has made possible.
Turning to the subject of his ad
dress, he said that the fall of Egyp
tian civilization had been due to a
lack of reverence and regard for
the higher aims and sentiments of
life. He described the conditions
in Egypt as they are now and as
the ruins indicate them to have
been formerly, drawing a lesson
from this by which we should
profit. Rather than follow in their
wake and fall victims to com
mercialism and selfishness, we
should cultivate the high ideals
and altruistic sentiment which are
at the base of the modern Ameri
can spirit. And above all we
should regard the grand teachings
of the prophets and the sages,
which have kept the Jewish and
the Christian races in one progress
ive advance, while other peoples
with baser purposes have risen and
fallen with the ages, because of the
unt-ound bases of their civiliza
tions.
