# Work on New Gymnasium.
## 
### 
Rapid progress is being made in
the construction work on the new
Gymnasium. Contractor J. D. Mc-
Gilvray stated to-day that he
thought another month would see
the completion of the stone work.
The rear of the building is already
finished and only in the front
facing is there much work to be
done. Here some of the heaviest
stone work of the University is
being placed. Some difficulty has
been experienced in procuring the
heavy blocks of stone necessary for
the work. Two of the "architrave"
stones that are to be putin will be
solid blocks of stone fourteen feet
in length and five and a half in
thickness, and will weigh over eight
tons each. Special apparatus must
be built to place these stones in
position. The great blocks of stone
composing the heavy pillars lining
the front of the building weigh over
five tons each, and most of these are
already in position. On the com
pletion of the stone work the laying
of the roof and interior work will
be commenced.
Work on the new Library is
progressing favorably. With the
exception of some filling in, the
concrete foundation has been com
pleted. Several loads of stone are
already on the ground and the con
tractors expect to begin the actual
stone work early next week.
The laying of the cornerstone
and dedication will take place the
latter part of November, when
Mrs. Stanford returns from the
Ea√üt.
