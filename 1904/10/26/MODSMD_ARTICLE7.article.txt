## Varsity Scores Against Second Team in a Listless Game. 
### 
Although the Varsity scored one
touch-down against the second
eleven last night, the playing was
spiritless, and without that dash
which distinguished the work of the
first team last week. The second
eleven was strong on the defensive,
and repeatedly held their adversa
ries for downs, but they were un
able to make any substantial gains
when the ball was in their posses
sion. The strongest point of the
second team's work was its ability
to block punts and place-kicks.
The Varsity line was unusually
weak in this respect, and although
the second team punted constantly,
only one of their attempts to kick
waß blocked by the first team play
ers. Several end runs were tried
by the Varsity, but the interference
was so slow in getting under way
that the runner was tackled behind
the line for a considerable loss.
The lack of coherent team work
displayed by the first team waH, in
a measure,,due to the absence from
the line-up of four former Varsity
men, who have been accustomed to
play with the Varsity eleven.
Chalmers played full-back on the
Varsity last night, and his fierce
line-bucking was chiefly responsi
ble for the touch-down. His-sensa
tional 60-yard run from a kick-off
was the most spectacular play of
the evening. Had he not distanced
his interference the run would
probably have resulted in a second
touch-down for the Varsity.
Weller and Clark have not ap
peared on the field in suits this
week on account of slight injuries
sustained in the Nevada game last
Saturday. Brennan and Smith,
who were injured in practice last
week, were on the field last night,
but did not take part in the scrim
mage work.
The University of Oregon foot
ball team will arrive on the cam
pus to-morrow morning. During
their stay the members of the eleven
will be entertained at various fra
ternity houses on the campus. On
Thursday and Friday afternoons
the team will run through signals
and formations on the oval gridiron.
All spectators will be excluded
from these practice periods.

tice was as follows:
