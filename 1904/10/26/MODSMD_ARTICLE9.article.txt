# TO AWARD PUNTING CUP.
## Trophy Offered by Quadrangle Club to be Given to Punter Making Best Average. 
### 
The cup which was offered dur
ing the last football season by the
Quadrangle Club to be given to the
football man making the best punt
ing average is offered again this
year. Owing to the fact that no
accurate record was kept during
the football season of 1903, the cup
was not awarded, and it is now in
the hands of Captain Clark.
At a recent meeting of the Quad
rangle Club plane for the awarding
of the cup were discussed, and it
was decided to pursue the same
plan as was followed last year.
Records of the season's punting of
each contestant are being kept by
Captain Clark and Coaches Lana
gan and Hauverman. At the close
of the season the averages will be
taken, and the cup awarded to the
player having the best record. The
suggestion that a punting tourna
ment be held was not acted upon,
since such a contest would not
fully meet the purpose of the club
in offering the cup, which is to
bring out the best punters in col
lege for the football team. Ac
cordingly the award will be made
from the average of the season, in
consideration of the number of
punts, speed, accuracy, and dis
tance.
The trophy was first offered last
fall to be awarded to the best
punter developed during the sea
son. Under the conditions of the
gift by the Quadrangle Club, the
cup must be won three times to be
come the permanent property of
the winner. Everyman who wins
the cup for one year will have his
name engraved upon it. In the
contest of last season M. P. Hyde,
'05, held the best record while he
was on the field. At the con
clusion of the season the decision
lay between W. H. Dole, '05, and
W. K. Sprott, '06. Sprott's punt
ing for the season was the most
consistent, but Dole's excellent
punting in the intercollegiate
game greatly increased his chances
for winning the cup. Because of
an injury to Sprott's leg, received
in the intercollegiate game, it was
impossible to hold a punting
tournament at the close of the sea
son and thus decide the contest.
