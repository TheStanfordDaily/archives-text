THE BOOKSTORE is taking on so many new photographs
of the University and surroundings that the management has
decided to close out one of the lines that has for years been a
prime favorite, to make room for the new stock.
While they last they will be sold at 20 to 50 per cent reduction.
Call and examine them.
