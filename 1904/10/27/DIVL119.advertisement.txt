Ois for Questions.
"A fool can ask more
Than a wiseman can answer."
Here's nearly a score.
Do you have headaches? Are you ner
vous and irritable? Do your eyes itch,
burn, smart or water? Does your vision
blur at times, especially when reading,
writing or sewing? Must you hold your
book at a greater distance than you
formerly did ? Do your evefs tire easily?
Do you sometimes see double? Do your
eyes become inflamed at frequently re
curring intervals?
Do you have nervous troubles which
medicines fail to relieve more than tem
porarily?
Do you know that all these symptoms
are symptoms of eye strain?
Ilave you "tried everything"? Have
you been "treated" with much expense
and little satisfaction?
Do you believe that we can give per
manent. relief, in most cases, with right
glasses? If you don't believe now,
would you believe if we proved it to you,
if we iitted you with right glasses "that
gave you permanent relief and entire
satisfaction?
We've done it for many others. Why
not you? I>o you know that you run no
risk; that we absolutely guarantee our
work? Do you know that we give a
thorough
EXAMINATION FREE.
