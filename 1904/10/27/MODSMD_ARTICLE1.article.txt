# SEATS ON SALE TO-MORROW.
## Conditions Governing Sale of Various Kinds of Tickets for Intercollegiate Game. 
### 
Tickets for the intercollegiate
football game between California
and Stanford, which is to take
place Saturday, November 12th,
will be placed on sale to-morrow
morning at the oval. The tickets
for the rooters will be on sale from
8:30 until 11, and tickets for the
women and general public will be
on sale in the afternoon from 1:30
to 4.
The price of rooters' tickets
will be $1.50. Only one rooter's
ticket will be sold to each student,
and anyone desiring to purchase
these tickets for others must pre
sent written orders from them.
Under no consideration will tickets
in the rooters' section be sold to
outsiders. Every seat will be re
served. The seats for the general
public will be priced ?,t $1.50,
$2.00, and $2.50, according to situ
ation. The $2.50 seats are in a
section between the rooters and
the alumni, nearly in the center of
the field, and a section next to the
University Club, also close to the
center of the field. There are three
sections of $2.00 seats: one section
next to the rooters toward the end
of the field, and two sections close
to the other end. Two sections at
the extreme ends of the stand will
be sold at $1.50.
This year the rooters' sections of
the two universities will be directly
opposite and will be only two sec
tions removed from the center of
the field. Each section will seat
six hundred and eighty-five. Stan
ford will occupy the west side of
the bleachers, which was the side oc
cupied by the entire crowd at the
Freshman game. The total ca
pacity of the new bleachers is
15,548, of which some thirteen
hundred will be occupied by rooters,
about the same number by alumni,
by the University Club and by the
California Club. The rest of the
seats are for the benefit of the gen
eral public.
An unusual feature of this year's
game will be the presence of an or
ganized body of Stanford alumni.
In response to communications sent
out by Secretary C. F. Wright, '96,
of the Alumni Association, some
350 alumni have already responded
with orders for seats. The Univer
sity Club of San Francisco, an
organization embracing in its mem
bership graduates of all univer
sities, will occupy the two center
sections on the same side as the
Stanford rooters and directly oppo
site the California Club. There will
be rallies of alumni in San Fran
cisco and San Jose the night before
the game, when final arrangements
for attendance will be made.
