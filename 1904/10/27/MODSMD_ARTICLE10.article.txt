# Many Rooters' Hats Ordered.
## 
### 
The number of rooters' hats or
dered this year is not in a great
degree smaller than it was last
year. It is expected that about
twenty-five dozen hats will have
been ordered at the close of the
time for handing in names. Those
who do not order hats will prob
ably experience some difficulty in
getting them, since the Haber
dasher will not have any extra
hats in stock. To-morrow is the
last day on which orders will be
taken, and those who wish hats
and have not yet placed their order
should do so without delay. Names
will be taken by 0. B. Taylor, '06,
and G. O. Spurrier, '06, in Encina
Hall.
