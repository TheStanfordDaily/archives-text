Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Will you kindly permit the Plug
Ugly committee space in your col
umns for the expression of certain
views?
The Daily Palo Alto states edi
torially that the Plug Ugly has
long been given as a "rough-house"
show, and that the present commit
tee is seeking to turn it into an
elaborate affair. In the first part
of this statement the editor is, we
think, but partly right; in the sec
ond part we think he is wholly in
error. The Plug Ugly when first
started was truly a "rough-house"
affair, but we do not think it is any
longer. There has been a gradual
development into something better,
something in which those who are
not greatly interested in the plug
smashing sequel can be interested.
The crude edges of early Plug Uglies
have been polished off, so that
pleasure may be secured from the
production itself. There has been
no sudden reform by any one class,
but no class has done as much to
promote what we must regard as
beneficial change as has that of '05.
Credit was given to the Plug Ugly
of last year as the best ever pro
duced. The Juniors went to great
trouble and larger expense with
the affair, and the result seemed to
fully justify them. For a large
majority of the audience it was the
principal part of the show, and no
one was heard to complain that
their hour of pleasure was not worth
the price they paid.
It is stated editorially that the
Plug Ugly was not originated as a
money making institution. But
here again the situation has
changed, and here again the Class
of '05 has gone a step further than
have other classes. There was no
valid reason why they should not.
They had taken great pains with
their production, which certainly
did not enrich them extravagantly,
nor did it impoverish those who
paid. The charge kept no one from
the performance, and the charge of
twenty-five c ents, proposed by the
present committee,reraainariominal.
Whether or not admission ought
to be charged for a Plug Ugly is,
unfortunately, a matter that to-day
we can discuss from the material
istic standpoint alone. As in the
case of all college activities, the
ideal is to have them free of any
charge. But the financial needs
of the day are such that we have to
look at things from a financial
viewpoint. The expenses of the
upper classes ore constantly grow
ing. Class dances and farces cost
more because those who go to them
demand that they be put on in bet
ter style. Result: more cost and
smaller revenue. The ultimate re
sult, is seen in the heavy drains
upon the senior class in its graduat
ing year. It is too early to tell
what the fate of '05 will be, but no
better example can be found than
the case of '04, whose senior week
expenses are yet unpaid. The com
mittee is told on the best authority
that after regular Quad assessment,
and a special one to make up the
deficit after the book was out, two
further assessments were levied to
cover the expenses of senior week,
which failed signally to pay its own
way. The inability of some to meet
the demand left a deficit which ex
ists to-day, after the class has been
several months out of college. A
third assessment has been consid
ered, but not levied, because those
who had paid the others absolutely

refused to provide any more money.
Among other things, '04 was try
ing to establish a permanent class
secretaryship — one of the finest
moves ever made toward keeping
warm the bonds of friendship of
Stanford men and women after
they have passed out through the
University's portals into the great
er world. A certain sum of money
was put aside for the expenses of
carrying on that fine work. Then
came knowledge of the deficit, and
the question arose whether this
money, already appropriated and
paid out for one purpose, could be
used for another. At last accounts
the situation was this: The deficit
must be met largely by those of the
Class of '04 who remain about the
University, or the fund set aside
for the permanent secretaryship
must be sacrificed. The first course
would be a hardship upon the few
who must pay to save the class
name; the second would be a dis
tinct backward step, and the most
useful thing done by '04 in its col
lege career would be undone.
Contrast with this the case of '05.
That class in some way accumu
lated a surplus — partly through
the profits secured from the Plug
Ugly, and partly because of the
striking success of their farce, "The
Man from Mizzoury." With that
surplus the clans has been able to
do one thing at least that has re
flected the greatest credit upon it.
and has set an example of generos
ity for all future classes. When it
was proposed to send a track team
to the competitions of the Middle
West by general subscription, the
Class of '05 came forward and
without a minute's hesitation gave
$100 to that end. Such useful
things as helping track teams or
boating clubs, or establishing per
manent class secretaryships, can
be done only when a class has the
necessary revenue. The story of
'06 remains to be told. At the
present time it has in its treasury
the sum of $1. D. D. Sales,

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Will you kindly permit the Plug
Ugly committee space in your col
umns for the expression of certain
views?
The Daily Palo Alto states edi
torially that the Plug Ugly has
long been given as a "rough-house"
show, and that the present commit
tee is seeking to turn it into an
elaborate affair. In the first part
of this statement the editor is, we
think, but partly right; in the sec
ond part we think he is wholly in
error. The Plug Ugly when first
started was truly a "rough-house"
affair, but we do not think it is any
longer. There has been a gradual
development into something better,
something in which those who are
not greatly interested in the plug
smashing sequel can be interested.
The crude edges of early Plug Uglies
have been polished off, so that
pleasure may be secured from the
production itself. There has been
no sudden reform by any one class,
but no class has done as much to
promote what we must regard as
beneficial change as has that of '05.
Credit was given to the Plug Ugly
of last year as the best ever pro
duced. The Juniors went to great
trouble and larger expense with
the affair, and the result seemed to
fully justify them. For a large
majority of the audience it was the
principal part of the show, and no
one was heard to complain that
their hour of pleasure was not worth
the price they paid.
It is stated editorially that the
Plug Ugly was not originated as a
money making institution. But
here again the situation has
changed, and here again the Class
of '05 has gone a step further than
have other classes. There was no
valid reason why they should not.
They had taken great pains with
their production, which certainly
did not enrich them extravagantly,
nor did it impoverish those who
paid. The charge kept no one from
the performance, and the charge of
twenty-five c ents, proposed by the
present committee,reraainariominal.
Whether or not admission ought
to be charged for a Plug Ugly is,
unfortunately, a matter that to-day
we can discuss from the material
istic standpoint alone. As in the
case of all college activities, the
ideal is to have them free of any
charge. But the financial needs
of the day are such that we have to
look at things from a financial
viewpoint. The expenses of the
upper classes ore constantly grow
ing. Class dances and farces cost
more because those who go to them
demand that they be put on in bet
ter style. Result: more cost and
smaller revenue. The ultimate re
sult, is seen in the heavy drains
upon the senior class in its graduat
ing year. It is too early to tell
what the fate of '05 will be, but no
better example can be found than
the case of '04, whose senior week
expenses are yet unpaid. The com
mittee is told on the best authority
that after regular Quad assessment,
and a special one to make up the
deficit after the book was out, two
further assessments were levied to
cover the expenses of senior week,
which failed signally to pay its own
way. The inability of some to meet
the demand left a deficit which ex
ists to-day, after the class has been
several months out of college. A
third assessment has been consid
ered, but not levied, because those
who had paid the others absolutely

refused to provide any more money.
Among other things, '04 was try
ing to establish a permanent class
secretaryship — one of the finest
moves ever made toward keeping
warm the bonds of friendship of
Stanford men and women after
they have passed out through the
University's portals into the great
er world. A certain sum of money
was put aside for the expenses of
carrying on that fine work. Then
