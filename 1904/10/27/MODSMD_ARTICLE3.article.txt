# INTERCLASS TENNIS FINISHED.
## Hodge and Guyer Win Final Match of Tournament for the Juniors. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the inter
class doubles tournament was fin
ished. In the final match of the
tournament G. A. Hodge and C. G.
Guyer, the Junior class team, de
feated A. R. Mac Swain and P. B.
Delano, the Freshman representa
tives. The score was 6-1, 6-1, 6-1.
This match was easily won by
Hodge and Guyer, as the Fresh
men were somewhat tired after their
match with J. F. Cassell and T. B.
Brown in the semifinal match.
Mac Swain and Delano played a
hard match with the Sophomore
team, Cassell and Brown, and
finally won by the score 6-4, 10-8,
6-4. Although this match was
long, neither team played up to
past form.
The matches played yesterday
end the tournaments for this semes
ter. Next spring there will be the
usual intercollegiate try-outs. In
the meantime the three Encina ten
nis courts will be kept in good order
and there will be a better opportu
nity for practice than has ever been
afforded before.
