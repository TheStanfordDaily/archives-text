# ENGLISH CLUB MEETS.
## Will Present Play Next Semester. Executive Committee to be Reorganized. 
### 
At the meeting of the English
Club, which was held last night at
the Delta Upsilon house,several mat
ters of importance came up for dis
cussion before the regular program
of the evening was begun. For
Bome time past the English Club
has begun each year with a defi
nite purpose in view; either the
presentation of a play, or some
other work of a literary nature.
Last year the club was occupied
with the compiling of a "History of
Stanford," which will appear in
completed form about the first of
December; and the year before wit
nessed the unusually successful pro
duction of'The Knight of the Burn
ing Pestle." After considerable
discussion, it was finally decided
that the work of this year should
be the presentation of another play.
Just what play is to be given has
not yet been decided upon, but the
matter has been putin the hands
of a committee, of which Instructor
L. E. Bassett is chairman. Several
types of plays have been suggested,
but it is probable that one of the
older type will be selected, and that
it will be presented sometime in
March or April.
The adoption of a play is partly
due to a suggestion from the Boat
Club, that the two organizations
should combine in presenting one.
While unwilling to agree to this
proposition, the English Club will
see that the Boat Club shall not be
the loser, although the latter will
not be able to give a play of its
own.
Another matter of extreme im
portance arose in an attempt to
readjust the powers and duties of
the executive committee for the bet
ter interests of the club as a whole.
As the executive committee stands
to-day, it has controlled practically
all the business that has come be
fore the club, especially the nomi
| nation of ofiicerw and of new mem
bers. This system has not proved
altogether satisfactory in the past,
and it is now proposed to change it
so that all the members may have
more active share in the affairs of
the club, and may take a corres
pondingly greater interest in them.
Instructor E. K. Putnam, H. A.
Moran, '05, Miss J. L. Culver, '96,
and A. R. Fletcher, '05, were ap
pointed as a committee by Presi
dent I). M. Reynolds to look into
the matter, and if need be, to frame
an amendment to the constitution
of the club, and present it before
the next meeting.
The regular program of the
(evening included a very interesting
talk on Robert Louis Stevenson by
Associate Professor H. \V. Rolfe.
Professor Rolfe began by discussing
the essentials of character that are
necessary for success among all
men. It is the combinations of
qualities, not any single highly de
veloped quality, that results in the
highest degree of success, a degree
which was reached by Steven
son.
Later in the evening a musical
program was rendered by G. P.
Jones, '06.
