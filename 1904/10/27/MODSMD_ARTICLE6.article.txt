# COMMANDER MOORE'S ADDRESS
## Thorough Review of the United States Navy Given at Assembly This Morning. 
### 
At the University Assembly held
this morning Commander C. T. B.
Moore, U. S. N., gave an interest
ing talk on "The Navy â€”Its Organ
ization and Achievements." He
hegan by discussing the executive
branch of the navy, and showed
the part taken in the world of
naval action by the bureaus of
yards and docks, steam engineer
ing, construction and repair, med
icine and surgery, supplies and ac
counts, equipment, ordnance and
navigation. These are departments
which supply all the material
necessary in maintaining a well
balanced navy.
Commander Moore explained how
the United States drills and edu
cates its officers for the important
offices they have to fill. They not
only engage in theoretical study,
but they are sent out on ships and
learn from practical experience
what duties befall officers. The
first appearance in the navy of this
higher class of men is in the ca
pacity of ensign. Their promotion
depends almost wholly on seniority,
but partially on behavior and pro
fessional fitness. While this method
of promotion exists during times of
peace, there are times when the na
tion is at war when some men
through valuable service skip sev
eral rounds in the ascension ladder.
The career of the apprentice was
next discussed. In this connection
the speaker dealt with the work of
the apprentice boys on Goat Island.
Those who begin their navy life in
this capacity are not eligible to the
rank of higher officers including
admiral. The apprentice in his
first work at the training station is
taught the details of personal con
duct. After considerable work at
the station they are eligible to work
on the training ship, a type of this
kind of vessel being the U. S. S.
Pensacola, now stationed at Goat
Island. After a regular course of
training the apprentice boys are pro
moted to positions of minor author
ity, the highest position to which
an apprentice is regularly eligible
being a third-class pett} 7 officer.
The best class of young men in this
department can sometimes attain
the position of warrant officer, or a
chief petty officer, which is the
highest non-commissioned office.
During the past few months the
supply of officers from the naval
academies has not been sufficient to
fill the offices accruing from the
rapid construction of naval vessels,
and as a result some of the best ap
prentice officers have been given
regular ensign positions where they
have the chance to advance in the
same order as the naval cadet.
Besides the personnel, the organ
ization of the warship itself is a
very important factor in a navy's
success. The ship is separated
into divisions, each of which has its
commanding officer. The main
