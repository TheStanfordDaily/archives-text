# COMMANDER MOORE'S ADDRESS
## Thorough Review of the United States Navy Given at Assembly This Morning. 
### 
At the University Assembly held
this morning Commander C. T. B.
Moore, U. S. N., gave an interest
ing talk on "The Navy —Its Organ
ization and Achievements." He
hegan by discussing the executive
branch of the navy, and showed
the part taken in the world of
naval action by the bureaus of
yards and docks, steam engineer
ing, construction and repair, med
icine and surgery, supplies and ac
counts, equipment, ordnance and
navigation. These are departments
which supply all the material
necessary in maintaining a well
balanced navy.
Commander Moore explained how
the United States drills and edu
cates its officers for the important
offices they have to fill. They not
only engage in theoretical study,
but they are sent out on ships and
learn from practical experience
what duties befall officers. The
first appearance in the navy of this
higher class of men is in the ca
pacity of ensign. Their promotion
depends almost wholly on seniority,
but partially on behavior and pro
fessional fitness. While this method
of promotion exists during times of
peace, there are times when the na
tion is at war when some men
through valuable service skip sev
eral rounds in the ascension ladder.
The career of the apprentice was
next discussed. In this connection
the speaker dealt with the work of
the apprentice boys on Goat Island.
Those who begin their navy life in
this capacity are not eligible to the
rank of higher officers including
admiral. The apprentice in his
first work at the training station is
taught the details of personal con
duct. After considerable work at
the station they are eligible to work
on the training ship, a type of this
kind of vessel being the U. S. S.
Pensacola, now stationed at Goat
Island. After a regular course of
training the apprentice boys are pro
moted to positions of minor author
ity, the highest position to which
an apprentice is regularly eligible
being a third-class pett} 7 officer.
The best class of young men in this
department can sometimes attain
the position of warrant officer, or a
chief petty officer, which is the
highest non-commissioned office.
During the past few months the
supply of officers from the naval
academies has not been sufficient to
fill the offices accruing from the
rapid construction of naval vessels,
and as a result some of the best ap
prentice officers have been given
regular ensign positions where they
have the chance to advance in the
same order as the naval cadet.
Besides the personnel, the organ
ization of the warship itself is a
very important factor in a navy's
success. The ship is separated
into divisions, each of which has its
commanding officer. The main
authority comes from the admiral
or senior officer stationed in the
conning tower or on the bridge in
time of battle. The men in each
turret constitute one division, com
posing the primary battery. The
next division is formed by the sec
ondary battery, which is made up
of ail the small calibre guns. The
third division is the signal corps,
which carries messages forthecom
manding officers, and has charge
of the ship's signals. These officers
are usually filled by young men or
boys, who give quick service.
Commander Moore gave an ac
count of the regular day's work on
ship from the time the cook is
called until the men retire at night,
including the cleaning of the deck,
inspection, drill and afternoon
ehore-leave. The men, other than
the officers, sleep in hammocks.
Each man has a locker and a small
treasure-box in which to keep his
private belongings.
"The sailor is a peculiar sort of
a chap, a mixture of the barbarian
and the poet," said Mr. Moore.
When a sailor gets shore-leave he
usually is unacquainted and is
lonesome, so he picks up ithe only
companions wh<» are obtainable
and has a good time. So if he acts
the part of a rowdy he is not wholly
to l)bime.
"He is a poet because he appre
ciates the artistic nature and
beauty of his surroundings, ami
has vivid tealization of it all."
The ordinary sailor is fond of
pets and his fondness does not pur
sue any well-defined lines, for pigs,
dogs, cats, goats, pigeonß, arma
dillos, and eagles all serve the pur- j
pose.
In dwelling upon the achieve
ments of the navy, Commander
Moore showed that in every con
flict in which the United States
had been concerned the navy had
been a very important factor in the
nation's success. In some cases
where the dignity of the nation
was at stake, humiliation resulted
owing to the fact that the United
States had a weak navy and could
not enforce its demands. Com
mander Moore closed by saying
that "you want a strong navy in
time of peace to be insured of
peace."
