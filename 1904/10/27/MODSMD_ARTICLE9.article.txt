In an editorial which appeared
in last Tuesday's issueof this paper
concerning the raise in price of ad
mission to the Plug Ugly a state
ment was made which has given
rise to considerable misunderstand
ing. The intention of the Daily
Palo Alto was to point out certain
reasons why the price of admission
should not be raised, and also cer
tain evils that would result from
the change. To make clear the po
sition taken by the paper, we wish
to state that it was far from our in
tention to encourage any movement
on the part of seniors or others to
gain admission to the Plug Ugly in
any manner other than the ordi
nary way. Scarcely a Plug Ugly
has been given to which a crowd
did not, in sport, try to effect an
entrance over the fence; and in
raising the price it was thought
that such a movement would be
encouraged, —and that is what we
desired to point out to the commit
tee. It must be distinctly under
stood that any crowd of students
who scale the fence, or interfere
with the performance given by the I
Juniors, will be doing an act which ;
will not be countenanced by the
thinking and influential students I
of the University.
