Ris for Rest—
For your nerves and your eye,
The help that iB needed
The right glasses supply.
This is a common complaint: "My
eyes seem all right until I try to read or
sew, then they tire right out."
Many defective eyes can endure the
strain required for distant vision, hut
when they come to any near work they
are often already tired, and the added
strain results in pain and discomfort.
Many people who wear glasses for
reading and close work need glasses for
distance also.
The distance glasses will relieve all
strain and the eyes will then reserve all
their power of accommodation and con
vergence to use on the closer work.
Normal eyes, or eyes made artificially
normal with right glasses, will do a vast
amount of work without pain or strain.
If your eyes tire easily it is a sure
sign that they are overtaxed. The only
way to help them is to quit your work
or wear right glasses.
If you don't want to quit your work
come to us and get glasses that are
" RIGHT—JUST RIGHT."
