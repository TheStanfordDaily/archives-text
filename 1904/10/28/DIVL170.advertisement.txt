Helpfulness

a desire to be of assistance. At such times

often the wrong thing is done and the right
thing left undone. The first thing to do in

Pond's Extract—the old family doctor—a.
recognized emergency remedy, for over 60
years ÜBed by nurses, physicians and hos
pitals. Every student should have a bottle
close at hand. Quickly stops bleeding In
deep cuts; cures bruises, sprains, and pre
vents muscles Incoming sore from gym-
Snasium exercises; re
lieves earache, toothache,
rheumatism and all pains.
Soothes and freshens the
face after shaving. Watered
Witch Hazel, a weak solu
tion—sometimes offered in
place of Pond's Extract
has no medicinal value—is
positively worthless. Pond's
