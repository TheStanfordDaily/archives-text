# VARSITY VS. OREGON.
## Stanford Team Will Meet Strong Eleven from North To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
The Varsity will meet the strong
eleven from the University of Ore
gon on the campus gridiron to-mor
row afternoon. Although the aver
age weight is less than 165 pounds,
the Oregon eleven this year is one
of the fastest, and in many respects
the best eleven ever developed in
the Northwest. For the first time
in the history of Oregon football
the state university team is receiv
ing the benefits of coaching from a
player who made the Ail-American
team. Dick Smith, the coach, was
full-back and captain of the Colum
bia eleven last year. He is a grad
uate of the University of Oregon,
and played on the team which de
feated California in 1900. Since
that time he has been playing at
Columbia, where his work attracted
wide attention from football critics
and followers of the game. Smith
has taught his charges the Eastern
style of play, and will rely on speed
rather than weight to gain distance
in to-morrow's contest.
Oregon lost to California last
Saturday by the score of 12 to 0.
Both touch-downs were made by re
peatedly hammering the light Ore
gon center trio, which was unduly
weakened by the presence of a sub
stitute center, who took the place of
the regular occupant of that posi
tion early in the game. Hug,
who was injured in the Cali
fornia game, will not be able to
play to-morrow, and his place at
center will be filled by McClain.
Smith has succeeded in develop
ing a strong team from the ma
terial available at the state univer
sity of Oregon, but he has been
badly handicapped by a lack of
heavy men for the line positions.
The guards average 178, while the
tackles strip but 166. The ends
tip the scales at 159, and the hacks
162. Latourette has been rated for
some time as the best quarter in
the Northwest, and his playing in
last Saturday's game indicates that
the title is not undeserved. J. H.
Templeton, captain and right half,
is an excellent punter and good
ground gainer. Frank Templeton,
his twin brother, plays right guard,
and is noted for his fierce defensive
playing. The Templeton brothers
learned to play football at Mt.
Tamalpais Military Academy, and
they are the youngest members
of a family of boys that have been
prominently connected with Oregon
athletics for some time. Chandler,
Oregon's right end, is another star
whose previous record proves him
a formidable player. Chandler
played on the Portland Academy
eleven on the same team with Chal
mers, Stott, and Fenton.
When questioned concerning the
outcome of to-morrow's game
Coach Smith said, "Of course, Ore
gon will suffer from a lack of
weight in the line, but the men are
quick and active and play with
great determination. I shall be
satisfied if Oregon holds the score
down to a reasonable figure."
To-morrow's game will be the
second contest between football
teams representing Oregon and

Stanford. The strong Varsity
eleven of 1900 defeated the Oregon
team of that year by the score of
34 to 0.
The Stanford team will go into
the contest to-morrow better pre
pared than for any previous
preliminary game this season.
Although several of the players are
suffering from minor injuries, none
are so severely hurt as to keep them
from the field. It is probable that
every prominent candidate for the
Varsi y will be given a chance to
get into the game at some stage of
the contest to-morrow.
The line-up for the kick-off will
be as follows:

terial available at the state univer
sity of Oregon, but he has been
badly handicapped by a lack of
heavy men for the line positions.
The guards average 178, while the
tackles strip but 166. The ends
tip the scales at 159, and the hacks
162. Latourette has been rated for
some time as the best quarter in
the Northwest, and his playing in
last Saturday's game indicates that
the title is not undeserved. J. H.
Templeton, captain and right half,
is an excellent punter and good
ground gainer. Frank Templeton,
his twin brother, plays right guard,
and is noted for his fierce defensive
playing. The Templeton brothers
learned to play football at Mt.
Tamalpais Military Academy, and
they are the youngest members
of a family of boys that have been
prominently connected with Oregon
athletics for some time. Chandler,
Oregon's right end, is another star
whose previous record proves him
a formidable player. Chandler
played on the Portland Academy
eleven on the same team with Chal
mers, Stott, and Fenton.
When questioned concerning the
outcome of to-morrow's game
Coach Smith said, "Of course, Ore
gon will suffer from a lack of
weight in the line, but the men are
quick and active and play with
great determination. I shall be
satisfied if Oregon holds the score
down to a reasonable figure."
To-morrow's game will be the
second contest between football
teams representing Oregon and

Stanford. The strong Varsity
eleven of 1900 defeated the Oregon
team of that year by the score of
34 to 0.
The Stanford team will go into
the contest to-morrow better pre
pared than for any previous
preliminary game this season.
Although several of the players are
suffering from minor injuries, none
are so severely hurt as to keep them
from the field. It is probable that
every prominent candidate for the
Varsi y will be given a chance to
get into the game at some stage of
the contest to-morrow.
The line-up for the kick-off will
be as follows:
