In reference to the editorial
which appeared in the Daily Cali
fornian of October 25th, charging
Stanford with buying athletes, and
referring particularly to the case of
E. C. Cope, '08, we wish to say
that we do not believe that any
number of California's students
are in sympathy with the senti
ment expressed. We believe that
the Btudent body of California holds
the Stanford student body and its
officers in higher esteem than the
editorial would indicate. It is
very unfortunate that statements
of this nature should be made
when there is no reasonable ground
whatever upon which to base them.
