# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS.
## Addresses the Y.M.C.A. on Its Mission and Place in the University. 
### 
Dr. Jordan spoke before theY. M.
C. A. in the chapel last night.
He characterized the address as his
"annual epistle" to the association.
He emphasized the side of religion
of doing, as distinct from the re
ligion of feeling, of ceremonials;
and said that the aim of the Chris
tian associations has been to repre
sent work for religion and work for
virtue without formality and cere
mony. He pointed out the differ
ence between the fields of university
work and city work for the Y. M.
C. A. What is needed here by the
association is practice in wisdom
and virtue. Wisdom is knowing
what to do next,and virtue is doing
it. The duties of the members
should be to keep an organization
which should maintain religious
activities in a helpful and sensible
way. To this point he admonished
them to hold aloof from any at
tempt to control politics, and from
any tendency to boorishness by
tiresome personal solicitation. A
man loses his influence as soon as
he becomes a bore by harping on
some subject. No better example
of sagacity could be followed than
that of Christ himself, who in all
his teachings showed the greatest
of wisdom and consideration in
dealing with people.
In some respects the Christian
associations are like the primitive
church, in their lack of form and
ceremonials; they practice the sim
plicity which it was intended by
the early builders of the church
should be followed. Theecclesiast
icism and formality that has grown
up around the original creed has
served to destroy much of the
strength in the religion which
Christ really taught. The mission
of the association lies in overcom
ing theae ceremonials and practic
ing the religion of action. Dr.
Jordan pointed out what the
authority of religion truly covers,
and showed how it has become so
perverted through the centuries of
ecclesiasticism that many are led to
mistake the form and the creed for
the essence, and so become skeptical
because from that viewpoint they
cannot honestly accept it. There
is no room for doubt of the ele
ments of Christianity, but there is
more or lesß for doubt of the syl
logism which has grown up about
it. Theocracy is bo mixed up with
Christianity that some are led to
doubt its elements. Dr. Jordan
cited among other instances the
ceremony of the Last Supper, which
has been taken out of its primitive
simplicity and made mystic partly
by fanaticism and partly by super
stition.
The Christian religion shows why
we act according to the will of God.
It is not true because Christ said it,
but Christ said it because it is true.
It is the original Truth. The
oriental imagery of the Bible has
been adopted too literally, and its
beauty and simplicity has often
been lost in an attempt to live
strictly according to the letter
rather than to the spirit. But in
spite of all this mysticism and per

version, the simplicity which has
survived gives us the true concep
tion upon which to build. By
living simple, virtuous and clean
lives, an example of good, practic
ing the religion of doing rather
than that of mere feeling or cere
mony, we may follow the true mean
ing of Christianity.
