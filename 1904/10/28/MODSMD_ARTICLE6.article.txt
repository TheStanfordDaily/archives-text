The Combined Musical Clubs are
planning to make their holiday tour
through Southern California this
year. This will be the fourth time
that the organization has played
in the south, the last trip being
made during the holiday vacation
in 1899. Although the itinerary
of the trip has not been definitely
decided on as yet, the clubs will
probably visit the cities in which
performances were given during
the last southern trip. This will
include the following cities: San
Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ven
tura, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa
Ana, Pasadena, Riverside, Red
lands, San Bernardino, Pomona,
Bakersfield, Tulare, Fresno, Han
ford, Merced, and Stockton.
