Sis for Students—
Some suffer much strain.
Satisfactory glasses
Will stop all the pain.
Parents should look carefully to the
welfare of -their children. Be sure that
their eyes are in proper condition to
stand the work of the college year.
Students, if you want to do your
college work easily, get your eyes right
before the examinations begin,
Those who had trouble with their eyes
last year will be almost sure to have the
same kind of trouble again this year.

trouble is due to your eyes or not, come
and see us. We will examine them
carefully and tell you just their con
dition. We will not fit you with glasses
