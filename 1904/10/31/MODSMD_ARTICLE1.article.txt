# STANFORD WINS, 35 TO 0.
## Varsity Defeats University of Oregon Football Team in Fast Game. 
### 
In a game which showed that
the team possesses great scoring
power, Stanford defeated the foot
ball eleven from the University of
Oregon 35 to 0 on the campus
gridiron Saturday afternoon. Both
teams played a determined game,
and one of the most pleasing feat
ures of the contest was the gritty,
gentlemanly game played by the
Oregonians in face of inevitable de
feat. In spite of the fact that every
inch of ground was fiercely con
tested by the Northerners, no rough
work was indulged in, and the offi
cials did not inflict a single penalty
on either team during the progress
of the match.
From the Cardinal standpoint
the vigorous offensive game played
by the Varsity Saturday was par
ticularly pleasing since it seems to
indicate a speedy scoring power not
attained by the team in any pre
vious game this reason. The ball
was fumbled only four times during
the game. It was recovered twice,
and fell into Oregon's hands the
other two times. Stanford was not
held for downs once, and Oregon
made her distance only one time.
The ball was in Oregon's possession
twice during the first half, and only
once in the second. Very little
kicking was done by either team,
the Varsity punting once, and Ore
gon twice.
The Northern team showed
evidence of careful coaching,
but their speed did not compensate
for their lack of weight, and this
handicap was especially felt against
the heavy mass plays which Stan
ford hurled at the line. Although
unable to stop the line plunges of
the heavy Varsity backs, the Oregon
team was very successful in pre
venting end runs.
The line-up was as follows:

Six touch-downs were made,
Weller scoring three, Dole one, and
Brennan and Bogle one each.
Sprott kicked four goals, and Tom
asini made one and failed once.
Stanford relied entirely on straight
football to gain her distances, and
the center trio of the Oregon line
was the especial point of attack.
Weller made the longest buck of
the game by breaking through cen
ter for a gain of 25 yards. With

the exception of a slight tendency
to fumble, Weller played in better
form than he has exhibited in any
previous game this season. Chal
mers never failed to hammer the
line for at least five yards on
each buck. Brennan was almost
equally effective at the line smash
ing game, and dashes outside of
tackle by Dole and Trowbridge
never failed to gain. The line men
were given a chance to carry the
ball, and they were always good
for short gains.
