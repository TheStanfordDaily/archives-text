The matter of holding a debate
with the University of Nevada
during the present college year, will
soon come before the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents, and there seems little doubt
that the sanction of that body will
be given. It is the general feeling
among those particularly interested
in debating that it will be a good
move to accept the Nevada chal
lenge. Every attempt that is made
to widen the field of debating at
Stanford acts as an incentive to
bring out material for that line of
activities, and just at the present
time there is not an overabundance
of good debaters in the field. Every
year we should have a debate of
secondary importance in order that
speakers for the succeeding year may
have an opportunity to get some
valuable experience and training.
The Nevada debate will serve such
a purpose this year, and if it is de
cided to hold the contest we may
look forward to next semester as
one that will be alive with interest
in debate.
