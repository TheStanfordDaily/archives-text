The Rev. Dr. Gardner preached in
Memorial Church Sunday morning.
His text was from Mark xiv, 38,
"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter
into temptation. The spirit truly
is ready but the flesh is weak."
Dr. Gardner said that as physical
health is ruined by disease, so
spiritual health is marred, and
often ruined, by moral evil. Mod
ern civilization has two great
agencies at work for the benefit of
mankind: one dealing with natural
things—science; the other dealing
with spiritual things — religion.
They are not antagonistic, but each
works in its own sphere. We ac
cept, in a general way, the findings
of both, but with regard to our
moral health we are woefully ig
norant and imprudent. Dr. Gard
ner then took up the subject of
Temptation as one of these ele
ments, treating it from three propo
sitions: That our natural instincts
and passions lead us often into
temptation; that we should face
the temptations arising from our
environments; and that the worst
form of moral weakness and wick
edness is the deliberate walking
into temptation.
