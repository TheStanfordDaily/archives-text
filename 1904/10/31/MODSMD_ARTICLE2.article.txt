Word has been received from the
University of Wisconsin negotiat
ing for a football game the Mon
day after Christmas, between either
Stanford or the University of Cali
fornia. Wisconsin desires that the
game be played in San Francisco,
and in case arrangements are com
pleted for a game, it would no
doubt draw a larger crowd than
the game last year between the
Carlisle Indians and Reliance Club.
