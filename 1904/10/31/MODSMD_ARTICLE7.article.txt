# SOPHOMORE PLAY SELECTED
## "The Rivals" Will Be Presented Early Next Semester by the Second-Year Class. 
### 
After careful consideration the
Sophomore play committee has de
cided upon "The Rivals, 1 ' by Sher
idan, as the play to be presented by
the Sophomore class the third week
of next semester. At the last meet
ing of the Sophomore class it was
decided to present some standard
play, and a committee was ap
pointed to choose the play. This
committee was also given power to
make all arrangements for the pro
duction of the play.
"The Rivals" was decided upon
as one of the best available com
edies, and it is expected to be thor
oughly entertaining. This play
was first produced in London in
1775 and was generally conceded to
be better than " The School for Scan
dal," by the same author. "The
Rivals" is considered the better
play, although it has not been pro
duced as often and consequently is
not so well known. However, this
lack of familiarity with the play
will increase the interest in the pro
duction.
The play is full of action and
there is an abundance of clever
dialogue, while there are innumer
able humorous situations which are
sure to amuse an audience. The
committee has engaged Mrs. J. C.
Powers to select the cast that will
present the play. Mrs. Powers is
well known for her dramatic abil
ity, being a graduate of the Emer
son School of Oratory at Boston
and also of the Columbia School of
Chicago. The players will be
chosen within the next three weeks,
in order to get the parts learned as
soon as possible.
To make this play distinctly a
class production the cast will be
chosen from members of the Soph
omore class who try for places, thus
making the success of the comedy
due wholly to the second-year stu
dents. For the sake of making the
production a success, all Sopho
mores who have had any experi
ence in acting are urged to come out.
The work of staging the play will
be in charge of D. M. Reynolds, '05,
who has staged the University
plays given during the past two
years. New scenery will be pur
chased for this production, and the
costumes will be especially designed
for the play. The committee in
charge of the Sophomore play con
sists of: Miss M. A. Moore, Miss L.
Norvell, J. F. Cassell, \\. G. Bate
man, and D. H. Clift, chairman.
Those who wish to try for the cast
should hand in their names to one
of the members of this committee
as soon as possible.
