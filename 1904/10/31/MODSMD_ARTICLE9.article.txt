# '06 PLUGS DEDICATED.
## Successful Presentation of Annual Junior Festivity on Oval Friday Night. 
### 
The production of the annual
Junior Plug Ugly on the oval Fri
day night was attended by fully
fifteen hundred people. The Plug
Ugly was entirely successful, and
netted a large sum for the Class of
1906. The production was up to
the average standard, but was not
as good as the farce presented last
year. The original music and songs
were not as catchy, and the plot
and local hits were not so strong.
On the whole the presentation was
good. The acting of the chief char
acters was well caried out, the part
of Bustyou, taken by R. H. Lach
mund, being particularly well
acted. The characters of Ustandin
& Co., Snohomish, and Patkinskin,
taken by P. C. Edwards, J. L. Ma
loy and S. G. Jewett, were good, and
the minor characters were well sus
tained.
The plav opens with a meeting
of the Junior class in the chapel,
called for the purpose of getting
plugs for the class members. Louie
Spot, of Laylow Park; Bustyou,
Lord Mayor of the quad; and
Ustandin & Co., of Palo Alto, get a
corner on the Junior hat, with the
intention of holding it for a high
price. The committee in charge of
the purchase of plugs is charged by
the class to get the hats, or be ex
pelled from the class. At this
juncture MacSnohomish, president
of the Republican Club, promises
to get the hats for the committee,
but when questioned as to how he
will do it, replies that it is a polit
ical secret. He discovers that a
trust has been formed to corner the
plugs, and finally succeeds in
bringing the combination to terms.
The plugs are then secured and
given to the class.
Some difficulty was experienced
by the Juniors in gaining an en
trance to the inner quadrangle, but
they finally succeeded in complet
ing the traditional march around
the quad, which proved to be the
best Plug Ugly struggle that has
taken place between Seniors and
Juniors since the Class of 1903 ded
icated their plugs.
