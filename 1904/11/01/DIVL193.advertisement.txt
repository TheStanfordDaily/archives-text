is for Teachers,
And each one should know
That often 'tis eye-strain
Makes students so slow.
The most successful teachers are those
who look carefully to the moral and
physical as well as the intellectual de
velopment of their pupils.
When a student does not like school
and stud}', the reason for the dislike
should he diligently sought.
Sometimes it is the fault of teacher or
parents. Oftener it is due to some de
fect of mind or body which makes study
irksome. Often it is simply an eye de
fect.
The greatest service a teacher can ren
der such a seemingly dull or backward
student is to insist that the eyes be care
fully examined and their defects cor
rected.
In many cases this will transform a
dull and troublesome pupil into a bright
and studious one and win the life-long
gratitude of both parents and child.
We take particular pains with young
people, and by our own special method
are often able to give satisfaction where
others have failed.
