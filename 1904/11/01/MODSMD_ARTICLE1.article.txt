# ROOTERS' MEETING.
## Preliminary Song Practice Will Be Held To-morrow Night. 
### 
A meeting of Stanford rooters is
being arranged for to-morrow night
from 7:15 to 8:15. The meeting
will be of the nature of a song and
yell practice, but is called princi
pally for the purpose of considering
new plans to be used in rooting at
the intercollegiate game. Every
man who expects to be in the root
ing section at the game should at
tend the meeting to-morrow night,
since it will probably be the last
gathering of rooters before the final
rally to be held in the Assembly
Hall on Thursday night, Novem
ber 10th. Impromptu speeches
will be made and the songs printed
in the new books will be practiced.
The practice to-morrow night
will probably be held in the chapel.
Application was made for the use
of the chapel on Monday morning,
but permission to hold the rally
there has not yet been granted.
In case the permission is withheld,
the Assembly Hall will probably
be secured. If this plan fails the
rally will be held in some other
suitable place. The place of meet
ing will be announced on the bulle
tin-boardson the quad to-morrow.
