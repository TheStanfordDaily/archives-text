# HAMLET TO BE PRESENTED.
## Ben Greet's Players Will Give the Play in the Elizabethan Manner. 
### 
Detailed arrangements have been
completed by the faculty entertain
ment committee and the English
Club for the production of " Ham
let '' on the afternoon and evening
of Saturday, November 19th, by the
Ben Greet players, who recently
presented " Much Ado About Noth
ing." "Hamlet" will be given in
full according to the second quarto
and first folio version. As the play
is ordinarily given on the stage to
day it is cut down about one-third,
but in the Greet production only a
few lines will be omitted. With
the customary intermissions for
change of scenery the play would
occupy six hours, but in the Eliza
bethan stage, where the scenery
remains fixed, only about four and
one-half hours are needed. By
dividing the production so that
part will be presented in the after
noon and part in the evening, the
spectators and players have a
chance to rest. This will be an ex
cellent opportunity to see the play
in full as it was written by Shak
spere and as it was acted in his
own time. It has been given twice
before in the United States, once by
Forbes Robertson at Harvard and
last month in the Greek theater at
Berkeley by the same players who
are to produce it here. As the
Berkeley performance was given
immediately on the arrival of the
players from England there was
not time for sufficient rehearsals to
give the play the tone and finish
that the added rehearsals are ex
pected to give it here.
Another thing that will make the
Stanford performance of especial
interest is that the Elizabethan
stage built by the English Club for
the production of the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle" will be used.
Mr. Greet was very much pleased
when he found that such a stage
was available at Stanford, saying
that it would be much more effect
ive than ordinary scenery and more
in keeping than the severe back
ground of the Greek theater.
Ab the number of players de
manded for the production of
" Hamlet" is very large, a number
of the University students will take
part. These students have been
selected by Instructor Bassett and
were given a preliminary rehearsal
by Mr. Greet when he was here.
Owing to the fact that this is the
only remaining opportunity to see
" Hamlet" produced in the Eliza
bethan manner on the Coast, there
promises to be a large demand for
seats from outsiders. Arrange
ments have been made for the run
ning of a special train from San
â€¢Jose and it is possible that one may
be run from San Francisco also.
Detailed announcements in regard
to the sale of seats will be made
later.
