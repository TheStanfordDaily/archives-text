Every spring it has been found
necessary to spend a considerable
amount of money in repairing and
getting ready for use the baseball
diamond. This has been occasioned
very largely by lack of care and
by travel over the field during the
rainy season; and since there has
been no practice to necessitate keep
ing the field in shape during this
semester, it must be expected that
the diamond will be in worse shape
next spring than it has been for
some time, unless some move is
made toward protecting the field.
Now is the time to act, for heavy
rains may occur at any time, and
then unless there are some barriers
erected to keep delivery wagons off
the field the same trouble of former
years will be experienced. And it
is not only delivery wagons that
do harm to the field, — walking over
the ground when it is soft makes

the surface uneven when the field
dries, and the result is a great deal
of expensive work in leveling off the
diamond. Each student should see
to it that he does not cross the dia
mond during rainy weather, and
furthermore he should constitute
himself guardian of the field and
not hesitate to warn all others whom
he may see making that part of the
campus a thoroughfare.
