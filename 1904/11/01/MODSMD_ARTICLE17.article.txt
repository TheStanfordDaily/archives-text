# Latin as Universal Language.

### 
In The Medical Record for July
30th last appears an article which
urges the desirability of recording
scientific facts in some language
that may be understood by all
educated men. The writer shows
how various attempts in the way
of artificial languages have been
failures, and then urges that we
go back to Latin, not indeed for
the body of scientific articles, but
for preliminary abstracts, from
which the reader may judge of the
value of what follows if he can not
read the language in which it is
written. Such an abstract, it is
claimed, would be understood, for
example, by an educated physician
whether he were French, German,
Russian, or Japanese.
The plan thus advocated is actu
ally adopted in the transactions of
one of the London scientific so
cieties, and has recently been initi
ated at Cornell University, where
the "Studies from the Department
of Neurology" under the direction
of Dr. C. L. Dana, present each
article preceded by an abstract in
Latin.
