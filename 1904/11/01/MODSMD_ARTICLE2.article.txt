# Sale of Football Tickets.
## 
### 
The pale of theater tickets at the
Bookstore this morning continued
to be heavy. About one hundred
tickets were sold, comprising those
on the main floor and the
lower balcony. As the sale in the
city has also been good, a large
attendance is assured for the night
of the game. There are still a
number of desirable seats which
have not been sold, but those who
want them must apply at once.
The tickets will be on sale at the
Bookstore until Friday, November
11th, when those remaining will be
taken to the city and disposed of at
the theater. The sale of football
tickets was also very fair yesterday
and the total sold is now about
$2,350. No tickets will be sold
here after Saturday.
