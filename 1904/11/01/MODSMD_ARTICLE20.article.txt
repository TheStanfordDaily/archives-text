# LAST NIGHT'S PRACTICE.
## All the Men in Good Physical Condition.â€”Late Signal Practice in Gymnasium. 
### 
As iB usual on Mondays the foot
ball squad went through light sig
nal work, and did not line up for
heavy scrimmage practice. Some
time was devoted to punting, and
the work of Dole, Sprott and
Trowbridge at this department of
the game was above the average.
Their kicks were of good range and
well placed. The accuracy of the
punters was tested in punting out
from the goal-line for a favorable
position to try for goal.
With the exception of Tomasini,
who had his ankle severely sprained
in the Oregon game, every player
on the squad was able to appear for
practice last night. The last week
has witnessed fewer injuries than
any previous week of the season.
The chief cause for this immunity
from injuries is the excellent physi
cal condition of the men, and for
the remainder of the time before
the big game Trainer Moulton will
take extraordinary precautions to
prevent his charges getting stale.
A short period after dinner every
night is devoted to signal practice
in Encina gymnasium, and this
work will now be the regular order
until the annual game with Cali
fornia.
Walter Hemphill, head coach of
the Pomona College team, which
was defeated by California last Sat
urday, was an interested spectator
at last night's practice. He would
not hazard an opinion as to the
comparative merits of the two var
sities, but expressed regret that his
team could not meet Stanford this
season. While on the campus,
Hemphill, who has general charge
of athletics at Pomona College, pro
posed a joint track meet between
Stanford and the southern institu
tion for next spring. The date is
so remote that Manager Barrett
was unable to give a definite an
swer, but it is probable that the
track team will take a trip to
Southern California next semester.
