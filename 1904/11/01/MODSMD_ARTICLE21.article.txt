# Photograph Contract Awarded.
## 
### 
J. L. Maloy, business manager of
the '06 Quad, has completed ar
rangements with Steele Bros., of
Palo Alto, for taking the class pho
tographs that will appear in the
annual. Several bids were received
from other Palo Alto firms, but that
offered by Steele Bros, was the most
reasonable, and the contract was
accordingly awarded to them.
Steele Bros, are the successors of
Dudley & Co.. who did the photo
graphic work for the '04 Quad, and
occupy the same quarters on Uni
versity avenue.
Upon paying the Quad assess
ment of $3.00, Juniors will receive
slips, which are to be presented
when photographs are taken. The
business manager wishes to em
phasize the fact that all Quad
assessments must be paid by the
end of this semester. If anyone
fails to do this for any reason
whatsoever, that person's photo
graph will under no circumstances
appear in the annual.
