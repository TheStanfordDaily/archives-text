# BUILDINGS BEING EQUIPPED.
## Many Departments Being Furnished. Physics Department Gets New Apparatus. 
### 
A large consignment of tables,
cases, chairs, shelves, and other
furnishings has recently arrived at
the University and is waiting for
distribution in the halls of the
Zoology and Physics buildings.
Much of it will eventually be used
in completing the equipment of the
departments of Botany, Zoology,
Physiology, Psychology, and Phys
ics, which are housed in the north
west 'corner of the quad. These
buildings are the latest part of the
quadrangle to be occupied, and
their equipment has never been
completed more than to insure
their temporary use. With the
present outfitting, however, they
will be in fairly good shape.
The present consignment is part
of an order that was made some
time ago with the intention of fin
ishing the equipment of most of
the departments that occupy rooms
on the front of the outer quad.
The estimated amount of the order
at the time was approximated at
$12,000, but only a small part of
this has arrived. The rest is ex
pected in a short time.
The department of Physics is the
one which is receiving the most at
tention at present. It is the only
department which is being fitted
with new-apparatus, as well as new
furnishings. Up to the present
time it has been severely handi
capped by lack of apparatus and
more especially by lack of sufficient
lighting power. While there has
always been the amount of elec
tricity sufficient for illuminating
purposes, it has been necessary to
omit certain courses in heat, for the
reason that there was neither a
supply of gas nor of electricity suf
ficient to make possible the per
formance of certain experiments.
A new electrical plant is being put
in now, which will probably cost
about $3,000 and which will be
completed in the course of a few
weeks. Besides this, $5,000 worth
of new apparatus has been ordered,
and when this arrives the work of
the department will be greatly
aided. The amount of furnishings
supplied to this department alone
can approximately be estimated at
$1500.
The Psychology department re
ceived during the summer new ap
paratus amounting to somewhere
in the neighborhood of $800, a list
of it being published in the Daily
Palo Alto early in the semester.
No more apparatus has been given
it now, but it has received a large
amount of furnishings.
The other departments have all
received considerable necessary ap
paratus in the last few years, and
although still in need of more, are
at present in good working con
dition. All have received a part
of the furnishings, especial!}' the
Botany department, which has been
supplied with a large number of
cases for use in the herbarium.
