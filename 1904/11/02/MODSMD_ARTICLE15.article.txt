# CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL.
## State University Team in a Slump. Graduate Coaches Appear on Field. 
### 
Just at present the University of
California football team is suffering
from a severe slump, and the
coaches are adopting heroic meas
ures to whip the eleven into shape
before the big November game. The
fact that over half of the places on
the eleven are still unsettled is
causing Coach Hopper additional
worry, and he has called upon
prominent graduate players to as
sist him in selecting the final team
which will meet Stanford Novem
ber 12th. Dr. Frank Simpson, head
coach in 1901; Albertson,captain of
tne 1902 team; and Hudson,end on
last year's eleven, have appeared oil
the California gridiron to assist the
present coaches.
Considerable alarm is felt by Cal
ifornia partisans over the fact that
neither of the guards nor any of the
backs, and only one end, have been
picked for the first team from the
two dozen available candidates.
The most constant line-up of the
team for this week's practice has
been as follows: Stroud, center;
O'Toole and Stern, guards; Heit
muller and Force, tackles; Elliott
and Howard, ends; Booth, quarter
back; Kern and Snedigar, half
backs; Sperry,full-back. Belknap's
greater experience may yet win him
the quarter - back position over
Booth. If Gray and Kerr recover
in time from their recently sus
tained injuries they may be able to
displace O'Toole and Stern at the
guard positions. Elliott has demon
strated his superiority over Henry
and Oliver, and he will probably
keep his place at end.
Beginning with yesterday secret
practice was commenced on the
California gridiron, and as it will
be kept up until the date of the big
game little opportunity will be
given to watch the further progress
of the team.
