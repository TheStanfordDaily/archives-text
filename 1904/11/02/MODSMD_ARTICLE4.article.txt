# FOOTBALL PRACTICE.
## Varsity Plays Good Game Against the Second Eleven.â€” Utah Players Arrive. 
### 
Weather conditions were ex
tremely favorable for fast football
last night, and the Varsity took
advantage of it by scoring two
touch-downs on the second eleven.
Shields and Bansbach did not line
up with the first eleven, but the
second team was equally crippled
by having some of its best players
held in reserve on the Varsity
squad. Both touch-downs were of
the spectacular order, and made
after long runs. Aided by superb
interference Chalmers made a
touch-down after receiving the ball
from a punt. Just before the
whistle ended the match Brennan
made a long dash outside of tackle
for a touch-down.
Although the playing was occa
sionally slow the players showed a
slight improvement over the work
of last week. The most notable
advance was in the formation of
interference, which has gradually
improved by acquiring greater
speed and compactness, until this
department of the game is ap
proaching Varsity form.
Although the matter has not yet
been definitely settled, it is not
probable that secret practice will be
held on the oval gridiron before
next week. At present consider
able time is devoted to secret signal
formation every night in Encina
gymnasium, and it will not be
necessary to hold many secret prac
tices on the gridiron.
G. W. Smith, '06, who suffered
severe internal injuries in a scrim
mage two weeks ago, is again able
to take part in regular heavy prac
tice.
The line-up was as follows:
