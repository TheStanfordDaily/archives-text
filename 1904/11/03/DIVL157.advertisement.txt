' Both comfort and pleasure
As long as we live.
There is certainly nothing which so
effectually shuts one out of the pleasures
and activities of life us the loss of vision.
This being true, how important it is that
we do all in our power to preserve our
eyes and thus retain our vision all
through life.
Many eyes are permanently injured by
neglect. A slight defect which was
thought to be unimportant has been
neglected until it has undermined the
power and acuteness of the delicate
visual centers.
Whether you have the slight defect or
the long neglected one, or merely the
failure which comes with advancing
years, rinht glasses should be worn to
protect and preserve the sight.
A little care now may save you much
suffering and regret later on. Don't put
it off. The sooner the easier in eye care.
