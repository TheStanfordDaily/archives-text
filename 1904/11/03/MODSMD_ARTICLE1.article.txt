## Varsity Candidates Making Hard Fight for Positions on the Team. 
### 
Although the preliminary foot
ball season is almost over the num
ber of candidates on the held
remains practically undiminished.
The second team this year is one of
the best substitute elevens ever de
veloped on the Stanford gridiron.
There are enough men on the squad
to form a third team which is but
slightly inferior to the usual second
eleven.
The principal Varsity candidates
are in excellent physical condition,
and extraordinary care will be
taken by coaches and trainer to
prevent them from becoming over
trained. For this reason tlie men,
who have been playing regularly
on the first team, were permitted to
take part in the scrimmage work
for only a few minutes during last
night's practice game. The teams,
which played during the greater
part of the contest, were a second
and third eleven.
The end positions are represented
bv a larger number of candidates
than any other place on the team,
and should either of the men
chosen to fill those important
positions be compelled to retire
from the game, his place can be
acceptably filled. Captain Clark
will certainly occupy his old place
at left end, as his work this season
has been even better than last year.
G. W. Smith, '06, who played right
end in the intercollegiate game last
year, has been out of the game on
account of an injury sustained two
weeks ago, but he is again out for
hard work and is rapidly rounding
into form. Smith's most formid
able rivals for the end posi
tion are West, Stanford, Preston
and Butterfield, all of whom are
playing excellent ball just at pres
ent, and Smith will have to play in
his best form to retain his place.
Sprott and Shields are playing
their tackle positions in brilliant
form, and they will undoubtedly
hold down these places in the inter
collegiate game. S. Thompson,
Sprague, Tomasini and Horton are
working hard for the privilege of
going into the game in case Sprott
or Shields should be displaced on
account of injuries. For the guard
positions Thompson and Roosevelt
are the heaviest and most ex
perienced candidates, and they
seem destined to face the California
guards in the big November game.
Haselwood, Monzingo and Van
Sickle will make good substitutes
for their veteran rivals. J. Nissen
is fighting hard for the privilege of
passing the ball, but Hyde is play
ing a more reliable game, and will
in all probability complete the cen
ter trio in the final line-up. From
present indications there will be no
changes from last year's line-up in
the back field. Bansbach's game
is gradually improving and his
generalship and superior experience
will win him the quarter-back
position over his fast competitor,
Stott. Dole and Chalmers are
fighting hard for their positions
over Trowbridge and Brennan, hut
their former experience on the Var
sity will probably win the positions.

Weller is assured uf his position at
full-back. Just at present he is not
appearing in the Varsity line-ups,
as he is overtrained, and the trainer
has advised a cessation of hard
work on his part. Bogle plays a
good defensive game at full-back,
but he is weak at line-bucking.
Chalmers has played full-back, and
he may go in at that position if
Weller should be injured.
