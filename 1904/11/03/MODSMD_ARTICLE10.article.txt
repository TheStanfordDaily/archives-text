The Phi Beta Kappa is the old
est Greek letter society in America.
It was established in 1776 at Will
iam and Mary College in Virginia.
At first it was a secret society, but
mainly literary with the usual
literary programs of essays and
debates, and an was natural at the
time, there waß a good deal of dis
cussion of political questions.
Charters were granted to Harvard
and Yale in 1779, and to New
Hampshire in 1787. No additional
chapters were created until 1817.
In 1832, as a result of the anti
masonic agitation, the "secrecy" of
the society was removed. In some
chapters, members are not elected
until after graduation. In most of
the chapters, however, the elections
occur during the senior year, and
in some cases partly during the
junior year. Phi Beta Kappa has
always stood pre-eminently for
literature and scholarship, and its
membership has been, in general,
restricted to the best scholars of
each graduating class.
The by-laws of the local chapter
printed below give the qualifica
tions for membership, and the
method of election which will be
observed in the new chapter. As
is customary at the establishment
of a new chapter, members will be
elected from all the classes who
have graduated from the Univer
sity. The first election in accord
ance with the by-laws will take
place this present month.
