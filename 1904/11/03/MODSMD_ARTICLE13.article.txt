In the raid upon the training
house after the L'lug Ugly by those
seeking "souvenirs" of the occasion,
a girl's shawl which had been worn
by one of the actors was taken.

it believed it to lie one of the ordi
narystage properties, but diligent
inquiry since has failed to find any
trace of it. Personal property has
never been regarded as legitimate

son the shawl should be returned at
the earliest possible moment.
