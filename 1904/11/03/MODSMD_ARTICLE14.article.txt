The Daily Palo Alto publishes
this evening the entire constitution
and by-laws of the local chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa. The general in
terest which will be taken in this
organization and its conditions of
membership by Stanford alumni
and the University community
warrants us in giving space to the
printing of the whole matter. One
of the most important features of
the by-laws is the fact that former
Stanford graduates are eligible to
membership. This provision makes
membership possible to many
brilliant students who have been
so entitled, but who otherwise
would be deprived of the honor
simply because no chapter existed
here when they were in college.
The announcement of the first elec
tion will be awaited with no small
interest by both undergraduates
and alumni.
