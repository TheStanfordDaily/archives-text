# Arrangement of Chapel Meetings.
## 
### 
Notice has been given out from
the Business Oflice of the dates on
which the use of the chapel has been
authorized for meeting purposes of
the various University organiza
tions. The schedule includes only
the meetings of those organizations
that have followed the rule of ar
ranging to use the chapel through
the President's office, with the con
firmation of the Business Oflice.
The notice is sent out as a result of
several irregularities that have oc
curred in using the chapel for the
holding of meetings. The plan pro
vided will prevent any conflicts in
different meetings, and keep the
Business Office informed of the
times when the chapel is in use.
The same rule applies to the other
buildings as well as to the chapel.
Permission to use them should be
obtained before any meetings are
held in them.
Hereafter the use of the chapel
will not be granted for the holding
of rallies, rehearsals, or for any
meetings that are of a rough or
boisterous character. The fact that
the room was formerly used as a
place of worship and should still
preserve its traditional nature, for
bids its use for large gatherings
very different in character.
Thus far the use of the chapel
has been granted for meetings
as follows: University Orchestra,
Wednesday evening; Glee Club,
Tuesday and Friday evenings;
Girls' Glee Club, Thursday, 4:30;
Young Men's Christian Association,
Thursday evening for occasional
meetings; Young Women's Chris
tian Association, Tuesday, 4:30.
