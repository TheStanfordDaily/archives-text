# Successful Song Practice.
## 
### 
The song and yell practice held
in Assembly Hall last night was
well attended. The meeting was
opened at 7:15, and continued for
about an hour. During that time
most of the songs and yells that
will be used at the intercollegiate
game were practiced. At the sug
gestion of the yell leaders certain
changes were made in the style of
rendering the yells and songs which
make the cheering much more
effective than it has been. The
band was present and furnished
the music to lead the singing. It
is probable that another practice
will be held before the final rally.
The next practice may be held
early next week, probably on Mon
day night. The necessity of creat
ing a good standard of rooting this
year to compete with the improved
cheering of the California rooters
makes a large attendance at the
bleachers and practices very desir
able.
