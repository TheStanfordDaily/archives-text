# ART CONTRIBUTIONS NEEDED.
## Loss of Former Artists Creates Difficulty in Getting Art Material for '06 "Quad." 
### 
Owing to the graduation and de
parture of many of the artists who
have supplied the Junior annuals
of the last few years with much
high-class work, considerable diffi
culty is being experienced in find
ing the usual amount of good art
work for this year's Quad. Chief
among the artists who will be
missed this year are R. W. Bor
ough, '04, and B. C. Bubb, '04,
both of whom took their degrees in
May. Both of these artists con
tributed an unusually large amount
of fine work each year, and their
places will be hard to fill; Miss
Clara Lathrop, '06, who also con
tributed a considerable number of
drawings, is out of college this se
mester, but will return next spring.
Each year a large amount of the
art work of the Quad is done by
graduates, especially by a few
who were prominent as under
graduates in the same line of work.
R. K. Culver, Bristow Adams, and
R. E. Renaud have never failed to
assist the editors with their work,
and generally that work has ranked
with the very best published in
the annuals. Other names might
be mentioned in the same category.
This year it is hoped that the
alumni will help out in the same
way, and several have already
promised to do so, but it is still
more desirable that there should be
the usual amount of undergradu
ate work, along with the rest.
All drawings, or communications
concerning the art department of
the Quad, should be sent to Miss
Alice Hayes, '06. It is desirable
that all drawings should be handed
in by the end of this semester.
