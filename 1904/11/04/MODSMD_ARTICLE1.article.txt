# LAST CAMPUS GAME.
## Varsity Will Meet Eleven from the Utah Agricultural College To-morrow. 
### 
The last preliminary game of the
football season will take place on
the campus gridiron to-morrow
afternoon when the Varsity meets
the Utah Agricultural College team.
It is not likely that Stanford will
have much difficulty in defeating
the Utah eleven, as that team is in
a badly crippled condition. In a
fiercely contested game against the
University of Washington two
weeks ago several of the players
were badly injured. Several others
were hurt in the Corvallis and
Multnomah games, and Coach
Campbell reports that he has been
unable to enter the same team in
two consecutive games. At present
only four out of a squad of seven
teen players are entirely uninjured.
Madsen, captain and left tackle of
the team, was so badly injured in
the Multnomah game that he may
be unable to take part in to-mor
row's contest. Besides a torn ankle
from the Washington game, Olsen,
the big right tackle, and one of the
veteran members of the team, is
suffering from two cracked ribs
which were fractured in practice
yesterday.
Last year the Utah team made
a good record in the Rock)'
Mountain district, not being scored
against once during the sea-
Bon. This season, however, the
team was chiefly recruited from
men who have never played foot
ball before. The team is composed
of heavy, sturdy players, but they
are greatly handicapped by their
inexperience. From his success
with the team last year, it is ex
pected that Coach Campbell will
ultimately succeed in developing a
very capable eleven from the avail
able material at hand. The Pacific
Coast trip is taken by the team in
preparation for its annual game
with the University of Utah.
Three games have been played thus
far on the trip. Washington de
feated the Utah eleven by the score
of 45 to 0, and the Oregon Agricul
tural College beat them by the
same score a week later. Last
week the agricultural team sus
tained a 29 to 0 defeat at the hands
of the Multnomah Club eleven of
Portland. Until the best men on
the team had been retired by in
juries the Utah eleven outplayed
the clever clubmen, but the sub
stitutes who went into the game
were no match for the Multnomah
players, who scored at will for the
remainder of the game.
Since its arrival on the campus
the team has lined up twice for
practice. Yesterday the squad en
gaged in heavy scrimmage work,
but the danger of further injury to
his crippled charges induced Coach
Campbell to forego any severe play
ing in the practice held on the
oval this afternoon.
The Varsity will be in better
shape for to-morrow's contest than
for any other game this season.
Not a man is so badly injured that
he will be kept from the game, and
Trainer Moulton reports that the
players are it) excellent physical
condition. It is probable that

every prominent Varsity candidate
will be given a chance to play in
to-morrow's game, and in the case
of at least two positions to-mor
row's contest will determine the
players who will face California
next week.
Saturday's game will be the last
chance to see the Varsity perform
before the big game, as secret prac
tice will commence on the oval
Monday night.
