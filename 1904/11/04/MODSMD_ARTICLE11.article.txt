To-morrow afternoon the Varsity
will play the last preliminary game
of the season. Not only will this
be the last game, but it will also be
the final opportunity which the
public will have to see the Stanford
team line up before the players go
on the field at California one week
hence. Secret practice is scheduled
to begin on the oval Monday at five
o'clock, and from that hour no one,
not even the most loyal supporters
of the Cardinal, are supposed to
know anything in regard to the
condition of the men, or the move
ments of the squad. Secret prac
tice is instituted for a number of
reasons, principal among which
are the removal of the squad from
excitement caused by crowds of
spectators, and the putting into
practice certain tactics that are for
the knowledge of coaches and play
ers only. That these ends may be
reached, no one must see the prac
tices. Newspaper correspondents
and others will not be allowed
within the oval, and it is not a dif
ficult task to keep them out. But
there are other places from which
the practice can be plainly seen,
and it is these that special effort
should be made to keep vacant. It
is only necessary to ask the major
ity of the members of the commun
ty to do the r part in matters of
this kind and they will do it. But
there are always a number of
strangers, and some few others who
force themselves into places where
they are not wanted, and it is to
avoid that class that we urge the
gymnasium officials to keep closed
the east windows of Encina gym
nasium, and the members of Encina
Club to see to it that the advanta
geous view offered by the dormitory
is not abused during the secret
practice of next week. The coaches
and team are doing their best, and
it devolves upon others to assist
them whenever they can, even in
small matters.
