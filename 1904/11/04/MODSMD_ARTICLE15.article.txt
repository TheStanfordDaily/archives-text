# How Yale Sells Tickets.
## 
### 
In connection with the discussion
that arises every year as to the
method of distribution of football
ticketH for the big games, an ex
cerpt from the'Yale Alumni News,
showing how they manage the sale
at a college where they have had
great experience, will be of unusual
interest. The extract, which covers
merely the broad principles of the
system, is as follows:
"1. Any graduate or undergradu
ate may make application for three
seats at the Yale-Princeton game
at Princeton, and three seats at the
Yale-Harvard game at New Haven.
"2. Any Yale man may apply
for one seat in the cheering section.
By so doing he forfeits his right to
any more seats elsewhere. Applica
tions for seats in the cheering sec
tion must not be pinned together,
but men will be seated there by
classes. Under no circumstances
will ladies be admitted to the cheer
ing section.
"'3. (a) Seats will be allotted in
the cheering section first; that is in
the center of the field. Then will
come the coaches and players. Af
ter the above are attended to the
order will be as follows:
'■(?>) Academic and scientific
seniors.
"(c) Academic juniors.
il (d) Graduates alternating with
Sheffield juniors.
"(c) Graduates alternating with
sophomores, and second and third
year men not Yale graduates in
the professional schools, and grad
uate department.
"(/) Remaining graduates.
•'(7) Academic and Scientific
freshmen, and first-year men in the
professional schools, and graduate
department, but who are not Yale
graduates.
"(a) No free tickets are to be
given to any one, not even to the
players and coaches.
"5. No graduate may transfer by
written authority the privilege of
his application to .another. Every
application must be made out by
the applicant, every applicant being
held responsible for his own tickets.
"6. Each applicant is responsible
for the tickets allotted him. Any
Yale man whose tickets are found
in the hands of a speculator will be
posted in the list kept in the foot
ball office and denied the right of
securing tickets by application.
"7. The distribution of tickets
will be by lot under the rules above
outlined, and under the supervision
of a committee who shall give such
attention to the matter as to be able
to attest the accurate application of
the system."
