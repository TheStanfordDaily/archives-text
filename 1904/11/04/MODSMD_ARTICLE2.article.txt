### 
Following closely on the election
of the new manager for the
women's basket-ball squad comes
the announcement of renewed
activity in that branch of college
athletics. The plan to hold class
games has resulted in the election
of captains and managers for the
various classes, but it will be two
or three weeks before final arrange
ments can be completed. The '06
team is the first to announce its
choice, of Miss Mary Betz as cap
tain and Miss Emma Hayward as
manager.
The '08 class team has chosen
Mies Gertrude Plummer as captain
and manager.
The '05 and '07 teams have not
yet chosen their captains and man
agers, but are expected to do so in
a few davs.
