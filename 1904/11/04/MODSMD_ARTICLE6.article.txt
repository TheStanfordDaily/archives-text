# NEW CHEMICAL ENGINES.
## Fire Equipment of the University Receives Valuable Addition. 
### 
The fire equipment of the Uni
versity has received a very valu
able addition in the way of two
chemical engines of the "Stempel"
type, which are now being set up
at the power-house. When com
pleted one of the engines will be
placed at the fire-house, and the
other will be stationed somewhere
near the quad. The new engines
are mounted on substantial two
wheel trucks, which are arranged
to be pulled by hand, as is the other
fire apparatus of the University.
On each truck is mounted a brass
tank of forty gallons capacity, with
the necessary valves and working
parts, fifty feet of three-fourths
inch hose, and accessory apparatus
such as fire-axes and the like.
With the exception of size and
truck, the engines are the exact
counterpart of the standard chemi
cal engines in use by the San
Francisco fire department.
When under working pressure
the engines send a stream of car
bonic acid gas in the form of a
dense vapor to a distance of fifty
feet from the nozzle of the hose.
This will enable them to fight suc
cessfully a fire in any building on
the campus.
A recent report from the Mc-
Allister street fire-house in San
Francisco, where two chemical en
gines of the "Stempel" type are
used, shows that these engines
pay for themselves three times a
year in the value of property that
they save. The new additions to
the Stanford department should
more than double the present fire
fighting efficiency.
Definite arrangements as to the
crews that will have charge of the
new apparatus have not as yet
been made. It is probable that
others outside of the fire-house
proper will be instructed in their
use, so that in case of fire there
will be no careless handling of
the machines. While very simple
when understood, they are danger
ous machines in the hands of a
novice.
The engines are constituted of
heavy rolled copper-plate, with the
furnishings in brass and the truck
and wheels painted a durable red.
"Stanford No. I" and "No. II" are
inscribed on them.
The addition of this new appar
atus puts the University fire system
on a most effective basis. Besides
the new engines the fire appartus
now consists of three hand-truck
hose-carts, each carrying five hun
dred feet of three-inch hose, and
a inodernjy equipped hook-and
ladder. The latter carries one long
extension ladder capable of reach
ing some sixty feet, a twenty-five
foot ladder, and a lighter scaling
ladder. Two hand chemical fire
extinguishers, several fire-axes,
buckets, etc., complete the equip
ment. Added to this Stanford has
a modern fire-house, occupied by a
student crew.
