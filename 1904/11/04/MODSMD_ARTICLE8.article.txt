# STUDENTS TO AID IN "HAMLET"
## Names of Stanford People Who Will Participate in the Greet Production. 
### 
In addition to the twenty play
ers in Mr. Greet's English com
pany, more than forty Stanford
students will take part in the
presentation of "Hamlet," to be
given in Assembly Hall Saturday
afternoon and evening, the 19th of
November. These have been se
lected and are now being drilled
for their parts by Mr. Bassett.
Many of them will be merely
soldiers, sailors, gentlemen and
ladies of the court, but about a
dozen will have speaking parts,
some of them of importance.
The leading part to be taken by
a Stanford man has been assigned
to Instructor J. K. Bonnell, '03, of
the English department. While
an undergraduate Bonnell was
very prominent in dramatics, being
an early member of Sword and
Sandals. As the messenger in
"Antigone" he showed his ability
in a serious part, while as the
Grocer's Wife in"The Knight of
the Burning Pestle" he contributed
toward the success of that comedy.
He also took part in a number of
class farces. He will therefore go
into "Hamlet" with more than the
usual experience of an undergrad
uate.
Others who will have leading
speaking parte are 1). 1). Sales, '06,
who took the leading part in the
Sophomore play, "David Garrick,"
last year; E. V. Henley, '06, who
took the part of the dwarf in"The
Knight of the Burning Pestle"; and
Miss Alice Hayes, '06, who had the
leading woman's part in the Junior
Farce last year. In addition to
these the following will have minor
speaking parts: M. H. Sprague,'os,
E. H. Duval, '05, O. H. Clarke, '05,
P. C. Edwards, '06, H. I. Cruzan,
'06, J. E. Stewart, '07, .T. M. Ward,
'07, A. Peterson, '07.
Those who will appear on the
stage as guards, soldiers, sailors,
gentlemen and ladies are, so far as
selected, the following: I. C. Acker
man, '06, A. Ames, '06, L. P. Bans
bach, '05, R. G. Barnett, '05, W. L.
Blair. '05, K. C. Braddock, '08, N.
P. Bryan, '07, D. 11. Clift, '07, W.
H. Dole, '05, F. L. Everson, '07,
L. M. Edwards,'o7, C. L. Geer, '07,
A. M. Irwin, '07, S. G. Jewett, '06,
R. A. Kocher, '08, R. S. Lacey, '07,
G. D. Lyman,'os, J. C. Macfarland,
'07, C. H. Porterfield, '08, O. C.
Spencer, '04, and Misses G. Lyman,
'07, M. Timmons, '06, and J. D.
McGilvray, '06. Others will prob
ably be needed, as the list is not
complete.
Plans are also being made by
members of the English Club to
have the boxes of the Elizabethan
stage filled, as was done in " The
Knight of the Burning Pestle,"
with spectators dressed as they
would have been in Shakspere's
time. The large part to be taken
by Stanford people in the coming
production gives it a local interest
that will contribute toward its suc
cess.
