To know its real value
You must come in and see.
You must not, get the idea that be
cause our examination is free it is
worthless or that it is hurriedly or care
lessly made. Such is not the case. We
give a thorough, careful, scientific ex
amination, and tell you whether glasses
will he a benefit iu your case or not. If
you need glasses, of course we'll be glad
to have you get them of uh, but you are
free to do just as you please about it.
We believe, however, that after we
have examined your eyes you will be
convinced tbat we understand our busi
ness, and that our prices will be so satis
factory that if you need glasses you'll
decide to set. them here. That's how we
can afford to make an examination free.
Remember, we use no drugs in our work
—you lose no time from work or busi
ness—you run no risk, as we positively
guarantee satisfaction in every case.
