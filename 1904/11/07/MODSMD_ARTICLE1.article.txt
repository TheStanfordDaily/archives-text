# VARSITY WINS EASILY.
## Utah Agricultural College Team Defeated in the Last Preliminary Game. 
### 
The football team from the Utah
Agricultural College was defeated
by the Varsity on the oval Satur
day afternoon by the score of 57 to
0. Although the score was much
greater in yesterday's game, the
playing of the Cardinal team was
not the equal of its work in the Or
egon contest the week before, and
the apparent lack of team work
shown by the Stanford eleven was
a keen disappointment to its sup
porters. The individual work of the
members of the team was, on the
average, good, although the line
men played much too high to make
their efforts as effective as was poss
ible against their heavy opponents.
The Utah team was so thoroughly
overmatched that the game was
comparatively uninteresting from
the spectator's standpoint. Occa
sionally, however, its dullness was
relieved by a brilliant run made
by some member of the Stanford
back-field. By running 85 yards
to a touch-down on a quarter-back
run Stott made the most sensational
play of the game. Another spec
tacular run was the 40-yard dash
to a touch-down made by Chalmers
after receiving a Utah punt. Bren
nan made at least five bucks out
side of tackle which gained an av
erage of 25 yards each for the Car
dinal team. The other backs did
not make such long gains, but it
was very seldom that the referee
declared the ball down for the third
time. The Varsity punted fre
quently, but always on the first
down, and not through any fear of
losing the ball. Utah made her
downs twice during the entire game,
and this result was due in each
case to a five-yard penalty inflicted
on the Stanford team for off-side
playing. •
In weight and size the Utah team
was the most formidable eleven
seen on the Stanford gridiron this
season, but in knowledge of football
the eleven was but slightly superior
to the Goat Island team which mot
the Varsity in the second prelimi
nary game this year. Madsen, cap
tain arid left tackle of the team,
was its best offensive player, and
he made several short gains through
the Stanford line. Roberts, at left
end, played a notable defensive
game. By sheer weight, the heavy
Utah line men were now and then
able to stop the fierce rushes of the
Cardinal backs, but ordinarily,
they were too slow to be effective.
The Utah men were completely puz
zled by the formations used by the
Cardinal team, and they were un
able to effectively stop them.
The play which produced the
longest and most consistent gains
for Stanford was a dash outside of
tackle, and by its use the opposing
tackles were stormed for repeated
gains by the Cardinal backs. Mass
and tandem plays were used exten
sively, and the line men were given
a chance to carry the ball in these
formations.
Ten touch-downs were made and
seven goals were kicked, Sprott,
Smith and Dole missing one each.
Weller, Chalmers and Brennan

made two touch-downs each, while
Dole, Thompson, Stott and Bogle
each crossed the Utah goal-line.

Utah line men were now and then
able to stop the fierce rushes of the
Cardinal backs, but ordinarily,
they were too slow to be effective.
The Utah men were completely puz
zled by the formations used by the
Cardinal team, and they were un
able to effectively stop them.
The play which produced the
longest and most consistent gains
for Stanford was a dash outside of
tackle, and by its use the opposing
tackles were stormed for repeated
gains by the Cardinal backs. Mass
and tandem plays were used exten
sively, and the line men were given
a chance to carry the ball in these
formations.
Ten touch-downs were made and
seven goals were kicked, Sprott,
Smith and Dole missing one each.
Weller, Chalmers and Brennan

made two touch-downs each, while
Dole, Thompson, Stott and Bogle
each crossed the Utah goal-line.
The line-up was as follows:
