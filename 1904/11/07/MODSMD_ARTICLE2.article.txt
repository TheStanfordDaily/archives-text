## 
### 
A communication was received
by Treasurer Barrett this morning
from the manager of the football
team of Western Maryland College,
endeavoring to schedule a game
here or in San Francisco, to be
played during the Christmas holi
days. The letter stated that Mary
land had one of the best teams in
her history, although the average
weight was only 170 pounds. She
has suffered but one defeat this
season and is in the class of George
town University, Annapolis, John
Hopkins and the Carlisle Indians.
Owing to the fact that there is one
post-season game already scheduled
it will be impossible for Stanford to
arrange for another.
