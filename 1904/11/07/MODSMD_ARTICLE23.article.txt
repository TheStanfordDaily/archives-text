ments for the affair have been care
fully worked out, and the directors
have made arrangements with the
game officials to keep the gathering
informed as to the outcome of the
game which will be in progress at
Berkeley. The president of the
Stanford Association is Evans Hol

track-work while in college, and
who aided materially in bringing
