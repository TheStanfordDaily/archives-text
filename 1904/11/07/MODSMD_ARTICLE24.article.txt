## 
### 
In the last preliminary game of
the Reason the California varsity
defeated the Nevada eleven last
Saturday hy the score of 16 to 0.
Friezell, of Nevada, played excep
tionally good ball, making a spec
tacular end run of sixty yards, but
the other members of the team gave
him little support. The California
men were in fine form, playing a
fast, snappy game, and showing no
signs of staleness.
