# California May Play Wisconsin.
## 
### 
It is possible that the University
of California may take up the
challenge of the University of Wis
consin for a post-season game.
The California managers are re
ported to favor such a contest, and
it is possible that a Christmas
game will be played in San Fran
cisco. The Wisconsin request for
a game with Stanford was declined
because it was deemed inadvisable
to keep the men away from their
college work longer.
