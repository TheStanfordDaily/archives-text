## Dr. Gardner Speaks in Memorial Church on Our Idea of Christ. 
### 
The Rev. D. Charles Gardner
spoke in Memorial Church Sunday.
The subject of his sermon was
"What think ye of Christ?" Dr.
Gardner said in part: "Christian
ity is often misinterpreted and
misunderstood. It is so bound up
with dogma and doctrine, and creed
and ceremonial, that men and
women do not recognize its real
simplicity and beauty. Christianity
in its simplicity is faith in Jesuß
Christ. It is a personal relation,
the conscious deliberate friendship
and loyalty of men to one whom
they call Brother, Savior, Master,
Friend. There are two great hin
drances to this elementary idea of
Christianity. First, the churches
unconsciously place, between man
and his Savior, doctrine and dis
cipline, priests and sacraments.
On the other hand the gracious
intimacy which may exist between
the Christian and Christ is often
sadly misinterpreted by the mod
ern methods of some Christian
churches. God forbid that I should
say one word of unfair criticism
against that large body of earnest
minded Christians whose habit it
is to speak of their religious ex
perience in public. But I must say
very frankly that the spiritual
experiences of the religious life
should not be lightly exposed. For
two reasons: First, such exposure
tends to unreality, to mechanical
repetition of phrases, and often to
irreverence. And second, to be
pledged to get up in meeting and
tell of the most intimate, almost
unbearable longings of the soul
produces a superficial sensational
type of religion which cannot be
healthy.
"Religion at its best is not un
duly subjective. To 'find peace,'
to feel 'saved,' may be elements in
the Christian life to be prayed for
and welcomed. But they are not
the true test of reality in religion.
The true test of loyalty to Christ is
not feeling but service. All these
elements —doctrine, discipline, cere
monial, and sacraments —represent
the rich variety of expression in
Christianity, and the varying
genius of Christian peoples. But
Christ's religion is something much
simpler. It is the service of God
in the fellowship of Christ.
"The questions which must force
themselves upon every man who
faces the thought of Christ are
these: (1) What is my relation to
God, whom Christ tells me is my
Father? (2) What is my attitude
towards my fellowmen, whom
Christ tells me are my brethren?
(•3) What is my ideal of life, —un-
selfish and spiritual, like that of
Christ, or selfish and self-willed?
(4) What is my hope as I face the
fact of death? Christ points up
ward to Heaven. Which way am
I walking?"
