Yis for You;
Right here let us say,
That we might do you good
In a personal way.
You rend in our "ads" of what we
have done for others, yet you doubt
whether we can <rive the same satisfac
tory results in your case. If you were
really sure you would lie only too
to come. But you have been told so
often that your eyes were "peculiar" or
"awfully bad" or "so different from any
one else's" that you may think nothing
can be done.
No matter how "peculiar" your eye
defect is, come and let us see if we can't
help you. These "ads" won't help you
—it's only in a personal way we can do
you any good. We might be able to
give you such vision and comfort as you
never even hoped to enjoy. Others say
we have done it for them, why not for
you? Anyway it won't cost you any
thing to find out, as our examination is
free and we guarantee entire satisfaction.
EXAMINATION FREE.
