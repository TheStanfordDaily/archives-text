# FINAL FOOTBALL RALLY.
## Annual Celebration to Be Held in Assembly Hall Thursday Night. 
### 
The final football rally of the
season will be held to-morrow night
in Assembly Hall at 7:30. The
annual celebration promises to be
one of the best meetings that has
taken place for several years. All
the songs and yells that are to be
used at the intercollegiate game
Saturday will be used during this
final opportunity for rooters' prac
tice. The speakers of the evening
will be chiefly from the faculty.
Dr. Jordan will give his usual
address to the team. Other faculty
members who will speak are Dr.
Frank Angel 1, chairman of the
athletic committee, Prof. C. R.
Lewers and Prof. E. D. Adams.
Coach Lanagan and Captain
Clark have been asked to speak.
" Dad " Moulton has also consented
to be present and address the rally.
The members of the team will not
be called upon for speeches. A
feature of the rally will be the
exhibition of the large baggage
check, two feet square, which is to
be carried by R. J. McFadden, '05,
in the rooting section at the game
Saturday. The check is modeled
after the small brass watch-fobs,
and has a large Varsity "S" on
one side, with a place reserved be
low it for the score. On the other
side the words, " Here's to your vic
tory, Stanford," are engraved.
At the close of the meeting in
Assembly Hall the band, which
will be present in uniform, will
head the crowd in a march around
the quad. Red fire will be burned
during the short celebration on the
quad, after which the crowd will
inarch to the baseball field, where
a huge bonfire will be lighted.
A " hoodoo" effigy is being prepared
for the fire. The serpentine will be
danced around the fire, and cheers
for each member of the football
team will be included in the yell
ing. Before the crowd disperses it
will assemble about the blazing
embers, hats will be taken off, and
" Hail, Stanford, Hail," will be
sung as the fire dies down.
In dancing the serpentine Thurs
day night a new plan of organiza
tion wiil be followed. The par
ticipants in the rally are to meet
at Encina Hall, where they will
form groups of four before march
ing to the Assembly Hall. When
the rally there is over the rooters
will form in line in the same
groups for the march about the
qua!. This arrangement is ex
pected to avoid any delay and con
fusion Thursday night.
