In another column is printed a
request that the women of the Uni
versity appear in their section of
the bleachers next Saturday with
cardinal pennants. The suggestion
is an excellent one. If it be car
ried out with uniformity it will re
sult in a striking display. But to
get the best effect it is essential that
allof the women have the pennants.
We wish to encourage the scheme,
and ask every woman in the Uni
versity to make it a point to carry
a cardinal pennant to the bleachers.
There is another thing that was
suggested at the song practice last
evening, and in support of which
we wish to say a few words. A
yell leader, like any other man
chosen to a position ofâ€¢ leadership,
is to be regarded as the one to give
directions. Even though the sug
gestion of the yell leader may
sometimes be not so good as that of
some other individual on the i
bleachers, it is a safe rule that the
yell leader knows what is best, and
at any rate, his directions must be
followed. If any individual has
a suggestion to offer during the
rooting that suggestion can be;
quietly conveyed to the yell
leader, and then if it is not
put into use, it certainly should not
be given by a small part of the
rooters. It was just such perform
ances as this that marred the root
ing at the Freshman game, and it
is clearly evident that such prac
tices, if continued in Saturday's
game, will result in the poorest ex
hibition of rooting we have had for
some time. It was not so long
ago that a member of the class
of 1903 said that "'All together
lustily' is pretty good Stanford
doctrine." and we cannot too
Strongly urge the necessity of ap
plying that doctrine at the present
time. It is the duty of every man j
in the University to put hie
shoulder to the rooting wheel and |

work in unison with his fellow
Stanford men. The fault lies not
with the yell leaders, hut with
those who are supposed to follow
directions and do not. It is to he
hoped that the Varsity game in
this respect will he no repetition of
the Freshman contest.
