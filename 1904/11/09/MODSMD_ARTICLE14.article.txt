# FOOTBALL PLAY.
## "Sweet Clover" at the California the Night of the Game. 
### 
" Sweet Clover," by Pauline
Phelps and Marion Short, with
Gertrude Bondhilland Otis Thayer
in the leading roles, is the attrac
tion booked, at the California, by
Treasurer Barrett for the annual
football celebration.
As a football show much is left
to be desired, for the company, play
ing as it does a more or less serious
comedy-drama of the "Old Home
stead" type, has no desire to turn
the performance into a burlesque,
and this being the case the commit
tee in charge has found it impossi
ble to make any important changes
in the production.
The actors are much better than
the play. Gertrude Bondhill as
" Lois" is charming, and Otis
Thayer plays an acceptable old
man. Probably the two characters
most interesting, in the light of an
after-the-game celebration, are Sun
nie Andrews and Jack Hamilton, a
young college man who blossoms
into a full-Hedged physician.
As it is impossible to turn a
show of this nature into a football
play, the committee will not alter
the lines, but will attempt to over
come the deficiency to an extent
by introducing some specialties be
tween acts. Several comedians
front tire Orpheutn have been en
gaged for this purpose, and the
University Glee and Mandolin
Clubs will also appear. The lead
ing specialty of the evening will be
the first rendition of Miss Alice
Kimball's new Stanford song, "The
Youngest and Best," by the Glee
Club.
