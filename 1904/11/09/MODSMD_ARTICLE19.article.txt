Editor Daily Palo Alto:
There is a feeling among the
women of the University that they
should be allowed to show in some
way their loyalty to Stanford at
the game next Saturday. The re
quest has come that some insignia
be worn or carried in order to make
the Stanford section appear most
advantageously. To this end then
it would be well to have uniform
action, and 1 suggest that each
woman of the student body carry
a small cardinal "S" pennant.
