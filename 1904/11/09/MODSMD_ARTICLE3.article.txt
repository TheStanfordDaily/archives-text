# GOOD SPEECHES AT ASSEMBLY
## Dr. Jordan Counsels Men Regarding Their Conduct at Berkeley Saturday. 
### 
The University Assembly this
morning was the most interesting
of those that have been held this
semester. The general topic was
athletics, and because of its timeli
ness the words of all the speakers
were listened to with attention.
Dr. Jordan presided, and the others
who spoke were Professor \V. F.
Durand of the Mechanical Engi
neering department, S. W. Cotton,
'98, and J. F. English, '01. The
Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave
some music.
Dr. Jordan, in a brief opening
address, gave some words of ad
vice regarding the conduct of Stan
ford men at next Saturday's inter
collegiate game. "Beginning this
week," he Baid, "we inaugurate the
custom of having the big football
games on the campus. We want
to remember that when we are on
the Californians' campus we are in
a sense their guests. Therefore I
do not want any student of Stan
ford University to take away any
property whatever from the Ber
keley campus. If he does, we will
do our best to give him an honor
able dismissal from this University
so that he can finish his course in
the other college. I have seen it
stated in a newspaper that at the
last Freshman game some Stanford
students tried to make away with
the California flag. I do not be
lieve that any Stanford student
would do that. If you win the
game next Saturday I believe the
field is yours, but that is all that
is yours, and you can't take even
that away with you. It is impor
tant to set this new precedent, for
there seems to be a little bit of
waning of the Stanford spirit.
During the past ten days there
have been unmistakable evidences
of the reappearance of the Stanford
"mucker," and it is necessary that
this spirit be curbed."
Dr. Durand made a very inter
esting speech upon the place of
athletics in college life and their
influence in after life. "No apol
ogy is needed for the existence of
the system of athletics in modern
educational institutions." he said.
"As an institution it merits the care
ful consideration of students and of
the governing bodies. It has its
present stronghold because it runs
to the genius of our race. We have
inherited from our faraway ances
tors a remnant of the fierce delight
in victory and conquest. This may
be eliminated by the process of
natural evolution, but I believe
that day is far distant. It exists
because it answers a demand of our
blood.
"The primary function of an
educational institution is to develop
high scholarship. But every
graduate should be more than a
scholar: he should be a man in the
fullest meaning of that term. If
he lived a life of seclusion, if he
could look forth upon the problems
of life without touching them, it is
possible that scholarship might
limit the usefulness of the educa
tional institution. But so long as
there are problems of great politi
cal, social, and economic impor
tance, so long must the leaders of
human activity he more than mere
scholars. They must meet sym
pathetically the very live activities
which they will have to face in ac
tive life. A man must strive for
more than he can get from text
books alone. 1 helieve that physi
cal activities aid greatly in round
ing out a student for the higher
plane of man. Hut I believe that
as college athletics are now, they
are far from measuring up the full
amount of these possibilities. At
present our college athletics do not
realize to the full the potentialities
that are in them."
Dr. Durand made a rough com
parison of athletics at Stanford
and Cornell, with which he was
connected for thirteen years. "Two
or three things," he said, "have im
pressed me in the short time I have
been here. One very vital founda
tion of athletics is unity of spiritâ€”
support of men loyally whether in
victory or in defeat. In this insti
tution you have perhaps more
unified spirit than exists at Cor
nell. The reasons for this are that
you are less numerous and your
interests less diversified. Again, in
the matter of organized cheering:
In the past thirteen years we have
seen the entire conception and de
velopment of this peculiar modern
system of encouragement of a team.
At Stanford we are well abreast of
anything to be found in the East.
In this connection I have noticed
with great pleasure the high degree
of generosity shown toward op
ponents. It should be our ideal to
develop in every way this spirit.
We should see to it that the very
name of Stanford is synonymous
with this ideal. A reputation for
gentlemanliness and courtesy is
better than a score of victories."
S. W. Cotton, '98, captain of the
28-0 Varsity team in 1897, was the
next speaker. He said, in part:
"Coming back after an absence of
some years, I find an enormous im
provement in the way you now
handle athletics. In 1894 the
method was very primitive indeed.
Then we had to depend upon East
ern coaches, and Eastern systems,
entirely. We had inherited from
the pioneers a good share of the
Stanford spirit, but no system. The
material we had to work with was
very crude. The first good move we
made was in bringing out Walter
Camp. 'Camp has always stood for
system, and pure, clean athletics,
and bis ideals have had more to do
with the forming of Stanford ideals
than most people realize. Stan
ford is justly proud of her clean
record in this regard. The adop
tion of the graduate-coach plan has
naturally resulted in a permanent
system of coaching. The Eastern
coaches who came here were not in
touch with Stanford ideals, and
there was a revolution of system
with each new coach. The team
that is going to beat California next
Saturday, coached by Lanagan, is
a beautiful playing machine. I
congratulate you on having the
right trainer and the right coach."
J. F. English, '01, president of
the Stanford Club of San Francisco,
was the last speaker, discussing
Stanford football from the view
point of a man out in the world.
He said: "When at Stanford I
doubted greatly the wisdom of the
system of the graduate coaches and

campus games. But now I am
firmly convinced that the system
lias proved an unqualified success.
It teaches lessons of concentration,
of self-control, and it is going to
lead to success in the life of the
world. It is just this lesson that
the football men and the student
body are learning under the present
system. Under the old system,
training rules were drawn up form
ally, and much discussed and
written about. But they were
broken. Training now is a matter
of course. Gradually all evidence
of professionalism is disappearing
from the University. Campus
games may not make so much
money, but the money comes from
genuine lovers of the game, and not
from sporting men. There is less
betting among the students on the
results of the games. The students
of both universities might well cel
ebrate the truth that with graduate
coaches and campus games has
come a better spirit in their rela
tions."

more than he can get from text
books alone. 1 helieve that physi
cal activities aid greatly in round
ing out a student for the higher
plane of man. Hut I believe that
as college athletics are now, they
are far from measuring up the full
amount of these possibilities. At
present our college athletics do not
realize to the full the potentialities
that are in them."
Dr. Durand made a rough com
parison of athletics at Stanford
and Cornell, with which he was
connected for thirteen years. "Two
or three things," he said, "have im
pressed me in the short time I have
been here. One very vital founda
tion of athletics is unity of spiritâ€”
support of men loyally whether in
victory or in defeat. In this insti
tution you have perhaps more
unified spirit than exists at Cor
nell. The reasons for this are that
you are less numerous and your
interests less diversified. Again, in
the matter of organized cheering:
In the past thirteen years we have
seen the entire conception and de
velopment of this peculiar modern
system of encouragement of a team.
At Stanford we are well abreast of
anything to be found in the East.
In this connection I have noticed
with great pleasure the high degree
of generosity shown toward op
ponents. It should be our ideal to
develop in every way this spirit.
We should see to it that the very
name of Stanford is synonymous
with this ideal. A reputation for
gentlemanliness and courtesy is
better than a score of victories."
S. W. Cotton, '98, captain of the
28-0 Varsity team in 1897, was the
next speaker. He said, in part:
"Coming back after an absence of
some years, I find an enormous im
provement in the way you now
handle athletics. In 1894 the
method was very primitive indeed.
Then we had to depend upon East
ern coaches, and Eastern systems,
entirely. We had inherited from
the pioneers a good share of the
Stanford spirit, but no system. The
material we had to work with was
very crude. The first good move we
made was in bringing out Walter
Camp. 'Camp has always stood for
system, and pure, clean athletics,
and bis ideals have had more to do
with the forming of Stanford ideals
than most people realize. Stan
ford is justly proud of her clean
record in this regard. The adop
tion of the graduate-coach plan has
naturally resulted in a permanent
system of coaching. The Eastern
coaches who came here were not in
touch with Stanford ideals, and
there was a revolution of system
with each new coach. The team
that is going to beat California next
Saturday, coached by Lanagan, is
a beautiful playing machine. I
congratulate you on having the
right trainer and the right coach."
J. F. English, '01, president of
the Stanford Club of San Francisco,
was the last speaker, discussing
Stanford football from the view
point of a man out in the world.
He said: "When at Stanford I
doubted greatly the wisdom of the
system of the graduate coaches and

campus games. But now I am
firmly convinced that the system
lias proved an unqualified success.
It teaches lessons of concentration,
of self-control, and it is going to
lead to success in the life of the
world. It is just this lesson that
the football men and the student
body are learning under the present
system. Under the old system,
training rules were drawn up form
ally, and much discussed and
written about. But they were
broken. Training now is a matter
of course. Gradually all evidence
of professionalism is disappearing
from the University. Campus
games may not make so much
money, but the money comes from
genuine lovers of the game, and not
from sporting men. There is less
betting among the students on the
results of the games. The students
of both universities might well cel
ebrate the truth that with graduate
coaches and campus games has
come a better spirit in their rela
tions."
The University Assembly this
morning was the most interesting
of those that have been held this
semester. The general topic was
athletics, and because of its timeli
ness the words of all the speakers
were listened to with attention.
Dr. Jordan presided, and the others
who spoke were Professor \V. F.
Durand of the Mechanical Engi
neering department, S. W. Cotton,
'98, and J. F. English, '01. The
Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave
some music.
Dr. Jordan, in a brief opening
address, gave some words of ad
vice regarding the conduct of Stan
ford men at next Saturday's inter
collegiate game. "Beginning this
week," he Baid, "we inaugurate the
custom of having the big football
games on the campus. We want
to remember that when we are on
the Californians' campus we are in
a sense their guests. Therefore I
do not want any student of Stan
ford University to take away any
property whatever from the Ber
keley campus. If he does, we will
do our best to give him an honor
able dismissal from this University
so that he can finish his course in
the other college. I have seen it
stated in a newspaper that at the
last Freshman game some Stanford
students tried to make away with
the California flag. I do not be
lieve that any Stanford student
would do that. If you win the
game next Saturday I believe the
field is yours, but that is all that
is yours, and you can't take even
that away with you. It is impor
tant to set this new precedent, for
there seems to be a little bit of
waning of the Stanford spirit.
During the past ten days there
have been unmistakable evidences
of the reappearance of the Stanford
"mucker," and it is necessary that
this spirit be curbed."
Dr. Durand made a very inter
esting speech upon the place of
athletics in college life and their
influence in after life. "No apol
ogy is needed for the existence of
the system of athletics in modern
educational institutions." he said.
"As an institution it merits the care
ful consideration of students and of
the governing bodies. It has its
present stronghold because it runs
to the genius of our race. We have
inherited from our faraway ances
tors a remnant of the fierce delight
in victory and conquest. This may
be eliminated by the process of
natural evolution, but I believe
that day is far distant. It exists
because it answers a demand of our
blood.
"The primary function of an
educational institution is to develop
high scholarship. But every
graduate should be more than a
scholar: he should be a man in the
fullest meaning of that term. If
he lived a life of seclusion, if he
could look forth upon the problems
of life without touching them, it is
possible that scholarship might
limit the usefulness of the educa
tional institution. But so long as
there are problems of great politi
cal, social, and economic impor
tance, so long must the leaders of
human activity he more than mere
scholars. They must meet sym
pathetically the very live activities
which they will have to face in ac
tive life. A man must strive for
more than he can get from text
books alone. 1 helieve that physi
cal activities aid greatly in round
ing out a student for the higher
plane of man. Hut I believe that
