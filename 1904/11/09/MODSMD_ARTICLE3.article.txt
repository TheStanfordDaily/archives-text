# GOOD SPEECHES AT ASSEMBLY
## Dr. Jordan Counsels Men Regarding Their Conduct at Berkeley Saturday. 
### 
The University Assembly this
morning was the most interesting
of those that have been held this
semester. The general topic was
athletics, and because of its timeli
ness the words of all the speakers
were listened to with attention.
Dr. Jordan presided, and the others
who spoke were Professor \V. F.
Durand of the Mechanical Engi
neering department, S. W. Cotton,
'98, and J. F. English, '01. The
Glee and Mandolin Clubs gave
some music.
Dr. Jordan, in a brief opening
address, gave some words of ad
vice regarding the conduct of Stan
ford men at next Saturday's inter
collegiate game. "Beginning this
week," he Baid, "we inaugurate the
custom of having the big football
games on the campus. We want
to remember that when we are on
the Californians' campus we are in
a sense their guests. Therefore I
do not want any student of Stan
ford University to take away any
property whatever from the Ber
keley campus. If he does, we will
do our best to give him an honor
able dismissal from this University
so that he can finish his course in
the other college. I have seen it
stated in a newspaper that at the
last Freshman game some Stanford
students tried to make away with
the California flag. I do not be
lieve that any Stanford student
would do that. If you win the
game next Saturday I believe the
field is yours, but that is all that
is yours, and you can't take even
that away with you. It is impor
tant to set this new precedent, for
there seems to be a little bit of
waning of the Stanford spirit.
During the past ten days there
have been unmistakable evidences
of the reappearance of the Stanford
"mucker," and it is necessary that
this spirit be curbed."
Dr. Durand made a very inter
esting speech upon the place of
athletics in college life and their
influence in after life. "No apol
ogy is needed for the existence of
the system of athletics in modern
educational institutions." he said.
"As an institution it merits the care
ful consideration of students and of
the governing bodies. It has its
present stronghold because it runs
to the genius of our race. We have
inherited from our faraway ances
tors a remnant of the fierce delight
in victory and conquest. This may
be eliminated by the process of
natural evolution, but I believe
that day is far distant. It exists
because it answers a demand of our
blood.
"The primary function of an
educational institution is to develop
high scholarship. But every
graduate should be more than a
scholar: he should be a man in the
fullest meaning of that term. If
he lived a life of seclusion, if he
could look forth upon the problems
of life without touching them, it is
possible that scholarship might
limit the usefulness of the educa
tional institution. But so long as
