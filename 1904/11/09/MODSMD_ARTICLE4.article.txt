# SOUTHERN TRIP ABANDONED
## Musical Clubs Will Not Make Extended Tour This Year. 
### 
At a meeting of the combined
Musical Clubs, held Monday eve
ning in room 62, Norman E. Dole,
'04, was elected president and J. li.
Rosenfeld, '06, secretary-treasurer.
The question of the advisability of
taking a trip this year was taken
up, and discussed at length. To
the older men of the club the situa
tion seemed similar to that which
confronted them in 1900, when, be
cause of the loss of so many old
men, and the lack of specialty men,
it was deemed advisable to postpone
the trip a year. This year the new
men are largely in the majority on
both clubs, and specialty men are
lacking up to the present time.
Permission for a trip having been
granted by the Executive Commit
tee, it lay with the club to decide
which would he for the best inter
ests of the club and the University:
to take the southern trip this year,
or to take a number of short trips
in the immediate, vicinity in order
to make up the deficit incurred last
year, and place the clubs upon a
sound basis for next year. It was
felt that the latter would be the
wiser course, in view of the circum
stances, and in consideration of the
fact that almost every man will be
on the clubs next year, and will be
able to make the southern trip at
that time. The vote was unani
mous in favor of postponing the
southern trip.
