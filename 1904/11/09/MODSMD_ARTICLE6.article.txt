# Fire on Alvarado Row.
## 
### 
The new fire apparatus was used
for the first time last night, and
the firemen were successful in sub
duing a blaze which threatened
several houses in Alvarado row.
Early in the evening a small blaze
started in the wood-house back of
the residence of Prof. A. C. Whitaker
at 8 Alvarado row. The blaze was
extinguished, but later in the even
ing revived, and as a result the
building was destroyed. The fire
department was a little slow in get
ting out, and the whistle did not
blow until the fire was well under
way. However, the work of the de
partment was prompt enough to
keep the blaze from spreading.
