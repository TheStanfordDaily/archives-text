# SECRET PRACTICE
## Last Heavy Scrimmage Work Held on Oval This Evening. 
### 
For the last time this season, the
Varsity lined up against the second
team for heavy scrimmage work
this evening. Thirty minutes of
hard play Tuesday and the same
amount to-night has completed the
conditioning of the Varsity, and
the remainder of the week will be
devoted to signal practice.
The playing of the first team in
the last two practice matches was
extremely heavy, but the players
escaped without sustaining any in
juries, and each man will enter Sa
turday's game in the best of physi
cal trim.
The trip to King's Mountain
which the team took Sunday
proved of great benefit to the men,
who showed signs of being over
trained. The change of diet and
the diversion of the outing have re
stured them to their normal condi
tion, and the trainer has no fear of
a recurrence of the trouble. Last
year the Varsity was taken for a
drive the day before the game, and
it is probable that the same plan
will be followed this season.
To-morrow night an open prac
tice will be held at the usual hour.
It is expected that the bleachers
will be filled, as this will be the
last chance for the University pub
lic to see the team in action before
it faces California Saturday.
If the team is not taken out for
a drive Friday morning a secret
practice will be held, but it is prob
able that the players will be absent
from the campus all day.
