# Successful Song Practice.
## 
### 
The song practice held last night
in Assembly Hall was marked by
a return of the spirit of enthusiasm
that is necessary for successful
rooting. The songs and yells
were rendered with vim and
force, the rooters responding
enthusiastically to the lenders. He
fore the practice closed Yell-leader
Thorpe gave a short talk to the
rooters, in which he emphasized the
necessity of unity in.cheering. He
said that this could he secured only
by careful attention to the yell
leaders, every man getting into
every yell. He said that at the
Freshman game a great deal of
confusion was caused by persons on
the bleachers insisting on certain
yells during the game. At the inter
collegiate game there should be
less individual cheering between
the yells, and the rooters should be
gin and end the yells together.
