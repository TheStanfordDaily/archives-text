is for Zero,
Or nothing, or naught;
What glasses are worth
That don't fit as they ought.
The question of values in glasses de
pends entirely upon the lenses.
The frame or mounting is always an
item in the price, but so long as it holds
the lenses in proper position before the
eyes, it may be of any kind or material
without affecting the real value of your
glasses as an aid to vision.
Right glasses are worth all you pay for
them, in fact they are priceless. Still
you'll he glad to know that we charge
you no more for "satisfaction" than you
would pay elsewhere and "take the
chances." We believe you'll remember
the quality long after the price is for
gotten.
Wrong glasses are worthless; in fact,
they are worse than none, for they may,
and often do, cause more strain than
was caused by the defect they were in
tended to correct.
If you need glasses, or different
glasses, why not get them here and have
them right—just right?
