# PROGRAM FOR ROOTERS.
## Stanford Men Will Leave Campus at 8:30.â€”Movements of the Day Outlined. 
### 
The arrangement of trains and
line of march for the Stanford root
ers was completed to-day by M. H.
Thorpe, '05, who went to San Fran
cisco for that purpose. The rooters
are to take one of the 8:30 trains,
either at Palo Alto or on the
campus. The first train leaves Palo
Alto and stops at way stations to
take on passengers. The second
leaves the campus, also at 8:30,
and goes directly to San Francisco.
The band will take this second
train.
After reaching San Francisco the
Stanford supporters will meet at the
corner of Ellis and Market streets
at ten o'clock. From there they will
march in a body, headed by the
band, down Market street as far as
Kearny, and thence up Post street
to the St. Francis Hoiel, where the
Stanford headquarters will be lo
cated.
Lunch will be eaten between
eleven and twelve o'clock, in time
to take the twelve o'clock boats
across the bay. It is imperative
that the Stanford rooters take the
ferry-boats at this hour in order to
avoid the crush that will come
later. It is estimated that almost
ten thousand San Francisco resi
dents will attend the game, and
the majority of these will cross the
bay on the 12:30 and 12:40 boats.
A band concert will be given on
the ferry, and the rooters will
indulge in singing and yell
ing to limber up for the
greater efforts that will follow. In
order to reach the Ferry building
in plenty of time, the band and
rooters will line up in front of the
Hotel St. Francis at 11:30, march
down to Market street, and take the
cars for the 12 o'clock boat. The
yell leaders have planned some
original innovations which prom
ises to be very effective. Just what
these are cannot be given out as
yet, but they will be told to the
rooters on Saturday morning.
At the conclusion of the game,
which is called at 2:30, the time of
meeting at the ferry building in
San Francisco will be announced.
This will probably be between 5:30
and 6:00. From the ferry the
crowd will march up Market street
in a body, and more demonstra
tions will probably be carried
out at that time. In the evening
the rooters who attend the football
show at the California Theatre
should be in their seats by eight
o'clock.
