Special notice should he taken
of the announcement that the Stan
ford Club of San Francisco will
give a smoker in the city to-morrow
night. Many undergraduates will
doubtless leave the campus to
morrow afternoon, and all those
who do will find at the smoker a
rare opportunity to touch elbows
with many of Stanford's prominent
graduates. Just at this date there
are numbers of alumni in San
Francisco for the purpose of wit
nessing. the game, and there will
probably be a larger attendance of
former Stanford men present to
morrow night than there has been
at any previous social affair given
by the club.
