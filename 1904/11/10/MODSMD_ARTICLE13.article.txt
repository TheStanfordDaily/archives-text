The statistics given out by the
Faculty Committee on Scholarship
and printed in another column
show a gradual increase during the
past three years in the number of
students who are deficient in their
college work. It is not to be con
cluded from these figures that stu
dents are becoming less diligent
from year to year, or that the
faculty committee is becoming
more severe in the application of
the principles which guide its
action in matters of scholarship.
The causes of the increase are to be
found rather in the increase in the
total enrollment of the University.
But the growth of deficiencies has
been proportionally greater than
the increase in registration. The,
explanation for that fact, however,
may be found in a gradually in
creasing tendency of certain pro
fessors to require a better grade of
work in several of the general cul
ture courses. The number of stu
dents reported in these courses this!
semester was far greater than ever'
before.
