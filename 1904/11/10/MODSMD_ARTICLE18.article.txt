# PREPARATIONS FOR "HAMLET."
## Supper to Be Served by Y.W.C.A. the Evening of the Play. 
### 
On account of' the large number
of people from San Jose and other
outside towns who are planning to
attend the production of "Hamlet"
on Saturday, November 19th, a
supper will be terved during the
intermission by the Young Wom
en's Christian Association of the
University. It is the idea of those
in charge to serve a simple substan
tial meal at a moderate charge,
more for the convenience of the vis
itors than for anything else.
The special train from San Jose
will leave broad-gauge station in
that city at 2:15 Saturday after
noon. It will stop at College Park,
Santa Clara, and Mountain View,
and will come directly to the cam
pus. It will return immediately
after the evening performance.
Reserved seats for the play will
be placed on sale at the University
Bookstore on the campus, at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto,
and at the Gurtaz music store in
San Jose, at nine o'clock Tuesday
morning, instead of Monday morn
ing, as announced before. The
prices will be 75 ctnts, $1, and
$1.25. This includes admission to
both afternoon and evening per
formances.
Mr. McEntee, Mr. Greet's stage
manager, will be here Monday
afternoon to conduct a preliminary
rehearsal of the Stanford studenU
who are to assist the English play
ers, and who are now being drilled
by Mr. Basset I.
