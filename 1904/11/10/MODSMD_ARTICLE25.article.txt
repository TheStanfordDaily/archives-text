# DR. JORDAN LECTURES.
## Speaks in the Zoology Building on the Development of Classification of Fish. 
### 
Dr. Jordan began a aeries of lec
tures last night in the Zoology
building on ichthyological nomen
clature. He gave an outline of the
early names for the various kinds
of fish, showing the haphazard ways
in which Home of the species origi
nally got their names. The species
were formerly very vaguely defined,
and it was not until early in the
nineteenth century that the idea
was conceived of bounding a genus
so as to have something definite.
The beginning of scientific classifi
cation was due to the efforts of
Artidi, the so-called father of
ichthyology, whose untimely death
by drowning at the age of 28 left
the work merely started, to be car
ried on by his friend and colleague,
Linnaeus. About this time also
'Briseon was beginning the classifi
cation of birds.
Linnaeus was in some ways
greater than Artidi and Brisson, for
he had a system of naming the
families and species in a way so
that they will endure as long as the
science of ichthyology. He de
veloped the system first started by
Artidi and introduced the binomial
nomenclature, which gives at once
the genus and the species. He
used the Latin name for the former
and the Greek for the latter. This
process has had a wonderfully sim
plifying effect, and enables one at a
glance to determine accurately just
the class in which any specimen
may fall. There have been innova
tions as to the regular Latin and
Greek forms, and species are some
times named after the men who
first discovered them. For ex
ample, we have the Artidii, the
Brissoni, the Smithsonianus, and
other species. Names are also
sometimes derived from localities
in which the class may be found,
as Indicus and the like. There is
some question as to how far these
special names should be introduced
into the classical nomenclature.
An attempt is made to remedy the
discrepancy by terminating the
local names with the classical end
ings.
From time to time new genera
have been proposed. There is a
constant tendency to subdivide as
the study becomes more highly
specialized. Through revisions the
old classifications have almost lost
their identity. Cuvier was the
greatest systematizer we have yet
had. He simplified the classifica
tion by abridging many of the
cumbrous names which had been
used in defining genera and species.
Many of the other names have been
mended through the efforts of
AgaÂ«siz and Strickland. The law
of priority of names has prevented
a very rapid adoption of a uni
versal system, but conditions are
slowly coming around to the point
where a general plan will be used
everywhere. Dr. Jordan said that
in the next lecture he will go more
into detail regarding the origin of
names for the individual genera
and species.
