### 
Luther I'. Burbank, the Califor
nia botanist who has won fame by
his discoveries both in the United
States and in Europe, is to be at
Stanford on Wednesday, November
15th, and will deliver a lecture be
fore the instructors and advanced

] students in the department of
Biology. The lecture will be held
| in the Entomology lecture room of
I Professor V. L. Kellogg at 4,
! and will be on the subject- of
''Heredity and Plant Breeding."
The lecture should be a matter
of great interest to those who will
J be entitled to attend it, both on
I account of the high position held
Iby Mr. Burbank among modern
workers in botany, and also be
cause of the in frequency of his lec
tures. Mr. Burbank is strongly
opposed to publicity, and it is sel
dom that he can be prevailed upon
to deliver lectures upon his work.
His chief work has been in the
development of new kinds of plants.
From an economic and horticul
tural standpoint it has been im
portant in producing kinds of fruit
readily adaptable to the demands
of growing and commerce. But
from the bionomic standpoint cer
tain phases of it have given rise to
problems that have direct bearing
upon many theories, and it is in
this respect that next Wednesday's
lecture should prove most interest
