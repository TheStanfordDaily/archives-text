# LAST PRACTICE.
## Signal Work of Varsity Football Squad Watched by Large Crowd. 
### 
Before a large crowd of interested
rooters the Varsity football equad
held its last open practice on the
gridiron to-night. Most of the men
who are on the training-table ap
peared in their new suits. For the
iirst time in the history of football
games between Stanford and Cali
fornia, the Cardinal team will ap
pear in a distinctive uniform. It is
a union suit of light brown canvas
with a broad white elastic strip
around the waist. The stockings
and jersey are a bright cardinal in
color. Spectators who are not ac
quainted with either team will
have a greater chance to dintin
euish between the two this year.
Throughout the season the football
suits have been heavily padded,
but the players will enter the con
test Saturday with the lightest pads
consistent with safety.
The practice period this evening
was devoted chiefly to instruction
in the finer points of the game.
The second team lined up again√üt
the Varsity while Dole punted out
from the goal-line to Chalmers,
who heeled the catches with re
markable regularity. The squad
was then divided into two squads,
and some time was devoted to fall
ing on the ball. The team was
lined up to receive a kick-off.
Sprott did the kicking, and the
whole eleven formed the inter
ference before the runner. Every
man got into this play, and the
members of both teams played with
snap and energy.
Coach Lanagan has not fully de
cided where he will take the eleven
to-morrow, but it will be some place
in the hills, where the men will be
away from excitement. If the team
does not leave before noon, secret
practice will be held on the oval to
morrow morning.
