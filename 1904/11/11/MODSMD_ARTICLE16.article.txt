Professor Adams of the History
department took occasion to speak
of the loyalty of the women of the
University to the team. He was
followed by President Jordan, who
said he would be quite satisfied if
the team made a score of 6 to 5.
Coach Lanagan thanked the
rooters and then paid a fine
tribute to the second team, to As
sistant Coach Hauverman and to
Trainer Moulton. Referring to
Bansbach and Clark, he said: "I
have never anywhere seen two bet
ter captains than these men. They
have set an example to the team of
the hardest kind of work. They
have never saved themselves. They
have never said a word to the men
that was not cheering."
Speaking of the chances of the
team, he said: "They'll have to
fight and you'll have to fight. You
will have to support them strongly
throughout the game. If you do,
we will win; if you don't, we will
lose. We have got to fight and to
fight hard. There will be no 30-0
score. Perhaps it will not be until
the last five minutes of the game
that the team will be able to carry
the ball over the goal-line, but it
will be carried across that line. We
need your support to the end."
Yell-Leader Thorpe announced
the appointment of J. G. Dehy, E.
Y. Pomeroy, H. H. Chandler and
G. R. Stevens as leaders of all fu
ture serpentines. The big crowd
then gathered in the inner quad
and danced the serpentine around
much red fire. From here they
marched to the baseball diamond,
headed by the band, and gathered
around the big bonfire which had
been started. The "Big C" fence

streets, and, accompanied by the
band, will march in a body to the
St. Francis Hotel. The rooters
will cross the bay on the ferries
leaving from 12:00 to 12:30.
Gates to the grounds will be
opened at 1 and the game will be
gin at 2:30. The new bleachers at
California Field have a seating ca
pacity of from 15,000 to 16,000
people.
The rooters will meet at the ferry
building directly after the game
and march up Market street to the
St. Francis Hotel. Stanford par
tisans will attend the special at
traction at the California Theatre
at 8 o'clock. It is urgent that all
the rooters be in their seats at that
hour, in order to take part in the
demonstration that will attend the
arrival of the team and precede the
opening of the play.
