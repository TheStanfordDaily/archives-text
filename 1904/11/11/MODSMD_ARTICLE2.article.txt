# ENTHUSIASTIC RALLY
## "Big C" Fence Captured from California Is Burned as a "Hoodoo" 
### 
The great annual football rally
held in Assembly Hall last night
was one of the most enthusiastic
gatherings of the kind ever held.
The men displayed a striking
amount of good spirit, and this re
flected itself in the noticeable im
provement in the yelling, which
could hardly have been improved
upon. The men ''rooted" in per
fect harmony, and the task of
leading was left strictly to the
leaders, bo that there was none of
the confusion which until the past
few days has marred the yelling
from the bleachers. There were
more than fifteen hundred persons
at the rally, for every seat was
filled, upstairs and down, and
many people stood along the sides
of the hall.
The real enthusiasm began when
the team, headed by Captain Clark,
Weller and Coach Lanagan, walked
down the side to the front to take
their seats. Everyone rose to his
feet and cheered wildly for a
couple of minutes, ending up with
a rousing yell for the team. The
rooters got another chance when
the famous California "Big C"
fence, which it was announced was
to be burned as a "hoodoo," was
carried in.
The first speaker was Prof. C. R.
Lewers, who paid strong tributes to
Dole and Itoosevelt, who will play
on the team, and to Coach Lana
gan. Lanagan, he said, had a cer
tain definite purpose, and had
come nearer to the realization of
that purpose than any other coach
Stanford had ever had, not except
ing Walter Camp. Speaking of
the prospects of the team, he said
it was going into no easy game.
We might hope for a large score,
but honest conviction would seem
