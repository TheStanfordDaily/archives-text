# Stanford Will Meet State University in Intercollegiate Football Contest on California's New Field at 2:30 To-morrow.
## 
### 
To-morrow afternoon, for the
fourteenth time, Stanford and Cali
fornia will meet in an annual foot
ball game. A particular and addi
tional interest over former games is
placed in the outcome of this con
test because it has the distinction
of being the first intercollegiate
football game to be played on the
campus of one of the two universi
ties, the thirteen precedingstruggles
having taken place in San Fran
cisco. In this respect to-morrow's
contest marks the beginning of an
important period in the history of
Western college football, and for
that reason there is an exceptional
incentive for both teams to play the
game with a snap and determina
tion that hRS had no equal in the
past. Of the preceding contests
Stanford has won five, California
ha√ü won four, and the other four
have each resulted in a tie.
The team which will face Cali
fornia to-morrow was finally se
lected by the coaches at a late hour
this afternoon. The chosen eleven
iB one of the fastest and best bal
anced teams that has ever repre
sented Stanford in an intercollegiate
football game. In compactness of
formation and swiftness of attack
it excels any previous Varsity.
Coach Lanagan has made strenu

ous effort to overcome that lack of
scoring power which has distin
guished Stanford teams in the past,
and if the last preliminary games
were a reliable criterion, he has suc
ceeded in developing a superior of
fensive team. Expert opinion
agrees that the team this year is su
perior in offensive powers to last
year's Varsity, and on the de
fense it is at least equal to that
eleven.
Nine of the members of the Cardi
nal eleven are veterans of past inter
collegiate contests, and their experi
ence ought to have a potent effect
011 the result of to-morrow's game.
The two men who will face a Cali
fornia team for the first time are
not without football experience,and
their playing this year has been
consistently good. The fact that
Hyde has two such veterans as
Thompson and Roosevelt on each
side of him will materially aid the
new center. As a rule veteran
teams suffer from over-confidence,
but the members of this year's
eleven have been so hard pressed
for their places by the second team
that they have had no opportunity
to loaf. Some of the second team
men are barely inferior to their
successful rivals, and if any of the
Varsity men are compelled to re

tire from to-morrow's game their
places can be acceptably filled by
available substitutes. For this pur
pose Lanagan will take at least
thirteen substitutes to Berkeley
with the first team.
Great stress has been laid by the
coaches on the importance of ac
quiring a knowledge of the finer
points of the game, and in this re
spect the team is decidedly superior
to most of its predecessors. Al
though some of the formations used
by Stanford will undoubtedly prove
puzzling to their opponents, they
cannot be called trick play?, and
straight football will be relied upon
to score against California to-mor
row.
A comparison of the respective
records made by Stanford and Cali
fornia during the preliminary sea
son this year does not give a satis
factory estimate of the relative
merits of the two teams. Stanford
commenced her season earlier, and
has played more games than Cali
fornia. The State University has
not been scored against this season,
while Stanford has been defeated
twice. The first defeat was sus
tained at the hands of the Olympic
Club, which team the Cardinal
decisively beat two weeks later.
The second reverse was due to one
touch-down made by the Sherman
Indian team. Both of these defeats
occurred early in the season, before
the Varsity had attained even or
dinary form, and they did not
reflect the ability of the first team
even at that stage, for both scores
were against what was practically
a second eleven. Although not
scored against, California had a
narrow escape from defeat at the
hands of the fast team from Po
mona College. Despite repeated
reports to the contrary, both teams
have played in excellent form dur
ing the last two weeks, and they
will enter Saturday's game pre
pared for a hard struggle.
