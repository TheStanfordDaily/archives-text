# Stanford Will Meet State University in Intercollegiate Football Contest on California's New Field at 2:30 To-morrow.
## 
### 
To-morrow afternoon, for the
fourteenth time, Stanford and Cali
fornia will meet in an annual foot
ball game. A particular and addi
tional interest over former games is
placed in the outcome of this con
test because it has the distinction
of being the first intercollegiate
football game to be played on the
campus of one of the two universi
ties, the thirteen precedingstruggles
having taken place in San Fran
cisco. In this respect to-morrow's
contest marks the beginning of an
important period in the history of
Western college football, and for
that reason there is an exceptional
incentive for both teams to play the
game with a snap and determina
tion that hRS had no equal in the
past. Of the preceding contests
Stanford has won five, California
haß won four, and the other four
have each resulted in a tie.
The team which will face Cali
fornia to-morrow was finally se
lected by the coaches at a late hour
this afternoon. The chosen eleven
iB one of the fastest and best bal
anced teams that has ever repre
sented Stanford in an intercollegiate
football game. In compactness of
formation and swiftness of attack
it excels any previous Varsity.
Coach Lanagan has made strenu

ous effort to overcome that lack of
scoring power which has distin
guished Stanford teams in the past,
and if the last preliminary games
were a reliable criterion, he has suc
ceeded in developing a superior of
fensive team. Expert opinion
agrees that the team this year is su
perior in offensive powers to last
year's Varsity, and on the de
fense it is at least equal to that
eleven.
Nine of the members of the Cardi
nal eleven are veterans of past inter
collegiate contests, and their experi
ence ought to have a potent effect
011 the result of to-morrow's game.
The two men who will face a Cali
fornia team for the first time are
not without football experience,and
their playing this year has been
consistently good. The fact that
Hyde has two such veterans as
Thompson and Roosevelt on each
side of him will materially aid the
new center. As a rule veteran
teams suffer from over-confidence,
but the members of this year's
eleven have been so hard pressed
for their places by the second team
that they have had no opportunity
to loaf. Some of the second team
men are barely inferior to their
successful rivals, and if any of the
Varsity men are compelled to re

tire from to-morrow's game their
places can be acceptably filled by
available substitutes. For this pur
pose Lanagan will take at least
thirteen substitutes to Berkeley
with the first team.
Great stress has been laid by the
coaches on the importance of ac
quiring a knowledge of the finer
points of the game, and in this re
spect the team is decidedly superior
to most of its predecessors. Al
though some of the formations used
by Stanford will undoubtedly prove
puzzling to their opponents, they
cannot be called trick play?, and
straight football will be relied upon
to score against California to-mor
row.
A comparison of the respective
records made by Stanford and Cali
fornia during the preliminary sea
son this year does not give a satis
factory estimate of the relative
merits of the two teams. Stanford
commenced her season earlier, and
has played more games than Cali
fornia. The State University has
not been scored against this season,
while Stanford has been defeated
twice. The first defeat was sus
tained at the hands of the Olympic
Club, which team the Cardinal
decisively beat two weeks later.
The second reverse was due to one
touch-down made by the Sherman
Indian team. Both of these defeats
occurred early in the season, before
the Varsity had attained even or
dinary form, and they did not
reflect the ability of the first team
even at that stage, for both scores
were against what was practically
a second eleven. Although not
scored against, California had a
narrow escape from defeat at the
hands of the fast team from Po
mona College. Despite repeated
reports to the contrary, both teams
have played in excellent form dur
ing the last two weeks, and they
will enter Saturday's game pre
pared for a hard struggle.


ASSISTANT COACH HAUVEKMAN
Clark and West, who will play
the end positions for Stanford, are
unquestionably superior to their
opponents. Besides being more ex
perienced, the Cardinal representa
tives are heavier than their adver
saries. Captain Clark is the
superior of any end now playing on
this Coast, and his election to the
captaincy of the team this year
was a deserved recognition of his
ability aB a player as well as his
popularity among his team-mates.
K. F. West is a new man on the
team, but he has gained his posi
tion by good, hard work, and it is
expected that he will outplay his
opponent to-morrow.
At the tackle positions the team
is unusually strong, both occupants
of the two places being veterans of
last year's team. Bprott will op
pose Force of California, and ought
to prove his superior. Shields is
considerably outweighted by Heit
muller, but the aggressiveness of
the Stanford man will compensate
for his lack of weight.
Roosevelt will be opposed by
Gray, a lighter and less experienced
player, and the big Cardinal gUHrd
will probably outplay his opponent.
Thompson at left guard is one of
the heaviest men on the team. He
has been played at tackle for the
greater part of the Beason, and this
practice has given him added speed
and aggressiveness. He ought to
outplay Stern in to-morrow's game.
Hyde will enter an intercollegiate
football game for the first time to
morrow. Opposed to him will be
California's captain, Stroud. In
weight and experience Stroud has
the advantage of his opponent, but
the latter will be able to hold his
own.
Bansbach at quarter is undoubt
edly superior to Boothe at all de
partments of the game. In the di
rection of the team the ex-captain
of the Stanford Varsity shows to
the best advantage, and the confi
dence which the Cardinal players
feel in him will be no small factor
in to-morrow's game.
Dole and Chalmers are not so
fast as Kern and Snedigar, but
they are more consistent ground
gainers. Dole can be depended on
to gain a short distance every time
he is given the ball, and as a line
plunger Chalmerß has no super
ior on either team.
Weller will be opposed by Sperry,
who made the chief gains for Cali
fornia in the Freshman game.
Weller's defensive work has im
proved considerably this year, and
his line-bucking powers remain
undiminished. He is in better
physical condition than he was
last year.
Head Coach Lanagan had the
following to say about Stanford's
chances against California in to
morrow's game: " I am more and
more convinced by the results of
this week's practice that it will
take the combined efforts of rooters
and team to win a victory from
California in to-morrow's game.
We have a better offensive team
than last year's eleven, and it is
equal to that team in defensive
ability. But it is also true that
California has a better team this
year. The players are not as bril
liant individually as last year's
representatives, but in team work
and spirit the eleven is superior to
the one which tied us last year."
Assistant Coach Hauverman is
sanguine of a victory over Califor

nia to-morrow. He Baid: "It will
be a close, hard game, but I think
that our team will win. From
observations of the playing of both
teams I am inclined to believe that
ours is in superior physical con
dition. California has some fine,
fast backs, and may score if one of
them should get away from the Car
dinal line. Our team consists of a
good lot of fighters who will not
give up until the whistle ends the
game."
Captain Clark said: "We are
going up to Berkeley with a fast,
hard-fighting team, and if it plays
its best ball we will surely win.
We are opposed by a very good
team, but we expect to score, never
theless."
''I)ad" Moulton was conserva
tive in his statement, but it is evi
dent from his actions that he
expects a Cardinal triumph. The
trainer said: "We have a good
fighting chance to score against
California to-morrow, and I am
quite sure that the team will make
the best of it, for the players are a
game lot of fighters who may be
depended on to do their best under
all circumstances. The eleven is in
better physical condition than the
team which opposed California last
year."
To-morrow afternoon, for the
fourteenth time, Stanford and Cali

has been played at tackle for the
greater part of the Beason, and this
practice has given him added speed
and aggressiveness. He ought to
outplay Stern in to-morrow's game.
Hyde will enter an intercollegiate
football game for the first time to
morrow. Opposed to him will be
California's captain, Stroud. In
weight and experience Stroud has
the advantage of his opponent, but
the latter will be able to hold his
own.
Bansbach at quarter is undoubt
edly superior to Boothe at all de
partments of the game. In the di
rection of the team the ex-captain
of the Stanford Varsity shows to
the best advantage, and the confi
dence which the Cardinal players
feel in him will be no small factor
in to-morrow's game.
Dole and Chalmers are not so
fast as Kern and Snedigar, but
they are more consistent ground
gainers. Dole can be depended on
to gain a short distance every time
he is given the ball, and as a line
plunger Chalmerß has no super
ior on either team.
Weller will be opposed by Sperry,
who made the chief gains for Cali
fornia in the Freshman game.
Weller's defensive work has im
proved considerably this year, and
his line-bucking powers remain
undiminished. He is in better
physical condition than he was
last year.
Head Coach Lanagan had the
following to say about Stanford's
chances against California in to
morrow's game: " I am more and
more convinced by the results of
this week's practice that it will
take the combined efforts of rooters
and team to win a victory from
California in to-morrow's game.
We have a better offensive team
than last year's eleven, and it is
equal to that team in defensive
ability. But it is also true that
California has a better team this
year. The players are not as bril
liant individually as last year's
representatives, but in team work
and spirit the eleven is superior to
the one which tied us last year."
Assistant Coach Hauverman is
sanguine of a victory over Califor

nia to-morrow. He Baid: "It will
be a close, hard game, but I think
that our team will win. From
observations of the playing of both
teams I am inclined to believe that
ours is in superior physical con
dition. California has some fine,
fast backs, and may score if one of
them should get away from the Car
dinal line. Our team consists of a
good lot of fighters who will not
give up until the whistle ends the
game."
Captain Clark said: "We are
going up to Berkeley with a fast,
hard-fighting team, and if it plays
its best ball we will surely win.
We are opposed by a very good
team, but we expect to score, never
theless."
''I)ad" Moulton was conserva
tive in his statement, but it is evi
dent from his actions that he
expects a Cardinal triumph. The
trainer said: "We have a good
fighting chance to score against
California to-morrow, and I am
quite sure that the team will make
the best of it, for the players are a
game lot of fighters who may be
depended on to do their best under
all circumstances. The eleven is in
better physical condition than the
team which opposed California last
year."
To-morrow afternoon, for the
fourteenth time, Stanford and Cali
fornia will meet in an annual foot
ball game. A particular and addi
tional interest over former games is
placed in the outcome of this con
test because it has the distinction
of being the first intercollegiate
football game to be played on the
campus of one of the two universi
ties, the thirteen precedingstruggles
having taken place in San Fran
cisco. In this respect to-morrow's
contest marks the beginning of an
important period in the history of
Western college football, and for
that reason there is an exceptional
incentive for both teams to play the
game with a snap and determina
tion that hRS had no equal in the
past. Of the preceding contests
Stanford has won five, California
haß won four, and the other four
have each resulted in a tie.
The team which will face Cali
fornia to-morrow was finally se
lected by the coaches at a late hour
this afternoon. The chosen eleven
iB one of the fastest and best bal
anced teams that has ever repre
sented Stanford in an intercollegiate
football game. In compactness of
formation and swiftness of attack
it excels any previous Varsity.
Coach Lanagan has made strenu

ous effort to overcome that lack of
scoring power which has distin
guished Stanford teams in the past,
and if the last preliminary games
were a reliable criterion, he has suc
ceeded in developing a superior of
fensive team. Expert opinion
agrees that the team this year is su
perior in offensive powers to last
year's Varsity, and on the de
fense it is at least equal to that
eleven.
Nine of the members of the Cardi
nal eleven are veterans of past inter
collegiate contests, and their experi
ence ought to have a potent effect
011 the result of to-morrow's game.
The two men who will face a Cali
fornia team for the first time are
not without football experience,and
their playing this year has been
consistently good. The fact that
Hyde has two such veterans as
Thompson and Roosevelt on each
side of him will materially aid the
new center. As a rule veteran
teams suffer from over-confidence,
but the members of this year's
eleven have been so hard pressed
for their places by the second team
that they have had no opportunity
to loaf. Some of the second team
men are barely inferior to their
successful rivals, and if any of the
Varsity men are compelled to re

tire from to-morrow's game their
places can be acceptably filled by
available substitutes. For this pur
pose Lanagan will take at least
thirteen substitutes to Berkeley
with the first team.
Great stress has been laid by the
coaches on the importance of ac
quiring a knowledge of the finer
points of the game, and in this re
spect the team is decidedly superior
to most of its predecessors. Al
though some of the formations used
by Stanford will undoubtedly prove
puzzling to their opponents, they
cannot be called trick play?, and
straight football will be relied upon
to score against California to-mor
row.
A comparison of the respective
records made by Stanford and Cali
fornia during the preliminary sea
son this year does not give a satis
factory estimate of the relative
merits of the two teams. Stanford
commenced her season earlier, and
has played more games than Cali
fornia. The State University has
not been scored against this season,
while Stanford has been defeated
twice. The first defeat was sus
tained at the hands of the Olympic
Club, which team the Cardinal
decisively beat two weeks later.
The second reverse was due to one
touch-down made by the Sherman
Indian team. Both of these defeats
occurred early in the season, before
the Varsity had attained even or
dinary form, and they did not
reflect the ability of the first team
even at that stage, for both scores
were against what was practically
a second eleven. Although not
scored against, California had a
narrow escape from defeat at the
hands of the fast team from Po
mona College. Despite repeated
reports to the contrary, both teams
have played in excellent form dur
ing the last two weeks, and they
will enter Saturday's game pre
pared for a hard struggle.


ASSISTANT COACH HAUVEKMAN
Clark and West, who will play
the end positions for Stanford, are
unquestionably superior to their
opponents. Besides being more ex
perienced, the Cardinal representa
tives are heavier than their adver
saries. Captain Clark is the
superior of any end now playing on
this Coast, and his election to the
captaincy of the team this year
was a deserved recognition of his
ability aB a player as well as his
popularity among his team-mates.
K. F. West is a new man on the
team, but he has gained his posi
tion by good, hard work, and it is
expected that he will outplay his
opponent to-morrow.
At the tackle positions the team
is unusually strong, both occupants
of the two places being veterans of
last year's team. Bprott will op
pose Force of California, and ought
to prove his superior. Shields is
considerably outweighted by Heit
muller, but the aggressiveness of
the Stanford man will compensate
for his lack of weight.
Roosevelt will be opposed by
Gray, a lighter and less experienced
player, and the big Cardinal gUHrd
will probably outplay his opponent.
Thompson at left guard is one of
the heaviest men on the team. He
has been played at tackle for the
greater part of the Beason, and this
practice has given him added speed

new center. As a rule veteran
teams suffer from over-confidence,
but the members of this year's
eleven have been so hard pressed
for their places by the second team
that they have had no opportunity
to loaf. Some of the second team
men are barely inferior to their
successful rivals, and if any of the
Varsity men are compelled to re

tire from to-morrow's game their
places can be acceptably filled by
available substitutes. For this pur
pose Lanagan will take at least
thirteen substitutes to Berkeley
with the first team.
Great stress has been laid by the
coaches on the importance of ac
quiring a knowledge of the finer
points of the game, and in this re
spect the team is decidedly superior
to most of its predecessors. Al
though some of the formations used
by Stanford will undoubtedly prove
puzzling to their opponents, they
cannot be called trick play?, and
straight football will be relied upon
to score against California to-mor
row.
A comparison of the respective
records made by Stanford and Cali
fornia during the preliminary sea
son this year does not give a satis
factory estimate of the relative
merits of the two teams. Stanford
commenced her season earlier, and
has played more games than Cali
fornia. The State University has
not been scored against this season,
while Stanford has been defeated
twice. The first defeat was sus
tained at the hands of the Olympic
Club, which team the Cardinal
decisively beat two weeks later.
The second reverse was due to one
touch-down made by the Sherman
Indian team. Both of these defeats
occurred early in the season, before
the Varsity had attained even or
dinary form, and they did not
reflect the ability of the first team
even at that stage, for both scores
were against what was practically
a second eleven. Although not
scored against, California had a
narrow escape from defeat at the
hands of the fast team from Po
mona College. Despite repeated
reports to the contrary, both teams
have played in excellent form dur
ing the last two weeks, and they
will enter Saturday's game pre
pared for a hard struggle.


ASSISTANT COACH HAUVEKMAN
Clark and West, who will play
the end positions for Stanford, are
unquestionably superior to their
opponents. Besides being more ex
perienced, the Cardinal representa
tives are heavier than their adver
saries. Captain Clark is the
superior of any end now playing on
this Coast, and his election to the
captaincy of the team this year
was a deserved recognition of his
ability aB a player as well as his
popularity among his team-mates.
K. F. West is a new man on the
team, but he has gained his posi
tion by good, hard work, and it is
expected that he will outplay his
opponent to-morrow.
At the tackle positions the team
is unusually strong, both occupants
of the two places being veterans of
last year's team. Bprott will op
pose Force of California, and ought
to prove his superior. Shields is
considerably outweighted by Heit
muller, but the aggressiveness of
the Stanford man will compensate
for his lack of weight.
Roosevelt will be opposed by
Gray, a lighter and less experienced
player, and the big Cardinal gUHrd
will probably outplay his opponent.
Thompson at left guard is one of
the heaviest men on the team. He
has been played at tackle for the
greater part of the Beason, and this
practice has given him added speed
and aggressiveness. He ought to
outplay Stern in to-morrow's game.
Hyde will enter an intercollegiate
football game for the first time to
morrow. Opposed to him will be
California's captain, Stroud. In
weight and experience Stroud has
the advantage of his opponent, but
the latter will be able to hold his
own.
Bansbach at quarter is undoubt
edly superior to Boothe at all de
partments of the game. In the di
rection of the team the ex-captain
of the Stanford Varsity shows to
the best advantage, and the confi
dence which the Cardinal players
feel in him will be no small factor
in to-morrow's game.
Dole and Chalmers are not so
fast as Kern and Snedigar, but
they are more consistent ground
gainers. Dole can be depended on
to gain a short distance every time
he is given the ball, and as a line
plunger Chalmerß has no super
ior on either team.
Weller will be opposed by Sperry,
who made the chief gains for Cali
fornia in the Freshman game.
Weller's defensive work has im
proved considerably this year, and
his line-bucking powers remain
undiminished. He is in better
physical condition than he was
last year.
Head Coach Lanagan had the
following to say about Stanford's
chances against California in to
morrow's game: " I am more and
more convinced by the results of
this week's practice that it will
take the combined efforts of rooters
and team to win a victory from
California in to-morrow's game.
We have a better offensive team
than last year's eleven, and it is
equal to that team in defensive
ability. But it is also true that
California has a better team this
year. The players are not as bril
liant individually as last year's
representatives, but in team work
and spirit the eleven is superior to
the one which tied us last year."
Assistant Coach Hauverman is
sanguine of a victory over Califor

nia to-morrow. He Baid: "It will
be a close, hard game, but I think
that our team will win. From
observations of the playing of both
teams I am inclined to believe that
ours is in superior physical con
dition. California has some fine,
fast backs, and may score if one of
them should get away from the Car
dinal line. Our team consists of a
good lot of fighters who will not
give up until the whistle ends the
game."
Captain Clark said: "We are
going up to Berkeley with a fast,
hard-fighting team, and if it plays
its best ball we will surely win.
We are opposed by a very good
team, but we expect to score, never
theless."
''I)ad" Moulton was conserva
tive in his statement, but it is evi
dent from his actions that he
expects a Cardinal triumph. The
trainer said: "We have a good
fighting chance to score against
California to-morrow, and I am
quite sure that the team will make
the best of it, for the players are a
game lot of fighters who may be
depended on to do their best under
all circumstances. The eleven is in
better physical condition than the
team which opposed California last
year."
