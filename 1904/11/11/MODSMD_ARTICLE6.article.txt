Thk eve of the mo*t important
athletic event of the year is at
hand, and every Stanford man and
woman feels a pride, and justly ho,
in the men who will champion the
Cardinal to-morrow afternoon.
Eleven men have been chosen, after
a long season of the hardest kind of
work. They have faithfully kept
training rule*; they have followed
implicitly the instructions and ad
vice of their coaches and trainer;
and they have been selected purely
on their merits. They constitute a
team that deserves to win, and we
believe that their efforts will he re
warded with victory, the first to be
recorded on California's new field.
To those who have taught the play
ers the game and to those who have
had the physical condition of the
squad to look after, there is little
we can add to the words of encour
agement and praise that have been
spoken elsewhere. We can, how
ever, take this opportunity of ex
pressing once more the thorough
appreciation of the student body
for the work done by coaches and
trainer, even though we can never
realize in the fullest extent how
much personal sacrifice these
men have made and the difficulties
which, they have had to overcome.
And to the men of the squad whose
names will not appear in the (irst
line-up, we can say that we owe you
a no less debt of gratitude. It is
true that as regards the general
public you do not - receive the recog
nition that falls to the men of the
first team,but in the view of the Stan
ford public your efforts do not go un
rewarded. You have put forth the
best that you have, and no one can
do more. Without your assistance
the first team could not be what it
is; and your greatest reward lies in
the realization that you have loy
ally done your part in the work
that cannot but bring honor to
your University. Whether Stan
ford wins or loses, the team and all

those who have contributed to the
cause cannot but feel satisfied. We
know that California's representa
tives will play a strong, sportsman
like game, for they have done so
before; and we also know that in
order to gain victory our team
must be supported by every Stan
ford constituent from the first kick
off until the official's whistle ends
the contest. The commencement
of campus football games makes it
more urgent than ever before that
that friendly rivalry between sup
porters of the respective teams
which has been carried on of late
years with scurcely any objection
able features, should be continued.
To-morrow Stanford will be the
guest of California, and it rests with
the wearers of the Cardinal to see
that, in every detail, we establish a
precedent that cannot be outdone.
