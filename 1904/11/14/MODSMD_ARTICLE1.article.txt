# Stanford 18, California 0.
## Cardinal Team Gains Decisive Victory. Both Elevens Receive Loyal Support from Partisans. 
### 
In the best football game ever
seen on this Coast,Stan ford defeated
the University of California at
Berkeley by the score of 18 to 0.
Team work and not individual
playing was responsible for the
Cardinal score. The Stanford of
fence, which was pronounced by ex
perts the equal of the Eastern sys
tem, proved irresistible, and the
California defense was helpless he
fore the heavy mass plays used by
Stanford. During the first half

the Stanford eleven was nervous,
and allowed California to get the
jump on them; but as the game
progressed the wearers of the Cardi
nal gradually gained confidence,
until at last they were playing like
a machine. The second line of de
fense proved a formidable barrier
to the California hacks, who were
unable to make any appreciable
gains through the Stanford line.
Heitmuller's magnificent punting
prevented Stanford from scoring in
the first half, but in the second
period the ball was so seldom in
the hands of California that his
kicking was of little avail. Next to
Heitmuller, Stroud played the best
game for the StateUniversity. With
only five minutes left to play, the
California captain was so badly
battered that lie had to retire from
the game.
livery member of the Stanford
team is to be given credit for the

victory, and no single individual's
work was prominent over his team
mates. Assisted by the superb in
terference of the other backs, and
the holes opened by the line men,
Chalmers made the longest gains of
the day. His splendid 75-yard run
was the most spectacular play of
the game. After the second touch
down Haffey kicked off to the Car
dinal right-half, who caught the
ball and ran 75 yards through tbe
California team before he was caught
by the fleet Snedigar. Dole at left
half played bis usual reliable game,
and it was seldom that he failed to
gain when he flung himself against
the California line. His defensive
work could not be excelled. Weller
at full-back showed that he is no
longer a novice at football by the
clever use which he made of bis
great strength. By falling his en
tire length forward every time lie

was tackled he materially increased
the number of yards which he
gained every time he was given the
ball. Bansbach, at quarter, was
playing great football, when he was
compelled to retire on account of
injuries sustained early in the
game. .lust before he was forced
to leave the field the gritty
little quarter-hack made a magnifi
cent run of 25 yards. In attempt
ing to hurdle Boothe, who was the
only obstacle between him and the
California goal, Bansbach sustained
the injury, which was the immedi
ate cause of his retirement from the
game. Stott, who took Bnnsbach's
place, held the team together well,
and by directing the plays against
California's weakest spot showed
that he is an exceptional football
strategist, who will be a valuable
Stanford player for at least two
years to come. With the exception
of one bad pass for a punt, Ilyde's

work at center was a revelation to
everyone. He held his own against
his experienced opponent, and con
trary to expectations,showed greater
endurance than Stroud. Thompson
and Roosevelt proved themselves in
every way superior to a number of
guards who were opposed to them.
At left tackle Sprott played a won
derful game. By completely out
playing Force he made holes which
led to long advances by Chalmers
and Weller. Working with Clark,
Sprott succeeded in repeatedly
blocking the California tackle.
Shields, at rij>ht tackle, was pitted
against Heitmuller, the best player
on the California line. The Cardi
nal tackle kept the State University
star so busy that he had no oppor
tunity to break through the Stan
ford line. At left end Captain
Clark played a matchless game,
and before the end of tbe contest he

did the finest thing of the day by
retiring in favor of Butterfield,that
the latter might get the sweater
which he bo well deserved. West
played a careful game at light end,
and his chief mistakes were due.in
a large measure, to his comparative
inexperience. Butterfield was in
the game for only a short time, hut
he showed himself a worthy Var
sity player.
The opposing (earns appeared on
the new California field before the
largest crowd which has ever as
sembled to witness a football con
test on the Pacific Coast. The
large concourse of football enthusi
asts assembled rapidly, and before
the whistle blew announcing the
kick-off almost every peat. was
occupied. The vast crowd was
handled admirably, and this fea
ture of the spectacle was all that
could be desired.
Never before in the history of

Western intercollegiate football
have the respective rooting sections
sprung so many novelties. Per
haps the most noteworthy of these
was the living white "S" in the
midst of the Cardinal rooting sec
tion. By donning white caps and
mantles, a number of the rooters
succeeded in perfecting the clever
innovation. From the opposite
side of the field the effect of the
white "S" with its cardinal back
ground was very striking. The
California yell leaders were super
ior to those of previous years, and
the rooters showed a corresponding
improvement in their singing and
cheering. Although greatly out
numbered the Cardinal rooters
managed to produce a volume of
sound which was not drowned by
the din from the California bleach
ers. One of the most impressive
incidents of the game was the sing-

ing of "Mail, Stanford, Hail," by
the Stanford rooters as the team
appeared on the gridiron for the
second half. The spirit which pre
vailed between the two sections
was excellent, and they vied with
each other in cheering the injured
players of both teams, and on the
held itself the game, although
fiercely fought, was remarkably
free from rough playing. The only
penalties imposed by the officials
were on account of off-side plays
caused by over-anxiety on the part
of the players.
The weather was pleasant for the
spectators, hut it was too sultry for
the comfort of the players. Only
one player of the Stanford team
was compelled to leave the field
during the game on account of in
juries, while California played nine
substitutes. The hne physical con
dition of the Cardinal team was
