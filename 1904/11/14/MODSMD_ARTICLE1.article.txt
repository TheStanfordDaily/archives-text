## Cardinal Team Gains Decisive Victory. Both Elevens Receive Loyal Support from Partisans.

In the best football game ever
seen on this Coast,Stan ford defeated
the University of California at
Berkeley by the score of 18 to 0.
Team work and not individual
playing was responsible for the
Cardinal score. The Stanford of
fence, which was pronounced by ex
perts the equal of the Eastern sys
tem, proved irresistible, and the
California defense was helpless he
fore the heavy mass plays used by
Stanford. During the first half

the Stanford eleven was nervous,
and allowed California to get the
jump on them; but as the game
progressed the wearers of the Cardi
nal gradually gained confidence,
until at last they were playing like
a machine. The second line of de
fense proved a formidable barrier
to the California hacks, who were
unable to make any appreciable
gains through the Stanford line.
Heitmuller's magnificent punting
prevented Stanford from scoring in
the first half, but in the second
period the ball was so seldom in
the hands of California that his
kicking was of little avail. Next to
Heitmuller, Stroud played the best
game for the StateUniversity. With
only five minutes left to play, the
California captain was so badly
battered that lie had to retire from
the game.
livery member of the Stanford
team is to be given credit for the

victory, and no single individual's
work was prominent over his team
mates. Assisted by the superb in
terference of the other backs, and
the holes opened by the line men,
Chalmers made the longest gains of
the day. His splendid 75-yard run
was the most spectacular play of
the game. After the second touch
down Haffey kicked off to the Car
dinal right-half, who caught the
ball and ran 75 yards through tbe
California team before he was caught
by the fleet Snedigar. Dole at left
half played bis usual reliable game,
and it was seldom that he failed to
gain when he flung himself against
the California line. His defensive
work could not be excelled. Weller
at full-back showed that he is no
longer a novice at football by the
clever use which he made of bis
great strength. By falling his en
tire length forward every time lie

was tackled he materially increased
the number of yards which he
gained every time he was given the
ball. Bansbach, at quarter, was
playing great football, when he was
compelled to retire on account of
injuries sustained early in the
game. .lust before he was forced
to leave the field the gritty
little quarter-hack made a magnifi
cent run of 25 yards. In attempt
ing to hurdle Boothe, who was the
only obstacle between him and the
California goal, Bansbach sustained
the injury, which was the immedi
ate cause of his retirement from the
game. Stott, who took Bnnsbach's
place, held the team together well,
and by directing the plays against
California's weakest spot showed
that he is an exceptional football
strategist, who will be a valuable
Stanford player for at least two
years to come. With the exception
of one bad pass for a punt, Ilyde's

work at center was a revelation to
everyone. He held his own against
his experienced opponent, and con
trary to expectations,showed greater
endurance than Stroud. Thompson
and Roosevelt proved themselves in
every way superior to a number of
guards who were opposed to them.
At left tackle Sprott played a won
derful game. By completely out
playing Force he made holes which
led to long advances by Chalmers
and Weller. Working with Clark,
Sprott succeeded in repeatedly
blocking the California tackle.
Shields, at rij>ht tackle, was pitted
against Heitmuller, the best player
on the California line. The Cardi
nal tackle kept the State University
star so busy that he had no oppor
tunity to break through the Stan
ford line. At left end Captain
Clark played a matchless game,
and before the end of tbe contest he

did the finest thing of the day by
retiring in favor of Butterfield,that
the latter might get the sweater
which he bo well deserved. West
played a careful game at light end,
and his chief mistakes were due.in
a large measure, to his comparative
inexperience. Butterfield was in
the game for only a short time, hut
he showed himself a worthy Var
sity player.
The opposing (earns appeared on
the new California field before the
largest crowd which has ever as
sembled to witness a football con
test on the Pacific Coast. The
large concourse of football enthusi
asts assembled rapidly, and before
the whistle blew announcing the
kick-off almost every peat. was
occupied. The vast crowd was
handled admirably, and this fea
ture of the spectacle was all that
could be desired.
Never before in the history of

Western intercollegiate football
have the respective rooting sections
sprung so many novelties. Per
haps the most noteworthy of these
was the living white "S" in the
midst of the Cardinal rooting sec
tion. By donning white caps and
mantles, a number of the rooters
succeeded in perfecting the clever
innovation. From the opposite
side of the field the effect of the
white "S" with its cardinal back
ground was very striking. The
California yell leaders were super
ior to those of previous years, and
the rooters showed a corresponding
improvement in their singing and
cheering. Although greatly out
numbered the Cardinal rooters
managed to produce a volume of
sound which was not drowned by
the din from the California bleach
ers. One of the most impressive
incidents of the game was the sing-

ing of "Mail, Stanford, Hail," by
the Stanford rooters as the team
appeared on the gridiron for the
second half. The spirit which pre
vailed between the two sections
was excellent, and they vied with
each other in cheering the injured
players of both teams, and on the
held itself the game, although
fiercely fought, was remarkably
free from rough playing. The only
penalties imposed by the officials
were on account of off-side plays
caused by over-anxiety on the part
of the players.
The weather was pleasant for the
spectators, hut it was too sultry for
the comfort of the players. Only
one player of the Stanford team
was compelled to leave the field
during the game on account of in
juries, while California played nine
substitutes. The hne physical con
dition of the Cardinal team was

shown by the speed with which the
eleven played during the second
half. The terrific hammering
which the California line received
from the heavy Cardinal backs was
responsible in a large measure for
the number of players who were
taken out of the game.
The work of the officials met with
approval from both teams. C. M.
Best, once captain and quarter
back of Lafayette College, acted as
referee in place of Ben Dibblee of
Yale, who was unable to be present.
Best never lost sight of the ball,
and the whistle was blown for
downs promptly and decisions im
partially rendered. Richard Smith
umpired and had occasion to penal
ize each team frequently for off
side plays.
A large number of Stanford
alumni were present at the game,
and they were as enthusiastic in
support of the team as the under
graduates.
At the close of the game the
Stanford rooters, some bearing the
victorious team on their shoulders,
antf the others forming the long ser
pentine, took possession of Califor
nia's new field. The demonstra
tion lasted for fully half an hour.
During the whole game Stanford
made her downs 42 times, while
California was able to make her
distance only once and that as
the game was nearly over. The
longest runs were 75 and 25 yards,
the first by Chalmers from a kick
off, and the second by a quarter
back play by Bansbach. Dole
made one buck of 20-yards through
the line, while Chalmers made
several dashes which exceeded 8
yards in length.
In an exchange of punts during
the first half Stanford lost many
yards, and at the close of the sec
ond period Heitmuller's punting
left the ball in California's posses
sion on Stanford's 30-yard line.
At 2:45 Sprott kicked off to Sned
igar, who fumbled the ball, but re
covered it. California attempted a
buck, but lost the ballon a fumble.
Weller bucked for 2 yards, and
Dole failed to make a drop-kick
for a field-goal. The ball was now
in California's possession on her
15-yard line. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line, and
Dole returned the kick to Califor
nia's 45-yard line. Kern bucked
for 3 yards, and California was
penalized 5 yards for an off-side
play. Unable to gain, Heitmuller
again punted. Weller and Shields
advanced the ball 5 yards. The
Cardinal lost 5 yards for an off-side
play, and California met a like fate
on the next down. Chalmers and
Sprott made first down, and Weller
was sent through center for 2 yardß.
Chalmers, outside of tackle, for 3,
and Weller, through center again,
for 2 yards. Dole and Chalmers
brought the ball 4 yards nearer
California's goal'on the next two
plays. Dole was thrown back for
no gain, and Chalmers burst
through tackle for 6 yards. Sprott
made 4 yards on the tackle-back
formation, but California held des
perately at this stage and blocked
Dole's punt. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line. Dole
returned the kick after two short
gains by Chalmers and Thompson.
It was now California's ball on
Stanford's 45-yard line. The Car
dinal held like a stone wall, and
Heitmuller punted to Chalmers,
who ran in 10 yards. Dole re

turned the kick and Stanford got
the ball on a fumble, but lost it on
downß. Heitmuller again punted
to Chalmers, who ran in 8 yards.
Dole returned the punt, and Heit
muller again kicked the ball within
dangerous proximity of the Cardi
nal goal-line. Thompson bucked
for 2 yards, and Dole again punted
out of danger. Clark got the ball
on a fumble, and Bansbach made a
25-yard quarter-back run. Bans
bach was tackled so hard that he
dropped the ball, and it was re
covered by California. Stott took
Bansbach's place. Heitmuller
kicked to Chalmers. Dole and
Weller each made 3 yards, but
Stanford was penalized for off-side,
and Dole punted to Boothe, who
ran in for 15 yards. Unable to
gain, Heitmuller punted to Stott
who ran in 10 yards, California
was off-side on this punt, and the
ball was taken back to her 30-yard
line. A series of punts were ex
changed, and with the ball in her
possession on her 20-yard line
Stanford began to carry it toward
California's goal. Shield's bucked
for 6 yards, and Dole and Weller
added 2 each. At this juncture
the first half came to an end with
the ball in Stanford's possession on
her 40-yard line.
California did not play poorer
ball in the second half, but the
Stanford team had struck its gait
and would not be held. After
two trials Gray kicked off to Stott,
who ran in 15 yards. Chalmers
was sent through tackle for 10 and
4 yards in succession. Dole bucked
for 1 yard, Weller for 3, and Dole
again for 4 yards. California was
penalized 5 yards for off-side play,
and Weller went through Stroud
for 3 yards. Chalmers made a
dash outside of tackle for 6 yards,
and Weller and Dole made 2 each
on the same play. The Cardinal
gained another 5 yards for an
offence by California, and Chal
mers made the same distance on a
buck. Weller smashed center for
6 yards, and Dole made 2 over
tackle. Chalmers made 4 more
through Force, and Weller added
5 yards by hitting the same
place. Chalmers repeated his at
tack on California's right tackle for
10 yards, and Thompson was sent
through tackle for 2. Chalmers
then ploughed through the Califor
nia line for the first touch down.
Sprott kicked a difficult goal, and
the score was 6 to 0.
Haffey kicked off to Weller, who
ran in for 20 yards. Dole bucked
over guard for 6 yards, and Roose

which never failed to make at least
4 yards. Stanford was penalized
for off-side play on California's 30-
yard line. Dole tried a drop-kick,
but it missed the goal, and Heit
muller was given a free kick from
the 25-yard line. The kick was
blocked by Hyde, but the ball was

mers, Dole, Weller and the line men

again began their battering tactics,

In the best football game ever
seen on this Coast,Stan ford defeated
the University of California at
Berkeley by the score of 18 to 0.
Team work and not individual
playing was responsible for the
Cardinal score. The Stanford of
fence, which was pronounced by ex
perts the equal of the Eastern sys
tem, proved irresistible, and the
California defense was helpless he
fore the heavy mass plays used by
Stanford. During the first half

the Stanford eleven was nervous,
and allowed California to get the
jump on them; but as the game
progressed the wearers of the Cardi
nal gradually gained confidence,
until at last they were playing like
a machine. The second line of de
fense proved a formidable barrier
to the California hacks, who were
unable to make any appreciable
gains through the Stanford line.
Heitmuller's magnificent punting
prevented Stanford from scoring in
the first half, but in the second
period the ball was so seldom in
the hands of California that his
kicking was of little avail. Next to
Heitmuller, Stroud played the best
game for the StateUniversity. With
only five minutes left to play, the
California captain was so badly
battered that lie had to retire from
the game.
livery member of the Stanford
team is to be given credit for the

victory, and no single individual's
work was prominent over his team
mates. Assisted by the superb in
terference of the other backs, and
the holes opened by the line men,
Chalmers made the longest gains of
the day. His splendid 75-yard run
was the most spectacular play of
the game. After the second touch
down Haffey kicked off to the Car
dinal right-half, who caught the
ball and ran 75 yards through tbe
California team before he was caught
by the fleet Snedigar. Dole at left
half played bis usual reliable game,
and it was seldom that he failed to
gain when he flung himself against
the California line. His defensive
work could not be excelled. Weller
at full-back showed that he is no
longer a novice at football by the
clever use which he made of bis
great strength. By falling his en
tire length forward every time lie

was tackled he materially increased
the number of yards which he
gained every time he was given the
ball. Bansbach, at quarter, was
playing great football, when he was
compelled to retire on account of
injuries sustained early in the
game. .lust before he was forced
to leave the field the gritty
little quarter-hack made a magnifi
cent run of 25 yards. In attempt
ing to hurdle Boothe, who was the
only obstacle between him and the
California goal, Bansbach sustained
the injury, which was the immedi
ate cause of his retirement from the
game. Stott, who took Bnnsbach's
place, held the team together well,
and by directing the plays against
California's weakest spot showed
that he is an exceptional football
strategist, who will be a valuable
Stanford player for at least two
years to come. With the exception
of one bad pass for a punt, Ilyde's

work at center was a revelation to
everyone. He held his own against
his experienced opponent, and con
trary to expectations,showed greater
endurance than Stroud. Thompson
and Roosevelt proved themselves in
every way superior to a number of
guards who were opposed to them.
At left tackle Sprott played a won
derful game. By completely out
playing Force he made holes which
led to long advances by Chalmers
and Weller. Working with Clark,
Sprott succeeded in repeatedly
blocking the California tackle.
Shields, at rij>ht tackle, was pitted
against Heitmuller, the best player
on the California line. The Cardi
nal tackle kept the State University
star so busy that he had no oppor
tunity to break through the Stan
ford line. At left end Captain
Clark played a matchless game,
and before the end of tbe contest he

did the finest thing of the day by
retiring in favor of Butterfield,that
the latter might get the sweater
which he bo well deserved. West
played a careful game at light end,
and his chief mistakes were due.in
a large measure, to his comparative
inexperience. Butterfield was in
the game for only a short time, hut
he showed himself a worthy Var
sity player.
The opposing (earns appeared on
the new California field before the
largest crowd which has ever as
sembled to witness a football con
test on the Pacific Coast. The
large concourse of football enthusi
asts assembled rapidly, and before
the whistle blew announcing the
kick-off almost every peat. was
occupied. The vast crowd was
handled admirably, and this fea
ture of the spectacle was all that
could be desired.
Never before in the history of

Western intercollegiate football
have the respective rooting sections
sprung so many novelties. Per
haps the most noteworthy of these
was the living white "S" in the
midst of the Cardinal rooting sec
tion. By donning white caps and
mantles, a number of the rooters
succeeded in perfecting the clever
innovation. From the opposite
side of the field the effect of the
white "S" with its cardinal back
ground was very striking. The
California yell leaders were super
ior to those of previous years, and
the rooters showed a corresponding
improvement in their singing and
cheering. Although greatly out
numbered the Cardinal rooters
managed to produce a volume of
sound which was not drowned by
the din from the California bleach
ers. One of the most impressive
incidents of the game was the sing-

ing of "Mail, Stanford, Hail," by
the Stanford rooters as the team
appeared on the gridiron for the
second half. The spirit which pre
vailed between the two sections
was excellent, and they vied with
each other in cheering the injured
players of both teams, and on the
held itself the game, although
fiercely fought, was remarkably
free from rough playing. The only
penalties imposed by the officials
were on account of off-side plays
caused by over-anxiety on the part
of the players.
The weather was pleasant for the
spectators, hut it was too sultry for
the comfort of the players. Only
one player of the Stanford team
was compelled to leave the field
during the game on account of in
juries, while California played nine
substitutes. The hne physical con
dition of the Cardinal team was

shown by the speed with which the
eleven played during the second
half. The terrific hammering
which the California line received
from the heavy Cardinal backs was
responsible in a large measure for
the number of players who were
taken out of the game.
The work of the officials met with
approval from both teams. C. M.
Best, once captain and quarter
back of Lafayette College, acted as
referee in place of Ben Dibblee of
Yale, who was unable to be present.
Best never lost sight of the ball,
and the whistle was blown for
downs promptly and decisions im
partially rendered. Richard Smith
umpired and had occasion to penal
ize each team frequently for off
side plays.
A large number of Stanford
alumni were present at the game,
and they were as enthusiastic in
support of the team as the under
graduates.
At the close of the game the
Stanford rooters, some bearing the
victorious team on their shoulders,
antf the others forming the long ser
pentine, took possession of Califor
nia's new field. The demonstra
tion lasted for fully half an hour.
During the whole game Stanford
made her downs 42 times, while
California was able to make her
distance only once and that as
the game was nearly over. The
longest runs were 75 and 25 yards,
the first by Chalmers from a kick
off, and the second by a quarter
back play by Bansbach. Dole
made one buck of 20-yards through
the line, while Chalmers made
several dashes which exceeded 8
yards in length.
In an exchange of punts during
the first half Stanford lost many
yards, and at the close of the sec
ond period Heitmuller's punting
left the ball in California's posses
sion on Stanford's 30-yard line.
At 2:45 Sprott kicked off to Sned
igar, who fumbled the ball, but re
covered it. California attempted a
buck, but lost the ballon a fumble.
Weller bucked for 2 yards, and
Dole failed to make a drop-kick
for a field-goal. The ball was now
in California's possession on her
15-yard line. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line, and
Dole returned the kick to Califor
nia's 45-yard line. Kern bucked
for 3 yards, and California was
penalized 5 yards for an off-side
play. Unable to gain, Heitmuller
again punted. Weller and Shields
advanced the ball 5 yards. The
Cardinal lost 5 yards for an off-side
play, and California met a like fate
on the next down. Chalmers and
Sprott made first down, and Weller
was sent through center for 2 yardß.
Chalmers, outside of tackle, for 3,
and Weller, through center again,
for 2 yards. Dole and Chalmers
brought the ball 4 yards nearer
California's goal'on the next two
plays. Dole was thrown back for
no gain, and Chalmers burst
through tackle for 6 yards. Sprott
made 4 yards on the tackle-back
formation, but California held des
perately at this stage and blocked
Dole's punt. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line. Dole
returned the kick after two short
gains by Chalmers and Thompson.
It was now California's ball on
Stanford's 45-yard line. The Car
dinal held like a stone wall, and
Heitmuller punted to Chalmers,
who ran in 10 yards. Dole re

turned the kick and Stanford got
the ball on a fumble, but lost it on
downß. Heitmuller again punted
to Chalmers, who ran in 8 yards.
Dole returned the punt, and Heit
muller again kicked the ball within
dangerous proximity of the Cardi
nal goal-line. Thompson bucked
for 2 yards, and Dole again punted
out of danger. Clark got the ball
on a fumble, and Bansbach made a
25-yard quarter-back run. Bans
bach was tackled so hard that he
dropped the ball, and it was re
covered by California. Stott took
Bansbach's place. Heitmuller
kicked to Chalmers. Dole and
Weller each made 3 yards, but
Stanford was penalized for off-side,
and Dole punted to Boothe, who
ran in for 15 yards. Unable to
gain, Heitmuller punted to Stott
who ran in 10 yards, California
was off-side on this punt, and the
ball was taken back to her 30-yard
line. A series of punts were ex
changed, and with the ball in her
possession on her 20-yard line
Stanford began to carry it toward
California's goal. Shield's bucked
for 6 yards, and Dole and Weller
added 2 each. At this juncture
the first half came to an end with
the ball in Stanford's possession on
her 40-yard line.
California did not play poorer
ball in the second half, but the
Stanford team had struck its gait
and would not be held. After
two trials Gray kicked off to Stott,
who ran in 15 yards. Chalmers
was sent through tackle for 10 and
4 yards in succession. Dole bucked
for 1 yard, Weller for 3, and Dole
again for 4 yards. California was
penalized 5 yards for off-side play,
and Weller went through Stroud
for 3 yards. Chalmers made a
dash outside of tackle for 6 yards,
and Weller and Dole made 2 each
on the same play. The Cardinal
gained another 5 yards for an
offence by California, and Chal
mers made the same distance on a
buck. Weller smashed center for
6 yards, and Dole made 2 over
tackle. Chalmers made 4 more
through Force, and Weller added
5 yards by hitting the same
place. Chalmers repeated his at
tack on California's right tackle for
10 yards, and Thompson was sent
through tackle for 2. Chalmers
then ploughed through the Califor
nia line for the first touch down.
Sprott kicked a difficult goal, and
the score was 6 to 0.
Haffey kicked off to Weller, who
ran in for 20 yards. Dole bucked
over guard for 6 yards, and Roose
velt went through the line for 2
more. Chalmers bucked for no
gain, and Dole was sent through
Heitmuller for 20 yards. Weller
bucked for 2 and 3 yards. Shields
made yards, and Stott was
tackled behind the line for a loss
of 24 yards. With 74 yards to go
on the third down, Chalmers
plunged through California's line
for 8 yards. Weller, Shields and
Thompson made the downs in
rapid succession, and Chalmers
was sent through Force for gains,
which never failed to make at least
4 yards. Stanford was penalized
for off-side play on California's 30-
yard line. Dole tried a drop-kick,
but it missed the goal, and Heit
muller was given a free kick from
the 25-yard line. The kick was
blocked by Hyde, but the ball was
recovered by California. Heit
muller made a short punt to Stott,
who ran in for 12 yards. Chal
mers, Dole, Weller and the line men

again began their battering tactics,
and Chalmers crushed through
California for the second touch
down. Sprott converted the sec
ond touch-down into a goal, and

In the best football game ever
seen on this Coast,Stan ford defeated
the University of California at
Berkeley by the score of 18 to 0.
Team work and not individual
playing was responsible for the
Cardinal score. The Stanford of
fence, which was pronounced by ex
perts the equal of the Eastern sys
tem, proved irresistible, and the
California defense was helpless he
fore the heavy mass plays used by
Stanford. During the first half

the Stanford eleven was nervous,
and allowed California to get the
jump on them; but as the game
progressed the wearers of the Cardi
nal gradually gained confidence,
until at last they were playing like
a machine. The second line of de
fense proved a formidable barrier
to the California hacks, who were
unable to make any appreciable
gains through the Stanford line.
Heitmuller's magnificent punting
prevented Stanford from scoring in
the first half, but in the second
period the ball was so seldom in
the hands of California that his
kicking was of little avail. Next to
Heitmuller, Stroud played the best
game for the StateUniversity. With
only five minutes left to play, the
California captain was so badly
battered that lie had to retire from
the game.
livery member of the Stanford
team is to be given credit for the

victory, and no single individual's
work was prominent over his team
mates. Assisted by the superb in
terference of the other backs, and
the holes opened by the line men,
Chalmers made the longest gains of
the day. His splendid 75-yard run
was the most spectacular play of
the game. After the second touch
down Haffey kicked off to the Car
dinal right-half, who caught the
ball and ran 75 yards through tbe
California team before he was caught
by the fleet Snedigar. Dole at left
half played bis usual reliable game,
and it was seldom that he failed to
gain when he flung himself against
the California line. His defensive
work could not be excelled. Weller
at full-back showed that he is no
longer a novice at football by the
clever use which he made of bis
great strength. By falling his en
tire length forward every time lie

was tackled he materially increased
the number of yards which he
gained every time he was given the
ball. Bansbach, at quarter, was
playing great football, when he was
compelled to retire on account of
injuries sustained early in the
game. .lust before he was forced
to leave the field the gritty
little quarter-hack made a magnifi
cent run of 25 yards. In attempt
ing to hurdle Boothe, who was the
only obstacle between him and the
California goal, Bansbach sustained
the injury, which was the immedi
ate cause of his retirement from the
game. Stott, who took Bnnsbach's
place, held the team together well,
and by directing the plays against
California's weakest spot showed
that he is an exceptional football
strategist, who will be a valuable
Stanford player for at least two
years to come. With the exception
of one bad pass for a punt, Ilyde's

work at center was a revelation to
everyone. He held his own against
his experienced opponent, and con
trary to expectations,showed greater
endurance than Stroud. Thompson
and Roosevelt proved themselves in
every way superior to a number of
guards who were opposed to them.
At left tackle Sprott played a won
derful game. By completely out
playing Force he made holes which
led to long advances by Chalmers
and Weller. Working with Clark,
Sprott succeeded in repeatedly
blocking the California tackle.
Shields, at rij>ht tackle, was pitted
against Heitmuller, the best player
on the California line. The Cardi
nal tackle kept the State University
star so busy that he had no oppor
tunity to break through the Stan
ford line. At left end Captain
Clark played a matchless game,
and before the end of tbe contest he

did the finest thing of the day by
retiring in favor of Butterfield,that
the latter might get the sweater
which he bo well deserved. West
played a careful game at light end,
and his chief mistakes were due.in
a large measure, to his comparative
inexperience. Butterfield was in
the game for only a short time, hut
he showed himself a worthy Var
sity player.
The opposing (earns appeared on
the new California field before the
largest crowd which has ever as
sembled to witness a football con
test on the Pacific Coast. The
large concourse of football enthusi
asts assembled rapidly, and before
the whistle blew announcing the
kick-off almost every peat. was
occupied. The vast crowd was
handled admirably, and this fea
ture of the spectacle was all that
could be desired.
Never before in the history of

Western intercollegiate football
have the respective rooting sections
sprung so many novelties. Per
haps the most noteworthy of these
was the living white "S" in the
midst of the Cardinal rooting sec
tion. By donning white caps and
mantles, a number of the rooters
succeeded in perfecting the clever
innovation. From the opposite
side of the field the effect of the
white "S" with its cardinal back
ground was very striking. The
California yell leaders were super
ior to those of previous years, and
the rooters showed a corresponding
improvement in their singing and
cheering. Although greatly out
numbered the Cardinal rooters
managed to produce a volume of
sound which was not drowned by
the din from the California bleach
ers. One of the most impressive
incidents of the game was the sing-

ing of "Mail, Stanford, Hail," by
the Stanford rooters as the team
appeared on the gridiron for the
second half. The spirit which pre
vailed between the two sections
was excellent, and they vied with
each other in cheering the injured
players of both teams, and on the
held itself the game, although
fiercely fought, was remarkably
free from rough playing. The only
penalties imposed by the officials
were on account of off-side plays
caused by over-anxiety on the part
of the players.
The weather was pleasant for the
spectators, hut it was too sultry for
the comfort of the players. Only
one player of the Stanford team
was compelled to leave the field
during the game on account of in
juries, while California played nine
substitutes. The hne physical con
dition of the Cardinal team was

shown by the speed with which the
eleven played during the second
half. The terrific hammering
which the California line received
from the heavy Cardinal backs was
responsible in a large measure for
the number of players who were
taken out of the game.
The work of the officials met with
approval from both teams. C. M.
Best, once captain and quarter
back of Lafayette College, acted as
referee in place of Ben Dibblee of
Yale, who was unable to be present.
Best never lost sight of the ball,
and the whistle was blown for
downs promptly and decisions im
partially rendered. Richard Smith
umpired and had occasion to penal
ize each team frequently for off
side plays.
A large number of Stanford
alumni were present at the game,
and they were as enthusiastic in
support of the team as the under
graduates.
At the close of the game the
Stanford rooters, some bearing the
victorious team on their shoulders,
antf the others forming the long ser
pentine, took possession of Califor
nia's new field. The demonstra
tion lasted for fully half an hour.
During the whole game Stanford
made her downs 42 times, while
California was able to make her
distance only once and that as
the game was nearly over. The
longest runs were 75 and 25 yards,
the first by Chalmers from a kick
off, and the second by a quarter
back play by Bansbach. Dole
made one buck of 20-yards through
the line, while Chalmers made
several dashes which exceeded 8
yards in length.
In an exchange of punts during
the first half Stanford lost many
yards, and at the close of the sec
ond period Heitmuller's punting
left the ball in California's posses
sion on Stanford's 30-yard line.
At 2:45 Sprott kicked off to Sned
igar, who fumbled the ball, but re
covered it. California attempted a
buck, but lost the ballon a fumble.
Weller bucked for 2 yards, and
Dole failed to make a drop-kick
for a field-goal. The ball was now
in California's possession on her
15-yard line. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line, and
Dole returned the kick to Califor
nia's 45-yard line. Kern bucked
for 3 yards, and California was
penalized 5 yards for an off-side
play. Unable to gain, Heitmuller
again punted. Weller and Shields
advanced the ball 5 yards. The
Cardinal lost 5 yards for an off-side
play, and California met a like fate
on the next down. Chalmers and
Sprott made first down, and Weller
was sent through center for 2 yardß.
Chalmers, outside of tackle, for 3,
and Weller, through center again,
for 2 yards. Dole and Chalmers
brought the ball 4 yards nearer
California's goal'on the next two
plays. Dole was thrown back for
no gain, and Chalmers burst
through tackle for 6 yards. Sprott
made 4 yards on the tackle-back
formation, but California held des
perately at this stage and blocked
Dole's punt. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line. Dole
returned the kick after two short
gains by Chalmers and Thompson.
It was now California's ball on
Stanford's 45-yard line. The Car
dinal held like a stone wall, and
Heitmuller punted to Chalmers,
who ran in 10 yards. Dole re

turned the kick and Stanford got
the ball on a fumble, but lost it on
downß. Heitmuller again punted
to Chalmers, who ran in 8 yards.
Dole returned the punt, and Heit
muller again kicked the ball within
dangerous proximity of the Cardi
nal goal-line. Thompson bucked
for 2 yards, and Dole again punted
out of danger. Clark got the ball
on a fumble, and Bansbach made a
25-yard quarter-back run. Bans
bach was tackled so hard that he
dropped the ball, and it was re
covered by California. Stott took
Bansbach's place. Heitmuller
kicked to Chalmers. Dole and
Weller each made 3 yards, but
Stanford was penalized for off-side,
and Dole punted to Boothe, who
ran in for 15 yards. Unable to
gain, Heitmuller punted to Stott
who ran in 10 yards, California
was off-side on this punt, and the
ball was taken back to her 30-yard
line. A series of punts were ex
changed, and with the ball in her
possession on her 20-yard line
Stanford began to carry it toward
California's goal. Shield's bucked
for 6 yards, and Dole and Weller
added 2 each. At this juncture
the first half came to an end with
the ball in Stanford's possession on
her 40-yard line.
California did not play poorer
ball in the second half, but the
Stanford team had struck its gait
and would not be held. After
two trials Gray kicked off to Stott,
who ran in 15 yards. Chalmers
was sent through tackle for 10 and
4 yards in succession. Dole bucked
for 1 yard, Weller for 3, and Dole
again for 4 yards. California was
penalized 5 yards for off-side play,
and Weller went through Stroud
for 3 yards. Chalmers made a
dash outside of tackle for 6 yards,
and Weller and Dole made 2 each
on the same play. The Cardinal
gained another 5 yards for an
offence by California, and Chal
mers made the same distance on a
buck. Weller smashed center for
6 yards, and Dole made 2 over
tackle. Chalmers made 4 more
through Force, and Weller added
5 yards by hitting the same
place. Chalmers repeated his at
tack on California's right tackle for
10 yards, and Thompson was sent
through tackle for 2. Chalmers
then ploughed through the Califor
nia line for the first touch down.
Sprott kicked a difficult goal, and
the score was 6 to 0.
Haffey kicked off to Weller, who
ran in for 20 yards. Dole bucked
over guard for 6 yards, and Roose
velt went through the line for 2
more. Chalmers bucked for no
gain, and Dole was sent through
Heitmuller for 20 yards. Weller
bucked for 2 and 3 yards. Shields
made yards, and Stott was
tackled behind the line for a loss
of 24 yards. With 74 yards to go

plunged through California's line
for 8 yards. Weller, Shields and
Thompson made the downs in
rapid succession, and Chalmers
was sent through Force for gains,
which never failed to make at least
4 yards. Stanford was penalized
for off-side play on California's 30-
yard line. Dole tried a drop-kick,
but it missed the goal, and Heit
muller was given a free kick from
the 25-yard line. The kick was
blocked by Hyde, but the ball was
recovered by California. Heit

who ran in for 12 yards. Chal
mers, Dole, Weller and the line men

again began their battering tactics,
and Chalmers crushed through
California for the second touch

In the best football game ever
seen on this Coast,Stan ford defeated
the University of California at
Berkeley by the score of 18 to 0.
Team work and not individual
playing was responsible for the
Cardinal score. The Stanford of
fence, which was pronounced by ex
perts the equal of the Eastern sys
tem, proved irresistible, and the
California defense was helpless he
fore the heavy mass plays used by
Stanford. During the first half

the Stanford eleven was nervous,
and allowed California to get the
jump on them; but as the game
progressed the wearers of the Cardi
nal gradually gained confidence,
until at last they were playing like
a machine. The second line of de
fense proved a formidable barrier
to the California hacks, who were
unable to make any appreciable
gains through the Stanford line.
Heitmuller's magnificent punting
prevented Stanford from scoring in
the first half, but in the second
period the ball was so seldom in
the hands of California that his
kicking was of little avail. Next to
Heitmuller, Stroud played the best
game for the StateUniversity. With
only five minutes left to play, the
California captain was so badly
battered that lie had to retire from
the game.
livery member of the Stanford
team is to be given credit for the

victory, and no single individual's
work was prominent over his team
mates. Assisted by the superb in
terference of the other backs, and
the holes opened by the line men,
Chalmers made the longest gains of
the day. His splendid 75-yard run
was the most spectacular play of
the game. After the second touch
down Haffey kicked off to the Car
dinal right-half, who caught the
ball and ran 75 yards through tbe
California team before he was caught
by the fleet Snedigar. Dole at left
half played bis usual reliable game,
and it was seldom that he failed to
gain when he flung himself against
the California line. His defensive
work could not be excelled. Weller
at full-back showed that he is no
longer a novice at football by the
clever use which he made of bis
great strength. By falling his en
tire length forward every time lie

was tackled he materially increased
the number of yards which he
gained every time he was given the
ball. Bansbach, at quarter, was
playing great football, when he was
compelled to retire on account of
injuries sustained early in the
game. .lust before he was forced
to leave the field the gritty
little quarter-hack made a magnifi
cent run of 25 yards. In attempt
ing to hurdle Boothe, who was the
only obstacle between him and the
California goal, Bansbach sustained
the injury, which was the immedi
ate cause of his retirement from the
game. Stott, who took Bnnsbach's
place, held the team together well,
and by directing the plays against
California's weakest spot showed
that he is an exceptional football
strategist, who will be a valuable
Stanford player for at least two
years to come. With the exception
of one bad pass for a punt, Ilyde's

work at center was a revelation to
everyone. He held his own against
his experienced opponent, and con
trary to expectations,showed greater
endurance than Stroud. Thompson
and Roosevelt proved themselves in
every way superior to a number of
guards who were opposed to them.
At left tackle Sprott played a won
derful game. By completely out
playing Force he made holes which
led to long advances by Chalmers
and Weller. Working with Clark,
Sprott succeeded in repeatedly
blocking the California tackle.
Shields, at rij>ht tackle, was pitted
against Heitmuller, the best player
on the California line. The Cardi
nal tackle kept the State University
star so busy that he had no oppor
tunity to break through the Stan
ford line. At left end Captain
Clark played a matchless game,
and before the end of tbe contest he

did the finest thing of the day by
retiring in favor of Butterfield,that
the latter might get the sweater
which he bo well deserved. West
played a careful game at light end,
and his chief mistakes were due.in
a large measure, to his comparative
inexperience. Butterfield was in
the game for only a short time, hut
he showed himself a worthy Var
sity player.
The opposing (earns appeared on
the new California field before the
largest crowd which has ever as
sembled to witness a football con
test on the Pacific Coast. The
large concourse of football enthusi
asts assembled rapidly, and before
the whistle blew announcing the
kick-off almost every peat. was
occupied. The vast crowd was
handled admirably, and this fea
ture of the spectacle was all that
could be desired.
Never before in the history of

Western intercollegiate football
have the respective rooting sections
sprung so many novelties. Per
haps the most noteworthy of these
was the living white "S" in the
midst of the Cardinal rooting sec
tion. By donning white caps and
mantles, a number of the rooters
succeeded in perfecting the clever
innovation. From the opposite
side of the field the effect of the
white "S" with its cardinal back
ground was very striking. The
California yell leaders were super
ior to those of previous years, and
the rooters showed a corresponding
improvement in their singing and
cheering. Although greatly out
numbered the Cardinal rooters
managed to produce a volume of
sound which was not drowned by
the din from the California bleach
ers. One of the most impressive
incidents of the game was the sing-

ing of "Mail, Stanford, Hail," by
the Stanford rooters as the team
appeared on the gridiron for the
second half. The spirit which pre
vailed between the two sections
was excellent, and they vied with
each other in cheering the injured
players of both teams, and on the
held itself the game, although
fiercely fought, was remarkably
free from rough playing. The only
penalties imposed by the officials
were on account of off-side plays
caused by over-anxiety on the part
of the players.
The weather was pleasant for the
spectators, hut it was too sultry for
the comfort of the players. Only
one player of the Stanford team
was compelled to leave the field
during the game on account of in
juries, while California played nine
substitutes. The hne physical con
dition of the Cardinal team was

shown by the speed with which the
eleven played during the second
half. The terrific hammering
which the California line received
from the heavy Cardinal backs was
responsible in a large measure for
the number of players who were
taken out of the game.
The work of the officials met with
approval from both teams. C. M.
Best, once captain and quarter
back of Lafayette College, acted as
referee in place of Ben Dibblee of
Yale, who was unable to be present.
Best never lost sight of the ball,
and the whistle was blown for
downs promptly and decisions im
partially rendered. Richard Smith
umpired and had occasion to penal
ize each team frequently for off
side plays.
A large number of Stanford
alumni were present at the game,
and they were as enthusiastic in
support of the team as the under
graduates.
At the close of the game the
Stanford rooters, some bearing the
victorious team on their shoulders,
antf the others forming the long ser
pentine, took possession of Califor
nia's new field. The demonstra
tion lasted for fully half an hour.
During the whole game Stanford
made her downs 42 times, while
California was able to make her
distance only once and that as
the game was nearly over. The
longest runs were 75 and 25 yards,
the first by Chalmers from a kick
off, and the second by a quarter
back play by Bansbach. Dole
made one buck of 20-yards through
the line, while Chalmers made
several dashes which exceeded 8
yards in length.
In an exchange of punts during
the first half Stanford lost many
yards, and at the close of the sec
ond period Heitmuller's punting
left the ball in California's posses
sion on Stanford's 30-yard line.
At 2:45 Sprott kicked off to Sned
igar, who fumbled the ball, but re
covered it. California attempted a
buck, but lost the ballon a fumble.
Weller bucked for 2 yards, and
Dole failed to make a drop-kick
for a field-goal. The ball was now
in California's possession on her
15-yard line. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line, and
Dole returned the kick to Califor
nia's 45-yard line. Kern bucked
for 3 yards, and California was
penalized 5 yards for an off-side
play. Unable to gain, Heitmuller
again punted. Weller and Shields
advanced the ball 5 yards. The
Cardinal lost 5 yards for an off-side
play, and California met a like fate
on the next down. Chalmers and
Sprott made first down, and Weller
was sent through center for 2 yardß.
Chalmers, outside of tackle, for 3,
and Weller, through center again,
for 2 yards. Dole and Chalmers
brought the ball 4 yards nearer
California's goal'on the next two
plays. Dole was thrown back for
no gain, and Chalmers burst
through tackle for 6 yards. Sprott
made 4 yards on the tackle-back
formation, but California held des
perately at this stage and blocked
Dole's punt. Heitmuller punted
to Stanford's 20-yard line. Dole
returned the kick after two short
gains by Chalmers and Thompson.
It was now California's ball on
Stanford's 45-yard line. The Car
dinal held like a stone wall, and
Heitmuller punted to Chalmers,
who ran in 10 yards. Dole re

turned the kick and Stanford got
the ball on a fumble, but lost it on
downß. Heitmuller again punted
to Chalmers, who ran in 8 yards.
Dole returned the punt, and Heit
muller again kicked the ball within
dangerous proximity of the Cardi
nal goal-line. Thompson bucked
for 2 yards, and Dole again punted
out of danger. Clark got the ball
on a fumble, and Bansbach made a
25-yard quarter-back run. Bans
bach was tackled so hard that he
dropped the ball, and it was re
covered by California. Stott took
Bansbach's place. Heitmuller
kicked to Chalmers. Dole and
Weller each made 3 yards, but
Stanford was penalized for off-side,
and Dole punted to Boothe, who
ran in for 15 yards. Unable to
gain, Heitmuller punted to Stott
who ran in 10 yards, California
was off-side on this punt, and the
ball was taken back to her 30-yard
line. A series of punts were ex
changed, and with the ball in her
possession on her 20-yard line
Stanford began to carry it toward
California's goal. Shield's bucked
for 6 yards, and Dole and Weller
added 2 each. At this juncture
the first half came to an end with
the ball in Stanford's possession on
her 40-yard line.
California did not play poorer
ball in the second half, but the
Stanford team had struck its gait
and would not be held. After
two trials Gray kicked off to Stott,
who ran in 15 yards. Chalmers
was sent through tackle for 10 and
4 yards in succession. Dole bucked
for 1 yard, Weller for 3, and Dole
again for 4 yards. California was
penalized 5 yards for off-side play,
and Weller went through Stroud
for 3 yards. Chalmers made a
dash outside of tackle for 6 yards,
and Weller and Dole made 2 each
on the same play. The Cardinal
gained another 5 yards for an
offence by California, and Chal
mers made the same distance on a
buck. Weller smashed center for
6 yards, and Dole made 2 over
tackle. Chalmers made 4 more
through Force, and Weller added
5 yards by hitting the same
place. Chalmers repeated his at
tack on California's right tackle for
10 yards, and Thompson was sent
through tackle for 2. Chalmers
then ploughed through the Califor
nia line for the first touch down.
Sprott kicked a difficult goal, and
the score was 6 to 0.
Haffey kicked off to Weller, who
ran in for 20 yards. Dole bucked
over guard for 6 yards, and Roose
