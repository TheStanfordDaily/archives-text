The only expression that has
been heard about Saturday's game
has been one of thorough satisfac
tion. Every Stanford man and
woman went to Berkeley with a
feeling that the Cardinal team
would win, and no one was disap
pointed. To the contrary, many
were surprised to know that our
eleven was three touch-downs
stronger than the opposing team,
for conservative experts did not
hope for a score greater than
12 to 0. All honor is due the
men who represented Stanford.
The University can well be
proud of the showing they made.
They had excellent spirit, they
played clean ball, and they worked
together. And to their opponents
is due the admiration of both col
leges. In the face of great odds,
the California men fought hard
through every play. They were
pitted against a superior team,from
whom they took defeat in fine
spirit. The support given both
teams by their respective bodies of
rooters and other sympathizers
could not have been better, and the
loyal spirit with which California
men backed up a losing team will
long be remembered. The day was
replete with particular instances,
everyone of which, if space per
mitted, could well be commended
at length. One especially fine
thing cannot be overlooked: The
present generation of undergradu
ates has not witnessed a more strik
ing exemplification of the true
Stanford spirit than the actof Cap
tain Clark in retiring from the
game in order that a man who had
consistently and faithfully sup
ported his college through four
football seasons might gain the
much coveted Varsity emblem.
Every man on the football team
wants to play throughout the game,
and when the captain of a winning
team retires of his own accord he
makes a sacrifice greater than

most people realize. The man who
won the sweater as a result of this
magnanimous act certainly de
served it, and the incident seems
to verify a frequent saying of
"Dad" Moulton's, that "any man
of sound physique who will work
long enough and who will sincerely
do his best will eventually make
his emblem."
