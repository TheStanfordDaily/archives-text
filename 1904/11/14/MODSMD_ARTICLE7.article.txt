# Students at the Theatre.
## 
### 
After the game the majority of
the students went to the California
Theatre. Owing to the delay in
getting back to the city from Ber
keley, many did not arrive until
the performance was well under
way, but there was never any lack
of enthusiasm. Nothing in the
play was allowed to stand in the
way of the thorough enjoyment of
the evening. The actors were
coached in the terms of the bleach
ers, the "joshing" being so continu
ous that they were compelled to
carry the Bhow right through re
gardless of whether it was heard or
not. A knowledge of the name of
the play was about all those in the
audience had. The situation is
well described in the yell of a foot
ball hero during the performance:
"Say, what's all this about, any
way?" The Glee Club was the
only part of the performance which
was given any attention. A part
of the new Stanford song, "The
Youngest and Best," by P. J.
Treat, graduate, and Miss A. W.
Kimball, '04, was sung by H. H.
Hurlbut, '06, with chorus by the
Glee Club, and was warmly ap
plauded.
The team was given a warm
welcome when it entered during
the first act, the hand-clapping
and cheering continuing for a
couple of minutes. There was
little organized cheering, and the
only individual honored with a
yell was Coach Lanagan. The
evening on the whole was an en
joyable one.
