# California Student to Speak.
## 
### 
At the regular meeting of the
Y. M. C. A. to be held Tuesday at
4:80 in room 23, Mr. G. White of
the University of California will
speak. Mr. White has been presi
dent of the association at Califor
nia for the past two years and in
addition has been prominent in
other college work, having recently
been editor-in-chief of the Daily
Californian.
The present interest in the in
tercollegiate relations of the two
universities makes this an ap
propriate time for Mr. White's visit
to the campus. The California
man is a speaker of ability and ex
perience, and it is hoped that a
large number of students will avail
themselves of the opportunity to
attend the meeting, which will be
open to all men of the University.
