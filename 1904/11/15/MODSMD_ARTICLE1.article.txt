# MASONIC FRTERNITY.
## A 						Hebrew-Letter Order Established at Stanford Last Night. 
### 
At Masonic Hall in Palo Alto last
night Beth chapter of the Acacia fra
ternity was established by J. \V.
Hawkins and W. S. Wheeler, mem
bers of the original chapter at the
UDiversity of Michigan. Although
similar societies are in process of
formation at Harvard, Wisconsin,
and California, Stanford is the first
college to receive the sanction of
the pioneer society of Michigan.
Twelve men were admitted to the
fraternity at the meeting conducted
by the organizers last night. Of
the neophytes initiated yesterday,
three are members of the faculty:
Professor W. F. Durand, head of
the department of Electrical Engi
neering; Professor J. 0. Griffin of
the German department; and Pro
fessor G. H. Rowe of the Electrical
Engineering department. The
other charter members are: C. I).

The new fraternity is founded on
masonic principles, and is a depart
ure from Greek-letter Societies in
that it makes use of the Hebrew in
signia. A man to be eligible must
be a master mason, but member
ship in the organization is purely
elective. Members of Greek-letter
fraternities are eligible for member
ship if their obligations do notcon
flict with those of the Acacia order.
One of the prime objects of the or
der is that of social benefit. The
Stanford chapter will occupy a
house as soon as one can be pro
cured, and it is anticipated that
this place will be headquarters for
Stanford masonry. The organiza
tion which was perfected at Ann
Arbor last June is the outgrowth of
the Masonic Association of the Uni
versity of Michigan, which had
been in existence for a long time.
W. S. Wheeler, one of the men who
organized the Stanford chapter,
was a prime mover in the original
organization of the movement. Af
ter five chapters tare established, a
national organization will be
founded. In the meantime the
authority for the founding of new
chapters is vested in the original
society at Michigan.
After the initiation last night the
members sat down to a banquet
which was served at the University
Restaurant.
