Just at present there seems to he
some doubt as to whether the foot
ball game scheduled with the Uni
versity of Colorado can lie carried
out. Those in charge of the Stan
ford team insist on meeting Colo
rado with the best we have got, or
else not at all, and in this we
think they are right. In years
gone by some inferior teams have
gone out from Stanford for post
season baseball and football games,
and have done more harm than
good. In fact, some teams repre
senting Stanford have done so
poorly that their exhibitions have
called forth resolutions from Stan
ford alumni clubs asking that such
teams be kept at home. These
matters of record warrant the foot
ball authorities in taking the
stand they do, and much as we de
sire to see a Stanford-Colorado
game, we would rather see it aban
doned than poorly played. And if
the members of the first team cannot
see their way clear to make the trip,
it is probably asking too much to in
sist on their going. They have made
no small sacrifice of time and en
ergy during the season, and if they
feel that the rest of the semester
should be devoted to their college
work and personal interests, it
would seem that they should not
be adversely criticized. The suc
cess of the Colorado game seems to
depend upon the number of first
team players who can afford to
