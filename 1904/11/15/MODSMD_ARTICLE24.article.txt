just about the amount that Har

two American Rhodes' scholars won
events. VV. E. Schutt of Cornell
was first in the half-mile run, and
T. M. Young of South Dakota cap
tured the high jump with a record
of 5 ft. 5 in. Young also won the
preliminary heat for the hundred

—Michigan'sfoothall eleven holds
the Western record again for points
scored in one game against an op
ponent. In the game with Kala
mazoo College, Michigan scored
95 points in two short halves, and
stopped only because the backs got
tired out running down the field
with the hall. Heston, the captain
of the Michigan team, made 515
yards himself, which is something
over a quarter of a mile, and scored
fiveof the touch-downs, two of which
came after runs of 75 yards, and two
of 60 yards.
