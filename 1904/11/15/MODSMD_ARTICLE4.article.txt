# Track Meet Saturday.
## 
### 
The usual fall field meet will be
held next Saturday morning at 10
o'clock sharp. It had been intended
to postpone this meet to the 26th
of this month, but owing to the
Thanksgiving recess coming at this
time the meet will be held next Sat
urday.
All entries for this meet must be
handed to Trainer Moulton before
Friday afternoon. Thehandingin
of entries has been made necessary
on account of the large number who
are expected to enter the sprints.
Accordingly there will be several
heats in the short distances.
The two-mile event will be re
duced to three laps. The sprints
will be run full length.
All men wishing to enter the
meet are urged to hand in their
names at once, in order that Cap
tain Bell and Trainer Moulton may
know as soon as possible how many
entries there will lie.
