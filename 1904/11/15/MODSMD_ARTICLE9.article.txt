# MR. GREET WILL SPEAK.
## Will Give Address on "Hamlet" in Chapel Friday Afternoon. 
### 
At tlie invitation of the English
Club, Mr. Hen Greet has consented
to talk to the students of the Uni
versity in the chapel Friday after
noon, November 18th, at 1:30. He
will discuss in general the revival
of Shaksperean plays in the Eliza
bethan manner, with some par
ticular remarks about ''Hamlet."
The players will arrive on the cam
pus Friday morning in order that
there may be a full rehearsal that
afternoon, both of the regular act
ors and of the students who are to
assist.
It is especially appropriate that
"Hamlet" should be chosen for
this academic revival, for it is
unique among the plays of Shak
spere in having had some of its
earliest presentations in the two
universities of Cambridge and Ox
ford. "Hamlet" is a play that ap
peals to an educated audience, and
it is appropriate that now, as in its
origin, it should be played at a
university.
With other conditions, it would
be almost impossible to give the
play in full. The Fortinbras part,
for instance, is ordinarily cut out,
although by so doing the play is
deprived of its beautiful and im
pressive ending.
One of the most interesting epi
sodes in "Hamlet" is that of the
players who come to the Danish
court and present the dumb-show
and the plav which lead up to the
climax. Hamlet's words to these
players are extremely important in
expressing his ideas about the
high place occupied by the drama.
Shakspere was himself an actor as
well as a playwright and a poet.
In giving advice to the players,
then, and in asking them "to hold,
as t'were, the mirror up to nature,"
he was telling them not only how
he would have his own plays acted
but expressing the fundamental
principle of dramatic art. Ham
let's speech shows how much em
phasis Shakspere placed not mere
ly upon beautiful and poetic lan
guage, which may be read, but
upon the accompanying action,
which may be best appreciated
when the play is seen.
The sale of seats tor "Hamlet"
began this morning, and the great
demand shows there will be an ex
ceptionally large attendance. The
sale continues during the week at the
University Bookstore on the cam
pus, the Stanford Pharmacy in
I'alo Alto, and at the Ourtaz music
store in San Jose.
On account of the impossibility
of securing a suitable room on the
quadrangle, the Young Women's
Christian Association has been
forced to abandon its plan to serve
dinner to the guests who come for
the play. Instead, arrangements
have been made by which a special
dinner will be served to visitors in
the dining-room of Roble Hall at
6:30. For this, the charge will be
35 cents.
