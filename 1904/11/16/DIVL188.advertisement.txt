"VT OW THAT The Bookstore has had a very satisfactory sale of choice
stationery at reduced rates, the stock of books has been ransacked
for bargains. There are several hundred volumes of left-overs that are
offered at from forty to ninety per cent discount. History, Economics,
and Education are each well represented in this list.
Prospective teachers and others needing books of reference should
examine this stock.
