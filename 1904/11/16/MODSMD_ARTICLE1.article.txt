# COLORADO GAME.
## Varsity Team Resumes Training for Thanksgiving Day Contest at Denver. 
### 
For a time yesterday it was gen
erally reported that the game with
the University of Colorado at Den
ver on Thanksgiving Day would
not take place as scheduled. Most
of the members of the team ap
peared on the gridiron last night
for practice, but before appearing
on the field they voted not to make
the trip unless the full strength of
the eleven could lie represented.
At a conference between Manager
Barrett, the coaches, and Captain
Clark held last night it was finally
decided to make the trip. Every
member of the team has decided to
go except W. K. Roosevelt, and his
place at right guard will be filled
by T. Van Sickle. Besides the
regular team, five substitutes,
Coach Lanagan and Manager Bar
rett will go to Denver. The party
will leave San Francisco Sunday
morning.
The game has been extensively
advertised, and it is exciting wide
interest in Colorado. The contest
will take place on the Broadway
Park gridiron in the city of Den
ver. The Colorado team is con
sidered the strongest eleven in the
Rocky Mountain district, and as it
has defeated the Nebraska team
the Thanksgiving Day contest will
give a good opportunity for a com
parison of Middle West and Coast
football.
In preparation for the Denver
game the Varsity will line up
against the second eleven every
evening this week. Training rules
are still in force, and will be ad
