From the number of Junior plugs
now being worn on the campus it
would seem that the length of time
during which the plugs are to be
seen is growing less and less each
succeeding year. It has been less
than a month since the Plug Ugly
took place, and now there is but an
extremely small percentage of the
Junior class hats being worn. The
battered plug is conceded to be not
very becoming to most men, but
we suppose it was never intended
to be so at the outset. The wear
ing of plugs by the Juniors is,
however, a college custom. It is a
custom of long standing that most
people in the community want to
see continued. If the tendency to
lay aside the plugs the day or the
week following the dedication cere
mony is continued, it will not be
long before the farce which was
originally intended only to intro
duce the plugs will mark both the |
beginning and the end of plug!
wearing.
