# California Freshman Baseball.
## 
### 
The freshmen of the University
of California are having baseball
practice, preparatory to the intercol
legiate freshman match nextspring.
The freshmen have been practicing
off and on since the first of the
semester, but only two regular
games have been played.
In both contests the freshmen
have had the Young Phoenix team
of St.Mary's College for their oppo
nents. This team is considered the
second nine of that institution.
The Y'oung Phoenix team was vic
torious by the scores of 8 to 0, and
5 to 3.
From the showing made in these
two games, the first-year men seem
to be weak at the bat, but strong in
fielding. The third game of the
series with the Young Phoenix
team will he played before theclose
of the semester.
