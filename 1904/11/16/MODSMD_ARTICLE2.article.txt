### 
The new chemical engines of the
University fire equipment have
been for the present established,
one at the fire-house and the other
in the power-house. The arrange
ment is only temporary, and it is
probable that the second engine
will later be removed from the
power-house and placed nearer the
quad.
The student crew in the fire
house have received instructions as
to the working of these engines,
and are now capable of handling
them whenever the occasion may
arise.
