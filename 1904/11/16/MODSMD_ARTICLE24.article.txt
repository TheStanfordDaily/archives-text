# Periodicals in Use in Library.

### 
The circulation of Library books
this year shows a steady increase
over the number used in former
years. The daily average for the
first ten days of November was 981
books, which means the handling
of 1902 volumes by the desk force,
since each book given out must be
handled twice by the assistants.
This is an average of over two books
per minute during the fourteen
hours which the Library is open
each day.
The Library receives every month
the current numbers of 758 serials.
Of these 484 are purchased, the
rest being either gifts or exchanges.
Most of these are placed in the
reference-room and shelved in
alphabetical order. Among the
periodicals that receive less general
attention than they deserve are the
foreign illustrated weeklies of the
same type as the American Harper's
Weekly. Illnstrirte Zeitung, Jllus
tracion Espanola y Americana, and
the London Graphic are attractive
in their pictorial presentation of
current events of the various na
tions, especially in the pictures
from the seat of war in the Far East.
American magazines that are
not generally used are the Scientific
American and its supplement, de
voted to the wonderfully practical
value of modern discoveries and
knowledge, the International Quar
terly and the Forum, the only
American serials of the distinctly
review type common in England.
Among the best of the English re
views are the Contemporary, Nine
teenth Century and Afterward, and
the old standards, Blackwood's and
Edinburgh.
Magazines of the Pacific Coast
are well represented. The older
and best known of these are Over
land, Argonaut, Out West, and Sun
set. The Literary West is devoted
to Western writers and writings.
For California is the organ of the
California Promotion Committee
and is of special interest as a pro
moter of California. Others are
the Merchants' Association Review,
devoted to the discussion of munici
pal affairs, and the Ijewis and
Clarke Journal, devoted to the
Portland exposition of 1905, which
gives much space to Pacific Slope
history and progress.
