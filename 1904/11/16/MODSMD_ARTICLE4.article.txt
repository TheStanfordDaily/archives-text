# Football Pictures for "Quad."
## 
### 
Home very successful photographs
of the Varsity football game were
secured last Saturday by those in
charge of the athletic and photo
graphic department of the '06 Quad.
The work was putin charge of
Robinson of Palo Alto, and despite
the murkiness of the day he suc
ceeded in getting some excellent
views of the plays, the rooters and
the Held. Especially successful were
the pictures of the first touch-down,
and of the big white I< S" made by
the rooters. In the picture of the
rooting section it is possible to re
cognize with the naked eye all the
faces as far up as the fourth or fifth
row from the top. In several of the
pictures of plays most of the foot
ball men can be recognized, but the
majority of these pictures had to be
taken in the first half. After the
first touch-down it became too dark
for successful work to be done. The
pictures have been put on exhibi
tion at Crandall's Cyclery in Palo
Alto, and the photographer bus al
ready been offered many times the
amount paid by the Quad for copies
of them, but those in charge of the
vear-book will not allow any to be
purchased until after the Quad is
published.
