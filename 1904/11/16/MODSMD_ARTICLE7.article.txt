# TO HAVE ELIZABETHAN STAGE
## The 						Old English Setting Will Be Used in the Production of Hamlet. 
### 
A feature that adds much inter
est to the production of liamlet, to
he given in the Assembly Hall Sat
urday, is the use of the Elizabethan
stage built two years ago by the
English Club for the "Knight of the
Burning Pestle." It is appropriate
that the revival of one of Shak
spere's plays in the Elizabethan
manner should be given on an ac
curate reproduction of the stage as
it was constructed in his own day.
The elaborate scene to represent
this Elizabethan stage was designed
by H. R. Johnson, '04, from a curi
ous drawing made of the Swan
Theatre in London by a German
traveler, .Johannis de Witt, in the
year 1596. From this, and one or
two other less complete drawings,
from Thomas Deckar's "Gulb Home
Booke," and from numerous allu
sions by other waiters, it has been
possible to form a very definite idea
as to the arrangement of the stage
and theater in the time of Shak
spere. The stage built here is one
of the very few careful attempts to
reconstruct an historically accurate
setting for an Elizabethan play.
So far this stage has been used only
at the performances of the "Knight
of the Burning Pestle" here and at
Berkeley.
One great advantage of the Eliz
abethan stage, apart from its histor
ical interest, is that it enables the
play to proceed without the dis
tracting intermissions, and shifting
of scenery, that are inevitable in
the modern theater. This gives the
play a continuity, and a unity,that
would otherwise be lost. Shak
spere's beautiful and suggestive
words often picture a scene the
imagination much more satisfactor
ily than some of the elaborate mod
ern stage effects. When Hamlet
says,"The air bites shrewdly; it is
very cold," and Horatio replies, "It
is a nipping and an eager air," we
do not feel the need of scenery. The
very absence of scenery throws ad
ditional emphasis on the words of
the poet.
"Once in a while, at least," says
Professor Alden in his book, 'On
Seeing an Elizabethan Play,'"we
should put aside our conception
of these dramas as existing on the
printed page; and more, put aside
our conception of them as presented
with all the pomp and circumstance
of a modern theater, Btaged and
costumed by Sir Henrv Jrving or
Mr. Beerbohm Tree; trying to see
in place of all this the compara
tively barren and primitive stage of
Elizabethan days, with its boy
actors, its garish daylight, its in
truding spectators, its simple but
merry music, its magnificence
wholly centered in the words of its
plays."
For the performance on Saturday
the English Club has arranged for
an Elizabethan audience to sit in
the boxes of the stage, a feature
that will add to the picturesque
setting of the play. Among those
who will participate in this part of
the cast are Misses C. Soule, '05,
H. Traphaean, '05, M. A. Winslow,
'06, J. S. Boynton, '06, A. M. Rich

aids, '05, Messrs. M. H. Thorpe,'os,
F-. H. Fowler, '04, H. A. Moran, '05,
R. V. Anderson, '05, A. N. Lewis,
'06, J. Sheehy, '06, R. T. Ryone,
'07. There will be several others,
whose names have not yet been
