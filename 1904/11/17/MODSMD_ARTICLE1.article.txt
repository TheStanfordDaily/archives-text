# ENGLISH CLUB SELECTS PLAY.
## Ben Jonson's "Everyman in His Humor" To Be Given Next Semester. 
### 
Ben Jonson's play of "Everyman
in His Humor" has been selected
by the English Club as the play
which it is to present in the early
part of next semester. This decis
ion was reached last night at the
regular meeting of the club, which
was held at the Kappa Alpha Theta
house, after the committee that had
been appointed had submitted its
report in favor of the play.
The report of the committee was
made through its chairman, Pro
fessor R. M. Alden, of the English
department. In looking over the
field of possible productions the
committee found it a difficult mat
ter to discover a play that should
rival in interest and general possi
bilities the "Knight of the Burning
Pestle," which was given with such
phenomenal success two years ago.
A Shaksperean play might have
suited the requirements, had it not
been for the two Ben Greet produc
tions this semester. On the other
hand, no essentially modern play
could be expected to bring even a
financial success, and accordingly
it was decided to select a play with
an Elizabethan setting, and at the
same time not Shaksperean. Upon
canvassing the available plays,
Jonson's "Everyman in His Hu
mor" was found to be best suited
to the uses of the club, and the
committee therefore recommended
it.
Professor Alden Btated that while
this play is not by any means the
equal of the "Knight of the Burn
ing Pestle" for stage action, at the
same time it contains opportuni
ties for character work of an excep
tional order.
The committee also offered the
following suggestions: That the
play should be given before
March 1, 1905; that a commit
tee of seven be appointed by the
president to take charge of the play;
and that the coaching of the actors
and other preliminary work should
be putin charge of Mr. L. E. Bas
sett of the English department. It
is understood that Mr. Bassett will
undertake the work, as the play will
be a University affair, although he
has not been able to find time for
minor productions. In reference to
the proposition presented to the
club by the Boat Club, that both
organizations should combine in
giving a play, the committee fur
ther suggested that the matter
should be left in the hands of the
proposed committee. It is under
stood that the Boat Club will have
nothing to do with the play itself,
but some arrangement will proba
bly be made by the committee so
that the Boat Club shall receive
something from the proceeds of the
P la y-
After a short discussion the re
port of the committee was accepted
in full. In giving his opinion of
the suitability of the play recom
mended by the committee, Professor
M. B. Anderson said that he be
lieved its production could be made
to arouse even more interest than
the "Knight of the Burning Pes
tle."
