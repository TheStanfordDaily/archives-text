Whatever fears have been en
tertained in the past as to the fi
nancial success of campus football
games are now dispelled. The re
port on last Saturday's game shows
the largest receipts in the history
of intercollegiate games, and as the
total expenses will be less than
heretofore, the net earnings of the
game will be exceptionally large.
When campus games were first
suggested one of the greatest argu
ments advanced against them was
that the financial returns would be
greatly decreased. As far as games
on the California campus are con
cerned, there is nolonger any ques
tion. And in regard to future con
tests on the Stanford campus, it
would seem that there ought to be
no doubt about a large attendance.
The location of the new California
field is such that the games held
there draw from Oakland, Berke
ley and San Francisco in larger
numbers than will the games held
here. But this will in part be off
set by the fact that games at Stan
ford will draw more people from
San Jose and other points south
of here. A crowd as large as at
tended the last game cannot be ex
pected here next year, but there is
every reason to believe that it will
be large enough to avoid any finan
cial em harassment.
