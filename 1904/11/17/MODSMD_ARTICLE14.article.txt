# Nevada Debate Assured.
## 
### 
A letter was received by the
University Debating Club to-day
from J. S. Case, debating manager
at the University of Nevada, con
senting to a contest with a Stan
ford team. The Nevada manager
makes no definite proposition as to
dates or place of holding the de
bate, and probably expects Stan
ford to name these terms. Accord
ingly, a meeting of the club will
shortly be held to make final ar
rangements.
