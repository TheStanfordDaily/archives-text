# FINANCES OF THE GAME.
## Gross Receipts Are Largest in History of Intercollegiate Football. 
### 
The financial returns of the in
tercollegiate game have been re
ceived, and are very satisfactory.
The gross receipts are larger by
considerable than those of any
previous game between California
and Stanford, and exceed last
year's receipts by $6,008. There
was also a large increase in the
net returns from the theatre; so all
in all the game was a thorough
financial success. The fact that
such results attended the first ef
forts to initiate campus games is
exceedingly encouraging to those
in charge of the student body
finances.
The gross receipts of the game
were $30,308 and the approximate
total expenses were $1000, thus
leaving $29,308 to be divided even
ly between California and Stan
ford. Last year the total expenses
amounted to about $6,000, which
included $5,000 for the rent of the
Richmond Field in San Francisco.
The initiation of campus games
has done away with this large item
of expense. Five per cent of Stan
ford's gross returns, amounting to
$732.70, will be placed in the
training-house fund, which now
amounts to about $6000.
The gross receipts from the the
atre were $1171.75, and the total
expenses, including $700 for the
rent of the theatre, were $745, leav
ing the net receipts $426.75. The
total net receipts from the game
and theatre, excluding amount
placed in training-house fund,
amount to $14,368.05.
