# Greet Company Arrives To-morrow
## 
### 
Mr. Ben Greet and hie company
of English actors will arrive on the
campus to-morrow morning from
Monterey. At 1:30 in the chapel
Mr. Greet will talk to the members
of the University on the revival of
the Elizabethan drama.
Mr. Greet has been one of those
most interested in the Elizabethan
Stage* Society of London. For a
number of years this society has
annually produced some play by
Shakspere or by some other Eliza
bethan dramatist. In these there
has been an effort to return to the
simplicity and effectiveness of the
Elizabethan stage. One of the re
vivals of this society was that of
"Everyman," which attracted such
attention that there was a large
demand for a more public presen
tation. It was to satisfy the desire
of Americans to see this play that
first brought Mr. Greet and his
English company to this country.
In England Mr. Greet occupies a
unique position. As head of "Pas
toral Players" he has for years
been presenting Shaksperean and
other comedies in the out-door
theatre of the Royal Botanical
Gardens in London, in the quad
rangles at Oxford and Cambridge,
on the lawns of some of the large
private estates, and in other his
toric places. His company, there
fore, has had a rather different aim
from that ordinarily associated
with the professional 6tage.
As before, the members of the
troupe will be entertained at the
various fraternity and sorority
houses on the campus. Mr. Eric
Blind, who was taken ill immedi
ately after his arrival in California,
will come down from Byron Springs
to take his part in "Hamlet," but
will return there after the play, for
he is not yet strong enough to
travel with the company.
There has been a large sale of
seats at San Jose. The special
train from there will leave the
broad-guage station at 2:15, stop
ping at College Park, Santa Clara,
and Mountain View, and coming
directly to the campus. It will re
turn after the evening performance.
