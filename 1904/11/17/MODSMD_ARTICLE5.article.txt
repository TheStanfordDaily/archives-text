# Library Foundations Completed.
## 
### 
The foundations for the new Li
brary building now stand com
pleted. These foundations, which
were begun early in the summer,
are the largest and strongest ofany
on the campus, with the exception
of the new Gymnasium. Several
hundred thousand bricks and many
wagon-loads of stone are now on
the ground, and everything is in
readiness to begin work on the
superstructure. Probably next
week will see the beginning of the
work. The cornerstone could be
laid now, but the ceremony will
not take place until the return of
Mrs. Stanford sometime next week.
