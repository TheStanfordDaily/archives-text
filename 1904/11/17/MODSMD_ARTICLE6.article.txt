# LECTURES ON "HAMLET."
## Prof. M.B. Anderson Reads Interesting Paper Before English Club. 
### 
At the regular meeting of the
English Club, held at the Kappa
Alpha Theta house last night, Pro
fessor Melville Best Anderson was
the speaker of the evening. In
view of the coming Ben Greet pro
duction of Shakspere's masterpiece,
Professor Anderson took the play
of "Hamlet" for his subject. He
said in part:
"The work of every great master
is invariably the subject of varied
and often contradictory interpreta
tion. In fact, this point has been
carried so far that it has become
almost the test of a great work of
art, whether or not the minds of
critics cannot find different ways
of construing and interpreting it.
If this point be granted, "Hamlet"
has ample testimonial to its high
rank among the works of Shak
spere in the many interpretations
of which it is c pable, and which
have been placed upon it by means
of the highest genius.
"Chief among the many interpre
tations that might be mentioned is
that of Goethe. Goethe sees in
Hamlet a gifted but unheroic be
ing, sinking under the weight of a
duty too great for him to bear.
This conception of Goethe is the
one which has had the greatest ef
fect upon the popular mind in in
terpreting Hamlet. It is in direct
antithesis to Coleridge's interpreta
tion, who sees in Hamlet a picture
of his own morbid self. It would be
possible to mention many other in
ter pretations, but as all disagree, it
is more profitable to follow out the
play along the lines of an original
conception of the character, taking
Shakspere himself as the one true
fixed authority on which to base
conclusions.
"The fundamental conception of
the character of Hamlet is that of an
idealist, who being rudely awakened
from his dreams, with all his ideals
cast down and trampled on, finds
himself thrown face to face with a
mighty problem which he must by
his own action overcome. The
struggles which take place within
him, as he is forced more and
more from the inactive part of a
dreamer into the man of unflinch
ing purpose that occasion demands,
is the lesson of the play. That a
man can carry his ideals with him
into the active life, is the lesson
which it teaches.
"The development of Hamlet's
character along these lines is best
shown in the eight soliloquys. The
first soliloquy shows his state. His
ideal of womanhood has been shat
tered by his mother, for whom,
however, his affectionate nature re
tains its love. His ideals of faith
and confidence in men have been
crushed out by his uncle. In the
second soliloquy is shown his be
lief in Nemesis, that he is fated to
be his father's avenger, and here
we find the beginning of the strug
gle that is to end in his ultimate
triumph over himself. In the third
soliloquy how completely is the
bottom gone out of bis first ideals,
and in the fourth we find his atti-
tilde already changed, and ho is
prepared to plan and act. Here
he conceives the idea of trapping
his nncle by means of the play.
The immortal fifth soliloquy sim
ply shows how deep has been the
struggle that has been going on in
his mind; and in the seventh, on
the eve of the tragedy, we find him
pausing to give in his characteriza
tion of Horatio his final ideal of a
man. From this, in the last solil
oquy he passes to his final justifi
cation of himself, by the standard
he has just set.
"Hamlet has been not unjustifi
ably called the autobiography of
Shakspere. Viewing many of the
conditions of the author's life, we
find that Shakspere too had been
a dreamer and an idealist. As
such he had come from the quiet
and peace of Avon to the noise and
bitter struggling of the London
play-house. What he did was not
to cease to dream, as others had,
but to apply his dreams."
