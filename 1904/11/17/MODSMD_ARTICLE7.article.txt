# GREAT BOTANIST LECTURES.
## Luther P. Burbank Delivers Three Lectures on "Heredity and Plant Breeding." 
### 
Mr. Luther P. Burbank of Santa
Rosa was listened to with the
closest attention by the members
of the departments of Zoology and
Botany from four o'clock until live
yesterday afternoon, and by the
Science Association yesterday eve
ning from 7:30 to 8:30. The audi
ences were limited to professors and
advanced students in both cases, as
Mr. Burbank prefers to discuss his
work in an informal way with a lim
ited number. He opened the first
discussion with a short essay set
ting forth his views of heredity;
but the remainder of the time, dur
ing the two hours, was devoted to
informally describing the results of
such of his experiments in hybridi
zation as bore on problems on which
university men are specially inter
ested, and to answering question*.
Mr. Burbank is too busy with his
work to give public lectures,but was
willing to come to the University
for a brief period on account of his
personal friendship for President
Jordan.
Mr. Burbank has lived for thirty
years in California, and his work
lias all had a practical aim: that of
improving the varieties of cultivated
plants, through crossing or hybridi
zation and selection. He lias ex
perimented with over two thousand
different species and varieties of
plants. As a result of this vast ex
perience he has come to a well set
tled belief that crossing can be ac
complished in a far greater number
of species than was formerly sup
posed; that crossing will invariably
disturb the tendency of like to re
produce like; that fixedness of
characteristics in a species once
having been replaced by a tend
ency to variability, one can bring
about in a single season, changes
in a species which could only re
sult in a hundred years through
the processes of natural selection
and reproduction. Hence Mr. Bur
bank's aim, for his practical pur
poses, is always to bring this tend
ency to variability into a species,
and this is most successfully and
quickly done through hybridiza
tion. His second aim is to control
and direct this variability, and to
produce some form that is new and
superior to the old, either in beauty
or usefulness, or in both.
He crossed the California walnut
with the Eastern black walnut.
The resulting seed produced a tree
of remarkable vigor, bearing a per
fect fruit, superior in size to that of
either of its parents. Mr. Burbank
has now several thousand seedlings
from this tree, each different from
the other in foliage. A dozen cards
were shown the auditors yesterday
with pressed leaves from probably
one hundred of these seedlings, each
