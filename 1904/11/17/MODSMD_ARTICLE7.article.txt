# GREAT BOTANIST LECTURES.
## Luther P. Burbank Delivers Three Lectures on "Heredity and Plant Breeding." 
### 
Mr. Luther P. Burbank of Santa
Rosa was listened to with the
closest attention by the members
of the departments of Zoology and
Botany from four o'clock until live
yesterday afternoon, and by the
Science Association yesterday eve
ning from 7:30 to 8:30. The audi
ences were limited to professors and
advanced students in both cases, as
Mr. Burbank prefers to discuss his
work in an informal way with a lim
ited number. He opened the first
discussion with a short essay set
ting forth his views of heredity;
but the remainder of the time, dur
ing the two hours, was devoted to
informally describing the results of
such of his experiments in hybridi
zation as bore on problems on which
university men are specially inter
ested, and to answering question*.
Mr. Burbank is too busy with his
work to give public lectures,but was
willing to come to the University
for a brief period on account of his
personal friendship for President
Jordan.
Mr. Burbank has lived for thirty
years in California, and his work
lias all had a practical aim: that of
improving the varieties of cultivated
plants, through crossing or hybridi
zation and selection. He lias ex
perimented with over two thousand
different species and varieties of
plants. As a result of this vast ex
perience he has come to a well set
tled belief that crossing can be ac
complished in a far greater number
of species than was formerly sup
posed; that crossing will invariably
disturb the tendency of like to re
produce like; that fixedness of
characteristics in a species once
having been replaced by a tend
ency to variability, one can bring
about in a single season, changes
in a species which could only re
sult in a hundred years through
the processes of natural selection
and reproduction. Hence Mr. Bur
bank's aim, for his practical pur
poses, is always to bring this tend
ency to variability into a species,
and this is most successfully and
quickly done through hybridiza
tion. His second aim is to control
and direct this variability, and to
produce some form that is new and
superior to the old, either in beauty
or usefulness, or in both.
He crossed the California walnut
with the Eastern black walnut.
The resulting seed produced a tree
of remarkable vigor, bearing a per
fect fruit, superior in size to that of
either of its parents. Mr. Burbank
has now several thousand seedlings
from this tree, each different from
the other in foliage. A dozen cards
were shown the auditors yesterday
with pressed leaves from probably
one hundred of these seedlings, each
leaf characteristic of its seedling,
and they were all surprisingly dif
ferent. This showed that the first
aim had been accomplished,namely,
a profound disturbance of the fixed
characteristics of the parent species.
When these come to bearing the
fruits may be expected to show
equal variations; then by selection
and hybridizations between selected
forms, there will be produced finally
almost any kind of walnut tree or
fruit that Mr. Burbank desires.
This cross has produced fertile
seeds; crosses between other wal
nuts were not fertile. It was for
merly held that all crosses were
infertile. The speaker said his ex
periments showed a great variety of
results. Some crosses gave a vigor
ous vegetative growth with small
reproductive power; some exactly
the opposite; while others showed a
combination favorable to both
growth and fertility of seeds. It is
not probable that any mechanical
law governing this matter can be
laid down. Each species, or cross,
is a law to itself. Indeed Mr. Bur
bank's experience all seemed to be
quite opposed to the so-called Men
delian law of heredity.
The speaker showed a large
number of leaves from as many
seedlings, obtained by crossing the
opium poppv and a perennial ori
ental poppy. The variety was as
great as in the case of the walnuts.
Mr. Burbank discovered a slight
trace of scarlet in a flower of the
common orange-colored California
poppy. By cultivation, selection of
seedlings, and by hybridization, he
has developed plants with pure
scarlet flowers. From the red poppy
of European fields he has obtained
by a similar process blue flowers.
The studies of Professor Hugo De
Vries, of the University of Amster
dam, upon evening primroses, were
brought up. The so-called new
forms were not produced by cross
ing, but by changes of environment.
Mr. Burbank believes that both
produce like results by disturbing
the settled conditions under which
a species has heretofore existed.
Certain species may be more easily
acted on than others by these
sources of disturbance, but when
variability in a species is once
brought about, almost any form
may be produced in rapid succes
sion. It is also possible through
such care as is taken by Mr. Bur
bank to fix the characteristics of
certain seedlings raised from crosses,
so that they will maintain a reason
able permanence. He produced a
hybrid between the Siberian rasp
berry and the common blackberry
of this Coast, which bore a fruit su
perior in size and quality to that of
either parent,possessing fertile seeds
and apparently permanent charac
teristics as a plant form, so that a
botanist, had he found it wild,
would unquestionably have de
scribed it as a new species.
Mr. Burbank also spoke in the
chapel at 10:15 to-day before the
class in Organic Evolution. He
discussed many of the points taken
up in the previous lectures, and
took the rest of the time to answer
questions asked by members of the
class. In introducing him to the
class Dr. Jordan presented him as
the greatest breeder of plants in the
history of botany, and a man whose
work will far outlive his time and
generation.

reproductive power; some exactly
the opposite; while others showed a
combination favorable to both
growth and fertility of seeds. It is
not probable that any mechanical
law governing this matter can be
laid down. Each species, or cross,
is a law to itself. Indeed Mr. Bur
bank's experience all seemed to be
quite opposed to the so-called Men
delian law of heredity.
The speaker showed a large
number of leaves from as many
seedlings, obtained by crossing the
opium poppv and a perennial ori
ental poppy. The variety was as
great as in the case of the walnuts.
Mr. Burbank discovered a slight
trace of scarlet in a flower of the
common orange-colored California
poppy. By cultivation, selection of
seedlings, and by hybridization, he
has developed plants with pure
scarlet flowers. From the red poppy
of European fields he has obtained
by a similar process blue flowers.
The studies of Professor Hugo De
Vries, of the University of Amster
dam, upon evening primroses, were
brought up. The so-called new
forms were not produced by cross
ing, but by changes of environment.
Mr. Burbank believes that both
produce like results by disturbing
the settled conditions under which
a species has heretofore existed.
Certain species may be more easily
acted on than others by these
sources of disturbance, but when
variability in a species is once
brought about, almost any form
may be produced in rapid succes
sion. It is also possible through
such care as is taken by Mr. Bur
bank to fix the characteristics of
certain seedlings raised from crosses,
so that they will maintain a reason
able permanence. He produced a
hybrid between the Siberian rasp
berry and the common blackberry
of this Coast, which bore a fruit su
perior in size and quality to that of
either parent,possessing fertile seeds
and apparently permanent charac
teristics as a plant form, so that a
botanist, had he found it wild,
would unquestionably have de
scribed it as a new species.
Mr. Burbank also spoke in the
chapel at 10:15 to-day before the
class in Organic Evolution. He
discussed many of the points taken
up in the previous lectures, and
took the rest of the time to answer
questions asked by members of the
class. In introducing him to the
class Dr. Jordan presented him as
the greatest breeder of plants in the
history of botany, and a man whose
work will far outlive his time and
generation.
Mr. Luther P. Burbank of Santa
Rosa was listened to with the
closest attention by the members
of the departments of Zoology and
Botany from four o'clock until live
yesterday afternoon, and by the
Science Association yesterday eve
ning from 7:30 to 8:30. The audi
ences were limited to professors and
advanced students in both cases, as
Mr. Burbank prefers to discuss his
work in an informal way with a lim
ited number. He opened the first
discussion with a short essay set
ting forth his views of heredity;
but the remainder of the time, dur
ing the two hours, was devoted to
informally describing the results of
such of his experiments in hybridi
zation as bore on problems on which
university men are specially inter
ested, and to answering question*.
Mr. Burbank is too busy with his
work to give public lectures,but was
willing to come to the University
for a brief period on account of his
personal friendship for President
Jordan.
Mr. Burbank has lived for thirty
years in California, and his work
lias all had a practical aim: that of
improving the varieties of cultivated
plants, through crossing or hybridi
zation and selection. He lias ex
perimented with over two thousand
different species and varieties of
plants. As a result of this vast ex
perience he has come to a well set
tled belief that crossing can be ac
complished in a far greater number
of species than was formerly sup
posed; that crossing will invariably
disturb the tendency of like to re
produce like; that fixedness of
characteristics in a species once
having been replaced by a tend
ency to variability, one can bring
about in a single season, changes
in a species which could only re
sult in a hundred years through
the processes of natural selection
and reproduction. Hence Mr. Bur
bank's aim, for his practical pur
poses, is always to bring this tend
ency to variability into a species,
and this is most successfully and
quickly done through hybridiza
tion. His second aim is to control
and direct this variability, and to
produce some form that is new and
superior to the old, either in beauty
or usefulness, or in both.
He crossed the California walnut
with the Eastern black walnut.
The resulting seed produced a tree
of remarkable vigor, bearing a per
fect fruit, superior in size to that of
either of its parents. Mr. Burbank
has now several thousand seedlings
from this tree, each different from
the other in foliage. A dozen cards
were shown the auditors yesterday
with pressed leaves from probably
one hundred of these seedlings, each
leaf characteristic of its seedling,
and they were all surprisingly dif
ferent. This showed that the first
aim had been accomplished,namely,
a profound disturbance of the fixed
characteristics of the parent species.
When these come to bearing the
fruits may be expected to show
equal variations; then by selection
and hybridizations between selected
forms, there will be produced finally
almost any kind of walnut tree or
fruit that Mr. Burbank desires.
This cross has produced fertile
seeds; crosses between other wal
nuts were not fertile. It was for
merly held that all crosses were
infertile. The speaker said his ex
periments showed a great variety of
results. Some crosses gave a vigor
ous vegetative growth with small
reproductive power; some exactly
the opposite; while others showed a
combination favorable to both
growth and fertility of seeds. It is
not probable that any mechanical
