At California the freshmen have
been out for baseball practice for
several weeks and have already
played two or three important
games. This would seem to indi
cate that the first-year team which
will represent the Blue and Gold
will be in shape to play a strong
game in the first freshman intercol
legiate baseball contest. This game
will be the first of the important
events that will take place in the
early part of next semester, and yet
there has been nothing done at Stan
ford toward fall practice. Captain
Trowbridge's time has been taken
up on the football squad, and for
that reason he could not be ex
pected to work with the Freshman
baseball players; but there are
other Varsity baseball men in col
lege who are not playing football,
and the work of getting the Fresh
men out for practice during the
present favorable weather would
t-eem rightfully to fall on
men. There is yet time for some
very valuable baseball practice,and
there seems to be no good reason
for delaying a matter that will help
bring us a victory in the spring.
