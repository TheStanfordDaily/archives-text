# Women's Athletic Association Notes.
## 
### 
During the football season the
work of the various brandies of the
Women's Athletic Association has
been going on slowly, but the
Thanksgiving recess will doubtless
be followed by a renewed activity
along all lines. The separation of
athletics from the regular gymna
sium work has rendered it a little
difficult to reach some of the
women who were prompt in re
sponding last season.
Between now and the close of the
semester it is planned to hold the
basket-ball tournament for the
class trophy, but as yet plans are
uncertain, as the Junior team is
the only one organized and ready
to play. The game between the '05
and '08 teams will probably be
held within the next two weeks.
The manager is endeavoring to ar
range a series of practice games
with outside teams.
The work of the tennis squad has
been limited to irregular practices,
but with the posting of scheduled
sets of players it is expected that
the more systematic work will begin.
