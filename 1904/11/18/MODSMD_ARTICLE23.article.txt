### 
— A new chapel, the gift of two
alumni, was recently dedicated at
Vassar with impressive ceremonies.
—Amherst has the only promi
nent football team in the East
which has not been scored on this
season.
—Plans are being made at Min
nesota among the girls of the ath
letic association for a women's
track mnet, to be held next March.
The meet will be conducted upon
much the same lines as the men's
meets and will include, for the most
part, the same events.
—Since Pennsylvania has de
feated Harvard, the Quakers arf
the only big Eastern eleven which
has not been defeated this season.
Because of the apparent falling off
in form on the part of the members
of the old "big four" it has been
suggested that the name lie taken
from them and bpstovred upon
Michigan, Carlisle, West Point, and
Annapolis.
