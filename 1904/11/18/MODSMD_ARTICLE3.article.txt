# Map of New Field Submitted.
## 
### 
The survey of the large area of
ground assigned for the new athletic
field has been completed, and the
map submitted to the Board of
Trustees of the University. When
the map has been passed on by the
trustees preparations for active work
on the new grounds will be com
menced. It is probable that the
football gridiron will be located on
the corner of the field nearest the
Escondite road.
The cost of the new football field
will not be as great as that of Califor
nia's new grounds, since there is no
grading to be done. The cost of
constructing the new bleachers at
Berkeley was $21,000. Should the
Stanford field be laid out in a north
easterly and southwesterly line a
view equally as fine as that from the
California bleachers will be secured.
The background of trees and moun
tains will give an extremely beauti
ful setting for the field. The survey
of the Southern Pacific Company
for sidetracks to the grounds in
cludes plans for a number of switches
branching out in a fan-like forma
tion capable of accommodating ten
trains.
The training-house corporation
now has between $8,000 and $9,000
available toward defraying the ex
penses of building the new grounds.
