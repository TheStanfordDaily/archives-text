# COLORADO GAME.
## Team Will Leave Sunday for Thanksgiving Day Contest at Denver. 
### 
Sunday morning the Varsity
football team will leave San Fran
cisco for Denver, where it will meet
the eleven from the University of
Colorado on Thanksgiving l)ay.
The game, which will lie played at
Broadway Park, is attracting wide
interest in Colorado, where it will
be the chief contest of the year.
Manager Barrett has received a
telegram from Denver which an
nounced that seats are selling rap
idly. There was some dispute with
the Colorado School of Mines for
possession of the field on the date
announced for the game with Stan
ford, but the matter has been satis
factorily arranged, and the sched
uled game will be the only contest
to take place in Denver on that
day.
At the request of the Colorado
management Barrett has agreed to
suspend the one-vear residence
rule. Although it is not known
how much this will increase Colo
rado's efficiency, Ithe change will
enable Stanford to play Crow if
his services should be required.
He will be taken along and will be
used at either the half- or full-back
position.
Coach Lanagan will not accom
pany the team on its trip to Den
ver. He is compelled to take this
action on account of his duties at
Belmont, which will not permit him
to be absent for so long a time.
Assist int Coach Hauverrnan will
assume charge of the squad while
they are gone. "Dad" Moulton
will accompany the men and will
take particular care of the players,
as there is danger that the trip
and the high altitude may cause a
change in their physical condition.
Manager Barrett is the third man
besides the players who will make
the trip. No rubbers will be taken
along, as they can be procured after
the arrival of the team in Denver.
Chalmers will not play against
Colorado next Thursday. In the
last down of the intercollegiate
match Saturday his back was so
badly strained that his physician
has forbidden him to play again
this Beason. His place will prob
ably be filled by Trowbridge, who
has played an excellent game
throughout the season. Roosevelt
will not accompany the team, and
Vati Sickle has consented to go in
his stead. Van Sickle has played
a brilliant game at guard this sea
son, and can be depended upon to
put up a good game.
Sprott is another strong player
who will not go with the team.
Horton has been playing in his
place this week and will play the
ieft-tackle position.
The line-up of the team will in
all probability be as follows: Left
end, Clark; left tackle, Horton;
left guard, Thompson; center, Hyde;
right guard, Van Sickle; right
tackle, Shields; right end, West;
quarter-back, Bansbach; left half
back, Dole; right half-back, Trow
bridge; full-back, Weller. Stott,
Butterfield, and Crow are substi
tutes, who will in all probability
play in the game.
