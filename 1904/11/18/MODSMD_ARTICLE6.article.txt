# MR. GREET SPEAKS.
## Interesting Address in Chapel on the Betterment of the Drama. 
### 
The chapel was filled this after
noon with an interested audience
to hear Mr. lien Greet on what he
characterized as a ''Hand-to-hand
talk on the betterment of the
drama." Mr. Greet spoke in a
pleasing and informal manner, and
held the close attention of his audi
tors throughout. He said that
there is a real decline in the drama
as evinced by modern tendencies,
and so there is some reason for the
demand that it shall be improved.
The fault lies not with the man
agers nor with the so-called ''the
atre trust," but with the people
themselves, as the managers study
the popular demand and furnish
them just what they want. Mr.
Greet gave a humorous account of
the experiences of his company
while on their recent trip through
Southern California, and said that
it was difficult to tell which had
done the worst, their own, or the
others who were their rivals in the
held, namely, "For Her Sake,"
"Sweet Clover," and "A Texas
Steer." However, he was forced to
confess that "Everyman" had been
the best patronized, for which he
expressed his gratitude. The prin
cipal strength of "Everyman" is
the fact that it cannot be "juggled"
and modernized in any way so
that its original force is im
paired.
Mr. Greet paid a high tribute to
the American public, and said that
he found that he had to come to
America to get a real appreciation
of his unadulterated ("eceneless,"
if you please) Shakspere. Hefinde
that the Americans really like his
Shakspere in the original, without
stage-tricks, limelight, and "other
modern garnishing and abomina
tion." He pronounced the Ameri
can public as having the reputa
tion for being the finest play-goers
in the world.
Mr. Greet then gave a resume of
the English public in regard to
patronage of the drama. He
said that there is a woeful neglect
of the study of Shakspere in Eng
land. There are very few schools
in England which pay any atten
tion to Shaksperean literature; and
even in the college towns the stu
dents would not think of attending
one of his plays. He characterized
the English attitude to be self-fiat
tery and self-satisfaction. The
plays of Shakspere are doctored up
in a spectacular manner until they
are past recognition, before they
can gain any patronage whatever
in London. They are never used
except when there is a "slump" in
the productions of the modern
playwrights, when "poor old Shak
spere is dragged from the shelf to
