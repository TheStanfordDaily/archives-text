# MR. GREET SPEAKS.
## Interesting Address in Chapel on the Betterment of the Drama. 
### 
The chapel was filled this after
noon with an interested audience
to hear Mr. lien Greet on what he
characterized as a ''Hand-to-hand
talk on the betterment of the
drama." Mr. Greet spoke in a
pleasing and informal manner, and
held the close attention of his audi
tors throughout. He said that
there is a real decline in the drama
as evinced by modern tendencies,
and so there is some reason for the
demand that it shall be improved.
The fault lies not with the man
agers nor with the so-called ''the
atre trust," but with the people
themselves, as the managers study
the popular demand and furnish
them just what they want. Mr.
Greet gave a humorous account of
the experiences of his company
while on their recent trip through
Southern California, and said that
it was difficult to tell which had
done the worst, their own, or the
others who were their rivals in the
held, namely, "For Her Sake,"
"Sweet Clover," and "A Texas
Steer." However, he was forced to
confess that "Everyman" had been
the best patronized, for which he
expressed his gratitude. The prin
cipal strength of "Everyman" is
the fact that it cannot be "juggled"
and modernized in any way so
that its original force is im
paired.
Mr. Greet paid a high tribute to
the American public, and said that
he found that he had to come to
America to get a real appreciation
of his unadulterated ("eceneless,"
if you please) Shakspere. Hefinde
that the Americans really like his
Shakspere in the original, without
stage-tricks, limelight, and "other
modern garnishing and abomina
tion." He pronounced the Ameri
can public as having the reputa
tion for being the finest play-goers
in the world.
Mr. Greet then gave a resume of
the English public in regard to
patronage of the drama. He
said that there is a woeful neglect
of the study of Shakspere in Eng
land. There are very few schools
in England which pay any atten
tion to Shaksperean literature; and
even in the college towns the stu
dents would not think of attending
one of his plays. He characterized
the English attitude to be self-fiat
tery and self-satisfaction. The
plays of Shakspere are doctored up
in a spectacular manner until they
are past recognition, before they
can gain any patronage whatever
in London. They are never used
except when there is a "slump" in
the productions of the modern
playwrights, when "poor old Shak
spere is dragged from the shelf to
meet the emergency." The last
appearance in London of the Greet
Company,in "As You Like It,"was;
the first Shaksperean production of
any kind that had been given in
all London for nine months. There
ib, however, once a year, what is
known as a Shaksperean Festival
at Stratford-on-Avon, when his
dramas are given for a week or two
and are patronized by pilgrimages.
This is the only thing that keeps
alive Shakspere in England. Other
wise lie would be forgotten as a
dramatist. Mr. Greet gave an in
teresting account of the modern
butcherings of Shakspere on the
London stage in "dodging, trans
posing, dishing-up elaborate and
picturesque effects," and introduc
ing "bullets, possessions, banquets,
gorgeous scenery, music," and the
like, until such simple and forcible |
pieces as "The Jem pest" and j
"Twelfth Night" are rendered more j
like a comic opera than anything j
else. This is especially grievous J
in view of the fact that Shakspere
so carefully indicates in his works
just where he wants dances, music,
and such innovations, in order to
bring out the best effect.
There is a movement now on foot
in England to build a memorial to
Shakspere, where the people have
recently made "a sudden discovery
that he died three hundred years
ago." Mr. Greet is anxious
that this monument shall be
in the shape of a Shaksperean
play-house, a reproduction of the
old Globe Theatre, which may be
used as an international theatre.
But from the poor support which
his suggestion has received there
he is of the belief that we must
turn to America for such an enter
prise, and he does not doubt that
it will be accomplished in this
country.
Turning to "Hamlet," Mr. Greet
said that we will get a long enough
siege of that to-morrow, and so be
would not take up the subject, ex
cept to beg us to get completely out
of our minds any idea that "Ham
let" was mad. Closing he requested
any students so inclined to write
an essay after the play to-morrow,
not as a criticism of the acting but
as a general impression of "Hamlet"
gained from an analysis of its en
tire production. Mr. Greet asked
that these essays be handed in, and
said that to the writer of what they
considered the best, he would pre
sent a copy of the Tempo series of
Shakspere. As this is the three
hundredth anniversary of the pro
duction of the second quarto of
" Hamlet," he suggested that, as a
a memorial, the e.-S'iv contain three
hundred words.

there is a real decline in the drama
as evinced by modern tendencies,
and so there is some reason for the
demand that it shall be improved.
The fault lies not with the man
agers nor with the so-called ''the
atre trust," but with the people
themselves, as the managers study
the popular demand and furnish
them just what they want. Mr.
Greet gave a humorous account of
the experiences of his company
while on their recent trip through
Southern California, and said that
it was difficult to tell which had
done the worst, their own, or the
others who were their rivals in the
held, namely, "For Her Sake,"
"Sweet Clover," and "A Texas
Steer." However, he was forced to
confess that "Everyman" had been
the best patronized, for which he
expressed his gratitude. The prin
cipal strength of "Everyman" is
the fact that it cannot be "juggled"
and modernized in any way so
that its original force is im
paired.
Mr. Greet paid a high tribute to
the American public, and said that
he found that he had to come to
America to get a real appreciation
of his unadulterated ("eceneless,"
if you please) Shakspere. Hefinde
that the Americans really like his
Shakspere in the original, without
stage-tricks, limelight, and "other
modern garnishing and abomina
tion." He pronounced the Ameri
can public as having the reputa
tion for being the finest play-goers
in the world.
Mr. Greet then gave a resume of
the English public in regard to
patronage of the drama. He
said that there is a woeful neglect
of the study of Shakspere in Eng
land. There are very few schools
in England which pay any atten
tion to Shaksperean literature; and
even in the college towns the stu
dents would not think of attending
one of his plays. He characterized
the English attitude to be self-fiat
tery and self-satisfaction. The
plays of Shakspere are doctored up
in a spectacular manner until they
are past recognition, before they
can gain any patronage whatever
in London. They are never used
except when there is a "slump" in
the productions of the modern
playwrights, when "poor old Shak
spere is dragged from the shelf to
meet the emergency." The last
appearance in London of the Greet
Company,in "As You Like It,"was;
the first Shaksperean production of
any kind that had been given in
all London for nine months. There
ib, however, once a year, what is
known as a Shaksperean Festival
at Stratford-on-Avon, when his
dramas are given for a week or two
and are patronized by pilgrimages.
This is the only thing that keeps
alive Shakspere in England. Other
wise lie would be forgotten as a
dramatist. Mr. Greet gave an in
teresting account of the modern
butcherings of Shakspere on the
London stage in "dodging, trans
posing, dishing-up elaborate and
picturesque effects," and introduc
ing "bullets, possessions, banquets,
gorgeous scenery, music," and the
like, until such simple and forcible |
pieces as "The Jem pest" and j
"Twelfth Night" are rendered more j
like a comic opera than anything j
else. This is especially grievous J
in view of the fact that Shakspere
so carefully indicates in his works
just where he wants dances, music,
and such innovations, in order to
bring out the best effect.
There is a movement now on foot
in England to build a memorial to
Shakspere, where the people have
recently made "a sudden discovery
that he died three hundred years
ago." Mr. Greet is anxious
that this monument shall be
in the shape of a Shaksperean
play-house, a reproduction of the
old Globe Theatre, which may be
used as an international theatre.
But from the poor support which
his suggestion has received there
he is of the belief that we must
turn to America for such an enter
prise, and he does not doubt that
it will be accomplished in this
country.
Turning to "Hamlet," Mr. Greet
said that we will get a long enough
siege of that to-morrow, and so be
would not take up the subject, ex
cept to beg us to get completely out
of our minds any idea that "Ham
let" was mad. Closing he requested
any students so inclined to write
an essay after the play to-morrow,
not as a criticism of the acting but
as a general impression of "Hamlet"
gained from an analysis of its en
tire production. Mr. Greet asked
that these essays be handed in, and
said that to the writer of what they
considered the best, he would pre
sent a copy of the Tempo series of
Shakspere. As this is the three
hundredth anniversary of the pro
duction of the second quarto of
" Hamlet," he suggested that, as a
a memorial, the e.-S'iv contain three
hundred words.
The chapel was filled this after
noon with an interested audience
to hear Mr. lien Greet on what he
characterized as a ''Hand-to-hand
talk on the betterment of the
drama." Mr. Greet spoke in a
pleasing and informal manner, and
held the close attention of his audi
tors throughout. He said that
there is a real decline in the drama
as evinced by modern tendencies,
and so there is some reason for the
demand that it shall be improved.
