To-mokrow morning will he given
the first real opportunity to Bee
what the prospects are for a Stan
ford track victory next April. All
during the football season a large
number of track men have been at
work, and now that the gridiron
has practically ceased to be a cen
ter of attraction, the Stanford pub
lic can well turn to the events of
the field and cinder-path. In a
rough way, to-morrow's meet will
afford a preliminary survey o the
new material that has entered col
lege this year, and also give an idea
of the Varsity material left from last
year's point-winners. The meet
promises to be of unusual interest,
and no one ought to miss it. The
contestants can do better work if
there is a large crowd on the
bleachers, and for that additional
reason everyone should turn out.
