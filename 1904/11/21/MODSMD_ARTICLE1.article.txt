# SATURDAY'S FIELD MEET.
## Showing Made by Freshman Track Athletes Is Very En-Encouraging. 
### 
< Saturday morning's scratch field
tlay'wasa very satisfactory event
in the evidence it gave of a wealth
of good track material, especially
among the Freshman class. The
first-year men had no difficulty in
vfirnVlng the meet, with many
pointb to spare. The points for
each class were as follows: '08,
'05, 574; '07, 31; '06, 10. No
handicaps being allowed, five places
were given, the first counting five,
thfe'second four, and so on down.
Th 6 track was rather heavy as a
result of the recent rains and con
sequently the times were not fast,
but they were still very creditable
for this period of the season. The
improvement that will come with
longer training and coaching
promises to result in a very strong
team.
The most interesting features of
Saturday's meet were the work of
two Freshmen, Horton and Miller,
in the shot-put, and the half-mile
and mile respectively, and the mak
ing of a new Stanford record in the
hammer-throw by Crawford. Hor
ton, who has been playing football
and who has done little with the
shot, put the 16-pound ball 41 feet
6 inches, which is a remarkable put
under the circumstances. With
coaching and practice he should
prove himself a worthy successor to
Hyde, who made a new Coast inter
collegiate record in the last inter
collegiate field day. Horton comes
from Ukiah.
Crawford's throw of 143 feet 6
inches with the hammer is not an
unusual distance with him, but it is
the first time he has done it in com
petition. Last season, in practice,
lie was throwing close to 150 feet,
but in the intercollegiate meet, ow
ing to the wet ground and other
conditions, the best he could do
was 135 feet 7i£ inches. If Horton
and Crawford continue to develope
their good form it is evident that
Sperry of California will have as
difficult a task this year as he had
last, when he failed to realize the
hopes of his college that he would
take first place in the weights.
Crawford's latest throw displaces
his record of 137 feet inches,
made in the intercollegiate meet
two years ago as the Stanford re
cord.
The work of Miller in the mile
and half-mile indicated that the
reputation that he brings from his
high school has been well earned.
He took the two eventß without the
least exertion, ran the quarter, and
finally did a fast 220-yards in a re
lay. He is big and heavily boned,
and has a stride that covers a long
stretch of ground without apparent
effort.
The sprints were slow and unin
teresting. Cope, the San Francisco
Freshman, of whom much is ex
pected, did not enter because of a
weak ankle, and Wood, '07, who
showed up well while he was on the
track last year, was also out of this
meet. The 440-yard event went to
P. M. Davis, '08, who ran a very
pretty race.
In the high hurdles Thomas, '08,

showed up well, second to Lanagan,
'05. In the low hurdles Lanagan
and Macfarland, '07, ran such an
even race that the judges called it
a tie, although Lanagan was clearly
a little ahead at the tape.
In the high and broad jumps
many men showed up well consider
ing the small amount of practice
they have had. Captain Bell, '05,
took both firsts. A new man who
did good work was Macdonald, '07,
who covered 20 feet 5½ inches in the
broad, and 5 feet 6 inches in the
high, despite a very awkard style.
Macdonald won his heat in the 220
sprint, and later made second place
in the final. Summaries:

promises to result in a very strong
team.
The most interesting features of
Saturday's meet were the work of
two Freshmen, Horton and Miller,
in the shot-put, and the half-mile
and mile respectively, and the mak
ing of a new Stanford record in the
hammer-throw by Crawford. Hor
ton, who has been playing football
and who has done little with the
shot, put the 16-pound ball 41 feet
6 inches, which is a remarkable put
under the circumstances. With
coaching and practice he should
prove himself a worthy successor to
Hyde, who made a new Coast inter
collegiate record in the last inter
collegiate field day. Horton comes
from Ukiah.
Crawford's throw of 143 feet 6
inches with the hammer is not an
unusual distance with him, but it is
the first time he has done it in com
petition. Last season, in practice,
lie was throwing close to 150 feet,
but in the intercollegiate meet, ow
ing to the wet ground and other
conditions, the best he could do
was 135 feet 7i£ inches. If Horton
and Crawford continue to develope
their good form it is evident that
Sperry of California will have as
difficult a task this year as he had
last, when he failed to realize the
hopes of his college that he would
take first place in the weights.
Crawford's latest throw displaces
his record of 137 feet inches,
made in the intercollegiate meet
two years ago as the Stanford re
cord.
The work of Miller in the mile
and half-mile indicated that the
reputation that he brings from his
high school has been well earned.
He took the two eventß without the
least exertion, ran the quarter, and
finally did a fast 220-yards in a re
lay. He is big and heavily boned,
and has a stride that covers a long
stretch of ground without apparent
effort.
The sprints were slow and unin
teresting. Cope, the San Francisco
Freshman, of whom much is ex
pected, did not enter because of a
weak ankle, and Wood, '07, who
showed up well while he was on the
track last year, was also out of this
meet. The 440-yard event went to
P. M. Davis, '08, who ran a very
pretty race.
In the high hurdles Thomas, '08,

showed up well, second to Lanagan,
'05. In the low hurdles Lanagan
and Macfarland, '07, ran such an
even race that the judges called it
a tie, although Lanagan was clearly
a little ahead at the tape.
In the high and broad jumps
many men showed up well consider
ing the small amount of practice
they have had. Captain Bell, '05,
took both firsts. A new man who
did good work was Macdonald, '07,
who covered 20 feet 5½ inches in the
broad, and 5 feet 6 inches in the
high, despite a very awkard style.
Macdonald won his heat in the 220
sprint, and later made second place
in the final. Summaries:
100 yards —Luce, '05, won, Gartz
mann, '08, second, Ross, '08, third,
Aynesworth, '08, fourth, Howe, '07,

using Herbert, '08, West, '06, Miller,
'08, and Singletary, '06.
< Saturday morning's scratch field
tlay'wasa very satisfactory event
in the evidence it gave of a wealth
of good track material, especially
among the Freshman class. The
first-year men had no difficulty in
vfirnVlng the meet, with many
pointb to spare. The points for
each class were as follows: '08,
'05, 574; '07, 31; '06, 10. No
handicaps being allowed, five places
were given, the first counting five,
thfe'second four, and so on down.
Th 6 track was rather heavy as a
result of the recent rains and con
sequently the times were not fast,
but they were still very creditable
for this period of the season. The
improvement that will come with
longer training and coaching
promises to result in a very strong
team.
