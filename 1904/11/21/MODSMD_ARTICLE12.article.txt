Saturday's track meet was a
most decided success. It was held
for the purpose of discovering how
much material and what kind of
material is in the Freshman class,
and that purpose it accomplished.
Therejs no class in the University
that we would rather see carry off
the greatest number of points than
the classof 1908. This view is not
taken because we think the Fresh
man class is more deserving than
any other class, but because a first
year class, strong in track athletes,
means that the Varsity team will
be greatly strengthened for four
annual intercollegiate field meets
to come. All the Freshmen ath
letes gave sufficient evidence Satur
day that they can live up to the
reputations that came to college
with them from preparatory
schools, and some of them who
had no particular reputations to
maintain surprised track enthusi
asts by their remarkable work. The
performances of the men Saturday
should be cause for unusual inter
est in the season of training which
will begin with the opening of col
lege in the spring.
