# MEMORIAL CHURCH SERVICE.
## Rev. Dr. Gardner Preaches on the Subject, "The Fatherhood of God." 
### 
The Rev. Dr. Gardner preached
in Memorial Church Sunday morn
ing on the Hubject. "The Father
hood of God." He said in part:
"True religion is bound up with
man's idea of God. No one will
deny the profound influence of the
idea in the evolution of the race
and of religion. Man's idea of God
has gone through various stages of
development. We see it struggling
to the light through the intellectual
darkness and the spiritual fear of
barbaric life. We see it gradually
refined from the coarse supersti
tions of polytheism, the belief in
many Gods, into the pure monothe
ism of later Judaism, then, like a
flash of sunlight, came the spirit
ual and tender revelation in Christ
of the fatherhood of God.
"Belief in God is the fundamen
tal concept of religion, the one ar
ticle of faith which satisfies the
religious instincts of humanity. It
is this belief which makes us one.
"Whatever the difficulties in the
way of our belief in God, and they
are many, we know that the human
soul in its better moments feels the
need of God. Man's deepest need
is for God, whose other name is
Love. But you say: the term
"Father" is simply used to human
ize and symbolize the idea of God.
That does not alter the nature or
attributes of God. Faith speaks in
the language of the world of sense
to express the ideas of another
world, the world unseen and spirit
ual. But only as we rise above the
symbolism or the representative
form can we grasp the reality which
they 'half reveal and half conceal.'
The word father is valuable as a
symbol, it is doubly valuable and
dear in spiritual experience. And
may I ask, are you satisfied, is
your soul satisfied, to think of God
as the impersonal Creator, the great
First cause behind phenomena?
Does not your heart yearn for some
more intimate, more real more per
sonal idea, of God? I want to feel
that God is more than cold, blind,
unchanging Law of Force. 1 want
to feel that He is a being capable
of love, one who can pity and for
give, one who can feel the pain and
understand the sorrow of our hu
man life. For the thoughtful
Christian there are two divinebooks:
Nature and Revelation. God in
His goodness has not left himself
without witness. Science is day
by day disclosing the power of God
as seen in the laws and forces of
nature, and revelation supplements
the findings of science by proclaim
ing the Fatherhood of God."
Dr. Gardner then entered into an
interesting discussion of the per
sonal Bide of God, as characterized
in our expression of Father.
