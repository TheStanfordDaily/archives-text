# PRESENTATION OF "HAMLET."
## Production by the Ben Greet Company Saturday a Marked Success. 
### 
The presentation of "Hamlet" in
the Assembly Hall on Saturday af-1
ternoon and evening proved to be, I
as was anticipated, an event of the j
first importance from the dramatic
or literary standpoint. While not
a few of the audience may have
seen greater actors in "Hamlet"
than any who played in it here, it
is almost never that there has been
such opportunity to see the playpre
sented as Shakspere wrote it, and —
so far as stage setting is concerned —
somewhat as it was presented in
his time.
Mr. Greet's company has been
distinguished all along for skill and
good taste in the management of
the details of stage presentation, as
shown by costume, by the use made
of very few " properties," and by
simplicity in the action, without
the conventional posings and shift
ings of ordinary professional actors.
These points of excellence were as
noticeable in " Hamlet" as in the
previous plays. The satisfactory
results obtained without the use of
scenery could nowhere be better
illustrated than in such a scene as
that of the grave-diggers, where two
skulls and a pick-axe served all the
purposes of scenery and properties.
The presentation of the play within
a play was managed with no less
skill, and the ghost was a most
impressive triumph in the art of
making-up."
The naturalness of manner in de
livery of their lines, which is also
characteristic of this company, was
again noticeable. Unfortunately
it is difficult to secure this more
conversational style without some
indistinctness of enunciation, and
this was present to an extent which
would have considerably marred
the enjoyment of the audience, in
a play whose lines were less famil
iar than those of "Hamlet." The
character of the king in this respect
presented a marked contrast to the
others, the delivery of the lines be
ing both distinct and Impressive,
but accompanied by the conven
tional mannerisms of the profess
ional. In this particular—distinct
ness of utterance, without unnat
ural staginess of manner—the stu
dent actors succeeded really better
than those of the company; and
there was no reason ito be dissatis
fied with the work of the Stanford
men in the play. Mr. Bonnell
again distinguished himself in the
interpretation of his lines, the work
of Miss A. M. Hayes and of I). D.
Sales was vei'y £Apd, and the comic
work of E. V. Henley was also
noteworthy.
The part of Hamlet himself, as
interpreted by Mr. Greet, was made
highly individual, and is likely to
awaken more difference of appreci
ation than any of ihe others. In
general it was marked by great
simplicity, quite in accord with the
ideal of the entire presentation.
Mr. Greet seems by nature to be
a distinctively comic actor, and the
lighter satiric elements in Hamlet's
philosophy, as well as the comic
side of his assumed madness, have
perhaps, rarely been more ade

quately presented. But in the
more serious scenes, where the ele
ments cf profound dignity and
beauty seem to be required by the
text, Mr. Greet seemed hardly to
rise to the occasion; and his very
make-up kept the audience con
stantly toned down to the comic
level. The result was that the to
tal effect of the play was probably
much nearer that of a comedy than
it has been in any standard modern
interpretation. It is probable that
this* however, was true of the Eliza
bethan presentation; and in one or
two of the soliloquy scenes, as well
as that of Hamlet's first meeting
with the ghost, the tragic atmos
phere was well maintained. More
over, little could be asked of the
Ophelia scene which was not
brought out by the admirable taste
of Mrs. Crawley.
On the whole the presentation
will be remembered by most of
those who heard it as a revelation
of the unity and beauty of the play,
without the usual artifical sources
of stage interest, such as could have
been obtained in no other way. No
actor can interpret all phases of
Hamlet, each reader must supply
the full character for himself.
For the presentation of the play
in the Elizabethan manner it was
very gratifying that the old-style
stage built by the English Club
could be used once again, and so
effectivel v.
