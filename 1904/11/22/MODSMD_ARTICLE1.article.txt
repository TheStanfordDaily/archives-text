Dr. Jordan delivered a short ad
dress to the meeting on the future
of graduate work at the University.
He said that he hoped to make the
Stanford ideas of graduate work
a combination of all that is best in
the systems of advanced study and
research at Cornell and Johns Hop
kins universities. He emphasized
the importance of modern appara
tus in the higher branches of study
and said that the University hoped,
when the buildings now in course
of construction were completed and
more funds were at the disposal of
the departments, to do everything
possible to encourage graduate stu
dents to come to the University.
He did not consider that the sys
tem of granting fellowships to grad
uate students was the best means
of accomplishing this end, but
rather that the money which would
thus be used should be devoted to
placing all possible facilities in the
hands of those desiring to follow
advanced lines of study. Bv this
means the standard of graduate
work at Stanford will be raised to
such a high level that students will
be attracted to the University.
