The first attempt at fall haeeball
practice will be made to-morrow,
when the candidates for the in
tercollegiate Freshman baseball
nine will play the Faculty team.
The fact that the intercollegiate
first-year games will be initiated
this year makes a position on the
class team mean more than it ever
has before. To be a player on this
team, the first Freshman nine to
meet California in baseball, is an
honor that will be highly regarded,
and one that ought to be an incen
tive great enough to bring out every
Freshman in college who has had
previous baseball experience. Fol
lowing the two victories in football
we want to see the Freshmen con
tinue the series by winning the next
intercollegiate athletic event. The
California freshmen have a con
siderable start in the matter of
practice, but with faithful work
from now on our Freshmen ought
to be able to overcome the handi
cap. In to-morrow's game there
will be an opportunity for all the
candidates to get in the play, and
every Freshman should be urged to
turn out.
