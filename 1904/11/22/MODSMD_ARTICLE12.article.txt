# Thanksgiving "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The special Thanksgiving num
ber of the Chaparral will he on sale
on the quad to-morrow. The issue
will hp published in the new style
adopted with the last issue, on
heavy plate paper, with the cover
in yellow, making it a particularly
attractive issue. A special feature
of the number is the art work,
which bears chiefly on the results
of the big game. The final drawing
of the California bear series is pub
lished in a full-page drawing by II
\V. Borough, '04. Other artists who
contribute are M. Oppenheim, '05,
Miss C. Lathrop, ex-'O6, Paul Tarpy
and Bristow Adams.
