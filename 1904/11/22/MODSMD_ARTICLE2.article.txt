# Papers by Faculty Members.
## 
### 
The President's office yesterday
posted a list of papers published by
members of the University faculty
from July 1, 1903 to July 1, 1904.
The list is a long one, including
some ninety papers, by more than
forty members of the faculty staff.
The name of the magazine publish
ing the article and the time of pub
lication are given with each refer
ence. The list as it now stands is
probably incorrect and incomplete
in some ways, and corrections and
alterations are desired. All cor
rections must be reported at the
President's office before Saturday,
November 27th, the full title and
reference being given in each case.
The primary object of securing this
data is merely to preserve it in the
Library as a record; but if a com
plete, correct list is secured it will be
published in the President's report.
