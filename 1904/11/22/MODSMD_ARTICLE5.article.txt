# Freshmen to Play.
## 
### 
The first baseball practice and
game for the Freshmen will take
place to-morrow afternoon, when
the first-year class will play the
faculty nine. The game will be
played on the faculty diamond at 3.
The contest with the faculty is
the first step that has been taken
toward developing a Freshman
team to play California next
spring. The game between the
first-year teams of the two univer
sities will be played on the Stan
ford campus probably during the
latter part of February or early in
March.
Professors Searles and Whitaker
have the game in charge, and all
Freshmen who turn out will prob
ably be given a chance to play.
The match will be in the nature of
a try-out to get some idea of the
men available for next season.
There are a number of Freshmen
in college with good preparatory
school records, and the prospects for
a strong team are fair.
