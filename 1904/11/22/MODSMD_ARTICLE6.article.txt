# Women's League Meeting.
## 
### 
The executive committee of the
Women's League met this afternoon
and made arrangements for the
final meeting of this semester. The
date has been set for Friday, De
cember 2d, and, contrary to custom,
it has been decided to hold this
meeting in the evening. With the
aim in view of having this gather
ing entirely different from any of
the preceding ones, the committee
secured permission to use the main
room of the University Inn for the
occasion. Instead of the usual

formal reception, the entertainment
committee, of which Miss Julia
Boynton, '06 is chairman, has pro
vided a most interesting and enter
taining program. There are to be
several numbers, contributed by
the various sororities and by the
girls from lioble and Madrono.
The guests will be received by a
committee composed of faculty
women and league members.
At the conclusion of the program
a committee, of which Miss Hazel
Pedlar, '06, is chairman, will serve
refreshments to the guests, in the
two Binall rooms off the main hall.
Miss Mary Betz, '06, and Miss Flor
ence Grace, '06, were appointed to
take charge of a decorating com
mittee.
It is the aim of the league to in
terest all the women in the Uni
versity in the work of the league,
and thus make it more strongly
felt in college activities. To many
the league merely exists for the
monthly receptions which have been
held, but its influence and effect
may be noted in several instances.
Through its influence and efforts
the rest-room on the quad has been
entirely renovated and comfortably
refurnished, and the committee is
still spending money for its further
equipment. The treasurer of the
league will keep office hours in the
rest-room on three days of next
week, and any who have not paid
their league dues will be given an
opportunity to do so.
