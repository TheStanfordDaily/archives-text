# CARNOT DEBATE REGULATIONS
## Same Rules to Govern the Contest This Year as Last. 
### 
The faculty committees on de
bating at Stanford and the Univer
sity of California have agreed upon
the regulations which shall govern
the Carnot debate this year. Two
years ago a system was inaugu
rated which practically made the
debate an impromptu affair. The
specific question for debate was an
nounced one hour before the con
test and each contestant was al
lowed to choose the side which he
wished to defend. Fifteen minutes
was allotted each man, and he had
the privilege of dividing this time
into two speeches as he chose.
Last year several alterations were
made in the regulations: The time
for preparation on the specific
question was extended from one to
two hours, the question being an
nounced at 6 o'clock on the even
ing of the debate. A limitation
was also placed on the matter of
division of time. While each
speaker was still allowed fifteen
minutes for hin two speeches as be
fore, an additional qualification was
made that the time should be so
divided that no speech would be of
less than four minutes' duration.
The changes made in 1902, which
introduced the policy of extempor
aneous speaking, and also the minor
alterations made last year, have
proved uniformly successful. When
the debating committees of the two
universities met this year, they de
cided that no amendment to last
year's regulations was necessary;
and so the debate will be conducted
on the same lines as was last year's.
Since the debate was held at
California last year, this year's con
test will take place at Stanford, on
the evening of February 3, 1905.
The question, as announced several
days ago, will be "The Relation of
Church and State in France since
1801."
The following are the regulations
in full:
1. The general topic for each
year's discussion shall be chosen
and published before November
15th.
2. The specific question for each
debate shall be announced on the
evening of the debate (the first Fri
day in February) at 6 p.m.
3. Thereupon, each of the six
contestants shall make his own
choice of the side he wishe√ü to ad
vocate. But if it shall appear that
all the representatives of one uni
versity have chosen the same side,
one of them, selected by lot, shall
be required to speak on the oppo
site side. The order in which the
contestants shall speak Bhall then
be determined by lot.
4. Each speaker shall be allowed
fifteen minutes in the debate. He
must use at least four minutes of
this time for his opening speech,
and at least four minutes for his
second or rebuttal speech.
