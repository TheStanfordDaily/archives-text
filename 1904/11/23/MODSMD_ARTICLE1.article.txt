# STANFORD VS. COLORADO.
## Stanford Will Play Strong Eleven at Denver To-morrow.—Line-Up of Teams. 
### 
The Stanford football team ar
rived at Denver yesterday morning
and now has headquarters at the
Park Hotel in that city. With the
exception of the weariness incident
to their long trip,the Stanford play
ers are in excellent physical condi
tion.
The game to be played to-morrow
is attracting wide attention in Colo
rado, where it is conceded to be the
most important football contest of
the year. By defeating the Uni
versity of Nebraska 6 to 0 Colorado
has proven that it has one of the
best teams in the Middle West, and
as Stanford is admittedly the
strongest eleven on the Pacific
Coast, the contest to-morrow ought
to give a good opportunity for a
comparison of Western and Coast
football. However, the team which
will represent Stanford in the Colo
rado game is not as strong as the
eleven which defeated California.
Defensively it is probably equal to
the eleven which faced California
on the 12th of this month, but on
the offense it is at least one, and
possibly two, touch downs weaker
than that team. Horton is a
strong tackle, but he can not
hope to open holes in the opposing
line as Sprott did in the intercol
legiate match. Stanford is three
pounds to the man heavier than
Colorado. It is said that the Colo
rado team executes its plays much
faster than the Stanford eleven.
The change of altitude will be a
distinct hardship to the Stanford
eleven, which has been accustomed
to play at an elevation but slight
ly above sea-level. As in the Cali
fornia game, Stanford will rely on
straight football to gain her yards,
but it is expected that the mass
plays developed by the Cardinal
team will prove a surprise to the
Colorado players.
Probably the best man on the
Colorado team is Karnop at right
guard. He has played on several
Middle West elevens. Owens, cap
tain and quarter-back, has been
recently injured, and it is not ex
pected that he will be able to last
through the game. Left-half-back
Caley does the punting for the
team, and his kicks will average
50 yards.
The line-up will be as follows:
STANFORD COLORADO
Clark (c) 1 e r. . ..Christensen
Horton 1 t r Coffin
Thompson..., 1g r Karnop
Hyde c Brusse
Van Sickle... .r g 1 Roller

Substitutes —Stanford: Stott for
quarter-back; Haselwood for guard;
Butterfield for end; S. B. Thomp
son for tackle; Crow for half- or
full-back. Colorado: Thomas for
full-back; Cavanaugh and Johnson
for ends; Thatcher for half-back;
Jordan for guard; Mauff for quar
