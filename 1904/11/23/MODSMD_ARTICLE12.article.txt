The announcement of the cast
which will present the Sophomore
play introduces the names of a
number of student actors who have
hitherto been unknown to the Stan
ford stage. That there are so many
new players now entering college
dramatics is very encouraging, and
if they possess ability necessary to
a successful production of "The
Rivals," there ought to be no fear of
scarcity of material for the numer
ous local attractions which will
take place next semester. The dis
covery of this new material may be
attributed to the system under
which the cast was selected. The
players have been chosen by a series
of try-outs in which there was close
competition. If we can rely upon
reports of the work, this method of
selection has operated admirably
well, and we see no reason why it
could not be applied advantage
ously to the selection of casts for
all the plays and farces given.
The competition system brings out
more talent, creates greater interest,
and secures better players than
does the customary method of se
lection. It is to be hoped that the
system now started will be put into
use in the future.
