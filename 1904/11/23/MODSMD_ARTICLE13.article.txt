# Thanksgiving "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The Thanksgiving number of the
Chaparral appeared this morning.
There is some good material in it,
notably Mr. Drooley'a discussion of
"English Ate"; and the expression
of sentiment in favor of a football
show instead of the annual torture
of a melodrama or bad comedy
will no doubt find a strong re-echo \
among the student body. Paul
Terry and R. \V. Borough, '04, 1
have again collaborated in turning
out an excellent cartoon on the re
sult of the intercollegiate football
game. Terry has the ability to
draw a bear whose woeful faoial
expressions are wonderfully funny.
M. Oppenheim, '05,a150 contributes
some amusing sketches.
