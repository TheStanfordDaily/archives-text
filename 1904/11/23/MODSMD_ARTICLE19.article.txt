# DR. JORDAN LECTURES.
## Second of Series of Addresses on Scientific Nomenclature. 
### 
The second of the series of lec
tures by Dr. Jordan on "Nomencla
ture," dealt with various phases of
its history since 1758 when Lin
naeus' u Syste%na Natura" was pub
lished. In this summary account
of the animals and plants then
known, the so-called binomial
nomenclature, which is still in use
in Biology, was introduced. It is
curious to learn that it did not oc
cur to Linnaeus, in enumerating
the things he had done for Botany,
to mention the binomial nomen
clature, perhaps his most lasting
contribution to the biological sci
ences.
After the adoption of the binomi
al system, the methods of deciding
upon what name a species should
have were still so varied as to re
sult in general confusion. There
was little uniformity in this usage
of various schools of biologists in
the matter of choosing among the
numerous names which were
ascribed to the same form by dif
ferent observers. Thus in some in
stances the preference might be
given to the name used by the most
noted of several would-be name
givers, to the name which the
species in question bore on the
labels of the greatest museums, to
the name used by the majority of
authors, or to the priority of a par
ticular name among the many.
Every subsequent change of a name
once given was, of course, a source
of confusion.
A large step in the direction of
uniformity in the matter of the
naming of species was taken by a
committee of the meeting of the
British Association for the Ad
vancement of Science in 1842. This
committee,consistingof Strickland,
Darwin, Henslow, Jennings, Sir
John Richardson, Owen, West
wood and others, formulated the
code of nomenclature called the
"Strickland Code," or the "British
Association Code." This code
recognized the principle which be
longs to all effective subsequent
codes, namely, that fixity of name,
not individual choice, is the only
efficient working ideal, for as Dr.
Jordan said, "All progress in no
menclature has been brought about
through the elimination of choice."
The "Strickland Code" deter
mined upon the "Law of Priority"
in the naming of species, thus set
tling this question on a democratic
basis. This code also established
rules which have remained perma
nent for the capitalization of scien
tific names.
Some of the canons of the
"A. O. U. code," formulated by a
committee of the American Orni
thologists Union, were then dis
cussed with a view to pointing out
their efficiency or their defects.
The general conclusion was that
this code is an improvement on the
Strickland code in four particulars:
(1) In precision of rulings; (2) in
using the 10th edition of Systema
Natura (the first edition in which
binomials were used); (3) in not re
fusing to duplicate in Zoology the
generic names used in Botany; (4)
in introducing trinomials for geo
graphic sub-species.
Among the specific rulings of the
A. 0. U. code two may be worth
while mentioning as being of gen
eral interest. One, "names must
l>e Latin or Latinized," resulted in

making the scientific world write a
common language, eliminating the
names from the furthermost corners
and languages of the earth which
had hitherto made scientific nomen
clature uncomfortably cosmopol
itan. Another ruling stated that
the scientific name of a species
need not he applicable or appro
priate,thus giving the systematist a
wider range of choice among names.
If a particularly appropriate name
can be given the species, well and
good; but inappropriate names
once given must stand in science
just as they do among persons,
where a Liliputian may he called
Mr. Long, or a blacksmith Mr.
Goldsmith.
