# New Art Building.
## 
### 
The new building on the outer
quadrangle to the north of Memor
ial Church, which is nearly com
pleted, is to be made the head
quarters of the Art department.
When the new building is fur
nished the Art department will be
moved from its present location
near the Bookstore to its new quar
ters in the modernly equipped
building. The structure is ar

ranged with a view to good light
effects, and is divided into three
large ground-floor rooms with one
smaller half-story room.
The new outer-quad building to
the south of Memorial Church was
completed a few days ago, and will
be fitted up and used as draught
ing quarters for the Mechanical
Engineering department.
