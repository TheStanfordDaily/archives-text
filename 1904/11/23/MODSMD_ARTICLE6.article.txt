C. Mansfield. For Sir Lucius
O'Trigger also there will be an
other try-out, between J. F. Bren
nan and L. T. Ryone. There are
two or three minor, characters
which are yet to be selected. It is
expected that the cast will be com
plete by Monday, and that regular

This is the first class play, aside
from the Junior farces, in which
the characters will all be selected
from members of the class. Anoth
er innovation is the system of hold
ing regular try-outs for places, to
insure the best results. In the
present try-out there was an average
of four candidates for each position.
Each candidate had to commit the
lines for his position before enter
ing the contest. This is found to
be the most satisfactory method
yet tried for choosing the cast, as
it gives all who wish a chance, and
besides facilitates the familiarizing
of the cast with the play.
"The Rivals" will be given early
next semester.
