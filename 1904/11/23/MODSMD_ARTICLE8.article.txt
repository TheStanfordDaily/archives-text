# FRESHMEN DEFEAT FACULTY.
## First-Year Baseball Players Win Their First Game by Score of 8 to 7. 
### 
The Freshmen succeded in de
feating the Faculty team this after
noon by the score of 8 to 7, after
seven innings of closely contested
baseball.
The Freshmen failed to score in
the first inning, but in the second,
third and fourth innings, by hard
hitting and the errors of their op
ponents, they succeeded in making
a total of eight rune, while the
Faculty made but two. In the
fifth inning the Faculty added five
runs to their score, the Freshmen
playing poor ball. After the fifth
inning both sides failed to score.
The game was full of errors and
characterized by ragged playing on
both sides, most of the rune being
scored on errors. The poor play
ing at times by the first-year men
may be largely attributed to the
fact that each man was in the
game for only two innings, and
that they had never played to
gether before. Many of the men
showed up very well, however, and
there seems to be a wealth of good
material from which a team may
be picked to play California.
No good idea of the merits of the
different players can be gathered
from this afternoon's contest, but
the fact that at least thirty-five
turned out indicates that competi
tion for the different places will be
spirited. There should be no
trouble in forming two strong teams
to play against each other.
In the game to-day many of the
players fielded well, and some gave
promise of being good hitters. The
last quality will undoubtedly large
ly determine the final selection of
the men.
Following is the line-up of the
Faculty: Whitaker, pitcher; Searles,
catcher; Millis, first base; Adams,
second base; Fish, third baee;
