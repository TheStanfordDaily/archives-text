# VICTORY CLOSES SEASON.
## Stanford Wins from University of Colorado by Score of 33 to 0. 
### 
Before a crowd of ten thousand
spectators the Stanford Varsity de
feated the University of Colorado
football team at Denver by the
score of 33 to 0 last Thursday af
ternoon. The Cardinal eleven not
only outplayed Colorado, but
showed superior physical condition.
At only one stage of tlie game was
the Stanford goal threatened, but
the Colorado offense managed to
make substantial gains at other
periods during the progress of the
game. Several players were in
jured on each team. Van Sickle
suffered the most severe injury,
sustaining a fractured arm in a
fierce scrimmage. The game was
remarkably clean, and the best of
spirit was shown by the rooters as
well as by both teams. A special
section was reserved for Stanford
supporters, and almost a thousand
enthusiasts cheered for the Cardi
nal team throughout the game.
The Colorado team found the
split buck played by Stanford ab
solutely insoluble, and the Cardi
nal eleven used it for repeated
gains through the opposing line.
The most spectacular play of the
game was made by Weller, who
ran 60 yards to a touch-down after
securing the ball on a fumble.
Five touch-downs and one drop
kick for a field-goal were scored by
Stanford. Weller made two touch
downs, Trowbridge two, and Dole
one besides the field-goal from the
35-yard line. Many costly fum
bles were made by both teams, but
Colorado suffered more on this ac
count than Stanford. The high
altitude did not perceptibly affect
the Stanford players until near the
close of the game when the efforts
of the team noticeably weakened.
The first touch-down was made
after 11 minutes of play. The ball
was kicked off to Colorado. A ser
ies of line plunges, and a 30-yard
end run by Roberts advanced the
ball to Stanford's 31-yard line,
where it was lost on downs. After
losing the ball once on a fumble
Stanford took the ball from Col
orado, and advanced it 51 yards to
a touch-down. Trowbridge kicked
an easy goal. The next touch
down was made on a 60-yard run
by Weller after the ball had been
in the possession of each team near
the middle of the field. The Stan
ford full-back got the ball on a
fumble, and after shaking off sev
eral tackles fell on the ball back of
the goal-line. Trowbridge again
kicked the goal, and the score
stood 12 to 0. Stanford kicked off
to Colorado, and unable to gain
the Boulder team punted. The
punt was blocked by Hyde, and af
ter several short bucks Trowbridge
was sent over the line for the third
touch-down. Dole kicked the goal.
After bucking the ball half the
length of the field Weller went
over the goal-line for a touch-down
which Dole failed to convert into a
goal.
In the second half Colorado
started off strong, advancing the
ball from the kick-off to Stanford's
18-yard line. A penalty and the

stubborn defense of the Stanford
line gave the ball to the Cardinal
team. It was advanced to Col
orado's 35-yard line where Dole
made a beautiful drop-kick, lifting
the ball squarely between the goal
posts, and making the score 27 to
0. Within the five minute limit
Dole made the last touchdown,
leaving the final score 33 to 0.
