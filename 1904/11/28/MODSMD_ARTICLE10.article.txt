Of the several questions which
will be decided at the meeting of
the intercollegiate athletic com
mittees of Stanford and California
in January, the graduate coach
system adopted four years ago will
he the most important. Judging
from the variance in the prevailing
sentiments at the two universities
it may he expected that this mat
ter will he the cause for heated
debate. The system was inaugu
rated in order to do away with the
heavy expense incurred by hiring
Eastern coaches, and, furthermore,
to assist in removing from intercol
legiate football all color of profes
sionalism. It cannot be argued
that the graduate system has not
in a great measure accomplished
its purposes. The question as to
whether the quality of football
that has been played during the
past four years is as good as that
played under the former system
will no doubt enter into the debate.
As far as Stanford is concerned, we
believe that it is the general opinion
that the football played by the
Cardinal team during the last two
years has been as good or better
than it would have been under an
eastern coach. It has been at least
as good as any football coach pro
duced under the old system, and
we have every reason to believe that
it will continue to be so, for as long
as J. F. Lanagan can be secured as
head coach the football played by
Stanford is going to be the best that
the available material iscapableof.
The present agreement cannot be
altered without the consent of
both intercollegiate committees,
and as Stanford has nothing what
ever to gain by a change it would
seem that her representatives ought
not give their sanction to any altera
tion in the regulations governing
graduate coaching.
