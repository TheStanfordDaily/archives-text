# Work on Gymnasium Building.
## 
### 
Work on the new Gymnasium
building is progressing very satis
factorily, and there is every indica
tion that next September will find
the building completed. The ex
terior stone work on the rear and
sides is now finished, and in the
front the side wings are also com
pleted. Only the central wing
stands uncompleted. This has
been delayed through difficulty in
procuring the heavy "lintel" and
other large block stones necessary.
Active work has been begun in the
placing of the roof, which will be
finished in red tile. With the com
pletion of the roof, about next Jan
uary, contracts for the interior work
will be awarded.
Masons are at work building a
heavy stone retaining wall, which
is to extend along the sides and
rear of the building. A broad side
walk will join this wall and the ex
terior walls of the Gymnasium.
