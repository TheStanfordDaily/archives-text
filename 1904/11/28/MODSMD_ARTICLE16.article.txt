# HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.
## Pacific Coast Branch of Organization Holds Session in San Francisco. 
### 
At the meeting of the Pacific
Coast branch of the American His
torical Association held in San
Francisco,on Friday and Saturday,
a number of Stanford professors
took an active part. The meeting
was held in the art gallery of the
Mechanic's Pavilion, the first ses
sion being held on Friday evening.
The speakers at this session were
James D. Phelan, President Benja
min Ide Wheeler of California, F.
J. Symes and Professor Nathan Ab
bott of Stanford. Professor Abbott's
subject was"The Saxon and the
Latin in California." The aim of
his talk was to show how Spanish
civil law, the Spanish language,and
the idea of a state church was over
come by Saxon law, the English
language, and the theory of separa
tion of the church from the state in
California. He said that this was
accomplished in a period of about
five years, and was done by sheer
force of numbers rather than by the
intrinsic merit of the institutions
substituted.
At the Saturday morning session
Dr. Max Farrand was one of the
speakers. A luncheon was held at
1 o'clock at the Occidental Hotel
which was attended by about sixty
â€¢people. Informal talks and toasts
were given, Professor Duniway be
ing one of the speakers.
The most interesting thing of the
evening session was the presenta
tion and passing of resolutions
requesting the Postmaster - Gen
eral to restore the historical
names to the post offices in the
state. Among the names presented
was that of Palo Alto, which is
spelled by the post-office depart
ment as one word, with but one
capital letter.
