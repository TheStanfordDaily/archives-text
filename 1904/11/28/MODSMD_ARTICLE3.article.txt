# Freshmen Play Baseball.
## 
### 
During the Thanksgiving recess
the Freshmen played two games of
baseball, the first taking place on
Thursday morning and the second
on Saturday afternoon. The oppon
ents of the Freshmen were mainly
made up of second team players of
last season.
The first game was more in the
nature of a practice, a number of
men being given a chance at the
different positions, and no score be
ing kept. On Saturday the game
was of more interest, and though
the Freshmen played good ball they
were defeated 19 to 7.
The second game showed that
though there are an unusual num
ber of Freshman baseball players
there are few that stand out as su
perior to the rest. A large number
of men are trying for each position.
Owing to the fact that there are
but four Varsity baseball men now
in college the new men are being
watched with a view to new material
for the first team.
