# INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS.
## Agreement Between Stanford and California Will Come Up for Discussion in January. 
### 
The agreement between Stanford
and the University of California,by
which only graduate coaches are to
be employed by the universities,ex
pires on December 31st. The inter
collegiate committee, which is com
posed of three men from each insti
tution, will meet at the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco some time in Jan
uary and decide whether the rule
requiring graduate coaches shall be
renewed, or whether eastern men
may be secured to coach the Var
sity football men.
The part of the intercollegiate
athletic agreement between the two
universities which will be discussed
at the next meeting of the athletic
committee reads as follows:
"Sec. I,—After nineteen hundred
the head football coach of each uni
versity shall be a graduate of the
university at which the coaching is
done (providing that he has at
tended the university from which
he graduated at least two years) or
shall have attended the university
for four full years (it being under
stood that leaves of absence shall
be counted as attendance at the uni
versity if they do not aggregate
more than one semester). He shall
not receive any salary, but may
have all his expenses paid. Ex
penses include loss of salary, or loss
of ordinary business, during the
time of coaching."
The decisive defeat of the Cali
fornia football team in the last in
tercollegiate game has caused much
talk at California of abandoning
the plan of having graduate coaches
for the team and securing profes
sional coaches from the East for
next season. One reason at least
for having a new agreement drawn
up between the two universities is
the fact that the present athletic
agreement has been amended sev
eral times and it seems advisable
to have a new contract containing
all the amendments.
At California this year James
Hopper coached the team, giving
up his personal business at a great
sacrifice, and as it is practically
impossible for many men to make
such a sacrifice as he did, the Blue
and Gold will have some trouble in
securing competent coaches if the
graduate coach rule is renewed.
Coaching the eleven takes three
months of hard work and since by
the agreement the coach receives
only his expenses, the question of
pecuring good coaches is very diffi
cult.
Another question that will come
up before the representatives from
the two universities in January is
the rule limiting athletes taking
part in the intercollegiate contests
to four years. There seems to be
no doubt that this part of the
agreement will be renewed.
The question of campus games
will also come up at this meeting,
and as the last game was such a
great success the game will un
doubtedly be played here next
year.
