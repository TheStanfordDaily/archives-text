# CHALLENGE FROM JAPAN
## Japanese College Team Wants to Play Baseball With Stanford. 
### 
A letter was received today by
Treasurer Barrett from Iso Ab6,
superintendent of the athletic
department of Waseda University,
Japan. The communication ex
pressed a desire on the part of
Waseda to arrange an interna
tional baseball match between
Stanford and the Japanese univer
sity. Waseda University won the in
tercollegiate cham pionsbip of Japan
arid is represented by a strong team.
The Japanese team is willing to
come to the United States to play
and prefers to have the game take
place in San Francisco.
There is a strong probability
that the match will be arranged,
and in case it is it will be one of
the first international baseball
games ever played in America.
Treasurer Barrett is negotiating
with Manager Decoto of the Uni
versity of California in an effort to
arrange a game between California
and the Japanese university, for if
California and Stanford could
work together in the matter it
would add greatly to the interest
of the contests and reduce any
financial difficulties which might
come up. In case California does
not care to enter into the arrange
ment it is possible that Stanford
will undertake the matter alone.
