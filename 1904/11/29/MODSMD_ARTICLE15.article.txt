Every year editorials have been
written upon the need of protecting
the baseball diamond, and these
warnings have generally been
heeded by the student body at
large. To outsiders, careless of the
success or failure of the Univer
sity's baseball teams, these warn
ings have been useless, and tho re
sult we see to-day in the road
which cuts diagonally across the
field. Last year a majority of the
grocers' delivery carts, transfer
wagons and private rigs modestly
used the road nearer to the gym
nasium. This year, however, all
have cut across the field in a
straight line, and when after a rain
the road has become somewhat
heavy, they have merely driven in
a little closer to the actual dia
mond. To-day, by actual count,
heavy ruts have been made at
twenty-five paces from the second
bag. It is little exaggeration to
say that after a few more rainfalls
these modest Jehus may find the
bag itself in their way.
The Daily Palo Alto to-night,
re-echoing the expression of senti
ment made by many students to
the members of its staff, makes a
strong and urgent appeal to the
Athletic Committee and the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students to take some steps toward
remedying this evil. Last year we
saw ourselves scored upon more
than once because of the great un
certainties of fielding in this rough
zone. This year, when we have n
great deal more at stake, because
we have to produce two intercol
legiate teams instead of one, the
situation promises to be worse than
ever. We are of the opinion that
if the matter is taken actively in
hand bv such representative bodies
as the Athletic Committee and the
Executive Committee it will bo

quite possible to secure the tempor
ory closing of at least what was
never intended for use as a road.
The University has provided an
excellent road around the gym
nasium and another by the Inn,
and no one in these parts is so
pressed for time that he cannot
take the slightly longer route. It
is a noticeable fact that busseß and
carriages, when driven by their
public drivers, regularly use theße
roads, and as bus drivers usually
are not slow to take every advan
tage open to them, the presump
tion is that they follow the route
they do because of orders. This is
a matter which probably is entirely
in the hands of the business man
ager. Mr. Lathrop has in the past
done many good turns for Stan
ford athletes, and if the present
trouble be put before him by the
proper people, in the proper light,
it is not unreasonable to hope that
he will help them out again by
compelling delivery carts and
other wagons and carriages to fol
low the proper roads, as he has
done in the case of the busses.
To-morrow night both the Execu
tive Committee and the Athletic
Commit tee will meet. We respect
fully susgest that at these meetings
be inaugurated a movement that
may mean victory instead of de
feat in the coming contests with
the University of California.
