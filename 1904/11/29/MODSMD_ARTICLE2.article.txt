# Fall Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
It ib probable that fall baseball
practice will begin in earnest the
last of this week or the first of next.
Now that the football season is
over, Captain Trowbridge and a
number of other players will be
able to devote their time to base
ball. The practice this fall will be
primarily for the benefit of the
Freshman players. Games will
probably be played at each prac
tice between the Freshman and
Varsity squads.
Manager Barrett is now negoti
ating for a baseball coach for the
coming season. There is no inter
collegiate agreement binding the
college to a graduate baseball
coach, and the custom has been in
the past to engage a professional.
It is said that Doyle, who coached
the team last year, is anxious to
return again next spring, but
whether he or some former Varsity
player will be engaged is not yet
decided.
