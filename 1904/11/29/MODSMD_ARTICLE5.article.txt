played against the University of
Colorado last Thursday. Players
and officials speak in the highest
terms of the treatment they re
ceived from the Colorado students
and the Denver public. During

metropolis the members of the
Stanford party were agreeably en
tertained by various individuals!
and clubs. Friday the party made
a pleasure trip to Colorado Springs,
and took the train for home that
night.
T. Van Sickle, '05, suffered a se
vere fracture of the left elbow in
the Colorado game. The injured
member ia mending rapidly, and it
is not expected that any perman
ent disablement will result. With
the exception of some unimportant
sprains and bruises, the other play
ers did not suffer any injury in last
Thursday's game. Monzingo took
Van Sickle's place and played a
fine game at the position.
The Stanford players declare that
Colorado is stronger on the offen
sive than California. Reports from
Colorado papers indicate that
Hyde's blocking prevented the scor
ing of a field goal by the Boulder
team. A punt which was blocked
by the Cardinal center was caught
by Trowbridge, and resulted in a
touchdown for Stanford.
A large crowd of rooters met the
team at the Palo Alto depot last
night and hauled the members of
