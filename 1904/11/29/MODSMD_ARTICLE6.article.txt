### 
The following letter received to
day by Treasurer Barrett from the
Boulder Club of Boulder, Colorado,
will be of interest to the Stanford
public:
"We feel that we ought to let you
know the impression your football
team left with the members of this
Club, composed of men who are
lovers of good sport. The game
has been all played over at the
Club, and without a dissenting
voice, the verdict is that you have
the best team that ever played in
Colorado; th it the play of every
member of the team is clean and
sportsmanlike. A dozen times the
remark has been made 'We would
like to see that team play Michi
gan.'
"Stanford could send out to Colo
rado no advertisement that would
attract more attention, or receive
more favorable comment than she
has received and will receive from
the showing made by her great
football team.
"G. A. Griffin, President,
"H. F. Battev, Secretary."
