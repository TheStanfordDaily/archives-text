# Carnot Material Scarce.
## 
### 
The full Carnot bibliography is
an yet incomplete. The delay is
caused by the unusal scarcity of
material, and the apparent inaccess
ibility of what is available. The
librarians have been working on the
task for the past week and have
collected thus far only about a dozen
books which can be secured on ap
plication to the desk in the reference
room. Since most of the studying
on the question is not done until the
holidays this delay will in no way
hinder the debaters.
Reports from California indicate
that there is considerable agitation
among the debaters there to an
nounce a specific question, and
manage the contest on the same
lines as is the intercollegiate debate.
The faculty debating committee at
California is considering the matter
and they may make a proposition
to the Stanford committee soon.
There exists the same favorable
opinion among Stanford debaters
for a change to the old system, and
if the California committee declares
for a change the Stanford commit
tee may be prevailed upon to
agree.
