# CHESS MATCH FRIDAY.
## W.E. Nevill to Give Exhibition in Encina Under Auspices of Encina Club. 
### 
The exhibition chess match
which the Chess Club lias been
planning for some time will take
place Friday at 7:30 in the club
room of Encina Hall. President
It. A. Fuller of the Chess Club has
been corresponding for the past
month with prominent chess play
ers in San Francisco, and after
considerable difficulty he was at
last successful in making final ar
rangements for a match.
Wallace E. Nevill of San Fran
cisco, the player who is to give the
exhibition Friday night, is one of
the most prominent chess experts
on the Pacific Coast. He is a na
tive of Victoria, British Columbia,
but since coming to San Francisco
eleven years ago he has been well
known in chess circles, having
been a member of the Mechanics
Institute Chess Club. This year,
in the annual tournament for the
championship of the club, which
numbers many of the leading ex
ponents of the game in California,
he demonstrated his high rank by
easily carrying off first honors.
Some years ago Mr. Nevill took
up the art of playing simultaneous
games of chess, and at present he
has no rival on the Coast in this
department of the game. Several
months ago he played two sets of
simultaneous games with the Uni
versity of California Chess Club,
and on each occasion won eleven
out of the thirteen games played.
Friday night in the Encina club
room Mr. Nevill will undertake to
play simultaneously as many of
the best Stanford players as care
to match their skill with his. It is
probable that thirteen will be the
largest number that will be allowed
to enter, and among these will be
all the members of last year's chess
team who are at present in college.
A time limit of three hours will be
placed upon the matches.
Mr. Nevill will continue his stay
upon the campus until Sunday,
being entertained at several frater
nity houses in the meantime, and
Saturday night he will give an
exposition of some difficult posi
tions and problems to the mem
bers of the Chess Club. The exhi
bition in the Encina club-room on
Friday night will be open to any
who care to witness it. The time
and place for Saturday's exhibition
will be announced later.
