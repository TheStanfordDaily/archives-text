The second number of the Stan
ford Alumnus under the editorship
of Archie Ilice, '95, has reached us,
and we can not pass it by without a
word of praise. The issue is un
doubtedly the best number of
the graduate publication that
has ever been published, and in re
gard to the amount of interesting
material it contains it is not sur
passed by any college alumni pub
lication that is on our exchange
list. The editor of the magazine
has the correct conception of what
is interesting to the people whom
the Alumnus is intended to serve,
and if the present standard is con
tinued there need he no fear that the
paper will fail to receive the sup
port which it justly deserves.
