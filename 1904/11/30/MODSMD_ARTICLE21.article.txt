### 
—The seniors recently won the
class football championship at Har
vard.
—Michigan's football team aver
ages 1994 pounds this season. The
two tackles, Curtis and Graham,
weigh 240 and 235 respectively.
—There is an agreement on foot
to have Harvard and Princeton
sign an agreement to play a series
of football games next season. This
proposed agreementhascaused much
talk in Eastern football circles.
Although it is not known whether
it would have any effect upon the
existing agreement between Har
vard and Pennsylvania, yet when
the feeling existing in Cambridge
on account of the recent decisive
Red and Blue victory is considered,
this announcement seems to bear
some importance. Naturally Prince
ton will be the eleven to fill any
vacancy in the so-called big line of
Eastern football elevens. A seriep
of gameß between Harvard and
Princeton would put matters on a
more agreeable basis, and make the
question of deciding the champion
ship easier and more satisfactory
than under the present schedule.
