## Second Number an Excellent One Statistics and Chart of Varsity Game. 
### 
The second number of the Stan
ford Alumnus has just been pub
lished, and it is even better than (
the first issue. Great credit must
be given to Archie Uice, '95, for the
change that he has effected in the
magazine during his brief period of
control. He has put new life into
it, and has made it a well written
digest of ail happenings about the
University and among the alumni.
That the journal in its new form is
rapidly gaining the appreciation of
Stanford people is evident from the
following editorial statement of the
situation:
"Last year the Stanford Alumnus
had but 200 paid subscribers, and
only $200 from advertisements, —
and it ran behind $200. Late in the
summer an advance circular was
sent to alumni only announcing the
expectedchangeof editorial manage
ment; and for a beginning the Octo
ber issue went forth to about 450
subscribers. This November issue
is going out to about 650. At the
present writing there are exactly
620 subscribers. Twenty-five names
are on the free list —thirteen of
them are advertisers, seven are ex
changes, and the other five are Mrs.
Stanford, the Stanford University
Library, the Stanford Museum, the
Palo Alto Public Library, and the
Library of Congress at Washington,
I). C. Even the business manager
and the editor are pay subscribers.
Of the present subscribers 518 are
graduates of the University, 70 are
former students, 24 are faculty
members, 4 are trustees, 1 is a
former professor, 3 are outsiders,
and 1 is a Stanford fraternity
house. Stanford has graduated
1,235 men, and 374, or 30 per cent,
of them now take the Alumnus.
Stanford has graduated 713 women,
and 154, or 20 per cent, of them al
ready take the Alumnus."
The undergraduate turning the
pages of the Alumnus will find
plenty of reading that is of live in
terest. The statistical story of the
intercollegiate football game, which
for many years has appeared in
the San Francisco Chronicle, is
printed for the first time in the
Alumnus, accompanied by diagram
charts for both the Varsity and
Freshman games. There is a large
amount of other valuable and in
