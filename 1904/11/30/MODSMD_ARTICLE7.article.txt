### 
"A representative committee of
fourteen men and nine women has
been named to make arrangements
for Stanford's great decennial re
union to be held during commence
ment week of May, 1905." says the
Alumnus. "The personnel of the
committee was finally made known
to the individuals a month ago,
following the comment in the
Alumnus on the delay; but thus
far, with C. M. Fickert, '98, as
designated chairman, nothing fur
ther has been done.
"The committee consists of Thomas
G. Crothers, Mills building, San
Francisco, for '92; A. H. Wash
burn, 165 Devine street, San Jose,
for '93; Keinosuke Otaki, 31 Date
Sanbanchyo, Tokio, Japan, for '94;
Archie Rice, California Hotel, San'
Francisco, and Miss Bertha Chap
man, 404 Wadsworth avenue, Oak
land, for '95; Charles F. VVright
and Miss Alice N. Hays, both

ace H. Hindry, Ernest & Cranmer
building, Denver, Col., and Miss
Rose F. Smith, 2419 South Grand
avenue, Los Angeles, for '97;
Charles M. Fickert, U. S. Apprais
ers' building, San Francisco, and
Miss Blanche B. Byxbee, Palo

"There are five members of the
committee at San Francisco, four
at Stanford University, four at
Palo Alto, one each at Menlo Park,
San Jose, and Oakland, three at
Los Angeles, one at Portland, one
at Denver, one at New York, and
one at Tokio. Meetings of mem
bers of this committee will not be
practicable. The work will have
to be done by a system, and parts
of it allotted to different persons.
The Alumnus must serve as the
principal medium of publicity for
the reunion idea and plans for it.
"The reunion for May, 1905,
must be given repeated publicity.
Low round-trip rates will be in ef
fect then from the East because of
the Lewis and Clark exposition at
Portland, Ore., and further special
reductions can be obtained from
the Southern Pacific in California
and other western territory. Ac
commodations can be arranged for
in Palo Alto and on the campus
by proper committee work and ad
vance reports of expected visitors.
A whole program of entertainment
onn be prepared for the days of re
union, with athletic, musical, dra
matic, acquatic, social, humorous,

and revival features. Individuals
with ideas can send them to mem
bers of the committee. Each class
should have ready a complete ros
ter of all its original members, and
the class representatives on the
committee should receive and com
pile and endeavor to complete such
data during the next five months.
All information concerning the
present whereabouts and occupa
tion of persons who were ever
members of the pioneer class should
be sent to the editor of the Alumnus,
who will personally undertake to
have ready for the reunion an
alphabetical register of the 450 or
more men and women who com
posed Stanford's first freshman
class."
