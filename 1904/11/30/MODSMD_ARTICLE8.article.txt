of Ben Jonson's "Every Man in

E. K. Putnam, chairman. Each
member of the committee has charge
of a certain department of the work.
The condensing and preparing the
play itself for presentation is in the
hands of Professor Alden and Mr.

eral advisory board. Mr. liassett,
as an ex-oflicio member of the com
mittee, has charge of the choice and
training of the cast, and the general
direction of the play. The posters,
costumes, etc., will be attended to
by Miss Traphagen, '05, and Miss
Edwards, '06. W. H. Thomson,'os,
is business manager, and J. F. Cas
sell, '07, will act as press agent.
The stage direction will be in

work of selecting the cast will be
begun at once by Mr. Bassett and
the committee,so that members will
all be chosen before the end of this
semester.
