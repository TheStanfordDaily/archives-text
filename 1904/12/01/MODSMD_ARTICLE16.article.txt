# DR. MITSUKURI SPEAKS.
## Gives Interesting Address in Chapel on Manchuria and the Eastern War. 
### 
Dr. Kakichi Mitsukuri, of the
Imperial University of Tokio,Japan,
addressed an interested audience in
the chapel yesterday on the subject
of ''Manchuria and Japan's connec
tion with it in the present war."
Dr. Mitsukuri is on his way home
from the Congress of Arts and
Sciences at St. Louis, where he took
a leading part. He expressed him
self as glad to present the greetings
of Tokio, our "nearest neighbors"
on the West, and said that they feel
a kind of friendship to Stanford be
cause of the many exchanges be
tween the two institutions in stu
dents and faculty members.
Regarding the war in the East
Dr. Mitsukuri said that the conflict
is primarily a war of self-defence
by Japan. If Russia dominates
Manchuria Japan shall be stifled,
and her ability to expand will be
prevented—her very independence
will be threatend. Japan has always
said "keep hands off Korea." To
carry this out she was forced to
whip China in 1895. It is her
"Monroe doctrine." Russia, with
out reasonable grounds, has taken
possession of Manchuria, and is at
tempting to dominate Korea. Com
mercially Japan is willing that all
nations have an equal footing in
Korea, but politically she cannot
permit it. She has been reasonable
and moderate in her attitude, but
Russia has broken her pledges most
solemnly given, not only to Japan
but to other countries. There was
nothing left but to go to war.
The wider view of the conflict is
that it marks the clashing of the
two great tendencies, that of the
Muscovite movement east, with its
imperialistic and despotic nature,
and that of the Occidental civiliza
tion west,with its enlightement and
its freedom. Given these two things,
each invisible in its progress, and
there could not but be a collision, —
it was bound to come. Dr. Mitsu
kuri reviewed the relations between
Japan and Russia, and showed the
fairness and patience with which
Japan has considered the encroach
ment of Russia during the past 200
years. Japan is not willing to stand
by and be swallowed up, she de
clines to be put down, she is proud
of her noble history covering 2000
years, and her people have better
right to assert themselves in the
East, their home by birthright,than
has the white man.
Dr. Mitsukuri gave a resum6 of
the great changes in civilization in
Japan, of her enthusiastic and sin
cere adoption of all Western meth
ods and ideas. The present war is
a conflict between the Western civ
ilization championed by Japan,and
the Eastern civilization upheld by
Russia; and will determine which
is to dominate in the Orient.
After going fully into the reasons
why Japan expects to come out vic

torious in the present struggle, the
speaker took up the subject of the
"Yellow Peril," which he character
ized as absurd, declaring that Japan
could give rise to no such peril even
if she would. He showed that every
thing for which Japan stands must
work for the very opposite tend
ency.
Dr. Mitsukuri closed with a high
tribute to America in her attitude
toward Japan, which considers it
self our protege. He expressed his
gratitude, and that of his people, at
the universal sympathy for Japan
in the present conflict which is
manifest in America, and the hope
that such cordial and sincere rela
tions may always continue.
