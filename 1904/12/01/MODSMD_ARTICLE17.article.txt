Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is necessary that every mem
ber of the Junior class pay the
Quad assessment of three dollars,
which has been due since the first
of the semester. But fifty mem
bers of the class have paid the as
sessment up to date, while for the
same time last year two-thirds, or
about one hundred students, had
paid.
Owing to the fact that the man
ager of the Quad was selected near
ly four months later than usual,
and that a certain amount of ready
c.ash is required immediately to
bind different contracts, it is es
sential that the members of the
class pay their assessment as soon
as pos-ible.
After December 22d no more as
sessments will be received, and all
those who have not paid their
three dollars will not be entitled to
have their pictures in the annual.
With every paid assessment is
given the customary receipt, en
titling the holder to have his or
her picture taken at Steele Bros.'
I will be ready to receive assess
ments as stated in the announce
ment column of the Daily Palo
Alto, and respectfully request that
all Juniors pay up as soon as pos
sible in order that the work of get
ting out the annual may not be re
tarded. J. L. Maloy,
Manager of 1906 Quad.
