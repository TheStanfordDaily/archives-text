# Women's League "At Home."
## 
### 
To-morrow evening from 8 to 11
the women of the University will
gather for the final meeting of the
year. This is the first time that
the league has attempted to re
ceive in the evening, and for this
reason, as well as for the purpose
of interesting a larger number of
the college women in its work, the
committee has spared no pains in
making the affair a success.
The entertainment committee, of
which Miss Julia Boynton, '06, is
chairman, has succeeded in ar
ranging a most interesting and en
tertaining program, which will be
largely musical, but will be inter
spersed with "specialties," con
tributed by the various sororities.
The guests will be received by a
committee of faculty ladies and
undergraduates, headed by Mrs. L.
R. Lenox, who is a member of the
league executive board. .
The object of the league is to
bring together the faculty women
and the undergraduates on an in
formal social basis, and to promote
the interests of the women in the
activities of college life. For this
reason it is especially desired that
all of the college women who posi
tively can will make an effort to be
present and to become acquainted.
The "At Home" is to be held in
the University Inn.
