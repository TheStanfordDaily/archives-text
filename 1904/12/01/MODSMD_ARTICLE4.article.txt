# ATHLETIC COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Varsity Sweaters Awarded. — Permanent Class Football Sweater Adopted. 
### 
The second meeting of the Ath
letic Committee this semester took
place last night, and considerable
important business was transacted.
The first question to be taken up was
that of a regulation football jersey
for the men composing the Fresh
man team. In the past the matter
has been left entirely with the
classes, with the result that the jer
seys awarded have not been uniform
in regard to shape of numerals.
Last year a jersey vest was given
with small numerals, which was a
radical change from former prece
dent, and resulted in considerable
adverse comment. As a result the
Athletic Committee has taken the
matter in charge, and determined
that in the future the Freshman
jerseys shall all be the same. The
type of jersey selected waHthe same
as that awarded the team this year:
a plain red garment with eight-inch
white block numerals.
The committee voted tennis shirts
to C. H. Baker, '04, and G. A.
Hodge, '06, as a reward for their
services in the intercollegiate tennis
match last spring. The shirt is a
regular tennis shirt with a small
"S" on the left side with two tennis
racquets crossed in the the back
ground.
Considering the increasing inter
est which has recently asserted it
self in the West in regard to discus
throwing, the Athletic Committee
voted to recommend to the Execu
tive Committee that the purchase
of a discus be made. It was
thought that if enough interest was
shown in the event at Stanford it
might be included in the list of fu
ture intercollegiate field events.
Sweaters bearing the Varsity em
blem were awarded to all those men
who participated in the intercolle
giate football game with California.
The men are G. H. Clark, '05, W.
K. Sprott, '06, R. A. Thompson,
'05, C. E. Hyde, '05, W. K. Roose
velt, '05, H. Shields, '05, R. F. Vest,
'06, L. P. Bansbach,'os, W. H. Dole,
'05, A. J. Chalmers,'o7, M. J. Wel
ler, '07, E. P. Stott, '07, and H. G.
Butterfield, '05. The men who were
on the sidelines at the game in
football suits were awarded second
team sweaters with the black Ger
man "S." There was a much larger
number of these men than usual;
for this reason, and because of the
fact that no regular second team
was chosen, it is possible that no
6econd-team jerseys, with the white
German £ 'S," will be awarded.
However, final decision was not
rendered, and the matter will be
decided at a future meeting.
It has long been the custom of
many Eastern universities to give
each member of a winning football
team some token which may serve
as a reminder of his services for
his college. In pursuance of this
custom the Athletic Committee ad
vised the Executive Committee to
authorize the purchase of such
tokens. Considerable discussion
took place in regard to the form of
the gift.
The members of the committee
were in favor of the presentation of

a gold football to each member of
the team, the coaches, trainer, and
manager. The football, as pro
posed, will have on it the name of
the person to whom it is presented,
the position he played on the learn,
the year, and the score. A com
mittee was appointed to lay the
matter before the Executive Com
mittee, who will take final judg
ment.
