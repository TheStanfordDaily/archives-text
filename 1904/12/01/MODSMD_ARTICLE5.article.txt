# PROPOSED TRACK MEET.
## Freshman Track Men at California Want an Intercollegiate Field-Day Next Spring. 
### 
At a meeting of the executive
committee of the associated stu
dents of the University of Califor
nia Tuesday night a letter was
read from A. H. de Mamiel, cap
tain of the freshman track team, in
which he asked for a freshman in
tercollegiate track meet to be held
next spring. This plan is received
favorably by R. Hackley, captain
of California's varsity team. No
definite action was taken in regard
to the matter, as the committee
wished to consider the proposition
more thoroughly.
The idea of instituting a Fresh
man intercollegiate track meet is
looked upon very favorably at Stan
ford. Ttiis matter hascome up for
discussion before the Athletic Com
mittee in previous years, but for
various reasons the contest has
never been arranged. When inter
viewed to-day in regard to the
matter Dr. Angell, chairman of
the faculty athletic committee, ex
pressed himself as being very fav
orable toward the project. He
said that he believed the proposed
meet would lend to bring many
Freshmen out on the track who
otherwise might not turn out.
Track Captain H. W. Bell, '05,
also favors the idea of holding a
Freeh man intercollegiate track
meet. He said that the matter had
been considered several times be
fore, but this year, owing to the
large number of Freshman track
athletes at both universities, the
project should succeed. Among
the Freshmen who are training on
the track at present the prospect of
an intercollegiate meet is very
favorably received.
The only problem in regard to
the proposed meet which seems
difficult to solve at present is the
arrangement of a date for such a
contest. Rain would probably pre
vent an early date, and baseball
and the Varsity track meet would
interfere later. This, however, is a
minor detail which could easily be
settled if the contest is arranged.
