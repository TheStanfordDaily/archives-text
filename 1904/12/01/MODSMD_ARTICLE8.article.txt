# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY.
## Able Addresses Delivered Before the Student Body by Professors Page and Miller. 
### 
The University Assembly was
addressed this morning by Profes
sors T. W. Page and A. C. Miller,
both members of the economics
department of the University of
California. Both speakers treated
of the spirit of commercialism that
rules in the United States to-day.
Professor Page read a scholarly
paper on the subject that was at
the same time an easy treatment of
it and very interesting. While not
sparing criticism of those things
that have tended to corruption and
lowering of ideals, he at the same
time defended commercialism, to
which he attributed the growth
and advancement of nations. He
said in part:
"Six years of unprecedented pros
perity, the reorganization of busi
ness along new lines, the notoriety
given to several possessors of col
ossal fortunes, and the exposure of
a number of gigantic frauds have
drawn the attention of the whole
world; and both in this country
and abroad frenzied outcrieB have
arisen against the commercialism
prevalent in American life. The
spirit of commercialism, it is said,
shows itself in two ways : It is
urged, in the first place, that the
organization of business in Amer
ica admits of acts and methods that
are not only selfish, but actually
dishonest. Need I remind you of
the notorious shipbuilding trust
which the receiver pronounced to
be a swindle as artistic as it was
gigantic? Consider the sensational
exposures made by Mr. Folk in St.
Louis of the bribery and corruption
resorted to in that city by prom
inent business men.
"Another form in which the
same spirit shows itself is the in
tense devotion to money-making
of Americans who would scorn to
use dishonest methods, a devotion
maintained to the neglect, even to
the suppression, of higher culture
and lofty ideals.
"But, after all, is the situation
so desperate? Do not forget that
wealth is an instrument, not only
for evil, but for good. I would re
mind you that the great intellec
tual movement dividing the dark
ages from modern times, the move
ment commonly called the Renais
sance, occurred in a period of com
mercialism selfish, more
sordid than that we now experience.
Turn now to the present and ask
yourselves who have been the mis
sionaries that have done most for
the poor whites of the South and
the illiterate and murderous popu
lation of the Alleghanies. It is the
engineers and the business men
that are building the railroads and
cotton mills, opening the mines,
and erecting the furnaces that af
ford employment and offer to these
people hope and opportunity of es
cape from a life of poverty and
so.ualor to a higher life where re
ligion is something more than a
superstition and the ideal of man
hood is something higher than
mere success in blood feuds."
Professor Miller, the second
speaker, talked of the great field
offered by business to young men.
The best talent of the country, he
said, is to be found in the field of
business to-day, and there is so
much room at the top that those
who get there are apt to feel un
comfortably lonely. The univer
sities, despite the cry of commer
cialism, have recognized the need
of business training, and one after
another they have furnished the
technical schools required.
