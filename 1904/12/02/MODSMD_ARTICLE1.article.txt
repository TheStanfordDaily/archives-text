# FRESHMEN VS. FACULTY
## Second Game Will Be Played To-morrow Morning.â€”Regular Practice Begins Monday. 
### 
The second game of baseball be
tween the Freshmen and the Faculty
will take place to-morrow morning
at 9 o'clock on the Faculty Club
diamond. The first game between
these two teams resulted in a vic
tory for the Freshmen by the close
score of 8 to 7.
The first-year men have had two
practice games since their last
match with the Faculty, and will
probably show improvement in
their work to-morrow. About
thirty-five Freshmen turned out at
the last game, and of this number
twenty-seven were given a chance
to play. A large number of men
will he played to-morrow, and the
men who did not get into the game
last time will be given a chance.
A. J. Chalmers, left fielder on last
year's Varsity, will have the Fresh
men in charge.
The Faculty team will be
strengthened by the addition of
Professor Newsoni, who will play
short-stop. The faculty line-up
will be: NVhitaker, pitcher; Searles,
catcher; Mi 1 lis, first base; Angell,
second base; Fish, third base;
Newsom, short-stop; Adams, left
field; hewers, center field; Marx,
right field.
On Monday afternoon the regu
lar fall baseball practice will com
mence. Captain Trowbridge has is
sued a call to all of last year's play
ers, and all Freshmen to turn out.
No coach has been engaged, and the
work will be under the supervision
of the Varsity players now in col
lege.
The main work to be engaged in
this semester will be batting prac
tice and fielding, and it is not
probable that any games will take
place. The men will probably ap
pear for practice three times a
week.
