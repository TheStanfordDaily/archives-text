# No Track Meet This Semester
## 
### 
Shortly after the last field meet,
which was held about two weeks
ago, it was suggested that another
contest beheld a little later on. It
was expected that the men would
be in better condition and that the
showings made in this second meet
would give a more satisfactory line
on the ability of the new track
athletes. However, this plan has
been abandoned, because the end of
the semester is too near and many
of the men would not have time to
participate in such a meet. At
present there are a good many men
out on the track every afternoon
doing light work. More than half
the men now training are first-year
athletes.
