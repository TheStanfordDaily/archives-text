# Capitola Conference.
## 
### 
At the close of last summer's
session of the Y. W. C. A. Confer
ence at Capitola a committee com
posed of college presidents was ap
pointed to consider the plan of
changing the time of meeting of
the annual conference The pro
posed change was deemed advis
able because of the various dates of
commencement in the different col
leges, those in the south closing
some weeks later than California
and Stanford.
This committee has handed in
its report; and the report, which has
been approved by the American
committee in Chicago, changes
the date from the middle of May to
the Easter vacation, from March
31st to April Bth inclusive. The
change is extremely gratifying to
the great majority of college women
interested in the conference, as
they now hope for a larger number
of delegates than ever before.
The conference means much to
those who attend, both spir
itually and socially. At these
annual gatherings there are brought
together the representatives of all
the colleges on this Coast, includ
ing those of Nevada. The morning
sessions are devoted to lectures and
bible study classes, led by the abl
est men from all parts of the United
States. There are missionaries,
general secretaries, world secre
taries, and leading educational
men to address the assemblies.
The afternoons are given over
entirely to recreation and to social
gatherings. An excellent oppor
tunity is given for becoming ac
quainted with people from other
colleges.
Stanford association workers
have planned to have a Capitola
rally next Tuesday at the hour of
the regular meeting. They are
anxious to have the largest num
ber of delegates of any college, and
for this purpose they are planning
to work up the interest among the
undergraduates. Miss Emma Hay
ward, '06, has been appointed
chairman of the Capitola commit
tee, and with several assistants she
is planning to have three hundred
delegates from Stanford.
