# FOOTBALL CAPTAIN ELECTED
## W.K. Sprott, '06, Chosen to Lead Next Year's Varsity Eleven. 
### 
W. K. Sprott, '06, was elected
captain of next year's Varsity foot
ball team at a meeting held in En
cina Hall to-night. No opposition
developed, and S(>rott was unani
mously chosen for the honor of
directing the Cardinal eleven next
year by the twelve men who played
with him against California. The
selection of the brilliant left-tackle
for the captaincy was a deserved
recognition of three years' faithful
work on the Varsity eleven.

The new captain's football ex
perience began on the Porterville
high school team, where he played
half-back and tackle for several
yearn. On entering college his
style of play attracted the attention
of the coachec, and be experienced
no difficulty in making his Fresh
man team. In the Freshman game
of that year, which was lost to
California, Sprott's work did much
to hold down the score to 12-0.
He made the Varsity team the
same year, and his playing in the
game, which Stanford lost 1G to 0,
led experts to predict that he would
become as irreat a tackle as W. 1.
Traeger, ex-'O3. Sprott sustained
a severe injury in the 6 to 6 game
last year, but not before he had
demonstrated that in everything
except physical endurance he is
the equal of the famoii√ü tackle who
won the 1900 game for Stanford.
For this year's contest against Gali

fornia Sprott was in excellent
physical condition, and his mar
velous offensive work in that game
was responsible for a large part of
the gains made by the Stanford
backs. His opponent, Force, was
outclassed, and California did not
make a single gain through the new
captain's position.
\V. K. Sprott is a major in the
department of Mechanical Engi
neering, and registers from Porter
ville. He is a member of Kappa
Alpha fraternity.
