# SOPHOMORE DEBATE TRY-OUT.
## Team to Meet Freshmen in Annual Contest Will Be Selected Tomorrow Night. 
### 
The try-out for the selection of
the Sophomore debating team will
he held Saturday night in the
chapel. All the arrangements have
been made by the Sophomore class
instead of by the Intersociety De
bating League, and consequently a
few of the regulations of this con
test will be decidedly different from
preceding ones. Instead of allow
ing the regular ten minutes for
each man, but seven minutes will
be granted, and instead of the nine
and three minutes which are usu
ally given the first affirmative
speaker, but five and three will be
given. This arrangement was
made iti order that the monotony
usually attendant upon a class try
out might be in a measure done
away with, —and since there are
twenty-seven entries for this try
out, it will probably work to ad
vantage.
H. M. Lewis, '04, Professor W.
C. Dennis of the Law department,

judges. W. L. Blair, '05, will pre
side. The first debate will be
