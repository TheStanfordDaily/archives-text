# MR. FARWELL LECTURES.
## Interesting Discussion on Efforts to Develop an American Type of Music. 
### 
Mr. Arthur Farvvell of Newton,
Massachusetts, spoke in the chapel
last night on the subject of Ameri
can Music. Mr. Farvvell is the or
ganizer of the Wa Wan Press, which
seeks to determine, by experiments
in a new Held, the development of
a national American musical art.
There is now great diversity of com
position but no music distinctive of
the land, and the object is to har
monize the diversities so as to bring
out a distinctively American type
of music, just as there is in Poland,
Hungary, and other European
countries. There iH a revolt among
American writers against the old
lines of classical music, and a de
sire to create new expressions,—to
step from the initiative borrowing
stage to the creative stage.
There is abundant field for this
work, and although the Wa Wan
Association has been organized but
three years there has been much ac
complished. The impulses and sug
gestions and inspirations arising
from the soil find expression in the
folklore of the negroes of the South,
of the Indians of the West, of the
old Spanish-Americans in Califor
nia, beaming upon the life and his
tory the religious reverence, the
passions, and the emotions of the
people. What is needed now is un
ity ; diversity already exists, but
there is not that acquaintance and
sympathy among the writers of the
country to bring about the distinc
tive type. For example, there are
thirty composers in San Francisco,
only one of whom is known to any
extent in the East. The result can
only be obtained by joining forces
and co-operating.
Mr. Farwell entered into a very
interesting discussion of the music
among our primitive inhabitants.
He is traveling himself for the pur
pose of making this a study, and is
visiting various Indian tribes get
ting from them their chants, melo
dies and songs. Rhythm is the first
thing developed among savage peo
ples. Melody comes next and takes
music out of the purely physiologi
cal element, and expresses emotion.
11 is entirely independent of rhythm
though it embodies it. Last comes
harmony, which combines melodies
and rhythms. These elements are
the weapons for the bringing home
of a life motive. The Indian melo
dies have all a religious signifi
cance,—they import a message from
the gods. The Indian mythology
embodies the idea of the Great
Spirit, which more properly might
be called the Great Mystery (for
they do conceive of a personal god),
and which means all nature collec
tively. Beneath that come the
gods — the elements, lightnings,
winds,thunders,and the like. Their
