# NEW PROFESSOR APPOINTED.
## Harris J. Ryan of Cornell to Become Head of Electrical Engineering Department. 
### 
At the last meeting of the Board
of Trustees of the University Har
ris J. Ryan was appointed Profes
sor of Electrical Engineering at
Stanford. Professor W. F l . Du
and, who has been acting head of
the Electrical Engineering depart
ment, will turn the position over to
Professor Ryan at the beginning of
the college year next fall.
The new professor of Electrical
Engineering graduated at Cornell
University in 1886. For about a
year after his graduation he was
engaged in the Middle West in
practical engineering work. The
following year he was called back
to Cornell as instructor in physics,
and in 1889 he was appointed as
sistant professor of electrical engi
neering,from which position he has
been successively promoted, first to
an associateship and then to a full
professorship, which place he has
held for seven years.
As an original investigator Pro
fessor Ryan takes high rank among
the engineers of the present day,
and in certain directions he has
few if any superiors. Two of his
investigations give him much
prominence in the history of elec
trical engineering. The first was
an improvement in electric gener
ators whereby the output per pound
of material employed could be not
ably increased. This, resulted in
the design and patenting of a
dynamo which is now in general
use. His second investigation has
reference to the strength of gases
under pressure, and the recently
published experiments of Professor
llyan have developed an unex
pected series of facts for the use of
the constructive electrical engineer.
As an investigator Professor Ryan
will bring to Stanford an assured
and most enviable reputation, and
his presence here should serve to
attract students from all parts of
the country who will have learned
of his original work along these
lines.
Professor Ryan is the author of
a large number of papers dealing
with various phases of electrical
engineering, and, in collaboration
with Norris and Hoxie, he is now
publishing a text-book on electri
cal engineering which has met
with much favorable comment
from reviewers.
