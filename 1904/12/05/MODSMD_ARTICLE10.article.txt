# ANNOUNCEMENT.
## 
### 
Until very recently the students of
the University have respected the un
written law against smoking in and
about the inner and outer quadrangle.
Recently this has been disregarded at
the ends of the Jarcades in different
places. I trust that the students will
not make it necessary to change this
unwritten law into a written one ; but
in any case the University will not
tolerate smoking about the buildings,
nor on the steps leading to them.
DAVID S. JORDAN.
That it has been necessary for
President Jordan to give out the
announcement printed above is to
be regretted. More than once the
Daily Palo Alto has mentioned
the matter editorially, but the abuse
has continued. From the earliest
days of the University the custom
has been that there should be no
smoking on the quadrangle. When
the outer quadrangle was begun,
and after part of it bad been com
pleted, a number of men took to
smoking in the space between the
two groups of buildings, but after
some objections to this had been
raised the practice ceased. When the
class-rooms in the outer quadrangle
came into use, the abuse to which
the announcement referssprang up,
and has been continued ever since.
The men who are accustomed to
smoke on the steps of the buildings
and in the road near the steps have
probably gone on the assumption
that they were not violating the
unwritten custom which says there
shall be no smoking in the quad
rangle. But we believe that the
spirit if not the letter of the law
has been violated by the practice,
and it is hoped that no further vio
lations will take place. The tra
dition that has grown up with the
University is a good one, and we
think all will agree that it is far
better to have it remain as a time
honored tradition rather than have
it changed into an enforced Uni

versity regulation. It is very clear
from the announcement that the
smoking on or near the buildings
has to stop, and it is with a desire
to see the tradition remain that we
hope there will he no further viola
tions of the spirit of a praiseworthy
custom.
