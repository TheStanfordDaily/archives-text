# Roble Club Entertains.
## 
### 
The women of Roble gave a most
enjoyable dance last Saturday
evening in Roble gymnasium. The
affair was unusually successful,
and the attendance was large.
Dancing began at 7:30 and contin
ued until 12 o'clock. The gymna
sium was very tastefully decorated.
Japanese lanterns and umbrellas
were hung from the ceiling, and
red streamers were draped from
the sides to the center of the room,
the whole giving a striking ori
ental effect. The sides of the room
were dotted with college pennants
and holly was judiciously used in
relieving barren corners. All in
all the decorations had a distinc
tive college tone.
