At a recent meeting of the officers
of the Combined Musical Clubs it
was decided to give a series of con
certs in near-by towns during the
month of February. According to
the plans of the committee eight
concerts will be given in the series.
The first entertainment will be
given on the campus on the even
ing of February 4th. The other
concerts which will follow the one
on the campus will be given in the
surrounding towns so that the
trips will not interfere with the col
lege work of members of the clubs.
Although nothing definite has been
decided with regard to the concerts

difficulty will arise to prevent
them. The expenses will be very
low and the receipts should more
than pay them.

the clubs decided on and will make
