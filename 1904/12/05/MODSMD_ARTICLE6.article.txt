# PLAY COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Work of Getting Out English Club Play Organized Under Sub-committees. 
### 
The committee appointed by Pres
ident D. M. Reynolds of the Eng
lish Club to take charge of the pro
duction of Ben Jonson's "Everyman
in His Humour" has adopted a
plan for the organization of its work.
After careful consideration the dif
ferent departments of the work were
assigned to the individual members
of the committee, and these will in
turn be authorized to appoint sub
committees to assist them, if they
find that any part of their work re
quires special attention. In making
this arrangement the committee was
guided I>3' the experience gained
from the production of "The Knight
of the Burning Pestle" two years
ago.
Mr. L. E. Bassett, who was given
the work of bringing out the play
by the English Club at large, is an
ex-officio member of the committee,
and will have entire control of the
training and final selection of the
cast, although he will at all times
be aided by the whole committee,
which in regard to this matter will
act as a purely advisory body. Mr.
Bassett's previous experience, espec
ially that derived from his connec
tion with "The Knight of the Burn
ing Pestle," will be of invaluable
benefit in the present performance.
Professor R. M. Alden will have
charge of the text of the play, mak
ing all necessary changes and elim
inations. He will also have charge
of the music, which will lie given by
the conventional Elizabethan or
chestra of five pieces. The stage will
be in charge of I). M. Reynolds,'os.
The difficult task of designing the
costumes, both for the players and
the Elizabethan audience, and of
getting out a suitable poster, will
be left in the hands of Miss K. E.
Traphagen, '05, and Miss C. Z. Ed
wards, '06. At present there is
some uncertainty as to Miss Trapha
gen's returning to college next se
mester, in which case this difficult
branch of work will devolve entirely
upon Miss Edwards, and the sub
committee which she may appoint.
The business end of the work will
be taken care of by W. H. Thomson,
'05, and the press work and adver
tising by J. F. Cassell, '07. In
structor E. K. Putnam, as chairman
of the committee, will divide his at
tention equally among the various
departments.
After considerable discussion it
was decided that two performances
of the play should be given, one
coming on a Thursday night and
the other on the following Satur
day. The exact dates for the per
formance were not fully determined
upon, but unless other University
affairs interfere they will probably
be the 9th and 11th of March re
spectively. This will allow two
whole months of uninterrupted
work for training the cast.
In selecting the cast Mr. Bassett
will call upon those only who are
known to have sufficient ability in
dramatic work to carry the parts of
the play. As the purpose of the
performance is not to develop his
trionic talent, but rather to put the
best known talent in the University

into the play, a regular try-out
would be detrimental rather than
advantageous. There are a number
of the actors who took part in"The
Knight of the Burning Pestle"avail
able at present, and with these as a
nucleus work can begin on a basis
that will promise succese.
At the last regular meeting of the
English Club, which will be held
next Wednesday, the play itself will
be discussed, and a paper will be
read by a member of the English
department. The opportunity for
members of the club to become ac
quainted with the play at the start
will be an excellent one. and should
be taken advantage of by all.
