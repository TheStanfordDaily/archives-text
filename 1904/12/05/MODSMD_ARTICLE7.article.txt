# CHESS EXPERT WINS.
## W.E. Nevill Gives Interesting Exhibitions, and Wins Ten out of Thirteen Gaines. 
### 
Wallace E. Nevill, the expert
chess player from San Francisco,
gave two very interesting exhibi
tions of chess playing, under the
auspices of the Chess (Jlub, on Fri
day and Saturday nights. In the
the simultaneous games, which
took place Friday night in the
Encina club-room, Nevill won ten
out of the thirteen games that were
played, and tied two. On Satur
day night, at the Heta Theta Pi
house, he demonstrated a number
of problems and positions.
Of the thirteen men who essayed
to play Nevill in the simultaneous
contests, T. R. \Y r . F. Figg-Hoblyn,
'08,| was the only one to win his
game. Of the other twelve, F. P.
Whitaker, '05, and M. M. Stearns,
'06, succeeded in playing the cham
pion tie games. G. E. Dole, '07,
E. W. Doane, '05, H. L. Deering,
'05, R. A. Fuller, '05, F. P. Hasel
wood, '05, F. E. (J 1 rich, '06, A. C.
Whitaker, and H. W. Simkins, Dr.
N. G. Scroggs, and E. F. Barker of
Palo Alto were the other ten play
ers; and although several of them
made good showings, they were at
last overcome by the veteran's
knowledge of the game. The
match lasted for over three hours,
and was well attended.
The showing made by the Stan
ford players is about equal to that
that of the California Chess
Club in the two simultaneous
matches which Nevill has played
with them.
