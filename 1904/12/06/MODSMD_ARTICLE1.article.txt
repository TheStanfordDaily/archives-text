# FIRST FALL PRACTICE.
## Twenty-two Men Turned Out For Light Work on the Diamond Yesterday. 
### 
Twenty-two baseball candidates
went through light practice yester
day afternoon under the direction
of Captain A. L.Trowbridge. Prac
tice in fielding was the only de
partment of the game engaged
in, and the throwing to bases
was rendered difficult by the cold
weather.
The men were divided into two
squads, those trying for the infield
and those trying for outfield posi
tions. Two men were kept busy
batting to the different squads.
Very little throwing to the bases
was engaged in, owing to the cold
weather and to the practice being
the first. The men were not prac
ticed at batting, though this phase
of the game will probably receive
attention later on.
Most of the men who turned out
were men who have appeared on
the diamond before, and it was
noticeable that few Freshmen were
among the candidates. Besides
Captain Trowbridge two members
of last year's Varsity were pres
ent — Chalmers, who played left
field, and Colbert, last season's
first-baseman.
The fact that but twenty-two
men turned out may be partly ac
counted for by a number of base
ball men having gymnasium work
in the afternoon. Captain Trow
bridge will have his men out every
afternoon during the week, weather
permitting, and it is probable that
the squad will be larger on Tues
days and Thursdays.
From the first practice little can
be gained from which to draw a
good line on next year's team, but
it is easily seen that the captain
and coach will have a difficult task
to develop a strong nine. With
but four Varsity men in college,
and a weak second team from
which to draw, the outlook for next
year is discouraging.
The last four years Stanford has
had a good fielding team, but the
men have, barring last year's inter
collegiate series, failed to prove as
strong as California at the bat.
There are a large number of base
ball men in college who are good
fielders, but there are few strong
batters. The coach will have a
serious problem on his hands to
develop a team of hard hitters
from the material at present in col
lege. The Freshman class may
furnish material for the Varsity,
but judging from the men that
they have played this season the
Varsity possibilities seem to be
few.
The following men turned out for
practice yesterday :
A. L. Trowbridge, '05 ; F. H.
Trowbridge,'o6, A. J. Chalmers,'o7,
G. J. Presley, '07, H. Barkan, '05,
