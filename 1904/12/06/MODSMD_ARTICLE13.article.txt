in college is unusually small, and
the other material out last night is
as yet an uncertain quantity. But
it must be remembered that there
are many good baseball men who,
for various reasons, are unable to
practice at the present time; and
with the probability that among
these will he found several first
class Varsity possibilities, we still
have hopes of at least an average
team. The men who have responded
to the call of the captain should re
ceive every encouragement, and any
others who find it possible to prac
tice during the remaining two weeks
of the semester should be urged to
get out. Great results cannot be
expected from the fall practice, but
some good can be done, and for this
reason the practice should receive
the support of all who can contrib
ute.
