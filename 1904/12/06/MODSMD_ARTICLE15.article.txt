Club play committee held yester

upon. The dates for the two separ
ate performances of the play were
set for March 9th and 11th respect
ively. It was also decided that
the committee should meet regular
ly at 4:30 Monday afternoons. An
arrangement was made in favor of
the Boat Club, by which it is dis
tinctly understood that the play is
hot to be given for the benefit of
that Organization, but at the same
time the committee will recommend
to the English Club that the Boat
Club receive a share in the profits.
The discussion of the cast was
then taken up briefly, and it seems
probable that there will be little
difficulty in filling the eighteen
parts that are called for.
