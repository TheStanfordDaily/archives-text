# Work on English Club Book Slow.
## 
### 
The history of Stanford which
the English Club undertook to
compile lust year, and which it was
intended to have ready by the first
of this month, will not lie out for
some months, owing to delays
which have been experienced in se
curing the manuscripts that were
promised. The work has been in
charge of Miss A. W. Kimball, '04,
assisted by A. R. Fletcher, '06, and
although they have done all that
has been possible to hasten it, they
have been unable to secure more
than two of the manuscripts. At
present there seems to be no possi
bility of getting the book into shape
before the middle of next semester.
