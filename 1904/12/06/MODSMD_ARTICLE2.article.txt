# WILL GIVE SPECIAL LECTURE.
## Mr. Luther P. Burbank, the Famous Plant Specialist, Appointed by Trustees. 
### 
The President's office to-day an
nounced the appointment of Luther
Burbanlc to be special lecturer in
the science of plant culture by arti
ficial selection. The appointment
was made by the Board of Trustees
of the University at their recent
meeting. Mr. Burbank recently de
livered a number of informal lec
tures at the University, and the
simplicity of his manner created a
very pleasing impression among
those who heard him. The lectures
which he will give under his new ap
pointment will be of the same kind,
but prepared with more system. No
special dates have been set for the
lectures, but Mr. Burbank will visit
the University two or three times,
delivering several lectures each
time.
Mr. Burbank is famous the world
over as the greatest practical worker
in the science of creating new plants
by means of artificial selection. He
came to California many year 9 ago,
settling at Sebastopol, near Santa
Rosa, where he established his plant
farm. His first great creation was
the potato which bears his name.
During the past twelve years he has
produced new species of many plants
and fruits which have resulted in
the practical disappearance of the
old forms from the market.
