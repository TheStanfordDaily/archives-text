### 
A recent edition of the New Y r ork
Evening Post contains an interest
ing article on athletics at Oxford
as seen by American collegians.
The views of the American scholars
at Oxford are given in the Post as
follows:
"Among the messages from Ox
ford that are beginning to flow
back to this country from the
American Rhodes scholars those
touching on the English univer
sity's athletic life are tilled with a
new wonder at, and half-expressed
admiration of, a system that gets
every sound-limbed man in college
into some game. Mr. W. L. Sperry,
writing to the Boston Transcript,
says that it is 'interesting to those
hardened by long experience to the
exclusiveness of the fraternity and
athletic circles so characteristic of
our American universities to find
that the Oxford spirit, on the
whole, is inclusive. A constant
stream of captains and secretaries
pour through the freshman's rooms
during the opening days of the
term,' and he is urged to play
hockey, cricket, 'Rugger,' and
'Socker,' to enter track events, to
join a debating club, a church so
ciety, a musical organization, or
the Oxford Union. An Indiana
representative describes, in a letter
to the Indianapolis Neios, the preva
lence of sports in the colleges:
'From one till four o'clock in the
afternoon the colleges are deserted
while the whole body of five thous
and students may be seen in various
athletic parks and on the river.'
"Drafted into a football game,
the American from Indiana was
surprised to find that there were no
spectators, no grandstands, no
frenzied 'rooting.' 'His first thought
[was] that these people have no
college loyalty or interest in ath
letics. But . . . they are all busy
trying to uphold the honor of the
college in some other branch of
athletics.' No wonder the Ameri
cans are astonished; the contrast
with our own college methods is,
indeed, striking."
