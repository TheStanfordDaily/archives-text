# Olympic Club Will Play Indians.
## 
### 
The Sherman Indians of River
side, who played against Stanford
this season, are to meet a team of
Olympic Club players in Los
Angeles next Saturday. While
the latter eleven has not heen fully
picked as yet, it is known that F.
L. Slaker, ex-'O3, will play full
back, Cavanaugh will be at center,
and Claude Kern of California will
probably line up at half. The
Indians have been successful in
nearly all their games this season
and have won the championship of
Southern California. The Olym
pics will have brilliant individual
players, but little team work to
match that of the Sherman play
ers. Two Stanford men, C. B.
Raitt, ex-'O3, and W. I. Traeger,
ex-'O3, will umpire and referee the
game.
