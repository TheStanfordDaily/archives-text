# Large Chimney for Gymnasium.
## 
### 
An important piece of work in
connection with the new Gymnas
ium building was completed to-day,
when the last brick was placed in
the huge chimney which rises di
rectly back of the Gymnasium.
This chimney is 87 feet in height,
12 feet square at the base, and has
a diameter of 5 feet at the top.
The large furnaces which will heat
the water for the swimming-plunge,
showers, etc., will be connected
with this chimney, and the object
ionable smoke and gases will be
carried away in a cleanly and sani
tary manner. The new chimney is
built entirely of brick, and is only
a little smaller than the power
house chimney.
The retaining - wall running
around the sides and rear of the
Gymnasium building has been fin
ished, and the roof over the build
ing is close to completion. The
general work on the building has
been delayed owing to the diffi
culty experienced by the contract
ors in obtaining the two eight-ton
"lintel" stones; but is believed that
the right kind have been found, and
there is strong hope that the Gym
nasium will be completed in con
tract time.
