# Mrs. Stanford in New York.
## 
### 
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford is now
visiting in New York, and her stay
in that city may be prolonged for
several weeks. Until her return
no plans for the laying of the cor
ner stone of the new Library build
ing will be made; so it is probable
that the ceremonies attending the
dedication of the structure will not
take place until next semester.
Work on the building is proceed
ing rapidly, and the first section of
the outer walls is now in position.
