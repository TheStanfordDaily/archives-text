# INTERCLASS DEBATE.
## Freshmen Will Select the Question and Sophomores Will Have Choice of Sides. 
### 
The Freshman and Sophomore
debating teams met this afternoon
and made final arrangements for
the coining interclass debate. In
order that the teams may work dur
ing the holidays it was decided to
select the question and choose sides
as soon as possible. Accordingly
the Freshman team will present a
question for discussion within the
next two weeks, and the Sopho
mores will then be given several
days to select the side they wish to
advocate.
In regard to the time of holding
the debate no definite action was
taken. A challenge has been re
ceived from California for an inter
collegiate Freshman debate, and
this matter will be presented im
mediately to the faculty committee
for consideration. If the proposal
is accepted the interclass debate
will have to be held much earlier
than usual, perhaps the first week
of next semester. Hence the
necessity for completing all ar
rangements before the closing of
college. Even if the California
proposition is considered there will
be no thought of doing away with
the Freshman-Sophomore debate.
As soon as the faculty committee
takes action on the California prop
osition, the date for the interclass
contest will be selected. The
judges will be chosen by the ex
ecutive committee of the Inter
society Debating League.
