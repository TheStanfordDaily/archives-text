# ENTERTAINMENTS PLANNED.
## Faculty Committee Will Schedule Several Good Attractions for Next Semester. 
### 
The Faculty Entertainment Com
mittee is negotiating with a num
ber of excellent companies with the
intention of hooking them for per
formances next semester. At pres
ent they have lines on many ex
cellent shows which are coming to
the Coast this winter and next
spring. Among these are Pader
ewski, the world-famed pianist;
Kreisler, the celebrated Viennese
violinist, who is considered the
greatest in his line; Anton Hek
king, a renowned viol incellist;
Bispham, the baritone who has
long been connected with the Met
ropolitan Opera House of New-
York City. Bispham will be re
membered by many as the leading
baritone who accompanied Schu
mann-Heinck here three years ago.
Another strong attraction which
the committee is makihg efforts to
bill is the Kreisel quartet of Bos
ton —the best known string quartet
in the country. They have played
together for years, and this long
practice, coupled with their natural
musical ability, has enabled them
to develop a technique which is
unsurpassed by none. Mme. Melba
will also be brought here for a con
cert if arrangements can be com
pleted. Definite announcement
will be made in a few days as to
just what concerts can be arranged
for.
The hardest obstacle which con
fronts the committee is the finan
cial proposition. All these star
performers demand a guarantee
which it is almost impossible to
raise in a community the size of
Stanford. Last year this difficulty
was surmounted by securing
pledges from the students for a suf
ficient amount to cover expenses.
At the conclusion of the season
$-100 yet remained uncollected; and
the committee would have been
held for the deficit, had it not been
for the fortunate financial outcome
of several concerts. The commit
tee does not feel justified in taking
any personal risk in the matter,
but rather than lose the attractions
they are trying to devise some plan
whereby the guarantees can be
raised.
There are a number of other con
certs which are assured, such as
the Royal Italian Band. These do
not demand a guarantee, but are
willing to come on a percentage
basis.
