# FRESHMEN VS. PALO ALTO.
## First-Year Men to Play High School on the Diamond Saturday. 
### 
A game has been arranged be
tween the baseball team of the Palo
Alto high school and the Freshmen,
the contest to take place Saturday
afternoon on the Varsity diamond.
This will be the third game this se
mester for the Freshmen, the first
year men having won and lost a
game with the Faculty nine.
The Palo Alto high school team
has a good record, having won the
academic championship last season,
and will prove a strong opponent
for the Freshmen. Last year's
Freshman team defeated Palo Alto
early in the season by the score of
14 to 12.
The men who will play against
Palo Alto will be chosen from the
candidates who turn out for the
game. About thirty-live Freshmen
turned out for the games with the
faculty, but scarcely half a dozen
have appeared for fall practice.
The game with Palo Alto was ar
ranged so that Captain Trowbridge
could get a line on the baseball ma
terial in the class, and to arouse in
terest in the sport.
A few new men appeared on the
diamond yesterday afternoon and
joined the small squad out for fall
baseball practice. The men were
put through practice similar to that
engaged in on the first day. Sharp
fielding was the main feature, and
many of the men handled them
selves well for the first of the season.
The players were in two squads,
as usual, one scattered around the
infield, and the other in the outfield.
The balls knocked into the outfield
were difficult to judge, owing to the
dark sky.
Captain Trowbridge was at his
old position of shortstop, and Col
bert was on first base, they being
the only Varsity men out. There
are about two men trying for each
position in the infield, and about
ten men are trying for the three
positions in the outfield.
