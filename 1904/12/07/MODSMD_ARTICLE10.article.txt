The matter of securing a base
ball coach for the coming season is
now occupying the attention of
student body oflicials, and at
tempts are being made to sign
some former Varsity player. Other
things being equal, there can be*no
doubt that a graduate coach is
preferable to a professional. Last
year we had a league player for
coach, and before the season was
over bis contract expired, and he
left the squad to sign up with a
professional team, if it bad not
been for the fact that J. F. Lana
gan came to the rescue for the re
mainder of the season the team
would have been without a coach.
This year we ought not take the
same chance unless it be as a last
resort. There have been Varsity
players who understand the
game as well as any pro
fessional who can be secured,
and if one of them by any means
can be induced to accept the po
sition it would seem that his services
should be engaged. By signing a
graduate we would not only avoid
the possibility of having no coach
at the end of the season, but we
would also have a man who would
take more than a pecuniary interest
in his position. A Stanford man as
coach will want to see Stanford win,
not alone because he draws a salary,
but because he himself is a Stan
ford man.
