# Baseball Coach.
## 
### 
No coach for the baseball squad
has been selected as yet, but Man
ager R. W. Barrett is still negoti
ating with that end in view. The
first man considered for the po
sition was J. F. Lanagan, '00, who
proved his efficiency as a baseball
coach by his work with the team
during three weeks of last year's
season. Lanagan found it impos
sible to take the necessary time
from his teaching duties at Bel
mont, and be was compelled to de
cline the offer. Since that time
Barrett has been corresponding
with other former Varsity baseball
players with the view of engaging
a graduate coach, but thus far no
definite arrangements have been
made. If a graduate coach can
not be secured it is probable that a
coach will be engaged from the
members of one of the professional
teams of the Pacific Coast League.
