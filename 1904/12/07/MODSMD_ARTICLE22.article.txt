# YALE FACES BIG DEFICITS.
## Authorities of the University May Have to Raise Tuition Fees. 
### 
The somber and vexing question
of deficits is just now engaging the
attention of the authorities of Yale
University. The balance in ar
rears for the year ending July 30,
1904, in the consolidated income
and expense account, is $42,000, not
including any figures for the din
ing hall, and other non-instruc
tive plants; in the university ac
count $18,000; in the academic de
partment $13,000; in the theologi
cal school $2,500; in the art school
$1,000; and in the music school
about the same. The other depart
ments either run ahead, or nearly
equalize revenue and expense —the
good financial management of the
scientific school being especially
noteworthy in view of the size and
varied sources of expense of that
expanding institution. In the ac
counts of university plants, those
of the dining-hall will, for obvious
reasons, draw instant attention.
Its running deficit now mounts up
to $69,000; its deficit for the year
is $22,000. But this last deficit
was incurred during the first half
of the college year, and since then
Captain Smoke has made self-sup
porting an institution which had
become an intolerable drain on the
university income. The university
library is more than $1,500 ahead
for the year. Deficits in the gym
nasium and the carpentry and
steam departments are explained
officially either by exceptional cost
of improvements or by a "debit"
period at which the accounts hap
pen to be taken —the two latter de
partments, it is stated, actually
showing a s.urplus.
The continued deficits do not by
any means spell a financial crisis,
but they are serious and unpleas
ant, says the Yale Alumni News.
Tliev are not less so as following a
gapof some $200,000 in the Bicen
tennial building funds, which had
to be extinguished for the most
part from realty mortgage funds
which, continued, would have car
ried a good interest rate. These
recurring deficits must be faced
and filled. Of suggested plans,
that of raising the price of tuition
should only be adopted as a last
resort. It would bear hard on the
general principle of Yale democ
racy, and specifically on that valu
able class of students which is just
outside of the self-help and free
tuition groups. The theory of stern
and positive economy —as dis
tinguished, of course, from check
ing wastage —runs counter to the
law of university growth, which is
as inexorable as that of Kepler. It
would be like checking the natural
yearly growth of the Yale Oak.
What the situation cries for is a
large addition to general and free
funds, especially those for univer
sity use. The Harrison legacy of
$100,000 is a good starter, but its
added income is only a fraction of
the needed increment of revenue.
