# NEXT YEAR'S OUTLOOK.
## Football Material Available for Stanford and California Varsities in 1905. 
### 
Although Stanford will lose six
of the players who faced Califor
nia in the last intercollegiate foot
ball game, the prospect for a win
ning team next year is not at ail
discouraging. Perhaps at no time
in the history of Stanford football
has a stronger second eleven been
developed than the one which gave
the Varsity such splendid practice
this year. Several men on this
eleven were but a shade inferior to
their successful rivals, and the
game against Colorado demon
strated that the presence of three
of these substitutes in the Varsity
line-up did not materially weaken
the team.
Of the six players who have
played their last game of football
for the Cardinal, three —Clark, Dole,
and Bansbach —are debarred by
the intercollegiate agreement, which
states that no athlete of either uni
versity shall represent his college
for more than four years. Clark
and Bansbach have played foot
ball for four years, while Dole has
represented ihe Cardinal one year
on the track and three on the grid
iron. Butterfield, Thompson, and
Shields are still eligible to play
against California, but these play
ers graduate next spring, and it is
not probable that they will return
for graduate work.
Bansbach's great work at the
quarter-back position will he con
tinued by Stott, who played the
greater portion of the game against
California this year. If his play
continues to develop at the present
rate Stott promises to become one
of the greatest quarters ever pro
duced at Stanford. The return of
Weller and Chalmers will leave
only one place in the backfield to
lie filled, and unless unexpectedly
strong material enters next year
the tight for the vacant half-back
position will be between Brennan
and Crow. Brennan's offensive
work this season was exceptionally
brilliant, and an increase in his de
fensive playing will make him the
equal of any man in the backfield.
Crow played substitute half-back
on the University of California
freshman team last year. Al
though not eligible for the Stan
ford team this year, he played a
very faithful game throughout the
season on the second eleven. His
heady aggressive playing in the
Colorado game was a revelation to
those who had not ciosely watched
his playing in the preliminary
campus games. Crow played full
back in the Denver game after
Weller's retirement, but his regular
position is at half-back.
By the graduation of Thompson
the Cardinal loses one of its most
valuable line men. In both the
California and Colorado games he
consistently outplayed his op
ponent. Should Van Sickle return
to college next year Thompson's
place at left guard will he accept
ably filled. Van Sickle was in the
Colorado game only a short time
before he was compelled to retire
on account of a badly fractured
arm, but during that time he

demonstrated that he is a Varsity
guard.
Horton's playing at Denver
stamps him as the most logical
successor of Shields at right tackle.
Horton is lacking in experience,
but he has the weight, grit, and
head necessary for the develop
ment of a good tackle.
For four years G. H. Clark has
played left end with credit to him
self and his college, and his absence
from the line-up next year will he
felt. Stanford is fortunate, how
ever, in the possession of a number
of candidates for the vacant po
sition who are above the ordinary
in ability. Besides several good
second-team players Smith and
Bartell, both Varsity men, will
contest for the place.
With Hyde at center, Roosevelt
at right guard, Sprott at left
tackle, and West at right end, next
year's team with its additional
coaching ought to prove itself al
most equal to the brilliant eleven
which represented the Cardinal
this season.
Of the eighteen men who played
against Stanford in this year's in
tercollegiate game fifteen are still
eligible to represent the Blue and
Gold. With this veteran nucleus
for a team California expects to
turn out an eleven next year which
will be far superior to the one
which Stanford defeated on No
vember 12th.
Only three men of the eighteen
are debarred by the intercollegiate
agreement from again participating
in a football game against Stan
ford. Captain Stroud closed bis
fourth year on California's football
team this fall. Heitmuller played
on the varsity baseball team in his
freshman year, and this with three
years as tackle on the football
eleven renders him ineligible for
further participation in intercol
legiate matches. It will be ex
tremely difficult to fill these two
players' places on the line, for they
are men of endurance and experi
ence. Lasater, who took Sperry's
place at full-back,is a graduate and
could only play one year.
But even without these veterans
California will be able to start the
season with a complete team.
Haffey will probably go in at
guard, and Gray or Kerr will make
left tackle. Despite severe injuries
Gray played a good game at guard
this year, and Kerr, who replaced
Stern at the other guard position,is
a freshman of promise. Captain
elect Force will play at right
tackle, and another season's play
should make him a superior line
man. His grit was demonstrated
by the terrific hammering to which
he submitted without flinching
during the big game.
Stern will play right guard, and
Elliott and Kittrelle the end po
sitions. These two ends are both
former backs, and their work has
been far superior to that of the
other candidates for the positions.
They are almost sure of their
places on next year's varsity. Fos
ter, who played guard for a short
time in the big game, will make an
acceptable substitute for either
guard or tackle.
California's backfield will return
intact for next season. Snedigar

and Kern, left and righthalf-backs;
Sperry, full-back; and Boothe,
quarter-back. Mead and White at
half-back, and Boynton at full
back will make efficient substi
tutes.
