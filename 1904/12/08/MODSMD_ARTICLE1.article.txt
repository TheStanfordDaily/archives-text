# ENGLISH CLUB MEETS.
## Officers for Next Semester Elected. Many New Members Added. 
### 
The English Club held its last
meeting for this semester last night
at the Alpha Phi house. Before
the regular program of the evening
was taken up officers for next se
mester were elected, and a report
was received from the executive
committee placing thirteen names
in nomination for membership in
the club.
H. A. Moran, '05, who waselected
to succeed D. M. Reynolds, '05, as
president, has been prominent in
college literary work, as well as in
the work of the English Club, for
the past few years, holding the po
sition of associate editor on the
staff of the Sequoia. He is also
identified with the Young Men's
Christian Association, and is a
member of the Delta Upsilon fra
ternity. Miss J. S. Boynton, '06,
was elected to fill the office of vice
president, and P. C. Edwards, '08,
was elected secretary-treasurer.
Professor R. M. Alden of the Eng
lish department was also appointed
to serve on the executive commit
tee, as faculty member.
The following new members were
admitted to the club: Mr. H. J.
Hall, instructor in English, Mr. F.
H. White, instructor in English;
Miss A. P. Cooper, gr.; Miss A. G.
Hall, '05; Miss G. M. Henry, '05,
L. W. Cutler, '06, Miss R. H. Gil
bert, '06, Miss M. E. Gregg, '06. J.
Nibley, '06, Miss M. H. Pedlar, '06,
Miss C. Soule, '06, and \V. G. Bey
mer, '07. Miss K. A. Chandler
was elected an honorary member.
A report from the chairman of
the play committee was listened
to. The report contained sugges
tions to the effect that the two
dates for the play should be March
9th and 11th, and that one-half of
the proceeds should be given to the
Boat Club, although it was to be
distinctly understood that the play
is in no sense to be considered as
being given for the benefit of that
organization. Both of these sug
gestions were adopted.
The amendments to the constitu
tion, which were held over from the
last meeting, were read and passed
with a single exception. An ob
jection was made to the wording of
the clause limiting the number of
active members to fifty. The
change proposed was that there
should be fifty undergraduate
members, and when this had been
made the amendment was passed.
By this amendment the club will
be allowed to have fifty undergrad
uate members, and at the same
time retain in active membership
all graduate members who may be
living in the community and who
hand their names to the secretary.
A copy of the entire set of amend
ments was published in the Daily
Palo Alto two weeks ago.
The regular program of the even
ing was a discussion of Ben Jon
son's "Every Man in His Hu
mour." Professor R. M. Alden
spoke briefly on the subject. Af
ter giving a short outline of the
plot Professor Alden said in part:
"Every Man in His Humour" is
a representative of the third type

of Elizabethan plays. Its produc
tion on the Stanford stage will
therefore make complete the cycle
of Elizabethan performances which
have been given at the University,
Beginning with Shakspere, we have
had the Ben Greet plays; secondly,
the "Knightof the Burning Pestle"
represented Beaumont and Fletcher
at their best; and now, finally, we
have what Swinburne considers to
have been by far the best work of
Ben J orison, the other great play
wright of the period. For this rea
son, and also because of the genius
with which the plot and the char
acters are worked out, there should
be an equal if not a greater chance
for success than in the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle," in spite of the
better opportunities for stage action
which that possessed."

have what Swinburne considers to
have been by far the best work of
Ben J orison, the other great play
wright of the period. For this rea
son, and also because of the genius
with which the plot and the char
acters are worked out, there should
be an equal if not a greater chance
for success than in the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle," in spite of the
better opportunities for stage action
which that possessed."
