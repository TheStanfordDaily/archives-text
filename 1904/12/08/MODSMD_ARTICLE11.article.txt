The question of awarding sweat
ers to the second team men who
were not on the sidelines at the
last intercollegiate football game
will be considered at the next meet
ing of the Athletic Committee, and
it would seem only just that some
recognition he made of the faithful
work which a number of these men
contributed throughout the entire
season. Because there happened
to be this year a larger number of
substitutes than usual does not ap
pear to be a sufficient reason for de
priving other players of the second
eleven emblem. The white German
"S" signifies that the wearer has
been a candidate for a Varsity team,
and that his efforts have been his
best. That there are at least a few
football men who come within these
qualifications, and who have not
yet been rewarded, is undoubted;
and it would seem that the distinc
tiveness of the emblem would not
be lessened by granting it to the
candidates who came near the line
that divides them from the list of
substitutes.
