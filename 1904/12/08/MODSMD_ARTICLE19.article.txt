# WANTS FOOTBALL MORE OPEN.
## Radical Changes in Methods Urged by a Harvard Lover of the Sport. 
### 
The Boston Herald publishes an
open letter to Walter Camp on the
football situation, by J. Mott Hal
lowell, Harvard '88, and the real
pith of his letter is the concluding
paragraph, in which he says: "Be
ing, I trust, privileged as a re
spectable alumnus of a respectable
university, and, I believe, represent
ing a large proportion of the lovers
of the game, I ask you to do away
with these overdone, overcoached,
pile-driving machines which are
now annually served up for our ap
plause. We are tired of this con
test of ponderous tortoises. Give
the hare a chance." He summar
izes the faults with the present game
as follows:
"1. The element of concentrated
brute force is allowed to play too
important a part in the winning of
games. The effort now of a success
ful coach is to weld eleven men to
gether iiito a compact battering
ram. This battering ram is di
rected by the quarter-back at the
most vulnerable points in the op
ponents' defence. The team which
in its machine-like regularity most
resembles a pile-driver can win nine
times out of ten.
"2. This maximizing the element
of brute force limits the possible
players on an eleven (with the ex
ception of a few positions) to a com
paratively small number of under
graduates, to wit, to those weighted
down with the most beef. The light,
active, wiry man, whose brilliant
tackling, running and dodging add
fascination to the scene, has little
place in the modern rush-line. He
has not the weight to be of sufficient
use in either assisting or resisting
the fateful, monotonous, stupid,and,
when properly executed, irresistible
strokes of the present style of play.
The game, instead of being limited
to beef, ought to be open to an en
tire university. It should be a stu
dent recreation, open to all.
<4 3. Moreover, the value of the
bruisers of sufficient muscle and
avoirdupois is now so unduly em
phasized, and the supply of requis
ite material is therefore so limited,
that a premium is placed thereby
upon a desirable feature which now
exists to a great extent, to wit, upon
efforts to rake over the preparatory
schools and scour the country for
suitable material. If "material"
was not so limited the competition
for it would not be so keen. It is
the ordinary law of supply and de
mand.
"4. In order to weld together the
different parts of this humanized
pile-driver the undergraduates who
are selected to form a part of the
machine are, by the difficulty of the
problem, required to put an amount
of time, practice and study upon it
wholly disproportionate to the im
portance of the game. It ought to
be an athletic recreation; it is now
almost an athletic business.
"5. The game developed by the
above method is so massed that it
becomes stupid and uninteresting.
I still remember with thrills of de
light, although a backer of the
Crimson, the days when ''Snake"
Ames and your own white haired
Laurie Bliss and McClung used, like
winged Mercury?, to carry their
colors on to victory, while 30,000
people rent the air with thundering
spontaneous shouts only excelled in
electrical effect by the brilliancy of j

the play before them. Now instead,
when 1 witness a big game, I nee
4,400 pounds of beef shoving each
other around the field a few yards
at a time, while carefully instructed
undergraduates under mathemati
cal leaders cheer on the heterogene
ous pile in order to spirit into it.
"6. And lastly, the present
method eliminates the undergradu
ate to an unfortunate extent and
turns the game into a contest among
coaches. The mechanic who can
produce the finished machines
which now play the big games of
the year must not only be a skilled
master of his trade, but must have
under him an able corps of super
intendents and second hands. To
the head coach belongs most of the
credit of victory. On him rests the
blame of defeat."
Hallowell suggests a plan for
opening up the game, which seems
to be at least feasible. It is as
follows:
"The field is now marked off by
five-yard lines running across it.
Lay out similar linen running
lengthwise down the field, but only
four yards apart. Preserve the same
rules as to offside play which exist
now, but also provide that when
the ball is putin play after a down
the men shall not line up in close
formation as they do now. Instead,
pass a rule enacting that at the
moment when the ball is putin
play only one player on the same
team shall be standing in any one
of the quadrangles formed by these
lines. Two umpires on each side
could easily see that this rule was
observed. Other rules regulating
the method of putting the ball in
play, and possibly the position of
the hacks, would likewise have to
be passed. But these are matters of
detail which undoubtedly could be
worked out.
"With the field thus broken up
when the ball is putin play, and
ihe possibilities for long passes,
«jnick dodging runs, and brilliant
tackling in the open, the impor
tance <>112 mere avoirdupois would
lie minimized, — and brute shoving
power ought to be of less impor
tance than individal brilliancy. The
yame would be open to the men who
'•ught to play it —to the light-weight
men of nerve, and dash, and skill,
iind whose contests exceed in inter
est those of the present beefy con
glomeration by about as much :is a
race between thoroughbred horses
exceeds in interest a race between
steam rollers."
