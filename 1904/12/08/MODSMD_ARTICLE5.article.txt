# Sweaters Awarded.
## 
### 
At the last meeting of the Ath
letic Committee Becond team sweat
ers bearing the black German "S"
were awarded to the men who were
in suits on the sidelines at the big
game. The measurements of the
men were taken yesterday, and the
sweaters will arrive in a few days.
The players who received sweaters
are: L. Bogle, '05, J. F. Brennan,
'07, F. W. Haselwood, '05, H. L.
Horton, '08, J. G. Nissen, '06, J. J.
Monzingo, '05, A. B. Packard, '07,
A. E. Preston, '05, G. W. Smith,
'06, J. N. Stanford, '06, A. L. Trow
bridge, '05, T. Van Sickle, '05, and
S. B. Thompson, '07.
The question of awarding second
team sweaters to other second team
players will be brought up at the
next meeting of the Athletic Com
mittee. The number of men in
suits on the sidelines was larger
this year than usual, and as there
were thirteen substitute sweaters
awarded, some members of the com
mittee thought this number of
sweaters was all that should be
awarded. However, it is probable
that the committee will grant a
few additional second team sweat
ers bearing a white German "S."
