### 
After a long wait and much ser
ious consideration all authorities
have finally agreed to a debate be
tween Nevada and a Stanford sec
ond team next semester. This mat
ter has been under consideration
ever since the early part of October,
when the University Debating Club
opened negotiations with Nevada.
A favorable reply was shortly re
ceived from the debating manager
at Nevada, who also requested that
Stanford suggest the time and place.
The matter was immediately put
before the faculty committee on lit
erary contests, and their decision
has just been received. The com
mittee gave the proposition serious

consent, because of the failure of
several second team debates in the
past- This decision by the faculty
committee now makes the contest a
certainty since all the members of
the student committee are favor
able. Final arrangements are now
being made, and definite announce
ment of the details of the contest
will be made before the end of the
semester.
The University Debating Club,
which meets to-morrow, will pass
on the advisability of holding a
Freshman intercollegiate debate
