It is to be hoped that the organ
izations and committees which
control the debating policy of the
University will give the most thor
ough consideration to the proposal
for an intercollegiate Freshman de
bate before they take any final
action in the matter. Just at
present there seems to be special
enthusiasm for contests between
the first-year men of the two uni
versities. We have long had fresh
man football; in a few weeks we
will see our first freshman baseball
game, and a track meet has been
proposed. Of the benefit of these
athletic forms of intercollegiate
freshman activity there can be no
question. The teams are made up
of men who have received proper
and adequate Stanford training,
and they will represent the best
Stanford can put forward. But de
bating is something of a different
nature, and an intercollegiate con
test between freshmen would often
be little more than a high school
debate under the University's
name. The freshmen as debaters
are usually quite immature, and
they are not at once taken up by
the big debating organizations
which do so much to polish off their
rough edges. It is not always the
best debaters of the class who com
pose the team chosen to meet soph
omores. This is not a fault of the
judges, nor is it intended as a criti
cism of them. It means simply
that the best that is in debaters is
brought out only after considerable
training and coaching by the de
bating organizations, and by those
members of the faculty who give
special attention to such work. It
may be possible to develop in a
few months a freshman debating
team that will be truly representa
tive â€” that is a matter for those in
authority to decide; but it would
seem to be a question open to very
serious consideration. Even if such
a contest tends to bring out more
freshman debaters, will it be worth
while?
