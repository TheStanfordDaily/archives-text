Worlc on the Chaucer Dictionary
which was commenced last sum
mer is now being carried on by Dr.
Ewald Fliigel, Mh E. K. Putnam,
and Mr. E. P. Anderson of the
English department, and Miss A.
YV. Kimball, '04, and Miss G.
Mason.
Mr. Putnam and Mr. Anderson
are making a collection of slips for
the Canterbury Tales. This will
be made complete for the seven
texts which are being published by
the Chaucer Society. When these
are finished the same kind of work
will be don'e for Chaucer's other
poems. Miss Mason and Miss
Kimball are engaged in making
additions to and in arranging al
phabetically the immense collec
tion of Middle English and Old
French words gleaned from all
available sources, and all brought
together for the purpose of illus
trating Chaucer's usage.
Professor Fliigel, who is super
vising the work in all its details,
expects to go to Europe sometime
during the coming year for the
purpose of making a close exami
nation of the unpublished or par
tially published manuscripts of
Chaucer.
