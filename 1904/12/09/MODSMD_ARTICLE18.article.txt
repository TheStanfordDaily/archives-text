### 
The work of completing the mo
saics in the interior of Memorial
Church is progressing slowly. The
artists have been putting up de
signs in the balconies in the east
and west transepts. Four small
designs have been finished in the
balconies: two of them over the en
trances, and two corresponding to
them on the opposite walls. Each
of these is a representation of three
angels, the four designs portraying
them in different attitudes. At
present the artists are at work in
the east transept, where they are
putting in small patterns. The
mosaic will be placed in position
as rapidly as it arrives from Ven
ice.
