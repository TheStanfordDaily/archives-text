# Botanical Society Meets.
## 
### 
The Botanical Society held its
last meeting for the semester yes
terday at 4 o'clock in the library
of the Botany building. The
meeting was well attended, and
from the large number of those
present it is evident that the club
has taken a permanent place in
the first four months of its exist
ence.
Before the regular program was
taken up, considerable business
was transacted the most important
of which consisted of the election
of honorary members from the fac
ulty of the Zoology and Botany de
partments. The following were
elected: Professor W. R. Dudley,
Professor D. H. Campbell, Mr.
P. H. Olsson-Seffer and Mr. A. A.
Lawson.
Owing to lack of time only two
of the papers scheduled were read.
A paper on "Diffusion and Osmotic
Pressure in the Plant Cell," was
read by R. M. Holman, '07, and
one by Miss M. E. Moulton, '04, on
"The Smyrna Fig in California."
The hitter paper brought out some
interesting facts on the caprifica
tion of the Smyrna fig and the de
velopment to which it has been
brought in California.
