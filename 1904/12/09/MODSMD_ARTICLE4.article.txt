sionary intelligence and deepening
conviction among students. There
will also be meetings of the Student
Volunteers, and an institute on the
problems of the home field. Every
evening the whole conference will
come together to listen to strong
speeches on the "Opportunity for
Christian Service in Different Life-
Callings."
Recreation will be had in a series
of athletic events between the differ
ent delegations. There will also
be good opportunities for tennis
and golf.
