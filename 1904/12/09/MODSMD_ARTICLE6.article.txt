# GRADUATE STUDENTS' CLUB.
## Entertainment at Home of President and Mrs. Jordan Thursday Evening, December 15th. 
### 
The postgraduate students in
the University will meet at the
home of President and Mrs. Jor
dan Thursday evening, December
15th,when the constitution recently
adopted at an organization meeting
of the Graduate Students' Club
will be presented for the signatures
of all graduate students who desire
to become charter members of the
club.
The program for entertainment
for the meeting is in the hands of a
committee, which will have no an
nouncement to make public until
next week.
It has been a personal wish of
President Jordan's for some time
that the graduate students should
be organized, and now a consider
able number have become so inter
ested in the purposes of such a
club, especially in relation to its
immediate place in Stanford life,
as to effect an organization. The
executive committee, composed of
the officers of the club who were
elected two weeks ago, is making a
personal canvass of all the gradu
ate students in the community, in
the effort to stir up a large attend
ance at the charter membership
meeting next Thursday evening.
Various motives have operated
in the effecting of this organization,
among them being the working out
of the Stanford spirit in meeting a
need in the University, as well as
in responding to a strong desire on
the part of President Jordan; the
furnishing of opportunity for stu
dents in one department to become
acquainted somewhat with,what is
being done in other departments,
and thus broadening their culture
views and interests; the widening
of acquaintanceships and friend
ships among research workers,
which may be better appreciated
later in life when the scholarship
of the future is in the hands of the
students of the present; the fur
thering of the interests of graduate
students in relation to the Univer
sity; and the bringing of Stan
ford University into line with other
large institutions of learning in the
United States, in which there are
already organized clubs of the
graduate students hound by a gen
eral organization.
Beyond the advantages which
such a club offers to its members
as individuals, and besides the de
sirability of having Stanford re
spond with the large universities of
the country, the immediate need in
Stanford life for such an organiza
tion may vary in its nature from
year to year, and its place in the
community determined in a meas
ure by changing membership and
altering conditions. In any case
the club may always meet the need
of being the appropriate organiza
tion for the introduction of pub
lic lecturers of a certain class.
The members of the executive
committee are desirous of knowing
how many of the graduate students
will attend the charter membership
meeting at the home of President
Jordan, in order to know what
number to prepare for in entertain

ment. Besides the signing of the
constitution, a requisite to mem
bership in the club is the payment
of a nominal semester due, which
the following members of the ex
ecutive committee are desirous of
collecting, if possible, before next
Thursday: Miss A. P. Cooper, Miss
B. Montgomery, Miss B. K. Free
man, F. W. Powell, and G. S.
Gibbs. G. S. Gibbs, President.
