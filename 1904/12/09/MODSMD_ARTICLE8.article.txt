# FRESHMEN TO PLAY.
## Last Game of the Semester for the First-Year Squad To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
The Freshmen will play the Palo
Alto high school team to-morrow
afternoon on the Varsity diamond
at 3. This game, like the two
former contests which the Fresh
men have played, will be in the
nature of a try-out for the baseball
men in the class. The match will be
important, as this will probably be
the last time this semester to form
an idea of the material from which
to develop a nine next year.
Though the Palo Alto team has
practiced but little during the fall,
the men who will represent the
high school are mainly the same
players who won the Academic
championship last spring. The
fact that these men have played
together before will aid them ma
terially to-morrow.
The Freshmen have shown that
they have two or three men cap
able of pitching good ball, and with
fair support they should play a
close game. The hitting of the
men has not been of a high order
in their previous games, and the
team will probably be weak in this
department.
If the present rainstorm con
tinues, rendering the diamond too
soft to play upon, the match will
be postponed until next week.
Line-up of the Palo Alto team fol
lows: Pomeroy, pitcher; Tomasini,
catcher; P. A mot, first base; Jor
dan, second base; Sloan, third base;
Bromfield, short-stop; Clark, left
field; Soper, center field; C. Arnot,
right field.
Batting practice was engaged in
last evening by the men out for
fall training. Two players were
kept at the bat, new men taking
their places every few minutes, un
til the entire squad had had a
chance at hitting. Besides the
batting practice, the regular field
ing practice was also given atten
tion.
