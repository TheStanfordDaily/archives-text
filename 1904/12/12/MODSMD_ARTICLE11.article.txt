The facts printed in another
column concerning student body
finances and the amount of money
turned over to the Training-House
Corporation, give the result of what
has been one of the best years, from
a financial standpoint, that the
student body has ever experienced.
The increase in receipts at the
intercollegiate football game ac
counts in part for the balances on
hand. The item of rent, which has
heretofore been paid for a football
field in San Francisco, was removed
this year, and that also accounts
for part of the profits. But to
whatever causes we may attribute
our profits this year, the important
factor of careful management can
not be given too much considera
tion. The funds have been handled
judiciously and to the best pur
poses, and while no activity has
been deprived of necessaries, there
has been an economical administra
tion. This is especially brought
before us when we notice the un
usually large amount accruing from
student body dues. Has this re
sulted from a sudden change in the
spirit of those supposed to pay
dues, or has it been the result of
activity on the part of those to
whose efforts the work of collection
has been intrusted? We believe
that it may be attributed largely to
the latter. In any event, results
are what we have wanted. They
are before us, and they speak for
themselves.
