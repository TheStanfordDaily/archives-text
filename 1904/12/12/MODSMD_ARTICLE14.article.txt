# INDIANS DEFEAT OLYMPICS.
## Heitmuller, Kern and Howard of California Play on the Club Team. 
### 
The Sherman Indians won from
the Olympic clubmen in Los An
geles Saturday. The score was 16
to 07 and represents the relative
merits of the two teams. Not a
point in the score was made by
chance, although one touch-down
was made by Lugo when Williams
blocked a kick. The fact that the
Indians, both before and after this
play, earned many more yards than
did their opponents evens up the
account that might otherwise be
unbalanced.
The prediction that the Indians
would meet resistance worthy of
the name was fulfilled. For every
inch of ground gained by the vic
torious eleven there was a hitter
struggle, and more often than not
it took the full three downs to make
distance. On several occasions the
Indians broke away from their op
ponents, but there was always a
fleet white man on the alert to
haul down the runner before he
had gotten far. The Olympicclub
men played ball of a class not
usually seen here. On every play,
offensive and defensive, the whole
eleven was in action.
But the result of poor training
told. Every few minutes some one
would gave way to the strain and
there would be a hole made.
Through the hole, like a catapult,
a brave would leap —some one
had failed, and some one else had
to retrieve the honors lost by pull
ing down the runner yards away
in the backlield.
It was a spectacular game. In
the second half it resolved itself
into a kicking match between Heit
muller, the Berkeley tackle, and
little Neafus, the idol of Southern
California football players. In this
duel the honors were about even.
Dinsmose was the star of the day
when it came to tackling. For the
first time this year scientific, hard,
low tackling that rolled the runner
back, no matter what his speed,
was seen when Dinsmore worked.
The officials were poor. There
was much off-side play, several
faulty rulings and a generally un
satisfactory condition of play.
The teams lined up as follows:
