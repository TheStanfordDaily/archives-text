# FRESHMEN DEFEATED.
## Palo Alto Wins a Close Nine-Inning Game by the Score of 4 to 3. 
### 
The Freshmen were defeated by
Palo Alto high school on Saturday
by the score of 4to 3. The teams
were evenly matched, and the game
became a pitchers' battle, Pomeroy
and Tomasini of Palo Alto having
the better of it.
Both teams scored once in the
opening inning, and Palo Alto
scored two more in the third. The
Freshmen tied the score in the
fourth, but their opponents suc
ceeded in getting what proved to be
the winning run in the fifth. Dur
ing the remaining four innings
neither Bide came near scoring and
the feature of the game was the
work of the pitchers.
The Palo Alto battery, consisting
of Tomasini and Pomeroy, was
largely responsible for the victory
of their team. These players alter
nated as pitcher and catcher, Pom
eroy going into the box during the
latter half of the game, and proving
the more effective. Tomasini struck
out six of the Freshman batters,
while Pomeroy retired eight of his
opponents. Though weak at the
bat, Palo Alto proved stronger than
the first-year men.
The squad of Freshmen that
turned out for the game contained
better material than has been pres
ent at the two previous contests.
During the match an entire new
team was substituted for the men
that first entered the game, and
this second team played better
ball than the first. But the entire
squad seems to contain a large
number of candidates of nearly

equal ability, which should make
the fight for places spirited.
Of the five or six men, any one
of whom may eventually fill the
pitcher's position, three were tried
Saturday. Holcombeand Menardi
pitched good ball, but Theile proved
the most effective, striking out six
men. The majority of the men
fielded well, the only sensational
feature being a lucky catch by
Fen ton.
