# BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY FORMED.
## Organization Started Which Will Bring Biological Students of California and Stanford Together. 
### 
An organization under the name
of the Pacific Coast Biological So
ciety was founded last Saturday in
San Francisco. The membership
of this society will be limited to
persons who are actively engaged
in Biological research on this
Coast, and who belong to the
Biological departments of Stanford,
California, or any of the minor
colleges. Their category includes
the departments of Botany, Physi
ology, Psychology, Anatomy, His
tology, Paleontology, and Zoology.
Plans for a similar organization
were entered into last spring, but
were not carried out fully. The
society's purpose is to bring to
gether men who are doing work in
this branch of science, and to en
courage the study of Biology on
the Pacific Coast. Meetings will
be held four times a year in the
rooms of the San Francisco Mi
croscopic Society on Montgomery
street in San Francisco. One of
these meetings will be an all-day
session which will be taken up
with the reading of papers and the
discussion of scientific topics. The
other three will combine a social
side with the scientific.
At the meeting last Saturday the
first officers of the club were elected.
Professor H. Heath of the Stanford
Zoology department was elected
president, and Professor \V. J. V.
Osterhout of the botany depart
ment at the University of Califor
nia, secretary-treasurer.
The next meeting of the society
is scheduled to take place early
next semester, and already a num
ber of papers have been promised.
The only speaker at the meeting
last Saturday was Dr. Jacques Loeb
of the University of California, who
gave an interesting talk on "Helio
tropism in Animals.'' The lecture
was accompanied with the demon
stration of some illustrative experi
ments.
The following men have been in
strumental in bringing about the
organization of the society and are
now active members. From the Uni
versity of California —Dr. Jacques
Loeb of the physiology department;
Professors W. A. Setchell, of the
botany department; W. E. Ritter,
of the zoology department; W. J.
V. Osterhout, of the botany depart
ment; H. B. Torney, of the zoology
department; and F. W. Bancroft,
J. B. MacCollum and J. Ostwald of
the physiology department. From
Stanford —Dr. David Starr Jordan,
Professors C. H. Gilbert and Har
old Heath, of the Zoology depart
ment; 0. P. Jenkins and J. R.
Slonaker of the Physiology depart
ment; D. H. Campbell, A. A. Law
son, M. H. Spaulding and P. H.
Olsßon-Seffer, of the Botany de
partment. It is noticeable that all
except two of these men have taken
their doctor's degrees in some
branch of Biological work.
