# NO FRESHMAN DEBATE.
## University Debating Club Members Are Against Proposed Intercollegiate Contest. 
### 
At the meeting of the University
Debating Club held this afternoon
all doubt as to what would be the
outcome of the proposed intercolle
giate freshman debate with Cali
fornia was set at rest when the
members expressed themselves as
being unanimously against the
proposition. Faculty and student
members agree that such a contest
would not be beneficial or success
ful in any way. The idea Califor
nia seemed to have in mind in mak
ing the proposition was that this
should be the first of a series, and
that a debate between the freshman
classes of the two universities
should become an annual event.
With the usual Bmall interest
taken generally by the Stanford
student body in debating, and two
yearly debates now being held be
tween the universities, which are
themselves given very little atten
tion, the club did not think it would
be a wise plan to inaugurate an
other annual debate. The idea of
under-class debating is to keep de
bating interest up, and prepare the
men for Carnot and intercollegiate
teams. The general feeling was,
and especially among the faculty,
that the best material would be
brought out from both classes, and
more interest aroused under the
present system. Even if these de
bates should be held in the future,
it is settled that there will be none
this year. Two debates in one se
mester would be too much for the
Freshman team, and the quality of
both contests would suffer. The de
cision of the Stanford committee
will be communicated to California
immediately.
