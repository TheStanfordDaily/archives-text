# RHODES SCHOLARSHIP.
## Dr. Murray Explains the Conditions Under Which Examinations Will Be Held. 
### 
The Rhodes Scholarship exami
nations will be held about the mid
dle of January next. The exact
day is not yet known by the com
mittee, but an early date has been
set by the Oxford authorities in
order that successful candidates
may be at no disadvantage in the
matter of securing accommodations
in the colleges of their choice at
Oxford. Last year the examina
tions were held in April, and the
credentials of the successful candi
dates, in some cases, did not reach
the authorities in Oxford until the
lists of many of the colleges had
been closed.
Copies of last year's examination
papers may be seen in the Regis
trar's office. The papers are six in
number, and two hours is allowed
for each.
In conversation with prospective
candidates several points have
come up which deserve notice. A
statement regarding them may pre
vent misunderstanding.
First, regarding eligibility. The
statement made by the Trustees of
the Rhodes Scholarship Trust is
as follows:
(a) Students may be candidates
who shall have completed their
second year's work at some recog
nized degree-granting university or
college of the United States during
the year of election.
(b) Scholars must be unmarried:
must be citizens of the United
States, and not less than 19 nor
more than 25 years of age on Octo
ber Ist of the year in which they
are elected.
(c) Candidates may elect whether
they will apply for the scholarship
of the state in which they have ac
quired their educational qualifica
tion, or for that of the state in
which they have their private domi
cile, home or residence. They must
present themselves for examination
in the state they select. No candi
date may apply in more than one
state.
It will be noted that a difference
of opinion may well exist as to
whether or not students of gradu
ate standing are eligible, and the
actions of the committees of the
various states during the past year
have been by no means uniform,
In this state the committee ruled
that postgraduates should be con
sidered ineligible, and their decision
seems plainly te agree with the in
tentions of Mr. Rhodes, whose wish
appears to have been that young
men of capacity and of promise
should be sent rather than those
who, while unquestionably better
scholars, would be more mature
and less open 4 o formative influ
ences. Moreover, the examinations
are manifestly of a character which
precludes the idea that they are in
tended for students of the standing
of our graduates. In this matter
the ruling of the Stanford commit
tee is "that no student be eligible
as a candidate who has been
recommended for a degree before
the calendar year in which the ex
amination takes place." Students
who were graduated last May or

who were recommended for gradu
ation last September are therefore
ineligible. Those who will be
recommended in January are eli
gible.
A second question, and one more
difficult of settlement,is that which
deals with the relative weight to be
attached to the scholarly, personal,
and athletic qualifications of the
candidates. The trustees have very
wisely refrained from the formula
tion of strict and unalterable rules
governing the matter of selection.
They have appreciated its difficulty,
and final rules will be formulated
in the light of experience. The
method of procedure this year was
as follows: The papers submitted
at the examination were sealed and
attested and mailed to the proper
authorities at Oxford. The report
of the examining committee, giving
the names of those who had suc
cessfully passed |the examinations,
was then sent back to the commit
tees of selection in the various
states, and these last selected the
scholars. Whether or not any
modification of this method will
be made for 1905 we have not been
informed.
It appears impossible at this
time to state what the principles
will be which will govern the local
committee in the selection. We
can but say that we shall endeavor
to select from those who success
fully pass the examinations that
man who, in the light of the rul
ings of the trustees and the appar
ent intention of Mr. Rhodes, seems
best entitled to the honor.
Lastly, I may add that the com
mittee has ruled that candidates
who expect to take the examina
tions in January must hand in
their names to the chairman not
later than January 2, 1905.

vent misunderstanding.
First, regarding eligibility. The
statement made by the Trustees of
the Rhodes Scholarship Trust is
as follows:
(a) Students may be candidates
who shall have completed their
second year's work at some recog
nized degree-granting university or
college of the United States during
the year of election.
(b) Scholars must be unmarried:
must be citizens of the United
States, and not less than 19 nor
more than 25 years of age on Octo
ber Ist of the year in which they
are elected.
(c) Candidates may elect whether
they will apply for the scholarship
of the state in which they have ac
quired their educational qualifica
tion, or for that of the state in
which they have their private domi
cile, home or residence. They must
present themselves for examination
in the state they select. No candi
date may apply in more than one
state.
It will be noted that a difference
of opinion may well exist as to
whether or not students of gradu
ate standing are eligible, and the
actions of the committees of the
various states during the past year
have been by no means uniform,
In this state the committee ruled
that postgraduates should be con
sidered ineligible, and their decision
seems plainly te agree with the in
tentions of Mr. Rhodes, whose wish
appears to have been that young
men of capacity and of promise
should be sent rather than those
who, while unquestionably better
scholars, would be more mature
and less open 4 o formative influ
ences. Moreover, the examinations
are manifestly of a character which
precludes the idea that they are in
tended for students of the standing
of our graduates. In this matter
the ruling of the Stanford commit
tee is "that no student be eligible
as a candidate who has been
recommended for a degree before
the calendar year in which the ex
amination takes place." Students
who were graduated last May or

who were recommended for gradu
ation last September are therefore
ineligible. Those who will be
recommended in January are eli
gible.
A second question, and one more
difficult of settlement,is that which
deals with the relative weight to be
attached to the scholarly, personal,
and athletic qualifications of the
candidates. The trustees have very
wisely refrained from the formula
tion of strict and unalterable rules
governing the matter of selection.
They have appreciated its difficulty,
and final rules will be formulated
in the light of experience. The
method of procedure this year was
as follows: The papers submitted
at the examination were sealed and
attested and mailed to the proper
authorities at Oxford. The report
of the examining committee, giving
the names of those who had suc
cessfully passed |the examinations,
was then sent back to the commit
tees of selection in the various
states, and these last selected the
scholars. Whether or not any
modification of this method will
be made for 1905 we have not been
informed.
It appears impossible at this
time to state what the principles
will be which will govern the local
committee in the selection. We
can but say that we shall endeavor
to select from those who success
fully pass the examinations that
man who, in the light of the rul
ings of the trustees and the appar
ent intention of Mr. Rhodes, seems
best entitled to the honor.
Lastly, I may add that the com
mittee has ruled that candidates
who expect to take the examina
tions in January must hand in
their names to the chairman not
later than January 2, 1905.
A. T. Murray, Chairman.
