Many students apparently do
not realize the exceptional oppor
tunity offered hy the Rhodes
Scholarship Committee. The large
annual sum which is awarded to
the winner of the scholarship can
he made to provide for more than
the work at Oxford. It is suffici
ent to carry one through the long
vacations also, and during thes-e
a student has the advantage of see
ing much of Europe, and attending
if he so wishes the summer sessions
of the greater European universi
ties. The chance to work at Ox
ford, alone, is rare indeed to an
American student, and when to
this is added the many other edu
cational features which accompany
the Rhodes Scholarship it is diffi
cult to understand why so few have
signified their intention of entering
the competition. No doubt a num
ber of those who are eligible to try
for the scholarship which will be
awarded to some Stanford man
next semester are laboring under
the false impression that a thorough
classical education is necessary
before one can pass the examina
tions. Those who are qualified to
speak on the matter are of the opin
ion that any junior in the classical
departments ought to pass the tests
without difficulty. The examina
tions are not hard, as anyone can
readily ascertain by applying to
Dr. Murray for a copy of those used
last year, in view of the many
valuable opportunities afforded by
the scholarship, and considering
the comparatively small amount of
work necessary to prepare one for
the examinations, no one who has
even a slight chance of success can
afford to let the opportunity pass.
