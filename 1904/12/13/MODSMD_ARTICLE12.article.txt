Dr. Fred E. Schacht, a former
Minnesota football player, and
tackle on the All-American team
of 1902, regarded by Walter Camp
as one of the most scientific and
effective football men in the United
States, is optimistic about football
conditions on the Coast.
Dr. Schacht has the following
to say in regard to Coast football:
" I see no reason why California
and Stanford should not evolve
teams as strong as any in the east.
You have here three vital elements
in successful football — material,
spirit and money. I believe that
with proper training along recog
nized lines there is nothing either
of these teams might not do. Stan
ford's showing against Colorado
has undoubtedly drawn the atten
tion of Eastern football men this
way, and there is considerable
speculation as to what showing
they would make against one of
the 'big' elevens.''
