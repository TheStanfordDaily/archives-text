# No Students in Hospital.
## 
### 
There have been no cases of ill
ness of students in the Guild Hos
pital for some time. This indicates
that the standard of health in the
community is much higher than is
usual at this time of the year. In
the absence of patients, the staff of
hospital assistants is engaged in
the work of perfecting the minor
details of the equipment, such as
distributing stores in each of the
ward rooms, and preparing sup
plies for future use. The hospital
grounds are also being improved,
so that they will soon present an
attractive appearance. A cement
sidewalk is being laid on both the
front and side streets in pursuance
of an ordinance passed by the Palo
Alto town trustees.
