# Harvard May Increase Tuition Fee.
## 
### 
Owing to the strengthening in
crease of money required to main
tain Harvard University,the propo
position is being considered of
raising the tuition fee to $200 per
annum, which amount is $50 great
er than the present fee.
Thirty-six years ago it cost the
university $525 for every degree
conferred, while now the cost is
$950. During the past two years
it has had a deficit in its annual
account of $30,000 or $40,000.
In meeting the changes in finan
cial conditions, Harvard has been
assisted in part by the enlargement
of endowments and the increase of
students, and partly by decreasing
the salaries of instructors, although
the salaries of professors have been
raised quite materially during the
past thirty-five years.
According to present conditions
the university needs $100,000 a
year more than the present income
in order to maintain the position
it now holds. Unless a remarkable
increase of endowments comes to
Harvard's assistance, the tuition
fee will probably be increased.
The objection to this movement is
due to the fact that students' ex
penses at Harvard now are com
paratively high. The minimum
cost of education at that institution
is estimated to range from $-450 to
$500 per year, while the expenses
of the average Harvard student are
from about $800 to $900 per year.
