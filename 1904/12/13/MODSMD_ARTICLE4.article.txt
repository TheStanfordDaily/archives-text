# TALKS ON NOMENCLATURE.
## Dr. Jordan Delivers Third Lecture of Series in the Zoology Building. 
### 
In his lecture Wednesday evening
before the advanced students and
instructors in the department of
Biology, subject "Nomenclature,"
Dr. Jordan continued his commen
tary on the canons of the American
Ornithologists' Union code, which
is the most perfect code that has
yet been published. The lecture
covered the general subjects of the
beginning of zoological nomencla
ture proper, and of the operation
of the law of priority, of names
published simultaneously, of the
retention of names, of the rejection
of names.
Zoological nomenclature begins
in 1758, the date of the tenth edi
tion of the Systema Naturae of Lin
naeus, at which, time the law of
priority of names bacomes opera
tive. The utmost diversity of opin
ion has prevailed as to when nomen
clature shall begin, but for zoologists
the tenth edition is now almost uni
versally accepted. Some writers
have wished to adopt pre-Linnaean
genera on the ground that they are
well founded, but no good excuse
for so doing has yet been advanced,
nor can any good come of the prac
tice, —stability of nomenclature,and
not poetic justice, being the aim of
science, which is essentially demo
cratic.
The adoption of a statute of lim
itation modification of the lex prior
itates is impracticable and inad
missable. The law of priority is to
be rigidly enforced in respect to all
generic, specific and subspecific
names. The law of priority is only
partially operative in relation to
namesof groups higher than genera,
and only where names are strictly
synonymous. Many of the older
names of the higher groups were
given in an indefinite sense,so that
with closer study it becomes neces
sary to re-define and often re-name
orders and higher divisions, for the
sake of accuracy and precision. But.
in the case of a multiplicity of
names for one and the samedivision,
such as Acrania, Leptocardii, Cirris
tomi, Amphioxi, etc., for the group
of the common lancelet, the earliest
and most accurate name should be
chosen.
One of the difficulties of Canon
XVII of the A. O. U. Code is its
impracticability for any group out
side of the birds, or possibly some
insects. This canon has to do with
names published simultaneously.
Instead of giving preference to
names founded upon the male, or
adult, or nuptial plumage, Dr. Jor
dan has adopted the simple rule
that the name which stands lirst
in the book is to be chosen, it being
obvious that the generality of ani
mals does not differ as to sex. Oc
casionally exceptions of an obvious
nature occur in the simple rule of
"first in the book," in which case
an opportunity for the exercise of
common sense is afforded.
A generic name when once es
tablished is never to be canceled in
any subsequent subdivision of the
group, but retained in a restricted
sense for one of the constituent
portions. Thus when a genus is

subdivided the original name of the
genus is to he retained for that
portion of it which contains the
original type of the genus, when
this can he ascertained. Although
this rule is founded upon the "na
ture of things," it has frequently
been broken. Many large genera
have been subdivided and theorigi
nal name has disappeared until
resurrected by a later writer. But
in no case should the name he
transferred to a group containing
none of the species originally in
cluded in the genus.
The process of fixing names by
elimination received a grilling.
When no type is clearly indicated,
the author who first subdivides a
genus may restrict the original
name to such part of it as he may
judge advisable, and such assign
ment shall not be subject to subse
quent modification. If, however,
the genus contains both exotic and
non-exotic species—from the stand
point of the original author —and
the generic term is one originally
applied by the ancient Greeks or
Romans, the process of elimination
is to be restricted to non-exotic
species.
Dr. Jordan pointed out that this
law was successful only when the
committee had decided before they
started in just how they were com
ing out. In the vast majority of
cases it is not practicable. He
further stated that in most cases
the author of a large genus indi
cated the type either by placing it
first or by some other means, so
that the process of elimination is
not necessary. Linnaeus, for in
stance, has said somewhere that
his types are the commonest Euro
pean species, or in the case of
plants, the apothecary's species.
For those cases when it is impos
sible to find the type by consulting
the author, Dr. Jordan has devised
the simple method of taking that
species which comes first. In most
cases the author unconsciously
places first the form which has the
greatest importance in his mind.
The next lecture will be given at
7:30 in room 439 Zoology building
next Wednesday evening.

One of the difficulties of Canon
XVII of the A. O. U. Code is its
impracticability for any group out
side of the birds, or possibly some
insects. This canon has to do with
names published simultaneously.
Instead of giving preference to
names founded upon the male, or
adult, or nuptial plumage, Dr. Jor
dan has adopted the simple rule
that the name which stands lirst
in the book is to be chosen, it being
obvious that the generality of ani
mals does not differ as to sex. Oc
casionally exceptions of an obvious
nature occur in the simple rule of
"first in the book," in which case
an opportunity for the exercise of
common sense is afforded.
A generic name when once es
tablished is never to be canceled in
any subsequent subdivision of the
group, but retained in a restricted
sense for one of the constituent
portions. Thus when a genus is

subdivided the original name of the
genus is to he retained for that
portion of it which contains the
original type of the genus, when
this can he ascertained. Although
this rule is founded upon the "na
ture of things," it has frequently
been broken. Many large genera
have been subdivided and theorigi
nal name has disappeared until
resurrected by a later writer. But
in no case should the name he
transferred to a group containing
none of the species originally in
cluded in the genus.
The process of fixing names by
elimination received a grilling.
When no type is clearly indicated,
the author who first subdivides a
genus may restrict the original
name to such part of it as he may
judge advisable, and such assign
ment shall not be subject to subse
quent modification. If, however,
the genus contains both exotic and
non-exotic species—from the stand
point of the original author —and
the generic term is one originally
applied by the ancient Greeks or
Romans, the process of elimination
is to be restricted to non-exotic
species.
Dr. Jordan pointed out that this
law was successful only when the
committee had decided before they
started in just how they were com
ing out. In the vast majority of
cases it is not practicable. He
further stated that in most cases
the author of a large genus indi
cated the type either by placing it
first or by some other means, so
that the process of elimination is
not necessary. Linnaeus, for in
stance, has said somewhere that
his types are the commonest Euro
pean species, or in the case of
plants, the apothecary's species.
For those cases when it is impos
sible to find the type by consulting
the author, Dr. Jordan has devised
the simple method of taking that
species which comes first. In most
cases the author unconsciously
places first the form which has the
greatest importance in his mind.

In his lecture Wednesday evening
before the advanced students and
instructors in the department of
Biology, subject "Nomenclature,"
Dr. Jordan continued his commen
tary on the canons of the American
Ornithologists' Union code, which
is the most perfect code that has
yet been published. The lecture
covered the general subjects of the
beginning of zoological nomencla
ture proper, and of the operation
of the law of priority, of names
published simultaneously, of the
retention of names, of the rejection
of names.
Zoological nomenclature begins
in 1758, the date of the tenth edi
tion of the Systema Naturae of Lin
naeus, at which, time the law of
priority of names bacomes opera
tive. The utmost diversity of opin
ion has prevailed as to when nomen
clature shall begin, but for zoologists
the tenth edition is now almost uni
versally accepted. Some writers
have wished to adopt pre-Linnaean
genera on the ground that they are
well founded, but no good excuse
for so doing has yet been advanced,
nor can any good come of the prac
tice, —stability of nomenclature,and
not poetic justice, being the aim of
science, which is essentially demo
cratic.
The adoption of a statute of lim
itation modification of the lex prior
itates is impracticable and inad
missable. The law of priority is to
be rigidly enforced in respect to all
generic, specific and subspecific
names. The law of priority is only
partially operative in relation to
namesof groups higher than genera,
and only where names are strictly
synonymous. Many of the older
names of the higher groups were
given in an indefinite sense,so that
with closer study it becomes neces
sary to re-define and often re-name
orders and higher divisions, for the
sake of accuracy and precision. But.
in the case of a multiplicity of
names for one and the samedivision,
such as Acrania, Leptocardii, Cirris
tomi, Amphioxi, etc., for the group
of the common lancelet, the earliest
and most accurate name should be
chosen.
