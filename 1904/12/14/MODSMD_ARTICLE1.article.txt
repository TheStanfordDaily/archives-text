# RECOMMEND CHANGES.
## Faculty Athletic Committees of Stanford and California Offer Interesting Alterations. 
### 
At a recent meeting of the com
bined faculty athletic committees
of Stanford and California several
interesting changes were proposed
in that part of the intercollegiate
agreement which governs the par
ticipation of first-year men in in
tercollegiate varsity contests. These
recommendations, which have just
been compiled by a sub-committee,
consisting of .Professors 13. 1).
Adams and W. F. Durand, will be
submitted to the Intercollegiate
Athletic Committee at the next
meeting of that body.
The recently adopted suggestions
are embodied in the following re
port:
"At a joint meeting of the athletic
committees of the University of Cal
ifornia and of Stanford Unversity
it was unanimously adopted as the
sense of the joint committee that
no student of either institution who
has not been in good standing in his
college for at least one college year
should be allowed to represent that
college in any intercollegiate ath
letic contest. In the interpreta
tion of this resolution it was further
agreed that freshman contests, not
being representative of either insti
tution as a whole, are not consid
ered as lying within the scope of
the recommendation.
"The effect of the adoption of
this recommendation will be to re
quire a continuous residence in
good standing for at least one col
lege year before a player can be
considered eligible for the regular
or varsity teams in their intercol
legiate contests with the similar
teams of other institutions. Stated
more briefly, it will bar the fresh
man or first-year man from playing
on the varsity team in regular in
tercollegiate contests.
"The purposes held in view in
urging this action are two-fold:
"In the first place, the committee
feels that the average freshman or
student in his first year of resi
dence should not take from his
academic work the time or energy
required for full participation in
the regular intercollegiate athletic
games, and that the vigor of the
training which is required and the
large demands made on him both
mentally and physically may be
more safely met after a first year of
relatively less strenuous work, and
with the added year of maturity
which the second year of residence
will bring.
"In the experience of the two
universities it is unquestioned that
many first-year men have been so
carried away by the excitement of
participation in intercollegiate ath
letics as to neglect regular college
work, and as a result have been
dropped by scholarship commit
tees from the university rolls.
This condition is unfortunate in its
result on the first-year man who
really has ability to do good uni
versity work alone, but who should
not attempt in his first year of
residence to combine intercollegi
ate athletics with such work.
It is also unfortunate from the
view-point of the athletic teams, as

it may result in the sacrifice of
three years' service for one.
"In the second place, one of the
peculiarly troublesome factors
which has arisen in the effort to
improve the spirit and tone of in
tercollegiate athletics is that hav-j
ing relation to the so-called 'ama
teur standing' of the player, and |
to the true amateur spirit in which
all intercollegiate contests should
be conducted. Among the troubles
which have thus arisen one of the
more serious has had its origin in
the temptation to bring to an in
stitution by means of various
special inducements players for the
special purpose of enabling them
to play on a given team through
the particular playing season, irre
spective of the academic standing
which such player may be able to
maintain, and independent of his
ultimate purpose regarding contin
uance in his course of studies. The
adoption of the rule as stated will |
eliminate all practical danger of
any such violation of the spirit of
amateur athletics, for no player, no
matter how promising or desirable,
is likely to be 'acquired' and held
over a full year before he can be
come eligible for a place on the
varsity teams.
"In the adoption of this rule the
athletic interests of an institution
where the true spirit of amateur
athletics is faithfully observed will
have little to lose and much to
gain, for it is rare that the first
year man can bring to the varsity
team a strength which may justify
his valuation as an indispensable
factor; and with the rule in force
such institution will always be
guarded from competition with
teams whose players may have
been 'acquired' simply by reason of
their skill as athletes, and who can
not be considered aB fulfilling the
true spirit of the requirement for
amateur standing.
" While the varsity team will
thus be closed to the first-year man,
there will still remain for him the
class team, in which he may repre
sent his class, together with prac
tice on the second team, which will
profitably forward his efforts to
ward an ultimate place on the var
sity team.
"It does not seem likely that
with these opportunities there will
be any lack of stimulus to bring
out first-year men for such athletic
work as they may be eligible for.
It will be an honor of ever increas
ing value to represent the class,
and it will be rare that any one
will be able to gain a place on the
varsity team without a year of
initial practice and training, a
year of apprenticeship thus natur
ally provided by the first year of
residence.
"Parallel with this change in the
eligibility of first-year men for po
sitions on varsity teams, the joint
committee of the two universities
unanimously recommended that
the freshman football game be held
in the early spring (late in Febru
ary, for example (instead of in the
fail, as at present.
"The chief reasons for this sug
gested change are as follows:
"With first-year men no longer
eligible for varsity positions, there
will be no longer the need of bring

ing forward the training of the
freshman team with the rapidity
which now seems to be called for.
This will leave the coaches and all
concerned with the football inter
ests free to give undivided attention
to the varsity team, postponing
special attention to the freshman
team until after the close of the
varsity season. The material avail
able for the freshman team can
thus be more leisurely and care
fully developed, they will have the
advantage of some participation as
individuals in second team play on
the varsity field, and will have the
advantage of play against members
of the varsity team after the regu
lar season of the latter has closed.
"The separation of the freshman
and varsity games will also have
the effect of greatly increasing the
importance of the former, and from
every point of view it seems reason
able to expect better developed
teams, better games, and a more
lively interest throughout the two
institutions in the freshman game
as an item on the athletic calendar.
"A further reason for this change
in date is found in the fact that the
time of year proposed for the fresh
man game and for the practice
leading up to it is in many ways
much better adapted for football
work than the early fall, as under
the existing arrangement. The
warm weather more commonly
met with in the early part of the
first semester is peculiarly hard on
new material on the football field,
and by a transfer of date to the
late winter and early Bpring there
would be a distinct gain in the
adaptation of sport to season."
