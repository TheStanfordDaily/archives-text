# Burning of Contractor's Barrels.
## 
### 
The following letter from John
I). McGilvray, the contractor, to A.
M. Dibble, president of the Associ
ated Students,was read by President

Jordan at this morning's Assembly.
The letter is self-explanatory:
"Mr. A. M. Dibble:
"Dear Sir: â€”During my absence
some weeks ago, at the time of the
football excitement, some of the
students, probably thinking them
valueless, took about one hundred
lime barrels from the buildings
now in course of construction on
thecampus, to make bonfires. This
was done after Mr. Miller, the fore
man in charge,had pointed out a lot
of cement barrels which are practi
cally valueless, but which make
equally good fuel. The lime bar
rels could not be given away by us,
as they are not our property, but
belong to the Cowell Lime Company,
which supplies us with lime, our
only interest in them being a few
cents each for their return to the
kilns to be refilled.
"In this connection I desire to
say that this is the first time I have
had cause to complain, the build
ings and property under my charge
never having been molested dur
ing over six years' building on
the campus. The purpose of this
communication is to settle a com
plaint made in my absence, and to
inform the students of the facts in
the case, as I am sure this will be
sufficient.
"Very trul}' yours,
"John 1). McGilvray."
