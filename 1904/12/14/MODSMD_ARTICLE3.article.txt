# RABBI VOORSANGER TALKS.
## Speaks of the Life and Character of Joseph Le Conte, the Scientist. 
### 
This morning's student body as
sembly, the last of the present se
mester, was addressed by Rabbi
Voorsanger of Temple Emmanuel,
San Francisco. Dr. Voorsanger
spoke of the late Joseph Le Conte
as a type of nineteenth century
evolution. The rabbi enjoyed a
friendship of many years' standing
with the great geologist, and his
address this morning was a strong
personal tribute to the dead scien
tist. He said, in part:
"Joseph Le Conte was greater as
a man than as a scholar, and surely
as a scholar he was very great.
The greatness of his character was
the result to a considerable extent
of his environment. He was born
in the early part of the last century,
the child of Southern parents. He
was brought up in the old South
ern style, the pampered child and
the pet of two hundred slaves.
But Joseph Le Conte, raised in the
midst of reactionary surroundings,
possessed one element that made
him one of the greatest philosophers
of his day. He said the fact that
he was born in the open gave him
a great love for nature and a desire
to examine deeply into the things
of nature. Nature was his first
teacher. As a child he became an
expert in the knowledge of birds
and fishes. In the open he learned
the elements of those sciences of
which he was afterward to become
so great an exponent.
"LeConte inherited ample fortune
from his father, and intended to
live a life of scientific leisure. He
married, and went to Harvard for
a scientific course under Louis
Agassiz. He became one of the
favorite students of that great
scientist, and left him with his
scientific impulses fully developed.
He secured a position in a South
ern college, and there he displayed
his marvelous versatility, teaching
geology, botany, zoology, optics,
astronomy, pharmacy, and chem
istry. Then broke out the Civil
War. The South was overrun by
the soldiers of the North, and
Le Conte's fortune was swept away
with those of most other Southern
gentlemen. He was stripped of
every dollar he had, and he tells
us he was rather glad, because in
his heart he disliked to own slaves.
''After the war he went back to
South Carolina to teach in college;
but the conditions were not the
same, and in 1868 he was glad to
accept a call from the University
of California, where his brother,
John Le Conte, had preceded him.
"It is interesting to note," said I)r.
Voorsanger, "how completely the
life of Joseph Le Conte has become
a part of the life of the State of
California and of the remarkable
evolution in the life of the Univer
sity of California." When Le
Conte arrived in Oakland the uni
versity had not yet gone to work.
There were a few rickety buildings
taken over from the College of
California; about 35 students and
4 professors. It is interesting to
find that so great a scholar identi
fied himself with such an institu
tion. But from that time on he be
comes a great man. He was par
excellence a California teacher, a
California man, who made Califor
nia men, inspiring them with that
impulse which has enabled them to
reach out into the sciences.
"Joseph Le Conte had a peculiar
personal interest," said Dr. Voor
sanger, "because he was a scientist
who did not look down upon relig
ion. Since the publication in 1859
of the doctrine of evolution a sort
of unsettling seems to have taken
place, which has done as much
harm as the discovery has good.
The idea that religion whs an ex
pression of the intellectuality of the
man was disputed. When science
began to hammer at every exist
ing truth, churchmen became
alarmed because people's minds be
gan to swing like a pendulum be
tween the extremes of reason and
religion. Men grew doubtful of
their religion, and remained in the
church as a mere social institution.
Le Conte was among the pioneers
of the great conciliatory philosophy
that the doctrine of evolution is
not in conflict with the word of
God.
"The philosophy of Joseph Le
Conte," concluded Dr. Voorsanger,
"has done more to reconcile relig
ion and science than anything else
has done. While a practical scien
tist in that field by which evolution
was developed, I believe he pre
pared the ground for a yet greater
evolutionâ€”the evolution of science
into a servant of religion, the evolu
tion of religion into a servant of
science, the two helping each other:
one a teacher of the mind, the other
a teacher of the emotion, both blend
ing harmoniously."
Rabbi Voorsanger read the fol
lowing circular letter from the
Association of Pioneer Women of
California, just received by him:
"At the next session of the Legis
lature of this State a resolution will
be introduced providing for the
placing of the statues of the repre
sentative deceased citizens of Cali
fornia-in statuary hall of the art
rotunda of the national captiol,
Washington, in pursuance of Sec
tion 1814 of the Revised Statutes of
the United States.
"The Association of Pioneer Wo
men of California has taken a great
interest in this laudable effort, and
after careful consideration has
adopted a resolution recommend
ing the names of the late Honorable
Leland Stanford and the late Pro
fessor Joseph Le Conte as worthy
of such distinction, and this recom
mendation is meeting with popular
approval.
"We, the pioneer women of Cali
fornia, therefore earnestly ask
your cooperation in this behalf,
and that you sign the petition ad
dressed to the Legislature, praying
for immediate action by that
body, when such petition shall be
presented to you.
"Agnes B. Mac Donald, Pres."
