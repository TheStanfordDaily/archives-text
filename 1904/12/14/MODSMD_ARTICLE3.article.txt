# RABBI VOORSANGER TALKS.
## Speaks of the Life and Character of Joseph Le Conte, the Scientist. 
### 
This morning's student body as
sembly, the last of the present se
mester, was addressed by Rabbi
Voorsanger of Temple Emmanuel,
San Francisco. Dr. Voorsanger
spoke of the late Joseph Le Conte
as a type of nineteenth century
evolution. The rabbi enjoyed a
friendship of many years' standing
with the great geologist, and his
address this morning was a strong
personal tribute to the dead scien
tist. He said, in part:
"Joseph Le Conte was greater as
a man than as a scholar, and surely
as a scholar he was very great.
The greatness of his character was
the result to a considerable extent
of his environment. He was born
in the early part of the last century,
the child of Southern parents. He
was brought up in the old South
ern style, the pampered child and
the pet of two hundred slaves.
But Joseph Le Conte, raised in the
midst of reactionary surroundings,
possessed one element that made
him one of the greatest philosophers
of his day. He said the fact that
he was born in the open gave him
a great love for nature and a desire
to examine deeply into the things
of nature. Nature was his first
teacher. As a child he became an
expert in the knowledge of birds
and fishes. In the open he learned
the elements of those sciences of
which he was afterward to become
so great an exponent.
"LeConte inherited ample fortune
from his father, and intended to
live a life of scientific leisure. He
married, and went to Harvard for
a scientific course under Louis
Agassiz. He became one of the
favorite students of that great
scientist, and left him with his
scientific impulses fully developed.
He secured a position in a South
ern college, and there he displayed
his marvelous versatility, teaching
geology, botany, zoology, optics,
astronomy, pharmacy, and chem
istry. Then broke out the Civil
War. The South was overrun by
the soldiers of the North, and
Le Conte's fortune was swept away
with those of most other Southern
gentlemen. He was stripped of
every dollar he had, and he tells
us he was rather glad, because in
his heart he disliked to own slaves.
''After the war he went back to
South Carolina to teach in college;
but the conditions were not the
same, and in 1868 he was glad to
accept a call from the University
of California, where his brother,
John Le Conte, had preceded him.
"It is interesting to note," said I)r.
Voorsanger, "how completely the
life of Joseph Le Conte has become
a part of the life of the State of
California and of the remarkable
evolution in the life of the Univer
sity of California." When Le
Conte arrived in Oakland the uni
