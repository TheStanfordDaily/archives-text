# DR. SCUDDER LECTURES.
## Illustrated Address on the Hawaiian Islands Attended by Appreciative Audience. 
### 
Dr. Doremus Scudder addressed
an interested audience in the chapel
last night on the subject, "God's
Hand in Our Mid-Pacific Paradise."
Dr. Scudder has been in charge of
the Hawaiian Evangelical Associa
tion for several years, and is now
engaged in lecturing at the princi
pal universities and the leading
missionary conferences of the
United States.
Oyer a hundred and fifty stereop
ticori views, illustrating the physi
cal characteristics and life of the
islands, were used by the lecturer.
Beginning with the physical origin
of the Hawaiian Islands, Dr. Scud
der described the gradual volcanic
formation of this archipelago.
He said in part: "The vegetation
of these islands is, in its natural
state, prolific in character, and un
der the hands of man has assumed
most remarkable aspects. A half
mile avenue of night bloom
ing cereus, where 10,000 blossoms
flourish and die in a night, is one
of the many examples of nature's
productivity in the city of Honolulu.
The climate of these beautiful
islands is ever warm, but never
torrid, and the conditions for hu
man life are as ideal as those for
plant life. God's hand was appar
ent in the preserving of this Para
dise from foreign exploitation. Al
though these islands were so ideal
in climate and character, and
formed one of the most strategic
points in the world, they were left
unconquered until they were
handed over to Christian America.
"The manner in which the United
States was brought into contact
with Hawaii was most strange.
After six centuries of internal war
fare, a Hawaiian king, Kameha
meha I, wishing to unite the many
islands under one rule, and recog
nizing the superiority of European
fighting methods, kidnapped two
American sailors, and under their
leadership Kamehameha united
the Islands. About the same time
a native Hawaiian boy was found
on the steps of Yale University cry
ing for knowledge. Interest was
aroused, and soon many American
missionaries were hastening to the
islands. But before the first teach
ers could reach Hawaii Kameha
ineha's successor to the throne had
overthrown the pagan idol wor
ship of her subjects, and the mis
sionaries landed to find a country
without a religion.
"For the next forty years Chris
tianity made rapid strides in the is
lands, and 1860 found thirty-five
per cent of the entire population of
the Mid-Pacific Paradise gathered
in the Protestant churches. Then
American interest seemed to die
out, and to-day only ten per cent of
the population are Christians, and
churches are lying in ruins."
