# SPRING TRACK MEETS.
## One Field-Day Scheduled, and Several Proposed for Next Semester. 
### 
Manager Barrett has already be
gun work on a schedule of Held
meets for the Varsity and Fresh
man track teams next semester.
It will be the policy of the track
management to hold more field
days than usual next spring, in
order that the Freshmen may be
given an opportunity to acquire
needed experience. The field-day
schedule of last spring was larger
than that of former years, but the
unpropitious weather caused a
number of the proposed contests to
be declared off. To obviate all
danger of a recurrence of this diffi
culty, the first field-day will not
be held until the last of February.
This first meet will be between the
combined teams of the San Jose
and Santa Clara high schools and
the Stanford Freshmen. The field
day will take place the third Satur
day in February, on the campus
oval. On account of a lack of
numbers, neither of the high schools
would stand much chance against
the Freshmen, but as there are a
number of star athletes in each
school it is expected that the pro
posed meet will lie very close.
Manager Boyd of San Jose is try
ing to complete arrangements with
F. S. Holman, '05, to coach the
track team of that school.
Mananer Barrett is also trying
to secure a meet for the Freshmen
with a team from the Santa Rosa
high school. This school was
promised a date last spring, but
inclement weather interfered and
the contest did not occur. It is ex
pected that these two preliminary
field-days will develop the men,
who will meet California in case
an intercollegiate Freshman meet
is held next spring.
For the Varsity schedule, Barrett
is negotiating with the University
of Nevada and Pomona College.
Walter Hemphill, the Pomona
trainer, had a personal interview
with Barrett this fall, and tentative
arrangements for a field-day were
made at that time, but the time
and place for holding the meet has
not yet been settled. Other meets
will be held during the season, but
no arrangements have been made
for them.
