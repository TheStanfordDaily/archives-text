The Class of 1904 is now trying
to remove a deficit incurred during
the festivities of Senior week last
May. Those members of the class
who are engaged in the work of
raising the money have met with
some success, but there is still a
considerable amount to be raised.
The obligation, especially in the
case of those members of the class
who did not graduate and who
have now affiliated with the Class
of 1905, is purely a moral one, but
it would seem that loyalty to their
former numerals ought to prompt
such former members to come to
the rescue. Those who graduated
with the class are clearly bound by
more than a moral obligation, and
no '04 graduate should refuse to
respond to the call for money.
