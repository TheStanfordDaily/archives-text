# BIOLOGICAL LECTURE.
## Dr. C. Hart Merriam Addresses Scientific Audience on the Recent Work of the U.S. Survey. 
### 
A scientific audience listened to an
interesting and instructive lecture
in the chapel last evening by Dr. C.
Hart Merriam, chief of the Biologi
cal Survey of the United States De
partment of Agriculture, on the re
cent work of the Survey. Dr.
Merriam is one of the most noted
biologists of America, and is con
sidered an authority in his line of
work. The address was attractively
illustrated with colored lantern
slides, some graphically depicting
scenes of animal and plant life,
while others showed suggestive bio
graphical maps.
Dr. Merriam opened his address
by explaining the nature of the
work delegated to the Survey by
Congress. The work is divided into
three branches: First, the duties
having to do with the Biological
Survey proper: the study of the dis
tribution of the animal and plant
life of America, to determine the
condition of organic life in these re
gions, and to further determine the
adaptability of these particular
areas for the raising of agricultural
products. Second, the study of the
economic habits of the birds and
mammals of the country with refer
ence to their effect on agriculture:
a study to determine which species
of animal life are detrimental to the
farmer's interest, and which species
are beneficial. Third, there is the
administrative function of the Sur
vey: the direct guardianship of the
Federal game.
The Lacy Act, recently passed by
Congress, provides that no species
of animal, reptile, etc., shall be in
troduced into the United States
without a special permit,to be issued
by the Biological Survey. This law
aims to keep out all obnoxious and
destructive animals, and has suc
ceeded well. The Lacy Act further
provides for the regulation of inter
state commerce in game, and this
work also is placed with the Survey.
Before this law came into being,
animals illegally killed in one state
were free from the interference of the
law when shipped to a sister state.
Some difficulty was found in break
ing up this traffic —Chicago dealers
even going to theextentof importing
game from Kansas in coffins —but
to-day this trade has entirely ceased.
Taking up the second division of
the Survey, the work relating to
the economic habits of animals, Dr.
Merriam explained the practical
value of this study. Many fallacies
have grown up as to the habits of
birds and smaller animals, and the
Survey has been able to prove that
in many instances the farmers are
destroying the creatures that are
their real protectors. For instance,
the many varieties of hawk, in this
country, prey almost entirely on
those deadly agricultural pests, the
gophers, grasshoppers, field mice,
etc. Yet farmers imagine that,
because six out of eighty varieties
of these birds make an occasional
raid on poultry, all hawks are
destructive and should be slaught
ered. The same condition applies
in the case of the rabbit pest, and
with many other common animals.
In conclusion Dr. Merriam de
scribed the seven great transcon
tinental zones of plant and animal
life into which America is divided,
and showed how beneficial to agri
cultural interests is the study of
life in these areas.
