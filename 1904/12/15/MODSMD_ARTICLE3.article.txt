# COWDEN TO COACH.
## Former Varsity Captain Selected to Have Charge of Baseball Next Season. 
### 
Manager li. W. Barrett has se
cured the services of David V.
Cowden, '03, to coach the baseball
team during the coming season.
This choice is a popular one, due
to the efficiency of Cowden and the
fact that the faculty intercollegi
ate athletic committee has ex
pressed itself as strongly in favor
of a graduate coach.
Cowden is not the first graduate
who has been selected to coach
baseball, as C. J. Swindells, '02,
coached the '02 and '03 teams.
Swindells was a Varsity catcher
while in college, but before he was
selected as coach he had played
professional ball with the Coast
League, and with teams of the in
terior. Thus, Swindells might be
classed as both a graduate and
professional coach.
Last season Charles Doyle, a
professional from the Pacific Coast
League, occupied the position of
coach. Doyle had to leave just be
fore the intercollegiate games, to
carry out his contract with a pro
fessional team.
During the early days of Stan
ford baseball the coaches were men
selected from other colleges, chief
of whom was Murphy, now a per
manent coach of Yale.
Cowden will take up his duties
here as coach during the middle of
January, and will remain with the
team until the intercollegiate con
tests are finished in April. As a
ball player Cowden made an ex
cellent record while in college.

His fielding was of a high order,
and he was regarded as one of the
strongest batters on the team. Be
ing an all-round ball player,
Cowden is especially fitted to act as
coach.
The new coach played four years
on the Varsity, occupying left field
during his first year and alternat
ing between first and second bases
during his last three seasons.
Cowden was elected captain in his
third year.
While in college Cowden took a
prominent part in student affairs,
being elected student body treas
urer in '03. He is a member of
Delta Upsilon, Phi Delta Phi, and
Sigma Sigma fraternities. Since
leaving college Cowden hafi been
engaged in business at San .lose,
