# GRADUATE STUDENTS MEET.
## Organization of Advanced Students Completed at Meeting Last Night. 
### 
A meeting of the recently organ
ized Graduate Students' Club was
held yesterday evening at the resi
dence of Dr. Jordan. This was
the last meeting of the club at
which the charter membership was
open, and thirty-nine postgraduate
students signed the constitution.
The chief purpose of this meeting
was to bring the members of the
club into closer contact and to pre
pare them for the more important
meetings of next semester, when it
is hoped that the scope of the club
will be enlarged and that it will be
come a prominent factor in the
graduate work of the University.
A few minutes were devoted to a
short business meeting, at which
the constitution whs amended to
provide for the admission of mem
bers of the faculty upon payment
of the regular dues. The remainder
of the evening was spent in an in
formal discussion of plans for next
semester. Later, refreshments were
served by the women of the club.
The time and nature of the next
meeting will be announced later,
although it is possible that the club
will not meet again until the early
part of next semester.
