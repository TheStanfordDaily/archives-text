# Fourth Lecture on Nomenclature.
## 
### 
The fourth and last lecture of the
series on "Nomenclature in Zoology
and Botany" was delivered by Dr.
Jordan last night in the library of
the Zoology building. The lecture
was devoted to gathering up the
threads of the first three lectures,
and dealt largely with points of a
very technical nature.
Next semester the subject will be
continued by Dr. Jordan in a series
of lectures dealing with the laws
governing the coining of names for
new species. In the lectures on
Nomenclature all the general laws
of Nomenclature have been dis
cussed, and the lectures next semes
ter will supplement these by show
ing how the laws apply in practice.
