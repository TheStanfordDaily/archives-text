The financial side of college pub
lications is one of the most essential
parts of their existence, and when
ever it is possible for the members
of the University community to as
sist the business departments of
the papers their support should be
given. The subscription lists of
all Stanford publications have been
constantly growing, a fact which
shows that students and faculty
members are not seriously neglect
ing their college lijerary produc
tions on that score. There is also
another and no less important way
by which subscribers can aid, with
out expense or additional effort,
the business managers of the pa
pers. This is by confining as far
as possible the trade of the com
munity to those merchants who
find it advantageous to advertise in
student publications. Among the
advertisers in the three Stanford
papers are to be found almost all
the leading merchants and profes
sional men, and so there is nothing
to be gained by dealing outside of
the list of advertisers. By bearing
in mind the firms and professional
men whose names appear in the
college papers, and by confining
very largely the trade of the com
munity to these men students will
aid materially those who have the
financial end of the college publi
cations in charge.
