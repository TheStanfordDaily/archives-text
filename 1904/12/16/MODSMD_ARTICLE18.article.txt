One of the best arguments that
has been advanced in favor of large
universities, in fuvor of social activ
ity, and in favor of the development
of men rather than students, may
be drawn from the following words
uttered by President Wilson of
Princeton in a lecture upon "The
University and the Nation":
"Unless a country can supply
liberal hearted and liberal minded
men, that country ought not to
have universities. You don't send
a boy to college to find an educa
tion —it's to find himself, to orient
himself, to find his relation to the

! life that is around, and to become
| of value to the nation.
"The classroom is not vital, be
cause one man dominates —one
mind is master. I believe that the
only way to learn is by trying your
mind alongside of some other mind
i and drawing conclusions. The
| thing is to get in the classroom the
j point of view. Nothing gives a
youngster catholicity of view like
rubbing against the men of various
parts of his own country.
"University men have found
themselves quicker and better out
side than inside the classroom.
It's the mixing with others that
countß; arid he who fails to enter
undergraduate activities misses
more than half the opportunities of
his four years in a university. A
sad sight indeed is that of the
undergraduate who trudges up the
hill before daylight and hobbles
back again at dusk, to hug his
lamp till bedtime. With no thought
of discouraging study (for that
would be fatal),we sincerely believe
there is lots to be learned around
the university which the curriculum
does not mention."
