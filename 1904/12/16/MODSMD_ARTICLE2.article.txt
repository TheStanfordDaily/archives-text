The physical statistics of the
Yale freshman class show an aver
age age of eighteen years, nine
months and sixteen days, indicat
ing probably not less than twenty
two years and ten months at grad
uation. This is fairly high, says
the Yale Alumni News, and sug
gests the progressive increase of
the average age of graduation,
though the advance has been slow.
For four decades, beginning with
1863, the average age at graduation
has risen from twenty-two years,
nine months and twenty-seven
days, one class, that of 1899, rising
to twenty-three years, five months
and eleven days. The new gradu
ate at commencement is about four
months older than he was forty
yeara ago. The increased age is
due to the greater severity of the
entrance examinations and increase
of work in the preparatory schools.
The statistics for forty years show
also that, bo long as entrance re
quirements remain fixed, the grad
uation age tends downward, that
the average age of graduation
eighty years ago was probably not
less than twenty-two years.
