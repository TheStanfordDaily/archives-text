Psychology.—The department of
Psychology will offer a two-hour
course in Child Psychology during
the second semester of the college
year. The course will take up such
work on the subject as may fairly
be called scientific, and will there

fore require Psychology 1, or its
equivalent, by way of preparation.
Hours will be arranged after con
sultation with Professor L. J. Mar
tin or myself. F. Angell.
Junior Class.—Some time ago
attention was called to the fact that
the 1906 Quad assessments were
not being paid as promptly as they
have been in past years. Although
there now remains but another
week in which to pay the assess
ment, it is discouraging to note
that only a few more than half the
class have paid. In order to give
the class ample time in which to
pay up, the assessment was levied
three months ago. It is impossible
to extend the date for payment be
yond the 22d of December, the
day on which college closes; and
those members of the class who
are now in college and who fail to
pay the assessment before that date
will be barred from the privileges
afforded by such payment. The
fact that all class pictures must be
sent to the engraver early in Janu
ary makes this measure necessary.
It is, therefore,imperative that those
who have not paid the assessment
should do so before Thursday,
December 22d, in order to avoid
any later financial embarrassment.
J. L. Maloy,
Business Manager, 1906 Quad.
