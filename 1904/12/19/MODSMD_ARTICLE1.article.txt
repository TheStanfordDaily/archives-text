## Combined Teams of Five High Schools Will Meet Stanford Freshmen. 
### 
Manager Johns of the California
School of Mechanical Arts track
team is negotiating with Treasurer
Barrett of Stanford for a track
meet between the combined teams
of five of the schools included in
the Bay Counties League and the
Cardinal freshmen. For the pro
posed meet it is planned to select
a picked team of fifteen track ath
letes from the following schools:
Cogswell Polytechnic high school,
Lowell high school, the California
School of Mechanical Arts of San
Francisco, and the high schools of
Berkeley and Oakland. With the
exception of Oakland, a Stanford
freshman track team has never
met any of these schools. Track
men at Stanford are inclined to
favor the proposed meet, and it is
probable that definite arrange
ments for holding it will soon be
made. If the present plans are
carried out the field-day will take
place sometime near the middle of
March.
The five schools which have in
timated a desire to contest against
the freshmen for track and field
honors have a majority of the best
preparatory school athletes in the
state, and the first-year team will
do well to hold its own against
them. The picked team will be
selected bv the officials of the Bay
Counties League, and their choice
will be based on the previous
records of the chosen men in the
events which they desire to enter.
Maundrell, who holds the academic
records for the mile run and the
quarter-mile, will be captain of the
team.
Whitman, with records of 10:2
and 24 seconds in the 100 and
220-yard dashes respectively, will
be one of the Berkeley high school
representatives. He will also enter
the broad jump, in which he has a
record of 19 feet. McNamara of
the Oakland high school, with a
record of 54:3 in the quarter, will
run in that race. Roy Dodson of
Lick has done the half-mile run in
2:05 1-5. Maundrell of the Low
ell high school has a record of
4:40 in the mile run. Garvin, who
will enter for the two-mile
run, has a record of 10:49 in
that event. Dozier of Oakland
runs the high hurdles in 18 flat.
Monteagle of Lowell has a record
of 29 seconds in the high hurdles.
Bressi of Lowell, with a record of
5 feet 4 inches, is at present the
best performer in the high jump.
In the pole-vault Mullen of Lick
has gone 10 feet 10 inches. He
can also throw the twelve-pound
hammer 165 feet and put the shot
44 feet. These men are practically
assured of their places on the team,
and the other members will be
chosen after competitive try-outs.
