# Good Number of "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The Christmas number of the
Chaparral is the most attractive
number of that journal that has
been issued this semester. It is
printed on a pretty cream paper
which brings out the illustrations
very well. The art work is plenti
ful, and most of it is well drawn.
The leading editorial pays a well
deserved tribute to "Dad" Moulton,
the veteran trainer. "The second
"Now That" will bear considerable
study as to its meaning, but it has
something to do with politics and
Mayfield, mixed with a general
sentiment of regret.
