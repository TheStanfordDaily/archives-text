## Rev. D. Charles Gardner Preaches on Subject "Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother." 
### 
At the morning service in Me
morial Church Dr. D. Charles
Gardner delivered the sermon. His
text was the fifth commandment,
"Honor thy father and thy mother:
that thy days may be long upon
the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee." He began by saying
that the season of Christmas made
all think instinctively of home and
the loved ones,and that his message,
"Honor thy father and thy
mother," was for all who love the
sentiment, of Christmas. He said
in part:
"Originally this message was
brought to an ancient people by a
wise law-giver, to a people who,
with all their faults, have ever
since been conspicuous for their
devotion to home and family life.
It is a message which has a strong
appeal to our race, and it yet re
mains a part of the code which lies
at the basis of the moral law, which
may be defined as the codified ex
pression of man's consciousness of
right and wrong.
"The capital importance of this
commandment will be clearly un
derstood if you realize that the
family is the basis of the state and
nation; that the family is the in
stitute of the affections. The au
thor of a recent book on the prin
ciples and practice of morality says:
'Surely no principle is more effec
tive in preserving the stability of a
people than respect for parents,
and regard for their wishes. In
the beginning of American society
there was doubtless extreme ex
action of filial reverence. The re
action from that extreme to the op
posite extreme of disregard for
parental authority bodes no good
for American society or for the
stability of American institu
tions.'
"That, my brethern, is a very
proper warning. To me it is
shocking to see the careless,
thoughtless attitude of many sons
and daughters, and the insolent
assertion of independence. Our
parents gave us life, yearned over
us in our baby days, nursed and
guarded us in our childhood, plan
ning, scheming and saving, that
we might have comfort, education,
and position. How have we treated
them in return? Also, we have
been disobedient, stubborn, selfish.
Our little education, our little so
cial polish, has made us feel better
than the modest father or the
gentle, retiring mother. We have
slighted the love of honest hearts
and wounded the gentle souls who
have suffered for us.
• "Let us love, honor and succor
our fathers and mothers. It is our
highest privilege, our duty. They
gave us life, they instructed us in
our weakness, they guided our first
footsteps, they have loved us in
dark days as well as in sunshine.
Therefore let us love them. Let
them never want. Let them not
feel lonely if a visit, a letter, can
help to cheer the dark days. May
be they are old, the winter of years
may be upon them. Cheer them
with the sunshine of your love.
Don't wait until the end—tell them
you love them now —make them
"feel it true. Be very patient; they
are weak perhaps, and you are
strong. Be good and kind. Honor
thy father and mother —and God
shall bless you."
