# Dr. Branner Will Speak.
## 
### 
The American Geological Society,
of which Prof. J. C. Branner is presi
dent, will meet in Philadelphia on
December 29th. Dr. Branner will
deliver the presidential address on
the opening day of the meeting,
upon some phase of the stone reefs
of Brazil, which Dr. Branner
studied very extensively some years
ago. It is not expected that any of
the other members of the faculty
will attend this meeting, owing to
the limited time for such a long
trip. Dr. Branner will return to
the University to resume his work
soon after the first of the year.
