# ELIGIBILITY RULE.
## Rule Proposed in the Middle West Similar to that Now Being Considered at Stanford. 
### 
In view of the recent recommenda
tiotiu of the faculty athletic com
mittees of Stanford and California
the following article from the North
western will be of interest:
"The rule proposed by the Uni
versity of Chicago requiring a se
mester's credit and one year's resi
dence before a man is eligible to
compete in athletics is liable to fail
of adoption. The athletic board of
control of the University of Minne
sota has decided against it, and
they rely on theUniversitiesof Mich
igan and lowa to support them.
The University of Illinois has taken
no definite action as yet, but Ath
letic Director Huff has declared
himself as opposed to the ruling.
"The Eastern colleges have not
taken official action on this matter,
but in only rare cases are freshmen
considered as candidates for the
first eleven. Only exceptional play
ers are able to attract the attention
of the captain and coaches in their
first year, and generally freshmen
have to be satisfied with making
their class team.
"Very few of the Western univer
sities could permit this ruling just
now. Yost is undoubtedly relying
upon freshmen to fill Captain lies
ton's and Tackle Curtis' places.
McCormack will need new men to
fill the tackle and end positions
unless some can'be developed from
the reserves of this year. Stagg,
who is in favor of the rule, loses
only Captain Spiek at end, so he is
perhaps better prepared to meet
such a ruling than any other coach
in the West.
"This rule, if adopted, will mean
that the average football player will
have only three years at the out
side, unless he can be induced to
enter the professional school. This
is the case with Captain Hurley, of
Harvard, who has been elected to
the captaincy for the second time,
and who is the first professional
school man to captain the Crimson.
"From a Northwestern standpoint
it appears that the Purple is unable
at present to stand the conditions,
and it looks as though the cham
pionship would practically be Chi
cago's from the blow of the whistle."
