# RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS.
## Former Oxford Student Discusses the Question of Their Advantage to an American. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—ln trying to respond
to your request for a short discus
sion as to the desirability of be
coming a recipient of a Rhodes
scholarship, I am met with a ser
ious difficulty. The popular view
is the easier to take, and by voicing
it 1 might seem to express better
the appreciation I have for Oxford
itself, as judged by its own stan
dards. But the question that con
fronts the prospective Rhodes
scholar is, I think, a serious one;
and so I venture to risk misunder
standing rather than leave unex
pressed some of the considerations
on the negative Bide that do not
generalh 7 find expression in discus
sion of this sort. But consider
ations that apply in one case do
not in another, and I should be the
last to attempt to formulate a dic
tion that would apply to all cases.
Let me then put my ideas in the
form of questions, which a pro
spective Rhodes scholar may put
to himself. Perhaps it may be
profitable for others less personally
interested in the subject to answer
the questions too, for their bearing
in the more general aspects of the
whole problem.
First, a fact or two regarding the
conditions on which a Rhodes
scholar goes to Oxford, as a re
minder of familiar matters: The
Rhodes scholar takes the regular
undergraduate course, a course in
which the elective element is small,
and which is carried on by meth
ods so well adapted to English
training as to be a perfect educa
tional expression of a national
habit of thought and action. In
asmuch as the purpose of the schol
arship is not to train Americans
with sole reference to their future
careers, but to bring them, through
common training, into sympathy
with men of English birth, it is not
the policy of the university to
adapt Oxford conditions to the
particular needs of the individual
American student. The student,
moreover, is to! spend what is prac
tically his whole undergraduate
course —three years —beginning at
the beginning, no matter how the
years preceding entrance have been
spent in school and college here.
Now for the questions:
Will a student's American train
ing fit him to compete to advan
tage with boys trained through
years, one might almost say gener
ations, of tuition according to Eng
lish traditions?
If he overcomes his handicap
and gets into the spirit of the Eng
lish wav of doing things, will it be
easy for him to re-adapt himself
to American methods on his return?
Will his professional equipment
(if he intends to be a professional
man) be of sufficient value to him
when he returns to this country to
repay his three years of Oxford
study? (It will be remembered
that the Englishman may enter
public and professional life through
the door of his university exami
nations.)
On the social side, can a student

maintain, if he so desires, an inde
pendent view-point regarding the
usages of the community in which
he spends three consecutive years?
If he finds he cannot sympathize
with the social and intellectual
conditions that make up his envi
ronment, is his course going to he a
happy and satisfactory one?
If he conforms readily to his
environment, and devotes the en
thusiasm of three of his hest
life to institutions in many respects
different from those obtaining in
his own country, will he find him
self, on his return, in close touch
and sympathy with the conditions
in which his life is to be lived?
To sum up, when a given stu
dent balances the benefits he will
receive as a Rhodes scholar with
what he gives in return — three
years of life, of study, of enthusiasm,
spent according to the methods,
the standards, the ideals, of a dif
ferent people —is the profit neces
sarily greater than the cost?
