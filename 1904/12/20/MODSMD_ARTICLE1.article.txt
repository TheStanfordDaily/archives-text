# EXAMINATION REGULATIONS.
## Circular on Rhodes Scholarship Requirements Received by Dr. Murray. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir —I have received a cir
cular regarding the examinations
for the Rhodes Scholarships, and
as the matter is of interest I should
he glad to have you print the fol
lowing extract from it:
"The next qualifying examina
tions for scholars in the United
States, under the Rhodes bequest,
will he held on Tuesday and Wed
nesday, January 17 and 18, 1905,
the selection of scholars is to he
completed before the end of March,
and the elected scholars will begin
residence at Oxford in October, 1905.
•'lt should be clearly understood
that this examination is not com
petitive, but simply qualifying, and
is merely intended to give assur
ance that every elected scholar is
able to pass the first examination
which the university demands of all
candidates for the B. A. degree.
"It has been decided that all
scholars shall have reached, before
going into residence, at least the
end of their sophomore, or second
year work, at some recognized de
gree-granting university or college
of the United States.
"Candidates may elect whether
they will apply for scholarship of
the state or territory in which they
have acquired any large part of
their educational qualification, or
for that of the state and territory
in which they have their ordi
nary private domicile, home or
residence. They may pass the
qualifying examination at any cen
ter, but they must be prepared to
present themselves before election
to the committee in the state or ter
ritory they select.
"No candidate may compete in
more than one state or territory."
The examinations cover arithme
tic, algebra, geometry, Greek and
Latin grammar, translation of
English into Latin, and translation
from Greek and Latin authors.
"The replies made by candidates
will be collected at the close of each
examination, and forwarded at the
close of each day's work in sealed
parcels to l)r. G. R. Parkin, care of
lion. \V. T. Harris, Commissioner
of Education, Washington.
"As soon as the report of the ex
aminers has been received the chair
man of the committee in each state
will be furnished with a list of the
candidates who have passed and
are therefore eligible for election.
"The Committee of Selection will
then proceed to choose the scholar
for the year.
"In accordance with the wish of
Mr. Rhodes, the trustees desire that
in the "election of a student to a
scholarship, regard shall be had to
(i) his literary and scholastic at
tainments, (ii) his fondness for and
success in manly out-door sports,
such as cricket, football, and the
like, (iii) his qualities of manhood,
truth, courage, devotion to duty,
sympathy for and protection of the
weak, kindness, unselfishness and
fellowship, and (iv) his exhibition
during school'days of moral force
of character, and of instincts to lead

and to take an interest in his
schoolmates." Mr. Rhodes sug
gested that (ii) and (iii) should be
decided in any school or college by
the votes of fellow students, and
(iv) by the head of the school or
college.
"Where circumstances render it
impractible to carry out the letter
of these suggestions the trustees
hope that every effort will be made
to give effect to their spirit, but de
sire it to be understood that the
final decision must rest with the
committee of selection.
"To aid in making a choice each
qualified candidate should be re
quired to furnish to the chairman
of the committee of selection: —
a. "A certificate of age.
b. "A full statement of his educa
tional career at school and college;
his record in athletics, and such
testimonials from his masters at
school and his professors at college,
in reference to the qualities indi
cated by Mr. Rhodes, as will assist
the judgment of the committee of
selection.
c. "In cases where more than one
candidate from a single college or
university has qualified, the college
or university should be required to
select (in accordance with the views
of Mr. Rhodes) its chosen represen
tative to go before the committee of
selection for final choice, and a cer
tificate that he has been so chosen
shall be sent to the chairman of the
committee of selection.
"Each candidate should person
ally present himself to the commit
tee of selection before a final de
cision is made, unless specially ex
cused by the committee itself, in
which case a statement of the rea
sons should be sent to the trustees.
"If a careful comparison of these
records and personal interviews
with the candidates do not furnish
sufficient grounds for making a de
cision, the committee of selection is
free to apply to the candidates, or
to any selected number of them,
such further intellectual or other
tests as they may consider neces
sary.
"The chairman of the committee
of selection should at once notify
to the trustees and to Mr. F. J.
Wylie, The Rhodes Trust, Oxford,
the name of the elected scholar,
and should forward to the latter
all the records, credentials and
testimonials relating to the scholar
on which the election was made.
These papers should bo transmitted
immediately, as they are used in
consulting college authorities in re
gard to the admission of scholars.
"The scholarship will be paid in
four quarterly installments: the
first on beginning residence at Ox
ford, and thereafter terminally on
the certificate of his college that
the work and conduct of the student
have been satisfactory. Without
such a certificate the scholarship
lapses. A scholarship which lapses
either from the failure of a student
to secure this college certificate,
from resignation, from marriage,
or from any other cause, will not
be filled until the year in which
it would naturally expire. This
provision is made in order not to
interfere with the rota of succeed
ing scholars." A. T. Murray.

then proceed to choose the scholar
for the year.
"In accordance with the wish of
Mr. Rhodes, the trustees desire that
in the "election of a student to a
scholarship, regard shall be had to
(i) his literary and scholastic at
tainments, (ii) his fondness for and
success in manly out-door sports,
such as cricket, football, and the
like, (iii) his qualities of manhood,
truth, courage, devotion to duty,
sympathy for and protection of the
weak, kindness, unselfishness and
fellowship, and (iv) his exhibition
during school'days of moral force
of character, and of instincts to lead

and to take an interest in his
schoolmates." Mr. Rhodes sug
gested that (ii) and (iii) should be
decided in any school or college by
the votes of fellow students, and
(iv) by the head of the school or
college.
"Where circumstances render it
impractible to carry out the letter
of these suggestions the trustees
hope that every effort will be made
to give effect to their spirit, but de
sire it to be understood that the
final decision must rest with the
committee of selection.
"To aid in making a choice each
qualified candidate should be re
quired to furnish to the chairman
of the committee of selection: —
a. "A certificate of age.
b. "A full statement of his educa
tional career at school and college;
his record in athletics, and such
testimonials from his masters at
school and his professors at college,
in reference to the qualities indi
cated by Mr. Rhodes, as will assist
the judgment of the committee of
selection.
c. "In cases where more than one
candidate from a single college or
university has qualified, the college
or university should be required to
select (in accordance with the views
of Mr. Rhodes) its chosen represen
tative to go before the committee of
selection for final choice, and a cer
tificate that he has been so chosen
shall be sent to the chairman of the
committee of selection.
"Each candidate should person
ally present himself to the commit
tee of selection before a final de
cision is made, unless specially ex
cused by the committee itself, in
which case a statement of the rea
sons should be sent to the trustees.
"If a careful comparison of these
records and personal interviews
with the candidates do not furnish
sufficient grounds for making a de
cision, the committee of selection is
free to apply to the candidates, or
to any selected number of them,
such further intellectual or other
tests as they may consider neces
sary.
"The chairman of the committee
of selection should at once notify
to the trustees and to Mr. F. J.
Wylie, The Rhodes Trust, Oxford,
the name of the elected scholar,
and should forward to the latter
all the records, credentials and
testimonials relating to the scholar
on which the election was made.
These papers should bo transmitted
immediately, as they are used in
consulting college authorities in re
gard to the admission of scholars.
"The scholarship will be paid in
four quarterly installments: the
first on beginning residence at Ox
ford, and thereafter terminally on
the certificate of his college that
the work and conduct of the student
have been satisfactory. Without
such a certificate the scholarship
lapses. A scholarship which lapses
either from the failure of a student
to secure this college certificate,
from resignation, from marriage,
or from any other cause, will not
be filled until the year in which
it would naturally expire. This
provision is made in order not to
interfere with the rota of succeed
ing scholars." A. T. Murray.

Dear Sir —I have received a cir
cular regarding the examinations
for the Rhodes Scholarships, and
as the matter is of interest I should
he glad to have you print the fol
lowing extract from it:
"The next qualifying examina
tions for scholars in the United
States, under the Rhodes bequest,
will he held on Tuesday and Wed
nesday, January 17 and 18, 1905,
the selection of scholars is to he
completed before the end of March,
and the elected scholars will begin
residence at Oxford in October, 1905.
•'lt should be clearly understood
that this examination is not com
petitive, but simply qualifying, and
is merely intended to give assur
ance that every elected scholar is
able to pass the first examination
which the university demands of all
candidates for the B. A. degree.
"It has been decided that all
scholars shall have reached, before
going into residence, at least the
end of their sophomore, or second
year work, at some recognized de
gree-granting university or college
of the United States.
"Candidates may elect whether
they will apply for scholarship of
the state or territory in which they
have acquired any large part of
their educational qualification, or
for that of the state and territory
in which they have their ordi
nary private domicile, home or
residence. They may pass the
qualifying examination at any cen
ter, but they must be prepared to
present themselves before election
to the committee in the state or ter
ritory they select.
"No candidate may compete in
more than one state or territory."
The examinations cover arithme
tic, algebra, geometry, Greek and
Latin grammar, translation of
English into Latin, and translation
from Greek and Latin authors.
"The replies made by candidates
will be collected at the close of each
examination, and forwarded at the
close of each day's work in sealed
parcels to l)r. G. R. Parkin, care of
lion. \V. T. Harris, Commissioner
of Education, Washington.
"As soon as the report of the ex
aminers has been received the chair
man of the committee in each state
will be furnished with a list of the
candidates who have passed and
are therefore eligible for election.
