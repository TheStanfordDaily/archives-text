# THE
						"STANDARD" DICTIONARY
## Receives the Grand Prize at the World's Fair in St. Louis 
### 
The new, revised, and enlarged
edition of the Standard Diction
ary, printed from new electrotype
plates, contains in a comprehensive
supplement 17,000 new defined
vocabulary terms and additional
meanings that have come into the
language through advances in liter
ature, in the sciences, and in the
arts through universal progress,
thus making the Standard Diction
ary the most recent and compre
hensive dictionary of the English
language yet published. The text
of the dictionary throughout has
been carefully revised.
This comprehensive revision is
the work of trained editors, sta
tisticians, and specialists; there
fore, it is felt that it will commend
the Standard Dictionary to every
one interested in the advance made
in lexicography during recent years.
The editors have endeavored to
maintain the standard of perfection
aimed at in the preparation of the
original edition of this work. Their
purpose has been to bring before
the English speaking peoples a
rich harvest of words gleaned dur
ing the past few years, and thus
make the new and revised edition
a worthy successor of its predeces
sors. Special pains have been
taken to make the definitions defini
tive, clear, concise, and exact.
Recent experiments and research
have added a wealth of terms to the
language, especially in the depart
ments of Aeronautics, Electricity,
Electromagnetic Induction, En
gineering, Entomology, Games and
Sports, Literature, Locomotion,
Natural Science, Radiography, Tele
pathy, Theology, Wireless Tele
graphy, etc.

A valuable department of "faulty
