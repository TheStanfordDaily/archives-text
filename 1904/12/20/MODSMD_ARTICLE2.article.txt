# TEN YARDS IN THREE DOWNS.
## Radical Changes in Football Rules Are Proposed by Walter Camp of Yale. 
### 
Walter Camp's reply to the charge
of J. M. Hallowell, Harvard '97,
that football had degenerated into
a contest of "brute strength," is
published in the latest Yale Alumni
News. Camp says, in part:
"Why not let the success of the
original five-yard rule lead us to
just some such radical legislation,
easily ruled, thoroughly simple,
that public and players would at
once understand? Such a rule has
been suggested by many and it
seems to me that the time is ripe
for it, and that is to require that a
team must make double the dis
tance now required, that is, ten
yards in three trials, or surrender
the ball. This may not do all we
wish for the game, but it insures
the progress of the ball at twice the
present rate, or else a kick, where
as no one can tell any more than
they have been able to for the last
half dozen years what other legis
lation, even though properly in
tended, might do toward that end.
"Another thing which leads me
to make this suggestion with even
more insistence is that men who
worked with me in the sport, who
have been equally anxious over its
future, men who care enough about
the game to take up the pen in its
behalf, like Frank Butterworth and
Ralph Paine of Yale, for example,
and I dare say dozens of my foot
ball friends at Harvard and else
where, all want to see it opened up
without further experimenting or
patching together parts of various
suggestions. We want the rule di
rect, not indirect in its results.
There is no beating about the bush,
and it puts it to the players to
make longer runs or kicks.
"As to the increasing element of
concentrated brute force and weight
which you indicate is necessary to
make the modern "pile driver," as
you call it, may I refer you to 11.
M. Hodge's article in Outing in
1887, as follows:
"'Harvard's attempt for 1887
seems to have been to overcome
with unprecedentedly heavy rushing
the always sharper tackling of
Yale and Princeton, and Harvard's
success at this kind of game has
been remarkable.'
"Couple this with your own
words, written at that time as fol
lows, and you will see that there
were similar complaints in those
days to the ones that are being ad
vanced now:
" ' In 1887, for the first time in
many years: Harvard began the
season on an equal footing with
Yale and Princeton, with an equal
knowledge of the science of the
game, and as clear a perception of
what the requirements of the com
ing year would be. Instead of
tamely imitating the game of the
previous year as played by the two
other colleges, she mapped out a
plan of work of her own and devel
oped a scientific heavy rushing game,
a system in striking contrast to the
Yale and Princeton style.'
"As to your conclusion that the
present style of game is necessarily

one of weight alone, only year be
fore last Yale played in her game
with Harvard, Rockwell, Metcalf,
Chadwick, Vanderpoel and Raf
ferty, five men out of eleven, whose
average weight would amount to
between 150 and 160 pounds.
"Hut was the game of the past as
satisfactory as in looking back
there is a tendency to see it? In
your article regarding what the
Harvard committee found about
the game in 1885, it would appear
that the game had some objection
able features, although, as I say,
the mists of time have made it
seem better than the present game.
I quote again: You say: 'The com
mittee had attended the four prin
cipal championship games of the
season, and at each of these games
they had stationed themselves in
different parts of the field, in order
to notice what seemed to be the ob
jectionable features of the play.
Their report sayw, in every one of
these games there was brutal fight
ing with the fists, when the men
had to be separated by other play
ers or by the judges and referee or
by the bystanders and police.'
"As to the over-coaching you
speak of, every man has a right to
his own view of recreation; but if
he is selected to represent his club
or his university, he ought to feel
the responsibility of playing as
good a game as possible, and of
learning to play as well as he can.
1 know of no sport wherein to play
well does not demand the drudgery
of more practice than would exact
ly be classed ss fun. An individual
may do as he likes, but if he is to
be a part of a team he must be
adapted to the team."

Walter Camp's reply to the charge
of J. M. Hallowell, Harvard '97,
that football had degenerated into
a contest of "brute strength," is
published in the latest Yale Alumni
News. Camp says, in part:
"Why not let the success of the
original five-yard rule lead us to
just some such radical legislation,
easily ruled, thoroughly simple,
that public and players would at
once understand? Such a rule has
been suggested by many and it
seems to me that the time is ripe
for it, and that is to require that a
team must make double the dis
tance now required, that is, ten
yards in three trials, or surrender
the ball. This may not do all we
wish for the game, but it insures
the progress of the ball at twice the
present rate, or else a kick, where
as no one can tell any more than
they have been able to for the last
half dozen years what other legis
lation, even though properly in
tended, might do toward that end.
"Another thing which leads me
to make this suggestion with even
more insistence is that men who
worked with me in the sport, who
have been equally anxious over its
future, men who care enough about
the game to take up the pen in its
behalf, like Frank Butterworth and
Ralph Paine of Yale, for example,
and I dare say dozens of my foot
ball friends at Harvard and else
where, all want to see it opened up
without further experimenting or
patching together parts of various
suggestions. We want the rule di
rect, not indirect in its results.
There is no beating about the bush,
and it puts it to the players to
make longer runs or kicks.
"As to the increasing element of
concentrated brute force and weight
which you indicate is necessary to
make the modern "pile driver," as
you call it, may I refer you to 11.
M. Hodge's article in Outing in
1887, as follows:
"'Harvard's attempt for 1887
seems to have been to overcome
with unprecedentedly heavy rushing
the always sharper tackling of
Yale and Princeton, and Harvard's
success at this kind of game has
been remarkable.'
"Couple this with your own
words, written at that time as fol
lows, and you will see that there
were similar complaints in those
days to the ones that are being ad
vanced now:
" ' In 1887, for the first time in
many years: Harvard began the
season on an equal footing with
Yale and Princeton, with an equal
knowledge of the science of the
game, and as clear a perception of
what the requirements of the com
ing year would be. Instead of
tamely imitating the game of the
previous year as played by the two
other colleges, she mapped out a
plan of work of her own and devel
oped a scientific heavy rushing game,
a system in striking contrast to the
Yale and Princeton style.'
"As to your conclusion that the
present style of game is necessarily

one of weight alone, only year be
fore last Yale played in her game
with Harvard, Rockwell, Metcalf,
Chadwick, Vanderpoel and Raf
ferty, five men out of eleven, whose
average weight would amount to
between 150 and 160 pounds.
