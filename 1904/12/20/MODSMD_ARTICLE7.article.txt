The proposed track meet between
the Freshmen and a team picked
from five leading high schools of
the State is something that ought
to receive the support of every one
connected with athletics. The re
sults of such a meet are bound to
be beneficial to Stanford's athletics.
Many first-rate athletes in the past
have gone from the very high
schools under consideration,to other
colleges, for the very simple reason
that they did not know what sort
of place Stanford is. The sugges
ted field meet will at least bring
these men to the campus, and when
they have seen what Stanford really
is we will have more than an even
chance for having them stay with
us permanently.
