# Hamlet Competition.
## 
### 
Essays entered in competition for
the prize of a complete set of the
Temple edit ion of Shakspere, offered
by Mr. Hen Greet, must be sub
mitted by January 1, 1905. They
should be signed by a fictitious
name, and accompanied by a sealed
envelope containing the real name
of the author as well as tlie fictiti
ous. The essays should be marked
"Hamlet Competition," and be sent
to Box 792, Stanford University.
It is Mr. Greet's idea that the
essays, which are to be approxi
mately 300 words long, should be
upon the play of Hamlet itself,
rather than upon the acting of it.
The contest is open to any student
in the University. The award will
be made by a committee composed
of Mr. Greet and two members of
the Stanford faculty.
