# SCHOLARSHIP AT OXFORD.
## Dr. Frank Angell Brings Out Many of the Advantages of a Rhodes Scholarship. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir —In response to your
inquiry that I give my opinion on
the worth of a Rhodes scholarship
for an American student I would
reply, speaking from an inexperi
ence be it said of an inconsiderable
breadth and depth, that I feel that
a career at Oxford can hardly help
being of much value to any sane,
healthy-minded young American.
The fact that the natural and
technical sciences are better
equipped and taught in this coun
try than in England does not enter
into the question, as the recipients
of the scholarship must have done
this preparatory work in great part
in Greek and Latin, and therefore
presumably will carry along their
university work in the classics —
the humanities — or in some other
of the elective "honor schools" —
say history or English, or perhaps
in some graduate work along these
lines. And the student who se
lects an Oxford "honor"'course will
annually have received a sounder,
broader, and more coherent uni
versity education than falls to the
lot of our American magistre artium,
not to speak of many a Ph. D.
The earlier years of the Oxford
course, supposing a man does not
take graduate work, do not aim to
fit him for any definite position, or
to equip him for investigation, but
truly speaking the aim is to turn
out the English, — perhaps Anglo-
Saxon —ideal of a man, and for this
end academic work is hardly more
important than the Bocial and ath
letic life. The success of the sys
tem is seen in the records of Eng
lish administration, into which a
great deal of the best English
ability enters. The standard of
efficiency, justice, and incorrupti
bility in places of administrative
trust throughout the large British
Empire is set by the university
man, and the record is one of
which England may well be proud.
It may be that our American
student does not elect an "honor"
course, or even what we call gradu
ate work. Mr. Rhodes specifies
that his beneficiaries should be
chosen with regard to scholarship,
athletic abilities, and social and
moral qualities in the order named,
and if the "sporting" tendencies
predominate in our fallen country
man, he may avoid the studious
Baliol and enter the nine genial
portals of Brasenose. He can get
all the hard work he wants at
Brasenose; in fact, if he does not
do good work his scholarship will
lapse. But suppose the outcome of
his educational career at Oxford is
what Heipley years ago suggested
was the chief effort of English
technical training—the acquire
ment of gentlemanly manners and
eminent proficiency in cricket —
what then?
When the football season, just
passed, was at its height, the stu
dents of a Middle-Western col
lege worked out and put into
successful operation the felicitous
plan of shanghaing the captain of
the rival college team, putting him

in irons and imprisoning him over
night in the cellar of their own
captain's house the night before
their big game. Should any
Rhodes scholar come from that
part of the Middle West, where
football strategy of this particular
type is in vogue, it will be gener
ally conceded that his English ex
perience would be of value to him
should he acquire but the force of
the two accomplishments in the
Heipleian category. In fact the
influence of the athletic life at
Oxford cannot but be beneficial to
a student accustomed to the super
heated atmosphere of American
intercollegiate sports. The spirit
of fair play, the courtesy of contest
—taken as a matter of course —the
playing of the game for the game's
sake; the absence of hysterical
ebullition, either in victory or de
feat, the universal prevalence of
sport —everybody doing something
every day,—all should have an ex
ceedingly healthful influence on the
American student athlete.
Next to this, the social life at
Oxford will open the American's
eyes as to what democracy and
good-fellowship in college should
amount to. At Harvard a man
may and often does go through his
college course a hermit —alone in
study and recreation. This is
hardly possible at Oxford. Unless
the student insists on "sporting his
oak" he must be urged from the
very first to come out and to join
literary and debating societies, and
from his tutor he will get all the
invitations to teas and breakfasts
that he will find time to accept.
The spirit of the cliques, whether
of the social club, fraternity or
athletic organization which bo often
cuts across the college spirit in
this country, finds no place at Ox
ford, and I fail to see how the
American can reside there three
years without getting a deeper sense
of his social rights and duties than
he will obtain from any college in
America. And there are many
other influences which a Rhodes
scholar should absorb at Oxford,
which will make him a better
American and a better citizen: the
simplicity of most of the Oxford
student's pleasures, his enjoyment
of outdoor life in all its phases, his
imbued politeness, his lack of
cynicism and consequent trust
in his fellow students—all, it seems
to me cannot fail to make a most
excellent superstructure as a basis
of American energy and independ
ence. Nor will it be possible for
any American to abide in England
three years without learning per
haps the most valuable lesson that
England has to give him—the Eng
lishman's obedience to law, not be
cause he fears it, but because he
respects it.
It is possible, but I hope not
probable, that a man may get but
little good from his Oxford course
because he can see no good in any
thing that is not American. I have
met such folk in a procession of
Cook's tourists. More probable is
the case when a man may find that
his lines have fallen in such pleas
ant places that he has but little de
sire to return to the strenuousness
of American life. But it is not
probable that any of the Rhodes

scholars will be cut out of material
of this kind. The American ex
aminers will probably see to it that
independence of character is a
qualification of the candidates they
choose. And on such a basis it
seems to me that a Rhodes scholar
should return to us as a broader,
stronger man and a more valuable
citizen. In conclusion I would
commend all who are interested in
this matter to read Corbin's "An
American at Oxford" —a delightful
as well as an excellent book. There
are two copies in the Stanford Li
brary of which Professor Sewtfrd
has one and I the other, but pre
sumably both copies will be back
within a few days. F. Angell.

ence. Nor will it be possible for
any American to abide in England
three years without learning per
haps the most valuable lesson that
England has to give him—the Eng
lishman's obedience to law, not be
cause he fears it, but because he
respects it.
It is possible, but I hope not
probable, that a man may get but
little good from his Oxford course
because he can see no good in any
thing that is not American. I have
met such folk in a procession of
Cook's tourists. More probable is
the case when a man may find that
his lines have fallen in such pleas
ant places that he has but little de
sire to return to the strenuousness
of American life. But it is not
probable that any of the Rhodes

scholars will be cut out of material
of this kind. The American ex
aminers will probably see to it that
independence of character is a
qualification of the candidates they
choose. And on such a basis it
seems to me that a Rhodes scholar
should return to us as a broader,
stronger man and a more valuable
citizen. In conclusion I would
commend all who are interested in
this matter to read Corbin's "An
American at Oxford" —a delightful
as well as an excellent book. There
are two copies in the Stanford Li
brary of which Professor Sewtfrd
has one and I the other, but pre
sumably both copies will be back
within a few days. F. Angell.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir —In response to your
inquiry that I give my opinion on
the worth of a Rhodes scholarship
for an American student I would
reply, speaking from an inexperi
ence be it said of an inconsiderable
breadth and depth, that I feel that
a career at Oxford can hardly help
being of much value to any sane,
healthy-minded young American.
The fact that the natural and
technical sciences are better
equipped and taught in this coun
try than in England does not enter
into the question, as the recipients
of the scholarship must have done
this preparatory work in great part
in Greek and Latin, and therefore
presumably will carry along their
university work in the classics —
the humanities — or in some other
of the elective "honor schools" —
say history or English, or perhaps
in some graduate work along these
lines. And the student who se
lects an Oxford "honor"'course will
annually have received a sounder,
broader, and more coherent uni
versity education than falls to the
lot of our American magistre artium,
not to speak of many a Ph. D.
The earlier years of the Oxford
course, supposing a man does not
take graduate work, do not aim to
fit him for any definite position, or
to equip him for investigation, but
truly speaking the aim is to turn
out the English, — perhaps Anglo-
Saxon —ideal of a man, and for this
end academic work is hardly more
important than the Bocial and ath
letic life. The success of the sys
tem is seen in the records of Eng
lish administration, into which a
great deal of the best English
ability enters. The standard of
efficiency, justice, and incorrupti
bility in places of administrative
trust throughout the large British
Empire is set by the university
man, and the record is one of
which England may well be proud.
It may be that our American
student does not elect an "honor"
course, or even what we call gradu
ate work. Mr. Rhodes specifies
that his beneficiaries should be
chosen with regard to scholarship,
athletic abilities, and social and
moral qualities in the order named,
and if the "sporting" tendencies
predominate in our fallen country
man, he may avoid the studious
Baliol and enter the nine genial
portals of Brasenose. He can get
all the hard work he wants at
Brasenose; in fact, if he does not
do good work his scholarship will
lapse. But suppose the outcome of
his educational career at Oxford is
what Heipley years ago suggested
was the chief effort of English
technical training—the acquire
ment of gentlemanly manners and
eminent proficiency in cricket —
what then?
When the football season, just
passed, was at its height, the stu
dents of a Middle-Western col
lege worked out and put into
successful operation the felicitous
plan of shanghaing the captain of
the rival college team, putting him

in irons and imprisoning him over
night in the cellar of their own
captain's house the night before
their big game. Should any
Rhodes scholar come from that
part of the Middle West, where
football strategy of this particular
type is in vogue, it will be gener
ally conceded that his English ex
perience would be of value to him
should he acquire but the force of
the two accomplishments in the
Heipleian category. In fact the
influence of the athletic life at
Oxford cannot but be beneficial to
a student accustomed to the super
heated atmosphere of American
intercollegiate sports. The spirit
of fair play, the courtesy of contest
—taken as a matter of course —the
playing of the game for the game's
sake; the absence of hysterical
ebullition, either in victory or de
feat, the universal prevalence of
sport —everybody doing something
every day,—all should have an ex
ceedingly healthful influence on the
American student athlete.
Next to this, the social life at
Oxford will open the American's
eyes as to what democracy and
good-fellowship in college should
amount to. At Harvard a man
may and often does go through his
college course a hermit —alone in
study and recreation. This is
hardly possible at Oxford. Unless
the student insists on "sporting his
oak" he must be urged from the
very first to come out and to join
literary and debating societies, and
from his tutor he will get all the
invitations to teas and breakfasts
that he will find time to accept.
The spirit of the cliques, whether
of the social club, fraternity or
athletic organization which bo often
cuts across the college spirit in
this country, finds no place at Ox
ford, and I fail to see how the
American can reside there three
years without getting a deeper sense
of his social rights and duties than
he will obtain from any college in
America. And there are many
other influences which a Rhodes
scholar should absorb at Oxford,
which will make him a better
American and a better citizen: the
simplicity of most of the Oxford
student's pleasures, his enjoyment
of outdoor life in all its phases, his
imbued politeness, his lack of
cynicism and consequent trust
in his fellow students—all, it seems
to me cannot fail to make a most
excellent superstructure as a basis
of American energy and independ
ence. Nor will it be possible for
any American to abide in England
three years without learning per
haps the most valuable lesson that

lishman's obedience to law, not be
