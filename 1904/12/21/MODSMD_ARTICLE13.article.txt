# Lob Angeles High School Wins.
## 
### 
The Los Angeles high school
gained the interscholastic cham
pionship of the state by defeating
the Lick high school in a football
game played at Los Angeles, Satur
day. The game was sensational
and evenly matched, but marred
by a dispute over the final and de
ciding touch-down. The point at
issue was a question of downs.
