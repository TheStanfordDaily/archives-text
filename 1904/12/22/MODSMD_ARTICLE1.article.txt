# CHESS TOURNAMENT ENDS.
## Nine New Men Make Club and Will Enter Try-out for Team Next Semester. 
### 
The fall tournament of the Chess
Club was completed yesterday, and
as a result nine new members were
added to the Chess Club, and will
be eligible to participate in the
tournament which will be held next
semester to determine the team
that will represent Stanford in the
match with California in April.
The other five men who will take
part in this try-out are veterans of
former intercollegiate matches, and
hold their positions in the club
permanently.
Of the nineteen men who entered
the tournament, eleven completed
the requisite twelve games and
handed in their final scores. The
best individual showing was made
by A. R. Mac Swain, '08, who won
all twelve of his games. Five of
the other players were tied, win
ning eight and losing four games;
and the remaining three averaged
above fifty per cent in their final
scores.
The following men made the
club: A. R. Mac Swain, '08, L.
Newland, '08, E. W. Doane, '05, J.
P. Cassell, '07, C. I. Chandler, '08,
R. S. Woods, '08, H. R. Thomas,
'07, C. E. Spaulding, '08, T. R.
W. F. Figg-Hoblyn, '08. J. E.
Cashing, '08, and R. V. Garratt,
'07, also completed their scores,
but their percentage fell a little be
low the qualifying mark.
Of the old members of the club,
R. A. Fuller, '05, M. M. Stearns,
'06, and G. E. Dole, '07, were mem
bers of last year's intercollegiate
team, which played a tie with
California. The other two men are
N. C. Powers, '05, and F. P.
Whitaker, '05, both of whom
played in former intercollegiate
matches.
The result of the fall semester
is highly encouraging in view of
the large number of new men who
succeeded in making places in the
club. Especially significant is the
fact that six of the nine new men
are Freshmen, and that in making
their places these men crowded out
four former members of the club
who tried out this year but met
defeat at the hands of the new
men. Only two of the members of
last year's club, aside from the
members of the team, succeeded in
holding their places. The Chess
Club is fortunate in having this
new material to fall back on this
year, as four new Varsity players
must be picked in next semester's
try-out.
