# BOAT CLUB PLANS.
## The
						Rowing Season Will Open with New Equipment and Much Good Material. 
### 
Preparations for boating during
the next semester are already in
progress. The showing made by
last year's crews gave evidence that
boating is possible at Stanford. The
interest in the sport has been in
creasing since that time, and from
present indications boating in the
future will be included in the regu
lar series of college athletic events.
There have been several enthusi
astic meetings this semester by men
who are interested in the sport.
The Boating Club was reorganized
the first of this college year, and
many new men have joined the
club. There are about seventy-five
active members now in college, and
the number will be materially in
creased next semester.
In last year's contest with Cali
fornia and Washington it was evi
dent that the old barges which the
crews used would, sooner or later,
have to be replaced by shells. To
accomplish this end California,
Washington and Stanford have all
ordered shells,which are being built
in the East, and will arrive some
time during January. The new
shell secured is a four-oared boat,
and will be used in the intercolle
giate contest next semester. The
cost of the shell will be about $350.
The club has in its treasury about
$200. The English Club has offered
to giveone-half the net receipts of it√ü
play, "Every Man in His Humour,"
to help defray the cost of the shell,
and to meet current expenses.
In regard to boats and men Stan
ford will be much better supplied
than last year. The place of Pro
fessor A. W. Smith, who coached
last year's crews, will be filled by
Professor W. F. Durand. Last sea
son all practice took place on "La
gunita," but this year provision is
being made to practice on the slough
near Coolev's landing. The Palo
Alto Gun Club has granted permis
sion to the Boat Club to build a
temporary boat-house on its land.
This building will be completed
early enough to house the new shell
on its arrival. The new men will
be given work in the barges on "La
gunita," and those who show good
form will be allowed to use the
shells.
There are a number of men in
the Freshman class who have had
considerable experience in rowing,
and the Freshman crew should be
a strong one.
Of last year's first crew W. H.
Dole,'os, captain, H. G. Butterfield,
'05, and R. H. Gaither, '05, will be
in college next semester and will
try for the crew. These men, to
gether with other strong material
on hand,should insure a good Var
sity crew.
