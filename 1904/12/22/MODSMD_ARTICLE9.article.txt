This issue of the Daily Palo
Alto is the last of the present se
mester. The policy of the paper
during the past four months has
been to carry out the ideas and
methods which have been put into
effect by the editors of the past
three and a half years, and further
more, to more thoroughly systema
tize the work of covering the news
field of the University. Two years
ago competition for places on the
staff of the paper was made much
more close than ever before. Later
the number of members on the edi
torial board was limited to the
editor-in-chief, a managing editor,
a news editor, four associate editors,
and eight assistants. These changes
have proved to be successful to a
degree where they may now be con
sidered to be an enduring part of
the future policy of the paper. The
principal effort which has been
made during the past semester to
perfect the system of news-gathering
has been an attempt to make the
work of the staff members easier
without lessening the closeness of
competition. Accordingly every
member of the staff has had a cer
tain definite field to cover. The
objects of this innovation have
been: first, to relieve each of the
staff members from the work of try
ing to cover the entire news-field;
and second, to prevent annoyance
to those to whom we look for news-
There are some minor disadvan
tages connected with the system,but
the plan has resulted satisfactorily.
The ideals which past and present
editors have had in mind are not
yet fully worked out, nor can they
be except by the experience and
hard work that future experiment
will bring about. Whatever suc
cess the paper may have achieved
during the present semester may
be attributed to the hard and the
earnest purposes of those who have
assisted the editor-in-chief. That
their services are not fully ap

predated by the student body at
large ie certain, for the average
student cannot know the sacrifices
which the news-gatherer makes.
During the approaching semester
the Daily Palo Alto will be in
the hands of a man long experi
enced in newspaper work. He will
be supported by an able staff. The
paper has every hope of maintaining
the high place which it has long
held among the col lege daily papers
of the United States.
