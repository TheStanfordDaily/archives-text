# ALL-PACIFIC ELEVEN.
## Seven Stanford Men, Three Californians and One Nevadan Named by Rice. 
### 
In the December Alumnus, Archie
Rice, '95, has picked an "All-Paci
fic" football team, made up of the
best players of the year produced
by all the colleges of the Pacific
Coast and Western States. This
selection is interesting because of
the standing of Rice as a writer of
football, which he has followed
since the inauguration of football
games between Stanford and Cali
fornia. In the Alumnus Rice says:
"This time Stanford's team has
stood out so conspicuously above
all others—defeating Nevada 17-0,
Oregon 35-0, California 18-0, and
Colorado 3-3-0 —and the quality of
the individual material has beeti so
high, that it simply becomes a mat
ter of taking the whole Stanford
eleven and then searching for in
dividuals elsewhere who may be
good enough to displace some of
them. After such a process seven
Stanford men remain, and three of
the places are filled by California
and one by Nevada. The All-Pa
cific team thus formed would be:
"Center —Stroud (195), Califor
nia.
"Guards —Thompson (190), Sta
nford, and Roosevelt (190), Stanford.
''Tackles —Sprott (178), Stanford,
and Heitmuller (185), California.
"Ends —Clark (170), Stanford,
and Snedigar (175), California.
"Quarter —Stott (150), Stanford.
"Half-backs — Chalmers (175),
and Weller (195), Stanford.
"Full-back —Freisell (175), Ne
vada.
"Snedigar played half-back all
season, but he was too good a man
to be omitted from such an aggre
gation, and his pursuit tackles and
his great fleetness and strength
made him a valuable addition for
one end of the team. Nor was
Weller a half-back, and yet that
was all he was, though he played at
full. He could not be left off the
the team because of his wonderful
power in carrying the ball and
backing up a line. But as a full
back, Freisell of Nevada was in a
class by himself.
"This team would be strong in
every style of play, well balanced,
heavy, fast, sure at handling punts,
rangy and accurate at kicking, and
tremendous in scoring possibilities.
With proper practice it would
make the strongest hypothetical
eleven ever formed on the Pacific
Coast.
"Nevada had a noticeably good
man at left tackle, one of the Hart
brothers. Oregon had an admirable
quarter, Latourette, who ran his
team and played better than any of
the other quarters I saw, except
Stott. Pomona had an all-round
fast little team that it was a delight
to see play. And Willamette Uni
versity of Salem, Or., one of the
best teams of the Northwest coun
try, I understood, had a quarter,
Beach, who should be mentioned
among the first three or four on the
Pacific Slope.
"The season just past has shown
several commendable advances in
college football on the Pacific Slope.
Pomona and Oregon have demon

slrated to the biggest varsities what
really fast playing is like, where
the quarter does not dream over
his signals. The initial campus
games at Berkeley have proved a
tremendous success, beyond the
expectation of their advocates, and
to the complete discomfiture of all
the grumblers who wanted the big
intercollegiate game kept as an
event for San Francisco. And the
day of the athletic club team as an
important practice opponent of the
big varsities is no more. Nevada,
Oregon, Pomona, and the Riverside
Indians furnished better practice
than the clubs have in years, and
if Montana and some of the other
Northwestern teams come to Calif
ornia for games, football can be
maintained as it should be, —a col
lege game for college men on college
grounds."

grounds."
In the December Alumnus, Archie
Rice, '95, has picked an "All-Paci
fic" football team, made up of the
best players of the year produced
by all the colleges of the Pacific
Coast and Western States. This
selection is interesting because of
the standing of Rice as a writer of
football, which he has followed
since the inauguration of football
games between Stanford and Cali
fornia. In the Alumnus Rice says:
"This time Stanford's team has
stood out so conspicuously above
all others—defeating Nevada 17-0,
Oregon 35-0, California 18-0, and
Colorado 3-3-0 —and the quality of
the individual material has beeti so
high, that it simply becomes a mat
ter of taking the whole Stanford
eleven and then searching for in
dividuals elsewhere who may be
good enough to displace some of
them. After such a process seven
Stanford men remain, and three of
the places are filled by California
and one by Nevada. The All-Pa
cific team thus formed would be:
"Center —Stroud (195), Califor
nia.
"Guards —Thompson (190), Sta
nford, and Roosevelt (190), Stanford.
''Tackles —Sprott (178), Stanford,
and Heitmuller (185), California.
"Ends —Clark (170), Stanford,
and Snedigar (175), California.
"Quarter —Stott (150), Stanford.
"Half-backs — Chalmers (175),
and Weller (195), Stanford.
"Full-back —Freisell (175), Ne
vada.
"Snedigar played half-back all
season, but he was too good a man
to be omitted from such an aggre
gation, and his pursuit tackles and
his great fleetness and strength
made him a valuable addition for
one end of the team. Nor was
Weller a half-back, and yet that
was all he was, though he played at
full. He could not be left off the
the team because of his wonderful
power in carrying the ball and
backing up a line. But as a full
back, Freisell of Nevada was in a
class by himself.
"This team would be strong in
every style of play, well balanced,
heavy, fast, sure at handling punts,
rangy and accurate at kicking, and
tremendous in scoring possibilities.
With proper practice it would
make the strongest hypothetical
eleven ever formed on the Pacific
Coast.
"Nevada had a noticeably good
man at left tackle, one of the Hart
brothers. Oregon had an admirable
quarter, Latourette, who ran his
team and played better than any of
the other quarters I saw, except
Stott. Pomona had an all-round
fast little team that it was a delight
to see play. And Willamette Uni
versity of Salem, Or., one of the
best teams of the Northwest coun
try, I understood, had a quarter,
Beach, who should be mentioned
among the first three or four on the
Pacific Slope.
"The season just past has shown
several commendable advances in
college football on the Pacific Slope.
Pomona and Oregon have demon

slrated to the biggest varsities what
really fast playing is like, where
the quarter does not dream over
his signals. The initial campus
games at Berkeley have proved a
tremendous success, beyond the
expectation of their advocates, and
to the complete discomfiture of all
the grumblers who wanted the big
intercollegiate game kept as an
event for San Francisco. And the
day of the athletic club team as an
important practice opponent of the
big varsities is no more. Nevada,
Oregon, Pomona, and the Riverside
Indians furnished better practice
than the clubs have in years, and
if Montana and some of the other
Northwestern teams come to Calif
ornia for games, football can be
maintained as it should be, —a col
lege game for college men on college
grounds."
