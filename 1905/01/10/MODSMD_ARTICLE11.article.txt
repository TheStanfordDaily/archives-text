# Vacation Days on the Campus.
## 
### 
During the Christmas vacation
almost a hundred students re
mained on the campus. The most
popular form of out-door amuse
ment was baseball and tennis.
Numerous baseball matches were
held on the diamond between
picked nines, while many tennis
tournaments were held on the dif
ferent courts on the campus. The
most important social event during
the holidays was the dance given
by the members of Encina Club
who had remained on the campus.
The dance, which was held on New
Y'ear's eve, was given in Roble
gymnasium, which was prettily
decorated for the occasion.
