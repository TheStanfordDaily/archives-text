# DR. JORDAN'S RETURN.
## Vice â€“ President Branner Also Due from His Vacation in a Day or Two. 
### 
President Jordan returned to the
University last Tuesday, after an
absence of several days spent in a
tour of Oregon and Washington.
His trip to the Northwest was made
for the special purpose of addressing
the annual convention of the Wash
ington State Teachers' Association,
held at Spokane. The subject of his
address was"The Call of the Twen
tieth Century." He delivered no
other addresses in the Northwest
because of the bad condition of his
throat, which had not yet entirely
recovered from its recent attack of
tonsillitis. In San Francisco last
Sunday he occupied the pulpit of
Trinity Episcopal Church, discus
sing the subject of divorce in its re
lation to American social life. Rev.
D. Charles Gardner also spoke from
the Trinity Church pulpit upon the
same subject.
Dr. J. C. Branner, head of the de
partment of Geology and Mining,
and vice-president of the Univer
sity, is expected to return to the
campus within a day or two. Dr.
Branner left the University early
last year in a search for health, and
he has spent his time in traveling
about the Eastern states and in
England and the continent. Last
month he presided over the annual
convention at Philadelphia of the
American Geological Society, of
which he is president.
