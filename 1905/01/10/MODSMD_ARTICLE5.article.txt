# DOLE THE WORLD'S CHAMPION.
## Pole-Vaulting Record Recognized By the Amateur Athletic Union of America. 
### 
The Amateur Athletic Union of
America has notified Norman E.
Dole, '05, that his wonderful vault
of 12 feet 1.32 inches has been
recognized as a world's record.

Dole received official information
of the recognition of his vault from
Herbert Hauser, secretary of the
Pacific Athletic Association, who
acted under directions from James
E. Sullivan, secretary of the Ama
teur Athletic Union of America.
This record-breaking vault was
performed at the try-out held last
April, under the auspices of the
Pacific Athletio Association, to se
lect a team to represent California
at the St. Louis Exposition. There
was no question of the officials of
this meet, as the measurements were
made by authorized representatives
of the Pacific Athletic Association;
The cause of the delay in accept
ing Dole's record was due to the
fact that the Amateur Athletic
Union had not been formally noti
fied that this meeting was to be
held. This was a mere technicality,
but it took a great deal of effort to
persuade the records committee of
the Amateur Athletic Union to
recognize this record. It was largely
due to the efforts of J. C. McCaugh
ern, '05, former Varsity track cap
tain, and a member of the national
records committee, that Dole re
ceived the title which he had fairly
earned.
It appears likely that Dole's re
cord will stand for some years. The
twelve-foot mark has been reached
since, but no other pole-vaulter has
ever attained the height reached by
Dole.
