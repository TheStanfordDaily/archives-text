It has been so well settled that
the Daily Palo Alto shall he con
ducted upon conservative lines that
it seems quite superfluous for an
incoming editor to announce any
special "policy.'' During the last
few years each succeeding editor
has sought to give the news of the
college community in a clean,
straightforward way, and to voice
editorially what has seemed the
best sentiment of the men and
women of the University. This
policy has given such excellent re
sults that any departure from it
now would be unwelcome. Those
who will make the paper this se
mester will, therefore, but follow
in the pathway that has been set
out, and if they approach the stand
ard of excellence maintained by
their predecessors, they will feel
that their work has been well done.
The practice inaugurated by a
recent editor of limiting the num
ber on the staff to fifteen, chosen
after a try-out that is a true test of
their ability and serious intentions,
has made a place upon the staff
mean a great deal more than it
formerly did, and has proven bene
ficial in other ways. As a conse
quence, it will be continued. In
the reorganization of the staff, L.
R. \Veinmann,'o6, takes the natural
promotion to the managing editor
ship, and B. S. Allen, '06, becomes
news editor. As a result of these
and other changes, one or two va
cancies exist upon the staff, to be
filled by new men. Competition
for these places will begin at once,
and the period of probation will be
the usual six weeks. Believing a
personal talk with each one of
those who are considering taking
up this form of college activity to;
he of more value than a general
conference, the editor will be glad
to meet prospective candidates at
the office of the Daily Pai o Alto
any afternoon before the end of the
week.
