# PLANS FOR NEW BLEACHERS.
## Specifications for Seating for Big Athletic Field are Being Drawn Up. 
### 
Plans for the bleachers to be
built at the new athletic field are
being drawn up under the direction
of Professor C. B. Wing of the En
gineering department. The work
of constructing the bleachers will
not be begun until the wet weather
is over, probably in April. The
time necessary for their erection is
not great, and there is no need of
haste.
Numerous plans and suggestions
were considered before the decision
as to the form of the bleachers was
made. During the holidays Pro
fessor Wing and Dr. F. Angell
made a trip to the University of
California for the purpose of in
specting the bleachers of the foot
ball field there. The bleachers
erected at Stanford will be modeled
along the same lines. It will not
be practical to adopt the suggestion
that the new bleachers be made
much steeper. Such a structure
would enable the spectator to see
the field even when a person in
front of him stood up in his seat.
But to accomplish this the bleachers
would have to be almost ninety feet
high. This would be about three
times the height of the California
bleachers, which are themselves
higher than the average stands.
The proposal that the seats should
be built somewhat oval in form
had also to be abandoned. Such a
structure would involve a great
deal of carpenter work, thereby
greatly increasing the expense. The
limited amount of money available
for the new field makes it necessary
to proceed as economically as pos
sible. By erecting square bleach
ers, the work can be done quickly
and cheaply. In the construction
of the California bleachers, built at
a cost of $16,000, only two sizes of
lumber were used. Much of the ex
pense of this field was involved in
grading, of which little will need
to be done on the Stanford field.
The seats both of California and
Stanford are not intended to be
permanent. Wood frame struc
tures of this kind become unsafe
after ten or twelve years. As sec
tions of the seats on the new field
become unfit for use they will be
torn down and replaced by granite
and concrete structures of a durable
type.
A temporary design of the plan
of the new athletic grounds has
been made. This map includes
space for fields for Rugby football,
association football, baseball, track
and supplementary baseball and
football fields,and leaves considera
ble space for further extensions.
The baseball, football and track
bleachers are arranged so as to be
close together. The training-house
is located under the bleachers in
such a way that it connects with
both the track and gridiron.
Although this design is but the
first draft of the plans, it is doubt
less very much like the plans that
will finally be adopted.
