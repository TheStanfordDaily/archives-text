Are we to drop away entirely
from the singing of our college
anthem, "Hail, Stanford, Hail"?
This morning we had an Assembly,
and it was not sung. Nor was it
sung at the final Assembly of last
semester, nor at the Assembly be
fore that. At these two last-men
tioned Assemblies there was per
haps a little excuse —a very little
excuse: the speakers of the day
had overstepped the time limit,
and in the grind of University life
we work to it certain extent by the
clock. To-day there was no excuse
at all, for the speaker finished fif
teen minutes before the hour-bell
rang. Undoubtedly the omission
is due merely to forgetfulness. But
practically every Assembly since
Assemblies were inaugurated, these
instances excepted, has closed with
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," and so it
ought always to be. Most of us —
probably every man and woman in
the University —love that song,
and we are better for the singing of
it. There are few of us who would
not gladly postpone our luncheon
a few minutes to sing it, and to
sing all of it; and there are many
who feel a tense of personal loss
when it is passed by. It has been
in the past and should continue a
part of the program of any gather
ing of Stanford people, and es
pecially of University Assemblies.
Let's get on our feet and sing it
with the best that's in us, and we'll
go away with a better spirit. It's
the spirit of our alma mater: keep
it warm !
