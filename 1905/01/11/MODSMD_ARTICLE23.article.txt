# ADDRESS BY JACOB RIIS.
## Famous Reformer Makes an Interesting Speech in Assembly Hall. 
### 
The first University Assembly
of the semester was held in Assem
bly Hall at 9:15 this morning,
when Jacob A. Riis, the famous
New York writer and student of
slum conditions, addressed an un
usually large audience of students
and faculty members. Riis has
been on the campus the past two
days as the guest of Dr. Jordan.
Among other things the lecturer
said:
"The world does not pine nearly
so much for the man on horseback,
for the man with the flaming
sword, as it does for the man who
is not afraid to wear patches on
his trousers. The world of our day
is going to be run by the man who
can, by the man who will. The
world is not going to wait for the
lazy man.
"You all have no use for the
chap who thinks there is nothing
in the world worth while. Such a
fellow should be knocked in the
head. The Lord does his work on
this earth with our hands, and if it
is not done by this generation, it
will lie undone until a generation
comes that will do his bidding.
The millennium will come when
everyone engaged in business puts
his whole honest soul into his ef
forts, as did Patrick Mullin, the
humble gunmaker who gained the
confidence and esteem of famous
men the world over by his upright
methods."
Riis, who is a biographer and
ardent admirer of President Roose
velt, referred frequently to the
Chief Executive's life and maxims
as good examples of the success of
useful living. In this connection
he said:
"Belief in his fellow-man is one
of the mighty secrets of Roosevelt's
life. Love our fellow-man: that
is the holy writ. If there is bad
detest what is bad, but love that
which is good. Y"ou have no idea
what good you can compel in a
man by believing in what is good
in that man.
'"Someone has said that Roose
velt is great along many lines—but
his chief greatness lies in his splen
did, robust, manly principles of
life. He is not a genius—unless
genius is the capacity for taking
infinite pains. The President says:
'If you are to be a man, lie ready.'
The one who has trained himself to
take the chance when it comes,
that is the man who will win."
