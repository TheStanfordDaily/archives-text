## Sixty-two Students Suspended for a Semester and Seventy-eight Warned. 
### 
The work of theScholarshipCom
mittee upon the departmental re
ports covering the work of the se
mester ending in December has
been completed and the figures
announced from the Registrar's of
fice. Because of the lack of scholar
ship shown in their work during
the semester, sixty-two students
were suspended from the Univer
sity until next August, and seventy
eight others were warned that the
quality of their work must be ma
terially improved if they desire to
remain in the University after the
the next weeding out occurs. Of
the sixty-two suspended, it is inter
esting to note that but three were
women, and of the total number
warned only eleven were women.
The practice of tabulating the sus
pensions and warnings by depart
ments for the information of the
student body has been discontinued.
Hereafter only the totaled figures
will be announced, without en
lightenment as to the losses of the
different departments.
The figures, when compared with
those of the first semester a year
ago, may be said to be somewhat
lighter. A year ago but fifty-two
were suspended, as against sixty
two this year. But a greater num
ber were warned last year, the
figures being ninety-three as against
seventy-eight, and it must be re
membered that registration last
semester was about sixty heavier
than a year ago. Keeping in mind
these circumstances, it will be seen
that although there is an increase
of suspension by ten, the statistics
on the whole are quite satisfactory.
