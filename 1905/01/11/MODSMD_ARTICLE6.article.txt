# Memorial Church Mosaics.
## 
### 
The work of changing the large
figures in the mosaics at each side
of the picture over the entrance to
Memorial Church is nearing com
pletion. The mosaic figures on the
right side have already been in
serted, and it is expected that the
rest of the work will he completed
within the week. The new mosaics,
which were brought here last Octo
ber from Naples, Italy, form a con
tinuation of the large central mo
saic which represents the "Sermon
on the Mount." In each mosaic
there are three figures in attitudes
of devotion and adoration. Work
on the interior of the church will
not he recommenced until the ex
terior mosaics are completed.
