# BASEBALL PRACTICE MONDAY.
## Four Varsity Men Return to Form Nucleus of This Year's Nine. 
### 
The first baseball practice of the
season will take place next Monday
afternoon at 4:ls,and the men will
be expected to appear for work
every day until the close of the
sepson. Light fielding and batting
practice similar to the work en
gaged in last fall will be tried at
first, but the nine will soon take a
more definite form, as practice
games are to be played this
month.
Coach Cowden will arrive on the
campus next Sunday,and will take
charge of the men when they report
on Monday. Captain Trowbridge
will assist Cowden in training the
men, as it is expected that there
will be a large number of candi
dates, due to the inauguration of
the intercollegiate Freshman game
this year. Both Freshman and
Varsity candidates will probably
be kept in one squad until the
interclass games have been played.
It is the intention of both cap
tain and coach to have the inter
class championship decided as early
as possible this season in order
that more time may be given to
the development of Btrong Varsity
and Freshman teams. With this
end in view the interclass games
will probably be played during
the latter part of this month.
Four men who played in the
intercollegiate series against Cali
fornia last spring have returned to
collegeâ€”Captain Trowbridge, Sales,
Colbert, and Chalmers. Trow
bridge played short-stop, Colbert
first base, Chalmers left field, and
Sales pitched in the second and
third intercollegiate games. This
Beason Stanford has fewer Varsity
men around whom to build a team
than for a number of years past.
With but four old men, and only
one of those four, Trowbridge, who
has played on the team more than
one Beason, Stanford is facing a
situation almost identical with that
of California's nine last year, when
the Blue and Gold had but three
veterans as a nucleus for a team.
Though Stanford is weak in old
men, the men who have returned
played the most important posi
tions on the team. Sales should
pitch a strong game this season,
and it seems probable that from
his showing last year Stott will
catch. These excellent players
will form one of the strongest bat
teries Stanford has had in several
years. It is possible that Chal
mers, who played left field last
season, will be tried at third base.
He played this position during the
early part of last season, and if
this change is made the Varsity
will have a strong infield, with the
exception of second base, which is
vacant. This would also leave the
three places in the outfield to be
filled by new men.
The vacancies will have to be
filled by second-team players or
men from the entering class. The
first-year men are still to a large
extent an unknown quality, though
a few of them gave evidence during
fall practice of being Varsity pos
sibilities.
