A great deal of significance at
taches to the simplestatement pub
lished last night that a strong flow
of water had heen secured by bor
ing behind the new Gymnasium.
The success of the efforts to find a
good pure supply is a matter for
rejoicing, for it seems to bring
closer a realization of the hope that
a swimming-tank in keeping with
the magnificent equipment of the
new Gymnasium will one day be
built. When the plans were drawn
for the new Gymnasium, so it is
stated, it was expected that it
would be necessary to pump water
for the baths and tank from the
bay, and because of the expense, it
was deemed advisable to cut down
the size of the swimming-tank. It
is understood, however, to be the
intention to construct outside of
the Gymnasium a tank that will
be entirely adequate to all the de
mands that may be made upon it.
It will be open to the sun and the
air, and it will be of a size which
will permit of the development of
water sports at Stanford as these
have been developed at some of the
Eastern universities, where the fa
cilities exißt. With the discovery
of water right beneath us and the
elimination of the expense of a
pumping station and pipe line, we
may fairly hope for the execution
of this plan at a date which will
permit of the enjoyment of the
pleasures and benefits of a real
tank by a majority of the men now
in college.
