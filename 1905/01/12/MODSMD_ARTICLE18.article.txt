In Collier's for December 31,
1904, Walter Camp announces the
personnel of the All-America team
for 1904. Caspar Whitney gives
his choice of a national eleven in
the January number of Outing,
of which magazine he is ed
itor.
Camp and Whitney agree on
seven men, six of whom are
awarded identically the same posi
tions, while in one instance Camp
puts Eckersall of Chicago on an
end, while Whitney makes him his
choice for full. Eckersall's remark
able punting assured him a place
on the team regardless of relative
position.
Both Camp and Whitney give
Pennsylvania the highest credit for
splendid development, and likewise
agree that Yale has the finest com
bination of the season.
The selection of an All-America
team has proven less of a problem
this year than ever before because
the stars were not bunched on two
or three teams. Piekarski of Penn
sylvania, Shevlin of Yale, Cooney
of Princeton, Tipton of West Point,
Hurley of Harvard, and Eckersall
of Chicago, each representing a dif
ferent university, were unanimously
chosen as seven members of the big
eleven.
Heston of Michigan, on Camp's
team as half-back, gives way to
Torrey of West Pointon Whitney's,
while Stevenson, the marvelous
Pennsylvania quarter, is barred
from Whitney's team because of a
tendency on his part to foul, which
finally sent him off the field.
Camp's team is as follows: Ends,
Shevlin of Yale and Eckersall of
Chicago; tackles, Cooney of Prince
ton and Hogan (captain) of Yale;
guards, Piekarski of Pennsylvania
and Kinney of Yale; center, Tipton
of West Point; quarter, Stevenson
of Pennsylvania; half-backs, Hes
ton of Michigan and Torney of
West Point; full-back, Smith of
Pennsylvania.
Whitney substitutes Gilman of
Dartmouth for Kinney of Yale as
guard; Spiek of Chicago for Ecker
sall of Chicago as end; Rockwell of
Yale for Stevenson of Pennsylvania
for end; Torney of West Point for
Heston of Michigan as half, and
Eckersall of Chicago for Smith of
Pennsylvania for full.
