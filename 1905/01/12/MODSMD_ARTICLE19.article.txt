# Cast Will Commence Rehearsals.
## 
### 
Work on "Every Man in His
Humour'' has been taken up with
out delay both by the cast and
committee, and although some few
positions on the cast remain in
doubt, a large majority of them
have been very satisfactorily filled.
In a few weeks the entire cast will
be announced.
At a meeting of the committee
yesterday a definite plan for hold
ing rehearsals was settled upon.
Four rehearsals will be held every
week from now on, but only two
acts will be rehearsed at a time,
which will make it easier for those
of the cast whose parts do not ex
tend through the entire play. The
first rehearsal of the semester, and
the second that has been held, will
take place Friday afternoon at
4:30, and the first two acts of the
play will be gone through. All the
members of the cast have been re
quested to hand in their study
cards, and the committee will en

deavor to select a time that is most
convenient for the majority.
Miss K. E. Traphagen, '04, who
was to have been in charge of the
designing of the costumes, getting
out the poster, and other art work
in connection with bringing out the
play, will not he in college this se
mester, and consequently this de
partment of the work will fall to
Miss C. Z. Edwards, '06.
