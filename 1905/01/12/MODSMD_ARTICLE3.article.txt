# Library Building Delayed.
## 
### 
Work on the new Library build
ing has been brought nearly to a
standstill by unforeseen delay in
obtaining the necessary building
material. Of the large force of
seventy-five men who were em
ployed on the building, all but
about half a dozen brick layers and
masons have been laid off. The
material whose scarcity is causing
the delay is the iron for the first
story flooring, etc. An order for
this iron was placed in Pittsburg
in good season and should have
arrived here some weeks ago. It
is believed that the delay is caused
by washouts which have tied up
the Eastern freight lines. It may
be several weeks before the iron
can be delivered here, and it is
feared this may prevent the con
tractors from completing the build
ing in the specified time.
