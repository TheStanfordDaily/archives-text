# DECEMBER "ALUMNUS."
## Story of Senator Stanford's Early Career and Other Items of Interest. 
### 
The December number of the
Alumnus, which was issued during
the vacation, contains many ar
ticles of live interest to Stanford.
The editor, Archie Rice, '95, states
that the circulation has passed the
700 mark, a gain of nearly 500 in
the first semester. From now on
the publication can more than pay
its way.
Of most interest to the general
reader, probably, is the article on
"The First Stanford Building in
California," with a picture of the
building. The article gives an un
published chapter in Senator Stan
ford's earliest years in California,
and a running summary of the de
velopment from a young lawyer
immigrant, who became a mining
camp storekeeper, through all the
stages of war Governor of Califor
nia, transcontinental railroad
builder, big rancher, horse-breeder,
United State√ü Senator, multi-mil
lionaire, and founder of Stanford
University.
There is a long and valuable ar
ticle on "The Training for a Min
ing Engineer," by H. C. Hoover,
'95, of London. The writer de
clares that practically all the great
gold mines of the world are now
operated by American engineering
methods; that seventy-five per cent
of all the gold mines of the world
are controlled by English capital;
that American mining engineers
nearly everywhere have precedence,
and that the proper training is
four years of technical work in the
colleges and two years of practical
laborer's work in mines before the
graduate can be well qualified. As
Hoover rose to a salary of $33,000
a year as a mining engineer within
five years after he worked his way
through Stanford, his statements
may be given some weight.
Two plans are suggested for
Stanford's new stadium: one to
have the tiers of seats arranged in
much steeper rowp, and the other
to have the grandstands in the
form of a perfect oval instead of a
parallelogram, with reasons given
for these changes. The All-Pacific
football team chosen annually by
Rice is announced.
"Paragraphs from Stanford Let
ters" is an article quoting things
from the editor's correspondence,
and it contains an arraignment of
the editor by one of the Stanford
sororities. Incidentally the editor
announces that the fraternities and
sororities will be written up later.
There are twelve other articles
dealing with University affairs, and
the number closes with the custom
ary "Personal Notes of Stanford
People."
