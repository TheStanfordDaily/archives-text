# BUSY ON SOPHOMORE PLAY.
## Cast Finally Selected and Rehearsals Are Being Held Regularly. 
### 
The Sophomore cast which will
present "The Rivals" on the night
of January 27th has been holding
two rehearsals daily since last Sat
urday. All the members of the
cast returned a few days before the
opening of the semester, and Mrs.
Powers, who has charge of the re
hearsals, is well satisfied with the
progress of the cast.
One notable feature of this pro
duction is the fact that all those
who will take part are members of
the Sophomore class. There are
eleven characters in the cast, and
two or more candidates tried out
for each part. This try-out system
proved to be very successful, and it
served to bring out a number of
good actors who are unknown to
the Stanford stage.
"The Rivals" is one of Sheridan's
best comedies, and has always been
a very popular production. The
comedy was written in 1774 and
was first acted at Covent Garden
in January, 1775. Sir Anthony
Absolute, the principal character in
the play, will be taken by J. C. Ray,
'07. Ray has not appeared in Stan
ford dramatics before, but he was
by far the best contestant for the
part of Sir Anthony. He has done
very well, and good critics predict
that he will be seen in future dra
matics.
I). M. Reynolds, '05, is stage
manager of the production. New
scenery has been purchased, and
the costumes will all be especially
designed for this presentation. Rey
nolds has staged several produc
tions here and he expects to sur
pass all previous efforts in this one.
The cast, as it has been finally
selected by Mrs. J. C. Powers, is as
follows:
Sir Anthony Absolute . .J. C. Ray
Captain Absolute. .G. C. Mansfield
Bob Acres R. S. Kellogg
Sir Lucius O'Trigger
