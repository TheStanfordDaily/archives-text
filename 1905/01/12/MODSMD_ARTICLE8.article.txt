# Play Tickets Stolen.
## 
### 
D. H. Clift, chairman of the
Sophomore play committee, has
discovered that a number of the
tickets for"The Rivals'' have been
stolen from the printing-office.
Clift was recently accosted in Palo
Alto by a boy who offered to sell
him at a low price a number of
tickets for the play which is to be
presented January 27th. When
the boy was questioned he stated
that the tickets had been given him
at the depot by a student who wore
a Sophomore hat. The student, the
boy said, had told him to sell the
tickets at any price. Clift at once
investigated the matter and found
that part of the regular]}' printed
tickets, which were in the printing
office, had been stolen. An effort
is now being made by the Sopho
more play committee to discover
the identity of the supposed student.
