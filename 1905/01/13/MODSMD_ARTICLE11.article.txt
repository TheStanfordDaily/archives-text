Within the next few days the
two upper classes will have meet
ings for the nomination of officers.
It is to be hoped that at these
meetings long-delayed justice will
be done to those men who repre
sented the classes in the tennis
tournament last semester. It is
now two and a half months since
the end of the contest, and until
to-day not a thing has been done
toward settling the question
whether or not sweaters should be
given to the men who participated,
as authorized by the Athletic Com
mittee. The delay has gained
nothing: the question might have
been settled in a day. Although
all four classes have the same issue
to decide, responsibility lies with
the upper classes, for whose action
the under classmen are waiting.
The problem is a comparatively
simple one for the Juniors, for
their men won both singles and
doubles. It is the Senior class pri
marily, therefore, which must de
cide whether sweaters shall be
given to men who did not win.
Against granting them, it is argued
mainly that it would increase the
number of class sweaters to be
granted each year and thus tend to
"cheapen" them. In favor of
granting tiiem, it is put forward
that the men who represented their
classes, even though they did not
win, yet did more work to earn the
sweaters than class baseball candi
dates usually do, and furthermore—
the most important reason, per
haps —that the chance of making
the sweater brought out an un
usually large amount of new tennis
material and developed an interest
in the sport which had not previ
ously existed at Stanford |for years.
The final decision in this matter
rests with each class, but the men
who played are entitled to know
that decision. If they are to have
sweaters at all, they should be
more than a post-graduation gift.
