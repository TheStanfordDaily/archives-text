# STUDY ON CARNOT QUESTION.
## Candidates for the Team Have Been Working Busily During the Vacation. 
### 
During the holidays of the past
three weeks the men who are work
ing for the Carnot team have been
poring over books bearing on the
church-and-state question as it ex
ists in France. The general sub
ject for the debate was posted here
and at California on November
16th. The subject as announced is
"The Relation of Church and State
in France since 1801." Thirteen
men handed in their names for the
try-out, but this number has since
been reduced to seven. These men
have been working steadily during
the holidays in preparation for the
try-out, which occurs in the chapel
on January 21st.
The librarians have aided ma
terially by gathering an extensive
bibliography, but even with this
aid most of the men have found
considerable difficulty in finding
articles bearing on the subject.
The try-out and the actual debate
itself will be on some specific ques
tion deduced from the general sub
ject, and most of the debaters have
decided that the choice of a topic
is limited to a few questions. This
makes study much easier, but even
this advantage seems to be offset by
the fact that most of the available
material is general and does not
bear upon the subject directly.
Most of the material is found in
magazine articles. Most of the men
have been working in the Univer
sity Library only, but some have
putin much of their time in the
city libraries. Those who have
studied in the city say that there
is considerable material there
which is not available here. The
most valuable articles in the city
are in religious magazines which
are not received at the University
Library.
The following men intend enter
ing the try-out: D. D. Sales, '06,
R. G. Barnett, '05, P. D. Swing,'os,
E. A. Cunha,'o6, J. L. Maloy, '06,
W. L. Blair, '05, A. Sherriffs, '05.
Of these, Swing, Cunha, Maloy,and
Sherriffs have studied in thecity li
braries. The others have spent all
their time here. All of the men
have had previous experience in
debating work, and a strong team
will be selected. Sales and Swing
represented their classes on their
Sophomore teams. Cunha and
Maloy debated on both their
Freshman and Sophomore teams.
Blair was alternate in his Fresh
man and Sophomore year. Sher
riffs is the only Varsity debater
trying out. He debated on his
class team in his Freshman year'
and the next year was a member
of the second team, which debated
with Washington. Last year he
was a member of both the Carnot
and Intercollegiate teams.
