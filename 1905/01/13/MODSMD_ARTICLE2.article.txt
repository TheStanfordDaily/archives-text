# TRACK WORK BEGINS MONDAY.
## Meets May Be Had With Universities of Southern California and Nevada. 
### 
The regular track season will
open Monday morning, when as
pirants for the team will sign up
and the training rules will go into
force. Trainer Moulton will be on
the oval every day from 10 to 12
and 4 to 6 to receive the names of
athletes who wish to try out for
the track team. The first field-day
of the season will be held in about
two weeks. It will partake of the
nature of an interclass meet, prob
ably the two upper against the two
lower classes.
The custom of replacing a pro
fessional rubber by students which
was inaugurated last year has
proved so successful that it will be
continued this season. Five stu
dents will be employed for this
purpose, and every man who ap
pears on the track will be permitted
the privilege of the rubbing-table
until the regular rubbing list is
made out.
The Pomona meet, which will
take place at Pomona during
Easter vacation, is attracting con
siderable interest, and it is pos
sible that the team which goes
south will also meet the University
of Southern California on the
track. In case only Pomona is
met, fifteen men will make the trip,
but should a meet be secured with
the University of Southern Cali
fornia, twenty athletes will go.
Manager Barrett is also negotiating
with the University of Nevada for
a field-day, with good prospects
of securing it. Two and possibly
three others preliminary meets will
be arranged for the Varsity track
team.
In a short time a meeting of the
track men will be held for the pur
pose of discussing the policy which
will be enforced by the track man
agement this season. Trainer
Moulton is particularly anxious to
have freshman candidates sign the
roll Monday so that he can begin
work on the new material without
delay.
