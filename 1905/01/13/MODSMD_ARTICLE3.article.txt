# Rose Out of College Athletics.
## 
### 
A report is published this morn
ing in a San Francisco paper to the
effect that Ralph Rose will no
longer be seen in college athletics.
This is due to the action of the
faculty of Michigan. Rose com
peted in New York for the Chicago
Athletic Club last December after
being refused consent by Chairman
Pattengill of the Michigan board
of control. Participation in this
meet was in violation of the east
ern intercollegiate agreement, and
as a result Rose would be subject
to protest if he was entered in any
intercollegiate event. The faculty
of Michigan did not wait for the
other colleges to act and declared
him ineligible to represent Michi
gan in any future contest. Pro
fessor Pattengill says that should
Rose leave Michigan, he could not
enter any Eastern or Western col
lege without a certificate of honor
able dismissal from it here, and this
he would have difficulty in obtain
ing.
