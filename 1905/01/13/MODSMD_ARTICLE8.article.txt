# DR. J.C. BRANNER RETURNS.
## Vice â€“ President of the University Much Benefitted by a Year's Travel in Europe. 
### 
Dr. JohnJ Casper Branner, vice
president of the University and
head of the department of Geology,
returned to-day from a year's travel
in Europe. Dr. Branner took his
leave of absence from the Univer
sity at the beginning of the spring
semester of 1904, being at that time
in poor health, and he will resume
his work at Stanford this semester
feeling much benefitted by the
year of rest. During his travels
Dr. Branner visited Italy, Switzer
land, France, Belgium, Holland,
Germany, Scotland and England,
taking in all of the most import
ant cities. He was accompanied
by his family.
Although the principal object of
the trip was to better his health,
Dr. Branner devoted considerable
time to study and reading on geo
logical subjects in some of the most
famous libraries on the continent
and of England and Scotland.
Among these were the National Li
brary of Naples, the Bibliotheque
National at Paris, the library of the
University of Edinburgh, and the
library of the British Museum at
London.
On returning to America Dr.
Branner attended the meeting in
Philadelphia of the American Geo
logical Society, of which he was
president. Concerning the geologi
cal libraries of Europe Dr. Branner
declares that while they contain
more than the libraries in the
United States they are not managed
as skillfully, and books are not as
accessible to the student. Dr. Bran
ner will occupy his former residence
on Alvarado row.
