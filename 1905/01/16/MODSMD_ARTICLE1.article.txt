# WOMEN'S BASKET-BALL.
## Earnest Practice and Training by the Squad Soon to be Begun. 
### 
The early announcement of the
initial spring practice for the
basket-ball squad shows that in
terest in this branch of women's
athletics is not waning. The fact
that the squad has secured the
services of J. F. Cahoon, '00, as
coach is responsible in a large
measure for the lively interest
which is manifested. The plans
for the season will be definitely
settled by the middle of the present
month, and systematic practice and
training will begin at once. The
manager has arranged for a num
ber of practice games with outside
teams prior to the game with Cali
fornia, which will probably be
played in the latter part of April.
The schedule shows games with
Palo Alto High School, Redwood,
San Mateo, San Jose Normal, and
possibly city teams. A series of
games will be played with San Jose
Normal. The class tournament
will form but a minor feature of
the season, owing to the difficulty
in securing teams in certain classes.
The squad, as it now stands, num
bers eighteen players, and is man
aged by Miss Jane Spalding, '06.
The Stanford team is a member
of the Coast league, the other mem
bers being Nevada, Mills, Califor
nia, and the San Jose Normal.
Miss Helen Salisbury, '05, is the
Stanford representative on the
league executive board. The board
meets annually in January to ar
range the schedule for the league
games. The game with Nevada
has been considered one of the im
portant meets of the season, but
owing to the expense and the loss
of time consumed during a trip to
Reno, the game was allowed to go
by default last season.
In the present outlook the most
formidable teams which will meet
Stanford are those from Mills Col
lege and from the State University.
The games with the team from
California will be played in a se
ries, the team winning two out of
three to be declared the winner.
As to the individual members of
the squad, little can be said at this
early date. Several of last year's
team, which tied California, are at
present on the squad, and there is
plenty of good material which can
be developed. The coaching during
this season will be directed chiefly
along two lines in order to over
come the two most noticeable
faults. The first of these is the
frequent bouncing, which is due
largely to the short-pass system
which has been in use here. The
second lies in the "basket-shooting."
The greatest effort will doubtless be
required along the second line,
since there are many points to be
worked out, but by careful, close
training these can be successfully
overcome.
