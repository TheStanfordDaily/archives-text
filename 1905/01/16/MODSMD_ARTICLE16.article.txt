It is good news that Ralph Rose
has been dropped out of college ath
letics. Men of the type of Rose may
win fieid-days, but they hurt the
spirit of amateur sport, and do their
university more harm than good.
Rose, a young Californian of great
athletic ability, was "attracted" to
Michigan in the manner that many
other fine athletes have been drawn
to that institution. He has taken
part in many track meets. He has
made world's records for Michigan.
He has been extensively written up
in newspapers and magazines as an
athletic marvel, and as the only
physically perfect man. Rose, an
uncultured country lad, grew bigger
than his college. The people of the
United States have taken notice,
and they have asked, What is this
young man in college for? A col
lege man has been compelled to ad
mit that Rose, to all appearances,
is in college for athletics only. The
action of the Michigan board of
control will tend not only to check
the growing idea that, colleges are
subservient to athletes, but it will
in a measure restore the respect of
collegians themselves for Michi
gan's athletics, which have suffered
greatly in prestige during the past
few years because of the practice of
drawing star athletes from distant
parts of the country by means
which have been questioned. Mich

igan may lose the athletic cham
pionship of the Middle West be
cause of the elimination of Rose,
but Bhe will be more honored in
defeat than in victory.
