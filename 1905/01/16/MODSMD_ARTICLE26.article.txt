# Church Singers Wanted.
## 
### 
It is greatly desired that the
present membership of the choir be
largely increased at the beginning
of this semester. The University
offers a credit for the work involved,
and the value of it to the members
is abundantly attested. On the
first Sunday in February the choir
is to give Mendelssohn's 102 Psalm
in full, with soloists, and other
work of importance is already com
menced upon. Dr. Plodgett will
be very glad to confer with any
students who wish to inquire about
it any afternoon between 3:30 and
4 o'clock at the church, or at other
times by appointment.
