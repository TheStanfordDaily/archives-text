# PREPARATIONS FOR BOATING.
## Practical Course Secured at Redwood City.â€”Prospects Good for Strong Crew. 
### 
The boating season will open to
morrow afternoon, when the first
preliminary work of the season will
begin. The men will engage in
light work on the rowing-machines
and this exercise will continue un
til Lagunita has sufficient water in
it to warrant the use of barges,
which from present indications
will be about two weeks. The
practice at Lagunita will proceed
upon much the same lines as last
year. The men will come out for
work every afternoon between 4
and 6, and observe regular train
ing rules.
Everything points to a successful
year in this department of athlet
ics. The obstacles which were met
with last year will be absent, and
all the members of last year's crew
except one man will return. The
Boat Club has purchased a four
oared shell, which is daily expected
to arrive from the East, so that
this year's intercollegiate races will
be rowed in regulation boats. Prac
tice in a shell is not practicable
upon so small a body of water as
Lagunita, so the efforts of the club
have been directed toward securing
a suitable course on the bay. Much
time and trouble were spent in try
ing to secure a location near
Cooley's landing, but while negoti
ations were still in progress a better
place was discovered at Redwood
City. The city council granted the
club the privilege of erecting a tem
porary boat-house upon the pier
which extends out into deep water
and is adjacent to a very desirable
course, over which the club has se
cured the right to practice. This
course is only half a mile from the
depot, and the trip to Redwood can
be made by train in ten minutes.
The present location, therefore, is
more desirable than one at Cooley's
landing, which could not be reached
in stormy weather.
Of last year's Varsity crew, W.
H. Dole, '05, captain; H. G. But
terfield, '05, N. C. Bryan, '06, and
R. H. Gaither, '05, coxswain, are
in college and will compete for
places again. Last year's Fresh
man crew was equal to the Varsity
in strength. All of the men are in
college and will try for the Varsity.
They are F. Zimmerman, C. E.
Bee, N. P. Bryan, G. E. Dole, and
A. Rosenfeld. There are a large
number of Freshmen who have
signified an intention of coming
out, but no idea of their ability is
known at present.
The place of Professor A. W.
Smith, who coached last season's
crews, will be filled by Professor W.
F. Durand. Professor Durand
while at Cornell was vitally inter
ested in boating, and was chairman
of the faculty committee on boat
ing. R. H. Gaither, who assisted
is last year's coaching, will con
tinue in the same capacity this year.
