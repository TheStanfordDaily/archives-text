# Track Work Begins.
## 
### 
Although training rules did not
go into effect until to-day, a num
ber of track athletes have been ap
pearing on the track every day
since college opened. Despite the
recent rains, the track can still be
used, and with a few clear days it
will be in excellent shape. Trainer
Moulton will now be on the oval
every day to advise the candidates
for the team. Rubbing commenced
to-day.
