# PRIZES FOR "QUAD" JOSHES.
## Board Offers a Premium of Five Dollars for Best Three Jokes. 
### 
The editor of the '06 Quad has
introduced a new form of compe
tition for class annuals. A prize
of $5 is offered for the best group
of three "joshes" handed in before
February 15th. The "josh" de
partments of former annuals have
never conducted such competitions,
and it is believed by the editors
that much good material can be se
cured that otherwise would not be
available. Bv reserving the right
to use any of the "joshes" sub
mitted in this competition, the edi
tors, it. is expected, will be war
ranted in assigning this depart
ment the usual amount of space.
The "joshes" submitted in this
competition may be illustrated.
Such drawings should be uniform
in size and may be either in line or
wash. The editor suggests that all
drawings handed in measure four
by nine inches. The judging of
the "joshes" will be done by the
editor.
