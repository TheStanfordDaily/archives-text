# APPEAL MADE TO TRACK MEN.
## Trainer Moulton Urges Candidates to Appear on the Oval for Work. 
### 
Trainer Moulton has issued the
following appeal to track men:
"Track work is on in earnest,
and next Monday strict training
rules will go into force. There are
plenty of rubbers on hand from 10
to 12 and 3 to 5:30, and at least
part of the track can be used every
day, rain or shine. Do not let a
little wet weather keep you away
from the track. By graduation
and other means we have lost men
who were good for 51 points, and
we must make them up. We can
do this by showing the true Stan
ford spirit, which is to come out
and work hard.
"Many of you who never partici
pated in college athletics have
plenty of time to train. You
think that you cannot do anything.
Suppose you thought of your col
lege work in the same way, where
would you land? If you were born
point-winners and champions you
would not need a trainer. Come
out; give yourself a chance and
give me a show to develop a team.
The point is that we need men in
training for next year and the year
after that. The chance of gaining
the big 'S' is well worth four years
of work, for if you fail to gain this
distinction you are still ahead in
health and experience. But there
are few who will fail to make the
Varsity if they stick to track work
for four years.
"There was never a better time
for new men to start in than now,
for there are a great many vacan
cies to be filled. Up to the present
time fifty candidates have appeared
on the track. In the weights we
have Crawford, '05, Weller, '07,
and Horton, '08, a likely trio. In
the sprints Cope, '08, Gartzman,
'08, and Wood, '07, seem to be the
most promising, but in these events
there are many surprises and dis
appointments. The three most
difficult events to fill are the high
hurdles, the 880-yard run, and the
relay. In the 440-yard dash we
have some promising material in
Davis, '08, Russell, '06, Freeman,
'06, Chalmers, '07, Edwards, '07,
Dunn, '08, El well, '07, Gay, '08,
and Pemberton, '08. In the 880-
yard run we have Bounds, '05,
Smith, '05, and Miller, '08. For
the mile run Blodget, '06, and
Thomson, '05, of last j'ear's team,
and some good freshmen, headed
by Miller, are entered. Burr, '05,
Powers, '07, and Waring, '05, of
last year's team, are back for the
two-mile run. The only entries for
the high hurdles are Thomas, '08,
and Horton, '08. In the low hur
dles MacFarland, '07, Lanagan,
'08, and Horton, '08, are entered.
In the high jump Captain Bell
seems to be alone. In the broad
jump we are fairly well fixed with
West, '06. Weller, '07, and Bell,
'05. In the pole-vault Whitaker,
'05, Bell, '05, and Kocher, '08,
ought to hold their own.
"Among the men who are yet
unplaced are Weinmann, '06, Lew
is, '08, Pier, '07, McQuaid, '08,
Redman, '07, Stork, '05, Peak, '05,
Clark, '07, Beyer, '08, Kellev, '07,

Brawley, '08, Bates, '08, Howe, '07,
Lemmon, '08, Reed, '06, Ross, '07,
and Hill, '08.
"I can coach double this number
of men, so do not be afraid to come
out and sign up. Manager Barrett
and ex-Captain Holman will assist
in the coaching."
