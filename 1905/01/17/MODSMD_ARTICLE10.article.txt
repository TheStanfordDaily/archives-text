# TO PUBLISH BOOK ON PLAY.
## First Performance of "Every Man in His Humour" Postponed Owing to Founder's Day. 
### 
The committee in charge of the
English Club play has decided to
get out a book concerning "Every
Man in His Humour," and mat
ters which may be of popular inter
est connected with it, or may lead
to a better appreciation of the play
when it is finally presented. A
similar book was produced before
the performance of "The Knight of
the Burning Pestle," and the pro
posed book will follow this in most
of its details, although a large
number of new ideas will be in
troduced.
The work of editing the book
will be in charge of Professor R.
M. Alden of the English depart
ment. Definite arrangements have
not yet been made with the pub
lishers, but if possible Elder and
Shepard of San Francisco will be
given the work. The book is to be
somewhat larger than the last one,
but will not be bound in cloth, as
the committee desires to keep down
the price as far as possible.
Among the features of the book
will be an article on the "Eliza
bethan Humours," or foibles, which
comprise to 6uch a great extent the
groundwork of the play, by Pro
fessor M. B. Anderson of the Eng
lish department; an article on Ben
Jonson, and if possible an article
by Ben Greet. There will also be a
history of the play, besides an ac
count of the numerous great actors
who have produced it.
The book will be illustrated with
pictures of the Elizabethan stage,
and with photographs from both
"The Knight of the Burning Pestle"
and "Every Wan in His Humour."
Professor Alden is endeavoring to
secure some valuable cuts from the
collection of a Harvard professor,
which would form interesting and
valuable features of the book.
Among them is a copy of the first
cast of the play in the autograph
of the players, among whom was
William Shakspere.
Owing to the undesirability of
having one of the performances of
the play come on a University
holiday, the date for the first per
formance has been changed from
Thursday, March 9th, to Wednes
day, March Bth. The date for the
second production remains un
changed, and it will take place as
scheduled, on Saturday morning,
March 11th, at 11 o'clock.
