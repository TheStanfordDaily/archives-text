The call for track candidates ap
pearing on another page ought to
appeal strongly to every man in
college who possesses two sound
legs and a little spare time. The
homely words of the trainer hardly
convey an adequate idea of the ne
cessities of the occasion. To win
the coming tield-day Stanford
must put out her greatest efforts.
The Cardinal has lost a majority
of the men who took first places
last year, and there are in college
now very few men who can be re
lied upon to break the string in the
coming struggle. Most of the sec
ond places were taken in the last
meet by California men, and these
may reasonably be expected to win
first places this year unless Stan
ford can produce something better.
We have not the reliable veterans
to fall back upon that we have had
in the past two seasons. What
ever points we make we will have
to work hard for, and the men to
win them must be developed from
among those who took subordinate
places last year or from new ma
terial. The trainer has shown that
he can work marvels in developing
point-winners, but it is important
to remember that the more mater
ial he has, the more he can do.
Some good candidates come to his
hand through the medium of the
Gymnasium, but there yet remain
many likely men who never reach

the cinder-path. Most oi them
Btay away because they have never
done that sort of work before. It
is the theory of Trainer Moulton
that the makings of a Varsity
point-winner are present in prac
tically every man, and he is will
ing and anxious to give his best ef
forts to their development. We
have won the last two field-days,
and if we make our best efforts we
may add another victory to our
credit. But it will be a hard fight,
and the first essential is plenty of
material to work upon.
