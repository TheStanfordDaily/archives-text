# BENCH AND BAR REORGANIZED
## Moot Court Will Discuss Actual Cases Being Tried by the State Judiciary. 
### 
At a regular meeting of the
Bench and Bar Moot Court held
yesterday afternoon plans were
perfected for the work of the com
ing semester. The former system
of trying questions of law on stated
facts has been abandoned, and in
lieu thereof an actual case which
has been tried by a local court and
appealed to a Superior Court is
given to Bench and Bar for re
hearsing. All the proceedings will
be followed as in a regular court,
except that the actual witnesses
will not be on hand to give their
testimony. Instead, the same testi
mony introduced at the local court
trial will be used as found in the
records of the court proceedings.
A case cannot be finished as quick
ly this way, but it is believed the
system will be more beneficial.
The case which was begun at the
last meeting was that of Sampson
vs. Hughs, which was tried in a
San Jose court a short time ago
and appealed to the Superior Court
which as yet has taken no action.
The case is for the recovery of dam
ages because of the destruction of a
mill and large timber tract by the
fierce fire which was raging a few
months ago in the region of Kings
mountain. At yesterday's Bench
and Bar meeting the demurrer to
the complaint was overruled
and the case was set for hearing on
February 2d. The meetings of the
court are open to all interested in
the work.
