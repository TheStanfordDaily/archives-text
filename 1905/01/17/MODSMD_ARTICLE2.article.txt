# RAISING LIBRARY BASE-LINE.
## Important Change Being Made on the New Building.â€”Progress on Gymnasium. 
### 
Although the work on the fir6t
floor of the new Library building
is still delayed by the non-arrival
of the iron work, the advent of a
carload of stone and bricks has
made it possible to resume work to
a small extent on the structure.
The interior walls and stone pillars
are being putin place, and gome
important work is being done on
the foundation. All along the
front of the building the earth is
being graded down so that the base
of the building will be raised two
feet. The concrete foundation thus
exposed will be covered by slabs of
stone, some six inches in thickness,
which will correspond in appear
ance with the stonework above.
This will bring the Library on a
level nearer to that of the street,
and the raising of the base-line of
the structure will do much to im
prove its general appearance.
Work on the new Gymnasium
building is progressing satisfactor
ily. The roof, with the exception
of the central portion where the
large dome will rise, has been com
pleted. Contractor McGilvray has
begun active work on the central
portion of the building and expects
to have the lintel stones in place
and the dome on very shortly. An
estimate for the interior plastering
is being made by Architect C. E.
Hodges, and contracts for interior
work will be let in the near future.
