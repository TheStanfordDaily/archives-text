# Pay for Fire Fighters.
## 
### 
The students who under the di
rection of Professor W. R. Dudley
helped fight the forest fires in the
Big Basin last fall have each re
ceived $3 for their hard work in
the mountains. The money was
given to the members of the relief
party by the Board of Trade of
Palo Alto, and was presented as a
token of appreciation of the ser
vices rendered in saving the red
wood forests of the Big Basin from
destruction by fire.
The following is a copy of the
letter which the Palo Alto Board of
Trade sent to the fire fighters:
"Please find enclosed check for
$3.00 â€”a like amount being sent to
each of the thirteen students of
Stanford University who volun
teered to assist in the fire-fighting
in the State Park on September
9th, 1904. This contribution comes
from the business men of Palo
Alto whose names are given on a
separate sheet herewith, and is
given not in any way as a compen
sation for the work done, but in
appreciation of the spirit actuating
the students in freely giving their
sorvices during a time of public
need."
