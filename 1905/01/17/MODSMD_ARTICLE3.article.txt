### 
Arrangements for the first prac
tice game of basket-ball for this
season have been made with the
San Jose Normal School's manager.
The game will be played on the
Stanford court at 3:45 o'clock Sat
urday, and will be of especial inter
est, since it will afford opportunity
for judging the new material. It
is probable that the line-up will be
changed during the game, thug
affording all the players a chance.
The team from San Jose is cap
tained by Miss Anna Laird, ex- ? 06.
Owing to a severe injury to her
ankle during fall practice, Miss
Helen Salisbury, '05, has been
compelled to withdraw from future
playing, and has tendered her res
ignation as captain of the squad.
The loss of Miss Salisbury will be
keenly felt, as she has played in
the intercollegiate games of the past
two seasons, and her experience,
coupled with her ability as captain,
has made her an important factor
in this branch of women's athletics.
