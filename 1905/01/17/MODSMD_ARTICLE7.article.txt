# Junior Class Meeting.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Junior
class to be held in the chapel to
morrow, besides the nomination of
officers for the semester, the ques
tion of voting sweaters to the
Juniors who won the interclass
tennis series will be brought up.
The Athletic Committee sanctioned
the giving of class sweaters to the
players who took part in the inter
class tournament, and it now rests
with the class whether the sweaters
shall be voted.
