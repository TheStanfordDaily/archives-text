# Hospital Building Completed.
## 
### 
The large new building adjoining
the Students' Guild Hospital in
Palo Alto, which was in the course
of (construction during the recent
diphtheria epidemic, is finally com
pleted and practically furnished.
The new building contains three
wards, each accommodating four
beds; five single rooms, two double
rooms, and four diet kitchens. It
is constructed in four sections, so
that each one may readily be com
pletely isolated. This portion of
the hospital faces on Cowper street,
and is connected with the main
part by a covered passageway. In
accordance with the town ordi
nance, new cement walks have been
laid around the grounds.
There are but five patients in the
hospital at present, the majority of
whom are suffering from bronchitis
and colds. Miss Laura Hauver
raan, '07, who has been suffering
from acute pleurisy, will be taken
to her home in Southern California
as soon as she is able to be out.
