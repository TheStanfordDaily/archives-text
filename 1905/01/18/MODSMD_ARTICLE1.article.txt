# BOATING PRACTICE BEGINS.
## Twenty-five Men Turn Out for Preliminary Work in the Gymnasium. 
### 
The initial boating practice took
place yesterday afternoon in the
Gymnasium. Only about twenty
live men signed for work, but in
side of the next few days the total
is expected to reach close to fifty.
It is desired that all who intend to
report for work do so at once in or
der that they may receive all the
preliminary instruction. The
work for the next two weeks will
consist of practice on the Gym
nasium rowing-machines, which
have been removed from their
former position and fitted up es
pecially for the use of the boating
candidates. The work Tuesday was
light, each man rowing but ten
minutes, but it will increase daily.
The elementary work now in prog
ress is valuable to some of the new
men who have had little or no ex
perience in rowing, for the nature
of the stroke on the machines can
be made exactly the same as in
practice with the barges. At the
end of two weeks it is expected that
Lagunita will be sufficiently well
filled to warrant the transfer of
work to the boats.
The list of men who come out
includes many of the old men and
about a dozen who begin for the
first time. The old men who signed
up are as follows:
W. H. Dole, '05, J. P. O'Neal,'os,
E. V. Henley, '06, B. Bryan, '06,
