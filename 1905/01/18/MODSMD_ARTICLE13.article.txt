The earnestness with which the
Sophomores are working for their
production of "The Rivals" is re
freshing. One of the reasons why
Stanford theatricals are so often
crude is the lack of interest and
sincerity on the part of the actors.
Parts are accepted very often with
reluctance, and as little as possible
of the drudgery of rehearsal is done.
A sacrifice of personal convenience
is too seldom made, with the result
that many of the actors come to
rehearsals late or not at all. It is
a rare and notable occasion when
a full cast can be brought together
at the time appointed. In this re
spect the Sophomores are setting an
example that compels admiration.
It iB evident that they intend to
have their class production as per
fect as hard and conscientious
work can make it. Those who won
their places after a contest have
been rehearsing with the greatest
fidelity for weeks. Most of them
were here three or four days before
college reopened, some cutting short
visits to their homes in distant
parts of the State. This is a spirit
that merits the greatest success,
and the indications are that the
Class of '07 will get what it de
serves. When all our theatricals
are taken up with the same degree
of enthusiasm shown by these
Sophomore actors, the quality of
our stage productions will be ma
terially improved.
