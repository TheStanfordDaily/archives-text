# Italian Band Concert.
## 
### 
On Monday evening, February
6th, Creatore's Italian Band will
give a concert in Assembly Hall
under the auspices of the Faculty
Committee on Musical Matters.
This band is under the leadership
of Signor Creatore, who was con
ductor at the first Italian band
concert given here three years ago.
Shortly after that concert Creatore
left the Royal Italian Band and or
ganized a band of his own, which
is the one that has been engaged
for the coming concert.
Beside this concert, the com
mittee is now arranging for other
musical attractions, which will be
announced as soon as more definite
arrangements are made.
