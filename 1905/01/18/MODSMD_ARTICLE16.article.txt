# Professors Buy Land for Homes.
## 
### 
Six members of the University
faculty, Professors Allardice,Camp
bell, Dodge, Dudley, Kellogg, and
Rolfe, have bought land during the
last eight months in the so-called
Bellevue tract, about a mile west of
the Campbell cottage in University
Heights, near Menlo Park. Their
object is to make their homes there
within a year or two. They have
taken this step because they enjoy
the wide view and the quiet of this
high region. The land upon which
the professors intend to build is
about 350 feet above the valley
floor and commands a beautiful
view.
