# BRANNER AND M'LEAN SPEAK
## Faculty Members Deliver Addressed Before a Large University Assembly. 
### 
The second University Assembly
of the semester was held at 11:15
this morning. Vice-President Bran
ner, who has recently returned
from a year's leave of absence in
Europe, and Professor S. J. Mc-
Lean of the Economics department
were the speakers of the occasion.
Dr. McLean, the first speaker,
gave a description of the recent
meeting of the American Economic
Association andthePolitical Science
Association, which he attended at
Chicago. He spoke in part as fol
lows: "For some years there have
been meetings of the associations
of History and Economics, but the
American Association of Political
Science is a new organization which
met for the first time this year.
A striking feature of this convention
was the lively interest displayed by
economists in concrete subjects.
It has been said that the science of
political economy is too speculative
and theoretical. This may have
been true in the past, but condi
tions of to-day do not justify the
charge, and the program of the
convention showed this very well."
Dr. Branner spoke very enter
tainingly of his recent travels in
Europe. The fact that he made
the same trip thirty years ago gave
the speaker an excellent opportun
ity to observe the immense im
provements which have been made
in facilities for travel during that
period. Dr. Branner further said:
"The attitude of Europeans to
ward Americans has changed
greatly within a recent period. To
a great extent this has been caused
by the prestige gained by the
United States as a result of the
Spanish-American war. Another
cause for this change is a notable
improvement in our business
morals. Formerly it was the
American custom to take orders in
Europe and fill them with inferior
goods. Now it has become the
custom to give the very best for the
money, and this has resulted in
an increase of esteem for Ameri
can merchants and business meth
ods.
"It is true that European geolo
gists are behind Americans, except
in certain special lines. Even the
best which the Germans have de
veloped can now be obtained by
the student in America."
Although Dr. Branner did not go
to Europe to study, he spent con
siderable time in European libra
ries. The facilities for the distri
bution of books in these libraries
are not equal to those of the United
States, and of all the libraries vis
ited only two had the card system
of cataloging.
