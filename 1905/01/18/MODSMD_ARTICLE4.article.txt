# FORTY-ONE PLAYERS OUT.
## Unusually Large Number of Baseball Men Report for First Day's Practice. 
### 
The first baseball practice for the
season took place yesterday after
noon, a squad of forty-one men re
porting to Coach Cowden. This
number was almost equally divided
between the infield and the outfield,
twenty-one trying for the former
positions and twenty for the latter.
Of the total number of men that
turned out,but seventeen were Fres
hmen, the majority of the other men
being members of their class teams
of last year.
The men were first tried on easy
infield work by the coach, and

were then divided into two squads
—those trying for the outfield and
those trying for the infield posi
tions. Coach Cowden batted to the
outfield, while Captain Trowbridge
took charge of the infield. The
entire squad was next given batting
practice, Sales and Chalmers pitch
ing to the men. The condition of
the field rendered the handling of
the ball very difficult, as the ground
was too soft to give the players a
sure footing. The diamond, es
pecially between first and second
base, is in a bad condition owing
to the fact that the field was
scraped before it was dry. This
roughness will be remedied by
scraping it again when the field is
thoroughly dry.
The four Varsity baseball men
at present in college—Trowbridge,
Sales, Chalmers, and Colbert —were
out for practice yesterday, but it
was noticed that a number of good
baseball men were not in the
squad. Among these is Stott, who
will probably be unable to play
during the early part of the season
because of a football injury.
Coach Cowden will have the men
out every day, and it is probable
that games between the second and
first teams will be played in about
a week. As the first game of the
season with Santa Clara takes
place on Saturday, January 28th,

the team must take some definite
shape during the next week.
