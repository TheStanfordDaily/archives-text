# PUNTING CUP AWARDED.
## W.H. Dole Secures the Prize Given by the Quadrangle Club for Best Kicking. 
### 
The punting cup donated by the
Quadrangle Club has been awarded
to \V. H. Dole, '05, by a judging
committee consisting of Captain
Clark and Coach Lanagan. The
cup, which is a handsome solid sil
ver loving cup, was put up by the
Quadrangle Club last year to be
annually awarded to the Varsity
football player who did the best
and most consistent punting
throughout the season. The pur
pose that the club members had in
mind was to encourage and develop
that part of the football game in
which Stanford has always been
more or less weak. Owing to some
confusion in keeping the records,
the cup was not awarded at the end
of the 1903 season. But from now
on the cup will be given to the
football player whose work in
punting is judged to be the best by
the coach and captain of the team.
The winner of the cup will have
his name engraved on it and be al
lowed to keep the prize in his pos
session until it is awarded to some
one else. In judging the award,
accuracy, distance and height in
the punting will be considered.
\V. H. Dole, who receives the cup
this year, has played three years
on the Varsity football team as
half-back and was one year on the
Varsity track team. His punting
last season was so far superior to
that of any other member of the
team that the work of selecting the
best punter was a mere form. Dole
is also a member of the Varsity
rowing crew, was president of his
class last year, and belongs to the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity. A
formal presentation of the cup will
probably be made later in the se
mester.
