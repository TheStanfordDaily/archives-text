# INTER-DEPARTMENT MEET.
## First Field-Day a Week from Saturday.â€”Training Rules in Force Monday. 
### 
The first track meet of the semes
ter will be held Saturday morning,
January 28th. The field-day will
be an inter-department meet, and
all the track athletes in training
will be expected to enter it. As
none of the track men will be in
good physical form at such an
early date, the distance runs will
be materially shortened. With
this end in view, the two-mile run
will be cut down to six laps, and
the mile run will be shortened to
three laps. All of the other runs
will be for the full distance. Be
ginning with this meet, it is
planned to hold field-days every
Saturday until the intercollegiate
contest in April. When a meet
cannot be secured with an outside
team, handicap and interclass
field-days will be held.
Strict training rules will go into
force Monday. After March Ist
the number of dances which track
aspirants may attend will be lim
ited. This limit has not yet been
determined upon by the trainer
and captain, but, following the cus
tom of previous years, it will prob
ably be placed at two. Training
rules are beginning a little earlier
than usual this year, but a heavy
schedule and the necessity for de
veloping new material renders this
step advisable.
