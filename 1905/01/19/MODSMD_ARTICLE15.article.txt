" To the Public :
"We are still in the business of fur
nishing outlines and material for all
kinds of literary productions. We also

Such is the text printed upon
postal cards received during the
past few days by a large number of
the members of the University â€”by
so many that it is evident a direc
tory or register of the University
has come into the hands of the firm
which sends out the circular. As a
part of the address,apparently with
out any appreciation of the humor,
is written the word "student." The
thing is so ingeniously worded that
it is impossible to pin it down to a
particular meaning. But when it
is specifically addressed to a univer
sity student it can fairly be inter
preted in one way only: it means
that for a consideration the student
may secure the material for his
themes or his theses; and, for a fur
ther consideration, may even have
these written for him, so that the
extent of his own work will be the
copying and signature of the stuff.
This trade is said to flourish at a
few of the Eastern universities,along
with the allied custom of profes
sional dealing in class notes. An
effort has been made to beat down
the practice, but it has not suc
ceeded entirely, for while the firms
advertise openly, they seem to con
duct their operations with such cau
tion that detection of their patrons
is difficult. So far as we know, this
state of rottenness has never ex
tended to this University. There
have been cases now and then of
attempts to sell notes, but with dis
astrous results. The gentlemen who
run"the business of furnishing out
lines and materials for all kinds of
literary productions" have never
found this a profitable field. The
practices have properly been re
garded as vicious and illegitimate,
and it is pretty safe to say that the
dealers in literary productions will
find few customers here.
