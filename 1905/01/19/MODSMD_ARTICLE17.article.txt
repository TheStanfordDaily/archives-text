# INTERPRETATION OF MUSIC.
## Series of Lectures Being Given by Dr. Blodgett at Home of Dr. Flugel. 
### 
Nothing is clearer than that, for
the most of us, music, if it is a
language, as its devotees most
strenuously claim, is an unknown
tongue. This is particularly evi
dent in regard to instrumental
music, for vocal music is able, more
or less clearly, to interpret itself
through the words that are used;
but it is a fact of commonest ex
perience that, even here, it is the
music rather than the words that
gain the attention, and the latter
gain access to the thought in pro
portion as the former is effective
and inspiring. The prevalence of
the greatest operatic representa
tions in foreign text is abundant
illustration of this fact. Not only
are such representations unhin
dered in their effectiveness and
popularity by the words that are
not understood, but the substitu
tion of the vernacular for them
would inevitably work such hin
dering most disastrously, for the
musical and the unmusical alike.
Thi√ü fact has been demonstrated
over and over again, so that opera
in the vernacular is universally
recognized as belonging to a second
class order of presentation. It is
only when music is invoked to em
phasize or impress the highest pos
sible thought, as patriotism or re
ligion, that some are willing to
forego somewhat of its purely spir
itual impressiveness in favor of
the definite intellectual conception,
which is pre-eminently desired.
But, even here, it may be ques
tioned whether, to any given thou
sand human beings, the world over,
the patriotic sentiment and pur
pose would be the more strongly
inspired by the "Marseillaise,"
eagerly sung, or the Eroica Sym
phony of Beethoven, competently
played; whether the religious
thought and emotion would be the
more deeply stirred by Handel's
"I Know that My Redeemer Liv
eth," or the same composer's glor
ious Largo.
It being true, however, that in
strumental music (which is music
at its best) is relatively unintelli
gible to the majority of us because
of lack of training and experience
as to its inner meaning, any
worthy effort to interpret it for us,
explain its dialect, make clear its
field of revelation, and implete its
phrases with the spiritual and in
tellectual life of its author, pre
sents to us a culture of very high
order. This is precisely what the
afternoon organ recitals in Me
morial Church mean, what Dr.
Blodgett is earnestly striving to

make them furnish, and what a
constantly increasing company of
those connected with the Univer
sity, as professors or students, is
coming to recognize in them.
This is also what is meant by
the series of ten weekly lecture re
citals upon Beethoven, which Dr.
Fliigel has invited Dr. Blodgett to
give at his house, and which is to
commence Friday evening, Febru
ary 3d. The entire series of Bee
thoven's great sonatas will be pre
sented in these recitals, so three
matinees will be added for the per
formances with other artists of six
or more of the greatest chamber
compositions of the master. It
would be of inestimable value if
such a ministry could be furnished
as a course of study in Assembly
Hall, where large companies of stu
dents could avail themselves of it,
but it is manifestly impossible for
all who would be glad of it to be
accommodated in a private house,
even though it be as spacious as
Dr. Fliigel's; hence the necessity
for inviting the guests.
