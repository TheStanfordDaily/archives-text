# LECTURE BY DR. ABBOTT.
## "Legal Bibliography" the Subject Discussed by Head of the Law Department. 
### 
Dr. Nathan Abbott of the Law
department yesterday delivered the
third of a series of lectures which
was begun last semester, - and
which is to be continued during
this semester. In the first lecture
he discussed "Plowden's Reports,"
in the second spoke about "Coke's
Library." The lecture yesterday
was on "Legal Bibliography," and
contained many interesting facts
regarding the first law libraries.
Although theße lectures are pri
marily for law students, they are
of such general interest as to at
tract students from other depart
ments.
"The first reports," said Dr. Ab
bott, "were kept in the old mon
asteries to protect life and prop
erty, and only recently have they
been kept for precedent. The
judges at firßt cited authority to
show learning, but when the great
controversy arose between the
crown and Parliament both sides
searched diligently for authority,
and then authority came to be
used as precedent.
"The first reporters were merely
note-takers in the court, and what
ever of their notes were found to be
reliable were stamped as authority.
Most of these reports were not
trustworthy, for two reasons: first,
because they were written in Latin
and French, and in legal abbrevi
ations; and secondly, because they
were not contemporaneous. But
from the 'dark' volumes some
translations were made which were
adopted as authority.
"Coke had but thirty volumes in
his library. In 1776 there were
only 150 reports, and most of these
were brought to America, but they
are worthless, except for prehistori
cal purposes. Before 1600 there
had only been year-books. In 1600
Coke, Plowden, and Dyer made re
ports. From 1600 to 1700 the re
ports were of no value; from 1700
to 1785 they were of somewhat
greater value. In 1785 the com
mercial system began. This sys
tem had its merits and its defects.
Its defects are, first, inaccuracy of
reports, and secondly, cases whose
decisions the reporters deemed bad
law were often thrown out. Thiß
system ended in 1865."
