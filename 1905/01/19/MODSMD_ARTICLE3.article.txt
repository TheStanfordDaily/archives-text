# Y.W.C.A. to Entertain Freshmen.
## 
### 
The social committee of the
Young Women's Christian Associa
tion has been busy for the past
week planning a suitable reception
fQr the Christmas Freshmen. Of
the sixty-two entrants this term
nineteen are women, and it is for
these that the Christian Association
has been arranging. The custom
in the past has been to tender an
afternoon reception to the new
comers, but the announcement of
the basket-ball game with the Nor
mal team next Saturday necessita
ted a change in the plans. It has
been decided to take the Freshmen
to witness the game, each guest to
be accompanied by a member from
the upper classes, and in every way
provided for during the afternoon.
Every effort will be put forth to
make the incoming women feel
welcome to Stanford and to the
association.
