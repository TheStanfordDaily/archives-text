# BASEBALL AT CALIFORNIA.
## Ten Veterans of Former Intercollegiate Games Trying for the Varsity. 
### 
California will start the present
baseball season with ten veterans
of former intercollegiate games, and
very bright prospects for this year.
Among the names of these ten men
is that of Bliss, who it was reported
had been dropped from college, but
whom the Daily Californian speaks
of as again being a candidate for
the team.
The veterans upon whom Cali
fornia will rely to win the intercol
legiate series this year are Bliss,
Heitmuller, Strub, Graham, Gil lis,
Gunn, Causley, Hunter, Sweesy and
Woolsen. Of these men Strub,
pitcher and third base; Graham,
first base; Gillis. second base;
Gunn, third base; Sweesy, center
field, and Woolsen, right field, made
the team last year as freshmen.
Bliss has played two seasons as
second base and catcher, and Heit
muller has played three years in
the outfield and as pitcher. Causley
played third base on the '03 var
sity, and Hunter was a member of
the '01 team.
The coach at California will have
a veteran player in every position.
The only man of last season's nine
who is not back in college is Adams,
captain and short-stop last year.
As two former varsity players are
trying for this position, the pros
pects for a winning team at Cali
fornia are brighter than they have
been for a number of years.
California has not yet chosen a
coach. At last accounts Frank
Chance, the Californian who has
been playing in the Eastern League
for some seasons, was under con
sideration.
