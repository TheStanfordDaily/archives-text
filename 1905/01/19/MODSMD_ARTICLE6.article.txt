The Daily Californian publishes
to-day an editorial opposing the
present system of graduate coach
ing. The editorial says in part:
"The graduate coach system is
doing more injury to Pacific Coast
football than any other single in
fluence. Cochrane, who came West
in 1897 and 1898, has left the most
lasting impression here. The men
who learned the game under him
are those on whom we must draw
for coaches, and they can do little
more than teach football as played
in 1897 at Princeton. Similar
mathematical arguments apply to
Stanford's coaches. That is to say
that the two largest universities in
the West are ten years behind mod
ern Eastern athletics. It is this
fact that has rated our teams with
second-rate Southern colleges.
"As long as this condition exists
Western athletics will suffer the
1088 of Western athletes who prefer
to attend Eastern universities. Only
once in a while can either Califor
nia or Stanford hope to find an
alumnus who knows the Eastern
game, and who is in a position to
devote four months to coaching a
team. Unless the present intercol
legiate agreement is changed, and
the best available coaches are se
cured, whether graduate or Eastern,
California elevens must go on play
ing the game that Garry Cochrane
played at Princeton in 1897."
