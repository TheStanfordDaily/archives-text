# ACTIVITY IN DEBATING
## Working for the Important Contests to Be Held in Next Few Weeks. 
### 
The debaters at present seem to
be holding the center of the stage.
With the Carnot finals but two
days off, the annual Freshman-
Sophomore debate to be held next
week, and the preliminary arrange
ments for the selection of the In
tercollegiate team now being made,
interest in debating is much
aroused.
The Carnot team will be selected
Saturday night, and the contest for
places promises to be a clo√üe one.
But the importance of this event
lies not so much in the actual se
lection of the team itself as in the
fact that the second Friday follow
ing the Carnot debate itself will be
held in Assembly Hall. Stanford's
chances for winning the medal this
year are bright because of the
strong material available here and
the apparent weakness of Califor
nia's team, which has already been
selected.
The next event of interest will be
the debate between teams repre
senting the Freshman and Sopho
more classes. This contest prom
ises to be of unusual interest this
year. A live question will be dis
cussed and both teams were chosen
under unusually keen competition.
The Intercollegiate debate prob
ably means more to Stanford this
year than any other debate,because
if her team is victorious the Hearst
cup comes here for a permanent
stay. Even if California should
win this time, a victory in either
of the following two years will se
cure permanent possession of the
trophy for Stanford.
Another debate of interest which
will be held this semester is the
contest between a second team and
a team from the University of Ne
vada.
