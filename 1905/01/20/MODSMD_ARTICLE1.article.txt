# CARNOT FINALS TO-MORROW.
## Seven Candidates from Whom Team to Meet California Will be Chosen. 
### 
The final try-outs for the selec
tion of the team to represent Stan
ford in the annual contest for the
Carnot Medal will be held in the
chapel to-morrow night at 8. Seven
men will speak, and of these three
will be chosen to debate against
California. The following will enter
the try-out: P. D. Swing, '05, W.
L. Blair, '05, A. Sherriffs, '05, R. G.
Barnett, '05, E. A. Cunha, '06, D.
D. Sales, '06, and J. L. Maloy. Dr.
C. A. Duniway of the Hißtory de
partment, Dr. R. M. Alden of the
English department, and Rev. D.
C. Gardner, chaplain of Memorial
Church, will act as judges. They
have served before in similar con
tests.
The general subject which the
candidates have been studying on
is the "Relation of Church and
State in France since 1801." At 6
o'clock to-morrow evening a specific
topic worded in the form of a reso
lution will be announced by a com
mittee consisting of H. M. Lewis,
'04, O. C. Spencer, '04, and F. ltoehr,
'04. Each debater will select the
side of the question which he wishes
to defend, and lots will be drawn to
determine the order of speaking.
Each man will be allowed fifteen
minutes in which to deliver two
speeches. The only qualification is
that no speech shall be less than
four minutes' duration.
All of the candidates are experi
enced in debating, most of them
having represented their classes,
and one having been on a Carnot
and Intercollegiate team. Although
the number of men competing is
smaller than usual, this should in
no way weaken Stanford's chances
for securing the medal. All things
considered, her chances are much
brighter this year than they have
been for several years past. All
the candidates for the team have
putin a month of study on the
question and have secured a thor
ough mastery of it. No more study
in preparation for the actual de
bate will be necessary, but all the
time left will be spent in arrang
ing ideas and perfecting some sys
tem of team work. Stanford's team
will be a thoroughly tried and ex
perienced one, while none of Cali
fornia's men, who have already
been selected, has participated in a
varsity debate before.
Unusual interest is being taken
in this try-out because the big de
bate will be held here this year,
taking place in Assembly Hall Fri
day night, February 3d. A Stan
ford man has not won the medal
since F. B. Wagner brought it back
from California in 1902.
