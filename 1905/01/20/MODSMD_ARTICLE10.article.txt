Sunday will mark the second
anniversary of the dedication of
Memorial Church, erected by a
noble woman in memory of her
husband. In view of this fact it is
of interest to note the growth of
that institution both materially
and spiritually. The past two
years have developed the church as
a distinct part of college life at
Stanford, and as such it has proved
a success. Regarded from the out
side world as somewhat of an
anomaly, it has been accepted here
as something not foreign to but
above the ordinary pursuits of col
lege life. Men of all creeds and
beliefs meet there on the high
plane of common spiritual devo
tion. The attendance at Memorial
Church is growing, and there is
every indication that it will con
tinue to do so. This is remarkable
when it is considered that the con
stituency of the church must of
necessity lack cohesion, it is an
institution without a history, with
out traditions, and lacking a com
mon creed. Yet liberal Unitarian
and earnest Evangelical meet there
without friction, with profit to
both. Memorial Church has come
to occupy such a natural place in
the life of the average student that
it has ceased to cause any remark.
This fact has led to the charge that
the students are in the main indif
ferent to the church, but this accu
sation cannot be justified. As a
memorial to one of the founders of
the University it is deeply revered,
and unconsciously the very pres
ence of the beautiful edifice has its
effect on the lives of the students
who pass their days of work and
pleasure within hearing of its;
chimes.
