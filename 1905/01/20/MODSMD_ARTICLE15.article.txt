# Tickets for "The Rivals."
## 
### 
The tickets for the Sophomore
comedy, "The Rivals," will be put
on sale on the quad Monday morn
ing at 9:30. The right half of the
main floor has been reserved for
the Palo Alto residents and will go
on sale at the same time in Palo
Alto at the Stanford Pharmacy.
The prices will be 50 cents, 75
cents and $1.
This year the number of compli
mentary seats has been materially
decreased by the committee in
charge, following upon a precedent
which was established early last
semester. This action was taken
in behalf of the interests of the
Sophomore class, an the comedy is
being produced for financial re
turns as well as for the sake of the
dramatic welfare of the class. Ow
ing to the fact that no compli
mentary tickets have been given to
the members of the cast, they will
be given the first choice of seats
when the tickets are put on sale
Monday morning.
