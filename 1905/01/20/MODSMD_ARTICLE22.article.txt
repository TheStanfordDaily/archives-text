# Mathematicians Organize.
## 
### 
A mathematical section of the
California Teachers' Association
was organized recently at San
Jose. Professor G. A. Miller of
Stanford University was elected
president, and J. F. Smith, Camp
bell High School, secretary. The
main object of the association is to
arouse more interest in mathemati
cal pedagogy by means of separate
meetings for the discussion of re
cent mathematical movements.
