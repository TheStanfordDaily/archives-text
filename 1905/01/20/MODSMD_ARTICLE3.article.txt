# CHANGES IN AGREEMENT.
## Intercollegiate Committee Receives Important Suggestions from the Athletic Committee. 
### 
The Athletic Committee met last
night for the purpose of instructing
the Stanford members of the Inter
collegiate Athletic Committee,
which meets in San Francisco Jan
uary 28th. Two members of the
latter committee, C. M. Fickert,'9B,
and R. W. Barrett, '04, were pres
ent at the meeting.
The Intercollegiate Committee
was instructed to stand firm for the
graduate coaching system in foot
ball, and to propose the adoption
of the same plan for baseball. The
Stanford members of the committee
are strongly in favor of the system
in use at present, and any attempt
to revert to professional coaching
will be strenuously opposed by
them.
The California members of the
committee will probably propose
that an intercollegiate freshman
track meet be held in the future.
Track men here strongly favor the
idea, and the Stanford members
were instructed to act favorably on
the matter.
The recently adopted agreement
for a baseball game between the
first-year classes of the two univer
sities may be rescinded, as it is
understood that California does not
fa vor the project. No definite in
structions were given to the Stan
ford members of the committee in
regard to it.
Another important recommenda
tion to be proposed as a result of
the meeting last night i6 the recog
nition of boating as a branch of
intercollegiate athletics. As this
project has long been favored by
California, its final adoption at the
coining meeting of the Intercollegi
ate Committee is practically as
sured.
The recommendations recently
adopted at a joint meeting of the
faculty athletic committees of Stan
ford and California were discussed
at length. The plan for prohibit
ing the participaticAi of freshmen
in intercollegiate athletic contests
was not favored by the Athletic
Committee, nor did the proposal to
hold the freshman football game in
the spring semester meet with
favor. The recommendation pro
posing that in case of a tie game in
any athletic contest the trophy
should go to the college wfiich had
won the previous year was accepted.
Several minor alterations were
proposed in the athletic agreement
which governs the athletic relations
of the two universities. Article I,
section 4, which provides that stu
dents of other institutions shall
not participate in intercollegiate
contests between California and
Stanford, was recommended to be
struck out as superfluous. Article
11, section 9, which provides that
ho student from another university
of standing shall be eligible for a
Freshman team, was also recom
mended to be struck out because
covered elsewhere in the agreement.
An amendment to section 4 of
article 111, providing that disputes
of any kind shall not be carried be
yond the faculty athletic commit
tees was recommended. It was

further recommended that article
IV, section 6, which provides for
expenses of visiting teams, be re
moved from the agreement in order
that this matter may be left to the
respective business managers of the
two colleges. Other recommenda
tions for the correction of merely
technical errors or the removal of
superfluities in the agreement were
made bv the committee.
