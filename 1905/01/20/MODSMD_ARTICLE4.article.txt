# TENNIS CLUB MEETS.
## Officers Elected and Plans for Holding Tournaments This Semester Discussed. 
### 
The Tennis Club held its first
regular meeting of the semester
last night. Several matters of im
portance were discussed, and an
election of officers to serve for the
ensuing semester was held. A. W.
Hooper, '05, was unanimously
re-elected president; A. Ames, '06,
was elected vice-president, and J.
F. Cassell, '07, was again chosen
Becretary-treasurer. G. A. Hodge,
'06, and C. L. Lewis, '07, were
elected to serve in conjunction with
the three officers of the club as an
executive committee. This com
mittee will also have charge of the
tournaments.
O. P. Morton, '95, informed
President Hooper that the cup pre
sented by F. C. Thiele of Palo Alto
and won by L. R. Gay, '08, in the
Thanksgiving tournament, had
been suitably engraved and was
now in the hands of Professor Fair
clough of the Faculty Tennis Club,
who will turn it over to Gay. The
winner of this cup is entitled to
hold the trophy until the next
Thanksgiving tournament. Should
he leave college, or in case no tour
nament is held, then the trophy is
to be turned over to the Faculty
Tennis Club, which is the only
permanent organization on the
campus.
In regard to the holding of tour
naments this semester there was
much discussion. At present the
condition of the courts is such that
tournament play is hardly pos
sible. It waß suggested that Man
ager Barrett be requested to make
some arrangements for getting the
courts into better condition. The
plan which was decided upon in
regard to holding a tournament
was that in about a week a singles
tournament be held. This is for
the purpose of picking the ten best
singles players. Then these ten
men are to have special privileges
on one of the courts, and.any man
outside of the may challenge
the tenth man to obtain the privi
leges on the court. About a month
before the date set for the intercol
legiate match a try-out in singles
and doubles will be held which
will be open to all. The principal
purpose is to have a tournament
for the purpose of exciting interest
in tennis and of giving the men
practice in match games. One of
the mistakes made in past years
has been that the try-outs for the
intercollegiate team have been held
too late in the season, and as a re
sult the men who played doubles
have had no time to practice to
gether. This fault •will be avoided
if the present plans are carried out
for this season.
