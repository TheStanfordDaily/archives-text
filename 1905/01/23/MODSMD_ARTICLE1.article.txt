# CHESS TOURNAMENT STARTS.
## Fifteen Men Entered in the Try-out for the Intercollegiate Team. 
### 
At a meeting of the Chess Club
held Saturday afternoon definite
arrangements were made for the
playing of the spring try-out, and
score-cards were given out to the
fifteen who will try for places on
this year's Varsity chess team.
The following men are eligible to
participate in the tournament,
either from having held positions
on former Varsity teams or from
having made the club in last se
mester's tournament: R. A. Fuller,
'05, F. P. Whitaker, '05, N. C.
Powers, '05, E. W. Doane, '05, M.
M. Stearns, '06, H. W. Strong, '06,
G. E. Dole, '07, H. It. Thomas, '07,
J. F. Cassell, '07, A. It. Mac Swain,
'08, L. Newland, '08, C. I. Chand
ler, '08, C. E. Spaulding, T. It.
Figg-Hoblyn, '08, and lt.S. Woods,
'08.
From these fifteen players Beven
men will be chosen to play in the
match with California, and an ad
ditional man to act as alternate.
The rules of the tournament re
quire that each man play two
games with all of the others, and at
the close of the tournament the
players having the highest percent
age of games won will be chosen.
The date set for the closing of the
tournament is April 2d, when the
score-cards must all be returned to
the officers of the club.
The prospect of a strong team
being developed by next April
seems very bright owing to the
presence of five members of former
teams. The unexpected return of
H. \V. Strong, '06, practically as
sures Stanford of an additional
point in the match, as in the two
previous matches? in which he
played Strong easily outclassed the
strongest of the California players.
