The Sophomore class is again
to be congratulated. The policy
adopted by its play committee of
cutting down the number of com
plimentary tickets is a big step in
the right direction, and a move
that can be adopted with profit by
many class enterprises. The mem
bers of the cast have agreed to
forego the tickets usually given
them for distribution among their
friends, and each member of the
committee will pay for his own
tickets. Complimentaries will be
given only to two or three persons
whose connection with the Univer
sity demands the courtesy, and to a
limited number of press representa
tives whose services save paid ad
vertisements. It will be a great
thing for Stanford when one of
these days we have all class offi
cers, committees, and actors work
ing like this for the honor of serv
ing their classes alone, and when
every man and woman in the Uni
versity pays his or her own way to
every class production. At Yale
even the football coaches buy their
tickets to the big game. The Soph
omore play committee has taken
the first important step toward tbiß
reform, and if their classmates
stand by them and make the ex
periment a success, they will have
set a standard that the upper
classes may well aspire to.
In the case of the upper-class
dances the complimentary ticket
system has developed to an amaz
ing extent. There is something
radically wrong when it is possible
for over one-third of those who
attend some class dances to do so
by grace of complimentary tickets.
When Junior and Senior presidents
appoint working ball committees of
four or five members, who will not
hesitate to deny the claims of
chairmen of committees which have

little to do; of a long list of class
officers who are ornamental but,
with two or three exceptions, not
very useful; of farce actors whose
success should he their reward; of
college editors who if they ad
vertise the show at all do no more
than their duty; of the dozen and
one who think they have claims
for other reasons, —when we get
this drain ruthlessly cut off, it is
probable that stories of dance defi
cits will not have to be told.
More tickets will be sold, and
the greater receipts will probably
enable the classes to give their
dances at a cost which will permit
a larger number of students to at
tend them. It is unquestionable
that at present the price keeps
away many who are entitled to go
and who would be very glad to do
so were it not for the prohibitive
expense. It is somewhat of a farce
to have a Junior Prom or a Senior
Ball from which a majority of the
Juniors or the Seniors must 6tay
away. The pass system would
seem to be one of the great
the evil. It can be dug out, and
then, if it still be found necessary
to charge five and six dollars for a
ball ticket, it will be very much to
the credit of the class which first
gives a dance that is simpler and
less costly, but more representa
tive.
