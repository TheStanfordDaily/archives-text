# ANNIVERSARY SERMON.
## Rev. D.C. Gardner Reviews Work of Memorial Church During Two Years. 
### 
Sunday marking the second anni
versary of the dedication of Memo
rial Church, the services were of a
commemorative character. In the
morning Rev. D. Charles Gardner
delivered an anniversary sermon
in which he outlined the work ac
complished by the church during
the two years of its existence and
spoke of the bright prospects for
the future. After reviewing briefly i
the sermons which he delivered on i
the dedication of the church audi
upon its first anniversary, Mr. Gard-!
ner said in part:
"Upon this occasion last year I
suggested that the church had
grown into the life of the Univer
sity by the exercise of two func
tions: worship and instruction.
First let me observe that there has
been a growing appreciation dur
ing the past year of the service of
public worship. The success of the
work of this church in the matter
of attendance rests not upon any
committee, but upon you. In the
matter of attendance 1 am very
hopeful. During the past semester
there have been larger congrega
tions than since the day of dedica
tion. 1 observe, too, a deeper de
votional attitude. I say frankly I
could not wish for more reverent
congregations.
"Eminent men in the churches
believe that this church, being
non-sectarian, is doomed to failure.
They believe that the strength of a
church lies in its system of doc
trine. But this church is here to
minister to the spiritual needs of
the University. Its constituency
is constantly changing and it is
bound together by no stated creed
or ceremonials. We ask a cosmo
politan congregation, who, under
ordinary circumstances, would seek
a church which best expressed their
religious sentiments, to be satisfied
with a church outside the ranks.
It is a strange experiment, but
when I hear of the state of religion
in the Eastern universities, I con
fess that I am astonished at the
hearty response of the students to;
the work of this church.
"Now let. me state the great
principles for which the church
stands: First, for religion, for
Christ and Christianity, for spirit
ual idealism, and for immortality.
The business of the church is to
instill these great humanizing prin
ciples into the highly specialized
life of the University. The princi
ples of your moral and spiritual
life you will find enshrined in the
teachings of your church. She is
your spiritual mother, the alma
mater of your higher life."
