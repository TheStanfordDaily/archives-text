# Training Rules in Force.
## 
### 
Strict training rules for the
track men went into effect to-day.
The change in the weather brought
out a large number of men to-day.
About half of the track was in
good shape, and this part was used
by the runners all day. A few
clear days will put the whole track
in excellent Bhape.
