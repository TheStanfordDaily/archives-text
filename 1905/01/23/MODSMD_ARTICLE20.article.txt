# Baseball Hindered by Rain.
## 
### 
Coach Cowden took charge of the
baseball squad again on Friday
afternoon, and the men were given

work similar to that tried earlier
in the week. The only noticeable
addition to the tquad was that of
Stott, who is expected to till the
catcher's position this year. Rain
prevented practice on Saturday,
and the wet weather continuing on
Sunday, the diamond was so thor
oughly soaked that it will take
several days of good weather to put
it in condition for fast fielding.
