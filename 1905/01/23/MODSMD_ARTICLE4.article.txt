# "Quad" Record Broken
## 
### 
The number of assessments col
lected by the manager of the '06
Quad reached the two hundred
mark to day. This is believed to
be a record number of paid assess
ments. Manager Henley of the '04
Quad collected 198 assessments,
which has been regarded as the re
cord up to the present time.
