## A. Sherriffs, '05, D.D. Sales, '06, and R.G. Barnett, '05, to Represent Stanford in Contest with California. 
### 
AFTER an unusually close and
interesting try-out in the cha
pel Saturday evening, A. Sherriffs,
'05, D. L). Sales, '06, and It. G. l>ar
nett, '05, were chosen to represent
Stanford in the annual contest for
the Carnot medal, which will be
held in Assembly Hall, February
3d. A. It. Fletcher was named as
alternate. F. Koehr, '04, presided,
and after announcing the condi
tions of the debate, he read the

question for discussion, which had
been given the men at 6 o'clock,
as follows:
"Resolved, That the action of the
French Government in closing the
Catholic schools is prejudicial to
the educational welfare of the
French Republic."
W. L. Blair, '05, E. A. Cunha,
'06, A. R. Fletcher, '05, and P. D.
Swing, '05. supported the afiirma
tive, and R. G. Harnett, '05, 1). D.
Sales, '06, J. L. Maloy, '06, and A.
Sherriffs, '05, the negative, speak
ing in the order named. Each
man delivered two speeches,of fifteen
and four minutes each. Sherriffs
was logical and forcible, his ex
temporaneous work in his second
speech being the best in the contest.

Sales did his best work in his re
buttal speech, when lie drew a cle
ver comparison of the arguments
presented by the two sides, showing
that 'his opponents had failed to
answer his arguments. Barnett's
strong point was a cool, logical
presentation of his case, lie clear
ly defined the subject and then
contented himself with making
several distinct points. Fletcher,
who was chosen alternate, won on

his thorough knowledge of the sub
ject. He seemed to he prepared on
any phase of the question, and
cleverly refuted several arguments
of the negative by bringing forward
indisputable facts.
Dr.C. A. Duniway of the History
department, I)r. R. M. Alden of
the English department, and Rev.
I). C. Gardner, chaplain of Memori
al Church, selected the team. The
team will be a strong one, especial
ly in a contest of this kind,because
the three men together combine all
the attributes of a good debater—
Sherriffe, with a powerful, convinc
ing delivery, Hales with a clever,
extemporaneous rebuttal, Harnett,
with a logical, definite presentation.
Sherriffs is the veteran debater

of the trio. He debated on his
Freshman team, was a member of
the second team in his Sophomore
year which contested with the Uni
versity of Washington, and served
on both last year's Carnot and
Intercollegiate teams. Sales was a
member of his Sophomore team.
Harnett, while he has never served
on a class or varsity team, has ac
quired much experience by work
in the Euphronia Literary Society.
