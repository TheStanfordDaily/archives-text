# ATHLETIC FIELD PLANS.
## Members of Training-house Corporation Prepare Outline for the Trustees. 
### 
A joint meeting of the Training
house Corporation and the Execu
tive Committee was held Saturday
afternoon in the office of Dr.
Angell in the Psychology building
forthe purpose of considering plans
for the new athletic field. The
maps submitted by the Training
house Corporation were discussed
with reference to convenience of
location and expense. The meet
ing listened to the explanation of
the plans by Dr. Angell, and after
careful consideration of them, it
was decided to present them at the
meeting of the University trustees
next week for approval. The
whole matter of building the new
athletic field rests on the action of
that body. All the plans have
been drawn up, and as soon as the
trustees act on them the Executivo
Committee and Training-bouse
Corporation will proceed with ac
tive measures for the erection of
the stadium.
The Training-house Corporation
did not elect a new member to fill
the vacancy left by the resignation
of J. Hurt Gildersleeve, ex-'O3. Ow
ing to the fact that the names of
the candidates nominated by the
Executive Committee were not pre
sented according to the technical
prescription of the constitution of
the corporation, they were referred
back to the Executive Committee
and will be considered at the next
meeting of the Training-house Cor
poration on Wednesday, February
Ist. At that time it is probable
that certain changes will be made
in the constitution of the organi
zation, particularly in regard to
membership and the continuation
of the corporation after the com
pletion of the field.
