# INTERCLASS BASEBALL GAMES.
## Contests for the Championship Will Occur During Next Week. 
### 
The interclass baseball games
have been set for the first of next
week. The game between the
Freshman and Sophomore classes
is to take place Monday afternoon
and the match between the two
upper classes on Tuesday. The
winners of these contests will then
play the deciding game for the
championship on Thursday after
noon.
The prospect for close and excit
ing games between the class teams
this year seems very good, as every
class save the Senior will have a
team of nearly equal merit. The
Senior team so far has no players
that can fill the catcher's and
pitcher's positions. The other
classes will have strong batteries:
Theile or Menardi pitcher and Mc-
Quaid catcher for '08; Chalmers
pitcher and Stott catcher for '07;
Sales pitcher and Rook or Spaul
ding catcher for '06. For several
years past the class championship
has been won by the Senior class,
but it looks this year as if victory
will go to one of the three lower
classes.
The first game of the Varsity is
expected to take place next Satur
day against Santa Clara, but on
account of the interrupted practice
the team has not assumed any defi
nite form as yet, and it is prob
able that a number of men will
be played in the game on Satur
day.
It is probable that most of the
men who were seen on the first
team yesterday will play against
Santa Clara on next Saturday.
The first team was composed of the
following men: Sales,pitcher; Stott,
catcher; Colbert, first base; Rhyne,
second base; Presley, third base;
Rook, short-stop; Chalmers, left
field; Dehy, center field; Funke,
right field. None of these men are
Freshmen, but some of the players
from the entering class will un
doubtedly be on the team before
many games are played. Rook,
who occupied short-'stop position
yesterday, played on the Case
School of Applied Science last year
and is not eligible for this season's
team, but his position will be occu
pied by Captain Trowbridge.
Cowden is beginning to get a line
on the men. Special attention was
paid yesterday to the way the men
handled themselves while at the
bat. As the majority of the men
for the outfield positions are about
equal in fielding ability, the secur
ing of the positions will depend
upon the best hitters.
Manager Barrett has not defi
nitely arranged any more games
for the Varsity, but it is probable
that at least two more games with
Santa Clara will be scheduled in
the near future. Pitcher Iberg of
the Pacific Coast team is getting a
professional team together, and it
is probable that a game with this
nine will be added to the list.
Games will also be arranged with a
professional team being formed
around San Jose, of which Doyle,
who coached the Varsity last year,
is to be a member.
