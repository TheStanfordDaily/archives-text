In a short time the Freshman
track team will meet the best ath
letes of the bay counties high
schools. These men will be the
pick of the Academic League record
holders, and represent the best
type of preparatory school track
athlete. Freshman teams have
met individual high schools in the
past, and these meets have always
resulted in a victory for the Cardi
nal. But none of these high school
teams has been equal in strength
to the well-balanced combination
which will meet the team this year.
Chosen from student bodies which
are in the aggregate greater than
the whole Freshman class, the pick
ed team is composed of men almost
equal in age and experience to their
Stanford opponents. These schools
have excellent facilities for train
ing. and they are coached by ex
perienced university athletes. Word
comes from San Francisco that the
liveliest interest is being displayed
in the meet, and the athletes who
expect to make the team are work
ing very earnestly. The Freshman
track candidates must therefore
appreciate the fact that they have
a hard fight before them, and in
the short time they have for prepa
ration they must put forth their
best efforts if they are to win the
coming field-day.
