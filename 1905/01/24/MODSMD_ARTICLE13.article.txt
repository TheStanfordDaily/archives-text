# Engineering Building Completed.
## 
### 
The Engineering building on the
southwest corner of the Outer Quad
rangle is completely finished, and
when equipped with all the neces
sary furniture will be ready for U6e.
Nearly all the furniture needed is
now on hand, the chairs being all
that is lacking. The building will
afford accommodations for the de
partments of Mechanical, Civil and
Electrical Engineering, and it is
hoped on the part of these depart
ments that the Executive Council
of the University will be able to put
the building in the hands of the

Academic Council sometime during
this semester, for until this step is
taken the building cannot be used.
It is probable, however, that the
building will not be occupied dur
ing the present college year.
