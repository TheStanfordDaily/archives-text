# Building Work on the Museum.
## 
### 
The carpenters finished the wood
working and roofing on the Museum
last week, and on Saturday the
tinners began to place a tin roof on
the structure. The outside of the
entire building has been turned
over to the plasterers, who also be
gan work last Saturday. A few
skilled laborers have begun on the
moulding and cornice work. When
that is completed, a force of men
will be set to work plastering the
outside. During the next week
nothing will be done on the sides,
as the work must be done from the
top down. It is expected, however,
that within two weeks the work of
plastering will be begun. The
plastering will not be completed,
in all likelihood, before the end of
the term, as the rains interfere ma
terially with the progress of the
work. There are approximately
10,000 square yards of cement
plastering on the entire building.
