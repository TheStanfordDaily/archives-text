# ENGLISH CLUB TO MEET.
## C.W. Wells of University of California Will Talk on "The Modern Novel." 
### 
At the first meeting of the Eng
lish Cluh for the semester, which
will be held Wednesday at 8 at the
Gumma Phi lieta house, Assistant
Professor C. \V. Wells of the Eng
lish department of the University
of California will deliver a short
talk on the subject of "The Modern
Novel." Efforts are being made by
the executive committee and officers
of the club to secure for speakers at
the regular meetings English pro
fessors from both the universities,
as well as other noted students on
the Pacific Coast, and Professor
Wells' lecture will be the first of a
series planned with this view in
mind.
Considerable progress has been
made in selecting and training the
cast of 'Every Man in His Humor,"
and the entire cast will be settled
upon by the beginning of next
week. The work has been slightly
delayed by a few changes that were
found desirable, but at the present
time all the important parts seem
to be satisfactorily filled. The
majority of the actors are well
known to the Stanford stage.
Next to the actual training of
the cast, the most difficult work in
connection with the production has
been the designing of suitable cos
tumes. As in"The Knight of the
Burning Pestle," no stock costumes
will be used, and this necessitates
that each costume shall be separ
ately planned with due regard to
the usages of the Jonsonian stage.
This difficult work lias been done
by Miss C. Z. Edwards, '06, as
sisted by Miss A. \V. Kimball, '04,
and Miss H. L. Darby, '05.
