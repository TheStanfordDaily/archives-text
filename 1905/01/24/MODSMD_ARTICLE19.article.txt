# POULTNEY BIGELOW SPEAKS.
## Noted Journalist and Correspondent Lectures on Conditions in the Philippines. 
### 
Poultney Bigelo\v,the well-known
war correspondent and author, lec
tured this afternoon in Assembly
Hall to a large audience. Bigelow
chose for his subject "American
Expansion in the Pacific," and pro
ceeded to draw a lesson from the
mistakes made by the Germans in
New Guinea, which resulted in the
massacre of ten missionaries last
summer. Bigelow went lo New
Guinea as a special correspondent
to investigate the causes of the in
surrection, and found that the
chief reason for the discontent of
the natives was the peculiar privi
leges granted to the German mis
sionaries by the German officials.
The German Government has
granted to its missionaries the
power of punishing disobedient na
tives by flogging. The direct cause
of the massacre was the whipping
of one of the converted natives be
cause he divorced his wife accord
ing to a native custom. This
aroused the people, and they rose
and murdered the missionaries.
This same failure to understand
the subtle and peculiar workings of
the oriental mind is responsible for
our dismal failure to accomplish
anything in the Philippines, Bige
low said. In fact, we have so in
spired the native mind with fear
and hate in our attempt to force
upon them laws and customs which
they cannot understand, that the
time is now ripe for a blood v insur
rection against us. We have armed
and drilled the native scouts to
such a state of efficiency that
should the islands rise against us,
we could with difficulty hold them.
In spite of all this, however, Bige
low said that he was an optimist
and would never vote for the re
linquishment of the islands.
