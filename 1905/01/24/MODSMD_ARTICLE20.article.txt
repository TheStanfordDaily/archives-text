# Gives Reading of "Parsifal."
## 
### 
Mrs. Bertha Kunz Baker, the
noted New York reader, gave an
interesting interpretation of Wag
ner's great opera Parsifal "at the
home of President Jordan last
night. After giving a brief outline
of the legends on which the opera
is founded, Mrs. Baker proceeded
with the reading of numerous char
acteristic passages, which she did
with a great deal of ease and pre
cision. Dr. B. C. Blodgett accom
panied the reading with selections
from the music of the opera.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Baker
was given a reception at Roble
Hall. During the afternoon she
delivered an informal talk on the
"Appreciation of Literature."
