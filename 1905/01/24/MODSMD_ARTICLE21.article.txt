# Work of the Women's League.
## 
### 
The executive committee of the
Women's League met at noon to
day to discuss the plans for the
next league meeting. The greatest
problem which has arisen in con
nection with the organization is
that of interesting all of the women
of the University in the work of
the league and to make each one
feel in a measure a sense of respon
sibility. The first meeting for this
semester has been set for February
10th, from 4 to 6 o'clock.
Through the aid of Mrs. J. C.
Branner, who has been recently
elected to the committee, plans
have been made for a "college set
tlement" afternoon. In the past
few years there have been several
Stanford graduates who have taken

up this form of work in the large
cities, and the plan is to have two
or three of these women present,
and to make the meeting an in
formal reception in their honor.
Full details will be announced
when the program for the after
noon is completed.
There will probably be two more
meetings of the league during the
term, and every effort iB being put
forth to make these interesting and
of material benefit to the league.
