# PHI DELTA PHI INITIATION.
## Nine Law Men Take Part in a Mock Trial on the Postoffice Steps. 
### 
The semi-annual public initi
ation of the Phi Delta Phi frater
nity took place at noon at the Post
office. The newly elected members
are as follows: A. A. Caldwell, '05,
G. Springmeyer, '03, L. 1). Byrne,

'06, A. N. Lewis, '06, L. R. Wein
mann, '06, R. H. Lachmund, and
P. B. Smith, '06.
The program of the initiation
differed from those of the past in
that the men were compelled to go
through their specialties as a court.
A mock trial took place at the
Postoffice in which the initiates
acted in the capacity of regular
court oflicials, one of the men being
a prisoner. The case tried was en
titled "Rex vs. Dewey," the defend
ant, L. R. Weinmann, '06, being
tried on the charge of criminal
negligence. The officers of the
court were as follows: Judge of
King Abbott's Court, A. A. Cald
well, '05; defendant, L. R. Wein
mann, '06; attorneys for the plain
tiff, D. D. Sales, '06, and E. A.
Cunha, '06; attorneys for the de
fendant, L. D. Byrne, '05, and G.
Springmeyer, '03; bailiff, R. 11.
Lachmund, '06; jury, A. N. Lewis,
'06, and P. B. Smith, '06.
The defendant was arraigned on
the charge of criminal negligence
because of the fact that he had not
received "A V' in all of his exami
nations. The evidence of the prose
cution was insufficient to convict
and the defendant was acquitted.
The formal initiation was held in
San Jose to-night.
