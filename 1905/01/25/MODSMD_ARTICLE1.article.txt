# PLANS FOR ENTERTAINMENT.
## Faculty Committee Endeavoring to Arrange for Number of Good Attractions. 
### 
The Faculty Entertainment Com
mittee has under consideration a
number of excellent attractions
which are coming to the Coast
within the next few months, and
the committee will endeavor to
bring at least two of these attrac
tions to the UDiversity in the course
of the semester. David Bispham,
the famous baritone who has long
been connected with the Metropoli
tan Opera-house of New York City,
will soon be in San Francisco, and
he may be booked for a concert at
Stanford. Bispham will be remem
bered by many as the famous bari
tone who accompanied Mme.
Schumann-Heinck here three years
a SÂ°- . . ,
Another likely attraction is the
Kneisel quartet of Boston, proba
bly the best string quartet in the
country. They have played to
gether for years and have developed
a technique which is unsurpassed.
The Dolmetsch company of mu
sicians may also be engaged for a
performance here. The Dolmetsch
troupe render old French music of
the sixteenth century on harps,
lutes, and other musical instru
ments of that period. Later in the
year, Fritz Kreisler, the famous
Austrian violinist, will be on this
Coast, and may be persuaded to
give a concert at the University.
The financial problem has been
the greatest obstacle to confront
the efforts of the committee. All
of these star attractions demand a
monetary guarantee which it is al
most impossible to raise in a com
munity of the size of Stanford.
Last year this difficulty was sur
mounted by securing pledges from
the students to a sufficient amount
to cover expenses. But the plan
did not work satisfactorily,and the
committee is seeking for a better
idea.
The first attraction offered by
the Entertainment Committee will
be Creatore's Italian Band, which
will give a concert in Assembly
Hall on Monday evening, Febru
ary 6th.
