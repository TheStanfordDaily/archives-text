# Fixing Basket-Bail Court.
## 
### 
Daring the past few days Man
ager Barrett has had workmen en
gaged in cleaning and repairing
the Roble basket-ball court. The
ground has been covered with grass
and made very uneven by recent
rains, which have thus erased the
lines.
The game with the San Jose
Normal School, which was sched
uled for last Saturday, will prob
ably be played this week.
