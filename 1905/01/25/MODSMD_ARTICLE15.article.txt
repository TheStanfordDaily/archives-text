In connection with an editorial
printed in the Daily Palo Alto a
couple of days ago about the cut
ting down of complimentary tick
ets to class productions and the
general conduct of these affairs, it
ic interesting to note that the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Associ
ated Students of the University of
California last night granted med
als in lieu of cash to the men who
wrote the football farce. In the
Daily Californian which came to
hand yesterday appeared an edi
torial upon the subject, which the
Daily Palo Alto takes the liberty
of reprinting, because it contains
some ideas to which we Stanford
men and women might give consid
erable thought. The editorial fol
lows:
"The writers of the last football
show do not want to accept the
cash prize which the Executive
Committee voted to divide equally
among them. They say they did
not write the show to make money,
and are ready to accept any em
blem, not excluding a simple letter
of thanks from the committee,
rather than money. We endorse
the sentiment. No organization in
the University should offer cash
prizes in undergraduate competi
tions. There can be professional
ism in debating or literature as
well as in athletics. The best men
in the University should not work
over a football show, or a football
song, or a junior farce, simply for
money. If they did, the Associated
Students could not afford to pay
them their price. If the committee
cannot afford to vote three hand
some watch charms, why not sub
stitute a less expensive emblem?
Certainly that would be more sat
isfactory to those concerned, not as
payment for their work, but as an
expression of thanks from the As
sociated Students for their part in
college activities."
