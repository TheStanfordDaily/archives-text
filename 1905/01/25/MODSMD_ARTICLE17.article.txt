# JANUARY "ALUMNUS."
## Editor Announces Series of Articles on the Great Universities of the World. 
### 
The January number of the
Alumnus lias just been issued. In
a statement of his plans for the
future of the magazine the editor,
Archie ltice. '95, announces the in
teresting fact that a beginning has
been made to get for tiie Alumnus
illustrated special articles about
each of the great universities of
America, Europe, and the Orient.
This series, unique in the history
of college publications, can run
continuously for several years,
making Stanford's graduate maga
zine an authority on the campus
life and student customs of all the
notable colleges of the world.
The Alumnus also contains a
long article on "California's Many
Mining Industries," illustrated by
six full-page halftones of different
types of famous mines. This ar
ticle is written with special bearing
upon the opportunities the mineral
fields of California offer Stanford's
graduates. There is also an inter
esting descriptive article on what
the Lewis and Clark Exposition
will be, with two excellent half
tones of principal buildings. This
article also has particular Stanford
significance. There is a carefully
compiled article —illustrated by
typical California high school
buildings —on Stanford graduates
teaching in California high schools
and what the pay is and what
courses pay best. As there are 175
Stanford graduates in the work,
103 of them women and 72 of them
men, and as a directory arranged
by towns accompanies the article,
it is a subject that will prove of
more than passing interest, particu
larly for the professional informa
tion given.
The four editorials are vigorous
discussions of the editor's plans for
future articles and what they are
to be; the recent elimination of
students for poor scholarship; the
case of Rose, the Michigan athlete,
with new information about why
he went to Michigan; and comment
on the economy of the committee
having charge of the new athletic
grounds.
