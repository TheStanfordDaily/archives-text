# California Boating Troubles.

### 
The Boating Club of the Univer
sity of California is having diffi
culty in finding a location for its
boat-house, which is at present
located at the Oakland estuary.
The owner of the land has sold it
to the Oakland Development Com
pany, which has notified the boat
ing association that their boat
house must be removed within six
ty days. Several projects are under
consideration whereby a perma
nent location may be obtained.
One of the most likely plans is to
secure land and build a house on
Lake Merritt, the water front of
West Oakland. Lake Merritt
would be much more convenient
than the present location, but its
swimming facilities are much in
ferior.
Southern California daily papers
have put forth a plan to have the
spring regatta between Stanford
and California held at Pie del Rey
beach, near Los Angeles, and the
boating association authorities are
in communication with the Pie del
Rey Beach Company in regard to
its watercourse and the possibility
of holding a contest in the southern
cart of the State.
