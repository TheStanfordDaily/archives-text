At the first meeting of the Uni
versity Band last night, J. E.
Stewart, '07, was re-elected director
and L. W. Cutler, '06, manager for
the present semester. Cutler made
a few remarks about the work of
the Band. He appealed to the
members to be punctual at prac
tices, so that good music might be
furnished at the intercollegiate
meets that take place this spring.
He also stated that some new con
cert music had been purchased and
that later in the semester prome
nade concerts would be given.
Thursday nights at 7:15 was the
time fixed for all practices. The
first regular practice will take place
Thursday, February 2d, at 7:15, in
the band-room in the Engineering
building, when all old members
and prospective new ones are to be
on hand with their instruments,
ready for practice.
