# MAY NOT LEAVE THE CAMPUS
## Musical Clubs' Plans Upset by the Unexpected Action of the Faculty. 
### 
The series of concerts which the
leaders of the combined musical
clubs had planned will not be given.
The faculty committee which has
charge of such affairs has laid down
the rule that no student organiza
tion representing the University
can leave the campus during the
college year, except during vaca
tions, or unless the trips can be
taken so that the students in the
clubs will not miss any of their
University work.
The series of concerts, which had
been planned for February, in
cluded a concert on

the campus on the
4th, and besides
concerts at San
Francisco and Bel
mont, and a trip
to Santa Cruz, Del
Monte and the sur
rounding towns. To
take this trip it
would be necessary
for the members of
the Musical Clubs
to be absent from
the University for
about a week. The
concerts at San
Francisco and Bel
mont have also
been abandoned,
but the concert on
the campus will be
given, though not
on February 4th.
Last semester the
Christmas vacation
trip in Southern
California was giv
en up on account
of the time requir
ed in rehearsal.
Since it has been
decided that the
track team shall go
south during the
spring vacation
Manager 11. Barrett

has been working on a plan to take
the musical clubs on a tour at that
time, but as yet nothing definite
has been decided, and the trip will
not be taken unless it is thought
that it will prove a financial suc
cess.
Manager Rarrett is also planning
a concert to be given on the campus
the night of the intercollegiate base
ball game which will be played
here.
