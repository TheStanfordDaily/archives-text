# TALKS OF AMERICAN NOVEL.
## Professor Wells of California Gives Interesting Address Before English Club. 
### 
At the first meeting of the Eng
lish Club for this semester, held at
the Gamma Phi Beta house last
night, Professor C. \V. Wells of the
University of California delivered
an interesting lecture on the subject
of "The American Novel." The
lecture consisted of a brief outline
of what has been done so far in
American literature to evolve a
distinctly American type of novel,
and what may be considered the
possibilities that are before the
American novelist of to-day.
Dividing the topic sectionally,
Professor Wells stated that New
England is the only part of the
United States of today that has re
ceived adequate treatment at the
hands of our novelists. In the
novels of Hawthorne, the American
Dante, can be seen the stern spirit
of the Puritan ancestor, which has
formed one of the great under
currents in American history. The
South as a whole has never pro
duced a great novel. The novels
that deal with Virginia life, like
"Richard Carvel," are numerous,
but they represent not a living
epic of Southern life, but a form of
literary recrudescence. Again, the
novels of the South are sectional,
and portray life in sections not at
all representative of the entire
South. The nearest approach to a
representative Southern novel is
not to be found, as might be ex
pected, in "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
but in Mark Twain's "Huckleberry
Finn." In this book the life of the
lower portion of the Mississippi
Valley is vividly portrayed.
New England has received the
literary expression that has not
yet come to the South, but it is the
New England of the past and not
of the present day that has been
represented. The American traits
which must appear in an American
novel would no longer be found
concentrated in New England.
They have moved westward with
our civilization, across the Alleghe
nies, across the great plains of the
Mississippi Valley, across the
Rockies to the Pacific Slope. In
his novels of California life, Frank
Norris has approached, but not
reached, the novel that would
stand as an epic of American life.
Before the regular program of
the evening was taken up, A. 11.
Fletcher, '05, and Miss H. M. Pat
terson, '05, were elected to the ex
ecutive committee. A vote of
thanks was given to Elder and
Company of San Francisco, who
presented the members of the club
with neatly bound copies of Pro
fessor R. M. Alden's "Consolatio,"
the ode to the memory of the vic
tims of the typhoid epidemic, which
was read at the Commencement
exercises of 1903.
