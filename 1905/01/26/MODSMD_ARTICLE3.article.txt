"The Rivals" was written by
Richard Brinsley Sheridan in 1774,
and was first produced at Covent
Garden, London, in 1775. The

"rivals" are embodied in one per
son, and about the mystery of this
dual personality the action of the
play revolves. Captain Absolute,
the gallant and youthful lover, in
troduces himself to the romantic
Lydia Languish as Ensign Beverly,
a poor young subaltern, instead of
his true self, heir to Sir Anthony, a
baronet with Â£4000 a year. His
glamor wins the heart of Lydia,
who looks forward with delight to

an elopement. At this point Bev
erly's plans are upeet by the ar
rival of his father, who is bent 011
marrying him in his true character
to the same lady; and thus the
lover finds himself at once the ro
mantic and adored Beverly and
the detested captain.
