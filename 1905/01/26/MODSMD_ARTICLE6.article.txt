# "QUAD" CONTEST NEARS END.
## Manuscripts for the '06 Annual Story and Poem Must Be in Within a Week. 
### 
The editors of the '06 Quad and
members of the committee in charge
of the Quad story and poem com
petitions call attention to the fact
that only a little more than a week
remains before the time set for the
closing of the competition. The date
for this is February 3d, and as yet
very little material has been
banded in either to the editors or
the committee.
In calling attention to this fact
it may be well to review the condi
tions of the competitions. Although
the judges will be at liberty to con-

sider any story or
poem by an under
graduate that has
appeared in a Stan
ford publication
during the last
year, it is desirable
that as many man
uscripts as possible
be placed in their
hands in order that
the prize may be
awarded to the very
best literary work
done during the
year at Stanford.
The prize offered
for the best story is
$15, and for the
poem $7.50. Man
uscripts should be
sent to Miss E. 11.
Mirrielees, '06. A
committee of three
members of the
English faculty
will judge the man
