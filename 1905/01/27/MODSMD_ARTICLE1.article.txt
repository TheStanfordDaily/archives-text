# DEPARTMENT TRACK MEET.
## First Contest of the Semester Will Take Place on Oval Saturday Morning. 
### 
The first track meet of the sea
son will be held on the oval to
morrow morning, beginning at 10
o'clock. It will be in the nature
of a contest between the men of the
different departments of the Uni
versity, and at the same time it
will be a try-out for the privilege
of going on the rubbing list. Every
man who makes a certain record
will be placed on this list. There
will be no handicaps, every man
starting from scratch. All the dis
tances except the dashes will be
shortened because of the short
length of time the men have been
in training. The entries by events
