It is reported that the Varsity
baseball coach and captain will
choose men who will play on the
Freshman team. If this is done,
it is likely to materially improve
the quality of this annual game,
and at the same time put an end
to disagreeable charges that favorit
ism is shown by captains, who
have hitherto selected their own
teams and made changes at their
pleasure. There would seem to be
no doubt of the superior judgment
of Varsity coach and captain in se
lecting a team. They are far bet
ter able to pass upon the merits of
the candidates, and it would no
longer be possible for a class cap
tain to call in a large number of
new men in the hope of retrieving
a losing game or for other reasons
which are sometimes assigned.
Under these conditions it will mean
a great deal more to make the
team, and probably baseball sweat
ers will be held in higher esteem
than they are at the present day.
