# RUSSIAN EXILE LECTURES.
## Colonel Lochwitzky Describes His Experiences as a Russian Prisoner. 
### 
Lieutenant-Colonel A. M. Loch
witzky lectured last night in the
chapel, describing his experiences
as a Russian political prisoner both
in St. Petersburg and on the island
of Saghalien. Colonel Lochwitzky
is the son of a former Russian As
sistant Secretary of War, who was
ousted by General Kuropatkin.
In 1897, while working in the St.
Petersburg War Office, Colonel
Lochwitzky was asked by the mem
bers of the reform party to open a
school for them on his estates near
the city. He did this, and news of
it having come to the Government,
he was arrested and charged with
establishing secretly a school op
posed to the Czar. He was exam
ined before a colonel of the Russian
gendarmes, and when he refused to
disclose the names of his friends in
the reform party, he was thrown
into a dungeon in the prison of
Peter and Paul, in St. Petersburg.
After a vain attempt to starve
him into submission, he was with
out further trial sentenced to four
years of hard labor on the island
of Saghalien. Here, because of his
superior education, he was made
first a doctor's clerk and then
schoolmaster. In these capacities
he came into close contact with the
Russian officials and was able to
study the horrible and almost in
conceivable corruption which exists
among them. The books of the
governor were in Buch a terrible
state that many convicts whose
terms were long since finished still
labored on the island. In other
instances the money sent by Rus
sian charitable societies for the
families of the unfortunate prison
ers went to enrich the corrupt
officials.
After serving his term of four
years, the colonel was given a posi
tion as secretary by the British
consul at Vladivostok. But here
again he incurred the enmity of the
colonel of gendarmes by refusing
to act as a spy at the meetings of
the foreign consuls. He was de
nounced anonymously and forced
to flee secretly from Vladivostok
on a Japanese steamer. He re
mained in Japan until the out
break of the war with Russia, and
then went over to China. An at
tempt was made to extradite him,
and he barely managed to escape
to Japan and from there to San
Francisco.
