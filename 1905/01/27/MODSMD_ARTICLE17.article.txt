# TRAINING FOR THE CREW.
## Work of the Boating Men Progressing Well.—Thirty-six Candidates Out. 
### 
That a keen interest in boating
at Stanford is not lacking is shown
by the fact that there are at present
thirty-six men out for practice,with
a probability that several more will
be out in a few days. The practice
work, which is at present being done
on tiie rowing - machines in the
gymnasium, has proved of great
value. In this kind of work the
coach can be at the side of each
man and detect his faults far better
than when serving as coxswain.
The training of the men for the
crew this year will be practically
the same as the method adopted for
track athletics. Strict training rules
must be observed by every man.
There are a number of candidates
who have signed for gymnasium
work, and by permission of the
Gymnasium authorities these men
are allowed to substitute boating
for their regular work.
The boat-house at Lagunita will
be overhauled and cleaned up, and
the men will begin practice in the
shells soon. The four-oared and
pair-oared barges will be used on
the lake, and the new shell will be
reserved for work at Redwood later
in the season.

practice is as follows: \V. H. Dole,
