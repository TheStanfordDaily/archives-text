# Now Leader of Mandolin Club.
## 
### 
F. R. Lanagan, '08, lias been
chosen leader of the Mandolin
Club to succeed W. H. Lanagan,
'05, who was leader of the club hint
year. At the meeting of the club
yesterday, when the final try-out
was held, it was decided to cut
down the number of members of
the club. There have always been
four first and four second mando
lin players, but hereafter there will
be only three of each, and enough

guitars to support them. The rea
son for this is that the leaders
thought it better to have only
three in each position and have
them the best possible. Hereafter
the club will meet twice a week,
and before the concert, practices
will be held nightly.
The following men were success
ful in yesterday's contest: First
mandolin —N. E. Dole, '04, J. W.
Rosenfeld, '06, F. R. Lanagan, '08;
second mandolin—G. E. Dole, '07,
H. E. Ruggles, '07, F. W. Dorr, '08;
guitars—F. B. Goudy, '05, W. F.
Brackett, '08, E. K. Soper, '08, F.P.
Whitaker, '05.
