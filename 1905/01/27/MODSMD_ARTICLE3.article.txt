# Gables for the Gymnasium.
## 
### 
An important change in the
architecture of the new Gymna
sium building has been decided
upon. The appearance of the long
blank walls forming the two sides
of the structure is to be improved
by constructing gables at the rear
end of each side. The new gables will
correspond to those ornamenting the
front of the building, and by mak
ing a break in the monotony of
the sides of the building, as viewed
from the Library building, will do
much toward increasing the archi
tectural beauty of the Gymnasium.
These gables were in the original
plans, but were changed when con
struction was begun.
