### 
The Freshmen will play the
. Sophomores in the first of the
series of interclass baseball games
on Monday. The game will take
place on the diamond at 3 o'clock.
Neither team has chosen a cap
tain, and it is uncertain who will
fill the various positions. It is prob
able that the coach and Varsity
captain will select the first-year
team just before the game from the
large squad out for the nine.
Among the promising men on
the Freshman squad who will prob
ably be seen in the game are Cad
walader, Fenton, Bell, Theile, Me
nardi, McQuaid, Johnson, Lantz,
and Plageman.
The Sophomores will have a
team similar to that which repre
sented the class last year. Among
the men who played last season
and may be expected to represent
their class again are: Chalmers,
pitcher; Stott, catcher; Presley,
first base; Rhyne, short-stop; Kel
ley, third base; and McLain, left
field. The positions of second base,
center field, and right field will be
filled with new men.
