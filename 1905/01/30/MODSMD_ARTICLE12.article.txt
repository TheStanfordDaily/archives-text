The president of the Junior class
has made a good start by cutting
down the size of the Junior week
committees. Anyone who has
served on a committee knows that
the greater part of the work is done
by a few of the members, and to
put more than five on the ordinary
committee merely serves to clog the
wheels. Smaller committees mean
greater co-operation and efficiency,
and, besides, a reduction in the
number of complimentary tickets
that keep needed money out of the
class treasury.
