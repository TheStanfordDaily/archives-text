The production of "The Rivals"
by members of the Sophomore class
last Friday evening was a triumph
for the whole University. It ex
celled the '06 performance of
"David Garrick" as a polished,
well-balanced performance, and for
its excellence in these regards it
may well be classed with the pro
ductions of the English Club. It
is little short of remarkable that
men and women practically with
out previous experience should
have done such perfect work. Fur
thermore, it marks the attainment
of a standard in dramatics that the
University has long been waiting
for. The Sophomores of last year
opened the way for progress in this
direction, and the wealth of fine
talent in the '07 class makes it
plain that the development of the
next few years will goon unbroken.
