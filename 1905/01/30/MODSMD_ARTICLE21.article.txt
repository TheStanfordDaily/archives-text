# SOPHOMORES WIN DEBATE.
## Defeat the Freshmen in Seventh Annual Contest Between Under Classes. 
### 
In the chapel Saturday evening
the Sophomore debaters were victo
rious over the Freshmen in the
seventh annual debate. The win
ning team had the advnntage in
experience and team work, and the
Freshmen were handicapped by
the sudden illness of G. C. Halsey,
who was compelled to stop in the
middle of his speech.
The question was, "Resolved,
That a Federal statute should be
passed providing for Federal char
ters for all companies doing or in
tending to do business in more
than one State, and which shall
apply for incorporation under such
charter." The Frsshmen supported
the affirmative side of the question
and the Sophomores the negative.
The debate was opened by C. C.
McColloch for the affirmative. He
dealt with the need of a reforma
tion in the present system of grant
ing charters to corporations, and
endeavored to show that the Fed
eral Government could constitu
tionally control interstate com
merce. J. W. Maloy spoke first for
the negative. In a well-organized
speech he endeavored to show that a
change in the present system was
not necessary. G. C. Halsey con
tinued the argument for the affirm
ative, but was suddenly taken ill
and compelled to stop. F.A. Fish
er, the second speaker on the nega
tive, presented in a logical manner
the impossibility of placing the
granting of charters under the Fed
eral Government. The next speaker
for the affirmative whs R.E. Hodge,
and F.L. Everson closed the debate
for the negative.
The judges, Professor H. A. Mil
lis, H. M. Lewis, '04, and 0. C.
Spencer, '04, were out but a few
minutes until they decided in favor
of the Sophomores. 11. G. Barnett
presided at the meeting.
