# SUCCESS OF "THE RIVALS."
## Performance Given by the Sophomore Class with Considerable Ability. 
### 
The Sophomore play, "The Ri
vals," which was presented in As
sembly Hall Friday night, was a
success in everyway. Unusual in
terest attached itself to the produc
tion because of the fact that under
classmen should attempt to stage
so difficult a play, and also because
the actors, with but one exception,
had never before appeared in col
lege dramatics.
Every member of the cast execut
ed his or her part in a clever fash
ion, but the work of J. C. Ray, as Sir
Anthony Absolute, and R. S. Kel
l°gg, as Bob Acres, shone above the
rest. Ray played the difficult role
of the aged Sir Anthony like a vet
eran. His performance stamps
him as one of the best actors in
college. Kellogg did the comic
part of Bob Acres remarkably well.
His voice and manner were well
adapted to the part.
All the women's roles were well
done. Miss Clarice Moise had the
most difficult role in Mrs. Mala
prop, and she carried it remark
ably well. Miss Claire Pedlar made
a very charming Lvdia Languish,
and Miss Officer as the innocent
maid was very dainty. Miss Moore
as Julia was quite sympathetic.
