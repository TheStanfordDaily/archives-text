# CHANGES IN ATHLETIC AGREEMENT.
## Graduate Coach System Abandoned, and Sanction Given to Boating and Freshman Track. Limitation of Entries. 
### 
SEVERAL changes of great im
portance were made in the in
tercollegiate athletic agreement
between California and Stanford
at the meeting oi the Intercollegi
ate Athletic Committees of the two
universities in San Francisco Sat
urday. Stanford was represented
by C. M. Fickert, '98, J. T. Nourse,
'00, and R. W. Barrett, '04. The
California representatives were E.
J. Brown, G. D. Bishop, and E.
\V. Oecoto. The two committees
met at the Palace Hotel at 8 o'clock
Saturday evening, and after elect
ing Nourse chairman and Bishop
secretary, proceeded to the business
of amending the four-year inter
collegiate agreement, which ex
pired December 31, 1904.
Graduate Coaches Abandoned.
The most important change made
in the agreement was the striking
out of article V, relating to system
of graduate football coaches which
has been in effect for the past four
years. Hereafter either university
may employ any class of coach it
may choose. The change was
strongly desired by the California
delegates and was opposed by the
Stanford committee. A tie vote
was taken, and the outcome was a
compromise resulting in thechange
that makes professional coaches
possible. This recommendation
must be sanctioned by other repre
sentatives of the two universities
before becoming law, however.
Boating and Freshman Track.
Upon the motion of Barrett, sec
onded by Fickert, both varsity and
freshman boating contests were
added to the list of annual inter
collegiate contests enumerated in
section 2 of article I. This amend
ment puts boating on an intercol
legiate basis, as it is in Eastern col
leges.
The proposal to institute an in
tercollegiate freshman baseball
game and track meet was given
long discussion. California strongly
favored the abandonment of the
idea of a freshman baseball game,
while the Stanford representatives
favored it. The proposal for an
intercollegiate freshman track meet,
favored by Stanford, was also op
posed by California. It was argued
that too many contests detracted
greatly from the varsity meets, and
were detrimental to the progress of
the student. Fickert moved that
the two committees again com
promise, and that the question of
freshman baseball he dropped in
favor of a freshman track meet.
Accordingly it was agreed to aban
don intercollegiate freshman base
ball, and to sanction intercollegiate
freshman track meets. It is ex
pected that these meets will develop
much more material than the pres
ent system of varsity track meets
does, since the trainers' attention
will be more closely directed to
new men who come out.
Limitation on Entries.
The question of how many

men shall be allowed to enter
each track event, which has re
peatedly demanded attention for
several years, was warmly contest
ed. Barrett, acting for Stanford,
moved that a limit of five men to
each event be made. California
contended for an unlimited num
ber. It was finally decided that no
more than eight men shall start in
any event in an intercollegiate
track meet.
Four-Year Rule Made Plainer.
Article 11, on the eligibility of
contestants,was discussed at length.
Section 6 of this article, on the
four-year rule, was left out in favor
of a differently worded rule which
is expected to clear up the former
ambiguity of the clause and pre
vents its further misinterpretation.
As it now stands, the rule states
that no student shall compete in
any character of varsity intercol
legiate contests after representing
his university during four collegi
ate years, "provided that this limi
tation shall begin to run from the
beginning of the semester in which
said student first contested; and
provided further that if any stu
dent does not represent his univer
sity during one entire collegiate
year, said limit shall notbedeemed
to include said year."
More Liberty for Amateurs.
The section defining an amateur
was amended, the following clause
being added to the present agree
ment:
"However, no person shall lose
his amateur standing by playing
against a professional for any prize,
or where an admission fee is
charged, if it is done under the
auspices and bona fide control of
the university to which he be
longs."
As the agreement formerly stood
it was practically a "dead letter,"
since by its definition persons who
played against professional teams
in any of our ordinary campus
practice games, where admission is
charged, became professionals. The
new rule will also tend to break up
summer professionalism among
players on the university teams,
since permission must be secured
from the university before the
player can enter outside games.
Restriction on Special Students.
The Stanford delegates encount
ered considerable difficulty in se
curing the passage of a rule to the
effect that a student in any depart
ment of his university not requir
ing entrance examinations or their
equivalent shall be considered a
special student. The object of the
rule is to restrict the students of
the California Affiliated Colleges,
whose students, as specials, will be
prevented from participating in
many contests open to students of
regular standing.
Intercollegiate Dates Fixed.
The committees concluded their
work by fixing the dates of the

various intercollegiate contests,
which shall hereafter, with the ex
ception of boating, be held only on
the grounds of one or other of the
two universities. The varsity track
meet this year will be held at Cali
fornia on the third Saturday in
April, to alternate in future years.
The varsity football game will be
played on the new field at Stanford.
Upon the motion of Fickert it was
decided to hold the freshman inter
collegiate football game of 1905 at
California to prevent too many
contests being played on one cam
pus. The first freshman field-day
will be held at California on the
last Saturday of March, 1906.
The baseball games will take
place on the first and second Sat
urdays in April, and if a third
game iB necessary it will be played
on the fourth Saturday of the same
month. The tennis match is to
take place on the third Saturday
in April, on the morning of the
varsity track meet, while the date
of the rowing contests has been set
for the first Saturday in May.
