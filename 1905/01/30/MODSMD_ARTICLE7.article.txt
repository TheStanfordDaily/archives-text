# JUNIOR COMMITTEES NAMED.
## Number of Members of Each Body Cut Down by President Cutler. 
### 
President L. W. Cutler of the
Junior class to-day announced the
committees which will have charge
of the class events this semester.
They are as follows:
Prom Committee —S. G. Jewett,
J. E. Campbell, Miss Charlotte El
liott, Miss F. M. Grace and E. A.
Cunha, chairman. *
Junior Day Comminee —R. E.
Naftzger, L. A. Henley and D. D.
Sales, chairman.
Farce Committee —B. S. Allen, J.
Nibley, Miss E. R. Mirrielees, Miss
Alice S. Hayes and P. C. Edwards,
chairman.
The size of the committees has
been considerably reduced this year
because of the belief that a small
committee is just as efficient as a
large one. Last year's Prom Com
mittee numbered eight, while it has
been cut this year to five. The
Junior Day and Farce committees
have been cut from six members
each to three and five respectively.
