# WANTED â€”A JUNIOR FARCE.
## Committee Will Set a Time Limit for the Presentation of Manuscripts. 
### 
The Junior Farce Committee has
this year adopted a new method in
selecting a class play. They desire
to make the competition as short
as possible in order that more time
may be given to the actual rehears
ing and staging of the play. For
this reason they have requested
those who expect to enter the com
petition to appear before the com
mittee at once for a preliminary
consultation. Hours for this con
sultation may be arranged with P.
C. Edwards, 'OG, chairman of the
committee.
At this preliminary hearing au
thors of farces will be expected to
report on the amount of time need
ed to finish their productions and
to give a brief outline of the plot.
From the facts thus established the
committee will be able to set a time
limit on the competition that will
accord with the desires of those
competing.
