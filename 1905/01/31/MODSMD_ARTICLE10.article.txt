### 
Arrangements have been com
pleted with Elder and Company of
San Francisco for publishing the
book on "Every Man in His Hu
mour." The book is to contain sixty
pages, with ten full-page cuts, and
will have numerous articles upon
subjects that may lead to a better
understanding of the play. Elder
and Company handled the book
which was published by the Eng
lish Club accompanying the
presentation of "The Knight of the
Burning Pestle."
