The results of the recent meeting
of the athletic committees of the
two universities can, on the whole,
be regarded with satisfaction by
Stanford. It is unquestionable
that the general sentiment here is
in favor of the graduate coach sys
tem because it tends to lessen the
spirit of professionalism. Experi
ence has taught us that under
favorable conditions it produces
good football, too. But the strong
opposition at California made it
plain long before the meeting that
it would be impossible to secure a
new lease of life for this part of the
agreement, and, besides, there may
be considerable force to the argu
ments against the system. Any
way, Stanford can independently,
if it so desires, continue to employ
its graduate coaches. If we find
that California gains anything by
importing an Eastern man, there
will be nothing to prevent us from
doing the same.
But apart from this, two very
important things were accom
plished by Stanford's representa
tives. The first of these was the
placing of a limitation upon the
number of entries that may be
made in any one track event by
each side. It has always been the
policy of California to enter a need
lessly large number of men in track
events, and the results have often
been serious to Stanford runners.
For years efforts have been made
to stop the abuse, but without suc
cess until now. The second impor
tant accomplishment was theadop
tion of the rule that students in
any department not requiring en
trance examinations shall be re
garded as special students, and
shall be regarded as ineligible to
compete in any intercollegiate
events until they shall have ten
hours of university credit. This
rule will prevent a man taking

| work in the California Affiliated
Colleges, with no university stand
ing whatever, from competing in
many of the intercollegiate con
tests. When he has shown that he
is a bona fide student, the disabil
ity no longer operates.
The interpretation of the four
year rule is something that has
long been needed. The definition
given by the athletic committees
will probably be satisfactory to
both universities. The committees
sayl that a man who begins his
career in intercollegiate athletics
in the second semester of a college
year may participate in the first
semester of the fifth year. In
other words, what he lost at the be
ginning he may add on to the end
of his college career. This is thor
oughly just and will give many
fine athletes in both universities
opportunity to fully complete their
athletic careers.
