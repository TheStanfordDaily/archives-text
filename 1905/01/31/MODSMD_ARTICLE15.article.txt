### 
An invitation has been issued by
Mrs. A. R. Voorhies of »San Fran
cisco, president of the Albert Sid
ney Johnston Chapter of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy, to
the women in Stanford University
who are eligible to membership in
that organization to join the city
chapter. The national organiza
tion of the Daughters of the Con
federacy is to hold its annual meet
ing in San Francisco during the
fall of the present year, and a large
part of the success of the conven
tion will be due to the efforts of
the Albert Sidney Johnston chap
ter, which contains over three hun
dred members. The social func
tions of this chapter have rendered
it well known for its Southern hos
pitality, and its list of patronesses
contains the names of some of Cali
fornia's best-known women. It is
planned to bring the visitors who
attend the convention to Stanford
for a day, in the hope that there
will be a sufficient membership
here to extend them a suitable re
ception.
The qualifications for member
ship are that the applicant has had
some blood relation who fought on
the Confederate side during the
Rebellion, and that two ex-soldiers
shall sign the application, giving
the regiment and company in
which the relative was enlisted.
It is hoped that all women who
are now in college and who are
eligible to membership will com
municate with Miss Grace Barrett,
Stanford University, at. once, with
the aim in view of joining the city
organization or of forming an aux
iliary chapter here.
