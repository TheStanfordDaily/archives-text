# Italian Band Tickets on Sale.

### 
Tickets for the concert to be given
by Creatore's Italian Band in As
sembly Hall Monday evening were
placed on sale this morning at the
University Bookstore and at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
The prices are fifty and seventy-five
cents. The band gave its initial
concert in San Francisco last night
and was received very favorably.
The musical critic of the Chronicle
has this to say in regard to the
performance:
"Memories of Creatore when he
was in this city about four years
ago brought out a large crowd last

evening. No one was disappointed,
the all-around verdict being that
he is greater and more interesting
than before. It would be a wooden
musician who could not play with
the most subtle variations of light
and shade under Creatore's insist
ence. His enthusiasm must be in
fectious. He jumps from one
group of musicians to another; with
his expressive hands he indicates
the tones, and when his hands are
occupied with soothing or stimulat
ing the instruments, his mouth
shapes to tone as if he were going
to sing it. The captious might call
his movements 'antics.' They are,
in truth, rational, if pronounced,
and bring from the band music
that is polished to veritable perfec
tion."
