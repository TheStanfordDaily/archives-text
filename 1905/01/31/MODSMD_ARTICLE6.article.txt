# PLANNING THEIR OWN HOMES
## Christian Associations Expect to Erect Handsome Buildings on the Campus. 
### 
Plans for the Young Men's and
Young Women's Christian Associa
tions for the erection of new build
ings, which have been under con
sideration for some time, have taken
a more definite form, and the pros
pects of two new structures on the
campus seem very bright.
During the last few years the
work of both associations has grown
so that they are unable to carry on
the work in the present quarters.
They have always had small rooms
on the quad, where their employ
ment bureau, Bible classes, and
committee meetings have been held.
The plan is for each association to
erect a building which can be ÜBed
as headquarters for their work.
The buildings, which would cost
$15,000 each, according to the pres
ent plane, would be frame struc
tures, trimmed with stone.
The following committee has
charge of the work: Miss E. J.
Brown, '05, Miss L. C. Bailey, '05,
Miss B. R. French, '05, H. A. Moran,
1 05, C. S. Osgood, '06, R. E. Hodge,
'07, C. L. Duncan, '05, and H. W.
Strong, '06. This committee, which
has been assisted by Dr. Baldwin
of Palo Alto, has discussed the plans
with most of the University authori
ties, all of whom regard the plans
with favor. As yet no petition has
been brought up before the Board of
Trustees, but it is not thought that
any difficulty will be met.
Dr. Baldwin, ex-president of Po
mona College, who has had a great
deal of experience in college asso
ciation work, has offered to lend
his aid in raising the money for the
buildings.
On April 13th a large mass meet
ing will be held on the campus,
during which time many of the
most prominent college associations
will be here. At this time the money
for the buildings will be raised.
