The Acacia fraternity, the Ma
sonic organization which was es
tablished at Stanford last semester,
has leased the Roosevelt house in
Palo Alto, and a number of the
members of the society moved into
their new quarters to-day. The
men who are now occupying the
house are G. D. Atterbury, '05, T.
Van Sickle, '05, A. B. Saunders,'os,
E. E. Miller, '05, F. 0. Shutts, '06,
and P. M. Davis, '08. Next fall
the new fraternity expects to build
or lease a house on the campus.
Four chapters of the new frater
nity have been established, with
the pioneer society at Michigan
and the second at Stanford. The
remaining two have recently been
installed at the State universities
of Nebraska and Kansa√ü. Four
teen other colleges and universities
have applied for charters. Wis
consin has applied for a charter,
and as soon as the society is in
stalled there a national organiza
tion will be formed.
