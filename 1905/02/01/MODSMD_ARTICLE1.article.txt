# NOTED MEN AT ASSEMBLY.
## President Wheeler and Judge Morrow Speak to Large Number of Students. 
### 
The third University Assembly
of the present semester was held at
the fourth hour this morning. De
spite the unpleasant weather a large
number of students and faculty
members were present to listen to
the addresses. President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the University of
California and Judge W. W. Mor
row of the United Stales Circuit
Court were the speakers. President
Wheeler said, in part:
"One of the noblest sentiments
that has inspired and uplifted mod
ern life is contained in the enthusi
asm of college loyalty. But college
loyalty goeth not always out by
mechanical shouting. College ath
letics has purified and virilized the
youth of the land, and brought
much good health and confidence
of strength to many, but its purpose
is served only in proportion to the
number participating, for there is
no mystical communication of the
blessings to those 'who only sit and
wait.' The rather is it to be
feared that when the few toil and
the many sit, monsters of profes
sionalism, and not healthy men,
shall be the output of our athletic
fields, and a monster cult of athleti
cism, the worship of Dagon of the
Philistines, grow up among us to
oppress the chosen people. Then
may it be that one or another of
these Samsons, bondaged to make
sport for the Philistines, may grope
to the pillars of the temple and bow
himself with all his might, that the
house fall and make speedy end of
Dagon and Philistines, their lords,
and coaches, and trainers, and rub
bers, their bleachers, and their gate
receipts. This calling for Samson
that he may make sport for us is
pretty poor use to make of a college
man.
"But I fear I have carried my
illustrations too far, and that the
story of my parables may obscure
their doctrine. 1 am not here to
talk about athletics, nor yet about
alimentation, or the mechanics of
hoisting; I want to point the differ
ence between a poor vise to make of
a man, and a good use to make of a
man. And thou art the man! You
are a man of one life. That life con
stitutes one high opportunity. Will
you shape its use for the machine
you are, or for the free spirit that
you are? Will you use it for ex
ploitation of the chemistry and
physics that is in you, or for ex
ploitation of the eternity that is in
you."
Judge Morrow, who followed
President Wheeler, had some inter
esting things to say about the inter
national struggle for commercial
supremacy on the Pacific. His
manner of speaking was vigorous.
His remarks, in part, were as fol
lows:
"Commerce at present is one of
the livest subjects in the world, and
in the future it promises to become
even more live. And every man
and woman in the country is inter
ested in the subject, for wherever
commerce is great art and letters
flourish.
"At Washington there was re

cently established a Department of
Commerce and Labor with a Cali
fornian at its head who recognizes
that the future center of commerce
will be on the Pacific. It is now
planned to furnish each of our for
eign embassies with a commercial
attache, who will study the trade
methods of the country where he is
stationed. This move is an indica
tion of that great war for commer
cial supremacy which will be waged
from this time on.
"Soon Russia and Japan will be
only commercial rivals, and with
the 'open door' China will become
one of the great trading nations of
the world. In secure possession of
the Philippines and Hawaii, we
have permanent bases for commer
cial enterprises in the Orient, and
through the Panama canal will
flow the commerce of the West.
"Men of intelligence are needed
to handle great commercial enter
prises, and the graduates of the
California universities will provide
the material for establishing that
commercial supremacy which is
the most important affair now be
fore this countrv."
