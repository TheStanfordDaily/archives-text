The action of the Faculty in
limiting the projected trips of the
Musical Clubs will meet with the
approval of a large proportion of
the student body. These musical
organizations have fallen very
much in the estimation of the stu
dents, and the reasons are not diffi
cult to find. A year ago the clubs
were granted permission by the
Executive Committee to make a
Northern tour, provided each man
put up a cash deposit of twenty
dollars and a note for five dollars
more to cover any deficit. Not a
single note was given, which was a
breach of faith, subsequently dis
covered by the Executive Commit
tee. Many of the incidents of the
trip, from trustworthy accounts,
were not at all a good advertise
ment for the university the men
represented. Finally the clubs
came home, crushed under a load
of debt; and it is a fact that the
Executive Committee, before it got
through straightening out the
affairs of the organizations, consid
ered leaving official recommenda
tion to the succeeding Executive
Committee that the clubs should
not be allowed to make an outside
trip this year.
There is another reason why the
Musical Clubs do not stand well
with the college public. The or
ganizations are supported by the
student body, but the student body
fails to see that it gets a great deal
in return. It used to be that the
Glee Club sang at the University
assemblies. Then it came to be
announced that they would sing,
but usually they did not. Then
they dropped out of sight, and now
they are rarely heard, although the
public is kept aware of their exist
ence by items for music appearing
in the monthly reports of the stu
dent body Treasurer. The princi
pal utility of the student body to
the Musical Clubs seems to be that
it pays their bills and backs them

financially when they desire to take
a Christmas vacation trip.
There is no good reason whj T the
situation should be as it is. There
are good, strong men in the clubs
who, if they exert their influence,
can make the organizations well
worth while. Among the eight or
nine hundred men in the Univer
sity there must surely be enough
with good voices or able to play
instruments sufficiently well to
form much more creditable clubs.
When the organizations develop a
better sense of responsibility and
make the students who pay their
bills feel that they are something
more than private clubs, then they
will find the student body behind
them, undivided. Unless they do
that, there seems to be no just rea
son why the student body should
continue to give them support.
