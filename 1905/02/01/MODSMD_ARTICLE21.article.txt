â€”Lawrence University has taken
$100 in settlement of the bequest of
$100,000 provided in the will of
William \V. Cooper, who lost his
life in the Iroquois Theatre fire in
Chicago. The trustees refused the
bequest because the testator died in
a theatre, and the Methodist church
does not approve of theatres.
