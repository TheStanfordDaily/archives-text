# TENNIS TRY-OUTS ANNOUNCED.
## Intercollegiate Tennis Team Will Be Chosen on Washington's Birthday. 
### 
Announcement has been made
by G. A. Hodge, Varsity tennis
captain, that the try-outs to pick
the men who will represent Stan
ford in this year's tennis match
will begin on February 22d. The
announcement is accompanied by
an appeal to all men who intend
trying out for Varsity positions
this year to put themselves in prac
tice at once, so that the try-out
may not fail to bring out the best
team that can be developed in col
lege.
J.n spite of the difficulty in hold
ing the try-out so early in the year
owing to the rainy weather that is
sure to be encountered, the chances
of a victory over California this
year will be greatly increased by
the opportunities which the team,
one chosen, will gain in the addi
tional time remaining for practice.
During the past few years Varsity
tennis teams have been chosen so
shortly before the intercollegiate
match that almost no time was al
lowed them for practice, and the
large number of defeats that have
been experienced are to a great ex
tent due to the fact that Califor
nia's teams have not had to com
bat with this handicap. During
March and the early part of April
the team will be given the oppor
tunity of practicing with the best
players in San Francisco and about
the bay.
The try-out will be held along
the same lines as that of last year.
If the weather permits, the singles
try-out will be started on Wash
ington's birthday. It will consist
of two separate tournaments, the
winners of each joining in around
robin tournament with Captain
Hodge to select the two singles
representatives. As a former Var
sity player, Hodge is not required
to participate in the preliminaries.
As soon as these tournaments can
be completed, a straight doubles
tournament will be held to pick the
doubles team.
