# Final Game Postponed.
## 
### 
The continued rain has necessi
tated the postponement of the final
interclass baseball game to Friday
afternoon. The Juniors will meet
the Sophomores, each having been
victorious in their previous con
test.
Coach Cowden has been unable
to devote much time to the Varsity
men this week owing to the class
games. After the match yesterday
a number of the players were given
some batting practice. The second
Varsity game will be with St.
Mary's on Saturday, and it is the
intention of the coach to play more
men than were used in the contest
with Santa Clara last week.
