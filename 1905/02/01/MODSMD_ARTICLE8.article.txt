The management of the '06 Quad
is contemplating the introduction
of a new plan which has been tried
very successfully in the year-bookß
of several Eastern colleges. In
order to have some basis for calcu
lation of the number of copies that
will be sold, those in charge of
some of the annuals have an
nounced that all persons who agree
to purchase a copy at some given
time before the appearance of the
book may have their name stamped
upon the cover in a position and
color in keeping with the cover
design and the general appearance
of the binding. In some cases an
additional nominal fee is charged
for the cost of the extra engraving.
This plan originated with the
Michiganesian, the annual got out
by the University of Michigan.
The success of the plan has been so
marked where it has been tried and
its advantages are so manifest that
it is probable that it will be adopt
ed by the editors of the Quad.
