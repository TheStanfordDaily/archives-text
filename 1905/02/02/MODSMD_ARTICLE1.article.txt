# CARNOT DEBATE TO-MORROW.
## Speaking Will Commence in Assembly Hall Promptly at Eight O'Clock. 
### 
To-morrow night in Assembly
Hall teams representing Stanford
and the University of California
will meet in the eleventh annual
contest for the possession of the
Carnot medal. At 8 o'clock
promptly the first speaker will take
the floor for the opening argument.
The Carnot medal is annually
awarded to one of the six contest
ants representing the two universi
ties who shows the greatest ability
in debate. The trophy was award
ed by Baron de Coubertin in honor
of Sadi-Carnot, former President of
France, with the provision that
the subjects for discussion must al
ways refer to some plan or policy
for the government of France. This
debate was formerly conducted on
the same plan as all regular de
bates, both Bides being thoroughly
prepared on a definite subject and
team work being introduced. This
system was, however, changed by
the intercollegiate faculty commit
tee to cultivate, if possible, a more
extemporaneous style of speaking,
and to make the contest clearly an
individual one. To this end only
a general field for study is now an
nounced and the definite subject is
not announced until two hours be
fore the debate.
"The Relation of Church and
State in France since 1801," is the
general field upon which the de
baters have been studying since
the middle of October. In the try
out at which the Stanford team
was chosen two weeks ago the sub
ject discussed was: "Resolved, That
the action of the French Govern
ment in closing the Catholic schools
is prejudicial to the educational
welfare of the French Republic."
The Stanford team chosen this
year is unusually strong in deliv
ery and extemporaneous work and
they will be on home ground.
Alexander Sherriffs, '05, D. D.
Sales, '06, and R. G. Barnett, '05,
constitute the team, with A. R.
Fletcher, '05, as alternate. Sher
riffs is the veteran debater. He
was a member of the 1905 Fresh
man team, and in his sophomore
year was chosen to represent Stan
ford on the second team, which de
bated the University of Washing
ton. Last year he took part in
both intercollegiate contests. Salee
is a speaker of much force and per
suasion. He was a member of last
year's Sophomore team. Barnett
is perhaps not as strong in presen
tation of his subject as the other
two men, but what he lacks here
he more than compensates for by
his logical method of handling an
argument. Although he has never
served on a Varsity or class team,
he has secured thorough training
by continual practice in debating.
E. C. Baker, M. E. Harrison, and
W.J.Musgrove speak for California.
Professor Louis Lisser of San
Francisco, Rev. W. G. Stone of
Oakland, and President M. E.
Dailey of the San Jose Normal
School will act as judges. Each
debater will be allowed fifteen min
utes in which to present two
speeches, the only provision being

that no speech shall be less than
four minutes in duration.
The California rooters will come
down on a special train. The Stan

ford yell-leaders desire that all
Stanford partisans shall gather on
the right side of Assembly Hall by
7:15 o'clock.
