To-morrow night the Carnot de
bate will be held in Assembly Hall.
Stanford has not won this debate
since 1902, when Fletcher Wagner
captured the much coveted prize.
This year our chances seem to be
brighter than usual. We have on
our team one man who is a veteran
of past intercollegiate contests, and
two others whose work has at
tracted very favorable notice. Cali
fornia's representatives are all new
men, and one of them is a fresh
man. The advantage of experience
would seem to lie upon our side.
In return for the efforts which the
debaters will put forth for the honor
of their college to-morrow, the stu
dents owe it to them to give their
heartiest support. The best way to
do this is to turn out in force and
make the men feel that the whole
college is back of them. California
is going to send down a large dele
gation of "rooters" to give confi
dence to the men who will represent
the Blue and Gold. Stanford ought
not to be outdone. As to the de
bate, may the best man win, and
may that man be a Stanford man.
