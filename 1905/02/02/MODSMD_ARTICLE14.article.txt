# Making Zoological Terms.

### 
Dr. Jordan continued his series
of lectures on nomenclature in
botany and zoology last night.
The lecture was concerned chiefly
with the formation of zoological
terms, and a large number of rules
were stated and illustrated for the
various processes through which the
words go after the Greek deriva
tives have been settled upon. Zoo
logical terms are formed on the
basis of the original derivative
Greek noun, to which, before it is
ready for transposition into Latin,
numerous adjectives, prefixes and
suffixes are added. In this way
many terms often assume unwieldy
proportions, and if this is carried
too far, for convenience's sake it is
often necessary to choose a new and
shorter generic term.
