# Something About Creatore.
## 
### 
The Italian Band, which will ap
pear in Assembly Hall on Monday
•vening,February 6th, is a full band
of fifty instruments, and is accom
panied by Mme. Barili, soprano,
and Signor Sodero, harp soloist.
The band is under the direction of
Signor Guiseppe Creatore, who is
probably the most original con
ductor in the country. Although
his manner of conducting almost
verges on the sensational, most
musicians are agreed that the re
sults which he obtains justify the
means. His personal control of
the players is remarkable, and he
seems to be able to make them do
just what he desires by sheer force
of personal magnetism. In addi
tion he has a remarkably fine feel
ing for the finer points of interpre
tation, and the result is that he
often arouses the emotions of the
audience to a high pitch. In some
respects he is to be compared to the
great pianist, Pachman, whose ges
tures and facial expression, and
sometimes even spoken words, aid
in producing just the desired im
pression. All in all, Creatore is a
most interesting man. The soloists,
Mme. Barili and Signor Sodero, are
both thoroughly trained and skill
ful artists, and the concert should
be a most enjoyable one. Creatore
is very liberal with encores, for
which he always plays selections
of a lighter nature. The program
will be published in to-morrow
night's issue.
