Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Daily Palo Alto, in its
issue of Wednesday, February 1,
1905, printed an editorial attacking
the Musical Clubs of the Univer
sity. This article is the second of
its kind to be printed in this paper
within the last six months, and is
so decidedly uncalled for, unjust,
and in many particulars so abso
lutely false that an answer, stating
the circumstances in their true
light, has been deemed advieable.
In the first place, a trip was
talked of to start on February 21,
1905, and end on February 25,
1905. The clubs referred the mat
ter to the Committee on Student
Body Affairs, and were informed
that no organization of Stanford
students would be allowed to leave
the campus and be absent during
any session, and that all trips of
any organization whatever must be
limited to the time of vacation.
This decree did not apply to the
Musical Clubs because of any dis
approval of their actions, but ap
plied to every college organization.
When the Northern trip was ar
ranged in 1903 the members of the
clubs were notified to deposit the
sum of twenty dollars with the stu
dent body manager, and this
money was deposited by each man
before the clubs left the University
on December 18, 1903. The mem
bers of the clubs were never called
upon to sign any notes and are
therefore wrongly accused of
"breach of faith."
The total debt of the combined
clubs at the present time is $229.72,
and this is the enormous debt
under which we staggered home.
We invite the editor to compare
this debt with the debt of other
organizations in college. The clubs
give a concert yearly on the cam
pus, and heretofore have cleared
about $275. As it is our intention
to give a concert in Assembly Hall
this year our tremendous load of
debt will soon vanish.
The Executive Committee this
year decided to grant the clubs a
trip, and arrangements had been
completed for the departure of an
advance agent, when the clubs, of
their own free will and at their own
suggestion, decided not to take any
trip when there was the slightest
danger of a deficit, but to remain
at home, take several short trips
to San Jose, San Mateo, Belmont,
etc., and use the receipts of these
and their campus concert to pay
off our last year's deficit. Another
instance of our "bad faith.''
The Glee Club has repeatedly
offered to sing at assemblies if a
piano was provided, but up to the
present no such provision has been
made. It is true that there is a
piano in the hall, but the clubs are
forbidden the use of it, it being re
served for professionals.
The editor makes the assertion
that there must be a great many
good voices in college and a great
many men who play instruments.
If he will kindly let us know their
names he will confer a great favor
upon the management of the clubs,
as our greatest trouble this year
has been from lack of material.
And again, such articles as the one
printed on Wednesday do not tend
to bring out material or encourage
men to try for the clubs.
It has become quite a fad with
the editors of the Daily Palo Alto
to make periodical attacks on the
Musical Clubs, either because of
lack of other material or through a

desire to injure these organizations
as much as possible. The clubs
admit that they have not appeared
in public as often as they might,
but they have usually had very
good reasons, and it would be wise
for the author of Wednesday's arti
cle to learn more of the inner
workings before he makes his at
tacks.
Last fall the clubs decided not to
answer the article printed in this
paper, but patience has ceased to
be a virtue, and the accusations in
the last article are so unfounded
that we deem it wise to state our
side of the case.

at home, take several short trips
to San Jose, San Mateo, Belmont,
etc., and use the receipts of these
and their campus concert to pay
off our last year's deficit. Another
instance of our "bad faith.''
The Glee Club has repeatedly
offered to sing at assemblies if a
piano was provided, but up to the
present no such provision has been
made. It is true that there is a
piano in the hall, but the clubs are
forbidden the use of it, it being re
served for professionals.
The editor makes the assertion
that there must be a great many
good voices in college and a great
many men who play instruments.
If he will kindly let us know their
names he will confer a great favor
upon the management of the clubs,
as our greatest trouble this year
has been from lack of material.
And again, such articles as the one
printed on Wednesday do not tend
to bring out material or encourage
men to try for the clubs.
It has become quite a fad with
the editors of the Daily Palo Alto
to make periodical attacks on the
Musical Clubs, either because of
lack of other material or through a

desire to injure these organizations
as much as possible. The clubs
admit that they have not appeared
in public as often as they might,
but they have usually had very
good reasons, and it would be wise
for the author of Wednesday's arti
cle to learn more of the inner
workings before he makes his at
tacks.
Last fall the clubs decided not to
answer the article printed in this
paper, but patience has ceased to
be a virtue, and the accusations in
the last article are so unfounded
that we deem it wise to state our
side of the case.
