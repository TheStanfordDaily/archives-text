The prize story and poem com

will close according to schedule to
morrow, and all manuscripts must
be in by that time in order to re
ceive consideration from the judges
of the contests. Although com
paratively few stories and poems
have been handed in up to this
time, the judges will have a large
number to choose from, as all liter
ary work b\ r Stanford undergradu
ates that has appeared during the
past year in Stanford publications
will be open to selection.
Miss Gertrude M. Henry, '05,
who won the prize for the beststory

well-known story-writers who did
good work in the same competition.
Last year no prize was awarded in
the poetry contest, but a poem by
Miss Irmagarde Richards, '02, was
published in the '05 Quad.
