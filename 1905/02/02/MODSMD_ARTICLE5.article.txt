# Paper to Go to High School.
## 
### 
At the regular meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee held last night
Treasurer Barrett's monthly report
was accepted. The new intercol
legiate agreement was not discussed
last night, but was laid on the table
until the members of the committee
have carefully read it. Within
thirty days it will come up before
the committee for final considera
tion. The committee also decided
to send the Daily Palo Alto to the
principal high schools of the State
during the last three months of the
present semester.
