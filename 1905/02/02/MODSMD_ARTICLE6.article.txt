# Crews Work on Lagunita.
## 
### 
For the first time this season, the
boating men engaged in practice on
Lagunita this afternoon. Owing to
the fact that only one boat, the
four-oared barge, is ready for use,
only a part of the men could work
on the lake. Two crews of old men
and one crew of Freshmen were
given light work in the boat. The
rest of the candidates continued
their work at the gymnasium.
From this time on regular practice
will take place on the lake every
afternoon. The coaching will be
done by Professor W. F. Durand,
assisted by R. H. Gaither, '05.
