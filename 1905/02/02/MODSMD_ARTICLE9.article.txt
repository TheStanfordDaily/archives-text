The new library building is
rapidly passing the point when a
cornerstone may be laid. This
structure is the personal gift of the
surviving founder to the men and
women of the University. It would
seem highly appropriate, therefore,
for the officers of the student body
to prepare a program of dedication
upon their own account and sub
mit it to Mrs. Stanford for her ap
proval. It is not often that the
Btudents of the University have an
opportunity to pay a tribute to the
the venerable woman who has given
them so much, and it would be a
sincere pleasure to receive formally
from her hands this new evidence
of her generosity and affection.
