PRESIDENT Suspenders are easy In
every way—every day ; at work or
ut play. The patent adjustment at their
back slides arid glides with every move
ment of the body. Lightens the weight
on the shoulders; relieves the strain on
buttons and back; gives a trouser sup
port that's simply delightful.
PRESIDENT
Suspenders
will stand more hard wear, look better and
feel better than any augpender a man can
wear. That's why 2,000,000 men are con
stantly wearing them. Satisfaction or
money back Is our absolute guarantee,
l'rlce 60c and $1.00 every store everywhere,
or mailed postpaid.
