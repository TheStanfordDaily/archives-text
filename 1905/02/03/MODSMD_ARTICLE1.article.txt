# TENNIS WOMEN'S PLANS.
## Final Open Tournament Will Be Held on the Roble Courts on February 25th. 
### 
Serious work among the girls'
tennis squad members will begin
with the first of next week, if the
present plans of the captain and
manager hold good. February 25th
is the date set for the final open
tournament, the winners of which
will play for places on the team.
There is a quantity of new and un
developed material among the
women players, and it is the aim of
those in charge to find out just
what can be counted on. The tour
nament will be held on the Roble
courts at 9 o'clock, and will be
open to all. An entry fee will be
charged those who take part in the
tournament in order to defray the
expenses of the tournament. The
final winners of these preliminary
matches will play Miss Pitman,
'05, and Miss Owen, '07, who, be
cause of their positions on last
year's team, will not enter the pre
liminary games.
A match between the winners of
this set will be played to decide
who is eligible to challenge Miss
Ray for the championship. In or
der to devote more time to those
who will meet the women from
California, it has been decided to
present the winner in this tourna
ment with the silver cup which was
purchased by the Women's Ath
letic Association. The large cup,
which has up to this time been kept
in the Roble gymnasium, will re
main there, and, as heretofore, the
name of the champion will be in
scribed thereon. On the first Sat
urday in March there will be a
doubles tournament, the winners in
that case to play Miss Pitman and
Miss Ray, who represented Stan
ford in the doubles last year.
During the past week a commu
nication has been received by the
manager from California requesting
that the intercollegiate game be
played on the date and at the place
of the second baseball game. If
this suggestion is acted upon favor
ably, the game will be played on
the Stanford courts on the morning
of April 9th.
Although the final try-out for
the California team has not yet
been held, it is more than probable
that the places will fall to the same
players who appeared last year.
In that case the California team
will prove a strong one, as Miss
Miriam Edwards, who played
against Miss Owen, '07, last year,
now holds the championship of
California, having defeated Miss
Ethel Iladcliffe, the former cham
pion. Both Miss Radcliffe and
Miss Gladys Wickson, who played
against Miss Pitman last spring,
are cool, clever players, and will
doubtless prove formidable oppo
nents. The two moat promising
rivals for places on the California
team are Miss Hazel Hotchkiss and
Miss Marian Craig, freshmen at
Berkeley, but the experience of last
year's players points to their re
appearance.
At present little can be said re
garding the outlook for the Stan
ford team. Miss Ray, the captain,
will almost unquestionably hold

her place and title to the cham
pionship, but the result of the final
tournament must be awaited before
the other members can be sure of
their places.
