# ST. MARY'S VS. STANFORD.
## First of a Series of Three Games Will Be Played on the Campus To-morrow. 
### 
The Varsity will play the base
ball team of St. Mary's College to
morrow at 3 on the campus dia
mond. This will be the first of a
series of three games to be played
with this nine. St. Mary's cap
tured the series last season, winning
the first two of the three games
played by the scores of 9 to 4 and
4to 5. The Varsity won the last
game, 5 to 2.
The members of the Oakland
team had a game scheduled with
California for last Thursday, but it
was prevented by rain, so the con
test to-morrow will be their first
game of the season. The majority
of the members of the nine are the
same men who were seen in the
game last year. Ferguson made a
fine showing in the games he
pitched on the campus last spring,
and will be in the box again for the
visitors. Catcher Poultney of the
St. Mary's team, who had his leg
badly broken in the game with
California that waß played here
last March, will play with his
teammates again to-morrow.
Stanford has had very little
chance to practice during the last
week, due to the interclass games
and the bad weather. Most of the
practice has been at batting, the
department of the game in which
the team is weakest. Cowden will
use several pitchers in to-morrow's
game, as he did in the contest with
Santa Clara.
The line-up follows:
St. Mary's — Ferguson, pitcher;
Ryan, catcher or center field; Bra
dy, first base; Haley, second base;
Waters, third base; Halloran,short
stop; Rooney, left field; Poultney,
