The Daily Palo Alto printed
last night a communication from
the Musical Clubs in answer to an
editorial published in Wednesday's
issue. The Musical Clubs state
that the editorial was " decidedly
uncalled for, unjust, and in many
particulars absolutely false." We
will take up their reasons for this
sweeping assertion, one by one.
The restriction of outside trips,
say the Musical Clubs, was not
made for their special benefit, but
"applied to every college organiza
tion.'' The Daily Palo Alto did
not affirm that the rule was made
for special application to the Musi
cal Clubs, whatever views it may
hold upon that point. But we call
the attention of the Musical Clubs
to the fact that as short a time ago
as November the Faculty permitted
a football team to be absent during
several days of University work for
a trip to Colorado. And we call
their attention to the further fact
that on Thursday, March 23, 1905,
a track team will leave the Uni
versity to travel to Pomona for a
meet there on the following Satur
day. From these facts the man
who reads may draw his own con
clusions.
The Musical Clubs say they were
never called upon to sign any notes.
As first submitted, their communi
cation declared that "no notes were
required or even mentioned, and
the first information to that effect
appeared in the Daily Palo Alto's
editorial last fall." We do not
know whether or not the student
body manager of that day de
manded the notes, but it is remark
able that the clubs should be ignor
ant of the fact that the notes were
required by the Executive Com
mittee as a prime condition of the
permission granted the clubs to
make the trip. A leading member
of the organizations—a man whose
name is signed to yesterday's com

munication —was then a member
of the Executive Committee of the
student body, thoroughly under
stood the note requirement, strong
ly opposed it, and was the only
man to vote against it. Then the
requirements of the Executive Com
mittee were printed in very plain
words and figures in the Daily
Palo Alto of November 5, 1903,
first page, third column. Here,
then, are two excellent sources
from which it is reasonable to be
lieve a majority at least of the
members of the clubs must have
learned the facts. Knowing them,
did they treat the student body
fairly?
"The total debt of the combined
clubs at the present time is
$229.72," say the Musical Clubs,
"and this is the enormous debt un
der which we staggered home." It
may be quite true that the debt of
the clubs at the present time is
$229.72. But we must take excep
tion to the second part of the state
ment. Upon the return from the
trip the student body manager
stated that the deficit would be in
the neighborhood of one thousand
dollars, an excess over the personal
deposits of the men by some five
hundred dollars. This is a pretty
steep debt for a minor college or
ganization, and we submit that if
the Musical Clubs did not feel
crushed by it, the general body of
students did.
The suggested comparison of the
present debt of $229.72 with the
debts of other organizations does
not seem to help the Musical Clubs
to any noticeable degree. Foot
ball is the backbone of the student
body finances. Baseball and track
generally pay their way. . The
Boating Club is struggling along
heroically and asking nothing from
the student body beyond recog
nition. The Tennis Club has had
some money for courts, but its
members pay even for the balls
used in tournaments. These courts
too are open to the whole Univer
sity. A portion of the debts of the
Band, which are never in the form
of deficits, are cheerfully paid by
the student body, because the Band
is a useful organization and gives
full value in return for all that is
done for it. The Orchestra gets
not a cent frcm the student body
treasury, nor do the women's mu
sical organizations. What, now,
does the comparison show?
That the clubs decided to stay at
home this year is very much to
their credit. They recognized their
own weakness better than did the
Executive Committee which gave
them permission to go, and they
were conscientious enough not to
desire to add to the deficit already

a year old. Great praise is due
them for their sensible view of the
situation.
The Daily Palo Alto suggested
that among the eight or nine hun
dred men in college there must be
the makings of thoroughly repre
sentative clubs. However disap
pointed we may be, we must of
course accept the assurance of the
executive committee of the clubs
that this material does not exist.
The lack of a piano should not
be a very serious handicap to the
presence of the Glee Club at assem
blies. They have sung without it
on occasion, and they have not gone
without applause. An assembly
audience is not a critical concert
audience, and it is quite willing to
forego some of the concert frills.
Does the lack of a piano keep away
the Mandolin Club, too?
11 The clubs admit that they have
not appeared in public as often as
they might, but they have usually
had very good reasons." Here in
deed is a frank admission of one
of the great faults complained of
by the Daily Palo Alto, and the
regret is that the clubs did not see
fit - to state more explicitly their
good reasons.
