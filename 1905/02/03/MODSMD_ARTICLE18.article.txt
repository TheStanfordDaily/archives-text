# In Memory of Mrs. C.B. Wing.

The Executive Committee begs
leave to express the grief of the
Stanford students for the sorrow
which has fallen upon Professor
Wing and his family. Words and
formal resolutions are, indeed, but
idle sounds to the ear of such a
grief, yet we cannot but make some
expression of our sympathy for our
honored professor and his little ones
in their affliction through the
death of beloved wife and mother.
