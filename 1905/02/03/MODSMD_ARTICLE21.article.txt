# TO ENTER P.A.A. TRY-OUTS.
## Several Stanford Track Men Will Take Fart in the Coming Meet. 
### 
As soon as the weather settles
the second try-out for the purpose
of selecting track men to compete
at the Lewis and Clark Exposition
games will be held under the aus
pices of the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation. The first of these try-outs
was a handicap meet held on the
University of California oval last
fall. The four Stanford men, en
tered in that meet won three firsts
and one second place. Three more
field-days will be held, but the
team will not be picked until after
the last one. The fourth contest
will be the real try-out, the meets
which precede it being held merely
to stimulate interest and bring out
new men. For this reason these
preliminary meets will be handi
cap affairs.
At the next Pacific Athletic As
sociation meet a number of Stan
ford track men who are ineligible
for participation in the annual in
tercollegiate field-day will compete,
and if the date does not conflict
with the Varsity schedule, several
members of the regular track
team will also enter. Among the
men who are practically certain to
enter the try-outs are N. E. Dole,
'04, F. S. Holman, '05, and O. E.
Hyde, '05, all of whom are de
barred from participation in the
intercollegiate meet by the four
year rule. If a Varsity field-day
is not held on the date of the next
try-out, H. W. 8e11,'05, E. C. Cope,
'08, and J. O. Miller, '08, will also
be among the competitors.
The games to be held at Port
land this summer will be for the
championship of the Pacific Coast,
and they will be conducted after
the manner of the Olympian sports
held at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition last year.
