# Track Trials To-morrow.
## 
### 
No regular field-day will be held
to-morrow, but a number of try
outs for various events will take
place in the morning. As only a
small section of the track can be
used, most of the trials will be for
the short distances. If the run
ways are not too soft, some pole
vaulting and high jumping trials
will also be held.
