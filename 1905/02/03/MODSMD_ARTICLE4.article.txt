# Gymnasium Club Officers.
## 
### 
The Stanford Gymnasium Club
met last night. Owing to the resig
nation of N. E. Dole, '04, president,
and F. P. Whitaker, '05, secretary,
a re-election of officers was held.
P. E. Millar, '06, was elected presi
dent, and E. V. Henley, '06, secre
tary.
It was decided to hold the annual
Gymnasium Club exhibition about
the middle of March, but no defi
nite arrangements concerning the
exhibition were made.
