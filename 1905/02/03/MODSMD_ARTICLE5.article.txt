# Still Favor Graduate Coaches.
## 
### 
The executive committee of the
University of California met Tues
day and discussed the intercollegi
ate agreement made in San Fran
cisco Saturday. As a result of the
contention of some members that
the graduate coach system should
not be abolished, no action was
taken on the agreement. The mat
ter will come up again at the next
meeting of the committee.
