# STORY OF THE CARNOT DEBATE.
## Summary of the Arguments Presented in the Intercollegiate Contest. 
### 
At six o'clock on Friday evening
the contestants for the Carnot
medal were given the following sub
ject on which they were to speak
two hours later: "Resolved, That
the policy of the late Combes Min
istry in respect to the relations of
church and state was wise." R. G.
Barnett, '05, and A. Sherriffs, '05,
of Stanford, with E. C. Baker, '05,
and VV. J. Musgrove, '05, of Cali
fornia chose to advocate the af
firmative, while D. D. Sales, '06, of
Stanford, and M. E. Harrison, '08,
of California, defended the negative.
The general quality of all speeches
was excellent, and Stanford's rep
resentatives all did better than
their opponents. President M. E.
Dailey of the San Jose Normal
School, Professor Louis Lisser of
San Francisco, and Rev. G. \V.
Stone of Oakland judged the con
test, and they awarded the medal to
Sherriffs by unanimous decision on
the first ballot.
R. G. Earnettof Stanford opened
the debate for the affirmative by
briefly defining the field for argu
ment. He held that there were
but three relations in which church
and state could exist, and then set
out to show that the policy which
Combes advocated for the regula
tion :of these two institutions was
the only practical one.
E. C. Baker of California fol
lowed, also Bpeaking for the af
firmative. He said Combes' policy
was the abrogation of the concordat
of 1801 and secularization of the
schools. He then dealt with each
of these measures separately and
attempted to justify them. Baker
had good, strong argument, but his
delivery was listless and ineffective.
M. E. Harrison, the California
freshman, who made the first speech
for the negative, was easily the
best of the California trio. He
argued that the policy under dis
cussion was unwise because there
could be no effective separation
while conditions remain as they
are now in France; secondly, be
cause Combes attempted to subor
dinate the church to the state rath
er that separate it from the state;
and lastly, because such a measure
tended to antagonize the church.
Harrison is a very forceful speaker
and drives his arguments home by
summarizing opportunely.
\V. J. Musgrove, the last Califor
nia man speaking on the affirma
tive, dealt entirely with the educa
tional measures advocated by the
Ministry of M. Combes. Musgrove's
speech was in no way strong, his
delivery and argument alike being
weak.
A. Sherriffs followed with a pow
erful argument upholding the pol
icy under discussion.
D. D. Sales, in closing for the
negative, presented a new argument
not advanced before by any of the
other speakers. By analyzing the
make-up of Combes' Ministry he at
tempted to show that such men as
■were making these laws were
neither fit nor competent to under
take such a serious task. This
argument was strongly assailed by

the affirmative in rebuttal. Sales'
strong point was his convincing
personality and delivery.
In rebuttal all the speakers sum
marized their previous arguments
and attacked some of the points
advanced by their opponents. Bar
nett made an excellent impression
by his effective rebuttal work, and
Baker of California did much bet
ter than in his first speech. Sher
riffs clinched his chance for win
ning by the logical manner in
which he recapitulated his former
argument# and the concise manner
in which he refuted the contentions
of the negative.
