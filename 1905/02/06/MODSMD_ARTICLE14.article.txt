After an absence of two years
at the University of California, the
Carnot medal came back to Stan
ford University Friday night. The
victory of the Stanford man who
won it was clean-cut and decisive,
and while expected, the success of
Alexander Sherriffs was made es
pecially gratifying by the speedy
and unanimous verdict of the
judges in his favor. There is this,
too, to be said: had we not had
Sherriffs, we still had two other
men who might well have been
awarded the medal with honor and
credit to its donor and to the men
who have won it in years gone by.
We had the best balanced team
that has represented Stanford in
some years, each man strong in
many points and weak in none.
To Alexander Sherriffs, to Dudley
D. Sales and to Raymond G. Bar
nett the congratulations of the stu
dent body Are due, and they are
heartily given.
