# VICTORY FOR STANFORD GIRLS
## San Jose Normal School Defeated at Basket-ball by Score of 10 to 5. 
### 
The basket-ball game with the j
San June Normal team was played
on Saturday before a number of
enthusiastic spectators. Although
the game resulted in a victory for
the Stanford team by the score of
10 to 5, there were many points in
which the work of the team can be
improved. Miss Emma Hayward,
'06, at forward, played the most
consistent game for the home team,
as seven out of the ten points to
Stanford's credit were made by her.
The work of the guards was
weak, especially in the latter part
of the game, when it was quite evi
dent that they felt that their task
was too easy. The forwards seemed
unable to force openings, and when
they did they failed to follow up
the advantage which they had
gained. The most disappointing
feature of the play was the inexcus
able fumbling of the Stanford team.
Of the new material which has ap
peared Miss E. Buckingham, '08,
is the most promising. She is
quick, active, and followß the ball
closely.
The line-up was as follows:
