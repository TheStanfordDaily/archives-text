The second field-day of the sea
son will be held Saturday morning.
On that date the classes of '05 and
'07 will combine in an effort to de
feat the track athletes of '06 and
'08. If the result of the inter
department meet can be taken as a
reliable criterion, the proposed
field-day ought to be close and ex
citing. A comparison of records
shows that neither combination has
a decided advantage over the other.
The track was not in shape for
the trials which were to have been
run Saturday, and the time was
employed in starting the men.
Some good records were made in
pole-vaulting, among them a vault
of 10 feet 10 inches by F. R. Lana
