# ST. MARY'S DEFEATS STANFORD
## Winning Runs Made in the Ninth Inning.—Many Men Play for the Cardinal. 
### 
St. Mary's College won the base
ball game Saturday afternoon in
the ninth inning, when, with the
score 2 to 0 against them, they suc
ceeded in getting three runs. The
contest was close throughout, but
Stanford scored twice in the seventh
inning and seemed to be the winner
up to the unexpected rally of the
visitors in the ninth. Haley, the
first man up for St. Mary's in the
ninth, hit safely and stole second
and third. Ryan reached first
base on balls. Poultney hit to
Bell, who fumbled the ball, Haley
scoring. On a hit-by Waters, both
Ryan and Poultney scored. Stan
ford's runs were made in the seventh
inning, by Cadwalader and Rook
on a hit, a base on balls, and
two errors.
During the early part of the
game neither team was able to
score, Sales and Ferguson pitching
effective ball and their teams giv
ing them excellent support. Sales
pitched the first five innings for
Stanford and allowed only three
scattered hits. Rook pitched the
next two innings and struck out
most of his opponents with a puz
zling slow ball. He was followed
in the box by Menardi, who al
lowed three hits, but the poor sup
port given him was partly respon
sible for the runs made by St.
Mary's.
The Varsity played much better
ball than they did against Santa
Clara last week, the hitting of the
men being noticeably better. Fen
ton, Sales, and Chalmers hit safely.
Three errors were made during the
game, the last two proving costly
and letting in runs. Cowden con
tinued his policy of trying a num
ber of men in the different positions,
and it was practically a new team
that played the last four innings of
the game. Two new men Frink,
and Bell, were tried at second base,
Presley and Lewis, who played this
position in the Santa Clara game,
being moved into the outfield.
The line-up follows: Stanford —
Sales, Rook, Menardi, pitcher;
Stott, Daily, catcher; Colbert, first
base; Frink, Bell, second base;
Fenton, third base; Trowbridge,
short-stop; Chalmers, left field;
Cadwalader, Presley, center field;
Dudley, Lewis, right field.
St. Mary's—Ferguson, pitcher;
Ryan, catcher; Brady, first base;
Haley, second base; Waters, third
base; Halloran, short-stop; Rooney,
left field; Poultney, center field;
Henno, right field. Umpire, Mc-
Fadden.
