Rev.D. Charles Gardner preached
the regular Sunday morning ser
mon in Memorial Church yester
day morning. His subject was
"Conversion to Christianity." Mr.
Gardner said in part:
"I know many fine souls who
have been taught to believe that
conversion is the crucial test of
their religious life. But the emo
tional quality of conversion is not
a necessary preliminary to the re
ligious life. Rather it is the nat
ural development of our faculties
which leads us to perfection of
spirit, as the natural development
of muscles leads us to perfection of
body. Doctrine and dogma do not
make the Christian. No matter
what a man's belief, if he strives to
model his life after Christ's he iB a
true Christian."
