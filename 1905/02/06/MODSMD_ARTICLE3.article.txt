The Freshman class met to-day
to discuss the question of granting
baseball sweaters. The tennis
sweater committee, composed of C.
Perkins, R: A. Kocher, and F. R.
Mugler, was instructed to purchase
sweaters and caps. In order to de
fray the expense of purchasing
these sweaters an assessment of
fifty cents was levied on each mem
ber of the class.
