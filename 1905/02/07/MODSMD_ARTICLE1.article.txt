# TRACK SCHEDULE COMPLETED.
## Number of Interesting Meets Planned for the Members of the Squad. 
### 
Manager Barrett has completed
the track schedule for £he season,
and it is not probable that any
more outside meets will be secured,
but a number of handicap and in
terclass field-days may be held
before the intercollegiate contest.
The annual interclass meet will be
held Junior day. Most of the out
side meets will be for the Freshman
team, the field-day with Pomona
being the only Varsity contest
before the intercollegiate meet.
One of the most interesting meets
on the schedule is the projected
field-day with the high schools of
the Bay cities. The combined
teams of these schools will consist
of the best of the Coast's aca
demic athletes, and the Freshmen
must exert themselves if they hope
to win. The team as planned at
present will consist of fifteen men,
who will be record-holders in their
respective events. The following
schools will be represented on the
team: Lick School of Mechanical
Arts, Cogswell Polytechnic, Lowell
High School, Oakland High School
and Berkeley High School.
Another close meet is anticipated
when the Freshmen meet the com
bined teams of the Santa Clara and
San Jose high schools. These two
schools are taking an active interest
in track athletics this year, and
have the material for a strong
team. The Freshman track 6quad
will also meet a team from the
Santa Rosa High School.
Fifteen men will be taken to Po
mona, and as the manager and
trainer may not accompany the
team, it will consist of fifteen ath
letes. No man will be taken on
the trip who is not up in his work
at the time. In picking the team
to go South, consistent work during
the season rather than single bril
liant performances will be consid
ered.
The full schedule is as follows:
Feb. 11—'05 and '07 vs. '06 and
'08.
Feb. 25 —Freshmen vs. San Jose
and Santa Clara high schools.
Mar. 4—Freshmen vs. Santa
Clara High School.
Mar. 18 —Freshmen vs. Bay
cities high schools.
Mar. 25—Varsity vs. Pomona
College.
Mar. 31 —Interclass field-day.
Apr. 15 —Intercollegiate meet.
