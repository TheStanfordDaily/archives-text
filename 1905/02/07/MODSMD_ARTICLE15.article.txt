In Collier's Weekly appears an
article by D. B. Cropp, coach of the
University of Colorado, entitled
"Football West of the Mississippi."
Cropp reviews the work of the lead

ing teams of the Far Weßt for the
season of 1904 and awards the
championship of the entire region
west of the Mississippi to Stanford.
After outlining the work of the
Colorado team during the season,
Cropp proceeds to speak of the
Stanford-Colorado game as follows:
"Worthy of further mention is
the Stanford-Colorado game, for
the reason that it made possible
the selection of a definite champion
of the entire region west of the
Mississippi. Colorado had, in ad
dition to her sweeping victory over
Utah, clearly won the champion
ship between the Mississippi and
the Rockies, while Stanford had
defeated everything on the Coast.
"In comparing the teams in the
Mississippi-Pacific territory, Stan
ford deserves first place. With a
team averaging 184 pounds, a line
weighing 192 pounds, and a back
field 174 pounds, the team was
equal in its perfection to the Yost
machine. Stanford defeated Cali
fornia 18-0, and won from Colo
rado in the contest for the cham
pionship of the two great divisions,
and deserves, in my opinion, equal
rating with Michigan, Chicago, and
Minnesota."
