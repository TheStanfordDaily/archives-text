Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
Now that the discharges of lyd
dite and shrapnel have ceased and
the atmosphere is beginning to
clarify, may we approach this dis
cussion of the Musical Clubs from
a rather different point of view?
The writer of this communication
is ignorant of the details of the
questions that aroused the recent
controversy and hence is absolutely
non-partisan, —but he is interested
in music; he would like to see the
University represented by a first
class musical organization; he
would like to see that organization
take trips and be not only a "credit
to the University," but self-support
ing to the extent even that its
members would not have to sink
their pin-money in the wreckage.!
One thing results clearly from
the articles recently published in
the Daily Palo Alto, and that is,
that Glee Club concerts for one rea
son or another do not pay. That
being the case, it is time for us to
seek out ways and means to make
them pay. For, as a rule, audi
ences will gather as soon as they
are assured that they will get their
money's worth. This doeß not im
ply any criticism of the perform
ances of our own or any other so
called glee club, for college glee
clubs all over the country are hav
ing difficulty in making both ends
meet. The fact is the average pub
lic has grown tired of glee club
music, and it attends, when it does
attend, from some other reason
than the mere esthetic enjoy
ment.
There was a time when people
enjoyed seeing and hearing twenty
five or thirty young men all attired
in spotless shirt-fronts stand around
in a semicircle and sing about
"college halls" and "walls," and
"elms," and "widows." The efforts
of the first tenor in "Stars of the
summer night" were as good as a
pole-vault; the humorous song was
as unintelligible as a mass play,
the cantata of "The grasshopper
sat on a sweet-potato vine" (hu
morous) always brought down the
house, and when the baritone sang
"Schneider's Band," while his as
sociates Um, ta, ta'ed an accom
paniment, he was sure of an encore
even if he had no friends in the
house. But all that was not music,
it wasn't art, it lacked even the en
dearing charms of the vaudeville;
and audiences, after the novelty
wore off, began to go where they
could find better amusement.
We have here, 1 believe, a men's
glee, a ladies' glee, a mandolin and
guitar club (also of both genders),
and an orchestra. Now is that not
spreading our musical energies
rather wide and thin? Suppose
we fuse all these bodies into one?
(The band was left out, as that
will always need to exist as a
separate body for obvious reasons.)
The English Club has shown us
what can be done by an organiza
tion that means business. Its pro
duction of "The Knight of the
Burning Pestle" was an event not
only here but elsewhere. Its com
ing production will be the same.
Now why would it not be possible
to unite our musicians into one
6erious-minded, energetic club
whose productions would equal in
its field the achievements of the
English Club? That club has been
not only a "credit to the Univer
sity," but it has money in its treas
ury. There is no reason why mu
sical enterprises undertaken on the

same scale ehould not have the
same success.
Suppose we bury the hatchet,
smoke the pipe of peace, and talk
the matter over. C. Searles.
