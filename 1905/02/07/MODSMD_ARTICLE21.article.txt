# "The Rivals" to Stay at Home.
## 
### 
The great success of the Sopho
more production of "The Rivals" led
to some suggestions that the play
should be produced at the Uni
versity of California and at San
Jose. The question was left to the
decision of the Faculty Committee
on Student Body Affairs, and that
committee has decided against the
advisability of the plan. The
play, therefore, will not be given
again.
