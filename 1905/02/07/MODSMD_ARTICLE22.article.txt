Before a large and enthusiastic
audience, Creatore's Italian Band
scored a success in Assembly Hall
last night. It was evident that
Creatore had lost none of his subtle
powers of interpretation in the
three years since he last appeared
at the University. The program
rendered by this wonderful leader
and his excellent band was one
calculated to delight all music
lovers. Creatore scored his great
est triumph in his interpretation
of a grand selection from "Car
men." Owing to a severe cold,
Mme. Barili, the prima donna so
prano, was unable to appear, but
this disappointment was somewhat
counteracted by a masterful render
ing of the "Miserere" from "11
Trovatore" by the band. Creatore
was generous in encores, which
were usually light selections. Signor
Sodero, the gifted Neapolitan harp
ist, likewise scored a success.
