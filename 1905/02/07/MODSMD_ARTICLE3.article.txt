## 
### 
The members of the Class of '01
in and about the University are
making another effort to pay off the
class debt. This debt, which
amounted to approximately $125
when the class graduated, has been
reduced to $30. Different members
of the class have subscribed the
monev. M. A. Thomas, chairman

of the '04 Finance Committee, and
E. C. Rittenhouse, chairman of the
Senior Ball Committee, have en
deavored to collect the money, and
are meeting with considerable suc
cess. No member of the class has
subscribed less than $2, while some
have paid as high as $5.
The principal item of expense
was the refreshments, for which $80
remained unpaid. The rest of the
debt was divided among the farce
committee, the plate committee, and
for the erection of a bandstand.
The balance of $30 has been sub
scribed. and the chairman of the
Finance Committee will undertake
to collect it at once.
