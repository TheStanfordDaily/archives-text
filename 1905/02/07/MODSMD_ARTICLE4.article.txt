# NEW SHELL FOR THE CREW
## Has Been Built at Cornell Under the Supervision of Professor A.W. Smith. 
### 
The four-oared shell which was
ordered by the Boat Club several
months ago arrived in San Fran
cisco this morning. The boat will
be brought down to Stanford,where
it will be housed until a boat-house
can be built at Redwood City. The
shell was built by the Cornell Uni
versity Athletic Association, which
runs a factory for the purpose of
building boats for the use of Cornell
and other institutions. The shell,
therefore, is built upon the latest
lines, and is equal to the best East
ern shells in every way. Professor
A. W. Smith, formerly of Stanford,
has kept in close touch with the
building of the boat, and it is
largely due to his efforts that the
shell was finished as soon as it was.
Professor Smith made the club a 1
present of six oars, which were sent
with the shell.
The cost of building the shell was
$350 and the freight on it amount
ed to $50, so the total cost of the
boat is $400. The club has only a
portion of this amount now on
hand, but it hopes to receive a sub
stantial addition to this amount
from the receipts of "Every Man in
His Humour," as the English Club
has offered to donate one-half of the
net returns of the play to help in
defraying the expenses of the new
boat.
During the last few days the
boating candidates have engaged
in earnest work. Every afternoon
between 4:40 and 6 the men prac
tice either on Lagunita or in the
gymnasium. There are so many
candidates out at the present time
that they cannot all work on the
lake, so they are divided into
squads, which alternate in working
at the two places.
It has been found necessary to
provide some other means of condi
tioning the men than merely put
ting them through practice at the
lake. Because of the many turns
which are made in rowing around
the lake the boats have to be
slowed up often, and this does not
give the men practice on the con
tinual pull which is required in a
race. The time at the lake is there
fore spent mostly in gaining form,
and the work on the machines
serves to give the men the endur
ance required. When practice be
gins at Redwood City later in the
season these difficulties will not be
met with.
