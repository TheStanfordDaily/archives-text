# DIRECT ADMISSION TO BAR.
## Opposition to Proposed Act to Excuse Stanford Law Graduates from Examinations. 
### 
Considerable discussion has been
aroused among the students in the
Law department and the Law fac
ulty by a bill introduced in the
State Legislature by Assemblyman
Houser of Los Angeles, granting
admission to the bar without ex
amination to graduates of the Uni
versity of Southern California Col
lege of Law. It has been suggested
that an amendment be added ex
tending the same privilege to Stan
ford University bachelors of law.
Reports from the Asssmbly seem to
indicate that the measure will not
pass —at least not without strenu
ous opposition. The San Francisco
delegation is strongly opposed to
the proposed law.
Opinion at Stanford University
also seems to be divided. Most of
the students favor such a system,
while the Law faculty are strongly
against it. The students argue
that if the Hastings College of Law
is awarded this privilege, the Stan
ford Law department should be
recognized similarly. But the Law
faculty say that a man having re
ceived his L.L. B. from Stanford is
not yet competent to enter active
practice because three courses
necessary to practice in California
are not given here at all, namely:
procedure, mining law, and irriga
tion law. They further claim that
such a system would lower the
standard of graduates from the
Stanford Law department because
men would come here for the sole
purpose of taking a law degree and
not for education and training.
The faculty memberß are lending
their active efforts against the
measure by sending data to the
lawmakers.
