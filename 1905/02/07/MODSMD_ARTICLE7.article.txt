# Low Prices for English Play.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the English
Club play committee held yester
day afternoon it was decided that
the prices of admission to both per
formances of "Every Man in His
Humour" shall be seventy-five
and fifty cents. Although these
prices are lower that those that
have been charged for many class
productions, the committee decided
to keep the price of tickets down to
the same figures that were charged
two years ago for"The Knight of
the Burning Pestle." As the pur
pose of the English Club in giving
the play is rather for an artistic
success than to make money, the
popular prices offered will enable
everyone to see the play, and at the
same time will enable the club
to cover its expenses.
Rehearsals of the play are being

held Monday, Wednesday and Sat
urday evenings, and are progress
ing very satisfactorily. All except
two or three characters have been
filled by experienced actors. The
cast will be completed by the end
of the week.
