# VICTORY FOR SOPHOMORES.
## Juniors Defeated in Close Contest for the Class Baseball Championship. 
### 
In a close and interesting game
this afternoon the Sophomores de
feated the Juniors for the class
championship by the score of 3 to
1. Both Rook and Chalmers
pitched good ball and received fine
support from their teams. In the
fifth inning Sales was hit in the
knee by a batted ball and forced to
retire from the game. Rook was
then moved to first base and Col
bert went into the box. He was
batted hard, and in the next two
innings the Sophomores scored
three runs. The game was called
at the end of the first half of the
seventh inning.
The line-up follows: '06 —Rook,
pitcher; Spaulding, catcher; Sales,
first base; Weinmann, second base;
Hudson, third base; Colbert, short
stop; Cunha, center field; Camp
bell, right field; Dudley, left field.
'07 —Chalmers, pitcher; Stott,
catcher; Daily, firßt base; Kelley,
second base; Preßley, third base;
Rhyne, short-stop: McLean, center
field; Salisbury, right field; Burtis,
left field.
Colbert was captain of the Jun
iors and Chalmers of the Sopho
mores. The Juniors were handi
capped by the refusal of Coach
Cowden to let Sales pitch for fear
of injury to his arm.
The only new player to go into
the game was Cutler, who took
Dudley's place in left field, Dudley
going to short when Sales retired
and Colbert went into the box.
