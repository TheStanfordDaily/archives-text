# SECOND SANTA CLARA GAME.
## Varsity to Play the College on the Campus Diamond at 3 To-morrow. 
### 
Stanford will meet the Santa
Clara baseball team at 3 o'clock to
morrow afternoon on the campus.
This will be the second game of the
series, Santa Clara having won the
first game of the season by the de
cisive score of sto 0. Since play
ing their first game both Santa
Clara and Stanford have been de
feated by other teams. On last
Saturday Stanford was defeated by
St. Mary's in a close game by the
score of 3 to 2. On Monday Santa
Clara was beaten 9 to 3 by Mayer
Bros.' team of San Jose. The latter
nine numbers among its men Coach
Doyle of last season, and is prac
tically the San Jose team that will
play the Varsity Saturday. Last
Saturday Santa Clara defeated Cal
ifornia, in the latter's first game of
the season, by the score of 5 to 4.
The game was close, Santa Clara
scoring the winning run in the
ninth inning.
The line-up of the Santa Clara
team will be the same as in the
first contest, with the exception
that the pitcher has not been de
cided upon. Walters will probably
be in the box. He pitched the first
game against Stanford and also in
the contest against California, win
ning both these games. In the
game with Mayer Bros. 1 team on
Monday both Johnson and Doyle
were used in the box, and either
one of these men may be tried to
morrow.
Stanford will be weak in the
pitching department, where Santa
Clara is strong. Sales, who has
been pitching well this semester,
injured his knee during the Junior-
Sophomore game yesterday and
will be unable to play. Rook is
also in bad shape, having injured
a finger in yesterday's game, which
compelled him to stop pitching.
He will probably be in shape to
pitch to-morrow, and will be used
in the box, as will also Johnson,
Menardi, and Theile.
