# PROGRESS ON GYMNASIUM.
## Roof Completed and Attention Now Being Given to the Large Dome. 
### 
A large force of men is now at
work on the new Gymnasium build
ing. The roof proper of the struc
ture has been completed, and the
contractor has turned his attention
to the large central dome. With
the completion of this dome, which
will take in the neighborhood of a
month, work will commence on the
interior of the building. Excava
tions are being made for the broad
central steps. The construction of
these steps, and the adding of the
new gables on the sides, will com
plete the exterior work of the build
ing.
A good water Bupply for the
Gymnasium is now assured. The
first well sunk is now being tested
with a ten-horse-power pump. It
has been flowing about 9000 gallons
per hour for the last week. The
second well has reached a depth of
150 feet and shows every indication
of proving as valuable as the first
one. It will be punk 150 feet further.
