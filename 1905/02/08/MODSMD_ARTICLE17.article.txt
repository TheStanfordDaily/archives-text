Tiie Junior class has followed
the excellent example set by the
University of California recently
in offering a medal in lieu of cash
as recognition of the work of the
winner of the class farce competi
tion. The class has not felt justi
fied in suddenly placing the com
petition upon an honor basis en
tirely, but it has left the choice be
tween medal and money to be made
by the winner. Just at present the
success or failure of the plan seems
to rest with the man who makes
the choice in the present instance.
All that is needed is a precedent.
When we get that, a medal will be
given as a matter of course. A
medal will mean a great deal more
than a small cash prize, which is
gone and forgotten in a day. It
will be something that man or
woman may always treasure as a
distinction conferred by fellow-stu
dents, and the names of winners of
class farces will be remembered and
honored. The competition will be
upon a new basis, and a finer one.
