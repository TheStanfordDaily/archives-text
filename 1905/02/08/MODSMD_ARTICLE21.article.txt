# FOOTBALL RULES FOR 1905.
## George Ade in the New York "Inquirer" Figures Out a Code for Humane Play. 
### 
Under the revised rules, which I
am now submitting through the
medium of your valuable paper,
the test oi a player's ability will be
his class standing. It is hoped
that these rules will be approved
by the W. C. T. U., Professor Harry
Thurston Peck, and that vast army
of editorial writers whose knowl
edge of the game has been obtained
by reading the headlines. Walter
Camp may object to some of the
provisions, but what care we?
Selection of players —The eleven
players constituting the team shall
be selected by the faculty, and the
student who has received the high
est grade in Greek anthology shall
be captain of the team. No student
Bhall be eligible for the team unless
he is up in all his class work and
has an established reputation for
piety.
Preliminaries —When a team ap
pears on the field for a contest, it
shall greet opposing team with the
Chautauqua salute, which consists
of waving the handkerchief. After
this a few minutes of social inter
course, with friendly chats concern
ing books and writers, may pre
cede the opening of the game.
Substitute for"the toss" — In
stead of tossing a coin to determine
which side gets the ball, the two
captains shall be called upon to
extract the cube root of a number
given out by the professor of mathe
matics. The captain who is first
to hand in the correct solution gets
the ball.
Advancing the. ball—The ball
having been placed in the center of
the field, the umpire, who must be
a professor of geology, exhibits to
the team having possession of the
ball a fossil. All members of the
team who think that they can
name the geological period to which
the fossil belongs hold up their
right hands. The umpire selects a
player to name the period. If he
answers correctly, he advances the
ball two yards. If, in addition, he
gives the scientific name of the fos
sil, he advances the ball five yards.
If no member of the team can an
swer the questions propounded by
the umpire, theopposing team shall
be given a trial. If successful it is
given the ball.
Off-side plays—Any player who
makes a grammatical error, mis
pronounces a word, or seeks assist
ance from a fellow-student shall be
deemed guilty of an off-side play
and his side shall be penalized at
least five yards.
Substitute for kicking goal —Af-
ter a touch-down has been made,
the team making it shall be cred
ited with five points and the cap
tain of the team shall translate
500 words of Caesar's commentaries.
If he does so without an error his
team is given an additional point,
the same as if a goal were kicked.
If he fails the ball goes to the op
posing team on the 25-yard line.
Resuming play —On resuming
play after a touch-down, one of the
players to be known as "it" is
blindfolded and the other players
join hands and circle around him,
singing:
"London bridge is falling down,
Falling down, falling down.
London bridge is falling down,
So farewell, my ladies!"
While the players are circling
about, the player known as "it"

touches one of the other players in
a gentlemanly manner and asks
him three questions, which must be
answered. Then he tries to guess
the name of the player. If he suc
ceeds, he picks up the ball and ad
vances it 15 yards.
Conduct during game —No push
ing, no Bcuflling or boisterous con
versation will be permitted. Both
players and spectators must main
tain absolute silence during the
mental teßts.

If he does so without an error his

If he fails the ball goes to the op

Resuming play —On resuming
play after a touch-down, one of the
players to be known as "it" is

London bridge is falling down,
So farewell, my ladies!"
While the players are circling
about, the player known as "it"

touches one of the other players in
a gentlemanly manner and asks

the name of the player. If he suc
ceeds, he picks up the ball and ad
vances it 15 yards.

Under the revised rules, which I
am now submitting through the
medium of your valuable paper,
the test oi a player's ability will be
his class standing. It is hoped
that these rules will be approved
by the W. C. T. U., Professor Harry
Thurston Peck, and that vast army
of editorial writers whose knowl
edge of the game has been obtained
by reading the headlines. Walter
Camp may object to some of the
provisions, but what care we?
Selection of players —The eleven
players constituting the team shall
be selected by the faculty, and the
student who has received the high
est grade in Greek anthology shall
be captain of the team. No student
Bhall be eligible for the team unless
he is up in all his class work and
has an established reputation for
piety.
Preliminaries —When a team ap
pears on the field for a contest, it
shall greet opposing team with the
Chautauqua salute, which consists
of waving the handkerchief. After
this a few minutes of social inter
course, with friendly chats concern
ing books and writers, may pre
cede the opening of the game.
Substitute for"the toss" — In
stead of tossing a coin to determine
which side gets the ball, the two
captains shall be called upon to
extract the cube root of a number
given out by the professor of mathe
matics. The captain who is first
to hand in the correct solution gets
the ball.
Advancing the. ball—The ball
having been placed in the center of
the field, the umpire, who must be
a professor of geology, exhibits to
the team having possession of the
ball a fossil. All members of the
team who think that they can
name the geological period to which
the fossil belongs hold up their
right hands. The umpire selects a
player to name the period. If he
answers correctly, he advances the
ball two yards. If, in addition, he
gives the scientific name of the fos
sil, he advances the ball five yards.
If no member of the team can an
swer the questions propounded by
the umpire, theopposing team shall
be given a trial. If successful it is
given the ball.
Off-side plays—Any player who
makes a grammatical error, mis
pronounces a word, or seeks assist
ance from a fellow-student shall be
deemed guilty of an off-side play
and his side shall be penalized at
least five yards.
Substitute for kicking goal —Af-
ter a touch-down has been made,
the team making it shall be cred
ited with five points and the cap
tain of the team shall translate
500 words of Caesar's commentaries.
If he does so without an error his
team is given an additional point,
the same as if a goal were kicked.
If he fails the ball goes to the op
posing team on the 25-yard line.
Resuming play —On resuming
