# Special Number of "Chaparral."
## 
### 
The Valentine issue of the Chap
arral appeared to-day in a new
cover. While all resemblance to
the original Chaparral is lost in
the new cover, which consists of a
plain, heavy brown sheet serving
as a frame for an oval portrait of a
girl's head done in black and
white, the artistic effect produced
makes the change acceptable. The
issue contains the usual number of
clever drawings and jokes. The
leading editorial disapproves of the
curtailing of complimentary tickets
in class productions, and the sec
ond leader expresses sympathy for
the Stanford man who accepts a
Rhodes scholarship.
