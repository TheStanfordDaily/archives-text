# MEDAL IN LIEU OF CASH.
## Junior Class Offers Alternative of Choice to Winner of Farce Contest. 
### 
The Juniors met in the chapel
to-day to discuss several matters
connected with class activities. The
committee in charge of the Junior
Farce suggested that the class de
cide what form of recognition shall
be given to the writer of the farce.
It has been the custom in the past
to offer a prize of $25, but consid
ering the gradual change of student
body opinion that these rewards
should not consist of money, a new
plan was adopted. The class voted
$25 to be given to the winner of
the farce contest, either in the form
of money or as a medal or other
suitable emblem, the choice being
left with the successful contestant.
The question of having a Junior
banquet or smoker was discussed
at length. It was shown that the
idea of a class celebration was to
unite the members of the class in
close bonds of friendship. The
proposition met with unanimous
approval, and it was decided that
a banquet would be the best way
to get the class together. While
the plans are yet indefinite, it is
the idea to have a dinner, after
which speeches and songs will be
indulged in. The final plans were
left in the hands of a committee,
under the presidency of L. R. Wein
mann. The other members of the
committee will be appointed by
President Cutler in a few days.
Class sweaters were voted to E.
G. Dudley, R. H. Rook, and C. E.
Spaulding in recognition of their
services in the recent interclass
baseball series.
