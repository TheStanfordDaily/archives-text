The announcement that Stanford
is to have a debate with the Uni
versity of Nevada will he received
with pleasure by those who have
been watching the growth of our re
lations with the Sagebrush college.
For several years we have been
playing football with Nevada, and
each year the Stanford - Nevada
game has been looked forward to
as second only to the California
game because of the excellence of
the teams that are sent against us.
In every instance the Nevada men
have shown themselves to be thor
ough sportsmen, and whether they
have won or lost there has never
been a break in the cordiality of
our relations. It was hoped that
Nevada would send a track team
to try conclusions with the Cardi
nal this spring, but this seems to
be prevented by financial strin
gency. It is possible, however, that
a baseball game, or series of games,
may be arranged for this season.
And now it is definitely announced
that a debate will be held, the Stan
ford men making the trip to Reno
in April. If in all these events
the Nevadans prove themselves as
worthy opponents as they are in
football, it is well worth our while
to seek their competition and
friendship.
