## Dr. Nathan Abbott Gives Interesting Details of the American System. 
### 
Dr. Nathan Abbott yesterday
afternoon delivered his second lec
ture this semester on legal litera
ture. The subject was "Law Re
porting in America." A large
number of law students attended
the lecture. Dr. Abbott said, in
part:
"The real making of American
law books begins in 1800. In 1803
Massachusetts passed an act pro
viding for an official reporter, and
such reporters were provided for in
most of the other States. Report
ing by the National Reporter's sys
tem began in 1876, when J. P.
West of St. Paul began publishing
a weekly syllabus of Minnesota de
cisions. From this he gradually
extended the system. In 1878 he
began the Northwestern Reporter,
including Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Michigan, lowa, Nebraska, and
the Dakotas. This was followed
by the Federal Reporter in 1880,
the Supreme Court Reporter in
1883, the Pacific Reporter in 1883,
the Northeastern Reporter in 1885,
containing reportsof Massachusetts,
New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Il
linois. In 1885 the West Publish
ing Company, which had been in
corporated in 1882, announced the
Atlantic, Southeastern, and South
western reporters, thus covering
the decisions of all the courts of
last resort in the United States.
The publishers of the official re
ports attempted by legal proceed
ings to prevent the publishing
company from getting access to the
decisions of the judges, but it was
held by the courts that there can
be no property in the law, and that
decisions must be open to all and
cannot be copyrighted.
"The present system of publish
ing these reports is to issue the
decision in pamphlet form as soon
as received, and to follow them by
bound volumes. A digest is pub
lished every three months, and a
bound digest issued at the end of
every year. Twenty-five thousand
cases are thus published annually.
The complete National Reporter's
system to date contains nearly one
half of all the decisions which
have been delivered by American
courts."
