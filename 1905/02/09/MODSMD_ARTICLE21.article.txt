# COSTUMES FOR PLAY DESIGNED
## Carefully Prepared Clothes Will be Feature of "Every Man in His Humour." 
### 
The work of designing costumes
for the characters in "Every Man
in His Humour" has been com
pleted, and the contract for making
them has been awarded. The con
tract was let by W. H. Thomson,
'05, acting as business manager for
the play committee, to the same
San Francisco firm that had charge
of the costumes two years ago for
''The Knight of the Burning Pes
tle," when the work was most sat
isfactorily done.
The contract calls for the making
of eighteen costumes, accurate de
signs of each of which have been
prepared by the English Club
and placed in the hands of the
makers with precise directions as to
color and detail. The measurements
of all the members of the cast have
been taken, and these costumes will
be ready in time for advance pic
tures of the play to be taken.
It is expected that the costuming
of the characters will not only add
to the general effect of the produc
tion, but will be one of the distinc
tive features of the play. The work
has been done with the greatest
care, and its conformity with the
original costuming of the Eliza
bethan stage will be as nearly per
fect as can be brought about on the
modern stage. In order to accom
plish this, use was made of many
old works on costuming, besides the
many valuable hints contained in
the play itself.
Several of the costumes are of an
especially interesting nature, nota
bly that of Cash, who is one of the
famous "London Bluecoat" school
boys of Christ's Hospital. Another
is that of the famous Captain Boba
dill, who is a St. Paul's man, or
military dude, affecting all the ex
treme fashions of the time.
The entire work in connection
with designing the costumes has
been in charge of Miss C. Z. Ed
wards, '06, assisted by Miss A. W.
Kimball, '04, and Miss H. L.
Darby, '05.
