# GOOD PERFORMANCES ON OVAL.
## Track and Field Men Make Excellent Showing in Trials. 
### 
Yesterday and to-day some good
trials were held on the oval. These
trials are being run every day, but
the number of good performances
yesterday was rather unusual.
The most noteworthy of these was
a vault of 11 feet 8 inches by F. R.
Lanagan, '08. Considering the fact
that Lanagan is a new man in this
event, his vault is remarkable.
In the half-mile run several men
ran fast heats. L. G. Russell, '06,
ran a trial in 2:09.4, and F. G.
Smith, '05, covered the distance in
2:10.3. E. J. Nash, '07, who has
been running the 2 miles, made the
half in 2:12. J. P. Dunn, '08, ran
the 220-yard dash in 25:3 seconds.
L. W. Barbur, '07, a new man on
the track, ran the 440-yard dash
in 55:3.
L. G. Burr, '05, covered the 2-
mile run to-day in the fast time,
for the track and season, of 10:40.
Stanford has always been weak in
this event, not even taking a third
place in the last two field-days,
but Burr's performance practically
assures him a place in that event
this year.
With the exception of the upper
turn and a narrow strip near the
pole the track is very rough, but
an attempt will be made to have it
in good shape for the meet Satur
day. In the coming field-day the
2-mile run will be shortened to six
laps, while three laps will be run
for the mile. The other races will
be for the full distance. Entries
for Saturday's meet must be in by
Friday afternoon at 3.
