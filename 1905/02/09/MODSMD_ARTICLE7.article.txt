# TRUSTEES APPROVE PLANS.
## Training – House Corporation's Layout of Athletic Field Passed Upon Favorably. 
### 
The Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity has formally approved the
plans for the new athletic field re
cently submitted by the Training-
House Corporation. The sanction
of the plans by the Board clears the
way for an immediate beginning of
work on the new grounds. Grading
for the football field will be begun
as soon as possible, in order that it
may be completed before the spring
rains cease. This will allow the
graded foundation to be thoroughly
settled by the rain before the
bleachers are erected.
It is the intention of the Train
ing-House Corporation to complete
the stadium before setting to work
on the track or baseball fields. The
football field must be ready for the
intercollegiate game next semester,
while the track will not be needed
until the following spring, when the
Intercollegiate Track meet comes to
Stanford.
The limited amount of money on
hand for the carrying out of the ex
tensive planß of the promoters of
the field will necessitate that the
work progress slowly.
