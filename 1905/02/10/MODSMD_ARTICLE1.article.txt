# TRACK MEET SATURDAY.
## The 						Classes of '05 and '07 to Contest for Supremacy Over '06 and '08. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
the second field-day of the season
will he held on the oval. The classes
of '0.5 and '07 will meet '06 and '08,
and the contest will be interesting,
as the two sides are about evenly
matched. The long-distance races
will be shortened, but the full dis
tance will be run in the dashes.
The track team has sustained a
severe blow through the withdrawal
from college of R. F. West, '06.
West left for his home in Washing
ton yesterday, and will not return
to Stanford this semester. West,
with H. W. Bell, '05, holds the
Stanford record, 22 feet 2i inches,
in the broad jump. He took first
place in that event in the inter
collegiate meet last spring, and was
relied upon to win first or second
place again this year.
