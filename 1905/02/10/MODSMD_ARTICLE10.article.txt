The announcement of the cast of
"Every Man in His Humour"
should attract the attention of all
members of the University who are
interested in the maintenance of a
high standard in dramatics at
Stanford. It can safely be said
that the English Club's produc
tion of "The Knight of the Burn
ing Pestle" and the "Antigone" of
Sophocles were the most thoroughly
artistic, and in all ways the most
successful undertakings that have
graced the Stanford stage. More
than this, they have been a credit
to Stanford wherever they have
been heard of, and their very merit
has assured their being heard of
widely. From the care with which
the cast of the present play has
been selected, from the names of
the people who appear in the cast,
and most of all from the fact that
the English Club has gone about
preparing for it with a view to pre
senting art for art's sake, instead
of seeking to fill its treasury, we
may rest assured that the high
standard set for Stanford dramatics
in the two former productions will
be well maintained.
