# DINNER TO CARNOT MEN.

### 
Debaters Entertained by Dr. Alden.
Discussion, of the Debating
System.
A. Sherriffs, '05, R. G. Earnett,
'05, D. 1). Sales, '06, and A. R.
Fletcher, '05, who composed this
year's Carnot team, were the guests
last night at a dinner given by
Professor R. M. Alden at his Palo
Alto home. Later in the evening
the members of the Oral Debate
class called. Professor C. A. Duni
way of the History department was
also present. The facility members
and the debaters thoroughly dis
cussed the present system of con
ducting the Carnot debates, and
incidentally the recent contest.
For several years past there has
been considerable agitation both
here and atthe Universityof Califor
nia for a change to the old method
of conducting these debates, which
was to announce the subject of dis
cussion beforehand and thereby
allow the contestants to present set
speeches. The change was insti
tuted to encourage extemporaneous
work, and this result has been
achieved. Many claim, however,
that an element of chance now en
ters these contests which did not
hitherto exist. Some men may in
their study hit exactly on the
question which is later anuounced
for the actual contest, while others
will not be so well prepared be
cause of their failure to study in
this particular field.
The general sentiment among
those present last night was that,
though this element of uncertainty
does undoubtedly exist, such ex
cellent training is secured as a re
sult of the thorough preparation
and extemporaneous work neces
sary under the present system that
a change to the old method is not
desirable. All agreed, however,
that the general field for study
ought to be narrowed as much as
possible.
Nevada Submits Question.
The University of Nevada sub
mitted to-day to the Stanford de
baters the following question: "Re
solved, That laws relating to mar
riage and divorce should be uni
form throughout the United States,
and that for that purpose Congress
should by constitutional amend
ment be given power to pass such
laws."
Stanford has a week in which to
select the side.
A tentative list of judges was
also forwarded. Among these are
W. A. Massey, ex-Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court; A. E. Chenney,
George Martinson, and A. D.
Cooke, Reno attorneys; Chief Jus
tice G. F. Talbot, United States
District Attorney Sardis Summer
field, and W. B. Craig, District At
torney of Washoe county.
The team to be sent to Reno will
be chosen at the final try-out, when
the trio will be picked which is to
meet California the night of the
field meet. The Nevada-Stanford
debate will be held April 22d at
Reno.
