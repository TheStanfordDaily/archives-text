The San .Tose Professionals will
be the opponents of the Varsity in
the baseball game to be played on
the campus to-morrow afternoon.
This will be the first of a series of
three games with this nine. The
team is made up largely of profes

the coming season. A number of
the players were members of Mayer
Bros.' team, which defeated Santa
Clara last Monday by the score of
9 to 3.
The team includes five men who
are good pitchers —Doyle, Emerson,
Arrellanes, Chase and Cutter. Cut

and has pitched for Coast League
teams. Emerson pitched for the
Mayer Bros.' team, which played
the Varsity a series of games last
season. Another pitcher is Arrel

the campus two years ago. These
men will not be seen in the box,
however, that position being re

last year's Varsity, will captain the
visiting team.
