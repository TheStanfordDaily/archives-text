THE foregoing is the cast of
"Every Man in His Humour,''
which will be presented by the
English Club on the evening of
Wedneday, March Bth, and on the
morning of the following Saturday.
This caet has been finally selected
after nearly two months of prelim
inary work, and those in charge of
the performance feel entirely con
fident of its ability to equal the
production of "The Knight of the
Burning Pestle," given with such
great success by the English Club
two years ago.
Five members of the cast of "The
Knight of the Burning Pestle" will
be seen in the present play. Chief
among these is J. K. Bonnell, '02,
and E. 0. James, '02. Bonnell,
who made a great success two years
ago as the grocer's wife in Beau
mont and Fletcher's production,
will be given a still greater field to
show his ability in the role of Jon
son's famous Captain Bobadill.
Bonnell is also remembered for his
interpretation of the part of the
messenger in "Antigone" in 1902.
He also acted in numerous class
plays and farces, and recently took
the part of the First Player in
Ben Greet's production of "Ham
let." At present he is holding a
position in the English depart
ment.
E. 0. James, '02, whose work as
Master Merrythought in"The
Knight of the Burning Pestle" was
of an unusually high order, will
come from Pacific Grove, where he
is at present vice-principal of the
high school, to assume the role of
Justice Clement. James also had
the part of Aldorus in the "Anti
gone" production, and took part in
many other plays during his col
lege course. In"The Knight of
the Burning Pestle" James sang
the Elizabethan songs which were
so pleasing a feature of the play.
E. V. Henley, '06, who took the
part of the dwarf in"The Knight
of the Burning Pestle," will have
the part of Thomas Cash, Kitely's
cashier. Henley was picked out
by Greet last fall for the part of
the second grave-digger in "Ham
let," and was highly commended by
Greet on his rendering of the lines.
He has taken successfully many
comic parts in class productions,

especially in last year's Junior
farce.
The other two actors remaining
from "The Knight of the Burning
Pestle" are 0. H. Clarke, '05, and
P. C. Edwards, '06, who will have
the parts of Kitely and Cob re
spectively. Clarke was one of the
chorus in "Antigone," and took a
short speaking part in "Hamlet."
Edwards has been connected with
college dramatics Bince his fresh
man year. Last year he was a
member of the cast of "David Gar
rick," "Patience" and the Junior
farce, and this year took the part
of the Second Player in "Ham
let."
R. G. Barnett, '05, will fill the
important part of Kitely. Bar
nett's appearance on the Stanford
stage has been limited to the '06
production of "David Garrick" last
year and a part in the Junior
farce. In "David Garrick," how
ever, he did excellent work, and
he promises to do equally well with
the part of Kitely.
A. L. Trowbridge, '05, who will
be the younger Knoweli, has also
appeared on the stage but once at
Stanford, having taken the title
role in "The Man from Mizzoury"
last March.
Another actor whose work in the
preliminary rehearsals has been
full of promise is R. H. Baker, '08.
Baker comes this year from the
San Diego High School with a rep
utation acquired from having taken
successfully important roles in
high school performances. He will
have the most essentially comic
character of the play, that of
Brainworm.
The character of Wellbred will
be taken by J. M. Warde, '07, who
also comes from the San Diego High
School, having likewise partici
pated in the Shaksperean perform
ances given there.
L. W. Cutler, '06, and H. L.
Thomson, '06, will have the parts
of Mathew, the town gull, and Ste
phen, the country gull, respectively.
Neither of these men has appeared
on the Stanford stage up to the
present time. Thomson entered
Stanford from the University of
Maine last fall, and while in the
East gained considerable experi-
ence on the stage. D. H. Clift,'o7,
will have the part of Roger Formal,
clerk to Justice Clement. Clift has
had no previous experience on the
stage, but promises to handle the
part successfully.
The two servants' parts will be
taken by R. S. Lacey, '07, and H. S.
Ross, '08. Ross has taken leading
parts in several plays that were
given at the Pasadena High School.
The unusually small number of
female characters in the cast will
make it possible for the three parts
to be done with exceptional ability.
The part of Dame Kitely will be
taken by Miss Claire C. Pedlar, '07,
whose appearance in the role of
Lydia Languish in the recent pro
duction of "The Rivals" wau so suc
cessful. Miss Pedlar was also in the
chorus of "Patience" last May. Miss
Jeraldine Brown, '05, who will take
the part of Mistress Bridget, took
the title role of Patience, and was
also seen in the play given by the
faculty in Palo Alto last semester.
Miss E. L. Buckingham, '08, who
will take the part of Tib, Cob's
wife, has had considerable experi
ence in amateur dramatics.
The lateness in selecting the final
cast for the play is due to the large
number of important parts in the
play. If properly handled each
one of the thirteen male characters
is capable of being made a star part,
and in selecting the cast each part
offered a problem in itself.
The work of selecting and train
ing the cast has been in charge of
L. E. Bassettof the English depart
ment.
