# SENIORS AND SOPHS WIN.
## Classes of ’05 and '07 Defeat Juniors and Freshmen by a Single Point. 
### 
The second track meet of the
season was held on the oval Satur
day morning. The classes of '05
and '07 were successful against the
teams representing even-numbered
classes by the narrow margin of
one point. The final score was 59
points for '05 and '07 to 58 for '06
and '08. Despite the handicap of
a heavy track, due to the showers
of the previous night, some excel
lent performances were made. Slip
pery runways also militated against
the best results in the field events.
Several of the new men on the track
did very creditable work, proving
that they are distinct Varsity possi
bilities.
One of the best performances of
the day was the half-mile run, won
by Miller, '08, in the fast time of
2:06.3. After bringing up the rear
for the first lap Miller passed all of
his competitors with a fine burst of
speed and won out by many yards.
With only three men entered, the
low hurdles furnished one of the
most exciting races of the meet.
Weller, '07, won, with Macfarland,
'07, second, and Horton, '08, third.
Trainer Moulton expressed him
self as highly satisfied with the
work of the track candidates. He
further said that this year's team
will be th most evenly balanced that
has ever represented Stanford in an
intercollegiate field meet. j
