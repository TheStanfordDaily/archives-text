A good word must be said for
the University Band, which made
its initial appearance of the semes
ter at Saturday's baseball game.
Although the Band has received
small aid from the Associated Stu
dents, it has always shown a readi
ness to accept its full share of work
in connection with student body
activities. It has appeared regu
larly throughout the seasons at the
baseball, track and football meets,
when it has been little pleasure to
be under the restrictions imposed
by such work. Last year the Band
inaugurated a series of promenade
concerts upon the quadrangle
which were very successful, and it
is pleasing to find that the organi
zation proposes to give the same
kind of entertainment again this
year. These concerts afford an op
portunity for a couple of hours of
social relaxation under the most
pleasant conditions, and those
given last year were greatly ap
preciated. Not a great deal in the
way of help or praise comes the
way of the Band, but for all that it
remains one of the hardest working
and most useful of the undergradu
ate organizations.
