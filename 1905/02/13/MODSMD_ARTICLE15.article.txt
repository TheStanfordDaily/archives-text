Copies of a small publication en
titled "Both Sides," issued by the
debating council at Harvard Uni
versity, have just been received
here. At the head of the staff is
the name of Fletcher B. Wagner,
Stanford '02. The object of the
publishers is to make this journal
an intercollegiate debating maga
zine, and accordingly they are try
ing to introduce it into all the lead
ing universities of the country.
Later the staff will consist of repre
sentatives from each of these uni
versities.
Wagner, the editor-in-chief of
the journal, was a prominent figure
in debating circles while at Stan
ford, having won the Carnot medal
in 1902. After entering Harvard
he was there chosen as a member of
the varsity debating team.
