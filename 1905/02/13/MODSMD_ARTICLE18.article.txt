# Varsity Defeated Again.
## 
### 
The San Jose Professionals com
pletely outclassed the Varsity in
Saturday's game and won easily
by the score of sto 2. This is the
fourth defeat that has been admin
istered to the Varsity since the be
ginning of the season. San Jose
scored two runs in the second in
ning, one in the fifth, and two in
the sixth. The first two runs were
made without a hit, a base on balls
and two bad errors being responsi
ble for the scores. Stanford's runs
were made in the seventh inning
by Cadwalader and Stott on a hit
and two errors.
Stanford made five hits, the same
number as their opponents, but
they did not come when hits were
most needed. The batting of the
men was much better than in the
previous games, very few striking
out. The fielding of the team was
poor at times, and errors were
largely responsible for the five runs
scored. ,
The Varsity line-up was different
from what it has been in any of
the previous games. Sales pitched
the entire game and was in good
form, but he was given poor sup
port. Chalmers was moved into
right field, Dudley taking his place.
Presley was tried at first base, Col
bert playing second.
Swain, brother of last season's
Varsity third baseman; was the
star of the game scoring three of
his team's runs, and out of two
times at bat, getting a three-bagger
and a two-base hit.
