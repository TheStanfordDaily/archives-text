Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In your issue of January 31st
you published an item respecting
the Young Men's Christian Associ
ation and the Young Woman's
Christian Association in which it
is stated that these two organiza
tions are each planning to erect a
home upon the campus, and the
estimated cost of each building is
fifteen thousand dollars. The item
also explains that the work of these
bodies cannot be carried on in the
"small rooms on the quad, where
their employment bureau, Bible
classes, and committee meetings
have been held."
The perusal of this piece of news
leads me to wonder whether that
grand old English virtue of com
mon sense has forever departed
from our midst. It is a matter of
great speculation on just
grounds this new proposal can be
defended, for to my, mind there is
as much need for tfn ice-house in
the Arctic circle, or of a sand
house on the Sahara, as there is for
a Y. M. C. A. building on the Stan
ford campus. I am not entirely
ignorant of the history of the
Y. M. C. A. movement in England
or America. I feel that I some
what dimly appreciate the nobility
and grandeur of the aims of this
great association, and I think I
have a fair understanding -of the
methods by which these ends are
to be attained.
Briefly, these methods are,
firstly, the reading-room, and this
is usually the first life-line thrown
out to the young men of any com
munity. Obviously the design is
to attract men and boys away from
the street, the saloon, the gambling
den, and other such holes of
iniquity.
Secondly, the Sunday service,
where the idea is to encourage the
upright and lend a helping hand
to some young man out on the
borderland of God's goodness and
God's mercy.
Thirdly, the educational classes,
generally conducted .for aiding
young men who have been denied,
certain advantages in early life.
Fourthly and lastly, the gym
nasium, which is the dominating
influence in Y. M. C. A. plans, and,
in fact, the great city and town
associations lay their chief stress
on this method, and figure on
reaching more young men by this
avenue than by all others com
bined. Ido not contend that no
other means are employed, but I do
assert with confidence that-" these
four modes which I have outlined
are the ones which experienced
Y. M. C. A. men have found most
adequate and successful.
The question now arises, how
can the Christian associations at
Stanford University employ a
single one of these schemes without
duplicating, or rather attempting
to duplicate, the facilities already
existing and far superior to the
new ones projected? The Univer
sity maintains a Library of eighty
thousand volumes and keeps on
hand the latest periodicals of merit.
Encina Club has a reading-room
with all the popular monthly and
weekly fiction available, and we
believe the Encina man is yet to
be found who would make any
other Stanford man feel unwel
come in the Encina club-room.
Enough reading matter to serve
the purpose is to be found on the
library table of every fraternity
house.

In the next place, the religious
needs of the University are amply
provided for. In the hearts of
Stanford men and women, God's
palace on the quad is firmly es
tablishing itself, and a chaplain
with a large soul is ever ready to
help heal a wounded heart, no mat
ter to whom it may belong.
Again, the educational side of
the local Y. M. C. A, has no raison
d'etre, unless it be Bible study.
And lastly, it can do absolutely
nothing for young men from the
standpoint of the gymnasium and
athletics, as a half-million-dollar
college gymnasium and the preva
lence of athletic undertakings
would render any such efforts on a
smaller scale ridiculous.
But as to their present peculiar
and necessary functions. The
labor bureau is the phase of Y. M.
C. A. work at Stanford which is
most necessary and which can be
done better by it than by any other
agency. Will not a room on the
quad answer the purpose as well as
an office in a special frame build
ing with stone trimmings? The
Bible classes and committee meet
ings can also be held on the quad
as effectively as anywhere, and if
the email rooms won't do, we can
petition Mr. Lathrop for the use of
one of the many large ones lying
around loose.
In conclusion, this article is not
written to "knock" the Y. M. C. A.
or Y. W. C. A. I have a high
opinion of the Christian manhood
and womanhood of the young peo
ple who head the organizations at
Stanford. But I dislike to see
thirty thousand dollars misapplied
when it could be more advantage
ously employed. This sum put at
interest would provide a much
needed fund from which self-sup
porting students could be given
temporary financial assistance. I
have known many a good Stanford
man to leave college only a few
weeks before a semester's end, sim
ply for the lack of a few necessary
dollars. Or in truth, aY.M.C. A.
in Palo Alto might find some real
use for a building such as is con
templated being erected on the
campus. But if this suggestion
does not find favor, turn the money
over to some city association which
has some real, vital problems to
face, or endow some rescue home
which may save a few struggling
girls from the unspeakable hell of
our great cities, but don't waste it
by erecting two buildings on the
Stanford campus in an atmosphere
of Christian culture and refine
ment, where every student, if his
feet do not naturally turn to God,
is entirely too busy to pay atten
tion to the devil. Senior.

The question now arises, how
can the Christian associations at
Stanford University employ a
single one of these schemes without
duplicating, or rather attempting
to duplicate, the facilities already
existing and far superior to the
new ones projected? The Univer
sity maintains a Library of eighty
thousand volumes and keeps on
hand the latest periodicals of merit.
Encina Club has a reading-room
with all the popular monthly and
weekly fiction available, and we
believe the Encina man is yet to
be found who would make any
other Stanford man feel unwel
come in the Encina club-room.
Enough reading matter to serve
the purpose is to be found on the
library table of every fraternity
house.

In the next place, the religious
needs of the University are amply
provided for. In the hearts of
Stanford men and women, God's
palace on the quad is firmly es
tablishing itself, and a chaplain
with a large soul is ever ready to
help heal a wounded heart, no mat
ter to whom it may belong.
Again, the educational side of
the local Y. M. C. A, has no raison
d'etre, unless it be Bible study.
And lastly, it can do absolutely
nothing for young men from the
standpoint of the gymnasium and
athletics, as a half-million-dollar
college gymnasium and the preva
lence of athletic undertakings
would render any such efforts on a
smaller scale ridiculous.
But as to their present peculiar
and necessary functions. The
labor bureau is the phase of Y. M.
C. A. work at Stanford which is
most necessary and which can be
done better by it than by any other
agency. Will not a room on the
quad answer the purpose as well as
an office in a special frame build
ing with stone trimmings? The
Bible classes and committee meet
ings can also be held on the quad
as effectively as anywhere, and if
the email rooms won't do, we can
petition Mr. Lathrop for the use of
one of the many large ones lying
around loose.
In conclusion, this article is not
written to "knock" the Y. M. C. A.
or Y. W. C. A. I have a high
opinion of the Christian manhood
and womanhood of the young peo
ple who head the organizations at
Stanford. But I dislike to see
thirty thousand dollars misapplied
when it could be more advantage
ously employed. This sum put at
interest would provide a much
needed fund from which self-sup
porting students could be given
temporary financial assistance. I
have known many a good Stanford
man to leave college only a few
weeks before a semester's end, sim
ply for the lack of a few necessary
dollars. Or in truth, aY.M.C. A.
in Palo Alto might find some real
use for a building such as is con
templated being erected on the
campus. But if this suggestion
does not find favor, turn the money
over to some city association which
has some real, vital problems to
face, or endow some rescue home
which may save a few struggling
girls from the unspeakable hell of
our great cities, but don't waste it
by erecting two buildings on the
Stanford campus in an atmosphere
of Christian culture and refine
ment, where every student, if his
feet do not naturally turn to God,
is entirely too busy to pay atten
tion to the devil. Senior.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In your issue of January 31st
you published an item respecting
the Young Men's Christian Associ
ation and the Young Woman's
Christian Association in which it
is stated that these two organiza
tions are each planning to erect a
home upon the campus, and the
estimated cost of each building is
fifteen thousand dollars. The item
also explains that the work of these
bodies cannot be carried on in the
"small rooms on the quad, where
their employment bureau, Bible
classes, and committee meetings
have been held."
The perusal of this piece of news
leads me to wonder whether that
grand old English virtue of com
mon sense has forever departed
from our midst. It is a matter of
great speculation on just
grounds this new proposal can be
defended, for to my, mind there is
as much need for tfn ice-house in
the Arctic circle, or of a sand
house on the Sahara, as there is for
a Y. M. C. A. building on the Stan
ford campus. I am not entirely
ignorant of the history of the
Y. M. C. A. movement in England
or America. I feel that I some
what dimly appreciate the nobility
and grandeur of the aims of this
great association, and I think I
have a fair understanding -of the
methods by which these ends are
to be attained.
Briefly, these methods are,
firstly, the reading-room, and this
is usually the first life-line thrown
out to the young men of any com
munity. Obviously the design is
to attract men and boys away from
the street, the saloon, the gambling
den, and other such holes of
iniquity.
Secondly, the Sunday service,
where the idea is to encourage the
upright and lend a helping hand
to some young man out on the
borderland of God's goodness and
God's mercy.
Thirdly, the educational classes,
generally conducted .for aiding
young men who have been denied,
certain advantages in early life.
Fourthly and lastly, the gym
nasium, which is the dominating
influence in Y. M. C. A. plans, and,
in fact, the great city and town
associations lay their chief stress
on this method, and figure on
reaching more young men by this
avenue than by all others com
bined. Ido not contend that no
other means are employed, but I do
assert with confidence that-" these
four modes which I have outlined
are the ones which experienced
Y. M. C. A. men have found most
adequate and successful.

Stanford University employ a
single one of these schemes without
