# California to Choose Question.
## 
### 
A meeting was held Saturday at
the California Hotel in the city be
tween representatives of Stanford
and the University of California at
which final arrangements for the
Intercollegiate debate were per
fected. Stanford won the tosß, and
the choice of a question therefore
again falls to California, which
must submit one by February 25th.
Stanford will then be given until
March 4th to select the side it
wishes to defend. The debate will
be held at the Alhambra Theater
in San Francisco on April 15th, the
night of the field-day. Judges will
be chosen later by the faculty com
mittees of the two universities.
The question of having campus
debates was again discussed, and
the California representatives ex
pressed themselves, as they have in
the past, as being against the
change. However, as the agree
ment concerning intercollegiate de
bates expires with this debate, a
change in the present system may
be expected next year.
J. F. English, '02, F. Roehr, '04,
and W. L. Blair, '05, represented
Stanford, and E. C. Nathan, F. P.
Griffiths, and E. C. Baker acted for
California.
