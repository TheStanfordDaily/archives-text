# Speaks of Christian Missions.
## 
### 
The Sunday morning sermon in
Memorial Church at 11 o'clock
was preached by Rev. D. Charles
Gardner. The subject was "Chris
tian Missions." Mr. Gardner em
phasized the importance of the
great missionary movement among
the Christian peoples, and pointed
out that the opposition to it was
caused by apathy or misunder
standing of its true motive. As a
remedy for this he advised a wider
study of church history, especially
during the first three centuries of
its existence, when it spread
throughout all Europe. In con
clusion he pointed out the great
good that has been done by the
modern missions in uplifting the
savage and ignorant races.
