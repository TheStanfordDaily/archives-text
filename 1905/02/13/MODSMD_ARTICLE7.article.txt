# Orchestra Planning a Trip.
## 
### 
Arrangements are being made by
the Orchestra for a trip to Camp
bell on Washington's birthday.
The cordial reception was ex
tended to the organization last year
while in Campbell. Owing to this
projected trip frequent practices
will be necessary, the next practice
being at 7:30 o'clock Wednesday,
February 15th, in the chapel. A
bass player is needed in the Orches
tra, and anyone wishing to try out
for that position may make ar
rangements with Manager Thorpe.
