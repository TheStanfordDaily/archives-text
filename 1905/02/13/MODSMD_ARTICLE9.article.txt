# Full Rehearsal of Play Held.
## 
### 
The first full rehearsal of "Every
Man in His Humour" was held
Saturday night, and the entire cast
came together for the first time.
E. 0. James, '02, who is to take the
part of Justice Clement, came from
Pacific Grove especially for the re
hearsal, and his work in the fifth
act, where the jUßtice clearß up the
difficulties on which the plot is
based, promises to be a feature of
the performance.
Through an oversight in an
nouncing the final selection of the
notice was given of the
character of Downright. The part
is to be taken by A. Peterson, '07,
who has already done good work
on the Stanford stage, especially as
Faulklarid in the recent production
of "The Rivals." He also took
part in "Hamlet."
