A small news item informs us
that on Saturday the last patient
in the Students' Guild Hospital
was given a clean bill of health
and allowed to go, leaving the in
stitution empty save for the regu
larly employed staff. This inter
esting piece of information leads
one to speculate on how long such
an ideal condition might continue
to exist if some of the peculiar
practices of the Japanese janitors
about the quadrangle and the
halls were corrected. One of these
practices is the too frequent sweep
ing of the broad arcades during the
hours of the morning when classes
are in session and hundreds of stu
dents are passing back and forth,
avoiding as best they may the
clouds of dust and dirt raised by
the brooms of the nonchalant Ori
entals. The practice is dangerous
and disagreeable, and one which
might readily be stopped. In this
connection, too, it is unpleasant to
be compelled to resort to the lava
tories of the quadrangle to wash
"the dust from eyes and ears, for it
is generally impossible to make use
of the towels, which the same jani
tors allow to hang for many days,
so that they are entirely unpresent
able. Again, where is the excuse
for the existence of the pile of tin
cans, cardboard boxes, and other
Tubbish of many kinds which
stands but a few yards from the
back windows of Encina Hall, the
lower part immersed in dirty water,
the upper part frequently smoulder
ing—a signal fire to attract the at
tention of the visitor who passes
within a few feet of the unhealth
ful and unsightly mess, a monu
ment to indolence, and a menace
to the health of the University?
We have too m n ch sickness around
here now which we cannot prevent
to permit the existence of causes
which may be swept away by a
word.
