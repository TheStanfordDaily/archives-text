Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Since a Senior has seen fit to
publish an unsigned communica
tion on his conception of the pro
posed Christian Association build
ings, we should like to correct
certain misunderstandings.
The careful statement concerning
the four uses to which the build
ings are to be put might be an
swered after the manner of Agassiz
when his students described a lob
ster as "a red fish that walks back
wards." Agassiz replied that the
answer was correct in all but three
particulars: the lobster is not a
fish, it is not red, and it does not
walk backwards. It is not the in
tention to use the buildings either
as a gymnasium or as a place for
Sunday services. The University
has provided amply for even the
most enthusiastic gymnast. Me
morial Church supplies all possible
needs in the way of Sunday ser
vices, and the associations are
doing all in their power to assist
the University pastor in his work.
The real object of the buildings
is to meet the same needs that are
covered by precisely similar build
ings in all the great universities of
the country. Cornell has expended
seventy thousand dollars on her
association buildings, and Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, and Columbia
nearly as much. And all this in
spite of the fact that these institu
tions have gymnasia and empty
class-rooms as well as Stanford.
The building committee is in pos
session of statements from the pres
idents of these universities heartily
approving of the buildings and
their work.
As to the need of educational
classes, there seems to be rather a
"dim appreciation" of the situa
tion. Perhaps the correspondent
is not aware of the fact that the
association is conducting English
classes for the Japanese boys on
the campus and in Palo Alto; that
these classes are growing in impor
tance; and that better accommoda
tions are needed. For example,
one of the divisions is compelled to
meet in a little room in the base
ment of Kncina instead of in a
comfortable and attractive room
such as they should have. One of
our prominent professors is con
ducting his Bible class in a cold
room on the quad, where the un
comfortable surroundings seriously
decrease the size and effectiveness
of the class. This same lack of at
tractive meeting-places constantly
hampers the work of the social ser
vice committees in providing for
needy students.
Concerning the desirability of
reading-rooms, if the correspondent
had entered the University a year
sooner he would not have to be told
that a little reading-room in"The
Camp"was much appreciated in
spite of the fact that it was neither
well heated nor lighted, that the
University Library contained
eighty thousand volumes and a
well-selected list of magazines, and
that the Encina club-room was
open then as now.
Much more important than any
of the four uses suggested by the
Senior for the new buildings will
be the club-room feature, which
will provide cheerful quarters for
recreation for the large number of
students who are living in cold
little attic rooms on the campus,
in Palo Alto, and on the Terrace.
While we may attempt to "turn
the students' feet toward heaven,"

we do not advocate any short cuts
such as result from studying in an
unheated room, or by the radiant
glow of a six-candle-power oil stove.
The club-room of Encina is no
doubt open to every Stanford man,
but many who are living outside do
not presume to take advantage of
this good nature on the part of the
hall men. Those from Palo Alto
and near-by towns have no conve
nient place to put their lunch
baskets but the windows of the
quad, which we all agree with the
Chaparral is not the place for them.
The work of our social commit
tees is greatly hampered by the fact
that the fall reception to the in
coming class must be held in the
gymnasium, much to the incon
venience of the authorities there.
The reception to those entering at
Christmas has not been given for
the last two years owing to the fact
that the gymnasium is too cold at
this time. For the parties given
by the associations (and which
compose the only social life which
many students get while in the
University) we have had to impose
on our faculty friends for the use
of their homes. Nor can receptions
to visiting teams or speakers be
given, or provision be made for
their entertainment while here.
The correspondent proposes other
uses to be made of the money. It
must be remembered that this
money would not be given at all if
not for the association buildings, so
that we are in no sense robbing the
Associated Charities. The loan
fund is one of the features which
the association has already planned
for in its larger sphere of work. Be
sides this, our employment bureau
is able to find honest employment
for any needy student by which he
can help himself.
We have no permanent rooms on
the quad, in spite of assertions to
the contrary; and it is for that very
reason that we now plan these build
ings for ourselves, being assured by
Dr. Jordan that it is not the inten
tion or the place of the University
to provide any such quarters.
Perhaps, aB the Senior suggests,
the "grand old English virtue of
common sense has departed from
our midst," but he would include
more than he may think in his
statement, for no action whatever
has been taken by the associations
until the whole building scheme
was indorsed by the Advisory Board
of each, consisting of Dr. Jordan,
Rev. Mr. Gardner, Dr. Elliott, Pro
fessors Farrand, Murray, Alden and
Bassett, and G. E. Crothers of the
University Board of Trustees, for
the Y. M. C. A., and Mrs. R. H.
Green, Mrs. C. H. Gilbert, Mrs. O.
L. Elliott, Mrs. J. E. Matzke, Mrs.
A. T. Murray, Mrs. S. J. Barnett
and Mrs. J. L. Fowler, for the
Y. W. C. A.
