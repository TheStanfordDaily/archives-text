# BOOK WILL TELL OF PLAY.
## Articles About "Every Man in His Humour" Contained in English Club's Volume. 
### 
The booklet on " Every Man in
His Humour," which the English
Club is getting out to aid in the
general appreciation of its coming
presentation of the play, is now
practically completed, and the pub
lishers, Elder and Company of San
Francisco, expect to have it ready
for distribution within a week or
ten days. The book has been very
artistically gotten up on heavy
cream colored laid paper, and will
contain sixty pages of reading mat
ter, half-tones and drawings. The
contents have been arranged to in
clude articles that would add to a
better appreciation of a modern
presentation of the play.
The leading articles will be one
on "Elizabethan Humours," by
Professor It. M. Alden, and one on
"Jonson's Learned Sock," by Pro
fessor M. B. Anderson. Professor
Anderson treats of Jonson's pecu
liar style of humor, or "sock," upon
a true conception of which depends
to a large extent one's ability to en
joy a Jonsonian play. Still more
essential to a right appreciation of
the play is an understanding of
the term "Elizabethan humours,"
and in his article on this subject
Professor Alden explains the sig
nificance of this phrase as applied
to the play. Each one of the char
acters of "Every Man in His
Humour" is representative of some
particular "humour," or bent of
mind, generally some folly or foible
carried to excess. As the play is
throughout one of character rather
than of action, an appreciation of
these '"humours" will add to the
interest.
The frontispiece of the book will
be a picture of the Elizabethan
stage used in"The Knight of the
Burning Pestle," and the introduc
tion will include an account of the
English Club's previous undertak
ings, and its aims in presenting
Elizabethan dramas. Among the
illustrations will be a portrait of
Jonson, a picture of his famous
tomb in Westminster Abbey, with
the epitaph, "Oh, Rare Ben Jon
son," and a picture of the Globe
Theater, where the play was first
presented.
Together with an account of his
toric revivals of the play will be
printed pictures of famous actors
who have taken part in it. Among
these are Burbadge, the famous
tragedian of Shakspere's plays;
David Garrick, and Charles Dick
ens, an account of whose famous
amateur revival of the play in
1845 is printed entire from Fost
er's Biography. Jonson's own pro
logue to the play and the epilogue
written by the Earl of Dorset, in
his revival of the play after the
Restoration, will be printed, and
the commemoratory verses by Wal
ler, one of Jonson's contemporaries.
There will also be two satires of
the time, one on "A Paul's Man,"
such as represented in the play by
Captain Bobadil.
