# REUNION OF THE ALUMNI.
## Gathering of Graduates May Be Held at Time of Dedication of the Football Field. 
### 
A movement has been set on foot
for the holding of the decennial
alumni reunion in November at
the time of the dedication of Stan
ford's new athletic field when the
next intercollegiate football game
is played upon it. The idea was
first put before the University pub
lic by Dr. F. Angell, who spoke of
it at an assembly two years ago.
At the annual meeting of the
Alumni Association last spring
definite steps were taken for carry
ing out the plan. A large com
mittee of alumni members was ap
pointed, with C. M. Fickert, '98, as
chairman, to fix a date for the re
union. This committee has not
yet made a report, but it is ex
pected that it will favor the plan.
Fickert is at present in the East,
so that no definite action can
be taken until his return.
The idea first originated in a
plan to hold an alumni reunion &t
the decennial anniversary of the
class of '95. A proposal to hold
the 1905 reunion during commence
ment week has been advocated by
members of the clasßof '95. Should
the class of '95 decide to meet in
May, this gathering will not lessen
the interest in the greater reunion
in the fall. All those alumni who
have been approached with the
plan to meet in the fall have de
clared themselves to be strongly in
favor of the proposal.
A fall reunion, it is believed,
would have many advantages over
a reunion during commencement
week. Aside from the graduating
class, few members of the Univer
sity will be on the campus at that
time, and it is suggested that the
dedication of the new grounds will
be of greater interest to the major
ity of the alumni than the decen
nial anniversary of the graduation
of the class of '95. The intercol
legiate game will furnish better op
portunity for a demonstration of
college loyalty, which is the chief
object of the reunion.
