# STANFORD TO PLAY PENSACOLA
## Varsity Will Meet Men from the Naval Training Station To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
The Varsity will play a baseball
team composed of naval cadets
from Goat Island to-morrow at
3:30. The Pensacola team is com
posed of a number of the same men
that played football against the
Varsity last fall.
The cadets have played and de
feated the Spaulding team, which
was victorious over Califoania last
week. The personnel of the team
is not known here, but the nine is
reported to have a pitcher of more
than ordinary ability. The Var
sity line-up will not be decided
until to-morrow afternoon.
Stanford Defeats Visitors.
The Varsity baseball team de
feated the Clabrough-Golcher nine
yesterday by the score of 6 to 5 in
a game full of errors and erratic
playing. This is the first victory
of the season for the Varsity. The
Clabrough-Golcher team led up to
the eighth inning, when by a bat
ting rally Stanford tied the score.
The winning run was forced in,
Parker hitting Trowbridge with
the bases full in the ninth inning.
Although yesterday's game was
characterized by poor playing, the
Varsity showed improvement at
the bat, only four men striking out.
Stanford succeeded in getting four
safe hits and the Clabrough-Gol
cher team but three. Summary:
