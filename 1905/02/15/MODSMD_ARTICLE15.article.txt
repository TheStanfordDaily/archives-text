## All Entries Must Be Made With Secretary of the Club Before Monday Night. 
### 
Interest in tennis Ims increased
with the good weather of the past
few days, and the courts have been
in constant übo. The players are
practicing regularly for the singles
tournament, which will be held
next Wednesday, February 22d.
All entries for this tournament
must be handed in to J. F. Cassell,
'07, secretary of the Tennis Club,
before Monday night. Tennis Club
dues must also be paid when the
entries are presented. It is posi
tively announced that no entries
will be received later than Monday
night.
There will be two singles tourna
ments held for the purpose of choos
ing an intercollegiate tennis repre
sentative. The second tournament
will be begun as soon as possible
after the completion of the contest
which will begin next Wednesday.
G. A. Hodge, '06, captain of the
tennis team, will not enter these
two singles tournaments, but will
play a round-robin tournament
with the two winners of these con
tests. This method is considered
the best to give all players an equal
chance. Only two of the courts can
be used for next Wednesday's tour
nament, but these are in excellent
condition. If there is no rain in
the meantime the tournament
should be played very rapidly.
The committee appointed to draw
up a constitution for the club met
last night. A constitution was
drafted which will be submitted at
the next meeting of the Tennis
Club.
