# Basket-ball Prospects Poor.
## 
### 
If prospects do not brighten con
siderably, Stanford will not be rep
resented at all in basket-ball this
year. There is an unusually small
amount of material available, and
such men as might enter this work
are busy on the track or diamond.
Last semester, when a call was
issued by the gymnasium authori
ties for basket-ball, hardly enough
men to form two teams responded.
This showing alone is not encour
aging, but when it is further con
sidered that the present crowded
condition of Encina gymnasium
makes regular indoor practice im
possible, it is evident that the
chances for any kind of team are
very poor.
H. \V. Chappel, gymnasium in
structor, is in receipt of a letter
from the Oakland High School
asking for a game or series of
games. Unless the Basket-ball As
sociation takes some action to re
vive interest in this sport, this
challenge, as all future ones, will
be refused.
