# STANFORD'S TRACK PROSPECTS GOOD.
## New Material Brought in by the Freshman Class Expected to Compensate Partly for Losses of Old Men. 
### 
THE track season is now far
enough advanced to give some
definite idea of the relative strength
of the two teams which will strug
gle for supremacy in the annual
intercollegiate field-day on April
15th. A comparison of the two
teams made at the present time is
distinctly favorable to Stanford's
chances. Unless unforeseen acci
dents intervene, the Cardinal
ought to win the coming meet by a
good margin. By graduation and
the operation of the four-year rule
the Varsity has lost men who were
good for forty points last year, but
this loss is partially compensated
for by an abundance of good track
material brought in by the class of
'08.
In the sprints Stanford is com
pelled to rely on men who have
never been on a Varsity team be
fore. Perhaps the most promising
of these is E. C. Cope, '08, whose
preparatory school records remain
unbeaten; but there is a possibility
that this athlete may be unable to
compete in the intercollegiate meet
on account of an injured ankle.
Other sprinters with good prepara
tory school records are P. A. Wood,
'07, and R. Gartzmann, '08. A. H.
Friedman, '08, who won the 100-
yard dash in Saturday's meet, gives
promise of becoming a good man
in that event. In the short dashes
California has Snedigar, a ten-sec
ond performer, and Schwartz, a
freshman with a good record in
the Academic Athletic League.
In the 440-yard dash Stanford
has lost Dunn and Crossman, but
a number of good men are making
a bid for their places. Among
these are A. C. Freeman, '06, L.
M. Edwards, '07, and P. M. Davis,
'08. These candidates have all
done excellent work this season,
but with additional training and
experience they ought to improve
materially before the date of the
intercollegiate meet. California
will be represented by Howard and
Wilcox. Kern is not in college
this semester.
For the half-mile run there is an
abundance of material with such
old men as Bounds,'os, Russell,'o6,
and the new aspirants, Miller, '08,
and Knupp, '07. California is
counting on Edwards and Mishler
to take places in this event, with
De Mamiel and Yost as possibili
ties.
The mile is generally conceded
to Miller,'oB,who won this event last
year in the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation meet from the best milers on
the Coast. The other mile men on
the squad are a comparatively un
known quantity. California will
place her chief reliance on New
hall, Meals, and Lyons in this
race.
Perhaps the most encouraging
feature of the season thus far is the
good work of two-mile runners.
Stanford has always been weak in
this event, but this year it seems
practically certain that the Cardi

nal will get a place, and the hope
of first is not unreasonable. L. G.
Burr, '05, who ran a trial in 10:40
recently, is the most promising two
mile candidate. Waring, '05, and
Nash, '07, are both doing good
work in the long distance. Cap
tain Hackley, Moody, and Lyons
are California's best performers in
this event.
With the return of \V. H. Lana
gan to college, Stanford ought to
take first place in both hurdles.
Weller, '07, Macfarland, '07, and
Horton, '08, will make a strong bid
for the other places over the
hurdles. California has Meany,
Frei and Golcher picked as her
best performers.
Stanford has lost West, '06, in
the broad jump, but with Bell, '05,
and Weller, '07, she ought to hold
her own against Snedigar and
Neighbor, who are California's
most promising broad jumpers.
In the high jump Bell, '05, and
Dehy, '05, are doing the most
promising work at present.
Hickey and probably Boynton will
be California's leading representa
tives in this event.
With Lanagan, '08, vaulting
over eleven feet, and Bell, '05, and
Whitaker, '05, in form, Stanford
stands a good chance of taking all
three places in the pole-vault.
Wilcox and Symmes are not in
college this semester, leaving Os
trander as California's sole reliance
in this event.
In the weights Stanford expects
to win at least two places with
Crawford, '05, Weller,'o7, and Hor
ton, '08, entered. California has
good weight men in Sperry. Zacha
rias and Gilmore.
Classes to Contest Again.
As last Saturday's meet was to a
considerable extent unsatisfactory
on account of the poor shape of the
track and the relatively small
number of entries, another field
day of the same kind will be held
next Saturday morning. The
classes of'o6 and'oB are satisfied
that they can regain their lost
laurels, while the odd-numbered
classes are confident that they can
increase the lead which they have
over their rivals. It is probable
that the full distance will be run
in all of the races.
The track management announce
that candidates for the team will
not be permitted to attend any
dances after the Encina "at home"
without special permission from
Trainer Moulton. The track men
are also prohibited from indulging
in impromptu dancing or rough
play after February 18th.

her own against Snedigar and
Neighbor, who are California's
most promising broad jumpers.
In the high jump Bell, '05, and
Dehy, '05, are doing the most
promising work at present.
Hickey and probably Boynton will
be California's leading representa
tives in this event.
With Lanagan, '08, vaulting
over eleven feet, and Bell, '05, and
Whitaker, '05, in form, Stanford
stands a good chance of taking all
three places in the pole-vault.
Wilcox and Symmes are not in
college this semester, leaving Os
trander as California's sole reliance
in this event.
In the weights Stanford expects
to win at least two places with
Crawford, '05, Weller,'o7, and Hor
ton, '08, entered. California has
good weight men in Sperry. Zacha
rias and Gilmore.
Classes to Contest Again.
As last Saturday's meet was to a
considerable extent unsatisfactory
on account of the poor shape of the
track and the relatively small
number of entries, another field
day of the same kind will be held
next Saturday morning. The
classes of'o6 and'oB are satisfied
that they can regain their lost
laurels, while the odd-numbered
classes are confident that they can
increase the lead which they have
over their rivals. It is probable
that the full distance will be run
in all of the races.
The track management announce
that candidates for the team will
not be permitted to attend any
dances after the Encina "at home"
without special permission from
Trainer Moulton. The track men
are also prohibited from indulging
in impromptu dancing or rough
play after February 18th.
THE track season is now far
enough advanced to give some
definite idea of the relative strength
of the two teams which will strug
gle for supremacy in the annual
intercollegiate field-day on April
15th. A comparison of the two
teams made at the present time is
distinctly favorable to Stanford's
chances. Unless unforeseen acci
dents intervene, the Cardinal
ought to win the coming meet by a
good margin. By graduation and
the operation of the four-year rule
the Varsity has lost men who were
good for forty points last year, but
this loss is partially compensated
for by an abundance of good track
material brought in by the class of
'08.
In the sprints Stanford is com
pelled to rely on men who have
never been on a Varsity team be
fore. Perhaps the most promising
of these is E. C. Cope, '08, whose
preparatory school records remain
unbeaten; but there is a possibility
that this athlete may be unable to
compete in the intercollegiate meet
on account of an injured ankle.
Other sprinters with good prepara
tory school records are P. A. Wood,
'07, and R. Gartzmann, '08. A. H.
Friedman, '08, who won the 100-
yard dash in Saturday's meet, gives
promise of becoming a good man
in that event. In the short dashes
California has Snedigar, a ten-sec
ond performer, and Schwartz, a
freshman with a good record in
the Academic Athletic League.
In the 440-yard dash Stanford
has lost Dunn and Crossman, but
a number of good men are making
a bid for their places. Among
these are A. C. Freeman, '06, L.
M. Edwards, '07, and P. M. Davis,
'08. These candidates have all
done excellent work this season,
but with additional training and
experience they ought to improve
materially before the date of the
intercollegiate meet. California
will be represented by Howard and
Wilcox. Kern is not in college
this semester.
For the half-mile run there is an
abundance of material with such
old men as Bounds,'os, Russell,'o6,
and the new aspirants, Miller, '08,
and Knupp, '07. California is
counting on Edwards and Mishler
to take places in this event, with
De Mamiel and Yost as possibili
ties.
The mile is generally conceded
to Miller,'oB,who won this event last
year in the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation meet from the best milers on
the Coast. The other mile men on
the squad are a comparatively un
known quantity. California will
place her chief reliance on New
hall, Meals, and Lyons in this
race.
Perhaps the most encouraging
feature of the season thus far is the
good work of two-mile runners.
Stanford has always been weak in
this event, but this year it seems
practically certain that the Cardi

nal will get a place, and the hope
of first is not unreasonable. L. G.
Burr, '05, who ran a trial in 10:40
recently, is the most promising two
mile candidate. Waring, '05, and
Nash, '07, are both doing good
work in the long distance. Cap
tain Hackley, Moody, and Lyons
are California's best performers in
this event.
With the return of \V. H. Lana
gan to college, Stanford ought to
take first place in both hurdles.
Weller, '07, Macfarland, '07, and
Horton, '08, will make a strong bid
for the other places over the
hurdles. California has Meany,
Frei and Golcher picked as her
best performers.
Stanford has lost West, '06, in
the broad jump, but with Bell, '05,
and Weller, '07, she ought to hold
her own against Snedigar and
Neighbor, who are California's
most promising broad jumpers.
In the high jump Bell, '05, and
