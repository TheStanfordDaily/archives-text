# SEEKING A REGATTA COURSE.
## Stanford Crews Refuse to Row on the Oakland Estuary.—May Go to Stockton. 
### 
The intercollegiate regatta will
not be held on the Oakland estu
ary. This is the decision of those
who have the Stanford interests in
charge. The water on this course
is always rough, and it is the course
over which the California crews
practice. The Stanford crews prac
tice on calm waters, and would
therefore be under a great disad
vantage.
As a result of this decision on the
part of the Stanford managers, a
new course is being looked for.
There are several under considera
tion, but the one which at present
seems the most desirable is a course
at Stockton. Manager Barrett and
President Butterfield of the Boat
Club vißited Stockton last week
and reported that the facilities for
rowing there are good. There is a
straightaway course two and one
half miles long where the water is
always calm. The slough is 150
feet wide, and a good road runs be
side it, which would enable sight
seers in vehicles to view the race
from start to finish. The race
could also be viewed from launches
following in the rear of the shells.
The only apparent difficulty in
carrying out the r»lan is in furnish
ing means for students to get to
and from the contest. There have
been several plans proposed. One
is to charter a boat, which would
make the trip from Redwood City
or San Francisco to Stockton dur
ing the night. In this way a large
body of students could be carried
at a reasonable rate. The trip
could l)e made by train from San
Francisco for $1.50 for the round
trip.
While at Stockton Butterfield
examined two barges that are
owned by the Stockton Athletic
Club, which has given up boating.
These are four-oared boats in good
condition, and may be purchased
by the club. There are at present
about fifty men out for work, and
the two practice boats on hand are
not sufficient to accommodate all
the men.
