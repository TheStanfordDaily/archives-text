The meeting of the Training
House Corporation two weeks from
Saturday will mark the beginning
of the serious work of that body,
and the first task to be undertaken
is the reorganization of the direc
torate itself. The men who have
been elected directors of the corpor
ation during the past few years are
now scattered over State and coun
try. It has long been impossible
to hold a meeting of the full board,
and the work has been handicapped
to some extent for this reason.
With their active work about to
begin, the directors have faced the
situation squarely and have de
cided to put themselves on a work
ing basis. The whole body will be
removed at the coming meeting,
and only who are located
close enough to the University to
attend regularly the sessions of the
board will be re-elected. To fill the
vacancies other men will be nomi
nated by the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students. When
these changes have been accom
plished, the students will see an
active, earnest body carrying out
the plans that mean so much to
the future of Stanford athletics.
