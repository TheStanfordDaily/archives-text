## 
### 
The executive committee of the
Associated Students of the Univer
sity of California last night ratified
the new intercollegiate agreement,
recently drawn up by the repre
sentatives of California and Stan
ford. The only clause in the agree
ment over which there was any
discussion was that relating to the
employment of professional coaches.
Captain Force of next year's var
sity urged that the agreement be
ratified at once,so that negotiations
may be opened with some good
Eastern coach. After a lengthy
discussion the agreement was rati
fied, Colonel Edwards, the faculty
representative, alone dissenting.
