# West Point Athletic Expenses.
## 
### 
The recent report of the Army
Athletic Association shows that a
very small amount of money was
expended for athletics at West
Point during the last year, when
the amount is compared with ex
penses of large colleges throughout
the country. All the expenses of
the West Point teams are paid by
subscriptions, no admission being
charged to the various games. The
total expenses amounted to $11,482,
of which $2,455 went as guarantees
to visiting teams, and $1,710 for
coaches and their expenses. The
bill for coaching was distributed as
follows: Fencing, $451.99; baseball,
$394.72; football, $863.49.
During the last season the cadets
kept four football teams on the field
up to November 9th, and from this
squad was chosen the eleven that
defeated Yale. The expenses for
the season were met by subscription,
chiefly from cadets and officers.
When compared with the large
amount expended by Harvard dur
ing the last season, it will be seen
that it takes more than money to
turn out a winning team.
