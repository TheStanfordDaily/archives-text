The action of the Executive
Committee in retaining E. W.
Moulton as trainer for another two
years at an increased salary will
meet with the thorough approval
of the whole student body. It is a
well-deserved tribute to the ability
and character of the man, who dur
ing his years of work at Stanford
University has won the admiration
and esteem not only of the scores
of athletes whom he has trained j
but also of the hundreds of itu
dents with whom he has come into
contact. When we regard with
pleasure the general cleanliness of
Stanford athletics, we must give to
Moulton a goodly share of the
praise for the existence of that
spirit of decency. With the ad
vent of Moulton came a strict en
forcement of training rules, so that
men went into football games and
track meets in fit condition. A
violation of training rules, which
not many years ago was unfortu
nately not uncommon, has become
a very serious matter, the penalty
for which is dismissal from track
or oval in disgrace. This change
in sentiment has been largely ac
complished by the veteran trainer,
with the strong support of the ex
cellent captains that we have had
in recent years. The assurance that
for the next two years the track
and football men will be in the
hands of this able trainer is en
couraging and gratifying.
