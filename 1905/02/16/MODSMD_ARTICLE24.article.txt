# BANQUET OF LAW MEN.
## Plans for Reunion Discussed and Committees Named to Carry on the Work. 
### 
The Stanford Law Association
gathered at an informal banquet
last night at the Inn. The pur
pose of the meeting was to discuss
and formulate plans for the annual
reunion which is usually held in
May. After the dinner several of
those present were called upon to
respond to toasts, which brought
out the various phases of the re
union plans. The toasts in their
order were as follows: "The Gen
eral Character of University Exer
cises at the Close of the Semester,"
C. G. Atwood, '06; ''Importance of
All Law Students Remaining for
the Reunion," C. L. Firebaugh,'o4;
"Why Law Grads Should Return
for the Reunion," B. P. Oakford,
'02; "Features of Entertainment,"
E. C. Rittenhouse, '04; "Outline of
Work to Be Done," Professor Ab
bott. Besides these toasts, Profes
sor Lewers and the new law in
structor, H. W. Ballantine, spoke
on subjects relating to the re
union.
The main address was by Pro
fessor Abbott, and in his talk he
gave an outline of what had been
accomplished by the association in
its last two meetings. The general
nature of the next reunion will be
about the same as in the past. Be
side the usual business meeting,
there will be an address by a
prominent speaker, followed by a
reception and banquet.
The regular speeches of the eve
ning were made on the supposition
that the reunion would be held at
the regular time in May, at which
time there would be an unusually
large number of people on the cam
pus because of the alumni reunion.
Professor Lewers stated, however,
that there was a possibility of the
alumni reunion being held next
fall. He also informed those pres
ent that as Dr. Abbott had recently
been elected president of the Associ
ation of American Law Schools, he
might not be able to be present at
a reunion in May because of the
meeting of this body in the East at
the same time. The idea of hold
ing the reunion when the alumni
meet was considered by all a good
one, but it was the unanimous
opinion that the big law day which
is planned should be held only at
a time when Dr. Abbott can be
present. The final selection of the
day for the law reunion was there
fore not fixed. Another meeting of
the association will be called to de
cide this as soon as the plans of the
alumni reunion committee are defi
nitely completed and the date of
Professor Abbott's departure for
the East is known.
Rittenhouse gave a brief outline
of the features of entertainment
proposed, and named the chair
man of the committees which will
have the matter in charge. The
committees are as follows: Pro
gram, Professor Abbott; decoration,
C. W. Weiser, '02; reception, P. K.
Funke, '05; banquet, DeL. Lewis,
'04; music, O. C. Spencer, '04, and
H. L. Dearing, '06.
