# No Organ Recital To-day.
## 
### 
Signor Polacco, who was to have
given an organ recital in Memorial
Church this morning, failed to
come down from San Francisco. A
large audience had gathered at the
church, many of the professors ex
cusing their classes a little before
the end of the hour in order that
that they might not be disap
pointed. I)r. Blodgett rendered a
short program.
