# MOULTON ENGAGED AGAIN
## Veteran Trainer Will Condition Stanford Athletes for Two Years Longer. 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee last night Trainer E. W.
Moulton was again engaged to con
dition Stanford athletes. The new
contract calls for two years of ser
vice, and increases the salary of the
veteran trainer from $1350 to $1500
a year.
"Dad" Moulton, as he is most
familiarly known, came to Stanford
from Notre Dame five years ago.

He was born in Minneapolis in
1849. During his younger days lie
was a celebrated professional sprin
ter, running over three hundred
races, of which he lost only four.
Forsaking the cinder-path, Moulton
became a trainer, turning his atten
tion at first to the development of
professional sprinters. Later he
trained several well known pugilists
and bicycle riders. During the de
cade which preceded his first en
gagement by Stanford he had
charge of the football and track
teams of several educational insti
tutions of the Middle West. Among
these were the State universities of
Michigan, Minnesota Wisconsin,
and lowa, Vanderbilt University,
and the College of Notre Dame.
Among the many noted amateurs
developed under Moulton's tutelage
have been J. V. Crum, the famous
lowa sprinter; Kranzlein, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania hurdler and
broad jumper; and John McPher
son, once world's champion shot
putter. During his stay at Stan
ford Moulton has developed a
world's champion pole-vaulter in
N. E. Dole, and an American inter
collegiate champion shot-putter in
0. E. Hyde.
To-day Trainer Moulton received
a contract from Pacific University,
of Forest Grove, Oregon, offering
him a place as coach of the track
team of that college from April
23d to June 12th. It is probable
that the offer will be accepted if a
leave of absence can be procured
from Stanford. Late last spring
Moulton coached Willamette Uni
versity.
