# MRS. STANFORD GOES ABROAD.
## Seeks the Warmer Climate of Japan While Recovering from Her Recent Illness. 
### 
Mrs. Stanford sailed from San
Francisco yesterday on the steam
ship Korea for Japan. She is ac
companied by Miss Berner. On
account of her recent illness Mrs.
Stanford's physician ordered her
to a warmer climate during her
convalesence, and as she is fond of
Japan, she has chosen that coun
try as her destination.
Mre. Stanford's recent illness be
gan in a severe cold which devel
oped into an attack of tonsilitis.
Thinking to escape the cold and
damp of San Francisco, she went to
San Jose, where she remained for a
short time. Then, feeling better,
she returned to San Francisco, in
tending to accompany President
and Mrs. Jordan on their trip to
Southern California. She was
forced to abandon this idea owing
to a slight relapse, and until her
departure for Japan yesterday she
has been confined to her San Fran
cisco home.
How long Mrs. Stanford will re
main in Japan is not known.
