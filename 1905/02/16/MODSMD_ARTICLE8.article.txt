### 
Coach Cowden has announced
that the baseball men will be re
quired to observe the same strin
gent training rules which govern
the conduct of the track men dur
ing training Beason. Until last
year, at which time mild training
rules were enforced for a short per
iod, the Stanford baseball squad
has never been compelled to sub
mit to the regulations in regard to
training which have governed
other teams.
It is expected that the observ
ance of training rules will greatly
increase the efficiency of the play
ers on the squad. Trainer Moulton
will devote a portion of his time to
looking after the physical well
