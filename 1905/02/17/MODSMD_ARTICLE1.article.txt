# DR. JORDAN ON AGREEMENT.
## President Makes Statement Regarding Employment of Professional Coaches. 
### 
An article to the effect that
President Jordan has made a state
ment that "if the agreement to
allow professional coaches in foot
ball goes into effect, he (Dr. Jor
dan) will prohibit the playing of
football at Stanford." appeared in
one of the San Francisco morning
papers. There is no official author
ity for the statement that Dr. Jor
dan will take this drastic action.
In an interview to-day Dr. Jor
dan said:
"It is true, however, that I am
unalterably oppoaed to the employ
ment of professional outside coaches
in football. I should very much
prefer to see the intercollegiate
football dropped than to return to
the conditions of a few years ago,
where outsiders hired to win games
directed our athletic affairs.
"The purpose of football is not to
organize a team to win regardless
of other considerations. Its func
tion is that of honorable sport in
which decent men do the best they
can for their college colors, do it
decently, and let it go at that."
The story which appeared in the
San Francisco paper makes the
following statements:
"The cause of the whole trouble
is the old graduate coach question.
In the agreement which went into
effect four years ago professional
and Eastern coaches were barred.
This agreement expired on Decem
ber 31st. Then the intercollegiate
committee met and drew up a new
agreement. The Stanford repre
sentatives did not hold out for the
graduate coach system. Stanford
had been very successful in her
graduate coaches, while Berkeley
had not. So the Stanford men,
wishing to show the Berkeley men
all courtesy possible, decided to
allow the different colleges to choose
any coach they saw fit, graduate or
Eastern. It is understood that
President Jordan is opposed to
anything but the graduate coach
system, and it may be that there
will be no football at Stanford if
the agreement is ratified in its
present form. President Wheeler
and Colonel Edwards opposed the
ratification at Berkeley yesterday,
but the association passed it over
their heads."
While Dr. Jordan is strongly op
posed to the ratification of the new
athletic agreement recently adopted
by the Intercollegiate Athletic
Committee, his words indicate that
he will not interfere if the agree
ment is ratified by the Stanford
Executive Committee. The agree
ment must be acted upon by the
Stanford committee before the end
of next week.
