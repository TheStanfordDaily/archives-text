It is difficult to understand the
insistence of the debating man
agers of the University of Califor
that the Intercollegiate debate shall
be held in San Francisco. The
tendency in recent years has been
to confine college events to the
college campus, and so we have
brought all the sports 6ave rowing
to the grounds of the universities.
The Carnot debate is held upon
the campus, and it is for this very
reason that it commands more in
terest than does the Intercollegiate
contest. It is not easy to find a
single valid reason for continuing
to hold this one college event in
San Francisco. If the debate were
held on either campus on the eve
of the intercollegiate field-day it
would draw quite as large an audi
ence, perhaps a larger one, as it
does now in the city. The major
ity of those who are in San Fran
cisco on the night of the field-day,
whether they win or lose, are not
in a frame of mind to enjoy a de
bate, and consequently they do not
attend. But apart from all these
considerations, and greater than
any of them, iB the principle that
our activities should be confined to
college grounds. Next year a new
debating agreement mUBt be made
between Stanford and California,
and at that time we may hope to
see this principle insisted upon by
the men who will act for this Uni
versity.
