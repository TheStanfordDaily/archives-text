# NEW ISSUE OF THE "ALUMNUS."
## Editor Suggests the Preservation of "Dope Books" on all the College Activities. 
### 
February's Stanford Alumnus has
just been published, and it is well
up to the high standard of the pre
vious numbers of this year. The
issue contains a number of articles
on present conditions, and sugges
tions for future movements of the
student body. The editor urges
that the undergraduate and gradu
ate managers have a set of "dope
books" giving the real inside in
formation on Stanford football
strategy, the triumphs and trials of
the student body treasurers and
athletic managers, the editors of
the college papers, the managers
and leaders of the musical clubs,
the varsity debaters, and other per
sons who have represented Stanford
in its relations with other colleges.
The editor's idea is to have in this
book the various schemes and plays
used by the Varsity coaches, and
the best plans, ideas and warnings
against mistakes known to men
who have had experience in Stan
ford activities.
Another valuable suggestion in
this number is as follows: "Let
there be a cut repository in the
Stanford Library. Let every half
tone of a Stanford campus scene,
building, or group of collegians be
deposited in this repository after the
Quad, the Chaparral, the Alumnus,
or any other Stanford publication
has first used it." At present many
cuts are lost or destroyed which
would be valuable in the fu
ture.
A pioneer's comment on campus
conditions is very interesting, and
shows the changes made on the
campus since the pioneer class en
terred. C. S. Burns, '97, has con
tributed a unique story, entitled
"From the Diary of a Young Engi
neer," which gives the professional
experiences of the firm of Burns
and McDonnell in attaining a pro
fessional reputation. The Pacific
States Tennis Association's rating
of the best players on the Pacific
coast, and an article on the Stan
ford colony at Spokane, appear in
thisis√üue. An article headed "Some
Principles that Govern Stanford
University" gives some of the rules
and guiding clauses that have been
laid down by Mrs. Stanford and
the Board of Trustees with regard
to the governing policy of the Uni
versity.
