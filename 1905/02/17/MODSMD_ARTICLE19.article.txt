# PETITION FOR GOLF LINKS.
## Trustees Asked to Again Grant Grounds for the Playing of the Game. 
### 
A petition signed by over one
hundred members of the Univer
sity and twelve members of the
faculty will come up before the
next meeting of the Board of Trus
tees asking for the regranting of
the University property formerly
held by the Stanford Golf Club,
and used by it as golf links. The
movement has been set on foot by
a number of prominent members
of the faculty, among whom are
Dr. Frank Angell, Professor H. R.
Fairclough, and Rev. 1). Charles
Gardner, all of whom are interested
in the reinstatement of the game of
golf at Stanford.
The history of golf at the Uni
versity dates back to about five
years ago, when the Stanford Golf
Club was organized, and received a
lease of the land lying between the
Cooksey and Lathrop residences,
which for two years it used as golf
links. In 1902, however, the Uni
versity refused to renew the lease,
and as a result the Golf Club
passed out of existence. The pres
ent petition asks for a renewal of
the lease.
In asking that the grant be
made, the petition states that
there are present a large number of
people on the campus who are de
sirous of playing golf, but are with
out present means of doing so.
Conditions at Stanford are ideal
for golf playing, and it is greatly
hoped that the trustees will act
favorably on the petition.
