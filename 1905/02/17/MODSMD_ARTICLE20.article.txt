# Handball Tournament Planned.
## 
### 
H. \V. Chappel, instructor in the
Gymnasium, has appointed the fol
lowing committee to arrange hand
ball practices and tournaments for
the award of the Storey champion
ship belt: C. L. Duncan, '04, L. G.
Burr, '05, and M. C. Sherwood, '05.
In accordance with the restriction
made by the donor of the belt, no
one will be eligible for the cham
pionship competition who is not
registered for work in the Gym
nasium. The belt has been won
three times already: twice by \V.
F. Dunn, '04, and once by G.
Cromwell, '04, who now holds the
belt. Neither of these men is in
college now. The committee will
make definite plans for practices
and tournaments in the near
future.
