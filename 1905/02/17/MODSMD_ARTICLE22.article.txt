# Talks of Department Stores.
## 
### 
E. M. Hecht of the Emporium of
San Francisco spoke before the

clasß in Economics 1 in the chapel
this morning on department store
organization. He dealt with the
organization of a large corporation
in all its relations and told the
duties and responsibilities of all of
the officers from general manager
to salesman. He said that each
department was a store in itself,
being charged and credited on the
books of the corporation so that at
any time an exact showing could
be made. The plan of aub-letting
the departments was shown to be
very unsuccessful and the present
"one-management" system much
superior. The mechanism and rou
tine by which orders were placed
and goods received and put be
fore the public was clearly ex
plained, and the great importance
of the advertising manager, who in
the modern department store mußt
be a man of a great deal of origi
nality was emphasized.
