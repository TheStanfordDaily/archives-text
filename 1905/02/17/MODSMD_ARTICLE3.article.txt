# J.F. LANAGAN TO COACH FOR THREE YEARS IN FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL.
## Will Give Up His Position at Belmont to Come to Stanford. Will Receive a Salary of Two Thousand Dollars a Year and Make an Annual Trip East. 
### 
JAMES F. LANAGAN, '00, has
been practically secured to
coach the football and baseball
teams for the next three years.
The contract has not yet been
signed, but the terms have been
agreed upon in the most essential
parts, and there is not likely to be
any difficulty over the details that
yet remain unsettled.
By the termß of the instrument
drawn up by the Executive Com
mittee, Lanagan agrees to coach
the Varsity football and baseball
teams for a period of three years at
a salary of $2,000 per annum. It
is further provided that the coach
shall devote all of his time to the
development of the teams, and this
will necessitate Lanagan's retire
ment from his position as a teacher
at the Belmont School where he is
engaged at present. The $2,000
salary will in a measure compen
sate him for the sacrifice of his
present position. It is also stip
ulated that the coach shall be al
lowed to make an annual trip East
for the purpose of studying football
conditions and methods in vogue
there. The expense of these annual
trips will be borne by the Associated
Students. It is probable that the
Eastern visit will occur each year
immediately after the annual inter
collegiate game, in order that the
coach may witness the Harvard-
Yale game and other important
contests which take place after the
Stanford-California game.
If the present plans are carried

out Lanagan will be aided in hie
football coaching by volunteer as
sistants, who will receive necessary
expenses but no salary.
James F. Lanagan graduated
with the class of 1900. He played
full-back on his Freshman football
team, but his career as an active
player on the gridiron was cut short
by his physician's orders. Later he
became Varsity pitcher, and in the
box he made a brilliant record. Two
years Lanagan was engaged as head
football coach chiefly on his reputa
tion as a disciplinarian. His knowl
edge of the game was a revelation
to all. With five veterans as the
nucleus for a team he developed
one which held California's veteran
eleven down in a 6 to G tie game.
This year he developed what was
probably the best team that has
ever represented Stanford on the
gridiron.
