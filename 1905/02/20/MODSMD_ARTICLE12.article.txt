# MRS. STANFORD POISONED.
## Alleged Attempt on the Life of the Surviving Founder of the University. 
### 
The San Francisco papers print
a story to the effect that Mrs. Stan
ford's life was sought by poison
eome time last month. On Janu
ary 14th Mrs. Stanford drank a
glass of mineral water and imme
diately detected a bitter taste.
Subsequent testing of the water, it
is stated, showed that strychnine
had been dissolved in the bottle
from which the water was taken.
A powerful emetic was adminis
tered with satisfactory results.
Detectives have been detailed on
the case, but no developments
have occurred. After the incident
Mrs. Stanford left her California
street home and took rooms at the
Hotel Vendome, San Jose. Later
she stayed at the St. Francis in
San Francisco, and last Thursday
sailed for Japan.
The incident was kept quiet for
more than a month in the hope
that the detectives might quietly
solve the mystery. Two weeks
after Mrs. Stanford had drunk of
the poisoned water, her maid,
Lizzie Richmond, was discharged.
No attempt has been made to im
plicate any one, but suspicions
based on the slightest foundations
have been sifted to the bottom.
