### 
The Kncina "at home," which
was held Saturday night, proved
to be a complete success. There
were about one hundred and forty
couples on the floor, and the dance
was thoroughly enjoyed by jill.
The club-room was decorated in a
new style which proved very effec
tive. Green and yellow streamers
were strung from each side of the
room, and, meeting in the center
formed a graceful arch the length
of the hall. The electric lights
were covered with colored paper,
which added to the general artistic
effect.
