# AIDED FROM CARNEGIE FUND.
## Four Stanford Men Pursuing Scientific Investigations with Help of the Institution. 
### 
In the year-book of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington for 1904,
which has just appeared, are con
tained the reports of four Stanford
men, two of them professors and
two graduates, who are carrying
on research work under liberal en
dowments granted them by the in
stitution. The official records of
the institution show that these en
dowments amount to $11,950.
Of the four endowments, that
held by Dr. Ewald Fliigel, head of
the Philology department of the
University, is the largest, amount
ing to $7,500. Dr. Fliigel's work is
the compilation of a dictionary or
lexicon for the works of Chaucer,
and will require about three years
for completion, during which he
will be compelled to spend a part
of the time in Europe. No such
dictionary has ever been published,
and in the report printed in the
year-book the comprehensive na
ture of the undertaking is apparent.
Professor W. F. Durand, head of
the Engineering department, holds
an endowment from the institution
amounting to $4,120, which he re
ceived two years ago while at the
head of Sibley College of Engineer
ing at Cornell University, for"the
purpose of making a series of ex
periments on ship resistance and
propulsion. The specific problem
presented was an investigation of
the performances of screw-propel
lors, based on the observation of
models. Forty-nine different kinds
of propellors were examined, and
as a result ten thousand varied
computations will appear when the
final report is handed in.
The two other endowments are
of smaller amounts in more re
stricted lines of scientific work.
The holders are Professor S. J. Bar
nett of the Physics department
and A. J. Carlson, Ph. D. '03.
Barnett's endowment amounts to
$250 for the purpose of "researoh
on the electric displacement in
duced in a certain dielectric by
motion in a magnetic field," and
Carlson's grant of $100 is for re
search on the physiology of the in
vertebrate heart.
