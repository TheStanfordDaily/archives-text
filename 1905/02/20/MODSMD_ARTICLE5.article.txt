# "QUAD" PRIZES AWARDED.
## Best Story Written by Stella F. Wynne,'06, and P.C. Edwards, '06, Wins Poem Contest. 
### 
The committee on the Quad prize
story has announced that the story
by Miss Stella F. Wynne, '06, en
titled "The Friends of Her Child
hood," is the best of those sub
mitted. The best poem was writ
ten by P. C. Edwards, '06, and is
called "A Seaside Idyll." Profes
sors Alden and Seward and In
structor Bonnell of the English de
partment composed the committee
which made the awards. Honor
able mention was given to the
story, "Thompson of Tulare," by
K. A. Bickel, '07, and a poem by
D. M. Reynolds, '05, entitled
"Reveries." Bickel's story was
published in the December number
of the Sequoia, but ''Reveries" is
an unpublished poem.
The story by Miss Wynne, "The
Friends of Her Childhood," hu
morously relates the experiences of
a school-teacher, Elizabeth Hobbs,
which result from the prank of a
practical joker. "Cousin Eliza
beth," as the teacher is called, has
a decided antipathy to a male
boarder who sits opposite her, and
the two engage in constant wordy
wars in which Elizabeth always
comes out victoriously. In revenge,
the boarder hits upon a plan which
he thinks will give his tormentor
no end of embarrassment. He an
swers several matrimonial adver
tisements, carefully worded, on
blue note-paper, and signs each
with the signature, "Elizabeth
Hobbs." In each he instructs the
correspondent to say when he calls,
"I am a friend of your childhood."
Many humorous situations result.
