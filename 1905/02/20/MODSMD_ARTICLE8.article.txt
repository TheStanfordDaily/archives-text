The engagement of James F,
Lanagan as football and baseball
coach for three years is one of the
most important steps in the develop,
ment of our athletic policy that we
have yet taken. In football it
means a continuance of the system
inaugurated two years ago, with all
the benefits that come from the
pursuance year after year of a cer
tain definite policy. In baseball it
means the beginning of a new era,
in which we may reasonably hope
to see the long line of defeats that
lie behind us brought to a close.
Lanagan needs no introduction to
Stanford people. Everybody knows
how he works. The personality of
a coach enters largely into the
spirit and make-up of his teams.
This is a known factor in Lanagan.
The football squads of the past two
years he has imbued with his spirit,
with the result that such elevens as
those of last season and the season
before have been turned out. One
of the chief requisites of a coach is
to inspire confidence in the men.
Lanagan refused to come to Stan
ford two years ago unless he was
the unanimous choice of the squad.
Before the end of the season his
work was approved by the entire
squad and by the whole student
body. Lanagan was regarded as
the one man to stop California's
string of victories, and later events
proved this opinion to be correct.
Last season Lanagan gave a little
spare time to the baseball squad,
and the effect was quickly seen in
the sharp improvement of the team.
They had confidence in what he
said, and his suggestions did not
go unheeded.
It has been clearly demonstrated
by his work with Stanford teams
that Lanagan knows football and
baseball equally well. But more
than this, and far more important,
is the fact that he knows how to
teach these games. He has the
power of imparting his knowledge
to the men so that they understand,

remember, and put the ideas into
practice. As a coach Lanagan
stands for clean, decent athletic√ü,
and Stanford's sports will be the
better for his influence.
