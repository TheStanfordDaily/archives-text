### 
Stanford will have the Independ
ents as opponents in the baseball
game to-morrow afternoon at 3:30.
Last season the Varsity played
two games with this team, winning
the first by the score of 6 to 1 and
losing the second sto 0. This year
a series of three games will be
played, the final match to take
place on Junior day.
The Independents, and especially
their captain, Ireland, are well
known on the campus. Ireland
will play second base in to-mor
row's game, instead of his custom
ary position of right field. J. F.
Lanagan, '00, will pitch for the vis
itors. A number of other well
known players are members of the
nine. Golinsky, first base, was
seen in games on the campus last
season. Deveraux, third base, and
Moskimon, left field, are both well
known Coast League players, and
were members of the Oakland team
last season.
The Independents played Cali
fornia last week, defeating the Blue
and Gold by the score of 8 to 5.
Because of the fact that California
used a number of new men in the
game, no real comparison of the
strength of the two varsities can
be gained.
