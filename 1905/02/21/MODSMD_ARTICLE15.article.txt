The new problems that confront
the student body in connection with
their athletics were discussed by
such able men at the Assembly this
morning that it would be presump
tuous and quite unnecessary for
the Daily Palo Alto to take them
up editorially. We may, however,
take the liberty of correcting cer
tain misunderstandings that may
have arisen because of an acci
dental misstatement by one of the
speakers. Dr. Angell suggested
that it might be advisable to in
crease the Btudent body assessment
from one dollar a semester to two
dollars a semester. Student body
dues are now but one dollar a year,

and it was Dr. Angell's intention
to BUggest that this be made one
dollar each semester, or two dollars
a year. This proposal would give
the Training House Corporation an
additional thousand dollars a year,
which would mean a great deal at
this critical time. There can hardly
be any strong objection to such an
increase, especially when the need
of it is brought so close home to us.
At some of the American universi
ties several dollars a year are will
ingly paid for the support of ath
letics, even so small a college as
the University of Nevada securing
four dollars a year from every stu
dent to keep up its teams. This is
a matter to be decided by the stu
dents of Stanford for themselves,
however, at the next general elec
tion.
What is needed at the present
moment is a hearty response
to the call for funds for immediate
use. In another column we print
a list of the men and women who
have been chosen to do the work of
collection. Stanford people have
shown before that they can be gen
erous, and there is little doubt that
they will meet the present demand
in the proper spirit.
