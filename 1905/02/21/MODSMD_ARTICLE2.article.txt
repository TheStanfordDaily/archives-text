# SOUTHERN TRACK MEN COMING.
## University of Southern California to Send Twelve Men to Meet the Varsity. 
### 
Manager Barrett has completed
arrangements with Coach Holmes
of the University of Southern Cali
fornia for a dual meet between the
track team of that college and
Stanford to be held March 11th.
The southerners deeired to have
the field-day in Loe Angeles, but
Stanford's contract for a meet with
Pomona College at Pomona on
March 25th prevents Stanford from
meeting any other team during
that trip. As it was impossible
for the Varsity to make two south
ern trips, Manager Barrett pro
posed that the meet be held at
Stanford.
Coach Holmes will bring twelve
athletes to Stanford, and owing to
this small number only three men
from each college will be permitted
to enter an event. With the ex
ception of the two-mile run, which
will l>e omitted from the list of
events, the usual intercollegiate
order will prevail. The Southern
California team will arrive on the
campus March 9th.
W. F. Dunn, '04, will be a mem
ber of the Southern California
team, and with the aid of his team
mate, Parsons, the southern team
ought to take a majority of the
points in the short sprints. Bo
vard, Hubbard and Klitten will
run the mile for the southerners,
and Higgins is their best performer
in the middle distances. Webb and
Ferguson will put the shot and
throw the hammer. Comstock has
a creditable record in the pole
vault. Altogether the team from
the Methodist college is a well
balanced aggregation.
