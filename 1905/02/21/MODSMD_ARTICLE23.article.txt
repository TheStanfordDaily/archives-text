# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY TO-DAY
## President Jordan, Dr. Angell and F. L. Berry, '99, Discuss New Athletic Field. 
### 
The University Assembly this
morning was devoted to discussion
of athletics and of the plans of the
Training House Corporation for
the new athletic field. In every
way the meeting was one of the
most interesting and successful of
the year. The principal speakers
were President Jordan, Dr. Frank
Angell, chairman of the Faculty
Athletic Committee and treasurer
of the Training House Corporation,
and F. L. Berry, '99, director of
the Training House Corporation.
Coach Lanagan, who had been in
vited to address the students, was
unable to be present.
Dr. Jordan discussed the new in
tercollegiate athletic agreement and
spoke upon the subject of athletics
in the University. He said that
athletics must support themselves,
that the University will only sup
port gymnasia. He believes that
the dangers of football have been
overdrawn, and that the suggestion
advanced for more open play is as
dangerous or more so than mass
plays. "Publicity," Baid Dr. Jor
dan, "is not always desirable."
He said he did not approve of post
season games in football because
the men who play the game should
be allowed time to do the required
university work. He said further:
"Football men must keep up in
their work. I do not believe in
showing any more leniency to a
football man than to the ordinary
Freshman whose work falls below
the standard. Every case of len
iency is a fraud. Men who are
paid to play football have no place
in college.
"Outside coaches are an abuse.
Graduate coaches have an interest
in the good name of their college,
while outsiders hired to coach
think only of winning. There is
no more demoralizing influence
than a coach who is here for the
sole purpose of winning. The
methods of war employed in foot
ball are its greatest evil. Any man
guilty of 'dirty playing' should be
put out of the game for good."
Dr. Jordan thinks that restraints
ought to be placed on the expendi
ture of money by the student body
treasurer. He expressed himself
as in accord with the action of the
Executive Committee in the re
election of Lanagan as coach and
Moulton as trainer.
Dr. Angell, who was the second
speaker, gave a rapid survey of the
athletic field plans, with a state
ment as to the financial needs of
the situation. Dr. Angell said in
part:
"It is the plan of the Training
House Corporation to raise money
to carry on the building of the new
field by popular subscription. At
the end of the year the Training
House Corporation will have $10,-
000, to which the Executive Com
mittee may add another thousand.
The students and alumni should
subscribe two thousand dollars, so
that work can be begun with ap
proximately $13,000. The expenses
next year will be greater and the
income less. The cost of the care
of the grounds will greatly exceed
any previous expenses. The grad
ing on the football field will cost
less than that at Berkeley. It is
possible that the student body as
sessment will be increased to $2."
Dr. Angell said later: "The

Trustees would desire as a provision
for the allotment of territory, that
the grounds be placed in the hands
of a board of control, partly perma
nent. There is no question in re
gard to haste. There is plenty of
time to get the grounds in order
for practice next fall. The level
ing for the grading will be begun
this week.
"In 1899 the Training House Cor
poration sent to the alumni return
postal cards on which the alumni
subscribed. These have not all been
collected. It iB intended to collect
all the money thus subscribed and
to add to the fund already at hand."
Berry was the last speaker. He
discussed the history of the Train
ing House Corporation, its earlier
history and its objects.
