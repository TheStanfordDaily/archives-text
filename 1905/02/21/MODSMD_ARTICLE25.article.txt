The Los Angeles Times prints the
following item about W. F. Dunn,
'04, Stanford's former quarter-miler
and 220 man:
"Dunn, the old Stanford man,
who is coaching the track team of
the University of Southern Cali
fornia, will not participate in the
dual meet on February 22d be-
Occidental and the Uni
versity of Southern California if
Coach Merrill of Occidental can
prevent it. Merrill says Dunn is a
professional, and he had written a
letter to Coach Holmes protesting
against the Stanford man's plan to
enter the sprints at the dual meet.
Dunn, who holds the Coast record
for the 220- and 440-yard dashes,
is attending the medical school at
the university. Coach Merrill
bases part of his objection to Dunn
on the compensation or salary paid
to him. It amounts to $50 a
month. Coach Holmes says it is
for traveling expenses, carfare, and
so on, but Coach Merrill does not
agree to this. He insists the com
pensation is for athletic ability,
and nothing else."
