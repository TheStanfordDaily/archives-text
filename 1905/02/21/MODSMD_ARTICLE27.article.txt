# Inspect Redwood Course.

### 
During the last few days several
members of the Boat Club have
been making a thorough investiga
tion of the facilities for rowing at
the proposed course at Redwood
City. It was found that the course
was in every way an ideal one.
There is a straightaway stretch
two miles long, and by making a
slight turn the course extends a
mile further. Throughout its
length the course is from one hun
dred to two hundred yards in
width and the water is always
calm. A boat-house suitable to
house the new shell will be built
shortly, so that it will be ready for
the men to use when regular work
is begun on the course, which will
be in about four weeks.
