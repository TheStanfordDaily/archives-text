# DR. JORDAN MAKES DENIAL
## No Order That Men and Women Shall Not Walk Together After Six O'clock. 
### 
Reports that instructions have
been issued by President Jordan
forbidding women students to go
walking with the men of the Uni
versity after 6 p.Â«n. are emphatical
ly denied by the head of the Uni
versity. President Jordan has issued
the following statement in regard to
the matter:
"Whenever any order is issued to
the student body it will be placed
on the bulletin-board, or discussed
in the Assembly Hall. All other
alleged orders or rules are either
distorted fragments of personal dis
cussion, or else pure inventions.
The students are never in doubt as
to any general rule concerning them
as a body. David 8. Jordan."
Dr. Jordan states that he has at
various times discussed social con
ditions and matters of personal
conduct with individuals and
groups of men and women students,
and as a result of these discussions
he has made suggestions, but he has
not issued any order forbidding the
men and women of the University
to walk together after 6 p.m.
