A committee from the University
Board of Trustees to-day looked
over the ground wanted by the
Training House Corporation for
the new athletic field. All the
space asked for was granted, and
also a strip of land beyond that
actually needed for the fields. The
ground will be surveyed at once
and grading for the football field
begun. The space provided gives
ample room for all the fields
planned for, including three foot
ball fields, two baseball fields, a
track, la crosse and association
football fields.
The Board of Trustees at a recent
meeting practically approved the
plans of the Training House Cor
poration, but appointed a sub
committee to investigate the plans
in detail. The favorable decision
of this committee to-day practically
leaves the matter entirely in the
hands of the corporation. The
three trustees who went over the
field to-day are C. G. Lathrop, G.
E. Crothers, and Leon Sloss.
