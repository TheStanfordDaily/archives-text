## Will Give Courses at Cornell and Do Private Research Work During the Next Year. 
### 
Df. Max Farrand, head of the
History department for the past
four years, has been granted leave
of absence for the year beginning
in May. l)r. Farrand has secured
this leave to enable him to carry
on certain studies in the East for
which the library facilities on the
Coast are inadequate. He has also
accepted an invitation from Cornell
University to give, during the ab
sence of Charles Hull, professor of
American history, two courses, a
general course on the westward
movement of population in the
United States, and a more ad
vanced course on the formation of
the Constitution of the United
States.

work, which will be done mainly
in Washington and Philadelphia.
This special work is the completion
of a labor upon which he has been
engaged for several years—a book
upon the work of the Federal con
vention in the formation of the
Constitution. The department of
State at Washington possesses the
most important manuscripts deal
ing with the subject. All the of
ficial records of the convention
were turned over by General Wash
ington, and the papers of Madison,
who kept the most complete records
of the convention's work, were pur
chased by Congress after Madison's
death. Other valuable documents
are in the archives of the Histori
cal Society of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Farrand came to Stanford
University as head of the History
department in September, 1901, in
succession to Dr. George E. How
ard, who had resigned as a result
of the Ross troubles. His best
known undergraduate course has
been"The Westward Movement."
With Dr.J.Turner of the University
of Wisconsin, Dr. Farrand is per
haps the foremost authority upon
this subject in the United States.
He and Dr. Turner have kept
closely in touch with the results of
each other's researches. Besidee
"The Westward Movement" and a
few other undergraduate courses,
Dr. Farrand has given some valu
able courses in the constitutional
history of the United States.
Dr. Farrand received his under
graduate training at Princeton
University, taking his bachelor's
degree in 1892. A year later he
became master of arts, and in 1896
took the advanced degree of doc
tor of philosophy. During 1892-
93 he was Boudinot fellow in his
tory at Princeton, and for a year
fellow in social science. The years
1894-96 were spent in study at the
great German universities of Leip
zig and Heidelberg. In 1896 began
his connection with Wesleyan Uni
versity, first as instructor in his
tory, then associate professor, and
finally, during 1899-1901, as head
of the history department.
During his connection with
Stanford University Dr. Farrand

has always taken a deep interest
in the athletics of the college and
in all affairs affecting the welfare
of the men. He was one of the or

composed of the leaders in the
different college activities, and the
aim of which is to promote the
best interests of the University in
whatever ways may be possible.
Arrangements for the conduct of
the History department during the

yet been completed.
