The preliminary try-outs for the
Junior opera cast which have al
ready been held were not character
ized by any flattering display of
enthusiasm on the part of those
dramatically inclined. At the Tues
day try-outs lees than a dozen con
testants appeared, and yesterday
the number was little larger. This
may be accounted for by the fact
that the English Club's play is now
claiming a good share of our stu
dent actors, or the poor attendance
may have been due to the mistaken
impression that the try-outß were
to be invitational only. This latter
is an error, and is sincerely la
mented by the farce committee.
For the convenience of those who
have not taken advantage of the
two previous ones, another try-out
will be held to-morrow afternoon,
and it is essential that all who are
the least interested be present to
display their ability.
