A few days ago the Daily Palo
Alto called attention to the pres
ence of the great heap of rubbish
that lies behind Encina Hall, at
the junction of the roads that run
by the Gymnasium and behind the
hall and at the beginning of the
pathway to the track. We regret
to say that the mass of decaying
matter, now grown to a pile almost
three feet high, still lies undis
turbed. We do not know who is
responsible for this disgraceful
state of affairs, but it is presum
ably some person who receives a
salary from the business depart
ment of the University for oversee
ing the work of the janitorial force.
If this person does not think it
worth the trouble to see that the
rubbish is disposed of as it should
be in any community that lays
claim to the decencies of civiliza
tion, we would suggest that the
health board of the University look
into the matter in the interests of

the continued good health of the
students. An immediate reason
for speedy action in getting rid of
this pe√üt-spot in our midst is that
on Saturday we are to have a track
meet with three outside high
schools, which means that a large
number of visitors will come to our
grounds. To get to the track they
must pass within a few feet of this
mess. Will they connect its pres
ence with the so-called epidemics
that we have had in recent years?
In conclusion, we will say that if
the expense of a daily visit from a
scavenger is too great for the treas
ury of the University to bear, an
intimation to that effect would
probably be sufficient to bring out
a popular subscription to secure
the necessary one or two dollars a
week.
