# MATHEMATICIANS TO MEET.
## Sessions of American Society Branch Will Be Held Here Next Saturday. 
### 
The semiannual meeting of the
San Francisco section of the Amer
ican Mathematical .Society will be
held at Stanford University Feb
ruary 25th. There will be a ses
sion in the morning at 11 and an
other in the afternoon at 2. The
meeting in the morning will be
taken up in a more or less tech
nical discussion of mathematical
problems. In the afternoon there
will be a paper of interest to all by
Professor T. J. J. See of the United
States Naval Observatory at Mare
Island. Professor See will speak
on a subject relating to the geology
of the interior of the earth, which
will be of especial interest to all
geologists and physicists. The
meetings will be held in room 50,
quad, and a general invitation is
extended. The complete program
follows:
Morning session—"On a theorem
due to C. Jordan," Professor H. F.
Blicbfeldt, Stanford University;
"On the order of the collineation
groups in five variables," Professor
H. F. Blichfeldt; "A theorem in
the theory of probabilities, and its
application to insurance," Professor
A. \V. Whitney, University of Cal
ifornia; "A general theorem in
probability," Professor 11. E. Mo
ritz, University of Washington;
"Projective differential geometry of
plane curves," Professor E. J. Wil
czynski, University of Californii.
Afternoon session— "On the
primitive groups of class ten," l)r.
W. A. Manning, Stanford Univer
sity; "Invariant sub-groups of
prime index," Professor G. A. Mil
ler, Stanford University; "On the
general applicability of the short
method of determining orbits from
three observations," Professor A. 0.
Leuschner, University of Califor
nia; "On the physical state of the
matter of the earth's interior, with
considerations on terrestrial geol
ogy, and on the comparative geol
ogy of the other planets," Professor
T. J. J. See, Naval Observatory.
