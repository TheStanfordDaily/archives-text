# VARSITY PLAYS GOOD GAME.
## Improved Batting and Fielding of the Nine Results in Decisive Victory. 
### 
Stanford played better baseball
yesterday than at any previous time
this season, defeating the Inde
pendents by the score of 6 to 1.
This is the second victory of the
Varsity, the Clabrough - Golcher
team having been defeated a week
ago. Yesterday's game came near
resulting in -a shut-out for the visi
tors. Up to the ninth the Inde
pendents had failed to score. In
the last inning Moskiman knocked
out a long three-base hit, and Wal
ton, the next man up, bunted, al
lowing the Oakland pitcher to score.
The Varsity found no difficulty
in hitting yesterday, and started
the scoring in the first inning.
Eleven safe hits, which netted a
total of Bix runs, were made off
Lanagan. Walton, a former star
catcher of Stanford, was behind the
bat, but his throwing to bases was
inaccurate, allowing a number of
men to steal. The playing of the
Varsity men was noticeably better
in yesterday's contest, both batting
and fielding showing marked im
provement. Sales pitched a steady
game, allowing but two hits. Sum
