# Freshmen to Choose Captain.
## 
### 
The Freshman track men will
elect a captain on the oval to
morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock. In
view of the fact that the Freshmen
will hold several meets before the
annual interclass field-day, it has
been considered advisable that the
squad shall have a leader.
Entries for Saturday's meet with
the San Jose, Santa Clara, and
Palo Alto high schools must be in
by 3 o'clock Friday afternoon.
Entry blanks for this purpose will
be found posted in the rubbing
shed.
