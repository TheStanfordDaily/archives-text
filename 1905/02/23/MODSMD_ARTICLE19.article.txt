the Encina courts, and before eve
ning play in the first preliminary
singles tournament had been com
pleted to the final round. Two
freshmen, A. R. Mac Swain of
Santa Clara and P. B. Delano of
Hartford, Conn., were the success
ful players, and the final match
between them took place this
afternoon, the winner qualifying
