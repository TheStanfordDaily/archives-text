# "Princess Enone" Try-outs.
## 
### 
A preliminary try-out for the
leading parts in"The Princess
Enone" was held Tuesday after
noon and for the chorus on
Wednesday, but on account of the
small number trying for positions
another preliminary will be held
to-morrow afternoon in the chapel.
The final try-out, when the mem
bers of the cast will be selected,
will be held Saturday morning, and
every one that makes good in the
preliminaries will try out then.
The committee was disappointed at
the small number of students in
the competition, and urges that at
the try-out to-morrow there be as
many candidates present as possible.
