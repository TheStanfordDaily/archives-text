# COLLECTING OF FUNDS.
## Business Men of Palo Alto and Elsewhere Will Be Asked to Contribute. 
### 
Manager Barrett is busy dis
tributing receipt - books among
those who have been placed in
charge of collecting contributions
toward the new athletic field. Each
fraternity and sorority house has a
representative, Roble has two and
Encina four. M. H. Thorpe, '05,
is in charge of a number of col
lectors in Palo Alto. Mention will
be made from time to time of the
success which the collectors are
meeting with and the amount of
money turned over to the treasurer
of the student body.
Manager Barrett will not confine
the gathering of funds to students,
but the business men of Palo Alto
and other places will be asked to
contribute to the fund. The play
ing of the intercollegiate contests
on the campus will be a decided
benefit to the business men of Palo
Alto, and for that reason they will
be asked to co-operate with the
students.
In the making-up of Tuesday's
paper the name of W. R. Cole, '05,
as a collector was accidentally
dropped out. Cole will represent
the Chi Psi fraternity in the gath
ering of funds for the field.
