# San Mateo Defeated at Basket-ball.
## 
### 
Yesterday morning the Stanford
basket-ball team defeated the team
from the San Mateo Athletic Club
by the score of 10 to 6. Despite
the fact that three of Stanford's best
players —Misses Grace, Huiskamp,
and Monteith —were out of the line
up, this was decidedly the best
game this season. The head-work
was especially good when the plays
called for steady team work, and
the entire game was an uphill fight.
Only one field, goal was made on
each side, and the remainder of the
score was made on fouls.
The most consistent playing for
Stanford was done by Miss Spald
ing, '06, Miss Falk, '06, and Miss
Betz, '06. Miss Boulware, who
took Miss Monteith's place at for
ward, showed herself a good player.
The great fault of the players was
on the part of the forwards, who
were inclined to stay too close to
gether when the ball passed in from
out of bounds; and on the part of
the guards, who failed to stay close
enough to their opponents when
the latter were throwing from foul.
The forwards played the best
game for the San Mateo team, who,
up to this game, have claimed the
bay counties' championship.
The line-up was as follows:
STANFORD SAN MATEO
