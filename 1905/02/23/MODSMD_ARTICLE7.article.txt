# Tennis Tournament Saturday.
## 
### 
Saturday morning at 9 o'clock
the final women's tennis tourna
ment, which was postponed from
last week, will be held on the Roble

courts. This is by far the most
important of the tournaments
which has been held during the
year, for from the winners in this
the team which will meet the Cali
fornia women players will be chos
en. Miss Mabel Ray, '05, captain
of the tennis squad, is anxious that
all of the women now in college
who play tennis shall come out
next Saturday and enter the tour
nament. The winners in the pre
liminaries will play in the semi
finals, and the latter set of winners
will play Miss Georgia Pitman,'os,
and Miss Elise Owen. '07, neither
of whom will play in the prelimi
naries. The winner of the last
match will play Miss Kay for the
championship. A 6ilver cup will
be presented to the winner in the
finals.
It is imperative that the team
which is to meet the California
players should be chosen very soon,
in order that the players may be
gin careful practice and training.
All those who expect to enter the
tournament are requested to hand
their names to Miss Ray, or to
leave them at the Roble gymnasium
before Friday evening, February
24th.
