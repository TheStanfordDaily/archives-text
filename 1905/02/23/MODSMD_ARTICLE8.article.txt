### 
The challenge for a series of
baseball games with Waseda Uni
versity of Japan, received last se
mester by Manager Barrett, has
been accepted, and the Varsity will
play two games with the Japanese.
The Japanese team won the cham
pionship of Japan last year and
this year has a very strong nine,
which will come to America to
play what will probably be the
first international game of its kind
ever played. The visitors will
leave Japan during the last part of
March and come directly to Stan
ford, where they will be enter
tained by the Japanese Club.
While on the campus the nine will
practice on the Varsity diamond
every morning.
The Japanese will play two
games with Stanford, one before
and one after the last game of the
intercollegiate series. At present
it is not known whether both of the
games will be played on the cam
pus, as Manager Barrett may try
to have one of the games played in
San Francisco. According to the
arrangements made with Iso Ab6,
superintendent of the athletic de
partment of Waseda University,
the Japanese will pay all their ex
penses and receive two-thirds of
the gate receipts of the games. It
is probable that after arriving in
this country the Waseda nine will
arrange a serieH of games with
other teams on the Coast.
