# BIG TRACK MEET TO-MORROW.
## Athletes of Freshman Class Will Contest with Preparatory School Stars. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
on the oval the Freshman track
squad will meet the combined
teams of the San Jose, Santa Clara,
and Palo Alto high schools. The
visiting team is composed of the
pick of the preparatory school ath
letes of the Santa Clara valley, and
the Freshmen will have to work
hard if they win to-morrow's field
day.
With Cope unable to compete
it is quite likely that the high
school representatives will take a
majority of the points in the
dashes. Pomeroy of the Palo Alto
High School has the best record of
the entries in the sprints. In last
year's Academic Athletic League
field-day he won the 100-yard dash
on a wet track in fast time. Other
good performers in the sprints are
Sejal of San Jose and Kocher of
Santa Clara. The Freshmen will
depend on Gartzmann, Abbott, and
Severy to take points for the class
in the dashes.
The Freshman team should ex
perience little difficulty in securing
at least two places in the 440-vard
dash, with Davis and Abbott en
tered in that event. In the mile
and half-mile runs the visitors
have no entries who can make
Miller work, but it is possible that
they will secure places in both
these events.
In the weights the twelve-pound
hammer and shot will be used.
Horton, '08, ought to win both, but
he will be closely pressed by Tom
asini of Palo Alto. In the other
field events there is no means of
getting a line on the comparative
merits of the competing teams, and
the outcome of the field-day will
probably hinge on the result of
these events. The entries follow:
50 yards—Pomeroy, Palo Alto;
Sejal, San Jose; Gartzmann, '08,
Friedman, '08.
100 yards—Pomeroy, Palo Alto;
Sejal, San Jose; McGraw, San Jose;
Clark, Santa Clara; Edwards, Santa
Clara; Abbott, '08, Severy, '08,

zens, Santa Clara; Kocher, Santa
Clara; Walton, Santa Clara; Da
vis, '08, Severy, '08, Abbott, '08,
Borough, '08.

Alto; Edwards, San Jose; Harter,
San JoBe; Blanchard, Banta Clara;

One of the most interesting feat
ures of the meet will be a relay
race between two teams chosen
from the aspirants for the Varsity
track team. L. G. Russell, '06, has
been chosen captain of one team
and L. M. Edwards, '07, will lead
the other. Russell's team will con

Severy to take points for the class
in the dashes.
The Freshman team should ex
perience little difficulty in securing
at least two places in the 440-vard
dash, with Davis and Abbott en
tered in that event. In the mile
and half-mile runs the visitors
have no entries who can make
Miller work, but it is possible that
they will secure places in both
these events.
In the weights the twelve-pound
hammer and shot will be used.
Horton, '08, ought to win both, but
he will be closely pressed by Tom
asini of Palo Alto. In the other
field events there is no means of
getting a line on the comparative
merits of the competing teams, and
the outcome of the field-day will
probably hinge on the result of
these events. The entries follow:
50 yards—Pomeroy, Palo Alto;
Sejal, San Jose; Gartzmann, '08,
Friedman, '08.
100 yards—Pomeroy, Palo Alto;
Sejal, San Jose; McGraw, San Jose;

Clara; Abbott, '08, Severy, '08,
Gartzmann, '08.

'08.
440 yards—Hill, San Jose; Coz
zens, Santa Clara; Kocher, Santa
Clara; Walton, Santa Clara; Da
vis, '08, Severy, '08, Abbott, '08,
Borough, '08.
880 yards —Heald, Palo Alto;

'08.

One of the most interesting feat
ures of the meet will be a relay
race between two teams chosen
from the aspirants for the Varsity
track team. L. G. Russell, '06, has
been chosen captain of one team
and L. M. Edwards, '07, will lead
the other. Russell's team will con
sist of the following—Carter, '05,
Bounds, '05, Bertheau, '05, J. E.
Campbell, '06, Redman, '07, Free
man, '06, Weller, '07, Russell, '06.
Edwards' team includes the follow
ing—Barbur, '07, Moran, '05, Ir
win, '07, W. H. Campbell, '06, El- 1
well, '07, Wood, '07, Macfarland,
'07, Edwards, '07. Substitutes —
Goudy, '05, Chalmers, '07.
If time permits the Varsity can
didates for the mile event will run
a trial. Thomson,'os, Waring, '05,
Fowler, '06, Weinmann, '06,
Knupp, '07, and Powers, '07, will
enter the mile run.
The officials for to-morrow's meet
are as follows: Clerk of the course,
R. J. McFadden, '05; starter, F. S.
Holman, '05; timers, E. W. Moul
ton, Dr. F. Angell, I. C. Ackerman,
'06; judges of the finish, Professor
C. Searles, Dr. W. F. Snow, H. W.

To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
on the oval the Freshman track
squad will meet the combined
teams of the San Jose, Santa Clara,
and Palo Alto high schools. The
visiting team is composed of the
pick of the preparatory school ath
letes of the Santa Clara valley, and
the Freshmen will have to work
hard if they win to-morrow's field
day.
With Cope unable to compete
it is quite likely that the high
school representatives will take a
majority of the points in the
dashes. Pomeroy of the Palo Alto
High School has the best record of
the entries in the sprints. In last
year's Academic Athletic League
field-day he won the 100-yard dash
on a wet track in fast time. Other
good performers in the sprints are
Sejal of San Jose and Kocher of
Santa Clara. The Freshmen will
depend on Gartzmann, Abbott, and
Severy to take points for the class
in the dashes.
The Freshman team should ex
