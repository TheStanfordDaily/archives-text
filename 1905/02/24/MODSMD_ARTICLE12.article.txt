The Daily Palo Alto feels im
pelled to take upon itself on behalf
of the student body to thank the
business department of the Univer
sity for its promptness in getting
rid of the rubbish pile behind En
cina Hall. To-morrow morning
the students will be able to take
their guests to the track without
being forced to talk unnecessarily
long and loudly about the beauties
ofEncinaHall architecture in or
der to divert the visitors' eyes at
least from the unsightly heap. We
may reasonably hope that orders
have been given which will require
the janitors to find a less conspicu
ous and more appropriate resting
place for the rubbish that they
gather from the great dormitory.
