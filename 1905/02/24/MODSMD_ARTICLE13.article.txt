The Daily Palo Alto is in re
ceipt of a letter which it would like
to publish, but which it cannot for
the reason that it is unsigned.
The paper is always glad to re
ceive and to publish well-consid
ered discussions upon subjects that
concern the welfare of the student
body, although not accepting any
responsibility for the sentiments
expressed; but the editor must al
ways know the authorship of such
communications.
While we regret that we cannot
publish the present letter in full,
we can at least give hearty en
dorsement to the sentiment ex
pressed. The writer's complaint is
the lack of "rooting" at the base
ball games, with the intercollegi
ate contests only a few weeks off.
It is unquestionably about time
that we were doing something in
the way of organized cheering so
that we may be in the best form
for our meeting with California,
and we could not have a better
opportunity to begin than to-mor
row.
