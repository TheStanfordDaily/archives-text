# HISTORIC REVIVALS OF PLAY.
## Famous English. Actors Have Taken Part in "Every Man in His Humour." 
### 
There is still living in London
an old actor, Hermann Vizen, who
forty years ago took part in a re
vival of Ben Jonson's "Every Man
in His Humour." So far as the
records go, the play has not been
acted since that time. The "Silent
Woman" was produced on an
Elizabethan stage at Harvard ten
years ago, but the probabilities are
that the comedy with which Ben
Jonson made his reputation will
be acted for the first time in
America when given by the Eng
lish Club at Stanford next month.
Perhaps the chief reason why
"Every Man in His Humour" is
not acted oftener on the professional
stage is that it calls for at least
twelve actors of approximately
equal prominence, whereas in mod
ern times the tendency is to center
the entire interest about one "star."
The characters of Kitely, Bobadil,
Brainworn, and indeed most of the
others, demand individual acting
of the highest order, and under the
circumstances it is perhaps more
difficult for professionals to secure
a well-balanced cast than for ama
teurs.
In the three centuries since the
play was first acted it has, however,
been a favorite with many of the
greatest English actors. Ben Jon
son himself records that in its first
production by the Lord Chamber
lain's Servants at the Globe The
ater in 1598 the cast included
Shakspere, then at the heighth of
his fame; Richard Burbadge, who
took the leading tragic parts in
Shakspere's plays; William Kempe,
famous as a comic actor; Heminge
and Condell, editors of the u Firßt
Folio" edition of Shakspere. Ac
cording to tradition, Shakspere to,)k
the part of Knowell.
After the Restoration, which did
awav with the ban placed on the
aters by the Puritans, "Every Man
in His Humour" was the first of
Jonson's plays to be revived. In
1675 it was placed upon the boards
in London by the Duke of York's
company, and the critics of the
day hailed the return of "Immor
tal Ben" with enthusiasm. The
revival of the play at this period is
memorable for the epilogue at
tached to it at the time by the Earl
of Dorset.
Later the part of Kitely, the
jealous husband, became one of
David Garrick's greatest roles, and
in the first two-thirds of the nine
teenth century it was played by a
number of leading actors, among
them Edward Kean.
A noteworthy revival of the play
was that by Charles Dickens and
his company of amateurs' in 1845.
Dickens, with his keen sense of
what is striking and significant in
character, was naturally interested
in this play which represented
realistically so many phases of life
in Elizabethan London. He and
his company, which included
Douglas Jerrold, John Leech, and
Forster, the novelist's biographer,
met with such an outburst of ap
plause when the play was first
given in Soho that they moved to
St. James' Theatre and later made
a tour through England. An ac
count of this revival and of Dick
ens' interpretation of the downfall
of Bobadil, the boastful captain,
will be a feature of the English
Club's book of the play.
