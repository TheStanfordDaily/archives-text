# SECOND GAME WITH SAN JOSE
## Stanford Will Try to Retrieve Defeat of First Contest To-Morrow.â€”Game at 3. 
### 
The second baseball game of the
series with the San Jose Profession
als will be played on the campus
to-morrow at 3 o'clock. This strong
team defeated the Varsity in the
first game by the score of 5 to 2.
San Jose will play the same team
as in the first game, with the ex
ception that the pitcher has not
been decided upon. It is probable
that a number of players will take
their turn in the box.
Since playing the first game of
the series the men on the Varsity
have been changed around and the
team work of the nine has been
much improved. The following is
the probable line-up of the teams:
STANFORD SAN JOSE
Sales p Cutter
Stott c Kent
Presley lb Chase
Bell 2b (c) Doyle
Fenton 3b Arrellanes
Trowbridge (c). ss Swain
Chalmers If Emerson
Colbert ) . ,
