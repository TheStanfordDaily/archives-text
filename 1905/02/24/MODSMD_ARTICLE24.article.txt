# REUNION PRIZES OFFERED.
## Souvenirs to Be Given to Those Who Come from the Longest Distances. 
### 
Through the efforts of Archie
Rice, '95, editor of the Aluvmus, a
number of prizes have been offered
for presentation at the alumni de
cennial reunion in May. A prize
will be given to the representative
of each class who has traveled the
farthest distance to attend the re
union. Besides these prizes to class
representatives there is a special
prize, a silver loving cup, which
will be given to the delegate who
travels the longest distance, wheth
er or not he has ever attended the
University. The special prize is
offered by Rice. It has been placed
in one of the windows of the Pres
ident's office. The oldest classes re
ceive precedence, so that the repre
sentative of the class of '92 has the
choice from among the thirteen
prizes. It is possible for a class
representative to also win the spe
cial prize.
Among some of the other prizes
already offered are subscriptions to
all of the college publications, the
Alumnus, trips to different parts of
the State on the Southern Pacific,
and various prizes from San Fran
cisco and Palo Alto merchants and
business men. The March Alumnus
will contain a list of the prizes and
the donors.
