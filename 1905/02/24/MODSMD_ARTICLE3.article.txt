# RATIFIES NEW AGREEMENT.
## Executive Committee Sanctions the Action of the Intercollegiate Athletic Committee. 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee last night the new in
tercollegiate agreement with the
University of California was rati
fied. There was little discussion of
the agreement, as the members of
the committee had carefully con
sidered the matter for the past two
weeks. The clause in regard to the
restriction on special students came
up for discussion and was favor
ably considered. This rule re
stricts the students of the Califor
nia Affiliated Colleges from par
ticipating in many contests open
to students of regular standing.
The ratification of this agree
ment also means that boating is
placed upon an intercollegiate
basis. A Freshman track meet is
also placed on the list of intercol
legiate events. This agreement is
entered into for the next four years,
ending December 31, 1908.
Aside from the ratification of the
agreement, there was no business
transacted at la√üt night's meeting.
