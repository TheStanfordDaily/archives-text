# BOAT-HOUSE AT REDWOOD CITY.
## Members of the Club Will Construct It Themselves in the Next Two Weeks. 
### 
President Butterfield of the
Stanford Boat Club, R. H. Gaither,
'06, and L. L. Carter, '06, on Wash
ington's birthday selected the site
for the new boat-house which is to
be built at Redwood City. They put
down the stakes for the piles upon
which the boat-house will be built.
The site selected is at the deep
water wharf, which is only a short
distance from the railroad station.
The land has been given to the
Boat Club and the club will take
out a formal lease next week.
Members of the Boat Club will
go to Redwood Saturday, March
4th, to build the boat-house. It is
hardly probable that they can fin
ish it in one day, and in that event
another contingent will be sent the
following Saturday to complete the
work. The boating management
proposes to start rowing on the
new course by about March 15th.
The boat-house will be big enough
to accommodate five or six boats.
The barge and pair will be kept on
Lagunita, but the shell will be
taken to Redwood.
