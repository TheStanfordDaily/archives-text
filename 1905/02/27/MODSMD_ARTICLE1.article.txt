# SAN JOSE DEBATERS WIN.
## Commercial Evening School of San Francisco Loses the Stanford Trophy. 
### 
The fifth annual debate of the
Debating League of Central Cali
fornia was held in Assembly Hall
Saturday evening between the
Commercial Evening High School
of San Francisco and the San Jose
High School. By unanimous de
cision of the judges, Professors W.
F. Durand, C. A. Duniway, and E.
D. Adams, the San Jose team was
adjudged the winner and awarded
the cup given by the Stanford stu
dent body.
The subject for discussion was:
"Resolved, That the expenses of
government could be more satis
factorily met by a tax upon land
values only." The San Francisco
team, consisting of Edward J.
Reilly, Louis T. Diebels, and Wal
ter E. Trefts, advocated the affirm
ative, and Allen C. Cunha, Frank
E. Hill, and J. E. Shelton spoke on
the negative for San Jose. The
men spoke in the order named, the
time of the speeches being seven
teen minutes each, Trefts taking
an additional seven minutes rebut
tal for the affirmative.
The San Francisco team argued
that present systems of taxation
are unjust and unsatisfactory, and
that a chinge is therefore necessary
and desirable. They attempted to
show that the single tax system
would in a large measure alleviate
the present evils; that it has been
thoroughly tried in many coun
tries, and that it has everywhere
recommended itself for its sim
plicity and fairness.
In reply the San Jose debaters
held that the proposed system
would not supply sufficient revenue
for the needs of government; that
it would unjustly throw the bur
den of taxes on the farming class;
that it has never proved successful
when tried; and, lastly, that there
is no need for a change, because the
present system of taxation is sat
isfactory to both government and
people.
Special trains bearing rooters
from both Bchools were run to Palo
Alto in the evening and back the
same night.
No school in the league has yet
held the trophy for more than one
year. Next year San Jose must
defend its title to the cup in a de
bate with the team which wins out
in the preliminary contests.
