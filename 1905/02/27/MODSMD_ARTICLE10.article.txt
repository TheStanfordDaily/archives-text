One of the great nuisances of a
university is the man who thinks it
a perfectly proper practice to
pick up the hat, coat or umbrella
that comes handiest to him in
leaving library or other general
meeting place. Exchange of prop
erty in this manner may be per
fectly satisfactory to the person
who has the first choice, but it is
generally displeasing to the victim;
and when the property is not ulti
mately returned to the rightful
owner, the latter properly regards
the transaction as an act of thiev
ery. One of the finest things about
Stanford University, and one of
the things that first attracts the
favorable notice of the visitor, is
the way in which the students may
scatter their books and other be
longs over length and breadth of
quadrangle and campus with the
assurance that they will find them
undisturbed when they seek them
again. Such is our reputation,
and it is a pity that it should suf
fer through the indiscretion* of a
few foolish persons.
