The Employment Bureau wishes
to call the attention of students
who expect to work during the
summer vacation to the fact that
we are visited every spring by gen
eral agents looking for men to do
summer work. It is the policy of
the Bureau to discourage rather
than encourage"agenting," —partly
because some men fail at it, and so
come back to the University in
September worse off financially
than they were when they left; and
partly to offset the glowing accounts
that any good general agent is able
to give of hiß particular line.
There are, however, men who make
a success as agents, and we suggest
that men who have done such work
or think they would like to try,
send in their names to us at once.
One or two general agents have al
ready been on thecampus with prop
ositions that are, perhaps, as good
as any that will be offered. We
will refuse to give them the names
of working students who have not
expressed their wish to see such
men, for the time of both student
and agent is valuable.
