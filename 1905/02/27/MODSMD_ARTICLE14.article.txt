Manager Barrett has added an
other game to the baseball sched
ule. A contest has been arranged
for March 21st between the Varsity
and a nine composed of faculty

men. J. F. Lanagan, '00, will
pitch for the faculty.
The game with Pensacola, which
was postponed on account of rain,
will be played next Saturday on
the campus.
A game has been arranged with
the St. Mary's team, to be played
at Recreation Park, San Francisco,
March 11th. The idea of the man
agement in securing a game off the
campus is to accustom the men to
playing on strange grounds.
