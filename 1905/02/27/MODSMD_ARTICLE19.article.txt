# FRESHMEN WIN TRACK MEET.
## San Jose, Santa Clara and Palo Alto High Schools Defeated by the Score of 66 to 49. 
### 
The Freshman track team won
a one-sided meet from the com
bined teams of the San Jose, Santa
Clara and Palo Alto high schools
by the score of 66 to 49 on the oval
Saturday morning. Except the
short dashes, which were hotly con
tested, the races were comparative
ly uninteresting on account of a
tendency on the part of the Stan
ford entries to loaf when they had
their events won. With the excep
tion of the mile, the races were run
in good time, but the records made
in the field events were only medi
ocre. F. R. Lanagan had the liga
ments of his left leg torn while
broad jumping, and was unable to
compete in the pole-vault. His in
jury may keep him from the track
for several weeks.
With only three men entered in
the meet, Palo Alto won 21 of the
points scored by the visitors. San
Jose made 19, and Santa Clara
followed with 9. In the 50- and
100-yard sprints, Pomeroy of Palo
Alto led his competitors from
start to finish, making the fast
time of 5.4 and 10.2 seconds in
these events.
Miller won the 880-yard dash
with ease after running a well
judged race. Shelton of Stanford
won second place in both the mile
and half-mile, showing consider
able speed in the latter event.
During an intermission in the
meet, candidates for the Varsity
from the other three classes ran an
exciting one-mile relay race with
eight men on each Bide. The race
was declared a dead heat by the
judges.
