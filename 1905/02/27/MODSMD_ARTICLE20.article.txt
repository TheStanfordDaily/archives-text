# Ukiah Athletes May Come.
## 
### 
In all probability the Ukiah
High School will unite with the
Santa Rosa High School in oppos
ing the Freshman track team next
Saturday. The Santa Rosa team
is not as strong as originally sup
posed, so the management is en
deavoring to strengthen the team
which will face the Freshmen by
adding several of the best athletes
from Ukiah.
