# Bispham Charms Audience.
## 
### 
David Bispham presented a song
recital in Assembly Hall Friday
evening which was much appreci
ated by those present. Bispham
has a cultured baritone voice, rich
in tone and full of fire and sym
pathy, which, added to the singer's
vivid dramatic presence, holds his
audience spellbound throughout
his program. His repertoire for
the evening was varied from Men
delssohn's "I'm a Roamer" to the
old English ballad,"The Pretty Cre
ature." Every selection was heart
ily applauded, but perhaps the
most popular selection was the
masterful rendering of Kipling's
"Danny Deever" as set to music by-
Walter Damrosch.
