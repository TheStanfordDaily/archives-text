# UKIAH TO SEND STRONG MEN.
## Will Combine with Santa Rosa Against Freshmen in Next Saturday's Meet. 
### 
Manager Barrett has received a
telegram from the Ukiah High
School accepting the offer to meet
the Freshman track team Saturday.
As originally planned, Saturday's
field-day was to be a dual meet be
tween the Stanford Freshman class
and the Santa Rosa High School,
but as it was feared that such an
affair would be too one-sided,
Ukiah was invited to join forces
with the Santa Rosa athletes. Each
school will bring a team of ten men
and the combination will be better
balanced than the team which was
defeated by the Freshmen last Sat
urday.
Ukiah has always had one of the
strongest teams in the Academic
League, taking first place several
times in the semiannual field-day
of the league. The team this year
is composed mainly of athletes
who have had considerable experi
ence on the track. Santa Rosa is
another member of the Academic
League which has been making a
good record in the recent field-days
of that organization.
Rawles, the captain of the Ukiah
team, is probably the best man on
it. He has a record of 53 seconds
in the 440 and 23.4 in the 220-yard
dash. He also holds a record of
20 feet 6 inches in the broad jump.
Roth, who will run the short
sprints for Ukiah, has made the
100 in 10.2 and the 220-yard dash
in 23.2. Ford, who will take care
of the weights for Ukiah, consis
tently puts the 12-pound shot over
forty-seven feet. McJimpsey is
Ukiah's best high hurdler, and in
the high jump he has cleared 5 feet
6 inches. Ruddick and Henley
can both clear the bar at 10 feet in
the pole-vault, and the former is a
fast low hurdler. Wallack and
Dillingham will be Ukiah's repre
sentatives in the distance runs.
Sanborn is Santa Rosa's strong
est man, holding good records in
the hurdles, the broad jump and
the 440-yard dash. Two years ago
Sanborn played football on the
University of California freshman
team, but he is again attending
high school. Gray of Santa Rosa
has won records of 10.2 seconds in
the 100-yard and 23.3 in the 220-
yard dashes. Page, who will
represent Santa Rosa in the high
jump, has a record of 5 feet 7 inches
in that event. Another good man
on the Santa Rosa team is Jacobs,
who has creditable records in the
broad jump and the hurdles.
The good weather of this week
has caused Trainer Moulton to
have his charges run a number of
trials, which have been made in
fast time. Moulton is trying to
develop sprinting ability in the
distance men, and for this purpose
they have been running 100-yard
trials. Edwards, '07, whose regu
lar event is the 440-yard dash, ran
a trial 100 slightly under 10.2.
The best record of the week was
made this morning in the two-mile
run, when L. G. Burr, '05, went
the long distance in 10.27. The
intercollegiate record for the Coast
is 10.21.
