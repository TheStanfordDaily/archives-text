# Beautifying the Grounds.
## 
### 
A large force of men are now en
gaged in working on the University
grounds to clear them up and to
beautify the campus generally.
The grounds in Memorial Court
have been thoroughly cultivated
and to-day the work of planting a
new crop of grass was commenced.
The field lying between the Eng
lish building and Encina Hall,
which was graded last week, will
be surrounded by a wire fence and
the ground sewed with wheat or
barley. This patch of green in
stead of the former uncultivated
field will add to the general ap
pearance of the grounds. The
fence is considered necessary to
prevent driving and walking across
the field.
