# STUDENTS' GUILD AFFAIRS.
## Few Students Being Treated at the Hospital.â€”Financial Report for January. 
### 
There are but two patients at
present in the Students' Guild Hos
pital, and most of the cases of ill
ness for some time have been of a
minor character. A Christmas
donation of fifty dollars to the hos
pital has been ordered spent by the
Guild Board for surgical instru
ments to be used in equipping the
operating-room. The donor has
withheld his name, but the gift is
from a former patient.
Of the outstanding debts about
$1200 was incurred during the
threatened diptheria epidemic last
semester. Most of this expense was
for anti-toxin, which was used in
inoculating students. It was neces
sary for the Guild to have the anti
toxin on hand, and its purchase
came as a direct expenditure. Most
of the students treated with it have
not yet paid for the services ren
dered them, and the Guild Board
is desirous that the expense be met
as soon as possible.

of the Guild for the month of Jan
