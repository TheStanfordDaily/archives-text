# BOYS' CLUB TO GIVE CONCERT.
## Unique Entertainment Will Be Presented by Columbia Park Lads. 
### 
The Columbia Pi rk Boys'Club
will give a concert in Assembly
Hall on Friday evening, March
24th. This organization is one of
the most notable social organiza
tions in the United States, and is
said to be the most successful boys'
club in existence. It was seven
teen years ago that its prototype,
the old San Francisco Boys' Club,
was founded in the south of Mar
ket street district by Gelett Bur
gess, Sidney Peixotto, and other
men now widely known in the ar
tistic and literary world. The old
club was very successful for a time,
but was later disbanded.
In 1895 Sidney Peixotto, who is
a brother of Ernest Peixotto, the
famous artist, and also of Miss
Jessica Peixotto, one of the few
women who have received the de
gree of doctor of philosophy from
the University of California, re
turned from New York, where he
had been engaged at the old Uni
versity Settlement, and founded
the Columbia Park Boys' Club.
Since that time, in the face of op
position and difficulty, he has held
to his ideals with a tactful persist
ence which amounts to genius.
The result is that he has establish
ed a club so perfectly organized
and so ably supported that its suc
cess is phenomenal. Its well
drilled band has frequent engage
ments in the city, and its military
company is included in all the im
portant parades. In gymnastic
exhibitions the boys also excel and
do some exceptional feats.
For years Peixotto has been
training the 200 boys in music and
acting, and has developed some
fine artists. The boys render
classical music in a masterly man
ner, and also do "coon songs" and
fancy dancing. Some of his work
ers are artists and teachers of re
pute. The repertoire of the chorus
ranges through Schubert, Schuman,
Rubinstein, folk songs of Europe,
Christmas carols, and "darkey"
melodies.
In addition to the concert in As
sembly Hall, the boys will also
give gymnastic performances and
exhibitions of military drilling.
The entertainment will be under
the auspices of the Young Men's
Christian Association.
