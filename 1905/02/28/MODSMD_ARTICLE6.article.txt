# FUNDS BEING GATHERED.
## Collectors Will Make Their Report to Manager Barrett at the End of the Week. 
### 
The work of collecting funds for
the new athletic field is progressing
very favorably. Up to the present
time Manager Barrett has received
$65, but every collector has reported
that money is being contributed
very generously, and it is expected
that the total will be large. Man
ager Barrett has not yet notified
the collectors to turn over their
funds to him, but this will be done
Friday. A careful canvass of the
students residing on the campus
and in Palo Alto is being made,
and it is reported that the results
have been highly satisfactory.
The business men of Palo Alto
have not been approached and all
money thus far collected has come
from students. This systematic
canvass will be carried on until
Thursday or Frida}', when Mana
ger Barrett will receive all of the
money collected and be able to give
an exact statement of the amount
realized.
