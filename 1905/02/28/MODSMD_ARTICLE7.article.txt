# Will Elect New Directors.
## 
### 
A meeting of the members of the
Training House Corporation will
be held to-morrow for the purpose
of electing a new board of directors.
Committees will be appointed for
carrying out the several phases of
work connected with the building
of the new athletic field. A com
mittee for collecting funds for the
field among the alumni will also be
chosen.
The new football field is being
surveyed by J. F. Byxbee, '02, for
securing the levels and locating the
trees. Byxbee is the City Engineer
of Palo Alto, and is giving his ser
vices to the corporation at a lower
rate than is usually charged for
such work.
