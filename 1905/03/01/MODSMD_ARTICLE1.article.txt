Special dispatch to the Daily Palo alto. I
HONOLULU, March 1.—Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford, widow of United
States Senator Stanford, died at 11:40 o'clock last night at the
Moana Hotel here. Suspicious circumstances surround the death of Mrs.'
Stanford. She was taken ill at 11 o'clock and said : 44 1 have been poi
soned !" Her last words were: "This is a horrible death to die!"
Mrs. Stanford came here from San Francisco on the steamer Korea,
February 21. In conversation with Mrs. Henry Highton of San Francisco,
who is now here, Mrs. Stanford said an attempt had been made to poison
her in that city and that this was her reason for sailing on the Korea.
It was Mrs. Stanford's belief, according to Mrs. Highton, that enough
poison had been used to kill twenty persons. It is understood that in
vestigation of the case is now being made by the police of San Francisco.J
The police here are also conducting an investigation.
Before retiring last night Mrs. Stanford took a dose of bicarbonate of
soda which she purchased in San Francisco. It is reported that the soda
contained strychnine, but the report cannot be verified. Dr. H. Humphreys,'
who attended Mrs. Stanford, is now making an examination of the con-j
tents of the bottle, which had not been touched since Mrs. Stanford left
San Francisco. Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Stanford went to a picnic. She
ate heartily on returning to the hotel, .but took no dinner and retired
shortly after 10 o'clock. At 11 o'clock a guest of the hotel who occupied
an adjoining room heard Mrs. Stanford groaning, and, running to the
room, found her lying on the floor. She had evidently tried to summon help.
At the time of Mrs. Stanford's death there were present Miss Berner, her sec
retary, and her maid, May Wilson. Both are prostrated.
No statement has been issued by Dr. Humphreys or by Dr. H. V. Murray,
who was called into consultation. The remains were taken to an undertak-J
ing establishment, where they await an autopsy. The investigation of the (
police has so far failed to find any evidence of poisoning, but the authorities
decline to express an opinion pending the result of the autopsy and the anal
ysis of the bottle of bicarbonate of soda. A box of capsules was alro found in
the room, and these are being analyzed. The guest of the hotel who occu
pied the adjoining suite, and who, hearing Mrs. Stanford groaning, ran to
her assistance, is A. Heunische of San Francisco. Former Judge W. L.
Stanley represents the Stanford estate here.
Dr. Humphreys, who was one of the physicians called in, said: " When I
was called Mrs. Stanford was in convulsions and I applied the quickest rem
edies. It was not possible to save her life. Mrs. Stanford said:
44 4 Doctor, I have been poisoned.'"
41 Mrs. Stanford's condition seemed to indicate strychnine poisoning.
Between convulsions her mind was unusually active, and she saidj: 4 This is
the second time they have tried it. They tried it last January, and I came
here to avoid them.'"
"I have the contents of the bottle," said Dr.JHumphreys,™ 44 but before
taking an analysis I would not swear it contains strychnine, although I am
positive it does contain strychnine."
