# STUDENTS RECEIVE THE NEWS.
## Unexpected Tidings Produce a Deep Feeling of Sorrow on the Campus. 
### 
Just as the students were as
sembling for their first classes this
morning the fateful news of Mrs.
Stanford's untimely death became
generally known. Classes were at
once dismissed, and groups of sor
rowful students gathered to discuss
the sad event.
The first intimation of Mrs.
Stanford's death was received by
her brother, C. G. Lathrop, early
this morning, in the form of a brief
cablegram. A later telegram re
ceived at 8:30 confirmed the newsj
contained in the first, and a notice
was at once issued by Dr. Jordan]
suspending the University work of.
the day.
On all sides the evidence of the
community's grief is manifested.
Flags are at half-mast on the cam
pus and in all the nearby towns.
