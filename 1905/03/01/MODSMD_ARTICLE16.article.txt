# ESTIMATE OF THE ESTATE.
## Private Property Will Amount to Approximately Three Million Dollars. 
### 
The value of Mrs. Stanford's pri
vate estate is estimated at $3,000,-
000. Two years ago she turned
over all of her property with the
exception of the above sum to the
[Hoard of Trustees of the Univer
sity. One million of this reserve
fund has been devoted to the erec
tion of the new library building,
and the money for that purpose
has been left in the hands of Trus
tees Davis, SIOBS, and Grant. The
building will be completed and
turned over to the University in
accordance with Mrs. Stanford's
plan.
The Museum also has been en
tirely supported from the income
of Mrs. Stanford's private fortune,
and it will also become an integral
part of the University. The addi
tions to the Museum building are
almost completed, and as the in
terior requires no woodwork, the
structure is almost ready for occu
pancy. The new gateway recently
erected has been paid for by Mrs.
Stanford, and the decorations in
Memorial Church have been pro-,
vided for from her private purse.
