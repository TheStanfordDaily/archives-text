# TRIBUTE BY DR. JORDAN.
## President of the University Pays Honor to the Character of the Dead Woman. 
### 
President Jordan to-day paid the
following tribute to the dead found
er of the University, with whom he
I had worked so many years:
"The sudden death of Mrs. Stan
ford has come as a great shock to
all of us. She has been so brave
and strong that we hoped for her
return well rested, and that her
last look on earth might be on her
beloved Palo Alto. Hut it was a
joy to her to have been spared so
long—to have lived to see the work
of her husband's life and hers
firmly and fully established.
"Hers has been a life of the most
perfect devotion to her own and
her husband's ideals. If in the
years we knew her she ever had a
selfish feeling, no one ever detected
it. All her thoughts were of the
University and of the way to make
it effective for wisdom and right
eousness.
"No one outside of the Univer
sity can understand the difficulties
in her way in the final establish
ment of the University, and her
patient deeds of self-sacrifice can
be known only to those who saw
them from day to day. Some day
the world may understand a part
of this. It will then know her for
the wisest as well as the most gen
erous friend of learning in our
time. It will know her as the
most loyal and most devoted of
wives. What she did was always
the best she could do. Wise, de
voted, steadfast, prudent, patient,
and just, every good word we can
use was hers by right. The men
and women of the University feel
the loss not alone of the most gen
erous of helpers, but of the nearest
of friends."
