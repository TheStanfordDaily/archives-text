# SENATOR STANFORD'S END.
## Some Circumstances Like Those of His Wife's Death.—Passed Away Twelve Years Ago. 
### 
About 12 o'clock on the evening
of June 20, 18S3, Senator Leland
Stanford, husband of the late Jane
Lathrop Stanford, paßsed away at
his home in Palo Alto. Peculiarly,
the circumstances of his death had
some resemblance to those of Mrs.
Stanford's. The Senator had been
troubled with gout for some time,
and in the last few weeks before his
death had been under the constant
care of a physician. Stringent
measures, however, had been taken
to check the malady, and no serious
results were apprehended The Sen
ator passed the day before his death
in riding over the estate, and re
tired in the best of health. Upon
entering Mr. Stanford's apartment
about midnight a valet found his
lifeless body lying as if still in sleep.
Another curious coincidence con
cerning the death of husband and
wife is that both had shortly before
death came expressed the desire to
accomplish one more thing. The
Senator, in an interview but a week
before he died, said that he desired
to live but ten years longer, and
that he hoped in that space .of time
to see the university which he had
founded one of the leading educa
tional institutions of the country.
Mrs. Stanford had expressed the
wish to see the Museum, in which
she had always taken great interest,
completed. Both died without wit
nessing the fulfillment of their de
sires.
