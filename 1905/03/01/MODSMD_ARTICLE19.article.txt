# POLICY TO BE UNCHANGED.
## Board of Trustees Will Continue Along Same Lines as in the Past. 
### 
The policy that has governed the
University during Mrs. Stanford's
lifetime will he continued along
the same lines. Mrs. Stanford
turned over to the Trustees control
of all the affairs of the University
three and a half years ago. On
December 9, 1901, the deed of
grant of all her property to the
University was officially executed,
and the Board of Trustees assumed
entire control. Mrs. Stanford kept
only enough property in her own
right to provide amply for her per
sonal needs, and even out of this
sum she has spent a large amount
on the University recently. Out
of her private revenues a large sum
has been laid away for the new
library, and the gateway at the
entrance to the University has been
built.
At the time of deeding all her
property to the Hoard of Trustees,
Mrs. Stanford was elected president
of that body by the members. Her
death will necessitate the election
of a new president, and also of a
new member of the board. This
new member of the board will be
chosen by the fourteen surviving
members of that body.
Whenever in San Francisco Mrs.
'Stanford always attended the meet
ings of the Board of Trustees and
took an active part in their pro
ceedings. Her ideas, plans, and
wishes were all known to the mem
bers of the board, and they were
working entirely in accord with
her. The control has been in the
hands of this board since 1901, and
as Mrs. Stanford has been traveling
a large part of that time the affairs
of the University have been trans
acted largely without Mrs. Stan
ford's being able to be present.
It is improbable that any change
will be made in the policy or plans
for the University. The main pol
icy of the University has been to
complete the buildings as soon as
possible and then to devote the rev
enue to the different departments.
This building will continue until
those now in course of erection or
immediately planned are com
pleted. The revenue that is then
released from the buildings will be
devoted to improving the different
departments, but no new depart
ments will be added in the near
future, nor will any immediate
changes be made.
