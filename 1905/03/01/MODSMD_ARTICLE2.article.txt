# MRS. STANFORD'S ILLNESS.
## Contracted a Cold During January Which Caused Her to Seek the Warmer Climate of Japan. 
### 
Mrs. Stanford contracted a se-l
vere cold in the latter part of Janu
ary while residing in her house in
San Francisco. She removed to
San Jose, where she was confined
in her apartments at the Hotel
Vendome for about ten days. The
end of this time found her much
better, and her doctors permitted
her to attend to some University
affairs. But on the advice of her
doctors, who urged a warmer cli
mate and a sea voyage, Mrs. Stan
ford sailed for Japan on Thursday,
February lGth. At this time she
was in good spirits and apparent
ly on the road to recovery. Five
days later, Mr. Lathrop, her broth

er, received a cablegram from Mrsl
Stanford at Honolulu stating that!
she had arrived there safely after
a very rough trip. From that
time until this morning's dispatch
bringing the news of her sudden
death nothing was heard from Mrs.
Stanford, and it was supposed that
she was satisfactorily regaining her
health and strength. It is reported
that Mr. Lathrop received a letter
from Mrs. Stanford this morning.
Mrs. Stanford was accompanied to
Honolulu by Miss Bertha Berner,
her private secretary and traveling
companion.
A few days before contracting
the fatal cold, Mrs. Stanford drank
some mineral water which is re
ported to have contained some
foreign substance. This nauseated
her, but is believed to have left no
permanent effect.
