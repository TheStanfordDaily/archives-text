# REV. MR. GARDNER VERY ILL.
## Sickness That Was Originally of Mild Nature Develops Dangerously. 
### 
The illness of Rev. D. Charles
Gardner, chaplain of the Memorial
Church, which developed about a
week ago, has become dangerous.
The patient is suffering from ty
phoid, contracted from eating
raw oysters received from San
Francisco. Dr. R. L. Wilbur, the
attending physician, Baid to-day
that Mr. Gardner is seriously ill,
but that the disease will not reach
a crisis for several days, and until
this time his exact condition will
not be known.
The patient was confined to his
bed a week ago, but before this
time he had been feeling poorly for
several days. He is at present
being cared for at his home, and
there is little probability that he
will be removed to a hospital.
