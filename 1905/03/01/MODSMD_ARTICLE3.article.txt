## A Woman of Fine Character Who Showed Remarkable Ability in Great Affairs.

1 TANE LATHROP STANFORD
was born August 25, 1828, at
Albany,N. Y., and was the daughter
of Dyer Lathrop, a prominent mer
chant of that city, and of Jane
Ann Lathrop. The affection with
which Mrs. Stanford always re
garded her parents receives lasting
testimonial in the tablets which
have been placed in Memorial
Church at her wish.
At the age of twenty-five she
married Leland Stanford, then a
young lawyer of Albany, N. Y v
Shortly after their marriage, which
â€¢took place in the fall of 1850, they
removed to Port Washington, Wis
consin, where young Stanford es
tablished himself as a practicing
lawyer. Here they remained al
most two years, when he was com
pelled to make a new start by the
destruction of his law library by
fire. Discouraged by this loss, and
attracted by the movement across
the continent to the California gold
fields, young Stanford set out late
in the year 1852 and succeeded
in joining hi 6 two brothers at
Sacramento enrly in the follow
ing spring. His wife, however,
did not accompany him owing
to the hardships of the jour
ney, but remained with her
relatives in the East until her
husband, having successfully car
ried on a business enterprise in
connection with his brothers at
Michigan Bluff, Placer county, for
four years, set up an establishment

of I)is own in Sacramento and sent
for her.
It was then, in 1856, that Mrs.
Stanford first saw California, mak
ing the journey without adventure
by the Nicaragua route. Immedi
ately upon her arrival she joined
her husband, and for the next nine
years they resided in Sacramento.
In this year Stanford started the
foundation of his great fortune,
and also made his entry into the
field of California politics. Twice
he was defeated as Republican
candidate for State Treasurer and
Governor respectively. Finally in
1861 he was chosen Governor of the
State, serving in that capacity dur
ing the stirring times of the Civil
War. Throughout his administra
tion Mrs. Stanford resided in the
executive mansion at Sacramento,
supporting with grace and dignity
the arduous social duties which
fell to the Governor's wife.
In the same year another honor
was conferred upon Governor Stan
ford, that of the presidency of the
Central Pacific Railroad, incorpor
ated about that time for the pur
pose of building a railroad east
across the Rockies and linking the
Atlantic and Pacific. In this en
terprise Governor Stanford was as
sociated with Crocker, Huntington,
and Hopkins, whose names have
since become famous in the history
of California. It was as railroad
president that Governor Stanford
