# STORY OF MRS. STANFORD'S LIFE
## A 						Woman of Fine Character Who Showed Remarkable Ability in Great Affairs. 
### 
1 TANE LATHROP STANFORD
was born August 25, 1828, at
Albany,N. Y., and was the daughter
of Dyer Lathrop, a prominent mer
chant of that city, and of Jane
Ann Lathrop. The affection with
which Mrs. Stanford always re
garded her parents receives lasting
testimonial in the tablets which
have been placed in Memorial
Church at her wish.
At the age of twenty-five she
married Leland Stanford, then a
young lawyer of Albany, N. Y v
Shortly after their marriage, which
•took place in the fall of 1850, they
removed to Port Washington, Wis
consin, where young Stanford es
tablished himself as a practicing
lawyer. Here they remained al
most two years, when he was com
pelled to make a new start by the
destruction of his law library by
fire. Discouraged by this loss, and
attracted by the movement across
the continent to the California gold
fields, young Stanford set out late
in the year 1852 and succeeded
in joining hi 6 two brothers at
Sacramento enrly in the follow
ing spring. His wife, however,
did not accompany him owing
to the hardships of the jour
ney, but remained with her
relatives in the East until her
husband, having successfully car
ried on a business enterprise in
connection with his brothers at
Michigan Bluff, Placer county, for
four years, set up an establishment

of I)is own in Sacramento and sent
for her.
It was then, in 1856, that Mrs.
Stanford first saw California, mak
ing the journey without adventure
by the Nicaragua route. Immedi
ately upon her arrival she joined
her husband, and for the next nine
years they resided in Sacramento.
In this year Stanford started the
foundation of his great fortune,
and also made his entry into the
field of California politics. Twice
he was defeated as Republican
candidate for State Treasurer and
Governor respectively. Finally in
1861 he was chosen Governor of the
State, serving in that capacity dur
ing the stirring times of the Civil
War. Throughout his administra
tion Mrs. Stanford resided in the
executive mansion at Sacramento,
supporting with grace and dignity
the arduous social duties which
fell to the Governor's wife.
In the same year another honor
was conferred upon Governor Stan
ford, that of the presidency of the
Central Pacific Railroad, incorpor
ated about that time for the pur
pose of building a railroad east
across the Rockies and linking the
Atlantic and Pacific. In this en
terprise Governor Stanford was as
sociated with Crocker, Huntington,
and Hopkins, whose names have
since become famous in the history
of California. It was as railroad
president that Governor Stanford


Jane Lathuop Stanford
first showed his wonderful genius)
for organization and for accom-j
plishing that which seemed to oth-j
era impossible.
After the expiration of his term\
as executive, Governor and Mrs.
Stanford moved to San Francisco
in order to come more closely in
touch with the commercial and
social life of the metropolis. Dur
ing all these years that her hus
band was engaged in amassing his
fortune and building his political
fame, Mrs. Stanford was constantly
by his side. In May of 1868 their
only son, Leland Stanford, Jr., was
born, and from that time forth the
energies of both the parents were
devoted almost exclusively to him.
The story of Mrs. Stanford's de
votion to the boy is too well known,
too deeply associated with the ex
istence of the University to require
more than the slightest mention.
It was in order to satisfy the de
sire of the parents for their son's
enjoyment and education that the
fatal" trip to Italy was made in
1884. Leland was at the time only
sixteen years old, and intended en
tering Yale in the succeeding fall.
Greece and Rome had been visited,
and it was in the city of Florence
that Leland suddenly contracted a
fever, and died on the thirteenth
day of March, 1884.
The remaining years of the liven
of both Governor and Mrs. Stan
ford were as completely wrapped
in the University which they
erected to the memory of their son
as they had formerly been in cher
ishing the son himself. From the
inception of the idea of devoting
Leland's birthright to a great in
stitution of learning, Mrs. Stanford
gave herself up completely to it.
The story of her life since that
time has been one of sacrifices made
in behalf of the University and de
votion to the memory of the one
after whom it was named.
In 1887 the cornerstone of the
University was laid, and Governor
Stanford, who was elected to the
United States Senate shortly after,
in delivering his address on the oc
casion, said that he also spoke for
"one whose prayers are always that
the University may become a bene
factor of man kind." In the days
when the University was building
Mrs. Stanford watched its progress
with anxious eyes, and joined with
her husband in seeking to make it
embody her own as well as his
ideals.
But it was not until two years
aiter the gates of the University
were opened, when death deprived
her of her husband in June, 1893,
that all the strength in Mrs. Stan
ford's character became evident.
With the policy of a great univer
sity to control, with the ideas of
her husband left unsettled by his
sudden death, she was compelled
to take upon her own shoulders re
sponsibilities that would have been
too heavy for many men. Two
striking instances of the fullness of
her devotion to the University
stand out above the rest. In the
early days of the University its fi
nancial interests became involved
in a suit with the Government, and
pending the decision of the case
in the Supreme Court the Univer
sity was practically without funds
for its maintenance. The situation
at times grew so serious that the
further existence of the University
was threatened. Mrs. Stanford
during these years of trouble

braved the brunt of the storm. The
University's capital was completely
tied up, but there was one Bource
of salvation: time and again she
came forward with money from her
own purse, and on several oc
casions made personal sacrifices to
secure more funds. In the end, on
March 2, 1896, the skies cleared,
the suit was decided in favor of the
University, and Mrs. Stanford had
saved her husband's and her son's
memorial to posterity.
On December 9, 1901, Mrs. Stan
ford endowed the University with
the bulk of her fortune, placing
practically all of it except her San
Francisco residence in the hands
of the Trustees. By this magnifi
cent gift Stanford was made the
weathiest university in the world,
with an endowment of $30,000,000,
and Jane Lathrop Stanford "de
livered unto the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity and to their successors forever,
all her rights, hereinafter described,
as widow, heir and legatee of her
late husband, Leland Stanford."
Not satisfied with devoting the
greater part of her fortune to the
University, Mrs. Stanford was con
stantly making new gifts out of
the smaller portion reserved for
herself. Assembly Hall was built
by her in 1898; the Memorial
Church was built and dedicated to
,the memory of her husband; shp
sought to make the Museum the
greatest in the United States, dedi
eating it to her son; and her latest
gift to the University is the mag
nificent $750,000 library whose
walls are now rising.
Having seen the University firm

ly established, Mrs. Stanford de
voted much of her time during the
last few years to travel. In 1901
she started on a tour around the
world, but returned after proceed
ing as far as Cairo. In 1903 she
spent several months in Japan,
India and China. But never in
the course of her travels was the
University forgotten for a moment.
Whether at home or abroad, her
wishes controlled its policy, her
interest acted in the direction of its
affairs; her munificent bounty con
stantly was felt wherever it was
needed. In the typhoid epidemic
of 1903, Mrs. Stanford contributed
substantially to the care of those
who needed assistance. \Y r hile
abroad she was continually seeking
objects with which to supply the
Museum, to beautify buildings, or
in some way to contribute further
to the University.
Upon her return from the Orient
about a year ago, the students of
the University gathered to welcome
home once more the surviving
founder. A far different scene will
take place when the last return is
made next week, but the memory
of the brave, devoted woman who
has given so splendid an example
of self-sacrifice will always find a
place in the hearts of thousands of
Stanford men and women as long
as Stanford Universitv exists.

United States Senate shortly after,
in delivering his address on the oc
casion, said that he also spoke for
"one whose prayers are always that
the University may become a bene
factor of man kind." In the days
when the University was building
Mrs. Stanford watched its progress
with anxious eyes, and joined with
her husband in seeking to make it
embody her own as well as his
ideals.
But it was not until two years
aiter the gates of the University
were opened, when death deprived
her of her husband in June, 1893,
that all the strength in Mrs. Stan
ford's character became evident.
With the policy of a great univer
sity to control, with the ideas of
her husband left unsettled by his
sudden death, she was compelled
to take upon her own shoulders re
sponsibilities that would have been
too heavy for many men. Two
striking instances of the fullness of
her devotion to the University
stand out above the rest. In the
early days of the University its fi
nancial interests became involved
in a suit with the Government, and
pending the decision of the case
in the Supreme Court the Univer
sity was practically without funds
for its maintenance. The situation
at times grew so serious that the
further existence of the University
was threatened. Mrs. Stanford
during these years of trouble

braved the brunt of the storm. The
University's capital was completely
tied up, but there was one Bource
of salvation: time and again she
came forward with money from her
own purse, and on several oc
casions made personal sacrifices to
secure more funds. In the end, on
March 2, 1896, the skies cleared,
the suit was decided in favor of the
University, and Mrs. Stanford had
saved her husband's and her son's
memorial to posterity.
On December 9, 1901, Mrs. Stan
ford endowed the University with
the bulk of her fortune, placing
practically all of it except her San
Francisco residence in the hands
of the Trustees. By this magnifi
cent gift Stanford was made the
weathiest university in the world,
with an endowment of $30,000,000,
and Jane Lathrop Stanford "de
livered unto the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity and to their successors forever,
all her rights, hereinafter described,
as widow, heir and legatee of her
late husband, Leland Stanford."
Not satisfied with devoting the
greater part of her fortune to the
University, Mrs. Stanford was con
stantly making new gifts out of
the smaller portion reserved for
herself. Assembly Hall was built
by her in 1898; the Memorial
Church was built and dedicated to
,the memory of her husband; shp
sought to make the Museum the
greatest in the United States, dedi
eating it to her son; and her latest
gift to the University is the mag
nificent $750,000 library whose
walls are now rising.
Having seen the University firm

ly established, Mrs. Stanford de
voted much of her time during the
last few years to travel. In 1901
she started on a tour around the
world, but returned after proceed
ing as far as Cairo. In 1903 she
spent several months in Japan,
India and China. But never in
the course of her travels was the
University forgotten for a moment.
Whether at home or abroad, her
wishes controlled its policy, her
interest acted in the direction of its
affairs; her munificent bounty con
stantly was felt wherever it was
needed. In the typhoid epidemic
of 1903, Mrs. Stanford contributed
substantially to the care of those
who needed assistance. \Y r hile
abroad she was continually seeking
objects with which to supply the
Museum, to beautify buildings, or
in some way to contribute further
to the University.
Upon her return from the Orient
about a year ago, the students of
the University gathered to welcome
home once more the surviving
founder. A far different scene will
take place when the last return is
made next week, but the memory
of the brave, devoted woman who
has given so splendid an example
of self-sacrifice will always find a
place in the hearts of thousands of
Stanford men and women as long
as Stanford Universitv exists.
1 TANE LATHROP STANFORD
was born August 25, 1828, at
Albany,N. Y., and was the daughter
of Dyer Lathrop, a prominent mer
chant of that city, and of Jane
Ann Lathrop. The affection with
which Mrs. Stanford always re
garded her parents receives lasting
testimonial in the tablets which
have been placed in Memorial
Church at her wish.
At the age of twenty-five she
married Leland Stanford, then a
young lawyer of Albany, N. Y v
Shortly after their marriage, which
•took place in the fall of 1850, they
removed to Port Washington, Wis
consin, where young Stanford es
tablished himself as a practicing
lawyer. Here they remained al
most two years, when he was com
pelled to make a new start by the
destruction of his law library by
fire. Discouraged by this loss, and
attracted by the movement across
the continent to the California gold
fields, young Stanford set out late
in the year 1852 and succeeded
in joining hi 6 two brothers at
Sacramento enrly in the follow
ing spring. His wife, however,
did not accompany him owing
to the hardships of the jour
ney, but remained with her
relatives in the East until her
husband, having successfully car
ried on a business enterprise in
connection with his brothers at
Michigan Bluff, Placer county, for
four years, set up an establishment

of I)is own in Sacramento and sent
for her.
It was then, in 1856, that Mrs.
Stanford first saw California, mak
ing the journey without adventure
by the Nicaragua route. Immedi
ately upon her arrival she joined
her husband, and for the next nine
years they resided in Sacramento.
In this year Stanford started the
foundation of his great fortune,
and also made his entry into the
field of California politics. Twice
he was defeated as Republican
candidate for State Treasurer and
Governor respectively. Finally in
1861 he was chosen Governor of the
State, serving in that capacity dur
ing the stirring times of the Civil
War. Throughout his administra
tion Mrs. Stanford resided in the
executive mansion at Sacramento,
supporting with grace and dignity
the arduous social duties which
fell to the Governor's wife.
In the same year another honor
was conferred upon Governor Stan
ford, that of the presidency of the
Central Pacific Railroad, incorpor
ated about that time for the pur
pose of building a railroad east
across the Rockies and linking the
Atlantic and Pacific. In this en
terprise Governor Stanford was as
sociated with Crocker, Huntington,
and Hopkins, whose names have
since become famous in the history
of California. It was as railroad
president that Governor Stanford


Jane Lathuop Stanford
first showed his wonderful genius)
for organization and for accom-j
plishing that which seemed to oth-j
era impossible.
After the expiration of his term\
as executive, Governor and Mrs.
Stanford moved to San Francisco
in order to come more closely in
touch with the commercial and
social life of the metropolis. Dur
ing all these years that her hus
band was engaged in amassing his
fortune and building his political
fame, Mrs. Stanford was constantly
by his side. In May of 1868 their
only son, Leland Stanford, Jr., was
born, and from that time forth the
energies of both the parents were
devoted almost exclusively to him.
The story of Mrs. Stanford's de
votion to the boy is too well known,
too deeply associated with the ex
istence of the University to require
more than the slightest mention.
It was in order to satisfy the de
sire of the parents for their son's
enjoyment and education that the
fatal" trip to Italy was made in
1884. Leland was at the time only
sixteen years old, and intended en
tering Yale in the succeeding fall.
Greece and Rome had been visited,
and it was in the city of Florence
that Leland suddenly contracted a
fever, and died on the thirteenth
day of March, 1884.
The remaining years of the liven
of both Governor and Mrs. Stan
ford were as completely wrapped
in the University which they
erected to the memory of their son
as they had formerly been in cher
ishing the son himself. From the
inception of the idea of devoting
Leland's birthright to a great in
stitution of learning, Mrs. Stanford
gave herself up completely to it.
The story of her life since that
time has been one of sacrifices made
in behalf of the University and de
votion to the memory of the one
after whom it was named.
In 1887 the cornerstone of the
University was laid, and Governor
Stanford, who was elected to the
United States Senate shortly after,
in delivering his address on the oc
casion, said that he also spoke for
"one whose prayers are always that
the University may become a bene
factor of man kind." In the days

Shortly after their marriage, which
•took place in the fall of 1850, they
removed to Port Washington, Wis
consin, where young Stanford es
tablished himself as a practicing
lawyer. Here they remained al
most two years, when he was com
pelled to make a new start by the
destruction of his law library by
fire. Discouraged by this loss, and
attracted by the movement across
the continent to the California gold
fields, young Stanford set out late
in the year 1852 and succeeded
in joining hi 6 two brothers at
Sacramento enrly in the follow
ing spring. His wife, however,
did not accompany him owing
to the hardships of the jour
ney, but remained with her
relatives in the East until her
husband, having successfully car
ried on a business enterprise in
connection with his brothers at
Michigan Bluff, Placer county, for
four years, set up an establishment

of I)is own in Sacramento and sent
for her.
It was then, in 1856, that Mrs.
Stanford first saw California, mak
ing the journey without adventure
by the Nicaragua route. Immedi
ately upon her arrival she joined
her husband, and for the next nine
years they resided in Sacramento.
In this year Stanford started the
foundation of his great fortune,
and also made his entry into the
field of California politics. Twice
he was defeated as Republican
candidate for State Treasurer and
Governor respectively. Finally in
1861 he was chosen Governor of the
State, serving in that capacity dur
ing the stirring times of the Civil
War. Throughout his administra
tion Mrs. Stanford resided in the
executive mansion at Sacramento,
supporting with grace and dignity
the arduous social duties which
fell to the Governor's wife.
In the same year another honor
was conferred upon Governor Stan
ford, that of the presidency of the
Central Pacific Railroad, incorpor
ated about that time for the pur
pose of building a railroad east
across the Rockies and linking the
Atlantic and Pacific. In this en
terprise Governor Stanford was as
sociated with Crocker, Huntington,
and Hopkins, whose names have
since become famous in the history
of California. It was as railroad
president that Governor Stanford


Jane Lathuop Stanford
first showed his wonderful genius)
for organization and for accom-j
plishing that which seemed to oth-j
era impossible.
After the expiration of his term\
as executive, Governor and Mrs.
Stanford moved to San Francisco
in order to come more closely in
touch with the commercial and
social life of the metropolis. Dur
ing all these years that her hus
band was engaged in amassing his
fortune and building his political
fame, Mrs. Stanford was constantly
by his side. In May of 1868 their
only son, Leland Stanford, Jr., was
born, and from that time forth the
energies of both the parents were
devoted almost exclusively to him.
The story of Mrs. Stanford's de
votion to the boy is too well known,
too deeply associated with the ex
istence of the University to require
more than the slightest mention.
It was in order to satisfy the de
sire of the parents for their son's
enjoyment and education that the
fatal" trip to Italy was made in
1884. Leland was at the time only
sixteen years old, and intended en
tering Yale in the succeeding fall.
Greece and Rome had been visited,
and it was in the city of Florence
that Leland suddenly contracted a
fever, and died on the thirteenth
day of March, 1884.
The remaining years of the liven
of both Governor and Mrs. Stan
ford were as completely wrapped
in the University which they
erected to the memory of their son
as they had formerly been in cher
ishing the son himself. From the
inception of the idea of devoting
Leland's birthright to a great in
stitution of learning, Mrs. Stanford
gave herself up completely to it.
The story of her life since that
time has been one of sacrifices made
in behalf of the University and de
votion to the memory of the one
after whom it was named.
In 1887 the cornerstone of the
University was laid, and Governor
Stanford, who was elected to the
United States Senate shortly after,
in delivering his address on the oc
casion, said that he also spoke for
"one whose prayers are always that
the University may become a bene
factor of man kind." In the days
when the University was building
Mrs. Stanford watched its progress
with anxious eyes, and joined with
her husband in seeking to make it
embody her own as well as his
ideals.
But it was not until two years
aiter the gates of the University
were opened, when death deprived
her of her husband in June, 1893,
that all the strength in Mrs. Stan
ford's character became evident.
With the policy of a great univer
sity to control, with the ideas of
her husband left unsettled by his
sudden death, she was compelled
to take upon her own shoulders re
sponsibilities that would have been
too heavy for many men. Two
striking instances of the fullness of
her devotion to the University
stand out above the rest. In the
early days of the University its fi
nancial interests became involved
in a suit with the Government, and
pending the decision of the case
in the Supreme Court the Univer
sity was practically without funds
for its maintenance. The situation
at times grew so serious that the
further existence of the University
was threatened. Mrs. Stanford
during these years of trouble

braved the brunt of the storm. The
University's capital was completely
tied up, but there was one Bource
of salvation: time and again she
came forward with money from her
own purse, and on several oc
casions made personal sacrifices to
secure more funds. In the end, on
March 2, 1896, the skies cleared,
the suit was decided in favor of the
University, and Mrs. Stanford had
saved her husband's and her son's
memorial to posterity.
On December 9, 1901, Mrs. Stan
ford endowed the University with
the bulk of her fortune, placing
practically all of it except her San
Francisco residence in the hands
of the Trustees. By this magnifi
cent gift Stanford was made the
weathiest university in the world,
with an endowment of $30,000,000,
and Jane Lathrop Stanford "de
livered unto the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity and to their successors forever,
all her rights, hereinafter described,
as widow, heir and legatee of her
late husband, Leland Stanford."
Not satisfied with devoting the
greater part of her fortune to the
University, Mrs. Stanford was con
stantly making new gifts out of
the smaller portion reserved for
herself. Assembly Hall was built
by her in 1898; the Memorial
Church was built and dedicated to
,the memory of her husband; shp
sought to make the Museum the
greatest in the United States, dedi
eating it to her son; and her latest
gift to the University is the mag
nificent $750,000 library whose
walls are now rising.
Having seen the University firm

ly established, Mrs. Stanford de
voted much of her time during the
last few years to travel. In 1901
she started on a tour around the
world, but returned after proceed
ing as far as Cairo. In 1903 she
spent several months in Japan,
India and China. But never in
the course of her travels was the
University forgotten for a moment.
Whether at home or abroad, her
wishes controlled its policy, her
interest acted in the direction of its
affairs; her munificent bounty con
stantly was felt wherever it was
needed. In the typhoid epidemic
of 1903, Mrs. Stanford contributed
substantially to the care of those
who needed assistance. \Y r hile
abroad she was continually seeking
objects with which to supply the
Museum, to beautify buildings, or
in some way to contribute further
to the University.
Upon her return from the Orient
about a year ago, the students of
the University gathered to welcome
home once more the surviving
founder. A far different scene will
take place when the last return is
made next week, but the memory
of the brave, devoted woman who
has given so splendid an example
of self-sacrifice will always find a
place in the hearts of thousands of
Stanford men and women as long
as Stanford Universitv exists.
