It is with feelings of the mosi
profound sorrow that the Univer
sity public learns of the passing of
Mrs. Stanford. It is doubly hard
that the death of this venerable
woman should have taken place
far from the place she loved so
well and away from those who
reverenced her as friend or as bene
factor. Her untimely end is an
irreparable loss to the University,
for until its very occurrence she
was busy with plans for the further
development of the institution to
which she had devoted the best ef
forts of her life. The attainment
of the University to its present de
gree of usefulness is due in great
part to the absolute consecration of
Mrs. Stanford to its interests, and
the absence of her guiding hand
will be felt in no small degree. It
is as the highest type of devoted
motherhood that the memory of
Mrs. Stanford will be most tenderh
cherished. This devotion to hei
child was transmuted into service
for humanity, which has resulted
in the erection of our beloved Uni
versity. To the possession of l<>ft_\
ideals and a high degree of intelli
gence was added iin Mrs. Stanford
all of those qualities and graces
which distinguish lovely, gracious
womanhood.
