Special dispatch to the Daily Palo Alto.
QIAN FRANCISCO, March 2. — The following cablegram was received
' here this afternoon :
"HONOLULU, March 2.—John Spillane, Chief of Police of
San Francisco : — The Stanford bottle of bicarbonate of soda con
tained 43 drams, in which there were 662 grains of strychnine.
An examination of the organs is now under way. Will cable
later ; full particulars by mail.
" WILLIAM HENRY, High Sheriff, Honolulu."
Indications show to day that the local police suspect a member of Mrs.
Stanford's household of having placed strychnine in the bottle of bicarbon-j
ate of soda. High Sheriff Henry says he expects that the chemists who
have been engaged since yesterday in analyzing the contents of Mrs.l
Stanford's stomach will make their report at 4 o'clock this afternoon. The
inquest will be held to-night.
Acting Chief of Police Spillane has started a search in San Francisco
for the poisoner of Mrs. Stanford. It is the belief of the San Francisco
police that the bicarbonate of soda and strychnine were purchased in this
city and secretly dropped into the refilled bottle by a person connected
with the Stanford household here, and it is the purpose of the officials to
fix the responsibility and punish the guilty. The bottle containing the
bicarbonate of soda originally was purchased in Australia. But according
to Miss Bertha Berner and the maid, May Hunt, the bottle was refilled in this
city at a local drug store, — which one they do not know. Certainly no drug
gist possibly could make a mistake and mix 662 grains of strychnine with
bicarbonate of soda.
This afternoon Dr. W. Gr. Stevens made this positive declaration : "Six
hundred and sixty-two grains of strychnine easily would kill 662 persons.
The maximum dose administered is only one-fifteenth of a grain, while the
average is one-fortieth of a grain."
The finding of this vast amount of poison in the bicarbonate bottle puz
zles Mrs. Stanford's relatives in this city. Mountford S. Wilson, chief counsel,
and Charles G.Lathrop were in a quandary to-day when, at 10:30 o'clock,the
message was received declaring Dr. Humphreys' opinion that Mrs. Stanford
was poisoned. Neither Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Lathrop would make any state
ment until such time as they received private advices from the islands. They
were closeted a greater portion of the day with D. O. Mills, and it is believed
the will of the dead woman was under discussion, as well as the disposition of
the remains.
