President Jordan was interviewed
this afternoon in regard to the'
holding of various social activities
after Mrs. Stanford's funeral andj
he expressed himself as in favor oi
a month of mourning. No official
order will be issued to that effect,'
but it is believed that those inj
charge of social affairs planned for
next month will arrange for their
postponement.
The Junior farce committee heldj
a meeting this afternoon and de
cided to postpone the opera until
April 20th. It is probable that the
other class committees will take
similar action as socn as they can
be called together.
