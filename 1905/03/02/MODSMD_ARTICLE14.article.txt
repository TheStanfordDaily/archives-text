# Chaplain Gardner's Condition.
## 
### 
The condition of Rev. D. Charles
Gardner remains unchanged. His
temperature is still dangerously
high, and Last night he had very
little rest. Dr. R. L. Wilbur, who
is in charge of the case, said this
morning that the crisis of the fever
will not be reached for at least a
week. Rev. Mr. Gardner has not
yet been informed of Mrs. Stan
ford's death, as it is feared the shock
might prove too much for him.
Owing to the quiet which is neces
sary on account of Mr. Gardner's
nervous condition, Mrs. Gardner
requests that all those who come to
the house will do so as quietly as
possible.
