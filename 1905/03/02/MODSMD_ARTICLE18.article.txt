# FUNERAL OF SENATOR STANFORD.
## Description of the Last Rites Over the Body of the Founder of the University Twelve Years Ago. 
### 
SENATOR LELAND STAN-|
FORD died on the night of
June 20, 1893, and his remains
were laid away on the following
Saturday, June 24th. It was the
wish of the Senator that the last
services over his body should be
simple and without any show of
splendor. This desire of the vener
able founder was fully respected,
and other than a few elaborate
floral pieces, nothing displayed the
great wealth oi ! the deceased.
As the death occurred during the
summer holidays, but few students
were on the campus, and the stu
dents took no part in the funeral
ceremonies. Until the day of the
burial the remains lay enclosed in
a plain casket, heavily draped in
black, in the northwest wing of the
residence. Until the morning of
the funeral day Mrs. Stanford kept
herself in close seclusion, but on
this day she received the intimate
friends of the family.
All the details of the service were
arranged and carried through with
out a hitch. As the deceased man
had requested, eight veteran loco
motive engineers were chosen to act
as actual pall-bearers. The public
services were held under the great
arch at the northern entrance to
the quadrangle, at whose dedica
tion the Senator had but shortly
before taken a leading part. There
was gathered the crowd of people
who had come to pay their last re
spects to the remains of the de
parted Senator. Business in Palo
Alto and Menlo Park waß suspend
ed for the day. Two special trains
of ten cars each and bearing a
thousand people came from San
Francisco in the morning. The
first arrived at Menlo Park at 9
o'clock in the morning and carried
the pall-bearers and intimate
friends, who were immediately
driven to the Stanford residence.
The rest of the people were carried
on and switched up to the Univer
sity, where they gathered in the
quadrangle awaiting the arrival of
the funeral procession.
Promptly at 10 o'clock the fu

neral cortege left the residence.
Leading, on foot, were the employes
of the estate, about 150 in number.
Following in carriages came the 1
clergy, and immediately after them
the hearse, heavily draped in black.
The long line of honorary pall
bearers, comprising many promi
nent men, walked behind the
hearse, and after them came the
carriages of the family and friends.
Thus formed, the procession moved
down Eucalyptus avenue to thej
county road, ;ind from there turned!
into the University grounds by the]
main driveway, proceeding to thej
arch, where the great crowd was!
waiting. A platform about threej
feet in height and covered above
with canvas, all magnificently dec
orated with flowers, had been erect
ed directly beneath the arch, and
upon this the casket was placed.
On each side of the platform stood
the only two elaborate floral
pieces. One was a locomotive and
tender of the old type and en
graved "Gov. Stanford." The
other was a representation of the
Senator's favorite filly, Mary As
borne, beautifully wrought out of
sweet peas, the exact color of the
famous horse —dappled bay.
The actual ceremonies were as
simple as could be arranged. The
impressive Episcopal service was
read by an attending clergyman,
and after this a selected choir ren
dered several hymns. Dr. Horatio
Stebbins of the First Unitarian
Church of San Francisco then de
livered the eulogy over the body,
and the singing of another hymn
finished the service. The cover of
the casket was removed and the
vast throng stretching around the
whole quadrangle filed slowly past
for a last look at the dead.
The funeral procession formed
again and moved slowly toward
the mausoleum, to which the last
touches had been given a single
day before the Senator's death
Here, after a brief and impressive
ceremony, the casket was en
shrouded in a steel covering and
lowered into the open sarcophagus.
