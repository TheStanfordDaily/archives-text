# MRS. STANFORD'S ESTATE.
## The 						Probable Beneficiaries Under the Will of the Deceased Philanthropist. 
### 
Speculation as to how Mrs. Stan
ford's great fortune, which is esti
mated at $3,000,000, will be di
vided has already begun. While
it is probable that the contents of
Mrs. Stanford's last will and testa
ment are known only to her
brother, C. G. Lathrop, and her
legal adviser, Mountford S. Wilson,
many conjectures are being made
as to its provisions. Attorney
Wilson drew up the document, but
he refuses to discuss its terms.
Many believe that some of the
money will go to the University to
which she has already given so
liberally.
Mrs. Stanford's closest blood
relatives now living are Charles
G. and Ariel Lathrop, both broth
ers. The latter resides in Albany,
N. Y., and for the pa6t eight or
nine years has not been so close to
Mrs. Stanford as Charles G.
Lathrop. He is childless, but an

other brother, Daniel Lathrop, now
deceased, is survived by two daugh
ters, Mrs. Walter Hanson and Mrs.
G. P. Lawton, both residents of
New York State.
Of her three surviving nieces,
Miss Jennie Lathrop, daughter of
Charles G. Lathrop, is the favorite,
and it is highly probable that she
and her father, Charles G. Lathrop,
will be the largest individual bene
ficiaries. Leland S. Lathrop, son
of Charles G. Lathrop, was also
once a great favorite of his aunt,
but of late years he has not been
as close to her as formerly.
There are living in California
and in the East twelve nieces and
nephews of Senator Stanford. The
nephews and nieces now in Cali
fornia are Jerome B. Stanford and
Mrs. E. R. Taylor of San Francisco
and Josiah W. and Gertrude Stan
ford of Warm Springs. These are
the children of Governor Stan
ford's brothers, Josiah and A. P.
Stanford, both deceased. Other
deceased brothers of Governor
Stanford left a number of children,
eight of whom are now living.
