# "TO MRS. STANFORD."
## Tribute Paid to the Surviving Founder by Charles K. Field Six Years Ago. 
### 
I The following verses were read
by Charles K. Field, '95, in an
rswering the toast "To Mrs. Stan-
Iford" at an alumni luncheon in
Roble Hall, May 23, 1899:
''The child of California
Shall be our child," they said,
Bent in the heavy shadow where
Their dearest hope lay dead;
" Henceforward shall our tenderness
Encompass, by God's grace,
The lives of those we make our own
To cherish, in his place."
They made a cradle wondrously,
Mid flowers and sunlight sweet;
SThey laid the treasures of the world
About their children's feet.
Yet, when this labor of their love
Was but begun, at best,
God, leaning from his heaven,called
The father to his rest.
We reverence his memory;
The power of his name
Is in our loyal hearts to-day,
The impulse of his fame;
But ah, how can her children's love
Be adequately shown
The mother-heart that folded us
And fought for us. alone!
Gray mother of our fostered youth,
Some day, through clearer air,
Your eyes shall search our souls,
and see
What you have written there.
Take now the comfort of our love,
Till that rich guerdon when
The God you bring us near to
Gives you your own again!
The great kindliness of Mrs.
Stanford is well indicated in the
following words, taken from her
note expressing regret at her in
ability to be with the alumni on
this occasion:
"I thank you all, as alumni, for
your kind thoughts, and for your
interest; and now let me ask as a
great personal favor that you will
remember me in your prayers a?
long as I am worthy of them and
here in earth life. Ever your well
wisher, let me ask to be your
adopted mother."
