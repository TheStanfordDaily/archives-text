# GOVERNOR PARDEE SPEAKS.
## Chief Executive of the State Honors the Memory of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
Governor Pardee pays the follow
ling tribute to the memory of Mrs.
■Stanford:
"The death of Mrs. Stanford
■takes from California another of
Iher pioneer women; another of
■those who had much to do with the
lup-building of the State; one whose
■name will be forever inseparably
land most prominently linked with
lour history.
"With her husband, Bhe shared
[the discomforts attendant on resi
lience here (in Sacramento) in the
.early days; with him she shared
the soul-trying cares and worries
incident to the inaugurating of that
vast and apparently impossible
enterprise, the Central Pacific rail
road. When success was achieved
and Leland Stanford and his asso
ciates attained sudden and great
wealth, Mrs. Stanford, like her
husband, remembered always the
friends of other days, and her
bounty was never withheld from
those who deserved a portion of it.
"When in the dark days of the
Rebellion Leland Stanford so safe
ly guided from the gubernatorial
chair the affairs of California's
people, his devoted wife, as he him
self so often proudly said, was
always one of his chief counselors
and guides. And when from Gov
ernor her husband was promoted
to the Senate of the United States,
Mrs. Stanford, as she always did,
shone pre-eminently in her new and
untried station.
•' "All California knows of her
public benefactions, most promi
nent of which, of course, is that
great university in whose halls
not only California's, but also all
the nation's young men and women
may freely gather. Erected and
endowed in honor of their only
child, Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity will always stand a monu
ment to Leland Stanford and Jane
Stanford, two Californians who,
owing everything to California, re
turned to California's youth that
which California had enabled them
to gather up.
"All California mourns tbedeath
of this good woman. But especial
ly keen is the grief of that rapidly
diminishing number of our people
who, knowing her in the days be
foreshe came into her great wealth,
were proud to know her ever after
ward. And to these of her friends
it will always be a source of keen
regret that it was not vouchsafed
her to yield up her spirit here in
California, for which she did so
much, among the old friends and
the newer, those who knew her as
she was, and loved her for her
self."
