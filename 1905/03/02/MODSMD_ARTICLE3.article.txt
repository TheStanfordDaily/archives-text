# EXPRESSES THE DEEP SORROW OF GENERAL STUDENT BODY.
## Committee Gives Voice to the Appreciaton of the Self-Sacrificing Devotion of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
A COMMITTEE appointed by Arthur M. Dibble, '05, president of the
i Associated Students, to express the sorrow of the student body at
the death of Mrs. Stanford, has adopted the following statement :

The student body of Leland Stanford Junior University realizes that by
the passing of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford the institution has lost its great
est benefactor, and the students their best friend. Every person who has spent
his four years here must have honored Mrs. Stanford for her noble and self
sacrificing devotion to a great ideal, and to the memory of her husband and
her son. And, most of all, he must have reciprocated the genuine affection
which Mrs. Stanford always showed toward the students, whom she never
seemed to regard as simply a part of a splendid educational scheme.
Her work will endure on the foundations so wisely laid ; and future gen
erations of students will receive the full measure of the gift which only time
can perfect. But we who have been privileged in some degree to know Mrs.
Stanford cannot help regretting, for those students of the future, that they
can never feel, as we have felt, the presence of the one to whom the Univer
sity meant all, — that University to which she had given her all in order that
it might stand. In her presence the meaning of the gift grew plain, and we
understood the real significance of the phrase, 41 our alma mater."
