Special attention is called to an
item printed in another column in
which the President of the Univer
sity suggests a month of mourning
for Mrs. Stanford. The President
advises merely that all social func
tions for the month following the
burial of Mrs. Stanford be canceled:
beyond that he leaves everything to
the discretion of the students them
selves. This leaves the question of
the class dances and other enter
prises unsettled. The problem of
where the line shall be drawn is
not an easy one to decide, but when
the decision is made it should be
such that its propriety will be be
yond dispute. We may well afford
to forego the pleasures of a few
weeks to do the fullest honor to the
memory of the woman whose noble
work hae meant so much for us.
