Special dispntch to the Daily Palo Alto.
QAN FRANCISCO, March 3.— There have been no developments of im-,
poi'tance in the Stanford poisoning case during the day. The wires
have brought nothing from Honolulu as to the result of the autopsy held
upon the remains, and there is no further official news as to the analysis'
of the bicarbonate of soda. Until the result of this autopsy is definitely!
known, the police of the city are somewhat handicapped in their work,'
for they do not care to take the responsibility of making arrests until it is
positively known that poison was taken into Mrs. Stanford's stomach.
Captain Culladan of the Morse detective agency, who has been hand
ling the poisoning case for the Stanford family, held a conference with
Chief of Police Spillane and Captain of Detectives Burnett to-day. It is
understood that all the evidence against the various members of the Stan
ford household was considered carefully, with the result that the greatest
suspicion narrows down to three persons as the possible guilty ones if
murder has been done. It is believed that arrests will follow immediately]
upon the receipt of confirmation from Honolulu that poison has been'
found in Mrs. Stanford's stomach.
