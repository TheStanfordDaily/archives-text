# PASS RHODES EXAMINATION.
## H.A. Moran, '05, and F.B. Tucker, '04, Eligible to Hold the Scholarship. 
### 
A cablegram from London re-|
ceived by President Jordan Btates
that H. A. Moran, '05, and F. B.
Tucker, '04, successfully passed the,
Rhodes scholarship examinations
held here last January. The final
award of the scholarship will be
made by the California Rhodes
Scholarship Committee at its next
meeting. While both men passed
the examinations, the scholarship
will undoubtedly be awarded to
Moran, as he is an undergraduate,
and it is the policy of the commit
tee to give the scholarship to an
undergraduate rather than to a
graduate student. Tucker took
the examinations in the hope that'
if no undergraduate passed, thej
scholarship would fall to him.
Moran is a Greek major andj
registers from Palo Alto. He is
president of the English Club, is
an officer of the Young Men's
Christian Association, and has been
a member of the Varsity track
team. Last year he was a member
of the board of directors of the
Students' Guild. He is a member
of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.
Tucker is a graduate student in
the Greek department and registers
from Washington, D. C.
The other students who took the
examinations were P. E. Millar,'o6,
and M. M. Stearns, '06.
