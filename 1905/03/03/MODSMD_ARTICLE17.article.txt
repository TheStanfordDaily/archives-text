# FLUGEL OUTLINES DICTIONARY
## Gives History and Methods of Compiling Chaucer Lexicon Before Philological Association. 
### 
The Philological Association met
yesterday at 2:30 in room 31. The
feature of the meeting was a paper
by Dr. Ewald Fliigel outlining the
work of compiling the Chaucerian
dictionary. Dr. Fliigel began by
reviewing briefly the history of the
dictionary before it came into his
hands. The plan originated in Eng
land more than thirty years ago, it
being the ambition of Dr. Furnivall,
the enthusiastic founder of the
Chaucer Society, to supplement the
text and other works of the society
with the complete glossorial con
cordance of all the works of Chau
cer. With the help of other mem
bers of the society a preliminary
plan of work was drawn up, and
the writing of the slips with indi
vidual words commenced. For a
long time it was expected that
Hiram Carson, the venerable pro
fessor of English at Cornell, would
edit the material thus collected, but
his other duties prevented him.
While the collecting of materia)
went on no editor was appointed
until about fifteen years ago, when
Dr. Fliigel, then in Germany, was
intrusted with the responsible task.
The slips, so far ae written, were
turned over to him, and were
brought to this country when he
accepted the position of English
Philology at Stanford. These slips
comprised only the important
words; it became necessary to write
additional slips to supplement those
already written. Since coming to
Stanford Dr. Fliigel, in the time he
could spare from his university
work, and with the help of graduate
students and others, has been con
tinually enlarging their collection
of slips. The work was found to
be of great magnitude, and the
Carnegie Institute came forward
with an offer of assistance which
would enable him to bring the un
dertaking to an end.
Dr. Fliigel next reviewed the
work that has been accomplished
during the year by himself and
staff, and by the two assistants and
two copyists granted him by the
Carnegie Institute. He explained
the methods he is using in prepar
ing the material for the dictionary.
The slips that have been written
for the individual words in Chau
cer are being carefully collated with
the original texts as printed by the
Chaucer Society, and all variances
are noted. This has already been
done for the greater part of "The
Canterbury Tales," and for much
of the other prose and verse of
Chaucer. The work that remains,
however, will keep the assistants
busy for several months to come.
Meanwhile the copyists have been
engaged in completing and arrang
ing Dr. Fliigel's collection of slips
representing the words of Chaucer's
contemporaries. Dr. Fliigel has
gleaned his most important infor
mation from the works of Garver
and Lydgate, as well as from all
the texts of the Early English Text
Society, and many of the Rolls
series.
In the completed dictionary the
article for each word will show the
spelling and form of the word as it
occurs in the Chaucer manuscript,'
its etymology, its use by Chaucer's!
{contemporaries, and its variouSj
meanings in Chaucer. Special at
tention will be paid to the latter,
[feature, and as all the references

will be given in concordance form,!
it will be possible to arrange the
material in such a way as to show
ithe usual and the special mean
ings of the word in Chaucer.
As the Chaucer slips show all the
variant readings of the manu
scripts, it is Dr. Fliigel's intention
to take advantage of the material
thus collected and prepare a criti
cal edition of the works of Chaucer.
This will be one of the most im
portant results of the work now
being done on the Lexicon. Yes
terday Dr. Fliigel confined himself
to a review of the Lexicon and a
report on the present state of the
work, saying little or nothing about
his plans for its completion. It is
understood, however, that during
the coming year he will make a
[trip to England to examine unpub
lished manuscripts of Chaucer. It
is likely that the completion of the
work will demand the full three
syears originally estimated by DrJ
iFlugel, and perhaps longer.
The other feature of the meeting;
• was the reading of a paper by Pro
cessor C. Searles on Boiardo, the
'first of the noble Contastorie.

Carnegie Institute came forward
with an offer of assistance which
would enable him to bring the un
dertaking to an end.
Dr. Fliigel next reviewed the
work that has been accomplished
during the year by himself and
staff, and by the two assistants and
two copyists granted him by the
Carnegie Institute. He explained
the methods he is using in prepar
ing the material for the dictionary.
The slips that have been written
for the individual words in Chau
cer are being carefully collated with
the original texts as printed by the
Chaucer Society, and all variances
are noted. This has already been
done for the greater part of "The
Canterbury Tales," and for much
of the other prose and verse of
Chaucer. The work that remains,
however, will keep the assistants
busy for several months to come.
Meanwhile the copyists have been
engaged in completing and arrang
ing Dr. Fliigel's collection of slips
representing the words of Chaucer's
contemporaries. Dr. Fliigel has
gleaned his most important infor
mation from the works of Garver
and Lydgate, as well as from all
the texts of the Early English Text
Society, and many of the Rolls
series.
In the completed dictionary the
article for each word will show the
spelling and form of the word as it
occurs in the Chaucer manuscript,'
its etymology, its use by Chaucer's!
{contemporaries, and its variouSj
meanings in Chaucer. Special at
tention will be paid to the latter,
[feature, and as all the references

will be given in concordance form,!
it will be possible to arrange the
material in such a way as to show
ithe usual and the special mean
ings of the word in Chaucer.
As the Chaucer slips show all the
variant readings of the manu
scripts, it is Dr. Fliigel's intention
to take advantage of the material
thus collected and prepare a criti
cal edition of the works of Chaucer.
This will be one of the most im
portant results of the work now
being done on the Lexicon. Yes
terday Dr. Fliigel confined himself
to a review of the Lexicon and a
report on the present state of the
work, saying little or nothing about
his plans for its completion. It is
understood, however, that during
the coming year he will make a
[trip to England to examine unpub
lished manuscripts of Chaucer. It
is likely that the completion of the
work will demand the full three
syears originally estimated by DrJ
iFlugel, and perhaps longer.
The other feature of the meeting;
• was the reading of a paper by Pro
cessor C. Searles on Boiardo, the
'first of the noble Contastorie.
