# FACULTY PAYS TRIBUTE.
## Resolutions in Memory of Mrs. Stanford Adopted by Academic Council. 
### 
The Academic Council of the
University to-day adopted the fol
fowing resolutions in memory of
Mrs. Stanford:
"Whereas, By the dispensation
of Providence, death has brought to
a close the earthly career of Jane
Lathrop Stanford; and
"Whereas, We recognize that in
her death the world has lost one of
its rarest women, one who laid soj
well the foundations of simple and
noble womanhood that no vicissi
tude of life could shake them; :
who, when put to the severest test
of motherhood, proved her unself
ishness by adding voluntary to in
voluntary sacrifice, and when put
to the crucial test of wifehood
added the devotion of single-handed
labor to that of long companion
ship and love; who took, unshrink
ing, a trust that none but strong
hands might assume, and by her
strength, loyalty, and wisdom,
linked her name indissolubly with
one of the great benefactions of his
tory â€”a friend of learning and a
friend of man; who, in all she did,
was 'wise, steadfast, prudent, pa
tient, just,' and of whom it is said
that 'every good word we can use
is hers by right'; and
"Whereas, In her death we have
seen depart the last of the house
hold out of whose lives and ideals
has grown this institution, their
'lengthened shadow,' and the cause
and bond of our own particular
labors and fellowship; be it there
fore
"Resolved, That we, the faculty
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, in council assembled, recog
nizing that the frailty of na
ture puts a bound to even the

most beneficent lives, give voice to
our deep sorrow for this great per-j
sonal loss, and our abiding grati
tude that the world has had be
queathed to it so inspiring a
memory."
