# Plans for Boat-house.
## 
### 
Work on the boat-house at Red
wood City will be commenced next
week. The building will be erected
on piles near the deep-water wharf,
about half a mile from the South
ern Pacific depot. The boat-house
will not be a permanent structure,
and therefore will be erected of
[rough lumber. The building will
be 15 feet wide and 45 feet long,
and will be sufficiently large to ac
commodate six four-oared shells.
A float,and an apron connecting the
;houee and float, will be built, so
that the rise and fall of the tide
will not interfere with the hand
ling of the boats. The structure
'will be erected by students and
Jshould be completed in about two
weeks. It is estimated that the
,cost will be about $170.
