# BODY WILL REST IN MAUSOLEUM
## Structure Erected at Heavy Cost by Senator Stanford Just Before Death. 
### 
THE remains of Mrs. Stanford
will be placed in the mauso
leum, where those of her husband
and son now rest in their marble
receptacles. This great resting
place of the Stanford family was
built by Senator and Mrs. Stanford
in 1893 at a cost of $164,000, and is
considered to be the most magnifi
cent sepulchral monument on the
Pacific Coast. It stands at the end
of a straight cypress road turning
off the avenue connecting the Uni
versity and Palo Alto, about half
a mile from the buildings of the
quadrangle.
Designed in the purest type of
Grecian architecture, the mauso
leum is a small Greek temple in
form, constructed of white marble
and polished granite of a darker
color. lonic pillars, set close to
the walls, ornament the front, rear,
and sides, while four sphinxes in
white marble crouch on bases
at each corner of the tomb. Over
the heavy bronze door which closes
the front of the mausoleum is n
tablet on which are carved in raised
letters the names of the three mem
bers of the family.
Through the upper panels of the
door, which are interlaced with
bronze filigree work, a view of the
interior can be obtained. Here are
three great marble sarcophagi.
The right-hand one contains the
remains of the son and bears the
simple inscription: "Leland Stan
ford Junior —Born to Mortality
May 14, 1868 —Passed to Immor
tality March 13, 1884." On the
left is the tomb of Senator Stan
ford, bearing an inscription similar
to that of his son. It is in the

central sarcophagus that the body
of Mrs. Stanford will be placed.
For some years after the death
of Leland Stanford Jr. his body
was kept in a marble tomb just
east of the Stanford residence.
With the idea of providing a more
suitable resting-place and one that
should contain the three members
of the family, the great mausoleum
was constructed. But before the
body of the son could be moved
and while the last touches were
being placed on the new tomb, the
sudden death of Senator Stanford
came. After the simple funeral
services, the remains of the late
Senator were placed in the mauso
leum. Shortly after this the body
of the son was placed beside that of
the father.
In the original charter of the
University, ten acres adjoining the
residence grounds were set apart
"as a place of burial and of last
rest on earth for the bodies of the
grantors and of their son, Leland
Stanford Junior, and, as the board
may direct, for the bodies of per
sons connected with the Univer
sity." But later Mrs. Stanford had
this clause struck out and substi
tuted one which named the present
mausoleum and the surrounding
ground as a place of last rest for
the Stanford family and abandoned
the idea of holding ten acres as a
burial-place for prominent mem
bers of the University.
On the heavy marble slab that
is to cover the tomb of Mrs. Stan
ford will be engraved —
JANE LATHHOP STANFORD
Born to Mortality Aupust 25, 1828.
Passed to Immortality February 28,1905.
