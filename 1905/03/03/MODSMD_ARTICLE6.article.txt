The sudden death of Mrs. Stan
ford at a time when, in spite of her
age, she still apparently had years
ot vigor and usefulness before her,
has profoundly shocked the com
munity in which she had lived and
moved for so many years,and which
had not yet begun to consider the
possibility of her loss. Left by the
death of her husband to complete
the great work begun by him, she
met the unlooked-for troubles which
arose with a resolution, self-sacrifice
and ability which commanded the
admiration of the entire country;
and when success finally crowned
her efforts, she administered the
great trust until it had assumed
the precise form contemplated by
herself and her husband, with such
slight modifications as seemed beßt
to her maturer judgment. Having
done all this, she surrendered the
care and direction to those ap
pointed to take up the burden, and
had a right to expect many years
of serene contemplation of the in
creasing usefulness of the great
institution which will forever stand
as a memorial to her husband, her
self and her young son. It was
otherwise ordered, and she has
passed to her rest.
The circumstances attending her
death are peculiarly mysterious and
distressing, and yet it is almost un
thinkable that such a woman as
Mrs. Stanford could have had an
enemy with so black a heart as to
have deliberately poisoned a bene
factress of mankind. What motive
could there have been? How could
opportunity have been found?
What known enemy existed? It is
impossible to answer any of these
questions in a way to make deliber
ate murder seem possible. Doubt
less the circumstances demand the
most searching inquiry, and doubt
less that inquiry is being made.

'Until we get the result of the official
investigations the public will corn
fort itself with the belief that the
lamented death was due to natural
causes, or at worst to some terrible
mistake. It does not eeem possible
that the earth contains a wretch so
abandoned and so ruthless as to
put so good a woman to a death so
horrible. —San Francisco Chronicle.
