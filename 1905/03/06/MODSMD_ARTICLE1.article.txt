# Pays high Tribute from the Pulpit to the Memory of Jane Lathrop Stanford
## Rev. Dr. J.W. Dinsmore of San Jose Preaches in Memorial Church. 
### 
SERVICES in memory of Mrs. l
Jane Lathrop Stanford were]
held in the Memorial Church yes-j
terday. A large crowd of students,
and faculty members listened to
an impressive sermon delivered by|
Rev. Dr. John \V. Dinsmore,
of the First Presbyterian Church ofj
San Jose. The audience, probably
the largest which has entered the
beautiful edifice since the day of
its dedication, was much moved by
the simple tribute paid to the re
vered benefactor of the University
by the eloquent preacher.
The warm sun of a spring morn
ing could not dissipate the solemn
sadness which pervaded the church
erected to the memory of the first
founder, and the large audience
gathered and dispersed very quiet
ly. The music, especially selected
for the occasion, was rendered by
Dr. Blodgett at the organ, with
the assistance of the student choir.
In the afternoon Dr. Blodgett gave
an organ recital. The masterpieces
played by the organist, appropriate
to the occasion, were listened to by
an audience almost equal to the
one which attended the morning
services.
Dr. Dinsmore's sermon in full
follows:
The sermon I had purposed to
give here and now has been laid
aside. The dreadful shock which
has come to this University, and
to the public at large during the
past week, makes all discourse in
this place at this hour, on any sub
ject but one, alien and impertinent.
One subject, and that to the ex
clusion of all else, engages your
minds and hearts, your thoughts
and feelings, here and now. It has
the monopoly of your interest and
sympathy. Any attempt to divert
this stream of thought and feeling
into another channel would be a
failure, as it ought to be.
I felt some embarrassment in
standing here at this time, but the
very kind invitation and encour
agement of Dr. Jordan reassured
me. It was not my good fortune
to have the least close personal ac
quaintance with Mrs. Stanford. 1
had sometimes thought of seeking
such acquaintance, but I never did,I
and so never had it. Hence I am
not able to give that discriminating
analysis of her character and pri
vate life which can be given by
those only who knew her in the in
timacy of close personal friendship.
There are many such, and doubt
less, indue time, their voices will:
be heard. But in a larger sense
Mrs. Stanford's life and char-j
acter were known and read of all
men.

j Perhaps there was no other per
-18011 in California who was known
.so familiarly to so many people as
was Mrs. Stanford. By her deeds
she was known far and wide; known
in the mansions of the rich and in
the cottages of the poor. And this
despite the fact that there was in
her character, her habits, her do
ings, no slightest trace of vulgar
ostentation, obtrusiveness, or man
nishness, if you will allow that
rather doubtful but very express
ive word. I knew her simply as
she was known to the public, and
what 1 say here is in some sort the
voice of the public, the judgment of
the people at large upon her life
and character. She was first of all
a true woman, well born and well
bred; with a rich, strong and reso
lute personality; deep and whole
some sympathies with whatever
was pure and good; warm affec
tions, perhaps also warm antipa
thies; high ideals, fixed principles,
unfaltering perseverance; unflinch
ing loyalty, too, to whatever per
son or thing she had set her heart
upon. She was a noble wife, blend
ing her life with that of her hus
band; able to appreciate and enter
into his great schemes and vast en
terprises; a most devoted mother,
giving tiie wealth of her deep and
powerful nature to her only child
while he lived, and cherishing with
unspeakable tenderness his mem
ory after he had been taken from
her; for years a childless widow,
nourishing her soul on the mem
ories and fellowships of the past,
and making it the central object of
her life to carry out the wishes of
the departed, and to prepare to re
join them hereafter—this, as I con
ceive it, is the true account of her
character and life.
Probably her tenderest thoughts
and her holiest memories clustered
round the mausoleum over yonder
in the campus, and lingered amid
the familiar grounds and rooms of
her country home here where we
now sit. Here she had communion
with the departed; here she gat un
der the brooding presence of the
shades of the beloved dead. But
her life was not wasted in mem
ories and reveries. Her absorbing
ambitions, her masterful aspira
tions, had their soul and center in
this great University. There can
be no doubt that during the years
of her childlessness and widow
hood, the absorbing interest of her
life, the central and controlling
ambition of her very soul was to
carry out the great plans formed
by her departed husband and her
self in other days concerning this
University. This had the in on op

oly of her thoughts by day and of
her dreams by night.
To this object her vast fortune
was devoted without reluctance
and without reserve To carry out
this purpose she gave this vast
landed estate, one of the most mag
nificent in the world; she planned
and paid for the great assemblage
of buildings, and arches, and mon
uments which adorn this campus,
probably, all things considered, the
finest group of academic buildings
in the world; for this she traveled,
wrought and sacrificed; while other
rich people were building palaces,
founding libraries, establishing
great corporations for their own
glory and without much regard to
the welfare of the country, she
cherished this University for the
education of the common people;
for this she rummaged the libraries,
the galleries and the museums of
the old world, the tombs of the
Pharaohs, and the curiosity shops
of China and Japan; she searched
the world, that she might bring
treasures rich and rare to this
sacred shrine. Undoubtedly this
one purpose was central and con
trolling. Nothing else had much
interest to her. This engaged her
thoughts, kindled her affections,
filled her horizon, dominated her
life, drank up the energies and en
thusiasms of her soul. And this
was no common, coarse, selfish am
bition either. The purpose was
not merely to build a great, dead
monument, a magnificent mauso
leum of lifeless marble, which
might stand in some cemetery or
park for all time, as a shining
memorial of departed wealth.

Something like this is not uncom
mon in the world. Many very
rich men and women have died and
left colossal statues, or other me
morials in cemeteries, parks and
city squares. These may celebrate
the achievements of the dead, but
they are as dead as are the men or
women whose names are carved
upon them. But not such were
the purpose and plan of Senator
and Mrs. Stanford. Their purpose
was not to erect a dead monument,
however colossal and splendid, in
some park or cemetery, or city
square, but to open a living foun
tain, whose waters should flow out
to refresh the present and the fu
ture generations of mankind, to
gladden and bless the world ages
after the founders had turned to
dust and their souls had gone to
God. Every one of the many hun
dreds of youth now gathered here,
and the many other hundreds and
thousands yet to be gathered, is a
pensioner of the bounty and
benevolence of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. Shame on them if they
ever forget it.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford felt
the responsibility under which they
live to whom Almighty Providence
lias entrusted large wealth. They
knew the day would surely come
when the steward must give ac
count to his Master, and it behooves
[him so to use his money, that he
[can give his account with joy, and
jnot with grief. They understood
Ithat they lived under the great
■ Master's eye, and that every man,
Erich or poor, should give strict ac
count of the trust committed to
