# Pays high Tribute from the Pulpit to the Memory of Jane Lathrop Stanford
## Rev. Dr. J.W. Dinsmore of San Jose Preaches in Memorial Church. 
### 
SERVICES in memory of Mrs. l
Jane Lathrop Stanford were]
held in the Memorial Church yes-j
terday. A large crowd of students,
and faculty members listened to
an impressive sermon delivered by|
Rev. Dr. John \V. Dinsmore,
of the First Presbyterian Church ofj
San Jose. The audience, probably
the largest which has entered the
beautiful edifice since the day of
its dedication, was much moved by
the simple tribute paid to the re
vered benefactor of the University
by the eloquent preacher.
The warm sun of a spring morn
ing could not dissipate the solemn
sadness which pervaded the church
erected to the memory of the first
founder, and the large audience
gathered and dispersed very quiet
ly. The music, especially selected
for the occasion, was rendered by
Dr. Blodgett at the organ, with
the assistance of the student choir.
In the afternoon Dr. Blodgett gave
an organ recital. The masterpieces
played by the organist, appropriate
to the occasion, were listened to by
an audience almost equal to the
one which attended the morning
services.
Dr. Dinsmore's sermon in full
follows:
The sermon I had purposed to
give here and now has been laid
aside. The dreadful shock which
has come to this University, and
to the public at large during the
past week, makes all discourse in
this place at this hour, on any sub
ject but one, alien and impertinent.
One subject, and that to the ex
clusion of all else, engages your
minds and hearts, your thoughts
and feelings, here and now. It has
the monopoly of your interest and
sympathy. Any attempt to divert
this stream of thought and feeling
into another channel would be a
failure, as it ought to be.
I felt some embarrassment in
standing here at this time, but the
very kind invitation and encour
agement of Dr. Jordan reassured
me. It was not my good fortune
to have the least close personal ac
quaintance with Mrs. Stanford. 1
had sometimes thought of seeking
such acquaintance, but I never did,I
and so never had it. Hence I am
not able to give that discriminating
analysis of her character and pri
vate life which can be given by
those only who knew her in the in
timacy of close personal friendship.
There are many such, and doubt
less, indue time, their voices will:
be heard. But in a larger sense
Mrs. Stanford's life and char-j
acter were known and read of all
men.

j Perhaps there was no other per
-18011 in California who was known
.so familiarly to so many people as
was Mrs. Stanford. By her deeds
she was known far and wide; known
in the mansions of the rich and in
the cottages of the poor. And this
despite the fact that there was in
her character, her habits, her do
ings, no slightest trace of vulgar
ostentation, obtrusiveness, or man
nishness, if you will allow that
rather doubtful but very express
ive word. I knew her simply as
she was known to the public, and
what 1 say here is in some sort the
voice of the public, the judgment of
the people at large upon her life
and character. She was first of all
a true woman, well born and well
bred; with a rich, strong and reso
lute personality; deep and whole
some sympathies with whatever
was pure and good; warm affec
tions, perhaps also warm antipa
thies; high ideals, fixed principles,
unfaltering perseverance; unflinch
ing loyalty, too, to whatever per
son or thing she had set her heart
upon. She was a noble wife, blend
ing her life with that of her hus
band; able to appreciate and enter
into his great schemes and vast en
terprises; a most devoted mother,
giving tiie wealth of her deep and
powerful nature to her only child
while he lived, and cherishing with
unspeakable tenderness his mem
ory after he had been taken from
her; for years a childless widow,
nourishing her soul on the mem
ories and fellowships of the past,
and making it the central object of
her life to carry out the wishes of
the departed, and to prepare to re
join them hereafter—this, as I con
ceive it, is the true account of her
character and life.
Probably her tenderest thoughts
and her holiest memories clustered
round the mausoleum over yonder
in the campus, and lingered amid
the familiar grounds and rooms of
her country home here where we
now sit. Here she had communion
with the departed; here she gat un
der the brooding presence of the
shades of the beloved dead. But
her life was not wasted in mem
ories and reveries. Her absorbing
ambitions, her masterful aspira
tions, had their soul and center in
this great University. There can
be no doubt that during the years
of her childlessness and widow
hood, the absorbing interest of her
life, the central and controlling
ambition of her very soul was to
carry out the great plans formed
by her departed husband and her
self in other days concerning this
University. This had the in on op

oly of her thoughts by day and of
her dreams by night.
To this object her vast fortune
was devoted without reluctance
and without reserve To carry out
this purpose she gave this vast
landed estate, one of the most mag
nificent in the world; she planned
and paid for the great assemblage
of buildings, and arches, and mon
uments which adorn this campus,
probably, all things considered, the
finest group of academic buildings
in the world; for this she traveled,
wrought and sacrificed; while other
rich people were building palaces,
founding libraries, establishing
great corporations for their own
glory and without much regard to
the welfare of the country, she
cherished this University for the
education of the common people;
for this she rummaged the libraries,
the galleries and the museums of
the old world, the tombs of the
Pharaohs, and the curiosity shops
of China and Japan; she searched
the world, that she might bring
treasures rich and rare to this
sacred shrine. Undoubtedly this
one purpose was central and con
trolling. Nothing else had much
interest to her. This engaged her
thoughts, kindled her affections,
filled her horizon, dominated her
life, drank up the energies and en
thusiasms of her soul. And this
was no common, coarse, selfish am
bition either. The purpose was
not merely to build a great, dead
monument, a magnificent mauso
leum of lifeless marble, which
might stand in some cemetery or
park for all time, as a shining
memorial of departed wealth.

Something like this is not uncom
mon in the world. Many very
rich men and women have died and
left colossal statues, or other me
morials in cemeteries, parks and
city squares. These may celebrate
the achievements of the dead, but
they are as dead as are the men or
women whose names are carved
upon them. But not such were
the purpose and plan of Senator
and Mrs. Stanford. Their purpose
was not to erect a dead monument,
however colossal and splendid, in
some park or cemetery, or city
square, but to open a living foun
tain, whose waters should flow out
to refresh the present and the fu
ture generations of mankind, to
gladden and bless the world ages
after the founders had turned to
dust and their souls had gone to
God. Every one of the many hun
dreds of youth now gathered here,
and the many other hundreds and
thousands yet to be gathered, is a
pensioner of the bounty and
benevolence of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. Shame on them if they
ever forget it.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford felt
the responsibility under which they
live to whom Almighty Providence
lias entrusted large wealth. They
knew the day would surely come
when the steward must give ac
count to his Master, and it behooves
[him so to use his money, that he
[can give his account with joy, and
jnot with grief. They understood
Ithat they lived under the great
■ Master's eye, and that every man,
Erich or poor, should give strict ac
count of the trust committed to


Interior of the Memorial Chukch
him. Hence they lived and walked |
under the deep sense of their strict
responsibility to God and their fel
low men.
It is easy for those of us who are l
not entrusted with large wealth to
determine what rich people should
do. It is not bo easy for them.
For one thing, it is not palaces,
monuments, shrines; not material
structures, however costly and
splendid, that give truest witness
to human worth, and that are the
most striking memorials of worldly
success. The Pharaohs are dead
and buried under the rubbish of
past ages, while Moees, the child of
a slave-woman, lives and does busi
ness in every street, every school,
every home of the civilized world.
Who cares for Tiberius Caesar, the
mighty emperor of our Lord's time?i
And who does not care for Jesus!
Christ, whom he slew? It is notl
marble monuments, nor splendidj
palaces that best perpetuate the
memory of the departed. It isj
fructifying ideas, life-giving influ
ences, beneficent institutions, that!
keep on doing their blessed work!
long after the heart from which]
they sprung has ceased to heat.j
These are the true memorials ofjj
human greatness, the lasting wit-J
nesses of human worth. The shades
of Senator and Mrs. Stanford, hov
ering round this magnificent group|
of academic buildings, erected for
the common people, might say
with Sir Christopher Wren, theS
architect of St. Paul's in London:
"Si monumentum requiris, circum
spice." The responsibility of peo
ple of large wealth in this country
is very strict and strenuous. I
mean responsibility to the great
God in heaven not only, but to the!
law, and to public opinion. No!
man under the conditions of mod-l
em life, who accumulates one, five,l
twenty, or more millions, can hope!
to escape the strict scrutiny of the!
people, or the stern inquest of thej
public conscience, now and hereaf
ter. There is in this land a deep
seated, a growing, and an angry
jealousy of great fortunes, of mas
sive wealth. The multi-million
airo is looked upon by multitudes
of the struggling people of the
country as a sort of highway rob
ber and plunderer of the poor.
Tens of thousands, hundreds of!
thousands of American men at this!
very moment regard the multi-l
millionaire as a public enemy; as!
one whose fortune is the product of!
plunder; whose pride and power,!
whose show and splendor, whose!
luxury and whose vices are the re-l
suit of the shifty and scoundrelly!
manipulations of the earnings ofj
humbler and more honest men;!
whose pride and power, whose!
pomp and insolence, whose self-g
indulgence and luxury, are at!
the cost of the common people;!
whose control of the industries and!
the commerce of this land must!
soon cease; who must ere long be!
thrown down and trampled upon!
by the great mass of the American!
people whom he has wronged andl
robbed. This, no doubt, is the creed!
and the passion of multitudes of!
the men who now live in this land.!
For one, I believe that this is the!
certain and inevitable doom of the!
heartless and conscienceless mil-!
lionaires of this land. As an!
American of six generations, a son!
of the Colonial and the Revolution-!
ary wars, as one whose family has!
been concerned in modest ways fori

||nearly two hundred years in build
ing up this great republic, I am
free to say that I cannot but sym
pathize with this jealousy of enor
mous wealth and the power it
brings to corrupt the weak, bully
the timid, and oppress the helpless
and the poor, when it is unjustly
got and wickedly used. But no
true American has any jealousy of
rich people, simply as rich. It is
the vulgar, domineering, despotic
rich that he hates, and will infal
libly humble and destroy. Men who
got their riches by honest means,
and in the management of great
Ipublic enterprises, if they use them
ifor the public good, if, instead of
using their power for the oppres
sion of the poor and the plundering
[of the public, they use their wealth
ifor great public and beneficent
ipurposes, we applaud their conduct
|and approve their character. In
■such ways and for such purposes
■this great fortune has been used,
ilf other people of great fortune
iwould but emulate the example of
ithe Stanfords, much of the bitter
[jealousy and fierce hatred of the
Every rich which burns in the hearts
multitudes of the poor would die
gout and be turned to gratitude and
Blove.
S Here is founded one of the most
[fully equipped educational institu
tions on the earth; where the child
lof the humblest home may have
Ethe greatest advantages at the least
[cost; where young people of the
[commonwealth and the country
Pmay secure the maximum of train-
King at the minimum of expense;
twhere the moral influences are in

-the highest degree wholesome and
dominant; where many hundreds
of the youth of the commonwealth
and the country are already gath
ered, and many other hundreds
[are to be gathered in the future;
this is the living memorial of Sen
'ator and Mrs. Stanford. In such
[ways and for such purposes, this
great fortune has been used. It is
hard to believe that there is one
man in this whole land who hated
Mrs. Stanford, unless a maniac or
an utter degenerate. How could
he? She was a very rich woman,
indeed, and lived in accordance
with her condition. But no man
of the least character or conscience
could find it in his heart to look
upon her with mean jealousy, still
less with fiendish hatred. Why
should he? What had she ever
done for the oppression of the poor
or for the hurt of mankind? What,
but for the help and comfort of the
human race? What was there in
her life that revealed arrogance,
meanness, cruelty? What that did
not reveal kindness, generosity,
benevolence? What fiend from
the pit would want to murder her?i
Or put her in distress? The very
devil of the Puritans, it seems to
me, would have scorned such an
office. But this mystery time alone
will disclose, if it ever is disclosed.
Here is a great University. As
I understand it, it is dedicated to
the higher learning and the malc-j
ing of character. The founders of,
it believed in the fatherhood of:
God and the brotherhood of man.!
They believed that there is one liv
ing God, above all, in all, through
all; the Creator, Preserver and
Governor of all things, from least
to greatest; from the sweep of
a world to the fall of a sparrow;
that there is one human race, and
that every individual of that race
has in him an immortal soul, a
deathless spirit, which is destined
to live forever and forever; and to
develop, discipline and train that
soul for usefulness and for glory is
the great central purpose of this
University. To this proposition is
it dedicated, to this great high pur
pose is it founded and endowed.
Well, let it stand for these primary
convictions of the human mind
and heart. No less, for these funda
mental teachings of the Word of God.
Mrs. Stanford was a good woman;
that is the best thing that can be
said of any one. Dr. Charlesl
Hodge, probably the greatest theo
logian of the nineteenth century, a
man whose writings are in every
complete library in Europe and
America, when more than eighty
years old, and as the very last pa
per ever published from his prolific
pen, wrote a little pamphlet con
cerning a poor woman whom hep
knew, and he began it as follows: |
"I wish to write this little sketch of I
a poor woman of my acquaintance!
to show the greatness of simple h
goodness." Ah, there is no great-j
ness so great as simj)le goodness.!
Some years ago, when good Queens
Victoria died, I was invited by al
large British-American society to!
give an address in a memorial ser-l
vice. I remember that the main!
points spoken of were that this de-1
parted majesty was far greater as ag
woman, a wife, a mother, and al
widow, than as a queen. Mrs.!
Stanford was a queen, not a titular!
queen, of course, but a queenly!
woman, wife, mother, widow; one!
who won her distinction not mere-!
ly by her fortune, but by her good-K
ness. She must have had morel
than common natural ability andfi
intelligence. Her husband wa-w
concerned in very large projects,!
and which he carried out, to the!
great development of this entire!
country. It is certain that in all!
this she was bis genuine helpmeet;K
not a little, fretful, nagging, drag-!
ging-down creature, but a woman!

I who rose to the level of her hus
band's large projects and achieve
ments. When he was takep out ofj
the world, she was able fully and
intelligently to enter into the largej
schemes they had together formed
for the future.
I Many an hour, no doubt, they
jhad spent in close converse con-
Ecerning this great University. They
Shad a most explicit and thorough:
between themselves
(concerning the foundations and fu-
Iture fortunes of this great Univer
sity. She fully understood and most
■thoroughly sympathized with the
jideas of her husband in this regard.
SThese ideas she has most faithfully
land earnestly tried to realize dur
ging her remaining life. No doubt
■he and she have made it certain
gthat their conception of the func
gtions and the mission of this great
■University shall be realized in the
■near and the far future. So far as
Jan ything in this world can be se-
Icured, they have secured the future
lof this institution. They have
Bused every possible safeguard to
Ikeep it to the purpose of its origi
jnal foundation. This is their mon
ument and memorial. They are
jdead; their son is dead; the entire
(family have faded out of this world.
Nothing visible is left of them but
jtheir tomb, their memory, and the
[material structures they erected.
jEre long all their friends, all who
■knew and loved them in their life-
Itime, will have passed away from
Ithe earth. The wealth they pos
sessed, the houses they lived in, will
isoon have passed to other hands.
■But the institution they founded
and the fountain they opened will
not pass away. Here is their en
during monument and memorial.
More enduring than marble or
brass, more lasting than kindred
or friends, this shall long endure
as a great fountain of influence, a
great center of. learning, a place of
resort for the youth of the land
and the world, and where thousands
yet unborn shall receive the im
pulse and the training which shall
help them to fight life's battles and
win its victories in the days to
come. I know of nothing quite like
it in this country or the world. So
unique in its conception, so defi
nite in its purpoee, so ample in its
foundation, so complete in its
equipment, so splendid in its pres
ent and so magnificent in its future
as is this Leland Stanford Junior
University. In the days to come,
and far away, when this magnifi
cent valley and these mountain
slopes shall swarm with a multi
tudinous population; when lovely
cities, towns, homes shall cover this
entire landscape; when conditions
now unknown, and institutions and
enterprises now undreamed of, and
which if we could foresee them
would excite our wonder and
amazement, even as if what we now
knowcould have been foreseen byour
forefathers would have filled them
with the like wonder and amaze
ment, then, in that far future, hun
dreds of young Americans shall
swarm through these massive struc
tures, shall read in these libraries,
study in these class-rooms, wor
ship in this church, and go forth
to help mankind, the product of
the far-seeing beneficence of Sena
tor and Mrs. Stanford, whose bodies
with that of their son shall rest in
peace and honor in yonder mauso
leum, while their souls we trust
have gone to be forever with that
God whom they honored and
served.
