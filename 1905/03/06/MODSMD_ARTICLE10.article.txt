by me at any time made.
XXVII
I wish thus publicly to acknow
ledge my great gratitude to an all
wise, loving Heavenly Father for
His sustaining grace through the
past ten years of bereavement,

Comforter and found rest and

life beyond this: a fair land where
no more tears will be shed and no
more partings had.

ment, I have on this 28th day of
July, A. D. 1903, in the city and

XXV
Of the large estate committed to

the wisest and most just disposition,

ance with the cherished wishes long
entertained by my husband and
myself, and I shall greatly deplore
any attempt to disturb it; and if
any devisee or legatee under the
above-written will, or any person
who, if I died intestate, would be
entitled to any part of my estate,
should either directly or indirectly
attempt to oppose or set aside the
probate of this will, or to impair,
invalidate or set aside its provi
sions, or to set aside or avoid, or to
have declared void, null or ineffect
ual any transfer or grant made oi
attempted to be made by my hus
band or myself to said trustees of
said university,then and in thatcase
I give and bequeath to such person
or persons the sum of one hundred
($100) dollars, and no more, in
lieu of any other share or interest
under the will or in my estate; and
I expressly declare and provide
that to take any part directly or
indirectl) in such an attempt
shall be held and conclusively
deemed to be an election by the
person or persons doing so to take
the said one hundred ($100) dol
lars, and no more, in lieu of all in
terest in my estate, and all the
rest of the interest that would
otherwise have gone to such person
or persons by devise or inheritance
shall pass under the residuary
clause of the said will.
XXVI
I hereby revoke all former wills
by me at any time made.
XXVII
I wish thus publicly to acknow
ledge my great gratitude to an all
wise, loving Heavenly Father for
His sustaining grace through the
past ten years of bereavement,
trial and disappointments. In all
I have leaned hard on this Great
Comforter and found rest and
peace. I haveno doubt about a future
life beyond this: a fair land where
no more tears will be shed and no
more partings had.
To this, my last will and testa-]
ment, I have on this 28th day of
July, A. D. 1903, in the city and

lars, and no more, in lieu of all in
terest in my estate, and all the

wise, loving Heavenly Father for
His sustaining grace through the

peace. I haveno doubt about a future
life beyond this: a fair land where
no more tears will be shed and no
more partings had.

ment, I have on this 28th day of
July, A. D. 1903, in the city and

ing the past ten years, and devoted
to all the interests left me by my

in the board of directors of the
Pacific Improvement Company as
long as my estate retains any in
terest therein.
I hereby request that the board
of trustees of the university shall
retain my brother, Charles G.
Lathrop, as treasurer of and busi
ness manager for the board of trus
tees, he to receive annually the
salary of twelve thousand ($12,000)
dollars each year, and I trust for
my sake my dear brother will be
willing to retain the position and
accept the compensation named.
Will Must Be Respected.
XXV
Of the large estate committed to
the hands of my husband and my
self I have made what I consider
the wisest and most just disposition,
and the disposition most in accord
ance with the cherished wishes long
entertained by my husband and
myself, and I shall greatly deplore
any attempt to disturb it; and if
any devisee or legatee under the
above-written will, or any person
who, if I died intestate, would be
entitled to any part of my estate,
should either directly or indirectly
attempt to oppose or set aside the
probate of this will, or to impair,
invalidate or set aside its provi
sions, or to set aside or avoid, or to
have declared void, null or ineffect
ual any transfer or grant made oi
attempted to be made by my hus
band or myself to said trustees of
said university,then and in thatcase
I give and bequeath to such person
or persons the sum of one hundred
($100) dollars, and no more, in
lieu of any other share or interest
under the will or in my estate; and
I expressly declare and provide
that to take any part directly or

shall be held and conclusively
deemed to be an election by the
person or persons doing so to take
the said one hundred ($100) dol
lars, and no more, in lieu of all in
terest in my estate, and all the
rest of the interest that would
otherwise have gone to such person
or persons by devise or inheritance

by me at any time made.
