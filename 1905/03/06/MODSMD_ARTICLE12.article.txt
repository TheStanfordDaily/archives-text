Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is the sentiment of a large
number of the students that we
ought to do something more than
offer resolutions to show our sor
row at the death of Mrs. Stanford.
However heartfelt these may be,
there should be something to show
that we, as students of Stanford
University, feel the loss to be a
personal one requiring some sym
bol of mourning such as iB custom
ary in like circumstances. To sus
pend all social functions and gen
eral student activities planned for
this month is proper and fitting,
but inadequate. It is suggested
that the men wear black ties and
the women black ribbons for the
rest of the eemester. Some general
token of mourning of that nature
would express as well as anything
could the grief of the whole student
body. If the Executive Committee
of the student body approved of
this idea, they might take steps
toward carrying it out.
