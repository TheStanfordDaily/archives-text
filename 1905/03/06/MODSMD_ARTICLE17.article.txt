# CONDITION OF MR. GARDNER.
## Slight Improvement in the State of the Memorial Church Chaplain. 
### 
The condition of the Rev. D.
Charles Gardner was slightly better
to-day. His temperature is rang
ing a little lower than it has been
for the past week, and Bhould it
drop still further by to-morrow
there will be a decided improve
ment in his condition. He Ie still
delirious the greater part of the
time. There is no definite period
in the progress of typhoid fever
which may be called the crisis, but
the fever drops away by degrees.
This week, however, it will be posi
tively known whether complica
tions will set in. Should there be
no change for the worse, Mr. Gard
ner will probably be pronounced
out of danger.
