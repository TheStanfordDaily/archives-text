In another column appears a!
communication from a prominent!
Senior in which the suggestion
made that the men and women ofj
the University wear black ties and
scarfs as a token of their sorrow at
the passing of Mrs. Stanford. Sim
ilar suggestions have been made by
several other personp, and un
doubtedly will appeal to many.
There are, however, many persons
who, carrying the keenest grief in
their heart, do not believe in out
ward manifestations of their sor
row. In a case like the present,
the question of mourning is one
that is better left to each individual
to decide in his own wav.
