# Junior Prom May Not Be Held.

### 
At a meeting of the Junior prom
committee, held yesterday after
noon, the question of holding the
annual prom was discussed. The
committee did not consider the
proposition favorably, and at the
next class meeting this committee
will recommend that, in view of
the death of Mrs. Stanford, the
Junior prom be cancelled. A class
meeting will be held to-morrow af
ternoon.
