For the benefit of those organi
zations which have been compelled
to rearrange their dates owing to
the death of Mrs. Stanford, we
print to-night a new University
calendar, containing bucli sched
uled events as have already been
announced and some which it is
reasonably certain will occur as
first announced. If any eventp
have been omitted for which the
date is definitely known, the Daily
Palo Alto would be glad to receive
prompt notification.
