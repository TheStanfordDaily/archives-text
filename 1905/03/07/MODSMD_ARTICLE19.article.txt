Those men who are acting as
collectors of funds for the athletic
field can very materially help the
cause by co-operating more fully
with the treasurer of the student
body than appears to have been
the case. The developments of the
past few days have entirely upset
the elaborate plans of the student
body treasurer and manager for
the rest of the semester, making
necessary prompt attention to a
great multitude of details in effect
ing a rearrangement of athletic
schedules and others matters. The
demands upon the time and ener
gies of Mr. Barrett are undoubtedly
very great, and he cannot possibly
make the round of all those whom
the president of the Associated
Students has appointed to collect
subscriptions. It should be no
great task, however, for the indi
vidual men collectors to report
progress to the treasurer during hie
office hour (1 to 2 o'clock daily) in
the Encina gymnasium. This will
enable the work to be carried on
more systematically and expe
ditiously, and will put an end to
the present dragging of the work.
