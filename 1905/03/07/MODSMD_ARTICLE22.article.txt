### 
The meeting of the Training
House Corporation, which was;
postponed from Wednesday, was;
held Saturday afternoon on the]
quad. An entirely new board of
directors was elected and three ad
ditional men were chosen members
of the corporation. The new board
is made up of four former mem
bers and the three newly elected
men. These latter were chosen
from a list of nine nominees made
by the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students. Nominations
were made in groups of three, and
one man from each group was to
be elected. Dr. T. M. Williams,
'97, R. W. Barrett, '04, and A. L.
Trowbridge, '05, were elected to
membership. The following is a
list of the men nominated: J. F.
Lanagan, '00, A. L. Trowbridge,'os,
and H. W. Chappel, '01, in the
first group; C. A. Naramore, '03,
11. W. Barrett, '04, and W. E.
Crawford, '05, in the second group;
and H. H. Chandler, '05, D. D.
Sales, '06, and T. M. Williams, '97,
in the third group.
Dr. Williams is a practicing
physician of Palo Alto. He is a
former Varsity football player,
having been one of Stanford's
greatest centers. Barrett is taking
law work in college and is treas
urer of the Associated Students.
He was on the Varsity track team
for two years. Trowbridge, the
undergraduate member of the cor
poration, is prominent as a base
ball and football player and is
Senior class president. He has
played baseball for several years
and is captain of the team this
year.
The complete board of directors
now consists of these three men
and the following old members: F.
L. Berry, '89, H. H. Taylor, '00, J.
E. McDowell, '00, and T. J. Hoover,
'01. Berry is a practicing attor
ney of San Francisco; Taylor is a
member of the printing firm of
Stanley, Taylor and Company of
San Francisco; and Hoover is in
terested in mining in Bodie. Mc-
Dowell is Assistant Registrar of
the University.
Officers of the Training House
Corporation were elected as follows:
J. E. McDowell, president; F. L.
Berry, vice-president; H. H. Tay
lor, secretary; and Dr. F. Angell,
treasurer. Three sub-committees
were appointed to conduct the de
tailed work of the corporation. A
committee on grounds consisting of
Dr. Angell, chairman, A. L. Trow
bridge, '05, R. W. Barrett, '04, Dr.
T. M. Williams, '99, and J. E. Mc-
Dowell has already gone over the
details of the plans for the athletic
field. The acceptance of the plans
as they stand was recommended,
and contracts for the work of con
struction will be let as soon as pos
sible. The grading will probably
be under way by April Ist. The
entire athletic field will be graded,
but at present only that portion to
be used for the football field will
be worked over.

A finance committee made up of
F. L. Berry, chairman, Dr. T. M.
Williams, and H. H. Taylor was
appointed. The duty of this com
mittee is to raise funds from among
the alumni and other sources.
Barrett, Berry, and McDowell,
chairman, were chosen for the com
mittee on future organization.

They will work in conjunction with
the student body in formulating a
plan for the care and superintend
ence of the athletic fields.
The reorganized Training House
Corporation will probably stand in
its present form for some time to
come. Heretofore its membership
has included but seven persons, all
of whom served as directors. There
are now ten members of the cor
poration, with the board of direct
ors still made up of seven mem
bers. The three additional old
members are Dr. T. A. Storey, '96,
C. A. Cantwell, '02, and J. B. Gil
dersleeve, ex-'O3. The reorganiza
tion was affected in order to secure
men near at hand who were active
ly interested in its affairs. Many
of the old men were either too far
away or too busy to be able to do
this, and the affairs of the corpor
ation demand more attention now
than ever before.
