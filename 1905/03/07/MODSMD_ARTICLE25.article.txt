"My Dear Sir: —I am in receipt
on this date of a telegram from His
Excellency K. Takahira, Minister
of my Government at the city of
Washington, in which he expresses
his profound regret over the news
of Mrs. Stanford's death, and begs
that I will convey to you, or to
whomsoever it is due, his sincerest
condolence and deepest sympathy.
"To this sentiment I beg to add
my own tribute of respect and sor
row. The noble life just closed was
wider than the great State to which
she had been a benefactress. Its
beneficent influence extended be
yond the nation which has been
honored by her citizenship. Its at
tributes were such that the world
could claim it, for it belonged to
humanity. And of that great fam
ily none will mourn her more sin
cerely, or hold her memory in
greater reverence, than the people
of Japan. I am, sir, in great respect,
