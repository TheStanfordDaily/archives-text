# COLLECTING STANFORD SONGS.
## Decennial Volume of Drinking, Rooting and Farce Verses Soon to Be Published. 
### 
After many suggestions and dis
cussion, the idea of collecting the
best Stanford songs and issuing
them in book form has resulted in
a definite plan of action. M. H.
Thorpe, '05, has decided to get out
such a book, and he has begun ac
tive work. The book will be called
"A Decennial of Stanford Song."
The idea is to gather together the
words and music of all the Stan
ford drinking and rooting songs
and also the best farce songs. Each
song will also have the music, and
it is estimated that the book will
contain about seventy-five songs.
The book will be bound in board
covers, with an appropriate cover
design by 11. \V. Borough, '04.
Many of the songs will be carica
tured to illustrate the nature of the
song, and this humorous art work
will be one of the principal features
of the book. R. E. Snodgrass, '01,
instructor in Entomology, willi
have charge of this art work, and (
he has contributed a large number
of characteristic drawings. L. M.
Bowman, '01, will illustrate his
song "One, Two, Three, Four," de
picting the different types of the
four college years.
Thorpe has met with consider
able difficulty in getting permis
sion from the publishers to use
copyrighted music. This trouble
has nearly all been overcome, how
ever, and he is now busy collecting
old drinking and farce songs, many
of which have not been kept and
are hard to obtain.
The volume will contain about
one hundred and forty pages.
Subscriptions will be received for.
the book at $1.50 each until March
20th. Names may be left at the
University Bookstore or at Sim
kins' in Palo Alto. A hundred
copies above the subscription list
will be printed. These have been
sold to a local bookstore and will
be retailed at $2.50 each.
