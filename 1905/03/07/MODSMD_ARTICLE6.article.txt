# Collection of Funds.
## 
### 
The work of collecting funds for
the new athletic field is progressing
very favorably. Manager Barrett
has received $250 up to the present
time, and this sum probably repre
sents about one-fourth, or perhaps
less, of what has been collected.
Owing to other business of im
portance, Manager Barrett has not
yet been able to visit all the collect
ors. It has been reported that
every collector has received gener
ous contributions, and the total will
be large. Before the end of the
week Manager Barrett expects to
have all the returns, and he will
make a report then.
Up to date the business men of
PaloAltohave not been approached.
All the collections thus far have
been made among students.
