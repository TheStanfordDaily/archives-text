# BODY TO LIE IN STATE.
## Mrs. Stanford's Remains Will Rest in the Memorial Church for One Day. 
### 
It has been decided to hold the
funeral of Mrs. Stanford two days
after the arrival of the body in San
Francisco. The remains will lie
instate in the Memorial Church
for one day.
Arrangements for the funeral
cannot be made because of the un
certainty of the time of the return
of the remains. The steamship
China, on which the body will be
brought from Honolulu, is due to
arrive in San Francisco on March
16th, but it is possible that it will
not arrive until March 17th.
President Jordan will cable to Mr.
Lathrop, upon arrival in Honolulu,
the exact time the China will leave
port, so that definite plans can be
iformulated here.
