# INTERCOLLEGIATE REGATTA MAY BE OFF.
## Stanford Declines to Row on the Oakland Estuary. Stockton Makes Generous Offer to the Boat Club. 
### 
A LIVELY contest is being
waged between the boat clubs
of Stanford and California in re
gard to the location of the course
over which the intercollegiate re
gatta shall be rowed. Both of the
clubs have turned the matter over
to their respective student body
managers, and the final decision
will not be reached for several
days.
California demands that the re
gatta be rowed on the Oakland
estuary, while Stanford absolutely
refuses to row on this course. At
a meeting of Boat Club officials
Monday night it was decided that
unless California is willing to con
test on some other course than the
estuary, the intercollegiate match
will be called off. Managers Bar
rett and Decoto met Monday in
San Francisco, but could not come
to any agreement. The question
was therefore laid aside for a few
days until the final decision of the
boat clubs is made. Manager Bar
rett will meet Decoto in conference
again.
Stanford's objection to the Oak
land estuary is two-fold. In the
first place the water there is usu
ally rough, as was the case in last
year's regatta, which was rowed on
this course. This is an important
matter, because the races this year
will be rowed in shells which are
far more sensitive to rough weather
than the barges used last season.
Another objection is the fact that
the California crews practice on
the estuary and therefore are well
accustomed to the current and
wind. This is a very important
matter in a contest of this kind,
and would amount to giving Cali
fornia a material handicap in the
race.
Several other locations are being
considered by the two clubs, but
the best one to develop so far is a
course at Stockton. Here there is
a good location which has been
used for some time by the Stockton
Rowing Club. There is a strip of
water, practically a straightaway,
over three miles long, and the
water is always calm. The course
is situated on a slough and is
about one hundred yards wide.
The facilities offered for viewing
the race are also exceptionally
good. There is a good wagon road
on the banks of the slough from
which the race could be watched in
carriages. But the best accommo
dation for people would be in the
grandstand which the Stockton
Chamber of Commerce has offered
to build free of cost to the colleges.
Beside this, it is proposed to divide
the entire gate receipts between
California and Stanford. Colvin
B. Brown, secretary of the Stock
ton Chamber of Commerce, has
written the following letter to
President Butterfield of the Boat
Club:
"Dear Sir: —The matter of hold
ing the next intercollegiate regatta
at Stockton was brought up at the

meeting of our board of directors
yesterday, and we can give you as-'
surance that we will make arrange
ments that will be altogether satis
factory. Please let us hear further
from you in the matter, as we want]
to put our committees to work. It
is proposed that we offer a hand-'
some cup and erect grandstands,'
turning over the receipts to the'
visiting boat clubs. These details!
will be left to the committee, how
ever, in the event that we get a
favorable reply. We feel sure that
you would be pleased with your
reception here. Our people would
like very much to have you come."
Definite news regarding the offer
of a cup has been received. This
part of the work was undertaken
by the Stockton High School, and
the students have met with great
success. The original plan was to
collect about $200, but at the pres
ent time the subscriptions have
reached $1000.
In case a contest with California
cannot be arranged, the club is
considering a southern trip, where
a contest could be had with one of
the numerous rowing clubs. The
University of Washington is also
seeking a contest with Stanford,
and it is possible that the Cardinal
will take part in the annual re
gatta held at Portland during the
and Clark Exposition. In
case this regatta should take place,
it is probable that the Portland
Rowing Club wculd enter a new
crew, and a crew from one of the
other northern universities might
also contest.

to build free of cost to the colleges.
Beside this, it is proposed to divide
the entire gate receipts between
California and Stanford. Colvin
B. Brown, secretary of the Stock
ton Chamber of Commerce, has
written the following letter to
President Butterfield of the Boat
Club:
"Dear Sir: —The matter of hold
ing the next intercollegiate regatta
at Stockton was brought up at the

meeting of our board of directors
yesterday, and we can give you as-'
surance that we will make arrange
ments that will be altogether satis
factory. Please let us hear further
from you in the matter, as we want]
to put our committees to work. It
is proposed that we offer a hand-'
some cup and erect grandstands,'
turning over the receipts to the'
visiting boat clubs. These details!
will be left to the committee, how
ever, in the event that we get a
favorable reply. We feel sure that
you would be pleased with your
reception here. Our people would
like very much to have you come."
Definite news regarding the offer
of a cup has been received. This
part of the work was undertaken
by the Stockton High School, and
the students have met with great
success. The original plan was to
collect about $200, but at the pres
ent time the subscriptions have
reached $1000.
In case a contest with California
cannot be arranged, the club is
considering a southern trip, where
a contest could be had with one of
the numerous rowing clubs. The
University of Washington is also
seeking a contest with Stanford,
and it is possible that the Cardinal
will take part in the annual re
gatta held at Portland during the
and Clark Exposition. In
case this regatta should take place,
it is probable that the Portland
Rowing Club wculd enter a new
crew, and a crew from one of the
other northern universities might
also contest.
