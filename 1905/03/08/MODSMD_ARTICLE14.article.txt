The action of the Sophomore
class in reserving the privilege of
voting to those who entered with
the class of 1907 or who come from
another university with sophomore
standing does not seem to be well
considered, for if enforced to the
letter as passed at the class meet
ing, it would work a serious injus
tice upon many. The most glaring
fault is that it would bar from the
class all those who entered the
University the Christmas before
the class of '07, and to whom the
privilege is always granted of affil
iating in their second semester
with either the freshmen or the
sophomores, at their choice. For
obvious reasons the class did not

intend to take away this privilege,
and in practice its committee did
not bar such "Christmas fresh
men" from voting. But the com
mittee did enforce the edict against
others who would seem to have a
perfectly just claim to vote with
'07 if they chose to do so. The
committee said that a man who
entered with any other class in its
first semester could not vote, re
gardless of the number of hours he
might have or the special circum
stances of his case; a man who
came in with '06, said the commit
tee, could have no standing in '07
until '06 had passed out of college.
It is generally the caee that when
a man, on the completion of his
freshman year, stays out for twelve
months and then returns, he calls
himself a ljunior. It has even hap
pened that a freshman has come
hack after an absence of two years
and called himself a senior. This
is a man's privilege, but if he takes
what is perhaps a more sensible
view of the case and prefers to
spend the remainder of his college
career in affiliation with the class
with which he must ultimately
graduate and whose numerals he
mu√üt finally and always bear, no
obstacle should be placed in his
way. It means a great deal more
to him than it does to the class,
and there is no reason why a class
tfhould he exclusive and close its
doors upon him.
