# GOLF PETITION GRANTED.
## Board of Trustees Takes Favorable Action, Regranting the Old Links. 
### 
At the last meeting of the Board
of Trustees, the petition asking for
the restoration of the University
property formerly used as golf
links was favorably received by the
board, which unanimously sanc
tioned the return of the property.
The use of the links, however, is
conditioned upon the payment of a
certain amount of rental by the or
ganization which will be in control
of golf interests.
When the use of the grounds
was withdrawn three years ago,
the Stanford Golf Club was at the
head of affairs, and maintained
throughout its existence a large
membership roll. It will now be
reorganized, and with the large
number of persons who are actively
interested in the sport, the club
will begin operations on a sub
stantial basis.
