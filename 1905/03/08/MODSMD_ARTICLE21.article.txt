## 
### 
The condition of Rev. D. C.
Gardner was slightly improved to
day. His temperature has dropped
to between 103 and 104 degrees and
he rested better laßt night. Hie
delirium still continues, but his
lucid intervals are more frequent
and of longer duration. His con
dition now is far more hopeful
than it has yet been this week, and
should no hemorrhage occur before
Sunday, he will be pronounced out
of danger.
