# Report on Scholarship.
## 
### 
The faculty committee on scholar
ship has finished sending out the
first cards of the semester. Only
four students were suspended from
the University, while twelve were
similarly treated at a correspond
ing time last year. The committee
has ceased compiling a tabular re
port by departments, and has also
ceased issuing warning cards. In
place of these a report of deficiency
lis issued which simply states the
subject in which the deficiency oc
curs. A large number of these
notices were sent out. Anyone re
ported as deficient in a single sub
ject, it is stated, received one of
these warnings.
