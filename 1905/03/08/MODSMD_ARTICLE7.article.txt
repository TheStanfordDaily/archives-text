"Whereas, Our beloved alma]
mater has sustained an irreparable]
loss in the death of Mrs. Jane L.
Stanford, one of the wisest and
most philanthropic of women; and
"Whereas, By her beneficence
and interest in the educationalj
welfare of the people of our
and nation she has given to every;

man and woman in the land the
privileges of a university training;
therefore be it
"Resolved, By the Stockton
alumni of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, that we, in com
mon with all friends of education,
most sincerely deplore the taking
away of this grand woman, who
has done so much for the cause of
humanity; and that we are confi
dent that the memories of her
womanly qualities and her far
reaching sympathy will ever be
enshrined in the hearts of all
Stanford men and women.
