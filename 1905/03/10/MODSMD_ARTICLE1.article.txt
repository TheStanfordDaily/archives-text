# GREAT STANFORD MANSION NOW A PART OF THE UNIVERSITY
## The 						Handsome Residence May Be Used as an Affiliated College or a Library. 
### courtesy of the San Francisco Examiner 
ON February 11, 1897, Mrs.]
Stanford met the Board of
Trustees of the University and pre
sented them with a deed for the
Stanford residence on California
street, in San Francisco, at the
same time taking occasion to ex
press to the Trustees a statement of
the policy which she desired to see
pursued in the control of the insti
tution. The following is the intro
duction to the address which she
made at the presentation of the
deed :
"In deeding to you this home
and its contents this afternoon I
am merely carrying out the inten
tions of my beloved husband and
doing what he would have done
had I been first called hence to the
life eternal and he remained here
alone. In his last will and testa
ment he distinctly and at some
length expressed such intention.
Therefore, while I am left alone to
execute this deed, it is in fact the
deed of both of us. And since this
is the first opportunity I have had
of bestowing, by myself, a gift upon
the students of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University, I deem it
proper and fitting to give the
Trustees a few directions in regird
to the future work, which, in the
natural course of events, it must
soon be their duty to carry out as
managers and responsible custodi
ans of that institution, but which,
for the present, by the will of our
Heavenly Father, devolves on me
as sole surviving founder of the
University.
Affiliated Colleges Suggested.
"In the first place, I hope that
the time may come when this
home, which is so dear to me, will
be found useful as an affiliated
college to the Leland Stanford
Junior University, or as a library
for the use of the students of the
University and the community at
large, and it would gratify me ex
ceedingly if I could fill it with
books and make it accessible to all.
But in whatever manner it may be
ultimately decided that this home
be used, I wish it to be expressly
understood that I direct that it be
devoted to the uses and service of
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, and I direct and declare
that it shall never be converted
into a club-house, a boarding
house, or a place of undignified
amusement."
As further provided in the deed
itself, Mrs. Stanford was to retain
the house during her lifetime. Ac
cordingly it now becomes the prop
erty of the University,and "will be
dedicated and set aside as an affili-j
ated college of Leland Stanford]

Junior University, or as a library
for the use of students of said Uni
versity, and the people of the city
and county of San Francisco,or for
some benevolent purpose, for the
instruction of the said students and
people in such mode and manner,
and with such limitations, as the
Trustees and their successors may
deem best."
Worth Over Two Millions.
The mansion and its contents,
now become the full property of
the University, are valued at ap
proximately $2,300,000. Senator
Stanford built the residence in
1875, in the early part of his ca
reer as a millionaire railway presi
dent and owner. He originally
owned the entire block occupied by
the residence, but the lot upon
which the Hopkins Art Institute
now stands was sold to Mark Hop
kins shortly after the completion of
the Stanford mansion. The latter
occupies a lot fronting 206 feet on
California street, 275 feet on Powell
street, and 206 on Pine street. It
is a three-story wooden structure,
built on the rather old style of
jjcostly mansions, many of which
were built on Nob Hill about thirty
years ago. It is surrounded by a
considerable area of lawn. It is
estimated that the value of the
house and lot to-day is about
$750,000, while the art gallery, the
library, the statuary, bronze and
mosaic works, and other art treas
ures which it contains have been
conservatively valued at $1,500,000.
Many plans have been consid
ered for the use which the Univer
sity is to make of the mansion. It
'could easily be turned into a li

brary or museum, but the plan that
has been favored most is that it
should become a department or
affiliated college of the Univer
sity. What is to become of it will
be for the Hoard of Trustees to de
cide as soon as they see tit.
Professor Howard's Plan.
In connection with this ques
tion it is interesting to note the
scheme presented some years ago
by Professor George Elliott How
ard, then head of the History de
partment. The scheme embodied
a "Stanford Academy of History,
Economics, and Social Science,"
and was described by Profesßor
Howard as follows:
"Its special work as an 'exten
t-ion college' will be concerned
mainly with those practical ques
tions upon whose wiße solution the
improvement of society largely de
pends. Its location is advanta
geous, being in the center of the
chief civic life on the coast of
Western America. At present one
third of the people of California
are within a short radius of the
residence. Moreover, there is ur
gent need here of advancing the
scientific study of history, domestic
and public economy, and all that
pertains to good government and
to righteousness in social life.
"Such an academy may well
subserve two main related pur
poses. First, it may become the
center of the principal extension
work of the University, and thus
constitute, in reality, an affiliated
college for the promotion of those
studies which are at present of
paramount interest to society.
Second, it may provide a home for

an association which will stimu
late thought and research along
the same lines throughout the
States of the entire region west of
the Rocky mountains.
"Naturally the principal work of
the extension division of the acad
emy will be in the closely related
departments of economics, social
science and history. Everywhere
in our country there is urgent de
mand for instruction in these sub
jects. Especially is there crying
need of it on the Pacific Slope; and
San Francisco, the chief center of
civic life in Western America, af
fords a rare opportunity for effect
ive work on a large scale. Each
year courses of instruction may be
offered in domestic and public
economy, finance, charities and
corrections, municipal administra
tion, questions of labor and capi
tal, and in various branches of
history, particularly the history of
California and the Pacific Slope.
Wide Extension Work.
"But the extension work need
not be restricted to this field alone.
Instruction in art, literature,
ethics, education, physiology and
hygiene, and other branches may
be provided. Accordingly, courses
of lectures each year may be given
representing the following major
groups:
"1. History, particularly in the
general history of our own country ;
in the history of industry, art and
institutions, and in the history of
the States of the Pacific Slope.
"2. Economics and social sci
ence, embracing courses on finance,
labor and capita], railroad trans

portat'.on, charities and corrections,
municipal problems, sociology, do
mestic and public economy and
similar topics.
"3. Miscellaneous courees in art,
literature, ethics, education and
other departments.
"4. Lectures, scientific or popu
lar, by distinguished men interest
ed in the work and aims of the
academy.
"5. At Mrs. Stanford's express
desire, courses in Bible science and
ethical topics.
''In connection with the exten
sion division, which, it may be
noted, is to provide for courses in
all departments of the University
wishing to offer them, provision is
to be made for post-graduate study,
so that persons living in San Fran
cisco may register as candidates for
higher degrees, as at the Univer
sity, without the necessity of going
to Palo Alto. It is proposed to
hold sessions of the 'seminaries' for
graduate work at the academy.
To Bring Together Noted Men.
"As for the 'Association Divis
ion,' it is hoped that by inviting
the co operation of fellow-workers
as members the academy may be
come an association which shall
unite the leading writers, teachers,
and students of history, economics
and social science throughout
Western America in one powerful
organization. The association will
combine three objects: (1) To hold
periodical meetings for discussion,
the reading of scientific papers,
criticism and for personal inter
course; (2) to publish the results
of investigation in volumes and in
serial form; (3) to collect a li
brary. Indeed, the creation of a
library, to be mainly a library of
society publications from all parts
of the world, will be a leading ob
ject. Such a library may be large
ly gathered through exchange of
publications. The building will be
admirably fitted to become the lo
cal habitation of the association
and to house a large library."
