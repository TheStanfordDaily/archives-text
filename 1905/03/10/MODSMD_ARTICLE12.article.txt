# QUESTIONS OF MOURNING.
## Matter Left to Students Themselves. Proposed Trip to Meet the Body. 
### 
At a meeting of the Executive
Committee held Wednesday night
the members of the Athletic Com
mittee and several upper-classmen
were present. The question of
formal mourning for Mrs. Stanford
was thoroughly discussed. In re
gard to the general wearing of
black ties or other emblems of
mourning, it was decided to leave
this to the discretion of the individ
ual students. A suggestion that
the college colors be changed to
cardinal and black for one year
was not favorably considered by
those present at the meeting.
Another proposition which was
discussed at length was the plan
to have the men students go up to
San Francisco the day Mrs. Stan
ford's body arrives from Honolulu
and escort the remains to the train.
No definite conclusion was reached,
one reason being that the committee
did not know whether the body
was to be taken to the Stanford
residence in San Francisco or
brought here directly upon its ar
rival from Honolulu. A committee
composed of R. W. Barrett, '04, L.
P. Bansbach, '05, T. M. Coen, '05,
and B. S. Allen, '06, was appointed
to confer with C. G. Lathrop upon
the subject.
