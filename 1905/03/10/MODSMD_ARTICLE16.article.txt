### 
The following resolutions were
adopted at a meeting of the former
students of Stanford University
assembled at Los Angeles on Mon
day:
"Whereas, The unexpected an
nouncement of the death of Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford hascome as
a profound shock to the world and
as a sad blow to those here assem
bled, graduates and former stu
dents of the great institution estab
lished by her and her honored hus
band; and
"Whereas, We wish to pay our
tribute of respect and affection to
the memory of this true, loyal,
well-beloved benefactress of the
youth of this State and Nation;
and
"Whereas, We feel that in her
untimely death the University has
lost its strongest, most tireless
helper and adviser —one who forgot
her own sorrows and cares in ad
ministering, wisely and beneficent
ly, the trust committed to her
hands by her husband; therefore,
be it
"Resolved, That we hereby ex
tend to President David Starr Jor
dan of our alma mater, to the
members of the faculty thereof, and
to the immediate relatives of the
late Mrs. Stanford, our sincere sym
pathy in this, our common loss;
that we hereby express our deep
affection for the devoted woman
who has passed away, and our
gratitude for the heritage she has
left in the mighty university, whose
design was perfected by her as it
had been conceived and begun by
her husband —an imperishable
monument to the wisdom and de
votion of a noble character, a pow
erful aid in the cause of higher ed
ucation and civilization ;
"Resolved, That a copy of these
resolutions be transmitted to Pres
ident Jordan of Leland Stanford
Junior University."
A. J. Copp, '02, temporary chair
man of the Associated Stanford
Students of Los Angeles, writing to
B. P. Oakford, '02, says:"The
southern part of the State wishes to
be represented in every possible
way at the funeral of Mrs. Stan
ford and is willing to meet any
proportionate call that may be
made by those from the north
actively in charge. This section as
a whole will send a floral piece and
a set of resolutions on parchment,
and endeavor to be represented by
some Stanford graduate in person.
The individual classes (nearly all
from '95 to '05 being represented at
our recent meeting of former Stan
ford students of Los Angeles) have
organized for this purpose, and,
writing officially for the class of
1902, I have been given authority
to say that this class (aB all others)
is ready to fall in line and take the
program prepared by our northern
mates."
