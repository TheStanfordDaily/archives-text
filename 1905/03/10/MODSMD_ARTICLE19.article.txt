# Chaplain Much Improved.
## 
### 
The condition of Rev. 1). Charles
Gardner was much improved to
day. HiB temperature has dropped
two degrees in the past two days
and is now ranging between 101
and 102. His delirium still con
tinues and he is very weak, but
his condition may be regarded as
very hopeful. Should no compli
cations set in, his recovery from
now on will be rapid, as the fever
drops away very quickly, but his
convalesence will be- slow on ac
count of his weakened condition.
