# DR. ABBOTT LECTURES.
## Law Students Listen to Interesting Talk on Legal Topics. 
### 
Dr. Nathan Abbott delivered the!
fifth of his eeries of lectures onj
legal topics Wednesday afternoon!
to a large gathering of law etu-1
dents in the lecture room of the!
Law department. The subject of|
Dr. Abbott's lecture was "Digests!
and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis."!
He said in part:
"Lord Coke's library had thirty!
volumes. A complete modern lawfl
library would have from forty-five
to forty-eight thousand volumes.'
This vast number of books hasj
made some system of indexing
necessary, and as a result digests
are now prepared. These
of the law make it accessible and]
make it possible for lawyers andl
judges to follow the previous de-|
cisions of the courts.
"There are two theories of the3
origin of the rules of the common!
law. The first is that there is a|
complete body of law in existence!
in space, as it were, and that the!
judge in laying down a rule of law
simply declares what the previously
existing law is. The second theory
is that the judges in deciding cases
create the law which they lav
down. But the true theory would
seem to be that judicial decisions
may be either creative, as when!
they declare a new rule, or declara-l
tory, as when they apply an old*
one laid down in previous cases." ~
