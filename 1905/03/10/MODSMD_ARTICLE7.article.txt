awarding the silver cup of the
Women's Athletic Association, as
well aB to select the intercollegiate

has been planned, however, to play
the finals to-morrow if possible,

and if not, by the first of next
week.

Miss May Dunn, '08, defeated Miss
Hay ward, '06, and thus proved
her claim to enter the finals. Miss
