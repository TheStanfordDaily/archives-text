# ULTIMATUM FOR CALIFORNIA.
## Regatta Must Be Away from the Oakland Estuary or Not at All. 
### 
The final decision as to where
the intercollegiate regatta will be
held has not been made, and there
still remains a possibility that the
contest will be canceled. In ne
gotiating with Manager Decoto of
California on Saturday, Treasurer
Barrett came to no definite agree
ment, and a decision will not be
reached for several days. The
California manager maintained
that the regatta should be held on
the Oakland estuary, and Barrett
delivered the ultimatum of the
Stanford Boat Club to the effect
that if another course could not be
agreed upon there would be no race
this season. Manager Decoto de
cided to lay the matter before the
California Boat Club. At a meet
ing to-morrow the club will decide
whether to abandon the contest
this year or consent to have the re
gatta take place on some other
course than the one at Oakland.
In this meeting with Barrett, De
coto favored the Oakland course
for the following reasons: First, be
cause the course was on the line of
the narrow gauge railroad, and
this would enable an excursion
train to view the race from begin
ning to end, and probably result in
larger financial returns than would
be received elsewhere; secondly, by
having it at Oakland, the regatta
could be held on the morning of
the field meet, which would insure
a large attendance of students;
thirdly, Decoto maintained that the
proposed course on the estuary was
neutral ground because it was not
being used as a practice course by
the California crews.

To these arguments Barrett
maintained that the Oakland
course was far from being neutral.
He showed that it was used by the
California crews last year in prac
tice, and also that they had used
this course to some extent until a
month ago. Even if the crews of
the State University had not used
this portion of the estuary for prac
tice, it still remains true that they
were using the water a short dis
tance above it, and the currents,
tide, and wind at the two places
are the same. Barrett held that
the experience of last year's races
was sufficient to deter the colleges
from using the course again. The
water is rough over the greater
part of the course, and the crew
drawing the sheltered side would
have an immense advantage.
Another point made by the
Stanford manager was that there
were several better courses avail
able, which would in all respects
be more suitable for an intercol
legiate regatta, among them being
a course at Stockton. The point
that Barrett laid the most stress
on was the fact that public senti
ment at Stanford is against having
the regatta take place at Oakland
because of the unequal conditions
operating against any two contest
ing crews. He considered that
since boating is as yet undeveloped
to the extent of other branches of
athletics, it would be unwise to ar
raign public sentiment against it.

The decision of California will be
mide Wednesday, and in case they
are willing to look for a new loca
tion for a course, a final agreement
should be reached inside of a week.
Besides the location at Stockton,'
courses at Vallejo and Belvedere
will be considered. .
