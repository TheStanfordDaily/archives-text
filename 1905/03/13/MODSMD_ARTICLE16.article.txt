# VARSITY LOSES AGAIN.
## Feature of Game with St. Mary's a Long Drive by Rook.—Many Men Struck Out. 
### 
The third baseball game of thel
season between St. Mary's College*
and the Varsity waß won by thej
former by the close score of 1 to 0.1
The contest was played Saturday!
afternoon at Recreation Park, Sanj
Francisco. The game was closel
throughout, and it was not until!
the seventh inning that the first!
and winning run was scored. ThisS
tally was scored by Lundy, andg
was the result of a base on balls|
and an error. With the score 1 tol
0 in the ninth inning, Rookl
knocked a long drive over the right!
field fence, scoring himself andfl
Trowbridge, who was on second.l
Umpire Leahy, however, called the|
ball a foul, though the general]
opinion was that the ball was fairß
by a narrow margin.
Both Sales and Ferguson pitched!
high-class ball, the former striking
out eleven men and allowing three
hits, and the latter striking out
twelve and having but one safe hit
made off his delivery. Stanford
fielded well as a team. Rook, who
took Fenton's place at third base,
played a steady game at that posi
tion. j
Though Saturday's game was ex
pected to be the last played with
St. Mary's, Manager Barrett is now
arranging for two more games to be
played later on the campus. The
games scheduled for this week, one
with the Clabrough-Golcber team
on Tuesday, with the San Jose
Professionals on Thursday, and
with the Independents on Satur
day, have been canceled. The
Varsity will play Santa Clara Col
lege in Santa Clara Thursday
afternoon.
Score: 112
