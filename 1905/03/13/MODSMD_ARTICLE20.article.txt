# COMPARISON OF RECORDS.
## What the Athletes of the University of California and Stanford Are Doing. 
### 
The performances in the inter
class field-day held at the Univer
sity of California on Saturday afford
an interesting means of comparison
with the work that is being done at
Stanford. The most notable per
formances of the meet were the fast
time in the mile, and a broad jump
of 23 feet inch by Snedigar.
Newhall won the mile in 4:39
3-5, with Meals and Lyons close at
his heels. Miller, '08, is the only
Stanford miler who can run that
distance in the same time at pres
ent. Weinmann, '06, Knupp, '07,
Thompson, '05, and Seelton, '08,
are running the mile under 5 flat.
The 100-yard dash went to Snedi
gar in the good time of 10:1. Ed
wards, '07, is Stanford's best per
former thus far at this distance,
and his record is a littleunder 10:2.
Cope's foot improves very slowly,
and it is improbable that he will be
able to compete in the intercolle
giate field-day.
Frei won the high hurdles in the
fair time of 17:1. With Lanagan,
'05, in the April meet, and Horton
improving at his present rate, Sta
nford ought to win two places in
this event.
Edwards of California won the
440-yard dash in 53:3. Edwards,
'07, Carter, '05, and Davis, '08,
have equaled this record in prac
tice.
Moody, Wheeler, and Hackley
finished close together in the order
named in the two-mile run, which
was covered in 10:42. Burr,'os,has
run a trial two-mile in 10:27, and
it is not unreasonable to expect him
to take first place from the Califor
nia entries this year. Nash, '07, is
out of form at present, but if he
again gets into condition he will be
a factor in the long-distance race.
Snedigar took the 220-yard dash
in 23:1. Wood, '07, and Gartz
mann, '08, have sprinted the dis
tance in 23:2.
In the half-mile Mishler finished
first after covering the distance in
2:05.2. Miller, '08, can make the
distance close to two-minutes, while
Bounds, '05, Russell, '06, and Sev
ery, '08, have closely approached
the California runner's record.
Golcher won the low hurdles in
the slow time of 27:2. With Lana
gan, '05, Weller, '07, Macfarland,
'07, and Horton, '08, Stanford
ought to take all three places in
this event.
Clifford and Hickey tied for first
in the high jump at 5 feet inches.
Captain Bell is consistently clear
ing the bar at a higher notch than
the record established by the State
University athletes, while Dehy,'os,
has equalled it.
Gilmore put the shot 42 feet
inches, which is considerably better
than any Stanford performance
this season. Horton put the weight
41 feet 6 inches last fall but he has
never equaled it since.
Snedigar won the broad jump
with the unusual leap of 23 feet {
inch. Weller has jumped 22 feet 8
inches in practice this season,while
Captain Bell ie jumping close to 22
feet.
Zoph took first place in the pole
vault at 10 feet inches. Lana
gan, '08, is good for 11 feet in this
event; while Whitaker,'os,although
out of form, is clearing the bar at
10 feet 6 inches.
Zacharias threw the hammer

146 feet 8 inches. Crawford, *05,'
is doing better than this in prac-l
tice, but Stanford has no other men
who can approach the throw made,
by Zacharias.
