# TRIBUTES TO MRS. STANFORD.
## Press of the United States Expresses Regret at Passing of the Philanthropist. 
### 
The widespread regret at the
death of Mrs. Stanford is well evi
denced by the expressions of the
press of the country. The Daily
Palo Alto reprints some of these
to-night. The New York American
says:
"By the death of Mrs. Leland
Stanford the world loses one of its
greatest and gentlest figures. This
lonely woman, bereft first of the
son who was her idol, and then of
her husband, whose sharing of her
anguish made it easier to bear, re
fused to give herself over to selfish
grief and devoted herself to carry
ing out the great trust that de
volved upon her. She knew little
of business when she took up
her life's task, but she applied her
self to the mastery of the manage
ment of a great fortune, not for
any selfish purpose, but in order
that the University founded in her
eon's memory might not suffer.
She was ready to bear poverty her
self if need be, but the cause to
which she devoted her life should
not want. The thousands of young
men and women who have gained
an education because of her sym
pathy, humanity and self-sacrifice,
and unnumbered thousands yet to
come, will bless the memory of the
woman who made Leland Stanford
University possible."
