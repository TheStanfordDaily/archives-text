The New York Tribune says:
"The University founded in mem
ory of their son by Senator and
Mrs. Stanford, enriched by him at
his death and put not long ago by
her act into possession of virtually
all her great estate, will doubtless
continue its beneficent services in
the field of education without in
terruption or disturbance. Yet
Mrs. Stanford's death creates a
void which cannot be filled, and
her devoted and profoundly sym
pathetic ministrations in its behalf
will long be missed by those re
sponsible for the fulfillment of a
sacred trust which is without
a parallel among memorial foun
dations."
