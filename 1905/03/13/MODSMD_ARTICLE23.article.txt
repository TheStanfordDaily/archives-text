The Springfield (Mass.) Repub
lican says:"The millions that
Senator Stanford realized, through
the action of husband and wife,
will do good in California so long
as there are youth to be educated
there. The two gave $20,000,000
for the University which bears the
name of their son, and to that Mrs.
Stanford added above $10,000,000,
more. Nor is this all. She de
voted some $200,000 to establishing
kindergartens in San Francisco,
and also built the children's hospi
tal in Albany, N. Y., and endowed
it with another $100,000. . . .
Mrs. Stanford was a good woman
and a generous one. If Bhe seemed
at times to interfere somewhat
more than others thought she ought
with the teaching of the University
which the family had created, upon
the whole the good that she did
far outweighed such small hamper
ing. That she retained so admir
able a president as Dr. David Starr
Jordan, and gave him the leeway
he has enjoyed, is proof of this."

San Jose Stanford Club Resolutions.
"Seldom has death brought such
deep and widespread sorrow as it
has in the passing of Mr 9. Jane L.
Stanford. With bowed heads and
sorrowful hearts the world joins
with students and graduates of
Stanford in mourning their loss.
But while the world mourns her
loss, there are those whose feelings
are deeper than the world can
know. Though conscious of the
inadequacy of any expression that
we may make of our grief, we feel
that, as former students of Stan
ford, the ead death cannot pass
without an attempt to voice our
feelings and pay our tribute to our
benefactress.
"As an example of generous and
public spirited action, of noble and
self-sacrificing devotion to a great
ideal, the life of Mrs. Stanford ie
without a parallel. And in yeare
to come no woman will shine more
conspicuously in history than she.
The world owes her a debt, but not
as great as the debt we owe. The
world may appreciate and applaud
her generosity, but not with the
feeling that moves us. The world
may honor and respect her; but we,
who saw her in our midst, her great
sorrow equalled only by her fond
solicitude for us, â€”we love and
cherish her. The world may some
time pay a fitting tribute to her; it
may erect stately and imposing
monuments of solid granite, but the
most enduring monument will be
that builded in the hearts of those
who were privileged to know her, to
feel her kindly influence, and see
her life spent for the welfare of
others. Her example will ever be
a source of strength to our lives.
And as long as the pillars and
arches of the University stand by
the hills of Palo Alto, the pathos,
the tenderness, and the sweetness
of her life will affect and soften the
lives of others, and her devotion to
a great and noble purpose remain
an inspiration to future generations.
