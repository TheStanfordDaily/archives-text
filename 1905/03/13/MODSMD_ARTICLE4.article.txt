# Tennis Try-Out To-morrow.
## 
### 
If the weather permits, the try
out for the doubles tennis team
will be started on the Encina courts
to-morrow afternoon at 1:30. All
teams intending to enter must be
on the courts promptly at that
time, when the drawings will be
held. Should it be impossible for
the tournament to be held to-mor
row owing to the condition of the
courts, it will be run off on the
first afternoon after the courts be
come dry.
Arrangements have been com
pleted by the Tennis Club with
Joe Daily, the well-known profes
sional tennis player, by which the
latter will remain on the campus
during the next month and coach
the team. Daily will arrive here
to-morrow, and will start work as
soon as the team is definitely de
cided upon, which will probably be
done by the end of the present
week.
