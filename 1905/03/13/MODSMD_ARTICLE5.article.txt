# BISHOP NICHOLS PREACHES.
## "The University's Influence on One's Life-Work" Discussed in Memorial Church. 
### 
The Rt. Rev. William F.Nichols,
bishop of the Episcopal diocese of
Northern California, preached in
the Memorial Church yesterday
morning before a large congrega
tion. His subject was"The Influ
ence of the University upon the
After Life-Work." Bishop Nichols
said in part:
"One cannot well stand in this
place without a foreword of the
sense of somberness that pervades
this whole community, in the
death, so far from all that waß dear
to her here, of Mrs. Stanford. The
first voicing of it has already been
worthily made by my friend, the
preacher who occupied this pulpit
last Sunday. The stated memorial
service and tribute are yet to come.
Beyond this simple prefatory refer
ence, it is not my purpose to dwell
upon it. The theme which I have
chosen waß selected some weeks
ago in conversation with your
chaplain. And we do not forget
the anxious hours caused by the
bulletins from his sick-room during
the past week and the hope and the
prayer to-day —encouraged by less
unfavorable symptoms these more
recent days— that he may be spared
for many more yearß of his minis
try. The very last conversation I
was privileged to have with Mrs.
Stanford, it so happens, was some
three years ago at the very Moana
Hotel where she died; and it was
mainly touching Mr. Gardner,
whose effective work in the neighbor
ing parish had so appealed to her
that she had set her heart on hav
ing him for the chaplaincy.
"But to pass on to my subject.
I desire this morning, recognizing
as a background to all I may say
the divinity of Christ, to point the
analogy in the training of our
Lord and that of every young man
in His open-mindedness in youth,
Hiß careful routine of study, and
Hie resultant habit of ministering
unto others. Of the three, the
habit resulting from early training
ie by far the most worthy of serious
consideration, for it remains with
us throughout our lives. Habit is
not the result of any determination
of will, but it is a something which
growß on us gradually and natur
ally, and it is at the university
that the best habits are the most
easily and naturally acquired. As
I have said before, this habit re
mains with us through life and by
it our life-work is often determined.
But we must follow our own nat
ural bent if we would do the best
that is in our power to do. Look
at the great figures of the history
of our own country, or, to bring the
comparison nearer home, consider
the life and works of Mrs. Stanford,
who through a thousand trials and,
vicissitudes fought for the success]
of this University, and in the endi
gained that for which she strove.
"The call of God is a true call to (
any man who does his best, no
matter what his life-work may be. 1
But consider the fate of the un- (
happy individual who finds when
well on in life that he has made a
mistake in his choice of a calling.

iTake some fixed purpose and cen
ter upon it all your best efforts,
that in the end you may become
one of the bleesed who minister
and are not ministered unto."
