# REMAINS START WEDNESDAY.
## Body of Mrs. Stanford Will Reach San Francisco a Week from Tuesday. 
### 
The remains of Mrs. Stanford
will be brought from Honolulu on
the steamship Alameda, which
leaves for San Francisco at nine
o'clock Wednesday morning. The
mail-room of the steamer has been
draped for the reception of the re
mains. President Jordan and
Timothy Hopkins will accompany
the body.
Services will be held in the Con
gregational Central Union Church
in Honolulu at 8 o'clock Wednes
day morning, before the departure
of the steamer. The service will be
read by Right Rev. Henry Bond
Restarick, Episcopal Bishop of Ha
waii. Rev, William M. Kincaid
will deliver the address. Dr. Jor
dan will not speak at the services
in Honolulu. The pall-bearers will
be President Jordan, Timothy
Hopkins, Governor Carter, United
States District Judge Dole, Repre
sentative Carl Smith, '93, Abra
ham Lewis, Jr., '95, Charles S. Dole,
'99, and D. L. Van Dine, ex-'OO.
The Alameda is due to arrive in
San Francisco on Tuesday, March
21st. Through Collector of Cus
toms Stratton, arrangements have
been made to have the body trans
ferred from the steamer to a reve
nue cutter and brought to shore at
once, thus avoiding delay necessi
tated by placing the Alameda in
quarantine. Immediately upon
the arrival of the steamer in San
Francisco University exercises will
be suspended for the rest of the
week. The date of the funeral will
be announced to-morrow. It is not
likely that the services will be held
before Friday or Saturday.
The body will be taken to the
California street residence in San
Francisco. Further than this no
definite details have been ar
ranged.
The alumni and students of the
University expressed a desire to
meet the incoming boat at the
wharf and escort the remains to
the University. This plan has
been abandoned, since it is defi
nitely known that the remains will
not at once be brought to the Uni
versity.
