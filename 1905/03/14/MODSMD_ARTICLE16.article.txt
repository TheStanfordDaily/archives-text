It would be cause for regret if
the regatta between California and
Stanford should be declared off be
cause of inability to agree upon a
course. The question has reached
that point at which one side or the
other must change its decision or
the proposed contest must be
abandoned. The failure to reach
an agreement seems to be caused
by the fact that the two sides are
looking at the question from differ
ent viewpoints. Stanford wants a
course where the conditions will
favor neither one side nor the
other, where the best race can be
had; while California wants a
course where spectators can see the
race most conveniently and where
the most money can be made.
Looking at the matter from the
latter standpoint, it cannot be de
nied that the advantages of the
estuary are great, because a train
can run the full length of the
course beside the racing boats.
The conveniences of travel are per
haps greater in every way. But
the race is not rowed for the benefit
of the spectators alone, nor for the
profit of the athletic treasury. It
is a race for the race itself, and if
the result is to mean anything, the
conditions must be such that neith
er side will have any natural ad
vantage. It is not denied that the
water conditions are not ideal, as
was well illustrated last year. The
California crews have every op
portunity to become entirely fa
miliar with the winds, waves and
tides of the estuary; Stanford has
not. If we agreed again to row
upon the estuary, there is no reason
to expect that we would fare any
better than we did last year, when
our boats were practically swamped.
Unless California has objections to
the course itself at Stockton, it is
hard to justify her position. The
people of Stockton have made such

generous offers that it iB evident
there is considerable interest in
rowing there, insuring fair profits
at least. They have offered to build
bleachers and to turn over the en
tire gate receipts to the universities,!
and they have in addition offered
a very handsome trophy. What
ever the outcome of the negotia
tions, the Stanford manager may
feel that he has the fullest backing
of the students. We will be disap
pointed if we cannot have a race;
but, primarily, we want a contest
that will be a true test of the rela
tive merits of the crews.
