### 
The Harvard athletic committee!
has issued the following statement!
in regard to the appointment ofi
W. T. Reid, Jr., as football coach: j
"At the meeting of the athletic
committee on February 17th, the
proposition to engage Mr. Reid as
football coach for next year came
up for discussion. The committee
felt that although they were desir
ous of obtaining Mr. Reid's service*
they were not willing to pay a
coach a salary higher than that
received by a professor in the uni
versity. It was accordingly voted
to offer him $3,500. However, a6
this sum would not defray the ex
traordinary expenses incurred by
him, the committee decided that if
the graduates should choose to
make good his losses they would
not oppose such action."

committee removes all doubt as to
