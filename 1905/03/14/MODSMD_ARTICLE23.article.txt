# CO-EDUCATION AT STANFORD.

### 
Views of the Dead Founder of the!
University upon the Pres
ence of Women.
So much has been said and writ-I
ten about co-education at Stanford!
University that the views of Mrs.jj
Stanford upon that subject are in-J
teresting at the present time. Thesel
views were given in a statement!
published in 1901, when her de-j
cision to enforce the limit of 500i
upon the number of women stu-l
dentB was under criticism. The!
extract is made from a newspaper!
and may not be absolutely accur-j
ate, but it*is sufficiently so to make!
it of value. The statement follows:
"It is strange that so many peo
ple misunderstand my attitude to
ward the education of women.
Ever since my decision of about!
two years ago not to admit more
than 500 women as students at
Stanford I have been flooded with
correspondence concerning my rea
sons for taking that stand.
"I favor the education of women J
believe in co-education, and, in fact,|
believe fully in the right of women!
to have the franchise. Long before
my husband died we both were'
heartily in accord on the question
of woman's suffrage. In order to
emphasize the fact that I am not]
opposed to women having the full
and complete advantages of an edu
cation,! can say what is known only
to a few of my intimate friends,
that I suggested to Senator Stan
ford that women students be al
lowed in the University. This was
before our University scheme be
came known to the public. He had
thought of the same subject himself
and we both then and there agreed
that there should be women stu
dents in the institution.
"At the same time, however, Mr.
Stanford desired that it should be
primarily a man's school. In de
ciding to admit women neither he
nor I could foresee that a time would
come that the women might exceed
the men at the University, thereby
changing the original object of its
founding. Had Mr. Stanford
thought such a thing possible he
would have made provision against
it by limiting the number of women
students just as I have done.
"My only reason, therefore, in
stipulating that not more than 500
women can be students in the Uni
versity at anyone time was simply
to carry out faithfully my late hus
band's ideas and purposes in found
ing the seat of learning. It must
not change its character as primar
ily an institution for young men.
"Nobody appreciates more than I
do the advantages of an education
to those of my own sex. Nor does
anybody realize more than I do the
effect on society of an educated and
enlightened womanhood. A woman
can be educated and even vote, if
you please, and still be a womanly
woman.
"I speak as I do not because my
critics have been sharp and severe.
Most of the communications ex
press surprise that I should have
taken the stand that I did. I can
not answer all the letters I am in
receipt of constantly, and hope the
brief statement will suffice for all."
