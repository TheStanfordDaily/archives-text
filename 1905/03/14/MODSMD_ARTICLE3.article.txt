# Basket-ball Plans Changed.
## 
### 
The plana of the basket-ball
squad for the spring games have
undergone complete change and re
vision since the news of Mrs. Stan
ford's death was received. Al
though the team, under the direc
tion of Coach Cahoon, maintains
its regular practice three afternoons
a week, the canceling of the pre
paratory games is keenly felt.
From present indications, the team
will go into the game with Califor
nia without further preliminary
matches save those with the second
team. If it can be arranged, the
game with Mills College, which
was scheduled for last Saturday,
will be played the morning of the
intercollegiate field meet with
Berkeley, and the game with the
California women will be held a
week later. The Stanford mana
ger is endeavoring to secure the
consent of the Berkeley team for a
game the first week in May, this,
game to be the second of the series.
California objects to this on the!
ground that the final examinations
at that place begin the first of May
and thus render the game practi
cally impossible. Unles* this can
be decided upon satisfactorily, there
will be but one game to decide the
winner, instead of two, as formerly
planned.
