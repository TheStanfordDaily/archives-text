A month ago the Stanford
Alumnus suggested the establish
ment of a cut repository in the
Stanford University Library. It
was the idea of the Aluvmus that
in this repository might be placed
all the half-tone illustrations
which have been used during the
past few years in the Quads and
other Stanford publications, which
under the present lack of any sys
tem are becoming scattered and
lost. The emergency that has
fallen upon the University during
the past two weeks has shown very
plainly the benefits of such a plan.
In recent years many cuts have
been printed in the Quads which
would be especially appropriate
and interesting for use at the pres
ent time, when the University is
passing through the saddest period
in its history. Excellent pictures
of the exterior and interior of the
church, of the mausoleum, and of
other buildings and persons have
been used which would aid greatly
now in the preparation of the me
morial editions of the Daily Palo
Alto, adding much to their inter
est and attractiveness. This is but
a single illustration of the many
uses to which such a collection
might be put. There is no great
obstacle to the carrying out of such
a plan, nor is any great expense
involved. The business managers
of two Quads have expressed their
willingness to turn over to the Li
brary all the cuts remaining in
their possession, and undoubtedly
others can be collected elsewhere
with small effort. Nominal charges
for the use of the cuts would more
than repay the cost of their keep
ing. Such an undertaking might

be considered a little foreign to the
purpose of the Library, but the
Library is the one permanent or
ganization that could successfully
carry out the plan.
