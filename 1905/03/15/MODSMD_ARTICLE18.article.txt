â€”The student body of Columbia
University is much wrought up
over the production of a play in
New York City entitled ''Strong
heart," depicting the life of that
university and containing several
allusions which the undergradu
ates resent as slurs on their univer
sity. They are further incensed
because the writer of the play is a
graduate of Columbia.
