# RHODES SCHOLARS AT OXFORD.
## Englishmen Are Surprised to Find the Americans Much Like Themselves. 
### 
Last September thirty-three Am
erican students set sail for Liver
pool en route for Oxford. lhey
were the advance guard of the
ninety-six scholars who will ulti
mately go to the great English
university from this country on
the Cecil Rhodes foundation.
Stanley K. Hornbeck, Rhodes
scholar from Colorado, tells the
first impressions of the American
invaders in the Booklover's Maga
zine. That staid, conservative old
Oxford received a Bhock when the
scholars paraded "The High" in
Western headgear is evident from
Hornbeck's remark that "one of
the latest hits in 'The Earl and
the Girl' runs something like this:
'If I only had a hat like a Rhodes
scholar, I know I'd be happy for
life.'"
The American attitude for ask
ing questions "startled the Dons,
and the number of councils which
the authorities in one certain col
lege held on one certain day must
have made them think they were
truly entering on 'the strenuous
life.'" Hornbeck sayß that the
first impressions have been favor
able on both sides.
The London Telegraph says:"The
ordinary undergraduate is a little
astonished to find that the scholars
are much like other freshmen, in
stead of being distinguished, as he
hoped, by the strangeness of their
attire, the unconventionality of
their manners, and a profusion of
hirsute adornment in the shape of
beards. It would have added much
to the pictureBquenees of Oxford if
these Parthians, Medes and Ela
mites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia
had arrived, let us say, like red
Indians or Basutos or fiat-footed
Hollanders. Doubtless! It is said
that the German is, in his turn,
surprised to find the Englishman
no such barbarian as his Teutonic
imagination had pictured him."
The general opinion expressed in
England is in the nature of a hope
"that the Rhodes scholar may
have a broadening influence on
Oxford."
"The English undegraduate,"
says Hornbeck, "has some distin
guishing characteristics, but after
all he is not so very different from
the undergraduates we have
known. A Canadian, just 'up,'
spoke of hi n as 'more polished,
with fewer corners.' 1 am not at
all Rure of that. He certainly does
possess an easy refinement; but I
am inclined to believe it apparent
through his quiet, time-taking
speech and his aversion to hurry.
This, too, makes 'corners' less ap
parent. There is a certain lack of
enthusiasm, or at least of expressed
enthusiasm.
"Further, I think one does not

find the many individual typesj
the aggressive spirit of push and (
pull —'If you can't climb over, go
through' —in short, the assertivej
spirit which is dominant among!
American college men. An Eng-j
lishman said of this: 'Our public
schools do not encourage individu
ality. Our universities absolutely
discourage it.'
"Hospitable he certainly is, full
of good fellow-feeling—all in aj
quiet, undemonstrative way. His
cordiality is frank, honest, without
fuss. The American, especially the
Westerner, misses the hearty,'
whole-souled handshake to whichj
he is used —he finds only a conven
tional grasp or a formal bow; but
he is sure, none the less, of the sin
cerity of the greeting. Again, he
notices the infrequency of chance
acquaintance. An introduction or
a call is needed before he knows
the man he passes day by day
upon the stairs."
