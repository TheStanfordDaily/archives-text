# POLICY OF THE UNIVERSITY.
## Statement Made by the Trustees to Mrs. Stanford Two Years Ago. 
### 
Two years ago Mrs. Stanford!
turned over to the Board of Trus-|
tees of the University full control!
of the institution which she had!
helped to found and whose devel |
opment she had fostered so care
fully. The Trustees, in accepting
the responsibility imposed upon
them, presented to Mrs. Stanford
the following address, in which
they definitely outlined the general
policy to be followed in the futuri|
conduct of the University:
"The time having arrived when!
the Trustees are to assume, at youij
request, the active care of the Uni-|
versity, and to lift from yourg
shoulders the burden you have!
carried for so many years, we del
sire to express to you how fully wel
realize and appreciate the zeal youl
have felt, the sacrifices you have!
made, the prudence and wisdoml
you have brought to bear on its!
management.
"Since your husband's death youl
have directed its affairs and shaped!
its policy. In itshour of special trial,!
when its work was crippled by legal!
and financial difficulties, we re-l
member that you courageously camel
to the rescue and maintained the!
University for a considerable periodl
by personal sacrifices.
"You have superintended the!
erection of its beautiful scheme of!
buildings as adopted by the found-!
ers, and for ten years have super
vised the establishment of its aca
demic policy. Our work is made
easy by the foundations which you
have laid, and it remains for us to
carry out your wise policy and the
fundamental principles marked out
in the founding grant, the letter ac-l
companying it, and in your various!
addresses to the Trustees.
"You have provided that: 'The!
University must be forever main-l
tained upon a strictly non-partisan!
and non-sectarian basis. It must
never become an instrument in the
hands of any political party or any
religious sect or organization.' The
fundamental principle of religion
must always be taught there, butS
without the limitations of any sec
tarian or denominational bias, and
no profession of religious faith or
belief shall be exacted of any one.
You have provided that the Uni
versity must be forever kept out of
politics, and that no person con
nected with it shall use its name or
influence for the furtherance of any
partisan purposes.
"The University has been brought
into touch and harmony with the
free public school system, and has
been given an unprecedented en
dowment to enable it to offer
instruction so nearly free 'that it
may resist the tendency to the
stratification of society by keeping
open an avenue whereby the deserv
ing and exceptional may rise
through their own efforts from the
lowest to the highest stations in
life.' A spirit of equality must
pervade the institution,that it may
be agreeable as well as accessible to
rich and poor alike.
"You desire that the University
shall 'qualify students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life,'
and you wish them to understand
that its generous opportunities are
offered in the hope and trust that
when the graduates go out into the
world they will thereby become of
greater Bervice to the public, for the

University was founded for the bet
terment of mankind.
"While its chief object is the in
struction of students 'with a view
to producing leaders and educators
in every field of science and indus
try,' you have also provided that it
should assist in the advancement
of useful knowledge.
"We recognize the wisdom of this
charter of principles, and most fully
approve of every part thereof, and
we will carry out the policy you have
initiated. So far as in us lies we
hope to realize the purposes of the
founders as stated in their letter
accompanying the founding grant:
"'The object is not alone to give
the student a technical education,
fitting him for a successful business
life, but it is also to instill into the
mind an appreciation of the bless
ings of this government, a reverence
for its institutions, and a love of
God and humanity, to the end that
he may go forth and by precept and
example spread the great truths by
the light of which his fellow men
will be elevated and taught how to
obtain happiness in this world and
in the life eternal.'
"In assuming our new duties we
pray that your life may be spared
for many years to assist us and co
operate in this good work.

Two years ago Mrs. Stanford!
turned over to the Board of Trus-|
tees of the University full control!
of the institution which she had!
helped to found and whose devel |
opment she had fostered so care
fully. The Trustees, in accepting
the responsibility imposed upon
them, presented to Mrs. Stanford
the following address, in which
they definitely outlined the general
policy to be followed in the futuri|
conduct of the University:
"The time having arrived when!
the Trustees are to assume, at youij
request, the active care of the Uni-|
versity, and to lift from yourg
shoulders the burden you have!
carried for so many years, we del
sire to express to you how fully wel
realize and appreciate the zeal youl
have felt, the sacrifices you have!
made, the prudence and wisdoml
you have brought to bear on its!
management.
"Since your husband's death youl
have directed its affairs and shaped!
its policy. In itshour of special trial,!
when its work was crippled by legal!
and financial difficulties, we re-l
member that you courageously camel
to the rescue and maintained the!
University for a considerable periodl
by personal sacrifices.
"You have superintended the!
erection of its beautiful scheme of!
buildings as adopted by the found-!
ers, and for ten years have super
vised the establishment of its aca
demic policy. Our work is made
easy by the foundations which you
have laid, and it remains for us to
carry out your wise policy and the
fundamental principles marked out
in the founding grant, the letter ac-l
companying it, and in your various!
addresses to the Trustees.
"You have provided that: 'The!
University must be forever main-l
tained upon a strictly non-partisan!
and non-sectarian basis. It must
never become an instrument in the
hands of any political party or any
religious sect or organization.' The
fundamental principle of religion
must always be taught there, butS
without the limitations of any sec
tarian or denominational bias, and
no profession of religious faith or
belief shall be exacted of any one.
You have provided that the Uni
versity must be forever kept out of
politics, and that no person con
nected with it shall use its name or
influence for the furtherance of any
partisan purposes.
"The University has been brought
into touch and harmony with the
free public school system, and has
been given an unprecedented en
dowment to enable it to offer
instruction so nearly free 'that it
may resist the tendency to the
stratification of society by keeping
open an avenue whereby the deserv
ing and exceptional may rise
through their own efforts from the
lowest to the highest stations in
life.' A spirit of equality must
pervade the institution,that it may
be agreeable as well as accessible to
rich and poor alike.
"You desire that the University
shall 'qualify students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life,'
and you wish them to understand
that its generous opportunities are
offered in the hope and trust that
when the graduates go out into the
world they will thereby become of
greater Bervice to the public, for the

University was founded for the bet
terment of mankind.
"While its chief object is the in
struction of students 'with a view
to producing leaders and educators
in every field of science and indus
try,' you have also provided that it
should assist in the advancement
of useful knowledge.
"We recognize the wisdom of this
charter of principles, and most fully
approve of every part thereof, and
we will carry out the policy you have
initiated. So far as in us lies we
hope to realize the purposes of the
founders as stated in their letter
accompanying the founding grant:
"'The object is not alone to give
the student a technical education,
fitting him for a successful business
life, but it is also to instill into the
mind an appreciation of the bless
ings of this government, a reverence
for its institutions, and a love of
God and humanity, to the end that
he may go forth and by precept and
example spread the great truths by
the light of which his fellow men
will be elevated and taught how to
obtain happiness in this world and
in the life eternal.'
"In assuming our new duties we
pray that your life may be spared
for many years to assist us and co
operate in this good work.
