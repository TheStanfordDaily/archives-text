# CALIFORNIA'S COACH HERE.
## Garnett Conferring: with Stanford Boating People Regarding the Regatta. 
### 
Coach Garnett of the University,
of California boating squad was on]
the campus to-day endeavoring to
persuade the boating management
to consent to holding the intercol
legiate regatta on the Oakland
estuary. In an interview with Dr.
F. Angell, treasurer of the Boat'
Club, Garnett said that he conßid-j
ered the estuary an excellent place
for holding the intercollegiate re-J
gatta. One reason given was that in
the morning the proposed course
is nearly always calm, and hence
would be favorable to both crews.
Another argument, and the one
upon which most stress was laid,
was that if the regatta were held at
Oakland the financial returns
would be larger than if held at
Stockton.
In answering this argument Dr.
Angell said that Stanford's idea in
holding the contest is not to make
money, but for the sake of the
sport only. Dr. Angell expressed
himself as against the estuary as
the intercollegiate course, but in
favor of the one at Stockton.
