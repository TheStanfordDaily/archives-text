# HODGE SUSTAINS INJURY.
## Stanford's Chances in Tennis Lessened by Injury to Crack Varsity Player. 
### 
Stanford's prospect√ü in the com
ing intercollegiate tennis match re
ceived a Bevere blow yesterday in
an injury to Tennis Captain G. A.
Hodge, '06, which, if it does not
actually prevent him from partici-

pating in the match next months
will at all events greatly interfere
with the preliminary practice that!
has been planned for the team.
The injury consists of the tearing]
of a muscle in the upper part of,
the abdomen, and was received by
Hodge while playing in the finals,
of the doubles tournament last'
Tuesday.
Dr. R. L. Wilbur, who examined
the injury yesterday afternoon,!
stated that while the break was 1
not of a particularly dangerous
character, it would prevent Hodge ;
from taking any exercise whatever
for a week or ten days. How soon
he will be able to resu ue practice
will have to be determined later by!
the quickness with which thei
wound heals. As the date of the (
intercollegiate match is only four,
weeks off, it will be almost impos
sible for Hodge to get back into
condition to play his best game.'
There will also be considerable
danger of the break reopening if it
is not given ample time to heal.
Hodge was to have been thel
mainstay of the team this year,]
and it is almost certain that if he
could have been in condition to'
play his best game in the match,
Stanford would have at least scored
one point in the singles.
This is the third year that
Hodge has succeeded in making
the Varsity tennis team, both in
singles and doubles, and the sec-|
ond time that he has been inca-j
pacitated before the intercollegiate
match. In his Freshman year he
contracted typhoid fever only a
few days before the event was
played.
