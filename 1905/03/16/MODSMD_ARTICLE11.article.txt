Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In response to. the editorial
which appeared in the Daily PaLo
ALto of March 15th, I wish to say
that the Library is in entire accord
with the idea of collecting and pre
serving among its archives plates
and cuts relating to the University.
I have already expressed to the
editor of the Alumnus our willing
ness to co-operate in such a scheme,
and our thanks are due both pub
lications for bringing the matter
before the alumni, students, and
others who may be able to deposit
in the Library this kind of mate
rial. I know of other libraries in
which are deposited by student
publications all cuts as soon as
their first purpose has been served,
and later these cuts have been
found to be of great value. The
nucleus of such a collection is al
ready in the Library, and to it a
few cuts have lately been added.
In this connection I wish to say
that photographs of the quad and
campus as they appeared in the
pioneer days, as well as any made
at the present time, are also desired.
This matter of preserving material
of a historical nature is one in
which we may all help, and the
Library is more than willing to
act as the depository.
Melvin G. Dodge,
Associate Librarian.
