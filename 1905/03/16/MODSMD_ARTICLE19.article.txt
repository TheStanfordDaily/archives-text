# BASEBALL SUITS GIVEN OUT
## Eleven of the Most Promising Men Receive their Uniforms. 
### 
Baseball suits have been given
out to eleven men who are the
most likely to play in the intercol
legiate series. Suits were given to
Sales, Stott, Presley, Bell, Trow
bridge and Fenton, who will in all
probability fill the infield positions;
and to Chalmers, Colbert, Cad
walader, Dudley and Lewie, who
are the most promising candidates
for the outfield.
Coach Cowden stated that the
personnel of the team has not been
decided upon, but it seems likely
that the places on the team will be
filled by these men. The suits are
grey in color, similar to those of
last year, but have no letter upon
them.
Since the news of Mrs. Stanford's
death reached the campus, no base;
ball games have been played on
the local diamond, but practice
has gone on steadily. The nine
has been seriously handicapped by
being unable to play many of the
scheduled games. During the lat
ter part of February the team was
rounding into form and playing
high-class ball. Especially in the
game with the Independents the
Varsity hit well. So far this month
the team has played two games, the
first at Santa Clara against Santa
Clara College, which resulted in a
crushing defeat; and the second
against St. Mary's College in San
Francisco, which was lost on a
questionable decision.
In the game with Santa Clara,
Stanford played as poorly as she
did at the first of the season, and
less than a week later the Varsity
played almost perfect ball against
the St. Mary's nine. This sudden
change in form is unaccountable.
With the team playing inconsistent
ball in this manner, the first inter
collegiate game is little more than
two weeks off.
