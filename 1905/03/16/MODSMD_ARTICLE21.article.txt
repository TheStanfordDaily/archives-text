# McCarthy to Coach California.
## 
### 
Jack McCarthy, the professional
coach who handled California's
baseball team last year, has been
selected to take the place of "Nick"
Williams, who leaves for Seattle to
assume his position in the Coast
League. This change of coaches so
late in the season, it is thought,
will not affect the team, as both
coaches have kept close track of
the team throughout the present
season.
