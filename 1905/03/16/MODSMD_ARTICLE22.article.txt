# To Build Field for Women.
## 
### 
A movement is on foot to build
an athletic field for the women of
the University. The Board of
Trustees has already been asked to
consider the proposal of building a
separate field, but as yet no action
has been taken. It is proposed to
set aside space in the vicinity of
Roble Hall where grounds may be
arranged. The present arrange
ments for girls' athletics are not
adequate to meet their needs, and
the location of the grounds is too
prominent. It is thought that if
an appropriation for private
enclosed grounds can be secured
the interest in athletics among the
women will be greatly increased.
