# LANAGAN ON TRACK AGAIN
## Crack Hurdler Resumes His Work at Stanford.—Rain Makes Conditions Bad. 
### 
\V. H. Lanagan, '05, who took
first place in both of the hurdle
eventß in the annual intercollegiate
field-day last year, appeared on the
track for the first time this season
yesterday. During his absence from
college Lanagan has kept in form
by cross-country runs and work on
a short hurdle course which he con
structed for himself. Until the last
week the crack hurdler has been in
fine physical condition, but just at
present he is suffering from a slight
attack of malaria.
The continued rainy weather is
interfering materially with the
work of the track candidates. The
runway for the broad jump drains
well and is always in fair shape,
but the runways for the other
jumps are so slippery that it is im
possible for the athletes to do their
best work in the high jump and
pole-vault. A narrow strip near
the pole is the only portion of the
track that can be used to advan
age. Trainer Moulton had planned
to have the hurdle candidates run
the full distances in these events
several times this week, but the wet
condition of the track has prevented
this.
As only a small portion of the
track can be used, it is impossible
to run races, and the only practice
the men get is in the single trials,
which are held frequently. The
fact that only one meet will be
held before the intercollegiate field
day makes it vitally necessary that
the men should gain experience in
actual races, and a large number of
contests between candidates for the
same track events will be held as
soon as the track is again in shape.
