# QUESTION STILL UNSETTLED.
## No Agreement Yet Reached Between Boating Representatives of the Universities. 
### 
Where the intercollegiate regatta
will be held is still an open ques
tion, and there is still a possibility
that the contest will not take place.
Coach Garnett of the California
oarsmen during his visit here yes
terday talked to all of the boating
officials and sought to induce them
to accept the Oakland estuary as
the intercollegiate course. The
Stanford officials were firm in their
decision not to row at Oakland.
They declared that unless some
other course than the estuary could
be decided upon, there would be no
contest.
In talking with the Stanford
men last night Garnett favored
Oakland because of its convenient
location and the resulting increase
of financial returns. Another im
portant point he made was that by
having the contest at Oakland, it
would draw a larger college aud
ience than if held at any other
place. This, he claimed, would
develop college interest in boating
and materially aid in establishing
the sport on a firm basis, at the
same time tending to increase col
lege spirit. The local boating men
considered this argument out
weighed by the fact that at Oak
land the conditions generally were
unfavorable, and one crew would
have to row under especially bad
conditions.
Dr. Angell informed Garnett
that Stanford would not under any
circumstances accept California's
proposition that Stanford should
be allowed her choice of position
if the race took place at the estu
ary. Stanford, Dr. Angell said,
preferred to enter the race on terms
of perfect equality.

tion, and there is still a possibility
