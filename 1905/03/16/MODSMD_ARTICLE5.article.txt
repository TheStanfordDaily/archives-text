Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The statement in last night's
Daily Palo Alto in regard to Dr.
Garnett hardly gives a correct idea
of his position. The chief argu
ment advanced by Dr. Garnett in
favor of holding the boat race on
the Oakland estuary was that the
event would attract a large num
ber of people and so give consider
able impetus to collegiate boating
and to the development |of univer
sity spirit. As regards the matter
of tides and currents in the estu
ary, Dr. Garnett offered to give the
Stanford crew choice of positions.
Dr. Garnett seemed to me so
wholly sincere in his advocacy of
measures that he considered neces
sary for the development of boat
ing, and so desirous of being fair to
Stanford, that I told him if he suc
ceeded in converting the boating
men to his way of thinking, I
would place no obstacles in his
path. Frank Angell.
