The conduct of many of the men
who attend some of the larger
classes in the chapel has become
such that it calls for some public
censure. This morning one of the
oldest and most respected members
of the faculty was compelled to stop
lecturing to demand the cessation
of disagreeable noises toward the
back of the chapel, a demand to
which he added the explanation
that this was but the second time
in his career in this University that
he had been compelled to make
such a request. It is a notorious
fact, however, that a number of men
in these large classes are availing
themselves of the safety afforded
by their numbers to make things
disagreeable for the lecturer. This
is a practice that ought to be
stopped. Whether a lecturer be
good or bad, whether his methods
be unusual or unpopular, it is but
a poor way to show disapproval by
the dragging of feet, the snapping
of watches, and other similar de
vices. The rules of personal court
esy that govern Stanford men do
not sanction methods of this kind,
nor have such tactics been notice
ably present in this University in
past years. Those who feel that
they receive no good from attend
ing the lectures could drop out with
profit to themselves and to those
who choose to remain; but if they
continue to attend the classes, theyi
should conduct themselves as gen
tlemen.
