# TRYING TO SETTLE DISPUTE.
## Coach Garnett of California Says He Hopes to See Intercollegiate Regatta. 
### 
Whether or not there will be an
intercollegiate boating regatta will
be decided on or before next Mon
day, by which time the California
boating men have agreed to make
known their answer to the condi
tions required by the local boating
officials. California's coach. E. M.
Garnett, while on the campus, said
he regretted that Stanford could
not see her way clear to accept the
Oakland estuary as the intercol
legiate course, but since this seemed
out of the question, he would do
all in his power to settle the dis
pute. Before leaving the campus
lie expressed the opinion that the
trouble would be adjusted satisfac
torily.
Definite arrangements have been
made with the University of Wash
ington for a race to be rowed here
about April 25th. Washington
has left Stanford to choose the
course over which the race will be
rowed, and at present the two best
places which present themselves
are those at Stockton and Redwood
City. It has not been finally de
cided yet whether there will be
both varsity and freshman races,
or only the former.
In order to increase the interest
in boating at Stanford, the officials
in charge are considering the idea
of having interciass races. In case
the proposed races take place they
will probably be rowed at Red
wood City about April 22d. The
plan is to row the races in four
oared barges, and while Stanford
has but one, it is'probable that one
can be borrowed from California
for the occasion.
Active work in the new shell will
begin to-morrow at Redwood City.
The boat will be carried to Red
wood in the morning, and two
crews will be taken along at the
same time. The new boat-house is
completed and everything is in
readiness for regular practice.
There is little probability that the
Freshman candidates will use the
shell at present, because the Fresh
man race will be rowed in a barge,
necessitating practice in this kind
of a boat.
