# PREPARATIONS FOR SERVICES.
## Plans for the Funeral in Hands of Faculty Sub-Committee On Assemblies. 
### 
On account of the large number
of organizations which will be rep
resented at the funeral services of
Mrs. Stanford on Friday afternoon,
it was found impossible by the
committee to make allotments and
announcements for seats in the
Memorial Church to-day. It will
be a difficult task to seat the large
number of outsiders who expect to
attend the services, so that it will
be practically impossible to an
nounce definitely until a fair idea
of the number of representatives
can be ascertained.
The committee is conferring with
the different organizations on the
campus and trying to arrange the
seating of trustees, faculty, alumni,
students, employes and press in
the most satisfactory manner.
The services will be divided be
tween the Memorial Church and
the mausoleum. The preachers who
will speak either in the church or
at the mausoleum will probably be
announced on Monday.
Special policemen will be ap
pointed to avoid confusion on the
quadrangle and the line of march
of the procession. Newspaper pho
tographers will have ample space
allotted them, so that they may
take their stations and not inter
fere with the general movement.
The services at the mausoleum
will enable those who fail to pro
cure seats in the Memorial Church
to witness part of the ceremonies.
In view of the large number of peo
ple who will attend the services,
and the improbability of all secur
ing entrance to the church, the ser
vice has been divided between the
church and the mausoleum, so that
all may attend at least a part of
the ceremonies.
