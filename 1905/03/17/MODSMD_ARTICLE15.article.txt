The prompt and courteous reply
of the Librarian of the University
to the suggestion that a cut reposi
tory be established under his care
marks the beginning of a new era
in the history of the Stanford pub
lications. If the proposed arrange
ment becomes thoroughly effective,
Stanford will soon possess a collec
tion of useful cuts which will al
ways be at hand whenever they
are needed. Whenever an event
justifies the use of a cut in any of
the various college publications, it
will be possible to use an appropri
atejpicture, and thus to brighten
the appearance of the publication
and increase its interest. In the
form of cuts many pictures of the
University which have historical
value will also be preserved for use
in books and other general publi
cations dealing with Stanford. If
those who have such cuts in their
possession will turn them over to
the Library, there will be a large
collection to begin with, and as it
becomes the recognized custom to
add to it each year, it will success
fully meet the needs which have
called it forth.
