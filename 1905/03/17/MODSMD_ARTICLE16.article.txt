The news that the field meet
between Stanford and Pomona Col
lege will take place will be wel
comed. The result of such a con
test cannot be otherwise than bene
ficial to Stanford. Southern Cali
fornia is rapidly coming to the
front in track athletics. Especial
ly in the southern high schools this
branch of sport is becoming more
important. The meet with Po
mona, which has probably the
strongest team in the south, will
attract the attention of all the
athletes in the southern part of the
State, and will be one of the best
advertisements possible to Stan
ford. Such meets are sure to show
their effects in future registrations
here. Another point is that a
meet of this nature, where the com

petition is sure to be spirited and
close, will undoudtedly aid the
Cardinal in its contest with Cali
fornia. The men will be benefited
by the experience. The track men,
too, deserve such a trip as reward
for their hard work. The work on
the track, especially this year, ha 6
been with very little encourage
ment from the bleachers. Because
of the fact that many meets had
to be canceled, the work has been
even more of a "grind" this year
than usual. Such a trip is an in
centive to the candidates, and will
be merited by those selected for the
trip.
