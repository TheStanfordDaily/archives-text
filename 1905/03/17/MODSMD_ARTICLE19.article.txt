# SANTA CLARA DEFEATED.
## Sales Pitches Strong Game and Stanford Wins Contest in the Ninth. 
### 
Stanford won its first victory
over the nine from Santa Clara 1
College yesterday afternoon at:
Cyclers' Park, in San Jose. After!
a close contest up to the last inning,!
Stanford finally took the lead and!
won the game 4 to 1. Sales pitched
in his best form, and to this factj
the victory was largely due. Of;
the four hits that he allowed dur
ing the game, only one resulted in
a run. Feeney reached first on a
hit to short, was passed to second
on a poor throw, and scored on
Collins' drive over second base,
which was Santa Clara's only clean
hit of the day.
With the score of one run in
their favor, Santa Clara kept this
lead up to the sixth inning, when
Stanford tied the score. Fenton,
who had reached first on an error,
was brought home by a two-bagger
by Sales.
Both teams were unable to get
the winning run across the plate
in the seventh or eighth. In the
ninth, however, Stanford scored
three times. These runs were the
result of Sales being hit by the
pitcher, a hit, and poor fielding by
Santa Clara. In the last half of
the ninth the Varsity kept their
opponents from scoring.
Sales allowed four hits and three
bases on balls, and struck out nine
men; while Boyle was hit safely
seven times, walked three, and
struck out eight.
California played Santa Clara at
Cyclers' Park this afternoon, and
the Stanford team went down to
see the Blue and Gold men work.
To-morrow Stanford will go to San
Francisco, where they will play the-
Pensacola team at the Presidio.
The box score for the game with
Santa Clara is the one made out by
the Santa Clara officials, and differs
in some respects from the results
recorded by the Stanford scorer.
