# [TO CHOOSE DEBATING TEAMS.
## Final Try-out for Intercollegiate and Nevada Representatives To-morrow Night. 
### 
The last debating try-out of the
year will be held in the chapel to
morrow night. At this contest two
teams will be chosen, one to meet
the University of California in San
Francisco on April 15th; the other
to debate with the University of
Nevada at Reno a week later. The
fact that it was decided early last
semester to have two teams repre
sent the University this year caus
ed an increased interest in debat
ing, and as a result a large number
of men tried out for the intercol
legiate trios. At the preliminary
try-out held several weeks ago, the
number of candidates was reduced
from twenty-one to six, and these
six will to-morrow night contest
with five others who have previous
ly served on varsity terms.
Two squads will speak on the
subject which California submitted
to Stanford as her choice for the
intercollegiate debate question:
"Resolved, That the Interstate
Commerce Commission shall be
given power to fix and enforce rail
road rates. Note A —lt is under
stood that the commission may be
enlarged and equipped so as to enable
it to meet new conditions. Note
B —The question of constitutional
ity to be disregarded."
Professors C. A. Duniway and
W. F. Durand and Instructor A.
M. Cathcart will act as judges.
Eight will be selected in the order
of their excellence, and the last two
will act as alternates. Speaking
will commence promptly at 7:30,
and the order will be as follows:
First squad—Affirmative, C. S.
Osgood, '06, P. D. Swing, '05, A.
M. Dibble, '05; negative, A. Sher
riffe, '08, B. C. Dey, '05.
Second squad —Affirmative,W.L.
Blair, '05, D. D. Sales, '06, A. R.
Fletcher, '05; negative, E. A. Cun
ha, '06, R. G. Barnett, '05, Miss M.
F. Balcomb, '06.
Nevada has already had one try
out for the selection of her team
and intends to hold two more be
fore she selects her representatives.
The Stanford team which meets
the Sagebrush university will thus
be much handicapped in prepara
tion, since as yet no work has been
done on the divorce question, but
all the men have studied the Cali
fornia question.
