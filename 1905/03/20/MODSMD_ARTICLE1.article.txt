						BODY OF MRS. STANFORD WILL REACH THE UNIVERSITY TO-MORROW.
## Committee Will Escort Remains from the Steamer to Campus Residence Without Ceremony. 
### 
THE steamer Alameda,
the body of Mrs. Stanford, isjj
expected to arrive at San Francisco!
to-morrow. The steamer will be!
met by a small party of gentlemen!
representing the family and the!
University. No details of arrange
ments for this particular matter
can be announced in advance,
since much will depend upon the
hour of the arrival of the steamer. 1
It is expected, however, that the.
casket will be escorted to the late (
residence of Mrs. Stanford on the
Palo Alto estate by a small funeral
party of the family, trustees, fac
ulty, alumni, and the Btudent body
of the University.
In addition to the personal rep-j
resentatives of the family and thej
Board of Trustees, the funeral party!
will consist of Professors StillmanJ
Murray, Abbott, Angell, Brannefi
Gilbert, Hoskins, C. D. Marx, San-s
ford, and Duniway,representing theS
faculty; George 12. Crothers, '95,1
Dr. H. B. Reynolds, '96, Charles RJ
Lewers, '96, and Charles M. Fick-j
ert, '98, representing the alumni; a
student committee composed of
C. E. Hyde, '05, W. H. B. Fowler,
'06, J. C. Macfarland,'o7, and C. CJ
McColloch,'oB; John D. McGilvrayJ
the contractor who has constructed
the University buildings, and C. E.
Hodges, the University architect.
Services in Memorial Church.
The remains will lie in the fam-l
ily residence until Friday morningfl
shortly before the hour for the*
funeral services in the Memorial!
Church. The services in the churchl
are to begin promptly at half pastl
one, and are to be concluded at the!
mausoleum. There will be anj
augmented student choir of eighty!
voices, and soloists.
Procession to the Mausoleum.
Following the services in the
church, there will be a procession
to the mausoleum for the final ex
ercises. This procession will be
made up of the student body, the
alumni, the faculty, the honorary
pall-bearers, the immediate pall
bearers, friends, employes, and
official representatives of a large
number of organizations.
The detail of organization of the
funeral procession is being worked
out by committees. The presidents
of the four classes have named the
following marshals to have charge
of their respective divisions:
1905
Thorpe, M H Favre, E B
Crawford, W E Hooper, A W
1906
Weinmann, L R Fleming, R D
Cunha, E A Hadley, C M
1907
Weller, M J Everson, F L
Laumeister, C F Peterson, II
1908
Pemberton, J R McColloch, C C
Hodge, R E Abbott, F H
Similar appointments may be

expected for the supervision of
other divisions.
Difficult Seating Problem.
The problem of providing ac
commodations in the Memorial
Church for the great number of
persons who wish to attend the
services presents very serious diffi
culties. The committee finds it
necessary to limit strictly the
reservations in various sections of
the church. It has been found
possible to provide for the entire
student body in the two galleries
and in the organ loft. One lower
transept will be available for the
general public. The rest of the
church will be reserved in sections
for pall-bearers, trustees, faculty,
alumni, employes, and official
representatives of organizations.
In this connection it should be
said that all organizations desiring
to secure seats in the church and
their representatives should notify
Professor C. A. Duniway through
the office of the President of the
University before the day of the
funeral. Due announcement will
be made about the entrances to be
used for each reserved section. The
ushering will be taken care of by a
large committee of students, organ
ized by Assistant Registrar J. E.
McDowell. Their names are as
follows:

gFinal Services in Open Air.
I Th& final services will be held in

front of the mausoleum in the open
air, where an unrestricted assem
blage can see and hear, so that
persons unable to obtain admission
to the church may nevertheless
have a part in the funeral services.
Later statements will give exact
