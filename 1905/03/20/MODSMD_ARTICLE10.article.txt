# Chaplain Gardner Better.
## 
### 
The condition of Rev. D. Charles
Gardner still continues to improve.
His temperature has been normal
for the past four days and he is no
longer delirious. He is taking
nourishment regularly. In spite
of this marked advance in Mr.
Gardner's condition, it has not
yet been considered advisable to
inform him of Mrs. Stanford's
death.
