# REV. E.R. DILLE PREACHES.
## Eminent Clergyman Pays Tribute to Life and Work of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
The Memorial Church services
yesterday morning were conducted'
by Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille, pastor ofi
the First Methodist Church of Oak
land. As a subject for his sermon
Dr. Dille chose ''The Earthly Im
mortality." He said, in part:
"We are none of us content with
our own individual sphere. We
desire to be known and felt outside
of our community, and perhaps in
after times. Now this universal
desire to be remembered is recog
nized and appealed to in the
Scriptures as a motive to right liv
ing. Humanity needs to cherish
the memory of its illustrious men!
and to make their examples a parti
of the patrimony of succeeding!
generations. It is for this that we
rear our monuments to the mem
ory of bygone heroes.
"The revelation of our glorious
future life meets one part of this
desire of ours for the extension of
our being. But heavenly immor
tality is not enough: we want
earthly immortality, too. And
this we must seek to win not by the
gratification of selfish ambition,
but by taking upon ourselves some
of the burdens of humanity. Men
are remembered not by what they
do for themselves, but by what
they do for others. Ido not hesi
tate to say that a temple of human
ity like this University represents a
broader and nobler civilization
than all the mere memorial piles of
the past. And the illustrious
woman whose body is now being
borne to its last resting place
among these classic oaks and her
husband will be remembered by
this institution when a thousand
years have rolled away.
"Finally, let us remind our
selves that that work lives longest
which is given to spiritual rather
than material ends. So, in com
pany with the self-sacrificing lives,
of the past, this gentle life that is
now crowned in heaven also abides
on earth. Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stan
ford shall live on earth in a way
that an angel might be proud to
live; her work, her worth, shall be
for her an everlasting remem-j
brance."
