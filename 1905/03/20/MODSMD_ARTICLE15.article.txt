# CALIFORNIA CONCEDES POINT.
## Plans for Intercollegiate Regatta with State University Nearly Completed. 
### 
While final arrangements are
not fully completed, it is now
practically certain that California
and Stanford will meet in an inter
collegiate boating regatta. The
California Boat Club no longer de
mands that the regatta be held on
the Oakland estuary. A course
has not yet been chosen, but it is
probable that the Stockton water
way will be selected.
Manager Decoto of California is
not in favor of holding the races
any where except at Oakland. The
California Boat Club officials are
not of this opinion, however, and
are willing to have the races take
place at Stockton if there is a
probability of any net financial
returns being realized. This phase
of the situation is being investi
gated now. The question will be
formally decided by the Executive
Committee in a few days. The
Chamber of Commerce of Stockton
has offered to erect bleachers free
of cost to the boat clubs and to
give the entire gate receipts to the
visiting clubs. This of itself prac
tically insures the financial suc
cess of the trip.
A letter has been received by
President Butterfield from the
Young Men's Christian Association
Boat Club of San Diego saying that
they would like to arrange a regatta
with Stanford for sometime early
in May. If satisfactory financial
arrangements can be completed, the
trip will probably be made.
It has been decided to have an
interclass regatta. The races will
be held on the Redwood course on
April Ist at 10:30. Coach Gaither
desires that all the men who wish
to enter the regatta report at once
at Lagunita.
