## Steamship Alameda Due to Reach San Francisco About Noon To-morrow. 
### 
The steamship Alameda is due
to arrive at San Francisco at noon
to-morrow. The schedule is very
uncertain, however, and the vessel
may arrive earlier or later than
the set hour. The honorary escort
of faculty members and students
will hold themselves in readiness
to meet the steamer whenever it
arrives. For this purpose they
will meet at the office of G. E.
Crothers, '95, secretary of the
Board of Trustees, at an early hour
to-morrow morning.
The body will be removed from
the Alameda to a revenue cutter
and landed at the Ferry building.
If the hour is late it may be taken
to the San Francisco residence on
California street; otherwise it will
be taken directly to the Southern
Pacific depot at Third and Town
send and brought to Palo Alto and
thence to the residence on the cam
pus. It will not be met by the
students and there will be no dem
onstration.
The body will remain at the
campus residence until the day of
the funeral, when it will be taken
to the Memorial Church shortly be
fore noon.
