# TRIBUTE TO A NOBLE LIFE.
## Trustees of the University Adopt Resolutions in Memory of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
The Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity met in San Francisco Sat
urday and adopted the following
resolutions in honor of the memory
of Mrs. Stanford:
"The honored life of Jane
Lathrop Stanford is closed. After
years of loneliness and sorrow, of
single-hearted devotion and sacri
fice, she saw at last her beloved
university fully equipped and en
dowed for its great mission, the
nohlest monument ever erected by
parental love. Her busy mind was
still forming new plans and hopes
for its future when she met her
death. Her name and work will
live, and it is fitting that those
whom she selected to maintain
what she had built, and who have
been especially honored by her
friendship and confidence, should
publicly declare their knowledge of
her nobility of character, her efforts
and her success.
"In 1885 Mrs. Stanford joined
with her husband in executing the
founding grant of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University in memory
of their only son, whose name it
bears. Her husband's death in
1893 left the work barely begun,
and added to her grief the crushing
burden of responsibilities such aB
her sheltered life had never known.
She bravely took up the load. Her
strength and skill grew with her task
and were equal to each occasion.
Wise, steadfast in the strength of
God, and true, 1 for ten years she di
rected the business affairs of the
university, planned and superin
tended the erection of its buildings,
and molded its academic policy.
"She guided it through crippling
legal entanglements, through em
barassing internal dissensions, and
through dark days of financial de
pression when she sometimes sold
even her jewels to carry on the
work. She lavished on it her pri
vate fortune, endowing it far be
yond its original plan, and opening
to it unprecedented opportunities
of service. The work of the trus
tees is made easy by the founda
tions which she laid with painful
and unerasing toil.
"A devoted wife and mother, the
loss rr" her son and then of her hus
band did not unnervp or embitter
her, but turned h affection and
activities into wider channels.
The moving spirit of the foun
ders of the University, as de
clared and manifested by her, was
a desire to render the greatest possi
ble service to mankind. She made
her gifts "to the University more
generous to enable it to offer in
struction so nearly free 'that it may
resist the tendency to the stratifica
tion of society by keeping open an
avenue whereby the deserving and
exceptional may rise through their
own effortß from the lowest to the
highest stations in life.'
"She made it really a university
by her wise ordering that 'while its
chief object is the instruction of stu
dents with a view to producing
leaders and educators in every field
of science and industry; it is also
designed to advance learning, the
arts and sciences; and to this end
the institution should assist, by
experimentation and research, in
the advancement of useful knowl
edge, and in the dissemination and
practical application of the same.'
She scrupulously required that'the
University must be maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and
non-sectarian basis'; but she also
provided that 'the greatest freedom
of speech and action consistent with
this non-partisan character.be free
ly accorded to everyone connected
with the institution.'
"She often urged upon the trus
tees the hopes of her husband and
herself in founding the institution,
'not alone to give the student a
technical education, fitting him for
a successful business life, but also
to instill into his mind an appre
ciation of the blessings of this
government, a reverence for its in
stitutions, and a love of God and
humanity, to the end that he may
go forth and by precept and exam
ple spread the great truths by the
light of which his fellowmen will
be elevated and taught how to ob
tain happiness in this world and in
the life eternal.'
"In the unparalleled endowment
and successful establishment of a
university, wisely planned to fulfill
these noble purposes, she has done
a service not second to that ren
dered by any citizen of the State
throughout its history, and Cali
fornia should always cherish her
memory as one of its most precious
and ennobling possessions.
"The gracious influence of her
personal character and rare devo
tion to high public duty have been
impressed upon the trustees
throughout their official relations
with her. They are remembered
with pleasure in this hour of sad
iness, and must forever stimulate
and inspire all who are privileged
to follow her in serving the Uni
jversity."

"In the unparalleled endowment
and successful establishment of a
university, wisely planned to fulfill
these noble purposes, she has done
a service not second to that ren
dered by any citizen of the State
throughout its history, and Cali
fornia should always cherish her
memory as one of its most precious
and ennobling possessions.
"The gracious influence of her
personal character and rare devo

The Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity met in San Francisco Sat
urday and adopted the following
resolutions in honor of the memory
of Mrs. Stanford:
"The honored life of Jane
Lathrop Stanford is closed. After
years of loneliness and sorrow, of
single-hearted devotion and sacri
fice, she saw at last her beloved
university fully equipped and en
dowed for its great mission, the
nohlest monument ever erected by
parental love. Her busy mind was
still forming new plans and hopes
for its future when she met her
death. Her name and work will
live, and it is fitting that those
whom she selected to maintain
what she had built, and who have
been especially honored by her
friendship and confidence, should
publicly declare their knowledge of
her nobility of character, her efforts
and her success.
"In 1885 Mrs. Stanford joined
with her husband in executing the
founding grant of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University in memory
of their only son, whose name it
bears. Her husband's death in
1893 left the work barely begun,
and added to her grief the crushing
burden of responsibilities such aB
her sheltered life had never known.
She bravely took up the load. Her
strength and skill grew with her task
and were equal to each occasion.
Wise, steadfast in the strength of
God, and true, 1 for ten years she di
rected the business affairs of the
university, planned and superin
tended the erection of its buildings,
and molded its academic policy.
"She guided it through crippling
legal entanglements, through em
barassing internal dissensions, and
through dark days of financial de
pression when she sometimes sold
even her jewels to carry on the
work. She lavished on it her pri
vate fortune, endowing it far be
yond its original plan, and opening
to it unprecedented opportunities
of service. The work of the trus
tees is made easy by the founda
tions which she laid with painful
and unerasing toil.
"A devoted wife and mother, the
loss rr" her son and then of her hus
band did not unnervp or embitter
her, but turned h affection and
activities into wider channels.
The moving spirit of the foun
ders of the University, as de
clared and manifested by her, was
a desire to render the greatest possi
ble service to mankind. She made
her gifts "to the University more
generous to enable it to offer in
struction so nearly free 'that it may
resist the tendency to the stratifica
tion of society by keeping open an
avenue whereby the deserving and
exceptional may rise through their
own effortß from the lowest to the
highest stations in life.'
"She made it really a university
by her wise ordering that 'while its
chief object is the instruction of stu
dents with a view to producing
leaders and educators in every field
of science and industry; it is also
designed to advance learning, the
arts and sciences; and to this end
the institution should assist, by
experimentation and research, in
the advancement of useful knowl
edge, and in the dissemination and
practical application of the same.'
She scrupulously required that'the
University must be maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and
non-sectarian basis'; but she also
provided that 'the greatest freedom
of speech and action consistent with
this non-partisan character.be free
ly accorded to everyone connected
with the institution.'
"She often urged upon the trus
tees the hopes of her husband and
herself in founding the institution,
'not alone to give the student a
technical education, fitting him for
a successful business life, but also
to instill into his mind an appre
ciation of the blessings of this
government, a reverence for its in
stitutions, and a love of God and
humanity, to the end that he may
go forth and by precept and exam
ple spread the great truths by the
light of which his fellowmen will
be elevated and taught how to ob
tain happiness in this world and in
the life eternal.'
"In the unparalleled endowment
and successful establishment of a
university, wisely planned to fulfill
these noble purposes, she has done
a service not second to that ren
dered by any citizen of the State
throughout its history, and Cali
fornia should always cherish her
memory as one of its most precious
and ennobling possessions.
"The gracious influence of her
personal character and rare devo
tion to high public duty have been
impressed upon the trustees
throughout their official relations
with her. They are remembered
with pleasure in this hour of sad
iness, and must forever stimulate
and inspire all who are privileged
to follow her in serving the Uni
jversity."
