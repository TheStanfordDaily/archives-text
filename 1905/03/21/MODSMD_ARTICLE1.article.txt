# REMAINS OF MRS. STANFORD NOW REST IN THE CAMPUS RESIDENCE
## Brought from San Francisco in the Early Afternoon on a Special Train. 
### 
THE body of Mrs. Stanford now
lies at the campus residence.
Here it will remain until the cere
monies on Friday, when it will be
placed in its last resting place.
The remains arrived at Menlo Park
at 2:30 this afternoon on a special
funeral train which left the cityi
about 1 o'clock.
At an early hour this morning
the personal friends, members of
the faculty, Board of Trustees,
alumni and representatives of the
student body gathered at the office
of George E. Crothers, secretary of
the Hoard of Trustees, in San
Francisco. From there a number
of the party repaired to the Lom
bard street wharf, where the reve
nue cutter Golden Gate was lying
with steam up prepared to meet the
incoming vessel.
The Alameda was due to dock
at noon, but an hour earlier she
swung into the Pacific Mail dock
near the Ferry building. At 7:45
this morning she was sighted from
the Heads and the news was im
mediately telegraphed to the city.
The flag on the Ferry building was
set at half-mast and most of the
shipping in the harbor promptly
lowered their ensigns.
About half-past ten the revenue
cutter left the slip and steamed out
to meet the steamer, which was
just coming through the Golden
Gate. The party of escorts was
transferred from the government
boat to the liner at the quarantine
grounds, where they were held for
nearly an hour while the inspec
tion was made. Then the big ship
slowly steamed to the dock. The
piers and wharves all along the
bay were dotted with curious peo
ple, and at the Pacific Mail dock a
large crowd of newspapermen and
sightseers had gathered.
Upon landing the funeral party
immediately went ashore, but a
slight delay was also experienced
here in waiting for the arrival of
the hearse and carriages. A special
detail of policemen wearing mourn
ing kept the curious crowd back.
Upon arrival of the vehicles the
casket was carried from the ship's
hold by several stalwart sailors
and placed in the hearse. Miss
Berner, Miss Hunt and the other
ladies of the party, heavily veiled,
came from the ship's cabin and
quickly entered the first carriage.
A long line of others was filled
with the honorary escort, and the
whole cortege then commenced its
journey to the Third and Townsend
depot, where the funeral train was
waiting.
At the exit of the dock a large
squad of policemen in full dress
was drawn up, standing at the sa
lute as the procession filed by.
Four officers walked at the head of

the hearse, and a dozen mounted
policemen on either side. The
long procession slowly wended its
way to the waiting train, where
the casket was again transferred.
The trip from the city to Menlo
Park was made with hardly a stop.
The special train, made up of the
funeral car and two coaches, had
been given the right of way, and so
perfect were the arrangements that
there was hut little delay. Slowly
the train made its way through the
outskirts of the city, and then
speeded down the valley that had
so long been the home of the dead
woman, and which she loved so
well. The special train bore no
sign of its mission, but many of the
country people were on the lookout
for it, and here and there a few
small groups had gathered. Oc
casionally a laborer or mechanic
bared his head as the train whirled
by, a mute tribute to the memory
of the founder of the University.
The train stopped at Menlo Park,
where hearse and carriages were in
waiting. The casket was removed
from the funeral car to the hearse,
the escort forming a guard of honor,
surrounded by half a hundred resi
dents of the town, their heads bared.
Slowly the procession passed
through the town and out to the
county road. Opposite the gate to
the Stanford grounds a score of the
humble neighbors or employes of
Mrs. Stanford had gathered to get
a glimpse at the coffin.
The heavy iron gatesswung open
as the cortege approached. The
procession passed into the broad,
tree-sheltered avenues of the pri
vate estate, the gates swung again
and were locked against the world.
Scarcely a word was spoken a?
the little band of mourners moved
slowly over the graveled paths and
through the gardens that had been
planned and cared for by the ven
erable woman who was now dead.
The final stop was made before the
entrance-way of the old-fashioned
house. For the last time the coffin
was lifted from the hearse by old
employes of the estate. Carefully
jt was borne up the stairs and into
the drawing-room. Flowers were
placed upon it, and then the
mourners passed through the room,
silently, and out into the open.
Their work was done. Mrs. Stan
ford's mortal remains were at
home.
