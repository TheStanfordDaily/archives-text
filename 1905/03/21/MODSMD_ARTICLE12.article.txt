# DATE SET FOR FIELD-DAY.
## Fast Time on the Track Made in a Number of Trials Run Lately. 
### 
The tljfrck management has de
cided to hold the interclass field
day Wednesday, March 29th. This
is two days earlier than the time
scheduled, the change being made
so that the men taking the Pomona
trip may enter. In holding the
meet at this time Coach Moulton
will be better able to pick the men
who will go to Pomona.
The team, which will consist of
the thirteen athletes and the trainer
and manager, will go direct to Los
Angeles, reaching there Friday
evening. The men will then go to
Pomona early Saturday morning.
The training-table will start
next Saturday at the University
Inn with twenty-five men. The
list of men who are on the rubbing
list has again been cut down.
Two good trials took place on
the track this morning. P. M.
Davis, '08, ran the 220-yard dash
in 23.3. A. R. Mac Swain, '08, in his
first attempt on the track, jumped
5 feet 6 inches in the high jump
and 21 feet 4 inches in the broad
jump.
A number of good trials were
run by the candidates for the Var
sity track team Saturday morning.
Except some high jumping by
Captain Bell and a few broad
jumps made by Bell and Redman,
'07, no work was done in the field
events. No trial was held in the
two-mile run, but one of the chief
candidates for this race, L. G. Burr,
'05. won a trial mile race in 4:47.
The winner was closely pressed by
Shelton, '08, and Ivnupp, '07, who
took second and third places.
After leading for the greater part
of the distance, Miller, '08, dropped
out of the half-mile and allowed
Bounds, '05, and Severy, '08, to
finish in a dead heat after running
the race in the good time of 2:06.
Davis, '08, ran the 440-yard dash
in 53 flat. He was closely followed
by Edwards, '07, who ran a well
judged race. Carter, '05, and
Freeman, '06, both ran a good race
in this event.
That Wood's work in the 220-
yard dash has improved materially
recently was proved, for he ran the
distance in 23.1, cutting two-fifths
of a second from the record which
he made in a trial run last week.
Edwards, '07, took first place in
the 100-yard trial in 10:2. Gartz
mann, '08, took second, and Fried
man, '08, third place.
Fifteen men will make the trip
to Pomona, and as Manager Bar
rett and Coach Moulton are in
cluded in this number, only thir
teen track athletes will go. Only
those students who are up in their
college work at the time of the trip
will be permitted to go to Pomona.
