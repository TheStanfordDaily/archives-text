# FUNDS BEING COLLECTED.
## Four Hundred Dollars Turned Over to Manager Barrett for Athletic Field. 
### 
Up to the present date Treasurer
Barrett has received $401 toward
the fund being subscribed for the
new athletic field. Four fraterni
ties and two sororities have not
yet reported and the total amount
collected in Encina Hall is not de
termined. Collecting is still being
carried on in Encina, and more
money is expected to be subscribed
by the residents of the dormitory.
Judging from the returns now

on hand, Treasurer Barrett fears
that the contributions will not
reach the figures that were at first
expected. It seems that the can
vass has not been as systematic as
was planned, or else the contribu
tions have not been as generous as
were anticipated. When the final
returns come in the figures will
then show the conditions more ac
curately. At present it is difficult
to judge what the final result will
be.
