# MAY NOT PLAY ON CAMPUS.
## Intercollegiate Tennis Match May Take Place in San Francisco This Year. 
### 
Although no definite arrange
ment has yet been made, it is possi
ble that this year's intercollegiate
tennis match will be played on the
California Club court√ü in San Fran
cisco, instead of on the California
campus, as the terms of the inter
collegiate agreement state. The rea- (
son for the change lies in the fact
that the one tennis court available
for the match at Berkeley is at
present in very poor condition, and
the State University has neglected
to put it in shape for an intercolle
giate match.
Up to last year all intercollegiate
matches were played in San Fran
cisco on the California Club courts.
Last year, however, the match was
held on the Stanford campus, and
as the scheme was to alternate the
matches on the campuses of the'
two universities, California has the,
right this year to name the place
where the match is to be played on
the morning of April 15th.
Manager Barrett has written to
Manager Decoto of California, ask
ing for a final answer in regard to
the place of the match. An answer
is expected in a few days. The]
stand taken by Stanford simply re
quires that the system of alternat
ing the matches be not abandoned.
In other words, California may
choose for herself this year, but the
intercollegiate match of 1906 must
be played on the Stanford campus.
Manager Barrett is considering
the advisability of charging an ad
mission to the intercollegiate tennis
matches this year. Up to the pres
ent time this has been done only
occasionally, but during the past
year the expenses incurred by the
building and oiling of the new En
cina courts have been rather heavy,
and it is desirable that they should
be defrayed if possible in this way.
The following list of eligibles has
been sent to the University of Cali
fornia: G. A. Hodge, '06, A. R.
Mac Swain, '08, J. F. Cassell, '07,
P. B. Delano, '08, A. W. Hooper,
'05, T. B. Brown, '07, M. C. Burn
'07, L. R. Gay, '08, G. E. Dole, '07,
J. L. Gamble, '05, C. G. Guyer, '06,
and C. L. Lewis, '07.
The injury received by Tennis
Captain G. A. Hodge in the double
tournament last Tuesday is pro
gressing favorably, and the only
danger now lies in the possibility
of the break reopening when Hodge
resumes practice. Although practice
is extremely necessary, especially
for the double team, it will not be
considered safe for him to play
again until within a week or two of
the match. i
