# FLOWERS FOR THE FUNERAL.
## Class Committees Meet and Decide on Form of Their Offerings. 
### 
The committees appointed by
the presidents of the four classes to
purchase floral offerings for Mrs.
Stanford's funeral met to-day and
took more or less definite steps to
procure their tributes.
The Senior committee met this
afternoon at the Kappa Alpha
Theta house and decided to pur
chase a wreath of white roses. R.
C. Bertheau was appointed to go to
San Francisco and select the floral
piece.
The Junior committee also met
this afternoon at the Kappa Alpha
Theta house, and decided to pur
chase a large bunch of Easter lilies
instead of a set piece. J. N. Stan
ford, chairman of the committee,
was appointed to go to San Fran
cisco and select the flowers.
The Sophomore committee met
this morning in the Library, but
was unable to accomplish any
thing owing to the illness of its
chairman, L. M. Edwards, and the
absence of two other members of
the committee. In the absence of
J. C. Macfarland, president of the
class, President Dibble of the As
sociated Students appointed C. F.
Laumeister to take charge of thei
committee, and it will probably,
meet and make its final decision in
the near future.

The Freshman committee met
this morning in the English build
ing and decided to purchase a
wreath of white roses and lilies of
the valley. Arrangements were
made with a Palo Alto florist to
prepare the wreath in time for the
funeral on Friday.
The women students of the Uni
versity, through a committee com
posed of members chosen from the
various sororities and halls, have
made arrangements for sending a
floral offering to the funeral of Mrs.
Stanford. The plan of sending a
separate piece from the women was
suggested by the committee, of
which Miss Beatrice 11. French, '05,
is chairman. This was due to a
change in the plans of the immedi
ate family of Mrs. Stanford which
prevented the women from carrying
out their original desire of placing
their flowers in the library of Mrs.
Stanford's home, where the body
was taken immediately upon its
arrival from the city.
The employes of the University
have taken up a subscription and
are having a large floral piece con
structed which in design repre
sents the Memorial Church.
All of the floral offerings must be
sent to Memorial Church, where
they will be taken charge of by a
student committee. They must be
sent early enough on Friday so
that the committee will have plen
ty of time to arrange the flowers.
