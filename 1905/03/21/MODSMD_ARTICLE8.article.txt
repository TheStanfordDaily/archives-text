years and honors, beloved for her
good deeds among men, and ever to
be remembered for achievements
the power of which for righteous
ness and truth will multiply for all
the centuries to come; be it
"Resolved, That the Regents of
the Univereity of California offer to
the members of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University their deep
sympathy in the loss which this
commonwealth has suffered by the
death of one who has enriched the
tradition of California with so fit a
solution of how vast wealth may
best be used for happiness to ita
possessor and for blessing to man
kind, of one who has wrought so
firmly and no prophetically for the
things which signify, and for the
things which will endure."
