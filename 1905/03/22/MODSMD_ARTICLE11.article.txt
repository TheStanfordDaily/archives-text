# GENERAL PLANS FOR FUNERAL
## Arrangements for Services in Memorial Church and Mausoleum Completed. 
### 
The remains of Mrs. Stanford]
are to remain in her late residence
on the Palo Alto estate, surrounded
by her family and intimate friends
and by her old-time servants, until
shortly before the hour set for ser
vices in Memorial Church Friday.
A small funeral party consisting
of the family and immediate pall
bearers will bring the remains to
the west gate of the Inner Quad
rangle by a quarter past one o'clock
on that day. There they will be
met by the honorary pall-bearers
and thence escorted into the church.
Meanwhile the entire congregation
will have been seated in the several
sections of the church set apart for
them.
At the conclusion of the services
in the church all but the family and
pall-bearers will move to the places
designated for them in preparation
for the procession to the mauso
leum. As soon thereafter as may
be the remains will be escorted to
the hearse in front of the Memorial
Arch, where a few carriages will
be in waiting for the clergy, the
family and some others who may
not be able to walk to the mauso
leum. With these last named ex
ceptions, all persons participating
will be expected to walk.
The services at the mausoleum
wili last some twenty minutes, and
no effort will be made to provide
seats except for the clergy and the
family party.
Policing arrangements will be
made, so that visitors may be
guided to portions of the grounds
open to them.
