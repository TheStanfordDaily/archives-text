The seating of the people in the
Memorial Church on Friday will
be the most difficult problem with
which the committee on arrange
ments has to deal. Certain objec
tions of Mrs. Stanford render it im
possible to make use of formal
cards of admission,and the absence
of this customary method makes
the difficulties and dangers of the
situation very great. The extrica
tion of the hundreds of persons
who may by right enter the church
from the many thousands who
must necessarily be denied this
privilege will be done entirely by
a large corps of ushers. The stu
dents can help very greatly in the;
carrying out successfully of this
arrangement. The ushers have
been asked to assemble in
the Memorial Church Friday
morning at nine o'clock to
receive their final instructions.
It is especially requested by thej
chairman of this committee that
every usher be in the church at
the hour named. They will be re
quested to return again at the
stroke of half-past eleven o'clock,
and the slightest delay may lead to
confusion. Promptness and an in
telligent execution of instructions
are what is asked of the men who
are to collect the mourners, pass
them into the church and seat them.
The students generally may help
by gathering early in their seats in
the two galleries of the church,
which it is believed will accommo
date every one comfortably if none
take up an unnecessary amount of
room. Later an implicit obedience
to the directions of the marshals
who have been selected to lead the
classes will obviate any confusion
in assembling and falling into the
procession at the proper time and
place. In these ways may we all
aid the committee in its difficulty.
