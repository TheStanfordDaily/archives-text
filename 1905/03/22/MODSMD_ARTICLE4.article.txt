# BASEBALL DATE UNCHANGED.
## Stanford to Play California at Berkeley on the First Day of April. 
### 
The executive committee of the!
University of California met last!
night and rejected the proposal tojj
change the date of the first inter-?
collegiate baseball game. Stanford,!
owing to the fact that her prelimi-|
nary practice has been seriously!
interfered with this season and
because April Ist will be but one
week after the funeral of Mrs.
Stanford, wished the first game to
take place a week later than was
scheduled.
When Managers Barrett and De
coto met yesterday afternoon the
latter expressed himself as willing
to make the change, but the Cali
fornia executive committee failed
to give its sanction. The first
game will, therefore, take place at
Berkeley on April Ist, as scheduled.
