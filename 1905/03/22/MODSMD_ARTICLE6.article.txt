# THREE-CORNERED REGATTA.
## California Wants Boat Race Between Stanford, Washington and Herself. 
### 
California wants a three-cornered j
regatta. California's manager has|
been negotiating with Treasurer!
Barrett to-day in an effort to re-p
adjust the boating schedule so that£
the regatta will include California,§
Stanford and Washington. At the|
present time Stanford has agreed|
to race Washington, and final ar-|
rangements for a meeting with|
California are not complete. In-fi
stead of having a dual meet withl
Stanford, California desires a races
between the three universities!
named. To accomplish this, the|
State University wishes Treasurer!
Barrett to cancel the dual race|
with Washington. No definite ar-H
rangements have yet been made. I
Should a three-cornered ragattag
be arranged, it is believed it couldl
not be rowed at Stockton, as thel
waterway at this place is not widei
enough to accommodate three
boats. The only other known
place available for a race of this
kind is on the Oakland estuary, up
on which Stanford has already re
fused to row. If a suitable course!
can be found, it is possible that al
race as proposed by California will!
take place.
