# CLEANING UP THE GROUNDS.
## Work on the Campus to Put It in Good Condition for Friday's Ceremonies. 
### 
A large force of men have been 112
engaged for the past week in put
ting the University grounds in the
best condition for the funeral cere
monies of Friday. The palms on
both sides of University avenue
have been trimmed and the roads
generally putin good condition. |
The central lawn in front of the
University buildings has been cut
and raked, flowers have been re-1
planted on the border, and the sur-1
rounding roads have been grav
eled.
Considerable attention has been |
given to the Memorial Court. Ihe
railing running the length of the
Engineering buildings is
a coat of black paint, which, in con- i
nection with the work being donel
here to remove the weeds and clear
up the space in front of the build
ings, will add greatly to the ap-j
pearance of this part of the!
grounds. The foliage of the central j
court of the Inner Quadrangle will
be trimmed and the court care
fully cleared. The work of remov
ing weeds and cleaning up has also!
been carried to the vicinity of En-1
cina Hall and other parts of the
grounds.
All work on the new buildings
and the Museum has ceased until!
after the funeral.
