lANE LATHROP STANFORD
J will be laid to rest
afternoon beside her husband and (
son in the stately granite mauso-j
leum of the Stanfords. The plans
for the obsequies are now complete,!
and although impressive, the cere-j
monies will bear that great sim
plicity of character that marked
the life of the noble woman in
whose memory they are held.
The casket will be taken from
the residence of the founder early
in the afternoon, and, escorted by
a small cortege consisting of mem
bers of the family, employes of the
estate and immediate pall-bearers,'
the body will be brought to the
west arch of the inner quad
rangle. Here the honorary pall
bearers will meet the funeral party
and escort it to the doors of the
Memorial Church.
Within the beautiful edifice the
people who come to pay a last'
tribute to the great philanthropist
will already be in their seats.
Down the main aisle of the church
the pall-bearers will bear their
burden to the apse, where the
casket will be placed on the cata
falque arranged for it. As soon as
the body arrives in the church
Organist Blodgett will render
Chopin's magnificent funeral march
on the great organ.
After a choral by the student
choir of eighty voices, Rev. Will
iam Kirk Guthrie will pronounce
the invocation. A memorial an
them composed by Dr. Blodgett
will follow the prayer. Rabbi
Jacob Voorsanger will read the first
lesson, which will be followed by
the singing of a hymn by Miss E.
W. Smith. The second lesson will
be read by Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille.
After a prayer by Bishop Will
iam Ford Nichols, the funeral ad
dress will be delivered by the Rev.
John W. Dinsmore. The benedic
tion will be pronounced by Rev. C.
M. Hill. Then the congregation
will retire during the playing of
the postlude. The remains will
then be taken from the church to
the hearse, which will await it at
the Memorial Arch.
The funeral procession will be
formed immediately after the ser
vice in the Memorial Church.
During the playing of the postlude
all but the faculty and pall-bearers
will move to places designated for
them in the procession. The pro
cession will be formed in front of
Memorial Arch and will be led by
the Freshman class under the
direction of their officers. After
them will follow in order the Soph
omore class, the Junior class, the
Senior class, resident graduate stu
dents, the church choir, alumni,
faculty of the University, officia
ting clergymen, honorary pall-

immediate pall-bearers,
'the casket with the student bear
ers, the official delegates, and em
ployes.
After the procession is formed the
funeral party will emerge from the
church, crossing the inner quad
rangle and proceeding directly to
the arch, where the hearse will be
in waiting.
After the remains have been
placed in the hearse the procession
will move down the east side of the
oval, north on University avenue,
and directly to the mausoleum.
At the tomb the ceremonies will
be very brief, consisting of two
hymns rendered by the student
choir and a brief address by Rev.
Dr. C. R. Brown. The services will
end with the solemnly beautiful
ritual of the committal of the body
to the grave,which will be delivered
by Bishop Nichols.
