# Sorrow of Portland Alumni.
## 
### 
"The members of the Stanford
University Club of Portland learn 1
with the deepest sorrow and regret
of the death of Mrs. Jane L. Stan-!
ford in a distant country, removed
from the friends who would sup-j
port and comfort her. No expressed
sentiments are adequate to voice
our feelings, which can only find (
their fullest manifestation in a life (
conforming to the noble example'
she has set us. Our sorrow is tem
pered by the thought that she knew!
her great life-work was safely com
pleted and had rejoiced in the vic
tories won by her unswerving de-j
votion to a holy cause developed in
the shadow of a great sorrow.
"As alumni of Stanford Univer-j
sity we each of us owe a debt to,
the memory and deeds of this il
lustrious and most unselfish hu
manitarian which we can never re
pay; and though she has been re
moved from among us, her good
works in the cause of education
will endure forever, and the grati
tude of a great nation shall be her
noblest monument.
