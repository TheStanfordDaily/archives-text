# Students Express Sympathy.

### 
Dr. Jordan recently received the
following letter expressing sorrow
from a number of prominent
graduates who are studying medi
cine at Johns Hopkins Univer
sity:
Dear Dr. Jordanâ€”Moved by a
sorrow that tills the hearts of all
Stanford men and women, a com
pany of Stanford men in Balti
more wish to pronounce their sense
of great bereavement in the loss of
their benefactress and friend.
We not only extend our sym
pathy to you and all those actively
connected with the University, but
express our own need of consola
tion. Well knowing from the ripe
ness of Mrs. Stanford's years that
the inevitable end would perhaps
come in a period not far distant,
we had steeled ourselves in somej
measure to the contemplation of;
what would be a great blow. The
awful suddenness, however, of her
departure, and the distressing cir
cumstances intensify our grief, and
we shall constantly recall her life
as a blessing, her acquaintance a
benediction.
Yours respectfully,
