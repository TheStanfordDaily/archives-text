C. F. Miller, the chief gardener
of the Stanford estate, will have
charge of all the floral offerings to
morrow at the funeral, it was one
of the oft-expressed wishes of Mrs.
Stanford that there be no display
of flowers in Memorial Church, and
in accordance with this desire most
of the floral tributes will be ar
ranged at the mausoleum by the
committee and not in the church
Part of the flowers will be taken to
the residence and a small portion
of them will be arranged around
the bier in the Memorial Church.
