ing resolutions were adopted:
"Whereas, In the providence of
God, Mrs. Jane L. Stanford has
been suddenly removed by death
from the scene of her beneficent la
bors; and
"Whereas, It is our desire to ex
press suitably our appreciation of
her sterling worth and our admira
tion for the great work she has ac
complished; therefore be it
"Resolved, That we record our
profound regret that her life has
been cut short in the midst of her
abundant labors for the upbuild
ing of a great university, which,
however, established upon a sure
foundation, will ever be a monu
ment and an honor to herself, to
her husband, and to their beloved
son;
"Resolved, That we honor her
memory and rejoice in the fact that
her noble traits of character will
never be forgotten in the State to
which she has given so much, both
in example and material advance
ment;
"Resolved, That we tender to
the faculty and students of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
our heartfelt sympathy, and ex
press to them our earnest hope that
the aims of the founders of that
noble institution may be fully
realized."
