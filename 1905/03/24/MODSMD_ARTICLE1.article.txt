# Body of Jane Lathrop Stanford Laid in the Tomb Restslathrop Stanford laid in the Tomb
## Rests Reside Remains of Husband and Son in the Mausoleum 
### 
IN the splendid granite tomb be
neath the stately oaks of the
arboretum repose the last mortal
remains of Jane Lathrop Stanford,
beside those of her beloved husband
and son. Without pomp or ostenta
tion, but with that rare simplicity
which the dead woman loved bo
well, the impressive obsequies were
conducted.
The day which was to witness
the final burial ceremonies of the
last founder of the university
dawned clear and bright. Early
in the morning the crowd began to
gather on the campus, and by noon
probably ten thousand people had
assembled to witness the funeral
services. 'Silently and solemnly
the throng gathered as the chimes
of the beautiful Memorial Church
tolled for the dead woman whose
remains were soon to be placed in
the tomb.
Carried from the Old Mansion.
Shortly after noon the honorary
and immediate pall-bearers pro
ceeded to the late residence of Mrs.
Stanford. In the drawing-room of
the old mansion, covered with a
pall of fragrant California violets,
reposed the casket containing the
remains of the great philanthropist.
Gently the coffin whs lifted from
its place and carried to the waiting
hearse by eight stalwart students.
Slowly the great doors closed be
hind the mournful funeral party,
and the body of Mrs. Stanford left!
for the last time the famous houßej
which her living spirit had graced!
during the happiest days of her life.l
Up the avenue under the giantl
eucalyptus trees the sad cortege
moved slowly toward (he quadran
gle. The body was taking its last
journey over the country which
was the favorite strolling place of
the dead woman. At the north
west corner of the outer quadran
gle the casket was lifted tenderly
from the hearse and placed on
rollers. Down the long arcades,
beneath the great Memorial Arch
and out in the sunlight of the Me
morial Court, the casket was mov
ed by the pall-bearers, who were
followed by the family and honor
ary escort. Through a lane in the
vast assemblage, which stood with
bared heads and in reverential
silence, the cortege proceeded to
the doors of the Memorial Church.
Solemn Entry Into the Church.
Inside the sacred edifice the large
congregation, which had assembled
to do honor to a great woman's
memory, rose as the bronze doors
swung open to admit the pall-bear

ers with their sad burden. As the
casket was brought through the in
ner doors of the church the great
organ burst into sound with Cho
pin's magnificent funeral march,
which was played until the casket
was placed on its catafalque on the
dais of the splendid apse.
As the last member of the funeral
party took his seat the silence of
death seemed to fall over the gather
ing. The effulgent beams of the
bright sun shone through the rich
glass of the windows, and cast a
warm glow on the pillars and walls
until the cold stone vied in color
with the gold of the gorgeously
decorated dome.
The Solemn Ceremonies.
After the first hush the silence
was broken by the deep tones
of the great organ, alternating
with the reverent voices of the
officiating clergymen. With solemn
prayer and eloquent words of eulogy
the eminent ministers rendered the
funeral services over the remains of
the woman whose death has sad
dened millions.
While the great organ was peal
ing out Gounod's Ave Maria, the
congregation moved slowly out of
the sad atmosphere of the church
'into the bright sunlight. The peo
ple who had designated places in
the funeral procession hurried to
their positions through the various
exits of the quadrangle. The ad
mirable plans for the arrangement
of the procession were carried out
in good order and with the least
possible delay. First in the long
line came the members of the Fresh
man class, arranged in a column of
fours. After them came the other
classes in the same order, with the
women marching at the head of
each class. Following the classes
came the resident graduate stu
dents, the church choir, alumni,
faculty of the university, officiating
clergymen,honorary and immediate
pall-bearers, the official delegates,
the hearse,escorted by eight student
pall-bearers, the family, and the
employes of the university and
estate.
As soon as the congregation had
retired the casket was removed from
the church, which owes a great part
of its marvelous beauty to the won
derful woman who was passing
through its doors for the last time.
Again the student bearers took up
their burden and carried it to the

hearse. With slow steps the proces
sion wound its great length around
the lawn and down the main drive
way. On reaching the mausoleum
the students separated into two
lines, and dividing on each side,
they formed a hollow square which
completely enveloped the funeral
party.
While there were only a few floral
pieces at the church, the vicinity of
the tomb was graced with a prodi
gal display of blossoms. The front
of the mausoleum was completely
covered with a mass of glorious
flowers, tokens of grief from in
numerable individuals and socie
ties.
Services Brief but Impressive.
Very brief and impressive were
the services which marked the final
consignment of the body to its last
resting place beside the remains of
the husband and son. After the
singing of two hymns by the choir
and the utterance of a notably elo
quent tribute to the memory of Mrs.
Stanford, the final ritual of the com
mittal to the grave was pronounced.
As the bronze doors of the tomb
closed, shutting from sight forever
the body of their benefactress, the
students sang with deep earnest
ness the beautiful university hymn,
"Hail, Stanford, Hail."
As the last strains of the song
died away the great assemblage
dispersed, leaving the stately tomb
alone with its noble dead.

The Solemn Ceremonies.
After the first hush the silence
was broken by the deep tones
of the great organ, alternating
with the reverent voices of the
officiating clergymen. With solemn
prayer and eloquent words of eulogy
the eminent ministers rendered the
funeral services over the remains of
the woman whose death has sad
dened millions.
While the great organ was peal
ing out Gounod's Ave Maria, the
congregation moved slowly out of
the sad atmosphere of the church
'into the bright sunlight. The peo
ple who had designated places in
the funeral procession hurried to
their positions through the various
exits of the quadrangle. The ad
mirable plans for the arrangement
of the procession were carried out
in good order and with the least
possible delay. First in the long
line came the members of the Fresh
man class, arranged in a column of
fours. After them came the other
classes in the same order, with the
women marching at the head of
each class. Following the classes
came the resident graduate stu
dents, the church choir, alumni,
faculty of the university, officiating
clergymen,honorary and immediate
pall-bearers, the official delegates,
the hearse,escorted by eight student
pall-bearers, the family, and the
employes of the university and
estate.
As soon as the congregation had
retired the casket was removed from
the church, which owes a great part
of its marvelous beauty to the won
derful woman who was passing
through its doors for the last time.
Again the student bearers took up
their burden and carried it to the

hearse. With slow steps the proces
sion wound its great length around
the lawn and down the main drive
way. On reaching the mausoleum
the students separated into two
lines, and dividing on each side,
they formed a hollow square which
completely enveloped the funeral
party.
While there were only a few floral
pieces at the church, the vicinity of
the tomb was graced with a prodi
gal display of blossoms. The front
of the mausoleum was completely
covered with a mass of glorious
flowers, tokens of grief from in
numerable individuals and socie
ties.
Services Brief but Impressive.
Very brief and impressive were
the services which marked the final
consignment of the body to its last
resting place beside the remains of
the husband and son. After the
singing of two hymns by the choir
and the utterance of a notably elo
quent tribute to the memory of Mrs.
Stanford, the final ritual of the com
mittal to the grave was pronounced.
As the bronze doors of the tomb
closed, shutting from sight forever
the body of their benefactress, the
students sang with deep earnest
ness the beautiful university hymn,
"Hail, Stanford, Hail."
As the last strains of the song
died away the great assemblage
dispersed, leaving the stately tomb
alone with its noble dead.
IN the splendid granite tomb be
neath the stately oaks of the
arboretum repose the last mortal
remains of Jane Lathrop Stanford,
beside those of her beloved husband
and son. Without pomp or ostenta
tion, but with that rare simplicity
which the dead woman loved bo
well, the impressive obsequies were
conducted.
The day which was to witness
the final burial ceremonies of the
last founder of the university
dawned clear and bright. Early
in the morning the crowd began to
gather on the campus, and by noon
probably ten thousand people had
assembled to witness the funeral
services. 'Silently and solemnly
the throng gathered as the chimes
of the beautiful Memorial Church
tolled for the dead woman whose
remains were soon to be placed in
the tomb.
Carried from the Old Mansion.
Shortly after noon the honorary
and immediate pall-bearers pro
ceeded to the late residence of Mrs.
Stanford. In the drawing-room of
the old mansion, covered with a
pall of fragrant California violets,
reposed the casket containing the
remains of the great philanthropist.
Gently the coffin whs lifted from
its place and carried to the waiting
hearse by eight stalwart students.
Slowly the great doors closed be
hind the mournful funeral party,
and the body of Mrs. Stanford left!
for the last time the famous houßej
which her living spirit had graced!
during the happiest days of her life.l
Up the avenue under the giantl
eucalyptus trees the sad cortege
moved slowly toward (he quadran
gle. The body was taking its last
journey over the country which
was the favorite strolling place of
the dead woman. At the north
west corner of the outer quadran
gle the casket was lifted tenderly
from the hearse and placed on
rollers. Down the long arcades,
beneath the great Memorial Arch
and out in the sunlight of the Me
morial Court, the casket was mov
ed by the pall-bearers, who were
followed by the family and honor
ary escort. Through a lane in the
vast assemblage, which stood with
bared heads and in reverential
silence, the cortege proceeded to
the doors of the Memorial Church.
Solemn Entry Into the Church.
Inside the sacred edifice the large
congregation, which had assembled
to do honor to a great woman's
memory, rose as the bronze doors
swung open to admit the pall-bear

ers with their sad burden. As the
casket was brought through the in
ner doors of the church the great
organ burst into sound with Cho
pin's magnificent funeral march,
which was played until the casket
was placed on its catafalque on the
dais of the splendid apse.
As the last member of the funeral
party took his seat the silence of
death seemed to fall over the gather
ing. The effulgent beams of the
bright sun shone through the rich
glass of the windows, and cast a
warm glow on the pillars and walls
until the cold stone vied in color
with the gold of the gorgeously
decorated dome.
