# FLOWERS OF RARE BEAUTY.
## Magnificent Pieces Sent by Individuals and Organizations in Honor of the Dead. 
### 
IT is most difficult to describe
the profusion and beauty of
thefioral offerings which formed so
noticeable and beautiful a part in
the services of to-day. Thousands
of pure white Easter lilies and
carnations were blended with the
more modest violets and lilies of
the valley, sent by loving friends
and numberless beneficiaries. In
the church the floral display was
simple but exquisite, being confined
almost solely to the gifts of the
family and nearest friends. On
the marble stand within the chan
cel rail the sole decoration consist
ed of Easter lilies, divided between
the two silver vases given by Mrs.
Stanford herself and used on Dedi
cation Sunday.
A tall and magnificent cross of
white lilies and roses, with ''Aunt
ie" in purple immortelles across
the white base, the offering of Miss
Jennie Lathrop, occupied a posi
tion to the right of the altar. The
floral blanket covering the casket
was made of purple violetß mingled
with delicate ferns, and was the gift
of Mrs. Lathrop.
The most striking of the set
pieces was the Memorial Church,
worked in carnations, roses, and
white Cape flowers which had been
sent from South Africa. The flor
ist had made a perfect miniature
of the church, even to the coloring
of the red tiling on the roof and
the white dial of the clock, whose
hands had been stopped at twenty
minutes before twelve, the hour of
Mrs. Stanford's death. This piece
was the gift of the employes of the
Stanford estate.
Beside this stood a careful like
ness, done in yellow daffodils and
red carnations, of the west arch,
under which Mrs. Stanford, with
her husband, had stood during the
formal opening of the university
in 1891. This was the offering of
the Stanford Club of San Francisco,
many of whose members were
present on this memorable occa
sion.
A great panel two and a half
feet wide and three feet high, plac
ed on an easel, and composed of
the rarest purple orchids framed
with lilies of the valley, was the
tribute of the Los Angeles Stanford
Club.
From the Stanford Club of Wash
ington,!). C., came a spray of white
Easter lilies and pink bridesmaid
roses. From Fresno, Chicago,
Eureka, Portland, San Jose, San
Diego, Denver, and New York came
offerings of beautiful flowers, the
attempt of Stanford clubs in those
cities to express their sorrow in the
loss of the one who had done so
much for them.
On the grass at the sides of the
mausoleum were spread the tributes
of the four classes now in college, of
the faculty, of the various organi
zations, of the University of Cali
fornia faculty and students, and
from scores of friends and bene
ficiaries.
From the Senior class came a
large wreath of the purest white
roses with delicate ferns. The '07
and '08 classes also chose wreaths,
the former of white carnations, with
a slight mingling of violets, and
the latter of lilies of the valley and
white roses. A spray of Easter
lilies and ferns was the gift of the
Junior class.

A sickle of roses inclosing a
sheaf of wheat, and resting on a
white base, in which were worked
purple immortelles, was the ap
propriate gift of the Vina estate.
The Stanford-Lathrop Memorial
Home of Sacramento was represent
ed by a large purple and white
shield, composed solely of violets,
with the word ''Mercy" worked in
the violets on the top.
A piece worked in violets, pink
roßes and carnations, with the mon
ogram "S. C." worked in red carna
tions and yellow daffodils, came
from the Associated Students of the
University of California. The fac
ulty of that university sent a wreath
of ferns and lilies.
The Stanford faculty presented a
wreath of orchids and ferns; the
women students an easel of Easter
lilies.
A cross of brilliant red carna
tions, the cross of autumn leaves
hung with their color, purple, was
the gift of the San Francisco Elks.
A scroll of white and pink roses,
with their letters in pink carna
tions, came from the Elks of San
Jose. A broken column of white
roses and russet cycas leaves was
sent by the Woman's Club of San
Jose.
The various fraternities of the
university sent their tributes, in all
cases less assuming than the more
elaborate pieces, but with every tri
bute was mingled a sense of irre
parable loss and most sincere sor
row.
Students, employes, friends from
far-away lands, joined in the mute
expression of their grief in offering
the finest blossoms which went to
make Mrs. Stanford's funeral un
paralleled in its wealth of magnifi
cent flowers.

Home of Sacramento was represent
ed by a large purple and white
shield, composed solely of violets,
with the word ''Mercy" worked in
the violets on the top.
A piece worked in violets, pink
roßes and carnations, with the mon
ogram "S. C." worked in red carna
tions and yellow daffodils, came
from the Associated Students of the
University of California. The fac
ulty of that university sent a wreath
of ferns and lilies.
The Stanford faculty presented a
wreath of orchids and ferns; the
women students an easel of Easter
lilies.
A cross of brilliant red carna
tions, the cross of autumn leaves
hung with their color, purple, was
the gift of the San Francisco Elks.
A scroll of white and pink roses,
with their letters in pink carna
tions, came from the Elks of San
Jose. A broken column of white
roses and russet cycas leaves was
sent by the Woman's Club of San
Jose.
The various fraternities of the
university sent their tributes, in all
cases less assuming than the more
elaborate pieces, but with every tri
bute was mingled a sense of irre
parable loss and most sincere sor
row.
Students, employes, friends from
far-away lands, joined in the mute
expression of their grief in offering
the finest blossoms which went to
make Mrs. Stanford's funeral un
paralleled in its wealth of magnifi
cent flowers.
IT is most difficult to describe
the profusion and beauty of
thefioral offerings which formed so
noticeable and beautiful a part in
the services of to-day. Thousands
of pure white Easter lilies and
carnations were blended with the
more modest violets and lilies of
the valley, sent by loving friends
and numberless beneficiaries. In
the church the floral display was
simple but exquisite, being confined
almost solely to the gifts of the
family and nearest friends. On
the marble stand within the chan
cel rail the sole decoration consist
ed of Easter lilies, divided between
the two silver vases given by Mrs.
Stanford herself and used on Dedi
cation Sunday.
A tall and magnificent cross of
white lilies and roses, with ''Aunt
ie" in purple immortelles across
the white base, the offering of Miss
Jennie Lathrop, occupied a posi
tion to the right of the altar. The
floral blanket covering the casket
was made of purple violetß mingled
with delicate ferns, and was the gift
of Mrs. Lathrop.
The most striking of the set
pieces was the Memorial Church,
worked in carnations, roses, and
white Cape flowers which had been
sent from South Africa. The flor
ist had made a perfect miniature
of the church, even to the coloring
of the red tiling on the roof and
the white dial of the clock, whose
hands had been stopped at twenty
minutes before twelve, the hour of
Mrs. Stanford's death. This piece
was the gift of the employes of the
Stanford estate.
Beside this stood a careful like
ness, done in yellow daffodils and
red carnations, of the west arch,
under which Mrs. Stanford, with
her husband, had stood during the
formal opening of the university
in 1891. This was the offering of
the Stanford Club of San Francisco,
many of whose members were
present on this memorable occa
sion.
A great panel two and a half
feet wide and three feet high, plac
ed on an easel, and composed of
the rarest purple orchids framed
with lilies of the valley, was the
tribute of the Los Angeles Stanford
Club.
From the Stanford Club of Wash
ington,!). C., came a spray of white
Easter lilies and pink bridesmaid
roses. From Fresno, Chicago,
Eureka, Portland, San Jose, San
Diego, Denver, and New York came
offerings of beautiful flowers, the
attempt of Stanford clubs in those
cities to express their sorrow in the
loss of the one who had done so
much for them.
On the grass at the sides of the
mausoleum were spread the tributes
of the four classes now in college, of
the faculty, of the various organi
zations, of the University of Cali
fornia faculty and students, and
from scores of friends and bene
ficiaries.
From the Senior class came a
large wreath of the purest white
roses with delicate ferns. The '07
and '08 classes also chose wreaths,
the former of white carnations, with
a slight mingling of violets, and
the latter of lilies of the valley and
white roses. A spray of Easter
lilies and ferns was the gift of the
Junior class.

A sickle of roses inclosing a
sheaf of wheat, and resting on a
white base, in which were worked
purple immortelles, was the ap
propriate gift of the Vina estate.
