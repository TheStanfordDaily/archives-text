# California Pays Tribute.

The regular university assembly
at the University of California this
morning was converted into a me
morial service for Jane Lathrop
Stanford. I'rofessor Thomas R.
Bacon was the principal speaker.
A large audience of students listen
ed to the eloquent eulogy which the
speaker delivered on the achieve
ments and character of the dead
philanthropist. Dr. Bacon spoke
in part as follows:
" Mrs. Stanford's life was begun
under humble circumstances,
fraught with desolating sorrows,
but it was one that became synon
ymous with kindness, generosity,
helpfulness. She was one of those
women who are too good for this
world. As President Wheeler has
said, when all the story has been
told we shall see what a great hero
ine she really was. Her struggle to
maintain the University's exist
ence during the few dark years fol
lowing Senator Stanford's death
marks her as one of the most level
headed and practical of women.
Singleness of purpose and self-ab
negationâ€” these things Mrs. Stan
ford exemplified in her later years.
For these she should be loved and
remembered for ages to come. How
great her services to higher educa
tion have been is inestimable. The
founders of Stanford University did
more for California than if all the
millions had been bestowed on this
institution. The competition has
made us great. It has given a
stimulus for scientific research and
higher ideals. Had it not been for
the foundation of a rival institu
tion, California would have re
mained the same obscure institu
tion it was twenty years ago."
