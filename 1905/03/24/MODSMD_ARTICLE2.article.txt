# Services in the Beautiful Memorial Church Very Simple but Solemnly Impressive
## Distinguished Clergy Pay Tribute to the Memory of the Dead Philanthropist. 
### 
THE grandest and most impress
ive of the scenes that were en
acted about Mrs. Stanford's body
as it moved to its last resting place
was that which occurred in the
Memorial Churoh. In crowded
nave and transepts, in galleries
thronged to their utmost with
mourning students, almost three
thousand men and women were
gathered to pay the world's last
tribute to Mrs. Stanford. From
galleries, nave and transepts three
thousand pairs of eyes were fixed
upon the violet-covered casket that
stood in the beautiful apse of the
church, while from the choir loft
above a hundred student voices
joined with the deep-toned organ.
Thousands Witness the Ceremonies.
At twenty minutes after twelve
o'clock the bronze doors of the
church were swung open, and for
the next hour a steady stream of
students, faculty, delegates and
alumni moved across the thresh
old and were led to the sections al
ready assigned them by the corps
of student ushers. So perfect were
the arrangements that not a min
ute was lost, not a hitch occurred,
and when the column of alumni
that headed the funeral procession
appeared at the entrance not a seat
save those that were awaiting re
mained empty. Not a person re
mained standing in the aisles, and
yet twenty-seven hundred indi
viduals had been admitted. Of
these eleven hundred were students,
two hundred were alumni, two
hundred and twenty-five listed of
ficial delegates, and one hundred
of the faculty. The State was
represented by many officials of
Governor Pardee's staff, and the
State University by President
Wheeler, the deans of its colleges
and student representatives.
The Casket Enters the Church.
Shortly after the alumni division
had entered, the head of the funeral
procession appeared. The vast con
gregation rose and stood reverently
as the casket was borne solemnly
down the main aisle by the eight
student pall-bearers, while from the
organ came the strains of Chopin's
funeral march. After the casket had
been deposited in the apse of the
church the congregation remained
standing while the choir sang:
"To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit,
Who break'st in love this mortal chain,
My life I but from Thee inherit,
And death becomes my chiefest gain,
In Thee I live, in Thee I die,
Content, for Thou art ever nigh."
Many Clergymen Participate.
A prayer was then read by Rev.
William Kirk Guthrie of the First
Presbyterian Church of San Fran
cisco, and was followed by a 'me

morial anthem bv. Dr. B. C. Blod
gett, organist of the Memorial
Church, and the reading of the two
lessons by Rabbi Jacob Voor- 1
sanger of San Francisco and Rev.
Dr. E. R. Dille of Oakland, respec-.
lively. "Lead, Kindly Light," was
sung by Miss Eudora W. Smith,'
followed by a prayer by Bishop
William Ford Nichols, and the me
morial address was then delivered
by Rev. Dr. John \V, Dinsmore of
San Jose.
The Memorial Sermon.
No nobler tribute has been paid
to Mrs. Stanford in words than this
address, which follows:
The words to be spoken here and
now must be few and simple. The
exigencies of the occasion and the'
known tastes of the departed alike
require this brevity and simplicity.
This hour brings to us an impres
sive illustration of the sublime ut
terances of an ancient bard: "Clouds
and darkness are round about Him;
righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of His throne." Also of
an ancient prophet: "My thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts."
Mysteries bewildering and in
scrutable, confront us on every
hand; enigmas perplexing and
painful meet us in every path and
and every day. No good and wise
man, if lie had given the power,
would have made such a world as
this is. He would not have filled
it with millionfold and merciless
perversities and poisons; with in
vincible ministries of suffering,
and with tremendous dynamics of
destruction and death. Nor would
he have made such a human race

jjas ours is, with its awful talent for
rapacity, treachery, cruelty and
crime. Or if, by some fatal blunder,
jhe had made such a world and such
Ja race to people it, swiftly would he|
'have regenerated or destroyed it, ;
|,both the race and the world. Is notj
jthat what you would have done?
I No flaorefwould your wisest, and]
best man administer the affairs of
this world as they are administered ;
nor would he suffer this race to
work out the history it has worked
out from time immemorial. In-J
stantly would he have corrected the
perversities of nature, neutralized
its poisons, disarmed and destroyed
all their manifold and mighty
agencies which bring hardship,
suffering and death to the world.
He would instantly exterminate
out of human nature its meanness,
viciousness and ferocity, and put
an utter end to all (he frightful
cruelties and crimes which have
drenched human history in tears,
and steeped it in blood; those in
humanities of man to man which
have made the countless millions
mourn. If you had the power,
would not you do this?
And yet, we believe that the al-l
mighty, all-wise and ever-blessed
God created this world, and that
He presides over all its ongoings
from the very least to the very
greatest. True, as it came from His
hand, it was all very good, but He
permitted the fatal blight to fall
upon it, and what one permits when |
he has power to hinder he does. |
And we believe in His almighty
providence; Hissupreme and sover
eign presidency over the world, and
all its affairs from greatest to least.
This belief may take one form or an
other. It may rest on rational, or
on irrational grounds; its effects
may be ennobling or degrading,
but in its germinal principle, itl

seems to be a primary, an intuitive
conviction of the human race. We
believe in the Living God; in His
all-wise and all-powerful provi
dence; that He has never let go of
anv world, or anything, which He
has created; that He has an all
searching supervision, and an infi
nitely easy mastery over all things
absolutely, from suns and systems
down to sparrows and the hairs of
our heads; and most certainly,
over all the multitudinous details
of every individual life. On this,
our faith, our hopes, our consola
tions, our very souls, rest.
Hut most plainly, His thoughts
and His ways are not as ours. Our
lives are ordered not as we would
have ordered them; not as a good
and wise man who loves us would
have ordered them. It is a truism,
almost a moral axiom, â€”that it is
the unexpected that happens.
Events unexpected and unwelcome
confront us at every turn. Perhaps
there is not one of you here who, if
you could have foreseen all you
have had to come through, but
would have sunk down in discour
agement, if not in despair. Even
of those whose lives may seem to
have been most prosperous, this is
true. Probably such a one as Mrs.
Stanford, whom many regard as
specially fortunate, as one who had
everything to enjoy and little to
suffer, even of her it maybe said,
that if, fifty years ago, she could
have foreseen all that she had to
suffer, she would have been pro
foundly depressed; she would have
shivered and shuddered under the
dark clouds of anticipation. She
had her sorrows, no less keen, prob
ably far more keen, than those of
the humblest servant in her em
ploy.
