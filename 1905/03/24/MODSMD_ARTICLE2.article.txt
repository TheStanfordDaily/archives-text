# Services in the Beautiful Memorial Church Very Simple but Solemnly Impressive
## Distinguished Clergy Pay Tribute to the Memory of the Dead Philanthropist. 
### 
THE grandest and most impress
ive of the scenes that were en
acted about Mrs. Stanford's body
as it moved to its last resting place
was that which occurred in the
Memorial Churoh. In crowded
nave and transepts, in galleries
thronged to their utmost with
mourning students, almost three
thousand men and women were
gathered to pay the world's last
tribute to Mrs. Stanford. From
galleries, nave and transepts three
thousand pairs of eyes were fixed
upon the violet-covered casket that
stood in the beautiful apse of the
church, while from the choir loft
above a hundred student voices
joined with the deep-toned organ.
Thousands Witness the Ceremonies.
At twenty minutes after twelve
o'clock the bronze doors of the
church were swung open, and for
the next hour a steady stream of
students, faculty, delegates and
alumni moved across the thresh
old and were led to the sections al
ready assigned them by the corps
of student ushers. So perfect were
the arrangements that not a min
ute was lost, not a hitch occurred,
and when the column of alumni
that headed the funeral procession
appeared at the entrance not a seat
save those that were awaiting re
mained empty. Not a person re
mained standing in the aisles, and
yet twenty-seven hundred indi
viduals had been admitted. Of
these eleven hundred were students,
two hundred were alumni, two
hundred and twenty-five listed of
ficial delegates, and one hundred
of the faculty. The State was
represented by many officials of
Governor Pardee's staff, and the
State University by President
Wheeler, the deans of its colleges
and student representatives.
The Casket Enters the Church.
Shortly after the alumni division
had entered, the head of the funeral
procession appeared. The vast con
gregation rose and stood reverently
as the casket was borne solemnly
down the main aisle by the eight
student pall-bearers, while from the
organ came the strains of Chopin's
funeral march. After the casket had
been deposited in the apse of the
church the congregation remained
standing while the choir sang:
"To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit,
Who break'st in love this mortal chain,
My life I but from Thee inherit,
And death becomes my chiefest gain,
In Thee I live, in Thee I die,
Content, for Thou art ever nigh."
Many Clergymen Participate.
A prayer was then read by Rev.
William Kirk Guthrie of the First
Presbyterian Church of San Fran
cisco, and was followed by a 'me

morial anthem bv. Dr. B. C. Blod
gett, organist of the Memorial
Church, and the reading of the two
lessons by Rabbi Jacob Voor- 1
sanger of San Francisco and Rev.
Dr. E. R. Dille of Oakland, respec-.
lively. "Lead, Kindly Light," was
sung by Miss Eudora W. Smith,'
followed by a prayer by Bishop
William Ford Nichols, and the me
morial address was then delivered
by Rev. Dr. John \V, Dinsmore of
San Jose.
The Memorial Sermon.
No nobler tribute has been paid
to Mrs. Stanford in words than this
address, which follows:
The words to be spoken here and
now must be few and simple. The
exigencies of the occasion and the'
known tastes of the departed alike
require this brevity and simplicity.
This hour brings to us an impres
sive illustration of the sublime ut
terances of an ancient bard: "Clouds
and darkness are round about Him;
righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of His throne." Also of
an ancient prophet: "My thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts."
Mysteries bewildering and in
scrutable, confront us on every
hand; enigmas perplexing and
painful meet us in every path and
and every day. No good and wise
man, if lie had given the power,
would have made such a world as
this is. He would not have filled
it with millionfold and merciless
perversities and poisons; with in
vincible ministries of suffering,
and with tremendous dynamics of
destruction and death. Nor would
he have made such a human race

jjas ours is, with its awful talent for
rapacity, treachery, cruelty and
crime. Or if, by some fatal blunder,
jhe had made such a world and such
Ja race to people it, swiftly would he|
'have regenerated or destroyed it, ;
|,both the race and the world. Is notj
jthat what you would have done?
I No flaorefwould your wisest, and]
best man administer the affairs of
this world as they are administered ;
nor would he suffer this race to
work out the history it has worked
out from time immemorial. In-J
stantly would he have corrected the
perversities of nature, neutralized
its poisons, disarmed and destroyed
all their manifold and mighty
agencies which bring hardship,
suffering and death to the world.
He would instantly exterminate
out of human nature its meanness,
viciousness and ferocity, and put
an utter end to all (he frightful
cruelties and crimes which have
drenched human history in tears,
and steeped it in blood; those in
humanities of man to man which
have made the countless millions
mourn. If you had the power,
would not you do this?
And yet, we believe that the al-l
mighty, all-wise and ever-blessed
God created this world, and that
He presides over all its ongoings
from the very least to the very
greatest. True, as it came from His
hand, it was all very good, but He
permitted the fatal blight to fall
upon it, and what one permits when |
he has power to hinder he does. |
And we believe in His almighty
providence; Hissupreme and sover
eign presidency over the world, and
all its affairs from greatest to least.
This belief may take one form or an
other. It may rest on rational, or
on irrational grounds; its effects
may be ennobling or degrading,
but in its germinal principle, itl

seems to be a primary, an intuitive
conviction of the human race. We
believe in the Living God; in His
all-wise and all-powerful provi
dence; that He has never let go of
anv world, or anything, which He
has created; that He has an all
searching supervision, and an infi
nitely easy mastery over all things
absolutely, from suns and systems
down to sparrows and the hairs of
our heads; and most certainly,
over all the multitudinous details
of every individual life. On this,
our faith, our hopes, our consola
tions, our very souls, rest.
Hut most plainly, His thoughts
and His ways are not as ours. Our
lives are ordered not as we would
have ordered them; not as a good
and wise man who loves us would
have ordered them. It is a truism,
almost a moral axiom, —that it is
the unexpected that happens.
Events unexpected and unwelcome
confront us at every turn. Perhaps
there is not one of you here who, if
you could have foreseen all you
have had to come through, but
would have sunk down in discour
agement, if not in despair. Even
of those whose lives may seem to
have been most prosperous, this is
true. Probably such a one as Mrs.
Stanford, whom many regard as
specially fortunate, as one who had
everything to enjoy and little to
suffer, even of her it maybe said,
that if, fifty years ago, she could
have foreseen all that she had to
suffer, she would have been pro
foundly depressed; she would have
shivered and shuddered under the
dark clouds of anticipation. She
had her sorrows, no less keen, prob
ably far more keen, than those of
the humblest servant in her em
ploy.
There is no fellowship more com


View of thk Mosaics in tiie Memorial Chur< h, Bdilt by Mas. Stanford in honor of her Husband
mon to man than the fellowship of
suffering. This brings all to the
same level. The higher levels of
life have heavy shadows no less
than the lower. The heartache of
a millionaire is just like that of aj
hod-carrier. The tear on the cheeky
of a princess is chemically the same
as that on the cheek of the washer-j
woman. No worthy man or woman|
ever yet got through this world
without trials which, if foreseen,
would have cowed the spirit. This
is shown in all the real biographies
of the world, in the Bible and out
side of it. So one of your own
poets (Sophocles) has said,
"Still the long days have brought
Griefs near and nearer yet.
And joys, thou canst not see
One trace of what they were."
So our own Shakspere, that great
est uninspired delineator of human
nature and human experience:
"If this were seen,
The happiest youth viewing his progress
through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
Would shut the book, and sit him down to die."
Our lives may be said to be a
series of surprises, punctuated at
frequent intervals with shocks —
startling and often terrific shocks.
In one way and another, in forms
more or less startling and severe,
these shocks come to all of us in
our lives. Such a shock —great,
sudden, startling, stunning —has
come to this ,'university, to this
commonwealth, to this whole coun
try, in the mysterious departure
out of this world of the noble
woman whose body now lies here,
in this magnificent church, which
her bounty erected "to the glory of
God and in loving memory of her
husband." Of her sudden and sor
rowful taking off, with its puzzles
and problems, it does not become
me to say one word. All that I
must leave to others. Only this I
may say, that in common with
multitudes of others, near and far
away, I sincerely grieve that her
passing was not in the quietness
and peace of her preferred home,
her beautiful country seat near
here, where no doubt many of the
sweetest associations of her life had
their center. It is, however, a com
fort to know that, while she was a
world-round traveler, it pleased
God so to order it that she should
pass away under the flag of
her own country, the country she
loved.
The Sunday after her death it
was my privilege in this place to
give my estimate of the character
and life of Mrs. Stanford. I shall
not repeat what was then said, ex
cept to reaffirm it. She lived a
long life, with varied experiences
and amid various scenes. During
the greater part of her life, her path
lay on the higher levels as regards
wealth and prominence. But the
glamour of this world never daz
zled her eyes nor made her blind,
to the really higher and nobler,
ends of existence. She never lost
her sympathy, her fellow-feeling, 1
with those who lived on lower lev-j
els; with those whom Mr. Lincoln
called the plain people. Like her.
Divine Master, she was never
ashamed to call them her brethren.'
Where is the poor man who ever
cried out against her exactions?
Where is the widow whose heart
was ever wrung, or the orphan
whose eye was ever wet, because
of any oppression or grinding of
liers?

She was exceedingly catholic in
her sympathies, a.s is evident from
the provisions of her will. She
was in close and vital touch with
whatever was pure, good, and holy.
Probably some envied her; perhaps
some even hated her, simply he
cause she whs rich. Well, that is
the way of the world. It is certain
that her heart was not set merely
on material good. She and her
distinguished husband had great
plans for the good of posterity and
of mankind. This university is
their monument. No doubt the
central and controlling purpose of
her life was to carry out the plans
of her husband and herself con
cerning this institution. In the
loneliness of her childlessness and
widowhood, this was the central
and supreme ambition of her soul;
the ambition to found a great uni
versity where the children of the
common people might receive an
education equal to that within
reach of the highest; an institution
magnificently endowed, yet most
democratic; a place where one is
rated not by his birth or fortune,
but simply by his merit; a place
where the son of the day-laborer
stands.on the same level as the son
of the millionaire, —this is the basis
of this university.
Here lies an honored body. Itl
is the material remains of a great!
and potential life. At last, we all!
come to this. L
"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealthe'ergave 9
Await alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
No doubt Mrs. Stanford had her
joys, deep, pure, abounding. No
doubt, also, she had her sorrows.
During the years of her childless
ness and widowhood she slept on
memories as sweet, as holy, and as
painful as death. Hope governs
the horizon of youth, while mem
ory governs that of age. In Mrs.
Stanford's case, however, memory
and hope were beautifully blended.
The memories of the past, so warm;
so fresh, so vital; the shades of the
blessed dead, to her so near, so liv
ing, so companionable—these filled]
half of her horizon. Then, the!
great purposes and plans of herj
husband and herself concerning!
this university; purposes and plans]
thought over, talked over, let us]
hope, prayed over, in many a quiet!
and anxious hour —these filled herj
heart and engaged her most earnest|
activities during these years of hen
widowhood.
Here is a great fortune devoted]
to the welfare of mankind. Here]
is a fountain opened in this West-]
ern land to carry refreshment to]
vast regions of the earth. Here wej
have a striking example of the]
right use of large wealth.
The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.
Departure from the Church.
At the conclusion of the address
Handel's "I Know That My Re
deemer Liveth" was beautifully
sung by Mrs. Arthur Fickenscher,
and the final benediction was said
by Rev. C. M. Hill of Berkeley.
Then as the organ pave out the
strains of Ave Maria, the vast con
gregation rose and moved slowly
out of the church. The funeral
party formed again: the violet
covered casket was raised tenderly
by the pall-bearers, and borne by
their strong arms Mrs. Stanford
passed for the last time out from
the church which she had built and
which she loved so well.

Book on Stanford University.
A second edition of "A Visit to
Stanford University," written by
Mary Stewart Quelle, is now being
printed at the University Press and
will be published early in April.
This work was first published two
years ago. Its purpose is to give
the visitor to Stanford correct and
interesting information about the
University and its surroundings.
It is written in a simple but enter
taining style. The book, which will
contain about one hundred pages,
will be printed on heavy buff paper,
and it will be illustrated with
scores of beatiful half-tone pictures,
many of them of full-page size.
The cover design will be a picture
of the new gateway, printed in three
colors. The price of the volume
will be one dollar, postpaid.

Then as the organ pave out the
strains of Ave Maria, the vast con
gregation rose and moved slowly
out of the church. The funeral
party formed again: the violet
covered casket was raised tenderly
by the pall-bearers, and borne by
their strong arms Mrs. Stanford
passed for the last time out from
the church which she had built and
which she loved so well.

Book on Stanford University.
A second edition of "A Visit to
Stanford University," written by
Mary Stewart Quelle, is now being
printed at the University Press and
will be published early in April.
This work was first published two
years ago. Its purpose is to give
the visitor to Stanford correct and
interesting information about the
University and its surroundings.
It is written in a simple but enter
taining style. The book, which will
contain about one hundred pages,
will be printed on heavy buff paper,
and it will be illustrated with
scores of beatiful half-tone pictures,
many of them of full-page size.
The cover design will be a picture
of the new gateway, printed in three
colors. The price of the volume
will be one dollar, postpaid.
THE grandest and most impress
ive of the scenes that were en
acted about Mrs. Stanford's body
as it moved to its last resting place
was that which occurred in the
Memorial Churoh. In crowded
nave and transepts, in galleries
thronged to their utmost with
mourning students, almost three
thousand men and women were
gathered to pay the world's last
tribute to Mrs. Stanford. From
galleries, nave and transepts three
thousand pairs of eyes were fixed
upon the violet-covered casket that
stood in the beautiful apse of the
church, while from the choir loft
above a hundred student voices
joined with the deep-toned organ.
Thousands Witness the Ceremonies.
At twenty minutes after twelve
o'clock the bronze doors of the
church were swung open, and for
the next hour a steady stream of
students, faculty, delegates and
alumni moved across the thresh
old and were led to the sections al
ready assigned them by the corps
of student ushers. So perfect were
the arrangements that not a min
ute was lost, not a hitch occurred,
and when the column of alumni
that headed the funeral procession
appeared at the entrance not a seat
save those that were awaiting re
mained empty. Not a person re
mained standing in the aisles, and
yet twenty-seven hundred indi
viduals had been admitted. Of
these eleven hundred were students,
two hundred were alumni, two
hundred and twenty-five listed of
ficial delegates, and one hundred
of the faculty. The State was
represented by many officials of
Governor Pardee's staff, and the
State University by President
Wheeler, the deans of its colleges
and student representatives.
The Casket Enters the Church.
Shortly after the alumni division
had entered, the head of the funeral
procession appeared. The vast con
gregation rose and stood reverently
as the casket was borne solemnly
down the main aisle by the eight
student pall-bearers, while from the
organ came the strains of Chopin's
funeral march. After the casket had
been deposited in the apse of the
church the congregation remained
standing while the choir sang:
"To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit,
Who break'st in love this mortal chain,
My life I but from Thee inherit,
And death becomes my chiefest gain,
In Thee I live, in Thee I die,
Content, for Thou art ever nigh."
Many Clergymen Participate.
A prayer was then read by Rev.
William Kirk Guthrie of the First
Presbyterian Church of San Fran
cisco, and was followed by a 'me

morial anthem bv. Dr. B. C. Blod
gett, organist of the Memorial
Church, and the reading of the two
lessons by Rabbi Jacob Voor- 1
sanger of San Francisco and Rev.
Dr. E. R. Dille of Oakland, respec-.
lively. "Lead, Kindly Light," was
sung by Miss Eudora W. Smith,'
followed by a prayer by Bishop
William Ford Nichols, and the me
morial address was then delivered
by Rev. Dr. John \V, Dinsmore of
San Jose.
The Memorial Sermon.
No nobler tribute has been paid
to Mrs. Stanford in words than this
address, which follows:
The words to be spoken here and
now must be few and simple. The
exigencies of the occasion and the'
known tastes of the departed alike
require this brevity and simplicity.
This hour brings to us an impres
sive illustration of the sublime ut
terances of an ancient bard: "Clouds
and darkness are round about Him;
righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of His throne." Also of
an ancient prophet: "My thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts."
Mysteries bewildering and in
scrutable, confront us on every
hand; enigmas perplexing and
painful meet us in every path and
and every day. No good and wise
man, if lie had given the power,
would have made such a world as
this is. He would not have filled
it with millionfold and merciless
perversities and poisons; with in
vincible ministries of suffering,
and with tremendous dynamics of
destruction and death. Nor would
he have made such a human race

jjas ours is, with its awful talent for
rapacity, treachery, cruelty and
crime. Or if, by some fatal blunder,
jhe had made such a world and such
Ja race to people it, swiftly would he|
'have regenerated or destroyed it, ;
|,both the race and the world. Is notj
jthat what you would have done?
I No flaorefwould your wisest, and]
best man administer the affairs of
this world as they are administered ;
nor would he suffer this race to
work out the history it has worked
out from time immemorial. In-J
stantly would he have corrected the
perversities of nature, neutralized
its poisons, disarmed and destroyed
all their manifold and mighty
agencies which bring hardship,
suffering and death to the world.
He would instantly exterminate
out of human nature its meanness,
viciousness and ferocity, and put
an utter end to all (he frightful
cruelties and crimes which have
drenched human history in tears,
and steeped it in blood; those in
humanities of man to man which
have made the countless millions
mourn. If you had the power,
would not you do this?
And yet, we believe that the al-l
mighty, all-wise and ever-blessed
God created this world, and that
He presides over all its ongoings
from the very least to the very
greatest. True, as it came from His
hand, it was all very good, but He
permitted the fatal blight to fall
upon it, and what one permits when |
he has power to hinder he does. |
And we believe in His almighty
providence; Hissupreme and sover
eign presidency over the world, and
all its affairs from greatest to least.
This belief may take one form or an
other. It may rest on rational, or
on irrational grounds; its effects
may be ennobling or degrading,
but in its germinal principle, itl

seems to be a primary, an intuitive
conviction of the human race. We
believe in the Living God; in His
all-wise and all-powerful provi
dence; that He has never let go of
anv world, or anything, which He
has created; that He has an all
searching supervision, and an infi
nitely easy mastery over all things
absolutely, from suns and systems
down to sparrows and the hairs of
our heads; and most certainly,
over all the multitudinous details
of every individual life. On this,
our faith, our hopes, our consola
tions, our very souls, rest.
Hut most plainly, His thoughts
and His ways are not as ours. Our
lives are ordered not as we would
have ordered them; not as a good
and wise man who loves us would
have ordered them. It is a truism,
almost a moral axiom, —that it is
the unexpected that happens.
Events unexpected and unwelcome
confront us at every turn. Perhaps
there is not one of you here who, if
you could have foreseen all you
have had to come through, but
would have sunk down in discour
agement, if not in despair. Even
of those whose lives may seem to
have been most prosperous, this is
true. Probably such a one as Mrs.
Stanford, whom many regard as
specially fortunate, as one who had
everything to enjoy and little to
suffer, even of her it maybe said,
that if, fifty years ago, she could
have foreseen all that she had to
suffer, she would have been pro
foundly depressed; she would have
shivered and shuddered under the
dark clouds of anticipation. She
had her sorrows, no less keen, prob
ably far more keen, than those of
the humblest servant in her em
ploy.
There is no fellowship more com


View of thk Mosaics in tiie Memorial Chur< h, Bdilt by Mas. Stanford in honor of her Husband
mon to man than the fellowship of
suffering. This brings all to the
same level. The higher levels of
life have heavy shadows no less
than the lower. The heartache of
a millionaire is just like that of aj
hod-carrier. The tear on the cheeky
of a princess is chemically the same
as that on the cheek of the washer-j
woman. No worthy man or woman|
ever yet got through this world
without trials which, if foreseen,
would have cowed the spirit. This
is shown in all the real biographies
of the world, in the Bible and out
side of it. So one of your own
poets (Sophocles) has said,
"Still the long days have brought
Griefs near and nearer yet.
And joys, thou canst not see
One trace of what they were."
So our own Shakspere, that great
est uninspired delineator of human
nature and human experience:
"If this were seen,
The happiest youth viewing his progress
through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
Would shut the book, and sit him down to die."
Our lives may be said to be a
series of surprises, punctuated at
frequent intervals with shocks —
startling and often terrific shocks.
In one way and another, in forms
more or less startling and severe,
these shocks come to all of us in
our lives. Such a shock —great,
sudden, startling, stunning —has
come to this ,'university, to this
commonwealth, to this whole coun
try, in the mysterious departure
out of this world of the noble
woman whose body now lies here,
in this magnificent church, which
her bounty erected "to the glory of
God and in loving memory of her
husband." Of her sudden and sor
rowful taking off, with its puzzles
and problems, it does not become
me to say one word. All that I
must leave to others. Only this I
may say, that in common with
multitudes of others, near and far
away, I sincerely grieve that her
passing was not in the quietness
and peace of her preferred home,
her beautiful country seat near
here, where no doubt many of the
sweetest associations of her life had
their center. It is, however, a com
fort to know that, while she was a
world-round traveler, it pleased
God so to order it that she should
pass away under the flag of
her own country, the country she
loved.
The Sunday after her death it
was my privilege in this place to
give my estimate of the character
and life of Mrs. Stanford. I shall
not repeat what was then said, ex
cept to reaffirm it. She lived a
long life, with varied experiences
and amid various scenes. During
the greater part of her life, her path
lay on the higher levels as regards
wealth and prominence. But the
glamour of this world never daz
zled her eyes nor made her blind,
to the really higher and nobler,
ends of existence. She never lost
her sympathy, her fellow-feeling, 1
with those who lived on lower lev-j
els; with those whom Mr. Lincoln
called the plain people. Like her.
Divine Master, she was never
ashamed to call them her brethren.'
Where is the poor man who ever
cried out against her exactions?
Where is the widow whose heart
was ever wrung, or the orphan
whose eye was ever wet, because
of any oppression or grinding of
liers?

She was exceedingly catholic in
her sympathies, a.s is evident from
the provisions of her will. She
was in close and vital touch with
whatever was pure, good, and holy.
Probably some envied her; perhaps
some even hated her, simply he
cause she whs rich. Well, that is
the way of the world. It is certain
that her heart was not set merely
on material good. She and her
distinguished husband had great
plans for the good of posterity and
of mankind. This university is
their monument. No doubt the
central and controlling purpose of
her life was to carry out the plans
of her husband and herself con
cerning this institution. In the
loneliness of her childlessness and
widowhood, this was the central
and supreme ambition of her soul;
the ambition to found a great uni
versity where the children of the
common people might receive an
education equal to that within
reach of the highest; an institution
magnificently endowed, yet most
democratic; a place where one is
rated not by his birth or fortune,
but simply by his merit; a place
where the son of the day-laborer
stands.on the same level as the son
of the millionaire, —this is the basis
of this university.
Here lies an honored body. Itl
is the material remains of a great!
and potential life. At last, we all!
come to this. L
"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealthe'ergave 9
Await alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
No doubt Mrs. Stanford had her
joys, deep, pure, abounding. No
doubt, also, she had her sorrows.
During the years of her childless
ness and widowhood she slept on
memories as sweet, as holy, and as
painful as death. Hope governs
the horizon of youth, while mem
ory governs that of age. In Mrs.
Stanford's case, however, memory
and hope were beautifully blended.
The memories of the past, so warm;
so fresh, so vital; the shades of the
blessed dead, to her so near, so liv
ing, so companionable—these filled]
half of her horizon. Then, the!
great purposes and plans of herj
husband and herself concerning!
this university; purposes and plans]
thought over, talked over, let us]
hope, prayed over, in many a quiet!
and anxious hour —these filled herj
heart and engaged her most earnest|
activities during these years of hen
widowhood.
Here is a great fortune devoted]
to the welfare of mankind. Here]
is a fountain opened in this West-]
ern land to carry refreshment to]
vast regions of the earth. Here wej
have a striking example of the]
right use of large wealth.
The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.
Departure from the Church.
At the conclusion of the address
Handel's "I Know That My Re
deemer Liveth" was beautifully
sung by Mrs. Arthur Fickenscher,
and the final benediction was said
by Rev. C. M. Hill of Berkeley.
Then as the organ pave out the
strains of Ave Maria, the vast con
gregation rose and moved slowly

party formed again: the violet

their strong arms Mrs. Stanford
passed for the last time out from
the church which she had built and
which she loved so well.

The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.
Departure from the Church.
At the conclusion of the address
Handel's "I Know That My Re
deemer Liveth" was beautifully
sung by Mrs. Arthur Fickenscher,
and the final benediction was said
by Rev. C. M. Hill of Berkeley.
Then as the organ pave out the
strains of Ave Maria, the vast con
gregation rose and moved slowly
out of the church. The funeral
party formed again: the violet
covered casket was raised tenderly
by the pall-bearers, and borne by
their strong arms Mrs. Stanford
passed for the last time out from
the church which she had built and
which she loved so well.

Book on Stanford University.
A second edition of "A Visit to
Stanford University," written by
Mary Stewart Quelle, is now being
printed at the University Press and
will be published early in April.
This work was first published two
years ago. Its purpose is to give
the visitor to Stanford correct and
interesting information about the
University and its surroundings.
It is written in a simple but enter
taining style. The book, which will
contain about one hundred pages,
will be printed on heavy buff paper,
and it will be illustrated with
scores of beatiful half-tone pictures,
many of them of full-page size.
The cover design will be a picture
of the new gateway, printed in three
colors. The price of the volume
will be one dollar, postpaid.
THE grandest and most impress
ive of the scenes that were en
acted about Mrs. Stanford's body
as it moved to its last resting place
was that which occurred in the
Memorial Churoh. In crowded
nave and transepts, in galleries
thronged to their utmost with
mourning students, almost three
thousand men and women were
gathered to pay the world's last
tribute to Mrs. Stanford. From
galleries, nave and transepts three
thousand pairs of eyes were fixed
upon the violet-covered casket that
stood in the beautiful apse of the
church, while from the choir loft
above a hundred student voices
joined with the deep-toned organ.
Thousands Witness the Ceremonies.
At twenty minutes after twelve
o'clock the bronze doors of the
church were swung open, and for
the next hour a steady stream of
students, faculty, delegates and
alumni moved across the thresh
old and were led to the sections al
ready assigned them by the corps
of student ushers. So perfect were
the arrangements that not a min
ute was lost, not a hitch occurred,
and when the column of alumni
that headed the funeral procession
appeared at the entrance not a seat
save those that were awaiting re
mained empty. Not a person re
mained standing in the aisles, and
yet twenty-seven hundred indi
viduals had been admitted. Of
these eleven hundred were students,
two hundred were alumni, two
hundred and twenty-five listed of
ficial delegates, and one hundred
of the faculty. The State was
represented by many officials of
Governor Pardee's staff, and the
State University by President
Wheeler, the deans of its colleges
and student representatives.
The Casket Enters the Church.
Shortly after the alumni division
had entered, the head of the funeral
procession appeared. The vast con
gregation rose and stood reverently
as the casket was borne solemnly
down the main aisle by the eight
student pall-bearers, while from the
organ came the strains of Chopin's
funeral march. After the casket had
been deposited in the apse of the
church the congregation remained
standing while the choir sang:
"To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit,
Who break'st in love this mortal chain,
My life I but from Thee inherit,
And death becomes my chiefest gain,
In Thee I live, in Thee I die,
Content, for Thou art ever nigh."
Many Clergymen Participate.
A prayer was then read by Rev.
William Kirk Guthrie of the First
Presbyterian Church of San Fran
cisco, and was followed by a 'me

morial anthem bv. Dr. B. C. Blod
gett, organist of the Memorial
Church, and the reading of the two
lessons by Rabbi Jacob Voor- 1
sanger of San Francisco and Rev.
Dr. E. R. Dille of Oakland, respec-.
lively. "Lead, Kindly Light," was
sung by Miss Eudora W. Smith,'
followed by a prayer by Bishop
William Ford Nichols, and the me
morial address was then delivered
by Rev. Dr. John \V, Dinsmore of
San Jose.
The Memorial Sermon.
No nobler tribute has been paid
to Mrs. Stanford in words than this
address, which follows:
The words to be spoken here and
now must be few and simple. The
exigencies of the occasion and the'
known tastes of the departed alike
require this brevity and simplicity.
This hour brings to us an impres
sive illustration of the sublime ut
terances of an ancient bard: "Clouds
and darkness are round about Him;
righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of His throne." Also of
an ancient prophet: "My thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts."
Mysteries bewildering and in
scrutable, confront us on every
hand; enigmas perplexing and
painful meet us in every path and
and every day. No good and wise
man, if lie had given the power,
would have made such a world as
this is. He would not have filled
it with millionfold and merciless
perversities and poisons; with in
vincible ministries of suffering,
and with tremendous dynamics of
destruction and death. Nor would
he have made such a human race

jjas ours is, with its awful talent for
rapacity, treachery, cruelty and
crime. Or if, by some fatal blunder,
jhe had made such a world and such
Ja race to people it, swiftly would he|
'have regenerated or destroyed it, ;
|,both the race and the world. Is notj
jthat what you would have done?
I No flaorefwould your wisest, and]
best man administer the affairs of
this world as they are administered ;
nor would he suffer this race to
work out the history it has worked
out from time immemorial. In-J
stantly would he have corrected the
perversities of nature, neutralized
its poisons, disarmed and destroyed
all their manifold and mighty
agencies which bring hardship,
suffering and death to the world.
He would instantly exterminate
out of human nature its meanness,
viciousness and ferocity, and put
an utter end to all (he frightful
cruelties and crimes which have
drenched human history in tears,
and steeped it in blood; those in
humanities of man to man which
have made the countless millions
mourn. If you had the power,
would not you do this?
And yet, we believe that the al-l
mighty, all-wise and ever-blessed
God created this world, and that
He presides over all its ongoings
from the very least to the very
greatest. True, as it came from His
hand, it was all very good, but He
permitted the fatal blight to fall
upon it, and what one permits when |
he has power to hinder he does. |
And we believe in His almighty
providence; Hissupreme and sover
eign presidency over the world, and
all its affairs from greatest to least.
This belief may take one form or an
other. It may rest on rational, or
on irrational grounds; its effects
may be ennobling or degrading,
but in its germinal principle, itl

seems to be a primary, an intuitive
conviction of the human race. We
believe in the Living God; in His
all-wise and all-powerful provi
dence; that He has never let go of
anv world, or anything, which He
has created; that He has an all
searching supervision, and an infi
nitely easy mastery over all things
absolutely, from suns and systems
down to sparrows and the hairs of
our heads; and most certainly,
over all the multitudinous details
of every individual life. On this,
our faith, our hopes, our consola
tions, our very souls, rest.
Hut most plainly, His thoughts
and His ways are not as ours. Our
lives are ordered not as we would
have ordered them; not as a good
and wise man who loves us would
have ordered them. It is a truism,
almost a moral axiom, —that it is
the unexpected that happens.
Events unexpected and unwelcome
confront us at every turn. Perhaps
there is not one of you here who, if
you could have foreseen all you
have had to come through, but
would have sunk down in discour
agement, if not in despair. Even
of those whose lives may seem to
have been most prosperous, this is
true. Probably such a one as Mrs.
Stanford, whom many regard as
specially fortunate, as one who had
everything to enjoy and little to
suffer, even of her it maybe said,
that if, fifty years ago, she could
have foreseen all that she had to
suffer, she would have been pro
foundly depressed; she would have
shivered and shuddered under the
dark clouds of anticipation. She
had her sorrows, no less keen, prob
ably far more keen, than those of
the humblest servant in her em
ploy.
There is no fellowship more com


View of thk Mosaics in tiie Memorial Chur< h, Bdilt by Mas. Stanford in honor of her Husband
mon to man than the fellowship of
suffering. This brings all to the
same level. The higher levels of
life have heavy shadows no less
than the lower. The heartache of
a millionaire is just like that of aj
hod-carrier. The tear on the cheeky
of a princess is chemically the same
as that on the cheek of the washer-j
woman. No worthy man or woman|
ever yet got through this world
without trials which, if foreseen,
would have cowed the spirit. This
is shown in all the real biographies
of the world, in the Bible and out
side of it. So one of your own
poets (Sophocles) has said,
"Still the long days have brought
Griefs near and nearer yet.
And joys, thou canst not see
One trace of what they were."
So our own Shakspere, that great
est uninspired delineator of human
nature and human experience:
"If this were seen,
The happiest youth viewing his progress
through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
Would shut the book, and sit him down to die."
Our lives may be said to be a
series of surprises, punctuated at
frequent intervals with shocks —
startling and often terrific shocks.
In one way and another, in forms
more or less startling and severe,
these shocks come to all of us in
our lives. Such a shock —great,
sudden, startling, stunning —has
come to this ,'university, to this
commonwealth, to this whole coun
try, in the mysterious departure
out of this world of the noble
woman whose body now lies here,
in this magnificent church, which
her bounty erected "to the glory of
God and in loving memory of her
husband." Of her sudden and sor
rowful taking off, with its puzzles
and problems, it does not become
me to say one word. All that I
must leave to others. Only this I
may say, that in common with
multitudes of others, near and far
away, I sincerely grieve that her
passing was not in the quietness
and peace of her preferred home,
her beautiful country seat near
here, where no doubt many of the
sweetest associations of her life had
their center. It is, however, a com
fort to know that, while she was a
world-round traveler, it pleased
God so to order it that she should
pass away under the flag of
her own country, the country she
loved.
The Sunday after her death it
was my privilege in this place to
give my estimate of the character
and life of Mrs. Stanford. I shall
not repeat what was then said, ex
cept to reaffirm it. She lived a
long life, with varied experiences
and amid various scenes. During
the greater part of her life, her path
lay on the higher levels as regards
wealth and prominence. But the
glamour of this world never daz
zled her eyes nor made her blind,
to the really higher and nobler,
ends of existence. She never lost
her sympathy, her fellow-feeling, 1
with those who lived on lower lev-j
els; with those whom Mr. Lincoln
called the plain people. Like her.
Divine Master, she was never
ashamed to call them her brethren.'
Where is the poor man who ever
cried out against her exactions?
Where is the widow whose heart
was ever wrung, or the orphan
whose eye was ever wet, because
of any oppression or grinding of
liers?

She was exceedingly catholic in
her sympathies, a.s is evident from
the provisions of her will. She
was in close and vital touch with
whatever was pure, good, and holy.
Probably some envied her; perhaps
some even hated her, simply he
cause she whs rich. Well, that is
the way of the world. It is certain
that her heart was not set merely
on material good. She and her
distinguished husband had great
plans for the good of posterity and
of mankind. This university is
their monument. No doubt the
central and controlling purpose of
her life was to carry out the plans
of her husband and herself con
cerning this institution. In the
loneliness of her childlessness and
widowhood, this was the central
and supreme ambition of her soul;
the ambition to found a great uni
versity where the children of the
common people might receive an
education equal to that within
reach of the highest; an institution
magnificently endowed, yet most
democratic; a place where one is
rated not by his birth or fortune,
but simply by his merit; a place
where the son of the day-laborer
stands.on the same level as the son
of the millionaire, —this is the basis
of this university.
Here lies an honored body. Itl
is the material remains of a great!
and potential life. At last, we all!
come to this. L
"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealthe'ergave 9
Await alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
No doubt Mrs. Stanford had her
joys, deep, pure, abounding. No
doubt, also, she had her sorrows.
During the years of her childless
ness and widowhood she slept on
memories as sweet, as holy, and as
painful as death. Hope governs
the horizon of youth, while mem
ory governs that of age. In Mrs.
Stanford's case, however, memory
and hope were beautifully blended.
The memories of the past, so warm;
so fresh, so vital; the shades of the
blessed dead, to her so near, so liv
ing, so companionable—these filled]
half of her horizon. Then, the!
great purposes and plans of herj
husband and herself concerning!
this university; purposes and plans]
thought over, talked over, let us]
hope, prayed over, in many a quiet!
and anxious hour —these filled herj
heart and engaged her most earnest|
activities during these years of hen
widowhood.
Here is a great fortune devoted]
to the welfare of mankind. Here]
is a fountain opened in this West-]
ern land to carry refreshment to]
vast regions of the earth. Here wej
have a striking example of the]
right use of large wealth.
The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.

During the years of her childless
ness and widowhood she slept on
memories as sweet, as holy, and as
painful as death. Hope governs
the horizon of youth, while mem
ory governs that of age. In Mrs.
Stanford's case, however, memory
and hope were beautifully blended.
The memories of the past, so warm;
so fresh, so vital; the shades of the
blessed dead, to her so near, so liv
ing, so companionable—these filled]
half of her horizon. Then, the!
great purposes and plans of herj
husband and herself concerning!
this university; purposes and plans]
thought over, talked over, let us]
hope, prayed over, in many a quiet!
and anxious hour —these filled herj
heart and engaged her most earnest|
activities during these years of hen
widowhood.
Here is a great fortune devoted]
to the welfare of mankind. Here]
is a fountain opened in this West-]
ern land to carry refreshment to]
vast regions of the earth. Here wej
have a striking example of the]
right use of large wealth.
The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.
Departure from the Church.
At the conclusion of the address
Handel's "I Know That My Re
deemer Liveth" was beautifully
sung by Mrs. Arthur Fickenscher,
and the final benediction was said
by Rev. C. M. Hill of Berkeley.
Then as the organ pave out the
strains of Ave Maria, the vast con
gregation rose and moved slowly
out of the church. The funeral
party formed again: the violet
covered casket was raised tenderly
by the pall-bearers, and borne by
their strong arms Mrs. Stanford
passed for the last time out from
the church which she had built and
which she loved so well.

Book on Stanford University.
A second edition of "A Visit to
Stanford University," written by
Mary Stewart Quelle, is now being
printed at the University Press and
will be published early in April.
This work was first published two
years ago. Its purpose is to give
the visitor to Stanford correct and
interesting information about the
University and its surroundings.
It is written in a simple but enter
taining style. The book, which will
contain about one hundred pages,
will be printed on heavy buff paper,
and it will be illustrated with
scores of beatiful half-tone pictures,
many of them of full-page size.
The cover design will be a picture
of the new gateway, printed in three
colors. The price of the volume
will be one dollar, postpaid.
THE grandest and most impress
ive of the scenes that were en
acted about Mrs. Stanford's body
as it moved to its last resting place
was that which occurred in the
Memorial Churoh. In crowded
nave and transepts, in galleries
thronged to their utmost with
mourning students, almost three
thousand men and women were
gathered to pay the world's last
tribute to Mrs. Stanford. From
galleries, nave and transepts three
thousand pairs of eyes were fixed
upon the violet-covered casket that
stood in the beautiful apse of the
church, while from the choir loft
above a hundred student voices
joined with the deep-toned organ.
Thousands Witness the Ceremonies.
At twenty minutes after twelve
o'clock the bronze doors of the
church were swung open, and for
the next hour a steady stream of
students, faculty, delegates and
alumni moved across the thresh
old and were led to the sections al
ready assigned them by the corps
of student ushers. So perfect were
the arrangements that not a min
ute was lost, not a hitch occurred,
and when the column of alumni
that headed the funeral procession
appeared at the entrance not a seat
save those that were awaiting re
mained empty. Not a person re
mained standing in the aisles, and
yet twenty-seven hundred indi
viduals had been admitted. Of
these eleven hundred were students,
two hundred were alumni, two
hundred and twenty-five listed of
ficial delegates, and one hundred
of the faculty. The State was
represented by many officials of
Governor Pardee's staff, and the
State University by President
Wheeler, the deans of its colleges
and student representatives.
The Casket Enters the Church.
Shortly after the alumni division
had entered, the head of the funeral
procession appeared. The vast con
gregation rose and stood reverently
as the casket was borne solemnly
down the main aisle by the eight
student pall-bearers, while from the
organ came the strains of Chopin's
funeral march. After the casket had
been deposited in the apse of the
church the congregation remained
standing while the choir sang:
"To Thee, O Lord, I yield my spirit,
Who break'st in love this mortal chain,
My life I but from Thee inherit,
And death becomes my chiefest gain,
In Thee I live, in Thee I die,
Content, for Thou art ever nigh."
Many Clergymen Participate.
A prayer was then read by Rev.
William Kirk Guthrie of the First
Presbyterian Church of San Fran
cisco, and was followed by a 'me

morial anthem bv. Dr. B. C. Blod
gett, organist of the Memorial
Church, and the reading of the two
lessons by Rabbi Jacob Voor- 1
sanger of San Francisco and Rev.
Dr. E. R. Dille of Oakland, respec-.
lively. "Lead, Kindly Light," was
sung by Miss Eudora W. Smith,'
followed by a prayer by Bishop
William Ford Nichols, and the me
morial address was then delivered
by Rev. Dr. John \V, Dinsmore of
San Jose.
The Memorial Sermon.
No nobler tribute has been paid
to Mrs. Stanford in words than this
address, which follows:
The words to be spoken here and
now must be few and simple. The
exigencies of the occasion and the'
known tastes of the departed alike
require this brevity and simplicity.
This hour brings to us an impres
sive illustration of the sublime ut
terances of an ancient bard: "Clouds
and darkness are round about Him;
righteousness and judgment are the
habitation of His throne." Also of
an ancient prophet: "My thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are
your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts
than your thoughts."
Mysteries bewildering and in
scrutable, confront us on every
hand; enigmas perplexing and
painful meet us in every path and
and every day. No good and wise
man, if lie had given the power,
would have made such a world as
this is. He would not have filled
it with millionfold and merciless
perversities and poisons; with in
vincible ministries of suffering,
and with tremendous dynamics of
destruction and death. Nor would
he have made such a human race

jjas ours is, with its awful talent for
rapacity, treachery, cruelty and
crime. Or if, by some fatal blunder,
jhe had made such a world and such
Ja race to people it, swiftly would he|
'have regenerated or destroyed it, ;
|,both the race and the world. Is notj
jthat what you would have done?
I No flaorefwould your wisest, and]
best man administer the affairs of
this world as they are administered ;
nor would he suffer this race to
work out the history it has worked
out from time immemorial. In-J
stantly would he have corrected the
perversities of nature, neutralized
its poisons, disarmed and destroyed
all their manifold and mighty
agencies which bring hardship,
suffering and death to the world.
He would instantly exterminate
out of human nature its meanness,
viciousness and ferocity, and put
an utter end to all (he frightful
cruelties and crimes which have
drenched human history in tears,
and steeped it in blood; those in
humanities of man to man which
have made the countless millions
mourn. If you had the power,
would not you do this?
And yet, we believe that the al-l
mighty, all-wise and ever-blessed
God created this world, and that
He presides over all its ongoings
from the very least to the very
greatest. True, as it came from His
hand, it was all very good, but He
permitted the fatal blight to fall
upon it, and what one permits when |
he has power to hinder he does. |
And we believe in His almighty
providence; Hissupreme and sover
eign presidency over the world, and
all its affairs from greatest to least.
This belief may take one form or an
other. It may rest on rational, or
on irrational grounds; its effects
may be ennobling or degrading,
but in its germinal principle, itl

seems to be a primary, an intuitive
conviction of the human race. We
believe in the Living God; in His
all-wise and all-powerful provi
dence; that He has never let go of
anv world, or anything, which He
has created; that He has an all
searching supervision, and an infi
nitely easy mastery over all things
absolutely, from suns and systems
down to sparrows and the hairs of
our heads; and most certainly,
over all the multitudinous details
of every individual life. On this,
our faith, our hopes, our consola
tions, our very souls, rest.
Hut most plainly, His thoughts
and His ways are not as ours. Our
lives are ordered not as we would
have ordered them; not as a good
and wise man who loves us would
have ordered them. It is a truism,
almost a moral axiom, —that it is
the unexpected that happens.
Events unexpected and unwelcome
confront us at every turn. Perhaps
there is not one of you here who, if
you could have foreseen all you
have had to come through, but
would have sunk down in discour
agement, if not in despair. Even
of those whose lives may seem to
have been most prosperous, this is
true. Probably such a one as Mrs.
Stanford, whom many regard as
specially fortunate, as one who had
everything to enjoy and little to
suffer, even of her it maybe said,
that if, fifty years ago, she could
have foreseen all that she had to
suffer, she would have been pro
foundly depressed; she would have
shivered and shuddered under the
dark clouds of anticipation. She
had her sorrows, no less keen, prob
ably far more keen, than those of
the humblest servant in her em
ploy.
There is no fellowship more com


View of thk Mosaics in tiie Memorial Chur< h, Bdilt by Mas. Stanford in honor of her Husband
mon to man than the fellowship of
suffering. This brings all to the
same level. The higher levels of
life have heavy shadows no less
than the lower. The heartache of
a millionaire is just like that of aj
hod-carrier. The tear on the cheeky
of a princess is chemically the same
as that on the cheek of the washer-j
woman. No worthy man or woman|
ever yet got through this world
without trials which, if foreseen,
would have cowed the spirit. This
is shown in all the real biographies
of the world, in the Bible and out
side of it. So one of your own
poets (Sophocles) has said,
"Still the long days have brought
Griefs near and nearer yet.
And joys, thou canst not see
One trace of what they were."
So our own Shakspere, that great
est uninspired delineator of human
nature and human experience:
"If this were seen,
The happiest youth viewing his progress
through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
Would shut the book, and sit him down to die."
Our lives may be said to be a
series of surprises, punctuated at
frequent intervals with shocks —
startling and often terrific shocks.
In one way and another, in forms
more or less startling and severe,
these shocks come to all of us in
our lives. Such a shock —great,
sudden, startling, stunning —has
come to this ,'university, to this
commonwealth, to this whole coun
try, in the mysterious departure
out of this world of the noble
woman whose body now lies here,
in this magnificent church, which
her bounty erected "to the glory of
God and in loving memory of her
husband." Of her sudden and sor
rowful taking off, with its puzzles
and problems, it does not become
me to say one word. All that I
must leave to others. Only this I
may say, that in common with
multitudes of others, near and far
away, I sincerely grieve that her
passing was not in the quietness
and peace of her preferred home,
her beautiful country seat near
here, where no doubt many of the
sweetest associations of her life had
their center. It is, however, a com
fort to know that, while she was a
world-round traveler, it pleased
God so to order it that she should
pass away under the flag of
her own country, the country she
loved.
The Sunday after her death it
was my privilege in this place to
give my estimate of the character
and life of Mrs. Stanford. I shall
not repeat what was then said, ex
cept to reaffirm it. She lived a
long life, with varied experiences
and amid various scenes. During
the greater part of her life, her path
lay on the higher levels as regards
wealth and prominence. But the
glamour of this world never daz
zled her eyes nor made her blind,
to the really higher and nobler,
ends of existence. She never lost
her sympathy, her fellow-feeling, 1
with those who lived on lower lev-j
els; with those whom Mr. Lincoln
called the plain people. Like her.
Divine Master, she was never
ashamed to call them her brethren.'
Where is the poor man who ever
cried out against her exactions?
Where is the widow whose heart
was ever wrung, or the orphan
whose eye was ever wet, because
of any oppression or grinding of
liers?

She was exceedingly catholic in
her sympathies, a.s is evident from
the provisions of her will. She
was in close and vital touch with
whatever was pure, good, and holy.
Probably some envied her; perhaps
some even hated her, simply he
cause she whs rich. Well, that is
the way of the world. It is certain
that her heart was not set merely
on material good. She and her
distinguished husband had great
plans for the good of posterity and
of mankind. This university is
their monument. No doubt the
central and controlling purpose of
her life was to carry out the plans
of her husband and herself con
cerning this institution. In the
loneliness of her childlessness and
widowhood, this was the central
and supreme ambition of her soul;
the ambition to found a great uni
versity where the children of the
common people might receive an
education equal to that within
reach of the highest; an institution
magnificently endowed, yet most
democratic; a place where one is
rated not by his birth or fortune,
but simply by his merit; a place
where the son of the day-laborer
stands.on the same level as the son
of the millionaire, —this is the basis
of this university.
Here lies an honored body. Itl
is the material remains of a great!
and potential life. At last, we all!
come to this. L
"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealthe'ergave 9
Await alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
No doubt Mrs. Stanford had her
joys, deep, pure, abounding. No
doubt, also, she had her sorrows.
During the years of her childless
ness and widowhood she slept on
memories as sweet, as holy, and as
painful as death. Hope governs
the horizon of youth, while mem
ory governs that of age. In Mrs.
Stanford's case, however, memory
and hope were beautifully blended.
The memories of the past, so warm;
so fresh, so vital; the shades of the
blessed dead, to her so near, so liv
ing, so companionable—these filled]
half of her horizon. Then, the!
great purposes and plans of herj
husband and herself concerning!
this university; purposes and plans]
thought over, talked over, let us]
hope, prayed over, in many a quiet!
and anxious hour —these filled herj
heart and engaged her most earnest|
activities during these years of hen
widowhood.
Here is a great fortune devoted]
to the welfare of mankind. Here]
is a fountain opened in this West-]
ern land to carry refreshment to]
vast regions of the earth. Here wej
have a striking example of the]
right use of large wealth.
The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.

of her husband and herself con
cerning this institution. In the
loneliness of her childlessness and
widowhood, this was the central
and supreme ambition of her soul;
the ambition to found a great uni
versity where the children of the
common people might receive an
education equal to that within
reach of the highest; an institution
magnificently endowed, yet most
democratic; a place where one is
rated not by his birth or fortune,
but simply by his merit; a place
where the son of the day-laborer
stands.on the same level as the son
of the millionaire, —this is the basis
of this university.
Here lies an honored body. Itl
is the material remains of a great!
and potential life. At last, we all!
come to this. L
"The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealthe'ergave 9
Await alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
No doubt Mrs. Stanford had her
joys, deep, pure, abounding. No
doubt, also, she had her sorrows.
During the years of her childless
ness and widowhood she slept on
memories as sweet, as holy, and as
painful as death. Hope governs
the horizon of youth, while mem
ory governs that of age. In Mrs.
Stanford's case, however, memory
and hope were beautifully blended.
The memories of the past, so warm;
so fresh, so vital; the shades of the
blessed dead, to her so near, so liv
ing, so companionable—these filled]
half of her horizon. Then, the!
great purposes and plans of herj
husband and herself concerning!
this university; purposes and plans]
thought over, talked over, let us]
hope, prayed over, in many a quiet!
and anxious hour —these filled herj
heart and engaged her most earnest|
activities during these years of hen
widowhood.
Here is a great fortune devoted]
to the welfare of mankind. Here]
is a fountain opened in this West-]
ern land to carry refreshment to]
vast regions of the earth. Here wej
have a striking example of the]
right use of large wealth.
The body of Senator Stanford!
sleeps quietly in yonder mausoleum.!
The body of his son lies by his!
side. Now, we are about to lay
the body of the wife and mother
between them. They are dead,
and their faces shall no more be
seen, nor shall their voices be
heard among men. But their
works do follow them. This great
university shall live while the earth
endures. Here thousands and tens
of thousands of youth shall gather
in the coming years; along these
corridors they shall walk; in these;
rooms they shall recite; in these
libraries they shall read; in this
great church they shall worship;,
[and from hence shall go out,
through all coming time, streams'

[to refresh the land and to bless the
world.
They do rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them.
Departure from the Church.
At the conclusion of the address
Handel's "I Know That My Re
deemer Liveth" was beautifully
sung by Mrs. Arthur Fickenscher,
and the final benediction was said
by Rev. C. M. Hill of Berkeley.
Then as the organ pave out the
strains of Ave Maria, the vast con
gregation rose and moved slowly
out of the church. The funeral
party formed again: the violet
covered casket was raised tenderly
by the pall-bearers, and borne by
their strong arms Mrs. Stanford
passed for the last time out from
the church which she had built and
which she loved so well.
