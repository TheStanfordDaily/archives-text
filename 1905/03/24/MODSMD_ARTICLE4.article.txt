To-day iB our day of greatest sor
row. We have laid in the tomb the
body of Jane LathropStanford,who,
with her husband, was the joint
founder of this university. A great
part of the plans made in common
for the upbuilding of a great insti
tution of learning in memory of a
beloved son Mtb. Stanford was left
by death to carry out unaided; and
this she accomplished with such
success that the world stood aston
ished. With her brave and in
domitable spirit phe carried the in
stitution through crises which would
have shaken strong men. She fought
for the very existence of the uni
versity; and having given it
strong life, stripped herself of her
great wealth to make sure its fu
ture. And as to the energy and
generosity of Jane Lathrop Stan
ford must be largely credited the
firm basis upon which the univer
sity stands to-day,so to her insight
and common sense we must credit
many of the sound principles that
have governed the conduct of the
university in the past and will
continue to guide in the future, —
those broad principles of democracy
which make the four years of study
here so memorable a part of one's
life. Those faults in Jane Lathrop
Stanford which we recognize disap
pear when we regard her virtues.
The mortal remains of this noble,
great-hearted woman —"all that re
mains on earth of this honored and
generous family"—are laid in the
tomb. We have but the memory:
that, we will cherish until we our
selves are gathered to our rest.
