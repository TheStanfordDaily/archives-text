# With Solemn Ritual and Beautiful Song Body is Finally Committed to the Grave
## Services in Open Air Before the Stately Granite mausoleum. 
### 
THE services at the mausoleum
were brief and were charac
terized by an impressive simplicity.
The program at the tomb was
short, consisting of two hymns by
the Memorial Church choir and an
address by Rev. Dr. Charles R.
Brown of the First Congregational
Church of Oakland, and closing
with the singing of "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail." The scene at the per
formance of the final rites was in
many respects a remarkable one,
long to be remembered. A great
crowd had gathered at the mauso
leum early in the afternoon, long
before the arrival of the funeral
procession. The hundreds that
were unable to gain admittance to
the services in the Memorial
Church turned down through the
arboretum to be present at the ser
vices at the tomb. Here they were
formed in a great circle about the
space reserved in front of the tomb.
A long line of people several rows
deep stretched on either side far
down the roadway and the main
auenue over which the cortege was
to pass.
In the large reserved space in'
front of the mausoleum the places
for the various delegations had
been set aside. The magnificent
floral tributes were placed to the
left upon the lawn; only a few of
them adorned the tomb. An or
chid canopy was erected in front,
under which the body was to rest
during the services.
The Gathering at the Mausoleum.
As the funeral procession, headed
by the men of the Freshman class,
approached, a hushed silence fell
upon the crowd. The two double
lines of students, with bared heads,
marched up the avenue in slow,
measured paces, and passed
through the crowd, which stood
respectfully back. Tlve four classes
took their places around the edge
of the reserved circle. They were
followed by the choir, which
marched directly forward to the
mausoleum and took its stand to
the right, just in front of the tomb.
Following the choir the alumni in
a body, the faculty, and the friends,
special delegates, and employes
took stations within the reserved
space. The immediate relatives
and friends were seated at the left

of the space for the casket, the
remaining portion of the cortege
standing.
The Casket at the Tomb.
The approach of the hearse bear
ing the remains of Mrs. Stanford
was accompanied by absolute still
ness. The student bearers placed
the casket beneath the canopy, im
mediately in front of the door of
the mausoleum. The officiating
clergymen took their places on the
steps of the tomb, and the final
services were begun.
Address by Rev. Dr. Brown.
The choir led in singing the
opening hymn, "Sun of My Soul,
Thou Savior Dear." Dr. Brown
then addressed the assemblage,
paying an eloquent tribute to Mrs.
Stanford. He spoke as follows:
We have reached the pluce where
we are to render this last sad office
to all that remains on earth of this
honored and generous family. The
dust returns to du6t as it was, but
the memory of what they have been
and have done will abide here for
ever, and the helpful influence of
the service they have rendered will
rest unceasingly upon our State
and our nation, and upon the
young manhood and womanhood
of lands across the sea.
The high office of sorrow has been
abundantly declared in literature,
in art and in life. The sweet singer oi
Israel, looking back upon the su
preme bereavement of his life, said:
"Thou hast enlarged me when I
was in distress," —the suffering had
served to widen the range of his
sympathies and to extend his pur
pose of usefulness. One of the
most widely read poems in the
English language sprang from
Tennyson's sorrow over the death
of his friend Hallam.
The loveliest building which
adornß the earth, the Taj Mahal,
grew out of the sorrow of a gener
ous man over the death of his de
voted wife. The strains of that
•'Funeral March and Seraphic
Chant" by Guilmant, which alone
is able to contend for pre-eminence
in that field with the celebrated
composition of Chopin, was written
within three days after the death
of the composer's mother. Some
how the eyes that have been washed

with tears, come to have a clearer
vision of the beauty of holiness and
of service and of God.
We think of all this as we gather
here around this mausoleum and
under the shadow of these noble
university buildings. It was far
away in sunny Italy that the light
died out of the sky for these de
voted parents. Possessed of ample
means and with the highest aspir
ations for the development and
usefulness of their only son, it
seemed, when he died, that the
very purpose of existence for them
was utterly gone.
But in the very hour of this
overwhelming sadness, Senator
Stanford rose up and said, "The
children of California shall be my
children" —and the plans for this
splendid institution began to take
shape in his mind. And from the
very place where mother-love
seemed to go down in defeat before
the stroke of death, this noble
woman came forth with a tender,
gracious interest in all the boys
and girls who in years to come
would gather here upon her own
estate and within these goodly

buildings to receive training and
equipment for that life of useful
service which she would have
chosen for her own son. The old
word of the Psalmist was again
made flesh, for God enlarged them
when they were in distress until
their generous purpose included a
multitude of sons and daughters
which no man as yet can number.
It is not for me to utter here
those words of personal eulogy
which are upon all our lips. Look
up and out upon these Btately
buildings I Look into the faces of
the serious and cultured men who
compose the faculty 1 Look upon
the faces of promise which belong
to the alumni and the student
bodyl Let your vision stretch on
into the future and include the in
numberable company yet to be
blessed by the benefactions of this
university, and you will read the
eulogy which needs no word of
mine!

Africa, far inland, the faithful
