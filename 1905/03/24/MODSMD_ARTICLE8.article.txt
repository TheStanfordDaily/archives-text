# From Grief to Life.
## 
### 
She grieved, grieved with, a lonely mother's grief,
But not in self-bound sorrow spent her days,
Nor yet in lifeless marble sought to raise
A column ; no, for though the years were brief,
With faith in a loving God and firm belief
In man, she planted here a sun-kissed seed,
Which, growing, tells how she in useful deed
And love-ennobled action found relief.
We grieve, for she who wrought for us is gone;
With moistened eyes we view this living stone,
And reverent stand in silence, sad and lone,
While sunset fades; but with the brightening dawn
We'll rise and work, like her, with nobler zest,
Turn grief to life, prove worthy her bequest.
E, K. P
