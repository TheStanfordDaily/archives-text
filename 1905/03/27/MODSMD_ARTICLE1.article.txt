# BASEBALL GAME TO-MORROW.
## Stanford Will Play the Presidio Nine.—To Meet Santa Clara on Thursday. 
### 
Stanford will play the Preeidio
baseball team on the campus dia
mond to-morrow afternoon at 3:30
o'clock. This will be the first of
the last two preliminary games to
be played before the contest with
California on Saturday.
The Varsity has not played the
Presidio this Beason, the two games
that were scheduled to be played
with the nine in San Francisco
having been canceled on account of
the rain. The soldiers last year
had one of the strongest teamß on
the Coast, but were defeated by
Stanford 3to 1. The personnel of
the team has been changed consid
erably since their appearance here
last year. Forsythe, the crack
pitcher, is no longer a member of
the team, his place being taken by
Myers. Conrad, one of their star
players of last year, is still catch
ing for the team. Yesterday the
Presidio team was badly beaten by
Santa Clara, the score being 17 to 5.
From the showing made by the
Varsity in the game with the Pre
sidio team to-morrow, and with
the Santa Clara nine on Thursday,
may be gained some idea of the
team's chance of winning the base
ball series with California. Up to
the last game played the team had
not been hitting very well, and it
seems probable that the nine will
be weak in this branch of the
game.
Stott, who has been doing most
of the work behind the bat this
year, is suffering from an injured
hand which will probably keep
him out of the game to-morrow.
It is possible that blood poisoning
may set in, in which case it is
doubtful whether he will be able to
take part in the intercollegiate con
test. If Stott is prevented from
playing his place will be taken by
Daily. Sales will probably pitch
against the Presidio team, but will
not be in the box when Stanford
plays Santa Clara. The last game
will be too close to the contest with
California to have Salespitch what
will probably be one of the hard
est gajnes of the season.
The probable line-up follows:
STANFORD PRESIDIO
Sales p Myers
Stott c Conrad
Presley lb Myzell
Bell 2b Cameron
Fenton 3b Gannon
Trowbridge ss Stayman
Chalmers If Rice
