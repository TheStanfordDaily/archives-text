It would be unjust to pass over
without a word of praise the ex
cellence of the arrangements made
for the funeral of Mrs. Stanford on
Friday. Representatives of the
city press, accustomed to such cere
monies, have pronounced the ar
rangements the best they had ever
seen. The program was carefully
and considerately planned, and
the two or three breaks in its exe
cution were of small importance.
At the church the problem was es
pecially difficult because of the
limited seating possibilities and
the inability to make use of cards
of admission. Here, as elsewhere,
all the pians worked without a
hitch. Congratulation and thanks
are due to those who planned so
carefully, and especially to Dr.
Duniway, chairman of the commit
tee on arrangements, and to Mr.
McDowell, who handled the crowds
in the church. Thanks, too, must
be given to the many who cooper
ated so faithfully.
