The board of directors of the
Golden Gate Kindergarten Associ
ation has adopted the following
resolutions to the memory of Mrs.
Stanford, who was a charter mem
ber of the association. Mrs. Stan
ford was interested in the work of
the association and since 1884 had
given them $5000 annually for
kindergartens named in memory
of her son. In 1891 she perma
nently provided for these kinder
gartens by a trust fund of $100,000.
The resolutions follow:
"Whereas, It has pleased our
heavenly Father, in his infinite
wisdom and love, to call to a higher
life our well beloved honorary pres
ident, Mrs. Leland Stanford; and
"Whereas. This noble-hearted
woman, in memory of her cherished
son and with tender consideration
for the needs of childhood, and
with strong faith in the kinder
garten as the surest foundation on
which any educational structure
could rest, founded and endowed,
under the auspices of the Golden
Gate Kindergarten Association, in
the city of San Francisco, five
kindergartens, known as the Le
land Stanford Jr. Memorial Free
Kindergartens;
"Resolved, That in the death of
Mrs. Stanford this association has
lost one of its most valued officers
and one of its earliest supporters
and advocates, whose place can
never be filled and whose memory
will be an inspiration to us in all
our future labors for the little chil
dren ;
"Resolved, That we remember
with grateful admiration and re
spect not only her generous con
tribution to kindergarten work,
but also her munificent gift to
higher education, her quick and
ready sympathy with whatever
tended to uplift and strengthen
the foundations of society, her
never-flagging activity in works of
goodness and mercy, and her sin
cere affection for whatsoever things
are pure, true and honest, and of
good report;
"Resolved, That in her death
this community has suffered an ir
reparable loss; the cause of educa
tion, from kindergarten to univer
sity, an untiring benefactress and
friend; the benevolent organizations
of this State a generous supporter;
the world a true and noble example
of devoted wifehood and mother
hood;
"Resolved, That while we mourn
the loss of one so noble and so
true, yet we thank the Giver of all
good for sparing her useful life so
many years and permitting us to
reap such rich harvests from her
beneficent sowing;
"Resolved, That our loss is her
gain, for wc know that she has
heard the blessed, "Inasmuch aB ye
did it to the least of these, my
brethren, ye have done it unto me;
enter ye into the joys of your Lord";
"Resolved, That we tender our
heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved
family in these hours of sorrow;
"Resolved, That a copy of these
resolutions be sent to the family of
the deceased, to the trustees of the
Leland Stanford Jr. Kindergarten
Fund, that they be spread upon
the minutes of the association and
that they be published in the daily
press of this city.
