# GATHERING STANFORD SONGS.
## Some Original Verses Being Contributed by a Number of the Alumni. 
### 
M. H. Thorpe, '05, who is actively
at work collecting the best Stanford
songs,to be publishedin"The Decen
nial of Stanford Song," announces
that many of the alumni are aiding
him materially in his task. He has
received letters from C. K. Field,
'95, A. B. Rice, '95, W. H. Irwin,
'99, and R. E. Warfield, ex-'O2, cor
recting mistakes in the titles or
authors of the old songs, and all of
these letters have expressed much
enthusiasm at the idea of collecting
these songs. A number of the old
song-books have been furnished
Thorpe by H. B. Hawkins, ex-'O5,
now at the University of Wisconsin.
C. K. Field, '95, has sent a song,
with original music and words, en
titled "Three Cheers," which will
be published in this book for the
first time. H. D. Walter, '00, has
written parody verses on "The Son
of a Gambolier," and this will also
be printed for the first time. One
of the features of the book will be
an introduction telling the story of
the development of Stanford song,
written by Archie Rice, '95.
With these numerous additions
the book will be increased in size,
and will probably contain about
two hundred pages. At present
Thorpe is busy gathering the old
farce songs. The appearance of the
book will be delayed until about
May Ist, owing to the fact that
some of the plates for the music are
to be made in Philadelphia. There
are already about two hundred sub
scribers to the song-books, prin
cipally among the alumni, and a
San Francisco music store has
ordered one hundred copies.
The following list of songs is
provisional and unrevised. There
are also quite a number of songs
which have not been included in
this list, although they will appear
in the book. The list is as follows:
