# RABBI VOORSANGER SPEAKS.
## Noted Preacher Pays High Tribute to the Life and Work of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
Rabbi JacobVoorsanger preached
the Bermon in the Memorial Church
yesterday morning. He chose as
his subject, "Can or does science
condition belief in God?" Rabbi
Voorsanger said in part:
"It is easy for scientific men to
impose on us a denial of God based
on intellectual and material truths,
but beyond materialism science
cannot go. It cannot measure the
emotions of the human race, and it
is through these emotions that
man looks up to his God. The
conception of a ruling power is in
nate in men, and they are gradu
ally rising to the highest expression
of this belief in their relations to
the infinite.
"Look back upon the great na
tions of antiquity. Their decay
came from the time when they
turned from the outward worship
of God to the philosophical theory
of religion. But science is itself
the quintessence of reason, and rea
son is an attribute of God, bo that
science and religion may be said
to spring from the same source.
"It seems to me that the greatest
glory of Mrs. Stanford, aside from
her universal motherhood, lies in
her recognition of God as the main
source of human aspirations —a
recognition which found its out
ward expression in this beautiful
edifice. And may this chapel be a
lasting memorial of the good
woman who has now become a part
of that everlasting glory to which
her life was dedicated."
