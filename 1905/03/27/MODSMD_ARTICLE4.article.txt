# Professor Rice Has Resigned.
## 
### 
Assistant Professor C. C. Rice of
the department of Romanic Lan
guages has been compelled by ill
health to give up his position in
the university and return to his
home in Texas. Professor Rice
has not been well for some time
and last week he was attacked by
nervous prostration. His classes
will be divided and joined with the
others in the department which
are doing the same general work;
Professor Rice came to Stanford
in the fall of 1903 from the Uni
versity of Oregon, where he was
assistant professor of Romanic
languages.
