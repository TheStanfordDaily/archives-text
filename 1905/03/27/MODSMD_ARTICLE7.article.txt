# TENNIS MATCH AT BERKELEY.
## California Decides to Hold the Intercollegiate Contests on the Campus. 
### 
It has been finally decided that
the intercollegiate tennis match will
be played on the California cam
pus on the morning of the intercol
legiate field - day. Owing to the
poor condition of the tennis courts
at Berkeley, it was thought that
the match might have to be played
in San Francisco, but California's
decision was received last week by
Manager Barrett. The two singles
matches will be played on the
men's court, which is situated just
back of the new California Hall,
and the doubles will be played on
the girls' court, in front of the
Hearst Gymnasium.
Im order to become accustomed
to the courts, the Stanford team
will spend the greater part of the
Easter vacation at Berkeley. As
the match comes within a week
after the close of the vacation, this
practice will be a great benefit.
The injury to Tennis Captain
George Hodge has healed so rapid
ly under the careful attention that
has been given it that Hodge will
be able to resume practice some
time during the present week.
While apparently recovered from
the effects of the hurt at present,
Hodge will be handicapped by the
loss of a considerable amount of
practice, and by the constant dan
ger of the wound reopening.
