# MAY NOT ROW AT STOCKTON
## California Faculty Said to Oppose Race There.â€”No Three-Cornered Regatta. 
### 
Letters received by President
Butterfield from President S. S.
Hawleyof the California Uoat Club
intimate that the faculty of the
State University will not permit
the intercollegiate regatta to be
held at Stockton or elsewhere at a
distance from the campus. If the
race cannot be held at Stockton it
is probable that no intercollegiate
regatta will be held this year. The
season is so far advanced and the
negotiations have dragged so long
that there is no time to investigate
new courses. The local boating
managers have requested California
to make a definite answer to the
proposal that the contest be held
at Stockton. The California execu
tive committee will meet to-mor
row night.
A week ago California proposed
a three-cornered regatta between
Stanford, Washington and herself.
Stanford has declined to enter such
a contest, as the only available
course for a three-crew race is on
the Oakland estuary.
