# PRESIDENT JORDAN SPEAKS.
## Refers with Feeling to His Recent Sad Mission to the Hawaiian Islands. 
### 
In meeting his class in Organic
Evolution to-day for the first time
since his return, President Jordan
spoke briefly concerning his sad
mission to Honolulu. His words
were full of feeling and pathos.
He said, in substance: 1
"Not long ago I used these words
in writing to an old friend in the
East: 'A great many things hap
pen in fifteen years, especially in
California.' It is IeBS than a
month, as we measure time, since I
last met this class, yet it seems a
time so long that I feel a sort of
surprise to see you still here. You
ought to be graduated and out in
the world long before this.
"I do not like to think of all
which ha> happened in this time.
I like to think of the mother of the
University as she lived the last
day of her life on earth, free from
the burdens of the thought of an
unseen enemy, before the pains of
her last illness came upon her.
"On the mountain behind Hono
lulu is a long slope leading to the
top of the range, ending in a verti
cal cliff of nearly a thousand feet
on the other side. This pass—
called the Pali —is a part bf the
rim of a huge volcanic crater,
which was made when the island
of Oahu arose hot from the sea. It
was once eight or ten miles across,
but the sea broke in and tore away
half the rim. Now from the Pali
one sees one of the noblest views of
the world, a view comparable with
the one from Chapultepec, in Mex
ico, which Humboldt declared to
be the grandest in all the known
world.
"Down from the cliff of the Pali,
one looks over sleek mountain
slopes, covered with dark shrub
bery, and amid this the light green
of the Koa trees. Below red rocks
are forests of guava with golden
fruit ripening in the winter sun
shine of the tropics. On the plain
lies the sugar plantation of Helia,
the canes of the brightest green
known in nature. And beyond all,
behind headlands and islands,
breaks the great blue sea, with its
white rim of surf along the reefs
and splashing higher on the lava
rocks.
"A century or more ago Kame
hameha the First, the King of Ha
waii, came over to Oahu, burning
his ships on the beach, with two
Mexican soldiers and an old-fash
ioned cannon. He drove the peo
ple of Honolulu —the quiet haven
—up the hill behind their town.
Step by step he forced them back
till they came to the Pali. Down
the cliff he thrust them one and
all, till those who were left gave up
the fight and swore allegiance to
Kamehaineha the Great, the first
king of the United Kingdom of
Hawaii.
"Over this Pali, five years ago, a
good road was built, curving up
the mountain slope, running in
sharp zigzags down the cliff. Who
should build it but a Stanford
man —Ilea Edwards Maynard, of
the clasß of '94? Who should help
him but another Stanford man,

Whitehouse of the football team in
the later nineties?
"The glorious climate of Califor
nia stretches like a great mantle
over these Pacific island wards of
hers, and in Hawaii her winter
sunshine reaches its ultimate per
fection.
"It was on the morning of Feb
ruary 28th that Mrs. Stanford with
her maid and secretary set out for
a drive over the Pali. She felt like
a girl that day, and before her on
the Pali lay spread out a new
heaven and a new earth. There
were no cares any more —no more
worry. The cornerstone of Ithe Li
brary was in a few days to be laid
by the students. She had finished
the address to the boys and girls
which Alexander Sherriffs, winner
of the Carnot medal, was to read
for her at the dedication. There
was something else she wished to
say, something which will draw the
student heart nearer to the univer
sity mother when the word is fin
ally said.
"Driving down the Helia road
they stopped before a conical
mountain of shining Hawaiian
green. 'What is the name of this
mountain, Johnson?' she said to
the driver. 'It has no name, Mrs.
Stanford,' Johnson said.
"Then said she, turning to the
mountain with uplifted finger, 'I
baptize thee Sugar Loaf — and
Sugar Loaf shalt thou be hence
forth and forever.' And so on
with the rest of the ceremonial by
which mountains and men receive
their names. I love to think of
this scene, with its sweet enthusi
asm, its love for nature, its enjoy
ment to the full of life, rather than
of the sad confusion of the night
which followed, or of the great loss
which has come to us all. She was
the mother of the university, the
kindest of helpers, the truest of
friends, the wisest, sanest and
most generous of all who have
given their abundance to the cause
of learning. Her life has given the
university a richness of personality,
a wealth of sweet remembrance
that shall not die away in all the
long centuries."

her last illness came upon her.
"On the mountain behind Hono
lulu is a long slope leading to the
top of the range, ending in a verti
cal cliff of nearly a thousand feet
on the other side. This pass—
called the Pali —is a part bf the
rim of a huge volcanic crater,
which was made when the island
of Oahu arose hot from the sea. It
was once eight or ten miles across,
but the sea broke in and tore away
half the rim. Now from the Pali
one sees one of the noblest views of
the world, a view comparable with
the one from Chapultepec, in Mex
ico, which Humboldt declared to
be the grandest in all the known
world.
"Down from the cliff of the Pali,
one looks over sleek mountain
slopes, covered with dark shrub
bery, and amid this the light green
of the Koa trees. Below red rocks
are forests of guava with golden
fruit ripening in the winter sun
shine of the tropics. On the plain
lies the sugar plantation of Helia,
the canes of the brightest green
known in nature. And beyond all,
behind headlands and islands,
breaks the great blue sea, with its
white rim of surf along the reefs
and splashing higher on the lava
rocks.
"A century or more ago Kame
hameha the First, the King of Ha
waii, came over to Oahu, burning
his ships on the beach, with two
Mexican soldiers and an old-fash
ioned cannon. He drove the peo
ple of Honolulu —the quiet haven
—up the hill behind their town.
Step by step he forced them back
till they came to the Pali. Down
the cliff he thrust them one and
all, till those who were left gave up
the fight and swore allegiance to
Kamehaineha the Great, the first
king of the United Kingdom of
Hawaii.
"Over this Pali, five years ago, a
good road was built, curving up
the mountain slope, running in
sharp zigzags down the cliff. Who
should build it but a Stanford
man —Ilea Edwards Maynard, of
the clasß of '94? Who should help
him but another Stanford man,

Whitehouse of the football team in
the later nineties?
"The glorious climate of Califor
nia stretches like a great mantle
over these Pacific island wards of
hers, and in Hawaii her winter
sunshine reaches its ultimate per
fection.
"It was on the morning of Feb
ruary 28th that Mrs. Stanford with
her maid and secretary set out for
a drive over the Pali. She felt like
a girl that day, and before her on
the Pali lay spread out a new
heaven and a new earth. There
were no cares any more —no more
worry. The cornerstone of Ithe Li
brary was in a few days to be laid
by the students. She had finished
the address to the boys and girls
which Alexander Sherriffs, winner
of the Carnot medal, was to read
for her at the dedication. There
was something else she wished to
say, something which will draw the
student heart nearer to the univer
sity mother when the word is fin
ally said.
"Driving down the Helia road
they stopped before a conical
mountain of shining Hawaiian
green. 'What is the name of this
mountain, Johnson?' she said to
the driver. 'It has no name, Mrs.
Stanford,' Johnson said.
"Then said she, turning to the
mountain with uplifted finger, 'I
baptize thee Sugar Loaf — and
Sugar Loaf shalt thou be hence
forth and forever.' And so on
with the rest of the ceremonial by
which mountains and men receive
their names. I love to think of
this scene, with its sweet enthusi
asm, its love for nature, its enjoy
ment to the full of life, rather than
of the sad confusion of the night
which followed, or of the great loss
which has come to us all. She was
the mother of the university, the
kindest of helpers, the truest of
friends, the wisest, sanest and
most generous of all who have
given their abundance to the cause
of learning. Her life has given the
university a richness of personality,
a wealth of sweet remembrance
that shall not die away in all the
long centuries."
In meeting his class in Organic
Evolution to-day for the first time
since his return, President Jordan
spoke briefly concerning his sad
mission to Honolulu. His words
were full of feeling and pathos.
He said, in substance: 1
"Not long ago I used these words
in writing to an old friend in the
East: 'A great many things hap
pen in fifteen years, especially in
California.' It is IeBS than a
month, as we measure time, since I
last met this class, yet it seems a
time so long that I feel a sort of
surprise to see you still here. You
ought to be graduated and out in
the world long before this.
"I do not like to think of all
which ha> happened in this time.
I like to think of the mother of the
University as she lived the last
day of her life on earth, free from
the burdens of the thought of an
unseen enemy, before the pains of
her last illness came upon her.
