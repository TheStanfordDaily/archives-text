The recent theft of the bicycle of
a member of the faculty from his
private office on the most frequent
ed corner of the quadrangle calls
for a few plain words on the numer
ous robberies which are occurring
about this university. It is no use
continuing to say grandly that all
are honeßt hereabout. That is a very
pretty statement to send out to the
world, but there is little comfort in
it for those who find themselves the
victims of the petty thieves. When
bicycles are stolen, lock and all,
from the basements or porches of
their owners, and even from inner
offices on the quadrangle; when
money left unguarded for a few
minutes in dormitory rooms vanish
es as though it never existed; when
one cannot with safety hang one's
hat in the library for a brief time
with any assurance of finding it
there when one seeks it again;—
when such conditions as these ex
ist, it is time that the best profes
sional detective skill be employed
to "catch some of the offenders so
that ithey may receive a suitable
term in the State's prison. Pub
licity will not do the university
any real harm, for it will undoubt
edly be found that most of the
thieves are persons not connected
with the college; but the public ex
posure and severe punishment of a

few of these persons with poor
understanding of the law of mine
and thine would undoubtedly have
a very salutary effect.
