The Hawaiian Star prints the
following appreciative editorial on
the life and work of Mrs. Stanford:
There are few women whose
death could so profoundly affect so
large a part of the American peo
ple, and especially the people of
Western America, as Mrs. Jane L.
Stanford. It is not alone in the
suddenness of it, nor the circum
stances of it, nor even principally
in these, that its effect will be
found. Hut in the woman herself,
in her life, and in relation to the
great university and its influence,
with which her name and labors
are connected.
Mrs. Stanford was one of those
women of whom America has pro
duced so many examples, who are
endowed with those qualities and
traits of character which tit them
for any station in life, and for any
conditions, no matter what high
qualities those conditions may call
for. When she married her hus
band he was what we understand
by the term a country merchant.
She came with him to California
at an early day, at a time when
the wonderful resources of that
magnificent State were little devel
oped, and in large part undreamed
of. It took something of the poetic
temperament to see in visions in
those early days what California
was to become and is, even the
imperfect vision of the prophet.
But Leland Stanford had that
temperament. Establishing him
self in business in Sacramento, he
at the same time recognized the
possibilities of the fertile soil of
California, and even in those early
days, before he had become the
wealthy man of the later era, he
had become a large land-holder.
He was one of those four men in
Sacramento, then a small place,
though relatively more important
then than now, who staggered cre
dulity almost, and certainly stag
gered commonplace appreciation of
possibilities, by undertaking to
build a transcontinental railroad
over a thousand miles of mountain
and desert. They did it, too. They
made themselves rich almost be
yond the dreams of avarice, but at
the same time they created untold
wealth for the people of a whole
State.
Leland Stanford's services to the
people of California and the Pacific
coast were recognized by the people,
too, and he was elected Governor
and afterwards United States Sen
ator. But the crowning work of
his life, and the work in which Mrs.
Stanford shared gloriously with her
husband, was in the establishment,
care, and endowment of the Leland
Stanford Junior University. This
is a memorial and a monument to
their son, and no nobler monument
could be conceived. To its founda
tion Senator Stanford devoted a
large share of his estate. To its
endowment, Mrs. Stanford dedicated
her all. To it she gave her widow
hood.
Not alone is the result Stanford
University, with its hundreds of
students, and the life that that im
plies, but Stanford University so
stimulated the better thought of
California, so wrought on the
higher impulses of a generous peo
ple, that the University of Califor
nia, which had languished neglect
ed, became the recipient of the sup
port which the pride of the State
liberally poured forth, and it has
become an institution of which any
commonwealth might be proud, an

nstitution which bids fair to be
come one of the greatest in the
world. The impetus to build up
the University of California might
have come later from some other
source. But it did come from the
influence of Stanford University.
It is therefore a part of the herit
age left to the ambitious youth of
America by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford that they not only gave
Stanford University to the world,
but in large measure, also the Uni
versity of California.
Mrs. Stanford did not merely
give her money to the institution,
—she gave her thought, her time,
her life. In the buildings and
grounds of the university, in the
mural and statuary decorations
and embellishments of the institu
tion, there is constant evidence of
the thought, the pride, the ma
ternal affection which has been so
thoroughly inwrought in this me
morial to an only eon.
Mrs. Stanford has passed away.
But her work was finished, at least
in as large a measure, and in as
complete a way, as the work of
any useful life can be completed.
She died full of years and honors.
As a sheaf, full and ripe, she was
garnered. The only real sadness
is in the manner of the end.

band he was what we understand
by the term a country merchant.
She came with him to California
at an early day, at a time when
the wonderful resources of that
magnificent State were little devel
oped, and in large part undreamed
of. It took something of the poetic
temperament to see in visions in
those early days what California
was to become and is, even the
imperfect vision of the prophet.
But Leland Stanford had that
temperament. Establishing him
self in business in Sacramento, he
at the same time recognized the
possibilities of the fertile soil of
California, and even in those early
days, before he had become the
wealthy man of the later era, he
had become a large land-holder.
He was one of those four men in
Sacramento, then a small place,
though relatively more important
then than now, who staggered cre
dulity almost, and certainly stag
gered commonplace appreciation of
possibilities, by undertaking to
build a transcontinental railroad
over a thousand miles of mountain
and desert. They did it, too. They
made themselves rich almost be
yond the dreams of avarice, but at
the same time they created untold
wealth for the people of a whole
State.
Leland Stanford's services to the
people of California and the Pacific
coast were recognized by the people,
too, and he was elected Governor
and afterwards United States Sen
ator. But the crowning work of
his life, and the work in which Mrs.
Stanford shared gloriously with her
husband, was in the establishment,
care, and endowment of the Leland
Stanford Junior University. This
is a memorial and a monument to
their son, and no nobler monument
could be conceived. To its founda
tion Senator Stanford devoted a
large share of his estate. To its
endowment, Mrs. Stanford dedicated
her all. To it she gave her widow
hood.
Not alone is the result Stanford
University, with its hundreds of
students, and the life that that im
plies, but Stanford University so
stimulated the better thought of
California, so wrought on the
higher impulses of a generous peo
ple, that the University of Califor
nia, which had languished neglect
ed, became the recipient of the sup
port which the pride of the State
liberally poured forth, and it has
become an institution of which any
commonwealth might be proud, an

nstitution which bids fair to be
come one of the greatest in the
world. The impetus to build up
the University of California might
have come later from some other
source. But it did come from the
influence of Stanford University.
It is therefore a part of the herit
age left to the ambitious youth of
America by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford that they not only gave
Stanford University to the world,
but in large measure, also the Uni
versity of California.
Mrs. Stanford did not merely
give her money to the institution,
—she gave her thought, her time,
her life. In the buildings and
grounds of the university, in the
mural and statuary decorations
and embellishments of the institu
tion, there is constant evidence of
the thought, the pride, the ma
ternal affection which has been so
thoroughly inwrought in this me
morial to an only eon.
Mrs. Stanford has passed away.
But her work was finished, at least
in as large a measure, and in as
complete a way, as the work of
any useful life can be completed.
She died full of years and honors.
As a sheaf, full and ripe, she was
garnered. The only real sadness
is in the manner of the end.
