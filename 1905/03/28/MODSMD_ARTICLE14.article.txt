# STANFORD DEFEATS PRESIDIO.
## Nine to Two the Score Against the Visitors, Who Secured Only Two Hits. 
### 
In a slow and uninteresting
game the Varsity defeated the Pre
sidio team this afternoon by the
score of 9 to 2. Theile pitched for
Stanford, and with the exception
of the fifth inning, he was unsolv
able to the visitors. In that inning
two hits and a couple of bad errors
let in two runs. Stanford batted
Myers at will, making a total of
ten hits. The fielding of the whole
Presidio team was slow and ragged.
In the eighth inning Daily went
in behind the bat, Cadwalader suc
ceeded Chalmers in left field, and
Lewis went into right. The feat
ures of the game were the batting
of Dudley, Fenton, and Presley,
who made between them six of
Stanford's ten hits. Fenton's field
ing was also very good.
