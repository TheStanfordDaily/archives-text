# THE 						CAPITOLA CONFERENCE.
## Arrangements Completed for Annual Meeting of the Young Women's Christian Association. 
### 
The final arrangements for the
seventh annual coast conference of
the Young Women's Christian As
sociation have been completed and
everything is now in readiness for
the opening session, which will be
held Friday evening, March olst,
at Capitola. The women who are
to attend the opening are to leave
here on the 3:29 train Friday af
ternoon, and those in charge are
counting on a large representation
from Stanford. Those who are un
able to get away on Friday are to
be carefully looked out for on their
arrival at the conference, and in
order that suitable and satisfac
tory arrangements in regard to
lodging and reception may be
made, all who will go later are
urged to hand their names, and
the probable hour of arrival at
Capitola, to Miss E. Hayvvard or
any other member of the confer
ence committee at once.
In pursuance of the plan which
has been highly successful at past
conferences, the usual "college
day" will be observed. The date
as it now stands is April Bth, and
the management of that day's pro
gram is in the hands of a commit
tee of which Miss Pauline Gartz
mann, '07, is the head. This day
is always of especial interest, since
on that date the entire time is
given over to the various branches
of athletic contests between the
representatives of the Coast col
leges. There will be a track meet,
basket-ball and tennis games in
which any of the women in atten
dance are eligible to enter.
The committee in charge urges
that the Stanford women take their
Stanford pennants or other distinc
tive college emblems both for this
and other occasions of intercollegi
ate contests. The women are re
quested to take the gymnasium
suits for the athletic contest of
"college day."
A delegation of sixty or more
from Stanford will insure a half
rate, $2.05 round trip, but in every
case the return certificate must be
asked for when the ticket is pur
chased at the depot.
