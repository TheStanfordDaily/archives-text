The annual interclass field-day
will be held on the oval at 2:45 to
morrow afternoon. Besides an op
portunity to gain a class sweater,
to-morrow's meet will give the
track candidates a chance to make
the team which will contest with
Pomona College Saturday. Man
ager Barrett's determination not to
make the southern trip will enable
fourteen instead of thirteen ath
letes to go to Pomona. As soon as
the interclass field-day is over the
men who are to comprise the south
ern team will be chosen by Cap
tain Bell and Trainer Moulton.
