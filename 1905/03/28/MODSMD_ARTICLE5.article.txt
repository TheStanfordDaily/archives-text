# WILL MEET CALIFORNIA.
## Miss Ray and Miss Owen to Represent Stanford in the Singles in Tennis. 
### 
With the final match of yester
day, tlie women's singles tennis
tournament, which had been post
poned twice, was completed, and
the women players who will meet
those from California in the singles
have finally been chosen. In the
preliminary matches, played two
weeks ago, Miss May Dunn, '08,
proved her right to enter the finals.
In her match with Mies Pitman,
'05, she was defeated by the score
6-3, 6-2.
This match left the question of
the championship and the places
in the singles to be decided between
Miss E. Owen, '07, Miss Pitman,
and Miss Ray, '05, the present
champion and captain of the squad.
Miss Owen defeated Miss Pitman
by the score 6-2, 6-2, and was in
turn defeated by Miss Ray 7-5,
6-1. This gives the places in the
singles to Miss Owen and Miss
Ray, who will meet the California
team later.
Miss Owen played on a Stanford
team for the first time last year,
and her clear, cool style of play
gave hopes for this year.
Miss Ray,who won the silver cup
given by the Women's Athletic
Association to the winner of the
championship, has played during
her three years in college. She
can always be relied on at the crit
ical time, and her presence on the
team enables the Stanford enthusi
asts to be more hopeful of the re
sult. This is the second year that
Miss Ray has held the champion
ship.
The tournament for the selection
of the doubles team will beheld on
the Roble courts at 2 o'clock to
morrow. All those wishing to en
ter this tournament are urged to be
at the courts at that hour.
There is a possibility that the
date and place of the tennis match
may be changed to suit the play
ers. As originally planned, the
matches were to be played at Stan
ford on the morning of April Bth,
but owing to the vacation which
will be incomplete at that date the
tournament may be held in Berke
ley on the morning of the field
day.
