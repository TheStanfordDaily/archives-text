In another column the names are
printed of those who have been
selected to officiate at the inter
class field-day to-morrow after
noon. Preliminary warning has not
been given to many of these men
because of the great amount of time
that would be required to give in
dividual notice to each person con
cerned. The captain has merely
chosen the best men for the posi
tions, in the hope that they will be
willing to serve. Every one who
is able to do so ought to be on hand
promptly at the hour named and
report his arrival to the captain at
the training house, in order that
the meet may be run off with as
little delay as possible.
