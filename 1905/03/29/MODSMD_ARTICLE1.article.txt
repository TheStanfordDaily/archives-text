# SENIORS WIN FIELD-DAY.
## Burr Makes New Stanford Record in the Two Miles, and Miller Runs Fast Querter. 
### 
The interclass field-day held on
the oval this afternoon was won by
the Seniors with a total of 50
points. The Freshmen followed
with 38, the Sophomores third with
32, and the Juniors at the end with
2 points.
In spite of a wet track and a
fierce wind which blew directly
down the back stretch, good time
was made in several of the races.
By running the two miles in
10:37.2, Burr broke the Stanford
record of 10:42, held by H. A.
Sprague, ex-'O4.
The most remarkable race of the
day was the 440 yards, won by
Miller, '08, who finished with a
fine burst of speed in the good
time of 52:2.
The records made in the field
events were only fair, with the ex
ception of the hammer-throw,
which was won by Crawford with a
throw of 146 feet inches. This
was one of the best performances of
the meet. The poie-vault had to
he given up at 10 feet 2 inches, as
the strong wind prevented the
vaulters from going any higher.
