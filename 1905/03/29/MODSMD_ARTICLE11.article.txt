# Freshman Class Meets.
## 
### 
The Freshman class met to-day
to discuss the question of a class
emblem. Several suggestions were
made in favor of a cap, hat-band,
or the like. After a short discus
sion it was decided to leave the
matter in the hands of a commit
tee, which is to select a suitable
emblem and report to the class at
the next meeting.
President Mac Swain urged that
all outstanding dues be paid imme
diately, as there were numerous
bi 11Â« against the class still un
paid.
The committee, C. Perkins, F. R.
Mugler, and R. A. Kocher, which
had charge of purchasing the base
ball sweaters and debating pins,
was instructed to arrange for the
purchase of track and boating
sweaters.
The report of the treasurer
showed that only about $60 in
dues had been collected, $12 of
which he had expended for debat
ing pins.
