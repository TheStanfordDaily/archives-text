The collections for the athletic
field fund thus far reported by the
student body treasurer do not ag
gregate much more than four hun
dred dollars. This is not a credit
able record for a student body of
our size. It means that but one
student in three has met the call;
that about two-thirds of the
men and women of the university
have contributed nothing. There
is not a great deal that can be said
about the matter. The whole situ
ation was thoroughly discussed at
a university assembly, and if the
enthusiasm then displayed had
any significance, the suggestions
made had the fullest support of
the students. The contribution of
one dollar by each student was
proposed as a means of raising a
portion of the funds needed for the
building of the new grounds. The
contribution was to have been
purely voluntary, and unless many
delayed subscriptions come in, it
has failed. It is a sad commen
tary on the depth of general stu
dent body interest in the welfare
of the university's athletics.
