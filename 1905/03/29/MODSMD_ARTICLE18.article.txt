# Varsity Men Bat Well.
## 
### 
Stanford's game with the Presidio
yesterday afternoon was a very one
sided contest. The ball played by
the visitors was of a poor quality,
and the Varsity scored almost at
will. In the first inning the Var
sity succeeded in getting a run, and
in only two innings after that, the
fifth and ninth, did they fail to
score. The Varsity hit safely a
number of times, but these hits
were kept fairly well scattered, and
the ten errors made by the visitors
were largely responsible for the
large number of runs scored.
The Varsity played a strong game
in the field, but weakened in one
inning, the fifth, when the Presidio
nine scored twice. After the bases
had been filled by a base on balls
and two errors, Mathews hit safely
and scored two of his team. The
Presidio players seemed unable to
hit Theile's delivery,obtaining only
two safe hits during the game.
After the fifth inning the visitors
did not again come near scoring.
Several men on the Varsity
batted well yesterday, Presley and
Dudley hitting safely three out of
four times at bat, and Fenton
knocking out a single and a three
base hit.
