# The
						Handball Tournament.
## 
### 
On account of the fact that the
handball tournaments planned to
take place during the early part of
March were postponed, the com
mittee in charge desires that some
of the tournaments occur during
the Easter vacation. All men who
have entered their names for the
tournaments are requested to in
form the director of the Encina
gymnasium before the end of this
week whether or not they will be
at the university during the vaca
tion. If a sufficient number of men
will be present next week the first
games of the tournament will be
played.
