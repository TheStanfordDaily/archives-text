# LAST PRELIMINARY GAME.
## Stanford Will Meet Santa Clara College on the Diamond To-morrow. 
### 
Santa Clara will play the Var
sity on the campus to-morrow
afternoon at 3:30. This will be
the final preliminary game played
by Stanford before the contest with
California next Saturday. Stan
ford has defeated Santa Clara but
once this season, and the game to
morrow will be close. Sales will
probably pitch for the Varsity, but
Coach Cowden may substitute an
other man in his place, as a hard
contest now might lessen his effi
ciency in the game against Califor
nia.
With the exception of Sales tak
ing the place of Theile, the same
men will play that took part in
yesterday's game. Cowden will
probably play Chalmers, Dudley,
Colbert, Cadwalader, and Lewis in
the outfield. There is a spirited
contest in progress among these
four men for places on the inter
collegiate team. It is probable
that all four will be used during
the series. The reßt of the places
on the nine seem to be definitely
settled, and unless something un
expected happens in to-morrow's
game, the infield that plays against
California will be the same that
was seen in yesterday's game.
The probable line-up of the
teams follows:
STANFORD. SANTA CLARA.
Sales p Boyle
Stott c Collins
Presley lb Sigwart
Bell 2b Feeney
Fenton 3b Byrnes
