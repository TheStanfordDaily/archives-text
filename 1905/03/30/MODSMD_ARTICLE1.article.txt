# CHANGES IN CONSTITUTION?
## Evecutive Committee Names Sub-Committee to Consider Important Alterations. 
### 
At a meeting of the Executive
Commitee held last night Student
Body President Dibble appointed a
committee on revision of the consti
tution. This committee is com
posed of A. L. Trowbridge, '05,
W. E. Crawford, '05, and E. Y.
Pomeroy,'os, chairman. The com
mittee will carefully consider the
entire constitution as it now stands
and decide if any amendments
need be to made. It will make its
report as to any proposed changes
immediately after Easter vacation.
Several important questions will
be considered by this committee.
One proposed amendment is to in
crease the student body dues from
one dollar a year to one dollar a
semester. This change seems nec
essary in view of the increased ex
penses to be incurred next year in
athletics.
Another very important change
which may be recommended is to
do away with the Athletic Commit
tee as it now exists. The present
Athletic Committee consists of eight
men,and the duties of this commit
tee now are to award sweaters, to
appoint an intercollegiate athletic
committee, and to keep athletic
records. These functions, it is
believed, can be turned over to
another committee. A plan that
has been suggested is to have an
executive committee of fifteen rep
resentative men which would have
the same power that is now divided
between the Executive Committee
and the Athletic Committee. This
committee would be composed
of one representative from each of
the three upper classes and one
representative from each branch of
college activities —football, base
ball, track, tennis, boating, publi
cations, debating, guild, and musi
cal clubß. The president, vice
president, and secretary of the
Associated Students would be ex
officio members of this proposed
committee.
The matter of a permanent
board of control to have supervision
of the new athletic grounds will
also probably be considered by the
committee on revision of the con
stitution. Nothing definite has
been done in regard to the person
nel of this committee, its number,
time of service, and method of
selection. Thesub-committeenamed
last night will consider this also
during the coming week.
The proposed amendments, as
finally drawn up, will be published
in the Daily Palo Alto of April
10th, and on April 19th a general
meeting of the student body will
be held to vote on the amendments.
At this same meeting the annual
nominations for student officers
will be made. The regular student
body election will be held on April
26th.
