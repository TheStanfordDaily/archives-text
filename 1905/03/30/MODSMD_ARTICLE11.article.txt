# LAW REUNION IN NOVEMBER.
## Association Will Hold Its Annual Meeting at Time of the Football Game. 
### 
The Law Association met yes
terday afternoon to decide upon the
time for holding the annual ban
quet and reunion. The association
has delayed fixing a date, waiting
for a settlement of the question of
the time the alumni reunion will
be held. Although they have no
definite assurance that this event
will occur next fall, the law men
last night decided to hold their
celebration at the time of the inter
collegiate football game, which will
be played on the Stanford campus
in November. Negotiations are al
ready under way to secure several
prominent men for this occasion.
An informal supper will be given
at the close of the semester under
the auspices of the association.
This will be a social function and
will have nothing in the nature of
a reunion.
