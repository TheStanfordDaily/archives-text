# POMONA HAS HIGH HOPES.
## Southern College Has Good Athletes and Expects to Press Stanford Hard. 
### 
The track team of Pomona Col
lege, which the Varsity will meet
next Saturday at Claremont, is
one of the strongest teams ever de
veloped at that institution. In a
recent field-day with Occidental
College, the Claremont college won
by the score of 72 to 50.
In the 100 yards Spurgeon of
Pomona is credited with a record
of 10.1 in practice. Two other
sprinters are running the short
dash in 10.3. Spurgeon has run
the 220 in 22.4, and Johnson has a
record of 23.1 in that event. Brown
has run the quarter in 52.3 and
the half in 2:02. The same athlete
has covered the mile in 4:40 2-5,
while his teammate, Hutchinson,
has made the distance in 4:49 1-5.
In the two-mile run Voorhees has
a record of 10:46.
The high hurdles have been
made in 16.3 by McCormick. Mc-
Cormick and Daniels have run the
high hurdles in 28 flat. Munger
is clearing the bar in the high
jump at 5 feet 9 inches, and Davis
is vaulting 10 ieet 1 inch. Moor
man is putting the shot 39 feet 8
inches, and Metcalfe is throwing
the hammer 133 feet 10 inches.
Coach Walter Hempel expects
his men to press the Stanford ath
letes in the low hurdles, the short
dashes, the 440 and 880 yards, the
distance runs and the weights.
Hempel does not expect his team
to take many firsts, but he relies
on them to make the score close by
taking a large number of second
and third places. Stanford alumni
and former students of the univer
sity now residing in Southern Cali
fornia are taking great interest in
the coming meet between Stanford
and Pomona. A special train will
carry the Stanford Club of Los
Angeles to Claremont, where the
field-day will be held. This dele
gation has chosen W. I. Traeger,
ex-'O3, as yell leader, and with the
Stanford people who will be pres
ent from other parts of the south, a
large rooting section will be formed
to cheer the efforts of the Cardinal
athletes. W. F. Dunn, '04, who is
coaching the track team of the Los
Angeles High School, will be pres
ent with a number of his charges.
The Stanford team left the cam
pus this evening and will arrive at
Claremont to-morrow afternoon.
