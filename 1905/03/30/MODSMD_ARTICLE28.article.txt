# MAY HAVE NAMES ON COVER.
## Advance Payment for the "Quad" Secures This Privilege. â€” Prospectus to Be Issued. 
### 
The management, of the Quad
announces an innovation this year
in the form of having the purchas
er's name printed on the book
cover. Persons desiring to have
this done will be required to pay
for the book in advance. Manager
Maloy of the Quad will keep daily
office hours in the week following
the Easter vacation to receive ad
vance payments. The names are
to be imprinted in small neat let
ters of gold insert on the cover, and
will present a very neat appear
ance. It is expected that a large
number will take advantage of this
opportunity. This has never been
done with any previous Quad, and
it will probably become a perma
nent feature of the Junior annual.
Practically all the material for
the Quad has been handed to the
the editors. Several changes have
been made in the form of the book,
principally in the manner of run
ning the various departments. The
athletic department of this year's
annual has been enlarged sixteen
pages over the usual size, and more
carefully and systematically ar
ranged by departments than in
former books. It will be profusely
illustrated with photographs and
snap-shots. There are more track
pictures than ever before, and
many pictures in the various other
branches of athletics. Special at
tention is given to boating because
of the growing interest in that
6port. Stanford's banner year in
athletics is amply treated.
The dramatic department has
also been changed in form. In
stead of the regular lists of casts of
characters and pages of illustra
tions, a story of dramatics will be
given, illustrated by cuts inserted
in the text.
A prospectus of the Quad is to
be issued soon after the vacation.
Copies will be distributed about
the campus and mailed to the
alumni. It is thought that the
Quad this year will be of special
interest to the alumni because of
the memorial it contains of Mrs.
Stanford. The prospectus will
discuss the various departments of
the Quad in some detail, giving a
general idea of what the book con
tains.
