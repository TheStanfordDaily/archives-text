# DARK OUTLOOK FOR REGATTA.
## Stanford Declines to Bind Itself to Row on the Oakland Estuary Next Year. 
### 
From present appearances, it
looks as though there would be no
regatta with the University of
California. While in the city yes
terday Treasurer Barrett met Man
ager Decoto of California in an ef
fort to make final arrangements for
the regatta, but no definite plans
were completed. Decoto said that
California was willing to race at
Stockton this year, on condition
that Stanford would sign a con
tract to row on the Oakland estu
ary each alternate year for four
years. Decoto said that the Cali
fornia faculty would not permit
the Boat Club to race at Stockton
this year unless they came to the
agreement as above indicated.
This question was brought up
last night at a meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Stanford
Associated Students, which rejected
California's proposal, leaving the
matter in the hands of Treasurer
Barrett for further negotiation.
The result of the meeting is em
bodied in a letter sent to Manager
Decoto to-day by Treasurer Barrett.
The letter follows:
"We brought the matter of boat
ing up last night before the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students, also before a combined
meeting of the Boating Club and
the Faculty Athletic Committee.
It was the unanimous opinion of
both bodies that it would not be
right to agree upon a place for the
regatta for future years.
"The members of the Faculty
Athletic Committee expressed
themselves freely. They think that
since we tried Oakland last year,
a place proposed by California, it
would not be unfair for you to try
a place proposed by us without
having us agree to row at Oakland
again next year. They also agree
with us that the Oakland course is
not a proper place. It is their de
sire that we give Stockton a trial
before making definite arrange
ment for future years.
"Your proposition of alternating
between Redwood City and Oak
land has too many objections to be
considered. The most serious is
that neither course is good enough
for a regatta.
"It is getting too late to discuss
this matter further. At any time
in the past we would have been
glad to investigate any place in the
State. At present, however, we
feel that it is too late. Our de
cision is that it must be Stockton
this year, with the matter left open
for future years. We say Stock
ton, as I have said in previous let
ters, simply because it would take
too much time at this late hour to
make further investigations.
"In taking this step we voice the
sentiment of the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students,
the Boating Club, the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, and, as far as I
can see, the whole student body.
"Let me have your answer as
soon as possible.
"Yours truly,
"R. W. Barrett."
