# TO PLACE FLOWERS AT TOMB.
## Senior Class Inaugurates a New Tradition to Be Passed on to Succeeding Classes. 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior class
to-day the members unanimously
adopted a resolution made by A.
M. Dibble that the class place
flowers daily at the tomb of Mrs.
Stanford. President Trowbridge
will appoint two members of the
Senior class to perform the daily
task. This committee will place
flowers at the tomb daily until col
lege closes. The class contemplates
placing a bronze vase in front of
the mausoleum in which to place
the flowers. The class numerals
will be engraved on the vaee.
A committee will be appointed
by the class president to draw up
a few rules in connection with the
new tradition. It is the plan to
make the transference to the Junior
class of the privilege of placing
flowers in the vase a part of the
commencement exercises. The
class of 1806 will in turn, at the
end of its senior year, pass the
trust on to the following senior
class.
Class pins like those of the pre
ceding classes were adopted to-day.
The pin consists of the Stanford
seal.
The class also voted sweaters to
those representatives in the field
meet yesterday who had not pre
viously been awarded them.
