TO THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED
IT Our stock of Spring Clothes is com
plete, and is now at its very best.
IT In many ways it is the most re
markable collection of Men's Apparel
ever shown in the city.
IT The great variety of the fabric pat
terns, styles of garments, sizes and
shapes in each style, commands at once
the admiration and interest of all who
examine it.
"IT This is because we are showing the
choicest selections from the best mar
kets in the country. No efforts have
been spared in securing style and qual
ity.
