# Will Practice on Berkeley Courts.
## 
### 
In view of the fact that the inter
collegiate tennis will be played this
year on the courts of the campus at
the University of California, the
members of the tennis team will
spend the Easter vacation at Berke
ley. As California has no Easter
vacation, the team will be able to
use the courts quite freely for
practice, and should be greatly
benefited by it. Tennis Captain
Hodge will resume practice early
next week, and unless his injury
receives another setback, he should
be able to get into fairly good shape
by April 15th.
