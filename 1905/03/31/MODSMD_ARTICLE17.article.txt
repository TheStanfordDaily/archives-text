# LAST PRELIMINARY GAMES.
## Santa Clara Wins from the Varsity in a Well-Contested Match. 
### 
In a close, exciting contest Santa
Clara defeated the Varsity nine
again yesterday afternoon after it
looked as though Stanford had the
game won. The Varsity started out
in the first inning with a rush. Bell
singled, Presley sacrificed him to
second, and Kenton brought him
home with the necessary hit. Noth
ing further occurred until the fourth
inning, when Santa Clara also
scored. Russell was hit by the
pitcher and took first. He stole
second and came home on Byrnes'
hit. A combination of errors en
abled the Cardinal to take the lead
again in the seventh, Lewis tallying
this time. Santa Clara tied the
score again in her half of this in
ning, a base on balls and two hits
being the means. The undoing of
the Varsity came in the ninth,
when Boyle signalized his entrance
into the game by a hit to right
field, and was immediately driven
home on another single by Walters.
The game was close throughout,
the noticeable features being the
tendency of the Varsity to allow
their opponents to fill the bases be
fore they really got into the game,
and the apparent ease with which
the Santa Clarans stole bases.
