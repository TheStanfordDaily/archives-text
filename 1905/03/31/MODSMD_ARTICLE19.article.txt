# PAINTINGS FOR UNIVERSITY.
## Two Consignments of Sixty Cases Received from Thomas Welton Stanford. 
### 
Oil the steamship Sonora, which
arrived in San Francisco a few
days ago, were a number of oil
paintings valued at $30,000, sent
from Australia by Thomas Welton
Stanford, brother of the late Sena
tor Stanford, of whose private col
lection they are a part. The consign
ment included thirty-nine paint
ings. A second consignment of
twenty-one cases will arrive on the
next steamer from Australia.
Thomas Welton Stanford intends
to give his entire collection to the
university, and to purchase the
best that can be procured in Aus
tralia. The paintings are from
the brushes of the most famous
Australian artists. The subjects
are confined almost exclusively to
Australian scenery.
About ten years ago Mr. Stan
ford presented the university with
sixty-one paintings, all by J. W.
Curtis,a famous Australian painter.
The lot gives a good conception of
the beauty of the gum-tree forests
of Australia.
The present consignment of
sixty cases will be placed in the
Museum as soon as they are
brought from San Francisco.
