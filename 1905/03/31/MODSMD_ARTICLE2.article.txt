### 
Final arrangements for the first
intercollegiate baseball game were
completed this morning. The Var
sity team will take the 7:27 train
to-morrow morning for San Fran
cisco. The game will be played on
the California diamond, and will
be called at 2:30. The round-trip
fare from Palo Alto to Berkeley
from Friday to Monday is $1.10.
This rate includes the trip across
the bay, and is good on any of the
regular Southern Pacific trains or
boats.
