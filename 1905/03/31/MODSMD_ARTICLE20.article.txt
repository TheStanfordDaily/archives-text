# NOYES EXHIBITS PAINTINGS.
## Display of Eastern and Foreign Landscape Views in San Francisco. 
### 
An exhibition of landscape paint
ings by Professor G. L. Noyes of
the Stanford Drawing department
will be held for two weeks in the
art rooms of Paul Elder and Com
pany, 288 Post street, San Fran
cisco. Professor Noyes has ex
hibited in Boston, New York and
other eastern cities several times
during the last ten years, but this
is his first exhibition in California.
He has painted principally in
Venice. Algeria, Mexico, and New
England, and many of his paint
ings depict scenes from these places.
W. H. Downs, an art critic, has
said of Professor Noyes: "His New
England landscapes, particularly
those made in the wonderfully
paintable region about Squam,
Annisquam and Essex, are quite
on a par with the best things of
their kind by contemporary Ameri
can landscape painters. The spring
landscapes with a sunny meadow
in the foreground, an orchard on a
slope in the middle distance, and a
group of farm buildings on the
little eminence which forms the
horizon, has the atmosphere, the
light, and almost the fragrance of
a perfect May corning. There
are also some strong paintings of
the White Mountains country, in
which, bv the ingenious arrange
ment of lines, and the introduction
of cloudß hanging low over the
flanks of the mountains, one gets
an impression of Alpine grandeur
which is not always to be had in
the ordinary conditions of weather
and light."
