STANFORD will meet the Uni
versity of California to-mor
row in the first baseball game of the
intercollegiate series of the season of
1905. The contest will take place
on the California diamond in the
afternoon at 2:30. Not since
the season of 1898 has the Cardinal
been victorious in a series with the
nine from the State institution, but
the chances of winning to-morrow's
game are good. The game will be
played on California's own dia
mond, as was the first contest last
year, and this is a decided advan
tage to the home team. This
handicap will be the greater this
year, as Stanford will put prac
tically a team of new men in the
field. California, on the other
hand, has a nine composed almost
entirely of veterans.
A comparison of the strength of
the two nines from their playing
this year shows Stanford a stronger
defensive team than the Blue and
Gold. This was true of the team
that played California last season.

The Cardinal is probably a better
fielding team at present, and with
Sales in the pitcher's position,
should prove very difficult to score
on, provided the unseasoned men
play up to the form that they have
been showing in practice.
Much Depends on the Batting'.
The result of the contest will de
pend largely on the batting of the
two teams, and it is here that Cali
fornia is credited with being su
perior to Stanford. This proved
true last year and was responsible
for California's victory in two
games out of three. The Stanford
Varsity, from the showing
made in the last few games, cannot
be considered as weak in this de
partment of the game. While
not what would be styled a nine of
heavy hitters, the work of the men
has been such as to expect them
not to prove weak in this depart
ment of the game to-morrow.
Comparing the opposing bat
teries, Sales should prove the su
perior of Heitmuller, and Stott
should hold his own with Bliss.
Both pitchers have had experience
in intercollegiate contests, and
Heitmuller more than Sales; but
the Stnnford twirler possesses a
greater variety of curves than his
opponent. Behind the bat Bliss is
a veteran of two seasons, but Stott
is not h novice at the game and
has played first-class ball lately.
