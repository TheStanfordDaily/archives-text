STANFORD will meet the Uni
versity of California to-mor
row in the first baseball game of the
intercollegiate series of the season of
1905. The contest will take place
on the California diamond in the
afternoon at 2:30. Not since
the season of 1898 has the Cardinal
been victorious in a series with the
nine from the State institution, but
the chances of winning to-morrow's
game are good. The game will be
played on California's own dia
mond, as was the first contest last
year, and this is a decided advan
tage to the home team. This
handicap will be the greater this
year, as Stanford will put prac
tically a team of new men in the
field. California, on the other
hand, has a nine composed almost
entirely of veterans.
A comparison of the strength of
the two nines from their playing
this year shows Stanford a stronger
defensive team than the Blue and
Gold. This was true of the team
that played California last season.

The Cardinal is probably a better
fielding team at present, and with
Sales in the pitcher's position,
should prove very difficult to score
on, provided the unseasoned men
play up to the form that they have
been showing in practice.
Much Depends on the Batting'.
The result of the contest will de
pend largely on the batting of the
two teams, and it is here that Cali
fornia is credited with being su
perior to Stanford. This proved
true last year and was responsible
for California's victory in two
games out of three. The Stanford
Varsity, from the showing
made in the last few games, cannot
be considered as weak in this de
partment of the game. While
not what would be styled a nine of
heavy hitters, the work of the men
has been such as to expect them
not to prove weak in this depart
ment of the game to-morrow.
Comparing the opposing bat
teries, Sales should prove the su
perior of Heitmuller, and Stott
should hold his own with Bliss.
Both pitchers have had experience
in intercollegiate contests, and
Heitmuller more than Sales; but
the Stnnford twirler possesses a
greater variety of curves than his
opponent. Behind the bat Bliss is
a veteran of two seasons, but Stott
is not h novice at the game and
has played first-class ball lately.

One manner of comparing the
two nines is by the opinion of their
two principal opponents in the
preliminary games. Santa Clara
is of the opinion that Stanford has
better chances of winning to-mor
row, while St. Mary's College of
Oakland is inclined to think that
California will prove the winner.
Team Will Be Well Rounded.
Reviewing the present season
shows that a well-rounded, strong
nine has been developed from a
large squad of what was relatively
poor material. Stanford started
the season with four veterans of
last year —Trowbridge, Sales, Col
bert, and Chalmers. From a squad
of nearly sixty men Coach Cowden
early sifted the candidates down to
a small number and started in the
task of developing Varsity men.
His work was only well started
when the schedule of practice
games was upset by the death of
Mrs. Stanford. Practice games are
essential to make a seasoned team
out of new material, and under the
handicap in the middle of the sea
son the good showing made in yes
terday's game was remarkable.
From the scores of the prelimi
nary games nothing can be gained
to show the relative merits of Cali
fornia and Stanford, but the im
provement of the Cardinal can be
seen by comparing the first and last
preliminary games. In the first
contest Stanford was shut out by
Santa Clara, the score being 7 to 0,
and the Varsity was credited with
only one hit; while yesterday,
against the same nine, they made
seven hits, and were defeated in a
hard-fought contest, 3 to 2.
Sales will Get Good Support.
The nine as it will face Califor
nia is well drilled and evenly bal
anced. Both the infield and out
field may be expected to give Sales
good support, and in this depart
ment of the game there are no
weak spots that are evident. At
the bat the averages of the players
show that there is not a great
amount of difference in their abil
ity, and while some are better than

others, nearly every man may be
depended upon to hit the ball.
What the Players Have Done.
Of the men who will play to
morrow, Captain Trowbridge has
had more experience than any man
on the squad. He played right
field on the 1903 team and short
stop on the 1904 Varsity, and will
occupy the same position to-mor*
row. Sales is a veteran of last sea
son, having pitched the second and
third gameß against California.
The other men in the infield are on
the Varsity for the first time. Both
Stott, the catcher, and Fenton, at
third, were well trained in the
Portland Academy before coming
to college. Bell, at second, played
baseball at Hoitt's school, and
made a good showing in the Aca
demic League last season. Presley
has played on his class teams. In
the outfield Lewis, a new man, will
be in left field. Lewis has played
on the second team for the last two
seasons and most of his knowledge
of the game has been gained here.
Colbert, last season's first base
man, will play in center field, and
Dudley in right field. The latter
played on the Varsity in two pre
liminary games last year, and, like
Lewis, has learned the game since
coming to Stanford.
Jack O'Connell to Umpire.
Jack O'Connell, a former Coast
League umpire, well known in
baseball circles in California, will
officiate in to-morrow's game.
Second Game at Stanford.
The second intercollegiate game
will be played on the Stanford
campus a week from to-morrow,
and should a third game be neces
sary to decide the series it will
probably be played in San Fran
cisco on April 22d.

of the game has been gained here.
Colbert, last season's first base
man, will play in center field, and
Dudley in right field. The latter
played on the Varsity in two pre
liminary games last year, and, like
Lewis, has learned the game since
coming to Stanford.
Jack O'Connell to Umpire.
Jack O'Connell, a former Coast
League umpire, well known in
baseball circles in California, will
officiate in to-morrow's game.
Second Game at Stanford.
The second intercollegiate game
will be played on the Stanford
campus a week from to-morrow,
and should a third game be neces

probably be played in San Fran

STANFORD will meet the Uni
versity of California to-mor
row in the first baseball game of the
intercollegiate series of the season of
1905. The contest will take place
on the California diamond in the
afternoon at 2:30. Not since
the season of 1898 has the Cardinal
been victorious in a series with the
nine from the State institution, but
the chances of winning to-morrow's
game are good. The game will be
played on California's own dia
mond, as was the first contest last
year, and this is a decided advan
tage to the home team. This
handicap will be the greater this
year, as Stanford will put prac
tically a team of new men in the
field. California, on the other
hand, has a nine composed almost
entirely of veterans.
A comparison of the strength of
the two nines from their playing
this year shows Stanford a stronger
defensive team than the Blue and
Gold. This was true of the team
that played California last season.

The Cardinal is probably a better
fielding team at present, and with
Sales in the pitcher's position,
should prove very difficult to score
on, provided the unseasoned men
play up to the form that they have
been showing in practice.
Much Depends on the Batting'.
The result of the contest will de
pend largely on the batting of the
two teams, and it is here that Cali
fornia is credited with being su
perior to Stanford. This proved
true last year and was responsible
for California's victory in two
games out of three. The Stanford
Varsity, from the showing
made in the last few games, cannot
be considered as weak in this de
partment of the game. While
not what would be styled a nine of
heavy hitters, the work of the men
has been such as to expect them
not to prove weak in this depart
ment of the game to-morrow.
Comparing the opposing bat
teries, Sales should prove the su
perior of Heitmuller, and Stott
should hold his own with Bliss.
Both pitchers have had experience
in intercollegiate contests, and
Heitmuller more than Sales; but
the Stnnford twirler possesses a
greater variety of curves than his
opponent. Behind the bat Bliss is
a veteran of two seasons, but Stott
is not h novice at the game and
has played first-class ball lately.

One manner of comparing the
two nines is by the opinion of their
two principal opponents in the
preliminary games. Santa Clara
is of the opinion that Stanford has
better chances of winning to-mor
row, while St. Mary's College of
Oakland is inclined to think that
California will prove the winner.
Team Will Be Well Rounded.
Reviewing the present season
shows that a well-rounded, strong
nine has been developed from a
large squad of what was relatively
poor material. Stanford started
the season with four veterans of
last year —Trowbridge, Sales, Col
bert, and Chalmers. From a squad
of nearly sixty men Coach Cowden
early sifted the candidates down to
a small number and started in the
task of developing Varsity men.
His work was only well started
when the schedule of practice
games was upset by the death of
Mrs. Stanford. Practice games are
essential to make a seasoned team
out of new material, and under the
handicap in the middle of the sea
son the good showing made in yes
terday's game was remarkable.
From the scores of the prelimi
nary games nothing can be gained
to show the relative merits of Cali
fornia and Stanford, but the im
provement of the Cardinal can be
seen by comparing the first and last
preliminary games. In the first
contest Stanford was shut out by
Santa Clara, the score being 7 to 0,
and the Varsity was credited with
only one hit; while yesterday,
against the same nine, they made
seven hits, and were defeated in a
hard-fought contest, 3 to 2.
Sales will Get Good Support.
The nine as it will face Califor
nia is well drilled and evenly bal
anced. Both the infield and out
field may be expected to give Sales
good support, and in this depart
ment of the game there are no
weak spots that are evident. At
the bat the averages of the players
show that there is not a great
amount of difference in their abil
ity, and while some are better than

others, nearly every man may be
depended upon to hit the ball.
What the Players Have Done.
Of the men who will play to
morrow, Captain Trowbridge has
had more experience than any man
on the squad. He played right
field on the 1903 team and short
stop on the 1904 Varsity, and will
occupy the same position to-mor*
row. Sales is a veteran of last sea
son, having pitched the second and
third gameß against California.
The other men in the infield are on
the Varsity for the first time. Both
Stott, the catcher, and Fenton, at
third, were well trained in the
Portland Academy before coming
to college. Bell, at second, played
baseball at Hoitt's school, and
made a good showing in the Aca
demic League last season. Presley
has played on his class teams. In
the outfield Lewis, a new man, will
be in left field. Lewis has played
on the second team for the last two
seasons and most of his knowledge
of the game has been gained here.
Colbert, last season's first base
man, will play in center field, and
Dudley in right field. The latter
played on the Varsity in two pre
liminary games last year, and, like
