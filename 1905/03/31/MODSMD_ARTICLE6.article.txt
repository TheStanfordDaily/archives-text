# CHESS TEAM CHOSEN.
## Seven Men Picked from Fifteen Candidates to Play University of California. 
### 
After a long tournament, the
Stanford chess team lias been
chosen. The university will be
strongly represented in the coming
matches with California. Of the
seven men who will compose the
team, five have played for Stanford
before. H. VV. Strong, '06, F. P.
Whitaker, '0.5, E. \V. Doane, '05, G.
E. Dole, '07, M. M. Stearns, '06, A.
R. MacSwain,'oB, and R. A. Fuller,
'05, are the successful players.
Strong is an old player and has
been on the Varsity team for the
past two years,winning his matches
with the California man each time.
He demonstrated his ability in the
try-out tournament, winning all
his games, which stamps him as
the best player now in college.
Fuller is another old player, and
one of the strongest on the team.
This is his third year at the game.
Stearns and Whitaker are also good
men, the former having won a game
in the California match last year,
and the latter having been a mem
ber of the 1903 team. Dole was
alternate last year. Doane and
Mac Swain are the new men. The
latter made a reputation last fall
by winning the tournament which
was held then. An alternate has
not yet been selected, but to L.
Newland, '08, this honor will prob
ably fall.
The match with California will
be played in two parts, Whitaker
and Mac Swain, who are on the
track, playing two California track
men on April 12th. This arrange
ment is made to prevent any inter
ruption in their training. On the
evening of Friday, April 14th, the
principal match will be played in
the rooms of the Mechanics' Insti
tute Chess and Checker Club of
San Francisco. Wallace E. Nevill,
the chess expert who gave exhibi
tions here last fall, will probably
referee both matches.
