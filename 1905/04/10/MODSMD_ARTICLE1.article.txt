# STANFORD LOSES BASEBALL SERIES.
## Inability to Hit the Ball at the Opportune Moment Results in the Victory of California. 
### 
By winning the second game of the series last Saturday California cap
tured the intercollegiate baseball championship for the seventh consecutive
season. Stanford lost the series this year mainly because of the inability of
the men to hit safely at critical times. Weak hitting has been one of the
principal defects of Stanford teams for several seasons past, and this year
was no exception. California, on the other hand, had a heavy-hitting team
of veterans who could be depended upon to hit the ball when men were on the
bases. The outlook for next year is good, as Stanford loses only two men,
Captain Trowbridge and Lewis.

IN the first game of the intercol
legiate series, played on April
Ist at Berkeley, California defeated
Stanford by the score of 3 to 2.
The contest was not as close as the
score would indicate, however, as
the California nine kept Stanford
from scoring up to the ninth in
ning, when Fenton brought the
bleachers to their feet by knocking
a home run which scored two runs.
Neither Heitmuller nor Sales was
very effective, the former allowing
nine hits and the latter eleven, and
together they struck out only five
men. Although California made
twice the number of errors that
were charged to Stanford, the lat
ter's occurred when they proved
costly.
The game started with the Stan
ford batters hitting the ball square
ly, and it looked as if the Varsity
would solve Heitmuller's delivery
before long. California was the
first to score, Heitmuller and Strub
crossing the home plate for their
college. This was the result of
Heitmuller being hit by a pitched
ball, two hits, and an error. The
score stood 2 to 0 up to the seventh
inning.
Stanford had a chance to tie the
score in the sixth inning. With
two out Dudley hit safely, and Col
bert repeated the trick a moment
later. Trowbridge was hit by
Heitmuller, and this filled the
bases. The California pitcher
proved equal to the occasion by
striking out Stott and retiring the
side. This was Stanford's last
chance to score until the sensa
tional finish in the last inning.
California had added one more run
to her total in the seventh, making
the score 3 to 0.
With two out in the ninth in
ning, it looked as if the game
would end without Stanford scor
ing; but Fenton hit the pitched
ball into the right field and scored
Bell and himself before the
ball could be fielded in. Presley
hit to short-stop, who threw him
out at first, and the game ended
with the final score 3 to 2. The

STORY OF THE SECOND GAME.
California won the second game
on Saturday by rallying in the
fifth inning and overcoming Stan
ford's lead of one run which the
Varsity had maintained up to
that time. By her victor)' in this
game, making it two straight,
California wins the intercollegiate
contest of 1905.
The loss of the Blue and Gold
battery, Heitmuller and Bliss, who
were declared professionals by the
California athletic committee, was
expected to prove a serious handi
cap to their team, but Newman
and Strub ably filled the positions,
and were thought by some to have
played better ball than the men
they displaced.
It was the same story that has
been told of previous intercollegi
ate contests —the Varsity was weak
at batting, and California's hits
came when they were needed.
Early in the contest it looked as
though Stanford would win easily.
Newman, the California pitcher,
showed that he was very nervous,
and after striking out Chalmers,
walked Dudley, who immediately
stole second. Fenton bunted safe
ly and Dudley went to third. Sales
was at bat and it looked as if
Stanford would surely score, but
California's captain was expecting
the "bunt and run" play and sig
nalled for a high ball. Sales was
unable to reach it and Strub
caught Dudley as he made a dash
for the plate, and turning quickly,
threw to Giliis, who put Fenton
out at second. This double play

retired the side, and Stanford's
greatest chance to win the game
was gone.
Newman seemed to gain confi
dence as the game progressed, but
in the third inning the Varsity
succeeded in scoring. With one
out, Stott was safe on a bunt and
stole second. He advanced to
third while Chalmers was being
put out and scored on Dudley's hit
over third base. Stanford kept
the lead up to the fifth inning,
when California scored two runs.
Sweezy went to first on a base on
balls and stole second while New
man was striking out. Causly
then hit a clean two-base hit over
Trowbridge and Sweezy crossed
the plate with the first tally of the
game for California. Gillis hit to
Bell, who fielded a difficult chance,
but threw wild over first base, and
by the time Presley had recovered
the ball Causly had scored the sec
ond run and Gillis was on second.
The next two California men
knocked fiy balls, which were safe
ly gathered in.
California got two hits in both
the sixth and eighth innings, and
each time a man scored, Gunn
reaching 'home in the sixth and
Graham in the eighth. This
brought the final score up to 4 to 1.
Twice after the third inning Stan
ford got a runner as far as third
base, but both times the batter
failed to hit safely and allow him
to score.
The finish of the game was a
cleverly executed double play.
With one out Fenton reached first
on an error, but the next minute
Sales hit to the short-stop, who
quickly threw to second, putting
Fenton out, and then Gillis threw
to first before Sales reached there.
