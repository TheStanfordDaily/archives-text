# Prize Offered to Debaters.
## 
### 
George C. Ross, an attorney of
Redwood City, has placed in the
hands of President Jordan a check
for $100 to be given by him to the
team winning the coming inter
collegiate debate. Mr. Ross made
a similar gift last year, the prize
going to the Stanford debaters.
