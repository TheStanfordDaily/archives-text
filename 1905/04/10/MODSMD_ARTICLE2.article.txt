###

ington crew here to-morrow.
Manager Barrett and Coach Gai
ther have discovered a rowing
course on the bay which will prob
ably be tried in the contest with
Washington. The new course is at
Sausalito, where there is a straight
away about two and one-half miles
long. The water here is usually
calm, the course being sheltered
from all north and west winds. It
is also free from currents. An
electric railway runs along the
shore of the bay for the full length
of the course and would carry a
large number of spectators. The
races can also be viewed from
launches, which can be present in
any number because of the large
expanse of open water on the east
side of the course.
In case Washington will agree to
hold the regatta Friday, the con
test will occur at Sausalito; but
if held on Thursday the race will
undoubtedly be rowed over the
Redwood City course.
A Varsity crew has not yet been
picked, but the men who have done
the best work thus far and who will
row against Washington are as fol
lows: Stroke, W. H. Dole (cap
tain); No. 3, F. Zimmerman; No.
2, B. Bryan; bow, H. G. Butter
field. E. V. Henley and C. W.
Henderson have both been doing
good work at coxswain,with chances
slightly in favor of the former.
