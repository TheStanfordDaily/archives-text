The action of the faculty athletic
committee of the University of
California in canceling the amateur
standing of two varsity baseball
players in the middle of the inter
collegiate series must arouse the
keenest admiration. Its effect upon
college baseball, too, must be great.
It has long been known that
the players of both universities
have been violating the amateur
rule during the summer vacation
months, and even during the col
lege year, by playing with profes
sional teams, the presumption being
that their work was not unre
warded. It has not been easy to
secure proof against the offenders,
and the consequent impunity has
served to spread the evil. This
year some of the Stanford players
were individually warned that if
they took part in any outside game
without special permission they
would be dropped from the varsity
squad at once, and this admoni
tion is believed to have had the de
sired results. The action of the
University of California must
convince the athletes of that college
of the determination to clean out
these semi-professional players. It
is a bitter lesson, but it was a
manly,straightforward thing to do.
