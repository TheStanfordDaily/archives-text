# CALIFORNIA GIRLS WIN.
## Stanford Tennis Representatives Play Plucky Game, but Are Outclassed. 
### 
In the third annual girls' tennis
match, played last Saturday morn
ing on the Roble courts, the Cali
fornia team succeeded in carrying
off the honors in all three events,
winning both singles matches by
decisive scores, and taking the
doubles match after a close and
well-fought struggle. The showing
made by the Stanford girls was
very creditable, especially in the
doubles match, where they made a
determined stand against their
more experienced opponents.
At the request of the Stanford
players the doubles event was
played first, California conceding
the point at the last moment. Miss
Mabel Ray, '05, and Miss Georgia
Pitman, '05, who represented Stan
ford, went to the front at the start
and soon had a lead of four games
to one over their opponents, Miss
Marian Edwards and Miss Gladys
Wickson of California, in the first
set of the match. At this point,
however, the California team
steadied down, pulling the next
game out from love-thirty, and
winning the set without the loss of
another game.
The second set was a repetition
of the first, Stanford making the
score four to one, as before, and
then losing four straight games.
With the match apparently lost,
the Stanford team here won three
straight gamesand theset. Theeffort
had been too severe upon the play
erß, however, and in the deciding
set Miss Ray and Miss Pitman
weakened, allowing California to
win out by the ecore of 6-3.
While outclassed in both the
singles matches, both the Stanford
players did all that could be ex
pected of them. Miss Mabel Ray,
Stanford's be6t player, was opposed
to Miss Ethel Radcliffe, and lost
by the score of 6-1, 6-2. Miss
Radcliffe last July won the State
championship at San Rafael. Miss
Edwards of California, who defeated
Miss E. D. Owen, '07, of Stanford,
6-0, 7-5, is also one of the best
girl tennis players in the State,
having won the championship of
San Francisco two years ago, and
having played second to Miss Rad
cliffe in the Slate championship
tournament.
California has now won two and
Stanford one of the girls' tennis
matches.
