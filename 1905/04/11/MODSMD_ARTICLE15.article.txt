# High Jump Record Broken.
## 
### 
In the Academic Athletic League
field meet, held on the Berkeley
oval last Saturday, a new Coast
record for the high jump was made
by Hall of the Oakland High
School, who cleared the bar at 6
feet 2 34-100 inches. The old
record was held by Patterson of
California, who made it in 1895.
