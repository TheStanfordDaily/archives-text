# LANAGAN IS ELIGIBLE.
## California Will Not Enter a Formal Protest Against the Crack Hurdler. 
### 
The question of the eligibility of
W. H. Lanagan, '05, to participate
in the intercollegiate Held - day
Saturday haH been satisfactorily
settled, and the crack hurdler will
compete for Stanford. No formal
protest against his entry was lodged
by the athletic authorities of Cali
fornia, but Trainer Christie of the
State University made certain
accusations against the Stanford
man which, if proven, would have
kept him from entering the meet.
These accusations were due to a
misunderstanding of the circum
stances of the case, and Christie
has rendered due reparation by
apologizing to the accused track
man and to the athletic authorities
of Stanford for his hasty words.
Lanagan needs only a few hours
to get his degree, and as most of
his required work is on a thesis, he
was able to carry it on in conjunc
tion with some practical mining
work which he was doing at Fol
eom. For this reason he did not
return to the campus until the
registration limit had almost ex
pired. Before that time and since
his return to the university Lana
gan has been in good standing, and
the faculty athletic committee of
Stanford passed his name without
question when the list of eligible
track men was sent to the Univer
sity of California. Recognizing
that Lanagan's late registration
might cause unfavorable comment
at California if the circumstances
of the case were unknown there,
Dr. Angell sent Colonel Edwards
an explanatory letter with the list
of Stanford eligibles.
As soon as this letter was shown
to Trainer Christie and the mem
bers of the California track team
who had protested, they professed
themselves as satisfied with the
eligibility of the crack hurdler, and
the matter was at once dropped.
