# DR. HENRY VAN DYKE SPEAKS.
## Delivers Interesting Address Before a Large Meeting of the English Club. 
### 
One of the most interesting
meetings of the English Club that
has occurred during the past year
was held last night at the Delta
Gamma house in the nature of a
reception to Dr. Henry Van Dyke,
the famous American poet, critic
and stylist. The English Club has
never before had the opportunity
of welcoming to Stanford so promi
nent a writer as Dr. Van Dyke,
and the occasion brought almost
all the members of the organization
together, with a large number of
their friends.
Besides relating in a very charm
ing manner certain reminiscences
of his personal acquaintance with
Lord Tennyson, Dr. Van Dyke read
a number of selections from the
poet's works, giving in several in
stances imitations of the way
Tennyson himself interpreted them.
He gave a delightful account of a
visit to the poet's summer home
only six weeks before Tennyson
died in 1892, giving a picture of
his home life, of his devotion to his
work even at the age of eighty-two,
of Hallam Tennyson's devotion to
his father during his last days,
and many little instances showing
Tennyson's strange but beautiful
character, his attitude toward
others, especially critics, and
toward his own works.
Although his voice showed the
effects of the severe strain that has
been put upon it since his arrival
on the Coast, there was nothing
that could lessen the pleasure of
hearing the animated flow of
thought, the exquisite diction, the
pleasing interpolation of humorous
with serious discourse, which
characterized Dr. Van Dyke's ad
dress. In his reading the weari
ness of his voice was more notice
able, but his mastery of interpreta
tion was still wonderfully apparent.
Among his readings were selections
from "Autumn" and "Spring,'' and
the "Charge of the Three Hundred."
At the business meeting of the
club, the executive committee re
ported the following newly-elected
members: Miss H. L. Darby, '05,
Miss L. V. Davis, '06, and C. B.
Win tier, '05.
