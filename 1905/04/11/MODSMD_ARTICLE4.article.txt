Chairman Edwards of the play
committee and D. M. Reynolds,'os,
stage manager, spent several days
last week in San Francisco secur
ing scenery and making the neces
sary arrangements for the calcium
lights and the electrical effects to
be used in the production. The
scenery has been secured from the
Columbia and Tivoli theaters of
San Francisco, and will be the most
elaborate ever seen on the Stanford
stage. Part of the scenery and a
special drop, with transparencies
for light effects, are being painted
by San Francisco artists specially
for the coming production.
The costumes are now completed,
and dress rehearsals will begin in
a few days. The gowns for both
the chorus and the leads were made
after special designs made with
reference to the exact part in the
stage picture which the wearer is to
occupy. The color scheme of the
whole setting has been worked out
very carefully, and colored paint
ings have been made of all the
different scenes. The cast is com
posed of forty-five members, eight
of whom have speaking parts. The
male chorus is composed of twelve
students, and the girls'chorus com
poses the remainder of the cast.
