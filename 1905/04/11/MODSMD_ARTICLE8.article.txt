The action of the California fac
ulty athletic committee in cancel
ing the amateur standing of base
hall men who played with a semi
professional team calls attention to
somewhat similar abuses among
the football men. In a city of the
Pacific Coast a game was played
during the Christmas holidays in
which one of Stanford's best Var
sity men took part. We reprint a
single paragraph of the published
report:
There was some rough work
strewn through the game. Slug
ging and holding is not permissible
according to the rules, and perhaps
Walter Camp would have been
shocked had he been present. In
this country, however, this football
critic, while he is esteemed, does
not count when the game is actu
ally on. When it came to rough
ness, the players were unques
tionably the greater offenders.
They held, and they passed out a
few choice collections of stiff-arms
and wallops; but pshaw! who cares
if there is slugging when both sides
have an even break at the game.
The officials could have retired the
offenders, but if they had, they
would have stopped both teams,
and there would have been no
game.
The criticism is perhaps a little
exaggerated, for the Stanford man
who participated has shown by his
work here that he is a clean player;
but there must have been fairly
substantial basis for the state
ments. Our purpose in reprinting
the paragraph is to give an idea of
the kind of criticism not infre
quently made of these post-season
outside games, and to ask whether
it is worth while for any Stanford
athlete to be mixed up in them.
These games mean very little to a
college football player, and they
reflect no credit on his university.
The teams are commonly drawn
from all walks of life, representing
nothing but a name, and very
often the game stirs up a great
deal of sectional animosity. It

is the common belief that
each player receives a very
liberal allowance "for expenses."
This is difficult to prove, but, we
repeat, it is commonly accepted as
fact, and we believe we betray no
confidence in saying that the fac
ulty committees of both Stanford
and California will make an ex
ample of the first man against
whom positive evidence can be
procured. A year ago an effort
was made to get several Stanford
men to play on an "All-Califor
nia" eleven against the Carlisle
Indians. It was a money-making
scheme, pure and simple, and the
inference was that the players
were not to work for the love of
the sport alone. Four Stanford
Varsity men did take part in that
game, against the wishes of the
faculty athletic committee. None
of them has, as a player, taken
part in Stanford football Bince.
Participation in these outside
games leads to unpleasantness and
suspicion. It would be onerous to
say that a man shall not plav
away from the university without
consent, but a man's good judg
ment might counsel him to leave
this kind of game alone.
