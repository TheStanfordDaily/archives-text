The apology of Trainer Christie
of the University of California for
his recent outbreak in the case of a
Stanford athlete of whose standing
he was in doubt is but small repar
ation for his offense. The eligibil
ity of the man in question had
been passed upon by the managers
and the faculty athletic commit
tees of the two uni verities, whose
duty it is to deal with such matters.
The public attack upon these com
mittees by a man employed to at
tend solely to the physical needs of
the track candidates was an insult
to the representative men who com
pose the committees; and the prac
tical assertion that Stanford was
paying the athlete's railroad fare
was an added gratuitous insult to
the man himself and to his univer
sity. Apologies for offenses of this
kind do little good: the charges
have been given wide circulation
and have done their harm. For
the sake of amateur sport and to
preserve the amity of the two uni
versities, it is to be hoped that
Colonel Edwards of the University
of California will place a muzzle
upon this subordinate official who
undertakes to settle through the
medium of the public press ques
tions that do not lie in his prov
ince.
