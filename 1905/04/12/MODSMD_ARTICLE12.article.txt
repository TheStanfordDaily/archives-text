In another column will be found
a communication which will warm
the hearts of the hundreds of vic
tims of the vicious system of sell
ing tickets that exists here. It is
an undoubted advantage to many
busy neople to have an agent pur
chase their seats, but the number
that may be bought should be lim
ited. It is rank injustice to have
the best seats bought up by the
first two or three persons in the
line. The English Club ha√ü set an
excellent example in iimiting the
number of tickets to be bought by

a single person to ten ; by this
means individual purchasers wiW
be able to secure a fairer chance.
