## 
### 
Work on the athletic field is
progressing favorably. The setting
of the grade slakes has been com
pleted and the grading will com
mence as soon as the contracts
have been let. It has been found
necessary to cut a number of trees
from the field. The wood is to be
sold to defray the expense of taking
out the stumps. Two roads have
been graded from University avenue
toward the border of the grounds
near the faculty club-house, and a
third one will be cut through soon.
