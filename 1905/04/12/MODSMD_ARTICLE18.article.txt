Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Any student who stood in line
for an hour or more this morning
at the sale of tickets for the Junior
opera had a fine opportunity to
ponder over the gross injustice of
the present method of selling tick
ets for university entertainments,
etc. Certain features of the system
now in vogue would not he toler
ated off the campus, and others
should not exist in a college com
munity where consideration for
others is supposed to he more in
evidence than "out in the world."
Among the defects in the present
system which may be pointed out
is the sale of tickets to "specula
tors." The use of this term may
be disputed, but it covers the
offense as practiced here. The real
speculator buys tickets and sells
them at an advance to late comers.
He runs the risk of having some of
these tickets left on his hands, and
so takes a chance in this operation.
But no reputable theater will sell
tickets to such a person. They
prefer to protect the patrons who
are willing to come to the box
office and purchase tickets for their
own use; they refuse to sell the
best seats in the house to men who
will resell them at an advance.
But the Stanford "speculator," at
present, runs no risk in his invest
ment. He buys thirty or forty
tickets on orders, sells them at an
advance, and takes the cream of
the house before the students who
do not believe in such practices
reach the window.
This should not be permitted, be
cause it permits the absentee to
profit at the expense of the stu
dent who patiently stands in line.
It will result in forcing every stu
dent to patronize the present "spec
ulators," for only by being "in on
the game" can he hope to secure a
reasonably good seat. And as the
university grows and the demand
for seats in the Assembly Hall in
creases, it will result in the pres
ence of the real speculator who will
buy up the best seats in the house
and resell them at a substantial
advance.
This evil can be so easily reme
died that its toleration should be
no longer permitted. It is too
much to expect the system of dis
posal by lot to be introducedâ€”al
though that has been suggested for
the football tickets; but the simple
process of limiting the number of
tickets sold to one man will meet
the difficulty. The management of
the English Club play have an
nounced that no person could buy
more than ten tickets. At their
sale there will be no repetition of
the scene of this morning, when
the first man in line took twenty
five minutes (actual count) to se
cure the best seats in the house for
his patrons. Let us hope that the
management of future entertain
ments will follow the lead of the
English Club. P. J. T.
