Several times during the past
year, Encina gymnasium has been
broken into by students and also by
small boys from neighboring towns.
The doors were securely fastened
and the intruders entered by an
open window in the locker-room,
or climbed to a second-story win
dow. As there are more than 300
lockers in one small room, it is
absolutely necessary to have one or
more windows open in that room
practically all the time. When all
the windows and doors have been
securely fastened, entrance has
been effected by smashing the
glass and unfastening the window.
From time to time property has
been taken from the building.
Any one wishing to enter the
building on business when the
doors are locked may do so by ob
taining the key from the gymnas
ium director.
Therefore, notice is hereby given
that any one entering the building
when all the doors are locked will
be severely dealt with by the uni
versity authorities.
