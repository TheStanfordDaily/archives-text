# Interfraternity Baseball Plans.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the managers of
the fraternity baseball teams held
last night, arrangements were made
for a tournament to be played for
the fraternity cup, which was won
last year by Phi Delta Theta. Fif
teen fraternities have entered teams
and the tournament will be played
off along the lines of a tennis tourna
ment, the losers dropping out and
the winners playing down to the
finals. Varsity players are not
barred. All of the preliminary
games must be played off by Fri
day, April 21st. The cup must be
won three times to become the per
manent property of any fraternity.
The drawings for the first round
are as follows: Sigma Chi vs. Delta
Upsilon, Delta Kappa Epsilon vs.
Kappa Alpha, Zeta Psi vs. Kappa
Sigma, Delta Tan Delta vs. Phi
Kappa Psi, Beta Theta Pi vs. Chi
