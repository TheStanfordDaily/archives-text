The fact that a number of Stan
ford visitors to Kings mountain
have come away without paying
for their meals and accommoda
tions at that resort ia particularly
regrettable. Some years ago it
was considered the proper thing
among a certain class of college
men to evade the p tyment of hotel
bills whenever they could, and
even to annex some hotel property
as souvenirs, especially valuable if
it bore the name of the hostelry
from which it was taken. Gradu
ally, however, college men became
ho common that the world began
to hold them to the standards of
honesty that governed ordinary
persons, and the light of truth has
been so borne in upon them that
the majority of students nowadays
may be permitted to depart from
cafes or hotels without being
searched. This old practice had
the justification that it was a
phase of insanity in youth per
mitted by long practice, and that
the articles were taken not for their
intrinsic value, but simply to show
what an adept "collector" the young
man might be. Usually, too, the
victims were well able to stand the
loss. The new practice of defraud
ing a reputable widow who is strug
gling hard upon a lonely mountain
top to win the daily bread for her
self and her family has none of
these justifications. It is simply a
vulgar swindle, and the Stanford
career of the perpetrators will un
doubtedly be promptly terminated,
with vast benefit to the university.
