ics' Institute in San Francisco the
annual chess match between Stan
ford and California will be played,
with the prospects for a Cardinal
victory the brightest in the history
of intercollegiate matches. Already
one out of the seven games has been

won. To the other Bix men who
will play Friday, we hold out our
strongest wishes for an equal
measure of success. To the men
who have given their time and
energy to the cause of chess at
Stanford during the past year, and
have made it possible for ub to hope
for something better than a draw,
we would say that they may play
in to-morrow's matches with a
realization that their work is ap
preciated whether they win or lose.
