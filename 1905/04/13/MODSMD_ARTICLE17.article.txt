# Training House Board Meets.
## 
### 
The directors of the Training
House Corporation met yesterday
for the purpose of considering bids
for the grading of the new athletic
field. Nothing definite was ac
complished owing to the fact that
several bids have not yet been re
ceived. These will probably be in
by Saturday, so that the contract
can be let early next week.
The agreement between the
Training House Corporation and
the Hoard of Trustees by which the
transfer of the land granted for the
athletic grounds is made, will
probabl}' be signed next week. As
soon as this is done and the grad
ing contract let., the work will be
pressed as rapidly as possible. The
plans for the football bleachers are
being drawn by Professor C. B.
Wing of the Engineering depart
ment and are practically complete.
The contract for the building of the

football field will be let before ihe
end of the semester, probably at
the regular May meeting of the
corporation.
