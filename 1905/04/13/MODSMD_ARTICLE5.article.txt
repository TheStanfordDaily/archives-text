# Sale of Track Meet Tickets.
## 
### 
Up to noon to-day two hundred
tickets for the Intercollegiate track
meet had been sold by Manager
Barrett. Most of these tickets
called for seats in the section re
served for Stanford, but a few of
the dollar seats were also sold.
Owing to the fact that the tickets
are reserved by sections, but do not
call for particular seats, there will
be ample opportunity to obtain
good seats before Friday afternoon.
The sale will be continued at the
quad box-office to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock.
