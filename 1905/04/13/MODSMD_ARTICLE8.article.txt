# GOOD RECORDS ON THE TRACK.
## Athletes Rounding Into Shape for Saturday's Intercollegiate Field-day. 
### 
The pleasant weather of the past
week has enabled the track men to
work bo steadily that a notable im
provement has been made in their
condition. With the exception of
of R. S. Carter, '0.5, all of the ath
letes are in fine fettle. Thequarter
miler injured a ligament of his leg
recently, and it mends so slowly
that there is little hope of his being
in form for the field-day. W. H.
Lanagan, '05, has recovered from
his recent attack of malaria, and is
rapidly rounding into form.
No trials have been run in the
long distances this week, as Trainer
Moulton does not like to work his
charges too hard during the last
few days before the meet. In the
dashes and weights, however, some
excellent records have been made.
Wood, '07, ran a hundred in 10:1,
and the two-twenty in 22:3. In
the shot-put Crawford surpassed
all of his previous efforts by putting
the weight 42 feet 4 inches.
C. E. Hyde is repeatedly throw
ing the hammer 135 feet, a distance
which will probably be good for a
place in that event this year.
A number of the sprinters are
daily being tried out over the 352
yards which each member of the
relay team must traverse. Macfar
land, '07, has done the distance in
40 flat, McNeil, '07, in 40:2, and
Severv, '08, in 41 seconds.
The relay team will probably bo
chosen from.the following runners:
Edwards, '07, Severy, '08, Russell,
'06, Macfarland, '07, McNeil, '07,
Davis, ! 08, and Carter, '05.
