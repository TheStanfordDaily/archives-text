TO-MORROW afternoon on the
University of California oval
Stanford will meet the athletes of
the State institution in the thir
teenth annual intercollegiate strug
gle for supremacy on track and
field. For two successive years the
Cardinal has been victorious in the
annual field-day, and if there are
not some surprising reversals of
form to-morrow, the coming meet
ought to witness a third victory for
Stanford. Judging from previous
records, it is safe to say that the
Stanford team will win to-morrow's
contest by the fair margin of nine
points. It is possible that the out
come of the field-day may hinge on
the result of the relay race, and
with this in mind, Trainer Moulton
will hold his relay men in reserve,
so that they will be practically fresh
for that event.
Men in the Fittest Condition.
At no time in the history of Stan
ford track athletics has the last
week of the training season found
the men in finer physical condition.
With one exception the track ath
letes are in superb form, and prac
tically every member of the team
is in shape to meet to-morrow's test
of strength and skill. Owing to the
balmy weather of the past two
weeks the team has rounded into
shape very rapidly, and the chief
concern of Trainer Moulton has
been to keep his charges "on edge"
for the impending contest. On ac
count of the number of big-muscled
men on the Stanford team a hot
afternoon to-morrow will greatly
increase the chances for a Cardinal
victory, and do much to lessen the
handicap imposed on it by a
strange track.
Starting out with the most ex
tensive schedule ever arranged for
a varsity track team, the dates
were one by one canceled, until the
track athletes had the privilege of
competition with an outside team
only once during the entire season.
But in spite of this handicap the
track candidates have trained faith
fully, and as the result of careful
coaching the raw men have devel
oped that form and confidence
which distinguishes the veteran

athlete. The spirits of the men
are excellent, and "Dad" Moulton
pronounces them as gritty a team
as he has ever trained.
Fair Chances in the Hundred.
In the 100-yards — California is
counting on winning all three
places, but the recent performances
of Wood in the short sprint give
rise to the hope that these calcula
tions may be upset. Edwards may
also prove a factor in that race.
Snedigar of California, who is cred
ited with a record of 10 flat, ought
to take first place in the hundred.
Golcher of California is covering
the distance in 10:2, and Schwartz
of California may be good for a
place if he can equal his prepara
tory school record.
Two-Twenty Will Be Exciting.
The 220-yard dash ought to pro
vide the most exciting race of the
day. Wood has run it in 22.3 sec
onds, the time which gave Dunn
first place over Snedigar last year,
and the speedy Californian will
have to clip some fractions of a
second from his best recorded time
if he hopes to break the tape first
in to-morrow's meet. Edwards will
make a hard fight for third place
in this race against Bingham and
Kleeberger of California.
Miller to Run the Quarter.
In the 440-yard dash Stanford
will depend on Miller to take first
place. Until he entered Stanford,
Miller had never seriously at
tempted the quarter, and his rapid
development in this race has been
little short of marvelous. If Miller
does not take first in the 440 to
morrow, the man who does will
run close to 50 fiat. Davis and
Edwards will contest with Ed
wards and Wilcox of California for
the other two places.
Hard Fight in the Half-Mile.
The 880-yard run will witness
one of the most interesting contests
of the day. By the time his name
is called for this race by the clerk
of the course Miller will have run
both the mile and the quarter, and
his showing will be problematical.
Presuming on his wonderful endur
ance and tenacity, it is quite safe
to predict that this athlete will be
well toward the front when the
finish is reached. Russell is a
hard worker in this race, and the
runner who beats him out for a
place will have to do better than
2:02. The other Stanford entries —
Bounds, Severy and Smith —have a
fighting chance of making a place.
California will pin her hopes on
Mishler, Clifford and Yost in this
race.
Miller Expected to Take Mile.
The mile is the first race on the

program, and with Miller entered
the Cardinal ought to win five
points in that event. Last year
Holman beat out Newhall and
Hackley in 4:41, hut since that
time Newhall has covered the dis
tance in 4:39, a fraction of a sec
ond better than Miller's best re
corded time. But Miller usually
runs no faster than he is compelled
to, and it is safe to say that New
hall must cover the distance in
4:35 or better to-morrow if he
hopes to deprive the fast Freshman
of first place. Hackley will save
himself for the two-mile run, and
not enter the mile. It is not ex
pected that other Stanford entries
will take a place from Meals,
Lyons and De Mamiel, the other
California milers.
Bright Prospects in the Hurdles.
With Lanagan, Weller, Macfar
land, and Horton entered in the
high hurdles, Stanford is loath to
concede California a single point;
but it is possible that Frei or
Meany of California may gain a
place in this event.
The Cardinal will be represented
by the same men in the low hur
dles, and the result ought to be
nine points for Stanford. Junk is
California's best hurdler.
The Outlook in the Jumps.
In the high jump Captain Bell
has a slight advantage over Hickey
of California and ought to win first
place by a narrow margin. Stan
ford is not counting on any other

places in the high jump, but Dehy
or Horton may take third place.
In the broad jump NVeller and
Bell ought to take second and
third places, and as both men
always perform better in competi
tion than in practice, the prospect
of a first place is a not remote pos
sibility.
Three Stanford men —Lanagan,
Whitaker, and Kocher —are ex
pected to clear the bar in the pole
vault at a greater height than any
of the California vaulters can attain.
The Weights and the Relay.
The weights are always uncer
tain, but with Horton, C. E. Hyde,
and Crawford entered, at least one
point should be taken by the Car
dinal team in the shot-put. In the
hammer-throw Crawford has been
repeatedly throwing the weight be
tween 145 and 150 feet, but his
throws in actual competition sel
dom equal those made in practice.
From present indications the fol
lowing men will run the relay, in
the order named: Edwards, El well,
Freeman, Macfarland, and McNeil,
with Davis and Severv as possibili
ties.
