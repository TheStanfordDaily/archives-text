# RACE IS ABANDONED.
## Launch Fails to Appear to Carry the Stanford Shell to Sausalito. 
### 
Owing to an unfortunate mistake
or to carelessness, there was no race
between the crews of Stanford and
Washington to-day. The man who
had agreed to send a launch to Red
wood to take the Stanford boat to
Sausalito failed to keep his contract,
and apparently the crew was unable
to find another shell to row in.
