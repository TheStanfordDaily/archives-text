# TENNIS MATCH TO-MORROW.
## Stanford Players Prepared to Put Up a Hard Fight Against California. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 9 o'clock
the fifteenth annual intercollegiate
tennis match will be started on the
girls' tennis court at Berkeley. Of
the previous intercollegiate matches
California has won eight and Stan
ford five, and for the past four
seasons Stanford has been unable
to score even one of the three
points. The Stanford players will
go upon the courts with a strong
determination to break this long
series of defeats if possible, and at
least to get one of the contested
points.
During the past four seasons the
outcome of the matches has been
more or less of a foregone conclusion
owing to the presence on the Cali
fornia varsity of J. Drummond
MacGavin, '04, present champion
of the Pacific Coast in singles.
This year California will be with
out MacGavin's playing to rely on,
but she will be represented by a
strong trio of players, picked after
a long series of try-outs. Claude
Wayne, '07, who is her first-place
singles representative, is a crack
tennis player from Southern Cali
fornia, and has often figured in
southern interscholastic tourna
ments. F. Neill Baker, '06, who is
second-place man, occupied the
same place on last year's varsity,
winning his match on that occasion.
California's doubles team is com
posed of Wayne and R. F. Variel,
'06, the latter having been Mac-
Gavin's partner during the past
two seasons.
Stanford's chances of winning
the match depend almost entirely
upon the playing of George A.
Hodge, '06, who will face Wayne
in the singles, and with J. F. Cas
sell, '07, will play Wayne and
Variel in the doubles. Hodge has
been first-place man on the Varsity
for three seasons, and despite an
injury incurred late in the season,
should come very close to scoring
his point in the singles this year.
A. R. Mac Swain, who will be op
posed to Baker in the other singles
match, is a freshman, and plays a
hard, steady game that is difficult
to beat.
The two singles matches will be
played first, the first match be
ginning promptly at 9 o'clock.
