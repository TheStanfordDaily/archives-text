# DECORATE CALIFORNIA "C."
## Stanford Men Pay Unexpected Visit to the Campus of State University. 
### 
The big gold "C," recently erected
on the Berkeley hills to commemo
rate Charter day and the abolishing
of the freshman-sophomore rush,
last night underwent a transforma
tion which could not have been
pleasing to the wearers of the Blue
and Gold. When the early morn
ing mists had cleared away from
the hills it was found that the "C"
had become a mass of blazing
cardinal. This transformation
was effected through the efforts
of three Stanford men, who went
up to Berkeley late last night,
equipped with many yards of car
dinal bunting. The plan was
originally to transform the "C"
into a big Stanford "S," but this
was found impracticable, owing to
the great curve of the "C," which is
almost joined at the ends, so the
simpler expedient of changing its
color was adopted.
Latest reports from California
indicated that the "C" still retained
its cardinal hue, but a relief party
equipped with many cans of yellow
paint was already forming.
