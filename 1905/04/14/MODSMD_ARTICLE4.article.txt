To-morrow three Stanford teams
will meet the representatives of the
University of California on court,
track, and rostrum. In two of
these contests we have every rea
son to expect a victory, and in
tennis a Cardinal success is not im
possible. In the Beries of annual
athletic contests held with Califor
nia the track meet has come to oc
cupy a place of importance second
only to the big football game, and
a victory to-morrow will' do much
to increase interest in this clean
sport. It will be a hard, close con
test, but we believe the wearers of
the Cardinal have the spirit that
fights for Stanford and wins. The
tennis tournament and the track
meet will be held on the grounds of
our rival, but this handicap ought
to be offset by the loyal support of
our rooters. To the members of
the team who have worked faith
fully for the honor of representing
their college the university extends
its heartiest wishes for unlimited
success in to-morrow's contests.
