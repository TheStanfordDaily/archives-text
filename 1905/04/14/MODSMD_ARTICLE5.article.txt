There hangs in the office of the
Daily Palo Alto a ten-foot piece
of heavy barbed wire, the instru
ment used in one of the most
vicious "practical jokes" or the
meanest petty crime ever perpe
trated upon tliis campus. This
vicious piece of cutting, tearing
wire was stretched across the bi
cycle path leading from the quad
rangle to Palo Alto last night, one
end being securely fixed to a post
in the road and the other attached
to the body of one of the palm
trees that line the pathway. It
hung unseen in the darkness, a
trap to catch the first wheelman
who should come that way. The
victim was a pressman of the
Daily Palo Alto, who owes his es
cape from serious injury to the fact
that he was riding slowly because

of the darkness. The wire struck
below the handlebars of the bicycle,
and the slight "give" in the wire
permitted the rider to dismount
quickly. Had the wire been a few
inches higher it would have muti
lated his arms and thrown him
from his seat. A trick of this kind
parses the point of a practical joke
and must have been done in a
spirit of meanness or crime, which
makes it appear probable that the
perpetrators were persons not con
nected with the university. If the
authorities of the university or the
town of Palo Alto care to make an
investigation, they will find the
mute evidence in this office.
