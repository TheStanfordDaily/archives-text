The Daily Palo Alto is in re
ceipt of a communication regard
ing the lights in the Library which
it has sent directly to the librarian
as the best means of accomplishing
the object sought. There is a good
deal of justice in the complaint
that many of the desks are without
lamps in the sockets, but the man
agement of the Library is conduct
ed with such uniform courtesy that
we believe a simple request at the
delivery desk for a lamp will al
ways find it forthcoming. What
ever the limitations of the Library,
there can be no question of the
earnest desire of all connected with
it to do the best with what they
have and to help the student in
every way possible.
