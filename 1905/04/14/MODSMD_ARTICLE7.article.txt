Scott being an especially good
man, having led Harvard against
Princeton in their annual debate
last year.

That the Interstate Commerce
Commission shall be given power
to fix and enforce railroad rates.
Note A—lt is understood that the
commission may be bo enlarged
and equipped as to enable it to
meet the new conditions. Note B
—The question of constitutionality
is to be disregarded."

ative, California the negative. The
