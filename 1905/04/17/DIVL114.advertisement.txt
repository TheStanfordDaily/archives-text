the net cost to the policy holder

Every premium = the mathematical cost + the expense loading.

Dividends are paid from the surplus arising from
1. Savings from the expected mortality.
2. Savings from the expense loading.
3. Interest earned in excess of the legal requirements.
4. Surrender charges.
5. Gain (or loss) on securities and property of the company.
The fundamentals are low death rate, low expense rate, good investments in
first-class securities.
