THE thirteenth annual field-day,
held on the University of
California oval Saturday afternoon,
wae lost by Stanford in the most
unsatisfactory meet ever held by
the two colleges. The final score
of to 49f does not in any de
gree represent the comparative
merits of the two teams, as the de
plorable condition of the field pre
vented the Stanford men from do
ing justice to their former records.
On the track, where endurance was
a more potent factor than skill or
chance, the Cardinal entries proved
themselves distinctly superior to
their opponents in all of the races
except the short dashes and the
half-mile. The track was sloppy,
and in some places the runners
had to wade in water ankle deep.
This could not have been prevented,
but the slippery condition of the
rings for the weights and the run
ways for the jumps was inexcus
able, as the digging of a few
trenches and the use of a few strips
of canvas would have kept them in
good shape.
Right at the beginning of the
meet the Cardinal hopes were
given a hard blow by the severe in
jury suffered by Wood, the crack
sprinter, in the first trial heat of
the 100 yards. A tendon of his
right thigh was so severely torn
that he will be laid up for several
weeks. With Wood out of it,
Stanford could not hope for any

thing better than a third place in
the 220 yards.
Miller the Star of the Day.
J. 0. Miller, '08, was the star
performer of the meet, and in point
of endurance he proved himself su
perior to any member of either
team. By winning eleven points
in three of the most gruelling races
of the day he demonstrated clearly
that he is the premier middle-dis
tance man on the Coast. On a
dry track he would undoubtedly
have justified the predictions of his
admirers by taking fifteen points
for his college. Second only to
Miller in the number of points
gained for Stanford was Horton,
another freshman, who won a total
of nine points.
Although there was no question
as to Miller's superiority in the
mile, this race was not without its
exciting features. After running
a well-judged race until the last
lap, the great miler passed all of
his competitors with a magnificent
burst of speed and flashed across
the line thirty yards in advance of
Meals of California, who finished
second, with Newhall of California
a poor third. The other Stanford
entries for this race, Shelton,
Knupp and Thomson, were un
placed, but they all ran a gritty
race. The time of 4:41 on such a
track stamps it as one of the great
est miles ever run on this Coaßt.
For the Blue and Gold Sperry
proved himself a great point-win
ner by gaining two firsts, a second
and one third place. His team
mate, Snedigar, won two firsts and
a third.
Heats in the Hundred.
In the first heat of the 100-yard
dash Snedigar won, with Klee
berger of California second and
Edwards of Stanford third. The
first two places in the second heat
went to California men, Golcher
and Neighbor, with Gartzmann of
Stanford finishing third. It was
in this heat that Wood injured his

leg and was compelled to retire
from further participation in the
meet. As no Stanford entry quali
fied for the finals of the hundred,
Snedigar trotted across the line,
with Kleeberger, Golcher, and
Neighbor hand in hand behind
him. The first heat of the 220
yards was won by Snedigar, with
Weller of Stanford second and
Bingham of California third. Ed
wards of Stanford won the second
heat, with Healy and Kleeberger
of California coming in second and
third. In the finals Edwards made
a hard fight for second place over
Healy, but he lost so much ground
on the difficult turn of the track
that he had to content himself
with third. Snedigar won the
final in the ordinary time of 24
flat.
Quarter an Exciting Contest.
The 440-yard dash was one of
the hardest fought races of the day
until the homestretch was reached,
when Miller drew away from the
field and won easily by five yards
from Edwards of California, who
beat out Carter of Stanford by a
scant foot. Davis of Stanford ran
a good race, holding the lead until
near the end of the distance, but
he did not have the strength left
for a sprinting finish. On a dry
track Davis would prove a formid
able apponent for any of the place
men in this event. The time of
54:1 was good for this race, consid
ering the condition of track.
Burr Captures the Two-Mile.
The two-mile run was one of the
best races of the day. Burr's fine
performance in the long distance
was not wholly a surprise to the
Stanford people who have watched
his good work all season, but the
overthrow of the California veter
ans by a comparative novice was
an unexpected blow to the Blue
and Gold spectators. To the judg
ment and speed of Geibel no small
part of the credit for Burr's great
race is due. By obeying his in

structions to the letter the young
runner was of great aid to his
teammate. Hackley, California's
captain, showed a flash of his old
time form when he took the lead
near the end of the race, but the
ease with which Burr passed him
seemed to dispirit the Blue and
Gold veteran, and he ran unplaced.
Moody of California won second
place after a sensational finish, in
which he succeeded in lessening
the gap between him and Burr to
four yards. Kelsey finished third,
eleven yards behind' Moody. The
race was run in the good time of
10:27.1.
After the grittiest kind of a fight
against odds, Miller took third
place in the 880 yards, with his
teammate, Russell, finishing second
to Mishler of California, who won
the race by six yards. Had Rus
sell made his sprint a little sooner
he might have won this race, as he
closed up a large gap between him
self and Mishler down the home
stretch. The winner covered the
distance in 2:05.2.
Hurdles Easy for Stanford.
With only two men entered in
the high hurdles, Stanford took
first and second places. Horton
won first place from Lanagan by a
foot, while Frei of California fin
ished third. The race was run in
17:1.
In the first heat of the low hur
dles Macfarland and Lanagan took
first and second and Golcher of
California third place. In the sec
ond heat Horton beat Meany and
Junck. The feature of this race
was Horton's headwork in making
a walking finish so as to make it
the slowest heat. As the two win
ners and the second man in the
fastest heat qualified, the three
Stanford men romped over the
sticks in the finals and finished
hand in hand.
Stanford Suffers in the Field.
It was in the field events that
Stanford began to suffer severe re-
verses, and the conditions were
euch-that the most heroic efforts
could not bring the Cardinal ath
letes within reach of their normal
records. In the hammer-throw
Crawford had to throw from grass
for the first time in his life.and the
best he could do was a throw of 139
feet 3 inches, which gave him third
place. Sperry's winning throw of
150 feet 24 inches was remarkable
under the circumstances. Zachar
ias took second place with a throw
of 141 feet 5 inches.
In the shot-put the slippery ring
precluded any possibility of a
record-breaking performance. Sper
ry put the weight 42 feet, Gilmore
made a put of 41 feet 7-£ inches,
and Horton took third place with
39 feet 5 inches.
Runways in Bad Condicion.
Not a single Stanford entry qual
ified for the broad jump. VVelier
succeeded in getting the take-off
several times, but his weight caused
him to slip and he could not make
a satisfactory jump. Captain Bell
could not get the take-off, which

was covered with mud. Neighbor
took first with a leap of 22 feet 5¾
inches, Sperry took second with 20
feet 11⅛ inches, and Snedigar third
with 20 feet 9 inches.
The pole-vault was another keen
disappointment to the Stanford
supporters. Form was out of the
question in this event, and chance
as much as anything else deter
mined the result. Zoph won with
a vault of 10 feet 5½ inches, and
Lanagan, Kocher and Schultz tied
for second at 10 feet 4½ inches.
The relay, usually the most ex
citing event of a field meet, proved
no exception Saturday. Until the
fourth relay it was practically an
even race, but Macfarland drew
away from Howard, leaving a gap
of 15 yards, which McNeil main
tained until the finish. The first
relay was run by Carter of Stanford
against Edwards of California, with
the advantage slightly in favor of
the Blue and Gold entry. This
lead was increased by Grunsky of
California over Elwell of Stanford,
but on the next lap Freeman of
Stanford won a slight lead over
Wilcox of California. Macfarland
increased the Cardinal lead in his
relay against Howard, and McNeil
made the race safe for Stanford by
maintaining the gap over Jones.
