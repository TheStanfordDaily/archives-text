# WIN DEBATE AND HEARST CUP
## Stanford Men Outclass California Team in Annual Intercollegiate Contest. 
### 
The fortunes of Saturday after
noon were in a measure retrieved
in the evening, when Stanford de
feated California in the thirteenth
annual intercollegiate debate. In
every feature of the discussion the
California men were completely
outclassed.
The Alhambra Theater in San
Francisco was the scene of the de
bate. In tne absence of President
Wheeler of California, Dr. C. A.
Duniway of the Stanford History
department presided. Promptly at
8 o'clock the chairman announced
the subject for discussion, "Re
solved, That the Interstate Com
merce Commission shall be given
power to fix and enforce railroad
rates. Note A—lt is understood
that the commission may be so en
larged and equipped as to enable
it to meet the new conditions.
Note B —The question of constitu
tionality is to be disregarded."
Twenty minutes was allotted to
each Bpeaker. D. D. Sales, '06,
opened the affirmative case for
Stanford. In a concise, well-pre
sented speech he showed the ne
cessity! for such reform as advo
cated by the affirmative. F. P.
Griffiths, beginning the argument
for California, admitted the exis
tence of evils, but claimed the plan
advocated by the affirmative was
impracticable. A. Sherriffs, '05,
resuming the debate for Stanford,
presented a practical working sys
tem of the proposed plan. The
second California speaker, H. A.
Stout, argued that the proposed
system would aggravate rather
than alleviate the evils. R. G.
Barnett, '05, in closing for the af
firmative, devoted his time to refu
tation of the negative argument
and summary of his colleagues'
contentions. J. W. Scott, the
much-heralded Harvard debater,
continued along the same general
lines as his colleagues. Scott was
the best California speaker, but his
showing did not fulfill expectations.
What little doubt there may
have been as to the result was soon
dispelled when Sherriffs completed
his ten-minute rebuttal immedi
ately afterward. This was the best
speech of the evening.
According to the agreeement, the
judges immediately cast their bal
lots without discussion and an
nounced a unanimous decision for
Stanford. They were H. U. Bran
denstein, E. S. Fowler and J. W.
Lilienthal.
By winning this debate —the
third in succession—the Hearst
cup, offered in 1903, becomes the
permanent property of Stanford
University. The winning team
also divided $100, offered as a
prize by George C. Ross of Belmont.
