# TENNIS MATCH UNFINISHED.
## Hodge Defeated by Wayne in a Close Contest.â€”Rain Interferes With Play. 
### 
Before two sets in the first singles
match of the fifteenth intercol
legiate tennis match had been
played Saturday morning on the
Hearst court at Berkeley, a light
drizzle set in, and soon a steady
downpour made it necessary to
postpone further play. When this
was finally done, California had
scored one of the points in singles,
after a hard-fought battle between
the two first-place men, and had
gained so marked a lead in the
second singles match that little
doubt remained as to the outcome.
Before the rain started in Stan
ford's prospects of scoring a point
looked brighter than on any other
occasion in the last five years. In
the first set of his match with
Claude Wayne, G. A.Hodge took
his opponent completely off his feet
with the brilliant style of play
which he adopted, and won easily
by the score of 6-2. In the second
set he speedily ran the score up to
2-0, when Wayne took a brace, and
after trying the score several times,
filially won out 6-4. At this point
the rain commenced, and after play
had been stopped and resumed a
number of times, the final set went
to Wayne by a score of 6-3. The
outcome of the match was disap
pointing in the extreme to Stanford,
as Hodge was unable to make use
of any of his fast strokes owing to
the heavy balls.
Seven games were played in the
second singles match before it be
came necessary to postpone it, and
the score stood 6-0, 1-0 in favor of
Neill Baker of California, who
clearly demonstrated his superior
ity over Stanford's representative,
A. R. MacSwain,'oB. Unless Mac-
Swain is able to overcome the lead,
both singles points must be con
ceded to California.
The remainder of this match and
the doubles will be played off on
the Berkeley court at 3 o'clock next
Wednesday afternoon. In the
doubles Hodge and Cassell will be
opposed to Wayne and R. F. H.
Variel of California.
