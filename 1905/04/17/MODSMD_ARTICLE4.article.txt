The intercollegiate contests held
Saturday witnessed a division of
the spoils by the two universities
engaged. The tennis tournament
remains undecided, and the cheÃŸS
match was a tie. In the afternoon
the State University won a bril
liant victory on track and field in
spite of the gallant struggle made
by the Stanford athletes. On the
rostrum after the field-day the
Stanford debaters won quite as de
cisive a victory over their Blue and
Gold opponents. Every man who
went forth to battle for his college
Saturday exerted his best efforts
to win, and those who met defeat
have no reason to feel ashamed.
