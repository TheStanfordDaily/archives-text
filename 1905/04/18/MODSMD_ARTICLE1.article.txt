### 
Dr. D. H. Campbell, professor of
Botany at Stanford during the
past thirteen years, has taken out
a leave of absence from the uni
versity for the year 1905-6,
which will enable him to make an
extensive trip through Europe,
Africa and Asia, and to accom
plish an amount of study abroad
along lines which he has contem
plated for a long time. Dr. Camp
bell will start shortly before the
close of the present semester, and
will not return until the opening
of college for the fall semester of
1906.
After a short stay in England,
which will be his first destination,
Dr. Campbell will go direct to
Vienna to attend the meeting of
the International Botanical Con
gress. He will then proceed to
South Africa, arriving at Cape
Town in time for the meeting of
the British Association for the Ad
vancement of Science. He will
also attend the second meeting of
the association, which takes place
a short time later at Johannesburg.
After this be will travel northward
across the country of the Boer war,
into the newly opened regions
about the Victoria and Zambesi
fallß. Having made certain im
portant botanical investigations in
this interesting region, he will «em
bark and sail for the Indies, pro
ceeding by way of Bombay and
Ceylon to Java. Considerable time
will be spent at the famous Bui
tenzorg Gardens in Java, and he
will then proceed homeward, cross
ing the Pacific, after having visited
the Philippine Islands and a few
points on the Chinese coast.
Before leaving for Europe next
month, Dr. Campbell will bring
out a second edition of his book on
"The Structure and Development
of Mosses and Ferns," published
some years ago.
