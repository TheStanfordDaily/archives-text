The decision of the faculty com
mittee on assemblies that there
shall be no more assemblies this
semester, "unless unusually dis
tinguished men shall become avail
able," is to be regretted. There
would seem to be no need of con
fining ourselves to "distinguished"
men ; what is wanted is men who
have something interesting to say,
and who know the subject with
which they deal. There are many
men —lawyers, physicians, scien
tists, soldiers, journalists, mer
chants —able, practical, but undis
tinguished — who could tell us
things of consequence, and of vastly
more interest than a recital of the
doings of the national convention
of some political or economic or
other association of long name, but
of little human sympathy. But
aside from what we learn .at
these assemblies, they have a still
greater value. Furnishing as they
do about the only opportunity for
all the students of the university to
get together on common ground,
they have done a great deal to weld
the interests of the undergraduates,
—to make the men pull together.
In short, they have tended to pro
mote the development of that spirit
of energy, loyalty and cleanness by
which the Stanford man is known.
We have had very few assemblies
this semester because of the sad
events of the past two months, and
consequently the complete aban
donment of the meetings for the
remaining weeks of the college year
is the more to be deplored.
