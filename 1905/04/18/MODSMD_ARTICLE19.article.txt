# DISMISSAL OF HEITMULLER.
## Statement of the Case by the Faculty Athletic Committee of California. 
### 
The importance of the recent
action of the faculty athletic com
mittee of the University of Califor
nia in canceling the amateur
standing of Pitcher Heitmuller and
Catcher Bliss of the Varsity base
hall team lends special interest to
the following official report of the
committee upon the case:
"During the week the faculty
athletic committee has been called
upon to investigate the amateur
standing of W. F. Heitmuller and
J. J. Bliss, whose names appear on
the list of those eligible to repre
sent California in baseball contests
with Stanford during the season of
1905.
"The essential facts established
to the satisfaction of the committee
by the investigation are:
"1. That on April 2d, W. F.
Heitmuller and J. J. Bliss played
with the Heeseman team of Oak
land against a Fresno team, at
Fresno, California, in a game of
baseball, both clubs being mem
bers of theCalifornia State League.
"2. That the Heeseman team of
Oakland is a semi-professional
team, including among its players
on April 2d at least one profes
sional player; and that Mr. Heit
muller and Mr. Bliss were cogni
zant of these facts.
"According to section 15, 'No
person shall compete who is not an
amateur.'
"Section 16 reads: 'An amateur
is defined as being one who has not
entered in any open competition or
for a stake, or entrance fee; or
under a fictitious name; or has not
competed with or against a profes
sional for any prize, or where an
admission fee is charged; or who
has not instructed, pursued, or as
sisted in the pursuit of athletic ex
ercises as a means of livelihood or
for gain or emolument. However,
no person shall lose his amateur
standing by playing against a pro
fessional for any prize or where
admission fee is charged, if it is
done under the auspices and bona
fide control of the university to
which he belongs.'
"The facts show that \V. F. Heit
muller and J. J. Bliss have sacri
ficed their amateur standing as de
fined in the intercollegiate agree
ment. As a necessary consequence,
they have been withdrawn from the
list of students eligible to represent
the University of California in in
tercollegiate contests.

Heitmuller admitted going to
Fresno and taking the place of
Constantine, a Pensacola sailor,
who was scheduled to fill first base
for the Oakland nine. Heitmuller
says that he did this as a favor to
the Oakland players, who needed a
man to replace the regular first
baseman, who was sick. The
Berkeley captain declared that he
was careful to register at the hotel
under his own name, and that he
was cautious to have his name on
the score-book on the field. He
denied that he played under an
assumed name, and declared that
he took no money for his services.
Heitmuller is debarred by the
action of the committee from play
ing on next year's football team, to
which he would otherwise have
been eligible.
