# BOAT RACE A GOOD CONTEST.
## Sausalito Course Proves to Be an Excellent Waterway for Intercollegiate Meets. 
### 
The crew of the University of
Washington defeated the Stanford
crew by a length over a two-mile
course yesterday at Sausalito. The
time was 10:30, ten seconds faster
than the time in which California
defeated Washington last Saturday
morning. Washington carried no
coxswain, and in order to compen
sate for the handicap carried thirty
nine pounds of shot in the stern.
The race was started at 11:30
after a previous unsuccessful at
tempt due to Washington's No. 3
breaking his oar. They were sent
off on an even start and pulled a
stroke of almost thirty-three to the
minute. The officials followed the
race in the launch Flyer, but were
unable to tell the result, as the
launch was too far astern. The
water was smooth, there being only
a slight wind blowing during the
forenoon.
Coach Knight of Washington acted
as starter, and R. H. Gaither, '06,
was judge of the finish. It was ex
ceedingly difficult to judge the fin
ish, as the crews were rowing away
from each other and crossed the
line a quarter of a mile apart.
The Washington crew was com
posed of Richard Gloster, bow and
steersman; G. Tilden, No. 2; Owen
Crim, No. 3; and D. Pullen, stroke.
The Stanford crew consisted of H.
G. Butterfield, '05, bow; B. Bryan,
No. 2; F. Zimmerman, No. 3;
W. H. Dole, stroke and captain;
and F. W. Turner, '08, coxswain.
Coach Knightof Washington was
much pleased with the Sausalito
course. The Washington crew
were highly pleased to find a course
here with smooth water. The
Stanford coaches and crew pro
nounced the course excellent for
rowing.
Since the successful termination
of this race it seems probable that
the course on Richardson's Bay will
become the meeting place for the
annual race between California and
Stanford.
