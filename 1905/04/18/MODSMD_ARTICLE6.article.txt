# MUSIC FOR ENGLISH PLAY.
## Elizabethan Players and Melodies Will Take the Place of the Modern Orchestra. 
### 
Id the coming productions of
"Every Man in His Humour," the
place of the modern orchestra is to
be taken by a group of players who
will present as nearly as possible
all the features of Elizabethan
stage music. They will be cos
tumed in Elizabethan fashion, will
occupy a box on the stage after the
manner of the players in the old
London theatres, and will play a
number of selections that have
been carefully made from old Eng
lish music of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. The usual
number of musicians appearing on
the Elizabethan stage was four,
and for the present performance a
string quartet has been selected,con
sisting of H. Barkan, '00, first vio
lin; J. C. Ilay, '07, second violin;
L. Langstroth, '08, cello; and E.
R. May, '06, viola.
The selections of old English
melodieß that will be rendered have
been chosen by Dr. B. C. Blodgett,
organist of the Memorial Church,
and include the following num
bers: "Heartsease," "It was a Lover
and his Lass," "Row Well, Ye
Mariners," "Daphne," "Turkey
lone." "The Spanish Paran."
Several of the pieces contain airs
that are unusually sweet, and the
music is altogether distinctively
Elizabethan, and of a sort that is
little heard to-day. After the old
usage, all six pieces are played
without pauses by the orchestra.
