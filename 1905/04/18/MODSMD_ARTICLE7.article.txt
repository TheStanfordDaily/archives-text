# FINAL DRESS REHEARSALS
## Scenery for "The Princess Enone" Putin Place.â€”Story of the Book. 
### 
The cast of the Junior opera,
"The Princese Enone," is holding
rehearsals every night this week,
and everything is ready for the
production Thursday evening. The
scenery arrived from San Francisco
this morning and was putin place
for the first dress rehearsal, which
will be held to-night in Assembly
Hall.
The book of the "Princess Enone"
is based upon an Aztec legend and
the scene is set in "a mystic vale
in Yucatan." This tropical setting
gives the authors an opportunity
to introduce a wealth of color in
both the costuming and in the
scenic effects. The legend upon
which the play is based is as fol
lows:
When the Aztec came down from
the north, overrunning the semi
civilized Toltecs or Margos, one
tribe was 6et aside by the conquer
ors in a walled city of Yucatan, to
be held as a reserve against the
prophesied time when the Aztec
empire should be threatened with
annihilation. To this end no
child was allowed to live that was
lame, halt or blind, and no in
truders from another race were
allowed to enter the city. When
Montezuma was finally overthrown
by Cortez, the story goes, the mes
sengers failed to reach the city, and
the Indians in the Southland still
recite the tale of the hidden tribe
awaiting the call for help.
