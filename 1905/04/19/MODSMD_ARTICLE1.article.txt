"TO-MORROW night in Assembly
1 Hali the Junior class will
present their opera, "The Princess
Enone." This week the cast has
been hard at work rehearsing for
to-morrow night's production. Last
night and to-night the final dress
rehearsals were held in Assembly
Hall. During the past week the
tickets have been on sale on the
campus and in Palo Alto, and
judging from the sale of seats the
Juniors will play before a crowded
house to-morrow evening.
The book of the " Princess Enone"
was written by I). M. Reynolds,'os,
of Pasadena, and the music was
composed by Homer F. Curran,'os,
of Denver. The lyrics were written
jointly by K. A. Bickel, '07, and
I). M. Reynolds. The production
is divided into two actß. The
scene is laid in a " mystic vale in
Yucatan," where two Stanford men
—one Professor Theodore Atherton
Boggs, head of the department of
archaeology, and Jack Thurston,
'06, have become lost in an endeavor
to locate a rumored band of Aztecs.
Thurston explains his predica
ment in the opening scene, when
he sings "A Brave Band of Ex
plorers." It appears that during
all this time the Aztec band have
been having their quota of troubles.
Every year they are deprived of
their ruler by the god Huitzal,
who, at the same time, however,
always leaves a sign by which they |
may correctly locate the unfor
tunate individual who is to act
as king of that particular Aztec,
valley during the ensuing year.
At the time of the opening of the i
play the band has iust lost its!
leader. They enter upon the stage,
led by the priest-captain, Taga.!
At the rear of the stage is an elab
orately-built altar, upon which
Thurston has deposited his "plug."|

On this characteristic bit of Junior
insignia is painted a Stanford "S."
At the same time Thurston is wear
ing a varsity " S " sweater. The
Aztec priest-captain sees the "plug"
with the "S" upon it. He at once
conceives it to lie the sacred sign,
and the band disperses to find the
new ruler.
While the search is going on,
Thurston and Boggs are captured
by a posse of Aztec police and
brought to the priest-captain for
trial. They are sentenced to death
and are about, to be executed when
Thurston takes off his coat, dis
playing the sought-for sign, the
Stanford "S." In an instant all

is changed. Thurston is hailed as
the deity's own, and is told to pre
pare for his marriage with an old
dowager.
The second act is occupied in
getting Boggs out of his difficulties
and "Enone" safely off to Stanford
with Thurston.
There are twenty-three musical
numbers in the opera. Reynolds
and Curran have had the "Stan
ford Memories" published, and it
will be on sale at the production to
morrow night.
