## 
### 
The contracts for the wiring and
plastering of the new Gymnasium
building have been let. The
Standard Electrical Construction
Company of San Francisco will do
the electrical worlc, and the plaster
ing contract has been given to Theo.
Heple of San Jose. The interior
wiring work in the new building
was begun to-day and the plasterers
will commence worlc next Monday.
Although the work is progressing
favorably, so much detail work re
mains to be done that it is not
probable that the new gymnasium

ber, 1906.
