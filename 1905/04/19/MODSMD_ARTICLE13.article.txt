DAVID S. JORDAN, Pres.

When the Junior class received
from President Jordan —or thought
it did —the right to take the wel
fare of the university on its shoul
ders and decide whether school
should be kept on Friday, there
was great rejoicing. The members
of the class, one and all, rallied at
the call of the president, and the
meeting that followed was the
largest in the history of the class.
They had, so they were led to be
lieve from written letter and per
sonal assurances, been promised the
usual holiday in which to celebrate
the fact that they were Juniors,
with the only condition that the
question of whether a holiday was
really desired should be put to a
vote of the class. The motion was
put, and with an eager shout it was
unanimously carried. The class
was proud, and the rest of the uni
versity was happy, except a few
teachers to whom a holiday is
always a sore grievance. The
honored president of the class bore
the glad tidings to the president of
the university, and common report
was that there was a perfect under
standing —an entente cordiale, the
French would say.
But the joy was too great to last.
When the president of the univer
sity awoke the next morning at an
early hour to peruse the Daily
Palo Alto, he read that there was
to be a holiday, and he was sur
prised, for he had made no official
announcement to that effect. He
ate his breakfast in haste, it is said,
and betook himself to his office
hurriedly to find out if he still had
desk-room there. Assured by the
usual respectful salutations that he
was yet head of the institution, he
dispatched messengers for the class
president, the careless youth who
had said that Friday the Juniors
might consider as their own, to do
with as they wished. The messen
gers scouted the length and breadth
of the quadrangle, the president of
the university meanwhile soothing
the ruffled feelings of the afore
mentioned teachers who feared a
lost opportunity to educate the
youth of the land.
Soon the quarry was taken. The
two presidents conferred —time, a
minute and a half, it is said. "You
can have the whole day if you in
sist, but I'd rather you didn't,"
said the president of the university.
The class president passed out
through the front door, and a dili
gent search this afternoon has
failed to discover him. A few min
utes afterward the above notice was
pasted on the bulletin-board out-
Bide the office of the president of
the universitv.
On Friday, April 21st, in recognition
