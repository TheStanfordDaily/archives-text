# Many Wish Names on Cover.
## 
### 
A large number of subscribers to
the Quad availed themselves of the
opportunity offered last week of
having their names inserted on the
cover of the book by paying in ad
vance. The present indications are
that the Junior annual will be
ready for distribution on May 3d.
Several of the forms are now on the
presses of the Sunset Company,
where the book is being printed this
year. The prospectus will be
mailed to members of the alumni
at once, and within a few days will
be distributed on the campus.
