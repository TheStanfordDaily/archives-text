We regret that the name of J. C.
Ray, '07, was last night left out of
the Junior opera cast as printed in
the Daily Palo Alto. The omis
sion was entirely the result of an
oversight. Mr. Ray will have the
part of Prince Charming, one of
the most important roles in the
piece. He needs no introduction
as an actor on the Stanford stage
because of his excellent work in the
Sophomore production of " Bob
Acres."
