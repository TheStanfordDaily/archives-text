# CALIFORNIA WINS TENNIS.
## Blue and Gold Players Score in Singles and Doubles for Fifth Consecutive Time. 
### 
The fifteenth annual tennis match
was finished yesterday afternoon
on the girls' court at Berkeley, and
for the fifth consecutive time the
team from the State University
won a decisive victory over the
Stanford players, taking all three
of the points contested in singles
and doubles. California has now
won ten intercollegiate tennis
matches to Stanford's five.
Play was started at 2 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, and was taken
up from the point at which it had
been abandoned last Saturday
morning, owing to the rain. Cali
fornia had already scored the first
point for singles, and in the second
singles match Neill Baker of Cali
fornia had already won a lead of
one set from A. R. Mac Swain, '08.
In the remainder of his match
with Baker, Mac Swain exhibited
much better form than in the first
set, but he was unable to keep his
more experienced opponent from
annexing the set by a score of 6-3,
making the score for the match
6-0, 6-3. Although the loss of the
two singles points gave California
the victory for the entire match,
the doubles match was closely con
tested. Hodge and Cassell played
a hard, up-hill game from the start,
but were unable to cope with the
experience and fine team work of
Wayne and Variel, the latter's
smashing of deep lobs being par
ticularly effective. The scores of
the two sets were 7-5 and 6-4.
