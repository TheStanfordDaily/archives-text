# JUNIOR DAY TO-MORROW.
## Baseball Game Between the Faculty and 1906 Nines to Be Played in the Afternoon. 
### 
Junior day, which was postponed
from March 31st, will be celebrated
by the li) 06 class to-night and to
morrow afternoon. This evening
the class presented their opera,
"Princess Enone," in Assembly
Hall. Owing to the fact that Dr.
Jordan decided to suspend classes
only in the afternoon instead of
allowing the usual whole holiday,
the Junior day committee was
compelled to curtail its plans for
to-morrow morning, which includ
ed a regatta between crews from
the Boat Club, and the exercises
will be confined to a baseball game
in the afternoon. The annual
Gymnasium Club exhibition comes
in the evening as an independent
event.
The baseball game will be a
match between the Faculty nine
and the Juniors. The contest is
called for 2:30 and will be played
on the Varsity diamond. No ad
mission will be charged. The ? 06
men will be represented by prac
tically the same nine that played
in the interclass games. Captain
Colbert desires that all Juniors
who wish to play shall turn out,
whether or not their names appear
