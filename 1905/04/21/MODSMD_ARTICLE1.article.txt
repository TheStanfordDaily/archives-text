# "PRINCESS ENONE" A SUCCESS.
## Music, Setting and Costuming of the Piece a Triumph for Author and Designer. 
### 
"The Princess Enone" was pre
sented in the Assembly Hall last
night to a large house, which ac
corded the opera a cordial recep
tion. This production was unique
in being the moßt ambitious effort
yet made by Stanford playwrights;
though comic operas have been
presented here, none of those given
heretofore have been written by
Stanford people. For this reason,
the audience was ready to be en
thusiastic over the many good fea
tures of the performance, and good
naturedly tolerant of some rather
conspicuous defects.
For the music, costumes, and
scenery, the greatest credit is due.
The composer, Homer F. Curran,
'05, preserved in the music through
out the atmosphere of the overture,
an atmosphere which most success
fully heightened the first impres
sion of the "mystic vale in Yuca
tan." Three numbers, the "Aztec
Serenade," "The Spinning Song,"
and the finale to Act 11, "We're off
for U. S. A.," would compare very
favorably with any of the modern
comic-opera music on the profes
sional stage. Of these, the first
named made what was undoubted
ly the hit of the evening. All of
the choruses had a good swing,
while the less pretentious numbers
were catchy and in every instance
suitable for their place.
It is to be regretted that no en
cores were given to several num
bers which the audience would
have been glad to hear a second
time. This is notably true of the
first two flower songs, where the
audience was given no chance to
show its appreciation. This un
fortunate haste on the part of the
director might have been better ap
plied to other parts of the opera
where, had the music been kept
going, the effect would have been
less that of a series of separate
events.
It is generally conceded that the
unique costumes of the chorus of
Aztec maidens —though far more
Japanese than Aztec —were most
effective. The color scheme was
distinctly good, and all the details
of scenery and staging reflect great
credit upon I). M. Reynolds, '05,
who planned and executed this
part of the performance, besides
writing the libretto. The lyrics,
which were the work of Karl A.
Bickel, '07, added greatly to the
success of the spinning and flower
songs, and formed not the least
original part of the production.
Like most other comic operas,
and like most college plays, "The
Princess Enone" was greatly want
ing in plot. There was almost no
logical sequence in the opera, even
in the * first act, which hung to
gether far better than the second.
The characters rambled on and off
the stage at will, warbling a few
notes apropos of nothing in par
ticular, followed by the full chorus,
whose undoubted success was great
ly overworked. In the second act
there were probably not three peo
ple in the house who succeeded in
keeping what is known in a less

frivolous connection as the "thread
of the discurse." As an excupe for
some very effective songs the book
had more value than as a produc
tion intrinsically worth while.
Miss Jeraldine Brown, '04, did
good work as the Princess Enone,
who, though the heroine, had a far
less effective part than Kaloa,
which was beautifully sung by
Miss Eugenia Miller, '06. Miss
Miller's voice, which is both strong
and sweet, was responsible in large
part for the most successful num
bers of the evening. The Wild
Rose, Miss Georgina Lyman, '07,
and the Pansy, Miss Edna Brown,
'08, helped greatly to make the
flower scene one of the best musi
cal numbers, as well as one of the
prettiest stage pictures in the
whole opera. Miss de Luna's
dancing was warmly received, and
made an attractive intermezzo.
Of the men in the cast, 11. S.
Kellogg, '07, and J. C. Ray, '07,
had the most conspicuous parts,
and did more than usually well
with the chance they had. Pro
fessor Boggs was as droll as he
could well have been made, while
Prince Charming showed good
taste, on the whole, in his interpre
tation of a character who is sup
posed to be both drunk and funny
throughout practically the whole
opera. The good taste in putting
such a character into the opera in
the first place may perhaps be
questioned, as may be the age of
the jokes inspired by the Prince's
omnipresent bottle.
C. L. Firebaugh, as Montezuma,
did very well, his initial song, "The
Viceroy," being the first number
which moved off vigorously from
the first note. B. Cosgrove, who
sang the part of Taga in place of R.
H. Lachmund, who was forced to
withdraw at a late hour because of
illness, did remarkably well, es
pecially in the serenade number,
while E. J. Swift, '06, was accept
able in a somewhat uninteresting
part. V. E. Stork, '05, as Zaza,
had to play a conventional comic
part corresponding to that of Lady
Jane in "Patience," the '04 Senior
opera. The chorus of soldiers was
well trained, and received consid
erable applause.
Taken as a whole, the merits of
"The Princess Enone'' were the
same, and its defects the same, as
those of any modern comic opera
to be seen on the professional
boards. The performance was un
doubtedly a success —people felt re
paid for going to it; and it shows a
move in the right direction that
such a production should be under
taken and executed so well by
Stanford students.

who, though the heroine, had a far
less effective part than Kaloa,
which was beautifully sung by
Miss Eugenia Miller, '06. Miss
Miller's voice, which is both strong
and sweet, was responsible in large
part for the most successful num
bers of the evening. The Wild
Rose, Miss Georgina Lyman, '07,
and the Pansy, Miss Edna Brown,
'08, helped greatly to make the
flower scene one of the best musi
cal numbers, as well as one of the
prettiest stage pictures in the
whole opera. Miss de Luna's
dancing was warmly received, and
made an attractive intermezzo.
Of the men in the cast, 11. S.
Kellogg, '07, and J. C. Ray, '07,
had the most conspicuous parts,
and did more than usually well
with the chance they had. Pro
fessor Boggs was as droll as he
could well have been made, while
Prince Charming showed good
taste, on the whole, in his interpre
tation of a character who is sup
posed to be both drunk and funny
throughout practically the whole
opera. The good taste in putting
such a character into the opera in
the first place may perhaps be
questioned, as may be the age of
the jokes inspired by the Prince's
omnipresent bottle.
C. L. Firebaugh, as Montezuma,
did very well, his initial song, "The
Viceroy," being the first number
which moved off vigorously from
the first note. B. Cosgrove, who
sang the part of Taga in place of R.
H. Lachmund, who was forced to
withdraw at a late hour because of
illness, did remarkably well, es
pecially in the serenade number,
while E. J. Swift, '06, was accept
able in a somewhat uninteresting
part. V. E. Stork, '05, as Zaza,
had to play a conventional comic
part corresponding to that of Lady
Jane in "Patience," the '04 Senior
opera. The chorus of soldiers was
well trained, and received consid
erable applause.
Taken as a whole, the merits of
"The Princess Enone'' were the
same, and its defects the same, as
those of any modern comic opera
to be seen on the professional
boards. The performance was un
doubtedly a success —people felt re
paid for going to it; and it shows a
move in the right direction that
such a production should be under
taken and executed so well by
Stanford students.
"The Princess Enone" was pre
sented in the Assembly Hall last
night to a large house, which ac
corded the opera a cordial recep
tion. This production was unique
in being the moßt ambitious effort
yet made by Stanford playwrights;
though comic operas have been
presented here, none of those given
heretofore have been written by
Stanford people. For this reason,
the audience was ready to be en
thusiastic over the many good fea
tures of the performance, and good
naturedly tolerant of some rather
conspicuous defects.
For the music, costumes, and
scenery, the greatest credit is due.
The composer, Homer F. Curran,
'05, preserved in the music through
out the atmosphere of the overture,
an atmosphere which most success
fully heightened the first impres
sion of the "mystic vale in Yuca
tan." Three numbers, the "Aztec
Serenade," "The Spinning Song,"
and the finale to Act 11, "We're off
for U. S. A.," would compare very
favorably with any of the modern
comic-opera music on the profes
sional stage. Of these, the first
named made what was undoubted
ly the hit of the evening. All of
the choruses had a good swing,
while the less pretentious numbers
were catchy and in every instance
suitable for their place.
It is to be regretted that no en
cores were given to several num
bers which the audience would
have been glad to hear a second
time. This is notably true of the
first two flower songs, where the
audience was given no chance to
show its appreciation. This un
fortunate haste on the part of the
director might have been better ap
plied to other parts of the opera
where, had the music been kept
going, the effect would have been
less that of a series of separate
events.
It is generally conceded that the
unique costumes of the chorus of
Aztec maidens —though far more
Japanese than Aztec —were most
effective. The color scheme was
distinctly good, and all the details
of scenery and staging reflect great
credit upon I). M. Reynolds, '05,
who planned and executed this
part of the performance, besides
writing the libretto. The lyrics,
which were the work of Karl A.
Bickel, '07, added greatly to the
success of the spinning and flower
songs, and formed not the least
original part of the production.
Like most other comic operas,
and like most college plays, "The
Princess Enone" was greatly want
ing in plot. There was almost no
logical sequence in the opera, even
in the * first act, which hung to
gether far better than the second.
The characters rambled on and off
the stage at will, warbling a few
notes apropos of nothing in par
ticular, followed by the full chorus,
whose undoubted success was great
ly overworked. In the second act
there were probably not three peo
ple in the house who succeeded in
keeping what is known in a less

frivolous connection as the "thread
of the discurse." As an excupe for
some very effective songs the book
had more value than as a produc
tion intrinsically worth while.
