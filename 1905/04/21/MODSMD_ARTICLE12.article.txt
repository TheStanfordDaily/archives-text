The results of the student body
meeting yesterday afternoon can,
on the whole, be viewed with satis
faction. It was the opinion of
many persons that the Executive
Committee might be made more
representative under the system of
government that was proposed; it
was the opinion of the mnjority, as
expressed yesterday, that the pres
ent system has given such satisfac
tion as to warrant its continuance.
Big problems are to be handled by
the Executive Committee in the
next year or two, but that body
has seldom been found wanting in
the past, and we may therefore rest
confident that in future it will be
as successful.
Probably the most important
thing done by the student body
meeting was the raising of the stu
dent body dues from one dollar
a year to one dollar each semester.
The increased cost of the coaching
and training and general care of
the various athletic teams, and the
new expenses in connection with
the athletic field upon which we
are just beginning, has made a
larger revenue essential. The in
crease of student body dues was
fully justified: in other institutions
of smaller size they are twice as
great. The payment of these stu
dent body dues has not been made
compulsory, for the student body
does not want the money of any
one who honestly cannot afford to
pay; but year by year more per
sons are coming to recognize their
responsibility and to meet the
voluntary assessment.
