The election to the track cap
taincy of a man who did not take
a point in the recent intercollegiate
field-day is a remarkable tribute.
It is a tribute not only to his known
athletic ability, but as much to his
standing as a man. There could
be no better indication of the con
fidence reposed in him by the men

whom he must lead, and it augurs
well for success in the hard struggle
for victory which we must make a
year hence. When M. J. Weller
takes up his work the students at
large will not be found any less en
thusiastic in their support than is
his team.
