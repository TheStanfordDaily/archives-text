# NEW REGISTER ISSUED.
## Catalogue of Students for 1904-5 Will Be Ready for Distribution Saturday. 
### 
The Register for 1904-5 has just
been issued from the press, and will
be ready for distribution at the
Registrar's office to-morrow. Var
ious changes in announcements of
the different departments are made,
but in general the courses of in
struction remain the same as they
now stand.
The new course in Philosophy to
be given by Professor James of
Harvard is announced on page 93
of the Register. It is a three-hour
course, to be given in the second
semester, under the head of "A
General Introduction to Phil
osophy." With the exception of
the rearrangement of the courses in
hygiene, this is practically the only
notable change in courses.
Rearrangement of Hygiene Work.
The work in the Hygiene depart
ment will be considerably changed
next semester. The plans for the
new system were formulated by Dr.
Storey, assistant professor of
hygiene, before his departure for
the East last year. The new
arrangement will enable a student
to take gymnasium work progress
ively for four years without being
compelled to be in classes of new
men and going through work with
which he is already familiar.
Course 1 in Hygiene will be given
as a three-hour course for new men,
and will consist of drill on Tues
days and Thursdays, and one lec
ture each week. The students who
have passed this course will work
on Monday, Wednesday and Fri
day. The Itoble and Encina gym
nasium courses are listed separately
to avoid confusion.
Two new lecture courses will be
given by Dr. Snow, the head of the
department. In the first semester
he will give a two-hour course on
the History of Medicine. This
course will not be open to first-year
students. In the second semester
it will be replaced by a course on
Sanitary Legislation. These are
general information courses, given
in response to petitions from other
departments of the university for
courses of a general nature. The
course in Public Health, which is
given in alternate years and was
given in 1904-05, will be replaced
next year by a course in a different
phase of the subject, entitled Pro
phylactic Measures. It is a labora
tory course on immunity for ad
vanced students in Physiology.
Entrance Credit Regulations.
Under the head of "Entrance
Credits on Recommendation from
Approved Schools," the number of
approved schools, beginning after
August, 1905, has been considerably
reduced. After that date, only
schools accredited by the New Eng
land College Entrance Certificate
Board, the North Central Associa
tion of Colleges and Secondary
Schools, or by colleges and univer
sities of high rank,wiil be privileged
to recommend for exemption from
entrance examinations. The con
ditions of admission from such
schools on recommendation have
been greatly simplified, and most
of the supplementary tests hereto
fore required will be done away
with.
More Time for Incompletes.
The time for making up "in
completes" has been extended from
one semester to one year, under

certain restrictions as to the
amount of work.

Two new lecture courses will be
given by Dr. Snow, the head of the
department. In the first semester
he will give a two-hour course on
the History of Medicine. This
course will not be open to first-year
students. In the second semester
it will be replaced by a course on
Sanitary Legislation. These are
general information courses, given
in response to petitions from other
departments of the university for
courses of a general nature. The
course in Public Health, which is
given in alternate years and was
given in 1904-05, will be replaced
next year by a course in a different
phase of the subject, entitled Pro
phylactic Measures. It is a labora
tory course on immunity for ad
vanced students in Physiology.
Entrance Credit Regulations.

Credits on Recommendation from
Approved Schools," the number of

one semester to one year, under

certain restrictions as to the
amount of work.

The Register for 1904-5 has just
been issued from the press, and will
be ready for distribution at the
Registrar's office to-morrow. Var
ious changes in announcements of
the different departments are made,
but in general the courses of in
struction remain the same as they
now stand.
The new course in Philosophy to
be given by Professor James of
Harvard is announced on page 93
of the Register. It is a three-hour
course, to be given in the second
semester, under the head of "A
General Introduction to Phil
osophy." With the exception of
the rearrangement of the courses in
hygiene, this is practically the only
notable change in courses.
Rearrangement of Hygiene Work.
The work in the Hygiene depart
ment will be considerably changed
next semester. The plans for the
new system were formulated by Dr.
Storey, assistant professor of
hygiene, before his departure for
the East last year. The new
arrangement will enable a student
to take gymnasium work progress
ively for four years without being
compelled to be in classes of new
men and going through work with
which he is already familiar.
Course 1 in Hygiene will be given
as a three-hour course for new men,
and will consist of drill on Tues
days and Thursdays, and one lec
ture each week. The students who
have passed this course will work
on Monday, Wednesday and Fri
day. The Itoble and Encina gym
nasium courses are listed separately
to avoid confusion.
Two new lecture courses will be
given by Dr. Snow, the head of the
department. In the first semester
he will give a two-hour course on
the History of Medicine. This
course will not be open to first-year
