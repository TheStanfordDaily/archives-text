The Waseda University baseball
team arrived in San Francisco yes
terday on the steamer Korea. They
were met in the city by Manager
Barrett and T. Nakamura, presi
dent of the University Japanese
Club, and were taken at once to the
St. Francis Hotel, where they re
mained last night. Yesterday after
noon the team went to Recreation
Park and watched a baseball game
between two of the Coast Leapue
teams. They had intended coming
down to Stanford at once, but on
account of the bad weather they
remained in the city. They reached
the campus late this afternoon.
While on the campus the Waseda
team will be entertained by the
Japanese Club, which has rented
and furnished a house on College
Terrace, where the visitors will be
lodged. They will practice forenoons
on the Varsity diamond in prepara
tion for the first game, which will
be played on the campus Saturday,
April 29th.
Fourteen men,including the man
ager of the team, made the trip.
On the way across the Pacific they
practiced daily on the deck of the
Korea, and at Honolulu they had
an opportunity to practice on the
ball grounds while the steamer re
mained in port. The members of
the team are described as compact
and active athletes, all above the
height of the average Japanese.
