# Intercollegiate Basket-ball.
## 
### 
To-morrow morning at 11 o'clock
the Stanford basket-ball team will
meet the women of the Univer
sity of California in the annual
intercollegiate game. This prom
ises to be the most interesting and
closest game which the team has
played this season, and unless the
handicap occasioned by the lack of
practice matches proves too great,
the Stanford team has more than
an even chance of winning the
championship. The most care has
been exercised in the choice of the
players, and the line-up will be as
follows:
Forwards â€”J. Spalding, '06, E.
Hayward, '06, E. Montieth, '07;
centers, H. Dorrance, '05, F. Grace,
'06, L. Falk, '06; guards, H. Huis
kamp, '06, M. Betz, '06 (capt.), S.
Hyatt, '06.
