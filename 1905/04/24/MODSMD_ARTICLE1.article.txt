Rah! Rah! Waseda!
Waseda! Waseda!
Banzai!

The much-heralded baseball team
of Waseda University is at last on
the campus. The men arrived
here late Friday evening, and, tired
out by their long trip, went direct
ly to the lodgings provided for
them at Evergreen Park by the
Japanese Students' Club. Satur
day morning the team appeared
on the Varsity diamond, attired in
regulation baseball suits of white,
with "Waseda" worked across the
front of their shirts in maroon let
ters. For an hour or so they prac
ticed fielding and batting before a
crowd of onlookers who were very
favorably impressed with the work
of the men. The infield was es
pecially fast and handled ground
hits in fine style. Saturday night
the visitors were entertained by
the Japanese Club at an informal
gathering, and Sunday was spent
in resting and seeing the sights of
the university. This afternoon the
team practiced on the Varsity dia
mond from twelve until three, and
they will continue this practice
daily until the first game, next
Saturday.
The history of the events which
brought Waseda here to play Stan
ford is an interesting one. In 1894
Iso Abe, manager of the team, a
graduate of Trinity College, Con
necticut, landed in England from
America on his way to Oxford,
where he intended to become a stu
dent. On the very day of his ar
rival, Yale met Oxford in an inter
collegiate track meet. Abe was
very much impressed, and realiz
ing the value of international col
legiate contests, he then and there
determined that he would some
day bring a Japanese team to
America. After his graduation, he
was offered the chair of sociology
and ethics in Waseda University
of Tokio. There he laid his long
cherished plan before Count
Okuma, ex-Prime Minister of
Japan and founder of the univer
sity, who heartily approved of the
idea, but told him that, before such
a trip could be made, Waseda
must have a team which should
win the championship of Japan.
At that time there was no baseball
team at Waseda. although the
game had been played in Japan
for almost twenty years. Alone
and unaided, Abe set to work to
build up a team from what little
material he could gather together.
By last fall he had produced a nine
which wrested the championship
of Japan from Keo College in two
hard games and was judged worthy
to make the long trip to America.
Twelve players, accompanied by
Abe, make the trip. They are as
follows: Pitcher, A. Kono; catcher,
M. Yamaki; first base, S. Izumi
tani; second base, K. Oshikawa;
third base, S. Suyama; short-stop,
K. Hashido (captain); center field,
M. Obara; left field, T. Suzuki;
right field, lv. Shishiuchi; substi-
tutes, T. Hosokawa, S. Marimoto
and S. Tachihara. The team
which meets the Varsity Saturday
will probably be that first given,
with the possibility that Suzuki's
place in the left field will be filled
by one of the substitutes, and Ya
maki and Izumitani may be shifted
about.
Hashido, captain and short-stop,
is regarded as the best player on the
team. He has been playing base
ball for ten years, and his great
experience has made him almost
invaluable as coach and captain.
He was at one time a pitcher, but
his arm gave out and he was forced
to play in one of the infield po
sitions. A. Kono, the pitcher, is
regarded as the best twirler in
Japan. His curves are good and
are said to possess an unusual
amount of speed. Lately Kono
has been coached by Merrifield, a
former University of Chicago
pitcher, now residing in Tokio, and
under his tuition has made won
derful progress. Kono's best per
formance was made last fall, against
the strong team of Gakushuin Col
lege, which was defeated by Wa
seda, 3 to 2. in a twelve-inning
pitchers' battle. In build Kono is
very slight, but he is well propor
tioned and has a powerful throw
ing arm.
Shishiuchi, the right fielder, is
the premier batsman on the team,
having topped the batting averages
for the past two seasons.
Baseball is the only intercollegi
ate sport recognized at Waseda and
is the only thing for which an ath
lete is granted his varsity "W."
Last fall Waseda won the cham
pionship of Japan, winning seven
games and losing none; defeating,
among others, an American team
from the Hamacho Club of Yoka
hama, Should the team make a
good showing in its series with
Stanford, it will proceed at once to
Chicago and play the university of
that city; but it is not planning an
extensive tour through the East, as
it expects to return to Japan by the
middle of June.
The Japanese Club intends to
have a large rooting section at Sat
urday's game, and they are plan
ning to give the Waseda yell, quot
ed above.
