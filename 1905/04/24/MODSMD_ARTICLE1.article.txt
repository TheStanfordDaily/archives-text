Rah! Rah! Waseda!

Waseda! Waseda!
Banzai!

The much-heralded baseball team
of Waseda University is at last on
the campus. The men arrived
here late Friday evening, and, tired
out by their long trip, went direct
ly to the lodgings provided for
them at Evergreen Park by the
Japanese Students' Club. Satur
day morning the team appeared
on the Varsity diamond, attired in
regulation baseball suits of white,
with "Waseda" worked across the
front of their shirts in maroon let
ters. For an hour or so they prac
ticed fielding and batting before a
crowd of onlookers who were very
favorably impressed with the work
of the men. The infield was es
pecially fast and handled ground
hits in fine style. Saturday night
the visitors were entertained by
the Japanese Club at an informal
gathering, and Sunday was spent
in resting and seeing the sights of
the university. This afternoon the
team practiced on the Varsity dia
mond from twelve until three, and
they will continue this practice
daily until the first game, next
Saturday.
The history of the events which
brought Waseda here to play Stan
ford is an interesting one. In 1894
Iso Abe, manager of the team, a
graduate of Trinity College, Con
necticut, landed in England from
America on his way to Oxford,
where he intended to become a stu
dent. On the very day of his ar
rival, Yale met Oxford in an inter
collegiate track meet. Abe was
very much impressed, and realiz
ing the value of international col
legiate contests, he then and there
determined that he would some
day bring a Japanese team to
America. After his graduation, he
was offered the chair of sociology
and ethics in Waseda University
of Tokio. There he laid his long
cherished plan before Count
Okuma, ex-Prime Minister of
Japan and founder of the univer
sity, who heartily approved of the
idea, but told him that, before such
a trip could be made, Waseda
must have a team which should
win the championship of Japan.
At that time there was no baseball
team at Waseda. although the
game had been played in Japan
for almost twenty years. Alone
and unaided, Abe set to work to
build up a team from what little
material he could gather together.
By last fall he had produced a nine
which wrested the championship
of Japan from Keo College in two
hard games and was judged worthy
to make the long trip to America.
Twelve players, accompanied by
Abe, make the trip. They are as
follows: Pitcher, A. Kono; catcher,
M. Yamaki; first base, S. Izumi
tani; second base, K. Oshikawa;
third base, S. Suyama; short-stop,
K. Hashido (captain); center field,
M. Obara; left field, T. Suzuki;
right field, lv. Shishiuchi; substi-
