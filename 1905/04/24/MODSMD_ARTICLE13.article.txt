Thursday evening and Satur
day rooming of this week the Stan
ford English Club will give two
performances of Jonson's "Every
Man in his Humour." Those who
remember the performance of Beau
mont and Fletcher's "Knight of
the Burning Pestle'' need no fur
ther assurance as to the merits of
such a production. And if hard
work, elaborate preparation and a
sincere desire to present something
that is historically correct as well
as artistically perfect can accom
plish aftything, this week's per
formances should equal those that
were given two years ago. The
thorough way in which the Eng
lish Club has carried its plays
through has set a high standard
for Stanford dramatics. The pre
sentation of "Every Man in his
Humour" will be especially note
worthy as the first production in
America of a once famous play by
one of the master spirits of Eng
lish drama. Such a production by
Stanford students cannot fail to be
a credit to the university wherever
it is heard of.
