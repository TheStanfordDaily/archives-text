# "Every Man in his Humour" to Be Given at Stanford on Thursday and Saturday
## FUN IN GREAT VARIETY. Jonson's Comedy Will Keep People Laughing and Send Them Home in Good Humor. 
### 
IN reviving Ben Jonson's "Every
Man in his Humour'' the English
Club has had in mind not only the
artistic, literary, and historical
interest of the play, but also its fit
ness to amuse a modern audience.
As in the case of "The Knight of
the Burning Pestle," which achieved
such a popular success two years
ago, the comedy is full of fun which
will be readily appreciated by all.
In Jonson's play the fun will come
chiefly from the characters.
Several of the characters are
meant to be laughed at —in fact, the
fun-loving Wellbred and young
Knowell wind them up and show
them off. This is especially true
of Stephen, the country gull, who
goes through a variety of contor
tions, even confessing himself a
fool, in order to ape the absurd
ways of the city gallants; and of
Mathew, the city gull, who makes
himself ridiculous by reading his
stolen sentimental verses. There
is comedy of a higher order in the

part of Bobadil, who has a plan by
which he and nineteen others, each
killing twenty a day, can extermi
nate an army in two hundred days.
Although he swears "'by my valour"
and boasts of his ability to turn a
bullet with his rapier, he is afraid
to etrike back at Downright, and at
the end is humiliatingly shoved
aside as a "sign of the soldier."
Kitely, Knowell and Downright
are more dignified characters, but
they leave a strong appeal to mod
ern audiences because they stand
for phases of human nature in gen
eral rather than as types of condi
tions limited to any one age. Cob,
in his soliloquies and in his pro
test against tobacco, furnishes hu
mour of a burlesque order. He is
sure to keep the audience laughing
the entire time he is on the stage.
A different kind of fun still will
come from Brainworm, the servant
who wears various disguises, and
who takes keen delight in serving
two or more masters at once, and
even in serving one master in two
different forms. Every one in the
house will agree with Justice Cle
ment that when lirainworm's ad
ventures shall be made a fable "it
shall find both spectators and ap
plause."
