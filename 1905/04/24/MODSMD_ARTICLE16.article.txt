# Elizabethan to Mark the First American Production.

### 
"piOR the first time in America Ben Jonson's " Every Man in his Humour"
will be acted Thursday evening and Saturday morning of this week
by the Stanford University English Club. The club's Elizabethan stage has
been placed in Assembly Hall, portions of the Elizabethan audience will be
represented, the music will be of that period, the costumes have been
especially designed from old prints, and in every way the performance will
be representative of the Globe Theater as it was in 1598 when this, the first
play of the young dramatist, was presented, with Shakspere as Knowell and
with a cast including the tragedian Burbadge and Will Kempe, the clown.
The play is a realistic and intensely amusing picture of London life at
the time of Elizabeth. The interest lies not so much in the novelty or com
plexity of plot as in the characters, of which a dozen have almost equally
prominent parts. As explained in the booklet, "Elizabethan Humours,"
each of these characters has his " humour," and much of the fun is in the
good-natured satire on the extravagant manners of the time. There is plenty
of snappy dialogue and laughable action. The cast has been selected with
care that each character may be interpreted with sympathy, with force, and
with attention to artistic effect. The rehearsals have brought out, even more
than anticipated, the possibilities of this 44 magnificent and perfect comedy."
