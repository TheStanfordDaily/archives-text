# PLAY CAREFULLY PREPARED.
## English Club Endeavoring to Make It Rival "The Knight of the Burning Pestle." 
### 
THE revival of Hen Jonson's
''Every Man in his Humour,"
by the English Club, is due largely
to the success of "The Knight of the
Burning Pestle," Beaumont and
Fletcher's comedy, acted by the
club in 1903. The "Knight" was
so favorably received, both by those
interested in it as representative of
an Elizabethan drama acted on an
Elizabethan stage, and by those
who went simply to be amused,
that the club felt encouraged to
undertake another play. Jonson's
realistic comedy was selected be
cause it is different from the more ro
mantic "Knight,"and from the com
edies of Shakspere acted by the Ben
Greet players, and because, while
historically interesting, it is a com
edy that has merit of its own, and
is full of fun that appeals to a
modern audience.
As before, the preparations for
the play have been elaborate. The
cast was selected last semester, the
aim being to find the man, or

woman, best fitted for the interpre
tation of the individual part. Most
of those chosen were known for their
record in university dramatics;
others had had experience before
coming here, while a few had to be
developed. The rehearsals have
been long and exacting, and much
of the success of the performance
will be due to the earnestness and
faithfulness of the cast. The selec
tion of the cast, the rehearsals and
the general direction of the play
have been in the hands of L. E.
Bassett, who performed a like ser
vice for ''The Knight of the Burn
ing Pestle."
The costumes have been especially
designed from old prints and from
hints in the play and in old docu
ments. Knowell, for instance, will
be dressed as Shakspere was in the
portrait which according to tradi
tion represents him in that charac
ter. Miss 0. Z. Edwards is chair
man of the sub-committee in charge
of the costumes. The ''properties"
have been made as accurate as pos
sible, an example being the huge
tankard used by Cob for carrying
water from house to house. V. E.
Stork has had charge of the proper
ties. The Elizabethan stage was
designed two years ago by II. R.
Johnson, ex-'04, and built by G.
Laumeister. The general stage

The business connected with the
play has been managed by W. 11.
Thomson, '05, while J. F. Cassell,
'07, has been press agent. The
poster was designed by Miss K. E.
Traphagen, The book of the
play, "Elizabethan Humours,"
was edited by Professor R. M. Alden.
