# STRONG CAST SELECTED.
## Men and Women Who Will Take Roles Well Known in Stanford Dramatics. 
### 
THE final cast selected by L. E.
Baesett to take the many
difficult roles in "Every Man in his
Humour" is one of the strongest
ensembles of dramatic talent ever
gotten together at the university.
Only three of the actors who
took part in the English Club's
production of Eeaumont and
Fletcher's "Knight of the Burning
Pestle" two years ago will be seen
in the present play, but these three
were the ones who scored the great
est success in"The Knight of the
Burning Pestle" and can be relied
on to do excellent work again. It
would be difficult to find an actor
who could handle the part of Boba
dil more successfully than J. K.
Bonnell, '02, who took the part of
the grocer's wife in"The Knight of
the Burning Pestle." E. O. James,
'02, who divided honors with Bon
nell as Master Merrythought in
"The Knight of the Burning
Pestle," will also appear in the
present play as Justice Clement.
Bonnell is at present Instructor in
the English department, and James
has come from Pacific Grove, where
he is principal of the high school,
to help the success of the perform
ance.
One of the most unique and ar
tistic pieces of work in the whole
play is the part of Cob, the London
water-carrier, which has been well
worked out by P. C. Edwards, '06.
Edwards took a somewhat minor
part in"The Knight of the Burn
ing Pestle," and is also well known
for his work in class farces and
plays.
E.V. Henley,'o6, who did the part
of the dwarf two years ago, was to
have taken the part of Cash in
the present performances, but
sickness has necessitated his with
drawal from the cast. Cash will
be acted by C. L. Severy, '08, who
has had considerable training in
the Pasadena High School.
R. G. Barnett, '05, will fill the
important part of Kitely. Bar
nett's appearance on the Stanford
stage has been limited to the '06
production of "David Garrick" last
year and a part in the Junior
farce. In "David Garrick," how
ever, he did excellent work, and he
promises to do equally well with
the part of Kitely.
A. L. Trowbridge, '05, who will
be the younger Ktiowell, has also
appeared on the stage but once at
Stanford, having taken the title
role in"The Man from Mizzoury"
last March.
Another actor whose work in the
preliminary rehearsals has been
full of promise is R. H. Baker, '08.
Baker comes this year from the
San Diego High School with a rep
utation acquired from having taken
successfully important roles in high
school performances. He will have
the most essentially comic charac
ter of the play, that of Brainworm.
The character of Wellbred will
be taken by J. M. Ward, '07, who
also comes from the San Diego High
School, having also participated
in the Shaksperean performances
given there.
Knowell, the father of Edward
Ktiowell, whose "humour" of over
anxiety for his son's welfare led
him into difficulties, will be acted
by J. E. Stewart, '07. Stewart has
had his dramatic training in the
East. Alvin Peterson, '07, will do

the part of Downright. Peterson has
taken part in Ben Greet's Shaks
perean plays on the Stanford stage,
and in the recent Sophomore pro
duction of "The Rivals" he gave a
very successful interpretation of a
character possessingsimilar temper
amental qualities to those of Down
right.
The part of Master Stephen, the
country gull, and Master Matliew,
the city gull, will be taken by C.
G. Lewis, '08, and L. W. Cutler, '06,
respectively. This is Lewis's first
appearance on the Stanford stage.
Cutler has given the part of Ma
thew an original and clever treat
ment that will make the part one
of the most entertaining in the
play.
The unusually small number of
female characters in the cast will
make it possible for the three parts
to be done with exceptional ability.
The part of Dame Kitely will be
taken by Miss Claire C. Pedlar,'o7,
whose appearance in the role of
Lydia Languish in the recent pro
duction of "The Rivals" was so suc

cessful. Miss Pedlar was also in the
chorus of "Patience" last May. Miss
Jeraldine Brown,'os, who will take
the part of Mistress Bridget, took
the title role of Patience, and was
also seen in the play given by the
faculty in Palo Alto last semester.
Miss E. L. Buckingham, '08, who
will take the part of Tib, Cob's
wife, has had considerable experi
ence in amateur dramatics.
Roger Formal, Justice Clement's
clerk, will be taken by J. E.Camp
bell, '06. The three servants' parts
will be taken by R. S. Lacey,'o7, H.
S. Ross, '08, and H. F. Clark, '08.
Miss Isabel Warner will be the
Windmill barmaid. The stage
boys will be F. W. Powell, '04, and
F. W. Turner, '08.
