# "ELIZABETHAN HUMOURS."
## Interesting Volume Prepared by the English Club to Commemorate the Play. 
### 
THE book of the play, as pre
pared by the committee and
published by Paul Elder and Com
pany, is intended both as a help to
ward the right understanding of the
play by those intending to see it,
and a souvenir and record of the
performance which shall commemo
rate it as worthily as was done in
the case of "The Knight of the
Burning Pestle" two years ago.
The article on "Elizabethan Hu
mours," by Professor Alden, ex
plains the title of the comedy, and
goes on to show how the various
characters of the play are repre
sentative of familiar types of Eliza
bethan life, all the leading ones
being taken up in some detail. The
other leading article, by Professor
Anderson, deals with Ben Jonson
as a dramatist, especially in con
trast with Shakspere; as an essay
it is worthy of a permanent place
in one's library. There is also a
brief introduction to the volume,
outlining the history of old English
plays at Stanford, and explaining
the details of the Elizabethan stage
which is used at these perform
ances.
The second half of the book is
occupied with a variety of material
brought together with the idea of
throwing further light on the play.
It includes Jonson'e Prologue, as it
will be recited at the opening of the
performance; an epilogue which
was written for its revival in the
reign of Charles the Second, and
two seventeenth-century poems ad
dressed to Jonson in praise of his
genius.
Not the least interesting part of
the book is taken by the illustra
tions. There are pictures of the
Globe Theater as it appeared in
Jonson's time, and of Ben Jonson
himself. A further series of four
portraits illustrates some of the
great actors who have taken part
in the play in the past. One is of
Shakspere, who appeared in the
first performance of it (a copy of
the recently discovered painting
which has been thought to repre
sent Shakspere in actor's costume).
There are many other illustrations
which add to the value of the book.
The volume will be sold at fifty
cents, the actual cost price.
