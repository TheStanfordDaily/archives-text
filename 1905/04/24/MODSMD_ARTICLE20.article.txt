# Jonson's Play a Picture of Old Elizabethan Life
## PLOT EASY TO FOLLOW. Brainworm the Leading Spirit in Bringing About the Complications of the Comedy. 
### 
THE plot of "Every Man in his
Humour" is not a difficult one
to follow, and it may be told briefly
thus:
Edward Knowell, a handsome,
sane young man, sets out one morn
ing to meet a friend named Well
bred who lives in the Jewry, at the
latter's invitation. His father,
whose "humour'' is to be over-zeal
ous for his son's welfare, follows
him, suspecting him of tricks com
mon to young fellows of his age.
Brainworm, the father's servant,
disguises himself as an old soldier,
first warns the young men of the
father's approach and then, winning
his way into his master's service in
his new captaincy, works during the
remainder of the play on the side
of the younger Knowell. For his
friend's entertainment the latter has
brought with him a cousin named
Master Stephen, a country gull who
constantly affects the usages of city
gentlemen in a ludicrous fashion,
being especially given to fits of me
lancholy and the use of borrowed
oaths. Wellbred, on his side, has
brought Captain Bobadil and
Master Mathew with him for Kno
well's amusement. Bobadil being
a boastful and bankrupted soldier,
whose stock of choice oaths fills
Master Stephen with envy, and
Master Mathew, his hanger-on, a
city gull, whose chief weakness is
for writing or stealing verses.
After being driven from the Wind
mill Tavern by Brain worm's timely
warning, the friends go to the house
of Wellbred's half-brother, where
he lives. Kitely, whose jealousy of
his wife is his "humour," who was
not at home at the time of their ar
rival, suddenly enters, and, having
his suspicions aroused, drives them
from the house. But in the mean
time young Knowell has fallen in
love with Bridget, Kitely's sister,
and forthwith the two young men
plot for a speedy elopement. This
is easily accomplished with the
assistance of Brainworm, in an
other disguise, Kitely and Dame
Kitely being gotten out of the way
and sent on false pretenses to the
house of Cob, a water-carrier.
Meanwhile the elder Knowell
has been directed thither by the
shifty Brainworm, who him
that his son has an appointment
there with a couriesan. The old
man finds Dame Kitely, who ar
rives first, in front of the house, and
is just beginning to accuse her when
Kitely appears. Tib, Cob's wife,
hearing the noise,next comes out,and
is accused by Dame Kitely of being
the woman whom her husband has
come to find. All parties finally
consent to bring their difficulties
before Justice Clement. Bridget
and young Knowell appear just as
the easy-going Justice is beginning
to clear up all the difficulties. Ed
ward Knowell then announces Ins
marriage to Bridget, secures the
blessing of his father, and accepts
the invitation of Justice Clement to
a dinner in honor of the occasion.
