# LONDON TRULY SKETCHED.
## Jonson's Realistic Play True to Actual Conditions of the Time, Even in Small Details. 
### 
THE accuracy with which Jonson
drew his realistic sketch of
contemporary London life is illus
trated by his care in placing the
scenes. The action of the play
opens at Knowell's house in Hogs
den, now Hoxton, a residence suburb
a short distance outside of the old
London wall. In Jonson's time the
suburbs were not in good repute,
hence Stephen's desire to imitate
city ways.
From Hogsden to "the City," as
the district inside the wall is still
called, the path leads across the
waste land, Moorfields, through
Moorgate in the wall. Moorfields,
which was used for archery, skat
ing, and drying clothes, had a bad
name because of cudgellings and
beatings given there.
In the lane just inside the wall
lives Cob, the water-carrier, in
whose house Bobadil lodges. The
conduit supplying this part of the
city with water ended in the wall
at the head of Coleman street, close
by Moorgate. Coleman street, in
the middle of which is Justice
Clement's house, leads to the Old
Jewry, so called because the Jews
lived there before their expulsion.

1598, says "this building hath to
