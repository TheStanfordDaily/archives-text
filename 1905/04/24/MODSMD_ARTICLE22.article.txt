# LONDON TRULY SKETCHED.
## Jonson's Realistic Play True to Actual Conditions of the Time, Even in Small Details. 
### 
THE accuracy with which Jonson
drew his realistic sketch of
contemporary London life is illus
trated by his care in placing the
scenes. The action of the play
opens at Knowell's house in Hogs
den, now Hoxton, a residence suburb
a short distance outside of the old
London wall. In Jonson's time the
suburbs were not in good repute,
hence Stephen's desire to imitate
city ways.
From Hogsden to "the City," as
the district inside the wall is still
called, the path leads across the
waste land, Moorfields, through
Moorgate in the wall. Moorfields,
which was used for archery, skat
ing, and drying clothes, had a bad
name because of cudgellings and
beatings given there.
In the lane just inside the wall
lives Cob, the water-carrier, in
whose house Bobadil lodges. The
conduit supplying this part of the
city with water ended in the wall
at the head of Coleman street, close
by Moorgate. Coleman street, in
the middle of which is Justice
Clement's house, leads to the Old
Jewry, so called because the Jews
lived there before their expulsion.

the Old Jewry begins, at the cross
ing of Lothbury, stands the Wind
mill, a fashionable tavern. John
Stow, in his "Survey of London,"
written in the year of the play,
1598, says "this building hath to

sign a windmill.' 1 lie sums up its
history l>y Baying''it was sometime
the Jews' synagogue, since a home
of friars, then a nobleman's house,
after that a merchant's house,
wherein mayoralties have been
kept, and now a wine tavern." In
the Old Jewry beyond the Wind
mill lives the wealthy merchant
Kitely, part of the building serving
as a warehouse. In modern Lon
don the district lies just north of
tbe Bank. Since the fire of 1666 it
is noisy, busy and ugly.
While tbe play does not strictly
observe the unity of place, accord
ing to tbe so-called classical rules,
it does that of time, the entire
action represented being about
twelve hours. It is before six that
Knowell at his suburban door
scents the morning air and that
Mathew makes bis early call upon
Bobadil. It is later that the bell
rings to breakfast in the house of
tbe rich merchant Kitely. The
events of tbe play lead up to Just
ice Clement's invitation to tbe wed
ding supper, which would be at six
o'clock in the evening.
