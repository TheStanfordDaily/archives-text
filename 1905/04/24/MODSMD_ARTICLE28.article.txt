# CALIFORNIA WINS AGAIN.
## Takes First Game of the Girls' Basket-ball Series.â€”Plays Here Saturday. 
### 
In the first game of the series
the University of California bas
ket-ball team last Saturday de
feated the Stanford team by the
score of 12-6. From the start it
was evident that the California
players were in better form, and
inside the first ten minutes of
play they had scored five of the
twelve points. Stanford was slow
in fielding and their good team
work was ineffective because of the
unusually long pass used by their
opponents. At the end of the first
half the score was 9-3, and in the
second half each side scored three
points. The game was clean bas
ket-ball, remarkably free from
fouls, and noteworthy for the team
work. Each side made two points
on fouls. California's power of
scoring was greatly lessened after
the first few minutes of play, when
Miss Huiskamp of the Stanford
team had become accustomed to
the splendid goal-throwing of Miss
Lily Wright. These two players
stand out as the most conspicuous
of all, the work of the latter en
abling California to score many
difficult points. California had a
veteran team, and her victory was
well earned. Stanford, on the other
hand,had but three regular guards,
and the other players were not up
to standard form. Following was
the line-up:
