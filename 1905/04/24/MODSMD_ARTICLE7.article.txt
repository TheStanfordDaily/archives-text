# CHAPLAIN GARDNER SPEAKS.
## Touching Address Marks His First Appearance in the Pulpit After Long Illness. 
### 
Before a large congregation, Dr.
Macintosh, president of the San
Anselmo Theological Seminary,
preached the Easier sermon in the
Memorial Church Sunday morning.
His subject was "Easter and Its
Meaning." The occasion was made
memorable by the presence of Rev.
D. C. Gardner, who conducted the
services for the first time since the
beginning of his long illness in
February. Shortly before the ser
mon Chaplain Gardner ascended
the pulpit and spoke earnestly and
feelingly of his recent sickness and
of the death of Mrs. Stanford. He
said in part:
''Although it is not my privilege
to preach to you this morning, I
feel that I must say a few personal
words in the presence of the people
whom I love and give thanks for
my deliverance, through the loving
devotion and skill of nurse and
physician, from the valley of the
shadow of death. Those of you
who know this pulpit, know of my
belief in God's providence and in
the purpose of every life. It is for
the fulfillment of that purpose that
I believe my life was spared, and
here before you all I consecrate
myself, —body, soul and spirit,—to
more earnest work in my ministry.
Again, I would give thanks to the
university and to this community
for a sympathy and devotion which
I can never forget if I live to the
age of a hundred. I can only
repay you by service, and to this
end I will serve you as I have
never served before.
"And now I would add my tribute
to the memory of that great lady
whose death so shocked us all.
The last conversation which I was
privileged to have with Mrs. Stan
ford concerned this Memorial
Church, in which one of the ideals
of her life was hound up. Truly
she was most anxious that her boys
and girls, as she loved to call them,
should enjoy the same religious ad
vantages that her dear son would
have enjoyed had he lived.
"And now, speaking as her pas
tor, may I mention some of the
wonderful qualities which were re
vealed to me in her? Her most
conspicuous trait was, I think, her
remarkable love for those who had
gone before, and next to this her
deep Christian faith and her piety.
She believed firmly in God and
earnestly strove to do her duty as
she conceived it. Lastly, I would
mention her grand hope of immor
tality, which appeared in all she
said and did. And I love to think
of her, this beautiful Easter morn
ing, reunited to those she loved so
much, enjoying the fruition of her
faith in the presence of her ever
lasting God."
