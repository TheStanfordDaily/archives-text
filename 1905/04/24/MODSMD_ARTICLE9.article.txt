# STANFORD TO ROW AT SEATTLE
## Varsity and Freshman Crews Will Participate in Three-Cornered Regatta. 
### 
Treasurer Barrett has concluded
negotiations with (he universities
of California and Washington for
two three-cornered rowing contests
to be held on Lake Washington,
Seattle, May 30th. The regatta
will he held on the afternoon of the
last day of May, the morning being
occupied with a track meet between
the University of Washington and
the University of California. The
course, a distance of two miles upon
Lake Washington, is almost a per
fect place to hold a regatta, the
water being always calm.
There is also a possibility that
the Varsity crew will go to Port
land after the Washington regatta
and take part in a general regatta
to be held there under the auspices
of the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
Both Stanford and California have
received letters from the Portland
Rowing Club urging them to take
part in this regatta.
As the Seattle regatta will not be
held for more than a month, it is
impossible to say definitely what
men will represent the Cardinal.
There is a strong probability, how
ever, that the crew will be the
same as that which rowed against
Washington on April 17th. This
was as follows: W. H. Dole, '05,
stroke; F. Zimmerman, '07, No. 3;
B. Bryan, '06, No. 2; H. G. Butter
field, '05, bow; F. W. Turner, : 08,
coxswain.
The Freshman crew which rowed
in the interclass regatta was as
follows: E. N. Smith, stroke; L. R.
Gay, No. 3; R. H. Conant, No. 2;
A. N. Cole, bow; F. W. Turner,
coxswain.
E. V. Henley, '06, who was a
promising candidate for Varsity
coxswain, has been obliged to stop
training on account of illness, and
F. W. Turner, '08, will probably
cox both Varsity and Freshman.
Both crews are rapidly rounding
into form, and by May 30th will
be capable of making a strong fight
for first place. The squad will
leave for Seattle about May 20th.
