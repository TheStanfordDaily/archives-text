The cast of "Kidnaped," the
farce by H. S. Harris, '08, which
will be presented by the Senior
class on the evening of May 18th,
has been selected by the members
of the farce committee, and re
hearsals are already under way.
Four parts remain to be filled, but
the committee expects to assign
these places within the week. Ow
ing to the lack of time no regular
competitive try-outs for places in
the cast were held. The work of
staging the piece will be solely in
the hands of the committee, as it is
believed that a professional direct
or would be unable to appreciate
or bring out correctly the Stanford
color and local allusions on which
the farce depends.
M. M. Stearns, '06, who has the
leading comedy part, is well known
to Stanford audiences through his
work as "stuntist" of last year's
Glee and Mandolin Clubs. His
experience in humorous roles is a
guarantee for his success in the
coming farce. Stearns is a mem
ber of the English Club, and
registers from Hartford, Conn.
Le Roy M. Edwards, '07, is new
to Stanford dramatics, being best
known as a prominent track man,
but he is said to have had consid
erable experience in the prepara
tory school.
Another new figure on the Stan

ford stage is A. L. Taylor, '06, who
has one of the principal parts.
Taylor comes to Stanford from
Bucknell University, and his ex
perience in dramatics was gained
there.
M. H. Thorpe, '05, who will play
"the mayor of Sunshine, Arizona,"
while never having appeared on
the Stanford stage, has taken an
active part in local dramatics and
was the author of last year's Junior
farce and of the last two Plug
Ugliee.
R. S. Harris, '08, the author of
the farce, will also make his ap
pearance in the cast. He has
taken a leading part in amateur
theatrical work before coming to
Stanford.
G. C. Mansfield, '07, who made a
reputation in local amateur dra
matic work in the Sophomore class
production of "The Rivals," where
he successfully carried off the char
acter of Captain Absolute, will be
seen in the strong comedy role of
Diamond Dinkerton, the student
detective.
Another well - known Stanford
actor, A. L. Trowbridge, '05, who
took a leading part in the Senior
opera "Patience," and is a member
of the English play cast, will be
seen as one of the San Quentin
convicts.
F. A. Curtin, '08, C. H. Merle,
'08, and F. H. Bernard, '07, will
complete the cast. All have good
records in the amateur dramatics
of preparatory schools.
