The committee chosen by the
Freshman class to select a distinc
tive hat to be worn by its members
next year is to report its choice at
a class meeting to be held on
Thursday, when the class will vote
on the question. The hat selected
by the committee seems to be a
very sensible one, but this has not
always been the case. It would
seem desirable that a distinctive
hat be adopted by the Sophomore
class, which should be inherited by
each incoming Sophomore, and
which should in time become as
distinctive as the Junior plug or
the Senior sombrero. The hat
adopted by the present Sophomore
class is both distinctive and ser
viceable. The one proposed for
next year's class may be equally
distinctive and serviceable, but if a
certain hat is ever to become typical
of a Stanford Sophomore some class
will have to adopt the choice of a
class that precedes it.
