# Varsity to Resume Practice.
## 
### 
Beginning to-morrow afternoon
the Varsity will practice daily at
4 o'clock in preparation for the
first game with Waseda, which
takes place next Saturday. The
Varsity has been having light
practice once a week ever since the
second intercollegiate game, but
they will practice hard from now
on. Neither team will play any
preliminary games, so that there
will not be a good opportunity of
making any comparisons between
the nines before they meet. Sales
will pitch for the Varsity in the
first game, but it is probable that
Rook will be in the box during the
second contest.
The Japanese ball players are
practicing daily from 11:30 to 3,
and are showing marked improve
ment in their game as they be
come used to the diamond.
