### 
The Pacific Athletic Association
will hold its annual field-day on
the University of California oval
May 6th. The meet this year will
serve as a try-out for the team that
this association will send to the
Lewis and Clarke Exposition at
Portland. The first preliminary try
out was held last fall and good per
formance were made by the Stanford
men who entered. This field-day
was a handicap contest, but the
field-day a week from Saturday
will be a scratch meet. Entrance
blanks have been sent to several
Stanford men, but only a few have
so far decided to enter. N. E.
Dole, '04, holder of the world's
record in the pole-vault, will enter
that event and is assured of his
position on the team. O. E. Hyde,
'05, who holds the Coast record in
the shot-put, will also take part
and is practically sure of being one
of the men picked to go north.
These are the only Stanford men
who have definitely signified their
intention of competing. \V. E.
Crawford, '05, J. O. Miller, '08, and
H. L. Horton, '08, are undecided
whether they will enter or not.
The men intending to enter are
training themselves, as "Dad''

est Grove to coach the Pacific Uni
versity track team.
