# RESULTS OF THE ELECTION.
## Only a Few More Than Six Hundred Votes Cast—Presley Leads "Sequoia" Fight. 
### 
The annual student body election
was held to-day. In spite of the

fact that the contests for many
of the offices were close, there
was very little excitement at
the polls and the whole elec
tion passed off quietly. An
unusually small vote was
polled, only about six hun
dred and twenty students
casting their ballots.
Promptly at 11:15 the polls
were opened, and from then
until noon there was a steady
stream of studentß anxious to
cast their ballots. During the
noon hour the voting fell off
rapidly, and during the rest
of the afternoon until the
close of the polls at 2:30 it
was slight and scattering.
The work of the election com
missioners was well done and
there was 1 ittle or no chal
lenging of voters. The results
