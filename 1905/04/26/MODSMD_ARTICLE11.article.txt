Dr. Blodgett's ready response
to the request of certain members
of the university for a weekly or
gan recital to be held in the morn
ing will be pleasant news to many
students. Since accepting the po
sition of organist Dr. Blodgett has
done much to bring the students
into closer touch with the Memorial
Church, and his generous action
will do much to strengthen the
hold which that institution already
has on their interest and affection.
