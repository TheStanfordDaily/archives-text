Editor Daily Pai.o Alto:
It seems there are to be no more
assemblies this semester because no
"distinguished speakers" are in
sight. The writer does not know
precisely what is meant in this con
nection by "distinguished," but he
has harbored the notion that the
adjective fits at least one man
right here on the campus. He
means Dr. David Starr Jordan. At
any rate, Dr. Jordan has managed
to secure fair-sized audiences in
foreign lands, and we have not
heard that he was egged. Could
not the faculty committee arrange
to let us hear Dr. Jordan? The
writer is sure that in a university
community any speaker, however
lacking in "distinction," would find
an audience at least polite. Let us
hear our president. We will prom
ise to act like gentlemen,â€”and we
cannot all afford to go to Texas.
I am, sir, '08.
