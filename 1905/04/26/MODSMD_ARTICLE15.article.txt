# Women to Have Candy Sale.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the executive
committee of the Women's League
held yesterday afternoon, it was
definitely decided to hold the candy
sale which was originally sched
uled for March 17th. The plans
as they now stand are to have the
sale on Friday afternoon, May
15th, from 3 to 5 o'clock, at the
Inn. On this occasion the Inn
porch will be used and every effort
will be put forth to make the affair
a complete success, both socially
and financially. A similar sale
was held last year at the Inn, and
despite the inclement weather it
was a pronounced success.
