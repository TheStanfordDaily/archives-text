# BATTING AVERAGES LOW.
## Team Hit Better in the Intercollegiate Series than in the Preliminary Games. 
### 
The batting averages of the ten
men who took part in the inter
collegiate series, as figured by
Scorer I. J. Bounds, '05, show the
hitting of the men as a team was
not very high during the past seas
on. Dudley heads the list with the
highest average for the year, while
Bell has the top figure for the inter
collegiate series. Sales, who had
the highest average last season, is
in third place this year. As a
team the general batting was poor,
only three men hitting over the2oo
mark, but for the intercollegiate
series seven men have averages
over this figure. Bell and Fenton,
the only freshmen on the team, are
well up in the list for the season's
batting.
The list of the times at bat, hits,
and batting average of the players
in the intercollegiate series, togeth
er with the batting average of the
men for the season, follows:

Stanford's baseball outlook for
next season is much brighter than
for several years. Only two of the

ten men who played in the inter
collegiate series will leave by grad
uation. There will be a veteran
for every place next season except
the short-stop position, which will
be vacated by Captain Trowbridge.
The other man to graduate is Lewis,
who played left field in the first
intercollegiate game; but Chalmers,
who filled this place in the second
game, will be in college. J. F.
Lanagan will have the team in
charge, and his worth as a base
ball coach is well known from the
teams that he has developed at
Belmont and from his work with
the Varsity a year ago, when Stan
ford won the second game of the
intercollegiate series.
The men who did not graduate
and are expected to return for next
season are Stott, catcher; Sales,
pitcher; Presley, first base; Bell,
second base; Fenton, third base;
Chalmers, left field; Colbert, cen
ter field; and Dudley, right field.
Besides this array of veterans,
there will be several other good
men who will strive for places on
the nine. Among the more promi
nent candidates are Rook, Salis
bury, Cadwalader, Theile, and
Daily. Rook and Salisbury were
ineligible this season, as they had
played on oilier college teams
within the past year. Rook pitched
for the Case Polytechnic nine dur
ing the season of 1904, while Salis
bury was an outfielder on the Po
mona College team during the
same period. Cadwalader played
a good game this season, and waß
a strong Varsity possibility. Theile
and Daily formed the battery of
the second team in the practice
games, and both played on the

Varsity in some of the preliminary
matches.
The playing of the entire squad
should improve next season, and
competition for places will be more
spirited. The batting of the men
should improve, as many of the
players who composed this year's
Varsity had not had the experience
that they gained in the games this
season. The battery available for
next year's team will be Sales and
Stott again, but Rook will also be
eligible. During the past season
he showed himself to be a pitcher
of the first rank, and Stanford will
not again find herself with only
one first-class twirler who can be
relied upon for the intercollegiate
series, as was the case this season.
