# ENGLISH PLAY TO-MORROW.
## Large Sale of Seats Marks First Performance of "Every Man in his Humour." 
### 
All is now in readiness for the
first performance of " Every Man
in his Humour," which will take
place to-morrow evening at 8
o'clock in Assembly Hall. Since
the tickets for the Thursday per
formance were placed on sale last
Friday morning nearly one thou
sand seats have been sold on the
campus and in Palo Alto, leaving
little doubt as to the financial suc
cess of the production. A large
number of mail orders have been
received for the second performance.
A complete full-dress rehearsal
was held last night in Assembly
Hall, and rounded out the four
months of careful work that has
been devoted to developing the in
dividual parts and training the
cast. Few changes in the personnel
of the cast have been made since
its first selection last December,
and with a single exception all of
the actors have had an opportunity
to become thoroughly familiar with
their lines. This exception is in
the character of Cash, which was to
have been taken by E. V. Henley,
'06. Henley did excellent work
with the part, but a week ago he
was compelled to withdraw from
the cast owing to sickness. Cash
will be acted by C. L. Severy,'oB.
While the postponement of the
play from the dates originally set
for the two performances early in
March made the work of the mem
bers of the cast, and of those con
nected with the play, extremely
arduous, the additional time given
for overcoming the difficulties in
herent in the play shows plainly
in the final rehearsals.
Owing to the length of the play,
it will be necessary to start
promptly at 8 o'clock, and as there
is the prospect of a crowded house
it is highly desirable that every
body should be seated by that time.
