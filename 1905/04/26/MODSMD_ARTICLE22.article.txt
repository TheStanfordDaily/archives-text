# Shooting on the Estate.
## 
### 
The following notice in regard to
shooting on the Stanford estate has
been posted on the bulletin-board:
"The attention of the students is
called to the fact that shooting is
forbidden on the university grounds
and anywhere on the Palo Alto
estate. Violations of this rule are
reported to occur frequently, but I
trust it will be sufficient to merely
call attention to the existence of
this rule.
"David Starr Jordan."
This notice was called forth as a
result of the many instances of the
use of fire arms which have been
reported to the president's office.
More than the destruction of the
game on the estate, it is feared that
such shooting may result in serious
injuries to persons on the grounds
from glancing bullets or stray shots.
