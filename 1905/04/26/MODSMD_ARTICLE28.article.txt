# "FIRST YEAR AT STANFORD."
## English Club's Book on Early History of the University Soon to Be Published. 
### 
The English Club of Stanford
University announces that it has
now in the press a volume upon
which a committee of club mem
bers has been at work for nearly
two years. This book, entitled
"The First Year at Stanford," will
contain nine sketches of the early
life of the university, especially
during the first year, 1891-1892.
The subjects follow:
1. "Early Days at Stanford," by
David Starr Jordan. This chapter
tells of Senator Stanford's plans, of
the selection of the first professors,
and the starting of the machinery
of a great institution.
2. "Beginnings in Palo Alto,"
by Eleanor Pearson Bartlett, is an
amusing account of how the town
started, and how the college com
munity began to settle in Menlo,
Mayfield and College Terrace as
well.
3. "The Cornell Colony at Palo
Alto," by Ellen Coit Elliott, was
written in 1891 for the Cornell
Magazine, and describes with much
humor the difficulty of living any
where in those days.
4. "The Early History of Ath
letics at Stanford," by Dr. Frank
Angell, furnishes an account of the
beginning of all the athletic activi
ties of the university, with the per
sonal touch which only acquaint
ances with the athletes could add.
5. "Letters Home," by Charles
K. Field, '95, deals somewhat free
ly with life in the dormitories dur
ing the first year. This chapter
consists of extracts from, and com
ments upon, letters from Jack (in
Encina), and Jill (in Roble), to
their respective families.
6. "Life Outside the Dormitories
during the First Year," by Francis
J. Batchelder, '04, describes the
founding of the fraternities, clubfl,
and boarding-houses scattered from
Menlo to Mayfield.
7. "The Beginnings of Student
Organizations,"by thesameauthor,
shows how the various student
activities commenced almost with
the opening of the university's
doors, and traces their growth
through the first year.
The last two sketches deal with
what might be termed the foreign
occupation of the campus:
8. "The Frenchman." For this
chapter, B. S. Allen, '06, inter
viewed personal friends of Peter
Coutts who still live in the vicinity,
and has combined the information
thus gathered into a sketch of un
usual interest.
9. "TheSan Francisquito Rancho,"
an article by Roy P. Ballard, '98,
is reprinted from an old Sequoia.
In tilts chapter we learn about the
ownership of the estate from the
time of the Spanish grants until
it passed into Senator Stanford's
hands.
These sketches will, it is believed,

meet the need which has existed
that some of this unwritten history,
a few of these personal reminiscences
should be preserved. The editors
make no claim that they have com
piled a history for even that first
year; they have simply collected
what material they could get now,
before it is forgotten.
The volume will be ready for dis
tribution May 15th. It will consist
of 120 pages, bound in boards,
illustrated with a number of half
tones of early photographs. The
price will be one dollar, postpaid to
any address. Orders may be sent
to Joel Nibley, Stanford University.
