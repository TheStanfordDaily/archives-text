# SCIENTISTS PLAN EXPEDITION.
## Students of Stanford and California Will Make Extended Trip to Tropics. 
### 
About the middle of next month
an expedition of unusual import
ance. in part composed of students
of science from Stanford and Cali
fornia, will leave San Francisco for
a nineteen months' expedition of
research in the tropical waters of
the South Sea.
The expedition will be under the
auspices of the Academy of Science
of San Francisco, which has for its
object original research and collec
tion of objects of scientific interest.
This institution sent out a similar
expedition to Mexico several years
ago which spent four months in
that country, but the party now
forming will make a much more ex
tended and thorough trip, and ex
pects to accomplish much greater
results.
The expedition will have for its
immediate object the exploration of
the Galapagos Islands, about 700
miles off the coast of Ecuador,
which lie exactly on the equator.
Mr. Beck, of the Academy of Science,
will have charge of the party, and
the scientific work will be under his
direction. The formation of the
party and the completion of the ar
rangements are in charge of Leverett
M. Loomis, director of the Academy.
In making up the party he chose
several experts from the academy,
and then turned to Stanford and
California for the other members.
The heads of the scientific depart
ments at each university were asked
to recommend a man from their de
partment. The Stanford representa
tives will be R. M. Holman, '07,
botanist; F. X. Williams, '06, en
tomologist, and W. H. ochsner,'o6,
geologist.
The expedition will probably take
a specially chartered yacht and pro
ceed down the coast. As now plan
ned their first stop will be at Ense
nado, on the Lower California coast
below San Diego. Thence they will
proceed to the Guadalupe Islands,
further down, and spend some time
there. The next point of explora
tion will be the Clipperton Islands,
off the coast of South America. The
Galapagos Islands themselves will
be the next point of interest, and
the actual scene of exploration and
study. It is planned not to spend
over four months in going to and
from these islands, and to leave the
other fifteen months for work there.
These islands are unusually in
teresting to scientists because of the
many forms of rare animal life
there. The islands are perfectly
dry and were formerly used as penal
colonies by several South American
countries. There is now but one
settlement of Indians, and the party
will be free to carry on its work. A
peculiar species of large tortoises
which is fast becoming extinct will
be the special object of study, and
specimens of these will be secured.
There is also a breed of wild dogs
on the islands of which the party
will endeavor to get specimens.
Bugs, birds, lizards, and rare species
of all kinds are plentiful, and the
work of the party will be along all
natural scientific lines. Before the
expedition leaves the islands the

yacht will proceed to Panama and
make a shipment of specimens to
the United States.
