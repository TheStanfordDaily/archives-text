A review of the track prospects
for next year published in another
column will prove cheerful reading
for those who are inclined to be
depressed by the recent defeat sus
tained by the Varsity. When it is
recalled that after last season the
team lost men who were good for
forty points, it was not expected
that a winning team could be de
veloped, and only the entrance of
an abundance of good material
with the class of '08 enabled the
Varsity to make a good showing
against odds. The recent good
performances of our track men has
turned the attention of preparatory
school athletes toward Stanford,
and with a little legitimate recruit
ing by Btudents and alumni there
is no reason to again fear that lack
of material which has militated
against the success of Stanford
teams in the past.
