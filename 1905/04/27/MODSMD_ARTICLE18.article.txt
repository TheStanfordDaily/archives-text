# ATHLETICS ARE EXPENSIVE.
## The
						Interesting Report of Professor Coolidge of Harvard on This Subject. 
### 
Harvard athletic expenses are
constantly increasing, according to
Professor A. C. Coolidge, acting
chairman of the Harvard Athletic
Committee, who replies to various
criticisms made by those who ob
ject to subscribing largely to ath
letic funds when football profits are
so heavy. Professor Coolidge says:
"There seems to be an impression
abroad that the finances of the
Harvard Athletic Association are in
a particularly flourishing condition,
and that it would be quite easily
possible to dispense with subscrip
tions of all kinds. Unfortunately,
such is far from being the case. It
is true that our annual receipts are
very large, and, unless football
should decline in popularity, they
are likely to remain so. On the
other hand, as far as we can see
ahead, our expenses are still less
likely to diminish; indeed, they
tend to grow in a manner that is
almost alarming. The changes
made in the coaching of rowing
and football have entailed addi
tional expense, and the suggestions
of fresh changes point much fur
ther in the same direction.
"We are continually beset by
legitimate, but numerous and ever
increasing, demands upon our re
sources. These resources are sup
plied by gate money, chiefly of the
football games, and in a very small
degree by the subscriptions of the
undergraduates. The average of
undergraduate subscriptions for all
university teams, major and minor

put together, is less than $2 per
head, taking the students of the
college and the scientific school
alone. There is a common but
mistaken idea that the buying of
a Harvard Athletic Association
ticket is a contribution to support
athletics, when, in reality, it is
nothing but a cheap form of ad
mission to the various sports. The
sums raised among the undergrad
uates to maintain all university
teams do not greatly exceed what
was subscribed by the college to
keep up the crew alone twenty
years ago, at a time when the num
bers here were not half as large as
at present, and represented far less
wealth.
"In those days no team was self
supporting â€” all had to depend
upon voluntary subscriptions, the
total of which has steadily dimin
ished. According to the report of
the graduate treasurer for the year
1889-90, the amount of money col
lected in this way for the univer
sity teams was $8990.19. Last
year it was $5013.58. Still, small
as is the present contribution, it is
nuch needed, and until there is
some sign that we can curtail in
stead of continually increasing our
expenses, the policy of the athletic
committee must be prudent rather
than thoughtlessly liberal. Under
the best of circumstances we shall
have to practice economy for years
to come."
