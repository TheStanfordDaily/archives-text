# SENIOR WEEK PROGRAM.
## Committee Decides on Form and Contents â€” Memorial to Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
The Senior program committee
has completed arrangements for the
engraving and printing of the in
vitations and programs for Senior
week. The invitations will be en
graved on plain white cards, and
will come in envelopes ready for
mailing. Each member of the
Senior class who has paid his class
assessment will be entitled to six
invitations.
The program will be one of the
most elaborate ever issued by a
graduating class, and will be in the
nature of a memorial of Mrs. Stan
ford. It will be printed in dark
brown ink on heavy drab paper,
and will be made up in folder form.
On the corner there will be a pic
ture of the inner quad. The pro
gram will contain a photogravure
of Mrs. Stanford done in sepia and
bearing a facsimile of Mrs. Stan
ford's signature. Besides a com
plete calendar of the events of
Senior week and a full list of the
graduates, the program will contain
the names of the Senior class offi
cers and committees and a schedule
of the events planned for the day
of the alumni reunion.
