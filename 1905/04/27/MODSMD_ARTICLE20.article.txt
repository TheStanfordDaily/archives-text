# History of Lacrosse.

### 
From the fact that ground has
been set aside for lacrosse in the
plans of the new athletic field, the
history of that game proves inter
esting.
The name of lacrosse is derived
from the French-Canadian words
la crosse, meaning literally the
stick with which the game is
played. The origin of the game is
wrapped up in Indian lore, for
when the first settlers had time to
notice the peaceful traits of the In
dians inhabiting the plains of
North America they found them
busily playing a game called "ba
gataway," which is accepted as the
forerunner of lacrosse. The French
settlers of Canada found the same
game among the Indian tribes in
the territory now known as Quebec
and Ontario. The Iroquois tribes
had many lacrosse stars, and in
their time the goals were sometimes
half a mile apart. Now the dis
tance is 125 yards. The Indians
had few rules in their lacrosse.
One authority says:
"The game consisted in an at
tempt of a varying number of
players to throw or carry the ball
with the aid of racquets, not unlike
small hand-nets, through an oppos
ing mass of players. Running and
dodging were the features of the
game, whose object seems to have
been to cultivate agility and en
durance. The men of a whole In
dian village not infrequently par
ticipated in a game which some
times lasted half a day."
Lacrosse may, therefore, be con
sidered as the real national game.
