# HISTORY ASSOCIATION PRIZES.
## Organization Will Reward Research Work in American and European History. 
### 
The American Historical Associ
ation, desiring to encourage histori
cal research, has offered two prizes
for the two best unpublished mono
graphs in the fields of American
and European history that shall
be submitted to the committee of
award on or before October Ist
next. The prize offered for the
best monograph in the field of
American history, known as the
Justin Winsor prize, amounts to
$100. The other, known as the
Herbert Baxter Adams prize,
amounts to $200, and is offered bi
ennially by the association.
These prizes are intended for
writers who have not yet published
any considerable work or obtained
an established reputation. The
monographs must present subject
matter of more than personal in
terest, and must, as regards their
conclusions, be a distinct contribu
tion to knowledge. The statements
must be accurate, and the treat
ment of the facts collected must
show originality and power of in
terpretation on the part of the
writers. The monograph submitted
for the Justin Winsor prize must
be based upon independent and
original investigation in American
history, by which is meant the his
tory of any of the British colonies
in America to 1776, of other por
tions of the continent which have
been included in the territory of
the United States. The monograph
submitted for the Herbert Baxter
Adams prize must be based upon

independent and original investi
gation in European history, by
which is meant the history of Eu
rope, continental or insular.
These monographs may deal
with any aspect of the particular
history â€”social, political, constitu
tional, religious, economic, ethno
logical, military or biographical,
though in the last three instances
a treatment exclusively ethnologi
cal, military or biographical would
be unfavorably received. The suc
cessful monographs will be pub
lished by the American Historical
Association in its annual report.
Further information regarding
the form in which the monographs
shall be submitted and other de
tails may be had bv inquiry at the
History department of Stanford
University.
