# Shall Colleges Become Trusts?

### 
The plan to unite Harvard Uni
versity and the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology brings up the
question of the possibility of a
union or combination of many col
leges. In an article in Harper's
Weekly entitled "Shall our Colleges
Become 'Trusts'?" Dr. Charles F.
Thwing, president of Western Re
serve University, says:
"The primary principle of the
trust is the principle of efficiency.
The purpose of increasing prices, of
crushing rivalries, are either sub
sidiary forms or practical applica
tions of the primary principle of
efficiency. The principle of effici
ency, applied to the higher educa
tion, as applied to other forms of
services, means getting the utter
most out of every condition and
from every force. It represents the

largest product for the least expen
diture. This principle of efliciency
necessitates the fullest use of every
dollar given in the endowment of
the higher education, the most con
stant use of equipment of every
form, the calling out of all resources
of teaching staff and of student
body. Negatively, it forbids the
duplication of unnecessary institu
tions. It forbids the setting up of
unnecessary educational or other
machinery for grinding out the
educational grist. It demands that
the longest return be made for each
expenditure, for this year, for all
years, for this place and thi√ü condi
tion, and for all places and condi
tions. The application of this
principle of proficiency would lead
to a union or an amalgamation of
many colleges."
The strongest argument against
the application of the "trust" prin
ciple, Dr. Thwing thinks, is the in
fluence of the individual college
and the opposition of the graduates.
