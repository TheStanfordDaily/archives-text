Asmany astwelvedifferent tribes,
it is said, are represented in the
Overtoun institution atLakeNyassa,
Africa, founded in 1895, principally
by gifts from Lord Overtoun of
Edinburgh as one of the fruits of
Livingston's explorations in Cen
tral Africa. The babel of tongues
is becoming less as English is
superseding the vernacular. Last
year sixty per cent of the evening
school examinations were in Eng
lish. Work is carried on along
four lines: these lines are evan
gelical, educational, industrial and
medical. The educational is
graded into elementary, junior,

normal, and theological, to prepare
pastors and evangelists. The in
dustrial litis two sides: (a) a school
of manual training for all; (b) ap
prenticeship to the trades. These
are (1) printing and bookbinding;
(2) carpentry; (3) building, in
cluding brickmaking, bricklaying,
stone quarrying, hewing and build
ing; (4) agriculture.
