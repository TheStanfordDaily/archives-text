# NO AGREEMENT ON HAT.
## Freshmen Reject Report of Their Committee and Refuse to Adopt Sophomore Headgear. 
### 
The Freshman class met to-day
for the purpose of adopting a class
emblem. The committee appointed
for this purpose reported in favor
of a gray felt hat with a red band
and red trimmings on the edge of
the brim; it was also suggested
that the brim be worn turned up
in front. The hat was to cost two
dollars, provided each member of
the class purchased one. After
considerable discussion a motion to
reject the report of the committee
was carried.
It was then moved to adopt the
present Sophomore hat as the class
hat, but the motion was lost.
The discussion of the various
members of the class showed a de
sire to obtain some sort of an em
blem which would be worn by all
future Sophomore classes, but they
were unable to reach any definite
conclusion. A new committee con
sisting of J. 0. Miller, F. R. Lana
gan, P. Stewart, M. A. Gunst, J.
W. Lilienthal and A. R. Mac-
Swain, chairman, was appointed to
make further investigation.
The report of the committee on
sweaters reported a lack of funds
for the purchase of track and boat
ing sweaters. All class dues have
not yet been paid, and it was urged
that all delinquents should confer
with the collectors at their earliest
convenience.
