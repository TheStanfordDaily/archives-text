# Arrangements for Waseda Series.
## 
### 
Final arrangements for the Stan
ford-Waseda baseball series have
been completed by Manager Bar
rett. The first game will be played
on the Varsity diamond on Satur
day, April 29th, at 2:30 p.m. The
choice of an umpire was left in the
hands of the Waseda team, and, on
their suggestion, J. F. Lanagan, '00,
will handle the indicator next
Saturday. Admission to the game
will be fifty cents and there will be
no reserved seats.
The second game of the series
will be played at Recreation Park,
in San Francisco, on Monday, May
1, at 3:30 p.m. More definite an
nouncement regarding this game
will be made later.
Besides the series with Stanford,
Manager Abe has scheduled two
other games for the team while in
California. At the invitation of
Rear-Admiral Whiting, U. S. N.,
the team will visit the Yerba
Buena Training School on Wednes
day, May 3d, and will cross bat√ü
with the team from the training
ship Pensacola. On Saturday, May
Bth, Waseda will meet California
on the Berkeley campus, and Man
ager Abe hopes to be able to secure
a second game with the Blue and
Gold before the team leaves for
Chicago.
Meanwhile Waseda continues to

practice daily on the Varsity dia
mond and the whole team is faet
rounding into shape. Every day
they practice batting and fielding,
paying particular attention to their
stick work, for it is in this depart
ment of the game that Manager
Abe fears their chief weakness
lies.
Without doubt the best indi
vidual player on the team is Ha
shido, captain and short-stop. He
handles himself well in the field
and no chance seems too difficult
for him. The work of Izumitani
on first base has not been of a very
high order, his special weakness
seeming to lie in handling low
thrown balls; but Manager Abe
says- that Izumitani, while never
showing up well in practice,always
puts up a good game when en
gaged in a match.
No opportunity has yet been
given to judge Kono's work as a
pitcher, for although he takes his
regular turn in pitching for batting
practice, Captain Hashido will not
permit him to throw any curves
for fear of possible injury to his
arm. Kono, however, seems to
have a good deal of speed and ex
cellent control over his straight
ball, and should be by no means
easv for the Cardinal batters.
