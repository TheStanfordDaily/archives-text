# Contest for "Chaparral " Manager.
## 
### 
The Chaparral will open a com
petition beginning next semester
for undergraduates aspiring to the
position of manager of the comic
sheet. The competition will last
the whole of the college year and
the position of assistant manager
will be bestowed on the man who
during the course of the compe
tition displays the best executive
ability and who turns in the great
est number of advertisements. Six
students have already signified
their intention of trying for the
place and these will secure ads
during the summer.
The object in instituting this
system is to put the management
of the Chaparral on as thorough
a merit basis as possible.
