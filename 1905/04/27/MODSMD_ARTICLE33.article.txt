# TRACK PROSPECTS BRIGHT.
## Stanford Team Will Lose Only a Few Strong Men by-Graduation. 
### 
Perhaps at no time in the his
tory of Stanford track athletics has
the end of the season witnessed bet
ter prospects for a winning team in
the coming year. The number of
athletes lost by graduation and by
the operation of the four-year com
petition rule is unusually small.
Captain H. W. 8e11,'05, will return
to college next year, but he will be
ineligible, as he has already com
peted in four intercollegiate field
days. L. G. Burr, '05, winner of
the two-mile run, graduates this
year, but it is possible that he may
return for graduate work. W. H.
Lanagan, '05, the fast hurdler, will
also graduate, and it is improbable
that he will return. W. E. Craw
ford, '05, is another point-winner
who will not compete again. 11. S.
Carter, '05, will be lost by gradu
ation.
California's losses will also be
slight, as some of her strongest
men, like Sperry, Gilmore, and
Zacharias, have two years of com
petition before them.
Stanford Team Will Be Strong.
Without depending on the new
material which will probably enter
with the class of '09, Stanford will
have a team which will compare
favorably with the Blue and Gold
team.
In the hundred yards it is prob
able that E. C. Cope, '08, will be in
condition to participate next year,
and with Wood and Edwards en
tered, the Cardinal will be strong
in this event. Snedigar, who has
recently been elected captain of the
California team, will be the main
stay of the rival university in the
short sprint. Practically the same
men for both colleges will be called
upon to take points in the two
twenty.
In the 440-yard dash Stanford
has a number of first-class perform
ers, with J. O. Miller, '08, heading
the list. Freeman, '06, Edwards,
'07, Davis, '08, and Severy, '08,
have all proven their ability in this
event, and with a year's additional
training some of them will loom up
as star men. The good showing of
Macfarland,'o7, in the relay against
California will probably induce
Trainer Moulton to train the crack
hurdler for the 440.
Miller to Stay with the Half.
In spite of the fact that he took
only third place in the half-mile at
Berkeley, Miller's superiority in
this race is generally recognized.
L. G. Russell, '06, is good for
second place under any conditions,
and Severy, '08, and F. G. Smith,
'05, are promising men in the mid
dle distance. It is said that Mish
ler, who won this race for Califor
nia this year, will not return to
college.
Miller, '08, will again take care
of the mile run for the Cardinal
