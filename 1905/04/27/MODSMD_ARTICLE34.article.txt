# Vacation Work.

Men and women students desiring
well-paid work during summer should
look into the new proposition of the
King-Richardson Company. They do
not offer an untried and catchy experi
ment to catch the innocent, but a bona
lidc guarantee hacked by the business
experience of a quarter of a century.

team, and with a large number of
hard workers out for this event
Stanford may take more than five
points. Meals will probably com
pete again for California next year.
If Burr returns to college, Stan
ford can reasonably expect first
place in the two-miles. Nash,'o7,
Geibel, '08, and Cragin, '08, have
all proven their mettle in the long
distance, and have good prospects
of becoming point-winners next
year.
With Macfarland, '07, Weller,
'07, and Horton, '08, entered in the
hurdles, the Cardinal has little to
fear in these events.
Weakness in the Field Events.
It is in the field events that Stan
ford will be the weakest unless un
expectedly strong material is
brought in by 1909. In the high
jump Horton, '08, and Mac Swain,
'08, are left as the best performers.
California will have Sperry and
Boy nton.
Weller, '07, and Horton,'oB, will
be matched against Sperry and
Zacharias in the hammer-throw.
Weller has never trained consist
ently for this event, and he may
develop into a formidable rival for
the strong California entries.
The broad jump will be cared
for by Weller, Redman, and West,
who will return to college next
year. Boynton, Sperry, and Sned
igar are California's best perform
ers in this event.
Horton is the only shot-putter
left on the team, and he will be
pitted against Sperry and Gilmore
of California.
Under ordinary conditions both
Lanagan, '08, and Kocher, '08, are
superior to Zoph of California in
the pole-vault, and they ought to
take a majority of the points in
that event.
With the improvement that can
be expected from another year's
experience, the Stanford relay team
ought to be the fastest on the Coast.
