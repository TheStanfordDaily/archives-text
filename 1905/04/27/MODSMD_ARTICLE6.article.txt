# "QUAD" PROSPECTUS ISSUED.
## Pamphlet Gives Brief Summary of Junior Annual, Which Will Be Out Tuesday. 
### 
A small pamphlet summarizing
the contents of the 1906 Quad and
containing general information con
cerning the issuance of the annual
has been gotten out and will be dis
tributed among the campus resi
dents. Copies are also being mailed
to over three hundred alumni of the
university.
The Quad will be placed on sale
on next Tuesday, May 2d. The
1906 annual will be larger than
any Quad yet gotten out. The
edition will be limited to about six
hundred copies, in order to avoid
the possibility of having any books
left on hand. The management of
the annual will hold the price of
the book up to the regular sum,
$2.50, and there will be no later
reduction. The price to Juniors is
$1.50. On receipt of the price of
the book, alumni may have their
books left at any campus address
desired. A dozen edition de luxe
volumes of the Quad will be pub
lished and put on sale for $5 per
copy.
Following the general lines laid
down in the making of previous
Quads, the book will comprise a
complete record of the college year
1904-05, arranged appropriately in
the general departments of classes,
memorial, music, dramatics, pub
lications, josh, literature, organiza
tions and athletics.
A feature of the book will be the
memorial to Mrs. Stanford. Re
garding this department the pros
pectus says:
"The sad death of Mrs. Stanford,
who had for so many years given
her best thought to the welfare of
the university, is the subject of a
beautiful and artistic memorial,
the contributions of Dr. Jordan,
the Rev. C. R. Brown and others
forming the latest permanent word
on the life-work of this great
minded woman."
Among the special articles will
be a description, map and dis
cussion of the great athletic field,
now in course of construction. To
the undergraduate an article trac
ing the tendencies of modern foot
ball will be of great interest.
In the athletic department every
athletic event recorded, with the
exception of baseball and tennis, is
a Stanford victory. The college
year from April 1, 1904, to April
1, 1905, is taken up. The success
ful showing made by Stanford ath
letes has warranted a large increase
in the size of this department.
Much space has. been given to
pictures of athletic events, and
characteristic poses of football
heroes and point winners have been
faithfully reproduced. Diagrams
of the intercollegiate football games
are one of the newly introduced
features of this department of the
book.
More space has been given to the
josh department than last year, in
response to a general and urgent
demand from the students. The
department is profusely illustrated,
while the verse and "fraternity
statistics" form the distinctive and
spicy features.
