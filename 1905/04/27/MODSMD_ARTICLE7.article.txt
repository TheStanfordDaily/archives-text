# WORK ON GYMNASIUM SLOW.
## New Building Cannot Be Used Before September, 1906â€”Next Junior Prom There. 
### 
Contrary to the general expecta
tion of the students, the new Gym
nasium building will not be ready
for use before a year from next
September. While the exterior
work on the building stands to-day
practically completed, a year's work
on the interior finishings will be
needed to fully complete the build
ing. Here the work is necessarily
slow owing to the nature of the
work, which prevents one contract
or going ahead until another has
finished. The plastering cannot be
completed until the great stairways
are in place. The construction of
these stairways alone will take four
months. The building must be
wired for electricity, the steam
heating plant installed, much
plumbing done, and hardwood
fioors laid throughout the building.
No particular effort is being made
to rush the building to completion,
as it is desired to make the new
Gymnasium a perfect piece of con
structional work.
The great ball-room, which will
occupy the entire top floor of the
new building, will be finished much
earlier than the remainder of the
Gymnasium. Should the univer
sity authorities so desire, it will be
possible to hold the '07 Junior
Prom there next April.
