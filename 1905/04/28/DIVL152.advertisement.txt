HE WANTS
NOTHING BETTER
(From the California Limited
Log Book)
My lirst trip across the American
continent. This certainly is, in all
respects, an admirable train service.
I can hope for nothing better, and if
I am as well served on other lines
shall be abundantly satisfied. The
attendance and meals are excellent.
