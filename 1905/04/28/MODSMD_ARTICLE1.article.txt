# "Every Man in his Humane" a Faithful Picture of Life in Elizabeth's Time.
## Production of Jonson's Comedy by English Club. 
### 
IN "Every Man in his Humour,"
as acted last night in the As
sembly Hall, the English Club
demonstrated once more its ability
to present Elizabethan comedy with
the utmost completeness and excel
lence of detail. This comedy of
J orison's is, more than almost any
other, essentially a character study.
For the success of such a play, in
which most of the actors are of
nearly equal importance, an unus
ually good cast was needed, and in
this very feature it would have
been difficult to improve upon last
night's performance. Almost with
out exception the characters were
convincingly real, —the people on
the stage last night were Eliza
bethans, not those students whom
we met on the quad yesterday.
The audience was impressed with
the fact that more could not poß
sihly have been made of the play
than was done last night. The
cast, the costumes, the staging —
all the various accessories of the
performance —had been given the
mostcareful and intelligent atten
tion. The play did what it set out
to do —it portrayed the life of the
time, and presented some of the
most striking types of the day with
much humour and local color.
This fact should be borne in mind
when we compare last night's com
edy with ''The Knight of the Burn
ing Bestle," acted by the English
Club two years ago. Such a com
parison was generally made last
night, with the result greatly in
favor of "The Knight"—not be
cause last evening's comedy was
not so successfully presented as the
earlier one, but simply because the
play first seen was livelier, less of
a study, and therefore more likely
to interest a modern college audi
ence.
"The Knight" had possibly less
plot, but it was made up of the
most sparkling dialogue,—it was
all life and action from start to
finish. Jonson's play, on the con
trary, is indisputably slow in com
parison; the first half drags, and
that through no fault of this par
ticular performance. In place of
the short,interrupted conversation
of the Beaumont and Fletcher play,
we have here, in general, long mon
ologues which the best effort can
scarcely keep from being tiresome.
To an Elizabethan audience these
lengthy speeches were doubtless
among the most amusing things in
the play, full as they are of local
hits and contemporary allusions.
Even the characterization must
have appealed more to such an
audience, since in the various affec
tations represented fach spectator
might see exaggerated his own par

ticular detestation in the way of
manners and fashions. We, how
ever, are not content with a toler
ant grin at the follies of a bygone
age, which is nearly all the enter
tainment which "Every Man in his j
Humour" furnishes until toward j
the end of the play.
A comparison of the two plays,
however, while it may affect one's
opinion of the wisdom of choosing
the last play, cannot interfere with
one's estimate of the performance. 1
There is a much more equal chance
for good acting in .Tonson's play,
where there are six or eight char
acters of almost equal importance,
than in Beaumont and Fletcher's,

where there are only three really
leading parts.
Brainworm, Bohadil, Master Ma
thevv, Stephen, Kitely, and Cob
had the most chance for artistic
work, and left nothing to be de
sired in their roles. As the crafty
servant, Brainworm was really the
central figure of the play, all the
action hinging on his tricks. R.
IT. Baker, 'OS, did full justice to
this imporant part, being equally
clever in voice, gesture, and facial
expression.
J. K. Bonnell, '02, added one
more character to his long list of
successes. As the braggart Cap
tain Bohadil, he was at first airy

and conceited, with all the in
souciant swagger that the role im
plies; and later, when his mask of
bravado has fallen, he was the pic
ture of humiliation and defeat.
During the last scene at Justice
Clement's, Mr. Bonnell did some of
his very best acting when he had
no lines at all and the interest of
the part was dependent entirely
upon himself.
L. \V. Cutler, '06, as Master Ma
thew, well deserved the applause
which followed many of his
speeches. His was one of the most
finished parts in the whole per
formance. Every motion and in
