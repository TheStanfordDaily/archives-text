## Waseda's Crack Players to Meet the Varsity To-morrow Afternoon at 2:30. 
### 
Waseda University of Tokio will
meet the Stanford Varsity to-mor
row afternoon in the first interna
tional collegiate baseball game in
the history of that branch of ath
letics. The game will take place
at 2:30 on the campus diamond.
The Japanese team is not con
fident of victory, but on the other
hand if they should be the winners
to-morrow it would be a case of
being agreeably surprised. The
warm weather during the last few
days has had a bad effect on the
players, as they are not accus
tomed to the heat encountered here.
The men were tired out after their
long practice yesterday afternoon,
and Manager Abe decided that it
would be better to go without prac
tice to-day.
Abe, when asked about the out
come of the game, said that he
thought the chances of his charges
winning were very poor. He stated
that the team had not made the
trip with the expectation of win
ning a number of victories, but to
inaugurate international athletics
with this country.
The result of to-morrow's game
will depend largely upon the
pitchers. If A. Kono, who will
pitch for Waeeda, is able to keep
the Varsity from hitting safely, the
score will be close. The team will
give him good support, as they
have shown that they have been
well drilled in fielding. It in un
certain how the Japanese will play
when they get in a difficult situ
ation, as they may not be able to
steady down at critical moments.
The probable line-up follows:
WASEDA STANFORD
Kono p Sales
Yamawaki c Stott
Izumitani lb Presley
Oshikawa 2b Bell
Suyama 3b Fenton
Hashido (c) ss...Trowbridge(c)
