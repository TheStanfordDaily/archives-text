# SENIORS LEVY ASSESSMENT.
## Estimates Furnished by Senior Week Committee at Class Meeting To-day. 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior class
to-day- an assessment of $2 was
levied on the 187 members of the
class. The class was compelled to
make this assessment on account of
the small amount of money now in
the treasury, and in consideration
of Senior week. The various com
mittees furnished estimates to O. S.
Lousley, chairman of the finance
committee, and the finance com
mittee to-day recommended that a
$2 assessment be levied. A motion
to adopt the recommendation of the
finance committee passed unani
mously.
President Trowbridge brought up
the matter of the advisability of
men wearing caps and gowns dur
ing Senior week, but as the major
ity of the members present were
women the matter was dropped.
Class sweaters were voted to all
men who represented the class in
the recent interclass games, pro
vided such men were members of
the Varsity baseball squad. Those
members who played on the team
for the first time, and who were not
on the Varsity squad, will not re
ceive sweaters.
