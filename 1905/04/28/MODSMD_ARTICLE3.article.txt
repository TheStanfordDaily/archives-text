In another column will be found
an article by Professor Melville
Best Anderson on the English
Club'B production of "P3very Man
in his Humour." It is an article
that is well worth reading, for it
must carry conviction as a very
fair statement of the play's merits.
It must be admitted that the com
edy is one which does not appeal
very strongly to a modern audience;
but as a character study it is a fine
piece of work, and the manner of
its presentation was a triumph for
the organization which prepared it,
and for the actors who gave it life.
