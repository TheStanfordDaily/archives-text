President David Starr Jordan has
issued the following statement in
regard to the Carnegie fund for the
support of retired college professors:
"Our universities recognize that
the successful professor takes the
vow of poverty. Whatever his
salary, the demands on him outrun
it, and if he tries to make money
his success in doing so is at the ex
pense of his usefulness aB teacher
or investigator. Our universities,
moreover, have undertaken more
than they have means to carry out.
The demand for higher education,
and especially for professional
training, far exceeds the right pro
vision for it. Hence universities
as well as professors, whatever their
income, are poor in fact, the needs
of students in every case far out
running the income.
"Yet most universities wisely
managed recognize that it is eco
nomical to treat generously the
professor emeritus. To save him
from worry in event of old age and
other disability is to add greatly to
his present usefulness. In making
adequate provision for retiring pro
fessors a certainty throughout the

country, Mr. Carnegie has done a
noble piece of work for American
education. It will serve to bring
better men into the profession of
higher education, and will strength
en the hands of those now engaged
in the work.
"As for ways and means, experi
ence brings wisdom. Meanwhile
the admirable pension scheme at
Harvard furnishes a safe point of
departure."
