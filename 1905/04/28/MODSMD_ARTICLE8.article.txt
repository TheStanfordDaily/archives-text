# CARNEGIE ESTABLISHES GREAT FUND FOR AGED PROFESSORS.
## Ten Million Dollars Given by the Steel Magnate for the Benefit of Superannuated Educators. 
### 
A NDIIEVV CARNEGIE has made
/v a gift of $10,000,000 to pro
vide annuities forcollege professors
whom age or disability has inca
pacitated for active service. The
fund, which consists of United
States Steel Corporation five per cent
first-mortgage bonds, is held in
trust by a board of trustees, com
posed of college presidents and
representatives of the Carnegie in
terests. President Jordan has been
honored with a place on this board,
and has, moreover, the special dis
tinction of being the only college
president west of the Mississippi to
be so honored. Professors in the
United States, Canada, and New
foundland will share in the distri
bution of the income of the fund.
Dr. H. S. Pritchett, president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and F. A. Vanderlip, vice
president of the National City Bank
of New York, have been appointed
by Mr. Carnegie to obtain data on
the subject, which will be presented
at the first meeting of the board, to
be held November 15th. The an
nouncement of the gift was made
by Mr. Vanderlip in the following
letter to the press:
"Mr. Carnegie has transferred to
a board of trustees, consisting in
the main of presidents of the most
important colleges in the United

States and Canada, $10,000,000
first-mortgage five per centSteelCor
poration bonds. The purpose of
the trust fund thus created is to
provide annuities for college pro
fessors in the United States, Can
ada and Newfoundland, who from
old age or physical disability are
no longer in a position to render
the most efficient service. It is
Mr. Carnegie's belief that this fund
will not only provide a dignified
pension system for a body of the
most worthy, self-sacrificing and
poorly paid men, but that it will
be of distinct value to the cause of
education in offering an opportun
ity to the trustees of a college to
retire members of the faculty who
have faithfully served the institu
tion for many years, and to replace
such men with young, intelligent
and efficient professors. I am tak
ing the liberty to inclose herewith
Mr. Carnegie's letter outlining the
nature of his bequest. This letter
was written to the members of the
board of trustees. The list of trus
tees is also inclosed. All have ac
cepted.
"Steps will be taken at once to
organize a corporation to formally
receive the bequest. The first meet
ing of the board of trustees has
been called for November 15th. In
the meantime it is Mr. Carnegie's

desire that Dr. Pritchett, president
of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and myself proceed to
obtain data from all the institu
tions concerned, for use at the
meeting of the trustees. The bonds
which Mr. Carnegie has so gener
ously donated have a market value
of $i 1,000,000, and will produce an
annual income of $500,000.
"The corporation which is being
formed will be styled the' Carnegie
Foundation.'
Yours very truly,
"F. A. Vanderlip."
Mr. Carnegie's letter to the trus
tees is dated April 18th, and is as
follows:
"I have reached the conclusion
that the least rewarded of all the
professions is that of the teacher in
our higher educational institutions.
New York City generously, and
very wisely, provides retiring pen
sions for teachers in her public
schools and also for her policemen.
Very few, indeed, of our colleges
are able to do so. The consequences
are grievous. Able men hesitate to
adopt teaching as a career, and
many old professors whose places
should be occupied by younger men
cannot be retired.
"I have, therefore, transferred to
you and your successors, as trus
tees, $10,000,000 five per cent first
mortgage bonds of the United States
Steel Corporation, the revenue from
which is to provide retiring pen
sions for the teachers of univer
sities, colleges and technical schools
in our own country, Canada and
Newfoundland, under such con
ditions as you may adopt from

time to time. Expert calculations
show that the revenue will he ample
for the purpose.
"The fund applies to the three
classes of institutions named with
out regard to race, sex, creed or
color. We have, however, to recog
nize that state and colonial govern
ments which have established or
mainly support universities, col
leges or schools may prefer that
their relations shall remain exclu
sively with the state. I cannot,
therefore, presume to include them.
"There is another class which
states do not aid, their constitu
tions in some cases even forbidding
it, namely, sectarian institutions.
Many of these established long
ago were truly sectarian, but to-day
are free to all men of all creeds or
of none, if such are to he consid
ered sectarian. Only such as are
under control of a 6ect or require
trustees (or a majority thereof),
officers, faculty or students to be
long to any specified sect, or which
impose any theological test, are to
be excluded.
"Trustees shall hold office five
years and be eligible for re-election.
The first trustees shall draw lots
for one, two, three, four or five-year
terms, so that one-fifth shall retire
each year.
"Each institution participating
in the fund shall cast one vote for
trustee.
"The trustees are hereby given
full powers to manage the trust in
every respect, to fill vacancies of
non-ex-oflicio members, appoint ex
ecutive committees, employ agents,
change securities, and, generally
speaking, to do all things necessary
