Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I be indulged in a word
with respect to the reception
given to the old English play last
evening? Of course the temptation
to criticize is strong; and we who
are critics, or who would be thought
to be such, may have our reserva
tions to make. At the present mo
ment, however, adverse criticism
may fairly be held in reserve for
a little. What is called for now is
warm support for a high and ex
ceedingly difficult enterprise, hon
estly undertaken and carried out
with intelligence and competence.
Perhaps we, the audience, did
not quite realize how much the
young actors stood in need of our
sympathetic appreciation. Per
haps, also, the actors were not cog
nizant of the genuine interest felt
by the rather undemonstrative
audience. Certainly every player
did his utmost; just as certainly
everyone could and can do better
with a little moral support. Now
that we have seen the play once
and have got hold of the plot, let
us go again,—not leaving at home
that breezy "Stanford spirit" which
does so much for our success in
other contests. For this is a con
test against odds, —our inexperi
ience, the old language, the unfa
miliar allusions, etc., —odds in
spite of which we are winning a
signal success.
The audience last night, al
though it did seem a liit cold, was
entirely friendly and attentive.
The unflagging interest with which
the long performance was followed
is significant. So critical an audi
ence could not have been held at
such a strain so long by an in
ferior company. W r e were all so
busy thinking, observing, trying to
master the complexities of the plot,
that we forgot to express the inter
est and pleasure which we felt. I
know that I am expressing the feel
ing of others, as well as my own, in
saying that the performance was
more intelligent, more artistic, and
therefore more delightful than the
Shaksperean performance of the
Greet company.
The undertaking would be a ser
ious one even for the most skilled
company that could be brought to
gether. We certainly should not
dole out such scant measure of ap
plause as we might give to a pro
fessional performance of a modern
play. If a right understanding
can only be established between
players and audience, we may fair
ly expect a really admirable and
worthy presentation of this famous
classic. Melville B. Anderson.
