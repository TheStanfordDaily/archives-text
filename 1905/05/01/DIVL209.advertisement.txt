In any Life Insurance Company
the net cost to the policy holder
= the premiums paid —the dividends received
Every premium = the mathematical cost -1- the expense loading.
High premiums are due to heavy loading for expenses.
Dividends are paid from the surplus arising from
1. Savings from the expected mortality.
2. Savings from the expense loading.
3. Interest earned in excess of the legal requirements.
4. Surrender charges.
5. Gain (or loss) on securities and property of the company.
The fundamentals are low death rate, low expense rate, good investments in
first-class securities.
