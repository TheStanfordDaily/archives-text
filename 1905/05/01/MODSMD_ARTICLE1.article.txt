# CHANGES IN WOODWORKING.
## Manual Training Department to Be Abolished. Foreman Eugene Soule Transferred. 
### 
According to an announcement
made public through the president's
office, there will be several import
ant changes made in the Manual
Training and Woodworking depart
ments of the university. Eugene
Soule, who for the past eleven years
has been foreman of the department,
will be transferred to the jurisdic
tion of the business office, and be
ginning with next semester the
Manual Training department will
be abolished so far as allowing
credit toward graduation is con
cerned. The work now carried on
in this department will be incor
porated with the courses giving in
Woodworking and Pattern-Making
under the department of Mechani
cal Flngineering,for which the usual
credit will be given.
The Manual Training department
will be discontinued because the
university authorities feel that the
sort of work that has been done
here by the students in the last few
years is not of the character for
which the university can conscien
tiously give credit toward a degree.
Facilities will be given in the future
as now for the student who wishes
to work in the shop for his own
amusement or advancement, but
no credit hours will be allowed for
this work.
Foreman Eugene Soule, who has
for so many years been in charge
of the Manual Training depart
ment, was an intimate friend of
Senator Stanford when the latter
was living in Sacramento as Gover
nor of the State. On the founding
of the university Mr. Soule came to
Stanford, and as an expert wood
worker was employed in the con
struction of the university build
ings. Three years after the college
was opened Mr. Soule was made
foreman of the newly established
department of Manual Training,
and has remained in charge for the
past eleven years. Failing health
due to increasing years has made
the task difficult for the veteran
worker in the past few months, but
President Jordan states that the
work has always been performed to
his entire satisfaction.
Instructor Edward J. Stanley,
who now has charge of the wood
working and pattern-making work,
and who will probably eventually
have charge of the entire depart
ment as it will be reorganized, has
been granted a year's leave of ab
sence, to begin with May of this
year. Mr. Stanley is to spend the
year in further study of his special
line of work, and will return to the
university in 1906 prepared to re
sume his work and supplement the
practical work of his department
with one or more lecture courses on
the theoretical side of the work.
