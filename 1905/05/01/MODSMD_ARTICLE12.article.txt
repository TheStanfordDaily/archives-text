The action of the Senior class in
giving sweaters only to those men
who, in addition to playing on the
class baseball team, were members
of the Varsity squad, would seem to
be a long step toward a much
needed reform. The cry has been
going up for years that class
sweaters are "cheap," and there
has been good ground for the pro
test when it has bee!) possible for a
man to don a baseball suit only on
the afternoon of the class game
and then to be voted numerals. It
has, too, until the present year
been not uncommon for class cap
tains to put into the game men
who had small license to play; but
during the past season Coach Cow
den seems to have discouraged that
practice, and with the advent of
Lanagan as coach next year it is
safe to say this kind of favoritism
will be seen no more. With these
abuses gone, and perhaps with
some protection against three-man
hurdle races and other uncontested
events in which numerals are won
by men of but little athletic abil
ity, we will be able to regard the
class numerals as we do the Var
sity "S," —the reward of faithful
training and the best effort, and
proof of athletic ability of an ac
cepted standard.
