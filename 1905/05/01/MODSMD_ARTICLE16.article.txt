# STANFORD DEFEATS WASEDA.
## Japanese Varsity Plays an Interesting Game, Although Showing Lack of Experience. 
### 
The largest crowd that ever wit
nessed a baseball game on the local
diamond saw Waseda University
defeated by Stanford in the first in
ternational collegiate game by the
score of 9 to 1. Although Stanford
outclassed the Japanese players in
every point of the game, the contest
was closer than the score shows, for
a number of the Varsity's runs
were due to costly errors on the
part of the Japanese at critical mo
ments.
Of the two thousand spectators
that gathered to see the game, at
least five hundred were Japanese,
who filled one entire section of the
bleachers. Nearly every one of the
visiting team's rooters carried ma
roon banners with the letters
"\V. U." on them. When the Wa
seda nine arrived the Japanese
rooting section rose and cheered,
and they repeated this performance
when Captain Hashido scored in
the second inning.
After an understanding had been
reached on the ground rules be
tween Captains Trowbridge and
Hashido,tiie Japanese team took the
field. They appeared to be a trifle
nervous, and Pitcher Kono allowed
Bell to take first base on four balls.
Dudley tried to bunt, but knocked
a fly into Kono's hands. Bell then
tried to steal second, but Yama
waki, the catcher, threw accurately
and Bell was out at the base. Fen
ton struck out, and it looked as
though Waseda was strong on the
defensive. At their turn at bat

they were put out in one-two-three
order, but each man hit the ball,
and every time it went toward
right field, showing that they were
not used to a pitcher with speed.
The Japanese kept up their good
fielding in the second inning, allow
ing only one player to get to first
base.
In the last half of the second
inning Waseda succeeded in getting
one run, the team's only score of
the game. Captain Hashido, the
first man at bat, hit to Trowbridge,
who threw wild to first, allowing
the runner to reach first safely. A
minute later he went to second 011
a wild pitch by Sales. KOllO
knocked a hit over second and
Hashido reached the home plate.
The next three players were put
out in rapid succession, retiring the
side.
Stanford scored three times in
the third inning. With one out
Stott got a base on balls and ad
vanced to third on Presley's hit,
Presley meanwhile stealing second.
The Japanese team was in a hard
position,and they became "rattled"
when Dudley bunted. Kono got
the ball and threw it to first base,
but the player was off the bag and
the ball went into the crowd, allow
ing Stott to score. Fenton hit to
short, who threw to the catcher to
prevent Bell from scoring. Bell
had passed third base, and to catch
him at that bag Yamawaki threw
to the baseman. The throw was
too high and the ball went out into
the field, both Bell and Dudley
scoring.
Stanford did not score again in
this inning, but easily added six
more during the remainder of the

game. These runs were partly the
result of errors made by Waseda on
account of nervousness, with the
exception of one which was the re
sult of a single by Colbert and a
three-bagger by Stott. Waseda
came near getting another run in
the last inning, but after advancing
men as far as second and third, the
batters were unable to hit safely.
From the way Waseda fielded in
practice it was expected that they
would play a strong defensive game,
and this was shown to be true, with
the exception that they became
nervous and were erratic whenever
the Varsity attempted to score.
The majority of the seven errors
charged to them were due to wild
throws. Otherwise their fielding
was good, for they caught some
difficult flies in good form.
The department of the game in
which they were strongest was base
running, and only the excellent
throwing of Stott to second pre
vented a large number of stolen
bases. The hitting of the team
was something of a surprise.
Though they hit safely but three
times, most of the players showed
ability to connect with the ball,
and only six of them struck out.
They showed that they were not
used to batting as swift a ball as
the one thrown by Sales, for a
majority of the players hit the ball
a little late.
The battery, consisting of Pitch
er Kono and Catcher Yamawaki,
played good ball. Kono kept his
head better than any man on the
team, and it was a hit from his bat
that scored Haehido in the second
inning. Though he allowed eleven
hits, he kept them pretty well

scattered, and the score would have
been smaller were it not for the
costly errors made by his team
mates. Yamawaki threw to second
base in fine form, especially during
the early part of the game, and a
number of players were put out
trying to steal this base. Score:

came near getting another run in
the last inning, but after advancing
men as far as second and third, the
batters were unable to hit safely.
From the way Waseda fielded in
practice it was expected that they
would play a strong defensive game,
and this was shown to be true, with
the exception that they became
nervous and were erratic whenever
the Varsity attempted to score.
The majority of the seven errors
charged to them were due to wild
throws. Otherwise their fielding
was good, for they caught some
difficult flies in good form.
The department of the game in
which they were strongest was base
running, and only the excellent
throwing of Stott to second pre
vented a large number of stolen
bases. The hitting of the team
was something of a surprise.
Though they hit safely but three
times, most of the players showed
ability to connect with the ball,
and only six of them struck out.
They showed that they were not
used to batting as swift a ball as
the one thrown by Sales, for a
majority of the players hit the ball
a little late.
The battery, consisting of Pitch
er Kono and Catcher Yamawaki,
played good ball. Kono kept his
head better than any man on the
team, and it was a hit from his bat
that scored Haehido in the second
inning. Though he allowed eleven
hits, he kept them pretty well

scattered, and the score would have
been smaller were it not for the
costly errors made by his team
mates. Yamawaki threw to second
base in fine form, especially during
the early part of the game, and a
number of players were put out
trying to steal this base. Score:
STANFORD.

The largest crowd that ever wit
nessed a baseball game on the local
diamond saw Waseda University
defeated by Stanford in the first in
ternational collegiate game by the
score of 9 to 1. Although Stanford
outclassed the Japanese players in
every point of the game, the contest
was closer than the score shows, for
a number of the Varsity's runs
were due to costly errors on the
part of the Japanese at critical mo
ments.
Of the two thousand spectators
that gathered to see the game, at
least five hundred were Japanese,
who filled one entire section of the
bleachers. Nearly every one of the
visiting team's rooters carried ma
roon banners with the letters
"\V. U." on them. When the Wa
seda nine arrived the Japanese
rooting section rose and cheered,
and they repeated this performance
when Captain Hashido scored in
the second inning.
After an understanding had been
reached on the ground rules be
tween Captains Trowbridge and
Hashido,tiie Japanese team took the
field. They appeared to be a trifle
nervous, and Pitcher Kono allowed
Bell to take first base on four balls.
Dudley tried to bunt, but knocked
a fly into Kono's hands. Bell then
tried to steal second, but Yama
waki, the catcher, threw accurately
and Bell was out at the base. Fen
ton struck out, and it looked as
though Waseda was strong on the
defensive. At their turn at bat

they were put out in one-two-three
order, but each man hit the ball,
and every time it went toward
right field, showing that they were
not used to a pitcher with speed.
The Japanese kept up their good
fielding in the second inning, allow
ing only one player to get to first
base.
In the last half of the second
inning Waseda succeeded in getting
one run, the team's only score of
the game. Captain Hashido, the
first man at bat, hit to Trowbridge,
who threw wild to first, allowing
the runner to reach first safely. A
minute later he went to second 011
a wild pitch by Sales. KOllO
knocked a hit over second and
Hashido reached the home plate.
The next three players were put
out in rapid succession, retiring the
side.
Stanford scored three times in
the third inning. With one out
Stott got a base on balls and ad
vanced to third on Presley's hit,
Presley meanwhile stealing second.
The Japanese team was in a hard
position,and they became "rattled"
when Dudley bunted. Kono got
the ball and threw it to first base,
but the player was off the bag and
the ball went into the crowd, allow
ing Stott to score. Fenton hit to
short, who threw to the catcher to
prevent Bell from scoring. Bell
had passed third base, and to catch
him at that bag Yamawaki threw
to the baseman. The throw was
too high and the ball went out into
the field, both Bell and Dudley
scoring.
Stanford did not score again in
this inning, but easily added six
more during the remainder of the

game. These runs were partly the
result of errors made by Waseda on
account of nervousness, with the
exception of one which was the re
sult of a single by Colbert and a
three-bagger by Stott. Waseda
came near getting another run in
