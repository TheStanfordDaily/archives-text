# STANFORD WINS DEBATE.
## Cardinal Team Gains Unanimous Decision Over Nevada.—Received Many Courtesies. 
### 
The debating team consisting of
W. L. Blair, '06, C. S. Osgood, '06,
and A. M. Dibble, '05, with E. A.
Cunha, '06, as alternate, which de
feated the representatives of the
University of Nevada at Reno Sat
urday night, has returned to the
campus with glowing accounts of
the hospitality of the Nevadans.
The debaters left San Francisco
Friday afternoon and reached their
destination Saturday morning.
They were met at the train by Ne
vada representatives and driven to
the Riverside Hotel. The day was
spent in sightseeing and in the eve
ning the debate was held in the
university gymnasium before a
large audience of students and
townspeople, who were warm in
their applause.
The subject was: "Resolved, That
laws relating to marriage and di
vorce should be uniform through
out the United States, and that for
that purpose Congress „ should, by
constitutional amendment, be given
power to pass such laws."
Stanford upheld the affirmative.
Blair opened the argument and de
voted his time to showing that
there are many evils arising out of
the present divorce system which
result from the lack of uniformity
in divorce laws. Osgood, follow
ing, argued that the federal courts
could better enforce the law than
local courts. Dibble, in closing,
declared thatconstitutional amend
ment is the only way by which
such a law could be passed, and

that such action would in no way
infringe on States' rights.
D. M. McDonald, L. Goldstein,
and J. D. Scott spoke for Nevada
in the order named. Their argu
ments were that the evils were not
as great as pictured; that the general
law proposed would be impractic
able and ineffective because of
widely differing conditions in vari
ous sections of the country; and
lastly, that a uniform law would
not remedy the evils, but would be
more in the nature of a compromise.
The judges, E. S. Farrington of
Reno, Judge A. E. Cheney, and
Judge Downer of Colorado, ren
dered a unanimous decision for
the affirmative. Dr. S. W. Cush
man of the Nevada faculty pre
sided.
After the debate the Stanford
men were entertained in the gym
nasium at an informal reception
and dance. The Nevadans look
forward to the return debate at
Stanford next year and declare
their intention of sending down a
strong team.
