# ENGLISH PLAY REPEATED.
## Saturday Performance of "Every Man in his Humour" More Warmly Received. 
### 
The second performance of "Every
Man in his Humour" took place in
the Assembly Hall Saturday morn
ing, beginning at 10:30. The per
formance found the actors in better
form than last Thursday night,
and more able to do justice to
themselves before an appreci
ative audience. A large number
of people from San Francisco and
San Jose witnessed the play. Sev
eral of the actors who made hits
last Thursday night outdid them
selves in the second performance of
the play, and others, more accus
tomed to their difficult roles, gave
more adequate interpretation of
them. Throughout, the perform
ance had more life than on the
first night. The length of the per
formance was made lees noticeable
by this, as well as by the omission
of some of the shorter and unim
portant scenes of the fourth act.
J. K. Bonnell, as Bobadil; I\ C.
Edwards, as Cob; L. W. Cutler,
as Master Mathew, and R. G. Bar
nett, as Kitely, divided honors,
each doing entire justice to ex
tremely exacting and difficult parts.
"Every Man in his Humour" is
to be given at Berkeley next Sat
urday morning at 10:30 in the
Greek amphitheater. No attempt
will be made to take the English
Club's Elizabethan stage with the
company. The English Club will
present the play to the Berkeley
audience under the auspices of the
University of California entertain
ment committee.
