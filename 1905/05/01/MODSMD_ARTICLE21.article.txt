# VICTORY FOR STANFORD GIRLS.
## Cardinal Players Win the Second Game of the Intercollegiate Basket-ball Series. 
### 
Stanford won the second game of
the intercollegiate basket-ball ser
ies Saturday afternoon, defeating
the California girls by the score of
10 to 8. An interested and en
thusiastic crowd witnessed the
game, which was so fast that at
the close of the second half the
players were exhausted.
The Stanford guards had studied
carefully the way to handle Cali
fornia's long pass, which proved so
effective a week ago and resulted
in the California victory. The
guards played a splendid game
throughout, weakenig only in the
last five minutes, but then long
enough to allow California's for
wards to score two goals, this rais
ing the score from four to eight.
This sudden rally was followed by
a corresponding brace on the part
of the Stanford players, who al
lowed their opponents to score no
more.
The superior team-work of Stan
ford was in evidence above the
work of any one player from the
outset, and it is to this that Stan
ford owed her victory. The work
of Miss Huiskamp, '06, as guard,
and of Miss Jane Spalding, '06, in
throwing goals from the foul line,
were the features of the day. To
Miss Spalding six of Stanford's ten
points are due. On the California
team the work of Captain Atkin
son Was by far the best. Owing to
the rush of final examinations,
which begin to-day at California,
it has been impossible to arrange
a third game, and thus the ques
tion of the championship remains
unsettled, as it did last year, each
side having won one of the games
of the series.
