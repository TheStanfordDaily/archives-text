# PROFESSOR ABE LECTURES.
## Waseda Manager Tells of the Growth of the Athletic Spirit in Japan. 
### 
Professor Iso Abe of Waseda
University lectured Friday even
ing in the University chapel on
present - day athletics in Japan.
Mr. Abe spoke especially with
reference to the trip of the Waseda
team and its aims and purposes.
He said in part:
"Ten years ago intercollegiate
athletics were unknown in Japan.
The various clubs and schools
would hold wrestling tournaments
and broad-sword contests, hut
there were no other athletic events
of any kind. To-day there are
four colleges in Japan each having
a strong baseball team, to say noth
ing of numerous athletic clubs and
high school teams. Baseball is
enormously popular and is fast be
coming the national game of Japan,
if we may call a game national
which we have adopted from an
other country.
"To be sure, we have no football
games, except Rugby, which is
played a little; but tennis has
gained a strong foothold, and
track is coming gradually into
prominence. We have no inter
collegiate meets, but each of the
several colleges at Waseda has its
track team and holds frequent
meets.
"When I went to Count Okuma
six years ago and told him of my
wish to take a baseball team to
America, he laughed at me and
told me that we must first have a
team that would win the champion
ship of Japan. It took four long
years to develop our team, but I
believe that it has been worth the
trouble, and that the experience of
this trip alone will amply repay
us. We are not here to win games,
but to learn to play baseball as it
is played in America. And it is
not in baseball only that this trip
should be a help to our men. It
will broaden their views and help
them to a better understanding of
the world, and I expect they will
gain from it far more than they
put into it."
