# FAMOUS POET TO TALK.
## Joaquin Miller Will Lecture Before the English Club Wednesday Evening. 
### 
Joaquin Miller, the famous Cali
fornia poet, whose works have
gained him recognition abroad as
the greatest poet that the West has
produced, is to be at Stanford dur
ing the present week, and will
speak before the English Club
Wednesday evening. It has not
yet been decided whether Mr. Miller
will deliver any other addresses
during his stay at the university.
The subject of his talk Wednesday
evening will deal with the educa
tional problem in China.
The meeting of the English Club
will take place Wednesday evening
at 8 o'clock at the Kappa Alpha
Theta house. Owing to the general
interest in the speaker of the even
ing it is expected that a large num
ber of members will desire to bring
their friends, and in order that
arrangements can be made to
accommodate them it is desirable
that all members intending to do
this should notify a member of the
executive committee beforehand. A
meeting of the executive committee
will be held at 7:40, as this is the
last regular meeting of the club for
the year; officers will be elected
for next semester preceding the
regular program of the evening.
