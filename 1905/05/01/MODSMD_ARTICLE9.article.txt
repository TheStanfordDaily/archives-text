pears to be no general movement
on foot, I have taken the liberty of
initiating such a movement on the
part of this congregation. Accord
ingly I called together certain
representative members of the

Mrs. JBranner, representing the
faculty, and Mr. Hugh Moran, Mr.
\V. H. B. Fowler, Mr. Dudley Sales,

imously resolved that a memorial
fund be started for the purpose of
placing a memorial in the univer
sity church. The form of the
memorial will be decided by the
committee according to the contri
butions received. Suggestions as
to the form will he welcomed.
"Contributions to the memorial
fund may be made through envel
opes to he obtained at the church,
postottice, and Registrar's office, on
the campus, and at Mr. Simians'
store in Palo Alto. The envelopes
may be returned at the church
services on May 7th and 14th, or
by post to the treasurer of the fund,
Mrs. Branner, on the campus.
"It is not the intention of the
committee to confine the memorial
to the members of the congregation.
All members of the university and
residents in the community are
asked to join."
Mr. Gardner, or any member of
the committee, will gladly give in
formation on the subject. There
