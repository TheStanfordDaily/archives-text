### 
A telegram received at the presi
dent's office to-day announces the
award of a prize of one thousand
dollars to Miss Nettie M. Stevens,
Stanford '99, for a scientific thesis
written by her, the money to be
expended in original research work
in zoology at Naples. This prize
is offered every two years by the
organization officially known as the
"Association for Maintaining the
American Women's Table at the
Zoological Station at Naples and
for Promoting Scientific Research
by Women." The circumstances
leading; up to the foundation of this
association and later the offer of
this biennial prize are as follows:
In 1872, Professor Anton Dohrn
founded at Naples a station for the
collection of biological material
and for the study of varied forms
of plant and animal life. In 1897,
twenty-five years after its founda
tion, it occurred to Miss Ida H.
Hyde, an American woman who
had been a student at the station,
that it would be fitting for those
interested in the scientific training
of women to establish a table for
research at Naples, to be main
tained for the benefit of any quali
fied American women who should
desire to avail themselves of its
opportunities. Miss Hyde secured
the co-operation of many prominent
American women, and in 1898 the
association named above was
formed.
The object of the association at
first was to award the table each
year to a capable American woman
student in zoology. Under this
arrrangement Miss Stevens waß
awarded the table for 1901—02.
At this time the association had
secured such financial strength that
it was able to announce a research
prize of one thousand dollars for
the best thesis on a scientific sub
ject embodying independent labor
atory research, such thesiß to be
presented by a woman to the ex
ecutive committee of the associ
ation within two years after the
date of announcement and to be
judged by a board of specialists.
This is the prize which has just
been awarded to Miss Stevens, mak
ing the second honor bestowed upon
her by the association. .
Miss Stevens took her bachelor's
degree at Stanford in 1899, and
her master's degree a year later.
In 1900 and 1901 she held a schol
arship in Bryn Mawr College, and
was awarded a European fellow
ship from there for the next year.
While in Europe she studied in the
University of Wurzburg, Germany,
and also at the Naples Zoological
Station under the first award. The
year 1902-03 was spent at Bryn
Mawr upon a second fellowship in
zoology. Miss Stevens took her
doctorate at Bryn Mawr in 1903
and continued as a graduate stu
dent there until 1905, at the same
time acting as a reader and Car
negie research assistant in experi
mental morphology. Miss Stevens
is the author of many papers on
phvsiological and other scientific
subjects.
