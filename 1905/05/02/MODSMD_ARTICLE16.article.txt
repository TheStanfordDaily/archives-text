drawings of memorial subjects, and
a full-page picture of Mrs. Stanford
make up the art work of the me

department the editors felt that the

that Stanford athletics have never
seen a more prosperous year.
No notable change has been
made in the department devoted to
the debating interests. Dramatics
are treated in a form new to the
junior book. The history of the
stage during the past year is told

Liberal Supply of "Joshes."
The "josh " department has been
restored to the size and character it
had in the old days. Verse and
fraternity "statistics" form the
principal features, and the editors
have been liberal in their estimates
of what contributions to the de
partment should be printed. The
comic art work is unique and
original. As a whole the "josh"
department promises to be the most
interesting feature of the Quad.

the gate.
The title page is done in three

colors, with a eucalyptus design.
It is the same as the poster which
announces tlie sale of the Quad on
Thursday morning. Following the
title-page is the foreword, the con
tents page, and an article by Dr.
Jordan.
Special Memorial Features.
A special feature of the annual is
the memorial department, which
is given up to a memorial of the
late Mrs. Stanford. Here the last
authoritative words of Mrs. Stan
ford regarding the university are
given, and the final appreciation of
her work by Dr. Jordan perma
nently preserved. Two appropriate
poems, one a sonnet expressive of
the sentiments aroused by the re
ceipt of the news of Mrs. Stanford's
death, the other typical of the idea
that the Stanford spirit lives on
although its originators have gone,
are printed. Several full-page
drawings of memorial subjects, and
a full-page picture of Mrs. Stanford
make up the art work of the me
morial. A letter is published which
was received by Charles G. Lathrop
from Mrs. Stanford, which is
prophetic of her own death, and
expressive of her noble aims in
life.
The list of faculty members,
graduate students, seniors, and
juniors, is given as usual. The
class history is a unique produc
tion, and is followed by the pictures
of the juniors. The remaining class
statistics are given as usual. This
year fraternity pictures are pub
lished again, along with the usual
statistics. Sigma Xi and Phi Beta
Kappa, the honor societies, are in
cluded.
Under the head of organizations

the various departments of student
activities are given full notice.
Athletic Department Enlarged.
The athletic department is larger
than in past Quads, and is arranged
with attention to logical order.
Many unique photographs are pub
lished, particularly of track and
football men and events. Tennis
is given greater notice than in
former years. In enlarging this
department the editors felt that the
increase was warranted by the fact
that Stanford athletics have never
seen a more prosperous year.
No notable change has been
made in the department devoted to
the debating interests. Dramatics
are treated in a form new to the
junior book. The history of the
stage during the past year is told
in a colloquial story, illustrated by
cuts inserted in the text.
Many Special Articles.
In the literary department the
prize poem and story are published,
and several special articles of in
terest. In this section of the book
Dr. F\ Angell contributes an article
on "The New Athletic Fields," giv
ing the plans in detail, and these
are illustrated with maps and cuts.
*'A Plea for the Open Game" is the
subject of an article on football by
J. F. Lanagan, '00. ProfessorS. S.
Seward wr.ites on Phi Beta Kappa
at Stanford. Among other special
articles is one by Dr. Jordan en
titled '' University Ideals," in which
the ideals sought by Mrs. Stanford
in founding the university are set
forth. Dr. B. C. Blodgett con
tributes an article on music as a
university study. The early strug
gles of the Daily Palo Alto are
described by Archie Rice, '95.

Liberal Supply of "Joshes."
The "josh " department has been
restored to the size and character it
had in the old days. Verse and
fraternity "statistics" form the
principal features, and the editors
have been liberal in their estimates
of what contributions to the de
partment should be printed. The
comic art work is unique and
original. As a whole the "josh"
department promises to be the most
interesting feature of the Quad.
The 1906 Quad will be on sale on
the inner quadrangle at 8 o'clock
Thursday morning. The indica
tions are that the demand for the
Junior annual will he unusually
large this year, while the edition
has heen limited to prevent the
possibility of any copies of the book
being left over.
In order to accommodate the pur
chasers of the Quad on Thursday
morning a general plan of distri
bution has been formulated. The
sale will take place on the inner
quadrangle. Purchasers are to
gather in four rows, as follows:
Two rows for general purchasers,
one for juniors, and the fourth for
those persons who have paid for the
book in advance and have their
names printed on the cover.
Juniors will be required to call for
their Quads in person, or send a
written order. No limit has been
placed on the number of books
which may he purchased by each
person, except that a Junior may
buy only one copy at the Junior
price of $1.50. The general sub
scription price is $2.50.
The edition consists of 432 pages,
and is bound in red cloth. The
front cover is without lettering,
having on it nothing but the cover
design, a drawing of the new gate
at the entrance to the university
grounds stamped in gold impres
sion. Inside the front cover is a
beautiful full-page photograph of
the gate.
The title page is done in three

colors, with a eucalyptus design.
It is the same as the poster which
announces tlie sale of the Quad on

tents page, and an article by Dr.
