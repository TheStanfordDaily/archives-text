# CHANGE IN FOOTBALL RULES.
## Forward Pass Will Probably Be Used as Means of Making Game More Open. 
### 
According to a recent issue of the
New York Evening Post, the forward
pass is to be allowed in football
next year. This change in the
rules was made by the intercol
legiate committee on football rules,
of which Camp of Yale, Wrenn of
of Harvard, Dennis of Cornell, and
Dashiell of Annapolis are mem
bers. The forward pass is to be al
lowed with the expectation that it
will result in making football more
open than it now is.
It in understood that Wrenn is
the only member who strongly ad
vocated the change. lie stated
that unless the present rules were
very essentially modified, Harvard
would probably have to withdraw
from intercollegiate football games
because of President Eliot's objec
tion to the present form of the game.
The new measure is an extreme
ly radical one, contrary to the
essential rule of the Rugby game,
which has always had as its dis
tinctive feature the non-allowance
of the forward pass. The inter
collegiate game of to-day is a
development of the old Rugby
football as differentiated from the
kicking and running form of the
game, now known as Association
football. Just how permanent the
change is cannot be known as yet,
but it is clear that the present
agitation in favor of the open game
must result in new measures in
the rules for next year.
A preliminary meeting of the
intercollegiate football rules com

mittee in New York early last
month was confronted with a great
mass of opinions from all over the
country. At the May meeting it is
expected that further radical
changes will be made. Regarding
the proposed measures for opening
up the game, the Cornell Daily Sun,
speaking of the recent meeting of
the rules committee, speaks as fol
lows:
"It has been known pretty gen
erally that it would be officially
suggested that the distance to be
gained in three tries be increased,
with a view to encouraging open
play; but while there were those in
favor of this plan at the committee
meeting, there were other members
of the committee who were opposed
to any 6uch plan on the ground
that it would defeat its own object
unless adopted in connection with
other changes in the rules. And
on this last named subject the
most interesting suggestions yet
made concerning changes in the
rule were presented for the consid
eration of the committee.
"Several members of the com
mittee had sensible suggestions for
the handicapping of the defence,
declaring that this was the only
practical way to bring about the
desired end runs and other plays
calculated to make close formations
less frequent. Increasing the dis
tance to be gained, they pointed
out, would not in itself help mat
ters any, with the defensive side of
the game remaining so strong. A
representative of a big university
on the committee made the sugges
tion that only five men be allowed
to remain on the line of defence.
"This would mean that two line

men, the ends probably, would
have to play back on the defence,
as well as of all the backs, and, it
is plain, would make end runs
more frequent by placing restric
tions on the players who have been
most active in spoiling end runs.
It was further suggested that of
those men playing back of the line
on the defence none be allowed to
be nearer than two yards to the line.
"Some members of the committee
were opposed to weakening the
defence at all. As to increasing
the distance to be gained, some
wanted ten yards and some thought
seven yards would be better. There
were suggestions, too, that the of
fensive backs be required to stand
at least four yards behind the line.
Among the disadvantages to this
suggestion is the fact that it would
be in the power of the defence to
delay the game by not getting into
position.
"The many and varied sugges
tions all seem to point toward one
end, — the making of a more open
game; a.nd|to accomplish this the
opinion in favor of lengthening the
distance to be gained in three
downs seems to be unanimous. If
the distance to be gained is in
creased and at the same time the
defence not weakened, the game
must necessarily develop into a
punting contest between individuals
and in the development of men to
catch punts.
"If the distance to be gained is
increased and at the same time the
defence weakened, the object in
view may be attained. In order to
do this the defence must be opened
up and spread of more territory.
"Another suggestion that will

affect the plan in an indirect way
is that of having no restrictions as
to formation for the defence, hut to
make the ball nobody's properly
after a punt. At present only
those of the offence behind the ball
when it is kicked are allowed to
secure it before it is touched by the
defence. This plan would force
the defence to spread out to practi
cally the same extent as the direct
rules of restricting the secondary
defence and allowing only five men
on the lines as mentioned above,
thus necessitating the more open
game for which the public is
clamoring."

up the game, the Cornell Daily Sun,
speaking of the recent meeting of
the rules committee, speaks as fol
lows:
"It has been known pretty gen
erally that it would be officially
suggested that the distance to be
gained in three tries be increased,
with a view to encouraging open
play; but while there were those in
favor of this plan at the committee
meeting, there were other members
of the committee who were opposed
to any 6uch plan on the ground
that it would defeat its own object
unless adopted in connection with
other changes in the rules. And
on this last named subject the
most interesting suggestions yet
made concerning changes in the
rule were presented for the consid
eration of the committee.
"Several members of the com
mittee had sensible suggestions for
the handicapping of the defence,
declaring that this was the only
practical way to bring about the
desired end runs and other plays
calculated to make close formations
less frequent. Increasing the dis
tance to be gained, they pointed
out, would not in itself help mat
ters any, with the defensive side of
the game remaining so strong. A
representative of a big university
on the committee made the sugges
tion that only five men be allowed
to remain on the line of defence.
"This would mean that two line

men, the ends probably, would
have to play back on the defence,
as well as of all the backs, and, it
is plain, would make end runs
more frequent by placing restric
tions on the players who have been
most active in spoiling end runs.
It was further suggested that of
those men playing back of the line
on the defence none be allowed to
be nearer than two yards to the line.
"Some members of the committee
were opposed to weakening the
defence at all. As to increasing
the distance to be gained, some
wanted ten yards and some thought
seven yards would be better. There
were suggestions, too, that the of
fensive backs be required to stand
at least four yards behind the line.
Among the disadvantages to this
suggestion is the fact that it would
be in the power of the defence to
delay the game by not getting into
position.
"The many and varied sugges
tions all seem to point toward one
end, — the making of a more open
game; a.nd|to accomplish this the
opinion in favor of lengthening the
distance to be gained in three
downs seems to be unanimous. If
the distance to be gained is in
creased and at the same time the
defence not weakened, the game
must necessarily develop into a
punting contest between individuals
and in the development of men to
catch punts.
"If the distance to be gained is
increased and at the same time the
defence weakened, the object in
view may be attained. In order to
do this the defence must be opened
up and spread of more territory.
"Another suggestion that will

affect the plan in an indirect way
is that of having no restrictions as
to formation for the defence, hut to
make the ball nobody's properly
after a punt. At present only
those of the offence behind the ball
when it is kicked are allowed to
secure it before it is touched by the
defence. This plan would force
the defence to spread out to practi
cally the same extent as the direct
rules of restricting the secondary
defence and allowing only five men
on the lines as mentioned above,
thus necessitating the more open
game for which the public is
clamoring."
According to a recent issue of the
New York Evening Post, the forward
pass is to be allowed in football
next year. This change in the
rules was made by the intercol
legiate committee on football rules,
of which Camp of Yale, Wrenn of
of Harvard, Dennis of Cornell, and
Dashiell of Annapolis are mem
bers. The forward pass is to be al
lowed with the expectation that it
will result in making football more
open than it now is.
It in understood that Wrenn is
the only member who strongly ad
vocated the change. lie stated
that unless the present rules were
very essentially modified, Harvard
would probably have to withdraw
from intercollegiate football games
because of President Eliot's objec
tion to the present form of the game.
The new measure is an extreme
ly radical one, contrary to the
essential rule of the Rugby game,
which has always had as its dis
tinctive feature the non-allowance
of the forward pass. The inter
collegiate game of to-day is a
development of the old Rugby
football as differentiated from the
kicking and running form of the
game, now known as Association
football. Just how permanent the
change is cannot be known as yet,
but it is clear that the present
agitation in favor of the open game
must result in new measures in
the rules for next year.
A preliminary meeting of the
intercollegiate football rules com

mittee in New York early last
month was confronted with a great
mass of opinions from all over the
country. At the May meeting it is
expected that further radical
changes will be made. Regarding
the proposed measures for opening
up the game, the Cornell Daily Sun,
