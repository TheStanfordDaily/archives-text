# NEW SUBDIVISION PLANNED.
## Thirty-eight Acres of University Land to Be Thrown Open for Residence Sites. 
### 
A new subdivision of university
property is being made which will
throw open for residence purposes
some thirty-eight acres of land ad
jacent to the Mayfield and Sears
ville road. The new subdivision is
situated east of the Cooksey place
and on both sides of the county
road. About sixty lots in all will
be staked out, and each lot will
average about 130 feet frontage by
150 feet in depth. The foothills
distinguished by their crown of
pines are to be cut in acreage prop
erty, each lot containing from one
to three acres. This portion of the
subdivision will be used for resi
dence sites. Professor W. F. Du
rand of the Mechanical Engineer
ing department is making arrange
ments to secure one of the most de
sirable of these larger lots and
plans to erect a handsome resi
dence there next fall. The site
that Professor Durand has selected
is a two-acre lot situated about
200 feet east of the easterly line of
the old Coutts place, on a sloping
sidehill overlooking the university
buildings.
The laying out of the new resi
dence grounds will necessitate the
continuation of both Alvarado row
and Salvatierra street in an easter
ly direction about 1100 feet. The
two twenty-foot alleys now running
parallel to these streets will be ex
tended in a like manner. The roads
as they will be extended will run
parallel to the county road, pass
through the new subdivision on
the north, and join the old ranch
road leading to the former Coutts
place. On the south side of the
county road fifty-foot streets will
be constructed to run through and
divide the subdivision. Alvarado
row and Salvatierra street will be
continued in the same width as
they now stand. The work of lay
ing out the subdivision is in charge
of Surveyor Curtis M. Barker, who
for seven years was asssistant engi
neer of construction at Stanford
University.
The Business Office has not yet
announced the policy it will pur
sue in leasing the new grounds for
residence property, but it is be
lieved the same conditions will ap
ply as in the leasing of the present
university residence property. The
laying out of the new subdivision
will be completed before the uni
versity opens next semester.
