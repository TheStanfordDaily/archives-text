# MECHANICIAN IS APPOINTED.
## F.A. Stevens of Cornell Accepts Call as Foreman of New Department. 
### 
F. A. Stevens has been appointed
foreman mechanician of a new
department of the Machine Shop
devoted to making apparatus and
instruments for the laboratories.
Stevens is a mechanic of many
years' experience, having held a
similar position at Cornell for a
number of years.
This appointment by the Board
of Trustees marks definitely a
policy of establishing a department
for the maintenance and construc
tion of equipment for all depart
ments of the university. This work
will be in charge of the department
of Mechanical Engineering, but the
purpose is to have it minister to
the needs of all parts of the univer
sity, either in the construction of
new equipment, making of special
designs, or repairing of existing
apparatus.
Other appointments on this staff
may be made as the needs arise.
