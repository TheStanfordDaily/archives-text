# NEW COURSES IN LAW.
## Announcement of the Department Schedule for the Next Year Made To-day. 
### 
A number of Law courses not
given this year are announced by
the Law department for the year
beginning next August. The pro
posed schedule for 1905-06 was
posted to-day, and includes six
courses not given this year. The
new courses are California Practice,
Pleading, Persons, and Sales,
Equity, and Conflict of Laws.
Instructor Ballantine will give
the course on California Practice,
which is based on the Code of Civil
Procedure. The absence of this
course from the schedule of law
courses in the past years has work
ed considerable hardship on the
graduates of the Law department.
Dr. Abbott has opposed admitting
graduates to the bar on motion
partly because they have not had
this course. Equity and Conflict
of Laws will also be given by
Instructor Ballantine.
The courses on Persons during
the first semester, and Sales during
the second semester, will be given
by Professor Dennis.
Instructor Cathcart will give the
course on Pleading. The course
on Trusts, not given for the past
two years, will be given by Profes
sor Lewers.
There is a possibility that Dr.
Abbott will give a course on Bills
and Notes instead of Property II
on Tuesdays and Thursdays at
11:15. This announcement will
be made later.
