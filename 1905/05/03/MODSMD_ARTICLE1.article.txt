# CHESS CLUB ELECTS OFFICERS.
## Plans Made for Work of the Ensuing Year.â€”Prospects Considered Bright. 
### 
The Chess Club held its annual
business meeting at the Delta Tau
Delta house last night. H. W.
Strong, '06, was chosen president
for next year, and A. R. Mac Swain,
'08, was elected vice-president and
treasurer. The executive commit
tee, which will act in conjunction
with the president and vice-pres
ident, is as follows: R. A. Fuller,
'05, M. M. Stearns, '06, and G. E.
Dole, '07. All of the newly elected
officers where members of the inter
collegiate chess team with the ex
ception of Mac Swain.
The chief result of the meeting
was the amendment of the consti
tution and by-laws of the club.
Almost the whole of the constitu
tion was altered, chiefly in respect
to the playing of tournaments and
membership in the club. Hereafter
but one game will be played be
tween persons trying either for the
club or for the intercollegiate team.
Further arrangements as to the
selection of the team were left to
the discretion of the executive com
mittee. The Chess Club is limited
to a membership of fourteen, seven
of whom are selected as the chess
team. In trying out for the team
the players will hereafter be re
quired to have all preliminary
games completed at least a month
before the date of the intercollegiate
match.
A new rule was made to the
effect that a club member who
makes the intercollegiate chess
team is not required to try out for
his membership in the club again.
These changes will not be qualified
as laws of the club for two weeks,
when ex-President 11. A. Fuller, '05,
will cast a ballot, as authorized
by the club in the meeting last
night.
The men who played on the chess
team against California this year
were given their pins last night.
The following men received the
emblem: F. P. Whitaker,'os, R. A.
Fuller, '05, E. W. Doane, '05, M.
M. Stearns, '06, H. W. Strong, '06,
G. E. Dole, '07,and L. Newland, '08.
The outlook for a good chess
team next year is very bright. All
the men who played on the team
this year expect to return to college
except Whitaker and probably
Doane, and there are several good
players now in the club who will
he able to take their places very
acceptably. At the meeting last
night means were discussed for
making the intercollegiate match
more decisive, since in the past two
years the matches have resulted in
a tie. At present the only thing
which can he done toward that end
is to divide the players on each
team into classes, so that each man
plays an opponent as near his
equal as possible. Under the pres
ent system a fine player is apt to
meet a novice, and the result is an
unsatisfactory game.
