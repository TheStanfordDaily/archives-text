# Dr. Andrews on College Fraternities.

Chancellor E. Benjamin Andrews,
in a summary of the year at the
University of Nebraska, discussed
Greek-letter societies : "Students'
social affairs have a strong bearing
on a university's welfare. Greek
letter societies have become part of
the United States university sys
tem ; yet considerable abuses, which
it is most difficult to reach, occur
in connection with them. Mem
bership in these organizations often
adds painfully to student expenses.
Parents should remember that such
membership is in no sense neces
sary or required, students'scholar
ship, reputation, standing and in
fluence being quite independent of
the question whether they join
these bodies or not. The convic
tion is spreading that fraternity
initiations should be supervised
and that pledging should be post
poned until the student in name
lias demonstrated his purpose to be
a student in fact."
