The winning of an important
scientific prize by a Stanford woman
graduate, announced yesterday,and
followed by the news of the appoint
ment of another Stanford graduate
to the house staff of one of the most
important hospitals of New York ?
serves to call attention to the great
success that is being won by many
of the men and women who have
received their early training in the
Physiology department of this uni
versity. It was not long ago that
three Stanford men found phices
among the first ten names on the
honor list of the Johns Hopkins
University Medical School, and it
is rare that a month passes by that
does not bring back news of some
good work that has been done by a
graduate of the Stanford Physiology
department. It is a fine tribute to
the efficiency of the department and
to the ability of its teaching staff.
