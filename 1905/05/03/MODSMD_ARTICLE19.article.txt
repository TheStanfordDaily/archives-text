I'erhaps no feature of the col
lege year which is now almost at
an end has been more pleasing
than the wide extension of our cor
dial relations with other univer
sities. For several years we have
met the representatives of the Uni
versity of Nevada on the gridiron
and found them worthy opponents.
This year for the first time an
intercollegiate debate was held be
tween the two universities, and its
success indicates that the meeting
on the rostrum will become an an
nual affair. The rowing men from
the University of Washington
proved themselves most courteous
and generous opponents, and it is
to be hoped that our athletic rela
tions with the northern institution
have become firmly established.
The series of baseball games with
Waseda University of Tokio, Japan,
has caused international intercol
legiate athletics to become an estab
lished fact. The Japanese readily
adapt themselves to foreign cus-

Toms, and undoubtedly it will not
be long before they will prove
themselves formidable rivals in the
game to which America gave birth.
