# TO STUDY PLANT DISEASES.
## Laboratory and Experimental Station to Be Established in the South. 
### 
A laboratory and experimental
station for the study of plant dis
eases is to be established at once in
Southern California through finan
cial support furnished by the State
that the work may be undertaken
by the University of California as
a part of the activities of its depart
ment of agriculture.
The State Commission for the se
lection of a location for the patho
logical laboratory and experiment
station, a board consisting of George
C. Pardee, Governor of California,
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the University of California, and
Professor E. J. Wickson of the chair
of agricultural practice in the Uni
versity of California, is now ready
to receive proposals in regard to a
site. It is expressly set forth in the
bill providing for this work that
lands already belonging to the
State at Whittier or at Patton may
be used if the commission so decides.
Should other communities in South
ern California, however, make offers
particularly advantageous in char
acter, the commission will entertain
such proposals.
The appropriation made by the
last Legislature provides that the
'pathological laboratory shall be
equipped with buildings, material,
and appliances necessary for the
study and determination of the
cause of diseases and the conditions
of orchard trees, fruits, and vegeta
bles. It shall provide the means
for a thorough examination of fun
gus, bacterial, and other maladies;

insects, pests, and diseases, and
their remedy or prevention; the
condition of the soil, cultivation
and location that may tend to im
perfect nutrition, and all physio
logical and other defects that may
affect the economic production and
marketing of horticultural products.
The pathological laboratory must be
located in one of the seven southern
counties of the State.
The Regents of the University of
California are directed to select not
less than two experts in plant path
ology, and such assistants as may
be needed. These men are to have
active charge of the laboratory and
of the investigations and field ex
periments. They must reside at or
near the laboratory,and devote their
entire time to the investigations re
quired by the Regents. The results
of their work are to be published
from time to time. Their salaries
are to he fixed by the Regents.
The State Commission is to select
a location also which may be on
the same lands as the pathological
laboratory,or elsewhere,if preferred,
for a branch agricultural station,or
stations, to carry on experimental
investigations in connection with
the other agricultural work of the
University of California to ascertain
the best methods of agricultural
management; for the investigation
of fertilization, of irrigation, of im
proved methods of handling fruits
for market, for the introduction of
new varieties of fruits, and for such
other investigations as may be
deemed advisable to promote the
horticultural interests of Southern
California.
The Regents are required to adopt
a general plan and schedule before

the beginning of each fiscal year
which shall describe the investiga
tions and experiments to be pur
sued during the year, and it is to
be the duty of the Regents to re
ceive and consider written state
ments from individuals and asso
ciations in various branches of
horticulture, conveying plans or
suggestions which they may ap
prove or desire.
