# BOATING MEN HARD AT WORK
## Crew in Their New Quarters at Redwood.â€”Bright Prospects for Next Year. 
### 
For the past month the boating
men have been working steadily in
their new quarters at Redwood.
While the attention of all the col
lege was drawn to the various inter
collegiate contests with the Univer
sity of California,the men who hope
to wear the Cardinal colors in the
big regatta at Seattle have been
practicing daily.
For some time both crews have
rowed every day at Redwood. The
course on Lagunita has been aban
doned in order to give the men
practice on a long distance straight
away.
The squad has been reduced to
twelve men. These men leave the
campus about 4 o'clock every day
and return about 7 o'clock. The
only event which has broken the
monotony of the hard training was
the regatta with Washington,which
the Varsity lost by a length.
Both crews have been somewhat
handicapped by the fact that this
and the interclass regatta are the
only contests which the club has
been able to pull off. This defect,
however, bids fair to be remedied
next year. 11. G. Butterfield, presi
dent of the Boat Club, is in receipt
of several letters from southern col
leges and clubs asking for regattas
next year. St, Vincent's College,
Los Angeles, will have a crew, and
is anxious to meet the Cardinal.
The Young Men's Christian Associa
tion of San Diego has also asked
to compete next year with Stanford.
The possibility of securing these

contests, and the fact that but one
man of the squad graduates, makes
the outlook very bright.
At present the Boat Club has a
debt of about $700. The shell, new
boat-house, a set of new oars, and
the expenses of the regattas with
Washington have brought it up to
this figure. However, according to
an agreement with the English Club,
the Boat Club will receive one-half
of the net receipts from "Every Man
in his Humour."
