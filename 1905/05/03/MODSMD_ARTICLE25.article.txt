# RULES TO GOVERN "RUSHING."
## Regulations Adopted by the Pan-Hellenic Association of Boston University. 
### 
A pamphlet has recently been
published containing the constitu
tion and by-laws of the Pan-Hellen
ic Association of Boston Univer
sity. This Pai -Hellenic Associa
tion is much the same to the
fraternity girls as Gamma Delta is
to the non-fraternity young women,
and the term "association" is pal
pably a misnomer, for, although
the girls are supposed to be acting
under a certain plan of procedure,
says the Boston Evening Transcript,
fraternity rivalry is as strong as
ever and the links which bind the
different bodies together are fragile
as those which held the stars in
our flag during the memorable
period. This fact caused the for
mer Pan-Hellenic Association Undis
solve. But the plan has been
revived. Its virtues are clearly
those of wiser choice on the
parts of both freshman and frater
nity.
The constitution proper is of no
great importance, but the by-laws

are of intereet. Several are given
below:
1 — Pledge day shall be the first
Monday in November.
2 —lnvitations to membership
shall be written. They shall be
mailed the Friday preceding pledge
day.
3 — No rushing of any kind shall
take place between invitation day
and pledge day.
4 —No rushing of any kind shall
be done before registration day.
5 — No fraternity shall engage a
girl for the lunch hour or for any
rushing party on two days in
succession.
6 — No fraternity shall make
dates for the following week. Satur
day invitations shall be written.
7 —No mention of fraternity.shall
be made previous to pledge day.
B—A8 —A circular containing a state
ment of the Pan-Hellenic agree
ment, and necessary information
concerning each fraternity, shall be
given to each entering girl on
registration day.
9—Any fraternity bringing ac
cusations of transgression of rules
shall present the same in writing
to the secretary of the association;
and the association shall act upon
it at the delegates' discretion.
10 —A motion may be carried by
votes of four out of five delegates.
Certain fraternity data concern
ing the young women's clubs at
Boston University are given out to
each girl in the entering class. In
