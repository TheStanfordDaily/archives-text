A number of professors from the
University of California English
faculty witnessed the performance
of "Every Man in his Humour"
last Saturday at Stanford, and
were highly pleased with the way
it was given. As a result of this,
and remembering the successof the
performance of "The Knight of the

Mrs. Richardson, Professor Rieber,

Armes of the English department.
Fifty per cent of the receipts
which will go to the committee is
to be devoted to the Students' Clu
bhouse Loan Fund Association at
California. The purpose of this
organization is to aid groups of
students desiring to form eating
clubs at Berkeley by affording
them loans of the capital necessary
to start with. As Ihe dormitory
system does not prevail at Berkeley,
a large number of students are com
pelled to club together and live in
this way, and the funds of tiie as
sociation are so used as to allevi
ate the difficulties that such clubs
are forced to surmount at the start.
Owing to the cost of transporta
tion, and the difficulty of setting it
up in the Greek theater, the Eliza
bethan stage will not be taken to
Berkeley, but the performance will
be given direct from the stage of
the amphitheater without the set
ting for the Elizabethan audience,
which will also be left behind. The
outdoor performance, however,
should be equally effective.
The cast will leave for Berkeley
Saturday morning on the 8:30
train. A brief rehearsal will be
held nt the amphitheater at 11
o'clock. Luncheon will be served
at 12 by the University Dining As
sociation. All members of the cast
will be expected to be on hand at
the dressing-rooms of the Greek
theater promptly at 1 o'clock,
which will allow sufficient time
for preparation.
