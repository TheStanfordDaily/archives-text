# JAPANESE PLAY GOOD BALL.
## Waseda Defeated by the Varsity by the Small Score of 3 to 1. Big Crowd Present. 
### 
Before a crowd of over 2000
people, of which two-thirds were
Japanese, at Recreation Bark yes
terday afternoon, the Varsity again
defeated the Waseda University
team by a score of 3 to 1. The
Japanese team fielded well and
their throwing was fast and accur
ate, but they were unable to touch
Rook's curves, only two clean hits
being made off the Stanford twirler.
Kono, the Japanese pitcher,
showed improvement over his work
last Saturday and held the Varsity
down to nine hits, which were
pretty well scattered except in the
fifth inning. The failure of the
Varsity to score more than three
runs was due principally to the
fact that the diamond was slippery
and several men were caught try
injjflßh steal second. Yamawaka,
theWapanese catcher, was partly
responsible for keeping the runs
down, as lie threw to the bags in
excellent form.
There was no scoring up to the
fourth inning, when Stanford made
one run, and followed this by two
more in the next inning. Presley
was the first man to score. He re
ceived a base on balls, stole second,
and scored by an error of Suyama.
In the fifth Trowbridge started
the trouble by reaching first on
Izumitani's failure to stop a hard
hit bali. Trowbridge stole second
and was advanced to third on
Stott's single. Then Bell scored
both men with a clean two-bagger
down the third base line. He was
caught at the plate by a beautiful
throw from right field. Then Fen
ton knocked a line drive to Izumi
tani, and this ended the scoring as
far as Stanford was concerned.
In the eighth inning the Japan
ese made their only tally. Obara
got a pass to first. The next man
up struck out. Then Yamakawa
made a clean single past third, and
on a throw to second both runners
advanced a base. This left a man
on second and third with only one
down, the first good chance the
Japanese had to score. Suyama
struck out and it began to look as
if Rook would pull out without a
a run, when Stott allowed a wide
out to pass him and Obara scored.
The bleachers made a great
demonstration when this run was
scored,but all hope of further tallies
in this inning was shattered when
Hasakawa fanned three times. In
the ninth the Japanese went out
in one-two-three order.
The Japanese team played fine
ball and the battery was especially
effective. Yamawaki threw to sec
ond in great style, and Kono's
curves were not as easy for the
Stanford batters as in the first con
test. There is a possibility of
another game between the two

teams, and if the visitors improve
at the present rate the third con
test should be very close.
Following is the detailed score:
