# WASEDA TO PLAY TO-MORROW.
## Japanese Will Meet Encina Club Nine on the Varsity Diamond at 3:30 o'Clock. 
### 
Arrangements are being made by
the Waseda baseball players for
holding future games. To-morrow
afternoon at 3:80 they will play
the Encina Club on the Varsity
diamond. On Friday they will
probably play a faculty nine, but
the definite arrangements for this
game have not yet been made. For
next Tuesday they have arranged
to meet St. Mary's College in San
Francisco. No date has yet been
set for another game between Wa
seda and the Varsity, but there
will probably be another held be
tween those two teams later in the
semester. Treasurer Barrett has
granted the Waseda team the use
of the Varsity diamond for prac
tice every day for the next two
weeks from 11 to 3.
The line-up for the game to be
played between Waseda and the
Encina Club to-morrow will be as
follows:
