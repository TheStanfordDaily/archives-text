### 
Joaquin Miller, the "Poet of the
Sierras,'' who is making a short
stay on the campus, presented to
the Geology department this morn
ing a large horn of some extinct
animal which he secured while
travelling in the Klondike. The
horn is from some vertebrate ani
mal, perhaps of the bison species,
but it has not yet been definitely
classified. The specimen will be
placed in the geological museum.
