# Special Organ Recital Friday.
## 
### 
Dr. B. C. Blodgett, organist of
the Memorial THhurch, has an
nounced that the date of the special
morning organ recital, which was
given last Thursday at 11:30, will
be changed this week to Friday at
the same hour. This change is
made in response to numerous re
quests, but will be only in the na
ture of an experiment and not
permanent. There was a large at
tendance at last week's recital. No
definite program has been arranged
for Friday, but those who desire to
have special selections played may
hand requests 10 Mr. Beale at the
church.
