### 
Alvin W. Baird, '01, Physiology,
who will graduate this June from
Cornell Medical College in New
York City, was one of the six who
recently were successful in passing
the examinations and receiving the
appointment to the house staff of
the Presbyterian Hospital of New
York City. This is one of New
York's largest and most important
hospitals, and these appointments
are eagerly sought after and stren
uously competed for. While Baird
wasa student in theCornell Medical
School he served as assistant and
demonstrator in physiology.
