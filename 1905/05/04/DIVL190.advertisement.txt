WHY DOES
HE LIKE IT?
(From the California Limited
Log Book)
My 12th trip on the Santa Fe Cal
ifornia Limited. Why do I like it?
Trains finest in America! Meals de
licious! Attentions splendid! Ser
vice perfect, with all comforts of
a good home. It costs no more, so
why not take the California Limited?
