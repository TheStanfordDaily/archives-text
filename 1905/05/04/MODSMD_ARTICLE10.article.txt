With the completion of the new
gymnasium building the university
will probably be able to secure
what it has needed for a long time
â€”a trophy room. Harvard and
many of the other great universi
ties of the East have their trophy
room, in which they keep the ma
terial evidence of the successes of
their teams in athletics, debates or
other contests. At Stanford we
have never had anything of the
kind. We have trophies, but they
have little reality to us because we
never 6ee them. It is safe to say
that hardly more than a score of
the thirteen hundred students of
the university have any idea what
ever of the appearance of the cup
offered by the student body to the
high school debating league of Cen
tral California. Occasionally a
trophy of some kind will make its
appearance in a window of the
quadrangle and after a few days it
will disappear: from what vault it
is drawn and to what nook it is
returned none knows. The natural
consequence of this is the conspic
uous lack of interest in our cups
and other trophies that exists to
day. We need a room where we
may put the trophies we offer and
the trophies we win, our Stanford
debating cup and our Hearst de
bating cup; where we may hang
photographs of our Varsity teams,
of our Varsity captains, and of our
coaches; where we may place our
banners and our small but interest
ing trophies like the great baggage
check. 'We want a place where we
may gather together these things
that tell the story of our victories,
or perhaps of our defeats. We
want to bring them to a place
where we may come to know them
and to appreciate them, and where
our visitors may see them too.
