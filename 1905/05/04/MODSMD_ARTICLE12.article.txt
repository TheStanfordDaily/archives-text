## Excellent Records Made by the Men of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.

Our closer relations with the uni
versities of the Northwest, and the
fact that the University of Califor
nia track team is soon to meet
Washington on the track, makes it
of interest to know what the ath
letes of the northern universities
have done on cinder-path and field.
