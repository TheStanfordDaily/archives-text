# JOAQUIN MILLER SPEAKS.
## Poet Lectures on "Education in China" Before English Club. Election of Officers. 
### 
Joaquin Miller, "the poet of the
Sierras," delivered a lecture on
"Education in China" before a
meeting of the English Club last
night at the Kappa Alpha Theta
house. Besides covering the subject
of theeducational problem in China
from the point of view of a mission
ary, the famous poet recited some
selections from his own works, and
related a number of personal ex
periences and stories. In the course
of his talk Miller brought out a
number of striking points in the
religious life of the Chinese, the
peculiar education methods, and
the traits which dominate their
character as a people. Their re
ligion, strictly as they live up to it,
is a negative force. It teaches them
not the Christian doctrine, "do unto
others as you would have others do
unto yon," but that a man shall
not do unto others as others should
do unto him. This negative idea,
most clearly shown in their re
ligion, pervades their whole char
acter as a people, and is at the bot
tom of their failure to accomplish
or achieve anything.
No race of people is more devoted
to education, nor more blind in
their devotion, than the Chinese.
It is linked with their religion,
which alone occupies a stronger
bold upon their minds. A young
man desiring to take the examina
tions at Peking for a lieutenantcy
in the army must spend seventeen
years in preparation. Children are
made to study almost before they

can enunciate clearly, beginning
by learning the simple principles
of conduct set down by Confucius.
Their study is entirely memory
work, and bo much of what they
are compelled to learn is useless
that with it all they are seldom able
to make any great advance in the
arts of civilization.
Before the regular program of the
evening,officers were elected for the
next semester. A. It. Fletcher, '06,

H. A. Moran, '05, as president of
the club, has already served as an

treasurer last fall. He is well
known in literary circles, and

Carnot debating team.
