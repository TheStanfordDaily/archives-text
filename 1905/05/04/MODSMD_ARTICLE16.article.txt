# EARN MONEY IN MANY WAYS.
## Large Number of Northwestern Students Putting Themselves Through College. 
### 
Nearly half of the men students
in the college of liberal arts of
North western University earn all
or part of the money to pay their
way through school. Some care
for the furnaces of wealthy resi
dents of Evaneton and attend a
dance at the boat club now and
then. Others wait on the table or
wash dishes in boarding clubs or
restaurants, but find time to don
dress suits for evening calls. Many
shovel snow in the winter time.
Scores aid the thrifty housewife
with the spring cleaning and gather
in 25 cents per hour.
The industry of the Northwestern
students, who find time to do all
kinds of work and keep up their
studies and social duties too, be
eame known through a census
taken under the direction of the
university authorities, says the Chi
cago Chronicle. Five canvassers
interviewed approximately half of
the men in the college, and the re
sult of their labors will be pub
lished in the spring announcement
of the university.
Acting President Ilolgat author
ized W. H. Long, the student who
has charge of the canvass, to give
out the following summary:
Number of men interviewed.. 200
Average cost of boa rd per weeks 3 40
Average cost of room per
month 5 40
Percentage earnit g all or part
of expenses 49
Average earnings per week . $5 85

Average earning in summer
vacation $125
Some Find Cheap Board.
These figures, however,do not in
dicate half the interesting facts dis
covered by the canvassers. While
the average cost of hoard is $8.40,
some men are getting their meals
for a much lower rate. Two men
were found who hoard for $2 25 a
week each, though they prepare at
least some of their own meals.
Others hoard in clubs for $2.75 or
$3 a week. Many were found
whose weekly board bill run6 over
$4 or possibly $5 a week.
Likewise, the average cost of
rooms, which is listed in the table,
does not furnish an indication of
the extreme cheapness with which
many of the men secure rooms.
While the average cost of a double
room for each of the two renters is
$5.40 a month, two men were found
who rent a double room for $7, or
$3.50 each. Others pay $4 or $4.50
for half of a double room, with
heat and light furnished, while
many pay no more than $5. One
young man was found who pays
$5 for a single room lighted by gas
and heated by a furnace. Others,
it is true, pay $7 or $8 a month.
The census takers did not ask
any of the 200 men interviewed
how they were earning all or part
of their expenses, as no statistics
were desired on that point, but
those who have been connected
with the university community for
several years tell many interesting
stories of the devices resorted to by
students who desire to earn a few
dollars.
The price for taking care of a

furnace averages $5 and $6 a
month, though in some cases it may
run over this. During the winter
months many students earn enough
this way to pay their monthly
room rent, while some earn enough
to pay their rent two or three times
over. One student in the univer
sity earns $00 a month, and most
of this sum is the result of taking
care of furnaces.
Waiters Much in Demand.
Perhaps the most popular method
of earning money is waiting on
table in a boarding school. In
some clubs the student waiters are
required to wait on table three
times a day for their meals. Other
students, who are fortunate enough
to secure positions as waiters in
established restaurants or private
boarding-houses, often earn all
their meals by waiting on table but
twice a day. Other students earn
their board by washing dishes.
The college Y. M. C. A. main
tains a free employment bureau,
and many Evanstonians have
formed the habit of applying to
that agency whenever they want a
student to do any work. At house
cleaning time in the fall and spring
the students reap a harvest. A few
earn enough to pay their board by
working in the college library, arid
some earn a considerable sum by
working in the university offices.
Young Preachers Work Hard.
A class of students unique in the
method of earning to pay for an
education is composed of those pre
paring for the ministry. Many of
these students are pastors of one or
more churches within a radius of
fifty miles of Chicago. Their sal-

Aries will probably average $10 a
week. Their lot is a hard one,
however, for often they are com
pelled to leave Evanston Friday
afternoon, spend all day Saturday
visiting their parishioners, preach
three or four times on Sunday, and
get back on Monday for recitations,
for which they have had little time
to prepare.
"A surprising fact brought out
by the census," said W. H. Long,
'Ms the large amonut earned by the
students. We did not imagine that
the average would be so high as
$5.58 a week." Not all the students
who work are earning this amount,
and many do not try to. Some
are content to earn $2 or $3 a week,
but others are earning as high as
$10 or $15.
Soon a series of strange con
ferences will begin in Evanston.
Students who plan to earn money
during the summer will be closeted
with the general agents of Chicago
and New York publishing-houses,
who will instruct them in the art
of book-selling. Other students
secure office work, and some have
been known to secure work on a
bridge gang or in a factory.
"The encouraging fact about the
men who work their way through
Northwestern University," said
Professor John 11. Gray, head of
thedepartment of political economy,
"is that their social standing does
not seem to suffer by the fact that
that the}' earn all or part of their
expenses. Another fact worthy of
note is that they are good students
and do creditable college work. In
fact, the best men we kave in col
lege are those who work their way."

students, who find time to do all
kinds of work and keep up their
studies and social duties too, be
eame known through a census
taken under the direction of the
university authorities, says the Chi
cago Chronicle. Five canvassers
interviewed approximately half of
the men in the college, and the re
sult of their labors will be pub
lished in the spring announcement
of the university.
Acting President Ilolgat author
ized W. H. Long, the student who
has charge of the canvass, to give
out the following summary:
Number of men interviewed.. 200
Average cost of boa rd per weeks 3 40
Average cost of room per
month 5 40
Percentage earnit g all or part
of expenses 49
Average earnings per week . $5 85

Some Find Cheap Board.
These figures, however,do not in
dicate half the interesting facts dis
covered by the canvassers. While
the average cost of hoard is $8.40,
some men are getting their meals
for a much lower rate. Two men
were found who hoard for $2 25 a
week each, though they prepare at
least some of their own meals.
Others hoard in clubs for $2.75 or
$3 a week. Many were found
whose weekly board bill run6 over
$4 or possibly $5 a week.
Likewise, the average cost of
rooms, which is listed in the table,
does not furnish an indication of
the extreme cheapness with which
many of the men secure rooms.
While the average cost of a double
room for each of the two renters is
$5.40 a month, two men were found
who rent a double room for $7, or
$3.50 each. Others pay $4 or $4.50
for half of a double room, with
heat and light furnished, while
many pay no more than $5. One
young man was found who pays
$5 for a single room lighted by gas
and heated by a furnace. Others,
it is true, pay $7 or $8 a month.
The census takers did not ask
any of the 200 men interviewed
how they were earning all or part
of their expenses, as no statistics
were desired on that point, but
those who have been connected
with the university community for
several years tell many interesting
stories of the devices resorted to by
students who desire to earn a few
dollars.
The price for taking care of a

furnace averages $5 and $6 a
month, though in some cases it may
run over this. During the winter
months many students earn enough
this way to pay their monthly
room rent, while some earn enough
to pay their rent two or three times
over. One student in the univer
sity earns $00 a month, and most
of this sum is the result of taking
care of furnaces.
Waiters Much in Demand.
Perhaps the most popular method
of earning money is waiting on
table in a boarding school. In
some clubs the student waiters are
required to wait on table three
times a day for their meals. Other
students, who are fortunate enough
to secure positions as waiters in
established restaurants or private
boarding-houses, often earn all
their meals by waiting on table but
twice a day. Other students earn
their board by washing dishes.
The college Y. M. C. A. main
tains a free employment bureau,
and many Evanstonians have
formed the habit of applying to
that agency whenever they want a
student to do any work. At house
cleaning time in the fall and spring
the students reap a harvest. A few
earn enough to pay their board by
working in the college library, arid
some earn a considerable sum by
working in the university offices.
Young Preachers Work Hard.
A class of students unique in the
method of earning to pay for an
education is composed of those pre
paring for the ministry. Many of
these students are pastors of one or
more churches within a radius of
fifty miles of Chicago. Their sal-

Aries will probably average $10 a
week. Their lot is a hard one,
however, for often they are com
pelled to leave Evanston Friday
afternoon, spend all day Saturday
visiting their parishioners, preach
three or four times on Sunday, and
get back on Monday for recitations,
for which they have had little time
to prepare.
"A surprising fact brought out
by the census," said W. H. Long,
'Ms the large amonut earned by the
students. We did not imagine that
the average would be so high as
$5.58 a week." Not all the students
who work are earning this amount,
and many do not try to. Some
are content to earn $2 or $3 a week,
but others are earning as high as
$10 or $15.
Soon a series of strange con
ferences will begin in Evanston.
Students who plan to earn money
during the summer will be closeted
with the general agents of Chicago
and New York publishing-houses,
who will instruct them in the art
of book-selling. Other students
secure office work, and some have
been known to secure work on a
bridge gang or in a factory.
"The encouraging fact about the
men who work their way through
Northwestern University," said
Professor John 11. Gray, head of
thedepartment of political economy,
"is that their social standing does
not seem to suffer by the fact that
that the}' earn all or part of their
expenses. Another fact worthy of
note is that they are good students
and do creditable college work. In
fact, the best men we kave in col
lege are those who work their way."
Nearly half of the men students
in the college of liberal arts of
North western University earn all
or part of the money to pay their
way through school. Some care
for the furnaces of wealthy resi
dents of Evaneton and attend a
dance at the boat club now and
then. Others wait on the table or
wash dishes in boarding clubs or
restaurants, but find time to don
dress suits for evening calls. Many
shovel snow in the winter time.
Scores aid the thrifty housewife
with the spring cleaning and gather
in 25 cents per hour.
