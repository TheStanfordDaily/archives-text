# BEAUTIFUL HEARST DEBATING CUP NOW IN STANFORD'S POSSESSION.
## Names of the Six Men Who Won the Trophy in Three Consecutive Contests Will Be Engraved Upon It. 
### 
STANFORD'S victory in the last Intercollegiate debate, the third
successful contest, entitles the Cardinal to permanent possession
of the cup offered by William Randolph Hearst in 1903. The cup has
been at Stanford since the first debate, held the year it was offered.
This possession, however, was only temporary, for the trophy was to
become the permanent property of the university first winning it three
times.
The cup is embossed gold, eighteen inches high, inscribed on one side
with an "S " and a "C," and on the other with words explaining its
purpose. It has been suggested that it would be appropriate to inscribe
on the cup the names of those who have had a part in winning it. Six
men —O. C. Spencer,'o4, F. Roehr,'o4, H. M. Lewis,'o4, A. Sherriffs,'os,
R. G. Barnett, '05, and D. D. Sales, '06—are entitled to this distinction.
All of these six men are still students in the university, Spencer, Roehr
and Lewis taking graduate work in law.
