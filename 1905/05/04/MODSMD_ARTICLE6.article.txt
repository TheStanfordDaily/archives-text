# "QUAD" SALE TUESDAY.
## Delayed Edition of the Junior Annual Will Probably Appear Early Next Week. 
### 
The 1906 Quad will probably be
placed on sale next Tuesday morn
ing. The books have been prom
ised on that date by the Sunset
J'ress, the intermediate time being
necessary to remedy the errors in
the book's make-up. The mistake
was made in folding the forms of
the fraternity section, in which the
printers confused the names and
pictures of several fraternities.
The correction of Â»the error will
necessitate the withdrawal of the
misplaced pages and their rein
sertion in proper order. The en
tire consignment of books, which
arrived on the campus yesterday,
was shipped back to the city this
morning.
