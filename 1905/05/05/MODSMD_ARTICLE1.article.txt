THE first announcement of the
Senior week festivities, as of
ficially given out by President A.
L. Trowbridge, although not yet
complete in all details, embraces a
large number of features that make
the program an unusually interest
ing one. Most noticeable of all is
the fusion of the program of the
decennial alumni reunion with the
ordinary events of commencement
week, which crowds each day to its
utmost capacity, and should make
the graduating exercises of the
class of 1905 the occasion of more
than the usual amount of activity
and festivity.
As usual, the festivities of the
week will be started by the Senior
farce. "Kidnaped," an original

presented in the Assembly Hall on

rose, president of Whitman Col
lege, and in the afternoon services

'05 plate, and the Senior ball,
which will this year be given in
the Encina club-room. Another
new and distinctive feature that

Phi Beta Kappa, which will take
place in the afternoon in the

ficially given out by President A.
L. Trowbridge, although not yet
complete in all details, embraces a
large number of features that make
the program an unusually interest
ing one. Most noticeable of all is
the fusion of the program of the
decennial alumni reunion with the
ordinary events of commencement
week, which crowds each day to its
utmost capacity, and should make
the graduating exercises of the
class of 1905 the occasion of more
than the usual amount of activity
and festivity.
As usual, the festivities of the
week will be started by the Senior
farce. "Kidnaped," an original
farce, by R. S. Harris, '08, will be
presented in the Assembly Hall on
the evening of Thursday, May 18th.
Saturday, May 20th, will be taken
up with the four traditional fea
tures of the Faculty-Senior base
ball game, President and Mrs. Jor
dan's reception to the graduating
class in the Zoology building in the

the Law Association, and the Sen
ior reception in the evening. Sun
day morning the baccalaureate ser
mon will be delivered in the Me
morial Church by Dr. S. B. L. Pen
rose, president of Whitman Col
lege, and in the afternoon services
Rev. Mr. Gardner will make an
address to the Seniors.

Monday will be class day and
will witness the dedication of the
'05 plate, and the Senior ball,
which will this year be given in
the Encina club-room. Another
new and distinctive feature that
is to remain a fixed event in the
future commencement week pro
grams will be the public meeting of
Phi Beta Kappa, which will take
place in the afternoon in the
chapel, and at which Professor E.
C. Moore of the University of Cali
fornia will deliver an address. A
