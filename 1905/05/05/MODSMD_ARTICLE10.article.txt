A word may be said about the
field-day that will be held on the
Varsity oval to-morrow afternoon.
The meet will bring to Stanford the
best athletes of the Santa Clara
valley, and many of the perform
ances will be well worth seeing. A
strong Stanford crowd on the bleach
ers will do much to enliven the meet
and to convince the visitors of our
interest in track affairs. These are
the men to whom we may naturally
look for recruits, and every courtesy
should be theirs while they are our
guests.
