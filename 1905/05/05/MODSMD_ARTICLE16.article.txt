# PRESIDENT JORDAN LECTURES.
## Gives Vivid Description of His Ascent of the Matterhorn Many Years Ago. 
### 
Before a large audience in the
Assembly Hall last night President
Jordan delivered his lecture on the
"Ascent of the Matterhorn." The
lecture was illustrated with some
excellent lantern - slides showing
different views of the famous peak.
Dr. Jordan said, in part:
" It was some twenty-four years
ago, or, more exactly, on the 10th
of August, 1881, that a little party
of five students, working their
way along the steep slopes of the
Malteryoke, saw, towering above,
dark and majestic, the great peak
of the Matterhorn, greatest of the
Swiss Alps. To be sure it is not
the highestof the Alpine peaks, but
there is no other mountain in the
world which makes such great use
of its height. The Matterhorn is
the creature of the sun and the
frost.
Lying as it does between the ice
and cold of Switzerland and the
summer sun of Italy, it offers no
resting place for snow or glacier.
It is one great mass of icy rock, un
climbable, save on the ridges,
where the shelving cliffs afford a
little firmer foothold. It was the
last of the great Swiss mountains!
to yield to the foot of man, and the
story of its conquest is one of
bravery and perseverance un
equalled in the annals of mountain
climbing. For a long time the
people dwelling at its base regarded
the Matterhorn with superstitious!
awe. They believed that it was the ;
abiding place of the Wandering)

Jew, and that Satan himself often
visited its lonely peak.
The First Great Tragedy.
"The conquest of the mountain
was first attempted by an Italian
guide, Jean Carrel, who believed
that he had been chosen by heaven
for this task. Every year he
ascended a little higher, but before
he reached the summit, in 1865,
three Englishmen, Haddel, Hudson
and Douglas, accompanied by Ed
ward Whymper, the greatest moun
tain climber of to-day, made the
ascent. Whymper's was the first
foot to tread upon the summit of
the Matterhorn. On the way down
Haddel, Hudson and Douglas were
whirled over a precipice and per
ished miserably, Whymper alone
escaping.
" But I must turn to my own
story. There were three of us, all
young students who felt that we
must do something great before we
returned to our native land. Gil
bert proposed the ascent, Beach waß
willing, but Jordan was doubtful
and needed much persuasion.
Later we were joined by three
others, making in all a party of six
—Gilbert and Anderson, whom you
all know, Williams, Spangler and
myself. As guides we hired Jean
Baptiste Aymond, one of the great
est of Alpine guides, and five other
skilful men.
Difficulties of the Ascent.
c " The day of the ascent we break
fasted at 1:30 a.m. and by sunrise
we had reached the famous lower
cabin, after a beautiful walk over
pastures and meadows in the clear
light of the early dawn. At the
cabin, the walls of which were cov

ered with inscriptions in every liv
ing tongue, we rested for a moment.
Then we begun a steep and dan
gerous ascent along a narrow path
of rock bordering on an awful
chasm.
"When we reached the end of
this we beheld ten feet above our
heads another and similar path.
John the Baptist, as we had chris
tened our guide, went up first and
pulled one of his comrades after
him. Then the two of them hoisted
me up like a sack of meal —no light
task, for I believe that J have the
somewhat doubtful distinction of
being the heaviest man who ever
climbed the Matterhorn. Then,
tooth and nail, clinging to every
projecting rock, and climbing hand
over hand up frosted lengths of
rope that guarded precipices, we
reached at last the upper cabin—a
mere woodchuck burrow of rocks.
Thence up a long line of hanging
ropes we swung our way five hun
dred feet upward to the summit.
Gilbert Seriously Hurt.
" When we reached it at last we
were completely obscured in clouds
and could see very little, so we did
not remain long. However, we
wrote our names on cards and
dropped them into the bottle which
is the mountain's register, and then
we turned to descend. Here came
the first and worst accident of the
trip. A falling rock, loosened by
the feet of one of the last of us,
struck Gilbert a glancing blow in
the head and cut deep into his fore
head just above the nose. We
bound up the wound as well as we
could and hastened down to the
upper cabin, where we put our
patient to sleep on the hay. Then

three of the party were pent on
ahead, while Jean, Spangler and I
spent a terrible night with the
wounded man in the little hut.
Next morning Gilbert was better,
bo he and Jean started down ahead.
Spangler and I were finally rescued
by two of the other guides, and at
length, after a nightmarish journey,
we reached safety and the vallev,
where we were welcomed by crowds
of admiring townspeople.
" Does it pay? you will naturally
ask; and 1 will answer you that
that ascent of the Matterhorn, in
spite of its dangers and discom
fitures, was the greatest experience
of an otherwise commonplace life,
and that I am thankful that for
once at least 1 have stood upon the
top of the world."

head just above the nose. We
bound up the wound as well as we
could and hastened down to the
upper cabin, where we put our
patient to sleep on the hay. Then

three of the party were pent on
ahead, while Jean, Spangler and I
spent a terrible night with the
wounded man in the little hut.
Next morning Gilbert was better,
bo he and Jean started down ahead.
Spangler and I were finally rescued
by two of the other guides, and at
length, after a nightmarish journey,
we reached safety and the vallev,
where we were welcomed by crowds
of admiring townspeople.
" Does it pay? you will naturally
ask; and 1 will answer you that
that ascent of the Matterhorn, in
spite of its dangers and discom
fitures, was the greatest experience
of an otherwise commonplace life,
and that I am thankful that for
once at least 1 have stood upon the
top of the world."
Before a large audience in the
Assembly Hall last night President
Jordan delivered his lecture on the
"Ascent of the Matterhorn." The
lecture was illustrated with some
excellent lantern - slides showing
different views of the famous peak.
Dr. Jordan said, in part:
" It was some twenty-four years
ago, or, more exactly, on the 10th
of August, 1881, that a little party
of five students, working their
way along the steep slopes of the
Malteryoke, saw, towering above,
dark and majestic, the great peak
of the Matterhorn, greatest of the
Swiss Alps. To be sure it is not
the highestof the Alpine peaks, but
there is no other mountain in the
world which makes such great use
of its height. The Matterhorn is
the creature of the sun and the
frost.
Lying as it does between the ice
and cold of Switzerland and the
summer sun of Italy, it offers no
resting place for snow or glacier.
It is one great mass of icy rock, un
climbable, save on the ridges,
where the shelving cliffs afford a
little firmer foothold. It was the
last of the great Swiss mountains!
to yield to the foot of man, and the
story of its conquest is one of
bravery and perseverance un
equalled in the annals of mountain
climbing. For a long time the
people dwelling at its base regarded
the Matterhorn with superstitious!
awe. They believed that it was the ;
abiding place of the Wandering)

Jew, and that Satan himself often
visited its lonely peak.
The First Great Tragedy.
"The conquest of the mountain
was first attempted by an Italian
guide, Jean Carrel, who believed
that he had been chosen by heaven
for this task. Every year he
ascended a little higher, but before
he reached the summit, in 1865,
three Englishmen, Haddel, Hudson
and Douglas, accompanied by Ed
ward Whymper, the greatest moun
tain climber of to-day, made the
ascent. Whymper's was the first
foot to tread upon the summit of
the Matterhorn. On the way down
Haddel, Hudson and Douglas were
whirled over a precipice and per
ished miserably, Whymper alone
escaping.
" But I must turn to my own
story. There were three of us, all
young students who felt that we
must do something great before we
returned to our native land. Gil
bert proposed the ascent, Beach waß
willing, but Jordan was doubtful
and needed much persuasion.
Later we were joined by three
others, making in all a party of six
—Gilbert and Anderson, whom you
all know, Williams, Spangler and
myself. As guides we hired Jean
Baptiste Aymond, one of the great
est of Alpine guides, and five other
skilful men.
Difficulties of the Ascent.
c " The day of the ascent we break
fasted at 1:30 a.m. and by sunrise
we had reached the famous lower
cabin, after a beautiful walk over
pastures and meadows in the clear
light of the early dawn. At the
cabin, the walls of which were cov

ered with inscriptions in every liv
ing tongue, we rested for a moment.
Then we begun a steep and dan
gerous ascent along a narrow path
of rock bordering on an awful
chasm.
"When we reached the end of
this we beheld ten feet above our
heads another and similar path.
John the Baptist, as we had chris
tened our guide, went up first and
pulled one of his comrades after
him. Then the two of them hoisted
me up like a sack of meal —no light
task, for I believe that J have the
somewhat doubtful distinction of
being the heaviest man who ever
climbed the Matterhorn. Then,
tooth and nail, clinging to every
projecting rock, and climbing hand
over hand up frosted lengths of
rope that guarded precipices, we
reached at last the upper cabin—a
mere woodchuck burrow of rocks.
Thence up a long line of hanging
ropes we swung our way five hun
dred feet upward to the summit.
Gilbert Seriously Hurt.
" When we reached it at last we
were completely obscured in clouds
and could see very little, so we did
not remain long. However, we
wrote our names on cards and
dropped them into the bottle which
is the mountain's register, and then
we turned to descend. Here came
the first and worst accident of the
trip. A falling rock, loosened by
the feet of one of the last of us,
struck Gilbert a glancing blow in
the head and cut deep into his fore
head just above the nose. We
bound up the wound as well as we
could and hastened down to the
upper cabin, where we put our
