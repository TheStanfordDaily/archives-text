# TO SPEND TWO YEARS ABROAD.
## Dr. Ewald Flugel to Work on Chaucer Dictionary under Carnegie Institute Grant. 
### 
Dr. Ewald Flugel, head of the
department of English Philology
at the university, will leave Stan
ford this month for a two years'
stay in England and on the conti
nent for the purpose of completing
the important work which he is do
ing on a dictionary and lexicon of
Chaucer under the grant made
him a year ago hy the Carnegie
Institute. Dr. Fliigel will start
about May 15th, and in all proba
bility will not return before the
opening of college for the fall se
mester of 1907.
All of the work that has been
completed so far upon the diction
ary has been based upon the seven
texts of Chaucer's works that are
available upon the Coast. The ma
terial that can be gained from
these has now been exhausted, and
before proceeding to his final re
sults Dr. Flugel will examine the
fifty or more texts that are avail
able in England. When completed
the dictionary will be one of the
most valuable authorities for the
study of old English that has yet
been attempted. While in Eng
land Dr. Fliigel will be assisted by
a staff of philologists from Eng
lish and German universities.
