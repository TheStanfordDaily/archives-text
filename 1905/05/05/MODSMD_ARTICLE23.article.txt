# BIG FIELD-DAY TO-MORROW.
## Track Athletes Will Meet on the University of California Oval. 
### 
What promises to be one of the
most interesting field-days of the
year will be held on the University
of California oval to-morrow after
noon. The meet is held under the
auspices of the Pacific Athletic
Association, and the entry list is
open to any registered amateur
athlete. Besides settling the ques
tion of State championships, to
morrow's affair will he in the na
ture of a try-out to select the track
team which will represent Califor
nia in the Pacific Coast champion
ship games to be held during the
progress of the Lewis and Clark
Exposition at Portland, Or., next
summer.
From all over the State the crack
athletes from colleges, athletic
clubs, and preparatory schools have
entered for the coming meet.
Among the notable athletes entered
are N. E. Dole, '05, holder of the
world's record in the pole-vault;
0. E. Hyde, '05, former holder of
the American intercollegiate shot
put record; Alfred Plaw of the Uni
versity of California, for several
years American intercollegiate
champion hammer-thrower; Chan
ning Hall of the Oakland High
School, Coast record holder in the
high jump; 0. E. Snedigar, holder
of the Pacific Coast record in the
100-yard dash; C. Parsons of the
University of Southern California,
who has proven himself the fastest
man in the southern part of the
State; and H. L. Horton, the crack
Stanford freshman hurdler.
Miller Will Not Enter.
J. O. Miller, '08, had intended to
enter to-morrow's field-day, but the
pressure of his college work has
been such that he has had no time
to train, and he is therefore not in
condition to compete. Many people
desired to see the phenomenal Stan
ford performer run against his
California rival, Mishler.
The short dashes ought to prove
the most exciting events of the
meet, with Snedigar and Parsons
pitted against each other. The lat

ter sprinter will probably break
the Coast record if he is in good
condition. Parsons has been doing
phenomenal work in the south re
cently, and experts who have
watched his performances declare
that he is good for better than 10
flat.
Dole Will Vault Again.
In the pole-vault N. E. Dole, the
world's champion, will be pitted
against Irwin, the Reliance athlete
who has vaulted 11 feet inches.
In the shot-put Hyde will com
pete against Plaw, Zacharias and
Sperry, but if he is in form he
ought to win this event without
difficulty.

The short dashes ought to prove
the most exciting events of the
meet, with Snedigar and Parsons
pitted against each other. The lat

ter sprinter will probably break
the Coast record if he is in good
condition. Parsons has been doing
phenomenal work in the south re
cently, and experts who have
watched his performances declare
that he is good for better than 10
flat.
Dole Will Vault Again.
In the pole-vault N. E. Dole, the
world's champion, will be pitted
against Irwin, the Reliance athlete
who has vaulted 11 feet inches.
In the shot-put Hyde will com
pete against Plaw, Zacharias and
Sperry, but if he is in form he
ought to win this event without
difficulty.

Miller Will Not Enter.
J. O. Miller, '08, had intended to
enter to-morrow's field-day, but the
pressure of his college work has
been such that he has had no time
to train, and he is therefore not in
condition to compete. Many people
desired to see the phenomenal Stan
ford performer run against his
California rival, Mishler.
The short dashes ought to prove
the most exciting events of the
meet, with Snedigar and Parsons
pitted against each other. The lat

ter sprinter will probably break
the Coast record if he is in good
