# SENIOR WEEK PROGRAM.
## Artistic Pamphlet with Order of Festivities Will Be Placed on Sale Next Tuesday. 
### 
The program for Senior week is
now being printed in San Francisco,
and will probably be ready for dis
tribution next Tuesday. The pro
gram will be issued in a very
artistic form. It is to be printed
in folder form on dark brown
paper, with the printing done in
reddish brown ink. The color de
sign will be a corner of the quad
rangle in its true colors, and with
the inscription "Class of '05."
Inside the first page there will be a
beautiful bromide photograph of
Mrs. Stanford, with a facsimile of
her signature underneath. The
photograph is to be finished in
bromide and the size will be 3X4f
inches. The committee in selecting
the photograph for this purpose
chose four of the best views taken
â€¢by Habenicht, so every program
will not have the same view. The
photographs cost the committee 20
cents each, or $300 altogether.
There are to be 1500 programs
printed, so that there will be 375
copies of each view.
The second page of the pamphlet
will give the general program of
the week. The class day exercises
will be printed on the next leaf,
and on the leaf following will be
printed the order of exercises for
the laying of the class plate. The
last pages of the pamphlet will
give the names of the 186 gradu
ates, the class officers, and the
members of the different com
mittees of the class.
The program will be sold at the
Bookstore. The price will be 25
cents for Seniors, and 35 cents for
others.
