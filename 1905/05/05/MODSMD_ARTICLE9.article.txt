On Sunday will be taken the
first active step toward the placing
of a memorial to Jane Lathrop
Stanford. The first fruits of the
plan suggested a week ago by Rev.
D. Charles Gardner will be gath
ered, and the movement will at
once take on more definite form.
The object and the general plan
hardly seem to call for any editor
ial comment. With the purpose
of honoring the university's mother
we must all be in thorough sym
pathy; and the memorial is to be
the tribute not alone of the men
and women who are the students
of the university, but of the faculty,
many of whom knew the dead wo
man intimately, and of those num
erous members of the community
who weremoreor less associated with
her. That the memorial should be
placed in the church has seemed
very appropriate to the committee
called together by Mr. Gardner.
It was this building that meant
more to Mrs. Stanford than any
other: it was her memorial to her
husband, and in it her whole heart
was bound up. Here, it seems,
should l>e placed the simple tribute
that is to tell of the affection of
those who were nearest to her dur
ing the final years of her life.
