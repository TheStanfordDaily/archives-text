# DR. BROWN PREACHES.
## "The Decisive Battles in Life" the Subject for an Eloquent Sermon. 
### 
"The Decisive Battles in Life" was
the subject of Rev. C. R. Brown's
sermon in the Memorial Church yes
terday morning. He said, in part:
"You may take for the text this
morning the words of God to Joshua
at the battle of Beth-Horon, 'Fear
not, for I have delivered them into
thine hands.' This struggle of Beth-
Horon, while in point of numbers
engaged it cannot rank with Water
loo, Gettysburg, or Mukden, was
one of the decisive battles of the
world. It involved a principle
which bore largely on the future
welfare of Christendom, and while
the hand was the hairy hand of
Oriental barbarism, the principle
which guided it was the same under
lying principle of good which
brought Christ into this world.
"In the same way every man or
woman who fights and wins the
battle against the forces of evil in
themselves has fought and won a
great decisive battle for the future
welfare of mankind. No matter
how small such a struggle may
seem, it involves a world principle
and its results will reach far into
the future.
"Moreover, even as at the battle
of Beth-Horon the sun and moon
stood still at the command of Joshua
so will the forces of nature fight for
you, if you are fighting on the side
of right and truth. Some of you
here to-day may be carrying on
battles with yourselves. To you I
say, fight not for your own sakes,
but for the sakes of others as well.
"And again I would quote to you
the words of our Savior in the
garden # of Gethsemane: 'For their
sakes fight on.' The forces of earth
and sky will be on your side; in the
darkest hour you will hear the as
surance: 'Fear not, I have delivered
them into thy hand'; and at last
you will find rest from war, for
your life will know the peace of God
which passeth all understanding."
