# VERY ARTISTIC VOLUME.
## 1906 "Quad" the Largest Ever Issued, and Contains Interesting Innovations. 
### 
The 1906 Quad is nearly twice as
thick as the 1905 Quad, and is
larger than any class annual ever
issued at Stanford. It is printed
on heavy, substantial paper, and
the press work is above the average.
With the exception of some mis
takes in initials and proper names,
the volume is now typographically
perfect. Artistically the book rivals
the best efforts of former Quads.
Some of the contributors to this de
partment are graduates who have
made a name for themselves in the
world of art, while the work of the
undergraduates is excellent.
On the whole the reproductions
of photographs are good, and where
they are poor it is due to defective
originals rather than the printing.
One of the notable features of the
book is the departure from the
conventional arrangement of pic
tures which ha√ü obtained in past
Quads. Small half-tone vignettes
have been used to great advantage
in illustrating some of the special
articles. With a few exceptions
the individual pictures of the mem
bers of 1906 are poor, although the
press work on them is good. The
trouble here again seems to have
been with the original photographs.
Memorial of Great Beauty.
Both from the literary and artis
tic point of view the most interest
ing part of the Quad is that portion
of the book devoted to a memorial
of Mrs. Stanford. The highest art
of the printer has been used to em
bellish the notable contributions to
that section. This memorial de
partment adds greatly to the value
of the book, as it is the first perma
nent, comprehensive review of the
sad events which surrounded the
passing of the last founder of the
university. The title-page for"In
Memoriam" is a beautiful and ab
solutely unique drawing by H. R.
Johnson, ex-'O4. The first article
in the section is the copy of a per
sonal letter in manuscript from
Mrs. Stanford in which the devoted
woman expresses the highest love
for the welfare of the university.
Professor A. G. Newcomer's sonnet
on the death of Mrs. Stanford is the
tenderestof tributes to her memory.
Another valuable contribution to
this part of the book is a fine repro

duction of one of Mrs. Stanford's
latest photographs, beautifully pre
pared and inlaid upon heavycream
tinted paper.
The year covered by the 1906
Quad has been a succession of al
most uninterrupted victories in ath
letics, and the editors have taken
advantage of this fact to enlarge
greatly the department devoted to
intercollegiate sports. In this sec
tion more than any other the tend
ency to break away from the cus
tom of inserting stiff, posed pictures
is shown. The members of the
Varsity football team are grouped
according to the positions played.
A number of excellent photographs
of both the Varsity and Freshman
teams in action are reproduced. A
review of the season written by L.
R. Weinmann, '06, gives a fair,
concise account of the series of vic
tories gained by the Stanford team.
The statistics in the athletic de
partment are much fuller and more
detailed than those printed in
previous Quads.
The section devoted to track and
field spirts is especially notable for
its pictures of the athletes in action.
Full statistics are given of the
meets in which the Varsity team
took part on its Eastern trip. The
space devoted to baseball is in
creased by the addition of statistics
not run in former books. Boating
and tennis both receive more atten
tion than usual.
Women's athletics receive a due
amount of space, which includes a
large picture of the tennis team.
Some Clever Title-Pages.
The title-page for the debating
section is one of the cleverest draw
ings in the book. It is the work of
J. K. Bonnell, '02, and represents
two parrots quarreling over the bust
of Demosthenes. This department
is another clean record of victories,
hut there is no departure from the
form used in other Quads.
Another decidedly clever piece of
art work is the design drawn by
Bristow Adams, ex-'OO, for the sec
tion devoted to publications. It is
the representation of a mediaeval
clerk engaged in writing in a huge
volume which he holds on a wooden
bench before him. The design is
correct in every detail, and the ex
ecution is superb.
Dr. Jordan on University Ideals.
The special articles for the pres
ent book are not so long nor so
great in number as those which
have appeared in former Quads, but
in quality they are up to the usual
standard. President David Starr
Jordan's article includes the noble
tribute which he paid to the mem
ory of Mrs. Stanford when the news
of her death was received at the
university. His theme is "Uni
versity Ideals," and in it he utters
his faith in a great future for Stan
ford.
The "Early Struggles of the Daily
Palo Alto," by A. B. Rice, '95, is
an interesting account of the tight
for existence made by the student
body organ.
"The Making of a Great Play
ground," by Dr. Frank Angell, to
whom the volume is dedicated, is a
valuable description of the plans of
the new athletic field.
J. F. Lanagan's contribution is
an i nteresti ng article on "The Open
Game in Football."
Literary and Dramatic.
The literary and dramatic sec
tions are well worth reading. With
the title of "Under the Calciums,"
D. M. Reynolds, '05, gives a spright
ly account of the histrionic happen
ings of the past year. A number
of good half-tones interspersed
throughout the article add greatly
to its interest.
Perhaps the weakest features of
the book are the class history and
the "j oslies." The class history is
clever but not humorous, nor is it
especially suggestive. Some of the
"joshes" which are interspersed
with the more serious matter of
the book are good, but the greater
part of those in the "josh" section
are too much on the conventional
order. At the same time the "josh"
editors have been fearless in the
use of their pens and pencils, and
some of theuniversity's well-known
characters and all the fraternities
will not be slow to recognize that
they have been hit.
All in all, the book appears to
the present reviewer to be a success,
artistically and generally. It is a
credit to the class and to the uni
versity.
