# Junior Women Meet.
## 
### 
The women of the Junior class
met to-day at 1:15 and discussed
the question of caps and gowns for
the coming year. The majority
favored the ordering of the gowns
this semester, so as to have them
ready at the opening of the fall
term. All Juniors desirous of se
curing the regulation cap and gown
are urged to leave their measure
ments at the Bookstore not later
than May 18th, as the orders will
have to be sent to New York im
mediately after the close of college.
