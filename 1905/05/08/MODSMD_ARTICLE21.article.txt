# Waseda-Varsity Game Cancelled.
## 
### 
The Waseda-Varsity game,sched
uled for Wednesday, May 10th, has
been called off owing to the fact
that examinations would prevent
several of the Varsity men from
playing. Arrangements are now
being made for a practice game be
tween Waseda and a team picked
from the fraternities, to be played
some day during the week. On
Tuesday Waseda will meet St.
Mary's College in San Francisco,
and on Monday, May 15th, they
will play California at Berkeley.
