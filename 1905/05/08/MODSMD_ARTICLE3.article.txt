# PARSONS PROVES HIMSELF THE PEER OF THE COAST SPRINTERS
## Southern Californian Beats Snedigar in Ten Flat. Three Stanford Men Take Four First Places. 
### 
THE final try-out for the selec
tion of athletes to represent the
Pacific Athletic Association at the
Lewis and Clark Exposition was
held on the Berkeley oval Satur
day afternoon. Stanford was repre
sented by three men —N. E. Dole,
'04, 0. E. Hyde, '05, and H. L.
Horton, '08 —and these three repre
sentatives won four first places.
Two Coast records were broken,
the 220-yard dash being run by
Parsons of the University of South
ern California in 22 1-5, and Snedi
gar of the University of California
clearing 23 feet 7.92 inches in the
broad jump. Parsons was easily
the star of the meet, defeating
Snedigar in both the hundred and
two-twenty. In the hundred the
man from the south did 10 seconds,
which is record time, and two
watches caught the time at 9 4-5.
Snedigar led Parsons in both the
sprints up to the last fifteen yards,
but the winner put up a beautiful
finish and won each event by a good
margin. Snedigar's mark in the
broad jump is three inches better
than the former record, held by
Broughton of California.
Dole Vaults in his Old Form.
Dole won the pole-vault, clear
ing the bar at the height of 11 feet
9 inches. Later he tried for a record
with the bar at 12 feet 2£ inches,
but was unable to clear it at that
height. He was at a disadvantage
owing to the fact that the pole he
used was shorter than the one he
is accustomed to.
Hyde won the shot-put at 43
feet 1 inch, which is two feet less
than his record established last
year. However, he defeated Plaw,
the former California star, and also
Sperry, who won the event in this
year's intercollegiate meet.
Hurdles Prove Easy for Horton.
Both hurdle events went to Hor
ton, who won easily, there being
only two entries in each event.
The high hurdles were so easy for
the Stanford man that when he
was near the finish Junk, his Cali
fornia opponent, who was a hurdle
or two behind, laughingly called to
him to wait a minute until he
caught up.
The high jump was won by Hall
of the Oakland High School at 6
'feet. The hammer-throw went to
Plaw, who hurled the sphere 168
feet.
Glarner of the Vampire Athletic
Association won the mile in the
fast time of 4:38 2-5.
The meet was high class in near
ly every event, and the track was
in good condition. There was only
a moderate attendance, but the
spectators showed much enthusi
asm over the performances of Par
sons, Dole, and Snedigar.
