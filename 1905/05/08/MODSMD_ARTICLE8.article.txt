The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students has under
taken an interesting experiment in
deciding to have a Stanford football
show upon the night of the inter
cellegiate game. The climax of the
dissatisfaction with the present
system was reached last year, when
the team and a large number of its
loyal supporters were taken to a
play whose general character is
well indicated by the name it bore,
"Sweet Clover," and as a further
test of the patience and good nature
of the audience, a few vaudeville
"stunts" were thrown in between
the acts which would have hurt the
feelings of the oldest Chutes habi
tue. Under this system of hiring
a theater with whatever happens to
be on the boards it is possible to
make a little money, but that
ought not to be the first consid
eration. The object ought to be
to have a play on the night of
the game which will be of interest
to the college. There may be a
question of the full success of a
football show in case of a defeat;
but we are not looking for a defeat
this year, and the experiment is
well worth the small risk.
The suggestion that the play be
given in San Francisco is perhaps
not the best plan. The varsity
game will be played on the Stan
ford campus this year, and the
most appropriate place for the
presentation of a football show
would seem to be upon the cam
pus, too. The play is to be given
by and for the student body, and
with the game here, it is unques
tionable that the greater number
of students will remain here,
whether we win or loee. Those
who go to the city are not those
who would care to confine them
selves within the walls of a theater,
nor has Stanford a great number of
followers in San Francisco who
would crowd the house. Conse
quently there would be little de

mand for the presentation of the
farce in San Francisco. Next year,
when the game takes place in
Berkeley, we may well have the
play in the city. We will have
greater experience then, and we
will be able to make the produc
tion a greater success.
