# "QUAD" SALE VERY HEAVY
## Nearly Six Hundred Copies of 1906 Annual Disposed of During the Day. 
### 
The 1906 Quad sale was opened
this morning on the inner quad
rangle at 8 o'clock, and by noon
over five hundred of the volumes
had been sold. At five o'clock this
afternoon nearly six hundred
copies had gone. The remaining
copies will probably be disposed of
within the next few days. The
sale will continue on the inner
quadrangle from 9:15 to 12:15
Wednesday.
The annual was generally pro
nounced a distinct success, and
ranked with the best books ever
issued by a junior class. The
heavy red-bound volumes were
much in evidence around the uni
versity during the entire day.
During the earlier hours of the
forenoon groups formed in the
library and around the inner quad
rangle to look over the new book.
The editor of the Quad was E. R.
May, and J. L. Maloy is the busi
ness manager. They were assisted
by the following staff: Miss E. R.
Mirrielees, Miss Alice S. Hayes, P.
C. Edwards, L. R. Weinmann, W.
H. B. Fowler, J. F. Cahoon, E. G.
Dudley, B. S. Allen, M. M. Stearns
and J. Nibley.
