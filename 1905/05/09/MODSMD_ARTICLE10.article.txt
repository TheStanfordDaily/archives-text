# FOOTBALL GAMES SCHEDULED.
## Manager Barrett Arranges for Contests with Oregon, Nevada and the Sherman Indians. 
### 
Although the opening of the foot
ball season is still some months
distant, Manager Barrett has
already scheduled three important
games. This scheduling of games
so far in advance is a new depar
ture, but Manager Barrett believes
it will do away with much of the
confusion which in the past has re
sulted from attempts to schedule
games at a few days' notice. Here
tofore it has been impossible for
any football arrangement to be
made so far in advance, as the
team has seldom had a coach
already picked at this time, but the
I recent signing of a three-year con
' tract with J. F. Lanagan, ; 00, has
removed this difficulty.
On Saturday, October 21st, Stan
ford will meet the University of
Nevada on Stanford's new athletic
field. This will probably be the
first intercollegiate contest of any
importance to be played on the
new gridiron.
One week later the Varsity will
make their only trip of the season,
when they will go south to meet
the Sherman Indians in Lob An
geles.
On Saturday, November 4th, the
Varsity will play Oregon at Stan
ford in the last preliminary game
before the intercollegiate struggle,
which comes this year on Novem
ber 11th.
All of these teams have met
Stanford on the gridiron before.
The rest of the schedule will be
filled up with games against the
San Francisco club teams, and pos
sibly a contest with the Utah Agri
cultural College, should the latter
decide to make another trip to the
Coast.
Manager Barrett has received
offers for post-season games from
Washington, the University of
Utah,and Colorado, to be played on
Thanksgiving day; but as each of
these games would necessitate an
extended trip, and as the faculty
committee is opposed to them, Man
ager Barrett has declined all these
offers. Last year's trip to Colorado
was very successful in every way
and netted an unusually large
financial profit, but the faculty
committee believes that the amount
of time given to football by mem
bers of the Varsity is sufficient
without the additional strain of a
post-season trip.
