The Senior ball committee an
nounces that it has cut down the
list of complimentary ticket?, so
that the only persons who will be
offered passes will be the president
of the class, the members of the ball
committee, two members of the
farce committee who are saving the
class a considerable sum by staging
the Senior farce themselves, and
the editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
All the subordinate class officers,
committee chairmen, farce actors
and other persons who in the past
have received complimentaries
must this year pay their way. As
a consequence, the list has been cut
to the respectable total of twelve,
which is in striking contrast to
some former years. This is an ex
cellent start toward the retrench
ment that has been needed for so
long. But the good work should
not stop here. Next year perhaps
the class of 1906 will take the
second step and require cash con
tributions from those members of
the ball committee who do little of
the work and from the editor of the
Daily Palo Alto. When 1907
gives its Senior ball we may hope
to see every man of the class —
president, committeeman, or un
titled member —giving the same
financial contribution to the suc
cess of the ball.
