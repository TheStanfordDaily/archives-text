# CONTESTS FOR BOATING MEN.
## Varsity and Freshman Crews Will Sail for the North on Saturday, May 20th. 
### 
Manager Barrett has completed
arrangements for the northern trip
of the Varsity and Freshman crews.
Both crews will sail on the steam
ship Senator, leaving San Fran
cisco May 20th. They will go
directly to Seattle, where they will
row in the triangular regatla be
tween the crews from Washington,
California and Stanford. This re
gatta takes place on Lake Wash
ington, May 30th.
The prospects for winning the
triangular regatta are bright. The
course upon which the regatta will
be held is a smooth one. and it is
claimed by those who have rowed
on Lake Washington that it is one
of the best courses on the Coast.
Washington has been practicing on
this lake, while Stanford has rowed
on an equally smooth course at
Redwood City. California has used
the Oakland estuary, where the
water is generally choppy and the
current unfavorable. Considering
the closeness of the dual regatta
between Washington and Stanford
on the Sausalito course last month,
and the splendid showing made by
Washington against odds on the
estuary in their race with Califor
nia, it is only fair to expect much
in the triangular regatta.
This regatta will furnish the first
opportunity for estimating the
value of the Freshman rowing ma
terial in college, for Stanford's
first-year men will row on the same
day also in a triangular regatta.
The crewslwill leave Seattle June

2d and go directly to Portland,
where the Varsity will meet the
Portland Rowing Club on June 4th.
California has heen invited to enter,
but it is not known whether her
crew will accept. The Stanford
crews will return by rail.

ably row the following men, who
represented her here against Stan
ford and California: Dan Pullen,
'07, captain and stroke; Owen
Brim, '07, No. 3; G. Tilten, '08, No.
2, and Richard Gloster, '06, bow.
Gloster will serve as coxswain, as
Washington uses an apparatus
whereby the man rowing bow also
steers the boat.
The California crew will be as
follows: E. A. Bannister, '05, cap
tain and stroke; G. C. Jones, '07,
No. 3; D. W. M. Evans, '05, No. 2;
E. V. Dodge, '05, bow, and E. J.
Loeb, '08, coxswain.
Stanford's Probable Crew.

same men who represented the uni
versity at Sausalito. The crew is
composed of W. H. Dole, '05, cap
tain and stroke; F. Zimmerman,
'07, No. 3; B. Bryan, '06, No. 2;
H. G. Butterfield, '05, bow, and F.
W. Turner, '08, coxswain.
