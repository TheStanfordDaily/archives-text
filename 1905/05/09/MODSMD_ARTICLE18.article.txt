# FINANCES OF ENGLISH PLAY.
## Two Performances of "Every Man in his Humour" Net but Small Profit. 
### 
The-final report made by W. H.
Thomson, '05, business manager of
the English Club play committee,
shows that the entire proceeds from
the two performances of "Every
Man in his Humour" will barely
cover the expenses of the produc
tion. The figures show a balance
of $ 18.05, which the English Club
will divide with the Boat Club.
Several things militated against
the financial success of the under
taking, especially the postponement
of the performances from the dates
originally set for them in March,
made necessary by Mrs. Stanford's
death. Not only did this post
ponement greatly reduce the at
tendance, but it caused a corre
sponding increase in the expendi
tures. In spite of this the net
proceeds from the play itself
amounted to approximately $250,
the failure of the book on "Eliza
bethan Humours" to sell being re
sponsible for the loss of over $200.
A play given on an elaborate
scale, and with attention to artistic
effect, is necessarily costly. In this
instance, as in the case of "The
Knight of the Burning Pestle" two
years ago, the club has been saved
one of the largest items of expense,
the salary of a professional coach,
for Mr. Bassett contributed his ser
vices in order that the English Club
play might be made a representa
tive university function.
It is possible that the English
Club will profit considerably by the
performance of "Every Man in his
Humour'' to be given at Berkeley
next Saturday, as the faculty com
mittee in charge has guaranteed the
club all expenses and one-half of
the net proceeds.
