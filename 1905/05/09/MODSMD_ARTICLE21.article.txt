# WASEDA WILL, GO SOUTH.
## Abe Abandons Proposed Eastern Trip and Will Tour Southern California. 
### 
Manager Abe of the Waseda
baseball team has decided to aban
don the proposed Eastern trip of the
team, and instead will tour South
ern California, playing games with
Occidental, Pomona, St. Vincent's,
the University of Southern Cali
fornia and the Sherman Indians.
Abe had planned to tour the
East, meeting all the leading col
lege teams, and had sought to have
Manager Barrett of Stanford ac
company them and take charge of
the financial end of the trip. Bar
rett, however, did not feel that he
could take the necessary time, and
he considered also that such a trip
would involve financial loss to
Waseda. He strongly advised Mr.
Abe against making the Eastern
tour unless he could secure a guar
antee from the Eastern universities.
As Abe has so far been unable to
obtain this guarantee, he has given
up his Eastern trip and will take
the Waseda team to Southern Cali
fornia. The team will leave Stan
ford about the middle of next week
and will probably remain in the
south until the first of June. They
are planning now to return to
Japan about June 15th.
