# Remarkable Class Statistics.
## 
### 
Owen S. Adams, '05, of the Col
lege of Social Science, University
of California, has compiled some
remarkable statistics concerning
the class which entered the State
University in 1901. These statistics
are very complete and minute, and
show the percentage of entrants
who graduate and also how college
activities influence college records.
Adams makes the following state
ment in explanation of the data:
"Frequently such questions are
asked as, What per cent of those
that enter college graduate with

their class? What per cent of the
technical students and what per
cent of the students from the
general colleges graduate? How
do the men and women compare in
the numbers that graduate with
their class? and Do college activities
tell on college records? With con
siderable care I have prepared
statistics of the class of 1905 which
will to a degree answer Buch ques
tions."
