# CORNERSTONE OF LIBRARY WILL BE LAID WITH FULL CEREMONY.
## Plans for the Function of Monday Completed by President Dibble of the Student Body. 
### 
ON Monday, May 15th, at
10:30 a.m., the laying of
the cornerstone of the new Li
brary will take place with ap
propriate ceremonies. Charles
G. Lathrop, treasurer of the uni
versity, and brother of Mrs.
Stanford, will handle the trowel
in the actual laying of the stone,
and Alexander Sherriffs,'os,will
read the dedication address writ
ten by Mrs. Stanford for the oc
casion.
This address, which is in the
form of a letter to the students of
the university, was written by
Mrs. Stanford in San Francisco
last January just before sailing
for Honolulu in the fear that she
would not return to America in
time for the ceremonies, which
were then set for Founder's day.
At that time she expressed the
wish that the letter be read by
Alexander Sherriffs,'os, and that
the cornerstone be laid by her
brother, Mr. Lathrop. Those
who have been privileged to

read this letter state that it con
tains much of vital interest to Stan
ford students, and one statement
especially which will greatly please
all of the university men and
women.
The program of the ceremonies
includes an address by President
Jordan, a speech by Melvin G.
Dodge, the university libraian; an
address by Rev. Cecil Marrack,'ol,
former president of the Associated
Students, who will represent the
alumni; and short speeches by D.
D. Sales, '06, and A. R. Fletcher,
'05, for the student body.
In the steel box that will be
placed in the cornerstone will be
placed a number of articles which
will serve to give the history of the
time and event of the dedication.
Among these will be an autographic
register of all the students attend

ing college at this time. Sheets for
this purpose will be placed at the
main desk in the University Li
brary, and at the Daily Palo Alto
office, beginning to-morrow morn
ing. All students are urged to sign
the paper aB soon as possible. The
box will further contain copies of
the Register for this year, the direc
tory of students, the schedule of
recitations, the Palo Alto town
papers, the San Jose papers, the

Palo Alto, the different addresses
made at the dedication, autographs
of the Library staff, and the forms
and cards used in the Library;
