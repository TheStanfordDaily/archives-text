# TO ENFORCE AMATEUR RULE.
## Athletic Authorities of Stanford and California Determined to Break Up Professionalism. 
### 
During the coming summer and
fall special attention will be given
by the faculty athletic committees
of the universities of California and
Stanford to the enforcement of the
recently amended intercollegiate
agreement regarding amateur
standing. The clause of the agree
ment defining amateurism is in
section 3, article 11. An amateur
is defined as being "one who has
not entered in an open competition
for a slake, public money, admis
sion money, or entrance fee; or un
der a fictitious name; or has not
competed with or against a profes
sional for any prize, or where ad
mission fee is charged; or who has
not instructed, pursued, or assisted
in the pursuit of athletic exercises
as a means of livelihood, or for
gain or any emolument."
As this agreement stood it was
practically worthless, since by its
definition persons playing against
or with professionals where gate
money was charged lost their ama
teur standing, and these conditions
were often filled by the ordinary
campus games with outside teams.
In January of this year the clause
was amended so that the agree
ment was no longer a''dead letter."
The amendment is as follows:
"However, no person shall lose
his amateur standing by playing
against a professional for any prize,
or where an admission fee is
charged, if it is done under the
auspices and bona fide control of
the university to which he belongs."
It is known that California will
keep a sharp watch this summer
for baseball men playing under the
conditions described in the agree
ment, and any players discovered
will be promptly dropped from the
list of eligibles for intercollegiate
games. The Stanford Faculty
Athletic Committee is also taking
steps to learn of all infringements
of the rule by communicating with
the various alumni clubs on the
Coast and warning their members
to be on the lookout. Neither uni
versity will grant any of its play
ers permission to play under con
ditions of professionalism during
the sumrher.
The rule is being rigidly enforced
already, and has caused the expul
sion of Heitmuller and Bliss of
California from intercollegiate ath
letics. Violations of the rule dur
ing past years have been passed
over because of the inefficiency of
the agreement, but the recent
amendment gives the athletic com
mittees full jurisdiction over the
college players. The chief reasons
for the ruling are that without it
intercollegiate athletics would be
come manifestly unfair with pro
fessionals playing with amateurs.
Another objection to the summer
baseball playing of college men is
that they associate with a class of
players whose standard of clean
and fair athletics is low.
