The outcome of the Freshmen's
long search for a suitable hat to
wear when they attain the dignity
of eophomoric standing must he re
garded with satisfaction by the en
tire university. The question that
troubled the Freshmen was not one
that concerned themselves alone,
for it interested every class. By
the action of the first-year men the
pretty,gray-handedred hat has prac
tically been established as the head
gear of every Stanford Sophomore
hereafter, aB the plug marks the
Junior and the sombrero distin
guishes the Senior. For this the
credit must be given to the present
Freshmen rather than to the first
wearers of the serviceable bonnet,
for it takes courage in a freshman
class to accept what its immediate
predecessors as freshmen have done.
We now have three class headgears
—the dignified Senior sombrero,the
serviceable Sophomore red, and the
ornamental — sometimes — Junior
plug. Right now would be an op
portune moment for the enthusi
astic under-classmen to get together
and find an appropriate hat or cap
to mark the man of 1909, and all
his successors in the privilege of be
ing Stanford freshmen. Such de
vices mark freshmen elsewhere, and
they are good things. It does no
man harm for it to be known that
he is a freshman, and the public
sign upon his head imposes re
straints which would probably save
many a freshman from those cere
monies which otherwise are neces
sary to make him a good freshman.
