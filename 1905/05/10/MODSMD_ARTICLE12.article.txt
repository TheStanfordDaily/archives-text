We would respectfully suggest to
the authorities of the gymnasium
that if possible the final contest to
determine the winner of the Storey
championship handball belt be
held Saturday morning, and that
the time be definitely announced
beforehand. There are many men
interested in the sport who would

be glad of the opportunity to wit
ness the final games, as was evident
la6t year, when almost a hundred
gathered in the gymnasium.
