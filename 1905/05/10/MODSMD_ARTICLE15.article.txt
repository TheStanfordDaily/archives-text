THE plans and arrangements for
the decennial alumni reunion
are fast taking shape, and the pro
gram promises to be one of the
features of commencement week.
From all indications several hun
dred graduates from all parts of
the country will return to Stanford
to attend the reunion and visit the
scenes of their student days. Many
of the football, baseball and track
heroes of the early days will be on
the campus for the first time
since their graduation. Everything
points to a most successful celebra
tion.
The graduation of the class of
1905 marks the decennial anniver
sary of the first regular class that
ever graduated from Stanford, and
this fact led the Alumni Associa
tion to plan for a reunion of all
Stanford alumni. The plans began
to be made in May, 1904, when at
the annual business meeting of the
Alumni Association, held on the

quad, it was decided to hold a
grand reunion of former Stanford
people on the campus during May,
1905. Carrying out this plan at
that meeting, President-elect W. J.
Neidig, '96, was authorized to ap
point a committee composed of one
member each from the classes of
'92, '93, '94, and two each from the
ten big regular classes. This com
mittee was to take general super
vision of the reunion arrangements.
C. M. Fickert, '98, was made chair
man.
Later Chairman Fickert an
nounced in the January Alumnus
that the large committee of twenty
three had been divided into three
smaller ones to better carry on the
work. The ten members living on
the campus and in the vicinity
were to constitute committee num
ber one. Their duty was to receive
the guests, and in preparation they
were to arrange for accommoda-,
tions, prepare entertainments, and
in general formulate the program
of events which would be held dur
ing the stay of the visitors. The
second committee, consisting of the
seven committee people residing in
San Francisco and Oakland, were
to receive the alumni there as they
passed through and arrange for
their accommodation. Also they
were to secure special railroad rates
if possible. The last group consti
tute a general publicity committee.
In San Francisco the committee
has secured rates of one and a third
on the Santa Fe and Southern
Pacific. Those desiring this rate
must pay full fares to the univer
sity, and after getting their tickets
signed here will secure the reduced
rate back.
