Dr. P. H. Olsson-Seffer, who has
been doing work as an instructor in
the Botany department for the past
two years, will leave Stanford in a
few weeks and go to Soconusco, one
of the southern provinces of Mex
ico, near the Guatemalan boun
dary, where he will spend three
months experimenting with the
Mexican rubber tree. Dr. Olsson-
Seffer has been engaged to under
take the work by the Zacualpa
Rubber Plantation Company, which
controls the rubber industry in the
southern part of Mexico.
While the starting of the work
will take only three months, it will
be carried on by the company for
the next ten years, and Dr. Olsson-
Seffer will return from time to time
to direct its progress. It will con
sist of a study of the hybridization
and selection of the Mexican rub
ber tree, with a view to developing
and expanding its possibilities, and
if the work contemplated is success
fully carried out, the result will be
of considerable commercial as well
as scientific importance.
