# HAT COMMITTEE APPOINTED.
## President MacSwain Names Men to Take Orders for Sophomore Headgear. 
### 
President Mac Swain of the Fresh
man class lias appointed the com
mittee to take charge of the pur
chasing and distribution of next
year's Sophomore hat. All tho√üe
who desire hats must hand in their
names to any member of the com
mittee before the end of this semes
ter. No other hats will be ordered.
The members of the committee are
R. Gartzmann, C. H. Raymond, G.
C. Coe, W. C. Theile and C. Per
kins, chairman.
At the meeting yesterday, several
other hats were presented by the
committee and received the votes
of a considerable number of the
members of the class. Among
them was a red felt hat and a hat
made of red leather. After consid
erable discussion, a final vote was
taken, resulting in the adoption of
the present Sophomore headgear,
the only difference being that next
year's hat will be of a better qual
ity to prevent its fading and losing
shape.
