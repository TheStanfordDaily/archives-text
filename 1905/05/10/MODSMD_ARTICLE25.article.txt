# CHANGES MADE IN METHODS.
## Students May Register for Two Hours in History and Economics Next Year. 
### 
The Register for 1904-05 contains
brief announcement of changes in
certain courses in Economics and
History whereby the student may
elect to take the regular three-hour
course or a shorter course of two
hours. The changes have been
made as an experiment in response
to many requests from other de
partments for courses in which less
work is required than is done by
major students, yet as much
ground is covered.
In Economics but one course has
been thus arranged. Next year
Economics majors will be required
to take the regular three-hour
course in Economics 1. This will
consist of two lecture hours and
one "quiz" hour each week, and the
supplementary reading. Other
students may take this course as a
two-hour course, attending the two
lectures each week, upon which
their examinations will be based.
In the History department three
courses are affected by the new rule,
English History 4a and 4b, Mod
ern European History sb, and His
tory 9, Westward Movement. With
the permission of their major de
partments, students may register
for two hours' credit in these
courses and be excused from sup
plementary reading. If the plan
works out successfully it will prob
ably become a permanent feature
of courses of instruction in the uni
versity.
