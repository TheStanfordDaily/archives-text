# Women Students to Meet.
## 
### 
To-morrow at 1:10 the women of
the university will meet in the
chapel to elect officers for the
Women's League for the coming
year. The meeting is of unusual
interest in that it is the first one
held under these circumstances.
The nominating committee has
previously to this sent in a report
with one name for each office. This
method has failed to bring out the
women to any considerable num
ber, and so this year for the first
time there will be a competition for

the various offices. The activity
among the women students during
the past year has been greater than
formerly, and it is hoped that dur
ing the coming year the Women's
League will he able to further this
phase of college life. The entire
undergraduate body of women stu
dents is urged to attend this meet
ing to-morrow and to help make
the work of the league a success
during the next year.
