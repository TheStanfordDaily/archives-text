# Head of the University Will Cross the Atlantic for the First Time in Fifteen Years.
## 
### 
AS soon as his work will permit,
Dr. Jordan, with Mrs. Jordan
and Miss Edith Jordan, will leave
for Europe, where he will spend his
summer vacation. The President's
object in making this trip is to
enable him to study systems of
control in the English and conti
nental universities, and inciden
tally to afford him a much-needed
rest from his labors. No definite
arrangements have as yet been
made. The party will leave the
campus as soon after the close of
college as possible. Their itinerary
will probably include Great Britain,
France, Germany, and Switzerland.
Dr. Jordan expects to return to the
university in time to resume his
regular work next semester.

This is the President's first trip
across the Atlantic since 1890,
when he climbed the Matterhorn.
Since then, however, he has made
many important scientific explor
ations which have carried him to
various parts of the western hemi
sphere. During the summers of
1896 and 1897 he was engaged with
the United States Fur Seal Com
mission in its work in the Behring
Sea. In 1900 he visited Japan
under the auspices of the Hopkins
Seaside Laboratory for the purpose
of studying the fish there. The
summer of 1901 saw him in Hawaii
carrying on the same kind of work.
The next year he visited Samoa,
and in 1903 the Alaska salmon in
vestigation engaged his attention.
