# "FIRST YEAR AT STANFORD."
## English Club's Book Will Be Sold and Distributed on Tuesday, May 16th. 
### 
"The First Year at Stanford,"
the book of sketches of early life at
the university collected by the
English Club, is now in the hands
of the binder. The book is consid
erably larger than was estimated
in the prospectus, consisting of 160
pages. It is printed on heavy,
rough-surfaced buff paper, the
initial letters of each chapter and
the decoration of the title-page be
ing printed in two colors. The
binding is of dark gray boards,
with vellum back. In the lower
right-hand corner of the front
cover is the English Club shingle,
used as a sort of book-plate. This
is deeply impressed in the boards,
and is done in red and gold, as is
the title above the shingle.
The illustrations —about a dozen
in number —are half-tone repro
ductions of photographs loaned by
members of the faculty, or prints
from plates belonging to the Univer
sity Museum. These views include
several pictures of the quadrangle
in course of construction, the earli
est one showing only rows of stone
lying on the ground now covered
by the buildings. Other photo
graphs are of the dedication of the
quadrangle on October 1, 1901; of
Encina Hall, then completed as
far as the eaves; of the inner quad
rangle completed, save for the
church, and with the round gar
dens only just planted with small
palms and stunted-looking shrub
bery; of the lake, of Escondite
Gottage and of the Frenchman's
tower.
This volume is unique among Stan
ford publications in giving reminis
cences of those early days of which
later classes know only vaguely by
tradition and by an occasional
sketch in the Junior annual. Most
of the articles in"The First Year
at Stanford" have successfully re
produced the atmosphere of the past
time with which they deal, and so
possess all the interest of a story.
This is especially true of the chap
ter by C. K. Field, '95, which de
scribes the life in the dormitories
during the first year, and of Mrs.
Elliott's account of faculty life dur
ing the same period. Dr. Angell's
article on the beginning of athletics
naturally deals with people rather
than with conditions, and gives
enough statistics to make his points
clear without causing the chapter
to lose its informal style. One or
two of the articles, however,include
names and dates of importance,and
may be used for reference.
The book will be ready for dis
tribution on May 15th, as an
nounced, but on account of Mon
day's being a university holiday it
has been decided to withhold the
book until Tuesday, the 16th. On
that day copies may be obtained at
the campus and Palo Alto book
stores; and at 10 o'clock a stand
will be opened on the quad. The
price is one dollar. Many mail or
ders have already been received from
faculty members and alumni to
whom copies of the prospectus were
sent. The edition is limited to 600
•copies.
