The Daily Palo Alto is in re
ceipt of a communication concern
ing the giving of examinations cov
ering the whole year's work in cer
tain university courses. The
communication we do not print
because it contains rather hasty
judgments, and the author has
agreed to this action. In general,
however, there would seem to be a
great deal of justice in his com
plaint. If our memory serves us
right. President Jordan lias more
than once publicly expressed him
self as not favoring examinations
covering long periods â€”this objec
tion, of course, not extending to
those scientific and law courses
where such examinations mean
everything and are necessary. But
beyond this, it has been the policy
of the university not to give exami
nations covering a year, or even a
semester, in those courses which are
recognized as "general culture"
courses. This policy does exist in
some Eastern universities, but in
these institutions, we believe, they
have regular examination weeks
during which all class work ceases.
The value of such examinations is
very problematical. It is simply a
matter of cramming, and the gen
eral effect of cramming is generally
to make us know less in the end.
No concession whatever in the way
of time is being made by those pro
fessors who have at the last mo
ment announced final examina
tions: they will talk to the last
hour. Is it not natural that the
author of the communication
should ask, "Do these men think
that we have no other work than
their own to do in this final stren
uous week?"
