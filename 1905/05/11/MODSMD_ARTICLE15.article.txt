# MANY STUDY ENGINEERING.
## Remarkable Increase in the Number of Men Learning This Science. 
### 
The rapid rise in importance of
the engineering profession, which
has taken place within a compara
tively short period, has nowhere
been more thoroughly appreciated
than at the University of Michigan,
says the Michigan News-Letter. As
the progress of industry has every
year attracted more and more
young men into the various
branches of engineering, the uni
versity has kept pace with the de
mand for more thorough instruc
tion. The result is shown by the
increased enrollment in the engi
neering department, of which Presi
dent Angell, in his annual report
to the Board of Regents, speaks as
follows:
"In the engineering department
the attendance rose from 609 in
1902-3 (which was a gain of 120
over that of the preceding year) to
823, an increase of 114. And at
this time there is a prospect that at
least 1,000 students will be regis
tered in the department for the year
1904-5. If this movement con
tinues for three or four years the
engineering students will equal, if
not surpass, those in the literary
department.
"And a similar tendency is ob
servable in all parts of the country.
Young men are in great numbers
seeking to train themselves in the
application of the sciences to the
practical arts, and especially to
those which we are accustomed now
to group under the general name of
engineering. The stronger techno

logical departments in the univer
sities are finding their resources
taxed to the utmo√üt to accommo
date the rapidly increasing classes.
"All this is due, no doubt, to the
calls which the recent extraordi
nary development of our manufac
turing industries is making for
young men competent to direct
them, and to the rapidity with
which the competent graduates of
those schools rise to well remuner
ated and responsible positions in
their professions. To make ade
quate provisions for the instruction
of these eager and ambitious stu
dents is a serious task for us and
other institutions. For all educa
tion, that in science and its appli
cation is by far the most costly.
We have been obliged to erect the
largest and most expensive build
ing on our grounds for the reception
of these hundreds of engineering
students, and the proper equipment
of it calls for an immense outlay.
"To aid in providing for this out
lay would be one of the most wel
come and appropriate means in
which some of our great industrial
companies, who are ultimately to
reap benefits from this training of
young men to assist them in their
work, could supplement the gifts of
the State."
