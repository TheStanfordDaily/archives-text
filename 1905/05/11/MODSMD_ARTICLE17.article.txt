# MEMENTOES FROM HAWAII.
## Feather Wreath and Plumes and Photographs of Stanford Funeral Cortege. 
### 
The Museum has received from
Honolulu a feather wreath and two
white feather plumes which were
placed on Mrs. Stanford's coffin by
the women of Hawaii. The feather
plumes, or Kahelis, are about four
feet long and are made of the rarest
and most costly feathers of birds
whose species are now practically
extinct. These plumes are mourn
ing badges used by the Hawaiians
only in honor of the dead members
of the royal family, but since the
change in the Hawaiian form of
government the feathers are also
used in honor of other dignitaries.
These Kahelis were presented by
Mrs. William Mutch in behalf of
the native women of Hawaii, who
considered Mrs. Stanford royal.
The white feather wreath is of
equal beauty and exquisite work
manship. It is composed of the
daintiest and rarest of white feath
ers. The wreath is about two feet
in diameter. This wreath is also a
mourning badge used by the na
tives. It was given by Mrs. K. R.
G. Wallace.
Representative Carl S. Smith,
Stanford '93, has sent a picture of
the funeral cortege leaving the
Congregational Central Church in
Honolulu. This will be placed
with the other mementoes from
Honolulu.
A photographic enlargement of
the departure of the funeral cortege
through the inner quadrangle, pre
sented by John McNaught, man
ager of the San Francisco Call, to
President Jordan, has been turned
over to the Museum.
H. J. Moors of Apia, Samoa, who
lastÂ§ year presented the Museum
with a number of rich Samoan tapa
cloths, last week sent a weapon of
shark's teeth used by the women of
Samoa.
H. C. Theobald, '00, of Batangas,
Philippine Islands, has just given
a complete model of a Philippine
loom and accessories. The loom is
an ingenious article, and shows
distinctly the intricacies of the
method of weaving as employed by
the Filipinos.
