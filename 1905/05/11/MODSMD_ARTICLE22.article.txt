# Permanent Class Secretaryship.
## 
### 
The class of 1905 will probably
not elect a permanent class secre
tary. The class has taken no
action in the matter, and it is
entirely probable that the custom
established by the Senior class last
year will be abolished. There will
be no meeting of the class before
class day, and President Trow
bridge states that he knows noth
ing about the matter.
