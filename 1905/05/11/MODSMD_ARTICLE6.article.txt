# BIG ALUMNI LUNCHEON.
## Graduates of Many Years to Gather Around the Banquet Table. 
### 
One of the most important events
on the program for the decennial
alumni reunion is the alumni
luncheon, which will be held in
Roble Hall Tuesday, May 23d, at
1 o'clock. The luncheon commit
tee has secured the services of
Charles K. Field,'9s, as toastmaster.
Mr. Field will deliver a toast
of welcome to the class of 1905. It
is not yet known who will respond

for the Seniors. C. M. Fickert, '98,
will preside at the luncheon.
F. J. Teggart, '94, librarian of
the Mechanics' Institute of San
Francisco, will respond for the
classes '92, '93 and '94 to the
toast "The Earliest Days." The
toast from the class of '95 will be
"Under the '95 Oak." The repre
sentative from the class of '96 will
have "The Laying of the Plate" for
his subject, and the class of' 97 will
respond to "The Tie that Binds."
The men who will respond to these
toasts have not yet been decided
upon, but it will be announced in
a few days. Mrs. Bonnie Burk
halter Fletcher, '98, will speak on
"The College Woman's Sphere";
T. T. C. Gregory, '99, will talk on
"The Warm, Warm World." For
'00 the topic is "Home Runs," and
for the class of '01, Cecil Marrack
will give a toast to "The Found
ers." The representative of the
class of '02 will probably respond
to "All the World a Stage." From
Miss Mabel H. Brown, '03, will come
"Verses," and Howard M. Lewis,
'04, is down for a toast on "The
Passing of the Snap." The con
cluding toast of the luncheon will
be given by President Jordan on
"The Alumni and the University."
While this program may seem
long, this will by no means be the
case. Each speaker will be asked
to confine his talk to three minutes,
and the toasts promise to be full of
interest. During the luncheon
there will be music, and the faculty
and all Seniors will be cordially
invited to come. The luncheon
will cost one dollar a plate and
will probably be held in Roble Hall.
One of the big events will be the

general reunion, on Monday eve
ning, May 22d, at 8 o'clock. There
will be refreshments and music,
and dancing in the latter part of
the evening. A feature of the eve
ning's program will be lantern
slide views of the university. These
views cover the period from the
time when there was only a box
car station at Palo Alto and a bare
row of houses on Alvarado, and
from the laying of the cornerstone
down to the present time. Besides
these views showing the growth of
the university, there will be others
showing football and baseball
games and other sports, including
some of the rushes in the early
da vs.
