# PROFESSORS PLAN VACATIONS.
## Anderson and Newcomer Will Divide the Next Year.â€”Effect on English Courses. 
### 
Professor M. B. Anderson and
Associate Professor A. G. New
comer of the English department
are planning for a vacation to be
spent abroad next year. Professor
Anderson has not decided definite
ly whether he will take a leave of
absence or not, but in case he does
so his absence will last for the first
semester. Professor Newcomer
will be gone from the university
during the second semester. He
expects to spend his vacation in
Europe, but as the time for his de
parture is over six months distant,
he has not made any definite plans.
Three years ago Professor New
comer was granted a leave of ab
sence, but upon his arrival at Lon
don he was obliged to return to
Stanford on account of the illness
of Professor Anderson.
The absence of these professors
from the university will be the
cause of several changes in the
courses offered by the English de
partment next year. Professor An
derson's courses in Milton (Eng
lish 23) and the introductory
course to Shakspere (English 24)
will be omitted from the schedule.
The graduate course in textual
criticism and interpretation (Eng
lish 29), which extends over two se
mesters, will be given in the sec
ond semester only. The lecture
course on nineteenth century es
sayists (English 14), which was
given by Professor Newcomer as a
two-semester course this year, will
be offered next year as a first-se
mester course. The course in
American literature (English 21),
which was given by Professor New
comer this year, will not be sus
pended next year, but the name of
the instructor who will conduct the
work has not been announced.
His course on the Nineteenth Cen
tury Poets (English 19) will be
omitted.
