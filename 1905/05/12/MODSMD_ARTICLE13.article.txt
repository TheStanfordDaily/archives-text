" The Business Office has declined
to open the Museum entrance free to
the returning alumni." — Extract
from news letter of a member of the
alumni reunion committee to the
Daily Palo Alto.
It seems almost incredible that
the Business Office should have
taken the stand indicated above.
The opening of the Museum was
one of the small courtesies that the
university might have been expect
ed to extend to the men and women
who after years of absence are re
turning to their alma mater to re
vive old memories, to feel again the
Stanford spirit and to carry it with
new vigor into their far-away
homes. It was one of those small
courtesies that would make the
alumni feel that they were at home,
and not merely visitors. It was a
small courtesy that would make
the Stanford undergraduates feel
that they were doing something for
the pleasure of those who had
spent years here before them.
The action of the Business Office
in demanding of the returning
alumni the entrance fee of twenty
five cents is merely one more indi
cation of the entire lack of sym
pathy of that department with the
spirit and ideals of the undergrad
uate body for which alone it exists
—the spirit and ideals taught and
fostered by the founders of the uni
versity, by its chief and by the
strong men who surround him.
It is this arbitrary and discour
teous policy of the Business Office
and its subordinates that has done
more than any other to kill the
spirit of loyalty to Stanford and to
send people away with harsh words
on their lips.
It is this policy of which we have
fresh evidence to-day. When the
Stanford men and women of yes
terday come back again and are
our guests, we of to day can but
bow our heads and hide the flush
in our faces.
