# SONG-BOOK ON SALE TUESDAY.
## "Decennial of Stanford Song" Will Be Distributed to Many Subscribers. 
### 
The"Decennial of Stanford Song,"
compiled by M. H. Thorpe, '05, is
now in the hands of the binders and
will probably be issued Saturday
night. The books will be distributed
on the inner quadrangle Tuesday
morning, May 16th, to those who
sent in their subscriptions before
hand. The subscription price is
$1.50. Only a limited edition has
been printed, and as the list of those
who have ordered the book in ad
vance is large, there will probably
be only a small supply of copies on
hand after the first distribution.
These will be placed on sale in Palo
Alto and will cost $2.50. The de
mand for the song-books has been
very large and many of the alumni
have ordered copies.
It was originally intended to have
the song-book ready for distribution
by May Ist, but the delay in obtain
ing the music for many of the songs,
and the fact that much of the litho
graphing had to be done in Phila
delphia, caused a postponement of
the volume's appearance.
The "Decennial of Stanford
Song" will contain 180 pages, in
cluding the words and music of all
the best Stanford songs which have
appeared in the past ten years.
There will be numerous drawings
illustrative of the various phases of
Stanford life described in the songs,
and the book will be a true and
faithful picture of life at Stanford
since the founding of the univer
sity. The need of a collection con
taining the words and music of the

best Stanford songs has been felt
for a long time. The small foot
ball song-books which are issued
annually by the student body do
not contain the music of any of the
songs.
Among the special features con
tained in the book are a song en
titled "Three Cheers" by C. K.
Field, here published for the first
time; a series of parody verses on
the "Son of a Gambolier" by 11. 1).
Walter, '00, and a special introduc
tion on the development of Stan
ford song by Archie Rice, '95. A
provisional list of the songs con
tained in the book will be found in
the issue of the Daily Palo Alto
for March 27th.
