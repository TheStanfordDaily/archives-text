# MUSICAL CLUBS' OFFICERS.
## Men Chosen to Manage the Combined Organizations During the Next Year. 
### 
The Combined Glee and Mando
lin Clubs held a meeting last night
and elected officers for the next col
lege year. Hugh Park, '06, was
elected president, and J. J. Hill,'oB,
secretary.
"Shingles" were awarded to all
active members of the clubs, and
those in possession of shingles will
not be compelled to take part in
future try-outs, but will be entitled
to their places without further com
petition.
Next year the clubs will show con
siderable improvement, as the loss
from graduation will be compara
tively light, and with the usual
amount of new material and this
year's training, a decided advance
should be made. A trip to the
southern part of the State is con
templated.
