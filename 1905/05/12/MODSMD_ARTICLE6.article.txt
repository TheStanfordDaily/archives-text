### 
Dr. Max Farrand, head of the
History department, will leave for
the East Sunday on his year's
leaveof absence. He will go straight
through to the Atlantic seaboard,
making but one short stop at Chi
cago. He will spend the time till
his return in carrying on research
work at Washington and Philadel
phia, completing his book on the
work of the Federal convention in
the formation of the constitution.
He will also give two courses at
Cornell University during the next
college year, a general course on the
westward movement of population
in the United States and a more
advanced course on the formation

| of the Constitution of the United
j States. These will he arranged,
however, so that they will not in
any way interfere with his other
work.
