# Strong Words of Mrs. Stanford Read at of New Library's Cornerstone
## Jewel Fund of Half Million Dollars for the Purchase of Books. 
### 
I DECLARE this stone to be
1 duly and truly laid." With
these words, pronounced by Charles
G. Lathrop as the big block settled
into place, the cornerstone of Stan
ford University's new Library was
laid this morning. The dedication
ceremonies were marked by sim
plicity and an impressiveness that
was keenly felt by the students
and members of the university
community present.
The exercises were opened with
an earnest prayer by Chaplain
Gardner, which was followed by
an address by President Jordan in
which he related in feeling words
the story of the Stanford jewels.
Then followed the most interesting
and, to the university community,
the most pleasing part of the pro
gram, the reading of the address to
the students of the University
written by Mrs. Stanford on Feb
ruary 14, 1905, while she was at
San Francisco preparing to leave
for her fateful trip to Honolulu.
Ia accordance with the wish of
Mrs. Stanford, the address was
read by Alexander Sherriffs, '05.
After expressing her regret that
on account of ill health she would
be unable to be present at the lay
ing of the cornerstone of the Li
brary, at which time she desired
her address to be read, Mrs. Stan
ford went on to say that she deemed
this a fitting opportunity to ex
press to the students some of her
ideas relating to the university
generally. Realizing that when
the new Library was completed it
would be far beyond the present
needs, Mrs. Stanford declared that
this building marked the last of
the "stone age," the era of building
in which she had persevered
through her deep interest in the
future success of the students, and
now attention could be turned to
the other needs of the university,
the internal needs, which had never
been lost sight of by the founders.
Each department must be equally
strengthened, each department
must be supplied with its much
needed books and apparatus. Mrs.
Stanford also laid stress on the de
velopment of the soul life, the spir
itual side of the nature of the stu
dents. The church and the school
must be drawn more closely to
gether.
After further commenting on the
healthy growth of the university,
and stating that it was not her am
bition to bring a large number of
students here, but rather to equip
well the small number in the uni
versity, Mrs. Stanford made pub
lic to the students her important
planß providing for the future
growth of the Library. A fund to
'he known as the "jewel fund" is es

tablished by Mrs. Stanford, the
yearly income from which is to be
devoted to the purchase of books
for the new Library. This fund is
to be endowed by the proceeds
from the sale of valuable jewels
owned by Mrs. Stanford. These
jewels, consisting of diamonds,
rubieß, emeralds, and other precious
stones, have an approximate sell
ing value of $500,000 —and when
this sum is invested, the "jewel
fund" will have a yearly income of
some $20,000.
The disposal of this sum will be
in the hands of a newly-established
Library committee of the Board of
Trustees, consisting of the follow
ing members: Horace Davis, T. B.
McFarland, C. P. Eells, G. E.
Crothers, Timothy Hopkins and
Leon Sloss. The sale of the jewels
will take place in the near future
and the fund definitely established
as soon as the money can be profit
ably invested. This new fund is
absolutely above and beyond the
annual appropriation made by the
university for the purchase of
books, and means that every year
the Library will be further enriched
by the purchase of twenty thou
sand dollars' worth of books.
Mrs. Stanford's Words.
The address written by Mrs.
Stanford follows in full:
"My health being somewhat im
paired, I am advised by my
physician to take a sea voyage to
Honolulu. 1 regret this absence,
as it was my desire to be with you
when laying the cornerstone of the
University Library. I deem this a
fitting opportunity to express to
you students a few of my views
concerning the condition of affairs
relating to the university generally.
"No one can realize more fully
than I the fact that the new Library
building when completed will be
far beyond our present needs.
Very many times I have pictured
to myself the large number of
spacious rooms, the immense stack
room which will accommodate one
million volumes, its large central

reading room which will seat over
three hundred students at one time,
and while this picture pleased me,
1 also saw the opposite side, the
need of very many books for the
different departments of study. I
fully and seriously realize how very
sparse our present number of books
will appear in the immensity of
space. We need books at present
more than anything else. My fond
est wish has been to live long
enough to give to you young stu
dents all the requisite buildings
planned by the founders, and the
erection of this Library building
marks the end of the material side
in which I have heen, for the past
eight years, so intensely interested.
But my love for the work so
sacredly entrusted to me and my
deep interest in the success of the
students urged me to persevere,
notwithstanding the other needs of
the universjty at large.
Great Importance of the Buildings.
" The 'stone age,' which has been
so frequently alluded to, no doubt
was irritating and tedious to some
connected with the university, but
to me the erection of these stone
buildings had a deep and impor
tant significance. These noble
buildings are not alone for the
present, but for ages to come, when
generations after generations have
passed and gone, and when, I hope
and pray, these buildings will still
stand and serve the purpose for
which they have been erected,
namely, for the benefit of the young
of our land who will still be com
ing here to gain an education, and
with time the required books will
also come. We are young yet —
only fourteen years old, a mere in
fant compared to grand old Har
vard and Yale.
Necessity of Having Books.
"I want each department to be
supplied with its much-needed
books. I deeply and fully appre
ciate what a well-selected and suf
ficient library means to a univer
sity. I also know with a grand
library we would be able to call to

our assistance the ablest and best
professors in the land, and our own
lionored professors could do better
work, and would lie happier with
the superior advantages. And the
advantages offered by a grand
library would draw to our far-off
shore here on the Pacific eager,
hungry students for knowledge,
from the East and West, just as
the Harvard law library attracts to
it enormous numbers who are fit
ting themselves for the profession
of law. It has the best and largest
in America. Johns Hopkins Uni
versity has the best and largest
medical library. I feel our de
ficiency more than I express.
Would Strengthen the Departments.
"I have not been so engrossed in
the 'stone age,' the material side, as
to ever lose sight of the spiritual.
Not at all. I have never lost sight
of all the internal needs, and I fully
realize there is much to be done to
bring the work here up to the ex
pectations of the founders. I would
like to Bee our various departments
more equally strengthened than
they now are, and I hope to see de
partments of philosophy and ethics
established,and other changes made
in the interest of the humanities.
Science must not overbalance the
humanities as at present. I would
like to see the spiritual side ad
vanced, to be equaled up to the
physical development. We must
not lose sight of the fact we are only
beginners and are learning from
our experiences what is wisest and
best for our students. In the de
velopment and success of the stu
dents my soul's interests are cen
tered; all else is only a means to
that end. If there is any one thing
more I could do that would better
them, make them stand out unique
as noble men and women, helping
their fellow men and women to live
exemplary lives, how willingly, how
gladly I would add all within my
power to bring it about.
Development of the Soul Life.
"I thing there is an interest that
could well be added, and I have de


Dew
Libr-ar-y
Building
as it- will
appear
w^en
Completed
plored its neglect in our work here
—that is, the development and cul
tivation of the soul life, the spiritual
side of the nature of the students,
which is by far one of the most im
portant factors to be roused and
educated. Without this we are not
much above the level of the animal.
It does not mean swaying or bend
ing the young mind toward theolo
gy, creedism.or religious sectarian
ism of any kind. It means only to
develop the soul-seed lying dor
mant, waiting to be watered, nur
tured, cared for, roused into life,
and when that is accomplished it is
then a monitor to tell us what is
right and what is wrong; for our
conscience, when once awakened,
never makes a mistake in admon
ishing us how to act.
Students and the Memorial Church.
"While addressing you at this
time I deem it wise to embrace the
opportunity of alluding to the work
of the Memorial Church. I have
the pleasure still before me of mak
ing a selection of a God-loving min
ister for the pulpit. I do not think
the minister will wish an assistant;
I hope he will not, but rather that
he would consider it a wise plan to
select students to assist him a month
at a time without compensation,
students selected from the seniors
who are willing to serve from love
of duty, two or three at a time if
need be. What better way to draw
church and school together? I
would like to see the time come
when no student would be willing
to graduate unless he had served
generously on the church commit
tee, and the helpers should not be
chosen from the Christian Associa
tion exclusively.
University education levels up a
student's standard of high honor
toward humanity; gives him abet
ter disciplined mind, makes him
more philosophical, which is good
and very apparent. But more is
needed. Evil is defined as un
developed good. Then let us strive
one and all here in this university
to keep awake this God-planted soul
germ, to develop evil into good.
Here we are free to act according
to our convictions and experiences.
We are not trammeled by old tradi
tions. Let us be guided always by
the purest and best motives that
actuate us for the benefit of the
young students who place them
selves under our care for develop
ment.
Healthy Growth of the University.
"I am pleased with the normal
healthy growth of the university,
and I must again reiterate that a
very large number of students is
not my ambition. I am anxious to
give the best possible in the way of
professors, teachers, books, all that
is requisite for each department in
the way of instruments, tools,
necessities of all kinds, —but there
should be a spirit of contentment,
watchfulness, carefulness, self-dis
cipline to help your neighbor if
disabled in any way, and there
should be respect for all that is
given you for your good. Above
all else, no wastefulness. Then
there will be pleasure in paying
attention to your needs, and our
work will grow and grow and God
will smile upon us.
Provision for Library's Growth.
"Before I close I wish to tell you
I have already made provision for
the future growth of the Library
by the following arrangement made
with the Board of Trustees. On
May 31st, 1899, I granted, assigned,

transferred, and conveyed to the
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, subject to cer
tain terms and conditions set forth
in the instrument conveying the
same, all my jewels, consisting of
diamonds, rubies, emeralds and
other precious stones, and directed
that the proceeds of the sale of said
jewels, or so much thereof as might
be necessary, he used in payment
for the erection and completion of
the Memorial Church, then about
to be st«rted. Excepting such as
were sold or otherwise disposed of
prior to the first day of June, 1903,
said jewels were manually delivered
to the board. I was subsequently
enabled to erect the Memorial
Church without the necessity of re
sorting to the sale of these jewels.
Jewel Fund Established.
"In view of these facts and of my
interest in the future development
of the University Library, I have
now requested the Trustees to
establish and maintain a Library
fund, and upon the sale of said
jewels, after my departure from
this life, I flesire that the proceeds
therefrom be paid into said fund,
and be preserved intact and in
vested in bonds or real estate as a
part of the capital of the endow
ment, and that the income there
from be used exclusively for the
purchase of books and other pub
lications. I desire this fund to be
known and designated as the jewel
fund.
"There has been created a Li
brary Committee of the Board of
Trustees, under the supervision of
which all such purchases should be
made. It is to give you pleasure I
tell you the story of the jewel fund.
"God bless you all, is ever my
prayer, for I well know prayer is
the key that unlocks the doors of
heaven to us all.
"Jane L. Stanford.
" San Francisco, California,
" February 14th, 1905."
