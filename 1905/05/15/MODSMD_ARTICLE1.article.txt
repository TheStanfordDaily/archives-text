# Strong Words of Mrs. Stanford Read at of New Library's Cornerstone
## Jewel Fund of Half Million Dollars for the Purchase of Books. 
### 
I DECLARE this stone to be
1 duly and truly laid." With
these words, pronounced by Charles
G. Lathrop as the big block settled
into place, the cornerstone of Stan
ford University's new Library was
laid this morning. The dedication
ceremonies were marked by sim
plicity and an impressiveness that
was keenly felt by the students
and members of the university
community present.
The exercises were opened with
an earnest prayer by Chaplain
Gardner, which was followed by
an address by President Jordan in
which he related in feeling words
the story of the Stanford jewels.
Then followed the most interesting
and, to the university community,
the most pleasing part of the pro
gram, the reading of the address to
the students of the University
written by Mrs. Stanford on Feb
ruary 14, 1905, while she was at
San Francisco preparing to leave
for her fateful trip to Honolulu.
Ia accordance with the wish of
Mrs. Stanford, the address was
read by Alexander Sherriffs, '05.
After expressing her regret that
on account of ill health she would
be unable to be present at the lay
ing of the cornerstone of the Li
brary, at which time she desired
her address to be read, Mrs. Stan
ford went on to say that she deemed
this a fitting opportunity to ex
press to the students some of her
ideas relating to the university
generally. Realizing that when
the new Library was completed it
would be far beyond the present
needs, Mrs. Stanford declared that
this building marked the last of
the "stone age," the era of building
in which she had persevered
through her deep interest in the
future success of the students, and
now attention could be turned to
the other needs of the university,
the internal needs, which had never
been lost sight of by the founders.
Each department must be equally
strengthened, each department
must be supplied with its much
needed books and apparatus. Mrs.
Stanford also laid stress on the de
velopment of the soul life, the spir
itual side of the nature of the stu
dents. The church and the school
must be drawn more closely to
gether.
After further commenting on the
healthy growth of the university,
and stating that it was not her am
bition to bring a large number of
students here, but rather to equip
well the small number in the uni
versity, Mrs. Stanford made pub
lic to the students her important
planß providing for the future
growth of the Library. A fund to
'he known as the "jewel fund" is es

tablished by Mrs. Stanford, the
yearly income from which is to be
devoted to the purchase of books
for the new Library. This fund is
to be endowed by the proceeds
from the sale of valuable jewels
owned by Mrs. Stanford. These
jewels, consisting of diamonds,
rubieß, emeralds, and other precious
stones, have an approximate sell
ing value of $500,000 —and when
this sum is invested, the "jewel
fund" will have a yearly income of
some $20,000.
The disposal of this sum will be
in the hands of a newly-established
Library committee of the Board of
Trustees, consisting of the follow
ing members: Horace Davis, T. B.
McFarland, C. P. Eells, G. E.
Crothers, Timothy Hopkins and
Leon Sloss. The sale of the jewels
will take place in the near future
and the fund definitely established
as soon as the money can be profit
ably invested. This new fund is
absolutely above and beyond the
annual appropriation made by the
university for the purchase of
books, and means that every year
the Library will be further enriched
by the purchase of twenty thou
sand dollars' worth of books.
Mrs. Stanford's Words.
The address written by Mrs.
Stanford follows in full:
"My health being somewhat im
paired, I am advised by my
physician to take a sea voyage to
Honolulu. 1 regret this absence,
as it was my desire to be with you
when laying the cornerstone of the
University Library. I deem this a
fitting opportunity to express to
you students a few of my views
concerning the condition of affairs
relating to the university generally.
"No one can realize more fully
than I the fact that the new Library
building when completed will be
far beyond our present needs.
Very many times I have pictured
to myself the large number of
spacious rooms, the immense stack
room which will accommodate one
million volumes, its large central

reading room which will seat over
three hundred students at one time,
and while this picture pleased me,
1 also saw the opposite side, the
need of very many books for the
different departments of study. I
fully and seriously realize how very
sparse our present number of books
will appear in the immensity of
space. We need books at present
more than anything else. My fond
est wish has been to live long
enough to give to you young stu
dents all the requisite buildings
planned by the founders, and the
erection of this Library building
marks the end of the material side
in which I have heen, for the past
eight years, so intensely interested.
But my love for the work so
sacredly entrusted to me and my
deep interest in the success of the
students urged me to persevere,
notwithstanding the other needs of
the universjty at large.
Great Importance of the Buildings.
" The 'stone age,' which has been
so frequently alluded to, no doubt
was irritating and tedious to some
connected with the university, but
to me the erection of these stone
buildings had a deep and impor
tant significance. These noble
buildings are not alone for the
present, but for ages to come, when
generations after generations have
passed and gone, and when, I hope
and pray, these buildings will still
stand and serve the purpose for
which they have been erected,
namely, for the benefit of the young
of our land who will still be com
ing here to gain an education, and
with time the required books will
also come. We are young yet —
only fourteen years old, a mere in
fant compared to grand old Har
vard and Yale.
Necessity of Having Books.
"I want each department to be
supplied with its much-needed
books. I deeply and fully appre
ciate what a well-selected and suf
ficient library means to a univer
sity. I also know with a grand
library we would be able to call to

our assistance the ablest and best
professors in the land, and our own
lionored professors could do better
work, and would lie happier with
the superior advantages. And the
advantages offered by a grand
library would draw to our far-off
shore here on the Pacific eager,
hungry students for knowledge,
from the East and West, just as
the Harvard law library attracts to
it enormous numbers who are fit
ting themselves for the profession
of law. It has the best and largest
in America. Johns Hopkins Uni
versity has the best and largest
medical library. I feel our de
ficiency more than I express.
Would Strengthen the Departments.
"I have not been so engrossed in
the 'stone age,' the material side, as
to ever lose sight of the spiritual.
Not at all. I have never lost sight
of all the internal needs, and I fully
realize there is much to be done to
bring the work here up to the ex
pectations of the founders. I would
like to Bee our various departments
more equally strengthened than
they now are, and I hope to see de
partments of philosophy and ethics
established,and other changes made
in the interest of the humanities.
Science must not overbalance the
humanities as at present. I would
like to see the spiritual side ad
vanced, to be equaled up to the
physical development. We must
not lose sight of the fact we are only
beginners and are learning from
our experiences what is wisest and
best for our students. In the de
velopment and success of the stu
dents my soul's interests are cen
tered; all else is only a means to
that end. If there is any one thing
more I could do that would better
them, make them stand out unique
as noble men and women, helping
their fellow men and women to live
exemplary lives, how willingly, how
gladly I would add all within my
power to bring it about.
Development of the Soul Life.

could well be added, and I have de
