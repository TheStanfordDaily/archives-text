Rev. Cecil Marrack, '01, former
president of the Associated Stu
dents and now assistant rector of
St. Luke's Church in San Fran
cisco, spoke for the alumni of the
university, lie said in part:
"We are indeed fortunate thus
to participate in the ceremony
which marks the beginning of the
latest and in a sense the greatest of
these buildings. In years to come,
each one of ub —loyal to Stanford —
students, alumni, professors — will
recall with gratitude our presence
on this occasion. The completion
of this edifice must mark the clos
ing of an era. The real age of pio
neers will then be over. That sense
of active partnership which comes
from watching the daily growth of
stone upon stone is ours, and ours
alone.
"About this building more than
any other will center the thought
life of the university. Within the
books upon its shelves will be gath
ered the intellectual harvest of the
ages. Its massive walls will stand
secure —a temple of truth, the con
crete expression of intellectual
force —a tribute to the power of
thought. The influence of this
library upon the future will be in
calculable. Hither will come the
students of distant generations to
gather the material for their study
and contemplation. By that ma
terial of thought will their charac
ter, their influence upon the com
monwealth, their destiny, be deter
mined.
"If the thought-force generated
here be of the highest, then here
shall a man gain the capacity to
rise superior to the changing cir
cumstances of daily life. If here
the thoughts obtained are true and
pure and strong and beautiful —if
the lesson learned here be a lesson
of thought-control—then here shall
a man win the mastery of his fate.
"The harvest is certain!
" 'Sow a thought, you reap an act;
Sow an act, you reap a habit;
Sow a habit, you reap a character;
Sow a character,you reap a destiny."
