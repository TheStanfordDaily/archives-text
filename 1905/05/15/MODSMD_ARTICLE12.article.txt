# UNDERGRADUATES SPEAK FOR THE STUDENT BODY.
## A.R. Fletcher and D.D. Sales Make Short Addresses at Cornerstone Laying. 
### 
Short addressee were made by two
students —A. R. Fletcher, '05, and
Dudley D. Sales,'o6 —as representa
tives of the student body. Mr.
Fletcher spoke in part as follows:
"As I listened to that letter of
Mrs. Stanford, bo benevolent, so
wise, and so noble, the thought
came to me more strongly than it
had before that this was an occa
sion both of great hope and of great
sorrow. Sorrow, because it would
have meant so much to Mrs. Stan
ford to be here with us to-day at
the laying of the last of our corner
stones. To her it would have been
a symbol of fulfillment, a symbol
of completion for a task that she
had already completed, for a work
that she had already so well done.
It is a sad thing to be denied a
symbol of fulfillment for work that
• l have already done. Men have
realized this. Moses led his
the promised land, con
their hardships, won all
es, and then he was de
-101 of completion which
into that promised
ve been to him. The
\as sunk into men's
ands of years. And
o is Mrs. Stanford's
long us to-day sad,
g of the last of our
time of hope, of
this building we
d some of the no
which to-morrow
; for us who are
\ Stanford Junior
occasion of hope
