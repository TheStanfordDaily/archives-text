# UNDERGRADUATES SPEAK FOR THE STUDENT BODY.
## A.R. Fletcher and D.D. Sales Make Short Addresses at Cornerstone Laying. 
### 
Short addressee were made by two
students —A. R. Fletcher, '05, and
Dudley D. Sales,'o6 —as representa
tives of the student body. Mr.
Fletcher spoke in part as follows:
"As I listened to that letter of
Mrs. Stanford, bo benevolent, so
wise, and so noble, the thought
came to me more strongly than it
had before that this was an occa
sion both of great hope and of great
sorrow. Sorrow, because it would
have meant so much to Mrs. Stan
ford to be here with us to-day at
the laying of the last of our corner
stones. To her it would have been
a symbol of fulfillment, a symbol
of completion for a task that she
had already completed, for a work
that she had already so well done.
It is a sad thing to be denied a
symbol of fulfillment for work that
• l have already done. Men have
realized this. Moses led his
the promised land, con
their hardships, won all
es, and then he was de
-101 of completion which
into that promised
ve been to him. The
\as sunk into men's
ands of years. And
o is Mrs. Stanford's
long us to-day sad,
g of the last of our
time of hope, of
this building we
d some of the no
which to-morrow
; for us who are
\ Stanford Junior
occasion of hope
which has been chastened and puri
fied by a recent sorrow.''
Mrs. Stanford's Last Gift.
Dudley D. Sales, '00, the second
representative of the student body,
made the final speech. He said,
in part:
"It seems particularly fitting to
me that the cornerstone of this
building, Mrs. Stanford's last and
most beautiful gift to the univer
sity, should be laid amid prayer
and song. The prayer is offered in
reverent thanks to our Creator that
we are privileged to he here and to
witness this day's ceremonies. The
songs are sung because we are glad
of such great privileges and be
cause we appreciate what this Li
brary will mean to those who will
be fortunate enough to enjoy its
benefits."
Mr. Sales then reviewed the his
tory of the Stanford Library from
its establishment in 1891 in the
rooms now occupied by the I,aw li
brary, up to the present day. In
conclusion he said:
"In a short time there will be
another movement toward a stale
of things that will he more pleas
ant and more useful than the one
left behind. That time will be
when the doors of this mag
nificent. building are thrown
open, with the proclamation that
he who seeks may find, and to him
who knocks it shall be opened.
That day, like this, will be a day
of thanksgiving."
