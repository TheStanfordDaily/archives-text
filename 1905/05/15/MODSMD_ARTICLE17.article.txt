# C.G. LATHROP SPEAKS.

### 
States that the Business Office Had
No Authority to Open the
Museum.
In a statement made to a repre
sentative of the Daily Palo Alto
to-day, C. G. Lathrop, the treasurer
of the university, declared that the
information was erroneous on
which the editorial regarding the
opening oi the Museum to the
alumni was based. He further de
clared that the Business Office has
no power either to refuse or to
grant a request for free admission
to the Museum, and that the mat
ter is entirely within the province
of the Board of Trustees.
G. E. Crothers, secretary of the
Board of Trustees, said that he had
been approached by a member of
the alumni reunion committee in
regard to opening the Museum free
during commencement week, but
the matter had never been officially
brought before the board. At the
time the request was made Croth
ers informed the member of the
committee that the grant of such
permission could not be made
without amending the trust which
governs the action of the Trustees
in university affairs. Such an
amendment would involve the re
cording of such action in all coun
ties where the university holds real
estate, and he did not consider
that the nature of the request
would justify the complicated legal
action which would be necessary to
make it valid.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Referring to your editorial of the

12th inst., the clause in the univer
sity trusts concerning the terms of
admission to the Museum is as fol
lows:
"The Board shall designate one
day in each week when the studeiits
at the university may visit the
Museum free of charge. All other
persons must pay an admission fee
of a quarter of a dollar for each ad
mission, except the President and
members of the faculty and their
families, and the Trustees andtheir
families."
Subsequently Mrs. Stanford pro
vided that the Trustees might, in
their direction, modify the trusts
relative to the terms of admission
to the Museum, but expressed her
opinion that it was very desirable
to maintain the requirements as
above indicated.
Yours respectfully,
Geo. E. Ckothers, '95.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the editorial in Friday's
Daily Palo Alto there are certain
points which seem to me open to
question. In the first place, it is
assumed that when the university
shows hospitality, the Business
Office must join in it. As I under
stand it, the business office of a
university can be no respecter of
persons. ""It cannot show favors
nor extend courtesies. It can only
receive money belonging to or due
to the university, and it can only
pay out money or release obliga
tions under directions from the
Board of Trustees. Whatever
gifts are made or favors shown
must be at the treasurer's own ex
pense, —and as a matter of fact our

treasurer has been generous with
his own money as he has been rigid
when the money of the university
has been concerned.
If our hospitality involves mak
ing free to our friendH the Museum
or the Inn or the railroad or any
thing else that costs money, let us
raise the money necessary, and
then we shall not hang our heads
in shame because some one else has
not done it for us.
