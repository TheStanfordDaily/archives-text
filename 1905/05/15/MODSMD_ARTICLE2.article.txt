# PRAYER FOR THE UNIVERSITY
## Rev. D.C. Gardner Asks Grace for Students, Teachers and Administrators. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner, rector
of the Memorial Church, deliv
ered the "prayer for the univer
sity" which he has spoken many
times before on special occasions.
It was as follows:
"Almighty God, our heavenly
Father, we beseech to bless
all institutions of learning through
out the world, and especially our
university and all its members and
benefactors. Establish it to all
generations to Thy honor and
glory, and to the cause of truth
and righteousness. Bring to it
whatever it may need to carry its
good designs into effect. To those
to whom are committed the duties
of administration and instruction
give Thy heavenly grace, that they
may perceive what things they
ought to do, and may also have
grace and power faithfully to ful
fill the same.
"And to those who are here to he
trained up for the work of the
world give a proper sense of the
dignity of life and the nobility of
labor; endue them with sound
mind and moderated desires; and
grant that they may so faithfully
labor in their day and generation
that when they are called to give
an account of their stewarship they
may not be found unprofitable ser
vants. Grant this, O Lord, for
Jesus Christ's sake. Amen."
