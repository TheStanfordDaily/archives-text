# President Jordan Tells Pathetic story of Mrs. Stanford's Box of Jewels
## Gems That Once Were Expected to Keep the Spark of Life in the University. 
### 
p RESIDENT JORDAN'S recital
I of "the story of ft box of jew
els" was pathetic in its interest
and was listened to in the deepest
silence. His words follow:
"It is for me to tell the story of a
box of jewels.
"There was once a man —a real
man, —vigorous, wealthy, powerful.
He loved his wife very much, for
she was worthy of his love, —wise,
loyal, devoted. And because of all
crystals in all the worlds the one
we call the diamond is the hard
est and therefore sparkles bright
est, and because the ruby is charm
ing and the emerald gentle, the
man bought them all and made
them a gift to his wife.
"As the years went on, they lost
their only child, in the glory of his
youth. Then these two became
very lonely and they longed to
help other children. And so they
bethought themselves of the ways
in which their wealth and power
could aid the youth of future gen
erations to better and stronger life,
—the men and women who are
children now, or who will be chil
dren after these have passed away.
"They Shall Be My Children."
"And because they lived in Cali
fornia and loved California, and
because California loved them as
she loves all children of men, this
man said, 'The children of Cali
fornia shall be my children.' And
so they were; and that they might
be so in very fact, he built for them
a beautiful castle in Spain, with
cloisters and towers and red-tile
roofs against the azure sky,—for
skies are bluest in the heart of
Spain. And this castle is theirs
alone, for it belongs to all who
have once entered its doors. And
the Castle of Hope, which they
called the university, was the ful
fillment of the dream of years, a
dream of love and hope, of faith in
God and good will toward men.
"And as the years go on, many
things came to pass. In the ful
ness of days the man died, the
power he bore had vanished, and
his wealth was scattered, so that
the work he began seemed likely
to fail, and the devotion of many
weary years was necessary before
all could go on again as the man
had planned it.
" Still the Jewels Are Left."
"Hut'the children of California
shall be my children.' That word,
once said, was never unsaid, and
the doors of the castle, once opened,
should never be closed. And the
man's wife said: 'If we lose the
farms and the railways, the bonds
and mortgages, still the jewels are
left. The university may be kept
alive by these till skies may clear,
and the money which was given to
the future might fall into the fu
ture's hands.'
"And to me, whose fortune it
was to help in those days, she said:
'We shall keep the university open.
When there is no other way, you
shall have my jewels.'

"And because there still was one
last resource, she never knew de
feat. No one can, who strives for
no selfish end. 'God's errands
never fail,' and her errand was one
of good will and mercy. When we
ask how the university survived
the panic of 1893, the picture
comes to me of this sorrowful, he
roic woman going alone to London,
with a bag of jewels carried in her
own hands, that she might sell
them to the money changers who
flocked to the Queen's Jubilee.
Sad, pathetic mission, fruitless at
the time, but full of all promise
for the future of the university,
thus founded on faith and hope
and love, the trinity, St. Paul tells
us, of the things that abide.
"People said that the university
was sustained in these days from
the founder's private purse,because
it seemed to have no other visible
means of support. But there was
no private purse. All was given to
the cause, and more than all, for
more than all visible strength was
the power of love and devotion.
The Jewels Brought Back Again.
"But the jewels were not sold in
London, —only a few of them; and
these few helped to place a roof
of real tiling on the Assembly Hall
and on the old Library instead of
the old tiling of iron, which was
all those trying days could afford.
All the rest found their way back
to California again. They saw
better times. A noble church had
been erected, one of the noblest in
our land, —all a part of the beauti
ful dream castle which we call our
university. It lacked only the
warmth of ornamentation, the
glory of the masters who wrought
'when art was still religion,' and
who thus adorned the cathedrals of
St. Mark and St. Paul. So the
jewels were sold by the university.
They were bought by her who had
given them, and their cost was all
spent in the exquisite mosaic work
which even the precious stones of
Venice cannot outrival.
"And now once more the stones
have been given to the university.
They are yours to-day as the whole
university is yours, the enduring
possession of all of you who may
tread these fields or enter these
cloisters. And so they are yours
thrice over, in the quadrangle, in
the doors which never were closed,
in adornment of the church, which
shall be to all generations of stu
dents a joy and rest and a refining
agency, and last of all they find
their resting place in this Library
building. You shall soon hear the
way in which this comes about, but
you shall never live to hear the
last of the waves of influence which
find in these jewels their first im
pulse.
Lesson of Faith, Hope, and Good Will.
"They say that there is a lan
guage of jewels, but I know that
they speak in divers tongues, their;
speech depending on the place in
which they fall. Sometimes dia-1
monds tell strange tales, but not j

these diamonds. You can read the
language of diamonds and rubies
and emeralds in these stones, the
lesson of faith, hope, and good
will. This is the language they
speak to us. They tell us how
Stanford was founded in the love
of things that abide.
"In a letter to Mr. Crothers,
dated San Francisco, February
15th, referring to Mr. Alexander
Sherriffs of the Senior class, who
had then commended himself to
her, she says: 'I would like the
young student to read this letter
on the occasion of the laying of the
cornerstone of the Library. 1 have
selected him, as I thought it would
please him to be so selected. It
surely will give me pleasure to have
him accept..'"
