# HUMBLE BEGINNING OF UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.
## Melvin G. Dodge Tells the Story of the Gathering of the Collection Through Years. 
### 
Associate Librarian Melvin G.
Dodge gave in brief outline the his
tory of the University Library from
its humble beginnings in the sum
mer of 1891, when it contained
3000 volumes and was housed in
what is now the Law library in tbe
inner quadrangle, up to the present
day. Librarian Dodge said, in part:

41 Eighteen years ago to within a
day the cornerstone of the Leland
Stanford Junior University was
laid,'the first of a series,'as Judge
Sawyer expressed it, 'for the use of
the university.' To-day the uni
versity is still young, though if we
understand aright the words of
President Jordan the stone age is
nearly over, the first epoch is ap
proaching its close, and the day of
cornerstones is past. Although a
memorable occasion in the annals
of the university, this ceremony
also marks an era in the history of
the University Library. I have
chosen, therefore, to review briefly
some of the events in connection
with the past of the Library.
"On the day of opening, October
1, 1891, there were on the shelves of
theLibrary three thousand volumes.
They were located in room 2 of the
inner quadrangle, the present Law
library. In the short space of
fourteen years that number has in
creased to 85,000. The lot which
formed the nucleus had been col
lected during the summer of 1891
after the time that the first librar
ian, Edwin 11. Woodruff, had been
appointed. Mr. Woodruff at the
time of his appointment was
librarian of the Fiske Library in
Florence, Italy. He arrived in
California in July and at once
began the work of forming a uni
versity library. It is interesting to
note tbat tbe first two books for
mally recorded were presented by
Dr. Jordan and were two of his own
authorship. Many more of the
next score and more were given by
Professor Anderson and other mem
bers of the new faculty. The end
of the first year saw this number of
books increased to eight thousand
volumes (fully half of which were
gifts), an increase that with a
slight raise has remained about the
yearly average during the years
since.
" In 1896 Mr. Woodruff resigned
his position as librarian to accept a
teaching position at Cornell Uni
versity. Herbert C. Nash, former
secretary to Mr. Stanford,succeeded
him, continuing in office until re
moved by an untimely death in
June of 1902.
"The building of which we lay
the cornerstone to-day will be the
third library building. The cor
nerstone of the second, a structure
presented by Thomas Wei ton Stan
ford, was laid November 2, 1898.
Fourteen months later the building
was ready for use. On January 19,
1900. the books were moved to their
new quarters where so many of you
undergraduates have worked and
read. On the day mentioned
classes were dismissed, and two
hundred and fifty students carried
from the old room to the new stacks
the entire main portion of the gen
eral library. This was done under
the supervision of Mr. Babine, then
associate librarian.
"I must also mention one other
episode in the history of our Library
which is unique in library annals.
No catalogue of the books had been
made as late as 1898. On Septem
ber 4th of that year a force of
seventy-eight volunteer students
made a working author catalogue
of an important part of the Library,
some twelve thousand volumes.
Many amusing mistakes were made,
but for four years this catalogue
served as a useful, although occa
sionally a misleading, guide to the
contents of the Library.
"In his address of October 1,
1891, Senator Stanford said that
the 'students are the most impor
tant factor in this university.' This
factor it is the policy as well as
pleasure of the Library to recognize
and to assist in every way possible.
It seems to me eminently fitting
that on this occasion it was arranged
that you should have charge of the
program. You are much in evi
dence, and you ought to be. I
trust that for you the day will
never come when you will find
through any fault of yours or of
others any serious bar to the use of
the books which some day will be
placed in this building."

with the past of the Library.
"On the day of opening, October
1, 1891, there were on the shelves of
theLibrary three thousand volumes.
They were located in room 2 of the
inner quadrangle, the present Law
library. In the short space of
fourteen years that number has in
creased to 85,000. The lot which
formed the nucleus had been col
lected during the summer of 1891
after the time that the first librar
ian, Edwin 11. Woodruff, had been
appointed. Mr. Woodruff at the
time of his appointment was
librarian of the Fiske Library in
Florence, Italy. He arrived in
California in July and at once
began the work of forming a uni
versity library. It is interesting to
note tbat tbe first two books for
mally recorded were presented by
Dr. Jordan and were two of his own
authorship. Many more of the
next score and more were given by
Professor Anderson and other mem
bers of the new faculty. The end
of the first year saw this number of
books increased to eight thousand
volumes (fully half of which were
gifts), an increase that with a
slight raise has remained about the
yearly average during the years
since.
" In 1896 Mr. Woodruff resigned
his position as librarian to accept a
teaching position at Cornell Uni
versity. Herbert C. Nash, former
secretary to Mr. Stanford,succeeded
him, continuing in office until re
moved by an untimely death in
June of 1902.
"The building of which we lay
the cornerstone to-day will be the
third library building. The cor
nerstone of the second, a structure
presented by Thomas Wei ton Stan
ford, was laid November 2, 1898.
Fourteen months later the building
was ready for use. On January 19,
1900. the books were moved to their
new quarters where so many of you
undergraduates have worked and
read. On the day mentioned
classes were dismissed, and two
hundred and fifty students carried
from the old room to the new stacks
the entire main portion of the gen
eral library. This was done under
the supervision of Mr. Babine, then
associate librarian.
"I must also mention one other
episode in the history of our Library
which is unique in library annals.
No catalogue of the books had been
made as late as 1898. On Septem
ber 4th of that year a force of
seventy-eight volunteer students
made a working author catalogue
of an important part of the Library,
some twelve thousand volumes.
Many amusing mistakes were made,
but for four years this catalogue
served as a useful, although occa
sionally a misleading, guide to the
contents of the Library.
"In his address of October 1,
1891, Senator Stanford said that
the 'students are the most impor
tant factor in this university.' This
factor it is the policy as well as
pleasure of the Library to recognize
and to assist in every way possible.
It seems to me eminently fitting
that on this occasion it was arranged
that you should have charge of the
program. You are much in evi
dence, and you ought to be. I
trust that for you the day will
never come when you will find
through any fault of yours or of
others any serious bar to the use of
the books which some day will be
placed in this building."
