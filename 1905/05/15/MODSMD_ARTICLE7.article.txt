The dedication of a new library
building is an event of prime im
portance to any university com
munity. And Stanford men and
women must take peculiar pleasure
in the ceremony which they wit
nessed this morning. The comple
tion of the library building will
mark the end of the "stone age,''
and the age of growth and develop
ment in equipment and faculty has
but begun. Yet aside from the sat
isfaction which must be felt as this
great building rises to completion
is the greater joy that in the plan
ning of the library Mrs. Stanford
gave expression to her last and
abiding interest in the university
and the men and women who com
pose it. Her letter to the students,
written so shortly before her depar
ture for Honolulu, must certainly
be considered among her ablest con
tributions to the molding of the
university. Stanford men and
women did not need to hear this
valedictory in order to know of the
interest of Mrs. Stanford in their
every need, but it will be a source
of joy to them that it exists among
the records of the university. And
the jewel fund will be one of the
most prized of endowments.
There are many features of this
remarkable letter which will prove
of real interest to the community.
The desire of Mrs. Stanford that
the university should develop the
humanities as well as the sciences
will meet with general approval.
Her wish that Stanford should not
be a big university, but a great uni
versity, is a sound one. And the
completion of the "stone age" makes
this achievement possible. With
the development of the library
through the jewel fund and the
regular university appropriations
will come the strengthening of many
of the departments which must give
tone to the whole endeavor. But
this is a question of the future â€”the

students of to-day will find a pe
culiar satisfaction in the expression
of the interest of the late surviving
founder which to-day has been
manifested.
