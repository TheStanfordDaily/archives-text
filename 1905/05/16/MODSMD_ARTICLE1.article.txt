# THE
						CARDINAL WILL HAVE A STRONG TEAM ON THE GRIDIRON
## Loss of Players Will Be Felt, but Their Places Will Be Well Filled. 
### 
NEXT fall for the first time in the
history of intercollegiate foot
hall the big game will be played on
the Stanford campus. At the same
time it will witness the beginning
of J. F. Lanagan's three-year term
as head coach, and the continuation
of a system of coaching which may
now he said to have become a per
manent fixture at Stanford. The
University of California has defi
nitely decided to abandon the grad
uate coach system, and if that col
lege is successful in procuring the
service* of a competent Eastern
coach the game next fall will pro
vide a splendid means for compar
ing the relative merits of the two
systems.
California Has Many Veterans.
In attempting to forecast the com
parative merits of the two teams
which will oppose each other on the
Stanford gridiron, the advantage
seems to lie with California on ac
count of the veteran team of eleven
men who are still eligible to com
pete for the State University. But
it must he remembered that they
are the veterans of an inferior team
which has suffered a decisive defeat.
The Stanford men who are eligible
to represent the Cardinal have
learned more than the rudiments
of a system of play which proved
successful against the best teams
west of the Rocky Mountains. An
other blow to the Blue and Gold
hopes is their loss of Heitinuller,

whose splendid punting saved his
college from an even more severe
reverse. According to the recent
rule adopted by the Intercollegiate
Athletic Committee, Heitinuller was
rendered eligible for one more sea
son of football, but the later action
of the California faculty athletic
committee, which declared him a
professional, will bar the great
punter from further participation
in amateur athletics.
Stanford Loses Strong Players.
It is certain that Stanford will
lose some of its strongest players,
and it is possible that some whose
return was confulentlj' expected
may not be back. The Cardinal is
practically assured of a veteran
back-field. E. P. Stott, '07, who
so brilliantly filled Bansbach's
place after the veteran little quar
ter was compelled to retire from
the game, will return to college and
should experience little difficulty
in holding his place.
By the new intercollegiate ath
letic agreement \V. H. Dole, '05, is
rendered eligible to again represent
the Cardinal on the gridiron, but
this reliable half-back graduates,
and he has not definitely decided
whether or not he will return to
college next fall. It is quite prob
able that he will return for gradu
ate work.
A. J. Chalmers, whose whirlwind
line-bucking was the feature of the
big game, will be in his old posi
tion at right-half. M. J. Weller,
'07, the great full-back, asserts that
he will not play football even if he
returns to college next semester,
but it is safe to say that his name
will appear in the Stanford line-up
if he is registered in the university
during the football season.
Strong Men for Vacant Places.
There are several promising sec
ond team players who might make
acceptable substitutes for any of
these back-field veterans. Among
them are J. F. Crow, '07, who made
a reputation for himself by the
long bucks which he made through
the Colorado line, and R. H. Rook,
'06, who played a fast game at half
in several of the preliminary games.
.T. F. Brennan, '07, was the most
consistent ground-gainer in the
second team back-field last season,
but it is said that he will not play
football again.
Good Ends Will Be Needed.
For several seasons the Cardinal
teams have had excellent ends, but
it now looks as if the coach will
experience some difficulty in pro
curing good men for this position.
G. H. Clark, ex-'O5, captain of last
year's team and one of the best
ends that ever played on this

Coast, is barred from further com
petition by the operation of the
four-year rule. R. F. West, ex-'O6,
played end for the first time last
year, but it is not probable that he
will return to college next semester.
G. W. Smith, ex-'O6, who played
end in the 6-6 game, will prob
ably be in college next semester to
try for his old place on the team.
J. N. Stanford, '06, was shifted
from half to end on the second
team early in the season and
played the position in good style.
It is not improbable that some
of the numerous candidates for
back-field positions may be shifted
to the ends. Dole has become es
pecially notable for his defensive
work, and on account of bis speed
he is a logical candidate for the
end position if such a shift should
be considered necessary.
Tackle Positions Will Be Strong.
It is at the tackle positions that
the Cardinal team will be excep
tionally strong. W. K. Sprott, '06,
captain of the team, will hold
down his old place at left tackle.
H. Shields, '05, the right tackle, who
so successfully opposed the formid
able Heitmuller, graduates, and
will not return. To take his place
the most likely man is H. L. Hor
ton, '08, who proved conclusively
in the Colorado game that he is of
Varsity caliber.
Center Positions Uncertain.
In the middle of the line the

coaches are confronted by the same
difficult question that they faced
last season. The problem of find
ing an efficient center trio may be
simplified by the possible return of
Hyde and Thompson to college
next fall. Both of these men
graduate, but there is a chance
that both may return for graduate
work. W. K. Roosevelt, ex-'O5, is
not in college this semester, but be
fore his departure he signified his
intention of returning next year.
T. Van Sickle, '05, will return, and
under ordinary conditions he would
make an acceptable substitute for
any member of last year's center trio,
but the arm which he broke in the
Colorado game may keep him from
the gridiron.
With the players who are sure
to return and with the certainty
of new material from the entering
class, Stanford ought to be repre
sented by a team which will dedi
cate the new gridiron with a bril
liant Cardinal victory.
