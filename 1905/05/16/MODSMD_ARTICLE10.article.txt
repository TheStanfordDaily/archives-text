# "EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR."
## Final Production of the Play Given by the English Club at Berkeley. 
### 
The English Club gave its third
production of '"livery Man in his
Humour" in the Greek amphithea
ter at the University of California
Saturday. The audience was small,
but the acting of the Stanford stu
dents was warmly applauded. Lit
tle difficulty was experienced by
the players in adjusting themselves
to the strange conditions of the
open-air theater, and although not
so satisfactory as an indoor per
formance, the production was a de
cided success.
The net proceeds of the play will
be divided between the English Club
of Stanford University and the Uni
versity of California Club-house
Loan Association. One-half of the
amount due to the English Club
wiil be given by that body to the
Stanford Boat Club. It is probable,
however, that after deducting the
expenses of the cast and the cost of
advertising and printing little sur
plus will remain.
Thus far the play has scarcely
been a financial success, the two
productions given on the campus
netting but a small amount over
expenses. A large part of the ex
pense of the play was forlthe print
ing of the book, "Elizabethan
Humours," and during the last few
days the sale of this book has be
gun to assume generous propor
tions. Paul Elder and Company,
the printers, have themselves taken
one hundred copies and will sell
them at their own risk.
