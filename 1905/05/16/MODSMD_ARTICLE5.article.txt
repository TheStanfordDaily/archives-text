One of the greatest dangers that
a football coach has to deal with is
overconfidence on the part of the
general college public, which in
variably affects the team in similar
manner. The first thing that Lan
agan did last year when he took
charge of the Stanford team was to
beat down the spirit everywhere
that the game was won before it
was played. He had to keep up
the struggle continuously, but he
was equal to the task, and finally
he turned out a team that was
ready to fight for every ounce that
was in it. The game was played
and won so easily that the impres
sion became general that the Car
dinal must surely be victorious
again the next season. But any
one who reads the facts pre
sented by the Daily Palo Alto
to-night must recognize that the
conditions which will exist at
the opening of the season in Sep
tember will not be so rosy as they
were immediately after the game
last year. We lose strong men by
graduation or other causes, and
others of the best men of the team
may not again be in college. The
whole situation is in a state of un
certainty. We have strong material,
and the class of 1909 may bring us
more. And we have a coach who
instills the fighting spirit. With
these things we ought to win, but
we must fight for our success, and,
especially, we must guard against
overconfidence.
