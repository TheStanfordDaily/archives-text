# MEMORIAL DAY SERMON.
## Dr. Clampett Pays High Tribute to the Memory of Mrs. Stanford. 
### 
"The Mercy of Christ" was the
subject of Rev. Dr. F. VV. Clam
pett's memorial day sermon,
preached Sunday. Dr. Clampett
referred feelingly to Mrs. Stanford's
death in the course of his sermon,
and praised the noble ideals of her
life. He said, in part:
" There is no phase in the char
acter of Christ that appeals to the
great mass of mankind with more
enduring force than that which
might be termed the kind and mer
ciful side. The gospel narrative
literally teems with unpolished
stories that portray in their simple
beauty the Christ of infinite ten
derness. His life was lived for the
redemption of His fellows, and yet
the very men for whom He was
prepared to suffer all things slan
dered Him, ill-treated Him, be
trayed Him, and finally crucified
Him, and the being who thus suf
fered was the personification of
kindness toward His fellows.
"And now we come to the impor
tant idea of Christ's conception of
the relationship of man to man.
This conception may be summed
in the simple sentence: 'Non-judg
ment, based upon mercy.' Now it
must be apparent that this ques
tion of mutual relationship of the
claims and responsibilities of life
to life should be placed in the very
forefront of our Christian faith.
Whether my voice this day comes
within the range of those whose
studies will hold them yet for years
to come within this university, or

of those who graduate here for the
post-graduation of the outer world,
the final test of whatever religious
life you may possess will be found
in your application of the golden
rule.
"Sacred as has been this me
morial service in the history of
Stanford University, it is deepened
and enriched this day in the light
of another life translated. Never
again can the memory of the boy
Leland be separated from that of
consecrated motherhood. On a
marble slab in the cemetery of the
home from which I come a widowed
mother inscribed over the grave of
her only son these words:
" 'Sly God hath taken mine only son
from me,
'My God hath given His only son for me.'
" Mrs. Jane Stanford had spoken,
and therein was her foundation of
hope. From that fountain she
drank of the waters and valued
their preciousness. There she re
ceived the inspiration that linked
the memory of her child with this
vast monument. As the genera
tions pass and this center of learn
ing radiates to wide areas, men will
tell the story to their children of
the deed of a noble woman, a ver
itable heroine, who lived for a sin
gle, supreme purpose â€”struggled in
the dark hours, struggled inces
santly, struggled in the intuitive
faith which is woman's God-given
heritage."
