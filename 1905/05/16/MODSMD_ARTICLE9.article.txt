# ENGLISH CLUB BOOK OUT.
## Heavy Demand for "The First Year at Stanford," Especially by Alumni. 
### 
"The First Year at Stanford,"
the book recently published under
the auspices of the English Club,
was placed on sale to-day. The
advance mail orders for the book
have more than met the expecta
tions of the committee which had
charge of the publication of the
volume, and with the advent of the
alumni for the reunion, the first
edition will be exhausted.
The book was compiled for the
purpose of preserving the story of
the early struggles of the university,
but does not presume to be a com
prehensive history of that period.
Most of the articles in the book
convey vivid impressions of the
trials endured by the pioneer fac
ulty members and students, and
this impression is intensified by a
number of excellent half-tones. The
first article, "Early Days at Stan
ford," by David Starr Jordan, is a
brief but highly interesting account
of the selection of a faculty for the
newly-founded university. Some
of >the names mentioned by the
president are familiar to the present
undergraduates, while others are of
men whose connection with the uni
versity ended long ago.
The second story is a breezy ac
count of "The Beginnings in Palo
Alto" by Eleanor Pearson Bartlett.
The present thriving college town
is described as a mere hamlet in
the midst of a vast wheat field. In
"The Cornell Colony at Palo Alto,
Ellen Coit Elliott writes a delight
fully reminiscent story of the (lis

comforts which fell to the lot of the
faculty members of the young uni
versity.
Dr. Frank Angell'a ''Early His
tory of Athletics at Stanford" be
trays a knowledge of the subject
which could only come from inti
mate acquaintance with the pioneer
athletics. Thoße who take the pres
ent development of sport at Stan
ford as a matter of course will be
astonished at the primitive manner
in which intercollegiate athletics
were conducted.
Perhaps the most interesting
Btory is "Letters Home," by C. K.
Field, '95. The extracts are from
actual letters which were written
home by occupants of Roble and
Encina halls. Field's sympathetic
treatment of the letters giveß a
vivid insight into the daily life led
by the pioneer student.
Two articles by Francis J. Batch
elder, '04, "Early Life at the Uni
versity Outside the Dormitories"
and "Early Organizations at Stan
ford," are valuable accounts of the
social diversions and college inter
ests of the early student. "The
Frenchman," by B. S. Allen, '06, is
a brief account of the eccentric
Peter Coutts, who formerly owned a
great part of the present campus.
"The San Francisquito Rancho,"
by R. P. Ballard, '97, is a compre
hensive history of the early Span
ish grant which was finally incor
porated into the Stanford estate.
