A VISIT TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY
HIS handsome little book is
printed on heavy cream
colored paper. It gives a
concise and graphic ac
count of the foundation and
early history of the University, with
short sketches of the lives of the
Founders; describes the Quadrangle,
the Memorial Church, all the main
buildings, and takes the visitor to
numerous points of interest in the vi
cinity, including Frenchman's Lake,
Lagunita, the Stock Farm and the
Stanford Residence.
The descriptive matter is illus
trated by nearly one hundred half
tones and line cuts.
At the end is a brief tribute to the
memory of Mrs. Stanford, with a re
cent photograph. There is a two-page
map of the Campus and a relief map
of California.
The cover design, an effective
sketch of the new gateway, is printed
in colors on a buff ground. "A Visit
to Stanford University" makes a
charming souvenir for the graduate
or alumnus, and is a reliable guide
for the tourist.
The price is one dollar. It is on
sale at the bookstores and at the
printing-office."
