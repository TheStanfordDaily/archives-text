# WORK ON ATHLETIC FIELD.
## Grading and Building of Bleachers Will Be Pressed During the Summer Months. 
### 
During the summer months the
work that has been begun on the
athletic field will be continued as
rapidly as possibly. Thus far only
grading has been done, several
roads and part of the field being
completed. The grading contract
was let for the entire field, includ
ing the football, baseball, and
track reservations. It will take
some time for the contractors to
complete this amount of grad
ing.
Work will be begun shortly on
the erection of the football bleach
ers. The contract has not yet been
given, but it is probable that this
contract, along with that for the
building of baseball and track
sites, will be let very soon by the
Training House Corporation. It
is intended to first complete the
football field, then erect the base
ball bleachers, and in the fall put
in the new track. Just how far
the work will be carried will de
pend on the financial state of the
corporation after the summer work
is over.
The plans for the fields as drawn
by Professor C. B. Wing of the En
gineering department have the
football and baseball fields adjoin
ing, with the track opposite, across
a forty-foot road. Under the foot
ball bleachers in the middle of the
west end, the training quarters will
be built, and will be used by foot
ball and baseball men, and also by
the track athletes. A porch will
lead to the entrance of the training
quarters, which will consist of two
duplicate sections, one for the
home players and one for the visit
ing team. Each section contains
two rooms, and will be connected
with a general reception room.
The training quarters will be fur
nished with modern appliances and
arranged for the greatest possible
convenience.
The football bleachers as planned
are five feet higher than the bleach
ers at the new California field, and
the seats will be two inches wider.
They will be rounded at the end so
as to afford a good view of the field.
The seating capacity will be about
fifteen thousand.
