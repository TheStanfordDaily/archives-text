The students of Stanford Univer

Professor Charles Benjamin Wing
of the Engineering department for
the work which he has done in con

The drawing of the plans and
specifications for the great bleach
ers that are to he erected lias been
done by Mr. Wing without charge,
and this is a task that cost the Uni
versity of California many hun
dreds of dollars. The generosity
of Mr. Wing will not soon be for
gotten.
