On Friday the Varsity and
Freshman crews will leave the cam
pus, and before the university sees
them again they will have met the
universities of California and
Washington on the water. The
struggles of the Boat Club to over
come the difficulties that lay in
their path have been severe and

deal to aid them; but there are
none here who do not wish them
the greatest success on their north
ern trip.
