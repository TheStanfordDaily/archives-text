# MEETING WILL BE LIVELY.
## Important Propositions to Be Laid Before Alumni at Annual Meeting. 
### 
THE annual business meeting of
the Alumni Association Tues
day promises a lively time. There
will be an open fight for the offices
which heretofore have gone without
contest, and it is possible that there
will be a verbal war over the con
duct of the Alumnus. A number
of the San Francisco alumni have
during the past year expressed
themselves as dissatisfied with what
they termed the apathy of the
officers of the association, and it is
believed that these men will come
to the annual meeting prepared to
demand that more life be put into
the organization. The things that
these men are going to propose are
set forth in the following circular,
an advance copy of which has been
