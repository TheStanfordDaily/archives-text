Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Not long since in the columns of
the Daily Palo Ai/ro you pub
lished a short news item about the
movement which is on foot to build
a monument to the late Mrs. Jane
Stanford. In this item were two
or three statements which were just
the contrary to the facts of the
case. The impression circulated by
your item is that the people of San
Jose are going to build this monu
ment. Now this is not the case at
all. The people of San Jose have
no more to do with the movement,
as the people of San Jose, than
have the people of New York City.
The idea of the movement is to
have the people of the country erect
this monument.
A great many letters have been
sent to Stanford students, as we
thought they should be the first to
be given an opportunity to start
the fund. I might also add that
up to date the results have been
very satisfactory. If you could
correct the statement about the peo
ple you would greatly aid the move
ment. Max Wassman Jr.,
Secretary Mrs. Stanford
Monument Fund.
