# Big Handicap Field-Day.
## 
### 
On Decoration day, May 30th, a
great handicap field meet will be
held at the Emeryville race track
under the auspices of the Reliance
Athletic Club of Oakland. There
will be valuable prizes in the form
of cups for every first place, and
other inducements will be offered
to draw a large number of entries.
The event is fully sanctioned by the
Pacific Athletic Association.
It is not yet definitely known
what Stanford men will compete
in this field-day. L. M. Edwards,
'07, will probably enter the 100-
yard dash, and J. 0. Miller, '08, is
expected to compete in some event.
All the amateur athletes of the
State will be eligible, and it is
probable that Hall, the Oakland
High School high jumper, and sev
eral other preparatory school ath
letes will take part.
