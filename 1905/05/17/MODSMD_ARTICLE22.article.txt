# MANAGER ABE GRATEFUL.
## Expresses Appreciation of the Treatment Accorded Waseda Team at Stanford. 
### 
Before leaving Stanford for the
South, Manager Abe of the Waseda
baseball team, gave out the follow
ing statement:
"On behalf of the Waseda team
I desire to express our appreciation
of the kind and considerate recep
tion which has been accorded us at
Stanford. Before we reached here
we were somewhat in doubt as to
how we would be received by the
Stanford students, but we were soon
put at our ease on that point. We
desire especially to thank Manager
Barrett and the men of the Stan
ford baseball team for their kind
ness in allowing us the use of their
diamond and for the help which
they have given us in many other
ways.
" I am very well satisfied with
the showing made by the team.
We came here knowing that we had
still much to learn about the game,
and we hardly expected to make as
good a showing as we did. If we
are ever able to return to Califor
nia again, I hope that it will be
with a stronger and more skilful
team which will be better able to
cope with the California univer
sities. In conclusion, I desire to
say that if it ever comes about that
a Stanford team shall visit Japan,
we hope to be able to repay in some
small measure all that has been
done for us here.
"Iso Abe,
"Manager Waseda Baseball Team."
