# FARCE TO-MORROW NIGHT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF SENIOR WEEK.
## "Kidnaped" Will Be Given in the Assembly Hall. Audience to Join in the Chorus of the College Songs. 
### 
SENIOR week festivities will be
opened to-morrow night when
the Senior class will present the
farce, ''Kidnaped," in Assembly
Hall at eight o'clock. Earnest
work has been put on the play for
the last few weeks, and there is
every indication that the presenta
tion will be a successful one. The
farce, written by R. S. Harris, '08,
is of the old-style order, depending
for its success on its local color and
personal hits. The scenes for the
four acts that make up the farce
are laid on the quad and at a hut
neariFrenchman's Lake. The story
that is told may be summed up
thus:
Professor Wizyuns of the de
partment of Social Ethics at Stan
ford, believing that education is
the true cure for criminality, brings

to the university a number of con
victs from the State penitentiaries.
The convicts kidnap the chief of
the student fire department, but in
turn all are captured by Professor
Pipe of the department of Psy
chology, who is jealous of Wiz
yuns and his experiments, and are
detained in a hut near French
man's Lake. From here they are
rescued by the gallant fire depart
ment. Wizyuns and Pipe are
reconciled and the convicts are
taken to a more congenial atmos
phere â€”the University of Berkeley.
During the intermissions the or
chestra will play oidy Stanford se
lections, and it is the desire of those
in charge that the audience join in
and sing the college songs. Every
effort will be made to make the
production a Bort of "jolly-up."
