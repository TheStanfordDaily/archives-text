# WEEK OF WORK AND PLEASURE FOR THE SENIORS AND ALUMNI
## Commencement Exercises Will Be of Unusual Interest. 
### 
THE program which is to be fol
lowed during the festivites of
the coming commencement week
includes a large number of inter
esting features, and some that ap
pear for the first time on the
Senior week program. The grad
uating exercises of the class
of 1905 will lie especially note
worthy and memorable owing
to the coincident meeting of the
alumni, the first decennial reunion
of Stanford graduates yet held.
For the first time the solemnity
that forebodes the coming depart
ure of the Seniors during Senior
week will be mingled with an at
mosphere of gladness owing to the
return of many hundred men and
women whom Stanford sent forth
during her first ten years.
Another feature in the program
is one that marks by its presence
another step in the development of
the university as an institution.
Monday afternoon the first of the
annual public meetings and ad
dresses of Phi Beta Kappa will take
place in the chapel, Prof. Ernest
Carroll Moore of the University of
California delivering the address.
Saturday will be taken up with
the usual features, which consist of
the Faculty and Senior baseball
game, President and Mrs. Jordan's

Hall. Sunday morning the bac
calaureate sermon will be delivered
in the Memorial Church by Rev.
S. B. L. Penrose of Whitman Col
lege, and in the afternoon a special
vesper service will be held by Rev.
1). Charles Gardner.
