# GOOD WORK OF THE Y. M. C. A.
## Employment Bureau Has Secured Positions for a Large Number of Persons. 
### 
It has been the custom of the
Young Men's Christian Associa
tion in past years to publish a
brief report of the year's work at
the close of the spring semester.
Probably no part of the work is
of such general interest as that
of the employment bureau, which
is under the supervision of the
social service committee. The
bureau has assisted eighty-three
men in getting work this year, of
whom fifty-five secured positions
for the year. The estimated value
of the work secured for the entire
year is $6,400.
In connection with this it may
interest some to know that there
are 235 men in college who are
working their way in whole or in
part, of whom 182 secured work
through the employment bureau at
some time during their university
course. Five men have been as
sisted from the loan fund in charge
of this committee this year.
There have been fewer Bible
classes this year than last, owing
to the unusual number of class
leaders lost by graduation last
spring. It is the policy of the
Bible study committee to have only
cempetent men lead classes, so that
efficiency may not be sacrificed to
mere numbers. Two classes for
Japanese have been very success
fully conducted and well attended
throughout the year.
The membership of the associa
tion has this year reached the high
est point in the history of the

association, being at preeent 206.
In this report something should
be said with reference to the pro
posed association building,of which
some mention was made about two
months ago. The project has been
temporarily delayed on account of
difficulties in securing a suitable
location. It is hoped that this can
be satisfactorily arranged soon, and
that the Stanford association may
some day be equipped for service
to the university community as
those in other great universities
are.
H. F. Henderson, '06, will take
up the work as general secretary
next year, and it is hoped that he
will have the hearty cooperation
of all interested in the association
work.
