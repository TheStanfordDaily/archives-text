# FOIL AND MASK REVIVED.
## Old Fencing Club Reorganized and New Members Will Keep It Active. 
### 
Foil and Mask, the fencing club
of Stanford University, was re
organized at a meeting in Encina
Hall last night, when eight new
men were elected to membership.
The reawakened interest in fencing
has led to the revival of the club,
which practically passed out of
existence about two years ago. The
idea of again forming a club was
formulated about a week ago and
led to a special meeting of the
members of Foil and Mask who are
yet in college. These members
voted in eight new men, and the
reorganized club met last night
and elected officers as follows:
President, J. L. Choate, '06; treas
urer, P. E. Millar, '06. The club
is now composed of the following:
J. L. Choate, '06, P. E. Millar, '06,
D. M. Reynolds, '05, F. Lane, '05,
