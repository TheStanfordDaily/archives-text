Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The May Alumnus haß come forth
with a suggestion for the solution
of the eating problem at Stanford.
While this is no new problem, it
was on the way to be solved when
the Inn was built. As yet the Inn
has not been given a fair show.
No one manager or club has stayed
with it long enough to work out
any definite policy of management.
The men of Encina nearly all eat
in clubs at College Terrace. The
fact that they are willing to walk
so far and eat such plain food
shows that they would be easily
satisfied with plain, wholesome
food. If Mr. Tait or any one else

would serve the students with board
at $15 or $16 per month he would
get seventy-five per cent of the men
who now board at the Terrace, pro
vided the food was as good as that
which the average club serves,
which could be easily prepared at
the Inn.
The Encina men will offer a
strong objection to having the
club-room turned into a dining
room, and we hope that the Busi
ness Office would do the same. The
Inn is the solution of the eating
problem, and some day the stu
dents will awake to the fact and
put it on as strong and satisfactory
a basis as the Bookstore.
