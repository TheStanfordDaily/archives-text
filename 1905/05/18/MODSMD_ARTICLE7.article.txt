With the exception of the com
mencement number, to-night's issue
of the Daily Pai.o Alto is the last
of the present semester. In ending
his work the editor has but words
of thanks to speak—thanks to the
members of the staff and to the
members of the university. No
editor of the Daily Palo Alto
could desire the help of a more
loyal or conscientious staff, and
whatever degree of merit the paper
may have had must be attributed
largely to the industry of these
men. With the members of the
university community generally t he
relations of the Daily Palo Alto
have been most cordial, and the
editor has the deepest gratitude for
the innumerable courtesies that
have been extended to him and to
the members of his staff.
Mr. Weinmann, the incoming
editor-in-chief of the Daily Palo
Alto, requires no introduction. He
has won his place on the merit of
his work. If he receives from the
university the same amount of help
and goodwill that has been the for
tune of the present writer, his path
must be easy, and at the end of his
term he must lay down his pen
with a keen sense of regret that he
cannot longer serve so fine a lot of
men and women as those who make
up the student body and the faculty
of this great university—''the
youngest and best."
