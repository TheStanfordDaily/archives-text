Keep Your Eyes on Palo Alto
THE HOME CITY OF CALIFORNIA
When the Pioneer Class graduated ten years ago Palo Alto was a struggling little
town just incorporated, and with a population of less than one thousand people.
There was no electric light plant, no cement sidewalks, and no city water-works,
no improved streets, and but few good houses. Ten years have wrought a marked
change. The city owns its own water and light plant, over thirty miles of concrete
sidewalks have been laid, and extensive street improvements are well under way.
The average cost of dwellings erected during the past year was $3,500. The pop
ulation is 5,000 people. Values of real estate have increased with the population,
but for the most part prices are still low. We quote below a few investments
