# Class Day Exercises in the Chapel the First of the Formal Ceremonies
## Trust of Placing Flowers at Stanford Tomb on Sundays and Memorial Days Transferred to the Junior Class. 
### 
formal festivities marking the observance of Senior week began
Monday morning, when the class day exercises were held in the
chapel and in the arcade before the Memorial Church. The attendance in
the chapel was unusually small, but those who were present listened with
interest to the address of the class president and to the reading of the class
history and the class will.
An interesting feature of the occasion was the transferring to the
Junior class of the trust of placing flowers upon the Stanford tomb each
Sunday and upon every Stanford memorial day. This custom was in
augurated by the Senior clafs shortly after the funeral of Mrs. Stanford,
and the trust will be handed down each year by the outgoing Senior class
to its successors.
