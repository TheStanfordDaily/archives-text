# PREACHES BACCALAUREATE SERMON
## President Penrose of Whitman College Speaks of the Benefits of Receiving and Giving the Best. 
### 
THE baccalaureate sermon was
delivered in the Memorial
Church Sunday morning before a
large crowd. The baccalaureate
preacher was Rev. Stephen Beasley
Linnard Penrose, D. J)., president
of Whitman College, Washington.
The speaker took no text, but made
use of several texts successively in
developing his theme that the pri
mary secret of success is receptiv
ity. Starting with the phrase of
Paul, "the simplicity that is in
Christ," he asserted that it was a
mistranslation and should be ren
dered "right-mindedness, or the
right mental attitude, toward
Christ," a new definition of what it
means to be a Christian.
Interpret the word "mental"
broadly as including intellect, feel
ing, will, the whole psychical life.
Men differ in their conception of
the Christian life as they over-em
phasize one or the other of these
three factors of a full mentality.
What is the right mental atti
tude? Open-mindedness, or recep
tivity, which was what Paul meant
by "faith." It is the first lesson of
life, whether in citizenship, or edu
cation, or in religion. Open the
doors and windows of your soul,
and "let the blessed sunshine in."
The trees and flowers are preaching
this to us all the while, that to
grow it is necessary to receive. No
flower was ever so foolish as to try
and lead a self-sufficient life. Let
the roots of your life go deep down
into the soil of God; let the
branches and tendrils of your be
ing take in the blessing of shower
and sunshine.
But from whom shall we receive?
"I fear lest your minds be corrupt
ed from the right mental attitude —
the attitude of receptivity —towards
Christ, ... in whom are hid
all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge." Jesus Christ is the
source of spiritual life, the fountain
of grace, the giver of power. The
Bible is an exposition of the treas
ures hid in him. The New Testa
ment contains a seven-fold inter
pretation and the fifth gospel mani
fests his glory. Any philosophy is
inadequate which forgets him in
its interpretation of life. The new
birth, the grace given to the saints,
the power of the church's heroes,
come from him. Prayer is commun
ing with him, receiving from him.
The Lord's Supper is a symbol of
pure receptivity. "By grace are
ye saved through faith, and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of
God."
Members of the Graduating
Class: I have urged upon your con
sideration the first deep lesson of
life, Receive. Let me conclude for
you with the second, Give. "Free
ly ye have received, freely give."
Receive the best, then give the
best. God forbid that any one of
you should refuse to receive, or
that you should give your worst to
the world. Receive from Jesus
Christ life, grace, and power, then
give these to the world and so be
come its saviors. "The God of all
grace, who hath called us into His
eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after
that ye have suffered awhile, make
you perfect, stablish, strengthen,
settle you. To Him be glory and
dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
