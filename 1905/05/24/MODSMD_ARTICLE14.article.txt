# EVENING SERVICES IN THE MEMORIAL CHURCH
## Rev. D. Charles Gardner Speaks on the Desirability of Living a Temperate Life. 
### 
Special services were held in the
Memorial Church Saturday evening,
and were well attended. Rev. D.
Charles Gardner spoke on the need
of living a clean and temperate life.
He said in part:
"In one of the prayers used often
in our services there is a petition
which I want you to make your own.
It is this: that we may hereafter live
a godly, righteous, and sober life.
By a sober life is meant a temperate,
serious life. You have been taught
the necessity of temperance in meat
and drink. The more difficult task
is to learn to be temperate in speech,
in temper, in pleasure, in ambition.
' The tendency to excess in speech,
in work, in luxury, in pleasure, in
the use of stimulants and narcotics,
is most marked in any land where
men and women are high strung.
We need in these days to learn the
old gospel â€”self-reverence, self
knowledge, self-control. These are
the elements of a well-poised charac
ter. Be temperate in all things.
Remember that you cannot eat or
drink, or dance or work to excess
and not suffer. We hear so much
in these days about having a good
time. God knows I would not rob
youth of any lawful pleasure. I love
fun. I love amusement. But I
dread to think of the sort of fun and
pleasure which makes men and
women forget home and honor, pa
rents and principles. But there is
no bravery in gambling, or drink, or
lust, or intemperance of any sort.
And it means moral ruin as sure as
death. Learn now, in these forma
tive years, the habit of self-control.
In your social life, in politics, in
business, have a mind, a will, a con
science of your own.
"Let us sum it all up by saying
earnestly: The godly life is not a
gloomy life, as some of you imagine.
It is bright with the sunshine of love,
sweet with the joy of service. The
elder among you will testify to that
fact. And the righteous life is not a
snug, self-complacent existence. It
is a constant state of moral discipline,
a constant endeavor to be square
with all men. And lastly, the sober
life is the simple life, simple and sane
and serious, because we recognize
that we are not mere creatures of
sense, but spiritual beings, made in
the image of God, put here to do
God's will, waiting, hoping, believ
ing in the fruition of our life not only
here, but in the life of the world to
come.''
