# WARM MEETING OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.
## Report of the Executive Committee Approved After a Fight. Officers Chosen. 
### 
AT 11:45 Tuesday morning the
annual meeting of the Stan
ford Alumni Association was held
in the university chapel. It wa6
originally planned to hold the
meeting in room 2, but the seating
capacity of that place was not ade
quate for the large crowd gathered
to witness the most exciting meet
ing in the history of the association.
Never before have the members of
the association shown such keen
interest in its affairs. For some
time there has been considerable
friction between two factions in the
association, and the feeling which
has grown up between them caused
the discussion to become rather
warm.
The question at issue finally re
solved litself into an effort on the
part of a majority of the executive
committee to secure the adoption of
a report vindicating their conduct
of the affairs of the association.
This report, which was read by Dr.
R. L. Wilbur, '96, commented at
length upon the affairs of the as
sociation and the action taken by
its various officials since the last
annual meeting. It highly com
mended the work of C. F. Wright,
'96, secretary-treasurer of the or
ganization, praising especially his
efforts in connection with the re
cent publication of an alumni di
rectory. In answer to the criticism
that the officials have been lax in
their efforts to collect alumni dues,
the report declared that certain
exigencies render the collection of
this outstanding fund practically
impossible. While expressing ap
proval of the revival of interest in
the Alumnus, the report expresses
its disapproval of the editorial
policy of the alumni organ, asserting
that it does not express the general
sentiment of the organization.
This report was signed only by
Dr. Wilbur. F. J. Teggart, '94, at
once objected to its adoption on the
ground that it was not a valid re
port of the executive committee.
This objection precipitated a gen
eral discussion, which was finally
ended by the formal adoption of
the report as it stood.
During the progress of the meet
ing A. B. Rice, '95, editor of the
Alumnus, rose to defend his con
duct of the affairs of that publica
tion. In his talk he scored the
former secretary-treasurers of the
association for their failure to col
lect alumni dues. He asserted
that the circulation of the official
alumni organ had been greatly in
creased and it had been put on a
paying basis since he became edi
tor.
In declining a renomination to
the executive committee, Dr. H. B.
Reynolds, '96, took occasion to say
that the report read by Dr. Wilbur
had not been submitted to him for
his signature and he did not desire
to go on record as approving it.
The following officers were elect
ed: President, Dennis Searles, '95,
of San Francisco; first vice-presi
dent, Scott Calhoun, '95, of Seattle;
second vice-president, C. G. Mur
phy, '00, of Portland, Or.; third
vice-president, Miss Ethel Foster,
'04, of Panoche, San Benito county;
secretary-treasurer, C. F. Wright,
'96, Stanford University; executive
committee—S. W. Collins, '95, of
San Francisco; Dr. R. L. Wilbur,
'96, of Stanford University; Dr. T.
M. Williams, '97, of Palo Alto.
The only contest was over the of
fice of president. F. J. Teggart,
'94, of San Francisco was nomi
nated by E. L. Brune, '01, but was
easily defeated by Searles, who was
nominated by C. R. Lewers, '96.
After the business the annual
alumni luncheon was held in the
Roble dining-room. Monday eve
ning Itoble gymnasium was the
scene of a delightful reception,
where the old graduates renewed
former friendships. Vesper service
in the Memorial Church Tuesday
afternoon ended the great decennial
reunion of Stanford alumni.
