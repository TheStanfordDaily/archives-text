THE exercises in the chapel be

ident Alfred Lockwood Trowbridge,
who said:
" Friends and fellow classmates:
On behalf of the graduating class
of 1905 I extend to you, friends
and alumni of our university, a
most cordial welcome to our exer
cises of Senior week. May these
days of reunion on the tenth anni
versary of the graduation of the
illustrious pioneer class be one of
the brightest memories of your
lives. The credit for such success
as may attend our efforts to enter
tain you must be laid at the doors
of the various committees, the
members of which I wish to thank
for their whole-hearted endeavors
in that direction.
"To you, fellow classmates, 1
offer my hearty congratulations on
the successful completion of your
work of the past four years —years
which must ever seem of the best
that we have lived. We have seen
many additions to the magnificence
of the university since we came
within its walls. It has been our
sad fortune to witness the passing
away of the great and good woman
who was one of the founders of this
institution. It has been our sacred
privilege, of which we will retain a
dear though sad memory, to assist
in laying her mortal remainsto rest.
"It is with a feeling of regret
that we note the near approach of
the event which marks the end of
these pleasant and profitable years.
But mingled with this feeling is
one of satisfaction in a work well
done. Above all, we are deeply
thankful for the opportunities
which have been offered us —oppor-
tunities not only for knowledge
gleaned from books, but, better by
far, for personal contact with men
and women of the faculty whom
we may well strive to emulate in
our future lives. For such oppor

tunities we cannot in words
adequately express our gratitude.
Worthy we must prove ourselves
by our future conduct. Let every
man and woman of the class of
1905 go forth, then, with a firm de
termination to show this worthi
ness; to have ever in mind our
responsibility as keepers of the uni
versity's good name, and to make
ourselves so useful in the work of
life that to all with whom we come
in contact may be clearly proved
the truth of the sentiment ex
pressed in the lines:
" 'The world can't lose a Stanford man,
Nor down the Stanford spirit.' "
