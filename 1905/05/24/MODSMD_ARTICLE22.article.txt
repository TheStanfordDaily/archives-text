# CLASS PLATE LAID BEFORE MEMORIAL CHURCH DOORS
## P.D. Swing Delivers the Oration and President Jordan Accepts the Gift. 
### 
AT the conclusion of the cere
monies in the chapel the crowd
moved over to the arcade before the
Memorial Church for the laying of
the class plate. The oration was
delivered by Phil David Swing,
who said:
"We have gathered here to wit
ness the laying of the '05 Senior
plate. We are to lay this plate
partly as a memorial to a class,
which as a class will soon cease to
exist. There may come times in
the future when men and women
who once were members of this
class will reassemble, just as men
and women once members of other
classes are reassembling to-day.
But such reunions will not be for
the continuing of the existence of
the class, but rather for reviving its
memory; such meetings will not be
for new undertakings, but for the
recital of things done in the past.
So it is fitting that we who, during
the four years past, have learned to
love the class of 1905, should give
some public avowal of our regard
and perpetuate the name around
which will ever cling the pleasant
est memories of our lives. For this
purpose, custom has fixed upon a
bronze plate. We lay it that all
classes to come may know that
members of this class were proud
of the name of 1905; that all the
world may know that we have
learned the first lesson of patriot
ism: to be loyal to our own.
"But there is a deeper signifi
cance attached to this occasion
than merely perpetuating the name
of a class whose deeds soon will
live only in the memory of those
who did them. After all, the most
important thing is not what we
did here, but what was here done
for us. And so this plate is also
laid as an acknowledgment of the

priceless gift we have here received.
Beneath thin corridor we have dug
out the weak mortar, the imperfect
concrete, and replaced it with the
moie substantial bronze. This is
symbolical of the metamorphosis
which has taken place within each
of us. We came here with weak
and imperfect ideas; the university
has dug these out and replaced
them with sounder and more sub
stantial ideals and principals.
Appreciating all this, theclass lays
this plate and the individual mem
bers have subscribed their names to
go beneath it as a pledge and a
promise to be ever loyal to our
alma mater.
''This will be easy for us who
saw and knew our real alma mater
who gave all that we might receive.
The alumni of other colleges must
pledge their loyalty to a fictitious
and mythical person, but we have
lieen blessed with a real alma
mater. We of this class count our
selves fortunate that we knew and
appreciated the great heart of that
grand woman, who will be remem
bered by all graduates of this in
stitution as their fostering mother.
And so this plate and our names
beneath it are given as a pledge —
if a pledge is at all necessary—to
be true to her hopes and ideals and
loyal to her memory. We know
not what duties await us as alumni,
but whatever there may be for us
to do we promise to do.
"Dr. Jordan, this plate is hereby
dedicated to the university, and
you are asked to receive it, by
which you will remember the
pledge of the class of 1905."
President Jordan, in accepting
the plate, said, in part:
"It is one of the real pleasures of
my life to receive the class plate
each year. The plate in itself
amounts to nothing, but its value
lies in that which it stands for.
The plates which are laid each year
are to go eventually all the way
around the quad, and I was esti
mating this morning how long it
would take for the complete circuit
to be made. It will be five centur
ies before we may start the second
row.
"There is one thing worth notic
ing in connection with these plates.
Those classes which have graduated
while Mrs. Stanford was alive have
laid their plates in front of the
Memorial Church, and this plate
laid here to-day fills the last vacant
place before the church. This, we
may say, is symbolic of the life of
the founder."

saw and knew our real alma mater
who gave all that we might receive.
The alumni of other colleges must
pledge their loyalty to a fictitious
and mythical person, but we have
lieen blessed with a real alma
mater. We of this class count our
selves fortunate that we knew and
appreciated the great heart of that
grand woman, who will be remem
bered by all graduates of this in
stitution as their fostering mother.
And so this plate and our names
beneath it are given as a pledge —
if a pledge is at all necessary—to
be true to her hopes and ideals and
loyal to her memory. We know
not what duties await us as alumni,
but whatever there may be for us
to do we promise to do.
"Dr. Jordan, this plate is hereby
dedicated to the university, and
you are asked to receive it, by
which you will remember the
pledge of the class of 1905."
President Jordan, in accepting
the plate, said, in part:
"It is one of the real pleasures of
my life to receive the class plate
each year. The plate in itself
amounts to nothing, but its value
lies in that which it stands for.
The plates which are laid each year
are to go eventually all the way
around the quad, and I was esti
mating this morning how long it
would take for the complete circuit
to be made. It will be five centur
ies before we may start the second
row.
"There is one thing worth notic
ing in connection with these plates.
Those classes which have graduated
while Mrs. Stanford was alive have
laid their plates in front of the
Memorial Church, and this plate
laid here to-day fills the last vacant
place before the church. This, we
may say, is symbolic of the life of
the founder."
