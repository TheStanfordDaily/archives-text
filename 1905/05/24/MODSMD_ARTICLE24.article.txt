# ALUMNI ARE GOOD HITTERS.
## Seniors Defeated by the Score of 11 to 7 in an Interesting Game. 
### 
The Alumni demonstrated that
they were still able to play baseball
by defeating the Seniors easily
Tuesday morning. The score was
11 to 7. Most of the old-timers
showed stiffness and were a trifle
slow on their feet. They made up
for these slight defects when it
came to hitting the ball. In the
second inning Newsom, Campbell,
Calhoun, and McGilvray landed on
Dehy for four clean hits, which
netted six runs. Three more hits
in the fourth brought in three runs,
and two more tallies were made by
the alumni in the eighth. All their
runs were earned, while the Seniors
made a few on errors. McLaine
and Parker twirled for the alumni
and kept the hits well scattered.
Deliy and Luce occupied the box
for the Seniors and were touched
up for nine hits, several of them
being for two or three bags. The
line-up follows:
