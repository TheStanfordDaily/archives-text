# SENIORS WIN CLOSE GAME.
## Faculty Defeated by One Run in the Annual Contest With the Upper Classmen. 
### 
The Seniors finally defeated the
faculty in the last inning on Satur
day morning. With the score tied,
12-12, two men out, and one on
base, an easy grounder was k nocked
to Dr. Angell, who threw the ball
to President Jordan at first base.
The president took pity on the
Seniors for a moment, and the
delay was fatal. The hull passed
on into the bleachers, and before it
was rescued the class of 1905 had
scored the winning run.
