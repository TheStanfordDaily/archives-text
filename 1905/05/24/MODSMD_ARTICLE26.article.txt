# SENIORS PRESENT "KIDNAPED."
## Production Not Notable Artistically, but Affords Good Amusement With Its Local Hits. 
### 
"Kidnaped," an original farce
by R. S. Ha rris, '08, was very suc
cessfully presented in the Assembly
Hall on Thursday evening by the
Senior class. Judged from a liter
ary or dramatic standpoint, the
farce was below the standard set
by recent Stanford productions, but
as a distinct college farce, written
and staged with the idea of giving
a good time and a laugh to a Stan
ford audience, "Kidnaped" was un
doubtedly a success. The plot was
slim, but the local hits in which
the piece abounded were clever.
