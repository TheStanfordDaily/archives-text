# ACHIEVEMENTS OF MEN AND WOMEN OF 1905.
## Miss Alice Richards Reads the History of Deeds of Members of the Graduating Class. 
### 
THE class history, written by
Miss Alice May Richards
and Miss Jennet Johnson, was
read by Miss Richards. It follows:
"This is a history of quality, not
quantity. The words of a Daily
Palo Alto of September, 1901,
stating that 'the present Freshman
class of 266 members is but 82 per
cent the size of its predecessors,'
we take as a compliment rather
than otherwise. For within this
last year in the life of our small
class have not larger gates been
erected —just before our exit? The
little old gates served the mighty
armies of departing '03 and '04,
but for '05 —Can we ask for any
higher recognition of our greatness?
"The first deed of our Freshman
year was the surprise which we
gave to the more numerous Sopho
mores in the matter of class num
erals upon the athletic field fence.
Later, our Freshman football team
surprised people again bv snatch
ing— through the skill of Paul
Tarpey—an unexpected victory of
11-5 from the Berkeley freshmen.
In baseball '05 beat '04 by a score
of 6-5.
"Two Freshmen, Bush and
Byrne, became at once right-hand
men of the Musical Clubs.

"Four of our number were elect
ed to the Daily I'alo Alto staff,
and the men and women who have
since been prominent in university
literary work began to show their
ability in this first year.
"As Sophomores, we did our
share in intercollegiate football
through the work of Bansbach,
Clark and Dole. The interclass
game we won from the Freshmen,
11-6. And we showed our promise
in another field —track work. E.
C. Beach, Bell, Crossman, Craw
ford, Dole, O. E. Hyde, Holrnan,
McCaughern and Dave Tarpey
were '05's representatives in this
second year at the memorable meet,
the first which Stanford ever won
from California.
"The upperclassman years of
'05's life are made praiseworthy by
the constant and varied activities
of men whom we all know. Not a
collection of shooting stars have we
of'o5 —no indeed! But the men
who as Freshmen and Sophomores
showed promise as track men, as
writers, as clever stuntists and able
workers, have continued to take
part in college activities, showing
their own splendid ability and do
ing more for the glory of'os in each
succeeding year.
"I have only to mention such a
man as Sherriffs, who for two years
has been a strong member of the
intercollegiate debating teams and
who has worked steadily up to a
splendid climax this year in the
victory of both the Carnot and the
Intercollegiate debates; such a
man as Dibble—debater, president
of the student body; Moran, who
has contributed much to the liter
ary life of Stanford and who is
about to go across the seas as Stan
ford's representative; Thorpe, yell
leader and playwright; Barnett, de
bater and actor; Bell and Holrnan,
track captains; Reynolds, Quad
editor, Chaparral editor, writer,
and playwright; Trowbridge, cap
tain of the baseball team and Sen
ior president.
"In the women's intercollegiate
tennis of 1903 we have to thank
Miss Ray, '05, for helping to break
at last the old hoodoo. Since then,

the three tennis squad members of
'05, Miss Ray, Miss Pitman and
Miss Paine, have been very worthy
opponents for Berkeley's players.
''The intercollegiate football of
1903 owes its success in part to six
of our men. And none of us have
forgotten that itwasCaptain Bans
bach's splendid goal which made a
Berkele}' victory impossible. In
this last season, the football record
has been notable. Seven out of
nine games played were Stanford
victories, and it was the first time
that Stanford has defeated so many
teams from different States. The
climax of 18-0 we have not forgot
ten. We are proud to claim from
this team Captain Clark, Butter
field, Thompson,C. E. Hyde, Roose
velt, Shields, Bansbach and Dole;
and from the strong second team
Bogle, Hazelwood, Monzingo, Van
Sickle, Trowbridge.
"In regard to the track work of
the last two years, '05's honor has
been upheld by a faithful few.
The meet with Berkeley last year,
which Stanford won, we remember
for the record-breaking shot-nut
made by Hyde, '05. Captain Hol
man and Lanagan each won two
first places. Bell and Dole hold
the Stanford record in the high
jump. Bell also holds half honor
in the broad jump record. As cap
tain this year he won points in the
high jump, and at the Western in
tercollegiate at the World's Fair
games he won both the high and
the broad. Crawford holds the
Stanford record for the hammer
throw. Burr made a college record
by his victory in this spring's two
mile intercollegiate. Lanagan,
Hyde, Morin, Waring, Carter, Luce,
are '05 track men whom we are
glad to claim.
''In boating, our new branch of
athletics, Butterfield and Dole have
places in the crew.
"The last three intercollegiate de
bates have been Stanford victories.
Spencer, Sherriffs, Barnett are our
victors, and the fourth Stanford
Carnot, victory went to a '05 man —
Sherriffs. In debating societies,
Swing and Dibble are prominent.
' On the Sequoia, the Cliaparrni
and the Daily Palo Alto staffs we
are represented bv Thorpe, Rey
nold s, Mora n, F.H.Fowler, O.A.Wil
son and l)ey. Two of these men
have written class farces of the last
two years.
"In both musical clubs, Lana
gan and Hooper, '05, have been do
ing good work.
"And now, having blown our
own horn for some minutes in the
manner of all departing classes, let
us close by blowing the bigger uni
versity horn, the more worthy one
of our alma mater.
"The little things which we as
individuals have done —the plays
and the athletic records, the debates
and the other honors —sink into
their true small perspective when
we recall the things which have
happened during our four years in
the university —the things which
are landmarks in the history of
Stanford.
"We have watched the Memorial
Church grow and come to its full
and wonderful perfection. It has
been our privilege to transfer our
attention from the inner to the
outer quad —our feet from the dan
gers of cluttering boards and
chasms to the cement paths of
peace. The classes after '05 will
wend their ways to eight-twenty
fives as a matter of course, and
perhaps even feel the burden of the
hour, but can one of us of '05 ever
forget the luxury, the bli.-s, of hav
ing been disciplined for eight-fif
teens and then presented with ten
more precious minutes of grace?
"It is by contrasts that we ap
preciate our blessings. When we
think of the university we entered,
and of the university we are leav
ing, we would not change places
with our older brothers and our
younger sisters for anything —ex-
cept the privilege of staying here
longer. We saw in reality the ivy
that is now only a pictured
memory. When we were Freshmen
the flag-pole arrived in sections.
And shall future classes, we won
der, wake in the morning as we
have, to look for the flag-pole —
and rub their eyes and look again?
"We had the pleasure of seeing
the first football game played on a
campus field, to say nothing of the
pleasure of helping to dedicate
Berkeley's new field.
"We have staved just long
enough to see Phi Beta Kappa
established and to reap a little har
vest from its honors.
"And now in this last week of
our class life we are to have the
pleasure of welcoming back the
alumni to their own again—the
first reunion of the kind in ten
years. To come into personal
touch with these men and women
whose place we now fill — whom we
feel as friends even ttow, through
our common student life and love
—this is surely not the least of the
many privileges which we of '05
have had given to us.
"For four years we have shared
in Stanford's joys and blessings,—
in this last year we have shared in
her sorrow. But the blossom of
this sorrow is that we have been
drawn all more closely together by
the death of our common helper
and friend.
"And for our class there has
been the privilege which cannot be
measured in words—of touching
the hand, of hearing the voice of
the woman who has given us all
this which we are leaving and
which we are carrying away —the
sweetness of four years."
