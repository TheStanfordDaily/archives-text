# MANY BEQUESTS MADE BY THE GRADUATING CLASS.
## Legacies to the Class of 1906 and Others Duly Set Forth in the Will. 
### 
THE class will, which was writ
ten by Del mar Milton Iteynolds,
was read by Frederick I'rescott
Whitaker. The text follows:
"To-day we, the class of 1905,
stand at the parting of the ways.
Behind us is our childhood and its
dreams, before is net a hidden task
—one to be accomplished before
that day comes when childhood
and dreams shall descend on us
again. Thus for our task's sake
we would be strong, and to that
end would know our weakness
rather than our strength, for therein

is wisdom. We would learn to do
without rather than to acquire; we
would know happiness without
pride and sorrow without sadness;
we would keep our idols separated
from our ideals; and, above all, our
sentiments untainted by sentimen
tality, tbat we may be worthy of
tbis, the boon of four years that has
been granted to us.
''And now, having reached the
end of our rope and the edge of the
campus Ht one and the same time,
and being of sound and disposing
mind and body, we do make and
declare this our last will and testa
ment.
'•To the university we leave our
undying loyalty and the knowledge
that our vacant places will be ever
tilled by better men.
" With Dr. Jordan we leave our
respect and friendship —carrying
away with us the memory of a
kindly scholar, gentleman, and
man.
"To the Registrar we leave the
care and custody of the last three
pink cards which his office con
tains, together with an injunction
against the misplacing of such
valuable relics of barbarism.
"To John Ezra we leave the
Registrar, etc., etc.
"To the class of 1906 we give and
bequeath the duty of keeping alive
the quad traditions, together with
one admission ticket to the afore
said quad. This, be it understood,
is done in a spirit of friendship far
exceeding their just deserts, for
from time immemorial it has been
the custom for Juniors to win their
entrance credit at the point of the
plug.
"Item. To the class of 1900, in
the custody of Prexy Cutler, we
give and bequeat h the ca re and cul
ture of the university, with power
to make such holidays as may seem
fit to the aforesaid custodian of the
university.
" Item. To the class of 1906 and
to their heirs and assigns forever
we give and bequeath the immor
tals, Alexander Sherriffs, Hen Dey,
Merle Thorpe and Bertheau, with
the understanding that they be
treated well and often.
"To the class of 1907, in per
petuity, we give the homestead
described as follows: sixteen bath
tubs entirely surrounded by Fresh
men, location Encina, first, second,
third and fourth floors.
"To the class of 1908 we give
and bequeath theirs with the un
derstanding that the delivery of
the goods shall be at the hands of
1909.
''To the fraternities we give and
bequeath one little hammer, the
duplicate of which is to hang for
ever in the Encina club-room.
"To the sororities and to their
heirs and assigns forever we give
and bequeath the fraternity pins,
with the sole proviso that they
never tell the girls at home.
"It is our wish that the portals
of Madrono shall be decorated with
the following legend:
"'The Happy Hunting Ground.
Leave hope behind all ye who enter
here.'
''Money for this laudable pur
pose will be found under thesecond
brick to be subsequently fired into
the English office.
"To Roble Ilall we extend our
heartiest congratulations over the
possession of such faithful trusties
and the introduction of the patrol
system.
"To Sword and Sandals, the Foil
and Manic, Senior Society, Quad
rangle (Jlul) and Sigma Sigma we
give and bequeath the various
alarm clocks that have nerved us so
faithfully during our pilgrimage.
"To Kari Bickel we give the right
to make May's Bogie look like
thirty cents. To Paul Edwards we
bequeath one t-kirt, rat, powder
puff and straight front, with the
admonition that the Squaller has
always been a lady-like sheet. To
Oppenheim goes the Chaparral and
to VVeinmann and Allen the Daily
Dolly. May there always be peace
between the sheets.
''And now with the rest of you,
our friends, we leave Charlie
Field's definition of the Stanford
Spirit. Take it, remember it, and
if you can, live up to it.
"'ln loyalty to Stanford —to the
whole university—by word and
deed always, by silence even when
speech were disloyal; in honoring
Stanford people to the measure of
their loyalty and no more; in build
ing with the builders through faith
in the Stanford plan; in making
every best effort spell Stanford be
fore another name; in planting no
seed in Stanford ground without
hope of flower somewhere; and for
the sake of these things reverencing
the sentiment which gave theStan
ford opportunity —therein lies the
beginning but not the end of the
Stanford Spirit."'
