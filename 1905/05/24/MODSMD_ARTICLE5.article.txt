# Pleads for General Culture for Engineers and Students in Other Sciences and Professions
## Professor Charles David Marx Delivers the Commencement Address. 
### 
The commencement address was
delivered by Professor Charles
David Marx of the department of
Civil Engineering. Professor Marx,
discussing "General Education of
Engineers," made a strong plea for
liberalizing culture courses for
technical and scientific students.
His address follows:
"There has been of late years a
large increase in the number of stu
dents of engineering in our colleges
and universities. An investigation
made by Professor Raymond of the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
shows that the attendance in arts and
science courses has increased in four
years fifteen percent., in engineering
courses 102 per cent. This tendency
on the part of the young men to take
up the study of the more practical
lines of work in preference to the so
called more liberalizing studies is
viewed with grave concern by some.
'Are we to be merely a nation of
shop-keepers and engineers ?' has
been asked from this platform.
"While not sharing the fear im
plied in this question, I must admit
that because of the tendency of the
young men of the country to take up
engineering studies, the proper train
ing of the engineer is a matter of
vital importance to the common
wealth. The extent to which en
gineering enters into some of the
most vexing problems of our national
and municipal life is perhaps fully
realized only by men who have an
engineering training. The correct
solution of these problems can in
many cases be given only by en
gineers; but these must be men
trained on broad lines. The charge
is brought not infrequently that the
professional structure which we rear
on the foundation laid in our public
schools is a narrow one, lacking in
windows from which to gain the
necessary outlook for surveying even
one's own field, let alone that of
one's neighbor. The charge is well
founded, but may with equal justice
be brought against students in other
lines of work.
Must Broaden Intellectual Horizon.
"The graduate from a high school
who takes up engineering studies
should be required to broaden his
intellectual horizon before beginning
his professional work. The difficulty
of bringing this about is great, and
the introduction of the elective sys
tem has certainly not helped matters.
The tendency toward early special
ization is constantly increasing, and
one-sided, narrow linguists, historians
and scientists are as much a menace
to the commonwealth as one-sided
engineers. For it must be borne in
mind that the work which the en
gineer is called upon to do is in the
world, implies contact with men and

things and is in its nature broaden
ing. It is cultural in the best sense
of the word, and must therefore react
on him. This does not hold true to
the same extent for the other lines of
work mentioned. In a democracy it
is of the highest importance that
every man realize that the noble
duties of citizenship devolve upon
him; that he has responsibilities other
than those of merely providing the
daily bread for himself and his. We
have a community of interests only
as long as we have common points of
contact; we have the latter only as
we have a broad, common subsidiary
training.
"Admitting that the high school
course of the embryo engineer should
be rounded out with additional work
in language, science, history and
economics, the question arises, where
shall this knowledge be acquired?
For the training of our engineers we
have, broadly speaking, two types
of schools in this country â€”technical
schools pure and simple, such as the
Boston Institute of Technology,
Rensselaer Polytechnic and others,
and engineering departments either
in our colleges of engineering and
mechanic arts, or in our universities.
I group the last two named, because
in both of them some of the general
culture studies mentioned as neces
sary for the broadening of the en
gineer's training are presented merely
from the standpoint of the specialist.
Value of Culture Recognized.
"In the schools of the first type
there is a recognition of the fact that
the general culture courses must be
adapted to the needs of the technical
student. There is a frank acknowl
edgement that these broadening
studies may be made to serve a use
ful purpose, even when they are not
an end to themselves, and that this
does not detract from their value.
The fact is recognized by teachers of
these subjects in purely technical
schools that because the student is

to be a specialist in some line of en
gineering he cannot at the same time
be a specialist in ancient and mod
ern languages, in history, economics
and the pure sciences. From the
engineer's standpoint, as regards the
acquirement of this supplementary
general training, there is much to be
said in favor of the autonomy of
technical schools.
"This, too, is the view at which
the German Society of Engineers has
arrived. As in this country, there
has been a very large increase in the
number of students in the technical
courses in Germany. So large has
this increase been that for a time at
least foreign students in mechanical
engineering were barred at Berlin.
Existing institutions are still so
crowded that the establishment of
new technical schools is contemplated.
The suggestion was made that in
those places where universities existed
and technical schools were needed
the latter might well be incorporated
in the university. At a meeting held
in Munich in September, 1904, which
was attended by representative teach
ers from the technical schools, the
universities, the preparatory schools
and by engineers standing in prac
tice, the following resolution was sub
mitted: 'It is not desirable, in place
of establishing new technical high
schools, to add technical faculties to
existing universities, because both
institutions differ in their character
and method of instruction.' Those
assembled, after laying stress 011 the
fact that members of the engineering
profession should be judged by the
same educational standards as other
educated professional men, adopted
the above resolution in substance, but
in deference to the university men
the last clause of the resolution was
not emphasized. I think, though,
that the correctness of the statement
is generally admitted.
Engineering and the Universities.
"In spite of these conclusions, we

find in this country at least a ten
dency in the opposite direction. In
our strongest State universities and
in others built on private foundations
we find either engineering depart
ments or colleges. The union of
Harvard University and the Institute
of Technology is under consideration.
Something can therefore undoubtedly
be said in favor of this arrangement.
Of course the presence of the 'Sub
limated Tinker' in the university has
been deprecated, but not by the
leaders of educational thought in
America. It is recognized that the
presence of a body of hardworking,
straight-thinking young men in a
university, even if they intend to
make some practical use of their edu
cation, is a good antidote for intellec
tual snobbishness. On the other
hand, it must be conceded that the
technical student too is benefited by
being thrown in contact with men in
other lines of work, many of which
have no direct practical application.
Students become acquainted with one
another, learn to appreciate one an
other's point ol view, and mutual
respect and good will result.
Courses for the Specialist.
"While fully recognizing the ben
efits which come in a general way to
the engineering student from this
environment, it must nevertheless be
asserted that as our universities in
their development follow in the wake
of the German universities, they too,
like them, become unfitted for doing
the general culture work, not only
for engineering students, but for all
students. The tendency toward
specialization in subjects and sub
divisions of subjects leads to the offer
ing of many undoubtedly valuable
courses. But they are courses for
the specialist, fitted for his needs, and
capable of being understood by but
few. The giving of general culture
courses is discouraged; and there is
some justification, as long as the aim
of many so-called students is merely
to get hours enough to graduate.
The summing up of the results in any
given line of work and its presenta
tion so that the non-specialist may
get a general view of the field is dan
gerous, because of the 'little learning'
thus imparted, which of course is a
'dangerous thing.'
"Even in poetry: 'The learned
guardians of these treasures insist
tliat they cannot be appreciated un
less there has been much preliminary
wrestling with a "critical apparatus"
and much delving among "original
sources.' "
"If the engineering student is to
acquire that general cultural training
the lack of which is often made a re
proach to him, and if the technical
school is to find its lull development
in the university, and not as a separ
ate institution, then the university
must make provision for this much
needed instruction, unless it can be
provided for all students elsewhere.
It will and should lead to the giving
of courses differing in character and
diffeiing in method of presentation
from those now offered to the special
ist, but they may be none the less
both useful and inspiring. It is
necessary for the specialist to know
the methods of study of his specialty;
it is necessary for the general student
to know the results of such study.
Therefore to be both useful and in
spiring such courses must be given


Professor Charles David Marx
by men who are past masters in their
line of work.
Benefit of General Knowledge.
"This will be held by many to be a
plea in favor of superficality, and if
getting a general view of another line
of work is superficiality, why, it is a
superficiality of which many special
ists might well be guilty. The ob
jectors to this kind of general knowl
edge lose sight of the fact that no one
is thoroughly grounded in his own
line of work is likely to be damaged
intellectually by such general informa
tion. Conscious of the limitation of
his knowledge in his own field after
years of study, he is not likely to as
sume that he has mastered â€¢ another
field as a result of a general lecture
course in that subject. The chances
are, however, that the effect will be
to broaden his views, to enlarge his
sympathetic understanding of the
work of the specialist and to create
an atmosphere of mutual respect and
consideration for one another's line of
work.
"In order to give such courses
there must be an increase in the teach
ing force in the various lines of work
in our universities. Certainly the
work of the specialist, upon which
progress in any given field depends,
must not be stinted for the sake of the
seeker after general knowledge. This
is one reason why consolidation of the
technical school with the university,
if the tendency toward specialization
in the latter continues, cannot bring
about economy in instruction. Justi
fication for such consolidation must
be sought elsewhere as shown above.
Not only engineering students but all
students pursuing special studies in a
university, need general courses, and
though it may not be possible for us
to become a nation of engineers, it is
eminently desirable that all educated
persons should have at least some
general knowledge of engineering.
Surely he can not be held to be truly
educated who is ignorant of the con
ditions which surround him, of the
methods by which his daily intellect
ual and physical needs are met.
"This training is not for the pur
pose of making more half-baked ex
perts, prepared to pass snap judg
ments on matters beyond their ken,
but for the purpose of teaching them
the importance of solving the prob
lems of manufacture, distribution and
transportation correctly. These prob
lems, translated, stand for the pro
viding of material and mental food for
the masses, the betterment of their
conditions of living,for healthy homes,
for the pure air, the pure earth, the
pure water of the sanitarian, for the
intellectual growth which is made
possible by freeing man from soul and
mind-killing drudgery. Publicservice
is what engineering stands for, and
perhaps the cultural effect of such
work will be admitted. The work is
as altruistic as that of the physician,
as that of the minister. For the spirit
of acquisition, for corporate greed,
the profession of engineering is not
responsible. There has been no fear
expressed of our becoming a nation
of physicians or even of lawyers. The
danger to the commonwealth from a
superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund
ance of engineers. There need be
no danger from either, if the lawyers
and engineers are men of the right
stamp.
Must be Men of Character.
"Moral integrity does not neces
sarily go with cultural training so
called. Men with the broadest of
cultural training may be found in the
pay of corporations striving for illegal

franchises. Political bosses with no
cultural training may be found abet
ting- them. Engineers may probably
be called upon to carry out the work.
The danger to the community lies not
in the character of the work, but in
the character of the man; and a na
tion is in no danger, even if it be
largely a nation of engineers, as long
as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of
knowledge of the engineering of to
day, it would be well indeed. That
these engineers, sent out by our
schools, are making their presence
felt in the world eannot be gainsaid;
that they have contributed to the
mental and moral uplifting of this na
tion no one who thinks deeply will
deny."

superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund

in the character of the work, but in

as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of

this increase been that for a time at
least foreign students in mechanical
engineering were barred at Berlin.
Existing institutions are still so
crowded that the establishment of
new technical schools is contemplated.
The suggestion was made that in
those places where universities existed
and technical schools were needed
the latter might well be incorporated
in the university. At a meeting held
in Munich in September, 1904, which
was attended by representative teach
ers from the technical schools, the
universities, the preparatory schools
and by engineers standing in prac
tice, the following resolution was sub
mitted: 'It is not desirable, in place
of establishing new technical high
schools, to add technical faculties to
existing universities, because both
institutions differ in their character
and method of instruction.' Those
assembled, after laying stress 011 the
fact that members of the engineering
profession should be judged by the
same educational standards as other
educated professional men, adopted
the above resolution in substance, but
in deference to the university men
the last clause of the resolution was
not emphasized. I think, though,
that the correctness of the statement
is generally admitted.
Engineering and the Universities.
"In spite of these conclusions, we

find in this country at least a ten
dency in the opposite direction. In
our strongest State universities and
in others built on private foundations
we find either engineering depart
ments or colleges. The union of
Harvard University and the Institute
of Technology is under consideration.
Something can therefore undoubtedly
be said in favor of this arrangement.
Of course the presence of the 'Sub
limated Tinker' in the university has
been deprecated, but not by the
leaders of educational thought in
America. It is recognized that the
presence of a body of hardworking,
straight-thinking young men in a
university, even if they intend to
make some practical use of their edu
cation, is a good antidote for intellec
tual snobbishness. On the other
hand, it must be conceded that the
technical student too is benefited by
being thrown in contact with men in
other lines of work, many of which
have no direct practical application.
Students become acquainted with one
another, learn to appreciate one an
other's point ol view, and mutual
respect and good will result.
Courses for the Specialist.
"While fully recognizing the ben
efits which come in a general way to
the engineering student from this
environment, it must nevertheless be
asserted that as our universities in
their development follow in the wake
of the German universities, they too,
like them, become unfitted for doing
the general culture work, not only
for engineering students, but for all
students. The tendency toward
specialization in subjects and sub
divisions of subjects leads to the offer
ing of many undoubtedly valuable
courses. But they are courses for
the specialist, fitted for his needs, and
capable of being understood by but
few. The giving of general culture
courses is discouraged; and there is
some justification, as long as the aim
of many so-called students is merely
to get hours enough to graduate.
The summing up of the results in any
given line of work and its presenta
tion so that the non-specialist may
get a general view of the field is dan
gerous, because of the 'little learning'
thus imparted, which of course is a
'dangerous thing.'
"Even in poetry: 'The learned
guardians of these treasures insist
tliat they cannot be appreciated un
less there has been much preliminary
wrestling with a "critical apparatus"
and much delving among "original
sources.' "
"If the engineering student is to
acquire that general cultural training
the lack of which is often made a re
proach to him, and if the technical
school is to find its lull development
in the university, and not as a separ
ate institution, then the university
must make provision for this much
needed instruction, unless it can be
provided for all students elsewhere.
It will and should lead to the giving
of courses differing in character and
diffeiing in method of presentation
from those now offered to the special
ist, but they may be none the less
both useful and inspiring. It is
necessary for the specialist to know
the methods of study of his specialty;
it is necessary for the general student
to know the results of such study.
Therefore to be both useful and in
spiring such courses must be given


Professor Charles David Marx
by men who are past masters in their
line of work.
Benefit of General Knowledge.
"This will be held by many to be a
plea in favor of superficality, and if
getting a general view of another line
of work is superficiality, why, it is a
superficiality of which many special
ists might well be guilty. The ob
jectors to this kind of general knowl
edge lose sight of the fact that no one
is thoroughly grounded in his own
line of work is likely to be damaged
intellectually by such general informa
tion. Conscious of the limitation of
his knowledge in his own field after
years of study, he is not likely to as
sume that he has mastered â€¢ another
field as a result of a general lecture
course in that subject. The chances
are, however, that the effect will be
to broaden his views, to enlarge his
sympathetic understanding of the
work of the specialist and to create
an atmosphere of mutual respect and
consideration for one another's line of
work.
"In order to give such courses
there must be an increase in the teach
ing force in the various lines of work
in our universities. Certainly the
work of the specialist, upon which
progress in any given field depends,
must not be stinted for the sake of the
seeker after general knowledge. This
is one reason why consolidation of the
technical school with the university,
if the tendency toward specialization
in the latter continues, cannot bring
about economy in instruction. Justi
fication for such consolidation must
be sought elsewhere as shown above.
Not only engineering students but all
students pursuing special studies in a
university, need general courses, and
though it may not be possible for us
to become a nation of engineers, it is
eminently desirable that all educated
persons should have at least some
general knowledge of engineering.
Surely he can not be held to be truly
educated who is ignorant of the con
ditions which surround him, of the
methods by which his daily intellect
ual and physical needs are met.
"This training is not for the pur
pose of making more half-baked ex
perts, prepared to pass snap judg
ments on matters beyond their ken,
but for the purpose of teaching them
the importance of solving the prob
lems of manufacture, distribution and
transportation correctly. These prob
lems, translated, stand for the pro
viding of material and mental food for
the masses, the betterment of their
conditions of living,for healthy homes,
for the pure air, the pure earth, the
pure water of the sanitarian, for the
intellectual growth which is made
possible by freeing man from soul and
mind-killing drudgery. Publicservice
is what engineering stands for, and
perhaps the cultural effect of such
work will be admitted. The work is
as altruistic as that of the physician,
as that of the minister. For the spirit
of acquisition, for corporate greed,
the profession of engineering is not
responsible. There has been no fear
expressed of our becoming a nation
of physicians or even of lawyers. The
danger to the commonwealth from a
superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund
ance of engineers. There need be
no danger from either, if the lawyers
and engineers are men of the right
stamp.
Must be Men of Character.
"Moral integrity does not neces
sarily go with cultural training so
called. Men with the broadest of
cultural training may be found in the
pay of corporations striving for illegal

franchises. Political bosses with no
cultural training may be found abet
ting- them. Engineers may probably
be called upon to carry out the work.
The danger to the community lies not
in the character of the work, but in
the character of the man; and a na
tion is in no danger, even if it be
largely a nation of engineers, as long
as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of
knowledge of the engineering of to
day, it would be well indeed. That
these engineers, sent out by our
schools, are making their presence
felt in the world eannot be gainsaid;
that they have contributed to the
mental and moral uplifting of this na
tion no one who thinks deeply will
deny."
The commencement address was
delivered by Professor Charles
David Marx of the department of
Civil Engineering. Professor Marx,
discussing "General Education of
Engineers," made a strong plea for
liberalizing culture courses for
technical and scientific students.
His address follows:
"There has been of late years a
large increase in the number of stu
dents of engineering in our colleges
and universities. An investigation
made by Professor Raymond of the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
shows that the attendance in arts and
science courses has increased in four
years fifteen percent., in engineering
courses 102 per cent. This tendency
on the part of the young men to take
up the study of the more practical
lines of work in preference to the so
called more liberalizing studies is
viewed with grave concern by some.
'Are we to be merely a nation of
shop-keepers and engineers ?' has
been asked from this platform.
"While not sharing the fear im
plied in this question, I must admit
that because of the tendency of the
young men of the country to take up
engineering studies, the proper train
ing of the engineer is a matter of
vital importance to the common
wealth. The extent to which en
gineering enters into some of the
most vexing problems of our national
and municipal life is perhaps fully
realized only by men who have an
engineering training. The correct
solution of these problems can in
many cases be given only by en
gineers; but these must be men
trained on broad lines. The charge
is brought not infrequently that the
professional structure which we rear
on the foundation laid in our public
schools is a narrow one, lacking in
windows from which to gain the
necessary outlook for surveying even
one's own field, let alone that of
one's neighbor. The charge is well
founded, but may with equal justice
be brought against students in other
lines of work.
Must Broaden Intellectual Horizon.
"The graduate from a high school
who takes up engineering studies
should be required to broaden his
intellectual horizon before beginning
his professional work. The difficulty
of bringing this about is great, and
the introduction of the elective sys
tem has certainly not helped matters.
The tendency toward early special
ization is constantly increasing, and
one-sided, narrow linguists, historians
and scientists are as much a menace
to the commonwealth as one-sided
engineers. For it must be borne in
mind that the work which the en
gineer is called upon to do is in the
world, implies contact with men and

things and is in its nature broaden
ing. It is cultural in the best sense
of the word, and must therefore react
on him. This does not hold true to
the same extent for the other lines of
work mentioned. In a democracy it
is of the highest importance that
every man realize that the noble
duties of citizenship devolve upon
him; that he has responsibilities other
than those of merely providing the
daily bread for himself and his. We
have a community of interests only
as long as we have common points of
contact; we have the latter only as
we have a broad, common subsidiary
training.
"Admitting that the high school
course of the embryo engineer should
be rounded out with additional work
in language, science, history and
economics, the question arises, where
shall this knowledge be acquired?
For the training of our engineers we
have, broadly speaking, two types
of schools in this country â€”technical
schools pure and simple, such as the
Boston Institute of Technology,
Rensselaer Polytechnic and others,
and engineering departments either
in our colleges of engineering and
mechanic arts, or in our universities.
I group the last two named, because
in both of them some of the general
culture studies mentioned as neces
sary for the broadening of the en
gineer's training are presented merely
from the standpoint of the specialist.
Value of Culture Recognized.
"In the schools of the first type
there is a recognition of the fact that
the general culture courses must be
adapted to the needs of the technical
student. There is a frank acknowl
edgement that these broadening
studies may be made to serve a use
ful purpose, even when they are not
an end to themselves, and that this
does not detract from their value.
The fact is recognized by teachers of
these subjects in purely technical
schools that because the student is

to be a specialist in some line of en
gineering he cannot at the same time
be a specialist in ancient and mod
ern languages, in history, economics
and the pure sciences. From the
engineer's standpoint, as regards the
acquirement of this supplementary
general training, there is much to be
said in favor of the autonomy of
technical schools.
"This, too, is the view at which
the German Society of Engineers has
arrived. As in this country, there
has been a very large increase in the
number of students in the technical
courses in Germany. So large has
this increase been that for a time at
least foreign students in mechanical
engineering were barred at Berlin.
Existing institutions are still so
crowded that the establishment of
new technical schools is contemplated.
The suggestion was made that in
those places where universities existed
and technical schools were needed

was attended by representative teach

and by engineers standing in prac

danger to the commonwealth from a
superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund

no danger from either, if the lawyers

Must be Men of Character.
"Moral integrity does not neces

called. Men with the broadest of
cultural training may be found in the
pay of corporations striving for illegal

The danger to the community lies not
in the character of the work, but in
the character of the man; and a na
tion is in no danger, even if it be
largely a nation of engineers, as long
as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of
knowledge of the engineering of to
day, it would be well indeed. That
these engineers, sent out by our

years of study, he is not likely to as
sume that he has mastered â€¢ another
field as a result of a general lecture
course in that subject. The chances
are, however, that the effect will be
to broaden his views, to enlarge his
sympathetic understanding of the
work of the specialist and to create
an atmosphere of mutual respect and
consideration for one another's line of
work.
"In order to give such courses
there must be an increase in the teach
ing force in the various lines of work
in our universities. Certainly the
work of the specialist, upon which
progress in any given field depends,
must not be stinted for the sake of the
seeker after general knowledge. This
is one reason why consolidation of the
technical school with the university,
if the tendency toward specialization
in the latter continues, cannot bring
about economy in instruction. Justi
fication for such consolidation must
be sought elsewhere as shown above.
Not only engineering students but all
students pursuing special studies in a
university, need general courses, and
though it may not be possible for us
to become a nation of engineers, it is
eminently desirable that all educated
persons should have at least some
general knowledge of engineering.
Surely he can not be held to be truly
educated who is ignorant of the con
ditions which surround him, of the
methods by which his daily intellect
ual and physical needs are met.
"This training is not for the pur
pose of making more half-baked ex
perts, prepared to pass snap judg
ments on matters beyond their ken,
but for the purpose of teaching them
the importance of solving the prob
lems of manufacture, distribution and
transportation correctly. These prob
lems, translated, stand for the pro
viding of material and mental food for
the masses, the betterment of their
conditions of living,for healthy homes,
for the pure air, the pure earth, the
pure water of the sanitarian, for the
intellectual growth which is made
possible by freeing man from soul and
mind-killing drudgery. Publicservice
is what engineering stands for, and
perhaps the cultural effect of such
work will be admitted. The work is
as altruistic as that of the physician,
as that of the minister. For the spirit
of acquisition, for corporate greed,
the profession of engineering is not
responsible. There has been no fear
expressed of our becoming a nation
of physicians or even of lawyers. The
danger to the commonwealth from a
superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund
ance of engineers. There need be
no danger from either, if the lawyers
and engineers are men of the right
stamp.
Must be Men of Character.
"Moral integrity does not neces
sarily go with cultural training so
called. Men with the broadest of
cultural training may be found in the
pay of corporations striving for illegal

franchises. Political bosses with no
cultural training may be found abet
ting- them. Engineers may probably
be called upon to carry out the work.
The danger to the community lies not
in the character of the work, but in
the character of the man; and a na
tion is in no danger, even if it be
largely a nation of engineers, as long
as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of
knowledge of the engineering of to
day, it would be well indeed. That
these engineers, sent out by our
schools, are making their presence
felt in the world eannot be gainsaid;
that they have contributed to the
mental and moral uplifting of this na
tion no one who thinks deeply will
deny."
The commencement address was
delivered by Professor Charles
David Marx of the department of
Civil Engineering. Professor Marx,
discussing "General Education of
Engineers," made a strong plea for
liberalizing culture courses for
technical and scientific students.
His address follows:
"There has been of late years a
large increase in the number of stu
dents of engineering in our colleges
and universities. An investigation
made by Professor Raymond of the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
shows that the attendance in arts and
science courses has increased in four
years fifteen percent., in engineering
courses 102 per cent. This tendency
on the part of the young men to take
up the study of the more practical
lines of work in preference to the so
called more liberalizing studies is
viewed with grave concern by some.
'Are we to be merely a nation of
shop-keepers and engineers ?' has
been asked from this platform.
"While not sharing the fear im
plied in this question, I must admit
that because of the tendency of the
young men of the country to take up
engineering studies, the proper train
ing of the engineer is a matter of
vital importance to the common
wealth. The extent to which en
gineering enters into some of the
most vexing problems of our national
and municipal life is perhaps fully
realized only by men who have an
engineering training. The correct
solution of these problems can in
many cases be given only by en
gineers; but these must be men
trained on broad lines. The charge
is brought not infrequently that the
professional structure which we rear
on the foundation laid in our public
schools is a narrow one, lacking in
windows from which to gain the
necessary outlook for surveying even
one's own field, let alone that of
one's neighbor. The charge is well
founded, but may with equal justice
be brought against students in other
lines of work.
Must Broaden Intellectual Horizon.
"The graduate from a high school
who takes up engineering studies
should be required to broaden his
intellectual horizon before beginning
his professional work. The difficulty
of bringing this about is great, and
the introduction of the elective sys
tem has certainly not helped matters.
The tendency toward early special
ization is constantly increasing, and
one-sided, narrow linguists, historians
and scientists are as much a menace
to the commonwealth as one-sided
engineers. For it must be borne in
mind that the work which the en
gineer is called upon to do is in the
world, implies contact with men and

things and is in its nature broaden
ing. It is cultural in the best sense
of the word, and must therefore react
on him. This does not hold true to
the same extent for the other lines of
work mentioned. In a democracy it
is of the highest importance that
every man realize that the noble
duties of citizenship devolve upon
him; that he has responsibilities other
than those of merely providing the
daily bread for himself and his. We
have a community of interests only
as long as we have common points of
contact; we have the latter only as
we have a broad, common subsidiary
training.
"Admitting that the high school
course of the embryo engineer should
be rounded out with additional work
in language, science, history and
economics, the question arises, where
shall this knowledge be acquired?
For the training of our engineers we
have, broadly speaking, two types
of schools in this country â€”technical
schools pure and simple, such as the
Boston Institute of Technology,
Rensselaer Polytechnic and others,
and engineering departments either
in our colleges of engineering and
mechanic arts, or in our universities.
I group the last two named, because
in both of them some of the general
culture studies mentioned as neces
sary for the broadening of the en
gineer's training are presented merely
from the standpoint of the specialist.
Value of Culture Recognized.
"In the schools of the first type
there is a recognition of the fact that
the general culture courses must be
adapted to the needs of the technical
student. There is a frank acknowl
edgement that these broadening
studies may be made to serve a use
ful purpose, even when they are not
an end to themselves, and that this
does not detract from their value.
The fact is recognized by teachers of
these subjects in purely technical
schools that because the student is

to be a specialist in some line of en
gineering he cannot at the same time
be a specialist in ancient and mod
ern languages, in history, economics
and the pure sciences. From the
engineer's standpoint, as regards the
acquirement of this supplementary
general training, there is much to be
said in favor of the autonomy of
technical schools.
"This, too, is the view at which
the German Society of Engineers has
arrived. As in this country, there
has been a very large increase in the
number of students in the technical
courses in Germany. So large has
this increase been that for a time at
least foreign students in mechanical
engineering were barred at Berlin.
Existing institutions are still so
crowded that the establishment of
new technical schools is contemplated.
The suggestion was made that in
those places where universities existed
and technical schools were needed
the latter might well be incorporated
in the university. At a meeting held
in Munich in September, 1904, which
was attended by representative teach
ers from the technical schools, the
universities, the preparatory schools
and by engineers standing in prac
tice, the following resolution was sub
mitted: 'It is not desirable, in place
of establishing new technical high
schools, to add technical faculties to
existing universities, because both
institutions differ in their character
and method of instruction.' Those
assembled, after laying stress 011 the
fact that members of the engineering
profession should be judged by the
same educational standards as other
educated professional men, adopted
the above resolution in substance, but
in deference to the university men
the last clause of the resolution was
not emphasized. I think, though,
that the correctness of the statement
is generally admitted.
Engineering and the Universities.
"In spite of these conclusions, we

find in this country at least a ten
dency in the opposite direction. In
our strongest State universities and
in others built on private foundations
we find either engineering depart
ments or colleges. The union of
Harvard University and the Institute
of Technology is under consideration.
Something can therefore undoubtedly
be said in favor of this arrangement.
Of course the presence of the 'Sub
limated Tinker' in the university has
been deprecated, but not by the
leaders of educational thought in
America. It is recognized that the
presence of a body of hardworking,
straight-thinking young men in a
university, even if they intend to
make some practical use of their edu
cation, is a good antidote for intellec
tual snobbishness. On the other
hand, it must be conceded that the
technical student too is benefited by
being thrown in contact with men in
other lines of work, many of which
have no direct practical application.
Students become acquainted with one
another, learn to appreciate one an
other's point ol view, and mutual
respect and good will result.
Courses for the Specialist.
"While fully recognizing the ben
efits which come in a general way to
the engineering student from this
environment, it must nevertheless be
asserted that as our universities in
their development follow in the wake
of the German universities, they too,
like them, become unfitted for doing
the general culture work, not only
for engineering students, but for all
students. The tendency toward
specialization in subjects and sub
divisions of subjects leads to the offer
ing of many undoubtedly valuable
courses. But they are courses for
the specialist, fitted for his needs, and
capable of being understood by but
few. The giving of general culture
courses is discouraged; and there is
some justification, as long as the aim
of many so-called students is merely
to get hours enough to graduate.
The summing up of the results in any
given line of work and its presenta
tion so that the non-specialist may
get a general view of the field is dan
gerous, because of the 'little learning'
thus imparted, which of course is a
'dangerous thing.'
"Even in poetry: 'The learned
guardians of these treasures insist
tliat they cannot be appreciated un
less there has been much preliminary
wrestling with a "critical apparatus"
and much delving among "original
sources.' "
"If the engineering student is to
acquire that general cultural training
the lack of which is often made a re
proach to him, and if the technical
school is to find its lull development
in the university, and not as a separ
ate institution, then the university
must make provision for this much
needed instruction, unless it can be
provided for all students elsewhere.
It will and should lead to the giving
of courses differing in character and
diffeiing in method of presentation
from those now offered to the special
ist, but they may be none the less
both useful and inspiring. It is
necessary for the specialist to know
the methods of study of his specialty;
it is necessary for the general student
to know the results of such study.
Therefore to be both useful and in
spiring such courses must be given


Professor Charles David Marx
by men who are past masters in their
line of work.
Benefit of General Knowledge.
"This will be held by many to be a
plea in favor of superficality, and if
getting a general view of another line
of work is superficiality, why, it is a
superficiality of which many special
ists might well be guilty. The ob
jectors to this kind of general knowl
edge lose sight of the fact that no one
is thoroughly grounded in his own
line of work is likely to be damaged
intellectually by such general informa
tion. Conscious of the limitation of
his knowledge in his own field after
years of study, he is not likely to as
sume that he has mastered â€¢ another
field as a result of a general lecture
course in that subject. The chances
are, however, that the effect will be
to broaden his views, to enlarge his
sympathetic understanding of the
work of the specialist and to create
an atmosphere of mutual respect and
consideration for one another's line of
work.
"In order to give such courses
there must be an increase in the teach
ing force in the various lines of work
in our universities. Certainly the
work of the specialist, upon which
progress in any given field depends,
must not be stinted for the sake of the
seeker after general knowledge. This
is one reason why consolidation of the
technical school with the university,
if the tendency toward specialization
in the latter continues, cannot bring
about economy in instruction. Justi
fication for such consolidation must
be sought elsewhere as shown above.
Not only engineering students but all
students pursuing special studies in a
university, need general courses, and
though it may not be possible for us
to become a nation of engineers, it is
eminently desirable that all educated
persons should have at least some
general knowledge of engineering.
Surely he can not be held to be truly
educated who is ignorant of the con
ditions which surround him, of the
methods by which his daily intellect
ual and physical needs are met.
"This training is not for the pur
pose of making more half-baked ex

is what engineering stands for, and
perhaps the cultural effect of such
work will be admitted. The work is
as altruistic as that of the physician,
as that of the minister. For the spirit
of acquisition, for corporate greed,
the profession of engineering is not
responsible. There has been no fear
expressed of our becoming a nation
of physicians or even of lawyers. The
danger to the commonwealth from a
superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund
ance of engineers. There need be
no danger from either, if the lawyers
and engineers are men of the right
stamp.
Must be Men of Character.
"Moral integrity does not neces
sarily go with cultural training so
called. Men with the broadest of
cultural training may be found in the
pay of corporations striving for illegal

franchises. Political bosses with no
cultural training may be found abet
ting- them. Engineers may probably
be called upon to carry out the work.
The danger to the community lies not
in the character of the work, but in
the character of the man; and a na
tion is in no danger, even if it be
largely a nation of engineers, as long
as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of
knowledge of the engineering of to
day, it would be well indeed. That
these engineers, sent out by our
schools, are making their presence
felt in the world eannot be gainsaid;
that they have contributed to the

wealth. The extent to which en
gineering enters into some of the
most vexing problems of our national
and municipal life is perhaps fully
realized only by men who have an
engineering training. The correct
solution of these problems can in
many cases be given only by en
gineers; but these must be men
trained on broad lines. The charge
is brought not infrequently that the
professional structure which we rear
on the foundation laid in our public
schools is a narrow one, lacking in
windows from which to gain the
necessary outlook for surveying even
one's own field, let alone that of
one's neighbor. The charge is well
founded, but may with equal justice
be brought against students in other
lines of work.
Must Broaden Intellectual Horizon.
"The graduate from a high school
who takes up engineering studies
should be required to broaden his
intellectual horizon before beginning
his professional work. The difficulty
of bringing this about is great, and
the introduction of the elective sys
tem has certainly not helped matters.
The tendency toward early special
ization is constantly increasing, and
one-sided, narrow linguists, historians
and scientists are as much a menace
to the commonwealth as one-sided
engineers. For it must be borne in
mind that the work which the en
gineer is called upon to do is in the
world, implies contact with men and

things and is in its nature broaden
ing. It is cultural in the best sense
of the word, and must therefore react
on him. This does not hold true to
the same extent for the other lines of
work mentioned. In a democracy it
is of the highest importance that
every man realize that the noble
duties of citizenship devolve upon
him; that he has responsibilities other
than those of merely providing the
daily bread for himself and his. We
have a community of interests only
as long as we have common points of
contact; we have the latter only as
we have a broad, common subsidiary
training.
"Admitting that the high school
course of the embryo engineer should
be rounded out with additional work
in language, science, history and
economics, the question arises, where
shall this knowledge be acquired?
For the training of our engineers we
have, broadly speaking, two types
of schools in this country â€”technical
schools pure and simple, such as the
Boston Institute of Technology,
Rensselaer Polytechnic and others,
and engineering departments either
in our colleges of engineering and
mechanic arts, or in our universities.
I group the last two named, because
in both of them some of the general
culture studies mentioned as neces
sary for the broadening of the en
gineer's training are presented merely
from the standpoint of the specialist.
Value of Culture Recognized.
"In the schools of the first type
there is a recognition of the fact that
the general culture courses must be
adapted to the needs of the technical
student. There is a frank acknowl
edgement that these broadening
studies may be made to serve a use
ful purpose, even when they are not
an end to themselves, and that this
does not detract from their value.
The fact is recognized by teachers of
these subjects in purely technical
schools that because the student is

to be a specialist in some line of en
gineering he cannot at the same time
be a specialist in ancient and mod
ern languages, in history, economics
and the pure sciences. From the
engineer's standpoint, as regards the
acquirement of this supplementary
general training, there is much to be
said in favor of the autonomy of
technical schools.
"This, too, is the view at which
the German Society of Engineers has
arrived. As in this country, there
has been a very large increase in the
number of students in the technical
courses in Germany. So large has
this increase been that for a time at
least foreign students in mechanical
engineering were barred at Berlin.
Existing institutions are still so
crowded that the establishment of
new technical schools is contemplated.
The suggestion was made that in
those places where universities existed
and technical schools were needed
the latter might well be incorporated
in the university. At a meeting held
in Munich in September, 1904, which
was attended by representative teach
ers from the technical schools, the
universities, the preparatory schools
and by engineers standing in prac
tice, the following resolution was sub
mitted: 'It is not desirable, in place
of establishing new technical high
schools, to add technical faculties to
existing universities, because both
institutions differ in their character
and method of instruction.' Those
assembled, after laying stress 011 the
fact that members of the engineering
profession should be judged by the
same educational standards as other
educated professional men, adopted
the above resolution in substance, but
in deference to the university men
the last clause of the resolution was
not emphasized. I think, though,
that the correctness of the statement
is generally admitted.
Engineering and the Universities.
"In spite of these conclusions, we

find in this country at least a ten
dency in the opposite direction. In
our strongest State universities and
in others built on private foundations
we find either engineering depart
ments or colleges. The union of
Harvard University and the Institute
of Technology is under consideration.
Something can therefore undoubtedly
be said in favor of this arrangement.
Of course the presence of the 'Sub
limated Tinker' in the university has
been deprecated, but not by the
leaders of educational thought in
America. It is recognized that the
presence of a body of hardworking,
straight-thinking young men in a
university, even if they intend to
make some practical use of their edu
cation, is a good antidote for intellec
tual snobbishness. On the other
hand, it must be conceded that the
technical student too is benefited by
being thrown in contact with men in
other lines of work, many of which
have no direct practical application.
Students become acquainted with one
another, learn to appreciate one an
other's point ol view, and mutual
respect and good will result.
Courses for the Specialist.
"While fully recognizing the ben
efits which come in a general way to
the engineering student from this
environment, it must nevertheless be
asserted that as our universities in
their development follow in the wake
of the German universities, they too,
like them, become unfitted for doing
the general culture work, not only
for engineering students, but for all
students. The tendency toward
specialization in subjects and sub
divisions of subjects leads to the offer
ing of many undoubtedly valuable
courses. But they are courses for
the specialist, fitted for his needs, and
capable of being understood by but
few. The giving of general culture
courses is discouraged; and there is
some justification, as long as the aim
of many so-called students is merely
to get hours enough to graduate.
The summing up of the results in any
given line of work and its presenta
tion so that the non-specialist may
get a general view of the field is dan
gerous, because of the 'little learning'
thus imparted, which of course is a
'dangerous thing.'
"Even in poetry: 'The learned
guardians of these treasures insist
tliat they cannot be appreciated un
less there has been much preliminary
wrestling with a "critical apparatus"
and much delving among "original
sources.' "
"If the engineering student is to
acquire that general cultural training
the lack of which is often made a re
proach to him, and if the technical
school is to find its lull development
in the university, and not as a separ
ate institution, then the university
must make provision for this much
needed instruction, unless it can be
provided for all students elsewhere.
It will and should lead to the giving
of courses differing in character and
diffeiing in method of presentation
from those now offered to the special
ist, but they may be none the less
both useful and inspiring. It is
necessary for the specialist to know
the methods of study of his specialty;
it is necessary for the general student
to know the results of such study.
Therefore to be both useful and in
spiring such courses must be given


Professor Charles David Marx
by men who are past masters in their
line of work.
Benefit of General Knowledge.
"This will be held by many to be a
plea in favor of superficality, and if
getting a general view of another line
of work is superficiality, why, it is a
superficiality of which many special
ists might well be guilty. The ob
jectors to this kind of general knowl
edge lose sight of the fact that no one
is thoroughly grounded in his own
line of work is likely to be damaged
intellectually by such general informa
tion. Conscious of the limitation of
his knowledge in his own field after
years of study, he is not likely to as
sume that he has mastered â€¢ another
field as a result of a general lecture
course in that subject. The chances
are, however, that the effect will be
to broaden his views, to enlarge his
sympathetic understanding of the
work of the specialist and to create
an atmosphere of mutual respect and
consideration for one another's line of
work.
"In order to give such courses
there must be an increase in the teach
ing force in the various lines of work
in our universities. Certainly the
work of the specialist, upon which
progress in any given field depends,
must not be stinted for the sake of the
seeker after general knowledge. This
is one reason why consolidation of the
technical school with the university,
if the tendency toward specialization
in the latter continues, cannot bring
about economy in instruction. Justi
fication for such consolidation must
be sought elsewhere as shown above.
Not only engineering students but all
students pursuing special studies in a
university, need general courses, and
though it may not be possible for us
to become a nation of engineers, it is
eminently desirable that all educated
persons should have at least some
general knowledge of engineering.
Surely he can not be held to be truly
educated who is ignorant of the con
ditions which surround him, of the
methods by which his daily intellect
ual and physical needs are met.
"This training is not for the pur
pose of making more half-baked ex
perts, prepared to pass snap judg
ments on matters beyond their ken,
but for the purpose of teaching them
the importance of solving the prob
lems of manufacture, distribution and
transportation correctly. These prob
lems, translated, stand for the pro
viding of material and mental food for
the masses, the betterment of their
conditions of living,for healthy homes,
for the pure air, the pure earth, the
pure water of the sanitarian, for the
intellectual growth which is made
possible by freeing man from soul and
mind-killing drudgery. Publicservice
is what engineering stands for, and
perhaps the cultural effect of such
work will be admitted. The work is
as altruistic as that of the physician,
as that of the minister. For the spirit
of acquisition, for corporate greed,
the profession of engineering is not
responsible. There has been no fear
expressed of our becoming a nation
of physicians or even of lawyers. The
danger to the commonwealth from a
superabundance of lawyers may be
greater than that from a superabund
ance of engineers. There need be
no danger from either, if the lawyers
and engineers are men of the right
stamp.
Must be Men of Character.
"Moral integrity does not neces
sarily go with cultural training so
called. Men with the broadest of
cultural training may be found in the
pay of corporations striving for illegal

franchises. Political bosses with no
cultural training may be found abet
ting- them. Engineers may probably
be called upon to carry out the work.
The danger to the community lies not
in the character of the work, but in
the character of the man; and a na
tion is in no danger, even if it be
largely a nation of engineers, as long
as these men are men of character.
Such men our engineering schools are
trying to train and send out into the
world. Some of them as yet may be
lacking in general training, but no
one feels this shortcoming more
keenly than these very men. If
others were as conscious of their own
shortcomings, of their woeful lack of
knowledge of the engineering of to
day, it would be well indeed. That
these engineers, sent out by our
schools, are making their presence
felt in the world eannot be gainsaid;
that they have contributed to the
mental and moral uplifting of this na
tion no one who thinks deeply will
deny."
