# "Get in the Game and Stay in It to the End"
## President Jordan Talks to the Young Graduates of Scholarship in Terms of Action. 
### 
PRESIDENT David Starr Jordan
i spoke the final words of advice
and farewell to the graduating class
after the presentation of the diplomas.
Discussing "Scholarship in Terms of
Action," lie urged the graduates to
"get into the game" of life and stay
in it to the end. His address follows:
"It is my privilege to say a final
word to you, men and women of
Stanford, as you go out to turn your
Stanford training to the affairs of life;
and in my message I have a single
thought. Whatever you have ac
quired should bean impulse to action.
If you have planned somewhat, then
carry out your plans. If you have
learned the nature of something, then
turn your knowledge into execution.
If you have gained higher aspirations
these count for nothing except as you
try to make them good. If your
hearts have heen touched by a warmer
glow, then your neighbors should feel
the warmth. There is no virtue in
knowledge, in training, in emotion,
or in aspiration except as you use
them in the conduct of life.
"And the conduct of life is not a
negative thing,—to commit no crimes,
to keep out of jail, and to await until
things come to you. This is not
living. This is not righteousness.
To do nothing wrong is not to live
aright. For living is a most positive
matter, moving things, changing
things, using man and matter to ac
complish the results which seem to
you worth while. Find out the
powers you have, so as not to waste
them. The university has helped you
to do that; then spend them all on
the best things you know, the great
est you can understand and the largest
you can master.
Get Into the Game of Life.
"There is a homely phrase which
you can learn by heart in a second of
time and keep with you forever after.
It is derived from the play of your
football field, and it is this: 'Get into
the game.' Every Stanford man or
woman is by birthright from his alma
mater a member of the first team.
Therefore much is expected of him,
not by others, but by himself. Un
less he takes hold and stays by he is
not in the play. He ceases to count
as he ought to count. He is not true
to Stanford traditions. It is not so
much matter what the play is so long
as it worth the while. Still less does
it matter whether you win or lose, as
the bleachers measure winning. For
the lookers cannot tell how the game
is going. In the great struggles of the
world we do not pick the winner un
til two or three generations after his
body is dead. Then we know him,

for his soul goes marching on. 'Truth
is ever on the scaffold; wrong forever
on the throne. Yet that scaffold sways
the future, * *
"Get into the game, somehow,
somewhere. Carry your thoughts
over into action. Do your part, and
the greatest surprise of your life will
come on the day when you find out
how great that part may be. Plan
for all you can. If you keep the clean
brain, the pure heart, and the noble
soul, then life will be all too short for
what you may accomplish. Then
your inspiration will be the strength
of those who follow you. ' There is
always room for the man of force, and
he makes room for many.'
"And as the bugle sounds and the
game begins, there is another word
of advice which you should take, for
you will need it later on. Stay in
the game. That is the main thing
after all. Don't quit at the first
bruise; don't crawl away when you
feel the breath knocked out of you.
Keep in the play as long as there is
a play, as long as you arc yourself.
"How long is a man himself?
This is a question which the doctors
are talking about a good deal just
now. Some claim that fifteen precious
years, from twenty-five to forty, mean
the life work of a man. For the av
erage man it may be, but not for the
Stanford man. Half the men you
know, perhaps, give themselves up
at forty. They retire from initiative,
from responsibility, from thinking or
reading or learning anything new.
Their cushions, their stimulants, their
narcotics, and their prejudices—all
these mark the round of their lives.
Half as many more wither long be
fore they have reached the age of
forty. The sadness of old age is not
in its physical failure, the creaking
joints, the inelastic veins, the droop
ing stature. It lies in the loss of im
pulse to action, the failure of ambi
tions, the waning of enthusiasms.
There are men who are old, very old,
at twenty-five —older than you ought

to be should you live to the age of a
hundred.
Should Be No Loss of Interest.
" It is not necessary to lose your
interest in the game when you step
to the iside-lines as an emeritus.
There is just as much to do as there
ever was and just as much fun in do
ing your part of it. When Jefferson
left the presidency of the United
States it was not to repine over the
ingratitude of republics. The great
est work of his life inspired his old
age, the building of the University of
Virginia. In this stately old univer
sity the past history of the Old Do
minion, the intellectual history of
the South, has been written. In this
progressive new university, reborn
only a month ago, the future history
of Virginia and the greater Virginia
which arises wherever Virginia's sons
may go, will find its impulses to ac
tion.
" Not long ago, in Texas, I saw a
letter from Robert E. Lee to one of
his students while he was president of
a college after the war was over. The
helping of young men was to him a
greater privilege than victory in
battle. The greatest general of mod
ern times, because a great soul as
well as a great general, his heart was
as warm and his hand as busy with
the affairs of the youth at the College
ofWashington and Lee as ever they
were in his days of physical vigor at
the head of a mighty army.
Mrs. Stanford's Strong Example.
"And to come to events and ex
periences that are nearer to our own
hearts, we have in the work of the
noble woman whom we love an illus
tration close to our hearts. In 1893,
at the death of her honored husband,
the tremendous task of saving a great
estate from panic and litigation in a
time when all credit was paralyzed,
when huge fortunes melted like snow
in a spring wind, and the equally
great task of bending all the re

sources of the saved estate to the
building of a great university in a
new country along new and untried
lines, fell on Mrs. Stanford. She was
no longer young when the responsi
bility came to her. She had reached
the age when men and women of less
heroic mould retire from responsi
bility and the strain of action. But
in the mightiness of the interests at
stake and in the urgency of the need
she found herself. It was for this
that a long life of love and self-devo
tion had prepared her. Because she
had faith in the worth of life, she
lived it to the full. Her wisdom and
her courage, her hope and love, she
kept to the very end of her life. In
her last words to the student body,
read before you only a few days ago,
as in all words spoken by her in
these twelve eventful years, she has
never shrunk from her duty and has
never lost sight of the final purpose
of her work. She has done her part
fully. She has done what she could.
And this is my last thought, the
mighty possibility there is when one
has done all that he can; when one
has so lived that from beginning to
the end and one has turned all his
best possibilities into action; when the
man that you ought to have been is
the same as the man you are.
" So, men and women of Stanford,
take your places in the movement of
life. Whatever the fates may throw
up to you, it is worth your while to
take it. Be in the race in the begin
ning, stay with it to the end, even if
it be a relay of a dozen generations.
Never flinch, and never doubt, and
some day, somewhere, somehow, the
meed of the winner will be surely
vours."
