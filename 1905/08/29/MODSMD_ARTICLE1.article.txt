# THREE VETERANS RETURN.
## COACH LANAGAN WILL FORM TEAM FROM GREEN PLAYERS First Practice To Be Held On Oval September 11th.--Bansbach Will Have Charge of Freshmen. 
### 
Only three veterans of the mag
nificent eleven which chainpioned
the Cardinal on the gridiron last
year have returned to college as a
nucleus for the team which Coach
Lanagan will develop this season.
The task which confronts the
coaches is a severe one, but the re
turn of a number of second team

men, who were hut slightly inferior
to their Varsity rivals, will simplify
the problem.
Several of the second team play
,ers who performed brilliantly in
the backfield have signified their
intention of returning to college,
and at least one substitute line
man will again be seen on the foot
ball oval. All of these players are
distinct Varsity possibilities, and
with the assistance of the new ma
terial from 1909 the prospect of a
victorious football season is far
from being gloomy. In prepara
tion for the season which is about
to open Head-Coach J. F. Lanagan,
'00. and his assistant, L. P. Bans
bach, '05, have been on the campus
for several weeks. When the can
didates for the Varsity and Fresh
man teams appear for their first
practice the plan 6 of the coaches
will be complete, and the system
will be carried out without inter
ruption until the end of theseason.
Contrary to the general impres
sion, the Freshman game will not
be held on the Stanford campus
this year. In arranging the sched
ule for the season the Stanford
management anticipated that the
new football field would not be
completed in time for the game, so

it was agreed to hold the contest on
California Field in Berkeley.
The three veterans of last year's
eleven who have returned to col
lege are R. A. Thompson, '05, A. J.
Chalmers, '07, and E. P. Stott, '07.
Thompson is one of the most con
sistent guards who has ever played
on a Stanford team. He made the
Varsity in 1901, hut was not in col
lege during the football season of
1902. In the 6to 6 game of 1903
he made a name for himself by his
playing against Overall. The big
guard played a star game against
California last year. A. J. Chal
mers, '07, has played half-back on
the Varsity for the past two years.
He made all three of the touch
downs against California, and he is
rated as one of the most aggressive
half-backs on the Coast. E. P.
Stott, '07, made the Varsity as
quarter-back last year when Bans
bach was compelled to retire from
the game on account of injuries
received early in the contest. Stott
uses his head well, and is a clever
runner in scattered field.
Head-Coach Lanagan, '00, is con
fident that Stanford will lie repre
sented by a team which will be a
credit to the University. In an in
terview this afternoon he said: "We
have no reason to be unduly opti
mistic over the football situation,
but on the other hand we have no
reason to feel depressed at our
prospect of winning the big game.
All indications seem to point to a
wealth of good green material, but
whether or not we can mold the
new players into a winning team
can only be decided by the game
with California. One thing is cer
tain, however, and that is we can
not possibly win unless every man

who has the remotest chance of
making the team appears on the
gridiron for practice. The three
veterans who have returned are
all fighters, and if the green play
ers are animated hy the same spirit
we have no cause to despair."
L. P. Bansbach, '05, the assistant
coach, will have almost exclusive
charge of the Freshman squad, as
Lanagan will he fully occupied
with the green aspirants for the
Varsity. Bansbach'e thorough
knowledge of Lanagan's system in
sures the utmost harmony between
the two coaches.
The first practice will be held
Monday afternoon, September 11 th,
on the old football oval, which iH
being rapidly put into shape. It
has been harrowed and sprinkled,
and the surface will be given h
fresh covering of sawdust.
On Friday night, September Bth,
the first football rally of the season
will be held. All of the men of
the University will be expected to
assemble in theclubroom of Encina
Hall for the occasion. President
Cunha of the Associated Students
will have charge of the meeting,
and the coaches, captain, trainer,
and members of the faculty will
speak.
No captain has been selected, but
absent members of last year's team
are telegraphing their choice for
the position. As it is difficult to
reach some of the old players it
may be some time before the re
sult of the balloting is known.
