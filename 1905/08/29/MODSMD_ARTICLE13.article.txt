# DEPARTMENTS MOVED.
## NEW ENGINEERING BUILDING TO BE OCCUPIED. Students of Hygiene and Mineralogy Will Also Have New Quarters. Mining Building Will Not Be Finished. 
### 
The work of moving and rear
ranging several departments of
the University has been going on
during the summer vacation. The
Department of Hygiene is being
moved from its present quarters and
will occupy the building in which
the Mineralogy Department is now
located.
The Department of Mineralogy
will occupy both the building now
being used by the Hygiene Depart
ment and one of the new buildings
on the outer quadrangle which has
been constructed especially for this
department.
The new Mining building on the
southwest corner of the outer quad
rangle will not be completed for a
year, and the Department of Geol
ogy and Mining will remain in its
present location until its new quar
ters are finished.
The increase of students in the
Mechanical, Civil and Electrical
Engineering departments of the
University during the past few
years has been so great that this
year the magnificent new Engi
neering building will be occupied
by the students in these courses.
This building has been com
pleted for two years, but up to this
time the present quarters have been
ample accommodation for the engi
neering scholars. Workmen are
now busy installing in the new
structure the chairs, desks, tables
and other fixtures for classroom
work.
A large force of men have also
been busy upon the interior of the
Botany, Zoology, Psychology, En
tomology and Physics buildings.
The work has been spent in finish
ing the wood-work, and placing a
large number of shelves, bookcases
and various interior furnishings
that are needed in the laboratories
and recitation rooms.
