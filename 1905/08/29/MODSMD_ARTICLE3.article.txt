# NEW ATHLETIC FIELD.
## GOOD PROGRESS MADE DURING SUMMER ON GRIDIRON. In Spite of Many Delays Grading Is Completed and Bleachers Will Be in Place for Big Game.--Cost to Be $15,000. 
### 
In spite of many discourage
ments and delays the work on the
new athletic Held during the sum
mer lias progressed as well as pos
sible; and notwithstanding all re
ports to the contrary, the Cardinal
and Blue and Gold will meet in
the intercollegiate game upon the
new Stanford gridiron.
The history of the work on the
Held during the summer is one of
disappointment and trouble. But
the fact that all of the contracts
entered into by the Training House
Corporation call for satisfactory
completion l>y the 21st of October
under penalty of large sums for
every day after that date, lessens
the danger that the field will not
be completed. *
All of the trees on the ground
to be occupied by the bleachers
have been felled or dynamited
and tfie wood is being rapid
ly carted away. The grading has
beell completed, and the ground is
ready for the ploughing and har
rowing. The water-pipes for wet
ting the field have been laid and
are ready for use. Half the lum
ber for the bleachers is on the
ground, and within two weeks a
large force of carpenters will be at
work raising the heavy uprights on
concrete foundations which are
ready to receive them.
A full month before college
closed the contracts for removing
the trees and grading had been let,
and by the 15th of June the field
was practically in shape for the
erection of the bleachers.
Meanwhile Professor C. B. Wing
of the Department of Civil Engi
neering had been drawing the plans
for the lofty bleachers, which are to
encircle the gridiron on three sides.
By the middle of June these plans
were completed, approved by the
Training House Corporation, and
passed on to the Hoard of Trustees
for their final approval.
Then came the first of a long
series of delays. For three weeks
the board labored in vain to get a
quorum in order to view and offic
ially pass upon the plans. At last
a majority was secured, but then
more trouble arose. In his specifi
cations Professor Wing provided
for the dovetailing of certain joints
to the uprights of the bleachers
instead of using the heavy bolts
which were employed in building
California's bleachers. The matter
was referred from committee to
committee and was delayed for
three long weeks while the piles of
lumber lay idle around the field.
Late in July it was decided to use
bolts and the specifications were
then passed.
The new bleachers will be forty
feet deep and will rise from their
foundation to a height equal to
those on California's new field.
They will sweep around in a per
fect horseshoe, enclosing the grid
