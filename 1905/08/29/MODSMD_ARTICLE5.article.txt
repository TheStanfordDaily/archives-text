The members of the incoming
Freshman class will register to
morrow. This class gives every
evidence of being one of the largest
and strongest that has entered the
University for some time. When
the members of 1909 enroll them
selves they should not forget to pay
the student body assessment of one
dollar. This assessment is to help
defray the athletic expenses of the
University, and as the expense thin
year will be much greater than in
the past, due to the construction of
the new athletic field, it is essential
that every student should help the
athletic association by becoming a
member.
