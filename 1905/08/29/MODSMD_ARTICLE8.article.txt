# PROPOSED ELECTRIC LINE.
## Large Force of Surveyors at Work To-day on the Campus. 
### 
A party of surveyors who are
engaged in surveying a route for
the proposed interurban electric
line between San Mateo and Han
Jose to-day commenced operations
upon the University campus. It is
proposed to connect Palo Alto with
the main line of this system, and
the branch required for this pur
pose will in all probability pass
through the campus.
The final route has not been
determined. There are at present
three rights of way under con
sideration. One would pass to
the north of the University, and the
other two to thesouth. The actual
work performed upon the estate to
day would indicate that the line
would enter the grounds in the
vicinity of College Terrace and
traverse Lasuen street to some
point in the rear of the Engineer
ing buildings, at which point a
station for the University traffic
will probably be situated and the
road continue on to Palo Alto, tak
ing a course parallel to the avenue.
The new project is being backed
by the Interurban Electric Com
pany of San Jose, and will consti
tute a part of that system.
