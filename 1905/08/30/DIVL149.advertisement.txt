WISH GUILD REMOVED.
People of Palo Alto Fear Contagion
and Protest Against the Hospital.
The Board of Trustees of Palo
Alto has protested to the Students'
Guild against the continued main
tenance of the Guild Hospital in
Palo Alto. The people of the town
object to the danger of the spread of
contagious diseases, occasioned by
the treating of sick students in the
center of the town, as typified by
the diphtheria epidemic.
The trustees have placed the
matter in the hands of the District
Attorney, and in case they are suc
cessful in enforcing their demands,
the student body will lie heavy
losers..
The Guild, however, denies that
the Palo Alto trustees have the
power to interfere with the hospital
at the present time, and asserts that
any objection should have been
made when the property was pur
chased. Although the Guild is
firm in this declaration, it wishes
to avoid trouble with the Board of
Trustees, and for that reason is at
present considering the advisabil
ity of admitting patients from Palo
Alto to the hospital in the future.
I During the summer extensive
i improvments have been made in
the hospital at an expense of $400.
I The main building has been con
nected with the annex by a passage
! way, and a complete lighting and
heating system has been installed
j in both buildings.
