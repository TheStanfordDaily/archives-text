FINANCIAL FAILURE.
California Summer School Manage
ment Faces Big Deficit. —Stan-
ford Students Attend.
Financially the summer session
at the University of California was
a failure, for the management found
a deficit of more than $1000 at the
close of the six weeks. This hig de
ficit was caused because of the de
crease in registration from the year
before.
The Stanford faculty reserved
the right this year to allow stu
dents to register only in approved
courses. Another stipulation not
previously in vogue, and adopted
this year, was that all grades must
be better than third section. This
worked a decided hardship on some
of the Stanford students who at
tended the summer school.
Among the more prominent edu
cators and instructors from abroad
and from American institutions
were Professor Wilhelm Ostwald of
Leipzig University, Prof. Ludwig
Baltzmann of the University of
Vienna, Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites
of Wisconsin, Prof. J. Mark Maid
win of Johns Hopkins, Prof.Thom
as D. Seymour of Yale, Prof. A. A.
Stanley of Michigan, and Mrs.
Anna liotsford Comstock of Cor
