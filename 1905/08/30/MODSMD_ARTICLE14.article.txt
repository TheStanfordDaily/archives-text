Shortly after noon on last Friday
an alarm for fire was blown for the
Cooksey place. The fire was found
to be in a stubble field near French
man's Lake, and the engine was
drawn to that point by the stu

was found to be under control, men
from a nearby field having checked
it with wet sacks. The engine was
used to good effect, however, in sub
duing the blaze that remained.
Had the fire gotten a good start,
serious damage might have re
sulted. The origin of the blaze is
unknown.
