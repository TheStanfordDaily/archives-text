### 
Gardner Kenny, a student of the
Franklin Grammar School of San
Jose, was drowned in Lagunita
on the afternoon of June 17th.
Kenny had gone bathing in the
lake with some of his young com
panions, and while swimming to
the boat-house from the wooden
stand which operates the flood-gate
he was overcome and went down.
The water was very rough on ac
count of a high wind, and it was
over forty minutes before the body
was recovered. Medical aid was
summoned, but no heart action
could be restored. The spot where
the body went down is identical
with that where Robert Fountain,
'05, was drowned last May.
