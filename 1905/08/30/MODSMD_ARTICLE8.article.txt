The Varsity football schedule as
announced for the coining season
contains a list of games with the
different college and university
elevens of the Pacific Coast. The
list of college teams is considerably
larger than usual, and the games
with these new elevens will un
doubtedly result in Stanford's good
name being carried to their section
of the country and on future regis
tralion days the effect will be evi
dent.
The list of teams does not con
tain that of any club eleven. This
is another step in the right direc
tion. During past seasons club
elevens from about the bay have
been opponents of the Varsity, but
the benefit derived from practice
games with them has always been
questionable, and the actions of
several of their players during the
contests rendered future games
with these teams undesirable.
