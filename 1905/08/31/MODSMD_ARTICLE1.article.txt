# BOOKSTORE STARTED
## NEW BUILDING TO BE LOCATED ON LASUEN STREET. Foundation Has Been Laid and Work on the Structure Will Be Rushed. 
### 
The work of erecting the new
University bookstore has been
started. The building is located
at the corner of Alvarado row and
Lasuen street, fronting on the lat
ter. The structure, including the
fixtures and furnishings, will cost
at least $10,000.
The new store will be Mission
style, with a roofing of red tile. It
is to be constructed of brick with a
concrete veneer. The structure is
one-story with a basement, and the
outside measurements are 41x85
feet. This will allow about five
times as much space as in the pres
ent building occupied by the book
store.
The new structure is being built
by the Stanford University Book
store Corporation, which is com
posed of a few members of the fac
ulty and officers of the University.
It is the object of the corporation
to carry on a book and stationery
business for the accommodation of
the students and faculty, and all of
the profits above running expenses
are taken to run the store. For
nine years a part of the earning of
each year has gone to a building
fund for the new store. At the
present time the greater part of the
capital necessary is on hand and
the rest of it will be raised soon.
In the new location the book
store will be under the same man
agement as at present. The build
ing will contain one large room
which will be finished in Mission
style and which will be the sales
room. In the north end of the new
building will be a suite of offices,
and in the northeast corner will be
a sample room which will contain
something new. In this room all
of the large publishers will have on
display their books, and faculty
members and others interested may
go there and inspect sample copies.
This room will have a reading
table and it will he free to the pub
lic who wish to use the sample
lines.
Down the center of the main
room will be a row of book-stacks
similar to those in the Library, and
in these the text-books will be kept.
Just west of these a row of glass
showcases will he placed the entire
length of the building and the diff
erent lines of goods displayed from
them. Against the west wall of
the building will be six wall dis
play cases in which new goods will
be shown. Along the back or last
wall will be shelves used for stock.
In the southeast corner of the
building will be a general store
room. The basement will be used
for the same purpose and for the
furnace.
Many thought that it would
mar the beauty of the campus
to have the new store in such
a place, but this will not be the
case as there will be nothing to
show that it is a store. The build

ing will be one of the most beauti
ful on the rows and there will be
no show-windows or signs placed
outside.
