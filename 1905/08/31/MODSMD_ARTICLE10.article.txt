The Freshman class have broken
all previous registration figures.
They enter Stanford stronger in
numbers than any former class and
with all the possibilities of making
a good record.
It is essential in every class, in
order to have any spirit and pride,
that the members of that class must
know each other at least by sight.
The average entering Freshman
knows hut a few of his classmates,
and it is not until the end of the
first semester, at the earliest, that
he gains a fair idea who his fellows
are.
To remedy this fault the first and
most feasible plan is to have them
wear something distinctive. A
plain cardinal cap with a white
button would seem appropriate.
But it matters not the color, if
some emblem be adopted that serve
to show them who their fellow
classmates are and thus hind them
closer together. Tn time it should
become as settled a custom as the
Senior sombrero and Junior plug.
