### 
An event of extreme interest in
Western intercollegiate circles was
held 011 the waters of Puget Sound
shortly after the close of college,
when, on May 30th, Stanford, Cal
ifornia and Washington met in a
three-cornered regatta.
The Varsity crew, composed of
W. H. Dole, ex-'O5, captain and
stroke; B. Bryan, '06, No. 2; N. P.
Bryan, '07, No. 3; H. G. Butter-
Held, '05, bow; F. W. Turner, '08,
coxswain, and the Freshman crew
consisting of E. N. Smith, stroke;
R. H. Conant, No. 2; L. R. Gay,

coxswain, took passage by steamer
from San Francisco for Seattle im
mediately after the close of college.
The time before the regatta was
Bpent in practice and hard training.
Conditions on the day of the race
were somewhat unfavorable. A
light rain and bead wind served to
keep down the time,but even then
the California Varsity covered tho
course of a miieanda half in 13:50,
setting a new mark for those waters.
Two starts were necessary for the
Varsity race, Stanford breaking an
oar on the first attempt. At the
second start Washington and Cali
fornia took the lead and the latter
boat kept it throughout the whole
race, finishing some dozen lengths
in front of the other boats. Stan
ford and Washington made a hard
tight for second pi ace, and although
the referee's decision favored the
latter, the finish was so close that
there were some that thought Stan
ford had beaten the northern crew.
The plucky crew of 1908, wearing
the cardinal, won their race with
ease, not only easily distancing their
competitors, but also coming within
ten seconds of the fast time set by
the Blue and Gold Varsity, cover
ing the course in 14 minutes flat.
California took second ten lengths
in the rear, and Washington trailed
hopelessly behind.
