# BOAT CLUB TO GIVE FARCE.
## Will Attempt to Remove Debt. â€” No Fall Training This Semester. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club intends,
in the near future, to give a farce
to help remove the big deficit caused
by theexpensesof last season. They
expect to give the play before the
big game with the University of
California in order that it may not
conflict with any other student pro
duction.
The plav will he some modern
farce, and ihe cast will be picked,
without try-outs, from those who
are already well known in student
theal ricals.
The northern trip of the Varsity
and Freshman crews, to compete
with the Universities of California
and Washington, cost the Stanford
student body $185, which sum was
one-half of the transportation ex
pense of the men and shell. The
other half of the transportation
and the expenses of the men while
in Seattle was paid by the Univer
sity of Washington.
The crews were entertained at the
Seattle Athletic Club and Coach
Knight,snd Manager Evans extend
ed every courtesy to the visiting
oarsmen.
Another important problem faced
by the club is that of procuring a
coach for the coming season, as
Coach Gaither will not return to
Stanford.
