# FIVE HUNDRED LIMIT
## WOMEN STUDENTS EXCEEDING THIS NUMBER DEBARRED. Misleading Story to Effect that Any Number of Woman with Full Standing May Enter. 
### 
An ambiguous announcement,
made during the summer, regard
ing the much-discussed five hun
dred limit of women students at
Stanford, has caused considerable
misunderstanding among Btudents
as well as outsiders. The number
of women studentß at Stanford will
never be more than five hundred.
This is irrevocable. This rule was
made during Mrs. Stanford's life
and will not be changed.
During the first years of the UDi
versity there was little trouble con
cerning this rule, as the number of
women students desiring entrance
was always less than five hundred.
At the beginning all women were
admitted either as regular, gradu
ate or special student*. Those with
partial standing were likewise ad
mitted. Several years ago a new
contingency arose. It was found
that unless some restriction was
made to decrease the number of
women entrants registration day
would find more than the regular
number applying for entrance. Con
sequently women students with
partial standing were denied ad
mittance. This proved adequate
until a year ago, when it was clear
that unless a restriction was made
there would again be more than
five hundred women to enter. Spec
ial students among the women were
at that time denied admission, and
only those with full standing could
enter. These restrictions have
proved adequate this fall, but will
probably not prove adequate in
keeping the number down next fall.
As the number applying increases
the restrictions will be made more
severe, and the story to the effect
that any number of women students
with full standing, exceeding five
hundred, may enter, is false.
