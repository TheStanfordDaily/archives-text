## Aggressive Half-back Will Lead Varsity Football Team This Season.—Has Played Two Years. 
### 
A. J. Chalmers, '07, will lead the
Varsity eleven this season. For
some time Manager K. W. Barrett
has been in correspondence with
the absent members of the team
for the purpose of ascertaining their
choice of a captain to fill the place
of Captain-elect. W. K. Sprott, ex
'o6, who will not return to college
this year.
With one exception the votes of
all of the former members of the
team were secured, and the result
showed that A. J. Chalmers had
received a clear majority of all the
votes cast. The committee in
charge of the election —\V. F. Du
rand, R. W. Barrett and Dr. F.
Angell —have declared Chalmers
duly elected to lead the Varsity.
The newly chosen captain made
the Varsity in his Freshman year,

playing 11:■ 1 f-b.ick in the G to G
game. In the 18 to 0 game Chal

downs made by Stanford. He
played right half-back last season.

game, and i< one of the most con
sistent ground gainers that has
ever playtd on a Stanford team.
His two years under Lanagan's
coaching has given him an exten
sive knowledge of the latter's system
so he will he of great assistance in
developing the new material.

suits. The old men will receive
their uniforms from 8 to 10, and
