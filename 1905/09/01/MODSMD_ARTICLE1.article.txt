# GUILD MEETING HELD
## THE 						HOSPITAL WILL TAKE PATIENTS FROM PALO ALTO. Those Who Are Not Members of the Guild May Now Receive Treatment. 
### 
At a meeting of the Students'
Guild, held yesterday at four
o'clock, it was voted to admit to
the hospital the people of Palo
Alto and vicinity who are not mem
bers of the Guild. Such patients
will be charged four dollars a day
for regular nursing and extra for
special nursing.
This action of the Guild has
grown out of the controversy over
the petition of the people of Palo
Alto, who objected to the treatment
of contagious diseases in their
midst without being permitted the
use of the hospital.
The people of Palo Alto, after
this concession on the part of the
Guild, will take no further action
against the existence of the hospi
tal, especially as the Guild is ex
pecting to build a new hospital
aome time in the future.
A new regulation regarding the
treatment of the patients from the
faculty was also passed by the
Guild. In the future the members
of thefaculty and any of their im
mediate family may become mem
bers of the Guild on payment of
the regular fee of two dollars within
one month after registration day.
Such patients will be charged a
dollar and a half a day while in
the hospital.
Managers, coaches, and trainers
of the athletic teams may now be
come members of the Guild under
the same conditions as members of
the faculty.
The Guild also voted to increase
the number of trained nurses from
two to three, as the extensive en
largement and improvement of the
hospital demands a larger corps of
trained help.
