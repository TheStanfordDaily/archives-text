# PUBLISH NEW BOOKS
## DR. JORDAN AND PROF. KELLOGG AUTHORS OF VOLUMES. Publications of Great Scientific Value Are Issued During the Summer Months. 
### 
During the summer several books
of great value to the scientific world
have been published by Stanford
men. The report of Dr. Jordan,
who in conjunction with Dr. Gil
bert and Barton W. Evermann
conducted an expedition to the
Hawaiian Islands for the purpose
of examining the fish of that region,
was issued by the Government in
July. The reports consist of two
volumes, entitled "The Aquatic Re
sources of the Hawaiian Islands."
The first volume deals with the
shore fishes of the islands, and is
illustrated with beautiful colored
plates and black and white draw
ings of the various species. The
second volume is the work of Dr.
Gilbert and treats of the deep-Bea
varieties found in those waters.
The books embrace the results of
several expeditions by members of
the United States Fish Commis
sion. The collections made on
these trips are the most important
so far gathered in the Pacific. They
embrace many thousands of speci
mens of fishes, crustaceans, mol
lusks, and other invertebrates. In
writing the complete report Dr.
Jordan consulted numerous reports
and papers previously written on
the subject, giving it a thorough
and exhaustive treatment. The
books are officially entitled "The
Bulletin of the United States Fish
Commission, Volumes XXIII and
XXIV."
There has also been published by
Dr. Jordan another book dealing
with fish, entitled "A Guide to the
Study of Fishes." It is written
with the view of reaching anglers
and nature lovers as well as the
technical student. In two large
volumes the structure, habits, evo
lution, and economic valueof fishes
are set forth.
"American Insects" is the title of
a book by Vernon L. Kellogg, pro
fessor of Entomology and lecturer
in Bionomics. The book contains
nearly seven hundred pages, and is
illustrated with beautiful colored
plates. It provides in a single
volume a general systematic ac
count of all the principal groups of
insects as they occur in America.
This book is intended for the gen
eral reader as well as the student,
but few technical terms being used.
The hook is dedicated to Professor
J. H. Comstock of Cornell Univer
sity, at one time professor of Ento
mology at Stanford.
