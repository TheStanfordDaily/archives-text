### 
The report that the appoint
ment of Professor H. J. Ryan of
Cornell to be head of the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering
would mean a radical change in
the administration of this depart
ment is vigorously denied. There
will not he any raising of the re
quirements necessary to graduation
in Electrical Engineering, and the
prevailing idea that Professor Ry
an's advent would mean the adop
tion of the Cornell system at Stan
ford is erroneous.
Professor Ryan hopes to be able
to give all the courses prescribed in
the Register, but he will not attempt
any changes or additions to these
until he has had ample opportu
nity to become acquainted with the
local needs and conditions. There
will not be any apparatus added
to the laboratory department at
present, but Professor Ryan hopes
in the near future to add to the
equipment until the laboratory is
equal to the finest in the United
States
