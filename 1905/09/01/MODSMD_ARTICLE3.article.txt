# MANY VETERANS BACK
## FOOTBALL PROSPECTS AT CALIFORNIA BRIGHT. J.W. Knibbs Jr. and Dr. F.B. Griffin of Dartmouth Secured as Head and Assistant Coach to Take Charge of California. 
### 
Although there is ati apparent
dearth of heavy line-men, the foot
ball prospects at the University of
California are anything hut dis
couraging.
With the advent of J. W. Knibbs
Jr. and Dr. F. B. Griffin of Dart
mouth as head and adjutant coach
respectively, and the inauguration
of a new style of play, the Blue and
Gold followers feel certain that
their season will be a successful
one.
Head-Coach Knibbs graduated
from Dartmouth last spring. He

played on his college team several
years, including last year, when lie
captained the eleven, which played
Harvard a nothing to nothing
game. He comes to California
with the highest recommendations
from the leading coaches of the
East.
The football season at Califor
nia opened Monday, August 21st,
when sixty candidates for the Var
sity presented themselves to the
new coaches. Several of the moe
prominent old men have tint \et
reported for work. California l<>»e«
Captain Stroud,center; Heiunnller,
tackle; Kerr, substitute guard; and
White and substitute half
backs of last year's eleve< Huff
ey and Taylor, who substituted t

center and guard, and Stern who
played a guard position for a few
minutes during the big game, are
the only heavy material upon
which California can pin any hopes
for the center trio. Foster, Sea
bury, Allen and Stow are the most
likely other men for the line.
Captain Force, tackle, and Gray,
guard, will probably play their old
positions again this year. .Captain
Force may be moved to a guard
position if the candidates for tackle
render this advisable.
The ends who played last year,
Elliott and Kittrelle, are back at
college and are eligible to play.
They are by no means sure of their
positions, as a wealth of good ma
terial for these places has reported
for work. Herriott, Zacharias,
Coogan, Mclnnes and Jordan are
the most likely candidates.
California's back field will pre
sent a formidable appearance.
Sperry, Snedigar, and Kern will
again try for their positions, and
little concern is manifested regard
ing the back field. Other m«n who
will try for the back field are Mead,
Tuller and Boynton.
At quarter-back Boothe seems the
only candidate with experience.
De Armond, Whitman, and Gear\
will endeavor to replace him at
passing the ball.
A new innovation has been in
t.roduced !>y Coach Knibhs. The
football squad will not have the
usual rest on Saturdays, hut will
report for work as on the other five
days of the week.
Forty-five freshmen have report
ed for practice. Lack of enthus
iasm among the men, coupled win
the poor training quarters with
which Coach Knihhs has to con
tend, causes him much distress.
The old training quarters are be
ing thoroughly repaired and can
not possibly be used before thre»
or four weeks. In tlie meanwhile,
the temporary quarters will he lo
cated in a small three room Cot
tage.
On Monday practice «as begui
on California Field for the first tin .
this year The e acitep have in-ti
tuted a new system "t -eciet pra>
