Perhaps iio project undertaken
by the alumni has met with more
enthusiastic approbation than the
plan to have President Jordan's
portrait painted by the celebrated
artist Sargent of London. This tri
bute to our honored President is not
without precedent, as well-beloved
professors in several Eastern uni
versities have been similarly hon
ored; but the present subscription
is unique, inasmuch as it is not
confined exclusively to a few rich
alumni. The proposition to limit
the subscriptions to ten dollars will
enable every Stanford man and
woman to aid in the work. It is
eminently fitting that the portrait
of the great University President
should be painted by the most not
ed American artist, and the com
mittee in charge of the affair is to
be congratulated on the success
that is sure to result form their ef
forts.
