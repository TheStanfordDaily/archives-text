# NEW FOOTBALL RULES
## FEW CHANGES OF ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR 1905. Rules Committee Legislates in Instances where Point Is Not Clear but Makes No Changes. 
### 
The football rules for 1905 as
recommended by the Rules Commit
tee consisting of John C. Bell of
the University of Pennsylvania,
Walter Camp of Yale, J. B. Fine of
Princeton, Robert D. Wrenn of
Harvard, Paul J. Dashiell of the
United States Naval Academy, L.
M. Dennis of Cornell, and A. A.
Stagg of Chicago, have few changes.
The new rules bear more upon
the strict interpretation than any
thing that will affect the detail of
the play itself.
Coaching from the side-lines will
be penalized by a loss of ten yards
instead of five.
The referee will be instructed to
blow his whistle immediately when
the forward progress of the ball has
been stopped. A marked tendency
on the part of all players to fight
for the ball after its progress has
been stopped, or to steal it from a
player who has practically had it
"down," prompted the Rules Com
mittee to make this change.
A rule which seems rather ab
surd is that when a substitute is
sent in he can not run on to the
field and get into the line-up, but
must go directly to the referee and
report before he can be permit
ted to take his place. It seems
hardly possible that both the sub
stitute and the man he was to re
place could play at the same time,
and yet that is exactly what called
forth this rule.
Perhaps the most important
change is under Rule 6, relating to
a scrimmage. If the snapper-back
(center) should make a motion as
if to snap the ball, whether he
withholds it altogether or only
momentarily, the ball is in play,
and the scrimmage has begun.
Rule 6 is changed in a second
place. If any player of the side in
possession of the ball other than
the snapper-back makes an at
tempt, by a false startor otherwise,
to draw the opponents off-side, and
the ball is then snapped,it shall be
brought back and not be regarded
as in play nor the scrimmage as be
gun.

A change has been made regard
ing players who are out of bounds
at the time when the ball is putin
play. The new rule allows no
player out of bounds at the time
when the ball is putin play, ex
cept the man who is holding the
ball for a place-kick.
A note has been appended to the
rule which states that the lineman
shall notify the captains of the
time remaining to pi ay not more
than ten nor less than five minutes
before the end of each half, to the
effect that there is no objection to
the linesman giving the approxi
mate time to the captain who aßks
for it at any time during the game.
He may not, however, be asked for
this time more than three times
within the last five minutes of the
half.
