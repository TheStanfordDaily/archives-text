On Sunday, Rev. D. Charles
Gardner extended to students who
have just matriculated a hearty
welcome to the worship and fellow
ship of the Memorial Church.
In the course of his sermon the
minister said:
The Church is one of the provis
ions of our Alma Mater for your
benefit. The founding part of the
University provides that you shall
be taught the immortality of the
soul, the existence of an all wise
and beneficent Creator and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man.
In Jesus Christ we see the per
fect expression of our human na
ture, the perfect example of human
character and conduct. And so I
beg you in your university life not
to neglect the study of the life of
Jesus Christ. Not the academic
study, but that private, prayerful
study which will do so much to
guideyouas you walk the way of life.
Reason may guide you far in the
midst of knowledge, conscience will
guide you through your moral dif
ficulties, but if you live the spiritu
al life, if you would study the deep
problems of human life and human
destiny you must walk by thelight
of religious revelation. There and
there alone you will learn to know
the love of God, the power of prayer
and find the hope of immortality.
