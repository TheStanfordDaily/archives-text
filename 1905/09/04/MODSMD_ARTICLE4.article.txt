# "QUAD" BOARD NAMED
## LARGER STAFF THAN USUAL NAMED BY EDITOR BICKEL. New System Will Be Inaugurated in Collecting Material for the Annual. Book Will Be Out Early. 
### 
The board of editors for the 1907
"Quad'' has been selected and work
on the annual is now under way.
K. A. Bickel, who will edit the
book, has a new plan by which he
expects to have each department
carefully handled and avoid con
fusion among members of the
board. Last year a single member
handled each department and it
was found that this resulted in one
person having too large a field to
handle.
Under the system which Bickel
will inaugurate there will be two
or more persons assigned to each
department, and they will act as a
committee, with one member acting
as chairman who will be responsi
ble for work of that department.
The chairmen of the committees
will constitute a sort of executive
committee which will have charge
of all copy for the book under the
personal supervision of the editor.
In this way Bickel expects to
thoroughly handle each depart
ment. Frequent meetings of the
staff will be held and there may be
some changes in the departments
from time to time, but for the pres
ent the personnel of departments is
as follows, with the first-named
member in charge of the depart
ment: Athletics: A. B. Packard, C.
