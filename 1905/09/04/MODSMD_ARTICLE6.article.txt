# PRESIDENT'S PORTRAIT
## SARGENT MAKES PAINTING OF DR. JORDAN FOR ALUMNI. Will Make This a Gift to the University.-Stanford Undergraduates Expected to Aid. 
### 
At the annual meeting of the
Stanford University Alumni As
sociation held on the campus last
May, at the time of the decennial
reunion, the proposition of pre
senting to the University a portrait
of Dr. Jordan was discussed. A
committee was appointed to assume
charge of the affair consisting of F.
J. Teggart, '94, of San Francisco;
H. C. Hoover, '95, of London, Eng
land; Archie Rice, '95, of San
Francisco; J. E. Reynolds, '96, of
New York; and E. L. Brune,'ol,
of San Francisco.
Immediately after their selection
arrangements were made by these
men to carry out the plan. Dr.
Jordan consented to sit for the
portrait while in London, and
John Sargent of that city, the
world's foremost portrait artist,
was engaged to paint the picture.
Five thousand dollars was charged
by the artist, and the committee
borrowed this amount in order to
secure immediate completion of the
work.
The committee then began to
raise this amount among Stanford
people, and they are now actively
engaged in doing this. The San
Francisco members of the commit
tee are canvassing in that city, and
the chairman alone has secured
sixty signatures, promising a total
of five hundred dollars. Printed
forms explaining the project and
soliciting contributions have been
sent out all over the country to the
various Stanford clubs. To sys
tematize the work, the canvass in
each city and town has been placed
in the hands of one energetic man.
An impression has arisen that
the idea is to make the gift a
strictly alumni affair. This, how
ever, is a mistake. The proposi
tion is a Stanford affair, merely
started and managed by the alum
ni. Undergraduates and all who
have ever attended Stanford are
expected to help make the gift an
expression of widespread Stanford
spirit.
To make the portrait a thorough
ly representative gift, the alumni
committee has provided that no
one person may contribute more
than ten dollars.
As to whether Dr. Jordan sat
for his portrait this summer, as
arranged, is not definitely known
and probably will not be until the
President himself returns. Speci
fic arrangements with Sargent were
in the hands of Mr. and Mrs. H. C.
Hoover,'9s, and '98, until theirsud
den departure for Australia on a
business trip, when Mr. and Mrs.
\V. A. Prichard, '98, of London,
assumed charge. Nothing has been
heard from the latter, but a promi
nent member of the alumni com
mittee gives assurance that if for
any reason the President was un
able to spare the time for the work
this summer either the artist will

be brought to the Pacific Coast, or
arrangements will be made with
Dr. Jordan for a special trip to
London.
