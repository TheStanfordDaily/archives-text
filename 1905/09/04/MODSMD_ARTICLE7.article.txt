He will not enter athletics until
the second semester, when he will
take charge of the California track
team, of which he is captain. In
view of the fact that he is captain
of the track team, Snedigar feels
that he must deny himself football
in order that he may be in the best
possible condition next spring.
The departure of Snedigar from
football leaves Sperry, Kerr, Mead,
'fuller, and Boynton as the princi
pal aspirants for positions in Cali
ornia'a back field.
