## "DAD" MOULTON REFUSES OFFERS FROM THE EAST. Yale and Columbia Wish Stanford's Trainer to Condition Their Athletes.â€”Track Prospects Good. 
### 
Stanford's popular trainer, "Dad"
Moulton, is in receipt of three let
ters containing offers of positions
as trainer at Eastern universities.
Two of these offers came from Yale.
The first was received early in the
summer and the last one, offering
considerable advance over the first,
but two weeks ago. The third of
fer, which comes from Columbia,
arrived yesterday.
Although the acceptance of any
of these offers would mean an ad
vance in salary, the Cardinal
trainer declares that he is perfect
ly satisfied with his present posi
tion and does not intend to leave.
The reputation which Moulton
has made by his splendid condi
tioning of Stanford athletes is
known at all large universities, and

these offers indicate the high regard
in which his abilities as a trainer
are held.
Although the California athletes
are at present out for fall training,
work upon the track will not begin
here for two or three weeks, and
Trainer Moulton wishes to impress
upon all the great importance of
getting their University work well
started before the beginning of fall
training.
The track meet does not come
until the next semester, but judg
ing from the material now in col
lege and that which it is known
will return at Christmas the pros
pect for a successful year in this
branch of college sport is very
bright.
J. O. Miller, '08, and H. L. Hor
ton, '08, the Cardinal's largest
point winners last year, will both
be in college. In addition many
of those who took places in the last
intercollegiate meet are here and
eligible to compete again. There
is also a wealth of green material
in college, from which there are

great possibilities. Yery little is
known about the track abilities of
the class of 1909, and until fall
training begins no definite line
upon the men can be obtained.
