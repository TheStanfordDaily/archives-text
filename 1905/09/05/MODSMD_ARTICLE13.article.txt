# BUILDING ON LASUEN STREET.
## Fraternity House and Professor's Home in Course of Construction. 
### 
Work has commenced on laying
the foundations of two new build
ings on Lasuen street, both to be
completed before January Ist.
The Kappa Alpha fraternity has
let a contract to Thompson of Palo
Alto to erect a three-story dwelling
on the we*t side of Lasuen street
between tbe houses occupied by
Kappa Sigma and Delta Kappa
Epsilon. Tbe approximate cost
will be ten thousand dollars. The
bouse will contain seventeen rooms,
furnishing accommodations for
about twenty-four men. The plans
were drawn by C. E. Hodges, the
University architect. The style of
this building will be old English
half-timbered stucco work.
The erection of the Kappa Alpha
house marks the completion of the
row of houses on that street as it
now stands. The erection of a
house by Professor W. F. Durand,
of the Mechanical Engineering
department, on the hill back of tbe
Cookeey residence, is the first step
taken towards building on tbe ex
tension of Lasuen street. Professor
Durand's new residence will be a
two-story building. Tbe plans
were drawn by Professor A. B.
Clark, of the Stanford Art depart
ment, and the contract has been
let to a Palo Alto contractor.
