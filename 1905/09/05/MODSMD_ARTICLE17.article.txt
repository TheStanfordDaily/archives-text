# Bishop's Players, at the Majestic.
## 
### 
This week James Neill and
Edytlie Chapman Neill will appear
at the Majestic Theater, San Fran
cisco, in a new and powerful drama
entitled "The Conflict," written by
Maurice V. Samuels, well known
in literary circles as the author of
''The Florentines." Although
founded on the central conception
of Honore de Balzac's masterpiece
novel La Peau de Chagrin, gener
ally known in this country as "The
Magic Skin," this intense and vir
ile drama is a study in regener
ation rather than degeneration, as
is the case of de Balzac's famous
novel. "The Conflict" stands in a
class by itself, being totally unlike
any play presented in America.
The scenes are laid in France at
the present time, and are of absorb
ing interest, along remarkably new
and original lines. Mr. and Mrs.
Neill will be supported in this play
by an exceptionally strong cast,
including all of Bishop's favorites,
and the production from a scenic
and mechanical standpoint will be
one of the best ever seen on this
Coast.
