# ACCEPTS COMMISSION
## ALVIN SEALE OF ZOOLOGY DEPARTMENT ENGAGED BY HAWAII Will Transplant Species of Fish From United States to Destroy Mosquitoes Which Are Infesting Hawaiian Islands. 
### 
Alvin Seale, a member of the
Zoology department, was recently
awarded an important commis
sion from the Hawaiian govern
ment in regard to exterminating
mosquitoes, which are becoming a
serious nuisance in that country.
Seale has completed his work in
the University, and will in all prob
ability receive his degree at the
meeting of the committee next Fri
day.
The work to which he has been
commissioned is being regarded
with a great deal of interest and
speculation from a scientific point
of view. Hawaii is infested with
foreign mosquitoes, and there being
no natural means in the island of
destroying them, other steps are
necessary.
The government decided to im
port a species of fish known as the
Poeciliidae, which multiply rap
idly, from the southern states of
this country, where they live in
mud hole# and bayous, the breed
ing place of mosquitoes. In their
native waters these fishes are a mo
squito-destroying agency, and for
this reason the Hawaiian govern
ment has undertaken their impor
tation to the island waters and
streams.
This is in the nature of an ex
periment, and the method of trans
portation and the behavior of the
fishes after their destination is
reached are matters which are in
teresting the zoologists of the coun
try. Seale is at present in Louis
iana experimenting with the fishes
in order to determine the most feas
ible means of their transportation.
As soon as a decision is reached, he
will sail with a cargo of the Poeci
liidae for the islands, and trans
plant them in the fresh water
streams and bodies there.
Whether or not the fishes will
continue to destroy mosquitoes
after being transplanted in foreign
waters remains to be seen. The
success of the project hangs on this
point, and throughout his work

Seale will be watched with interest
by the scientific world.
While away from the University,
Seale has been the curator of the
Bishop Museum of Honolulu, and
in that position traveled for three
years throughout the South Seas
collecting for the museum. Last
year he worked with Dr. Jordan in
connection with the Samoan fishes.
