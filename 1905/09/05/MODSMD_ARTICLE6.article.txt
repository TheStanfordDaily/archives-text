# Will Elect Yell Leader.
## 
### 
At the regular meeting of the
Executive Committee to he held to
morrow evening the matter of ap
pointing yell leaders for the com
ing year will be definitely decided.
M. H. Thorpe, ex-'O5, who acted in
the capacity of yell leader last year,
has not returned to college, and it
will be necessary to find a successor
among half a dozen candidates
who have so far volunteered their
services, and such others who
signify their willingness to fill the
position to E. A. Cunha, president
of the student body, by to-morrow
night.
It has been suggested that the

two yell leaders shall divide the re
sponsibility of the position equally
this year, instead of one acting as
an assistant to the head leader; but
as yet this has not been definitely
decided upon.
