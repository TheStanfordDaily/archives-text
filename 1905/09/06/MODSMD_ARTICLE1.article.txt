# BOAT CLUB MEETING
## OARSMEN WILL GIVE FARCE TO REMOVE DEBT. Pape, Weil-Known Oarsman, Seeks Position as Coach.â€”Outlook Bright for Next Year. 
### 
At a meeting of the Boat Club
held last evening at 7:30 it was
definitely decided to give a farce
for the purpose of removing the
large deficit. The play will be some
modern comedy and will be given
before the football game with the
University of California.
The entire charge of the affairs
of the Boat Club during the present
semester, including full manage
ment of the farce, was intrusted to
an executive commitee, which con
sists of the following members: N.
P. Bryan, '07, chairman, D. R.
Gardner, '07, F. Zimmerman, '07,
F. W. Turner, '08, and R. H.
Baker, '08. This committee will
meet to-night to consider plans for
the play.
When the class of '05 left college
last May, it was found that a sur
plus of $87 remained in the treas
ury. This sum the class turned
over to the Boat Club. At the
meeting last night it was voted
that a resolution of thanks to the
class of '05 be drawn up and pub
lished.
The report of the finance com
mittee shows that at present the
club has approximately a debt of
$700.
The question of fall training was
discussed at length and it was fin
ally decided that it will not be pos
sible to indulge in any systematic
training upon the water. The men,
however, intend to train on the
rowing-machines, and to put them
selves in the best possible con
dition for the hard work of next
semester.
President Henley is in receipt of
a letter from A. H. Pape, the present
Pacific Coast champion in single
skulls. Mr. Pape desires a position
as coach of the Stanford crews.
This question of coach, however,
the club does not intend to consider
this semester.
The outlook for boating for the
coming year, in spite of the difficul
ties in the finances of the club, is
very bright. Although Stanford
lost the Varsity race in the last re
gatta, it must be taken into account
that the men trained under great
difficulties, and the crew which
represented California was the best
which ever rowed a shell upon the
Pacific Coast.
In the spring Stanford will have
at least three and perhaps four
veterans of last year's Varsity
crew in college and eligible to com
pete, while three of California's
crew have graduated.
The Stanford Freshmen in the
Seattle regatta defeated both Cali
fornia and Washington in fast
time, and these oarsmen will be a
valuable addition to the Varsity
material for the next year.
In a few days the Freshmen who
are taking gymnasium work and
who desire to go out for the Fresh
man crew in the spring will be as

signed to special work upon the
rowing-machines. The Boat Club
wishes to impress upon all Fresh
men who desire to row next spring
the necessity of training this fall.
