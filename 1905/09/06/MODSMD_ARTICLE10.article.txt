# "SEQUOIA" OUT MONDAY.
## First Issue of the Monthly Magazine Contains Interesting Material. 
### 
The first number of the Sequoia
will be placed on sale on the quad
and at the Bookstore Monday
morning, Sept. 11th. A new cover
design drawn by J. K. Bonnell will
make its appearance this issue. It
is a simple architectural drawing
representing in an impressionistic
manner the characteristics of the
quadrangle and the entrance
arches of the University. The
cover is printed in black and red
on the same shade of gray used
last year.
Internally the editors have made
no material changes. The editori
al department has been moved for
ward and now occupies the second
and third pages of the reading sec
tion. No definite plan as to the
future policy of the magazine is ex
pressed in the editorials, but a vig
orous interest in college affairs is
suggested.
The leading feature of the num
ber is an article by Professor Col
bert Searles under the caption
"Athletes and Hero-Worship," in
which is thoroughly discussed the
false regard in which students hold
the athletic man of the University.
The article also points out the lack
of a sense of responsibility for their
college on the part of the athletes
themselves. Altogether it isßtrong
ly written and of great interest to
college readers.
The number has several good
short stories by well-known stu
dent contributors, among whom
are Miss E. R. Mirrielees, Miss Jen
net Johnson, and J. E. Cushing.
Mies Johnson's story, entitled
"Chispah," is the biography of a
cow-pony told in a most interesting
manner. Miss Mirrielees, the for
mer editor of the Sequoia, contrib
utes an int®nsely dramatic story en
titled "The Courage of Cowards."
L. S. Levy, a new writer of fiction,
makes his first appearance in the
magazine with a clev«r sketch of
one man's speculation in mining
stocks and his consequent fate.
The verse department is not as
strong as usual. The opening poem,
"Arcadia," by YV. F. Herron, is
the best contribution of this kind
in the issue. The number is de
void of illustrations, but the man
agement promises something in
this line later. Miss Stella F.

Wynne, G. G. Altnow and I). H.
Clift have been promoted from the
assistant list to the associate staff,
and the names of Miss Anna G.
Hall, M. M. Stearns and W. F.
Herron appear for the first time as
assistant editors.
