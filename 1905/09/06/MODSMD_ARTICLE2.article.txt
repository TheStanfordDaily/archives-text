# FIRST ASSEMBLY WELL ATTENDED
## Dr. Branner and Student Body President Addressed a Crowded Meeting in Assembly Hall This Morning. 
### 
The opening University Assem
bly of the year took place this
morning in Assembly Hull, and
was one of the largest and best at
tended in the history of the Univer
sity, giving evidence of the year's
record-breaking enrollment.
The speakers who addressed the
meeting were Dr. J. C. Branner,
Acting-President of the University,
and President E. A. Cunha, of the
student body. Dr. Branner made
the customary address of welcome
to the Freshmen, at the same time
touching upon many subjects of
interest to the rest of the under
graduates. He also read a letter
from Dr. Jordan stating that the
latter would be at the University
by the 10th or 11th of the present
month. President Cunha's address
was taken up with a brief outline
of the problems before the student
body at the present time, and a
discussion of the relation of the in
dividual student to the student
body as a whole, ending with a
notable tribute to the memory of
Mrs. Stanford, and to the influence
which her personality exerted in
moulding the Stanford spirit. He
said in part:
"This is to be an exceptional
year at Stanford. The usual prob
lems that face the student body are
to be confronted. As usual every
effort must be exerted to uphold
our athletic prestige against Cali
fornia. Each student must do his
part, each individual must feel it
a duty to do his share of work
in some form of University activity;
for it is only when every student
in the University is living up to
this ideal that the ideal rela
tion of the individual student to
the student body aB a whole shall
be realized.
"But aside from these minor prob
lems there is a new and greater one
that faces us this year. This is the
first year that the influence of Mrs.
Stanford shall be missing. It has
become the duty of those of us who
have felt this influence to hand it
down to the new students who are
entering now, and through them to
the classes of the future. Large
numbers of people have been weld
ed together by following the ideals
of one great hero, and even so Stan
ford students of all classes should
be welded together by the memory
of the 'mother of the University.' "
Besides the usual words of ad
vice to the students at the outset of
the year, Dr. Branner sounded a
warning note against several evil
tendencies that are beginning to
appear in college life. Chief among
these he decried unnecessary ex
travagance on the part of students.
Concerning this point Dr. Branner
said:

"I want to lay some stress upon
the habit of spending money as
practiced nowadays in college.
Fortunately, for many of you the
problem of expenses is already
solved, and you are to be congratu
lated; but others of you are so un
fortunate as to be more fortunate.
You have only to write to indul
gent parents for more money to
pay for books, or for fees, or for a
board bill, and it comes. This
money is spent in some cases as if
you were the sons and daughters
not of frugal American parents, but
of nabobs and princes. And not
only is this money poured out for
extravagant dress, expensive fur
niture, super-abundant livery rigs,
spreads, dances, card parties and
all the accompaniments of college
high-life, but bills are run up with
liverymen and tradesmen without
due regard to when and how they
are to be paid. But if those of you
who are disposed to be over-free
will look about you among your
fellow students, I am confident that
you will see reasons enough to rec
oncile you to leading a simpler sort
of life.
"To the fraternity and sorority
people generally I beg to offer a
word of kindly meant advice in
this connection. The lives that
many of you are leading are, in
my opinion, altogether too strenu
ous. Such devotion to pleasure
seeking is not in keeping with the
spirit or purposes of university ed
ucation in this country, and it is
not good for you either as organi
zations or individuals. Fraternity
life has come to be vastly more ex
pensive than is either necessary or
reasonable, and this expensiveness
is kept up not by the necessary re
quirements of the organizations,
but by childish rivalries in display.
And in some instances, while you
are here spending enough money
to support an ordinary family,
back there at home are father and
mother working early and late,
saving and denying themselves in
order to pay for these indulgences
of yours.
"I do not mean to imply that
extravagance is confined to the
fraternities and sororities — not by
any manner of means. If I were
at all disposed to think so I should
only have to look toward college
athletics to be compelled to enlarge
my views on the subject. And I
would also have it distinctly under
stood that I do not believe that ex
travagance is especially characteris
tic of student life in this univer
sity. But I do mean to say that
it is the business of our students
and our faculty to deal with it so
far as it is practiced on our cam
pus."

latter would be at the University
by the 10th or 11th of the present
month. President Cunha's address
was taken up with a brief outline
of the problems before the student
body at the present time, and a
discussion of the relation of the in
dividual student to the student
body as a whole, ending with a
notable tribute to the memory of
Mrs. Stanford, and to the influence
which her personality exerted in
moulding the Stanford spirit. He
said in part:
"This is to be an exceptional
year at Stanford. The usual prob
lems that face the student body are
to be confronted. As usual every
effort must be exerted to uphold
our athletic prestige against Cali
fornia. Each student must do his
part, each individual must feel it
a duty to do his share of work
in some form of University activity;
for it is only when every student
in the University is living up to
this ideal that the ideal rela
tion of the individual student to
the student body aB a whole shall
be realized.
"But aside from these minor prob
lems there is a new and greater one
that faces us this year. This is the
first year that the influence of Mrs.
Stanford shall be missing. It has
become the duty of those of us who
have felt this influence to hand it
down to the new students who are
entering now, and through them to
the classes of the future. Large
numbers of people have been weld
ed together by following the ideals
of one great hero, and even so Stan
ford students of all classes should
be welded together by the memory
of the 'mother of the University.' "
Besides the usual words of ad
vice to the students at the outset of
the year, Dr. Branner sounded a
warning note against several evil
tendencies that are beginning to
appear in college life. Chief among
these he decried unnecessary ex
travagance on the part of students.
Concerning this point Dr. Branner
said:

"I want to lay some stress upon
the habit of spending money as
practiced nowadays in college.
Fortunately, for many of you the
problem of expenses is already
solved, and you are to be congratu
lated; but others of you are so un
fortunate as to be more fortunate.
You have only to write to indul
gent parents for more money to
pay for books, or for fees, or for a
board bill, and it comes. This
money is spent in some cases as if
you were the sons and daughters
not of frugal American parents, but
of nabobs and princes. And not
only is this money poured out for
extravagant dress, expensive fur
niture, super-abundant livery rigs,
spreads, dances, card parties and
all the accompaniments of college
high-life, but bills are run up with
liverymen and tradesmen without
due regard to when and how they
are to be paid. But if those of you
who are disposed to be over-free
will look about you among your
fellow students, I am confident that
you will see reasons enough to rec
oncile you to leading a simpler sort
of life.
"To the fraternity and sorority
people generally I beg to offer a
word of kindly meant advice in
this connection. The lives that
many of you are leading are, in
my opinion, altogether too strenu
ous. Such devotion to pleasure
seeking is not in keeping with the
spirit or purposes of university ed
ucation in this country, and it is
not good for you either as organi
zations or individuals. Fraternity
life has come to be vastly more ex
pensive than is either necessary or
reasonable, and this expensiveness
is kept up not by the necessary re
quirements of the organizations,
but by childish rivalries in display.
And in some instances, while you
are here spending enough money
to support an ordinary family,
back there at home are father and
mother working early and late,
saving and denying themselves in
order to pay for these indulgences
of yours.
"I do not mean to imply that
extravagance is confined to the
fraternities and sororities — not by
any manner of means. If I were
at all disposed to think so I should
only have to look toward college
athletics to be compelled to enlarge
my views on the subject. And I
would also have it distinctly under
stood that I do not believe that ex
travagance is especially characteris
tic of student life in this univer
sity. But I do mean to say that
it is the business of our students
and our faculty to deal with it so
far as it is practiced on our cam
pus."
The opening University Assem
bly of the year took place this
morning in Assembly Hull, and
was one of the largest and best at
tended in the history of the Univer
sity, giving evidence of the year's
record-breaking enrollment.
The speakers who addressed the
meeting were Dr. J. C. Branner,
Acting-President of the University,
and President E. A. Cunha, of the
student body. Dr. Branner made
the customary address of welcome
to the Freshmen, at the same time
touching upon many subjects of
interest to the rest of the under
graduates. He also read a letter
from Dr. Jordan stating that the
latter would be at the University
by the 10th or 11th of the present
month. President Cunha's address
