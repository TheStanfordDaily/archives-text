# REQUIRE FOUR YEARS
## CREDITS FROM SHORT-COURSE SCHOOLS TO BE REJECTED. Registrar Will Refuse All Applications from Three-Year Schools. Takes Effect Next September. 
### 
Beginning with September, 1906,
all applications for admission to
the University without examina
tion which come from high
schools giving only a three-year
course will be denied. Formerly
the Registrar has accepted the
recommendations of three-year
high schools on the same basis as
those offering the full four-year
course.
An applicant may be acceptably
recommended for the full fifteen
credits, but unless he has a diploma
showing that a four-year high
school course or its full equivalent
has been completed, he will have to
take the usual entrance examina
tions.
When Stanford University first
opened fourteen years ago, most of
the high schools in California of
fered only a three-year course; but
this has been gradually changed,
and to-day there are not more than
six high schools in the itate which
follow the old order.
In parts of Oregon and Nevada
all of the high schools continue to
give the shorter course; and even
in the city of Reno, the change from
three to four years was made only
within the past six months. For
tunately Stanford draws few of her
entrants from these districts, and
the effects of the new rule will not
be as far-sweeping as might be
thought.
