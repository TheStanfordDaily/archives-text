Trustees must soon give consider
ation to the necessity of erecting a
second dormitory for the accommo
dation of the men students of the
University: of the needs of the
women students we are not in
formed. It is a remarkable condi
tion when practically every room
in Encina Hall is reserved several
weeks before the opening of college,
with enough further applications,
it is understood, almost to fill the
dormitory over again. It is good,
of course, to have the hall filled;
but the general result of the pres
ent conditions cannot but be injur
ious to the student life. The men
who are occupying rooms in the
hall are mostly old students. It is
said that at the opening of the se
mester there were but thirty-eight
Freshmen in the dormitory, and
the difficulty the Sophomores ex
perience in finding material for
their pranks would seem to prove
this true. The remaining five hun
dred Freshmen are scattered to the
four corners of the campus, of Palo
Alto, of College Terrace, of every
near-by settlement. Actual cam
pus accommodations, outside of
Encina Hall and the fraternities,
are not great, and it is obvious,
therefore, that the majority of the
first-year men are living away from
our own grounds.
Hall life is very essential to the
Freshman. It is here that he best
comes to know his classmates; to
have brushed from him the cruder
ideas of the preparatory school. It
is here that he must meet all the
small troubles that are the lot of
the Freshman, and overcome them,
—a task that is a valuable training.
It is here that he will most surely
imbibe the first principles of the
Stanford spirit.
But with thirty-eight Freshmen
as the largest aggregation in any
one place, what has been the re
sult? Apathy, lack of spirit, criti
cism. There has been no demon
stration by the Freshmen of the
stuff of which they are made. Nor
s there other sign of class spirit
and pride. It is the ideal of a

I strong Freshman class that it
should keep the Sophomores hust
ling to hold it down, but this has
bv no means been true this year.
This is not a reflection upon the
class of 1909. The Freshmen are
simply the victimsof theconditions
surrounding them. Scattered every
where, they are without organiza
tion, and consequently lack vim
and vigor.
Year by year we are growing
greater. We are drawing students
from all over the world, and no
small factor in bringing men to
this young university in the quiet
of the Santa Clara valley has been
the charm of its distinct "college
life." When, however, the Univer
sity can no longer offer the ac
commodations that lie at the foun
dation of that college life, what is
going to be the result? And what is
the remedy to be —the cure that
will insure the strong and healthy
growth of the vigorous sentiments
that we call the Stanford spirit?
