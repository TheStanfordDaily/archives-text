# YELL LEADER CHOSEN
## E.A. CUNHA, '06, ELECTED BY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. Arrangements Made for a Football Show and Trip by the Musical Clubs. 
### 
At the first regular meeting of
the Executive Committee last eve
ning E. A. Cunha, '06, was chosen
yell leader for the ensuing year.
At the end of a try-out of two
weeks, which will be in charge of
Cunha, two assistants will be chosen
by the Executive Committee.
Cunha held the position of assis
tant yell leader last year and is
prominent in various other student
activities.
It was at first planned to have
three leaders on an equal basis, but
it was later decided by the commit
tee to have a try-out for the two
vacant assistantsbips. Thus far
three candidates have signified
their intention of trying-out. They
are R. Collom, '06, A. L. Kearne,
'07, and R. S. Kellogg, '07.
In pursuance of a ruling passed
by the Executive Committee last
semester for the appointment of an
official gate-keeper, C. R. Crider,
'07, was elected to the position.
The first active steps toward the
production of an original football
show at Stanford this year were
taken by the appointment of a
committee of three, to take charge
of a competitive contest for a prize
of fifty dollars. This committee,
consisting of B. S. Allen, '06, H. E.
Savage, '06, and J. C. McFarland,
'07, meets to-night to appoint judges
and arrange the supervision of
the contest. In past years it has
been the custom of the Stanford
students attending the intercolle
giate football game to gather at a
San Francisco theatre, rented on
the night after the game. This
year, however, an original farce
will be presented, possibly in the
open air. Further details as to
the conditions of the contest will
be given later.
The student body resolutions on
the death of Mrs. Stanford were
placed in the hands of the Execu
tive Committee, which ordered that
they be engrossad on parchment
and placed in the Library. C. A.
Beardsley, '06, was made custodian
of the resolutions, which will be
placed in the trophy-room of the
new Gymnasium when the building
is ready for occupancy. E. A. Cun
ha, '06, was delegated to present a
copy of the expression of sympathy
to Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop.
A copy will also be presented to
Dr. Jordan upon his return to the
University.
After transacting the routine bus
iness the Executive Committee
voted to allow R. VV. Barrett, '04,
Treasurer of the Associated Stu
dents, his expenses for the summer.
He was also authorized to permit
the Combined Musical Clubs to
take a trip during the holidays.
Each man taking the trip will be
required to deposit twenty dollars
as a partial guarantee of the finan
cial success of the undertaking.
The clubs will probably tour the

southern part of the state this win
ter, since they covered northern
California and Oregon on the last
trip two years ago.
