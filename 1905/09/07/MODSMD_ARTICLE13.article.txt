THURSDAY - SEPTEMBER 7, 1905

Every man in college should at
tend the football rally to-morrow
night. The season must he started
with a spirit that will control both
squad and bleachers, and. without
which a successful year is impossi
ble.
After the speeches and singing
the men will sign up who are to
compose the squad of 1905. Stan
ford has an up-hill tight this year,
and it is essential that every man
whose physical condition and time
allow him to play the game should
enroll. Turn out and be a second
or third team man, if you are not
of first team caliber, for this is the
way that first team men of the fu
ture are made. The man whose
presence on the field would help
toward the development of a suc
cessful eleven, and who has no
valid excuse for not turning out,
should realize that it is his duty
to sign up to-morrow night.
