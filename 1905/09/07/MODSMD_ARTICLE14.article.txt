# FIRST ISSUE OF "CHAPARRAL."
## Freshman Number Will Make Its Appearance on Monday Morning. 
### 
The Freshman number of the
Chaparral will be placed on sale
on the quadrangle next Monday
morning at ten o'clock. This marks
the appearance of the first issue
under the editorship of Morris Op
penheim, '05. There will be twenty
pages of reading matter and illus
trations.
Editorially Chappie's policy for
the coming year will be to distrib
ute his knocks harder and more
impartially than ever before. In
Monday's issue, beside the custom
ary greeting, Chappie will say some
very pointed things about the tac
tics of Knibbs, California's new
coach. In his third "Now That"
there are a few remarks about the
proposed plan for a distinctive
Freshman emblem.
Among the art features is a very
humorous cartoon by W.R. Daven
port, ex-'O2, a full-page study by
R. E. Snodgrass, '01, and an ar
tistic head by Miss Emma Keith.
Other drawings and cartoons are
by J. J. Sheehy, '06, and M. Op
pen heim, '05.
The literary features of the issue
will be equally good. I). H. Clift,
'07, contributes the front-page poem
and also a clever parody on the

numerous rules now in force in
Encina Hall. There is also a pro
gram of regulations for Freshman
football players, by E. J. Hadley,
'08. The actual experiences of a
Stanford man as a hotel clerk are
humorously related by C. S.
Thompson, ex-'O5. Some clever
verse and prose by Julian Josephson,
'05, make√ü up the rest of the issue.
