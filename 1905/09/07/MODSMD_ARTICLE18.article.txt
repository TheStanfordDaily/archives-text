# MANY SPECIMENS COLLECTED
## Professor Smith Gathered Material During the Summer throughout the Northwest. 
### 
Professor James P. Smith of the
Department of Mining and Geology
has returned to the University
from a trip through the North west,
where he spent a portion of the
summer in scientific investigation
connected with monographs which
are to be published by the United
States Geological Survey. These
monographs deal with shell-fish
fossils and when completed will
contain all the genera of the West.
The first monograph is to appear
in the fall and will contain but one
species of each of the seventy-odd
genera. The second monograph,
which the professor is now working
on, will not appear for several
years, and when finished will be
complete in every detail. The
work this summer was in connec
tion with this second publication.
After leaving the University two
weeks were spent in the western
Humboldt Range in Nevada. Two
more weeks were spent in the Wa
satch Range in southeastern Idaho.
Here Professor Smith was assisted
by Dale Slusher, '07, of the Geology
department. Shasta county in
northern California was next vis
ited, and here E. D. Gleim, '06,
president of the Geological Society,
was Professor Smith's assistant.
Professor Smith has been over
this field three times, and in his
last investigation found many new
and valuable specimens. The new
discoveries are principally Triassic
Ammonites, and will require sever
al years of investigation before
their exact identity is ascertained.
