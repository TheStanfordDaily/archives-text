# EXPERIMENTS WITH RUBBER.
## Dr. Olsson-Seffer Starts Important Work on Rubber Trees. 
### 
Dr. P. H. Olsson-Seffer of the
Department of Systematic Botany
spent the summer in Central
America engaged in botanical ex
periments in the interests of the La
Zacualpa Rubber Plantation Com
pany. His work was devoted not
only to experiments in selection
and hybridization of the rubber
trees, but also to the chemical and
physical qualities of the soil in
which the trees are grown, with a
view of devising some means of
fertilization whereby the output of
rubber may be materially increased
over what it has been in the past.
The La Zacualpa Company has
felt the need of employing some
such methods owing to the increas
ing demand for rubber goods.
From a scientific standpoint the
idea of increasing the supply of
castolloa by scientific methods of
fertilization has been considered
practical. The methods of fertili
zation employed by Luther Bur
bank in developing other vegetable
forms with marked success are
similar to those adopted by Dr.
Olsson-Seffer. The experiments will
be continued under scientific guid
ance for ten years or more.
