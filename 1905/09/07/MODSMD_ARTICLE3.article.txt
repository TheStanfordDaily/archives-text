# GOLF PETITION APPROVED.
## Club Will Soon Be Organized and a Course Laid Out. 
### 
Last semester Professor Fair
clough and several other members
of the faculty who are interested in
golf referred a petition, signed by
about one hundred students, re
questing the regranting of the golf
links by the Board of Trustees.
The Trustees passed favorably upon
the petition and recommended its
approval by the Business Office.
The Business Office has not settled
the matter definitely, but rent will
be required for the land used.
Within a short time links will
probably be chosen and the Golf
Club will be reorganized.
The club has not existed for
about two years, when the links
were located in the tract of land
just south of Mr. C. G. Lathrop'B
residence, and consisted of a nine
hole course. The new links will
also comprise a nine-hole course,
but a different tract of land will
probably be apportioned. It is
thought that about forty acres of
land will be required.
