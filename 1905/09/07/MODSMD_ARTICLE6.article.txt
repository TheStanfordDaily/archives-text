# DEBATING PRELIMINARIES.
## Reorganization of Literary Societies Revives Interest in Forensic Work.

An innovation in the conduct of
University debating work will prob
ably be introduced this year, when
the annual debate between the
Freshmen and Sophomores will be
held during the first semester of
the college year. Formerly the un
der-class debate has always been
held early in the second semester,
although the try-outs were held be
fore the holidays. Necessarily
the members of the under-class
teams were debarred from engaging
in the Carnot and frequently from
the intercollegiate try-outs, because
of the conflict of dates with the
interclass contest.
To remove this difficulty and
permit the under-classmen to try
for the Varsity teams, the execu
tive committee of the Intersocietv
Debating League will hold a meet
ing sometime next week, and set
early dates for the holding of the
class try-outs and of the interclass
debate itself.
This shifting of dates will prob
ably result in another change.
Each year a Freshman debating
society has been organized to assist
the new class in developing the
material for their team. But if the
debate is held this year as early as
now planned, the organization of
such a society will be unnecessary.
