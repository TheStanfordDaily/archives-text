# WILL HOLD TRY-OUTS
## MUSICAL CLUBS ACTIVE PREPARING FOR THE SEASON. Plans Are Being Made for a Trip Through Southern Part of State During Christmas Vacation. 
### 
The manager and leaders of the
Mandolin and Glee Clubs are act
ively making preparations for the
coming season, and all indications
point to a most successful year.
The try-out for the Glee Club will
be held a week from Friday, and
the candidates for the Mandolin
Club will soon be given a chance to
show their ability. It has been
decided that the clubs will take a
trip through the southern part of
the state during the Christmas va
cation, and Manager Barrett is
making arrangements for this pur
pose.
This year it iB the idea of the
management to make all of the
dates by mail as soon as possible
and in this way give the advance
men more time to devote to adver
tising. Manager Barrett has writ
ten to all towns and cities in the
southern part of the Btate and ex
pects to hear from them in a few
days. It is probable that the clubs
will go south through the San Joa
quin valley and continue as far as
San Diego and then return by way
of the coast. The following is a
list of towns at which it is practi
cally certain that the clubs will
give entertainments on the trip:
San Francisco, San Jose, Stockton,
Merced, Fresno, Bakersfield, Han
ford, Riverside, Redlands, Los An
geles, Pasadena, San Diego and
Santa Barbara.
It is expected that the Glee Club
try-out which is to take place a
week from Friday night will be at
tended by an unusually large num
ber of applicants. Very few of the
old men on the club have returned
to college this year, and it is in
tended to increase the size of the
organization over that of former
years. It is the general under
standing that old members of the
club will not have to take part in
the preliminary try-out, but this is
only true of those men who were
on the club when it disbanded at
the end of last semester.
The try-out for the Mandolin
Club will be held under the leader
ship of F. R. Lanagan, '08, and
both clubs will then begin regular
practice in preparation for the
tour of the southern part of the
state.
