It now seems probable that this
year we are to escape the painful
ceremony of electing a "fake"
Freshman president. This is one
of the few traditions handed down
to lie l>y piece ling generations of
which we cannot be proud. It. has
been a pitiful sight each year to
see the college career of some man
—and even his whole life —blasted
by those who are his fellow stu
dents. It is no excuse for the cere
mony that a man should not be so
easily deceived. Most first-year
students are but boys new from
home and entirely unversed in the
ways of the college world. There
are a great many Freshmen that
might be seized upon at a "fake"
election and made to believe for a
brief while that the proceedings
were legitimate. It is probably
true, too, that even the most unso
phisticated Freshman realizes after
the first few minutes that he is
merely being made the butt of a
rough joke. But what is he to do,
unless he fight? To the Fresh
man's excited imagination the
whole University is howling around
him, and, intimidated and shamed,
he is most likely to submit to the
end. His subsequent college ca
reer is full of humiliation and his
after-life not free of bitter mem
ories.
The name of Stanford should
mean always sympathy and pro
tection. Between the oldest alumni
and the youngest undergraduate
there should be that bond of fel
lowship that builds up character,
and does not tear it down. The
men who make up the Stanford
faculty do their utmost to send out
men to do the world's work with
the best possible equipment, and
we ourselves should see to it that
no fellow-student goes out bearing
a brand. Let us have no more
"fake" elections of Freshman presi
dents: the practice is unworthy of
Stanford men.
