# BAND IS REORGANIZED.
## Officers Elected and New Members Enrolled at First Meeting of the Year. 
### 
At the first meeting of the Uni
versity band, held last night, offi
cers for the year were elected and
plans of the organization outlined.
L. W. Cutler, '06, will lead the
hand, and G. Knupp, '07, will
serve as secretary-treasurer and
business manager. Both men have
played in the band for the past
two years, and are well known in
college activities.
During the semester band prac
tice will be held twice each week,
on Monday and Thursday nights.
A new ruling, made last evening
and which is expected to increase
greatly the efficiency of the band,
is to the effect that each member
will be required to make a deposit
with the treasurer, from which a
fine will he deducted for each ab
sence from practice. A committee
of three was appointed to deter
mine the tine and paBS upon the
validity of excuses for absence.
About thirty men turned out for
the first practice last night. Of
these fifteen have played in the
band before. Last year the band
had a membership of twenty-five,
hut it is probable that a few more
than this number will be given
places at the conclusion of the try
out. The personnel of the band
will be announced at a later date.
Clarionet players are wanted par
ticularly, but men who play any
horn should see L. W. Cutler as
soon as possible regarding member
ship.
The band will appear at all the
football games this fall, and at the
close of .the season it is probable
that the promenade concerts on the
quad will be given. The red uni
forms which were purchased last
year will be worn again this sea-
The next practice will he held
Monday night at 7:15.
