The register at Roble Hall shows
a larger number of names this year
than ever before. Although only
designed to accommodate one hun
dred students, the number of those
living in the hall has reached 106,
as against 102 last year at this
time. There are 48 Freshmen regis
tered as against 43 in 1904, and
the report of the matron shows that
as many have been turned away as
have been accommodated. The wait
ing - list, with applications for
rooms in January, or as soon as
vacancies occur, now contains
forty-eight names. Despite the in
crease in the number of roomers
and applications, only one new
room has been added, so that in
many cases the conveniences are
greatly strained.
