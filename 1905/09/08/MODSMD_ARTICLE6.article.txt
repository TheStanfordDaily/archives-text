# LATHROP MAKES GIFT
## TWO MARBLE STATUES FOR FRONT OF NEW GYMNASIUM. Copies of Famous Gladiators by Canova Purchased by Treasurer of the University. 
### 
Two valuable marble statues, the
gift of Charles G. Lathrop, arrived
at the University yesterday, and
have been placed on the two lower
platforms close to the steps of the
new Gymnasium. The figures are
of Italian marble, and are exact
copies of Antonio Canova's gladia
tors, "The Pugilist," and"The
Wrestler," which are two of the
most celebrated works of art in the
Vatican at Rome. These copies
are the work of Bartholdi, one of
the most famous of modern Italian
sculptors.
Mrs. Stanford when in Venice
greatly admired these copies, and
shortly before her departure for
Honolulu expressed her intention
of purchasing them for the Gym
nasium.
"The Pugilist," which occupies
the east platform of the Gymna
sium, represents a gladiator defend
ing himself with his left arm from
the blow of his opponent. "The
Wrestler," standing opposite, shows
an athlete awaiting the attack of
his adversary.
These statues rank among Ca
nova's best works of art, which in
clude "Cupid and Psyche," of the
Louvre, and"The Group of Theseus
and the Centaur," in a specially
designed temple at Vienna.
