ing on the Encina courts with a
try-out to select the representatives
of the Freshman Class in the sin
gles. This will he followed by the
Sophomore, Junior and Senior try

by a try-out for the double teams.
The interclass tournament proper
will then be played, the Senior
Class first playing against the Jun
ior, and the Sophomore against the
Freshman. The winners will then
meet in the final matches.
A large amount of excellent
material seems to be present in the
Freshman Class, and the try-out
to-morrow will be watched with
interest, as four or five players with
good records will be among the
entries. Among the Seniors, G. A.
Hodge and C. G. Guyer should
have little difficulty in holding
their places, although it is not yet
certain that Hodge will play. The
Junior and Sophomore tourna
ments will be open contests, as
neither of the teams that won last
year have both their men back in
college.
Although George Hodge may not
participate in the tournaments this
fall, it is fairly certain that he will
play in the Varsity try-outs next
spring. A. R.MaeS wain,ex-'OB, who
played in the singles in the inter
collegiate match last year, will not
return to college.
