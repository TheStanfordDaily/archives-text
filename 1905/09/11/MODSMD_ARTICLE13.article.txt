# BISHOP NICHOLS' SERMON.
## Many Listen to an Interesting: Talk by the Well-Known Clergyman.

The Right Reverend Bishop
Nichols preached in the Memorial
Church yesterday morning. In
the course of his sermon he said,
in part:
"One word to paint the best gen
ius of youth, as it comes to the
University at the beginning of a
new year, is vision. All students
have a vision of the final diploma
and the stepping out into success
ful manhood and womanhood.
But varied and deeply interesting
are the aspirations thatconsciously
or unconsciously are in the pur
poses of the undergraduate life it
self, some looking to high scholar
ship, others to lesser ideals, down
to the life of idling and pleasure
seeking and worse. His character
istic of youth is the opportunity for
opening out, the high vision of
Jesus Christ, the Son of Man. In
the sundawn of life the sensitive
plate of character has the oppor
tunity to take on itself that image
to be fully developed in the dark
room of after experience.
"The vision of the Son of Man is
opportune for our age, as it is of
one who is the true man of might,
mighty to the pulling down of
strongholds and of one whose key
note of life was to serve. He said
of himself: 'The Son of man came
not to be ministered unto but to
minister.' His instinct was to
serve humanity rather than be
served; to give rather than to get.
With this vision in university
character it will catch his spirit
and combine might with right in
serving humanity and realize in
individual character more and
more of the meaning, the stature of
the fullness of Christ."
