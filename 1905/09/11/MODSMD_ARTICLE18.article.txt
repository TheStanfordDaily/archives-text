### 
The University of California
freshmen play their first game this
afternoon, when they meet the
eleven from Berkeley High School.
The freshmen have been in train
ing for three weeks, and during
that time the team has not lined
up in public. From all accounts
the team will be light and swift,
and will rely greatly upon speed
in their contests.
