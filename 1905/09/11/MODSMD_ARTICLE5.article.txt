# ENTHUSIASTIC RALLY OPENS SEASON
## Large Crowd Gathers for Meeting.—Record-Breaking Number of Candidates Sign Roll. 
### 
The football season of 1905 was
formally opened by an enthusiastic
rally held in Encina Hall Friday
night. It was one of the largest
attended preliminary rallies ever
held at Stanford. Enthusiasm
was at a high pitch, and the yell
ing and singing were exceptionally
good for so early in the season.
After the conclusion of the speech
making, the candidates for the two
elevens signed up for the coming
season. Fifty-two old players and
sixty-six Freshmen affixed their
names to the training rules.
Speeches were made by the fol
lowing: Professor Colbert Searles,
Dr. Frank Angell, Captain A. J.
Chalmers,'o7,Rev. I). Charles Gard
ner, Assistant-Coach Bansbach, '05,
Trainer "Dad" Moulton,and Head-
Coach J. F. Lanagan, '00. None of
the talks were tinged with over
confidence, but all of them were far
from pessimistic in tone. All of
the speakers dwelt at length on the
necessity of the candidates for the
elevens keeping up in their college
work.
Professor Searles said in part:
"Preparatory school stars think
that the system which they have
been accustomed to is the correct
one, but we think that we have the
right method, and you men of 1909
must lay aside your system."
The next speaker, Captain Chal
mers, said: "I hope that the enthu
siasm of to-night will prevail
throughout the season. Everyone
will be given a chance to make
the team, as there will be a Stan
ford squad, but no Stanford team,
until the day of the big game. To
remain on the squad, it is vitally
necessary that each candidate for
the team should keep up his stan
dard of scholarship. If this is
done, with coaches like Lanagan
and Bansbach, and "Dad" to keep
us in good shape, we cannot help
winning."
Assistant-Coach Bansbach was
the next speaker. He said: "I wish
to speak to the Freshmen rather
than to the old players. Every man
of you who has ever worn a foot
ball suit, or who is physically able,
ought to appear on the field. You
must keep up in your work, for it
is as much a breach of training
rules to fall down in your studies
as to drink or smoke. The best
eleven men on the Freshman squad
must make the team to beat Cali
fornia, but the best man on the
squad will be dismissed if he breaks
training rules."
Trainer "Dad" Moulton ad
dressed his remarks chiefly to the
new men, saying: "Any man, who
will pay attention to the instruc
tions of the coach, and outplay the
other men, will make the team, if
he does not break training rules.
You must not break training rules,
for men who violate them will be
dismissed, if it breaks up the whole
team."

Dr. Gardner said: "I believe,
with all my friends, that out of the
crowd before us we will develop
two winning teams."
He was followed by Dr. Angell,
who said in part: "I want to give
my unqualified sanction to the
brand of athletics introduced here
by "Jimmy" Lanagan arid "Dad"
Moulton. The clean and decent
football played at Denver last year
was a matter of general comment
by the Coloradans who witnessed
the contest. Every man here
should help us to dedicate the new
field with a Stanford victory,
cleanly and honestly won."
When Head-Coach Lanagan rose
to make the final talk, he received
a tremendous ovation. With char
acteristic promptness he at once
plunged into the subject nearest
his heart, saying: "We are up
against the real thing, and 1 think
there is no danger of over-confi
dence. The three old men, who
have returned as a nucleus for a
team, are all fighters, and were
among the best players on last
year's eleven. Every man on the
field will receive attention except
the loafer, who will not be tole
rated for a moment. As we, the
coaches and trainer, are held re
sponsible for the success of the team,
we will insist on men obeying
orders without argument. Off the
field we will be ready to listen to
any complaint which may be
made. The formation and success
of the team is in your hands.
Think very seriously of what you
are going to do."
