## Over Two Hundred Men Turned Out for March Around the Campus, Roble and the Row.

The largest and most spectacular
"nightshirt" parade ever held on the
campus took place last night. Near
ly ail the residents of Enoiua Hall,
numbering over two hundred and
twenty-five, turned out laÂ»4 night
in various-colored pajamas and
nightshirts. The parade was led
by E. A. Cunha, '06, and a large
drum was carried at the head of
the procession to add to the noise.
Starting at 10 o'clock from En
cina in lock-step, the long line of
white clad students marched to
Roble Hall. Here the serpentine

singing. From here the procession
proceeded to the row, serenading
the different sorority and fraternity
houses and cheering for the well
known men in each house.
After visiting all the houses on
the row the procession returned to
Encina. The "nightshirt" parade
is an annual affair and last night's
effort eclipsed any previous at
