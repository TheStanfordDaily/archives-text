# WORK BEGUN ON BLEACHERS.
## Contract Calls for Their Completion by October Twenty-first. 
### 
The first bent in the bleachers at
the new football field was raised
this morning, and within a week a
force of thirty men will be engaged
in placing the remainder of the up
rights which will support the seats.
This marks the beginning of the
second stage in the construction of
Stanford's new athletic field. The
grading was completed by the first
of September, and the concrete
stands which form the foundation
of the new bleachers were then in
place.
The contract for the bleachers
was let to L. S. Bean of Palo Alto
for $7,200, and calls for completion
before the twenty-first of October
at a penalty of $100 for every
day's delay after this date.
