# DR. JORDAN RETURNS
## STANFORD'S PRESIDENT BACK FROM EUROPEAN TRIP. Describes His Experiences in England and on Continent.—lnvestigated University Progress. 
### 
President Jordan returned to the
University lute yesterday after
noon, having thoroughly enjoyed
his summer trip to Europe. He
made a very successful tour of
England and the continent, and ac
complished the two main objects of
his journey—recreation and the
study of European university con
ditions.
Dr. Jordan, accompanied by his
wife and daughter, left Stanford
early in June, proceeding directly
to Boston. After a short visit at
Harvard University they sailed for
France, arriving in Paris about the
middle of the month.
From Paris the party made a
trip to the Alps of Dauphiny and
thence into Switzerland, where they
were able to enjoy a week of rest
and quiet, before the arrival of the
crowds of tourists.
Passing through Luxemburg Dr.
Jordan made a tour of the great
German universities, and then
went by boat down the beautiful
river Moselle. From Germany he
crossed over to England, where
more than half of the summer was
spent.
During the time Dr. Jordan was
in London he met a number of
Stanford men, among them H. C.
Hoover, '95, W. A. Prichard, '98,
and J. H. Means, '92, who are now
three of the leading mining engi
neers in London. Early in August
Hoover was called away to Austral
ia, and during his absence he placed
his automobile at Dr. Jordan's dis
posal. In this the party took a
most interesting trip through
southern England, stopping for a
short time at the University of
Cambridge.
At length Dr. Jordan returned
to Paris intending to take passage
for America about the middle of
September. He found that no
berth could be secured on any
steamer sailing after the eighth,
and that unless he came home at
once it would be impossible for
him to cross before the first of
October. This was the only cause
for Dr. Jordan's early return.
The results of his investigations
at the European universities Dr.
Jordan intends to embody in a
speech which he will deliver at the
next Assembly. He was especially
interested in the municipal univer
sity of science school which is now
in vogue in many of the larger
English cities.
At Cambridge, where the long
vacation had not begun, all of the
professors were much interested in
the work and plans of Dr. Jordan,
showing much curiosity regarding
Stanford University. At Oxford
Dr. Jordan was unable to see much
of the university life as thesummer
recess had commenced and the
place was almost deserted.
A University Assembly will be
held in the course of the next two
weeks, at which he will give a more

detailed account of the results of
his trip, especially such as concern
the future welfare of Stanford Uni
versity.
Dr. Jordan stated that he knew
nothing of the proposed plan for
the painting of his portrait by Sar
gent, in London. The first that
Dr. Jordan heard of the matter
was from a clipping of a San Fran
cisco paper.
