# A 						FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## AFTERNOON'S WORK BRINGS OUT MANY CANDIDATES. Squad of One Hundred and Twenty-Four Report for Work and Are Given Light Training. 
### 
One hundred and twenty-four
men appeared on the football field
yesterday afternoon, for the first
practice of the year. Just how
many of these are candidates for
the Varsity team, and how many
anticipate a place on the Freshman
eleven, could not be ascertained.
The size and the material com
prising the squad are reminders
that competition for both teams
will lie keener than usual this sea
son. The increase in the number
of men who have turned out for
football this fall is quite remark
able, when it is remembered that
on the first day last year only
eighty men reported.
Head-Coach Lanagan, '00, As
sistant-Coach Bansbach, '05, and
Captain Chalmers, '07, took charge
of the men upon their arrival at
the training-house, and after a few
preliminary remarks led the
squad to the field, where the roll
was called.
The first thing on the program
was a ten-minute dumb-bell drill,
which was participated in by all
the men. Head-Coach Lanagan
then divided the squad into three
sections, taking charge of one divi
sion himself, while the two remain
ing divisions were drilled by As
sistant-Coach Bansbach and Cap
tain Chalmers. Punting, hand
ling of kicks, and running down on
punts by the linemen, were prac
ticed by the first two squads. The
players whom Captain Chalmers
had in charge were mostly linemen
and devoted their time to catching
and passing the ball. No attempt
was made by Head-Coach Lanagan
to segregate the Varsity and Fresh
man squads, and the three sections
were made up equally of old and
new men. The players ran two
laps around the track at the con
clusion of practice.
Several candidates who failed to
sign up last Friday night received
suits from Manager Barrett and
reported for the first practice.
They were: R. A. Thompson, '05,
guard on the Varsity for three sea
sons; J. N. Stanford,'o6, sub-end
last year; L. Bogle, '06, sub-full
back last season; and A. L. Tay
lor, '06.
