# LARGE FUND SECURED
## TRAINING HOUSE STATEMENT SHOWS INCREASE IN CASH. Approximately Twelve Thousand Dollars Now on Hand for Construction of Athletic Field. 
### 
The Training House Fund, which
will be devoted to the building of
the new football field, has reached
approximately $12,000. This sum
consists of $8,806 gathered by the
Training House Corporation up to
May, 1900, $541 collected by popu
lar subscription last spring, $1061
from the student body assessment
collected at the last registration,
and fifty per cent of the net surplus
remaining in the student body
treasury at the end of last year,
which is approximately $1,500.
The amount of student body dues
collected by Treasurer Barrett this
year greatly exceeds any sum pre
viously secured, the total being
$1256. Of this $195 is set aside
for the girls' athletic fund, this be
ing half the amount of dues paid
by the women students of the Uni
versity. During the semester the
fund will be increased by the ad
dition of ten per cent of the gross
receipts of all the football games,
including also the intercollegiate
match.
An effort was made last semester
to raise money by a popular stu
dent subscription of one dollar.
The canvass produced but $541,
but the subscription list is still
often to those who have not con
tributed. Treasurer Barrett will
keep office hours daily in the gym
nasium from 1:30 to 2:00, for the
purpose of receiving these volun
tary subscriptions and any unpaid
student body assessments.
The report of the finances of the
Training House Corporation is the
first that has been made since
April, 1901. At that time Dr.
Frank Angell became treasurer of
the corporation and had the funds
audited by a committee consisting
of Professor A. T. Murray and
student body treasurer J. T.
Nourse, '00. The accounts showed
a cash balance of $1453, and no
liabilities. Since that time the
annual statements of the amounts
handed over by student body treas
urers have been the only reports
made. Dr. Angell desired that the
accounts be formally examined by
an auditing committee before the
corporation starts in on the large
expenditures for the athletic fields.
The report, as approved by R. \V.
Barrett, '04, J. E. McDowel I,'oo,
and Dr. W. F. Snow, the auditing
committee, will be found on the
fourth page.
