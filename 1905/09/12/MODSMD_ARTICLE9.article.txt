Right at the beginning of the
football work it may be well to call
the attention of the bleacher occu
pants to a feature that developed
last year to some extent before it
was checked, and which is slightly
visible now. It is not at all desir
able to laugh at the errors or mis
haps of the football men, and es
pecially is tins true in the case of
the Freshmen, who happen to be
directly in front of the bleachers.
It must be remembered that the
latter are new to Stanford and
Stanford ways, and indeed many
of them are comparatively new to
the game of football. It is this
material we want, however, and it
would be unfortunate to convey
the impression that the men are
being ridiculed or made fun of.
The men and women on the bleach
ers are preeminently fair-minded
and considerate, and undoubtedly
this suggestion will prove as effec
tive as it was last year.
