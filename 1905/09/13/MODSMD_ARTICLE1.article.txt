# PRACTICE CONTINUES
## SECOND AFTERNOON'S WORK SIMILAR TO OPENING DAT. Candidates for Varsity and Freshman Teams Instructed in Rudiments of Game. 
### 
The second day's work on the
football field was similar to that of
the opening day. Ten minutes
were devoted to dumb-beil exercise
on the field, after which the squad
was divided into three sections.
No attempt was made to separ
ate the Freshman and Varsity
squads. The first few days will be
spent in light practice for the pur
pose of limbering up the men.
With this end in view the work
yesterday was of the same charac
ter as on the first day.
Twenty minutes was occupied in
passing and catching the ball. In
structions were also given as to the
proper way of handling and hold
ing it.
The squad was then divided into
three sections and worked in differ
ent parts of the field under the
supervision respectively of Head-
Coach Lanagan, '00, Assistant-
Coach Bansbach, '05, and Captain
Chalmers, '07.
Each squad was divided into
two parts, one at either end of the
field. Candidates for center and
linemen alternated at passing the
ball to four or more backs, who
took turns at punting. Candidates
for various positions both on the
Varsity and Freshman teams were
stationed on either side of center
and ran down on punts. The sec
ond part of each squad, who were
stationed in two lines some yards
distant, practiced catching the ball
and returning it for a short dist
ance. After twenty minutes of
steady work at this part of the exer
cises, the men ran two laps on the
track and completed another day's
training.
Several Freshmen are punting
very well for so early in the season,
and the excellent possibilities
among the entering class, in this
part of the game, are of no small
importance.
The football squad was augment
ed yesterday by the appearance of
J. F. W. Crow, '07, candidate for
full-back; T. Vandervoort, '08, right
half-back on the Freshman team
last year, and candidate for the
same position on the Varsity; and
N. E. Doane, who is a candidate
for center.
