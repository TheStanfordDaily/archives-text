# Favre to Resign from "Alumnus."
## 
### 
E. B. Favre, '05, will shortly re
sign his position as business man

ager of the Alumnus. This action
will be taken because Mr. Favre
will be unable to be in San Fran
cisco for some time to come. He is
at present employed by the Call
and has been detailed to Mare Isl
and to report the proceedings of the
Bennington court martial.
