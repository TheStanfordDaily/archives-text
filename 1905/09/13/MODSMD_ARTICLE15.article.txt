At a meeting of the Athletic
Committee held over a year ago, it
was decided that preparatory
school sweaters bearing various em
blems should not be worn bv stu
dents, unless the men wearing them
had won their Varsity emblem at
Stanford. The action of the Ath
letic Committee in making this
rule resulted in the immediate dis
appearance of the heretofore too
evident high school emblems.
A large number of men are un
doubtedly not aware of the Athlet
ic Committee's ruling, and as a re
sult a number of preparatory school
sweaters have been seen about the
campus, on the football field and
on the tennis courts. The mere
calling the attention of these
men to the fact that they are trans
gressing one of the customs of Stan
ford will undoubtedly result in this
rule not being again infringed.
