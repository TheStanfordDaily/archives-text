# Fall Baseball Practice.
## 
### 
Fall baseball practice commenced
at California Monday night. A
large number of players turned out,
and Captain Causley outlined his
plans for this fall. Practice will
be held three times a week, and a
series of interclass games is being
arranged.
There are several promising
freshman ball players out for
practice, and with this new material
and several of last year's veterans
in college the chances for a good
varsity baseball team are bright.
