# Mosaics Nearing Completion.
## 
### 
The work of decorating the in
terior of the Memorial Church with
mosaics is almost completed. In

the nave of the structure a series of
mosaic pictures dealing with New
Testament subjects has just been
finished by the Italian artisans.
The solid gold of the nave has
been broken by inserting mosaic
emblems. Four designs have been
placed in the west aisle, and the
east aisle is yet to receive the same
number. At the south end of the
west side is a mosaic picture of
Veronica.
The cross, three nails, hammer,
and tongs are grouped to form the
next design, and represent the in
struments by which Christ was
put to death. Another group is
made up of the ladder, spear and
sponge used in the crucifixion.
On the east side is to be placed
the "Dove of Peace," "Crown of
Thorns," "Lillies of Purity," and
"Charity."
