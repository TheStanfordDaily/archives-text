# CHANGE IN FIRE DEPARTMENT
## No Regular Employee of University at Fire House this Semester. 
### 
This year a new policy has been
introduced in the management of
the student fire department. Last
year five students and an employee
of the University composed the fire
department. This semester instead
of having one of the employees of
the University in charge of the
house and apparatus, the six stu
dents living there will have entire
control.
There are two reasons for this
change. There is no available em
ployee of the University who is
competent to take charge of the de
partment; and secondly, three of
the students who composed the
fire department last year have re
turned, and with their previous
training they will be able to man
age the department.
The old men who are back this
year are: F. R. Lanagan, '08, C. A.
Lantz, '08, and F. O. Lantz, '08.
The new men who will form part
of the company this semester are:
J. F. W. Crow, '07, E. W. Rice, '08,
and J. R. Wallace, '09.
