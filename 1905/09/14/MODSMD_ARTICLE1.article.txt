# NO TRUTH IN RUMORS
## GUILD BOARD DENIES PASSING COMPROMISE MEASURE. Story that Palo Alto People Were Admitted to Stop Legal Action Untrue. 
### 
The announcement which ap
peared during the summer in the
San Francisco and Palo Alto pa
pers, that the town of Palo Alto
was endeavoring to close the Guild
Hospital, has given rise to many
misconceived and erroneons ideas.
The one law under which the
Guild could he prosecuted is a
state statute prohibiting the trans
portation of contagious diseases
from one sanitary district to an
other. Should the trustees of Palo
Alto care to prosecute on this
charge, they might be able to com
pel the Guild to make other pro
vision for the treatment of con
tagious diseases; but this would
not necessarily mean the closing of
the hospital.
The only other legal steps which
could lie taken would be applica
tion for a temporary injunction,
which might be obtained by neigh
boring property owners on the
ground that the presence of the
hospital depreciated the value of
real estate in that neighborhood.
Two or three people have threat
ened to do this, but so far no defi
nite action has been taken.
In this connection the directors
desire to correct the general im
pression that they parsed the rule
admitting people of Palo Alto to
the hospital as a compromise
measure. The board has had no
direct trouble with the people of
Palo Alto, and so had no reasons
for desiring to effect any compro
mise.
The admission of the people 'of
Palo Alto to the privileges of the
hospital on payment of $25 a week,
has been considered by the board
for some time past. Heretofore
whenever one or two students
above tlie regular capacity have
been admitted to the hospital, it
has been necessary to lute outside
nurses at heavy expense. Now the
board hopes to be able to keep one
or two additional nurses in atten
dance regularly in case there
should be an increased number of
patients. Thus the Guild expects
to better its service at no increased
expense to the student body.
Another statement which has
been widely misunderstood con
cerns the admission of professors'
families on the same basis as the
general student body. Every pro
fessor may obtain membership for
any or all members of his family,
but only on the payment of the
regular two dollar fee for each in
dividual. These patients will be
charged a dollar and a half a day
while in the hospital.
The chief harm done by all this
controversy has been in the wide
spread reports circulated through
out the country that there were
many cases of contagious disease
at Stanford. This is not true.
There is no reason to anticipate the
development of any epidemic and

no basis for any general contro
versy between the students and
citizens cf Palo Alto.
