Thk tradition that Freshmen in
training for any of the teams must
not he molested hy hnzers is one of
the wisest of our unwritten laws,
and the recent breach of this reg
ulation hy certain misguided Soph
omores is a matter of regret. Those
Sophomores who engaged in scuf
fles with Freshmen football players,
which might have resulted in the
latter's serious injury, were endan
gering the chances of their college
winning the annual game with
California; and thought "less as their
action may have been, they were
nevertheless doing a disloyal act.
The Freshmen in question may
have rightly deserved the hazing
which their rivals attempted to
impose on them, but the student
who does not place his college loy
alty far above his class spirit is a
very poor Stanford man.
