# CHANGES IN GYMNASIUM WORK
## Substitution of Athletics No Longer Allowed.â€”Lecture Course Arranged. 
### 
Commencing wilh this semester
several changes will he inaugurated
in the administration of the Gym
nasium classes. This year there
will not he any substitution of
athletics for University credit in
gymnasium work. Another new
feature is the lecture course in con
junction with the regular work for
beginning classes.
The substitution system has nev
er been entirely successful, for the
reason that at the end of each ath
letic season the gymnasium classes
had to be entirely reorganized to
accommodate those who had been
substituting out-door work for the
regular class exercises. Under
the new arrangement about to be
adopted there will be a special
class for athletes, which will not
commence until the football season
is over. At that time those who
have played football may report
for work in the gymnasium, and
continue such work until about the
Ist of March, when theclass will be
discontinued during the track and
baseball practice. One University
credit will lie given for the year's
work.
The lecture for the Freshmen is
the outgrowth of a demand for the
continuance of Professor Storey's
ten-minute practical talks on hy
giene.
