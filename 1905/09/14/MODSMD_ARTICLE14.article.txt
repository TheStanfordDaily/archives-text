# BUILDINGS PROGRESSING.
## Dances Will Not Be Held in Gymnasium Next Semester. 
### 
The exterior work on the new
Gymnasium is practically com
pleted and laborers are engaged on
the interior. Many of the rooms
have received the last coat of
plaster.
Architect Hodges was asked if
it would he possible to hold any
of the class dances in the hall of
the Gymnasium next spring, and
he replied that none of the build
ing will he given over until it is all
completed. As the building will
not be entirely completed until
next summer the class dances will
probably be held in Encina Hall
as last year.
The concrete work of the swim
ming tank has been completed and
contracts have been let for the
plumbing and heating of the water
for the new natatorium.
The stone work on the new Li
brary is progressing rapidly but it
is still several months from com
pletion. The side walls of this
building have been erected and the
masons are now placing the stone
work on the huge dome. A force
of stone cutters are busy carving
the ornamental work on the front
of the building and will have this
finished by the time that the other
masonry is completed.
Work on this building will pro
gress as rapidly as the money for
its erection is on hand, and the con
tracts will l>e let as fast as possi
ble.
