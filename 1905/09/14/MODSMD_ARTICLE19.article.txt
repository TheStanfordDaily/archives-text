# SQUAD LEARNING GAME.
## Several Sets of Linemen Put Through Light Scrimmage Work Yesterday Afternoon. 
### 
Head-Coach Lanagan tried sev
eral sets of linemen in light scrim
mage work yesterday afternoon.
This is the first departure from the
routine work of dumb-bell exercise,
catching and holding the "nail,
punting, and running down on
punts. Yesterday the men were
divided into sections as on the pre
vious days, and given personal
instruction by Lanagan, who
devoted his time equally among
the three squads. The men are
working (iff tiie rough edges slowly,
and accustoming themselves to the
new field.
The practice yesterday was even
lighter than on Tuesday, most of
the time being devoted to holding
and catching the hall and to punt
ing and running down on punts.
There seem to be several good
kickers among the Freshmen. Some
of the punts were of the first class
variety, averaging forty yards.
This part of the game will be given
special attention, and nil available
material will be thoroughly tried
out.
Many of the Freshmen trying
for back-field positions are finding

difficulty in gauging the length
and direction of punts, and conse
quently practice in this particular
part of the game will be given
special attention.
No line-up will take place before
Saturday, and it is not definitely
known whether the Freshmen will
be given preliminary team work
before Monday. Their Hint, game
of the season, against the Berkeley
High School team, will take place
on the campus next Wednesday
afternoon.
