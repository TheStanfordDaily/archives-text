# TWO GAMES ON SAME DAY.
## Freshman and Varsity Contests Will Be Held on Same Afternoon. 
### 
A departure from the usual order
of football games has been made by
Manager Barrett, who proposes to
try the scheme of playing two
games on one afternoon. He has
scheduled an event of this kind for
September 30th, when the Varsity
will meet Willamette College, and
the Freshmen will play the Palo
Alto High School eleven.
It is Manager Barrett's plan to
have the first game called at 2:30
and the second at four o'clock, the
Freshman contest to precede the
Varsity game. One admission will
be charged for both games.
No further preliminary games
have been scheduled either for the
Varsity or Freshman teams. Games
with Belmont School, St. Matthew's
School, San Mateo and Hoitt's
School will be arranged for the
Freshmen, the games to be played
on the afternoon of some Varsity
game.
The date of the Oregon game has
been changed to October 17th. This
struggle has generally been held on
October Bth, but Manager Barrett
has found it necessary to have the
game later in the month.
