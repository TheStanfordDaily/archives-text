V. A. Steele, 39.

J. H. Bell, the president-elect, is
a well-known athlete, having taken
a prominent part in the class and
Varsity baseball games last spring.
Bell played second base for 1908 in
the interclass series and later held
the same position on the Varsity
against California.
The matter of producing a class
comedy will be considered in the
near future. Early next week a
meeting of the class will probably
be called to consider this question.
