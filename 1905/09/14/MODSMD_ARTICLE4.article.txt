The English Club held its first
meeting last night at the Delta
Gamma house. President-elect A.
11. Fletcher, ex-'O6, tendered his
resignation, as lie will not return
to college this year. The matter of
the nomination and election of his
successor was laid on the table un
der the ruling of the constitution,
and will be brought up at a meet
ing to be held in two weeks.
Professor E. K. Putman reported
for the financial committee of the
play "'Every Man in his Humour,"
which was presented by the club
la*t semester. The report showed
a balance of $91.48, one half of
which will be turned over to the
Boat Club.
Another new departure which
was made last night provides for
regular cards, which will be filled
out by any distinguished visitors
attending 'the meetings of the Club.
At, the close of the business meet
ing J. K. Bonnell, '02. gave a short
talk on Whistler, the eccentric
American painter. He said in
part:
"My excuse for talking about
Whistler at all is that I saw him
and heard him talk several times
to the students in the little Atelier
in Paris known as the 'Academic
Whistler et MacMonnies.' My
own impression of the man when I
had come into personal contact
with him was so different from the
conception I had previously de
rived from the caricatures and com
ments of magazines and news
papers, that 1 thought possibly you
might be interested to hear what
that impression was.
''Even his friends seem to have
exaggerated his eccentricities, even
the serious portraits suggest a cer
tain harshness and sinister aggres
siveness. I had expected to find
this man of infinite assurance, who
set the world at defiance and boast
ed of making enemies,a formidable
person, sardonic and unsympathet
ic, —or at least, in his butterfly
characteristics, unwilling seriously
to acknowledge the claims of ob
scure students upon his time and
attention.
"What I beheld was a slight,
pink-cheeked, dapper little old gen
tleman, with curly gray hair, cat
like moustaches and imperial, clad
becomingly in a long well-fitting
frock coat, carrying aflat-brimmed
silk bat and wearing a monocle.
His voice was soft, low, rather
English; his manner politely for
mal but on the whole kindly."
Concerning Whistler's place in
art, he said: ''Hut remember that,
coxcomb though he may have ap
peared, with enough little foibles
and vanities to laugh at, he was
nevertheless the apostle of great and
abiding principles in art. He
preached and exemplified, from
first to last, art, pure and absolute,
and helped to free art from the

deadening hindrance of mere pic
torial or sentimental story-interest,
lie was a prophet of lieauty to a
sordid and unsympathetic world,
and fought an up-hill fight against
appalling odds. Though his field
was narrow his ideals were the
highest and he was unwavering in
his devotion to them. No consid
eration of gain, in money or in rep
utation, ever caused him to deviate
from the pursuit of aesthetic truth.
In the matter of composition and
in the development of the subtlest
harmonies of tone and color he has
done a rt an inestimable service and
while he may he regarded as essen
tially an artist's artist, in his
greatest paintings and etchings he
has left the world a noble and last
ing heritage. Remember him as
the idealist, the man who having
in his youth beheld the vision of
beauty remained faithful to that
vision to the grave,—who 'followed
gleam.'"
