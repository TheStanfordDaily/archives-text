# WAR VETERAN SPEAKS
## COMMANDER TANNER ADDRESSES SPECIAL ASSEMBLY. Talks on Incidents Connected with the Civil War, in which He Took Active Part. 
### 
A large audience was present at
the first special Assembly of the
year which was held in Assembly
Hall this afternoon beginning at
3:o0. The speaker of the afternoon
was "Corporal" James Tanner, the
recently elected Grand Commander
of the Grand Army of the Repub
lic.
Mr. Tanner was introduced by
President Jordan, and was accom
panied on the platform by seven
members of the local staff of the
Grand Army. Mr. Tanner's speech
was taken up with telling striking
incidents of the Civil War, many
of them being personal remini
scences of the speaker. Mr. Tanner
spoke in part as follows:
"Thousands of episodes of heroism
that will he untold occurred during
the War. Not only the Northerner
but the Southerner did his part in
proving the heroism of the Ameri
can race. If any man refers slight
ingly to the valor of a "wearer of
gray" it is the best evidence that
that man has never seen one in
action. It was my own misfortune
to hear a great deal of the talk of
those who stayed at home and crit
icised, as at the Battle of Malvern
Hill, I was formally mustered out
of service by having both of my
legs carried away by a cannon-ball.
Many were the men who sat around
and cried 'On to Richmond,' while
the Army of the Potomac struggled
through the wilderness, gaining
the way inch by inch to the Con
federate capital, paving the way
with its blood. These men were
'invincible at home, invisible in
war.'
"I have heard it and it is
well said, that the great Civil War
was fought out first by the men,
second by the mothers who bore
them, and thirdly by the girls who
waited for them at home. The
Confederate soldier knew that no
death he could face on the field of
battle could compare with the
depth of disgrace that would greet
him upon his return if he did not
seek the foremost rank in each en
counter. And to the Northerner
the thought of the mother and the
sweetheart waiting for him at
home was a source of constant in
spiration. Nothing that I have
known in life has led me to a
higher estimate of the position of
American womanhood than the
thought of the part they played in
the winning and losing of the Civil
War. And I look forward to the
day when common suffrage at the
polls shall remove the last bar to
the absolute equality that should
exist between the American woman
and her husband.
"it. is an inspiring thought to me
after witnessing the meeting of
veterans held at Denver last week
to be present with you to-day.
There were thp men whose work
was all behind them, who see to

day the accomplishment of all
their hopes in the greatness of the
nation. Your work is all before
you, and with all the advantages
and promises with which you are
starting out, there is no reason to
doubt your lives will be crowned
with as great a reward as theirs."
