Squad Soon to Be Divided Into
Teams, and Signal Practice
Start.
Head-Coach Lanagan gave the
signals to the football squad yes
terday afternoon,in preparation for
the first signal practice of the year,
which will occur to-morrow after
noon. The men are expected to
master the signals at once, so that
there will be no delay in executing
the combinations. The practice to
morrow will begin at 3:30, and the
squad will probably be divided
into teams, so that the signals can
be practiced.
The work yesterday afternoon
consisted principally in falling on
the ball. E. P. Stott, '07, assisted
in coaching the men in this parti
cular part of the game.
Light scrimmage work was again
participated in by the linemen, un
der the personal supervision of
Head-Coach Lanagan. The quart
er-backs were given special instruc
tion in playing their positions.
The Varsity men showed good
form yesterday in falling on the
ball, and afforded a stimulus to the
Freshmen, who seemed to lack in
vim. A short part of the hour was
given to punting, at which several
new men showed possibilities in
this department of the game.
G. W. Smith Joins Squad.
G. W. Smith, '07, former Varsity
end, who played on the 6-6 team,
appeared on the football field for
the first time this evening. He
will be a regular candidate for the
same position on this year's Var
sity.
