# JUNIORS START TOURNAMENT.
## Eight Men Turn Out for Class Championship.â€”Plans for Interclass. 
### 
This afternoon the drawings for
the Junior try-outs were held.
There areeightentries in the tourna
ment for the third-year men, which
ought to give rise to some very close
matches. The small number of
players will make it possible to
finish the tournament by to-mor
row noon, and the try-outs for the
Seniors will begin at that time.
The drawings for the Junior try
out resulted as follows: G. E. Dole
vs. J. F. Cassell, M. C. Burr vs. C.
L. Lewis, S. M. Salisbury vs. A.

Rosenfeld, W. H. Swayne vs. W.
\V. Ward.
The entries for the doubles try
outs for all classes close to-night
and play will begin immediately to
pick the various teams. The doub
les try-outs will not be conducted
in the regular order of classes, but
as is most convenient for the play
ers.
According to the new ruling of the
executive commiteee of the Tennis
Club the men who won their class
championship last year will not be
permitted to defend their titles
simply against the runner-up in
the tournament this year, but
must play through the entire try
outs.
The interclass tournament will
be played a week from to-morrow.
The Freshman and Sophomore
representatives will meet in the
first match, followed immediately
by the match between the Junior
and Senior class champions. The
winners of these matches will meet
in the finals to decide the Univer
sity championship.
