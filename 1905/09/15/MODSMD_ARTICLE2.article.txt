# COMPETITION STARTS
## FOOTBALL SHOW WILL BE HELD ON THE CAMPUS. Affair May Take Place on New Gridiron.â€”Large Cash Prize Offered. 
### 
Preparations are actively under
way for the presentation of the
football show, which will be given
on the night of the intercollegiate
game. The sub-committee ap
pointed by the Executive Commit
tee to take charge of the ar
rangements for the production
have announced that the compe
tition for the $50 prize offered for
the best show manuscript will com
mence at once and continue until
October 10th. On or before that
date the manuscripts may he sub
mitted to the judgment of the fol
lowing committee: Rev. I). Charles
Gardner, Instructor L E. Bassett,
Miss Alice S. Hayes, '06, D. I).
Sales, '06, and E. R. May, '06.
Each contestant will rend his own
manuscript, and the committee
will lose no time in announcing its
decision, so that active preparations
for staging the successful show can
be commenced at once.
The committee in charge of the
contest will allow the competitors
the greatest latitude as to the form
of the show to be submitted to the
judges. It is presumed, however,
that the show will be in the nature
of a farce or a musical comedy.
The competition is open to all
students, either graduates or un
dergraduates, who are regularly
registered in the University. In
view of the fact that the prize of
fered consists of $50 in cash, it is
probable that the competition will
be spirited.
The rumor that the show would
be held in San Francisco is denied
by those in charge of the affair,
and it can be definitely stated that
the production will be staged on
the campus. If the nature of the
successful show permits of an out
door presentation it may be pro
duced on the new football field.
