# CROSS- COUNTRY CLUB
## EFFORT BEING MADE TO INTRODUCE THIS SPORT. E.R. Post and H.L. Drummond, Late of Chicago University, at the Head of New Movement. 
### 
A well-defined movement is on
foot to organize a cross-country
club, and from all indications this
branch of athletics will become
firmly established here. E. R.
Post, '07, and H. L. Drummond,
'07, of Chicago University, and
William B. Loughborough, '07, of
the University of Kansas, are old
and experienced cross-country men
who entered Stanford this fall.
Post and Drummond are at the
head of the plan to organize the
club. They were prominent mem
bers of the Chicago Cross-Country
Club, while Loughborough ran
with the Kansas Club.
Dr. Frank Angell of the Athletic
Committee was interviewed yester
day afternoon on the subject of the
formation of a cross-country club
and expressed himself as very
much in favor of introducing the
sport at Stanford. Dr. Snow is
also very enthusiastic over the
formation of a club of this kind,
and is lending his aid to the move
ment.
When "Dad" Moulton was ap
proached with the plan, he ex
pressed an eager desire to see the
club organized.
"It will be a fine thing for Stan
ford athletes," stated the trainer
yesterday afternoon, "and will
bring out a large number of men
who do not come out at present.
It will develop many a long-dis
tance track man for Stanford."
Cross-country clubs are very
popular in England and among
the universities of the East and
Middle West. Candidates for the
track and the crew are usually
found doing their fall training as
members of the cross-country clubs.
Contests are held between classes
and schools, and in this manner the
tedium of the long preliminary
work is lightened.
On account of the splendid cli
matic conditions in California and
the character of the land about
Stanford for cross-country work,
the club should be a success.
In England the cross-country
run is usually considerably longer
than in the United States. A run
of twenty miles is not uncommon.
In the United States the course
usually varies between two and
five miles.
The present plans of the Stan
ford promoters are to hold two
mile runs at the start and to gradu
ally increase the distance as the
season progresses. Three runs a
week will be held after the club is
fully organized, and several teams
consisting of five men each will
probably be organized, as soon as
the club gets well started.
It is not improbable that the
sport will become an intercollegi
ate event. There is a strong senti
ment in favor of the formation of a
cross-country club at the Univer
sity of California, and an intercol

legiate con test between Stanford and
California would prove of great in
terest.
To further stimulate interest in
the new sport, the proposition of
placing a silver loving-cup up as a
prize for the best record over the
course is being discussed.
All those who wish to join the
club should leave their names with
"Dad" Moulton. A meeting will
probably be held early next week
and the club formally organized.
