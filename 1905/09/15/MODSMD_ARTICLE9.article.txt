The men who are trying to es
tablish the sport of cross-country
running at Stanford should be
given support by the University
community. This branch of ath
letics will tend to strengthen Stan
ford athletics along many lines.
The track athletes of this Coast
compare favorably with their
brothers of the Eastern states with
the exception of the distance run
ners. When Stanford sent a track
team East two years ago her dis
tance men were outclassed, and the
reason given was that the Eastern
method of training was superior to
ours in that the men in the East
trained most of the year, and es
pecially iH this true of distance
men.
With the advent of cross-coun
try work at Stanford the distance
men will develop stamina that is
essential in long-distance running,
and the improvement will be seen
when these men appear on the
track in the spring. To the crew
man, and in fact in every branch
of athletics where stamina and
"good wind" are especially needed,
long distance running will be in
valuable. With the establishment
of a cross-country club every
branch of athletics will he bene
fitted.
