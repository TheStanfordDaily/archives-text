# SATURDAY'S PRACTICE
## VARSITY AND FRESHMEN WORK SEPARATELY. Four Freshmen Sent Off the Field on Account of Tardiness in Reporting for Work. 
### 
The Varsity and Freshman
squads worked together on Friday
afternoon, going through the regu
lar routine work. On Saturday,
however, the squads were separated,
the Freshmen reporting for work
at 3:00, and the Varsity men an
hour later. Each squad went
through the regular work in turn.
The entire squad for the first time
practiced tackling the dummy.
Head-Coach Latiagan and As
sistant-Coach Bansbach gave the
entire first hour to the new men,
teaching them the rudiments of the
game.
The kicking of several Freshmen
is phenomenal. Under the tutelage
of Lanagan these men should de
velop into first-class punters. At
present, however, they have not the
form desired by the coaches.
Four Freshmen were sent to the
side-lines Saturday on account of
tardiness in reporting for work;
they will be allowed to come out
on Monday and continue practice.
The Varsity candidates lined up
on Saturday and went through
signal practice for about ten min
utes. The entire squad was given
practice in this part of the game.
Both squads are learning the sig
nals given them last Thursday and
will be given an opportunity to
day to show the coaches how pro
ficient they are in executing plays.
