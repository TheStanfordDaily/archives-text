# BOAT CLUB WILL GIVE FARCE.
## "All Tangled Up" Will Be Presented in October by-Oarsmen. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club will
give a modern society farce on Fri
day evening, October '27th, in As
sembly Hall. The play, entitled
"All Tangled Up," will be given by
the oarsmen to assist in removing
the large debt which the club has
at the present time.
The staging of the play will be
under the direction of Paul Gereon
of Sun Francisco, who has already
put several class farces upon the
Stanford stage. The cast, which
will lie selected from students who
are already well known in amateur
theatricals, will he announced
sometime this week.
"All Tangled Up" was written
by Charles Townsend, and is a
bright and lively play. The bare
outline of the story follows "Lee
Trois Chapeaux," but the charac
terization and dialogue are wholly
origi nal.
