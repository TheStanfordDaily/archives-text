It is made more obvious by every
succeeding election that the official
ballot-box is not placed in the best
location, and those who seek an ex
planation of the small number of
votes cast need not look a great
deal further than this fact for the
cause. Every member of the un
dergraduate body has the privilege
of the ballot. How many use it?
In student body elections, about
fifty per cent; in class elections,
even a smaller percentage. And
why? Because to the majority of
the students it is an effort to get lo
the polls, located as they are in an
out-of-the-way spot.
A few years ago a better location
could not have been found. The
little arch by the Memorial Court
was really the center of university
life. All work was then done in
the inner quadrangle, and the
route to the Library was through
the arcade that runs along the
Memorial Court. But year by year
buildings of the outer quadrangle
have been completed, and the inner
quadrangle has to a certain extent
been deserted. Immense numbers
of students now find their work in
the Economics, History, English
and Romanic Languages buildings,
and there are many who seldom
see the inside of the quadrangle
during voting hours.
Hence we say that the balloting
place should be changed; and no
better place could be found for it
than on the outer quadrangle, at
the steps opposite the Inn, which
the business managers of the var
ious publications have long since
recognized as the real center of
university life â€”the point by which
the great majority of the student
body passes in the routine of its
dailv work.
