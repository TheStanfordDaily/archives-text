The opening football game of the
season will be played on the cam
pus to-morrow afternoon. The
number of students present will in
dicate to a large degree the spirit
that prevails this year and which
will he such a large factor in shap
ing the teams. The support given
a team by the college determines to
a large extent the character of that
team. If the student body gets be
hind the men, the incentive to
Avork will be so much greater.
Stanford is facing a serious prob
lem this semester, and (he rooting
section will probably plav a more
important part than ever before.
Every student whose place is not
upon the field as a candidate has
his or her place to fill on the
bleachers. Let the season open
auspiciously with an unusually
large rooting section. It is not a
vital matter that the Freshmen
win this first game, but it is es
sential that the Freshmen play a
hard, clean game and that the col
lege is present to appreciate their
work.
