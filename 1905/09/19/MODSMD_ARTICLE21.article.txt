At a meeting of the directors of
the Students' Guild held this after
noon money was voted for several
improvements to the hospital. The
walls of the sick-wards will be cal
cimined, and two-wheeled chairs
will be added to the equipment for
the use of convalescents. The ad

the hospital facilities, and to meet
