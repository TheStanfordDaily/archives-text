### 
Last evening Dr. Julius Goebel,
former head of the Department of
Germanic Languages at Stanford,
received a telegram from President
Eliot of Harvard, offering Dr. Goe
bel a position as head of the de
partment of Germanic languages
at Harvard. Professor Goebel tele
graphed his acceptance immedi
ately, and is now making prepar
ations for his departure. The
Eastern university opens on Sep
tember 29th, but Dr. Goebel will
not leave for Harvard until next
Monday, arriving in Cambridge
about October Ist. Dr. Goebel's
family will continue to reside in
Palo Alto during the present
year.
The department of Germanic
languages at. Harvard is the larg
est in the United States, and is
generally acknowledged to have
the best faculty and most thorough
course in the university world. A
position at its head is one of the
greatest importance.

Dr. Goebel's connection with the
1 Stanford faculty ended last May,
when he was dismissed by Presi
dent Jordan. The history of the
trouble, as it appears from the
facts that have lieen given out from
time to time, is that on May 24th
Dr. Goebel applied to Dr. Jordan
for a sabbatical leave of absence
for one year. Previous to this time
the Advisory Board of the faculty
had considered the question of re
leasing Dr. Goebel, and had come
to a decision unfavorable to him.
Dr. Jordan, in his reply, offered
to recommend to the Board of Trus
tees the request for leave of absence
on condition that Dr. Goebel's
resignation be handed in at once,
to take effect at the end of the sab
batical leave. Dr. Goebel answered

Dr. Jordan's reply with the charge
of bribery, whereupon he was dis
missed by the President on May
26th. Dr. Goebel then appealed to
the Board of Trustees, who gave
him their answer early in August.
This was to the effect that the
trustees had no authority to take
any action in the matter, and that
Dr. Jordan's action was final. At
the same time they voted Dr. Goe
bel full salary for one year because
of the fact that he had never taken
a sabbatical leave during his ser
vice of thirteen years. Dr. Goebel
accepted the money upon learning
that there were no conditions at
tached to the acceptance. The
matter at present rests here.
