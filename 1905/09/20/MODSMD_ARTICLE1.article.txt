# WILLISTON LECTURES
## TALKS TO A LARGE AUDIENCE ON "ANCIENT SEA REPTILES." Noted Scientist of Chicago University Presents Modern Views on Interesting Subject. 
### 
Before an interested audience of
several hundred people, composed
for a large part of faculty members
and students of science, Dr. Samuel
Wendell Willieton last night de
livered an able lecture, illustrated
by stereopticon views, on the sub
ject of "Ancient Sea Reptiles."
The main thought of Professor
Williston's lecture was concerning
the evolution of certain kinds of
animals, at present living in the
water and commonly considered as
a variety of fish. In this connec
tion he prefaced his technical re
marks by the general and some
what startling statement that many
mammals, such as whales and por
poises, which lead their existence
in the water, are directly descend
ed from quadrupeds which live en
tirely on land and had the same
existence and much the same form
as the modern hyena.
To illustrate his point the lec
turer showed views of many va
rieties of modern aquatic and semi
aquatic animals, pointing out the
peculiarities in the construction of
their bones and members, which to
the scientific mind proves develop
ment from a lower stage of mam
mals existing entirely on land.
He also produced views of fossils
found in rock in various parts of
the world; fossils of aquatic ani
mals destroyed millions of years
ago. He pointed out in these
specimens the same features of con
struction, indicating their descent
from animals wholly unacquainted
with an existence in the water.
And with this same general thought
always in view of the remarkable
descent of all warm-blooded ani
mals living in the water, the noted
paleontologist took up many of the
forms of mammals, which are now
the object of intense study by
those interested and proficient in
this work, concluding with a word
about reptiles such as the crocodile
and turtle.
