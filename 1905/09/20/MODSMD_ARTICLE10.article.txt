When the students of the Uni
versity trade with the merchants in
Palo Alto and the vicinity, it would
be a good plan to patronize the ones
that advertise in the various stu
dent periodicals. These men are
the ones who contribute in a degree
toward making these publications
possible, and in return the students
should give their trade to these
people, thus making an advertise
ment bring greater returns to the
person inserting it. In this way
advertising space in the college
publications will come to mean
more to the business man, and the
college will reap a benefit in that
there will be more advertising done,
and this branch of college activity
will prosper.
