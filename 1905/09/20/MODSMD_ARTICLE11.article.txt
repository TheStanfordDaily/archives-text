# STATION TO BE MOVED.
## Avenue Will Be Straightened, Giving a Better View of the University. 
### 
Sometime during the spring of
1906 the Southern Pacific depot at
Palo Alto is to be moved north
about 150 feet. At present the
depot is out of line with the
avenue from the University, and
the change is to lie made principal
ly to afford tourists and visitors a
better view of the University
buildings from the railroad. The
avenue will probably be straight
ened out directly to the new site,
and an extensive lawn will be laid
out around the station. By the
time this is completed the Alma
Street Improvement Club of Palo
Alto will have bettered the appear
ance of Alma street, and a more
favorable impression of both Palo
Alto and the University will be
made upon travelers.
No special additions will be made
to the station building itself, but
plans for a new depot are under
consideration now, and within
eighteen months the present build
ing will be torn down and a new
one built.
The new site is on the same side
of the track as the present one,
and is better and more convenient
in every way.
