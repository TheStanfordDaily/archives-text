### 
A. R. Sprague, president of the
California Fruit Exchange, lec
tured before the class in Economics
1 this morning. His subject was
"Co-operation in ihe California
Fruit Industry."
Mr. Sprague gave the history of
the various efforts which led up to
the organization of the Fruit Ex
change four years ago. He then
dtscribed ihe Htruggles and failures
of many of the sum ller associations
in their efforts to form a successful
combination against the buyers.
Mr. Sprague proceeded to sketch
the extent of the present associa
tion, which controls twenty million
dollars worth of fruit, out of a total
output of forty-eight millions.
The necessity for co-operative or
ganization is evident, both as
against the packers, who are con
stantly endeavoring to lower the
price, and against the destructive
competition among the growers
themselves. The thoughtlessness
of the growers, who do not realize
the value of the organization, has
caused a great deal of trouble and
distress, especially in the case of
the smaller farmers.
