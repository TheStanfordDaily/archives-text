# SENIOR ELECTION A TIE.
## Contest for Treasurer of '06 Still Undecided.â€”Eighty Votes Cast. 
### 
The second election for the office
of treasurer of the Senior Class was
held on ihe quad to-day, and re
sulted in one of the closest con
tests in the record of class elections,
ending in another tie for the posi
tion. E. C. Smith and W. Y.
Wentz were the contestants, and
after the eighty votes that were
cast had been counted it was found
that they were equally divided,
each candidate having forty votes
to his credit. To increase the
extraordinary closeness of the elec
tion, one vote was found that had
evidently been marked with con
siderable care exactly between the
two names printed on the ballot.
As it was impossible to decide the
election on the strength of this dis
puted ballot, it was declared a tie.
The committee in charge of the
election consisted of B. Matthews,
H. I. Cruzan, C. S. Osborne, L. A.
Henley, and P. B. Smith, chair
man.
The date for holding a third
election has not yet been decided
upon, but will be announced with
in the next few days.
