# New Rooters' Hats for California.
## 
### 
At Berkeley, dissatisfaction has
been expressed over the last year's
rooters' hats, and this season a new
style of hat will probably be putin
use. A blue hat blocked in a flat
shape and having a gold band en
circling the crown has been sub
mitted to the student body, but as
yet no action has been taken. A
plan to have rows of blue hats al
ternating with rows of gold hats
was also submitted.
E. L. Rust, one of the two yell
leaders at California, has an
nounced his intention of leaving
the university. After the end of
this week Walter De Leon, team
mate of Rust, will have full charge
of the rooting.
