# HARD PRACTICE BEGINS
## VARSITY SQUAD GIVEN SCRIMMAGE WORK LAST NIGHT. Freshman Candidates Are Taken to Baseball Field and Varsity Is Given Gridiron. 
### 
For the first time this season the
Varsity squad went through heavy
scrimmage work last night. Four
Varsity teams were lined up dur
ing the practice, and played for a
period of almost twenty min
utes.
As this is the first time the men
have lined up for heavy scrimmage
work, the showing indicated that
the players have profited from the
suggestions received in earlier prac
tices. While there was frequent
fumbling on the part of the backs
of the four elevens, there was a
marked uniformity of excellence in
the direction and execution of
plays. Considering that the work
yesterday was the first of the kind
this year, the men handled them
selves admirably.
The punting was first-class
throughout, and showed clearly
that in this part of the game Stan
ford will have men of better calibre
than in preceding years. Assistant-
Coach Pansbach, during the last
half of the hour, carefully instruct
ed them in a series of signal plays.
Toward the end of practice the men
were divided into elevens and pit
ted against each other in a light
scrimmage.
Before the squads were separated
and scrimmage work begun, the
men were given further prelimi
nary coaching in the rudiments of
football. It is Lanagan's pol
icy to thoroughly ground the
men in the first principles
of the game, so that progress
may be more rapid when the men
are given the heavier work. In
pursuance of this plan the players
were instructed again in the earlier
part of the afternoon in falling on
the ball and running down on
punts.
Before the Freshmen went to the
baseball field they were taught a
few principles of the kick-off, and
were given an opportunity to show
what they could do both on the
offensive and defensive. This proved
very beneficial, for many of the
men who are new at the game
showed themselves to be unfamiliar
with judging distance, both in
handling the ball and in going
down the field after the runner.
The ball was kicked off as in a re
gular game, and then returned as
far as possible. Upon the first
down the teams changed sides, and
the ball was again kicked off.
G. F. Shaner, '07, and L. Good
ell, '09, who is suffering from blood
poisoning, were not on the field
last night. Goodell will probably
be able to resume work in a week.
J. F. Brennan, '07, substitute right
tackle last year, appeared on the
field in football suit yesterday for
the first time this season. G. W.
Smith, '06, who was out on the field
last week, has decided not to return
to college this fall. He left the Uni
versity today.
