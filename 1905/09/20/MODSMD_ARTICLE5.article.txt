# CHESS OUTLOOK BRIGHT
## LARGE NUMBER OF OLD PLAYERS HAVE RETURNED. Meeting Will Be Held Friday to Organize.â€”Tournaments to Determine Membership to Begin. 
### 
This year four of the men who
played a tie with the University of
California chess team last April
have returned to college, and the
prospects for a winning team are
much brighter than they have been
for several years. F. P. Whitaker,
'05, E. W. Doane, '05, and M. M.
Stearns, '06, are the three men of
last year's team who are not in
college, but it is probable that
Stearns will return. All were good
players; but with the majority of
the team back to form a nucleus
for this year, a strong aggregation
should he collected to play against
California.
The four men of last year's team
are 11. A. Fuller, '05, L. Newland,
'08, G. E. Dole, '07, and H. W.
Strong, '06. These men have all
played in Varsity chess tourna
ments, and are wearers of the Stan
ford chess pin. F. E. Ulrich, '06,
an old Varsity player, has also re
turned this year. Other members
of the Chess Club who have re
turned to the University and will
try for places on the chess team
are J. F. Cassell, '07, C. E. Spauld
ing, '06, T. R. W. F. Figg-Hoblyn,
'08, C. I. Chandler, '08, H. R.
Thomas, '07, and R. S. Woods,
'07.
Many of these men came close to
making the team last year, and it is
understood that there are several
strong chess players in the entering
class.
The first meeting of the men in
terested in chess will be held Fri
day at 1:15 in the chapel, when
definite arrangements will be made
for carrying on the fall tourna
ment and for holding meetings
during the year. The fall tourna
ment will continue until December
and will decide who are eligible to
the club this year. The member
bership of the club is limited to
fourteen, and all members of prev
ious clubs are required to try out
except Varsity players.
Next semester the members of
the team will hold a tournament
to determine the personnel of the
team that will contest with the
University of California. This
team consists of seven men, and the
winner of the tournament is given
the title of University Chess Cha
mpion. Last year this title was held
by H W. Strong, '06. All mem
bers of the team will receive the
regulation chess pins from the stu
dent body.
In order to stimulate interest in
this game and to aid in developing
better players for the team, ar
rangements will be made with the
best chess players on the Coast for
a series of exhibition games to be
played under the auspices of the
club.
For three consecutive years the
chess tournaments with the Uni
versity of California have resulted
in tie scores.
