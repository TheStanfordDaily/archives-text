# BERKELEY HIGH WINS
## FRESHMEN DEFEATED YESTERDAY BY SCORE OF 6-0. Both Teams Play Ragged Ball and Lose on Fumbles.—Freshmen Inferior Save in Punting. 
### 
By the score of 6 to 0 the Fresh
men lost their first preliminary
game, and only the listless playing
of the Berkeley High School play
era prevented a larger score. The
intense heat which prevailed pre
vented fast, aggressive playing, and
both teams were forced to punt fre
quently. At this department of the
game the Freshmen were clearly
superior to their rivals, hut in line
bucking and team-work the pre
paratory school players outclassed
their adversaries.
The line-up of the teams was as

Time of halves, 15 minutes each-
Officials: Linscott, Berkeley High,
referee; Paul Tarpey, ex-'O5, um
pire; Rook, '06, and Stott, '07,
linesmen; Hickey, '09, timekeeper.
The sole brilliant feature of an
otherwise uninteresting game was
a beautifully executed place-kick
made from the 25-yard line by So
linsky of the high school eleven.
With only five minutes left to plav,
Berkeley secured the hall by a
fumble on the Stanford 25-yard
line almost directly in line with
the goal-posts. Solinsky dropped
back for a place-kick, and booted
the ball squarely between the goal
posts and high above the cross
bar.
The team-work of the representa
tives of 1909 was very poor, and
their persistent fumbling could
only be excused on the plea of
lack of practice. The various men
who were tried out in the back
field showed a fair knowledge of

the game, but the line men did not
show up so well. The Freshmen
were handicapped to a considerable
extent, by being limited to only
four plays, which the high school
team soon learned to block.
Very little time was taken out
on account of injuries, which were
all of a minor character, and the
game was not marred hy any un
pleasant features.
No scoring was done in the first
half, but in the second period
Berkeley made a safety and a field
goal, netting six points.
Solinsky kicked off for Berkeley
High in the first half and sent the
ball to the 5-yard line; from there
it was returned 10 yards by Hol
man. Ellis punted 25 yards on
the first down, and it was returned
for a distance of 10 yards. After a
series of three bucks by Berkeley,
Terrill secured the ball on a
fumble. Ellis punted a second
time on first down for 30 yards,
Miller fumbling the ball, and So
linsky being downed after a gain
of two yards. Another fumble by
the high school team lost the ball
to the Freshmen, Stolz having
fallen on the ball. On the third
down, with two yards to gain, Ellis
punted 35 yards out of bounds, 2
yards from Freshman goal-line.
The ball was moved 10 yards into
field for convenience, and the high
school punted 30 yards, which Hol
man brought hack 5 yards. Ter
rill was sent through the line for
several bucks, making first down.
Terrill then went through tackle
for 5 yards. Two more bucks
netted 3 yards, and Terrill was
pushed through for the required
yards. Cobb substituted for John
son at right tackle, the only change
in the first half. Score 0-0.
An entirely new Freshman team
lined up in the second half, and a
large number of the squad were
given a chance before the contest
was over.
Doane kicked off for the Freshmen
in the second half to the 10-yard
line, where Beck secured the ball
and ran it in for 15 yards. Three
bucks netted only 2yards, compell
ing the high school team to punt.
Solinsky kicked 35 yards, of which
5 yards was lost on a return by
McDuffie. McDuffie punted on the
first down for 30 yards to Miller,
who fumbled the ball, recovered it
and returned it 2 yards. Beck
gained 4 yards, and Mathews made
it first down. Peck made 3 yards,
after which a cross-buck was tried.
Mathews gained only 1 yard. The
Freshmen were penalized 5 yards
for being off side. A cross-buck
for 3 yards by Mathews was fol
lowed by a straight buck by Peck,
who fumbled and lost the ball.
Only 2 yards was made by the
Freshmen on two bucks, whereupon
McDuffie punted 25 yards out of
bounds. Berkeley High School
made first down, followed by a 12-
vard gain through the line hy
Stutt. Solinsky succeeded in plac
ing the ball 2 yards nearer the
goal-line. On the next play Mil
ler fumbled, Stutt recovered the
ball and gained 3 yards. Mathews
made yards on first down, and
3on the next buck. McCarty was
substituted for Mathews here and
