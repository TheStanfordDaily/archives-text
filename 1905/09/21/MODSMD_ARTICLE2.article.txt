# TRACK MEN ORGANIZE
## MEETING LAST NIGHT FOR FALL TRAINING. Over One Hundred Men Sign Roll for Cross-Country Running and Track Work. 
### 
Fall track training was inaugu
rated last night by the largest and
most enihusiatic meeting ever held
by the track men at this time of
the year. The meeting was for the
purpose of making plans for fall
work on the track and also to con
sider the best methods for institut
ing cross-country running. ''Dad"
Moulton and Captain J. C. Mac
farland made short speeches, and
several of the old track men added
a few words of advice and encour
agement. Over a hundred men
signed either for track work or
cross-country running.
Captain Macfarland opened the
meeting with a short speech, in
which he said: "This is the best at
tended and most enthusiastic meet
ing of this kind that 1 have ever
seen, and it shows that there will be
plenty of interest in track this fall.
The point which I want to impress
upon you is that everybody should
come out —especially Freshmen.
We need plenty of material to work
with. In regard to the cross-coun
try running, I think it will be first
rate work for all distance men, and
all men who want to take up this
work should report at the track
Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.
Strict training rules will not go in
to effect at once, but all the men
who sign for training are expected
to get out every day and do some
work."
"Dad" Moulton then gave a lit
tle talk, the main part of which
was as follows: "I am glad to see
so many fellows here to start with,
and the great idea this year is to
get new men out. We know what
the old men can do and we know
that they are coming out, but we
want lots of new men. I can tell
you of plenty of new men who have
made good their first year, and
every Freshman should come out
and try. The first thing to do is
to keep up your college work and
then track comes next."
H. W. Bell, '06, Varsity track
captain last year, made a speech in
which he expressed his satisfaction
at seeing so many men out; and he
urged the men to do good work in
the fall, as then they would be
ready for the harder training in the
spring. W. E. Crawford, '06, Var
sity track man for the past four
years, made a short talk in which
he urged every Freshman to come
out and try, and to stay with it; and
if he kept training rules and fol
lowed the instructions of the train
er and captain there is no reason
why he should not make good. L.
M. Edwards, '07, L. G. Russell, '06,
and H. L. Horton, '08, each gave a
talk encouraging the new men to
come out and work, and also ex
pressing their confidence in the out
look for a Stanford victory next
spring.
Work will begin on the track to
day, and the first cross-country run

will be taken Saturday morning,
when the men will cover about two
miles. The complete list of those
who signed for fall training is as
