The unfortunate developments
growing out of the dismissal of.l)r.
Julius Goebel from the University
must he regretted hy everyone.
That it should have heen found
essential to the best interests of the
University to call for the resigna
tion of so distinguished a scholar
as Dr Goebel is a matter for sor
row; that a long and hitter public
controversy should follow the en
forced resignation is equally a
matter for regret. The action of
Harvard in appointing Dr. Goebel
to an important post does, in a
manner, place Stanford University
on the defensive, and the brunt of
the trouble falls upon the shoul
ders of President David Starr Jor
dan.
A reflection upon its President
is a reflection upon the University,
and a shadow upon the University
falls also upon the men and women
who are its students. These men
and women, therefore, must give
full thought to the situation, and
there are many things they must
keep in mind.
Dealing specifically with the
Goebel affair, let it ha kept, dis
tinctly in mind that the accused
educator received a hearing before
nine of the oldest and ablest mem
bers of the faculty, men chosen hy
their associates for their clear
sightedness and conservatism
Meeting in executive session and
beyond outside influences, these
men gave full consideration to the
charges, heard and gave Dr. Goebel
every opportunity to defend him
self, and yet decided against him.
The action of President Jordan did
little more than confirm what Dr.
Goebel's associates of many years
had decreed. Those who know the
high character of these men, many
of them of national reputation,
will question neither the motive
nor the justice of the decision. If
the publication of the evidence

given before the advisory board
should ever be forced, the support
ers of the University may fee]
assured that in it will be found
ample justification for their faith.
