# EMERSON TO LECTURE
## WAR CORRESPONDENT TO SPEAK IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Faculty Entertainment Committee Arranges for Illustrated Talk by Well-known Newspaper Man. 
### 
On Tuesday evening, September
26th, Mr. Edwin Emerson, the dis
tinguished war correspondent, will
lecture under the auspices of the
Faculty Music Committee, his sub
ject being ''The Inside Story of
Port Arthur's Siege and Capitula
tion," which will be illustrated by
a set of one hundred and twenty
lantern-slides, prepared from pho
tographs taken by the speaker him
self and other war correspondents.
Mr. Emerson is perhaps the best
known of present day newspaper
correspondents, and he undoubted
ly achieved the greatest success of
all the war correspondents during
the late Russo-Japanese war.
As a newspaper man he achieved
his first important success during
the Spanish War, which he fol
lowed in the interests of Leslie's
Weekly. While the island of Por
to Rico was still in the hands of
the enemy, Emerson succeeded in
making his way across it, thereby
gaining much information which
was of value to the American army
in the campaign which followed.
During this trip he was once cap
tured by the Spanish, but the flu
ency with which he spoke German
convinced his captors that he was
not an American spy, and he was
released. Later he joined Roose
velt's Rough Riders and served
with them at San Juan and Santi
ago. For distinguished services on
these occasions he was made a colo
nel, and received in addition a high
tribute for gallantry in service from
his distinguished commander.
At the outbreak of the Russo-
Japanese war Mr. Emerson sailed
for Japan, intending to go to the
front; but after reaching Corea he
found that he would not be per
mitted to observe active operations.
He then decided to join the Russian
ranks, and in accomplishing this
he was forced to break through the
outposts of both armies, during
which time he was fired upon and
reported killed. As a matter of
fact, however, he was captured by
the Russians, and served as war
correspondent within their lines.
Later he ran the blockade into
Port Arthur, where he remained
for some time, but was finally ex
pelled and captured by the Jap
anese, who, after six weeks, releas
ed him on parole.
Since his return to this country
Mr. Emerson has been very success
ful as a lecturer, his knowledge of
the conditions as they existed being
especially broad, on account of the
fact that he served with both ar
mies,a privilege not enjoyed by any
other American correspondent.
