During the football game to
morrow afternoon it should be
borne in mind that the place for
all persons whose business does not
require them to be upon the field
is upon the bleachers. People
straggling along the side-lines
bother the players and coaches, as
well as the rooters, and they should
not be tolerated.
Another nuisance of the same
character is the gathering of idlers
around the rubbing-shed who pes
ter the men with questions and are
always in the way. They should
also be shown their place on the
bleachers and be made to stay
there.
