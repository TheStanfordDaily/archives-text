# Slow to Order Hats.
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that all or
ders for Junior plugs must be in
by to-morrow night in order to be
filled, comparatively few members
of the class have given their names
to the committee in charge. This

year the hats will again he ordered
in the East, as was done by the
Junior class of last year. The
plugs will cost five cents less this
time, the price heing ninety-five
cents, while a dollar was paid last
fall. Those Juniors who have not
ordered plugs should hand their
names to J. C. Macfarland, G. J.
Presley, or L. M. Edwards before
to-morrow night.
