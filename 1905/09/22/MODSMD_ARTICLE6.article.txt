# FIRST VARSITY GAME
## INITIAL BIG GAME OF SEASON TO-MORROW AFTERNOON. Opponents Will Be Eleven from St. Vincent's College, Los Angeles. 
### 
The Varsity football season will
be opened to-morrow in a game
with the team from St. Vincent's
College, Los Angele√ü. The game
will be called promptly at 2:30,
and twenty-minute halves will be
played.
The men arrived this morning,
and were met at the station by
Manager Barrett and escorted to
the campus, where they are being
entertained at the various fraterni
ty houses and in Encina Hall. The
team consists of sixteen men be
sides Coach Haggerty.
The personnel of the Catholic
team consists of a number of ex
perienced men. The back field
presents a formidable appearance
with Acker, Cunningham and Mc-
Elroy. The eleven from the south
has had but a week's practice, and
the game to-morrow will indicate
the strength of our team in a small
measure, for the Varsity has also
practiced only one week.
Head-Coach Lanagan will play
a large number of Varsity candi
dates in to-morrow's struggle, and
this game will afford the coaches
an opportunity to see what the men
can do, as the four teams will be
given a chance during the contest.
