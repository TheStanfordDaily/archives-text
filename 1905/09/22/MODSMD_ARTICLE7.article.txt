# HEAVY SCRIMMAGE WORK.
## Varsity Squad Shows Up Well In Practice.—Freshmen Improve Slowly. 
### 
It will he two weekß on Monday
since the first football practice, and
as far as the Varsity squad is con
cerned, marked improvement is
noticeable. The Freshmen seem to
have a difficult time with the ele
mentary principles of the game,
and do not show the improvement
that the candidates for the Varsity
have.
The Freshman squad was taken
to the baseball field last night and
given signal practice after the Var
sity teams lined up for scrimmage.

During the first half of the hour
the Freshmen were lined up alter
nately for punting and light scrim
mage practice. After the squad
had received special instruction in
this part of the game, the men were
divided into three sections: two
practiced catching the ball and
lunging forward a few steps, while
the third section tackled the dum
my.
The Varsity squad devoted half
of the afternoon's practice to catch
ing the ball, running down on
punts, and tackling the dummy;
and then four teams were lined up
for two short scrimmage periods.
While the first two teams were en
gaged in scrimmage work the rest
of the squad was stationed on the
side-lines near by, so that they
might watch every play and bene
fit by Lanagan's coaching.
A large number of men are show
ing up splendidly, and the willing
ness and vim which characterizes
the play of the Freshmen on the
Varsity squad in a measure atones
for the apathy prevailing in the
regular Freshman squad.
