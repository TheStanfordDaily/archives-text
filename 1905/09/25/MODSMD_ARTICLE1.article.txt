St. Vincent's; linesmen, Hickey,

Time of halves, 15 minutes each.
Weather conditions were favor
able for fast work, but both teams
showed a lack of practice which
prevented swift formations. Fum
bling was a serious fault of the
players who represented Stanford
in the first half, but in the second
period there was a noticeable im
provement in this part of the game.
St. Vincent lost many yards in
penalties for off-side plays, and
Coach Haggerty, who played left
tackle for his team, was the chief
offender.
Many of the eleven who played
in the back-fielcT'ehowed that they
are distinct Varsity possibilities,
and there is every indication that
these positions will be closely con
tested. In the line the players did
not show the same form as the
back-field candidates, and with
possibly four exceptions the play
ing of the line men was not above
mediocre. Only two of the numer
ous candidates for the vacant end
positions showed more than ordi
nary promise by their performances
in Saturday's contest.
The game was not spectacular,
although at times there was some
brilliant line bucking and end run
ning. The contest was unduly pro
longed by disputes over contested
points.
For the visiting team Coach
Haggerty played a brilliant but
erratic game. Acker at half-back
and Irvine at end did excellent
work for the Los Angeles eleven.
The detail plays which follow
show how Stanford's touch-downs
were made.
The second half opened with
Stanford on the offensive. Acker
kicked off to the 25-yard line,
where the runner was downed in
his tracks. A fumble on the first
play was recovered and netted 10
yards for Stanford. Chalmers ad
vanced the ball 8 yards through
right tackle, followed by a buck
through center for 2 yards more.
Packard gained 3 yards, and on
the first down was sent through
tackle for another gain of three
yards. An end run by Chalmers
was stopped by Murietta, but the
required distance was made in two
downs, which was followed by a
straight buck of 3 yards by Chal
mers. On a tackle-back play Cox
lost half a yard. Chalmers was
sent through center for 4 yards,
followed by Thompson for the
same distance. A fumble was re
covered by Stanford, and on the
next play Haggerty being off-side
Stanford received 5 yards. Pack
ard made 3 yards, and two tackle
back plays netted 5 yards. Chal
mers was sent through on a
straight buck for 4 yards, and
Brennan was pushed forward for
another four yards, leaving the
ball 2i yards from the goal-line.
Slusher failed to decrease the dis
tance, after which Chalmers was
sent through for the first touch
down of the season. Fenton missed
the goal. Score 5-0.
Stanford kicked off, but the ball
rolled out of bounds on the 30-yard
line. On the second attempt Fen
ton kicked it 45 yards. St. Vin
cent's made their yards several
times and were then forced to punt.
Chalmers returned the ball 5 yards
and was then sent through for a
gain of 11 yards in 3 downs. Stan
ford received 5 yards for an off-side
play -by Haggerty. Two bucks
added yards, and Chalmers
made 5 yards more through left
tackle. On the first down there
was a confusion in signals and
Fenton was downed without gain.
Blow advanced the ball 3 yards,
and Chalmers made it first down.
Gay made 9 yards on a tackle
back play, and Chalmers added 11
yards more through left tackle
and this was followed by a third
for 5 additional yards.
With the ball half a yard
from the goal-line, Chalmers was

sent through left tackle for a touch
down two successive times. Upon
protest by Coach Haggerty, Head-
Coach Lanagan insisted that the
play be repeated, although Referee
Erskine allowed the touch-down
each time. Lanagan directed
Laumeister to send the play
through the same place and again
Chalmers was carried over. An
other protest ensued, which result-

Ed in the play being tried over and
Vandervoort was pushed through
right tackle for the touch-down
that was allowed. Blow missed the
goal. Score 10-0.
During the few remaining min
utes of play St. Vincent's did some
spectacular end running and the
game ended with the ball in their
possession on the Stanford 40-yard
line.

keepers, Dr. Angell, and Garvey,
St. Vincent's; linesmen, Hickey,
'08, and Campbell, St. Vincent's.
Time of halves, 15 minutes each.
Weather conditions were favor
able for fast work, but both teams
showed a lack of practice which
prevented swift formations. Fum
bling was a serious fault of the
players who represented Stanford
in the first half, but in the second
period there was a noticeable im
provement in this part of the game.
St. Vincent lost many yards in
penalties for off-side plays, and
Coach Haggerty, who played left
tackle for his team, was the chief
offender.
Many of the eleven who played
in the back-fielcT'ehowed that they
are distinct Varsity possibilities,
and there is every indication that
these positions will be closely con
tested. In the line the players did
not show the same form as the
back-field candidates, and with
possibly four exceptions the play
ing of the line men was not above
mediocre. Only two of the numer
ous candidates for the vacant end
positions showed more than ordi
nary promise by their performances
in Saturday's contest.
The game was not spectacular,
although at times there was some
brilliant line bucking and end run
ning. The contest was unduly pro
longed by disputes over contested
points.
For the visiting team Coach
Haggerty played a brilliant but
erratic game. Acker at half-back
and Irvine at end did excellent
work for the Los Angeles eleven.
The detail plays which follow
show how Stanford's touch-downs
were made.
The second half opened with
Stanford on the offensive. Acker
kicked off to the 25-yard line,
where the runner was downed in
his tracks. A fumble on the first
play was recovered and netted 10
yards for Stanford. Chalmers ad
vanced the ball 8 yards through
right tackle, followed by a buck
through center for 2 yards more.
Packard gained 3 yards, and on
the first down was sent through
tackle for another gain of three
yards. An end run by Chalmers
was stopped by Murietta, but the
required distance was made in two
downs, which was followed by a
straight buck of 3 yards by Chal
mers. On a tackle-back play Cox
lost half a yard. Chalmers was
sent through center for 4 yards,
followed by Thompson for the
same distance. A fumble was re
covered by Stanford, and on the
next play Haggerty being off-side
Stanford received 5 yards. Pack
ard made 3 yards, and two tackle
back plays netted 5 yards. Chal
mers was sent through on a
straight buck for 4 yards, and
Brennan was pushed forward for
another four yards, leaving the
ball 2i yards from the goal-line.
Slusher failed to decrease the dis
tance, after which Chalmers was
sent through for the first touch
down of the season. Fenton missed
the goal. Score 5-0.
Stanford kicked off, but the ball
rolled out of bounds on the 30-yard
line. On the second attempt Fen
ton kicked it 45 yards. St. Vin
cent's made their yards several
times and were then forced to punt.
Chalmers returned the ball 5 yards
and was then sent through for a
gain of 11 yards in 3 downs. Stan
ford received 5 yards for an off-side
play -by Haggerty. Two bucks
added yards, and Chalmers
made 5 yards more through left
tackle. On the first down there
was a confusion in signals and
Fenton was downed without gain.
Blow advanced the ball 3 yards,
and Chalmers made it first down.
Gay made 9 yards on a tackle
back play, and Chalmers added 11
yards more through left tackle
and this was followed by a third
for 5 additional yards.
With the ball half a yard
from the goal-line, Chalmers was

sent through left tackle for a touch
down two successive times. Upon
protest by Coach Haggerty, Head-
Coach Lanagan insisted that the
play be repeated, although Referee
Erskine allowed the touch-down
each time. Lanagan directed
Laumeister to send the play
through the same place and again
Chalmers was carried over. An
other protest ensued, which result-

Ed in the play being tried over and
Vandervoort was pushed through
right tackle for the touch-down
that was allowed. Blow missed the
goal. Score 10-0.
During the few remaining min
utes of play St. Vincent's did some
spectacular end running and the
game ended with the ball in their
possession on the Stanford 40-yard
line.
In a ragged game of football the
Varsity defeated the eleven from
St. Vincent's College by the score
of 10 to 0 on the campus gridiron
Saturday afternoon. Both touch
downs were made in the second
half, and each time the try for
goal failed.
