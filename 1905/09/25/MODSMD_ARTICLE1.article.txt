# ST. VINCENT DEFEATED
## VARSITY SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS ON SOUTHERN TEAM. Many Candidates on Football Squad Given an Opportunity to Play Saturday. 
### 
In a ragged game of football the
Varsity defeated the eleven from
St. Vincent's College by the score
of 10 to 0 on the campus gridiron
Saturday afternoon. Both touch
downs were made in the second
half, and each time the try for
goal failed.

keepers, Dr. Angell, and Garvey,

'08, and Campbell, St. Vincent's.
Time of halves, 15 minutes each.
Weather conditions were favor
able for fast work, but both teams
showed a lack of practice which
prevented swift formations. Fum
bling was a serious fault of the
players who represented Stanford
in the first half, but in the second
period there was a noticeable im
provement in this part of the game.
St. Vincent lost many yards in
penalties for off-side plays, and
Coach Haggerty, who played left
tackle for his team, was the chief
offender.
Many of the eleven who played
in the back-fielcT'ehowed that they
are distinct Varsity possibilities,
and there is every indication that
these positions will be closely con
tested. In the line the players did
not show the same form as the
back-field candidates, and with
possibly four exceptions the play
ing of the line men was not above
mediocre. Only two of the numer
ous candidates for the vacant end
