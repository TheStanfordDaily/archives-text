Fall baseball practice at Stan
ford during past years has been
held late in the fall, but aside from
the fact that this has been the cus
tom in the past, every argument
points to the fact that practice
early in the fall would be more
beneficial. The weather conditions
during the latter part of the semes
ter are unfavorable for baseball.
Practice is irregular on account of
the diamond being continually in
a mushy condition. The players
go slipping and sliding around, not
obtaining half the benefit were the
ground dry. The air is frequently
cold, and this causes the men to
have trouble with their arms, or at
least they are prevented from do
ing any vigorous throwing to bases.
Another factor which renders the
later part of the fall as undesirable
is the fact that practice is kept up
until almost the very last day of
the semester, long after fall track
work has been finished. Practice
continuing so late interferes with
the players in their preparations
for the final examinations, and
also reduces the size of the squad,
for many men do not come out, or
quit early, for this very reason.
If the fall baseball practice
would start now and continue un
til the end of October or the middle
of November, it would do away with
these objections. The weather is
right now, final examinations will
not trouble the players, the dia
mond is in good condition, and the
greatest benefit would be derived
from the work. A possible objec
tion is that fall baseball practice
would interfere with footbal I. This
objection, however, lacks weight.
Of the eight Varsity baseball men
in college, five, including the cap
tain, are not upon the football field.
These men could handle the squad
in an able manner. The majority:
of second team baseball men are
not upon the football field. Base-1
ball practice could be held so as j

not to interfere with the football
games. The number of men that
it would takeoff the bleachers from
football practice would be relative
ly small, and as baseball practice
would not take place every after
noon this would not prove serious.
Stanford has been beaten for so
long in baseball that every possible
advantage should be taken. Every
condition is favorable to starting
fall practice at once and getting
some real benefit from the work.
