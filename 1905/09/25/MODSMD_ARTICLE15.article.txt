# SUNDAY MORNING SERVICE.
## Rev. Earl Wilbur of Oakland Speaks in the Memorial Church. 
### 
The Rev. Earl Wilbur, dean of
the School of Liberal Theology, of
Oakland, was the preacher at both
services in the Memorial Church
yesterday. The text for the morn
ing service was the forty-fifth verse
of the sixth chapter of Luke. "A
good man out of the good treasure
of his heart bringeth forth that
which is good; and an evil man
out of the evil treasures of his heart
bringeth forth that which is evil."
Dr. Wilbur said in part:
"The character of our lives de
pends on the content of heart and
mind. In order to live well, we
must consider carefully what we
are to believe. We commonly
make the mistake of thinking that
the desire to do right is sufficient,
and we let our thoughts care for
themselves. Frequently we are
inclined to excuse our wrongdoing
on the ground of heredity and en
vironment. This may be true to
a limited extent, but these inherent
traits influence us only as we open
the doors of our minds, and unlock
the secret chambers of our hearts.
Responsibility for evil must rest
with the individual, who has sole
control of his secret thoughts. On
the other hand, good thoughts and
impulses strengthen Hie good
actions of our lives. The rule is
the same, the only difference lying
in the application of the formula,
which makes the signs positive now
instead of negative. Let a man
think good, pure, thoughts all the
time, and his life will inevitably
be pure and good, noble and just.
For no man can be clean within
and false without.
"The mind is master of the body,
and the source and center of active
life is within. If you would realize
your ideals rely not on external
restraint, but on internal purity
and force of character, and as in
evitably will come success and
happiness as does beauty to the
rose."
