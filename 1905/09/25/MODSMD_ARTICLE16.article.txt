# Sacred Concerts to Be Given.
## 
### 
Beginning with next Sunday,
October Ist, the regular afternoon
service in the Memorial Church
will be .suspended on the first Sun
day of the remaining months of
tliis semester, and in its place will
be substituted a sacred concert, to be
given at 8 o'clock in the evening.
At these concerts the choir, under
the direction of Dr. Blodgett, will
render selections from the various
oratorios of the great masters.
This change is to be tried merely
as an experiment in accession to
repeated requests, and the plan
will be continued next term should
it prove successful this semester.
