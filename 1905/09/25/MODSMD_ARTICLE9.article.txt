# LECTURE TO-MORROW
## EMERSON WILL SPEAK IN ASSEMBLY HALL. "Inside Story of Port Arthur's Siege and Capitulation," Reproduced by Slides. 
### 
The University community will
have the opportunity to-morrow
night of hearing a lecture on the
late Russo-Japanese struggle in the
Far East which will undoubtedly
equal in interest any now being
given on that subject. Edwin
Emerson, who closely followed the
campaigns of both armies during
the war in the capacity of news
paper correspondent, will be the
speaker.
The specific subject of Mr. Emer
son's lecture will be "The Inside
Story of Port Arthur's Siege and
Capitulation," illustrated by a ser
ies of one hundred and twenty lan
tern slides reproduced from photo
graphs actually taken by the cor
respondent himself and his asso
ciates.
Because of the extreme rarity
and excellence of his pictures, it is
conceded that they are the most in
teresting feature of the lectures.
The pictures illustrating the sub
ject were actually taken inside the
walls of Port Arthur during the
siege, and are the only views of
their kind extant, for the photo
grapher, Clemens Limdpainter of
the Novi Krai, was the only photo
grapher whom General Stoessel per
mitted to remain in the fortress
during the siege.
Just as rare and authentic are
the views illustrating events from
the Japanese lines during the siege,
for Mr. Emerson has the photo
graphs of battles taken by the mili
tary photographers of the Japan
ese staff while in the field,
which were exclusively furnished
him by General Murata, a high
officer in the Japanese army.
As far as acquaintance with the
events of the struggle is concerned,
no one can have had a more varied
personal experience than the lect
urer. In the course of his shifting
from one army to the other he was
taken prisoner by both the Rus
sians and Japanese, being sum
moned at different times before
General Nogi, Admiral Togo, and
General Stoessel.
