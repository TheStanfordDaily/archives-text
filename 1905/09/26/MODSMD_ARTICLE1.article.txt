# SCHOLARSHIP POLICY
## ACADEMIC COUNCIL REVISES COMMITTEE REGULATIONS. Status of Students Delinquent in Scholarship Fully Defined by New Rulings. 
### 
The Academic Council at a meet
ing held May 10, 1905, adopted the
nine regulations, published below,
which make up a statement of the
revised policy of the Committee on
Scholarship. The articles cover de
linquency in scholarship and out
line the status of students who
have been forced to withdraw from
the University or who have been
placed on probation on account of
such delinquency. Applications
for leaves of absence are also de
fined with regard to the time and
conditions under which they may
be taken out.
Clause eight, which concerns stu
dents on probation, absolutely pro
hibits any such student from repre
senting the University in connec
tion with any athletic, literary,
musical, dramatic or other organi
zation. This is important, as it
states absolutely the attitude of the
University authorities toward those
students who permit their interest
in student body affairs to affect
their standing in scholarship.
The remainder of the articles are
well known as regards their gen
eral application, hut this is the
first time that the full text of these
regulations has been made public.
The statement of the committee
follows:
It is the policy of the committee
to exclude from the University stu
dents who fail to do the work for
which they are registered. The
cases which come before the com
mittee are considered individually
and are so varied in their nature
and conditions that no inflexible
rules can be followed. On the one
hand, questions of illness or other
inability must be taken into ac
count; on the other hand, the
judgment of the committee is modi
fied by past records for consistently
low grade of work.
The following regulations are
subject therefore to such modifica
tions in special cases as may be
determined by the committee:
1. At the end of his first semes
ter a student who is delinquent in
scholarship shall receive official
Warning of the unsatisfactory na
ture of his work, and shall be
placed on probation for the second
semester; but if his failure has in
volved two-thirds or more of the
work for which he is registered, the
warning shall be waived, and he
shall be required to withdraw from
the University for the following se
mester.
2. During all semesters subse
quent to the first, students who fail
to obtain passing grades in two
thirds of the work for which they
are registered, shall be required to
withdraw from the University for
the period of one semester.
3. Students re-entering the Uni
versity after compulsory with
drawal because of scholarship may
take tests to remove "incompletes"
or "conditions" incurred during
the last semester, but no credit will
be granted for any other work ac
complished during the period of
suspension, except after removal of
incompletes and conditions and on
special examination by the depart
ment* concerned. They Hhall be
placed on probation for one semes
ter. In case of a second failure,
they shall be required to withdraw
permanently from the University,
unless, under extraordinary con
ditions, a further trial may appear
advisable.
4. During the period of compul
sory withdrawal from the Univer
sity students shall not attend Uni
versity exercises, nor remain in
residence Ht the University except
by special permission of the Com
mittee on Delinquent Scholarship.
5 Mid-semester reports on schol
arship shall be obtained from all
instructors, and students shall be
notified of their delinquencies.
6 Students doing unsatisfactory
work may be placed on probation
at any time. When the probation
is continued from one semester to
the next, students shall receive no
tice to that effect. Students on
probation may be required to with
draw at any time.
7. A tirst application for leave of
absence for the remainder of any
collegiate year will not be refused
on the ground of delinquent schol
arship; but a student seriously de
ficient in scholarship at the time of
taking such leave will be placed on
probation on returning to the Uni
versity and a subsequent compul
sory withdrawal will be permanent.
No credit will be given for work
done during the semester in which
leave of absence is taken. Appli
cation for leave of absence under
the above conditions will not be
granted during the last six weeks
of the second semester; nor at any
time to students who have been
previously under suspension on ac
count of delinquent scholarship.
8. Students on probation shall
not take part in any intercollegi
ate contest, nor represent the Uni
versity in any way, whether indi
vidually or in connection with any
athletic, literary, musical dra
matic, or other organization.
9. When students are delinquent
in scholarship the fact shall be
communicated to their parents or
guardian.

The Academic Council at a meet
ing held May 10, 1905, adopted the
nine regulations, published below,
which make up a statement of the
revised policy of the Committee on
Scholarship. The articles cover de
linquency in scholarship and out
line the status of students who
have been forced to withdraw from
the University or who have been
placed on probation on account of
such delinquency. Applications
for leaves of absence are also de
fined with regard to the time and
conditions under which they may
be taken out.
Clause eight, which concerns stu
dents on probation, absolutely pro
hibits any such student from repre
senting the University in connec
tion with any athletic, literary,
musical, dramatic or other organi
zation. This is important, as it
states absolutely the attitude of the
University authorities toward those
students who permit their interest
in student body affairs to affect
their standing in scholarship.
The remainder of the articles are
well known as regards their gen
eral application, hut this is the
first time that the full text of these
regulations has been made public.
The statement of the committee
follows:
It is the policy of the committee
to exclude from the University stu
dents who fail to do the work for
which they are registered. The
cases which come before the com
mittee are considered individually
and are so varied in their nature
and conditions that no inflexible
rules can be followed. On the one
hand, questions of illness or other
inability must be taken into ac
count; on the other hand, the
judgment of the committee is modi
fied by past records for consistently
low grade of work.
The following regulations are
subject therefore to such modifica
tions in special cases as may be
determined by the committee:
1. At the end of his first semes
ter a student who is delinquent in
scholarship shall receive official
Warning of the unsatisfactory na
ture of his work, and shall be
placed on probation for the second
semester; but if his failure has in
volved two-thirds or more of the
work for which he is registered, the
warning shall be waived, and he
shall be required to withdraw from
the University for the following se
mester.
2. During all semesters subse
quent to the first, students who fail
to obtain passing grades in two
thirds of the work for which they
are registered, shall be required to
withdraw from the University for
the period of one semester.
3. Students re-entering the Uni
versity after compulsory with
drawal because of scholarship may
take tests to remove "incompletes"
or "conditions" incurred during
the last semester, but no credit will
be granted for any other work ac
complished during the period of
suspension, except after removal of
incompletes and conditions and on
special examination by the depart
ment* concerned. They Hhall be
placed on probation for one semes
ter. In case of a second failure,
they shall be required to withdraw
permanently from the University,
unless, under extraordinary con
ditions, a further trial may appear
advisable.
4. During the period of compul
sory withdrawal from the Univer
sity students shall not attend Uni
versity exercises, nor remain in
residence Ht the University except
by special permission of the Com
mittee on Delinquent Scholarship.
5 Mid-semester reports on schol
arship shall be obtained from all
instructors, and students shall be
notified of their delinquencies.
6 Students doing unsatisfactory
work may be placed on probation
at any time. When the probation
is continued from one semester to
the next, students shall receive no
tice to that effect. Students on
probation may be required to with
draw at any time.
7. A tirst application for leave of
absence for the remainder of any
collegiate year will not be refused
on the ground of delinquent schol
arship; but a student seriously de
ficient in scholarship at the time of
taking such leave will be placed on
probation on returning to the Uni
versity and a subsequent compul
sory withdrawal will be permanent.
No credit will be given for work
done during the semester in which
leave of absence is taken. Appli
cation for leave of absence under
the above conditions will not be
granted during the last six weeks
of the second semester; nor at any
time to students who have been
previously under suspension on ac
count of delinquent scholarship.
8. Students on probation shall
not take part in any intercollegi
ate contest, nor represent the Uni
versity in any way, whether indi
vidually or in connection with any
athletic, literary, musical dra
matic, or other organization.

in scholarship the fact shall be
