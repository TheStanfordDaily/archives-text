# SCHOLARSHIP POLICY
## ACADEMIC COUNCIL REVISES COMMITTEE REGULATIONS. Status of Students Delinquent in Scholarship Fully Defined by New Rulings. 
### 
The Academic Council at a meet
ing held May 10, 1905, adopted the
nine regulations, published below,
which make up a statement of the
revised policy of the Committee on
Scholarship. The articles cover de
linquency in scholarship and out
line the status of students who
have been forced to withdraw from
the University or who have been
placed on probation on account of
such delinquency. Applications
for leaves of absence are also de
fined with regard to the time and
conditions under which they may
be taken out.
Clause eight, which concerns stu
dents on probation, absolutely pro
hibits any such student from repre
senting the University in connec
tion with any athletic, literary,
musical, dramatic or other organi
zation. This is important, as it
states absolutely the attitude of the
University authorities toward those
students who permit their interest
in student body affairs to affect
their standing in scholarship.
The remainder of the articles are
well known as regards their gen
eral application, hut this is the
first time that the full text of these
regulations has been made public.
The statement of the committee
follows:
It is the policy of the committee
to exclude from the University stu
dents who fail to do the work for
which they are registered. The
cases which come before the com
mittee are considered individually
and are so varied in their nature
and conditions that no inflexible
rules can be followed. On the one
hand, questions of illness or other
inability must be taken into ac
count; on the other hand, the
judgment of the committee is modi
fied by past records for consistently
low grade of work.
The following regulations are
subject therefore to such modifica
tions in special cases as may be
determined by the committee:
1. At the end of his first semes
ter a student who is delinquent in
scholarship shall receive official
Warning of the unsatisfactory na
ture of his work, and shall be
placed on probation for the second
semester; but if his failure has in
volved two-thirds or more of the
work for which he is registered, the
warning shall be waived, and he
shall be required to withdraw from
the University for the following se
mester.
2. During all semesters subse
quent to the first, students who fail
to obtain passing grades in two
thirds of the work for which they
are registered, shall be required to
withdraw from the University for
the period of one semester.
3. Students re-entering the Uni
versity after compulsory with
drawal because of scholarship may
take tests to remove "incompletes"
