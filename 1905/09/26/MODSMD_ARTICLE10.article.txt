# UNIVERSITY PAYS TAXES.
## Stanford Amendment Exempted Only the Buildings and Cash Endowment 
### 
Although the fact is not general
ly known, Stanford University
pays taxes both to the counties and
town in which its holdings lie. The
constitutional amendment, passed
in November, 1900, and commonly
called the Stanford amendment, ex
empted only the buildings and the
actual cash endowment of the Uni
versity from taxation. Although
the sum thus gained was large,
there still remains a tax on all the
farm land, residences and other
real estate owned by the institu
tion, which totals a small fortune.

ted to the Palo Alto trustees at
