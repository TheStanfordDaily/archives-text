# Challenge from Southern California.
## 
### 
The law school of the University
of Southern California has chal
lenged the Stanford law school to a
debate. If accepted this would be
the first contest of this nature in
which the Stanford law school, as
such, has participated. The Stan
ford team would be very strong, as
most of the Varsity debaters for
several years past have been mem
bers of this department. Among

the veterans in the department are
Roehr, '04, Salep, '06, and Lewis,
'04, who should be as able to
worthily support their department.
