# FRESHMEN IMPROVE SLOWLY.
## Varsity Given Light Practice Last Night.â€”Game with Willamette Saturday. 
### 
Football practice yesterday after
noon showed that the Freshman
squad was improving but slowly,
due to the large number of men on
the field, many of them totally un
adapted to play the game. The
size of this squad is at present
bothering the coaches.
The Varsity squad was given
limbering-up exercises yesterday,
consisting of tackling the dummy,
falling on the ball, catching, pass
ing and running down on punts.
Instruction was given to the line
men and backs separately, and
both sections were given lessons in
starting. Several players are
slightly bruised from the game
with St. Vincent's last Saturday,
but no one failed to report for work
to-day. Merrill, '05, and Tomasini,
'08, reported for work for the first
time last night.
Next Saturday afternoon there
will be two games on the campus
gridiron. The Freshmen will play
Palo Alto High School, and the
Varsity will meet the team from
Willamette College, Oregon.
