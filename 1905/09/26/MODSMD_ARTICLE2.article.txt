# DEBATING CLUB MEETS
## SYSTEM OF TRY-OUTS AND SELECTION OF TEAMS REVISED. Challenge from University of Southern California Refused.â€”Freshman-Sophomore Contest. 
### 
At a meeting of the University
Debating Club held yesterday
it was decided to radically change
the prevailing system of choosing
the debating teams. In the past
it bas always been the custom to
select four men to compose an in
tercollegiate team to meet the
representatives from the University
of California, the fourth man acting
as an alternate. For a contest
with a minor college four other
men were picked to compose that
team, including an alternate. From
now on the system will be that at
the annual try-outs ten debaters
will be selected. The first three
will constitute the team which will
debate California; the second three
will form a second team which will
also prepare on the Stanford-Cali
fornia question and afford the Var
sity trio practice in preliminary
debates; while the last four men
will compose a regular second Stan
ford team, including an alternate,
which will represent the University
in any contests which may be
scheduled outside of the regular
debate with California.
The coaches and men composing
the two Varsity teams will choose
by election one man from the sec
ond trio to act as alternate in the
big debate. A specially devised
pin will be presented to the man
achieving this distinction. Here
tofore an alternate has never re
ceived a pin or token of any
kind.
The object of the change is pri
marily to increase the skill of the
trio which will represent the Uni
versity in the main event of the
year. The system is patterned af
ter that in vogue at Harvard,
where it has worked successfully
for a number of years, and will
take effect here beginning next se
mester.
A challenge to debate received
from the University of Southern
California was presented at the
meeting and it was unanimously
decided that such a proposition
was impossible of consideration
this year because of the prearranged
debate with Nevada set for next
semester.
The executive committee of the
Intersociety Debating League also
met yesterday and decided that
the Freshman try-out will be
held the first Friday night in No
vember and the Sophomore try-out,
the following night. A month
later, the first Friday in December,
the class debate will be held.
Names of those wishing to try out
for either of these teams must be
handed to one of the following be
fore next Saturday noon: R. E.
Hodge, '08, C. C. McColloch, '08,
E. E. Young, '09, and J. Politzer,
'09. Early next week squads will
be drawn from the names handed
in, and the candidates can then
choose their questions and sides

and begin active preparation for
the preliminary debates.
The plan of holding the under
class debate the first semester is a
decided innovation, the event hav
ing always been previously held
early in the spring. The change is
made to afford Freshman and
Sophomore debaters a chance to
compete for positions on the Var
sity teams which are chosen in the
spring of each year, the same time
that the Freshman-Sophomore de
bate was formerly held. It is in
tended to make the change a per
manent one.
