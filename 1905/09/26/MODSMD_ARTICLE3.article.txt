# GIVEN SCHOLARSHIP
## C.A. LANTZ, '08, SELECTED BY TREASURER LATHROP. Appointment to Continue Until Graduation, Contrary to the System Employed Last Year. 
### 
C. A. Lantz, '08, has been ap
pointed to the Leland Stanford
Junior Memorial Scholarship by
C. Or. Lathrop. Lantz will hold
the scholarship until his gradu
ation from the University. Last
year the award was made by Mrs.
Stanford to Miss Elsie J. Stephens,
'07, with the stipulation that she
would hold it for one year.
The origin of this scholarship is
an interesting one. After the
death of Leland Stanford Jr., Sena
tor Stanford in looking over his
son's effects found the boy'B private
bank-book. This showed that Le
land had saved a considerable sum
of money without the knowledge
of his parents. With the interest
derived from this money the Me
morial Scholarship is supported.
The first holder of the scholar
ship was J. T. Cooper, '04, who was
appointed by Mrs.Stanford to hold
the scholarship until his gradu
ation. Last September Miss Ste
phens was appointed to succeed
Cooper. With Mrs. Stanford's
death in February the right of
naming the holder of the scholar
ship passed to her brother, C. G.
Lathrop, the treasurer of the Uni
versity, who has made his first ap
pointment this year.
Lantz, the new appointee, is a
member of the student volunteer
fire department, and lives in the
fire-house. He is registered in the
department of Chemistry.
