# BLEACHERS GOING UP
## TRAINING-HOUSE WILL BE ERECTED NEAR WEST END. Plans Include Dressing-Rooms, Store-Rooms, and Assembly-Room for Accommodation of Teams. 
### 
The plane for the new training
house, upon which work is to be
begun at once, have been complet
ed. The building is to 1)6 located
on the new football field, under the
west section of the bleachers, which
are now in the process of construc
tion. The bleachers are over one
third completed, and will be ready
in ample time for the intercol
legiate game. The only chance for
delay is in getting the lumber from
the mills to the field, since there is
a shortage of railroad cars at pres
ent. The parts of the bleachers are
sawed out before they are brought
to the grounds, so that nothing
remains to be done but putting
them together when they arrive.
The ground is in very good con
dition, and will need only the us
ual attention before it can be play
ed on.
The training-house will be so sit
uated that it may be used for all
three of the intercollegiate sports â€”
football, track, and baseball. Di
rectly accessible from the inside of
the football field, it will also have
a wide porch on the outside facing
the track. The baseball field will
also be close at hand. The train
ing-house will take up the space of
about ten of the lower rows of seats,
and will extend entirely through
the bleachers It will be thoroughly
lighted by windows throughout,
but the dressing and rubbing-rooms
will lie especially light and well
ventilated.
The building will contain four
large dressing-rooms, an assembly
room, several large store-rooms,
and a furnace-room. The dressing
rooms will be entered from the in
side of the bleachers. Each team
will have two rooms at its service,
containing three shower-baths, a
closet, wash-stand, and rows of
lockers around the walls. The two
pairs of dressing-rooms will be
separated by a partition lined with
lockers. The assembly-room, in
front of the dressing-rooms, con
taining bench seats and a large
fireplace, will measure a little over
eighteen by twenty-seven feet in
area.
To the right and left of the hall
are janitor-rooms, store-rooms, and
divisions for coal and wood, and
water-heaters. The porch, twenty
nine by twenty feet, opens from the
assembly-room toward the track.
The training-house is to be built
of Oregon pine, with the interior
finish of the same material.
