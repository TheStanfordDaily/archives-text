The action of the Academic
Council is to be commended for
making public a set of rules which
will in general govern them in
judging tbe status of a student
This act upon their part fills a
long-felt want of the student body
at large. While the average stu
dent, especially after a year's resi
dence, has a fair idea of the Uni
versity regulations in regard to
scholarship, still there has been an
element of vagueness which per
meated the minds of the majority.
This vagueness has been the cause
of much ill feeling at times on the
part of some of the parties brought
in contact with the authorities, a
feeling somewhat akin to fighting
an enemy in the dark.
While the committee plainly
states, and it is to be expected, that
these rules are not hard and fast
but that circumstances alter cases,
still the rules laid down are far
more tangible than anything that
the students have had to use as a
guide, and they should now plainly
see their limitations and know
what is in store for them. If they
bring restrictions upon themselves
they have been forewarned, and
they have not a shadow of excuse.
