### 
Before an appreciative audience
Edwin Emerson, the distinguished
war correspondent, last night de
livered an intensely interesting lec
ture in Assembly Hall on "The In
side Story of Port Arthur's Siege
and Capitulation."
Mr. Emerson's remarks, drawn
entirely from personal experience
and observation, were made excep
tionally realistic by lantern-slides.
The speaker has a forceful person
ality, which added much to the at
tractiveness of his lecture.
Dr. Jordan introduced Mr. Emer
son to the audience, who prefaced
his remarks by a few local allu
sions, after which he plunged di
rectly into his subject. He briefly
explained the situation in the Far
East at the opening of the war.
Then he described how in the com
pany of a fellow correspondent he
succeeded in running the blockade
into Port Arthur, where he made
the acquaintance of Clemens Lind
painter of the staff of the Novi
Krai, the only photographer with
in the beleaguered city. This man
secured some wonderful pictures of
scenes during the siege, and Emer
son had all these at his disposal
last night. Graphically but sim
ply he described the terrible con
ditions in Port Arthur and in the
trenches around the city during
the investment, and related stories
of endurance and daring which
took place.
Leaving Port Arthur in a junk,
provided by the authorities, Emer
son was captured by the Japanese
men of war outside the harbor, who
turned him over to''the prison of
ficials at the Japanese base of sup
plies.
Clemens Lindpainter, the artist
from whom' the correspondent se
cured many of his valuable views,
descriptive of conditions inside of
Port Arthur, is traveling with
Emerson and last night assisted in
the display of the pictures.
While on the'campus, Mr. Emer
son was the guest of various faculty
members, and last night was enter
tained by the Press Club.
