Alto regarding the relics presented
to the Museum by Thomas Welton
Stanford is an effectual refutation
of the sensational stories concern
ing these gifts recently published
by a San Francisco newspaper.
The writer of these wild stories
might have ascertained their utter
falsity by the slightest investiga
tion, and his failure to tlo this is
but another illustration of that
form of journalism which sacrifices
truth to sensation, in this con
nection it may be asserted without
fear of denial that Stanford has
sought less and probably received
more gratuitous advertising than
any other privately endowed uni
versity.
