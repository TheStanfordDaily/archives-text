# Senior Women to Wear Gowns.
## 
### 
A meeting of the Senior women
was held yesterday afternoon, for
the purpose of deciding on regular
days for appearing in the caps and
gowns.
After some discussion, it wa√ü de
cided to wear the gowns on Wed
nesdays and Fridays. Although
these days were voted as regular
times for appearing in the distinct
ive Senior dress, it does not preclude
the women from wearing them on
other days of the week.
