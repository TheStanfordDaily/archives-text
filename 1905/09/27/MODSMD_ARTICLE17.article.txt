# Law Association Will Hold Smoker.
## 
### 
The Stanford Law Association
will hold a smoker this semester
near the date of the intercollegiate
football contest, probably the Fri
day night before the Varsity game.
This time has been selected as it is

expected that many of the old
members of the association will be
on the campus to attend the big
game and they will be able to be
present at this smoker. B. P. Oak
ford, '02, who is president of the
association, E. C. Rittenhouse, '04,
and Professor Nathan Abbott, head
of the advisory committee, will
have charge of the arrangements.
