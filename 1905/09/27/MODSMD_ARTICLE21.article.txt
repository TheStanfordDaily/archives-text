# GIFT TO MUSEUM ACCEPTED.
## No Truth in Statement that Gift of Thomas Welton Stanford Was Refused. 
### 
The story published and repub
lished from time to time by one of
the San Francisco papers regarding
the refusal of President Jordan to
accept for the University Museum
a consignment of Egyptian relics
on the grounds of the donor's as
sertion that they were obtained
through mystic means of a reputed
spiritualist is wholly untrue. The
story in brief according to the false
report is that a valuable collection
of Egyptian coins and tablets was
obtained for the Hon. Thomas
Welton Stanford by an Australi
an spiritualistic medium through
means of his mystic powers. The
collection thus obtained was pre
sented to the Stanford Museum,
but President Jordan refused to ac
cept the gift for fear that his ac
ceptance of these curios would be
equivalent to acknowledging belief
in the powers of spiritualism. Now,
the story continues, the relics have
been placed in the Museum by
President Jordan subject to an au
thoritative examination by Profes
sor H. W. Rolfe of the Greek depart
ment, and that in case his decision
regarding their genuineness and
worth is favorable they will be
placed on exhibition permanently.
Such is the story as told by the
San Francisco papers. But the
truth of the matter is that two
years ago Hon. Thomas Welton
Stanford presented the Museum
with a collection of Egyptian coins
and tablets which were immediately
accepted by the Board of Trustees,
and placed on exhibition in the
Egyptian room of the Museum,
where they are at the present time.
The fact stated that there was ever
any refusal or hesitation on the
part of the University authorities
/in accepting these relics on account
of the manner in which they
were obtained, is entirely without
foundation. President Jordan when
questioned to-day stated that he
knew nothing about this matter
beyond the fact that he acknowl
edged the receipt of these relics
when thay first arrived at the Uni
versity two years ago.
