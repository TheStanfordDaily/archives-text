# SCRIMMAGE LAST NIGHT.
## Candidates for Back-field Positions Play Well.â€”Good Punting Done. 
### 
The Varsity squad was given the
football field last night, and the
Freshmen, under Assistant-Coach
Bansbach, practiced on the base
ball diamond.
Only ten minutes of the after
noon's practice was allowed for
passing the ball, the rest of the
time being divided equally among
the four Varsity teams in scrim
mage work. A majority of the Var
sity squad, which also includes five
Freshmen, were given a chance in
scrimmage work. Two halves of
twenty minutes each were played,
so as to give the coaches an opportu
nity to play as many of the squad
as possible.
The back-field was the strongest
part of the team in each case, owing
to the abundance of excellent ma
terial trying-out for these positions.
At quarter-back the three can
didates, Stott, '07, Laumeister, '07,
and Fenton, '08, were given a
chance at running the teams. Fen
ton was coached to try a num
ber of trick plays, and these invari
ably netted good distances.
The punting of the squads was
good. Torney, '09, is one of the
most consistent punters in the
squad. Dole, '07, Fenton, '08,
Cuthbertson, '09, and Crawford,
'09, are all good men, and have an
even chance at present for the
position of punter in the inter
collegiate game.
