# OFFER PUNTING CUP
## QUADRANGLE CLUB WILL AWARD FOOTBALL TROPHY. Won Last Year by Dole, ex-'05. Conditions of the Competition. 
### 
The punting cup, which iB offered
by the Quadrangle Club to the best
punter on the football Bquad, will
be competed for again this season.
The conditions of the offer require
that the trophy must be won three
times before it becomes the prop
erty of any individual. This is
the third year that the cup has
been offered by the club.
The first competition was held
in the football season of 1903, but
no award was made, as all of the
averages were very unsatisfactory.
M. P. Hyde, ex-'O6, a transfer from
Michigan, and a candidate for half
back position, showed excellent
form while punting in practice, but
in a contest he failed to attain good
results. W. H. Dole, ex-'O5, and
W. K. Sprott, ex-'O6, did the rest
of the kicking for the Varsity that
season, and the decision between
them was very close. Sprott ex
hibited the most consistent form
during the first part of the fall, but
in the Varsity game he injured his
leg and Dole was forced to do all
the punting. He showed such ex
cellent form that it was impossible
for any award to be made, and
there was no time to hold a punt
ing tournament after the end of the
season.
Last year Dole did all the punt
ing for the Varsity, and he was
awarded the trophy for his consist
ent work throughout the season.
Dole's name was the first to be en
graved upon the cup.
At a recent meeting of the Quad
rangle Club plans for awarding
the cup this season were definite
ly formulated. Coach Lanagan
and Assistant Coach Bansbach
will keep a careful record of the
work of all the football men who
are punting for the squad this
year. At the end of the season the
averages will be footed up and the
cup will be awarded to the man
making the best record.
No set rules will govern the com
petition, but in the main, distance
and accuracy will be the qualifica
tions most desired. Moreover,
punting that is done under actual
scrimmage conditions will be re
garded as more important than
that which is done in open field
work.
