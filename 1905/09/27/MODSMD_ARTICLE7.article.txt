# SUMMARY OF STUDENTS
## MANY DEPARTMENTS SHOW INCREASE IN NUMBERS. Department of Law Shows Greatest Expansion.—Engineering and Geology Decreases. 
### 
The announcement given out by
the Registrar's office to-day of the
number of new students registering
for the year of 1905-6 in the various
departments of the University
is printed below, with correspond
ing summaries made at the same
date last fall for the year of 1904-6.
The most extraordinary increase
in registration shown by any de
partment is that of the Law de
partment, which presents a regis
tration almost double that of last
year. Fifteen departments show
marked increase, two have the
same registration as last year, and
only five show small losses in num
bers. Of these the Geology depart
ment is the heaviest loser, and it is
noticeable that all of the Engineer
ing departments save that of Elec
trical Engineering have a decrease
in the number attending. It is a
significant fact that while the total
registration shows the largest in
crease on record, the number of
special students registering has de
creased. It is also noticeable that
the number of students entering
from points within California has
not increased in proportion to the
number entering from outside of the
state.
