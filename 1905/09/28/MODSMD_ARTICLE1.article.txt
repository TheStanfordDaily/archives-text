# HARD WORK CONTINUES
## SCRIMMAGE GIVEN VARSITY AND FRESHMAN SQUADS. General Improvement in Playing Characterizes Practice.â€”Horton Reports for Work. 
### 
The Varsity and Freshman
squads engaged in scrimmage work
last night after short periods of
practicing signals, drop-kicking,
and punting out from the extreme
corners of the goal-line.
The first two teams were pitted
against each other, and almost
after every down Head-Coach Lan
agan had a suggestion to make,
whereby the team-work of the back
field and the offense of the line
could be improved.
Particular attention was given to
the ends. There are a large num
ber of candidates for end, neces
sitating a frequent change so as to
afford every man an opportunity
to play. The ends on the offensive
were given particular instruction
whenever the quarter-back called
for a punt. Lanagan emphasizes
the smaller and minor points of the
game to a great extent in order to
devote all his time, beginning with
next week, to team-work.
The drop-kicking of Fenton, '08,
is particularly good. He seemed
to have little difficulty in sending
the ball between the goal-posts
each time. A heavy northwest
wind was blowing, but that did not
prevent one drop-kick after the
other from soaring high above the
cross-bar and safe between the goal
posts. Drop-kicking was tried at
distances varying from 20 to 35
yards. Dole,"'o7, experienced dif
ficulty in accurately gauging the
distance, and was not so successful
in his attempts.
The Freshmen continue to play
erratic ball, although yesterday
afternoon's practice showed slight
improvement over the work of the
previous day. With a decrease in
the Freshman squad after to day's
game, Assistant-Coach Bansbach
will have more time to devote to
the men who will probably enter
the game. At present it is almost
impossible to attempt to yive every
individual separate attention.
