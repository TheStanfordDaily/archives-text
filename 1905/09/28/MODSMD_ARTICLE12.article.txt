As a result of a disturbance in
Encina Hall on Tuesday night over
twenty men have been requested to
leave the dormitory by this eve
ning at six o'clock. A list of names
was posted in the hall this morn
ing. These men were summoned
before the chairman of the Student
Affairs committee and told that
they would have to leave the dor
mitory. The men dismissed were
selected mainly on account of their
past records, and were given no
opportunity for a hearing. This is
a brief summary of the case, and
from the facts the treatment of the
students does not seem to have
been fair. In the first place, the
manner of selecting the men who
were to be made an example of
resulted in a number of men who
took no active part in the "rough
house" being unjustly punished.
That they had done some act in
the past was all that was necessary.
The supposition that a student who
was once a transgressor of the rules
is always guilty and could not
have reformed seems to have been
the principle which governed the
action. This is manifestly unjust.
Another point is that the men were
given no hearing before the com
mittee, and were not allowed to ex
plain what part they took in the
affair, or whether they took any
part at all. That a man should be
thus thrown out of the dormitory
without a chance to say a word for
himself will surely not receive the
approbation of the student body.
That the innocent should be pun
ished along with the wrong-doers
seems a poor plan, and yet this
seems to have been the case.
Going back to the root of the af
fair, the person who is originally
partly to blame is the one who en
gaged the watchman. This watch
man is totally unfit for his place.
And it stands to reason that the
students would not rine up and
create the disturbance that thev

did without any cau√üe. The past
stands as ample proof of this fact.
Now, would it not be better for the
University authorities to place con
trol of the hall in the hands of the
students themselves, with a com
mittee selected from their number
who will deal with all cases that
arise? A sort of honor system
should lie installed and the watch
man withdrawn. The system of
spying in force here creates antag
onism and hard feeling, and does
far more harm than good. The
students should be treated as men.
