## Gay and Cadwalader Victors in a Five-Set Match in Interclass Doubles. 
### 
The first round of the interclass
doubles tournament waß started
yesterday hy the match between
the Sophomore and Freshman
representatives. L. R. Gay and M.
A. Cadwalader, representing the
second-year men, defeated A. Gow
an and M. O. Adams, the 1909
players.
This match was the closest that
has been played this year in the
interclass contests, the full five sets
being required to decide the win
ners. Gay and Cadwalader took
the first two sets with little effort,
both playing a strong net game
and keeping their opponents well
back in the court. Gowan and
Adams succeeded in getting the
next two sets by clever driving, but
were unable to take the fifth and
deciding one.
A strong wind blowing across
the courts prevented the play«rs
from showing their best form and
at one time during the match rain
interfered with the play.
The final round of the Junior
try-out was completed Tuesday
afternoon, G. E Dole and M. C.
Burr winning from W. H. Swayne
and C. L. Lewis by a small mar
gin. As the Senior try-outs are
not completed, the second match
of the first round will probably
not take place until to-morrow.
The winners of the final round
in the Senior tournament will meet
Dole and Burr, the Junior repres
entatives.
•Summary:
First round —L. R. Gay, '08, and
M. A. Cadwalader, '08, defeated
