# Library Being Roofed.
## 
### 
Architect C. E. Hodges has let a
contract to the Standard Paint
Company for covering the wooden
roof of the new Library building
with tin sheeting and rubberoid in
preparation for the final covering
of red tiling. The Library roof will
match the roofs of the quadrangle
buildings and Chemistry building.
