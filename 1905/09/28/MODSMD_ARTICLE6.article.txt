# PLAN FOR CLASS PLAY
## SOPHOMORE FARCE COMMITTEE MAKES ARRANGEMENTS. Comedy Will Be Given Next Semester. â€”Cast Will Be Selected from Second-Year Students. 
### 
Preliminary arrangements are
already under way following the
custom of previous years for the
production of a play by the Sopho
more class sometime during next
semester.
The committee, consisting of
Mi ss E. L. Buckingham, Miss Hel
en Green, C. L. Severy, E. J. Swift,
and H. E. Menardi, chairman, met
last night at 13 Salvatierra street
to outline plans for the class play.
Only the general details of the pro
duction were discussed. It was de
cided to produce some standard
comedy at about the same time as
the class of 1907 gave their play
last year, which was early in Feb
ruary. As soon as a play is select
ed, a try-out will be held to pick
the characters. This selection will
be made under the direction of a
competent coach, who will be chos- !
en later by the committee.
The decision as to the selection
of thecomedy itself will rest largely
with Mr. L. E. Bassett, instructor
in the English department, who
has been secured by the committee
to aid them in making their choice.
Mr. Bassett has already written
East to secure information on cer
tain desirable dramas. This infor
mation will be forthcoming within
a week, and the play will probably
be chosen immediately afterward.
The committee also decided to
continue the policy inaugurated
last year of picking the characters
for the play entirely from their
own class, thus making the pro
duction a distinctly Sophomore
affair.
