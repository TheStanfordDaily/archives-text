# TO HAVE A HEARING
## DISMISSED ENCINA MEN WILL MAKE DEFENSE. Professor Green Agrees to Meet the Men Individually.— Case of Watchman Before Trustees. 
### 
The spirit of rebellion hovering
over Encina Hall, and to a large
extent over the whole University,
was stilled to some extent last
night when it was announced that
President Jordan had decided to
submit the case of the Encina
watchman to the Board of Trustees,
and further that the Committee on
Student Affairs had decided to go
over again the list of men dis
missed from the hall, and to accord
to each man the privilege of a full
hearing. This understanding was
reached after a conference of sever
al hours between President Jordan
and Professors Green and Griffin of
the Student Affairs committee and
a committee of five members of the
Encina Club, appointed by Presi
dent W. E. Crawford.
Ever since the opening of college
there has been a strong feeling
against the watchman, who is a
man of no education and of un
attractive appearance. He has
been permitted to carry a revolver,
and has several times displayed the
weapon, remarking that he would
use it freely upon any student who
attempted to interfere with him.
Unlike previous watchmen, who
have confined their attention to the
care of the building, this man has
attempted to regulate the conduct
of the students themselves, and in
pursuance of this effort he has not
hesitated to enter the rooms of stu
dents without knocking and to
interrogate the occupants, a prac
tice that has at times threatened to
cause serious trouble. The further
practice of the watchman of fre
quenting the club-room and using
the newspapers and billiard tables
caused some feeling. The climax
was reached Tuesday night, when
a noisy demonstration followed the
extinguishing of the club-room
lights. The watchman remained
in the club-room for some time for
fear that he would be struck by
some of the cuspidors or other
missiles that were thrown from the
upper floors of the hall. The ex
cuse for the trouble was the com
mon report that the Student Af
fairs committee had expressed its
helplessness to remedy the situa
tion, because the man was em
ployed by the Business Office, and
dissatisfaction with the dismissal
from the University of two students,
and from the hall of several others
for minor offenses.
The Faculty Student Affairs
committee, regarding the trouble
as a "riot" and an open declara
tion of rebellion, took prompt
action, and yesterday a list of
twenty-one men was posted in
Encina Hall, whose presence before
Professor Green was desired. These
men were asked for no explanation
of their conduct, but were arbitrari
ly informed that they were to leave
the hall by 6 o'clock in the evening.
If they chose to remain in the hall
until Saturday, they would be held
responsible for any trouble that
might occur. These conditions
were accepted by but five men.
The men upon whom the wrath
of the committee thus fell included
some of the most representative
men of the hall, and some who
were regarded as the quietest resi
dents of the big dormitory, and
even others who were known not
to have been in Encina at the time
of the trouble. Under the circum
stances, the arbitrary action of the
committee was considered to be
very unjußt, and aroused a storm
of criticism. A committee was
named by President Crawford of
the Encina Club to lay the matter
before President Jordan and the
committee.
President Jordan, while con
demning the violent method of
protest, at once expressed bis strong
disapproval of the presence of an
armed watchman in the hall, and
said he would lay the matter before
the trustees at their meeting to-day.
The Encina committee was in
formed bv Professor-Green that the
men who had been dismissed were
regarded as the disturbing elements
in the hall and were expelled from
the hall on their past records, and
not, in most cases, upon any spe
cific charge. Some of the charges
upon which men were dismissed
were a year or more old. The En
cina committee strongly represent
ed that this was a serious injustice,
which tended to destroy the confi
dence of the hall in the desire of
the faculty committee to deal fair
ly with the men. ,
The faculty committee, in re
ply, said that a riot had occurred,
and the committee proposed to take
riot measures. Professor Green
said that the Board of Trustees
would demand of the committee
some action, and the committee
saw no method other than that of
expelling those whom-,
ed as trouble-makers, regardless of
their connection with Tuesday's
trouble, or with even "tubbings" or
other disturbances this semester.
The faculty committee admitted
that injustice might have 'been
done, however, and Professor Green
finally agreed that he would accord
a full hearing to each of the men,
giving the accused an opportunity
to present his defense.
There was some discussion of the
possibility of student control in the
hall. President Jordon, however,
regarded it as a necessary feature
of student, control that the students
should accept full financial re
sponsibility for damage to buildings
or furniture. This responsibility
the Encina Club has always de
clined to accept.

a noisy demonstration followed the
extinguishing of the club-room
lights. The watchman remained
in the club-room for some time for
fear that he would be struck by
some of the cuspidors or other
missiles that were thrown from the
upper floors of the hall. The ex
cuse for the trouble was the com
mon report that the Student Af
fairs committee had expressed its
helplessness to remedy the situa
tion, because the man was em
ployed by the Business Office, and
dissatisfaction with the dismissal
from the University of two students,
and from the hall of several others
for minor offenses.
The Faculty Student Affairs
committee, regarding the trouble
as a "riot" and an open declara
tion of rebellion, took prompt
action, and yesterday a list of
twenty-one men was posted in
Encina Hall, whose presence before
Professor Green was desired. These
men were asked for no explanation
of their conduct, but were arbitrari
ly informed that they were to leave
the hall by 6 o'clock in the evening.
If they chose to remain in the hall
until Saturday, they would be held
responsible for any trouble that
might occur. These conditions
were accepted by but five men.
The men upon whom the wrath
of the committee thus fell included
some of the most representative
men of the hall, and some who
were regarded as the quietest resi
dents of the big dormitory, and
even others who were known not
to have been in Encina at the time
of the trouble. Under the circum
stances, the arbitrary action of the
committee was considered to be
very unjußt, and aroused a storm
of criticism. A committee was
named by President Crawford of
the Encina Club to lay the matter
before President Jordan and the
committee.
President Jordan, while con
demning the violent method of
protest, at once expressed bis strong
disapproval of the presence of an
armed watchman in the hall, and
said he would lay the matter before
the trustees at their meeting to-day.
The Encina committee was in
formed bv Professor-Green that the
men who had been dismissed were
regarded as the disturbing elements
in the hall and were expelled from
the hall on their past records, and
not, in most cases, upon any spe
cific charge. Some of the charges
upon which men were dismissed
were a year or more old. The En
cina committee strongly represent
ed that this was a serious injustice,
which tended to destroy the confi
dence of the hall in the desire of
the faculty committee to deal fair
ly with the men. ,
The faculty committee, in re
ply, said that a riot had occurred,
and the committee proposed to take
riot measures. Professor Green
said that the Board of Trustees
would demand of the committee
some action, and the committee
saw no method other than that of
expelling those whom-,
ed as trouble-makers, regardless of
their connection with Tuesday's
trouble, or with even "tubbings" or
other disturbances this semester.
The faculty committee admitted
that injustice might have 'been
done, however, and Professor Green
finally agreed that he would accord
a full hearing to each of the men,
giving the accused an opportunity
to present his defense.
There was some discussion of the
possibility of student control in the
hall. President Jordon, however,
regarded it as a necessary feature
of student, control that the students
should accept full financial re
sponsibility for damage to buildings
or furniture. This responsibility
the Encina Club has always de
clined to accept.
The spirit of rebellion hovering
over Encina Hall, and to a large
extent over the whole University,
was stilled to some extent last
night when it was announced that
President Jordan had decided to
submit the case of the Encina
watchman to the Board of Trustees,
and further that the Committee on
Student Affairs had decided to go
over again the list of men dis
missed from the hall, and to accord
to each man the privilege of a full
hearing. This understanding was
reached after a conference of sever
al hours between President Jordan
and Professors Green and Griffin of
the Student Affairs committee and
a committee of five members of the
Encina Club, appointed by Presi
dent W. E. Crawford.
Ever since the opening of college
there has been a strong feeling
against the watchman, who is a
man of no education and of un
attractive appearance. He has
been permitted to carry a revolver,
and has several times displayed the
weapon, remarking that he would
use it freely upon any student who
attempted to interfere with him.
Unlike previous watchmen, who
have confined their attention to the
care of the building, this man has
attempted to regulate the conduct
of the students themselves, and in
pursuance of this effort he has not
hesitated to enter the rooms of stu
dents without knocking and to
interrogate the occupants, a prac
tice that has at times threatened to
cause serious trouble. The further
practice of the watchman of fre
quenting the club-room and using
the newspapers and billiard tables
caused some feeling. The climax
was reached Tuesday night, when
a noisy demonstration followed the
extinguishing of the club-room
lights. The watchman remained
in the club-room for some time for
fear that he would be struck by
some of the cuspidors or other
missiles that were thrown from the
