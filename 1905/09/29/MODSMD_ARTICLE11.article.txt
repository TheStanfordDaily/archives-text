The exhibition of football, or
what was supposed to be football,
which took place on the campus
yesterday afternoon does not augur
well for a Stanford victory on Oc
tober 14th. The intercollegiate
Freshman game is only two weeks
away and the first-year men have
a large amount of football to learn
in a very short time. The Fresh
men should not be discouraged, as
there still remains time to develop
a team that the University may be
proud of. But if this is to be ac
complished, every man must put
his heart into the game and play
harder than he has ever done be
fore. The Freshmen have a hard
task before them, but it is possible
of completion if they realize these
facts before it is too late.
