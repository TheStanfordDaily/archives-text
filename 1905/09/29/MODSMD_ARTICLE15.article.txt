# INTERCLASS DOUBLES
## DOLE AND BURR WIN UNIVERSITY CHAMPIONSHIP. Junior Team Defeats Sophomore Representatives in Final Round of Tennis Tournament. 
### 
G. E. Dole and M. C. Burr, the
Junior representatives in the inter
class doubles tournament, won the
championship of the University
yesterday afternoon. The try-out
for the Senior team resulted in a
victory for H. E. Savage and M. F.
Bradley, who met Dole and Burr
in the first round of the interclass
contest.
The Junior team won from the
Seniors in straight sets, and met
L. R. Gay and M. A. Cadwalader,
the Sophomore representatives, in
the final round of the tournament.
The contest for the University
championship was close, four sets
being played. The first set was
taken by the 1908 team by strong
over-head work and consistent lob
bing, but the next three sets were
won by their opponents, whose
speed broke through the net game
of the second-year men. The wind
was too strong for good tennis, as
was the case in the Sophomore-
Freshman match held Wednesday
afternoon.
The completion of the doubles
tournament marks the end of the
interclass tennis for this college
year. On Thanksgiving day there
will be held a handicap tourna
ment for the cup offered by F. C.
Theile of Palo Alto. Competition
for this cup is open to all members
of the faculty, alumni, and stu
dents of Stanford University, and
must be won three times to become
the permanent possession of any
player. The cup was won last year
by L. R. Gay, the present cham
pion of the Sophomore class.
