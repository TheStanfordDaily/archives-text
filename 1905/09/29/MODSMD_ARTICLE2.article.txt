# PLAY POOR FOOTBALL
## FRESHMEN BARELY DEFEAT LIGHT OPPONENTS. Hoitt's Beaten by Two Touch-downs Scored in the First Half of a Ragged Game. 
### 
In an exhibition of the poorest
football ever witnessed on the cam
pus gridiron, the Freshmen yester
day defeated the team from Hoitt's
School by a score of 10-0. There
was not one single redeeming feat
ure in the playing of the Fresh
men, as they were equally weak on
the offensive and defensive. The
work of the ends was very poor
and showed distinctly that the
coaches must develop better men
for these positions.
Hoitt's played an excellent game
although handicapped in weight.
The full-back on the Hoitt's eleven
weighs only 108 pounds, yet he
managed to plough through the
Freshman line assisted by the
backs. The quarter-back worked
no less than seven fake plays which
netted from 10 to 45 yards each
time. On several occasions he had
only to pass the Freshman quar
ter-back to make a touch-down,
but was tackled after he had left
the scrimmage-line. Hoitt's tried
four place-kicks which failed, but
the first attempt came near result
ing in a score.
The first touch-down was made
by Terrill after eight minutes of
play. Holman made the second
touch-down toward the end of the
first half, getting the ball on a punt
and running through the scattered
field to the goal-line. In each case
the goal was missed. The Fresh
men lost a total of 50 yards for off
side play.
