# DEFEAT WILLAMETTE
## VARSITY SCORES TOUCH-DOWN IN EACH HALF. Fumbling Prevents Visiting Team from Scoring.—Many Men Tried Out on Varsity. 
### 
After a hard struggle against the
heavy team of Willamette College,
the Varsity succeeded in winning
Saturday's game by the score of 12
to 0. From the spectator's stand
point the game was eminently sat
isfactory, as the contest was re
plete with sensational plays and
fierce scrimmagei. To those who
witnessed the game of a week
ago the improvement in the play
ing of the Varsity was a matter of
general comment, for the Willam
ette team is conceded to have been
stronger than the St. Vincent
eleven.

Stanford scored the first touch
down fiVe minutes after the referee's
whistle blew for the kick-off, by
carrying the ball sixty yards with
out a single fumble. The three
backs, Dole, Crow, and Chalmers,
proved equally effective in advanc
ing the ball for substantial gains,
and despite the desperate defensive
work of the Willamette players
Crow was pushed over their line
for a touch-down,which Dole easily
converted into a goal.
With the ball in the possession
of Willamette after the second
