## VARSITY SCORES TOUCH-DOWN IN EACH HALF. Fumbling Prevents Visiting Team from Scoring.—Many Men Tried Out on Varsity.

After a hard struggle against the
heavy team of Willamette College,

fierce scrimmagei. To those who
witnessed the game of a week
ago the improvement in the play

Officials: Coach Bishop, Willam

'06, referee; Dr. Angell and Pro
fessor Searles, timekeepers; Ford
and McKnight, Willamette College,
linesmen. Time of halves, 20 min
utes.
Stanford scored the first touch
down fiVe minutes after the referee's
whistle blew for the kick-off, by
carrying the ball sixty yards with
out a single fumble. The three
backs, Dole, Crow, and Chalmers,
proved equally effective in advanc
ing the ball for substantial gains,
and despite the desperate defensive
work of the Willamette players
Crow was pushed over their line
for a touch-down,which Dole easily
converted into a goal.
With the ball in the possession
of Willamette after the second
kick-off conditions were completely
reversed, as the Stanford line could
not withstand the peculiar tackle
back and shift plays which were
directed against it. The success of
the tackle-back play was mainly
drte to the inefficiency of the Var
sity ends, who were boxed repeat
edly, and on numerous occasions
the runner was only prevented
from gaining an open field by the
splendid defensive work of full
back Crow. Costly fumbles at
critical moments robbed the visitors
of the reward of their otherwise
good playing, and with the end of
the first half the threatened Stan
ford goal-line had not been crossed.
The second half witnessed a large
number of changes in the Stanford
line-up, and there was a noticeable
improvement in the defensive work
of both teams. In this period
Stanford was equally guilty with
Willamette in the number of cost
ly fumbles which were made.
Stanford's inability to continuously
hold the ball probably saved the
visitors from being scored against
more than once in this half.
Another feature of the second
half was the drop-kicking by Fen
ton, who failed to increase the score
only by the narrowest of margin*.
The second touch-down was made
by systematically battering the
Willamette line until the ball was
carried over by Slusher toward the
end of the game.
Willamette kicked off, Chalmers
returning it 5 yards. Dole punted
35 yards and Willamette was
downed with a return of only 2
yards. Failing to make first down
on three tackle-back plays, the
ball went to Stanford and Dole
was sent through left tackle for
yards. Stott made a 25-yard run
around left end, and Chalmers
bucked for 3 yards. Chalmers
made 1 yard, Crow 2, and Dole 3
through right tackle, which left the
ball less than a yard from the goal
line. Crow was sent over for a
touch-down, and Dole kicked the
goal. Score 6-0.
Dole kicked off for 25 yards and
Willamette fumbled but secured
the ball. Willamette kicked 30
yards, and Stanford returned it 10
yards to the center of the field.
Dole punted 25 yards. Willamette
made first down five successive
times on tackle plays and then
fumbled, Molfino dropping on the
ball. Brennan was sent through
for several gains netting 6 yards,
and Stanford was penalized 5 yards
for off side. Willamette secured
the ball on a fumble, but failed to
make the distance and Chalmers,
Tomasini, and Crow were sent
through for gains respectively of
5, and 3 yards. Time was
called just as Willamette secured
the ball. Score 6-0.
Stanford kicked off in the second
half, and Willamette was forced to
kick. Fenton returned the ball 5
of the 30 yards. Fenton made 20
yards on an end run. Three bucks
through left tackle netted 9 yards.
Stanford was penalized 5 yards for
being off side. Fenton tried a
place-kick, which barely missed
the bar. Two minutes later Fen
ton tried a second drop-kick and
failed because of the poor pass.
Willamette punted 30 yards from

the 25-yard line and Vandervoort
returned the ball 15 yards. Fen
ton punted 40 yards, Willamette
returning the punt for the same
distance. Fenton missed a third
drop-kick. On a return punt
Willamette made 35 yards, and
Stanford made firHt down four suc
cessive times. Willamette secured
the ball on a fumble and bucked
for 8 yards, but lost the ball on a
fumble. Cox made several gains
until the ball was on the 2-yard
line. On the second down it was
on the 2-foot line. Slusher made
the second touch-down and Fenton
kicked the goal. Score 12-0. Time
was called three minutes later.

Officials: Coach Bishop, Willam

linesmen. Time of halves, 20 min

Stanford scored the first touch
down fiVe minutes after the referee's
whistle blew for the kick-off, by
carrying the ball sixty yards with
out a single fumble. The three
backs, Dole, Crow, and Chalmers,
proved equally effective in advanc
ing the ball for substantial gains,
and despite the desperate defensive
work of the Willamette players
Crow was pushed over their line
for a touch-down,which Dole easily
converted into a goal.
With the ball in the possession
of Willamette after the second
kick-off conditions were completely
reversed, as the Stanford line could
not withstand the peculiar tackle
back and shift plays which were
directed against it. The success of
the tackle-back play was mainly
drte to the inefficiency of the Var
sity ends, who were boxed repeat
edly, and on numerous occasions
the runner was only prevented
from gaining an open field by the
splendid defensive work of full
back Crow. Costly fumbles at
critical moments robbed the visitors
of the reward of their otherwise
good playing, and with the end of
the first half the threatened Stan
ford goal-line had not been crossed.
The second half witnessed a large
number of changes in the Stanford
line-up, and there was a noticeable
improvement in the defensive work
of both teams. In this period
Stanford was equally guilty with
Willamette in the number of cost
ly fumbles which were made.
Stanford's inability to continuously
hold the ball probably saved the
visitors from being scored against
more than once in this half.
Another feature of the second
half was the drop-kicking by Fen
ton, who failed to increase the score
only by the narrowest of margin*.
The second touch-down was made
by systematically battering the
Willamette line until the ball was
carried over by Slusher toward the
end of the game.
Willamette kicked off, Chalmers
returning it 5 yards. Dole punted
35 yards and Willamette was
downed with a return of only 2
yards. Failing to make first down
on three tackle-back plays, the
ball went to Stanford and Dole
was sent through left tackle for
yards. Stott made a 25-yard run
around left end, and Chalmers
bucked for 3 yards. Chalmers
made 1 yard, Crow 2, and Dole 3
through right tackle, which left the
ball less than a yard from the goal
line. Crow was sent over for a
touch-down, and Dole kicked the
goal. Score 6-0.
Dole kicked off for 25 yards and
Willamette fumbled but secured
the ball. Willamette kicked 30
yards, and Stanford returned it 10
yards to the center of the field.
Dole punted 25 yards. Willamette
made first down five successive
times on tackle plays and then
fumbled, Molfino dropping on the
ball. Brennan was sent through
for several gains netting 6 yards,
and Stanford was penalized 5 yards
for off side. Willamette secured
the ball on a fumble, but failed to
make the distance and Chalmers,
Tomasini, and Crow were sent
through for gains respectively of
5, and 3 yards. Time was
called just as Willamette secured
the ball. Score 6-0.
Stanford kicked off in the second
half, and Willamette was forced to
kick. Fenton returned the ball 5
of the 30 yards. Fenton made 20
yards on an end run. Three bucks
through left tackle netted 9 yards.
Stanford was penalized 5 yards for
being off side. Fenton tried a
place-kick, which barely missed
the bar. Two minutes later Fen
ton tried a second drop-kick and
failed because of the poor pass.
Willamette punted 30 yards from

the 25-yard line and Vandervoort
returned the ball 15 yards. Fen
ton punted 40 yards, Willamette
returning the punt for the same
distance. Fenton missed a third
drop-kick. On a return punt
Willamette made 35 yards, and
Stanford made firHt down four suc
cessive times. Willamette secured
the ball on a fumble and bucked
for 8 yards, but lost the ball on a
fumble. Cox made several gains
until the ball was on the 2-yard
line. On the second down it was
on the 2-foot line. Slusher made
the second touch-down and Fenton
kicked the goal. Score 12-0. Time
was called three minutes later.
After a hard struggle against the
heavy team of Willamette College,
the Varsity succeeded in winning
Saturday's game by the score of 12
to 0. From the spectator's stand
point the game was eminently sat
isfactory, as the contest was re
plete with sensational plays and
fierce scrimmagei. To those who
witnessed the game of a week
ago the improvement in the play
ing of the Varsity was a matter of
general comment, for the Willam
ette team is conceded to have been
stronger than the St. Vincent
eleven.
