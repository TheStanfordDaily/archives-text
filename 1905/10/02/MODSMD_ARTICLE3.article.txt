# To Arrange for Transportation.
## 
### 
The first step in the arrange
ments for handling the big crowds
which will visit the campus on the
day of the Varsity game was taken
to-day when a committee was ap
pointed by the Training House
Corporation who will confer with
representatives of the operating and
passenger departments of the
Southern Pacific railroad. The
members of this committee are Dr.
Frank Angell, Professor C. B.
Wing, and Assistant Registrar J.
E. McDowell, all of whom are
directors of the Training House
Corporation. The conference will
be held to-morrow in San Francisco
and all the plans for handling the
crowd will be thoroughly discussed.
