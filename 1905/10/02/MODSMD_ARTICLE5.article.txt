# FRESHMEN WIN AGAIN
## PALO ALTO DEFEATED BY A SCORE OF 28-6. Tomasini Scores Touch-down for High School Team After Two Minutes of Play. 
### 
The second game on the campus
gridiron Saturday afternoon re
sulted in a victory for the Fresh
men by the score of 28 to 6. The
Palo Alto High School team was
the opposing eleven, and the pre
paratory school players were hope
lessly overmatched by the Class of
1909. Palo Alto's lone touch-down
was made after the first three plays
of the game, and the spectators be
gan to fear a repetition of the farci
cal playing which has character
ized the work of the Freshmen can
didates during the past week. But
the summary dismissal to the side
lines by the coaches of the playerß
mainly responsible for Palo Alto's
long runs seemed to awaken the
other members of the squad, and
for the remainder of the game they
played hard, fast football. The
retirement of Tomasini, Palo Alto's
star player, on account of an injury
to his leg, materially weakened the
high school eleven, and thereafter
the Freshmen scored at will.
Although they won so easily
from Palo Alto, the playing of the
Freshman candidates in Satur
day's game revealed some weak
points which must be strengthened
before the team faces a really
strong adversary. Tomasini play
ed hard for his team, and his forty
yard run was the sensation of the
game. Clark of Palo Alto also
played a fast, aggressive game, but
the other high school players were
clearly inferior to their Freshman
opponents.
