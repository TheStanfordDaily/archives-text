# DR. GARDNER SPEAKS
## ANNIVERSARY OF DEDICATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. Ceremony Similar to That Held Fourteen Years Ago.—First Evening Service Held. 
### 
Services in commemoration of the
fourteenth anniversary of the dedi
cation of the University were held
in the Memorial Church yesterday
morning. The service was in many
respects the same as that used
fourteen years ago. The Scripture
lesson, taken from the fourth
chapter of Proverbs, which was
read by Dr. Jordan yesterday
morning, waß used in the dedica
tion, as were the prayer,the hymns,
and the text for the address.
Following a brief review of the
conditions at the time of the dedi
cation, and the changes that have
taken place since then, Dr. Gardner
•aid in part:
"Your real work lies outiide these
cloisters. My idea is that the
Stanford spirit, entering into the
very soul of your being, should
make, not only for personal success
and personal happiness,butthrough
your life an example for civic
righteousness and national pro
gress. Upon such an occasion I
can but touch briefly upon these
problems. And first I name our
duty to God's poor and the rela
tion of educated men and women
to industrial and social problems.
I want to speak of the Stanford col
lege settlement. 1 feel that the
time is ripening for some forward
movement, and some day soon I
shall ask for co-operation. I re
gard the establishment of a college
settlement as a natural expression
of the Stanford spirit. And it will
help to guard against a positive
danger. Ido not hesitate to say
that in these days so much is done
for youth that youth is apt to grow
selfish and self-centered.
"And another matter: our duty
to our country. America has taken
a first place in the council of the
nations. Upon her shoulders rests
a large share of the obligation to
maintain the cause of peace. It is
our high duty to strive to apply
the noblest moralities of duty to
the affairs of our own nation and
the commonwealth of nations.
And I feel very strongly that Stan
ford University should help the
nation by training and sending in
to the world not only competent
teachers and preachers, lawyers
and engineers, scientists and phil
osophers, but men for civil service
at home and abroad, men fitted by
education for diplomacy and
statesmanship."
The first of the series of evening
services was held at 8 o'clock last
night. The choir, under the di
rection of Dr. Blodgett, and as
sisted by Mrs. Sara Bibhy Brown,
soprano; Dr. G. B. Little, tenor;
and Mr. Charles Moser, bass,
rendered the first part of Haydn's
oratorio, " The Creation," to a con
gregation of over a thousand peo
ple.
