The notion that spirited rooting
from the bleachers is necessary for
the development of a fighting team
may be an exploded theory when
applied to practice periods, but
when a regulation game is in prog
ress the value of such support can
hardly be questioned. This year
we have three good yell leaders,
and the indifferent rooting at per
iods during the game on Saturday
can be partly attributed to the men
who seem too lazy to remove the
pipes and cigarettes from their
mouths long enough to give a
genuine cheer. At times when
Stanford made a series of brilliant
plays and was gaining, the rooters
seemed to rouse from their lethargy
and give a yell that had some life
it. But when Stanford was not
gaining and sensational plays were
not made, the bleachers dropped
into a stupor and mumbled the
yells, like the men of a certain
Eastern university who are not
noted for their enthusiasm or col
lege spirit. In the past the rooters
have lagged along until within a
few days of the hig games, when
they wake up and display credit
able spirit, at these contests. This
waking up ought to take place
much earlier in the season, es
pecially as all our preliminary
games are with other institutions
this year, and the bleacherw should
instill a fighting spirit in the men
that will remove any possibility of
defeat.
