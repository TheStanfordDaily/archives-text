Tub definite announcement that
the lumber for the completion of
the new football bleachers is now
in process of shipment will be re
ceived with a feeling of relief by
those who are anxious to see inter
collegiate events transferred to the
campus. In this connection it
may be noted that the Hoard of
Directors of the Training House
Corporation are in nowise to blame
for the many vexatious delays
which have marked the construc
tion of the new field. I'erhaps no de
lay was more irritating and utterly
useless than the loss of time caused
by the submission of Professor
Wing's plans to the judgment of a
second-rate engineer before they
were acceptable to the Board of
Trustees. Other delays equally
disheartening were caused by the
failure of various contractors to
fulfil their promises, and the final
success of the Board of Directors,
who have worked like Trojans
against these obstacles, is extremely
gratifying.
