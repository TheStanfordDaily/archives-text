# CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
## Committee Appointed to Confer with California Society and Draft Plans of Organization. 
### 
The Seniors and Juniors of the
Civil Engineering Department met
last night to discuss the organiza
tion of a civil engineering society.
L. L. Carter, '06, was appointed
temporary chairman, and he named
a committee of five, composed of
F. O. Shutts, '06, chairman, V. It.
Gartias, '06, G. S. Stroud, '06, R.
Foil, '07, and M. C. Burr, '07.
These men will confer with the so
ciety at California and investigate
the basis on which it is organized.
On their report the Stanford socie
ty will be definitely formed, and
will at once endeavor to secure the
presence of some distinguished out
side engineer to address the stu
dents and civil engineering faculty.
The establishment of this society
marks an advancement in the en
gineering work at Stanford, and
affiliation with the University of
California will bring the students
of this line of work closer together.
Lasi night's meeting was a result
of a letter received by Professor C.
I). Marx from the Civil Engineer
ing Society at the University of
California suggesting the organiza
tion of a like society at Stanford
and offering affiliation. The pur
pose of the society is the reading of
papers upon engineering questions
and the discussion of these papers.
