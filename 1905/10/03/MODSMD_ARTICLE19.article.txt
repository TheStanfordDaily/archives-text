# WOMEN'S TENNIS.
## Interclass Tournament Will Be Held on Roble Courts Next Saturday Morning. 
### 
The women students of the Uni
versity will hold an intercollegiate
tennis tournament on the Roble
courts Saturday morning, October
7th. The tournament is designed
especially to find out the new ma
terial in college, and to work up an
interest among the women players.
The Freshmen will begin to play
at 9 o'clock, and the other classes
will follow in order immediately
after. The preliminaries of all the
classes will be played first.
At the conclusion of the tourna
ment, a squad will be organized
for all who care to play, and a
special effort will be made to have
the times of practice so arranged
as to give the squad members
equal opportunity on the courts.
It is possible that two new courts
will be built in the near future,
should the squad be of such size as
to render them necessary for
practice.
All women students who play
tennis are eligible to enter the
tournament, and are requested to
hand their names to one of the fol
lowing committee before Friday
noon, October 6th: Miss EliseOwen,
'07, Miss Emma Hayward, '06, and
Miss Myrle Morris, '08.
