# New Bleachors Will Be Ready.
## 
### 
The Training House Corporation
has received a communication from
Manager Barrett, who left for Port
land last Saturday, to the effect
that the remainder of the lumber
for the bleachers is now being
shipped,or is en route. This means
that the bleachers will surely be
finished some time before the date
of the Varsity game, November
11th. The lumber was contracted
for in Portland and the shipment
is being made from that city.
