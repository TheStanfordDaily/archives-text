# ASSEMBLY TO-MORROW
## DR. JORDAN WILL SPEAK ON HIS RECENT TRIP. Interesting Discussion of Many European Conditions Observed by the President. 
### 
The second regular student body
Assembly of the semester will be
held to-morrow morning at 11:15
in Assembly Hall. The chief
speaker of the meeting will be
President David Starr Jordan, who
will give an interesting account of
his recent trip through England
and the continent of Europe. Dr.
Jordan started for Europe shortly
after the close of college last
semester, and returned early in the
month of September. To-morrow's
Assembly will be the occasion of
bis first appearance before the stu
dent body this semester, and he
will consequently address the mem
bers of the Freshman class for the
first time.
The subject of Dr. Jordan's ad
dress, and the manner in which he
will treat it, will make the Assem
bly of more than usual interest.
He has taken occasion to note dur
ing the course of his travels many
things that are of interest more
from the point of view of an Ameri
can college man than that of a
traveler, and this fact will appear
throughout the address. Besides
many points of interest that came
up during his travels through
France and Switzerland, Dr. Jor
dan will dwell particularly upon
the universities which he visited,
and the conditions of student life
prevalent among them, as well as
the systems upon which they are
run. An especially interesting
topic upon which he will speak
will be the status of athletics in
England, and the attitude that ia
manifested towards it in the Eng
lish universities, which differs very
much from that in America.
As all three of the regular yell
leaders for the semester have now
been appointed, the Assembly will
be made the occasion of the first
organized rooting and singing rally
of the year. It is probable that
several of the new songs will be
tried.
Although definite arrangements
have not been concluded, efforts
are being made to secure a promi
nent San Francisco alumnus for
the second speaker of the Assem
bly. In case he does not arrive
Dr. Jordan will be the only speaker.
