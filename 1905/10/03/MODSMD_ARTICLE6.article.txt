### 
Although the Boat Club have de
cided that they will not engage in
strict fall training at present, al
most all of the men who were can
didates for the crews last year are
working on the machines and do
ing cross-country running, in order
to put themselves in condition for
the hard work of the second semes
ter.
The members of the club are at
present hard at work "trying to
make their farce, "All Tangled
Up," a success, and there is a pos
sibility that after the production of
the play the oarsmen will keep in
trim by light practice at rowing on
the slough at Redwood.
In order to give the Freshmen
who intend rowing in the spring
the chance of preliminary training,
and also in order to interest as
many first-year men in rowing as
possible, the Boat Club has made
an arrangement with H. VV. Chap
pel to give all Freshmen who are
working in the gymnasium special
work upon the rowing machines.
Some of the old men who have had
experience will take charge of the
squads which are assigned to the
machines and as&ist in the instruc
tion.
Any Freshman who is not taking
gymnasium work and wishes to
have the benefit of fall training
will be assigned to a squad by ap
plying to E. V. Henley, '06, the
president of the Boat Club.
At present there is neither a
coach for the boating men nor a
captain of the Varsity crew. The
1905 Varsity crew neglected to elect
a captain for this year, and this
officer will be elected by the 1906
crew just before the intercollegiate
regatta. The question of a coach
will not be considered this semester
by the club, as only light training
