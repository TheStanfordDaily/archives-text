## PROF. R.L. GREEN WRITES COMMUNICATION. Recent Trouble with Residents of Encina Discussed by Member of the Faculty. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In view of the somewhat incom
plete accounts of the recent "dis
turbance" in Encina Hall which
have appeared in the Daily Palo
Alto, I desire to make a statement
and some comments which may
set the matter in a somewhat dif
ferent light in the minds of those
making up the University com
munity.
On Tuesday evening, September
26th, the lights in the club-room
of Encina Hall were turned out,
tables were overturned, chairs were
thrown across the floor, and what is
known as a "general rough-house"
was inaugurated. A little later
the center of operations was trans
ferred to the landings on the third
and fourth floors, above the lobby.
When a head appeared in the door
of the club-room, a volley of mis
siles was projected from the floors
above. Cuspidors, filled with
water, were used as projectiles in
the beginning, followed by board«,
boxes, and finally by bottles filled
with water. This fusilade was ac
companied by a great amount of
noise, which was plainly heard
upon the row and the quadrangle.
Two instructors, passing through
the lobby to their rooms, were nar
rowly missed by falling cuspidors.
Another instructor was unable to
reach his room, the way to which lay
near the line of fire, for over an
hour. Students of courage re
mained for an hour besieged in
the club-room, not considering it
advisable to attempt to eacape
through the falling missiles. A
number of persons narrowly es
caped injury.
After a careful inquiry, I can
positively assert that it was not the
intention of the participants to give
a realistic representation of an at
tack upon 203 Metre Hill being re
pulsed by hand-grenades; but on
the contrary, that they merely in
tended a delicate, diplomatic inti
mation to the Business Office that
a certain watchman waß persona
non grata at the court of Encina.
One matter which still puzzles me,
Mr. Editor, is the fact that the
bright men upon your staff failed
to appreciate the news value of an
adequate description of this affair
of Tuesday night.
Such an occurrence as this does
not "just happen," but >is always
