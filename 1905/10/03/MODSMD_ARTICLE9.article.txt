## PROF. R.L. GREEN WRITES COMMUNICATION. Recent Trouble with Residents of Encina Discussed by Member of the Faculty. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In view of the somewhat incom
plete accounts of the recent "dis
turbance" in Encina Hall which
have appeared in the Daily Palo
Alto, I desire to make a statement
and some comments which may
set the matter in a somewhat dif
ferent light in the minds of those
making up the University com
munity.
On Tuesday evening, September
26th, the lights in the club-room
of Encina Hall were turned out,
tables were overturned, chairs were
thrown across the floor, and what is
known as a "general rough-house"
was inaugurated. A little later
the center of operations was trans
ferred to the landings on the third
and fourth floors, above the lobby.
When a head appeared in the door
of the club-room, a volley of mis
siles was projected from the floors
above. Cuspidors, filled with
water, were used as projectiles in
the beginning, followed by board«,
boxes, and finally by bottles filled
with water. This fusilade was ac
companied by a great amount of
noise, which was plainly heard
upon the row and the quadrangle.
Two instructors, passing through
the lobby to their rooms, were nar
rowly missed by falling cuspidors.
Another instructor was unable to
reach his room, the way to which lay
near the line of fire, for over an
hour. Students of courage re
mained for an hour besieged in
the club-room, not considering it
advisable to attempt to eacape
through the falling missiles. A
number of persons narrowly es
caped injury.
After a careful inquiry, I can
positively assert that it was not the
intention of the participants to give
a realistic representation of an at
tack upon 203 Metre Hill being re
pulsed by hand-grenades; but on
the contrary, that they merely in
tended a delicate, diplomatic inti
mation to the Business Office that
a certain watchman waß persona
non grata at the court of Encina.
One matter which still puzzles me,
Mr. Editor, is the fact that the
bright men upon your staff failed
to appreciate the news value of an
adequate description of this affair
of Tuesday night.
Such an occurrence as this does
not "just happen," but >is always
led up to by a series of other
events. During the past two or
three weeks disorder in the Hall
has been constantly growing. The
Committee on Student Affairs un
dertook to investigate these disturb
ances and to send from the Hall
those responsible for them. On
Tuesday afternoon, before the affair
of the hand-grenades, five men were
asked to leave the Hall; a number
of others were interviewed and the
intimation given that they would
probably be sent after further in
quiry. These acts and previous
inquiries had created in the minds
of many men in the Hall the be
lief that the watchman was acting
as a spy for the committee, and
when the five men were sent out
Jon Tuesday the state of feeling in
the Hall was such that the affair
of Tuesday night resulted. The
diagnosis of the committee was that
a clear case of mob spirit existed in
Encina Hall, and that the riotous
spirit might go to greater excesses.
Instead of the patient inquiry
which had been going on for two
weeks, it appeared that something
much more drastic was needed to
bring the Hall to its normal state
of mind. The chairman of the
committee hastily made up a list
of men known or believed to have
I been concerned in some of the dis
turbances of the last two weeks, and
told them to leave the Hall before
night. The chairman refused to
hear or to consider any individual
case at that time. It was feared
during the day that not enough
men had been affected to quell the
riotous spirit in the Hall. How
ever, better counsels prevailed, and
during the succeeding evening the
men of the Hall determined at a
general meeting that all disturb
ances must cease. Following this
decision, the individuals who had
been asked to leave the Hall were
heard.
I

One remarkable manifestation of
the action of the committee was
the sudden and acute development
of the sense of justice on the part
of the entire student body. This I
consider one of the most valuable
consequences of the committee's
action. It will be still more valu
able should this sense of justice be
extended to the residents of the
Hall, whose lives have been made a
burden for several weeks. I should
like to see this sense of justice—or
at least a small part of it —extend-
ed to the cartman who, in the per
formance of his duty, has to visit
Encina Hall and who has frequent
ly been the recipient of buckets of
water, ink bottles, and othes mis
siles from the upper windows of
the dormitory. I might even plead
that a small portion of this sense
of justice might be extended to
Freshmen, and that they might be
permitted to exist in the Hall with
a chance to study and to remain
free from assault.
Concerning the employee of the
University who, in the minds of
the students, is now so generally
accredited as the cause of the dis
order in the Hall, I wish to say
that in my opinion his personality
should not enter into the affair.
So far as I can see, he has only
been following instructions and do
ing what he was hired to do. The
question is one of organization and
not of personalities; and I think
it is generally recognized now that
a serious mistake was made when
the argument upon this subject
was opened with hand-grenades.
This matter of organization will
doubtless in the near future be
considered and properly deter
mined by the Board of Trustees.
As a matter of record, I may give
the following statistics:
Suspended from the University. 2
Sent from the Hall 15
To remain on probation 6
Action rescinded 3
