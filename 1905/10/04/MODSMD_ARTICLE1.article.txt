# DR. JORDAN ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY
## TALKS ON HIS RECENT TRIP TO EUROPE. MANY INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS OF CONDITIONS ON THE CONTINENT. 
### 
At the Assembly this morning
Dr. Jordan was the only speaker,
the alumnus from San Francisco
being unable to leave the city. Dr.
Jordan spoke of his recent trip to
Europe, commenting chiefly upon
universities and athletics that he
learned of while abroad. He said
in part:
The Stanford men in England are
holding their own. Hoover, '95,
managing partner of the great min
ing firm of Bewick, Moreing & Co.,
is one of those to whom we "point
with pride" Extremely successful
also are William A. Brichard, '99,
and James H. Means,' 93, both in
business on their own account.
Knox, '95, and Dennis, '94, are also
well known in London as mining
engineers.
I was interested in phases of
English athletics. Among other
things is a cricket tournament,
county against county. A game
lasts about a week, and while it is
on, in the county, all other activi
ties are practically suspended. In
Canterbury, when Kent plays Sur
rey, not a room is to be had by an
outsider in hotel or boarding-house.
I saw a section of a game on Ken
nington Oval, between Surrey and
Middlesex. Besides the skill of the
bowlers and batsmen, one in most
impressed by the gentlemanly lei
sure of the game, the fielders are
too polite to hurry, and if, by
chance, a man is caught out on a
fly, the attitude is one of profuse
apology. If a bowler is too swift
for a batsman, the chances are that
he will retire,with a bow of depreca
tion. When a man is out he walks
with dignity to the clubhouse, noti
fies his successor, who steps to his
place in about ten minutes. No
unseemly haste, and, what is better,
no unseemly guying. An English
athlete is too much of a man to
guy an opponent or to dispute an
umpire. As in cricket, the ball
may be struck in any direction,
backwards as well as forwards, the
audience is very far from the center
of thegame. A tenderfoot, in Eng
land, accustomed to baseball, can
not see who is doing the playing,
nor very clearly what is done. But
the English audience understands
whether it sees or not, and any
man about you can "put you wise"
in a minute.
The most un-American feature of
the game is the afternoon tea. The
play stops at about four o'clock,
the players all adjourn to the club
house, ten thousand people are
given rain-checks, and they will
take the afternoon tea.
Dr. Jordan spoke briefly of the
organizations of the universities of
England:
Oxford and Cambridge are
groups of colleges, each something
like a boarding-school in America,

each something like a fraternity
house. The university proper is a
board, with a group of professors,
outside the colleges, but created by
them. It conducts examinations,
awards degrees, and in Cambridge
gives a large amount of advanced
instruction. Most of the university
professors in Oxford have no stu
dents.
London University and Victoria
University are organizations of
municipal universities and colleges.
These institutions are somewhat
frankly commercial. They have
no dormitories, they are supported
largely by city taxation. Birm
ingham, Manchester, Liverpool,
Leeds, Durham, and Sheffield, have
colleges of this sort, and London
has several coordinated as London
University. These lack the charm
of life in Oxford and Cambridge,
and they have less of the scholarly
spirit which Cambridge University
especially shows. But they do
good work, especially along scien
tific and engineering lines. In
some of these municipal universi
ties more than half the students
are women, and women are prac
tically admitted to all that is
worth while in Oxford or Cam
bridge. except that they are grant
ed no degrees.
Two great weaknesses are evi
dent in the English university sys
tem: First, the prevalence of sine
cures. Half the men supposed to
teach or conduct research do noth
ing of the kind. As one Oxford
man expresses it, "They draw their
stipends and simply soak."
The other is the dominance of
the examination. All the work is

done with reference to the exami
nation. The probable character of
the questions determines every
thing else. The examination in the
whole curriculum; hence, English
higher training is largely super
ficial, a matter of hooks and words,
the men learning to make a good
appearance, but without power or
skill to adapt themselves to new
conditions or to meet the more
searching and more varied exami
nation offered by the duties of life.
This is the secret of the success of
American engineers in London.
They are ready for whatever turns
up —not for the particular problem
it has taken three months to cram.
From the Oxford paper, called
the Varsity, I take these words:
"Oxford gives, and please heaven
will continue to give, a social hall
mark and training such as no other
place in the world can offer, and
happy are they who can avail
themselves thereof. Hut when we
come to look the hard facts of daily
bread and butter in the face, then
it is that many of us wish we had
not spent three or four previous
years in acquiring that which,
though delectable enough in itself,
as a commercial or monetary asset
is of peculiarly small value."

mark and training such as no other
place in the world can offer, and
happy are they who can avail
themselves thereof. Hut when we
come to look the hard facts of daily
bread and butter in the face, then
it is that many of us wish we had
not spent three or four previous
years in acquiring that which,
though delectable enough in itself,
as a commercial or monetary asset
is of peculiarly small value."

At the Assembly this morning
Dr. Jordan was the only speaker,
the alumnus from San Francisco
being unable to leave the city. Dr.
Jordan spoke of his recent trip to
Europe, commenting chiefly upon
universities and athletics that he
learned of while abroad. He said
in part:
The Stanford men in England are
holding their own. Hoover, '95,
managing partner of the great min
ing firm of Bewick, Moreing & Co.,
is one of those to whom we "point
with pride" Extremely successful
also are William A. Brichard, '99,
and James H. Means,' 93, both in
business on their own account.
Knox, '95, and Dennis, '94, are also
well known in London as mining
engineers.
I was interested in phases of
English athletics. Among other
things is a cricket tournament,
county against county. A game
lasts about a week, and while it is
on, in the county, all other activi
ties are practically suspended. In
Canterbury, when Kent plays Sur
rey, not a room is to be had by an
outsider in hotel or boarding-house.
I saw a section of a game on Ken
nington Oval, between Surrey and
Middlesex. Besides the skill of the
bowlers and batsmen, one in most
impressed by the gentlemanly lei
sure of the game, the fielders are
too polite to hurry, and if, by
chance, a man is caught out on a
fly, the attitude is one of profuse
apology. If a bowler is too swift
for a batsman, the chances are that
he will retire,with a bow of depreca
tion. When a man is out he walks
with dignity to the clubhouse, noti
fies his successor, who steps to his
place in about ten minutes. No
unseemly haste, and, what is better,
no unseemly guying. An English
athlete is too much of a man to
guy an opponent or to dispute an
umpire. As in cricket, the ball
may be struck in any direction,
backwards as well as forwards, the
audience is very far from the center
of thegame. A tenderfoot, in Eng
land, accustomed to baseball, can
not see who is doing the playing,
nor very clearly what is done. But
the English audience understands
whether it sees or not, and any
man about you can "put you wise"
in a minute.
The most un-American feature of
the game is the afternoon tea. The
play stops at about four o'clock,
the players all adjourn to the club
house, ten thousand people are
given rain-checks, and they will
take the afternoon tea.
Dr. Jordan spoke briefly of the
organizations of the universities of
England:
Oxford and Cambridge are
groups of colleges, each something
like a boarding-school in America,

each something like a fraternity
house. The university proper is a
board, with a group of professors,
outside the colleges, but created by
them. It conducts examinations,
awards degrees, and in Cambridge
gives a large amount of advanced
instruction. Most of the university
professors in Oxford have no stu
dents.
London University and Victoria
University are organizations of
municipal universities and colleges.
These institutions are somewhat
frankly commercial. They have
no dormitories, they are supported
largely by city taxation. Birm
ingham, Manchester, Liverpool,
Leeds, Durham, and Sheffield, have
colleges of this sort, and London
has several coordinated as London
University. These lack the charm
of life in Oxford and Cambridge,
and they have less of the scholarly
spirit which Cambridge University
especially shows. But they do
good work, especially along scien
tific and engineering lines. In
some of these municipal universi
ties more than half the students
are women, and women are prac
tically admitted to all that is
worth while in Oxford or Cam
bridge. except that they are grant
ed no degrees.
Two great weaknesses are evi
dent in the English university sys
tem: First, the prevalence of sine
cures. Half the men supposed to
teach or conduct research do noth
ing of the kind. As one Oxford
man expresses it, "They draw their
stipends and simply soak."
The other is the dominance of
the examination. All the work is

done with reference to the exami
nation. The probable character of
the questions determines every
thing else. The examination in the
whole curriculum; hence, English
higher training is largely super
ficial, a matter of hooks and words,
the men learning to make a good
appearance, but without power or
skill to adapt themselves to new
conditions or to meet the more
searching and more varied exami
nation offered by the duties of life.
This is the secret of the success of
American engineers in London.
They are ready for whatever turns
up —not for the particular problem
it has taken three months to cram.
From the Oxford paper, called
the Varsity, I take these words:
"Oxford gives, and please heaven
will continue to give, a social hall
mark and training such as no other
place in the world can offer, and
