# SONG AND YELL. SELECTED.
## Prizes Awarded to Successful Competitors for Beat Productions. 
### 
After considerable discission,
the judges of I lie song committee
awarded the first prize of ten dol
lars to P. C. Edwards, '0(5, for his
song, entitled "The Streak of Car
dinal," written to the tune of
"Funiculi, Funicula." The second
prize was awarded to Arch Perrin,
'06, and J. J. Sheehy, '06, authors
of "Berkeley's Kinieh," to the tune
of "Marguerite." "Loyal Stanford
Men," written by L. S. Levy, '08,
to the tune of "Handsome Harry,"
was awarded honorable mention.
"The Serpentine Song," music by
H. F. Curran, '06, and words by
P. C. Edwards, '06, was given hon
orable mention and recommended
for full publication in the annual
song-book because of its particular
merits as a characteristic Stanford
song.
The competition this year was
remarkable for the large number
of clever songs submitted, three of
them being Bet to special music
written by Stanford students. Ow
ing to the fact that heretofore some
songs which have been awarded
prizes have later been found to be
ill-adapted to bleacher singing, the
judges of the song contest gave the
four songs which they had reserved
a practical test. They were tried
out in Encina Hall before a crowd
ed club-room.
Immediately after the decision
of the prize song, the judges of the
yell met and awarded the prize to
E. A. Cunha, '06, whose yell con
sists in spelling the word Stanford
with different speed and emphasis,
and has been successfully tried out
on the bleachers.
