# PLUG UGLY SELECTED
## AWARDED TO L.M. EDWARDS, '07, AND W.F. HERRON, '08. Piece Entitled "Pirates" to Be Presented on Football Oval Friday, November 3d. 
### 
The Plug Ugly committee of the
Class of 1907 last evening selected
a two-act piece, entitled "Pirates,"
by L M. Edwards, '07, and W. F.
Herron, '08, for production Friday
evening, November 3d. Only two
manuscripts were submitted but
the committee found it difficult to
choose the better one because of the
equal merits of the two manuscripts.
There is a well-defined plot,
which is purely local, depicting
slightly exaggerated conditions at
Stanford. Much good-natured
raillery is interspersed throughout
the piece, and as usual some gentle
knocking is done. There will be
twenty-five characters in the cast.
The music forms one of the prin
cipal features of the show. There
are seven songs all distinctly local
in color and spirit, which afford
additional life. There is no dis
tinctly new song, as the words are
written in every instance to some
recent catchy air. The Plug Ugly
committee, assisted by Edwards
and Herron, will have charge of
presenting the piece.
The cast wasselected by the com
mittee and the respective parts as
signed, but these assignments will
not be announced until a later
date. The cast is composed en
tirely of 1907 men. Those selected
are: R. Bandini, H. P. Bittner, H.
T. Blood, N P. Bryan, W. A. Camp

order for the plugs, the date of the
Plug Ugly has been changed from

plugs are due to arrive here one
week before the presentation of
"Pirates."
