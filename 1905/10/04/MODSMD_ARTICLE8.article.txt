The communication which ap
peared in last night's Daily Pai.o
Ai ,to wan welcomed, for it is a com
plete account written fur the pur
pose of throwing a different light
on the recent disturbance in En
cina Hall. The description of the
siege of the watchman is probably
told more fully and graphically
than in Friday's issue of this paper,
when "the bright men of the staff
failed to appreciate the news value
of an adequate description of the
affair." However, the great peril in
which some of the instructors were
placed seems to be slightly exagger
ated, as men passed up the stairs
during the fusilade. The statement
that such an occurrence as this
"rough-house" does not " 'just hap
pen,' but is always led up to by a
series of other events," admits of no
denial. But are men to be punish
ed now, who took no part in the
affair of Tuesday night, because at
some time in the past they were
known to have transgressed the
rules? and if so, how far back does
the committee intend to go? A
year, as has been done in some
cases, seems more than a reasonable
distance, when a student litis not
misbehaved himself lately, and is
not warned or told that he is upon
probation. For there are stil I men
who a re numbered among the fifteen
who took no part in the late ''af
fair" and have not taken part in
any disturbance this semester.
There are men among this number
who were not "interviewed and the
intimation given that they would
probably be sent, after further in
quiry." A few men who were in
this category received letters of
apology, and were reinstated; but
there are more to whom this com
mendable action could be extended
without fear of allowing a guilty
man back in the Hall. "The sudden
and acute development of the sense
of justice on the part of the entire

j student body" which Professor
Green rightly considers "one of the
valuable consequences of the com
mittee's action," could very well he
extended to the committee itself in
dealing with a number of the cases
that remain.
Dealing specifically with the
watchman: he is still regarded as
being the main point, in the "series
of events" which "led up to" the
affair that did not "just happen."
The belief that he is a spy of the
committee is still entertained in
the minds of a few, as it was only
intimated, but not stated positively,
in the communication, that he does
not act in this capacity. We can
not agree with Professor Green
that the watchman's personality
should not enter into the affair.
His personality seems to have been
the immediate cause of the disturb
ance, and as such does unavoidably
enter materially into the affair.
Hut if, as Professor Green says, the
watchman has only been following
instructions and doing what lie
was hired to do, ihen there is some
thing radically wrong in the place
where he was given his instructions.
That the cause of the "Utbreak was
the actions of the watchman, and
that the watchman is not entirely
responsible, but the question is a
"matter of organization," is per
haps the correct solution; and we
heartily agree with Mr. Green, and
hope that in the near future the
matter of organization will be con
sidered and "properly determined"
by the Board of Trustees. But the
matter of dealing with the men who
were excluded from the Hall is a
matter apart from the organization
of which Mr. (ireen speaks, and it
lies within his power to make full
reparation.

heartily agree with Mr. Green, and
hope that in the near future the
matter of organization will be con
sidered and "properly determined"
by the Board of Trustees. But the
matter of dealing with the men who
were excluded from the Hall is a
matter apart from the organization
of which Mr. (ireen speaks, and it
lies within his power to make full
reparation.
