Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I ask your indulgence to
make reply to Professor Green's
statement of last evening anent the
trouble in Encina Hall?
First, to correct a few misstate
ments in Mr. Green's summary of
the affair of Tuesday night, mis
statements which are perhaps un
avoidable when one sees only
through the eyes of others. Ii is
true there was a "general rough
house" and that articles of many
descriptions rained from the upper
floors. It is not true that these
missiles were aimed at every head
that appeared in the door of the
club-room, which is the inference to
be drawn from Mr. Green's words.
That "students of courage" should
have deemed it safer to remain in
the club-room for an hour iB quite
remarkable, for other students who
have never been regarded as especi
ally lion-hearted did not hesitate
to pass back and forth, and their
life's blond was not spilled. That
an instructor should have been un
able to reach his room is equally
remarkable. May I suggest that
if the instructor's past dealings
with students had left him a clear
conscience, he had no more reason
to fear for his life than had the stu
dents of the lion hearts, previously
referred to? And, to be practical,
may I add that there are three
stairwayn to the upper floors of En
cina, two of which were far from
the "line of fire"? And had the
instructor forgotten that, there were
two fire-escapes to which he might
have taken as a last resort, assured
that if he clung firmly he would
reach his domicile sound in body
and limb?
The whole impression to be gain
ed from Mr Green's recital is one
of great danger to life and to prop
erty. But alas! when the smoke
of battle cleared away there were
no corpses, the noise had faded,
and a green hack of the value of
about ore dollar would probably
cover the material damage.
It is probably true that a "mob
spirit" prevailed in Encina. Men
had grown weary of the presence of
an ignorant and uncouth man ap
parently set up as guardian and
keeper of their morals and general
conduct. They were not content
to sit still under the insult of his
unbidden intrusion into their
rooms, and quiet residents of the
Hall chafed when from some recess
he flashed a dark-lantern upon
them as though they were common
criminals. To rid themselves of
such impertinences they were quite
willing to be considered a "mob,"
for that is what they call all men
who rise in revolt against imposi
tion put upon them by some arbi
trary authority. That the rebellion
broke before formal representations
were made to the President of the
University is to be regretted;equal
ly is it to be regretted that Mr.

Green's committee did not see tit to
inform the Encina men that it had
already suggested the removal of
the watchman.
Mr. Green's suggestion that the
man dues but act under his instruc
tions seem almost incredible.
Can it be the truth that a man of
this character, armed with a gun
and, it is generally averred, with a
considerable amount of "Dutch
courage," is set over the students to
imperil their lives?
As a climax to the trouble came
the action of Mr. Green's committee
following Tuesday night's demon
stration. Over a score of men were
ordered to leave the Hall before
nightfall. Mr. Green tells us "the
chairman refused to hear or to con
sider any individual case at that
time." We think it would be more
correct to say "the chairman at that
time refused to consider any indi
vidual case." Those whom he met
were informed that the action was
final, and he made no promises of
a rehearing Under the circum
stances, was it strange that there
was a sudden reawakening of the
sense of justice on the part of the
student body? Not even a Czar
nowadays condemns a man with
out trial, but a Stanford commit
tee had no hesitation. The com
mittee had to make a showing, and
eo proceeded to hang their men,
without even the comforting assur
ance that their memory might be
cleared by a post-mortem investi
gation. The injustice that might
have resulted had the committee,
not changed its mind and accorded
a trial to the accused is demon
strated by Mr Green's figures,
which show that of the men sent
from the Hall, nine have been al
lowed to remain, and, were full
justice done, many others of those
still on the condemned list, dis
missed on past records alone, would
be reinstated.

Mr. Green derives the greatest
comfort from his observation of the
revived and acute sense of justice
of the student body. To the writer
the most encouraging feature is the
frankness of Mr. Green and his
associates in making amends in so
far as their light has permitted
them, and their willingness to clar
ify the atmosphere by an open and
full discussion. This open discus
sion of what most concerns us is
something that has long been sorely
needed at Stanford Let us hope
that Mr. Green and his fellow mem
bers will continue in their appreci
ation of the keen sense of justice
which again animates the student
body, and us pray that they
will open their minds to its influ
ence. An Fncina Man.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I ask your indulgence to
make reply to Professor Green's
statement of last evening anent the
trouble in Encina Hall?
First, to correct a few misstate
ments in Mr. Green's summary of
the affair of Tuesday night, mis
statements which are perhaps un
avoidable when one sees only
through the eyes of others. Ii is
true there was a "general rough
house" and that articles of many
descriptions rained from the upper
floors. It is not true that these
missiles were aimed at every head
that appeared in the door of the
club-room, which is the inference to
be drawn from Mr. Green's words.
That "students of courage" should
have deemed it safer to remain in
the club-room for an hour iB quite
remarkable, for other students who
have never been regarded as especi
ally lion-hearted did not hesitate
to pass back and forth, and their
life's blond was not spilled. That
an instructor should have been un
able to reach his room is equally
remarkable. May I suggest that
if the instructor's past dealings
with students had left him a clear
conscience, he had no more reason
to fear for his life than had the stu
dents of the lion hearts, previously
referred to? And, to be practical,
may I add that there are three
stairwayn to the upper floors of En
cina, two of which were far from
the "line of fire"? And had the
instructor forgotten that, there were
two fire-escapes to which he might
have taken as a last resort, assured
that if he clung firmly he would
reach his domicile sound in body
and limb?
The whole impression to be gain
ed from Mr Green's recital is one
of great danger to life and to prop
erty. But alas! when the smoke
of battle cleared away there were
no corpses, the noise had faded,
and a green hack of the value of
about ore dollar would probably
cover the material damage.
It is probably true that a "mob
spirit" prevailed in Encina. Men
had grown weary of the presence of
an ignorant and uncouth man ap
parently set up as guardian and
keeper of their morals and general
conduct. They were not content
to sit still under the insult of his
unbidden intrusion into their
rooms, and quiet residents of the
Hall chafed when from some recess
he flashed a dark-lantern upon
them as though they were common
criminals. To rid themselves of
such impertinences they were quite
willing to be considered a "mob,"
for that is what they call all men
who rise in revolt against imposi
tion put upon them by some arbi
trary authority. That the rebellion
broke before formal representations
were made to the President of the
University is to be regretted;equal
ly is it to be regretted that Mr.

Green's committee did not see tit to
inform the Encina men that it had
already suggested the removal of
the watchman.
Mr. Green's suggestion that the
man dues but act under his instruc
tions seem almost incredible.
Can it be the truth that a man of
this character, armed with a gun
and, it is generally averred, with a
considerable amount of "Dutch
courage," is set over the students to
imperil their lives?
As a climax to the trouble came
the action of Mr. Green's committee
following Tuesday night's demon
stration. Over a score of men were
ordered to leave the Hall before
nightfall. Mr. Green tells us "the
chairman refused to hear or to con
sider any individual case at that
time." We think it would be more
correct to say "the chairman at that
time refused to consider any indi
vidual case." Those whom he met
were informed that the action was
final, and he made no promises of
a rehearing Under the circum
stances, was it strange that there
was a sudden reawakening of the
sense of justice on the part of the
student body? Not even a Czar
nowadays condemns a man with
out trial, but a Stanford commit
tee had no hesitation. The com
mittee had to make a showing, and
eo proceeded to hang their men,
without even the comforting assur
ance that their memory might be
cleared by a post-mortem investi
gation. The injustice that might
have resulted had the committee,
not changed its mind and accorded
a trial to the accused is demon
strated by Mr Green's figures,
which show that of the men sent
from the Hall, nine have been al
lowed to remain, and, were full
justice done, many others of those
still on the condemned list, dis
missed on past records alone, would
be reinstated.

Mr. Green derives the greatest
comfort from his observation of the
revived and acute sense of justice
of the student body. To the writer
the most encouraging feature is the
frankness of Mr. Green and his
associates in making amends in so
far as their light has permitted
them, and their willingness to clar
ify the atmosphere by an open and
full discussion. This open discus
sion of what most concerns us is
something that has long been sorely
needed at Stanford Let us hope
that Mr. Green and his fellow mem
bers will continue in their appreci
ation of the keen sense of justice
which again animates the student
body, and us pray that they
will open their minds to its influ
ence. An Fncina Man.
