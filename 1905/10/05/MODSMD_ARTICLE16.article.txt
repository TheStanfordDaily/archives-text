Editor Daily Palo Alto:
At the rink of becomimg weari
some to your readers, I desire to
make plain a few matters referred
to in your editorial. An examin
ation of memoranda enables me to
assert that every man sent from
the Hall, or permitted to remain
on probation, was given a hearing.
Nor was any man sent out of the
Hall for aot√ü done previous to the
present semester. Kvery man sent
was believed to have been concern
ed in acts of disorder during the
past month. In this connection I
may quote tbe written reasons giv
en in these cases:
"The reason for this somewhat
summary action is that your atti
tude. or your influence, or your
actions, have been such as to con
stitute, in my judgment, an ele
ment contributing to the disorder
which has prevailed in Encina
Hall for the past few weeks, and
which culminated in the riot of
Tuesday evening."
1 will grant that, under this gen
eral charge, probably fifty, possibly
seventy five, additional men should
have been sent from the Hall. I
also readily grant that full know
ledge would have enabled the com
mittee to make a selection of twen
ty-one men that would he far more
satisfactory to our ''sense of jus
tice" than the twenty-one upon
which action was taken. I wish
also to say, after a somewhat criti
cal inspection of the twenty-one,
that they appear to me very much
like many another set of twenty
one men who could be picked up
on the campus; and that a number
of them have impressed me as very
manly fellows. Nevertheless, 1
think they ought to have been dis
ciplined as they were disciplined,
and if there is an element of vicari
ous punishment in their cases,
which offends the sense of justice
of some students, I can only point
out that this occurs through no de
sire of the committee, but through
the sense of honor or loyalty which
causes these same students to con
spire to withhold the only know
ledge which would enable ub to
impose even-handed punishment.
