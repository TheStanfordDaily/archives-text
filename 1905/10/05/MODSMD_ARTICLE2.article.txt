# LUMBER FOR NEW BLEACHERS.
## Manager Barrett Goes to Portland to Hurry Its Shipment. 
### 
Up to this week the Training
House Corporation, in spite of the
many confident reports which were
given out, had very grave doubts
as to the completion of the new
bleachers in time for the intercol
legiate game. The lumber, which
had been contracted for in Port
land, had not heen shipped, nor
was there any immediate prospect
of its shipment. Unless this lum
ber was all shipped by Saturday,
October 7th, there would be no
hope for the completion of the
bleachers on time.
The cause of the delay in Port
land was a scarcity of freight-cars,
there being a congestion of two
hundred and fifty carloads in that

city. Manager Barrett was sent to
Portland .Saturday morning to do
all he could to relieve the situation.
On Monday he wired the corpor
ation that two carloads of lumber
had been shipped, and that he had
been promised cars enough to put
all the lumber on the road by Fri
day night. This means that the

bleachers will purely he completed,
unless for some unforeseen reason
the railroad fails to live up to its
promise to furnish the cars.
