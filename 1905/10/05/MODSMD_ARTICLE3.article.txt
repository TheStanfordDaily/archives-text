# SEATING OF ALUMNI
## SPECIAL SECTION RESERVED AT BIG GAME. Charles F. Wright, '96, Making Arrangements for the Accommodation of Former Students. 
### 
Charles F. Wright, '96, secretary
of the Stanford Alumni Association,
ha√ü completed arrangements for the
reservation of a special block of
seats for the Stanford Alumni, for
mer students, and their friends, at
the intercollegiate game with the
University of California on Novem
ber 11th. The seats to be reserved
will be on the Stanford side of the
bleachers, between the center of the
field and the Stanford rooting sec
tion.
The price of each ticket will be
two dollars and fifty cents, and pay
ment must be made in advance to
secure the reservation of seats in
this section. All orders should be
sent directly to Mr. Wright before
the thirteenth of this month so that
he will have plenty of time to ar
range for the seating. As soon as
the tickets are purchased they will
be mailed by him to the different
alumni.
Last year at the game with the
University of California this plan
was carried out very successfully
on short notice, and as the game is
on the new field this year it is ex
pected that the crowd in the alum
ni section will be much larger than
usual.
The night before the game many
of the alumni of the different classes
will hold reunions and banquets
in the city and on the campus.
Plans are already being made for
these affairs, and it is thought that
a great many former students will
revisit the University at the time
of the big game.
In the last number of the Alum
nus Mr. Wright has an article ad
dressed to the alumni telling of the
plan to reserve special seats for
them. He discussed the plan in
detail, and already numerous or
ders have been received by him.
