# TO HANDLE BIG CROWD
## RAILROAD MAKES ARRANGEMENTS FOR VARSITY GAME. Failure to Build New Spur Due to Adverse Action of the University Trustees. 
### 
The committee appointed by the
Training Houße Corporation to con
fer with the Southern Pacific Com
pany met the representativeß of the
railroad in San Francisco Tues
day. Plans for handling the
crowds on the day of the Varsity
game were thoroughly discussed,
and while no definite arrangements
were made, the committee feels that
the crowds will be handled smooth
ly and successfully. It can, how
ever, lie definitely announced that
the railroad will not make use of
the spur from May field to the Uni
versity. All the people will he
landed in Palo Alto, and the chief
difficulty will lie in relieving the
congestion which will center around
the Palo Alto station.
Jt was the original* intention of
the Training House Corporation to
bring the people directly to the new
athletic field. With this end in
view, they consulted the operating
department of the railroad early
in the summer. The railroad
made a thorough inventigation and
decided that it would be necessary
to build a Y-switch running from
the main line near Mayfield,
through the Evergreen Park tract,
and along the line of the County
road. Passing the new athletic
field, this switch would curve back
to the University spur.
This plan would have been per
fectly feasible but would have ne
cessitated the extension of the Uni
versity spur into a loop in order to
run the excursion trains around
without congestion at the end of
the switch.
The first objection to this plan
was found in the refusal of the
University trustees to purchase a
strip of land through the Evergreen
Park tract necessary for the right
of way. To remove this difficulty
the Training House Corporation
stepped forward and offered to pur
chase the land themselves. Ar
rangements were completed for the
transfer, and it seemed as though
the time had come for the San
Francisco operating department to
pass its plans to the Chicago head
quarters for approval.
Unfortunately these delays took
up a great deal of time, and there
would have been barely time
enough to complete the switch up
on the approval of the plans. Here
again the trustees intervened, and
absolutely refused to grant the
right of way necessary for building
the loop extension to the Univer
sity. There was no time left for
argument or persuasion, and the
Training House Corporation in
despair wrote to the Southern Pa
cific that the plans would have to
be given up and the crowds car
ried direct to Palo Alto.
