# TRACK MEN WORKING
## LARGE NUMBER ARE OUT FOR FALL TRAINING. Ten Veterans Will Be Ready to Open Season Next Spring.—Out-look Bright. 
### 
Fall training on the track is be
ing carried on in earnest. For
the last two weeks there have been
more than fifty men out every
day. Nearly all the point winners
of last year's team who are now in
college are doing fall training.
This includes Captain Macfarland,
'07, L. G. Russell, '06, A. C. Free
man, '06, C. F. Elwell, '07, L. M.
Edwards, '07, \V. T. McNeil, '07,
and 11. A. Kocher, '08. J. O.Miller,
'08, and H. L. Horton, '08, the two
largest individual point winners in
the last intercollegiate meet, are
not training yet. Miller is not
in college this semester, but will
return Christmas; and Horton is
now out for football.
Prom the present outlook there
will be ten of last year's point win
ners when the season begins next
spring. In last year's intercollegi
ate meet these ten took 33§ points,
so this is a very good nucleus to be
gin with. There are also several
men out for fall training who, al
though they took no places in last
year's meet, gave promise of being
future point winners. Among
these are C. L. Sever}', '08, P. M.
Davis,'oB, A. H. Friedman, '08,
W. C. Shelton, '08, and C. I).
Giebel, '08.
With this number of old men
and several promising Freshmen,
the outlook is bright. In speaking
of the fall work ''Dad" Moulton
said: <l I am pleased with the num
ber of men out and the energetic
way in which they are working.
There is some promising material
among the Freshmen, but what I
need is more weight men and
sprinters."
There will probably be a handi
cap field meet sometime in Novem
ber, to give Trainer Moulton and
Captain Macfarland a chance to
get a line on the new men. The
uross-country men have not taken
a run for some days, but will prob
ably do a little work on next Sat
urday morning.
