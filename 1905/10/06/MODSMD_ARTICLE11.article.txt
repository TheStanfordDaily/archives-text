# BASKET-BALL MEN AT WORK.
## Schedule of Games Now Being Arrangedâ€”Good Prospects for a Fast Team. 
### 
The line-up of the first basket
ball team as it has been playing in
practice is as follows: L. M. Ed
wards, '07, center; P. B. Delano,
'08, \V. H. Masters, '09, forwards;
G. L. Presley,'o7, R. H. Bookmeyer,
'08 (captain), backs. The squad
has been reduced to about twelve
men, and as most of the games will
be played off the compus, the
number will be further reduced be
fore the final squad is selected.
The first games will probably be
played early in November, and a
definite schedule will be arranged
as soon as possible." L. M. Ed
wards, '07, manager, is in receipt
of several letters expressing the
wishes of teams to meet the Stan
ford Basket-ball team. The men
who are playing basket-ball here
at present have no right to be
known as the Stanford team, as
they are not recognized by the Ex
ecutive Committee as such.
Two years ago Stanford had a
team which traveled under the
name of the Stanford Gymnasium
team, and played an intercollegi
ate game with the University of
California; but last year the men
who played here used simply the
name of the Encina Gymnasium.
But one game was played, and that
with the San Jose Young Men's
Christian Association, which the
Encina men won, 21-3.
The prospects this year are en
couraging for a fast, able team,
which will play good basket-ball.
There is much good material in the
entering class, and this together
with experienced men ought to de
velop a winning team.
