# NEW FIELD FOR WOMEN
## GROUNDS FOR FEMININE SPORTS WILL BE ERECTED. Tennis and Basket-Ball Courts to Be Built with Girls' Athletic Fund. 
### 
Within a few months ground
will be broken for a girls' athletic
field to be located in the field south
west of Roble Hall. The prelimi
nary survey was made last May,
when several acres were set aside
for the grounds. Provision was
made for about six acres for pres
ent purposes, and a larger plot for
any need for enlargement that may
arise.
It is planned to begin work on
the field soon after the first rains,
so that by spring it will be well
under way. The work will be com
menced with the construction of
tennis and basket-ball courts.
These will be enclosed with high
fences, and hedges will be planted
to secure perfect privacy to the
grounds. There will be no build
ings erected for a time, as the
smallness of the girls' athletic fund
will not permit any heavy expendi
tures. The field will be sufficiently
near the Roble gymnasium to al
low its use in connection with the
sports carried on there.
The funds which will be used for
building the field are being col
lected chiefly from student body
assessments paid by the women
students of the University, under
the clause of the constitution pro
viding that one-half of the assess
ments paid by the women go toward
an athletic fund for them. Since
this ruling has been in operation
$195 has been set aside for that
purpose, this sum being half the
assessments paid by the women
this semester. The fund will be
further increased by the January
assessment, and it is probable that
the Training House Corporation
will contribute from its fund. As
fast as money is available the field
will be built until it will become
suitable for all branches of girls'
athletics.
