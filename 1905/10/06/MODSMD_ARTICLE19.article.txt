In regard to Professor Green's
statement that every man was giv
en a hearing, it is well to keep in
mind that this hearing was given
only after sentiment had become so
strong against his action that it
seemed advisable. And further
more, there are men who are still
out of Encina Hall who had the
benefit of this hearing and are still
at a loss for a definite reason why
they should not be reinstated. Pro
fessor Green says, "Nor was any
man sent out of the Hall for acts
done previous to this semester." If
this is the case, then there are men
who are out of the Hall for no acts
at all, for they have committed
none this semester. Thev must
come under the category of the
sweeping reason behind which Pro
fessor Green intrenches himself.
They probably are included in the
number of men whose attitude, in
fluence or fictions "have been such
as to constitute an element contrib
uting to the disorder." Under this
sweeping category we agree with
Professor Green that "probably
fifty, possibly seventy-five, addi
tional men should have been sent
from the Hall." The figures could
probably be extended without fear
of hurting his ''sense of justice."
Also men who do not live in the
Hall could very well be included
in this sweeping charge. The
statement by Professor Green that
"every man sent was believed to
have been concerned in acts of dis
order during the past month," in
dicates the foundation upon which
the whole action was taken —belief.
Belief is very poor underpinning
for such action. Hut what offends
most of all in the last communica
tion is the thought that Professor
Green should expect one student to
tell on another. That he should
cast a reflection at the true honor
which prevents one man from tell
ing on another is beyond com pre

hension. Any person who would
tell on another is not worthy to be
a Stanford student, for here they
turn out men and not "tattle-tales"
and spies.
