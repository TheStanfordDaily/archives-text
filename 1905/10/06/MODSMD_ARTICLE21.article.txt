# WORK ON GYMNASIUM
## BUILDING WILL NOT BE BEADY BEFORE NEXT SEPTEMBER. Ball-Room Completed.—All Outside Work Finished.-Inside Work to Be Done. 
### 
Work on the Gymnasium is pro
gressing steadily, and if continued
at the present rate the building will
probably be ready for use by next
September. The edifice is con
structed on a large scale through
out, making the Gymnasium the
largest in the United States, and
second in size to none in Europe
except that at Berlin. The space
occupied by the structure measures
298 by 178 feet, and the total floor
area on the first floor is 39,748
square feet.
The quarter-mile track, which
according to the general opinion
was to have been built indoors, will
be built outside immediately lie
hind the building. This track,
however, will be covered like the
one in connection with the gymna
sium of the University of Pennsyl
vania. When the completion of
the covered track has been effected,
all the work on the outside will be
finished, as the building of the
track is the only outside work now
left to be done.
Much work, however, is yet to be
done on the inside before the build
tng will be ready for occupancy.
The rooms on the ground floor are
at present about half finished.
Moßt of the plastering has been
done, but none of the cement floor
ing has been laid. The stone walls
of the swimming tank, which is
built in the east side of this floor,
are completed, but the floor of the
tank has not been laid. The length
and width of the tank are fifty and
thirty feet respectively; the depth
will slope from four and one-fifth to
nine feet. Hot water will be used
in the tank,for which purpose pock
ets are provided through which the
steam will be forced for the pur
pose of heating the water.
This room will contain bath-tubs
and showers also, and along the
walls 1000 lockers will be built.
This room will be finished in white
enameled tile.
At the south end of the building
on the ground floor space, is re
served for a boiler-room. The or
iginal intention had been a special
building for this purpose in the
rear of the Gymnasium, but a re
cent alteration in the plane result
ed in this change. On this same
floor there art drying-roomß wound
in steam coils, rubbing- and heat
ing-rooms.
At the north side of the building
on the same floor space is reserved
for any possible future extension
of the basement rooms, but which
at present will be used for bicycle
storage.
All of the basement floor west of
the front entrance, and part of the
space at the south side, will be re
served for hand-ball courts and
bowling alleys. Four hand-ball
courts will be provided. The height
of the walla of these courts is 37
feet. One of them is provided
with a spectators' gallery on the
second floor 17 feet above the
ground. The hand-ball courts will
be provided with wooden floors in
stead of the cement which is used
elsewhere in the basement. Three
bowling alleys will be built, leaving

enough space to build two more of
official measurements. The iron
stairways have been completely in
stalled with the exception of the
banisters.
The entrance of the second floor
will, when finished, be the most
beautiful room in the building.
The floor will be of mosaics, the
wainscot is oak, and the walls will
be marble. A hallway well light
ed by huge windows opens from
the west side of the entrance. The
hall leads to a trophy-room, the li
brary of the Hygiene department,
and a council chamber for the Uni
versity trustees. The back part of
the building on this floor is divid
ed into five rooms to be used for
the office of the resident physician,
who. will be placed in charge
of the health affairs of the Gym
nasium.
The drill floor located on the
east side of the building, and open
ing from the east side of the second
floor entrance, is 100 feet square.
A spectators' gallery on the third
floor surrounds and overlooks the
drill space. Three rooms open
from the back of the drill-room.
These will be devoted to wrestling,
fencing and boxing.
The third floor of the building is
occupied by the entrance hall, ball
room, spectators' gallery overlook
ing the drill floor, and the special
apparatus rooms. A dome sky
light of stained glass is above the
entrance. To the west of the en»
trance is the ball-room. The di
mensions of the dancing floor are
the same as those of the gymnasium
drill floor. This room is unceiled,
enabling it to be more readily dec
orated. The walls are finished in
green, and the wainscot is of the
uniform oak color. The patronesses'
booth is in an ell-corner of the
room, two carved arches leading
from the dance-room. Back of the
dance-room are hat- and cloak
rooms, and a banquet hall 100 by
33 feet.
The spectators' gallery above the
drill floor is on the east side of the
building. The back part of this
gallery opens into the rooms de
signed for special apparatus work.
As the building now stands the
rooms entirely finished are the
hallways of the two upper stories,
the ball-room, banquet hall and
cloak-rooms, trustees'council cham
ber, physician's office, and the
special apparatus rooms. The
plumbing, which will require prob
ably three months' time, has not
been started. A good deal of the
flooring, plastering and cementing
is yet to be done, besides the
placing of the steam coils and the
wiring of the buildings.
