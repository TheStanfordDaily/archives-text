# FRESHMEN PLAY FAST
## BELMONT DEFEATED BY SCORE OF 17-11. In the Most Sensational Preliminary Game of the Season First-year Men Show Good Form. 
### 
By a score of 17-11 the Fresh
men yesterday defeated the foot
ball team of Belmont on the grid
iron of the military academy. The
Freshmen made two touch-downs
in the first half, Crawford kicking
both goals, and in the last three
minutes of play in the second half
scored the third and last touch
down, which Crawford fh iled to
convert into a goal. Belmont
scored a touch-down in each half,
kicking the second goal. At the
end of each half within the last
minute of play the Freshmen had
the hall on Belmont's 5-yard line,
and would have scored two ad
ditional touch-downs if the referee's
whistle had not ended the respec
tive halves.
The game wa9 replete with sen
sational plays. Holman scored
the first touch down for the Fresh
men after one minute of play. He
received Miller's kick-off on the '20-
yard line and ran through a scat
tered field for a touch-down. A
few mil ,tes later Miller for Bel
mont rail 70 yards on a tackle
back play, scoring five points for
the preparatory school. In the
second half Belmont almost scored
a touch-down on a quarter-back
kick, which was manoeuvered with
such skill by Woodbury that the
Freshmen were not aware for a
moment what was transpiring.
The work of Crawford and Cuth
bertson was sensational because
they were called on repeatedly to
carry the ball and never failed to
gain the required yards.

erees, Lull, '09, Goudy, '06; um
pires, Major Collins, Belmont, and
Rook, '06; timekeeper, Mcintosh,
'06. Time of halves, 20 minutes
each.
The Freshman back-field was at
all times able to plunge through
the line, but on the defensive they
were not so strong. The line as a
whole was stronger yesterday than
ever before, the ends being the only
weak part. Thus far no ends of
special ability have been devel
oped.
In the fust half Goodell was fre
quently called upon to punt, and
never failed to send the ball high
and far down the field. Toward
the end of the second half Torney

relieved Stolz at left half and did
the punting for the Freshmen.
The Freshmen were slow in get
ting their plays started, giving Bel
mont enough time to decide the di
rection of the buck. This was the
most noticeable weakness of the
playing of the Freshmen. Both
teams played hard ball on the of
fensive, hut slackened when their
opponents secured possession.
Belmont made most of her gains
on tandem formations which alter
nated first on one side and then on
the other side of the line.
Half-back Miller of Belmont was
the star player of his school in the
back-field, while Morgan's playing
in the line caused favorable men
tion because of his defensive work
and accuracy at tackling. Wood
bury showed himself to be a cool
and heady quarter-back, but un
fortunately for both teams he de
layed the game on several occa
sions, demanding in a loud and
disagreeable manner that Belmont
receive the questioned yards. His
actions and expressions were the
only unpleasant features of the
game.
Miller kicked off for Belmont to
the 20-yard line, and Holman ran
90 yards for a touch-down. Craw
ford kicked the goal. Score 6-0.
Miller kicked off a second time
to the 20-yard line, and Holman
returned the ball 5 yards. First
down was made by Stolz and Ter
rill on two bucks. Two tackle plays
added 6 more yards. Stoiz re
covered a fumble and Crawford
punted 25 yards. Belmont secured
the ball on a fumble and Miller
ran 70 yards for a touch-down on a
tackle play, but failed to kick the
goal. Score 6-5.
Crawford kicked off 35 yards,
and Woodbury was downed in his
tracks. Miller punted 40
and Holman returned it 3. On an
exchange of punts the Freshmen
gained 10 yards. Goodell kicked
35 yards, Belmont fumbled and
the Freshmen secured the ball. A
series of six tackle-back plays gained
16 yards. Stolz made 5 yards, but
this was lost through off-side play
of the Freshmen. The Freshmen
lost the ball on Belmont's 2-yard
line, and Miller kicked 25 yards
and out of bounds. The Freshmen
advanced the ball to the 10-yard
line only to lose it again on third
down due to a penalization of 5
yards for off-side. Goodell and
Miller exchanged punts, and the
Freshmen lost 15 yards for hold
ing. Goodell punted 50 yards.
Rook, '06, and Goudy, '06, were
here substituted as officials for
Major Collins and Lull, '06. A
series of tackle-back plays brought
the ball to the 2-yard line, and
Goodell was sent over for a touch
down Crawford kicked the goal.
Score 12-5. No further scoring in
the first half.
Crawford kicked over the goal
line and Miller punted from the
25-yard line for 40 yards, which
Goodell returned for 15 yards. The
ball alternated from one side to the
other and finally Miller made a
touch-down by forcing through
tackle for 15 yards. He also
kicked the goal. Score 12-11.
Crawford kicked off for 40 yards
and Belmont returned it for 4 yards
on two downs and then punted 30
yards, the ball rolling an addition
al 10. Holman returned it 10
yards. By a repetition of the tackle
back play the ball was advanced
40 yards. Holman made 6 on a
quarter-back play and Torney was

sent over for the third and last
touch down. Crawford missed the
goal. Final score 17-11.
With two minutes to play, Craw
ford kicked off and Belmont being
unable to buck the line for a second
time the quarter-back kick was
tried and almost ended disastrous
ly for Belmont, for Blood caught
the ball and ran it to the 5-vard
line, where the game ended.

'06. Time of halves, 20 minutes
each.
The Freshman back-field was at
all times able to plunge through
the line, but on the defensive they
were not so strong. The line as a
whole was stronger yesterday than
ever before, the ends being the only
weak part. Thus far no ends of
special ability have been devel
oped.
In the fust half Goodell was fre
quently called upon to punt, and
never failed to send the ball high
and far down the field. Toward
the end of the second half Torney

relieved Stolz at left half and did
the punting for the Freshmen.
The Freshmen were slow in get
ting their plays started, giving Bel
mont enough time to decide the di
rection of the buck. This was the
most noticeable weakness of the
playing of the Freshmen. Both
teams played hard ball on the of
fensive, hut slackened when their
opponents secured possession.
Belmont made most of her gains
on tandem formations which alter
nated first on one side and then on
the other side of the line.
Half-back Miller of Belmont was
the star player of his school in the
back-field, while Morgan's playing
in the line caused favorable men
tion because of his defensive work
and accuracy at tackling. Wood
bury showed himself to be a cool
and heady quarter-back, but un
fortunately for both teams he de
layed the game on several occa
sions, demanding in a loud and
disagreeable manner that Belmont
receive the questioned yards. His
actions and expressions were the
only unpleasant features of the
game.
Miller kicked off for Belmont to
the 20-yard line, and Holman ran
90 yards for a touch-down. Craw
ford kicked the goal. Score 6-0.
Miller kicked off a second time
to the 20-yard line, and Holman
returned the ball 5 yards. First
down was made by Stolz and Ter
rill on two bucks. Two tackle plays
added 6 more yards. Stoiz re
covered a fumble and Crawford
punted 25 yards. Belmont secured
the ball on a fumble and Miller
ran 70 yards for a touch-down on a
tackle play, but failed to kick the
goal. Score 6-5.
Crawford kicked off 35 yards,
and Woodbury was downed in his
tracks. Miller punted 40
and Holman returned it 3. On an
exchange of punts the Freshmen
gained 10 yards. Goodell kicked
35 yards, Belmont fumbled and
the Freshmen secured the ball. A
series of six tackle-back plays gained
16 yards. Stolz made 5 yards, but
this was lost through off-side play
of the Freshmen. The Freshmen
lost the ball on Belmont's 2-yard
line, and Miller kicked 25 yards
and out of bounds. The Freshmen
advanced the ball to the 10-yard
line only to lose it again on third
down due to a penalization of 5
yards for off-side. Goodell and
Miller exchanged punts, and the
Freshmen lost 15 yards for hold
ing. Goodell punted 50 yards.
Rook, '06, and Goudy, '06, were
here substituted as officials for
Major Collins and Lull, '06. A
series of tackle-back plays brought
the ball to the 2-yard line, and
Goodell was sent over for a touch
down Crawford kicked the goal.
Score 12-5. No further scoring in
the first half.
Crawford kicked over the goal
line and Miller punted from the
25-yard line for 40 yards, which
Goodell returned for 15 yards. The
ball alternated from one side to the
other and finally Miller made a
touch-down by forcing through
tackle for 15 yards. He also
kicked the goal. Score 12-11.
Crawford kicked off for 40 yards
and Belmont returned it for 4 yards
on two downs and then punted 30
yards, the ball rolling an addition
al 10. Holman returned it 10
yards. By a repetition of the tackle
back play the ball was advanced
40 yards. Holman made 6 on a
quarter-back play and Torney was

sent over for the third and last
touch down. Crawford missed the
goal. Final score 17-11.
With two minutes to play, Craw
ford kicked off and Belmont being
unable to buck the line for a second
time the quarter-back kick was
tried and almost ended disastrous
ly for Belmont, for Blood caught
the ball and ran it to the 5-vard
line, where the game ended.
By a score of 17-11 the Fresh
men yesterday defeated the foot
ball team of Belmont on the grid
iron of the military academy. The
Freshmen made two touch-downs
in the first half, Crawford kicking
both goals, and in the last three
minutes of play in the second half
scored the third and last touch
down, which Crawford fh iled to
convert into a goal. Belmont
scored a touch-down in each half,
kicking the second goal. At the
end of each half within the last
minute of play the Freshmen had
the hall on Belmont's 5-yard line,
and would have scored two ad
ditional touch-downs if the referee's
whistle had not ended the respec
tive halves.
The game wa9 replete with sen
sational plays. Holman scored
the first touch down for the Fresh
men after one minute of play. He
received Miller's kick-off on the '20-
yard line and ran through a scat
tered field for a touch-down. A
few mil ,tes later Miller for Bel
mont rail 70 yards on a tackle
back play, scoring five points for
the preparatory school. In the
second half Belmont almost scored
a touch-down on a quarter-back
kick, which was manoeuvered with
such skill by Woodbury that the
Freshmen were not aware for a
moment what was transpiring.
The work of Crawford and Cuth
bertson was sensational because
they were called on repeatedly to
carry the ball and never failed to
gain the required yards.
