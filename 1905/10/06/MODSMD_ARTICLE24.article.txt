# Communication.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Again I ask the favor of space
in your columns for a few words
of comment on Mr. Green's second
communication. The purpose of
this is not to prolong a controversy,
but merely the desire of Enoina
men that the facts as they see them
may not be obscured by Mr. Green's
words. TheEncina men have been
conservative in their statements,
and they desire to see ''the hooks
kept straight'' to (he end.
It is quite true, as Mr. Green
says, that every man sent from the
Hall was given a hearing. But
when? Was he called up and
questioned before he was dismissed?
Not at all; hie guilt was assumed,
and he was condemned. Then only,
after the man was hanged, as we
have said before, did Mr. Green's
committee agree to investigate and
find out if the victim really had
blood on his hands.
Hall men regret that they cannot
accept Mr. Green's statement that
no man has been sent out of the
Hall "for acts done previous to the
present semester." Some of the
victims deny participation in any
trouble, and we are informed that
Mr. Green has not been able to pro
duce any evidence to the contrary;
and evidence, and not beliefs,should
count.
But Mr. Green's written reasons
for his "somewhat summary" dis
missals would do honor to a Chi
nese diplomat; there would seem to
be very little under the sun his
phrases would not cover. Mr.
Green informs the unhappy victim,
apparently in all seriousness, that
his attitude, or his influence, or his
actions, have been such as to con
stitute, in Mr. Green's judgment,
an element contributing to the dis
order. And we believe Mr. Green
took into account not only positive
elements, but negative elements as
well, so that any man who had
failed to suppress any "rough
house" of which he might have
known,was of consequence himself a
disturbing element With this won
derful interpretation, Mr. Green is
quite right in assuming that he
might have drawn the rope around
many more necks; he might, in
deed, have issued a general order
of execution.
Mr. Green, after a critical in
spection of the twenty-one, tells us
that they appear to him very much
like another set of twenty-one who
could be picked up on the campus.
This was what we had suspected
from the start: in the emergency,
all students looked alike to Mr.
Green. This rather reminds us of
the Oriental method of satisfying
the great powers after a few white
missionaries have been killed off
by the natives. The native govern
ment doesn't bother much about
catching the murderers â€”all they
need is heads; so they go out to
the streets or the jails, seize a few
wretched coolies, cut them up, and
present the remains to the nations.
Of course this is a little disagree
able for the coolies, but the powers
are satisfied.
Mr. Green's conclusion is some
what surprising, and even disagree
able. Does Mr. Green think that
the men he had before him should
have turned state's evidence, even
to save themselves from unjust
punishment? Did Mr. Green ask
them to do that? The world has a
thorough contempt even for the
common criminal who telis on his
partner to escape prison; what

would be Mr. Green's opinion of
the college man who told of the
petty offenses of his companions?
Eneina, we think, harbors few men
of this character, and we mupt re
gret that Mr. Green sees fit to term
this sense of "honor or loyalty" a
"conspiracy." Encina seeks to
produce men, not sneaks.
An Encina Man Again.
