# CUTS RECEIVED BY LIBRARY.
## Collection Is Growing and Work of Assortment Will Soon Begin. 
### 
The work of establishing a cut
repository in the University
Library is well under way. All
cuts of people or scenes in any way
connected with the University are
being gathered together, and Li
brarian Dodge is well pleased with
the number already turned in.
Archie Rice,'9s, editor of the Alum
nus last year, has sent in all cuts
which appeared in the alumni mag
azine during his editorship. This
is a very good, nucleus in itself,
and besides this there have been
several other contributions.
True Van Sickle, '05, manager of
the '05 "Quad," has also sent in all
cuts used in the class annual, and
J. C. Maloy, manager of the '06
"Quad," has announced that the
cuts used in last year's annual will
be forwarded to the Library in a
few days.
It seems likely that the cuts
used in the '04 "Quad" will also be
obtained, but A. S. Henley, who
managed that annual, has not yet
been communicated with.
Besides these four good sized con
tributions, a miscellaneous collec
tion of cuts has been sent to Librar
ian Dodge from the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon house. These cuts have
not been sorted, but it is probable
that they were used in old" Quads"
or souvenir programs.
As soon as possible all these cuts
will be sorted and an accurate
list taken so that they may be
used at any time by college publi
cations.
