# NEW RULES DISCUSSED.
## Walter Camp, Football Authority, Talks of the Changes in the Game. 
### 
In discussing the new rules which
will govern intercollegiate football
this season, Walter Camp's opinion
should be of value as he is a mem
ber of the committee which made
the changes. Camp, in explana
tion of the new rulings, said in
part:
"One of the changes in the rules
has been the more accurate de
termining of the line of scrimmage.
It has already been argued that
under this new rule greater freedom
is allowed. Possibly that may be
so literally, but as a matter of fact
there was considerable latitude in
the way this rule was interpreted
last year, and the new rule really
limits it more carefully.
"It has also been suggested that
under the new rule, if a man
standing back merely reached his
arm forward, he would be within
the limits described in the rule.
Those who suggest this should re
member that the rule reads that
the line of scrimmage is an imag
inary line parallel to the goal line
and passing through the front
point of the ball. Hence a man
must stoop uver there to reach
with his hand within one foot of
this line.
"But by far the most important
of the alterations is the definite in
struction to the referee to blow his
whistle immediately the forward
progress of the ball is stopped, thus
in a measure doing away with the
rapidly growing and very detri
mental feature of stealing the ball
when its progress had been stopped
and when the ball was really Mend.'
It was certainly on the increase
in the Eastern football games last
season, and one of the principal
differences between Eastern and
Western football was the earlier
blowing of the whistle by the
referee when the forward progress
of the ball was stopped. Western
play was quicker on this account
and more satisfactory.
"One very excellent change in
the rule6 has been that providing
that a substitute when sent on to
the field must report to the official
before taking his place in line.
The sending out of substitutes to
take the place of players when
these players still cling to their
positions, and the general discuss
ion ensuing, or even more than
eleven players being engaged at a
time, were f ome of the disagreeable
features of last season, and this
rule will aid much in putting an
end to that difficulty.
"In the first edition of the rules
book there is an error to which at
tention should be called. The
committee increased the penalty of
side line coaching from five yards
to ten yards, and this is duly re
corded under rule 27-F. Under,
however, the grouping of penalties,
rule 28, this coaching is grouped
under five yards, instead of ten
yards. An errata-slip has been
printed covering this point, but
gome of those receiving early copies
of the rules will find them without
this alteration."
