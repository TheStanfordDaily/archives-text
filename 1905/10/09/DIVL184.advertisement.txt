Marlin 16 Gauge •
Repeating Shotgun
is the ideal gun, and the lightest
(6>2 lbs.)and smallest efficient re
peater made. It is not a 16 barrel
on al2 action, but a very fast hand
ling, finely balanced gun of great
accuracy. Our cylinder bore gun
for brush shooting has no equal.
The full choked barrels are bored for
either smokeless or black powders, and
take heavy loads. They target better
than 240 pellets in a 30 inch circle at
35 yards, using one ounce chilled shot.
You ought to know this gun. Write for full
