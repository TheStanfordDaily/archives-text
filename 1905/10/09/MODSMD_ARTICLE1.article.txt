# ROLLS UP BIG SCORE
## VARSITY MAKE 51 POINTS AGAINST INFANTRY TEAM. Stanford Outclasses Opponents in a Listless Game.—Lanagan Plays Almost Entire Squad. 
### 
Against the 15th Infantry, which
was utterly incapable of withstand
ing the plays directed at it, the
Varsity succeeded in winning
Saturday's game by the large score
of 51 to 0. The soldiers were not
proficient in knowledge of the finer
points of the game, and in spite of
its weight the infantry line was un
able to stop the attacks of the
Stanford backs, who gained at will
through the holes which were
opened up by the Cardinal line
men. Equally weak were the ends
of the visiting team; and aided by
superb interference, the Varsity
half-backs circled them for long
gains. Lack of condition also
handicapped the infantry. With
the weakening of the soldiers, the
Varsity began to play listlessly,
and the contest became monoto
nous. Twice during the progress of
the game the visitors made their
downs, once by making three bucks
through the Stanford line, and the
second time by recovering a fumble
on *4jeii» third down.

With the exception of Fen ton's
excellent goal- and place-kicking
against a hard wind, Saturday's
contest was devoid of interest for
the spectators, and without value
as a practice match to the Varsity,
