As the football Reason progresses
the necessity of keeping nil persons
off the field whose business does not
absolutely require tbem there, be
comes more urgent. People strag
gling along the side-lines annoy
the spectators, —but this is not the
main point. The season is getting
well advanced and the coaches are
beginning to instruct the men in
some of the plays that will be used
in the big game. As conditions
exist now it would be a compara
tively easy matter for a person who
desired, to find out exactly where
the teams are strongest and where
they are weakest, and even to go
so far as to learn the signals, if that
were deemed advisable. Manager
Barrett could very easily do away
with the danger in this direction
by allowing only authorized men
upon the field. A list could be
drawn up, by Manager Barrett and
the two coaches, of the men, outside
of the players in uniform, whose
work absolutely required them to
be on the side lines. The men
thus approved by the coaches could
be given side-line badges for the
season, which must be worn on the
outside of the coat at all practices
and at all games. There should
be men to see that this rule is en
forced, and the college at large will
be better off. These men should
also keep the loafers away from
the training shed, and the children
from running all over the field.
The side-line pass system is a ne
cessity as a protection, and it
should be installed and rigidly en
forced.
