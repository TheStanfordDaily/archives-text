### 
The regular Sunday services were
held in the Memorial Church yes
terday, the Rev. Mr. Gardner oc
cupying the pulpit both morning
and afternoon. For the morning
service Dr. Gardner took for his
subject the belief in immortality.
After explaining that the charter
of the University called for this re
ligious teaching, and announcing
that the address wae to be prelimi
nary in character, and would be
followed at another date by more
detailed discussion, Dr. Gardner
said in part:
"Philosophy has tended to de
stroy the beautiful reality of the
future life. Against the common
unspiritual life, the faith in im
mortality is the great achievement
of human life and civilization.
All the nobler elements of our na
tures protest against death, and
the laying of all our achievements
an I ambitions in the grave. Im
mortality is one of the great spir
itual themes of life, and yet in this
strenuous, utilitarian age, how
little do we reHect on it.
"Literature and history from the
earliest times bear witness to the
belief.
"Two points stand out most
strongly regarding the belief: first,
its immensity; second, its nature, as
affecting the history of affairs.
"To my mind 'the essence of im
mortality is the continuity of per
sonal identity, the continuance of
the things which make life worth
the living here on earth.' The real
personal individual will survive
the process of death, and go on liv
ing in the realms of which we can
now but dream."
