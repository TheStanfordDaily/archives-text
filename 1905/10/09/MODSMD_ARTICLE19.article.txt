# California Fails to Score.
## 
### 
Willamette played the Univer
sity of California a 0-0 game last
â–ºSaturday on the gridiron at Ber
keley. Coach Knihbs has given
the California varsity more speed
than it ever hail in previous years,
Willamette being unahle to score
because of the lack of this quality.
California played two elevens and
would have scored but for numer
ous fumbles.
