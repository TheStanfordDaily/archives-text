# FRESHMEN VICTORIOUS
## DEFEAT ELEVEN FROM UNIVERSITY OF PACIFIC. Score of 15-0 Not Indicative of Relative Strength of Teams.—Academy Exceptionally Strong. 
### 
The second game played on the
Stanford gridiron Saturday after
noon was far more interesting than
the Varsity contest, which preceded
it. The Freshmen won from the
plucky team of the University of
Pacific Academy by the score of
15 to 0 after a hard struggle, which
was not as one sided as the score
would seem to indicate. With the
exception of full-back Smith, the
academy team did not have any
individual stars, but they were
strong in team work.
The team work of the 1909 play
ers was extremely rugged at times
and the playing of the individuals
was not up to the usual standard.
The Freshmen did not seem to pos
sess either tlie ability or the incli
nation to aid the runner in keeping
his feet, and this fault caused the
loss of many yards which might
otherwise have been easily gained.
Saturday's contest showed that the
Freshman team has much to learn
in the short week which intervenes
before the game against California,
and some radical changes in the
line-up may be the direct result of
the playing of a few of the candi
dates against the academy eleven.
Three touch-downs were made by
the Freshmen, two in the first half
and one in the second.
failure to convert any of these
touch-downs into goals was chiefly
due to the high wind which pre
vailed throughout the game.
