# FACULTY CLUB-HOUSE
## STANFORD FIELD CLUB TO HAVE NEW QUARTERS. Need for Enlargement Will Probably Be Met This Year.â€”Plans Not Definite. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Stanford Field Club is considering
plans for a new faculty club-house,
which will probably be erected in
the near future. Professor A. T.
Murray and Professor C. B. Wing,
president and secretary of the com
mittee respectively, have the mat
ter in charge, and although noth
ing of a very definite character has
been accomplished, there is no
doubt that the Faculty Club will
be in better quarters before the
year is over.
The present quarters are not
large enough to accommodate the
growing requirements of the club,
but they have not been enlarged be
cause of the uncertainty of a perma
nent location. With the assignment
of land for the new athletic field by
the Board of Trustees, the ground
used by the Stanford Field Club
was definitely set aside as its perma
nent location. The club will now
proceed to improve the property,
either by erecting an entirely new
building or by enlarging the pres
ent quarters. A new tennis court
will be putin, and the baseball
field will be improved. Larger and
better quarters for the accommo
dation of those members who par
ticipate in athletic sports are
planned, although it is possible
that the new Gymnasium may be
used partly for this purpose by the
members.
Membership in the Stanford
Field Club is open to all faculty
members who have the rank of in
structor or over. The club pays a
nominal rent for the use of the
land upon which its house is lo
cated, but the expense of member
ship is comparatively small. In
carrying out the plans for new
quarters the clul> will not be able
to make any great expenditure, as
do certain of the faculty clubs in
Eastern universities where rich
outsiders hold memberships. At
its next meeting the executive com
mittee of the club will probably
determine upon a definite plan
of procedure.
