# LAST GAME TO-MORROW
## FRESHMEN WILL MEET SANTA CLARA. Final Preliminary Contest for First-Year Men Before Meeting California Next Saturday. 
### 
The Freshmen will play their
last preliminary game of the season
to-morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock
when they meet the eleven from
Santa Clara College. As this will
be the last game for the Freshmen
before the intercollegiate match
with California next Saturday, the
contest will be of the greatest im
portance, since the final team will
be chosen from among the best
men who take part in the game.
Neither line-up has been an
nounced. The best Freshmen will
be given a chance, so as to deter
mine who shall play next Satur
day.
Last year the Santa Clara team
defeated the 1908 Freshmen 10-0,
and the struggle to-morrow should
prove exceptionally interesting.
Admission will be twenty-five
cents.
