# TO ENTER PRACTICE
## REPPY HAS RESIGNED FROM LAW DEPARTMENT. W.N. Hohfeld, a Graduate of California and Harvard, Will Fill Vacancy. 
### 
An unexpected change took place
in the Law department to-day,
when Wesley N. Hohfeld met the
classes which have been conducted
by R. V. Keppy. When Reppy
was appointed last summer it was
with the understanding that he
could resign if a good opportunity
was afforded him to practice. Such
an opportunity has arisen, and
much to the general regret of all
those in the department, Mr. llep
py's resignation has been accepted.
He will begin to practice law in
San Francisco at once.
Wesley N. Hohfeld, who comes
to fill the vacancy, will giveexactly
the same courses as Reppy has con
ducted so far this semester. There
are three courses, Evidence, Trusts,
and Equity I, which will be affect
ed by the change.
Mr. Hohfeld received his A. B.
at the University of California in
1901, graduating with the highest
honors. He obtained his L.L. B.
at Harvard Law School in 1904,
and for the past year he has been
practicing in San Francisco. Re
cently he gave a few courses at
Hastings Law School in San Fran
cisco.
