### 
Announcement was made in sev
eral of the English courses this
morning that Professor Anderson
would lt-cture to English majors
at 1:30 Thursday afternoon in the
chapel on ''The Aims Sought After
in the Organization of the Courses
of the Department." The purpose
of this lecture is to bring the Eng
lish majors together as such and
explain the organization of the
courses in that department.
The faculty of the English de
partment held a meeting recently
and discussed the matter of holding
these department assemblies fre
quently during the year, and de
cided to have this one Thursday as
an experiment; and if it is success
ful, it is probable that definite ar
rangements will be made to liold
them regularly.
The need of some organization
whereby the members of the Eng
lish department could meet as such
and hear lectures that would be of
interest to them has long been felt,
but no steps were ever taken along
this line on account of the size of
the department. In all of the sci
ence departments, where the regis
tration is smaller, clubs are organ
ized, where the members take part,
but in the larger departments this
would be impossible. At present
the enrollment in the English de
partment is about 200, and with
this number it would not lie feas
ible to have meetings led by the
undergraduates. At the recent
meeting of the faculty of thiß de
partment it was decided to have
some member of the faculty or
,other prominent person speak
upon some subject of special inter
est to English majors.
