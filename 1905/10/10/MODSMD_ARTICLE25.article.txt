# Special Rates for Freshman Game.
## 
### 
The report from one source that
the rates for the Freshman inter
collegiate game next Saturday are
$1.40 on Friday and $1.10 for
Saturday is a mistake. The mat
ter of securing railroad rates for the
intercollegiate games has always
devolved upon the student body
manager, and Manager Barrett re
mains the responsible party. There
is only one rate, and thai is a
round-trip rate of $I.lo,which takes
effect at noon on Friday. No
certificates from the Registrar's
office will he necessary to obtain
the special rate either on Friday or
on Saturday. These special rate
tickets will be good for return in
cluding Monday.
