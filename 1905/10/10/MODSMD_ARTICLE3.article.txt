# Freshmen Oarsmen Begin Work.
## 
### 
Although no regular call has been
issued to the boating-men for fall
training, about ten first-year men
have turned out in response to the
offer of the Boat Club to assist all
Freshmen who wish to do light pre
liminary training this semester.
In addition to the men who have
turned out of their own accord, all
Freshmen who are taking gymna
sium work are receiving a certain
amount of instruction upon the
rowing machines. After the pro
duction of the farce, "All Tangled
Up," the Boat Club intends to
organize both the Freshmen and
old men who wish to take fall
training, into squads, and conduct
the work in a systematic man
ner.
