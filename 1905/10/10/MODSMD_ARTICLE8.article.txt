# ATTACK SUMMER BALL
## COMMITTEE PLANS CAMPAIGN AGAINST PROFESSIONALISM Stringent Rule Defining Amateur Standing To Be Rigidly Enforced This Season. 
### 
The rumors which have been
freely circulated around the cam
pus to the effect that the faculty
athletic committees of Stanford
and California had joined forces in
an aggressive campaign against
summer baseball is vigorously de
nied by the members of the Stan
ford committee. There has been
no concerted action on the part of
the two universiiies in regard to
this matter, but the athletic com
mittee here intends to make every
effort to stamp out summer base
ball this season. Offers received
by several members of last year's
Varsity to play summer ball with
various semi-professional teams
have been turned over to the com
mittee and will be used as evidence
in case of future protest.
The section in the intercollegiate
athletic agreement which relates to
and defines the status of amateurs
is a very stringent one and works
particular hardship on baseball
players. The committee desires to
call the attention of Freshmen who
intend to play baseball to this sec
tion, the gist of which reads as fol
lows: "An amateur is defined as
one who has not competed with . or
against a professional team in a
game where an admission fee is
charged except when it is done un
der the auspices and bona fide con
trol of the University to which he
belongs."
It was under this rule that Heit
muller and Hliss of last year's Cal
ifornia varsity were barred from
the second intercollegiate game.
The main point made by Califor
nia's committee, in taking action
against these two men, was not so
much the fact that they played un
der assumed names but their viola
tion of the clause relating to play
ing with professionals in a game
where admission was charged.
The committee does not desiie
any repetition of this disgraceful
case, and to that end a vigorous in
vestigation of the list of baseball
eligihles has been going on and
will be continued before it is sub
mitted to California. In case even
these stringent methods should fail,
several members of the athletic
committee have not hesitated to ex
press themselves in favor of sus
pending intercollegiate baseball
contests for an indefinite period,
at least until the element of pro
fessionalism has been completely
stamped out.
