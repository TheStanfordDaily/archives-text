# DEFEAT SANTA CLARA
## FRESHMEN WIN AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE. Last Preliminary Contest Results in Another Victory.—Lack of Condition Handicaps Visitors. 
### 
Id the best game played on the
Stanford gridiron this season the
Freshmen were victorious yesterday
afternoon over Santa Clara College
by the score of 10 to 0. The Car
dinal score was gained by a clever
drop-kick near the close of the first
half and a touch-down made early
in the second period of play. This
score, however, does not adequately
show the decisiveness of the defeat,
as the Freshmen, by off-side plays
on two occasions, lost opportuni
ties to score when the ball was close
to the Santa Clara goal-line.
Cotich Sheehy has developed a
fast, aggressive team, but from the
number of times that its members
were temporarily disabled it whs
clear that they were in poor physi
cal condition. The fast game
played by the Freshmen soon had
them in distress, but they rallied
desperately at critical stages of the
contest and prevented their goal
line from being crossed more than
once.
The knowledge that the game
would to a great extent determine
the final make-up of the Freshman
eleven stimulated the candidates
to their best effortH, and as a result
the playing was spirited and vigor
ous.. The defensive work of the
team was a vast improvement over
the previous games, and the play
ing of the ends was considerably
better.

The chief gains against Santa
Clara were made by Cuthbertson
and Johnson bv a tackle-back play
which the college line was unable
to stop, and a similar play used by
the Santa Clara players was suc
cessful early in the game, but the
Freshmen soon devised a defense
which was effective in stopping it.
A side-line fake similar to the play
which gave Santa Clara a touch
down against the 1908 Freshmen
came near repeating the feat yes
terday. The other trick plays
employed by the visitors were inef
fective.
It seemed that the first half
would end without a score, as the
Freshmen had lost the ball three
times within six yards of t heir op
ponents' goal-line; but with only
thirty seoonds left to play, Holman
executed a drop-kick from the 20-
yard linesquarely between the goal
posts. The touch-down was scored
by Cuthbertson after a series of
steady bucks had carried the ball
up the field.
Santa Clara kicked to the 15-yard
line, and Holman returned it 15
yards. Torney punted 35 yards on
the second down and Schmidt ran
it back 10 yards. After making
first down on bucks, Santa Clara
was unable to duplicate the feat,
and the Freshmen got the hall.
Torney punted 35 yards on the
third down, and again the ball was
returned for 10 yards. Santa Clara
was unable to make the distance
and punted 30 yards to Holman,
who returned it five yards. Cuth
bertson gained 10 yards and Good
ell 10 more on a tackle play.
Cuthbertson followed with an ad
vance of 9 yards, and on the next
play Parma recovered a fumble by
Torney and advanced the ball 9
yards, only to lose it on the third
down on Santa Clara's 7-yard line.
Santa Ciara punted 30 yards and
out of danger. Torney lost 10
yards and Goodell was forced to
kick, the ball rolling over the goal
line. On the kick-out Santa Clara
made 30 yards and Holman re
turned the ball 7 yards. Goodell

kicked over the goal-line again, and
Santa Clara returned the ball to
the center of the field. Holnian,
Cuthbertson and Johnson advanced
the ball 12, 10 and 7 yards on five
plays, and on a series of bucks
added 10 more. An off-side play
lost the Freshmen 5 yards, which
they were un.ible to make in addi
tion to the 5 for first down, and
Santa Clara was given the ball on
her own 5 yard line. Schmidt
punted HO yards and Holman re
turned the bull 10 yards. Goodell
bucked the line for 8 yards, and
Holman drop kicked a goal from
the 17-yard line in the last half
minute of the play. Score, 4-0.
Doane kicked off in the second
half to the 10-yard line, and the
ball was returned 20 yards. On a
fumble by Santa Clara, the Fresh
men secured the ball and Cuth
hertson made a touch-down on the
sixth play. Holman kicked the
goal. 10-0.
During the remainder of the half
the Freshmen played consistent
ball, but were unable to score
again. Fourteen Freshmen were
substituted in the second half.
