# DEFEAT SANTA CLARA
## FRESHMEN WIN AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE. Last Preliminary Contest Results in Another Victory.—Lack of Condition Handicaps Visitors. 
### 
Id the best game played on the
Stanford gridiron this season the
Freshmen were victorious yesterday
afternoon over Santa Clara College
by the score of 10 to 0. The Car
dinal score was gained by a clever
drop-kick near the close of the first
half and a touch-down made early
in the second period of play. This
score, however, does not adequately
show the decisiveness of the defeat,
as the Freshmen, by off-side plays
on two occasions, lost opportuni
ties to score when the ball was close
to the Santa Clara goal-line.
Cotich Sheehy has developed a
fast, aggressive team, but from the
number of times that its members
were temporarily disabled it whs
clear that they were in poor physi
cal condition. The fast game
played by the Freshmen soon had
them in distress, but they rallied
desperately at critical stages of the
contest and prevented their goal
line from being crossed more than
once.
The knowledge that the game
would to a great extent determine
the final make-up of the Freshman
eleven stimulated the candidates
to their best effortH, and as a result
the playing was spirited and vigor
ous.. The defensive work of the
team was a vast improvement over
the previous games, and the play
ing of the ends was considerably
better.
