## MEMBERS OF WASEDA TEAM DESCRIBE AMERICAN GAME. Manager Abe Praises Stanford and President Jordan.—Varsity May-Play Return Series in Japan. 
### 
Professor Abe and Hashido, the
manager and captain respectively
of theWaseda baseball team, are j
both at work upon books in which
they deal with the game of base
ball as played in the United States.
In the account by Professor Abe
mention will also be made of the
experiences of the Japanese team
while in this country.
Baseball bids fair to become a
highly developed sport in Japan.
During the summer the members
of the Waseda team, which made
such a brilliant showing against
many of the strong teams in Cali
fornia, have beencoaching the high
school baseball players in Japan.
This, together with the great
interest taken in the American
game, augurß well for future inter
national contests and closer rela
tions between the universities of
the Pacific Coast and the Orient.
In his report to Waseda Univer
sity concerning the trip to America,
Professor Abe makes many inter
esting statements regarding Stan
ford. He speaks in the highest
praise of the University, students,
and the treatment which the team
received while guests here. He has
warm words of praise for President
Jordan, and says that Japan has
great need of such men in her uni
versities.
There is a possibility that the
Stanford Varsity baseball team
may go to Japan during the sum
mer vacation and play a return
series with the various universities
there. Both Professor Abe and
Captain Hashido have expressed
their wishes that the Stanford
players should play in Japan. No
plans have been made, however,
and none can be made unless a sat
isfactory arrangement concerning
expenses can be made with Waseda
University. Manager Barrett is in
favor of such a trip and intends to
make the arrangements if possible.
The Waseda team showed a
steady improvement from the time
of its first game here until it left
for Japan. It was defeated by
Stanford in two games, the first by
a score of 9-1, and the second 3-1.
The California varsity defeated
them 5-0. With the experience
gained from playing these two fast
nines, Waseda took a trip to the
southern part of the state, and
there defeated several strong teams,
among them the one from the Uni
versity of Southern California.
Close and interesting games were
played with the nines from Occi
dental, St. Vincent's and Pomona
College.
The Japanese team next went
north and played In Oregon and
Washington. In the games with
the University of Oregon, Mult
nomah Club, and Washington Uni
versity, the Waseda men, although
defeated, made a most creditable
showing. The team left for Japan
June 13th.
