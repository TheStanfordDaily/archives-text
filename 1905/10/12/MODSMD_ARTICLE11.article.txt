Stanford has always sent a
strong delegation of rooters to the
intercollegiate contests that are
held away from the campus, and
with a larger student body this
year the number attending the
Freshman game should
previous records. Every student
should make it a point to he pres
ent at this contest. The person
who fails to attend the two big
football games of the year shows
that he is sadly lacking in some of
the qualities that go to make up a
good college man. The person who
fails to attend for some minor rea
sons not only lacks spirit but also
lacks interest, and that does not
speak well for him as a loyal stu
dent or as a man. The fact that
only a hundred tickets have been

that will attend the game from
here, for the majority of the stu
dent body will probably buy their
tickets at the grounds. Stanford
has always been well represented)
but there are some few who stay
behind who are failing to get the
full benefit from undergraduate
life. It is to be hoped that they
will attend this time, and especial
ly do not let it be said that a single
Freshman failed to see the mem
bers of his class struggle for su
