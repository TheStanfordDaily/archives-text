# NO ACTION WAS TAKEN
## TRUSTEES DISCUSS AFFAIRS WITH ENCINA MEN. Full Report of This Consultation Will Be Placed Before Board at Next Meeting. 
### 
Horace Davis and George E.
Crothers, members of the Board of
Trustees, met a number of Encina
men to-day for the purpose of con
sidering a more satisfactory way
of managing affairs in Encina
Hall. Conditions in the Hall and
the sentiment among the students
were thoroughly discussed, and a
new plan was roughly outlined by
W. E. Crawford, '06, president of
Encina Club. The main tenor of
this plan was that the Hall should
be governed in general by a body
of upper-classmen. Other than this
there was no definite suggestion
made.
Both the trustees announced that
it was the intention of the Board
to investigate the affairs, and that
they desired to make any changes
which would improve conditions in
the Hall and lead to better feeling
between the authorities and the
students.
Although three hours and a half
were consumed in discussion
nothing definite was decided upon,
but an account of the entire pro
ceedings will be presented to the
Board of Trustees at their next
meeting, a short-hand reporter be
ing present to-day to takedown the
conversation in detail. After this
has been read to the Board of Trus
tees some action will probably be
taken.
The Faculty Committee on Stu
dent Affairs also had a consultation
with Mr. Davis and Mr. Crothers
and explained their view of the sit
uation in Encina Hall. The fac
ulty and students appeared before
the trustees separately.
