# RAILROAD CHANGES HANDS.
## Electric Line to San Francisco Will Probably Be Rushed to Completion. 
### 
TheSanta Clara Interurban Rail
way Company recently passed into
the hands of Lewis E. Hanchett of
San Francisco, who was elected
president of the company. With
the retiring owners, J. F. Parkinson
of Palo Alto gives up his interest in
the line. There is a report that the
Western Pacific is backing the deal.
It is probable that work on the
interurban road will be resumed in
a short time, and that the proposed
line through the campus will also
Boon be built. Surveys of the route
were made during the past sum
mer, and applications for the right
of way have been putin the hands
of the Board of Trustees. The
three-year franchise in Palo Alto
runs out within nine months, so
that it is almost certain that active
road building will begin soon.
Thus far the interurban company
has constructed very little track. It
has built a mile and a half of track
in Palo Alto. Construction work
was temporarily abandoned some
little time ago, but the Palo Alto
line, it is announced, will be ready
for operation very shortly. The
track at Palo Alto is of standard
gauge and iB laid with heavy steel
similar to that on the main line of
the Southern Pacific bo that the
road could be used as a steam road
without the necessity of any recon
struction. The entire line up the
peninsula, it is understood, will be
of similar construction.
