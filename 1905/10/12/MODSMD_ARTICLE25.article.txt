# COACHES DISCUSS SUGGESTION.
## May Make Stricter Rules in Accordance with Ideas of Roosevelt. 
### 
Walter Camp has given out the
following statement in regard to
the conference which President
Roosevelt held with leading football
authorities:
"At a meeting with the President
of the United State√ü it was agreed
that we consider an honorable obli
gation exists to carry out in letter
and in spirit the rules of the game
of football relating to roughness,
holding and foul play, and the
active coaches of our universities
being present with us pledged
themselves to so regard it, and to
do their utmost to carry out that
obligation.
"Walter Camp, A.Hildebrand,
J. E. Owsley, E. H. Nichols,
J. W. Fine, W.T.Reid, Jr."
These men represent Yale, Har
vard and Princeton. They admit
that a result of President Roose

velt's urging may be the considera
tion of changes in the rules to make
the game less brutal. Any such
changes would be made at the an
nual meeting of the football asso
ciation, to be held in Philadelphia
this winter.
