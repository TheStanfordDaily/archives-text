# TEAM WANTS RECOGNITION.
## Basket-Ball Men Want to Use Name of Stanford in Coming Games 
### 
At the regular meeting of the
Executive Committee last night a
number of matters of importance
were considered. L. M. Edwards,
'07, and R. H. Bookmeyer, '08,
manager and captain respectively
of the basket-ball team, appeared
before the committee and asked
that the team be allowed to adopt

the name of the "Stanford" basket
ball team instead of ''Encina Gym
nasium" team, as it is now known.
The proposition was held over for
consideration at the next meeting.
If the Executive Committee grants
the petition it is probable that its
affairs will be handled by Man
ager Barrett.
Regarding the wearing of arm
bands at the intercollegiate game,
the committee decided not to au
thorize the band as official.
It was voted to give the members
of the football squad tickets to the
Freshman game. The tickets were
voted on condition that they be
non-transferable.
C. A. Beardsley, '06, H. E. Sav
age, '06, and C. F. Laumeister,'o7,
were appointed as auditing com
mittee to go over the financial re
port of Manager Barrett.
