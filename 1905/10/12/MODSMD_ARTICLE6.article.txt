# Song-Books Selling Slowly.
## 
### 
The sale of the new song-books
on the quad this morning was
comparatively small, only 125 cop
ies being sold. The sale will be
continued at the rally this evening.
In all probability the four new
songs which are included in the
book will not be sung at the Fresh
man game, as the time for practic
ing them is too short to ensure
their successful singing on the
bleachers Saturday.
The prize-winning song by P. C.
Edwards, '06, and the new Stan
ford yell by E. A. Cunha, '06, are
reprinted below:

O, Berk'ley, don't you see the streak of Cardinal
That's on the field, that's on the field ?
You've come to find you'll have to buck a stone wall,
We never yield, we never yield.
The red is ev'rywhere, 'tis in the air,
Oh, can't you see, Oh, can't you see?
Your golden hair you'll have to madly tear
O, Berkelee, O Berkelee.
CHORUS
Stanford, Stanford, fight and yell "rah, rah,"
Stanford, Stanford, fight and yell "rah, rah,"
Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah—
You'd better journey back to that dear Cal-i-for-ni-ah.
The following is the prize yell, by E. A. Cunha, '06:
s-t-a-N, f-o-k-D ; s-t-a-N, f-o-r-D —
B—T, a-N, f-O, R-D; 8-T, a-N, f-O, r-D —
