# FRESHMEN PRACTICE
## LIGHT WORK GIVEN MEN WHO MAY PLAY SATURDAY. Squad Has Diminished to Half Its Former Number and Competition Is at an End. 
### 
The Freshman squad, which has
dwindled down to about thirty
men, were given light practice last
night. The squad reported for
work at four o'clock, and were
given practice in elementary points
of the game by Head-Coach Lana
gan,'oo, and Assistant-Coach Bans
bach, '05. Falling on the ball,
tackling the dummy, and running
in kick-offs were included in part
of the afternoon's practice. The
squad was divided into two teams
and given instruction both on of
fensive and defensive work. No
scrimmage work was indulged in.
The men were given light work to
day, and to-morrow's practice will
consist only of limbering-up exer
cises.
The men for the most part are
in excellent physical condition, and
the bruises received in the game
last Tuesday with Santa Clara Col
lege are being carefully nursed by
the men and treated by Trainer
Moulton. The coaches are en
countering great difficulty in
selecting the team because of the
equal merit of the candidates for
the different positions. There are
two or more candidates for every
position, and in only a few in
stances are the men moderately
certain of their positions.
Terrill suffered a severe wrench
of his left leg in the game with
Belmont, but this has grown strong
again, so that he is in excellent
condition at the present time.
Hihn was hurt in last Tuesday's
game, but instant attention by
Trainer Moulton prevented any
possible chance of his inability to
play.
The rest of the squad are in good
condition and with two days of
rest will be entirely well from any
injuries sustained during the recent
practices.
