# Freshman Game To-morrow
## Strong Eleven of Stanford Names of Men Who Will Oppose Each Other 
### 
For the twelfth time in the his
tory of intercollegiate athletics, a
Stanford Freshman team has been
selected to struggle for football su
premacy against t lie first-year
eleven of the University of Cali
fornia. The contest will begin
promptly at 2:30 to morrow after
noon on California Field in Ber
keley.
The playing of the Freshman
squad throughout the season has
not been uniformly brilliant, but
the past two weeks have witnessed
such an improvement in their work
that football critics are a unit in
declaring the 1909 eleven the best

Freshman team the Cardinal has
ever developed. Starting the year
with an abundance of good ma
terial, it was expected that the 1909
candidates would play brilliantly
from the start; but the early por
tion of the season was marked by
erratic playing, which was decid
edly discouraging to the Sianford
coaches and sympathizers. But

even during this period there were
spasmodic indications of the bril
liance which has finally resulted in
the formation of the fast aggressive
team that will represent the Cardi
nal on the California gridiron to
morrow afternoon. With the im
provement in the consistency of the
squad and the increase of spirit
among its individual members, the
final selection of the team became
a difficult problem for the coaches.
Especially in the back-field have
they been confronted by the di
lemma caused by very slight dif
ference in the ability of the candi
dates for these positions. On the
ine the superiority of the men fin
ally chosen to fill the positions
over their rivals is generally con
ceded by even the most superficial
observers.
It has been Assistant - Coach

and as a result he has developed a
team which has subordinated
everything to team work. The
Freshman eleven as finally selected
is very evenly balanced, with the
advantage slightly in favor of the
line, which lacks the weak spots so
palpably apparent in the 1908
eleven.
In the past, condition has been
no small factor in determining
the final outcome of the Intercol
legiate Freshman game, and in this
respect the 1909 team has not been
surpassed by any of its predecess
ors. The preliminary season has
been remarkably free from serious
accidents, and with the exception
of a few minor injuries, the team
will enter to-morrow's contest
physically fit for a gruelling match.
This result has been attained by
Trainer Moulton's unremitting
attention to the physical well-being
of the men, coupled with their
faithful adherence to strict train
ing rules.
Another advantage possessed by
the 1909 men is the possession of a
large number of substitutes, who
will be able to fill acceptably the
place of any members of the team
who may be compelled to retire
from the game on account of in
juries. This is especially true of
the back-field, which can be entire
ly replaced if the necessity for such
a step arises. On the line a num
ber of heavy substitutes are avail
able for the center trio, and at
