# Freshman Game To-morrow
## Strong Eleven of Stanford Names of Men Who Will Oppose Each Other 
### 
For the twelfth time in the his
tory of intercollegiate athletics, a
Stanford Freshman team has been
selected to struggle for football su
premacy against t lie first-year
eleven of the University of Cali
fornia. The contest will begin
promptly at 2:30 to morrow after
noon on California Field in Ber
keley.
The playing of the Freshman
squad throughout the season has
not been uniformly brilliant, but
the past two weeks have witnessed
such an improvement in their work
that football critics are a unit in
declaring the 1909 eleven the best

Freshman team the Cardinal has
ever developed. Starting the year
with an abundance of good ma
terial, it was expected that the 1909
candidates would play brilliantly
from the start; but the early por
tion of the season was marked by
erratic playing, which was decid
edly discouraging to the Sianford
coaches and sympathizers. But

team that will represent the Cardi

and as a result he has developed a
team which has subordinated
everything to team work. The
Freshman eleven as finally selected
is very evenly balanced, with the
advantage slightly in favor of the
line, which lacks the weak spots so
palpably apparent in the 1908
eleven.
In the past, condition has been
no small factor in determining
the final outcome of the Intercol
legiate Freshman game, and in this
respect the 1909 team has not been
surpassed by any of its predecess
ors. The preliminary season has
been remarkably free from serious
accidents, and with the exception
of a few minor injuries, the team
will enter to-morrow's contest
physically fit for a gruelling match.
This result has been attained by
Trainer Moulton's unremitting
attention to the physical well-being
of the men, coupled with their
faithful adherence to strict train
ing rules.
Another advantage possessed by
the 1909 men is the possession of a
large number of substitutes, who
will be able to fill acceptably the
place of any members of the team
who may be compelled to retire
from the game on account of in
juries. This is especially true of
the back-field, which can be entire
ly replaced if the necessity for such
a step arises. On the line a num
ber of heavy substitutes are avail
able for the center trio, and at

least one good tackle will be on
hand to occupy this important
position if either of the regular
tackles should be injured.
While the coaches are not very
confident of the successful outcome
of to morrow's contest, they are
satisfied with the team as it has
been finally selected, and express
themselves as hopeful of a Cardinal
victory.
Coach Lanagan said—''We have
a good, h;trd fighting team, and a
good lighting chance to win to-mor
row's game." Assistant-Coach Bans
bach is well satisfied with the team
which will represent Stanford to
morrow, and is sanguine of success.
He said—"The Freshmen have a
good fighting chance to win to-mor
row's game, hut they have a hard
struggle before them, as Berkeley
has a good team."
"Dad" Moulton, who is chiefly
responsible for the splendid physi
cal condition of the men who will
face the Berkeley freshmen to-mor
row, was more outspoken than the
coaches. The veteran trainer said
—"This is the best Freshman team
that 1 have ever trained, and if
they lose the game 1 shall he greatly
surprised. The men are in condi
tion to stand a hard contest."
Holman,the newly elected cap
tain and quarter-back, comes from
the Hill Military Academy, Port
land, Oregon. He is possessed of
all the qualities which go to make
up a good field general, and handles
hi* team brilliantly. Holman
plays a steady and consistent
game. He handles punts well, and
is by far the fastest man on the
team at running through a scat
tered field. On the defensive his
work throughout the season has
been of a high order, as his tack
ling is steady and is almost sure to
stop the runner. Holman's weight
should be of great assistance to
him in to-morrow's game; he tips
the scales at 150 pounds, which is
considerably heavier than the
general run of Freshman quarters.
It is unfortunate that a severe in
jury prevented Heinly from show
ing his true form this season.
Until he was hurt he played a
steady, consistent game behind the
line. In case Holman would be
injured, Owen should make a good
substitute for this position.
Doane, who will play center to
morrow, learned the game at the
Sacramento High School, where he
played for four years He has
shown up well in the preliminary
games, and is a hard worker who
never lets up on his man. Doane
weighs 185 pounds, and should be
fully equal to Hotchkiss, his Cali
fornia opponent. His passing has
been straight and sure, especially
for kicks. On the defensive Doane
should be able to stop any of the
bucks that California sends
against his part of the line. Bar
more, the substitute center, gave
Doane a close race for his position,
the contest being decided only to
day. He also weighs 185 pounds,
and is a hard, consistent player.
Goodell will go into the game
to-morrow as full-back. He is the
youngest man on the team, but be
has had three years' experience at
his position on the Portland High
School team. He is a strong player
offensively and defensively, but
lacks endurance and staying pow
er. He hits the line low and hard
and is good for a gain when yards
are needed. He is also a punter of
no mean ability, and should any
thing happen to Torney most of
the kicking will probably devolve
upon him. Ellis, who ran Goodell
a close race, will go up to Berkeley
to-morrow as substitute full-back.
He is heavier and stronger than
Goodell but lacks dash and form
in his line bucking. Ellis is also
able to punt in excellent form. He
learned the game at the San Jose
High School.
The end positions will be played
by Jackson and Tower. At the be
ginning of the season there were
twenty candidates for the end posi
tions, but this number dwindled
down until there were but eight
candidates, and from this number
the coaches have selected the two
men who are to go into the first
line-up. Jackson made the team
principally on account of his ex
cellent defensive and offensive
work in the game against Santa
Clara College last Tuesday. The
competition for end has been so
keen that the problem of choosing
the men has been delayed until to
day. Tower has played a consist
ent game this season, and earned
his position on excellent all»round
work.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are the tackles.
Crawford and Cuthbertson loomed
up as probable members of the
final team before any other two
■nen. Of the two, Crawford is con
sidered the stronger, although Cuth
bertson's defensive work stamps
him as one of the best Freshman
tackles within the past few years.
Both men are thoroughly ac
quainted with the game, but Craw
ford's inexperience gives Cuthbert
son an advantage. Much reliance
is placed in the tackles for their de
fensive work, and they will also be
relied on to advance the ball.
Both tackles played with the Var
sity squad for a short part of the
eeaßon, but were transferred to the
Freshman squad more than a week
ago.
The guard positions have given
the coaches little trouble because of
the wealth of good material. Min
turn is unquestionably the beet
guard of the season, and won his
position on the right side of the
line early in the year. Wildman
will play the other position. There

was a question for a long time
whether Hihn, Wildman or Wood
ard would play this position, and
the doubt was only removed after
careful comparison of the work of
the men. Their positions will he
as well filled as they have heen in
the past Freshman elevens. It
seems from a comparison of the
weights that California will be
slightly outweighed, but it is al
most certain that the Blue and
Gold players have been underrated
in this respect throughout their
line-up.
The back-field was an array of
candidates never equalled in num
bers at the beginning of the season,
and from this number Terrill of
Mission High, and Torney of Corby
Hall, University of Notre Dame,
Indiana, were the winners. Their
final selection is due to the excel
lent showing they have made dur
ing the entire season. Torney is
the best punter on the entire squad,
and if he keeps his head in to-mor
row's struggle there is no need for
worry that on the exchange of punts
California will gain. He will do
the punting in to-morrow's game
In the event of his becoming in
jured, Crawford and Goodell will
prove able substitutes. Terrill is
the best offensive player behind the
line. He is always sure of his yards,
plunging into the line low and
hard. On the defensive he is gen
erally sure of his man, but is par
ticularly good at breaking the in
terference.

ginning of the season there were
twenty candidates for the end posi
tions, but this number dwindled
down until there were but eight
candidates, and from this number
the coaches have selected the two
men who are to go into the first
line-up. Jackson made the team
principally on account of his ex
cellent defensive and offensive
work in the game against Santa
Clara College last Tuesday. The
competition for end has been so
keen that the problem of choosing
the men has been delayed until to
day. Tower has played a consist
ent game this season, and earned
his position on excellent all»round
work.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are the tackles.
Crawford and Cuthbertson loomed
up as probable members of the
final team before any other two
■nen. Of the two, Crawford is con
sidered the stronger, although Cuth
bertson's defensive work stamps
him as one of the best Freshman
tackles within the past few years.
Both men are thoroughly ac
quainted with the game, but Craw
ford's inexperience gives Cuthbert
son an advantage. Much reliance
is placed in the tackles for their de
fensive work, and they will also be
relied on to advance the ball.
Both tackles played with the Var
sity squad for a short part of the
eeaßon, but were transferred to the
Freshman squad more than a week
ago.
The guard positions have given
the coaches little trouble because of
the wealth of good material. Min
turn is unquestionably the beet
guard of the season, and won his
position on the right side of the
line early in the year. Wildman
will play the other position. There

was a question for a long time
whether Hihn, Wildman or Wood
ard would play this position, and
the doubt was only removed after
careful comparison of the work of
the men. Their positions will he
as well filled as they have heen in
the past Freshman elevens. It
seems from a comparison of the
weights that California will be
slightly outweighed, but it is al
most certain that the Blue and
Gold players have been underrated
in this respect throughout their
line-up.
The back-field was an array of
candidates never equalled in num
bers at the beginning of the season,
and from this number Terrill of
Mission High, and Torney of Corby
Hall, University of Notre Dame,
Indiana, were the winners. Their
final selection is due to the excel
lent showing they have made dur
ing the entire season. Torney is
the best punter on the entire squad,
and if he keeps his head in to-mor
row's struggle there is no need for
worry that on the exchange of punts
California will gain. He will do
the punting in to-morrow's game
In the event of his becoming in
jured, Crawford and Goodell will
prove able substitutes. Terrill is
the best offensive player behind the
line. He is always sure of his yards,
plunging into the line low and
hard. On the defensive he is gen
erally sure of his man, but is par
ticularly good at breaking the in
terference.
For the twelfth time in the his
tory of intercollegiate athletics, a
Stanford Freshman team has been
selected to struggle for football su
premacy against t lie first-year
eleven of the University of Cali
fornia. The contest will begin
promptly at 2:30 to morrow after
noon on California Field in Ber
keley.
The playing of the Freshman
squad throughout the season has
not been uniformly brilliant, but
the past two weeks have witnessed
such an improvement in their work
that football critics are a unit in
declaring the 1909 eleven the best

Freshman team the Cardinal has
ever developed. Starting the year
with an abundance of good ma
terial, it was expected that the 1909
candidates would play brilliantly
from the start; but the early por
tion of the season was marked by
erratic playing, which was decid
edly discouraging to the Sianford
coaches and sympathizers. But

and as a result he has developed a
team which has subordinated
everything to team work. The
Freshman eleven as finally selected
is very evenly balanced, with the
advantage slightly in favor of the
line, which lacks the weak spots so
palpably apparent in the 1908
eleven.
In the past, condition has been
no small factor in determining
the final outcome of the Intercol
legiate Freshman game, and in this
respect the 1909 team has not been
surpassed by any of its predecess
ors. The preliminary season has
been remarkably free from serious
accidents, and with the exception
of a few minor injuries, the team
will enter to-morrow's contest
physically fit for a gruelling match.
This result has been attained by
Trainer Moulton's unremitting
attention to the physical well-being
of the men, coupled with their
faithful adherence to strict train
ing rules.
Another advantage possessed by
the 1909 men is the possession of a
large number of substitutes, who
will be able to fill acceptably the
place of any members of the team
who may be compelled to retire
from the game on account of in
juries. This is especially true of
the back-field, which can be entire
ly replaced if the necessity for such
a step arises. On the line a num
ber of heavy substitutes are avail
able for the center trio, and at

least one good tackle will be on
hand to occupy this important
position if either of the regular
tackles should be injured.
While the coaches are not very
confident of the successful outcome
of to morrow's contest, they are
satisfied with the team as it has
been finally selected, and express
themselves as hopeful of a Cardinal
victory.
Coach Lanagan said—''We have
a good, h;trd fighting team, and a
good lighting chance to win to-mor
row's game." Assistant-Coach Bans
bach is well satisfied with the team
which will represent Stanford to
morrow, and is sanguine of success.
He said—"The Freshmen have a
good fighting chance to win to-mor
row's game, hut they have a hard
struggle before them, as Berkeley
has a good team."
"Dad" Moulton, who is chiefly
responsible for the splendid physi
cal condition of the men who will
face the Berkeley freshmen to-mor
row, was more outspoken than the
coaches. The veteran trainer said
—"This is the best Freshman team
that 1 have ever trained, and if
they lose the game 1 shall he greatly
surprised. The men are in condi
tion to stand a hard contest."
Holman,the newly elected cap
tain and quarter-back, comes from
the Hill Military Academy, Port
land, Oregon. He is possessed of
all the qualities which go to make
up a good field general, and handles
hi* team brilliantly. Holman
plays a steady and consistent
game. He handles punts well, and
is by far the fastest man on the
team at running through a scat
tered field. On the defensive his
work throughout the season has
been of a high order, as his tack
ling is steady and is almost sure to
stop the runner. Holman's weight
should be of great assistance to
him in to-morrow's game; he tips
the scales at 150 pounds, which is
considerably heavier than the
general run of Freshman quarters.
It is unfortunate that a severe in
jury prevented Heinly from show
ing his true form this season.
Until he was hurt he played a
steady, consistent game behind the
line. In case Holman would be
injured, Owen should make a good
substitute for this position.
Doane, who will play center to
morrow, learned the game at the
Sacramento High School, where he
played for four years He has
shown up well in the preliminary
games, and is a hard worker who
never lets up on his man. Doane
weighs 185 pounds, and should be
fully equal to Hotchkiss, his Cali
fornia opponent. His passing has
been straight and sure, especially
for kicks. On the defensive Doane
should be able to stop any of the
bucks that California sends
against his part of the line. Bar
more, the substitute center, gave
Doane a close race for his position,
the contest being decided only to
day. He also weighs 185 pounds,
and is a hard, consistent player.
Goodell will go into the game
to-morrow as full-back. He is the
youngest man on the team, but be
has had three years' experience at
his position on the Portland High
School team. He is a strong player
offensively and defensively, but
lacks endurance and staying pow
er. He hits the line low and hard
and is good for a gain when yards
are needed. He is also a punter of
no mean ability, and should any
thing happen to Torney most of
the kicking will probably devolve
upon him. Ellis, who ran Goodell
a close race, will go up to Berkeley
to-morrow as substitute full-back.
He is heavier and stronger than
Goodell but lacks dash and form
in his line bucking. Ellis is also
able to punt in excellent form. He
learned the game at the San Jose
High School.
The end positions will be played
by Jackson and Tower. At the be
ginning of the season there were
twenty candidates for the end posi
tions, but this number dwindled

"Dad" Moulton, who is chiefly
responsible for the splendid physi
cal condition of the men who will
face the Berkeley freshmen to-mor
row, was more outspoken than the
coaches. The veteran trainer said
—"This is the best Freshman team
that 1 have ever trained, and if
they lose the game 1 shall he greatly
surprised. The men are in condi
tion to stand a hard contest."
Holman,the newly elected cap
tain and quarter-back, comes from
the Hill Military Academy, Port
land, Oregon. He is possessed of
all the qualities which go to make
up a good field general, and handles
hi* team brilliantly. Holman
plays a steady and consistent
game. He handles punts well, and
is by far the fastest man on the
team at running through a scat
tered field. On the defensive his
work throughout the season has
been of a high order, as his tack
ling is steady and is almost sure to
stop the runner. Holman's weight
should be of great assistance to
him in to-morrow's game; he tips
the scales at 150 pounds, which is
considerably heavier than the
general run of Freshman quarters.
It is unfortunate that a severe in
jury prevented Heinly from show
ing his true form this season.
Until he was hurt he played a
steady, consistent game behind the
line. In case Holman would be
injured, Owen should make a good
substitute for this position.
Doane, who will play center to
morrow, learned the game at the
Sacramento High School, where he
played for four years He has
shown up well in the preliminary
games, and is a hard worker who
never lets up on his man. Doane
weighs 185 pounds, and should be
fully equal to Hotchkiss, his Cali
fornia opponent. His passing has
been straight and sure, especially
for kicks. On the defensive Doane
should be able to stop any of the
bucks that California sends
against his part of the line. Bar
more, the substitute center, gave
Doane a close race for his position,
the contest being decided only to
day. He also weighs 185 pounds,
and is a hard, consistent player.
Goodell will go into the game
to-morrow as full-back. He is the
youngest man on the team, but be
has had three years' experience at
his position on the Portland High
School team. He is a strong player
offensively and defensively, but
lacks endurance and staying pow
er. He hits the line low and hard
and is good for a gain when yards
are needed. He is also a punter of
no mean ability, and should any
thing happen to Torney most of
the kicking will probably devolve
upon him. Ellis, who ran Goodell
a close race, will go up to Berkeley
to-morrow as substitute full-back.
He is heavier and stronger than
Goodell but lacks dash and form
in his line bucking. Ellis is also
able to punt in excellent form. He
learned the game at the San Jose
High School.
The end positions will be played
by Jackson and Tower. At the be
ginning of the season there were
twenty candidates for the end posi
tions, but this number dwindled
down until there were but eight
candidates, and from this number
the coaches have selected the two
men who are to go into the first
line-up. Jackson made the team
principally on account of his ex
cellent defensive and offensive
work in the game against Santa
Clara College last Tuesday. The
competition for end has been so
keen that the problem of choosing
the men has been delayed until to
day. Tower has played a consist
ent game this season, and earned
his position on excellent all»round
work.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are the tackles.
Crawford and Cuthbertson loomed
up as probable members of the
final team before any other two
■nen. Of the two, Crawford is con
sidered the stronger, although Cuth
bertson's defensive work stamps
him as one of the best Freshman
tackles within the past few years.
Both men are thoroughly ac
quainted with the game, but Craw
ford's inexperience gives Cuthbert
son an advantage. Much reliance
is placed in the tackles for their de
fensive work, and they will also be
relied on to advance the ball.
Both tackles played with the Var
sity squad for a short part of the
eeaßon, but were transferred to the
Freshman squad more than a week
ago.
The guard positions have given
the coaches little trouble because of
the wealth of good material. Min
turn is unquestionably the beet
guard of the season, and won his
position on the right side of the
line early in the year. Wildman
will play the other position. There

was a question for a long time
whether Hihn, Wildman or Wood
ard would play this position, and
the doubt was only removed after
careful comparison of the work of
the men. Their positions will he
as well filled as they have heen in
the past Freshman elevens. It
seems from a comparison of the
weights that California will be
slightly outweighed, but it is al
most certain that the Blue and
Gold players have been underrated
in this respect throughout their
line-up.
The back-field was an array of
candidates never equalled in num
bers at the beginning of the season,
and from this number Terrill of
Mission High, and Torney of Corby
Hall, University of Notre Dame,
Indiana, were the winners. Their
final selection is due to the excel
lent showing they have made dur
ing the entire season. Torney is
the best punter on the entire squad,
and if he keeps his head in to-mor
row's struggle there is no need for
worry that on the exchange of punts
California will gain. He will do
the punting in to-morrow's game
In the event of his becoming in
jured, Crawford and Goodell will
prove able substitutes. Terrill is
the best offensive player behind the
line. He is always sure of his yards,
plunging into the line low and
hard. On the defensive he is gen
erally sure of his man, but is par
ticularly good at breaking the in
terference.
For the twelfth time in the his
tory of intercollegiate athletics, a
Stanford Freshman team has been
selected to struggle for football su
premacy against t lie first-year
eleven of the University of Cali
fornia. The contest will begin
promptly at 2:30 to morrow after
noon on California Field in Ber
keley.
The playing of the Freshman
squad throughout the season has
not been uniformly brilliant, but
the past two weeks have witnessed
such an improvement in their work
that football critics are a unit in
declaring the 1909 eleven the best

Freshman team the Cardinal has
ever developed. Starting the year
with an abundance of good ma
terial, it was expected that the 1909
candidates would play brilliantly
from the start; but the early por
tion of the season was marked by
erratic playing, which was decid
edly discouraging to the Sianford
coaches and sympathizers. But

and as a result he has developed a
team which has subordinated
everything to team work. The
Freshman eleven as finally selected
is very evenly balanced, with the
advantage slightly in favor of the
line, which lacks the weak spots so
palpably apparent in the 1908
eleven.
In the past, condition has been
no small factor in determining
the final outcome of the Intercol
legiate Freshman game, and in this
respect the 1909 team has not been
surpassed by any of its predecess
ors. The preliminary season has
been remarkably free from serious
accidents, and with the exception
of a few minor injuries, the team
will enter to-morrow's contest
physically fit for a gruelling match.
This result has been attained by
Trainer Moulton's unremitting
attention to the physical well-being
of the men, coupled with their
faithful adherence to strict train
ing rules.
Another advantage possessed by
the 1909 men is the possession of a
large number of substitutes, who
will be able to fill acceptably the
place of any members of the team
who may be compelled to retire
from the game on account of in
juries. This is especially true of
the back-field, which can be entire
ly replaced if the necessity for such
a step arises. On the line a num
ber of heavy substitutes are avail
able for the center trio, and at

least one good tackle will be on
hand to occupy this important
position if either of the regular
tackles should be injured.
While the coaches are not very
confident of the successful outcome
of to morrow's contest, they are
satisfied with the team as it has
been finally selected, and express
themselves as hopeful of a Cardinal
victory.

which will represent Stanford to

and as a result he has developed a
team which has subordinated
everything to team work. The
Freshman eleven as finally selected
is very evenly balanced, with the
advantage slightly in favor of the
line, which lacks the weak spots so
palpably apparent in the 1908
eleven.
In the past, condition has been
no small factor in determining
the final outcome of the Intercol
legiate Freshman game, and in this
respect the 1909 team has not been
surpassed by any of its predecess
ors. The preliminary season has
been remarkably free from serious
accidents, and with the exception
of a few minor injuries, the team
will enter to-morrow's contest
physically fit for a gruelling match.
This result has been attained by
Trainer Moulton's unremitting
attention to the physical well-being
of the men, coupled with their
faithful adherence to strict train
ing rules.
Another advantage possessed by
the 1909 men is the possession of a
large number of substitutes, who
will be able to fill acceptably the
place of any members of the team
who may be compelled to retire
from the game on account of in
juries. This is especially true of
the back-field, which can be entire
ly replaced if the necessity for such
a step arises. On the line a num
ber of heavy substitutes are avail
able for the center trio, and at

least one good tackle will be on
hand to occupy this important
position if either of the regular
tackles should be injured.
While the coaches are not very
confident of the successful outcome
of to morrow's contest, they are
satisfied with the team as it has
been finally selected, and express
themselves as hopeful of a Cardinal
victory.
Coach Lanagan said—''We have
a good, h;trd fighting team, and a
good lighting chance to win to-mor
row's game." Assistant-Coach Bans
bach is well satisfied with the team
which will represent Stanford to
morrow, and is sanguine of success.
He said—"The Freshmen have a
good fighting chance to win to-mor
row's game, hut they have a hard
struggle before them, as Berkeley
has a good team."
"Dad" Moulton, who is chiefly
responsible for the splendid physi
cal condition of the men who will
face the Berkeley freshmen to-mor
row, was more outspoken than the
coaches. The veteran trainer said
—"This is the best Freshman team
that 1 have ever trained, and if
they lose the game 1 shall he greatly
surprised. The men are in condi
tion to stand a hard contest."
Holman,the newly elected cap
tain and quarter-back, comes from
the Hill Military Academy, Port
land, Oregon. He is possessed of
all the qualities which go to make
up a good field general, and handles
hi* team brilliantly. Holman
plays a steady and consistent
game. He handles punts well, and
is by far the fastest man on the
team at running through a scat
tered field. On the defensive his
work throughout the season has
been of a high order, as his tack
ling is steady and is almost sure to
stop the runner. Holman's weight
should be of great assistance to
him in to-morrow's game; he tips
the scales at 150 pounds, which is
considerably heavier than the
general run of Freshman quarters.
It is unfortunate that a severe in
jury prevented Heinly from show
ing his true form this season.
Until he was hurt he played a
steady, consistent game behind the
line. In case Holman would be
injured, Owen should make a good
substitute for this position.
Doane, who will play center to
morrow, learned the game at the
Sacramento High School, where he
played for four years He has
shown up well in the preliminary
games, and is a hard worker who
never lets up on his man. Doane
weighs 185 pounds, and should be
fully equal to Hotchkiss, his Cali
fornia opponent. His passing has
been straight and sure, especially
for kicks. On the defensive Doane
should be able to stop any of the
bucks that California sends
against his part of the line. Bar
more, the substitute center, gave
Doane a close race for his position,
the contest being decided only to
day. He also weighs 185 pounds,
and is a hard, consistent player.
Goodell will go into the game
to-morrow as full-back. He is the
youngest man on the team, but be
has had three years' experience at
his position on the Portland High
School team. He is a strong player
offensively and defensively, but
lacks endurance and staying pow
er. He hits the line low and hard
and is good for a gain when yards
are needed. He is also a punter of
no mean ability, and should any
thing happen to Torney most of
the kicking will probably devolve
upon him. Ellis, who ran Goodell
a close race, will go up to Berkeley
to-morrow as substitute full-back.
He is heavier and stronger than
Goodell but lacks dash and form
in his line bucking. Ellis is also
able to punt in excellent form. He
learned the game at the San Jose
High School.
The end positions will be played
by Jackson and Tower. At the be
ginning of the season there were
twenty candidates for the end posi
tions, but this number dwindled
down until there were but eight
candidates, and from this number
the coaches have selected the two
men who are to go into the first
line-up. Jackson made the team
principally on account of his ex
cellent defensive and offensive
work in the game against Santa
Clara College last Tuesday. The
competition for end has been so
keen that the problem of choosing
the men has been delayed until to
day. Tower has played a consist
ent game this season, and earned
his position on excellent all»round
work.
The strongest places in the
Freshman line are the tackles.
Crawford and Cuthbertson loomed
up as probable members of the
final team before any other two
■nen. Of the two, Crawford is con
sidered the stronger, although Cuth
bertson's defensive work stamps
him as one of the best Freshman
tackles within the past few years.
Both men are thoroughly ac
quainted with the game, but Craw
ford's inexperience gives Cuthbert
son an advantage. Much reliance
is placed in the tackles for their de
fensive work, and they will also be
relied on to advance the ball.
Both tackles played with the Var
sity squad for a short part of the
eeaßon, but were transferred to the
Freshman squad more than a week
ago.
The guard positions have given
the coaches little trouble because of
the wealth of good material. Min
turn is unquestionably the beet
guard of the season, and won his
position on the right side of the
line early in the year. Wildman
will play the other position. There

was a question for a long time
whether Hihn, Wildman or Wood
ard would play this position, and
the doubt was only removed after
careful comparison of the work of
the men. Their positions will he
as well filled as they have heen in
the past Freshman elevens. It
seems from a comparison of the
weights that California will be
slightly outweighed, but it is al
most certain that the Blue and
Gold players have been underrated
in this respect throughout their
line-up.
The back-field was an array of
candidates never equalled in num
bers at the beginning of the season,
and from this number Terrill of
Mission High, and Torney of Corby
Hall, University of Notre Dame,
Indiana, were the winners. Their
final selection is due to the excel
lent showing they have made dur
ing the entire season. Torney is
the best punter on the entire squad,
and if he keeps his head in to-mor
row's struggle there is no need for
worry that on the exchange of punts
California will gain. He will do
the punting in to-morrow's game
In the event of his becoming in
jured, Crawford and Goodell will
prove able substitutes. Terrill is
the best offensive player behind the
line. He is always sure of his yards,
plunging into the line low and
hard. On the defensive he is gen
erally sure of his man, but is par
ticularly good at breaking the in
terference.
