# An Enthusiastic Rally
## Speeches in Assembly Hall, Followed by Serpentine 
### 
Rah! naught nine,
Rail! naught nine,
Stanford, Stanford,
Naughty-nine.
One nine, naught nine,
Stanford!
The annual rally before the
Freshman game took place in As
sembly Hall last night at 7:30, and
was one of the most enthusiastic
send-offs ever given to a Stanford
Freshman team. Almost the en
tire seating capacity of Assembly
Hall was occupied, and from the
minute the veil-leaders gave the
signal for the first outburst, the

rooting whs given with a force and
volume unequalled up to the pres
ent time this season.
About 7:30 the Stanford hand
came in playing,and soon afterward
the Encina Club entered in lock
step, filling up the remaining va
cant seats in the hall. A few min
utes after they were seated the
members of the Freshman squad
appeared, and the entire assem
blage rose with one accord and
cheered them.
The regular program of the rally
included speeches by Professor


Assistant-Coach Bansbach
