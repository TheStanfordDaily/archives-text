### 
Rah! naught nine,
Rail! naught nine,
Stanford, Stanford,
Naughty-nine.
One nine, naught nine,
Stanford!
The annual rally before the
Freshman game took place in As
sembly Hall last night at 7:30, and
was one of the most enthusiastic
send-offs ever given to a Stanford
Freshman team. Almost the en
tire seating capacity of Assembly
Hall was occupied, and from the
minute the veil-leaders gave the
signal for the first outburst, the

rooting whs given with a force and
volume unequalled up to the pres
ent time this season.
About 7:30 the Stanford hand
came in playing,and soon afterward
the Encina Club entered in lock
step, filling up the remaining va
cant seats in the hall. A few min
utes after they were seated the
members of the Freshman squad
appeared, and the entire assem
blage rose with one accord and
cheered them.
The regular program of the rally
included speeches by Professor


Assistant-Coach Bansbach
Whitaker, "Dad" Monitor), Assist
ant Coach Bansbach and Chaplain
Gardner. Professor \V hi taker de
livered a very clever and amusing
mock-heroic oration predicting the
downfall of California's team on
the Hillegas field Saturday. "Dad"
Moulton, as usual, had only been
informed of the occasion some
moments before being called upon
to speak, but managed to entertain
the rally with the usual dry hu
mors and anecdotes. Coach Bans
bach addressed a serious talk, par
ticularly to the members of the
Freshman team, calling upon each
man to fight for all that was in
him next Saturday, and at the
same time paying a tribute to the
spirit which the Freshman team of
'09 has manifested throughout the
season, and which entitles them to
the reward if victors. Dr. Gardner
spoke briefly and pointedly of a
proper manifestation of the Stan
ford spirit before, during and after
the game, ending with a final word
of encouragment to the team.
After the conclusion of the
speeches, the individual candidates
for places on the team were cheered,
the prize song, "A Streak of Cardi
nal," by P. C. Edwards, 'Otf, was
sung, and the rally closed with the
entire body standing and singing
"Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
After the rally a serpentine was
formed in front of Assembly Hall,
and led by the band proceeded to
the center of the inner quadrangle,
where the rows of students danced
around for about half an hour.
