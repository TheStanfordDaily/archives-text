# Comparison of Teams.
## 
### 
The Freshman team which will
represent Stanford to-morrow in
the twelth intercollegiate match
compares favorably with the win
ning team which represented Stan
fort! two years ago. The team this
year is different from previous
teams because it is evenly balanced
and lacks stars. The team con
sists of eleven fighters who in every
instance should give a good account
of themselves against the California
Freshmen.
The California back-field is un
doubtedly superior to the one rep
resenting Stanford, and there is no
individual player who can corres
pond lo Stanton when an end run
is called for. The speed which the
California coaches ha ve drilled into
their men may prove puzzling to
our line for a time.
The Stanford line will be strong
er than the California line, and will
not outweigh the California Fresh
men by the reported weight. The
weights of the California team are
the ones submitted for publication.
Stanford's ground-gaining tack
les should show up strongly in to
morrow's contest.
The splendid kicking material
on the team will offset the advan
tage California may have in the
back-field. Torney and Crawford
are good for 50 yards unless they
lose their nerve in the struggle to
morrow. Goodell can also be
counted on in an emergency. A
Stanford Freshman team has never
sent a trio of punters who are as
consistent as Crawford, Torney and
Goodell.
