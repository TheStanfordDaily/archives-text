# Stanford Freshmen Lose Game
## Cardinal Defeated 6 to 0. Both the Elevens Play Splendid Football. 
### 
Stanford pent a splendid Fresh
man team to uphold the honor of
the Cardinal on California Field
Saturday afternoon, and by the
narrowest of margins it lost the
twelfth annual contest between the
two first-year elevens. Although
it is generally conceded that the
best eleven lost, due credit must be
given to the California team for the
magnificent game which it played.
The Blue and Gold team was ob
viously inferior in coaching and
training to its Cardinal opponent,
but the coolness and head work of
the California back-field snatched
victory from what should have been
certain defeat. In all departments
of the game, except handling of
punts in the back-field and getting
down under kicks, the Stanford
Freshmen excelled their California
rivals. Neither team played a great
defensive game, but on the offense
Stanford was the most consistent
ground gainer. The Cardinal for
wards outclassed their opponents,
and the work of the Stanford backs
compared favorably with the play
ing of the members of the Califor
nia back-field.
The team work of the Blue and
Gold eleven was faster than Stan
ford's, but the superior physical
condition of the Cardinal players
more than overcame this handicap.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton had his
charges in such good shape that
only twice during the progress of
the game was time taken out on ac
count of an injury to a Stanford
player, while the California play
ers were disabled after practically
every down.
As many anticipated, the play
ing of the Stanford tackles was one
of the features of the game. Time
after time they blocked the Califor
nia plays before the interference
could even form, and on the offense
both Cuthbertson and Crawford
made good gains for their team.
Cunha, California's heavy tackle,
did not prove a match for Craw
ford, who handled him with ease.
Torney made some great punts,
five of which were for over sixty
yards each; but the advantage of
this long kicking was lost to the
Cardinal by the failure of the ends
to get down under the kicks. Five
times Stanton tried a place-kick
for a field-goal, but in spite of the
fact that three attempts were made
from the 20-yard line squarely in
front of the goal-posts, only one of
them came dangerously near scor
ing four points for California.
Had it not been for unfortunate
fumbles in handling Stanton's
punts, the kicking duel, which was
the main feature of the first half,
would have been decidedly favor
able to Stanford.

A couple of misplays and an un
fortunate error of judgment on the
part of the Stanford players in the
second period of play gave Califor
nia its chance, and by using the old
quarter-back punt trick play, Stan
ton recovered the ball. With only
ten yards to run, the fast Califor
nia back crossed the goal-line be
fore the Stanford players could re
cover from their bewilderment.
Cerf kicked an easy goal, and the
score was B to 0 in favor of Califor
nia.
With only seven minutes left to
play, and with the ball in the
middle of the field, the Cardinal
1909 players began to show that
the Stanford spirit is something
more than a mere phrase to them.
Relentlessly they attacked the Cali
fornia line, which crumpled hack
like pasteboard before their fierce
bucks. By mass plays outside of
tackles, bucks through center and
an occasional end run, the ball was
carried sixty yards. With the
sphere on the one-foot line, and on
the third down, no gain was made,
and California punted out of dan
ger, just before the referee's whistle
announced the end of the game.
California won the toss and chose
to defend the north goal. At 2:40
Crawford kicked off to California's
10-yard line where Stanton caught
the ball and returned it 10 yards.
Rheinhard made 5 yards on three
bucks, and Cerf added 3 more
on two bucks. Stanton fumbled
and Holman fell on the ball on
California's 27-yard line. Cuth
bertson advanced the ball 7 yards
in three trials and Crawford added
3 yards. Stanford lost the ball on
downs on California's 18-yard line.
Cerf and Rheinhard bucked the
line in vain and Stanton kicked
40 yards to the center of the field,
where the ball was fumbled by
Holman.and four others until fin
ally recovered by Johnson of Cali
fornia. Stanton was unable to
gain a yard around right end, and
on the third down on Stanford's
40-yard line with 5 yards to go
Schaeffer signalled for a place-kick.
Stanton fumbled the ball, however,

and with the Stanford tackles and
ends close upon him he picked up
the hall and ran around right end
for 20 yards to Stanford's 20-yard
line. Stanton cross-bucked for 5
yards followed by a gain of 2 yards.
Cunha made it first down. Stan
ton added 2, but lost 1 yard on an
attempted end run. With the ball
on Stanford's 12-yard line, and 3
yards to go on the third down,
California attempted another place
kick, which went wide of the mark.
Holman caught the ball back of
the goal-line and advanced it to
Stanford's 1-yard line, but was
hurled back for a safety. Referee
Hamilton called it a touch-back
and Torney kicked out from the
25-yard line to California's 50-yard
line where Cerf received it and re
turned it for 10 yards. Stanton
advanced the ball 4j yards on a
cross buck and Cunha made it first
down. Cuthbertson tackled Schaef
fer behind the line for a loss of 4
yards on an attempted quarter
back run. Stanton lost 2 yards on
an end run and he was called upon
to kick. Standing on the 55-yard
line he punted for 30 yards where
Holman was downed in his tracks.
Torney punted 35 yards, Rhein
hard bucked for 2 yards, but Cerf
failed and Stanton kicked 15 yards.
Torney returned the punt 50 yards
and it was California's ball on her
15-yard line. Cerf advanced the
ball 1 yard on two bucks and
Stanton punted to Holman, who
fumbled, and O'Connor dropped on
the ball on the 55-yard line. Cali
fornia received 5 yards for an off
side play by a Cardinal Freshman.
Donne tackled O'Connor for a loss
of 3 yards on an attempted end
run. Stanton punted 40 yards and
Holman was downed without any
return. Torney punted 50 yards
on the first down and Schaeffer re
turned it 2 yards. 'Fuller made 1
yard and Cerf 2 yards, yet Stanton
punted on the third down for 40
yards, Holman returning the ball
10 yards. On the first down
Torney punted 60 yards and Stan
ton returned the ball for 15 yards.
Cunha and Stanton failed to gain
and Stanton punted 35 yards.
