The Varsity football team will
meet the eleven from the Univer
sity of Oregon on the campus to
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock in
the third intercollegiate game.
The Oregonians arrived from Berk
eley last night and are in ex
cellent condition and spirits. They
played a tie 0-0 game with Califor
nia last Thursday. To-morrow's
game should serve as a basis for
comparison between California and
Stanford. Coach Shorts, Michigan
'02, of the Oregon team, was accom
panied by fourteen players besides
Manager Fred Stewer, who will also
probably get into to-morrow's line
up. Coach Shorts was captain of
the Michigan eleven and played
against \V. I. Traeger, ex-'O3, in
the game at Pasadena in 1901.
The Oregon eleven played only
one game before coming to Califor
nia. In a game with the Oregon
Alumni they scored 15 points to 5
for the Alumni. Last year Stan
ford defeated Oregon 35-0, but the
northerners have been strengthened
this year by the addition of Fries
sel, the crack athlete from the Uni
versity of Nevada eleven two years
ago, when they defeated California,
and when they played Stanford a
tie 0-0 game. Moullen, left guard,
played with Lick School of San
Francisco last year, and distin
guished himself as one of the best
punters in the Academic League.
Captain Latourette is undoubted
ly one of the best quarter-backs on
the Pacific Coast at the present
time. He has played with Oregon
for several years.
The officials have not yet been
secured. The admission will be 50
cents.
The Oregon line-up will be as
follows:
Chanter, right end; Earl, right
tackle; McKinney, right guard;
Hug, center; Moullen, left guard;
Arnspeiger, left tackle; Moores,
left end; Latourette (c), quarter
back; Templeton, left half-back;
Friessel, right half-back; Kerron,
full-back.
The Oregon substitutes are Ham
mond, guard; Spencer, center and
guard; Hurd, half-back.
