# SEATS ARE ARRANGED.
## Tickets Numbering 15,500 Ordered for Intercollegiate Game. Usual Prices. 
### 
Final arrangements were made
yesterday by manager Barrett for
the seating of the crowds at the
new bleachers on the day of the
intercollegiate game. 15,500 tickets
were ordered printed, the prices
varying from $1.00 to $2.50.
The bleachers have been mapped
out in sections and alphabetically
lettered. Four sections directly in
the middle of each side will be sold
at the rate of $2.50 per seat. The
two sections remaining on the end
of the field will cost $2.00 each,
while standing room at the open
end of the Held will cost $1.00.
The rooters' section will be op
posite, located toward the west end
of the field. Tickets in this section
will be sold for $1.50, as in the
past. The curve in the bleachers
begins in the section next to that
reserved for the rooters. The semi
circle of eight sections will sell to
the general public at $2.00 a seat.
Although these seats are at the end
of the field, they afford a view of
the whole length of the gridiron.
Definite transportation arrange
ments have not yet been made.
The railroad company proposed
that coupon tickets be used, with
one ticket good for both railroad
fare and admission to the game,
but the plan was rejected as im
practicable, because of the large
numbers of people who will come
to the campus by other means.
