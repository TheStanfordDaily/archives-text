# "DAILY PALO ALTO" LOSES.
## "Californian" Staff Wins Close and Exciting Game by One Run. 
### 
In the first of a series of baseball
games between the staffs of the col
lege dailies, the Daily Californian
defeated the Daily Palo Alto by
the score of 7 to 6. Both teams had
strong batteries, and the stnallness
of the score is largely to be attrib
uted to this fact, for the work of
the fielders was brilliant only in
spots. Kor the first three innings
neither side scored a run. In the
fourth each team batted in one
tally. The fifth inning brought
the Palo Alto to the front by a
score of 4 to 1, but loose fielding
permitted the Californian to tie the
score. Up to the last inning the
runs stood even; but with one man
out, a combination of hits and
errors brought in the winning run.
The same teams will meet on the
Stanford diamond the morning of
the Varsity game.
