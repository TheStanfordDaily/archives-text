## SOUTHERN PACIFIC PROMISES AMPLE ACCOMMODATIONS. Will Be Able to Carry Many People to the Intercollegiate Contest. 
### 
The Southern Pacific Company
has informed the representatives of
the Training House Corporation
that arrangements for transporting
the crowds from the nearby cities
to the intercollegiate game are be
ing satisfactorily made. Thus far
125 extra cars have been secured
for that day, and there will doubt
legs be many more available. Al
ready provision has been made for
the transportation of at least 7000
people from San Francisco.
No definite schedule of trains
has yet been arranged, but it is ex
pected that specials will be run as
often as possible in the forenoon,
and that in the afternoon they will
begin returning immediately at the
close of the game. The schedule
will be announced as soon as it is
completed. The railroad has not
yet given out'what the round-trip
rate will be, but it is expected that
it will be a half rate. Tickets will
be placed on sale along with the
football tickets, and as many as
possible will be urged to buy their
railroad tickets in advance, in order
that the officials may know how
large a crowd to expect in making
transportatlbn arrangements.
