# NINE VETERANS BACK
## STANFORD BASEBALL PROSPECTS BRIGHT. Short-stop the Only Position Not Filled by a Varsity Man.—Battery Will Be Strong. 
### 
With nine Varsity players who
have met California back in col
lege this year, Stanford's baseball
prospects are brighter than they
have been for many seasons. Two
members of last year's team, A. L.
Trowbridge, '05, captain and short
stop, and J. H. Colbert, '06, center
fielder in the second intercollegiate
game, have not returned to college.
The team this year will be
strengthened this year by W. Wirt,
'06, who played center-field on the
Varsity for two years. Wirt was a
brilliant fielder and one of the
heaviest hitters on the team.
Of last year's Varsity outfielders,
two have returned to college, E. G.
Dudley, '06, and A. J. Chalmers,
'07. These men with Wirt make
the outfield complete.
The batter)' this year will be ex
ceptionally strong. D. D. Sales,
'06, who pitched on last year's Var
sity and who is captain of this
year's team, will have an excellent
substitute in R. H. Rook, '06, who
was ineligible last season under the
one-year residence rule. Rook
pitched brilliant ball throughout
the season, and in the second game
of the Waseda series held the Jap
anese batters down to two hitß.
W. H. Theile, '08, and H. B. Men
ardi, '08, both of whom showed ex
cellent form in the box last season,
are also back in college.
Behind the bat the Cardinal has
another vetsran in E. P. Stott, '07,
who caught for the Varsity last
season. In case Stott should be
unable to go into the game for any
reason, H. P. Daily, '07, substitute
catcher on last year's Varsity,
would be able to succeed him.
With the exception of short-Btop
all the infield can be filled with
veterans of last year's team. G. J.
Presley, '07, first base, J. H. Bell,
'08, second base, and K. L. Fenton,
'08, third base, have all returned
to college. Beside these men there
are a large number of last year's
second team, and several Freshmen
who have good preparatory school
records. With nine veterans back
and with the material which the
Freshman class should furnish
Stanford's baseball team should be
far stronger than it has been for
many seasons past.
