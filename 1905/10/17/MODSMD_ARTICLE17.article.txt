The action of the manager of
the Quad in selecting a first class
photographer to take the pictures
of the members of the class for the
annual ensures a vast improve
ment in this section of the book.
In the past the pictures of the
members of the Junior class have
been almost uniformly poor, and in
some cases indistinguishable. This
part of the book is important, for
it is the only place where the pic
tures of the class can be found, anil
the value of them increases with
time. To the member of the class
whose annual it is, these pictures
should be invaluable as a means of
recalling former classmates and
associations. Now that the man
ager has gone to a greater expense
to insure the success of this de
partment, the members of the
Junior class should do their share
and see that a larger number of
pictures are in the annual than
ever before.
