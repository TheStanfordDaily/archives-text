# CLASS TREASURERS TO MEET.
## Plans for Arranging a Standard System of Book-keeping for Class Accounts. 
### 
A meeting of the various class
treasurers will probably take place
sometime this week to make
an agreement respecting a standard
system of book-keeping. Much of
the care of class finances in the
past has been done in a loose and
careless fashion,-and it is expected
that a good system can be decided
upon which will remedy this de
fect.
The idea of calling this meeting
originated with W. V. NVentz, 06,
the present treasurer of the Senior
Clat-s. Wentz's plan is to have the
class treasurers agree upon a sys
tem and then bring this system
before the student body for adop
tion. In this manner a standard
system for all fujure keeping of
class finances wi 11 "be established.
