# FEW CHESS ENTRIES.
## Men Trying for Club Will Be Required to Play in Tournament. 
### 
Thus far only eight men have
signified their intention of trying
out in the Chess Club tournament,
and but three of these are Fresh
men. Those who have entered the
tournament are as follows: C. E.
Spaulding, '06, J. F. Caspell, '07,
C. I. Chandler, '08, T. T. Bennett,
'08, T. R. W. F. Figg-Hoblyn, '08,
E. H. Richardson, '09, E. Billman,
'09, and I. R. Tower, '09. There
are probably more chess players in
the Freshman class who have not
yet applied for membership in the
Chess Club, and no entries will be
kept open for a longer time than
was first planned. The men try
ing out will begin playing practice
games with the old members of the
club, and the regular tournament
will be started as soon as possible.
There is an excellent opening for
chess players this year, since but
five men of last year's team have
returned to college. Last year the
club was very strong, but the de
parture of three of the beßt players
from college has left vacancies
which must be filled in the
coming tournament. M. M.
Stearns, '06, a member of last
year's team, is expected to return
late in the semester and enter the
games.
Next semester the seven men
composing the intercollegiate chess
team who will play California will
be chosen from the members of the
club, the membership of which is
limited to fourteen. The personnel
of the club will be determined at
the close of the fall tournament in
December.
