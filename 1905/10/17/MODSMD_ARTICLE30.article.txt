# MANY IMPROVEMENTS.
## Geology Building Nears Completion. Drains Being Placed and Rubbish Hauled Away.

Building and general improve
ment work is rapidly going on
around the quad. Finishing touches
are being put on the new Geology
building at the northeast corner of
the quad, and this structure should
be ready for occupancy by the first
of the year. All the plastering has
been done, and the windows for the
building have arrived and will be
placed in the structure immedi
ately.
The drain commenced on the
east side of the quad is being ex
tended all around the buildings in
preparation for the rainy season.
The stones of this drain will be cov
ered with cement, and the water
drained off by means of manholes.
The space between the new Geol
ogy building and Memorial Church
is being leveled off and the rubbish
hauled away.
