# PRIZE NOT AWARDED
## COMMITTEE FAILS TO SELECT FOOTBALL FARCE. Manuscripts Not Up to the Required Standard.â€”Matter Will Be Referred to Executive Committee. 
### 
Three manuscripts were submit
ted to the Executive Committee last
Wednesday in competition for the
football show, and these were read
by the authors to the judging com
mittee, composed of Rev. D. Charles
Gardner, Instructor L. E. Bassett,
Miss Alice Hayes, '06, D. D. Sales,
'06, and E. R. May, '06. After de
liberation the committee decided
not to award the $50 prize to any
one of the manuscripts submitted
and read, but to withhold the
award and report the condition of
affairs to the Executive Committee.
The manuscripts were all good
but not of sufficient excellence to
warrant the award of the prize.
Since the football show will proba
bly be of greater importance this
year, the committee was particu
larly stringent in its requirements.
The sub-committee which has had
charge of this competition will re
fer the matter to the Executive
Committee to-morrow night. So
far no definite plans have been
made as to extending the time.
