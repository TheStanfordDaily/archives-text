# " Quad " Pictures at Bushnell's.
## 
### 
Manager J. F. Brennan of the
'07 "Quad" has made arrangements
with Bushnell's Photograph Com
pany for taking the Juniors' pic
tures for the '07 annual. The
"Quad" assessment is now due, and
each Junior paying the same will
be given a receipt entitling the
holder to have a picture taken free.
This may be done either at Bush
nell's San Jose Gallery or the same
company's San Francisco establish
ment. Any extra photographs that
Juniors may wish to purchase for
themselves will be given at a re
duced rate.
In the past the "Quad" pictures
have been taken by local photo
graphers, and the work has not
been good. As this is a very im
portant feature of the book, Mana
ger Brennan has determined to
try a San Francisco photographer,
and he expects better results.
