# Concert by Ellery's Italian Band.
## 
### 
On the evening of Tuesday, Oc
tober 24th, Ellery's Italian Band
will give a concert in Assembly
Hall. This band will be remem
bered for the two enjoyable con
certs which it has given here in
former years. Since its last ap
pearance here two years ago, the
band has been touring through the
Eastern cities, and now comes
back to the Coast for a winter's sea
son. According to reports in Port
land papers, where the band has
been playing at the Fair grounds,
it has enjoyed the distinction of
being considered the best organi
zation of its class.
The program will be published
later. Tickets will be placed on
sale to-morrow morning at the
Bookstore and the Stanford Phar
macy in Palo Alto.
