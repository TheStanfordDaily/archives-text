# MONUMENT IS PLANNED
## FUND FOR MEMORIAL TO MRS. STANFORD. Money Being Collected by a System of Letters Sent Out in Geometrical Ratio. 
### 
The fund started in San Jose last
semester for the erection of a monu
ment to Mrs. Stanford is steadily
increasing, although very few con
tributions have been received from
the students of the University.
The chief source of contributions
has been in San Jose, while a few
interested persons in other parts of
the state have sent money. The
work is being carried on by Max
Wassman, Jr., '07, and W. L.
Cozzene, '07.
The plan was suggested by the
McKinley Monument movement,
which worked out successfully a
few years ago. The money is
being raised by a system of letters
which are sent out in geometrical
ratio, each receiver of a letter being
expected to write three more. This
endless chain, in which each per
son is expected to contribute ten
cents, when fully worked out
should result in the accumulation
of a large sum of money. The
cashiers of several San Jose banks
are acting as the trustees of the
fund. The idea has been approved
of by Dr. Jordan and other mem
bers of the faculty, and will prob
ably eventually be placed before
the Board of Trustees when the
fund has grown larger.
