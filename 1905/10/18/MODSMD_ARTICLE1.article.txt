# VARSITY WINS FROM OREGON 10-4
## SCORE NO INDICATION OF STRENGTH OF VISITING TEAM. THE 						NORTHERNERS PLAY FAST BALL BUT FAIL TO SCORE TOUCH-DOWN BECAUSE OF FUMBLING. 
### 
For the first time this season the
Varsity was scored on, but the
final outcome of the game against
the University of Oregon yesterday
afternoon was a Cardinal victory
by the score of 10 to 4. The play
ing of the Varsity was extremely
ragged, although there were periods
when the team played first class
football.
A tendency to drop the ball from
kick-offs and punts seems to have
become epidemic among the play
ers, and they were frequently guilty
of this offense yesterday. Oregon
also suffered from this trouble, and
the scoring of the field-goal by
Stanford came after the north
erners had fumbled a punt on their
10-yard line.
With the exception of the work
of its ends and the speed of its for
mations, the Oregon team was dis
tinctly inferior to the first eleven
which Coach Lanagan sent into
the game, but the erratic playing
of the Stanford line permitted the
visitors to make their distance sev
eral times during the first half.
The left Bide of the line proved a
stone wall, but sharp plunges
through the right side for good
gains were made by the fast Ore
gon backs. The failure of the line
to hold for punts resulted in several
costly loßses by Stanford.
After ten points had been scored
by Stanford a large number of
substitutes were sent into the game,
and for a time it seemed certain
that Oregon would score a touch
down, but the Varsity finally held
on the 20-yard line. Moullen
dropped back for a place-kick,
sending the ball sailing over the
cross-bar squarely between the goal
posts. A long quarter-back run by
Latourette aided by strong inter
ference, and a sensational dash
around Stanford's right end by
Frizzel, were the spectacular fea
tures of the second half. Just be
fore the end of the second period of
play the Varsity took a brace and
the ball was being slowly bucked
toward the Oregon goal-line when
time was called.
Frizzel and Latourette played
great football for their team, but
the Oregon players who loomed
above their opponents were Moores
and Chandler, whose superiors as
ends have been seen but seldom on
the Stanford gridiron.
Coach Lanagan was not at all
pleased with the showing made by
Stanford. After the game he ex
pressed the opinion that Oregon
might, have scored more heavily if
she had begun to run the ends
sooner.
Gay kicked off for Stanford
against the wind for 80 yards, and
Oregon returned the ball 5 yards.
