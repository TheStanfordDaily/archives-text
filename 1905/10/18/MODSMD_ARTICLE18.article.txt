# Plans for Law Association Smoker.
## 
### 
The council of the Law Associa
tion has definitely decided to hold
an informal smoker on Friday
night, November 10th. It is the
intention of the association to make
this smoker informal and to enter
tain all old Stanford law men who
may happen to be on the campus
the night before the intercollegiate
game. All former law students
are invited to be present, and a pro
gram will be arranged.
Representatives in the Law de
partment from different states will
be called upon to tell how they
happened to come to Stanford for
their law work. On account of the
large number of men in the depart
ment from different states it is ex
pected that these speeches will be
very interesting. Arrangements
for music by a first-class orchestra
have been made. The smoker will
probably be held at the University
Inn, but this has not been definite
ly decided.
