# FARCE PROGRESSING
## PROSPECTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL BOAT CLUB PLAY. Comedy Will Be Slightly Localized in the Dialogues.â€”Oarsmen Have Trouble with Poster. 
### 
The players who are to take part
in the Boat Club farce, ''All Tan
gled Up," on October 27th, are hard
at work. From the rapid progress
made in the play it is evident that
the comedy will he a success. Mr.
Paul Gerson, who has charge of
the staging of the piece, is pleased
with the work of the cast, and pro
nounces it the best he has seen at
Stanford.
The members of the cast have
been rehearsing twice a week since
the first selection, three weeks ago,
and the cast has not been changed
in any particular.
Some changes have been made
in the dialogue to give it a little
local color, and a few hits upon
Stanford organizations have been
introduced.
It was the original intention of
the Boat Club to get out an art
poster to advertise the play. W.
A. Paxton, '06, made a drawing of
an oarsman, and this was to have
been used for the design. This
drawing was sent to two engraving
establishments in the city, and
both reported that because of the
reddish color of the paper upon
which the drawing was made it
was impossible to make a good cut
of the picture. For this reason it
is necessary to make some changes,
which will postpone the appearance
of the art poster till Monday. For
the present the farce will be adver
tised by a plain printed poster,
which will appear to-morrow morn
ing.
The tickets for "All Tangled Up"
will go on sale Monday, the 23d,
on the quad and at the Stanford
Pharmacy, Palo Alto. The prices
will be 50 cents, 75 cents and $1.00.
