Thk rejection of all the manu
scripts to the committee in charge
of the competition for the best foot
ball show is a significant indica
tion of the decadence of amateur
dramatics at Stanford In the
pioneer days of the University
many of the efforts of undergradu
ate playwrights were not entirely
unworthy of comparison with the
works of seasoned professional
writers, and the original farces con
tinued to excite favorable comment
from critics until recent years. A
prize of fifty dollars is not to be
despised, and the fact that only
three manuscripts were submitted
to the judgment of the committee
in the competition for this reward
is striking evidence that the number
of aspiring playwrights among the
students is unusually small. Origi
nal farces have been one of the
most distinctive features of Stan
ford dramatics in the past, and the
substitution of plays from the pens
of professional authors would be a
matter for keen regret.
