### 
Arrangements for railroad trans

game on November 11th were com
pleted yesterday by Manager Bar
rett. A round-trip rate of $1.00
has been made from San Francisco
and return, and 50 cents from San
Jose and Santa Clara. On the clay
of the game excursions will begin
running from San Francisco at
8:15 and will continue at intervals
of twenty minutes until 12:30.
Returning they will begin leaving
the Palo Alto depot immediately
after the close of the game. One
large excursion will be reserved un
til the conclusion of the football
show to be given in the evening.
In order to prevent congestion at
the Third and Townsend streets de
put on November 11th, tickets for
the reduced rate will be placed on
sale with the football tickets, at
the same places and on the same
date, October 30th. These tickets
will be good coming to Palo Alto
from San Francisco only on the ex
cursion trains, but will be good on
all trains returning. The South
ern Pacific Company found this
measure necessary to prevent seri
ous interference with the regular
traffic.
