Quiktly and unostentatiously
the directors of the Training House
Corporation are doing great work
for the University, and it behooves
us to be duly appreciative of their
efforts to provide Stanford with a
suitable athletic field. But their
work has not ceased with the actual
construction of the football bleach
ers as they are taking an active
part in the preparations for hand
ling the large crowd which will
attend the big game. To a large
degree the ultimate success or fail
ure of the campus games will de
pend on the treatment which their
patrons receive, and it is vitally
necessary that nothing shall he left,
undone to provide suitable accom
modations and entertainment for
our guests on the 11th of November.
Bv exacting a promise from the bus
men to charge a flat rate for car
riage hire on the day of the big
game the directors have succeeded
in anticipating what might have
been one of the greatest evils in
cident to the pressure of such a
large number of people on the cam
pus. Another excellent scheme to
add'to the comfort of the attend
ants at the game is the plan to pre
vent congestion at the various rail
way stations by selling railroad j
tickets with the tickets of admis- i
sion. These and other minor de-1
tails have been fully arranged by
the directors, and with the hearty
cooperation of the students they
ought to make the occasion such a

success that there will be no further
question as to the expediency of
holding intercollegiate football
games on the campus.
