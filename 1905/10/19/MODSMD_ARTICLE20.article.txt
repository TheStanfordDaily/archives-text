The human folksy play, 'The
County Fair," has so many friends
that Mr. Bishop is going to repeat
it next week, it is one of those
genuine, simple stories of "real"
people who live. You go to see it
and quote it ever after.
You will hnve a. long laugh and
your sympathies with the struggles
of others will he aroused to new
action. We need to have our sym
pathies aroused once in awhile, and
it isn't always the great plays that
do this, â€”it is the simple ones.
