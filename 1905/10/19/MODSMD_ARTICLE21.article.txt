# DEBATING CANDIDATES.
## Committee Calls for Names of Those Wishing to Try Out for Carnot Team. 
### 
In order to arrange for a pre
liminary try-out, if necessary, the
debating committee has aHked that
all those intending to try for places
on this year's Carnot debating
team will hand their names im
mediately to one of the following
men: W. L. Blair, '06, D. D. Sales,
'06, or E. A. Cunha, '06.
The purpose in calling for names
at such an early date is to arrange
for a preliminary debate, if the
number of candidates makes it
necessary to hold more than one
try-out. For the past two years
such a preliminary in the fall se
mester has not been held, and the
custom will not be broken this year
unless the number of candidates is
so large as to make it impossible
to pick a team satisfactorily in one
evening.
