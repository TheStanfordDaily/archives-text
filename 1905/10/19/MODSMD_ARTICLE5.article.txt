# PRACTICE CONTINUES
## WORK IS OF RATHER UNSATISFACTORY NATURE. Reappearance of Stott, '07.â€”Chalmers and Lyons Hurt, and Temporarily Out of the Game. 
### 
The football practice yesterday
afternoon consisted entirely of ele
mentary work. The squad was di
vided into three teams, and these
alternated in kicking off and receiv
ing the ball on the kick-off. Mead-
Coach Lanagan laid great stress on

the formation of the interference
which precedes the player receiving
the kick-off.
The work of the afternoon was
uniformly poor. The hacks were
unable to catch the ball, and fre
quently fumbled when it reached
their hands. In starting when the
ball waH snapped the work was
better, hut the slump which the
squad has taken hampered good
work to a great extent. The squads
alternated at running down on
punts. Assistant-Coach Hansbach
had charge of the ends and backs,
while Lanagan took charge of the
punters and candidates for center.
As usual the punting was the
most, satisfactory and likewise the
most interesting feature of the after
noon. The best punting was done
by Lanagan, who devoted much
