# PRACTICE CONTINUES
## WORK IS OF RATHER UNSATISFACTORY NATURE. Reappearance of Stott, '07.â€”Chalmers and Lyons Hurt, and Temporarily Out of the Game. 
### 
The football practice yesterday
afternoon consisted entirely of ele
mentary work. The squad was di
vided into three teams, and these
alternated in kicking off and receiv
ing the ball on the kick-off. Mead-
Coach Lanagan laid great stress on

the formation of the interference
which precedes the player receiving
the kick-off.
The work of the afternoon was
uniformly poor. The hacks were
unable to catch the ball, and fre
quently fumbled when it reached
their hands. In starting when the
ball waH snapped the work was
better, hut the slump which the
squad has taken hampered good
work to a great extent. The squads
alternated at running down on
punts. Assistant-Coach Hansbach
had charge of the ends and backs,
while Lanagan took charge of the
punters and candidates for center.
As usual the punting was the
most, satisfactory and likewise the
most interesting feature of the after
noon. The best punting was done
by Lanagan, who devoted much


E. P. Stott
time to coaching the kickers at thin
part of the game. Dole, '07, Fen
ton, '08, and Crawford, '09, did the
pnnting for the squad. The kick
ing was generally very good, and
showed that the men are profiting
by Lanagan's coaching. Crawford
in a sure punter, and can always he
depended upon to kick the ball
high, affording the ends an oppor
tunity to get down.
Captain Chalmers, '07, was on
the tiekl in a suit, but did not par
ticipate in any of the more stren
uous work, owing to a slight sprain
of his ankle, received in the Oregon
game. Lyons, '06, will be out of
the game for more than a week, on
account of an injury to his ankle,
sustained in Tuesday's game.
The appearance of Stott, '07, on
the field this afternoon cheered up
the otherwise apathetic squad. He
seems to have entirely recovered
from the injury to his ankle. About
two weeks ago he severely tore the
ligaments of his ankle, and his re
covery has been very rapid. Al
though Stott appeared on the field
this afternoon, he will not enter
the scrimmage work before next
week.
