# NO DECISION REACHED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DISCUSSES FOOTBALL SHOW. Matter Left in Hands of Barrett Possibility that Boat Club Farce Be Presented. 
### 
At tlie regular meeting of the
Executive Committee held last
night the most important matter
which was brought up for discus
sion was in regard to a football
show for the night of the Varsity
game. The failure of any of the
manuscripts submitted in the com
petition to meet with the approval
of the committee has created a very
difficult situation. After consider
able discussion it was decided to
leave the matter in the hands of
Manager Barrett, and he was em
powered to do everything possible
to provide some sort of an enter
tainment for that night.
The time for preparing a play for
presentation is becoming very
short, and as the show must be
held on the campus owing to lim
ited transportation facilities, Man
ager Barrett has a difficult task
before him. At present two plans
have been suggested.
It has been proposed that the
Boat Club farce be postponed until
the night of the big game, and that
it be presented then in place of a
reguiar football show. In addition
to the farce there might lie other
special features and ''stunts" added
to insure a good evening's enter
tainment. The Boat Club has not
been officially approached on the
subject as yet, and it would be
hardly possible to say whether they
would consent to such a change.
The other plan which Manager
Barrett is considering is that, of
bringing a company of San Fran
cisco professionals to the campus
with a suitable play. Until be
goes to the city and consults the
theatrical managers there, Mana
ger Barrett cannot tell whether this
plan will turn out to lie practical.
As the situation now stands nothing
definite can be announced until
Barrett has been able to investigate
the condition of affairs and decide
on what shall be done.
Besides the matter of the football
show the Executive Committee
considered the application of the
basket-ball team for the regular
status of a Varsity team. The
committee decided that the team
could not represent Stanford until
they secured a coach and had a
regularly elected captain,and until
the selection of the team was placed
on a regular basis, as other branch
es of college athletics. This decision
is not absolutely final, but it will
hold until the Executive Commit
tee is convinced that the basket
ball team is picked according to
the methods followed in other Var
sity teams and that tha best possi
ble team will represent Stanford.
