The tickets for the Boat Club
farce will go on sale next Monday
morning, and the student body
should show from the first the
hearty support that is deserved by
this organization. Boating at Stan
ford was started and has progressed
under the most unfavorable condi
tions, and the strong uphill fight
that the men have made entitles
the organization to the respect and
hearty support of the student body.
Struggling along, the Boat Club
has necessarily fallen into debt
which was unavoidable. As a
means of putting the club on a
firm basis this year the club has
resorted to the presentation of a
farce. This was thought of last
year, but was abandoned when the
English Club arranged to give the
oarsmen part of the proceeds of
their production. The English
Club play barely paid expenses,
and the Boat Club was left in the
Bame financial straits that had
confronted it before. This year
they are producing a play of their
own, and by securing a first-class
cast they have insured the success
of the play from the point of pro
duction. It now rests upon the
student body to make the affair a
success financially, and the sale of
tickets on Monday should be so
large that all doubt on this score
may be set at rest.
