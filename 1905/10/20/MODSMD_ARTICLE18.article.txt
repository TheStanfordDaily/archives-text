# ELLERY'S BAND COMING.
## Faculty Committee Provides High-Class Entertainment for Tuesday Evening. 
### 
The Ellery Italian Band, which
the faculty committee on music
engaged to give a concert in the
Assembly Hall on next Tuesday
evening, is one of the best known
organizations iu the United States.
For two years the band has been
touring in the larger cities in the
East, where it has met with suc
cess. During the last few weeks it
has been up at the Portland Fair,
and is just starting on a winter
tour of the Coast cities.
In recent years the Italian bands
have achieved great popularity on
account of their extremely spirited
style of playing, a style which is
manifestly a reflection of the
Italian nature, and which it seems
impossible to obtain with players
of any other nationality. The
repertoires of these bands consist
largely of operatic selections of a
purely instrumental character, and
the programs are always relieved
from any possible heaviness by
means of generous encores, for
which lighter music is always
played.
The Ellery Band consists of fifty
five players, each a thorough artist
on his own instrument, and is con
ducted by Signo Ferullo, who has
earned an enviable record for him
self as one of the most effective of
all the Italian conductors. Before
becoming conductor, he was known
as one of the hest oboe players of
the day, and had played that in
strument with the Ellery Band for
several years.
Mr. Channing Ellery, the pro
prietor of the organization, is him
self a musical critic of ability, and
he always insistß on preparing the
programs of every concert. The
program for Tuesday night, which
has been very carefully chosen,
should prove most enjoyable, and
will be published Monday evening.
