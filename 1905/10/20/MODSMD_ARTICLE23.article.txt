# MEASURED FOR SWEATERS.
## Freshman Eleven Will Receive Them the First of Next Month. 
### 
The eleven Freshmen who played
in the intercollegiate football game
against California were measured
for their class sweaters in Manager
Barrett's office this afternoon. The
fact that all these men ordered the
V-necked garment is evidence of
the present popularity of the sweat
er-vest. The numerals which will
decorate the sweaters are in the reg
ulation style adopted last year by
the Athletic Committee. These are
eight inches high, in the block
shape, and are worn evenly across
the breast.
The sweaters are due to arrive
about the 30th of October, by which
date Manager Barrett expects to be
back from his southern trip with
the Varsity.
The men who were measured
are: J. R. Holman, F. K. Jackson,
A. M. Cuthbertson, L. R. Minturn,
N. E. Doane, F. A. Wildman, D. P.
