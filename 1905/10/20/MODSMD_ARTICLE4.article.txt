To-morrow the Varsity eleven
will meet the team from the Uni
versity of Nevada in the seventh
intercollegiate football game be
tween the two universities. Stan
ford defeated Nevada last year by a
score of 17-0, and California made
a score of 16-0. Nevada began
playing football eight years ago,
and in spite of the handicap of a
small student body has succeeded
in developing strong teams. Bel
mont defeated Nevada 74-8 in 1897,
and the next year a Stanford second
eleved scored 22 points to nothing.
In 1899 Stanford and Nevada met
for the first time, and the visitors
managed to score 5 points. The
following year the strong Stanford
eleven met defeat early in the sea
son by a single touch-down. Ne
vada scored five points in 1902, and
in 1903 played the Varsity to a
standstill in a 0-0 game.
Nevada has played but one game
this season, losing to the Reliance
Athletic Club by a score of 5-0.
This score would indicate that Neva
da is notsostrong this year as before.
The 1 088 of Friesell, the smashing
half-back who is playing with Ore
gon this year, will leave Nevada
weak behind the line.
There is little probability that
Nevada will cross the Varsity
goal-line to-morrow, but the game
will determine in a measure the
actual scoring strength of the Var
sity. The game will be called at
2:30, and an admisson of 50 cents
will be charged.
