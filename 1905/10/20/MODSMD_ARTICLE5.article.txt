# DR. BLODGETT LECTURES
## ORGANIST OF THE MEMORIAL CHURCH SPEAKS IN CHAPEL. Large Audience Hears an Interesting Discourse on the "Genesis of Modern Romantic Music." 
### 
Dr. B. C. Blodgett, organist in
Memorial Church, last night deliv
ered a lecture in the chapel on the
subject, "The Genesis of Modern
Romantic Music," this being the
first of a series of lectures on sub
jects pertaining to music which
the organist will give.
Dr. Blodgett last night spoke to
a large and attentive audience and
delivered an address which was
highly interesting and instructive.
After briefly defining his subject,
he proceeded to a particular dis
cussion of the four great artists,
Mendelssohn, Schumann, Chopin
and Brahms. This group, he
said, living in the early part of the
nineteenth century, gave birth to
the modern romantic idea in mu
sic. All differed in temperament
and environment, yet entirely un
intentionally they were all compos
ing in the same spirit. Giving a
brief description of the life and
characteristics of each man, Dr.
Blodgett showed how these circum
stances affected their compositions.
The serenity of Mendelssohn, the
indecision of Schumann, the melan
choly of Chopin, the feeling of
Brahms â€”all these sentiments were
reflected in the music of the re
spective artists.
In closing, to illustrate his re
marks, the lecturer rendered a
piece from each of the artists'
works, on a grand piano especially
provided for the purpose.
As a fitting climax to the enter
tainment of the evening Dr. Blod
gett displayed his own remarkable
musical talent by rendering "Hail,
Stanford, Hail!" as it occurred to
him the four composers under dis
cussion would have written it, ex
pressing in each interpretation the
temperament of the respective com
posers. The audience rose and
sang the verses of the University
anthem.
