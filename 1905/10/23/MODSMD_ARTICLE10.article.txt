The purpose of the afternoon or
gan recitals in the Memorial
Church unfortunately seems not to
be understood by a number of the
undergraduate women, and some of
the men, too, we are afraid. These
recitals should not be regarded
merely as opportunities for the ex
change of confidences upon what
ever is uppermost in the minds of
the undegraduates, which too often
is something quite foreign to the
music. The majority of the people
who go to these recitals are seeking
mental recreation after a long day's
work in class-room, laboratory, or
library. To these persons it is ex

tremely disagreeable to find that
some of their neighbors have select
ed the church merely as a handy
place for gossip, and the unbroken
hiss of their whisperings spoils the
afternoon. To those persons who
have acquired this obnoxious habit
beyond reform it is suggested that
they can do themselves no possible
harm by remaining away, and by
their absence will do others much
good.
