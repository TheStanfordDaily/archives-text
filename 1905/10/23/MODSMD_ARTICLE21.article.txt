Reverend Edward Lamb Parsons
of St. Mark's Church, Berkeley,
preached the sermon in the Memo
orial Church on Sunday. His text
was, "Let the mind be in you which
was in Christ Jesus."
The sermon was a plea for spirit
ual-mindedness; that man should
not only do what is right,but should
have his thoughts in communion
with God. He maintained that the
man who is good from a religious
standpoint is far better than the
man who is good only because it is
right; that one whose mind is clean
and actions consequently right, is
in God's eye much superior to one
whose actions are always correct
but whose thoughts are seldom on
religious subjects.
The latter portion of his sermon
was given up to the doctrine "Love
one another, for on this depends
the happiness of all." The nucleus
of Christ's life was a love of fellow
man, and meditation upon his
teachings will instill a disposition
to love others. If the mind be in
you which was in Christ Jesus,you
will love your fellow man, and live
at all times a better Christian life.
