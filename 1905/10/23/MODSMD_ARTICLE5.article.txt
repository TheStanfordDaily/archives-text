# STANFORD 21, NEVADA 0.
## The 						Varsity Defeats Visitors Saturday in Loosely Played Game. 
### 
Nevada found the Varsity afflict
ed by its usual annual slump, and
although Saturday's game resulted
in a victory for the Cardinal by
the substantial score of 21 to 0, the
playing of the Stanford team was
anything but satisfactory to its
supporters. Nevada's team was
palpably weaker than the elevens
which have represented that univer
sity in past contests against Stan
ford. The team work of the visit
ors was ragged, and their tendency
to fumble the ball was in a large
measure responsible for two of the
touch-downs made by the Varsity.
The players on the visiting team
did not exhibit any of that bril
liant football instinct which made
them such formidable opponents in
the past when Smith and Friesell
were the stars of the eleven.
Individually several of the Stan
ford players showed flashes of real
Varsity form, but they seemed in
capable of concerted action. Stan
ford and Molfino did the best play
ing for the Varsity, especially the
latter, who twice after passing the
ball for a punt succeeded in tack
ling the Nevada player who caught
the kick.
Chalmers and Stott did not play
in Saturday's game, but practically
all of the other prominent aspirants
for the Varsity were given a chance
to line up against the Nevadans.
Two touch-downs and a field-goal
were scored in the first half, but in
the second the Varsity was only
able to cross the Nevada line once,
leaving the final score 21 to 0 in
favor of Stanford.

Nevada was unable to withstand
the bucks which were hurled at her

line, but the painfully slow ad
vance of the ball indicated a disap
pointing lack of scoring power on
the part of the Varsity. The utter
ly heedless playing of the Cardinal
interference often stopped the prog
ress of the ball before Nevada had
a chance to tackle its carrier.
Neither of the quarter-backs used
by the Cardinal played up to hiß
usual form, and their bad errors of
judgment resulted in disastrous
losses. Although the Stanford line
men were opposed by players ob
viously their inferiors, the Nevad
ans succeeded in breaking through
often, and tackled the runner back
of the line'several times.
Crawford kicked off for 35 yards,
Nevada returning the ball 5 yards.
On the third down Nevada punted
30 yards to Fenton, who ran in
the kick 10 yards. Crow bucked
for 10 yards, followed by Dole and
Thompson for 7 and 4 yards re
spectively. Nevada secured the
ball on the third down, and made
first down twice and then kicked
32 yards to Dole, who returned it 9
yards. Crow cross-bucked for 12
yards. On the third down Fenton
punted 40 yards, and Stanford se
cured the ball on a fumble. Dole
added 4 yards, Horton 1, Crow 2,
and a series of bucks made it first
down. Thompson advanced the
ball 5 yards, and Crow 4 yards.
Stanford was penalized 5 yards for
off-side play, and a quarter-back
play to Fenton failed, leaving the
ball on the 17-yard line, where Fen
ton drop-kicked a field-goal. Score
4-0.
Nevada kicked off 40 yards, and
J. N. Stanford ran in the ball 25
yards. Fenton punted 40 yards
on the third down, and Nevada
fumbled the kick, losing 3 yards by
the fumble. Nevada punted 20
yards, and Thompson heeled the
punt. Crawford tried a place-kick
from the 45-yard line which fell
short, and Nevada returned the ball
12 yards. Nevada kicked on the
third down and Crawford had a
second opportunity to try a place
kick, which also fell short, and Ne
vada returned the ball 10 yards.
A fumble by Nevada on the 14-
yard line was recovered by Horton.

on the first down, and Stanford re
ceived 5 yards for off-side play.

down, which Dole converted into a
goal. Score 10-0.

spectively, followed by Crawford

second 5, and Crow for 3 yards,
Crawford and Dole added 6 yards,
and Crow and Rook 5. Dole made
3 yards, and on a tackle-over Pem
berton advanced the ball 7 yards.

Pemberton, Slusher, and Dole ad
vanced the ball 4, 3, 2, and 3 yards
respectively. Pemberton added 3
yard?, followed by Dole for 5,
Crawford for 3, and Slusher for 1.

down. Fenton kicked the goal.

and Slusher returned the hall '20
yards. Time was called after
Crawford had kicked 50 yards into
Nevada territory.
Nevada kicked off in the second
half for 40 yards, and J. N. Stan
ford returned the ball 22 yards.
The hall was advanced by a series
of bucks and tackle-over plays for
the following yards: Dole 1, Craw
ford 3, Rook 4, Crawford 3, Rook
1, Crawford 3, Dole 2, and Rook 1.
Stanford lost the ball on a quarter
back kick. An end run netted 20
yards, but Stanford secured the
ball on the third down, and Dole
and Rook bucked for 16 yards. An
end run lost 1 yard and Crawford
added 5. Dole made 2 yards on a
