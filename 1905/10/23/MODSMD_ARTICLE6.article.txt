# CAST OF "BEAUTY SHOP"
## CHARACTERS SELECTED TO PRODUCE THE FOOTBALL SHOW. Committee Hard at Work Preparing for Play, Which Has Already Been Revised. 
### 
Preparation for the production
of "The Beauty Shop" in Assembly
Hall on the night of the Varsity
game is being rapidly pushed for
ward by the undergraduate com
mittee which 6tudent body Treas
uer Barrett appointed last Friday.
Chairman H. I. Cruzan, '06, has
divided the committee into three
sub-committees for the better execu
tion of the work at hand.
D. H. Clift, '07, Miss E. R. Mir
rielees, '06, and H. I. Cruzan, '06,
constitute a committee whose work
it is to revise the play and intro
duce local color. E. V. Henley,'o6,
Miss Mary Moore, '07, and J. C.
Macfarland, '07, have in charge the
selection of the cast. Miss Clarice
Moise, '07, Miss Claire Pedlar, '07,
and D. D. Sales, '06, are to provide
and care for the costumes.
The committees on revision of
the play and selection of the cast
have amost completed their tasks.
The manuscript has been remodeled,
and a large number of local hits
introduced. The revision has been
most thorough, as the committee
recognizes that the success of the
production will largely depend on
the local application of the lines.
Even the songs have been changed,
and the half dozen in the play
made Stanford in sentiment and
expression.
All the principals in the cast
have been chosen,and there remains
now only the selection of choruses.
There will be two of these, one of a
dozen male voices, and another
composed of ten women.
The following iB the cast as
chosen:
Madame Voluptia.
R. S. Kellogg, '06
J. Beerpump Culmbacher
R. U. Fitting, '06
C. C. Schwabacher Pilsner
F. R. Lanagan, '07
Professor Brannagain .
E. J. Swift, '08
Sapho Sweeney.. ..R. H. Baker, '08
J. Rockeyfeller Gould
J. R. Ward, '07
Clarence Poseur. ..H.I. Cruzan, '06
It will be noticed that all the
parts are taken by men, Kellogg
taking the only female role. Most
of those choeen for the cast have
appeared before the footlights often,
but for some this will be their first
bow to a University audience. Kel
logg is probably the best known in
dramatics here. He took a leading
part in"The Rivals" last year, and
later played a highly humorous
role in the junior farce, "The Prin
cess Enone." Swift also represented
one of the leading characters in the
latter play. Baker performed a
difficult part in Ben Jonson's
"Every Man in His Humour" as
produced by the English Club last
semester. J. R. Ward also took one
of the parts in this play.
Rehearsals have already begun.
The female chorus will meet again
Wednesday afternoon, and a full
rehearsal will be held the same
evening in Assembly Hall.
