About as poor an exhibition of
rooting as ever took place upon a
Stanford field was given Saturday.
The attempt of the yell leaders to
extract a regular yell from the so
called rooting section was pitiful.
The rooting at the Nevada game
was a positive disgrace to the Uni
versity. This matter of rooting
has been harped on and criticized
for so long that the student body
seems to feel that poor rooting is
the proper thing, and that articles
admonishing them to wake up are
unavoidable, and a set custom, as
much as the yelling itself. One
thing is certain: that unless the
rooters do display some life and
spirit they will be a positive dis
grace to the University on the day
of the big game. Nevada must
have thought that our rooting sec
tion was to be admired when the
University Band out-yelled the
whole section, and when the voices
of the three yell leaders were heard
plainly above the noise of the
bleachers. The rooters were lack
ing in volume at the Freshman
game; but if any more exhibitions
of yelling take place like that on
Saturday, it will be best to abolish
rooting, and confine ourselves to
hand-clapping.
