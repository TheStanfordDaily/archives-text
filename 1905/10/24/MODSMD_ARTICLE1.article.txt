# REHEARSALS STARTED
## DIRECTORS MEET CAST OF "THE BEAUTY SHOP." Two Competent Coaches Have Been Engaged.—Many Rehearsals in Next Few Days. 
### 
A rehearsal of the principals and
the male chorus for the football
show was held last night, and the
characters were given their parts.
Two experienced coaches have
been secured to direct the show,
Mr. Frank Blair, who is at present
stage director at Fischer's Theater
in San Francisco, and Mr. George
Towle, leader of the orchestra at
the Grand Opera House.
Both are talented in their pro
fession, Mr. Blair being especially
capable. For five years prior to
entering upon his present duties,
he directed the staging of amateur
plays at Harvard University with
