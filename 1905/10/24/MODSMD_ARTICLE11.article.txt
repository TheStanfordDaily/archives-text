# NEW TRACK MATERIAL
## SEVERAL PROMISING FRESHMEN OUT FOR TRAINING. Many Men with. Good Preparatory School Records Will Not Practice Until Spring. 
### 
Work among the track men has
been going on steadily for the past
month and there are a large num
ber of promising candidates taking
part in the fall training. Several
of the men go out every afternoon,
but the majority only train three
times a week, as Trainer Moulton
does not believe in having the men
work too hard in the fall.
Among the athletes now out for
fall training on the track there are
several Freshmen who should fig
ure in the meets to be held next
spring. Last year the Freshmen
on the Varsity track team made
twenty-two and two-thirds points,
but it has been generally conceded
that '08 was a remarkably strong
track class.
There were twelve Freshmen on
the team which met California last
spring.; and although only four of
them made points, the rest will no
doubt be point winners this year.
The present Freshman class will
probably not have as many star
men as '08 had, but from present
indications there are a good many
Freshmen who will make strong
bids for places on the Varsity track
team next spring. Probably the
beet-known Freshman track ath
lete is W. M. Rawles, the CJkiah
quarter-miler and jumper. In the
Academic Athletic League field
meets Rawles was a first-place man
in the quarter, and he has made
fast time in this event. He is also
a fairly good broad and high
jumper. A. E. Roth, also a Ukiah
athlete, has a good preparatory
school record in the 100- and 220-
yard dashes. F. M. Smith, a
FreBhman from the East, has done
well in the sprints and may do
something in the 100- or 220-yard
dash. E. A. Richardson of Denver
may develop into a good hurdler.
W. K. Ford is probably one of the
best weight men in the Freshman
class. He did well in the shot-put
and hammer-throw while at Ukiah
High School. These are five of the
Freshmen who are out for fall
training. Aside from these men
there are several other Freshmen
with preparatory school records
I who have not come out yet. Among
the Freshmen who were out for
football there are several who prom
ise to make reputations on the
track as well. F. J. Tarney, J.
Parma, C. C. Owen, I). P. Craw
ford, and J. R. Holman are all
men who have done track work
and will undoubtedly be out next
spring. There are also other
Freshmen who have not appeared,
and it is a little too early to make
any predictions as to the strength
of : 09 on track. However, it is safe
to say that there is an abundance
of good material, and a few stars.
