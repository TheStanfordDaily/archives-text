The students of the University
who have been selected to take part
in the football show entitled "The
Beauty Shop" have but a short
time to practice their roles. Com
petent. coaches have been secured,
but the success of the production
depends on the conscientious work
of each member of the cast, and the
University expects them to produce
a play that will be a credit to the
University and make a favorable
impression upon Stanford's visitors
on that night. As it will not be
purely a Stanford audience, it will
probably be more critical, and at
tendance at every rehearsal is ne
cessary to make the production a
success.
