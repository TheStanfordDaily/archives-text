The University public awoke
this morning to find a pamphlet
headed "Bogie" scattered broad
cast over the campus. It is not
the intention nor the desire of the
Daily Palo Alto to review or criti
cize this pamphlet in so far as its
general nature and purpose is con
cerned. It is sufficient to say that
its author or authors decidedly
overstepped the bounds of propriety
and decency in this effort to be
humorous. A wholesome josh is
always welcome and especially in
a university community, but we
hope that the sentiment of Stanford
men will ever be against such vul
garity as is expressed in the
t'Bogie."
