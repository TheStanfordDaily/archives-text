# TICKETS FOR THE BIG GAME.
## Number Sold to Each Student Will Be Limited to Eight. 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the intercol
legiate varsity game will go on sale
the morning of November first.
Eight tickets will be the maximum
number which will be sold to one
person, and a Btudent can pur
chase this number only by pre
senting written orders from other
students. Every rooter must sign
for his own ticket, except where he
buys more than one. In that case
the student must not only present
written orders for them but must
also sign for them himself. No
tickets will be sold except to
registered students.
Stanford and California will
each have 700 reserved seats. The
rooting sections will be located at
the west end of the bleachers, two
divisions from the curve.
Manager Barrett offered Mana

the California rooters will have sec
tion H, on theshady side of the field.
