# California 21, Indians O.
## 
### 
California defeated the Sherman
Indians Saturday in Los Angeles
by the score of 21 to 0. The con
test was rather one-sided, the visit
ors clearly outclassing their op
ponents at every stage of the game.
California played a bucking game,
and never lost the ball on downs
although forced to kick twice. In
the first half two touch-downs, a
kicked goal and a field-goal were
made, and in the second half a
touch-down and a goal. During
the second half California used
many substitutes. Neaphus, the
crack right-half for the Indians,
was severely injured, and will be
out of the game for the next few
weeks.
