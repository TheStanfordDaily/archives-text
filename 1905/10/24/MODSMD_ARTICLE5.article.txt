# WILL SAVE COSTUMES
## SWORD AND SANDALS TO PRESERVE STAGE PROPERTIES. Plans to Secure Title to Scenery of Stanford Plays from Managers of Productions. 
### 
The members of Sword and San
dals Dramatic Society are consid
ering plans for securing the title to
the left-over costumes and scenery
of performances given on the Stan
ford stage. A meeting of the or
ganization will be held about the
last of this month to take active
steps in acquiring the ownership
of various stage properties now
stored in the basement of the As
sembly Hall and other places about
the campus. The plan is to ar
range with the treasurers of the
various committees in charge of
Stanford productions and have
them leave their properties in
the hands of Sword and Sandals.
Manager Barrett will be asked to
turn over those costumes now in
possession of the student body, and
the English Club will probably be
requested to assist in the work of
preserving the old properties.
At present as soon as a produc
tion is over the costumes and scen
ery are cast into the basement of
the hall or carried away, to be neg
lected. The dampness of the As
sembly Hall basement is very in
jurious to them, and the scenery
becomes cracked and torn, and
valuable stage property is ruined.
If Sword and Sandals secures the
title to these properties, it is the
intention of the organization to
build lockers for the careful preser
vation of a wardrobe which will
probably be located in the Assem
bly Hall, provided permission can
be secured to build the locker
there.
Should the plans of Sword and
Sandals work out successfully a
store of farce paraphernalia will be
saved up, which may be used for
future productions. Renting of
costumes and scenery will in a
large measure be unnecessary, since
it will be possible to alter the older
costumes with little inconvenience.
The present members of the or
ganization are: E. R. May, '06,
president; H. Barkan, '06, secre
tary-treasurer; P. C. Edwards, '06,
D. D. Sales, '06, J. C. Ray, '07, and
R. L. Kellogg, '07. Officers for the
semester will probably be elected
at the next meeting.
