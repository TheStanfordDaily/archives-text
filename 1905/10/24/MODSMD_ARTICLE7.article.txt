### 
The contract for the interior
woodwork of the new Bookstore has
been given to a San Francisco firm,
the terms calling for the comple
tion of the work by the middle of
December. A total of $4,000 will
be expended in building partitions,
bookstacks, showcases, and other
fixtures on the interior of the build
ing. A very fine South American
mahogany, called jenezerro wood,
will be used. This wood was chosen
especially for several large panels
which will give the store a very
beautiful appearance when com
pleted. It cost but $300 more than
any of the woods ordinarily used
for interiors of buildings, and is
much more beautiful.
The contract comprises the par
titions between the offices of the
manager and bookkeeper, the stock
room, and the reading-room. It
includes sixty feet of showcases,
and ten hardwood stacks in which
the main stock of books will be
kept. Vertical showcases will
also be built around the walls for
the exhibition of photographs, ban
ners, pennants, athletic goods, elec
trical instruments, and other stock.
A revolving glass case will be con
structed so as to be reached from
the three directions of the mana
ger's and bookkeeper's offices and
the purchaser's counter.
A good feature of the new Book
store will be the reading-room, in
which the reading desks will be
placed for the inspection of new
publications by the students. The
shelves in this room will be kept
filled with the latest books. All
the interior plans were designed by
Prof. A. B. Clark of the Drawing
department.
The work of tiling the roof was
begun yesterday and will not be
long in completion. The first con
crete facing has been completed and
gives a good idea of how the build
ing will appear when the final gray
tinting is finished.
