A rumor was prevalent on the
campus the first of the week to the
effect that the rooters at the big game
would be moved nearer the ends of
the field than last year, and that part
of the men would actually be seated
behind the goal-line. This rumor
has proved to be groundless, and
the rooters will occupy the same
places that "they have in former
years. The rumor caused much
discussion among the men who
compose thd rooters' section, and
this may bear fruit in later years.
This year the tickets are probably
printed, and the matter has come
up too late; but in the future the
rooters ought to be given seats not
near the end of the bleachers, but
squarely in the middle of the field.
The rooters are entitled to these
seat√ü. Football is undoubtedly
played largely for the spectator,
and the spectator most interested
is undoubtedly the undergraduate.
The undergraduate rooter sup
ports the team throughout the sea
son, both by his cheering and pay
ing gate money; he is the one
who has the welfare of his college
at heart, and his every desire is to
see the eleven successful. To place
this rooter down toward the end of
the field and give the best seats to
those who do not deserve them but
are able to pay the greater price is
inconsiderate and ungrateful, to
say the least. Money necessarily
enters into the plans for a football
game, but it seems advisable to
change the location of the rooters'
seats as early as possible. With
both bodies of rooters in the middle
of the field, opposite each other, it
would seem more plausible that
the game was being played princi
pally for the undergraduate.
