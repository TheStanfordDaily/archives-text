the Russo-Japanese war, has writ

Jordan, as follows:
Dear President Jordan.
I thank you warmly for the gen
erous letter you were good enough
to write in my behalf.
Thanks to the open-hearted hos
pitality of your professors and stu
dents: I had a better time at Palo
Alto than I have had in years.
Believe me, I have not met so
white an outfit since I carried a
carbine with the Rough Riders.
L. S. J. U. is all right!
Very sincerely yours,
Edwin Emerson.
