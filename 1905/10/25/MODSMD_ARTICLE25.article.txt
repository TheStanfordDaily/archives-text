# BASKET-BALL MEN SEEK COACH
## Players Will Attempt to Comply with the Conditions of the Executive Committee. 
### 
The decision of the Athletic
Committee, to the effect that the
basket-ball them cannot use the
name of Stanford until the sport is
better organized and a competent
coach engaged, has led to active
steps being taken by the players to
carry out the conditions imposed
by the committee.
The management is now doing
its best to obtain a coach. If
possible, the services of some mem
ber of the faculty who has had ex
perience in basket-ball will be
secured. There are several mem
bers of the faculty who are known
to have played basket-ball, and it
is probable that from among this
number it will be possible to obtain
a competent coach.
