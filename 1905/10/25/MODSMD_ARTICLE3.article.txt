# ELLERY'S BAND PLAYS.
## Interested Audience Hears Classical Concert in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Before a small but highly ap
preciative audience, Ellery's Roy
al Italian Hand last night delivered
a concert in Assembly Hall. The
selections were ior the most part
chosen from well-known classical
compositions, and every piece was
vigorously applauded. Signor Fer
ulo proved a very interesting and
gracious leader, being so liberal
with his encores that the program
was lengthened to almost twice what
was announced. But one selection
was changed from the previously
announced order, a lighter minuet
being substituted for the heavier
"Prayer, from Cavalleria Rusti
cana."
