# PRACTICE IS SPIRITED
## HARDEST SCRIMMAGE OF SEASON LAST NIGHT. First Eleven Experiences No Difficulty in Scoring on the Second Team. 
### 
The football squad were given
their last severe training and prac
tice yesterday afternoon, in prepar
ation for the contest next Saturday
with the Sherman Indians at Los
Angeles. The men are, for the
most part, in excellent physical
condition. Stott, '07, ressumed his
old place at quarter again, and
Fenton was also on the field for a
little while. He devoted most of
his time to drop-kicking, which
was of first-class order. Dole, '07,
Fenton, '08, and Crawford, '09,
were given practice in place-kicking
at distances varying from twenty
to forty yards. Head-Coach Lana
gan and Assistant-Coach Bansbach
gave their personal attention to the
men who practiced drop-kicking
before the regular work of the after
noon began. Elementary princi
ples of the game were further in
stilled and the tiresome and less
interesting practice of falling on the
ball, running down on kicks, and
tackling the dummy constituted
part of the afternoon's practice.
Before the actual scrimmage
work commenced the three squads
were practiced at running in the
ball and forming interference after
the kick-off. No tackling was en
gaged in, the man catching the ball
running behind the interference to
the middle of the field, when an
other squad would receive the ball
and repeat the performance.
The last half of the afternoon
was given to a gruelling scrimmage.
The squad as a whole seems to be
slowly recovering from the slump
of last week, as the work of both
teams was of a much higher char
acter. Almost all of the men on
the squad were given practice either
in the first or second halves. The
work of the back-field on the first
team was better last night than on
any previous occasion. Consistent
gains were made in line-bucking, as
the second team seemed unable to
cope with the battering plunges of
the slightly heavier first eleven.
The interference formed to assist
the runner around either end was
exceptionally good. Time and
time again long gains were made
around the ends, due in a large
measure to the excellent interfer
ence. On one occasion the run
ner was sheltered by an interference
of three men who accompanied him
for more than thirty yards before
it was broken up.
The men who have sustained
slight injuries within the past two
weeks are all well again, and last
night's practice was marked by the
presence of every prospective Var
sity player. The return of several
injured players, coupled with the
general enthusiastic feeling per
vading the squad, characterized
yesterday's practice as one of the
most successful of the year.
This evening secret football prac
tice was held, no spectators being
