# BEGIN WORK ON FIELD
## GROUND BROKEN FOR WOMEN'S TENNIS COURTS. Contractor Will Rush the Task. Five Courts Planned by Association. 
### 
Work on the women's athletic
field, which will be located west of
the present Roble gymnasium, was
begun last Monday morning. Man
ager Barrett let the contract for
five tennis courts to Steve Ander
son of Palo Alto, who broke ground
on the new field two days ago.
The Women's Athletic Associa
tion authorized Manager Barrett to
let the contracts and build the
courts. These courts will be of dirt
and oil, and will be located on the
plot set aside by the Board of Trus
tees. The tennis courts will be en
closed with high fences, and hedges
will be planted around the fences
so as to secure perfect privacy.
The credit of rushing the con
struction of the courts is due in no
mean measure to the efforts of Miss
Jane Spalding, '06, and Miss Em
ma Hayward, '06, president and
treasurer, respectively, of the asso
ciation.
Almost $200 which has been set
aside for the purpose of starting the
field was secured chiefly from stu
dent body assessments paid by the
women students of the University.
A clause in the constitution speci
fies that one-half of the assessments
paid by the women shall go toward
an athletic fund for the women.
