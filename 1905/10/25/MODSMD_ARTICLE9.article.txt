# ASSEMBLY NEXT WEEK
## ALUMNI WILL ADDRESS UNIVERSITY GATHERING. Searles, Beedy and Frankenheimer Will Probably Be Speakers on Next Wednesday. 
### 
The fourth University Assembly
for thiß semester will be held on
Wednesday, November Ist. This
will be one of the most important
of this semester's assemblies, falling
as it does only two weeks before the
Varsity game. In past years it
has always been the practice to
make this a football assembly and
to have as speakers some of the
alumni who have won distinction
on former Stanford teams.
With this in view the faculty
committee decided that the assem
bly should be addressed by some of
the San Francisco alumni, and al
though it is not wholly a football
Assembly, the three speakers will
be Stanford graduates. The com
mittee feels that it is at this time
more than any other that the
alumni are drawn closer to the stu
dent body.
Dennis Searles, '95, L. S. Beedy,
'98, and J. B. Frankenheimer, '96,
have all given their tentative
promises to address the assembly,
and unless something unforeseen
should happen they will surely be
the speakers.

neer class from the Department of
Chemistry. He is at present presi
dent of the Stanford Alumni As

took a prominent part in under
