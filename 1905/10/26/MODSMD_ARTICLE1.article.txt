# TO REVIEW ALL SHOWS
## MEMBER OF FACULTY TO READ ALL MANUSCRIPTS. Instructor E.K. Putnam Empowered to Give Advice to Student Playwrights in Future. 
### 
The managers of the several
plays now in the course of prepar
ation for the Stanford stage have
been notified to the effect that the
manuscripts must be subjected to a
review by Instructor E. K. Putnam
of the English department before
they may be produced. This action
has been taken by the authority of
the Faculty Student Affairs Com
mittee, which desired that Mr.
Putnam, as general student adviser,
take charge of this particular
branch of student affairs. The ob
ject of this review of the plays by
a faculty member is not to exact a
strict censorship over student pro
ductions, but rather to give advice
and point out means of improving
manuscripts especially of parts
that may be objectionable.
The advising of student plays
has been done more or less regu
larly in past years. Professor A.
W. Smith of the Engineering de
partment at one time had the
matter in charge, but upon his
departure from the University the
Committee on Student Affairs took
action on the necessary occasions.
Last spring President Jordan ap
pointed Mr. Putnam to the position
of general student adviser. In this
capacity Mr. Putnam is expected
to act as a friendly adviser to stu
dents in any matters that do not
concern the major professor. Thus
far his duty has consisted largely
in assisting new students in regis
tration and in getting started with
their work.
The Committee on Student Af
fairs will not take any action on
productions reviewed by the stu
dent adviser unless it becomes
necessary to issue orders concern
ing the text of the plays. It will
be the policy of the adviser to re
move any bitter or misdirected
"hits" from the manuscripts,
whether they concern officers of the
university or students; but this is
not the only object of the office, as
constructive as well as destructive
advice will be given.
During the present week Mr.
Putnam is engaged in reviewing
the three plays, "The Beauty Shop,"
"All Tangled Up," and the Plug
Ugly, which are now being re
hearsed.
