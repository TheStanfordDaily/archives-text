# Machine Shop Nears Completion.
## 
### 
The work of the stonemasons
employed on the new addition to
the machine shop has been com
pleted and the roofing will be
started shortly, although the con
tract does not call for the comple
tion of the structure until the be
ginning of next semester.
The building, which is to be of
the regulation huff sandstone with
tiled roof and concrete floor, is di
rectly adjoining the old shop. It
will he 130 by 50 feet, and one story
in height.
The annex will be used largely
as a machine shop, but some space
will probably be devoted to the ac
commodation of new testing appara
tus for use in laboratory courses.
