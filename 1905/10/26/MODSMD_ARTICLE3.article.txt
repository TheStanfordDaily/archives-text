# BOAT CLUB FARCE FRIDAY EVENING
## "All Tangled Up" Will Be Presented in Assembly Hall To-morrow Night. 
### 
To-morrow evening the Boat Club
farce, "All Tangled Up," will be
presented in the Assembly Hall.
The production bids fair to be a
complete success, the cast being
strong and the players having been
trained by a most competent coach,
Mr. Paul Gerson of San Francisco.
The University Orchestra will fur
nish the music.
The Boat Club will introduce an
innovation in college dramatics by
having two specialties given be
tween the acts of the regular pro
duction.
Miss Claire Pedlar, '07, who takes
the leading female part in "All
Tangled Up," is well known upon
the Stanford stage, having taken
an important part in the "Rivals,"
produced last semester by the Class
of 1907, and "Every Man in His
Humor," the last production given
by the English Club.
Miss Clarice Moise, '07, and Miss
Katherine Clover, '07, who take the
other female roles, have been very

successful in their
parts. Nearly all the
parts tilled by men are
important and there is
no distinct star role.
D. D. Sales, '06, L. W.
Cutler, '06, and R. H.
Baker, '08, have what
might be termed the

most important roles, and these
players have all been doing well in
the rehearsals.
The performance will start at
8:15. The complete cast follows:
Major Hollis Halliday, who finds
some things more twisted than
law L. \V. Cutler, '06
Lester MacVey, his easy-going
partner in the law firm of Hal
liday & MacVey
J. M. Ward, '07
Keeling Plantum, proprietor of
an undertaking and tomb
stone business..R. H. Baker, '08
Lieutenant George Rapley, a
wealthy young man from the
West i). D. Sales, '06
O'Toole, a family treasure
F. A. Curtin, '08
Mrs. Halliday, inclined to jeal
ousy Miss Clarice Moise, '07
Clara, her daughter, inclined to
Rapley.. . Mies Claire Pedlar, '07
Vernie, tin* undertaker's daugh
ter, inclined to Lester
Miss Katherine Clover, '07
"All Tangled Up," as the title
implies, is full of complicated and

laughable situations. The action
centers around a certain Major
Halliday, who goes to a reunion of
his regiment, and, a little the worse
for wine, has a quarrel with an un
known personage. The major tells
his partner and they both fear that
it is a General Le Roy, a famous
duelist.
Keeling Plantum, a harmless un
dertaker, while looking for Halli
day, is taken for Le Hoy, and much
confusion results. Plantum is also
mistaken by a rich young man,
Rayley, for the major, and Rapley
asks him for his daughter's hand,
meaning that of Clara. The plot
becomes still more confused when
MacVey, who has secretly married
Plantum's daughter, Vernie, hears
from Plantum that his daughter is
promised to Rapley. All unite in
denouncing Rapley, who is enraged
and challenges everyone to a duel.
The plot finally works out and the
explanations satisfy all except
Mrs. Halliday. The plan closes
with the attempt of the characters
to explain to that lady the various
theories of the trouble.
