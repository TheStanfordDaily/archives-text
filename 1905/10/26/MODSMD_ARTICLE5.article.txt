# MAY APPOINT ALUMNUS
## TRUSTEES TO FILL VACANCY AT MEETING TO-MORROW. Many Other Important Matters Will Be Brought Up for Decision of Board. 
### 
A very important meeting of the
Board of University Trustees will
be held to-morrow in San Francisco.
This meeting is of the greatest im
portance to Stanford, as in all
probability a new member will be
appointed to the board to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of
Mrs. Stanford. While it is impos
sible to ascertain exactly who the
appointee will be, it is almost cer
tain that the position will go to an
alumnus, in accordance with Mrs.
Stanford's plans.
Last night there was a meet
ing of the executive committee
of the Stanford Alumni Association
in Palo Alto, at which a petition
was drawn up to be presented to
the trustees. This petition recites
that it was the expressed wish of
one of the founders that the board
should eventually be made up of
alumni; that the committee thought
there were able and available men
among the alumni for the vacancy;
and finally, that they asked the
board to make a thorough canvass
of the Alumni Association before
selecting the new appoinlee. The
committee did not feel that it had
the jurisdiction to recommend any
individual candidates and present
them for the consideration of the
trustees.
The report, which appeared this
morning in one of the San Fran
cisco dailies, to the effect that the
committee meeting yesterday was
the work of a particular faction in
the association is untrue, and it is
greatly regretted that such a story
appeared at this time. The further
statement in the report that yester
day's meeting was attended only
by the three Palo Alto members of
the commitee —Wilbur, Wright and
Williams — is untrue, as both Col
lins and Searles came down from
San Francisco to attend the meeting.
There was no factional feeling in
the matter, and the San Francisco
alumni have co-operated enthusi
astically with the so-called "cam
pus crowd" in making representa
tions to the board.
Beside the matter of filling the
vacancy, the report of the commit
tee appointed to confer with the
Encina men with regard to the re
cent disturbance in the hall, will
be presented at this meeting. It is
highly probable that the trustees
will discuss the matter thoroughly,
and will take some steps for the
betterment of conditions in Encina.
The matter of the danger to the
University water supply by the
new wells of the Spring Valley
Water Company will also come up
for discussion.
There is a strong possibility
that the trustees will take
some action regarding the new
bleachers. The final acceptance
or rejection of the work of the
work of the contractors rests with
the trustees, and their decision may
be made to-morrow. While the ac
ceptance of the bleachers has not
been officially assured, the fact that
the trustees have been repairing the
roads leading to the new field
seems to point to a favorable de
cision on the part of the board.
