The advance sale of seats for
"All Tangled Up" has been so
light that those interested fear that
the meritorious undertaking will
not be a financial success. If the
production does fail for a lack of
support it will indicate a deplorable
indifference on the part of the stu
dent body to a worthy cause. The
men interested in boating are mak
ing a hard fight to have it ranked
as a regular intercollegiate sport,
and no better chance will occur for
the students to give a substantial
token of their appreciation of these
efforts than by attending the pres
entation of the Boat Club comedy
to-morrow night. Buying a ticket
to the farce will not be an act of
charity, for the persons composing
the cast insure the audience a
good show.
