The action of the Faculty Student
Affairs Committee in appointing a
member of the faculty to read all
plays is to be regretted aB impos»
ing a matter of red tape which is
irksome to the student body,
though it is expected that it will
not work any hardship on student
authors or productions. In fact
this adviser may be beneficial from
a literary point of view, but on
principle the introduction of this
censorship —for censorship it must
be called —seems to be wrong. As
a matter of necessity it does not
seem that the office is called for,
and the fact that this year's
Ugly" has passed successfully, fur
ther substantiates this fact. Jf a
Stanford production goes too far, is
it likely that the audience will
countenance the act? Has public
opinion so degenerated and lost its
weight at Stanford that we can not
depend upon it to regulate affairs
of this kind?
