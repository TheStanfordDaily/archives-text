# SEARLES WILL COACH
## MEMBER OF FACULTY TO AID BASKET-BALL MEN. Hartzell Will Assist in Turning Out Team.â€”Much Good Material iu the Squad. 
### 
Professor Colbert Searles of the
French department will act as
coach for the basket-ball men.
Searles has been prominent in all
branches of athletics, both as an
undergraduate in Wesleyan and as
a member of the faculty here. His
aid in the selection of a team and
in teaching the men to play a fast,
aggressive game will be invaluable.
He will be assisted by P. N. Hart
zell, '07, a transfer from Lehigh
University, who played on their
varsity team last year.
The action of the Executive Com
mittee in again placing upon the
table the request of the basket-ball
men that they be recognized has
led to increased activity among the
players. The general call issued
to all men interested in the game
has resulted in the turning out of
a large number, and the squad now
numbers twenty.
There is a wealth of good ma
terial in this number, and com
petition for places bids fair to be
very close and interesting. Now
that coaches have been secured,
a tentative first team will be se
lected to play the first games and
get a line on the men. Since the
men have signed strict training
rules, a great improvement can be
noticed in the speed of their play.
Team work is still weak, but this is
due to the frequent changes that
have been made in the line-up.
The men have been considerably
hampered by the poor baskets
which they have been forced to use,
but this defect will be remedied
sometime next week. New baskets
have been ordered and will be here
by that time.
