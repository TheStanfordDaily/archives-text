# TO ORGANIZE TENNIS SQUAD.
## Tournament for a Silver Cup to Be Held Late in November. 
### 
At a meeting of the tennis com
mittee of the Women's Athletic As
sociation held to-day, it was de
cided to organize a regular tennis
squad among the women who are
now in college. A meeting for this
purpose will be held Wednesday,
November Ist, at 4:30, in room 49
RobleHall. The idea in forming
the squad is the desire of the ten
nis committee to arrange a sched
ule of practice for the members, so
that there may lie equal opportu
nity for all to practice on the Roble
courts. The only requirement for
membership on thesquad is regular
practice. The plans of organization
will be outlined definitely at Wed
nesday's meeting, to which all
women interested in tennis are
urged to come.
The committee is planning for a
doubles championship tournament,
to be held the latter part of No
vember, the exact date to be an
nounced later. At that time there
will also be a singles championship
tournament for the awarding of the
silver cup, presented to the winner
by the Women's Athletic Associa
tion.
Owing to a slight injury to one
of the players, the final match for
the interclass championship in
singles has not been played off.
