By the persistent efforts of a. few
undergraduates it seems that the
popular game of basket-hall is at
last to gain a foothold in the ath
letic life of the University. There
has always been a half-hearted in
terest in the sport aroused by the
gymnasium directors, and a pre
tense of organizing a team has
been made several times, but for
years there has not been a squad
of any size devoted to systematic
practice. Four times a week a
well - organized squad of some
twenty men now meets regularly at
Encina gymnasium, and by their
own efforts they have now succeed
ed in securing the services of two
competent coaches. Those ac
quainted with the game say that
the material at hand is excellent,
and therefore there seems no rea
son why a good team cannot be
turned out this year. Undoubtedly
the success or failure of the new
undertaking depends entirely on
the interest taken by the student
body. The material is at hand,
the movement has been inaugurat
ed, —all that is needed is the hearty
cooperation. Basket-ball in East
ern colleges ranks in interest with
baseball. The University of Cali
fornia each year has a large squad
devoted to this sport. There is no
reason why Stanford should not be
well represented.
