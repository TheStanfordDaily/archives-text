# No Game To-morrow for Second Team.
## 
### 
The second team will not play
to-morrow as was expected. The
Santa Clara College team could
not be secured as opponents, and
although Acting-Manager Thomas
received a favorable reply from the
University of the Pacific eleven, it
was decided to call the game off.
