# U.C. Loses Distance Man.

### 
A. S. Moody, one of California's
strongest long distance men, will
not be seen on the cinder path
again. He was taken seriously ill
Sunday, complications arose and
an operation was necessary. The
attending physicians say that
Moody will not be able to run
again. His loss will be keenly felt
by Berkeley, as he was the main
stay in the distance events.
