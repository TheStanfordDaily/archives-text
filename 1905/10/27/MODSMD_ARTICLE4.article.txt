# PLANS FOR GOLF CLUB
## NEW LINKS AND CLUBHOUSE PROBABLE. Business Office Will Set Aside Land for Nine-Hole Course and Grounds. 
### 
How soon the Stanford Golf
Club will reorganize and have links
of their own now rests with the
Business Office. As soon as the
report of the man in charge of the
land bearing crops is made and the
suggested land surveyed, the rental
will be decided upon, and the mem
bers of the club will take steps
toward the laying out of the
grounds. In all probability a
meeting of the club will take place
within the next two weeks.
The revival of golf is the result
of a petition to the Board of Trus
tees submitted last spring and
signed by 150 members of the
faculty and the student body. An
organized club has not existed
since 1901, when there was a nine
hole course back of the Cooksey
house. There were a great many
expert players in the University at
that time, and the membership of
the club was large. Interest died
out, however, and not until last
April was anything done toward
reviving interest in the sport.
Then the petition wa√ü referred to
the Business Office by the trustees.
Upon its being granted and the
land being specified, the petitioners
promise care of the grounds and
immediate reorganization.
If present plans are carried out,
a clubhouse will be erected and it
will be made possible to have
tournaments with other clubs. An
attempt will then be made to make
golf an intercollegiate sport, as it is
in the East.
At present there are a large num
ber of people interested in golf
among the students and the faculty.
Professor H. R. Fairclough and
Rev. D. Charles Gardner are both
experts, Professor Fairclough hold
ing the championship of the Fair
Oaks Golf Club. Among other
players are Professor A. T. Murray,
Professor R. E. Allardice, R. Horn
by, '08, one of the best known of
Southern California golfers, and T.
B. Griffith, '09, champion of Kan
sas. The membership of the club
should be very large and will be
open to every one connected with
the University. The annual dues
willjbe about -$3, which is reasonable
for a nine-hole course. The links
will probably lie in the vicinity of
the former course. At present
everything points toward a success
ful reorganization, and by Christ
mas the work on the grounds
should be under way. Undoubt
edly the clubhouse will be built in
the summer months, and golf tour
naments will take place regularly.
