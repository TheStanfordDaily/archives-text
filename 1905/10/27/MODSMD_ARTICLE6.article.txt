# WILL PLAY TO-MORROW
## VARSITY ELEVEN LEFT CAMPUS LAST NIGHT. Game with Sherman Indians Will Be Played in Los Angeles To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
. The Stanford Varsity will line
up against the Sherman Indians at
Fiesta Park in Los Angeles at 3:80
to-morrow afternoon. A squad of
twenty-two players, accompanied
by Head-Coach Lanagan and
Trainer Moulton, left for the South
last night. The team will have ac
commodations at the Angelus
Hotel.
The Sherman Indians have been
coached by Hempel, who last year
made the Pomona College eleven
one of the most formidable among
the minor Coast teams. The Indian
eleven has been augmented by the
addition of several crack Indians
who have not previously played
with them. This fact, coupled with
the excellent coaching they have
received this year, should make to
morrow's game important.
California defeated the Indians
last Saturday by the one-sided
score of 21 to 0. This decisive de
feat, administered only a week ago,
would indicate a comparatively
easy victory to-morrow, but the
coaches are not so sanguine, since
the Indians have had an extra
week's practice, and many positions
have had a complete shaking up.
The changes, according to Coach
Hemphill, will make a stronger
and a faster team than that which
lined up against the Blue and Gold
last Saturday. Neafus will be back
at quarter, and many people be
lieve that this fact alone will in
sure a steadier and more aggressive
team.
The Stanford coaches will put
all of the twenty-two men who
were taken on the trip in the game,
as the work of the men in this con
test will be important when the
time comes for the selection of the
team which will play against the
University of California.
The team will start on the return
trip to-morrow night.
