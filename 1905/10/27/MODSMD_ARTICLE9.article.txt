# NO FEMALE CHORUS.
## GIRLS DECLINE TO ACT IN "BEAUTY SHOP." Leading- Feature of Football Show Done Away With.â€”Men Will Take Women's Parts. 
### 
It has been found necessary to
dispense with the female chorus in
"The Beauty Shop," which was ex
pected to prove one of the most in
teresting features of the show.
The directors planned to have a
girls' chorus of at least a dozen
members, and to make particular
efforts to have their work the hit
of the evening. The committee
also in charge of the production, to
aid in carrying out this design,
were negotiating in San Francisco
for special electrical effects, intend
ing to go to considerable expense in
this way, to heighten the interest of
the dances.
All this work has apparently
come to naught, for it has been
found impossible to secure the re
quired number of girls. All seem
reluctant to take a part that even
ing, apparently having a miscon
ception as to the nature of the cele
bration. In view of this circum
stance, the committee this after
noon decided to eliminate the wo
men's chorus entirely, and as a
substitute to present a group of
men in female attire.
