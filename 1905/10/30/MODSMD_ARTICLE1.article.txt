# SOUTHERN TRACK MEET
## OCCIDENTAL WILL SEND TEAM NORTH NEXT SPRING. While at Los Angeles Barrett Discusses Meet Against an All-Southern California Team. 
### 
While Manager Barrett was in
Los Angeles with the football team
he discussed track prospects with
the managers of various Southern
California teams. Hagerman, the
Occidental College broad-jumper,
was especially anxious to obtain a
meet, and he claimed that Stanford
owes Occidental a separate meet
because Stanford's expenses were
paid to the south three years ago
by Occidental, and there has not
been a return meet. Barrett agreed
to give Occidental College a meet
on the Stanford campus about
March 25th.
In 1902 when Stanford met Oc
cidental the score was 50 to 40 in
favor of Stanford, but this year the
Occidental team is reported to be
especially strong.
The idea of arranging a track
meet between a picked team from
Southern California and the Stan
ford track men was discussed.
Manager Barrett said he would
either take a team south, or have
the southern men come up to Stan
ford.
In case a meet should be arranged
between an All-Southern California
track team, the result would be
very doubtful. Hagerman, the Oc
cidental broad-jumper, and Wil
hoit, a pole-vaulter of St. Vincent's
College, would both be reasonably
sure for first places. Besides these
two stars there are several fast
sprinters at the University of
Southern California and also at
Pomona College.
