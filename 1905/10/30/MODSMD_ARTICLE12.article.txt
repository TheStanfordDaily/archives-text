The football men are to be con
gratulated on the scholastic record
they have made thus far, and it
will be pleasing news to the stu
dent body that the action of the
Schohi rship Committee has de
prived the squad of only one prom
inent player. This record is in
striking contrast to that of past
seasons, when the depredations of
the committee caused the loss of so
many good players. The result
this year is another triumph for
Coach Lanagan, who began the
season by insisting in the most
positive terms that the candidates
for the Varsity should keep up in
their studies. At the same time,
the students who do not play foot
ball were cautioned to refrain from
discussing the game with the play
ers, in order that their minds mignt
not be distracted from their work.
We believe that this advice has
been generally heeded by a major
ity of the undergraduates; but it
might not be amiss to repeat the
warning at this time, as it is vitally
necessary that the players should
be as free as possible from worry
during the short time that inter
venes before the annual game with
California.
