# Committee on Scholarship Acts.
## 
### 
As h result of the meeting of the
Scholarship Committee on last
Thursday afternoon a number of
students have been notified that
their work is not up to the proper
standard. In accordance with the
policy outlined by the committee
early in the semester, no official
"warnings"have been sent out as has
been customary in the past. The
fifth article of the printed policy
states that "mid-semester reports on
scholarship shall be obtained from
all instructors, and students shall
be notified of their deficiencies."
Under this ruling the Scholarship
Committee is to-day sending notifi
cations to students deficient in but
one course. Those deficient in two
or more subjects received their no
tifications Saturday, and ore re
quired to consult with the secretary
of the Committee on Scholarship.
The figures of the committee's
action ore not yet obtainable, but
no one has as yet been dropped
from the University on account of
scholarship.
