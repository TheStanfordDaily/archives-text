The Board of University Trus
tees met Friday afternoon in San
Francisco, and discussed a number
of questions of great interest and
importance to Stanford. Unfor
tunately the policy of the board
makes any definite statement im
possible as to what these questions
were and what disposal was made
of them. Nothing official regard
ing the action of the board was
made public after the meeting, and
in the absence of President Jordan
from the University the various
rumors regarding the meeting of
the trustees cannot be confirmed.
The petition of the alumni re
garding the appointment of Mrs.
Stanford's successor was presented
to the board, but it is impossible to
learn what action they took in the
matter. No appointment has been
announced. The report of the en
gineers who inspected the bleachers
was submitted and was laid on the
table for further consideration.
Beside these two matters the board
also took up several questions of
interest to the University at large.
The rumor that C. G. Lathrop
intends to resign his position as
University treasurer, in favor of
G. C. Crothers, is denied at the Busi
ness Office. The rumor seems to
have originated in the fact that Mr.
Crothers has been temporarily fill
ing Mr. Lathrop's position while
the latter is away in the East.
