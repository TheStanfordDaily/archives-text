Stanford defeated the Sherman

and most hotly contested which
the Varsity has played this season.
When interviewed to-day, Head-
Coach Lanagan, '00, said: "We
were better than the Indians by
the score of 6-4. It was the hard
est game we have played this sea
son."

Neither team scored in the first
half, although both elevens had
possession of the ball at different
times. In the second half Stan
ford scored a touch-down by con
sistent line bucking and end run
ning. Tortes made four points for
the Indians after they had made
two unsuccessful attempts to ad
vance the ball by bucking the line.
The place-kick was made from the
25-yard line, the ball soaring high
above the cross-bar and safe be
tween the goal-posts. In the first
half the Indians had the better of
the contest, forcing through the
line and around the ends in great
style. In the second half, however,
the Indian back-field could not ad
vance the ball so readily, which re
sulted in a punting duel between
Crawford and Neafus.
Neafus was the star player for
the Indians, running the team in
an excellent and careful manner.
He was responsible to a large ex
tent for Stanford's low score. The
Indians played good defensive foot
ball, stopping the continuous on

slaught made by the backs in tan
dem plays in an admirable man
ner.
Stanford played a number of
substitutes, while only one man
in the official Indian line-up was
replaced on account of injuries.
Crow played excellent ball but was
unfortunate in one of the line
plunges and hurt his ankle, which
later compelled him to retire from
the game. The injury sustained
Saturday will prevent him from
playing in next Saturday's game
against the University of Southern
California, and it is still undecided
whether he will be able to play in
the intercollegiate match.
No score was made in the first
half. The detail of the second half
concerning the score follows:
Crawford kicked off in the sec
ond half to the 10-yard line and
Lugo returned the ball 30 yards
but dropped it when tackled. Stott
recovered the ball on the 40-yard
line. Vandervoort made 2 yards
on a straight buck at left tackle,
followed by Thompson for 3 yards
more. Vandervoort advanced the
ball 30 yards around right end.
The next play resulted in no gain,
and Vandervoort was sent over for
4 yards. Stanford fumbled on the
1-yard line and the Indians kicked
15 yards. Vandervoort gained 2
yards, and by a series of bucks
Stanford advanced the ball to the
5-yard line. Vandervoort made 3
yards, and Thompson was sent
over for a touch-down. Crawford
kicked the goal. Score 6-0.
Neafus kicked off to Chalmers
for 45 yards. On the third down
Crawford punted 45 yards to Nea
fus, who was downed in his tracks.
Lugo made 3 yards through center,
but Coleman failed on an end run.
Neafus punted 40 yards to Stott,
who failed to return the ball. Craw
ford punted 35 yards on the third
down and Neafus returned it on the
second down for 30 yards. Stan
ford was penalized 15 yards for
tripping an Indian. Crawford
punted 35 yards and Tortes re
turned it 5 yards, and on the next
play advanced the ball 5 yards.
Lugo made 25 yards on a tackle
around play. Five additional
yards were made, and Coleman ad
vanced the ball 4 yards around
right end. On another tackle
around play Lugo carried the ball
