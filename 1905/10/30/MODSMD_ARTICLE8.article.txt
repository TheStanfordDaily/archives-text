# COMEDY IS A SUCCESS
## BOAT CLUB FARCE A BRIGHT AND CLEVER PLAY. "All Tangled Up" Well Received Friday Evening.â€”Financial Return Is Small. 
### 
"All Tangled Up," presented by
the Stanford Boat Club in the As
sembly Hall last Friday evening,
was a decided success. The farce
abounded in clever dialogue and
comical situations, and the acting
of the members of the cast was
warmly applauded in every in
stance.
It cannot be said that there was
any particular star, the work of
the whole cast being of a finished
order. L. \V. Cutler, '06, was very
effective as Major Hollis Halliday,
and Miss Clarice Moise, '07, as the
major's wife was a distinct success.
Miss Pedlar, '07, and Miss Clover,
'07, did remarkably well in their
parts of Clara and Vernie. J. M.
Ward, '07, who took the part of
Major Halliday's partner, Lester
McVey, succeeded admirably in a
difficult role. D. i). Sales, '06, as
Lieutenant George Rapley played
a strong and well-balanced part.
11. H. Baker, '08, and F. A. Cur
tain, '08, both showed skill in the
handling of their parts.
The special performances which
were given between the acts made
a distinct hit. Between the first
and second acts W, \V. Wirt, '06,
and R. G. Osborn, '07, did some
clever buck and wing dancing.
The second specialty consisted of
a couple of coon songs by P. N.
Hartzell, '07. The second of these
songs, a clever hit upon a promi
nent member of the faculty, liter
ally brought down the house.
The play was not a financial
success. After deducting all ex
penses the balance left for the Boat
Club will not be over one hundred
and sixty dollars. Since the debt
of the club is approximately seven
hundred dollars and the amount
in the treasury about one hundred
and thirty dollars, the club will
still have a deficit of about four
hundred dollars. The attendance
at the comedy was small, although
there was an increase in the sale of
seats at the last moment. The
entire sale made a total of about
four hundred dollars.
