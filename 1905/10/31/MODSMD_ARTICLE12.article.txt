The mere fact that the coaches
have announced that there will he
secret practice during this week
and part of the next would seem to
be sufficient reason for the people
of the University to refrain from
going near the football oval, or at
tempting in any way to watch the
men at work. But this has not
proved to be the case. Men have
taken advantage of the cracks in
the fence, and have stood there
brazenly, seemingly forgetful that
the)' were committing an act which
the student body does not counte
nance. Men perched in dormitory
windows—and these are not all
residents of the dormitory —are far
ther removed, but they are com
mitting the same breach. It seems
that it would take very little reason
ing power for these men to realize
that if the coaches did not want
them to sit on the bleachers and
watch the squad, they do not want
them to sit a few feet farther away
or to peek through a fence and
watch proceedings.. The men who
spy on secret practice in the future
should be treated similar to men
who break training rules.
