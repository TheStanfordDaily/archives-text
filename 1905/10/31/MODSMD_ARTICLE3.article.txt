## COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO TAKE CHARGE OF BLEACHERS. White Varsity Emblem Will Be Formed in Cardinal Rooting Section. â€”Names of Ushers. 
### 
The appointment of the following
committee to decorate the bleachers
for the intercollegiate game has
been announced by Manager Bar
rett: E. C. Rittenhouse, '04, chair
man, C. Tayior, '06, E. A. Cunha,
'06, C. H. Paxton, '06, and B. O.
Webber, '08. This committee will
follow the instructions of Barrett
in decorating.
It is probable that the bleachers
will be arranged in the same man
ner as last year, the white block
"S" being the main feature. The
letter will be formed in the same
manner as last year, by having
members of the rooting section wear
white garments. Two large Stan
ford pennants will fly from the top
of the Cardinal section.
The Training House Corporation
also expects to have Stanford and
California pennants over the cor
responding sections of the training
house on the day of the game.
Members of the alumni have had
under consideration a plan to 6et
off day fireworks, but nothing defi
nite has been done. It is probable
that the Decorating Committee will
make some further arrangements,
but all other features that are
planned will be kept as a surprise
for the day of the game.

ushers and gatekeepers at the game:
