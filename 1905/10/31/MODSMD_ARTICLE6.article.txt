# ALUMNI WILL SPEAK
## MEETING WILL BE LAST ASSEMBLY BEFORE GAME. Searles, '95, Frankenheimer, '96, and Nourse, '00, Will Speak on Football To-morrow Morning. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 11:15 the
fourth University Assembly of the
year will take place in Assembly
Hall. In accordance with the es
tablished custom, the Assembly,
which is the last one before the
date of the Varsity game, will be
devoted to speeches on football sub
jects, delivered by three prominent
members of the San Francisco
Alumni Association. Every effort
will be made to make the meeting
successful in arousing enthusiasm
for the big game, and in extending
to the alumni a cordial welcome.
It was announced last week that
Dennis Searles, '95, J. B. Franken
heimer, '96, and L. S. Beedy, '98,
would in all probability be the
speakers at to-morrow's Assembly.
Searles and Frankenheimer will
deliver addresses, as was expected,
but owing to unforeseen circum
stances Mr. Beedy has been pre
vented from coming to the campus,
and his place will be taken by John
T. Nourse, '00. The subjects on
which these men will speak have
not been announced, but all will
have some bearing upon football,
either regarding the present season's
prospects, or matters which the
speakers may see fit to dwell upon
in the history of past seasons at
Stanford.
All three of the alumni who will
speak were prominent during their
undergraduate careers. Searles
graduated with the pioneer class in
the department of Chemistry, and
his interest in Stanford affairs since
that time was recognized last May
in his election as president of
the Stanford Alumni Association.
Frankenheimer is also a graduate
of the Chemistry department, hav
ing taken his degree with the class
of '96, and while in college was said
to be the man most feared by Cali
fornia on the gridiron. He played
left half on the Varsity teams of
'95 and '96, helping materially to
pile up the score of '20 points which
was made in the latter year.
John T. Nourse is a member of
the class of 1900, and held many
positions of trust while in college,
at one time being student body
treasurer. He is at present en
gaged in the office of the city attor
ney in San Francisco.
