# SQUAD WORKING HARD
## CANDIDATES FOR VARSITY ELEVEN PRACTICE SECRETLY. Additions Made to Training-Table Last Preliminary Game Next Saturday. 
### 
The football squad will continue
to practice behind closed gates the
remainder of the week, except on
Saturday, when the Varsity meets
the eleven from the University of
Southern California on the campus
gridiron. Part of next week will
be devoted to secret practice, and
the coaches have not decided on
which days the students will be
allowed to watch the squad at work;
but it is probable that there will be
open practice on more than two
days. Until next Saturday, how
ever, no one who is not officially
connected with the football work
will be granted admission.
All the candidates for the Var
sity are reporting daily, as the men
who received slight bruises in last
Saturday's game with the Sherman
Indians are in condition again. All
the men are well from injuries sus
tained prior to the Indian game,
and systematic work is daily being
done. The trip to Los Angelee, al
though hard on the players, seems
to have been a splendid bracer, for
the men are playing with better
spirit and more determination than
before. All of the squad who went
south seem to have been benefited,
whether they had an opportunity
to play or not, for the change was
particularly helpful.
Five additional men have been
training since Sunday. They are:
Bogle, '06, full-back; Frizzell, '06,
guard; Lamb, gr., end; Koerner,
'08, end; Cox, '08, center. The men
who are now eating at the table
with Coaches Lanagan and Bans
bach and Trainer Moulton, besides
those given seats yesterday, are:
Molfino, '07, center; Thompson, '05,
guard; Stanford, '06, end; Stott, '07,
quarter-back; Rook, '06, half-back;
Fenton, '08, quarter-back; Chal
mers, '07, half-hack; Crow, '07, full
back; Dole, '07, half-back; Slusher,
'07, full-back; Vandervoort, '08,
half-back; Laumeister, '07, quar
ter-back; Lyons,'o6, end; Horton,
'08, tackle; Crawford, '09, tackle;
Gay, '08, tackle, and Pemberton,
'08, tackle. There are twenty-two
men on the table at present.
