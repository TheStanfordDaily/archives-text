Thk University community has
two just grievances against the
method of conducting the seat sale
for the big game. In the first place,
adequate accommodations were not
reserved for the Stanford rooters.
The entire section has heen sold,and
there are a number of men in the
University who were unable to ob
tain seats. Some of these men are
especially entitled to seats in this
section, for they have supported
Stanford as rooters in the past. All
the male students who are unable
to obtain seats are being done an
injustice. They are entitled to seats
in the section, and provision should
have been made for them. When
Stanford is able to furnish the larg
est body of rooters in the history
of the University, it is a pity to be
unable to seat this body in a com
pact mass. The second point is
that many people feel that they
were not sufficiently informed of
the time and place of the sale. The
sale was first announced for the
first of November but the date
w;is later changed to November 2d,
Thursday. The day was then
changed to the original date,
November Ist, Wednesday. This
change, however, was not made un
til late yesterday afternoon, and
consequently many people did not
know of the sale until late last
night or until this morning. The
fact that the general student body
were not given sufficient notice of
the sale gave the people who pos
sessed the knowledge an unfair ad
vantage.
