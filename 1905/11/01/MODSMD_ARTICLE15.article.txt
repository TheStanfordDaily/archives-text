# OCTOBER ISSUE OF "ALUMNUS."
## Archie Rice, '95, Contributes an Interesting Article on Football Situation. 
### 
The October issue of the Alumnus
has appeared. Ihe paper is of
the usual size, hut ihe subject mat
ter is far less interesting than
usual. The main feature of the is
sue is the reappearance of football
news from the pen of Archie Rice,
'95. Rice has always made a care
ful study of Stanford athletic con
ditions, and is one of the recognized
authorities on Coast football. This
month's Alumnus contains a review
of the Freshman game, illustrated
with a detailed diagram of the
play.
While plainly stating that Stan
ford had the better team, Rice at
tributes her defeat to poor work
in the back-field and bad general
ship. Beside this article Rice has
a careful review of the football sit
uation regarding the coming Var
sity game, and picks the tentative
line-up of the teams on November
11th.
Editorially, theAlumnus deals with
the first great game on Stanford's
new field, and also the progress on
the campus in the past ten years.
A poem by C. K. Field, '95, on
the burning of lights all night in
Encina; an article on the "Train
ing House Corporation," by F. L.
Berry,' 99, and "Progress of Stan
ford Buildings," by C. G. At,wood,
'06, make up the rest of the num
ber. There is also the usual quan
tity of alumni notes.
