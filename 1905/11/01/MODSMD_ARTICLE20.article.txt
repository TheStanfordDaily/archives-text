# Posters for Big Game on Sale.
## 
### 
The football posters for the big
game arrived to-day. They are of
two kinds, one for advertising pur
poses, and the other for sale as sou
venirs. The illustration is a young
woman seated outdoors and seem
ingly studying a spectacle of great
interest. At each side is a cupid,
one dressed in a Stanford sweater
and the other in a California
sweater. The background is a green
field with oaks.
The chief difference between the
two posters is that the art poster is
printed on a buff-colored mat, and
does not contain any information
concerning tickets and trains for
the game. Copies may be procured
for twenty-five cents at the Uni
versity Bookstore or from 11. !S.
