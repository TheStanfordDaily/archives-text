# ADDRESSES BY ALUMNI
## THREE GRADUATES TALK AT THE ASSEMBLY. Football, Professional Life, and Pioneer Days Subjects of the Speeches. 
### 
A large and enthusiastic audience
gathered to listen to addresses from
the three members of the San
Francisco Alumni Association at
the Assembly this morning. The
gathering was especially a notable
one as the last regular University
meeting before the big game, and
for this reason more than the
usual amount of time was taken up
with singing and yelling. A
cordial welcome greeted the alum
ni upon their appearance on the
platform.
Professor A. G. Newcomer,
chairman of the Committee on As
semblies, introduced the several
speakers and began by speaking
of the relations existing to-day be
tween the undergraduates and the
alumni. In introducing Dr. J. B.
Frankenheimer, '96, of San Fran
cisco, who was the first speaker,
Professor Newcomer referred to
him as the man whom Califor
nia feared most of all Cardinal
players. Dr. Frankenheimer
spoke on the subject of football, as
a game, weighing the advantages
and disadvantages to the player,
and discussed a few points that
have recently come up in the de
velopment of the sport. The
advantages of football to the play
er, he said, far outweigh the risks
he takes in entering the game and
such slight and transitory injuries
as are the lot of the average football
player. At the end of his four
years of college football the player
will find himself well developed,
not only physically but mentally,
and especially will the mental
training stand him in good stead
in after life. He will have devel
oped the qualities of quick observa
tion, enthusiasm, self-restraint,
team work and fair-play. In the
big game, Frankenheimer said,
the alumni will look to Stanford
for a good, clean, glorious victory
by unprotested players, coached by
a graduate coach; and, barring this,
a defeat under the same conditions.
John T. Nourse, who was the
next speaker, left the subject of
football, and spoke on the subject
of "How to make the most of a
profession." In the legal profession
to-day, he said, fortunes are not
made bv fees, but by investments
which the lawyer is able to enter
into through his connection with
his client. The ideal lawyer will
not only be free of all such dishones
ty,but will give his services gratui
tously to alleviate wrong, and even
at considerable sacrifice to himself
will set aside a part of his services
for those who daily find them
selves in the necessity of appearing
in court without proper counsel.
Dennis Searles, '95, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
spoke feelingly of the pioneer days
of the University, especially in con
nection with the first, football
games between Stanford and Cali
fornia. Addressing "the future

alumni," he Baid in part: '"In the
old University Library, which was
located in one of the rooms of
the inner quadrangle, there hung
a copy of the plans for the great
er buildings of the University. I
recall looking at them at the
time, and wondering if it would
be within my lot to witness their
completion. It seems scarcely pos
sible that ten years have been
enough to bring this about, â€”and
the men of '95 who return to the
campus to-day have considerable
difficulty in finding their old
haunts, so great has been the
change."
