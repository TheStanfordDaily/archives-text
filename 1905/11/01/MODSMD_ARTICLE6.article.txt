# FIELD IS COMPLETED
## LAST WORK ON NEW STADIUM WILL BE DONE TO-MORROW. Score-board and Goal-posts Yet To Be Erected and Ground Prepared. 
### 
The woodwork of the new foot
ball field will be completed to-mor
row, after which nothing will re
main to he done on the new grounds
except the preparation of the field
for the game. The painting of the
bleachers is being hurried to a rapid
completion, and the seats are being
numbered as fast as they are fin
ished. When the last nail has
been driven Stanford will possess
one of the finest football fields in
the country.
The new field has been erected at
a cost of approximately $8000, on
land allotted by the Board of Trus
tees in 1904. The bleachers have a
seating capacity of 15,500 and are
four feet higher than the California
bleachers. In erecting the new
bleachers special attention has been
paid to their strength. Professor
C. B. Wing, who donated his ser
vices in designing them for the
Training House Corporation,
planned them to bear a pressure of
180 pounds to the square foot.
The training-house, located be
neath the west end of the bleachers,
will also be practically completed
to-morrow. It will be painted
green, and the interior woodwork
waxed and stained. Telegraph and
telephone connections will be made
for the day of the game, and elec
tric lights are being put in.
A feature of the new field will be
a large score-board, which is to be
located above the board fence at
the east end of the grounds. The
board measures six by eight feet,
and will be painted black. A plat
form, erected in front of it, is for
two score-keepers to stand on. They
will receive signals from an expert
on the side-lines, and will chalk up
the down and number of yards to
gain after each scrimmage. On the
board "Stanford" will he printed
in white, ten-inch letters, and be
low it a space will be left where the
name of the visiting team may be
placed in chalk. After each name
the number, of points scored by
each team will be marked up.
The goal-posts are to be set back
from the edge of the field, to remove
any danger of the players being
hurt. This arrangement is accom
plished by extending the cross-piece
inward by means of braces.
