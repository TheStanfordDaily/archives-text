# FALL MEET ON TRACK
## NOVEMBER 18TH DATE SET FOR FIRST CONTEST. Many Entries Expected.—Five Places Will Be Given.—Track Will Be in Good Condition. 
### 
The annual fall track meet will
be held on Saturday, November
18th, one week after the intercol
legiate football game. Many of the
men have been training for nix
weeks, bo Trainer Moulton and
Captain Macfarland think it ad
visable to hold the contest just as
soon as possible.
Until last year the field meet in
the fall had been a handicap event;
but a new system was inaugurated
last fall, when, instead of giving
men handicaps, five places were
given. The plan will be followed
in the meet on November 18th.
First place will count five points,
second place four, and so on, each
event having fifteen points instead
of the usual nine.
All the distance events will be
shortened, — as the half-mile, mile,
and two-mile runs. Last year the
Freshmen won the meet with over
thirty points to spare. The track
meet in the fall is particularly for
the purpose of bringing out new
material and affording the trainer
and captain an opportunity to get
a line on the new men. All those
who have any intention of coming
out next spring should enter in this
meet.
During the past two weeks
Trainer Moulton has had several
loads of soil hauled over to the
oval, and it is being put along the
inside of the track; and unless there
should be some unusually heavy
rain, the track will be in fine con
dition for the meet. Entries will
be received the day before the meet,
at the training shed.
