# CARNEGIE'S GREAT GIFT.
## Ten-Million-Dollar Pension Fund Will Do Much for the American Universities. 
### 
A great deal of comment has
been aroused in the Eastern press
by the recent establishment by
Anderew Carnegie of a fund of ten
million dollars,the income of which
shall be used for the relief of aged
professors. Typical of these com
ments is an article printed in the
New York TYi&une,which we reprint
herewith:
"Mr, Carnegie's gift of $ 10,000,000
to provide retiring pensions for
college professors is one of the most
useful of his long list of benefac
tions. No class of men or women
give more to their fellows in pro
portion to their pecuniary rewards
than teachers. Most of the colleges
pay ridiculously small salaries, as
average income and necessary cost
of living are scaled to-day. Few
college professors are able to ac
cumulate a oompetence sufficient to
support them adequately ill their
old age.
"The Carnegie fund means com
fort and an honorable retirement
for an extremely worthy oluss of
persons, and at the same time it is
an indirect aid of large proportions
not merely to its particular bene
ficiaries, but to the educational
institutions and their work. It
means relief to the endowment
funds, especially of the less wealthy
colleges, from burdens not strictly
educational, and the reinforcement
of faculties.
"Almost every college has upon
its staff at least one man who ought
to be retired, who' himself realizes
that his best work is done, but who
feels obliged to go on teaching in
order to live. He has probably
been in the college many years and
has the love of all the alumni.
The trustees would never think of
taking away his salary, and even
when disability actually forces his
retirement they will continue him
as professor emeritus in the occu
pancy of his endowed chair, with
at least part of its income. That
respect for old age and faithful
service is worthy of all praise, but
it has its practical disadvantages.
It results in putting classes under
men who are no longer able to give

the best instruction, and it tuxes
the funds of colleges so that even
when they do reinforce their
faculties they have to divide their
income among effective and ineffec
tive men.
"Of course, under such circum
stances the best teachers cannot be
secured. Mr. Carnegie's gift prac
tically amounts to an endowment of
new chairs in hundreds of colleges.
The annual income of $500,000
from the fund will be sufficient to
provide half pay for from two
hundred and fifty to three hundred
men. As State and strictly sec
tarian institutions do not. partici
pate, this should provide for at
least two pensions in each of the
institutions which Mr. Carnegie
seeks to benefit.
' It was a happy thought of Mr.
Carnegie to group American, Cana
dian and Newfoundland institu
tions together as participants in
this pension scheme. The political
line should not divide the English
speaking scholars of this continent.
They should be brought together in
ties of sympathy and interest.
Colleges in the United States will
surely welcome this additional bond
with the institutions across the
border.
"The supporters of the State uni
versities, whose professors are ex
cluded from Mr. Carnegie's list,
will soon be under the necessity of
matching his generosity and mak
ing provision for their superan
nuated teachers where they have
not already done so. The City
College here, which is a public
institution, pensions its teachers,
just as the teachers in the public
schools are pensioned, but few
legislatures have yet taken a broad
enough view of the claims of the
State-supported universities.
"The sectarian colleges have less
to hope for than the public institu
tions. Most of the colleges included
in Mr. Carnegie's scheme were
sectarian in origin, but they have
grown out of it for all practical
purposes. Perhaps the trustees are
by custom largely of the founding
denomination, or some chairs are
endowed for members of that de
nomination, but their support
comes mainly from other quarters,
as do their students. The colleges
which are still so partisan as to
be without the pale of Mr. Carne
gie's gift must look for their
pensions, as for other resources, to
what is left in this day of Christian
fellowship of strict sectarian zeal."
