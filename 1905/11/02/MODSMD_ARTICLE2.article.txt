# FRESHMEN TO PLAY FACULTY.
## Baseball Game Arranged for First-Year Men on Saturday-Morning. 
### 
The Freshman baseball squad,
which has been practicing on the
University diamond for the past
two weeks, will play its first game
Saturday against the faculty team.
Last year a game was played about
this time between a picked 1908
team and the faculty, which proved
a great help to the coaches in
getting a line on the work of the
first-year men.
The Freshman line-up has not
been announced as yet, and any
'09 men who report on the grounds
will be given a chance to show
what they can do. Many of the
men who will play in Saturday's
game come to Stanford with good
preparatory school records, and
the Freshman team this year
should be exceptionally strong.
