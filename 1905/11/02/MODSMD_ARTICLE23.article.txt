# PROPOSES FOOTBALL RULES.
## Caspar Whitney Offers Suggestions for the Colleges of America. 
### 
Caspar Whitney, editor of Outing,
has devised a set of rules to govern
intercollegiate football. They are
of particular local interest, as they
aim to place contests between uni
versities under one directive head
throughout the United States.
Players must be amateurs in
good regular standing and must
have been in academic residence at
least a year. The faculty of each
college is to be the sponsor of its
own teams, and no protests are to
be made. There shall be a tribu
nal for discussion and regulation
of competition. It shall be com
posed of one representative each
from Harvard, Yale and Princeton,
appointed by the faculty; one each
from the New England and Southern
Intercollegiate Association; two
from the Middle West; one from
the Pacific Coast; and one at large,
not identified with any college, to
be elected by the others. No paid
coach or trainer is to be eligible to
the tribunal, whose decisions are
final.
