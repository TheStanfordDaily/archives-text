# DUFFY'S RECORD NULLIFIED.
## Sprinter Confesses That He Was Professional When He Ran as Amateur. 
### 
Arthur Duffy, holder of the
world's amateur 100-yard record at
9 3-5 seconds, is to be expelled
from the American Athletic Union
and all his records expunged from
the books of the league and from
the intercollegiate records.
Duffy recently gave a talk be

fore a company of athletes, in
which he spoke of athletic condi
tions, of the professionalism of
amateur athletics, and of the money
earned hy purely amateur sports
men, taking his own case as an
example.
This confession only confirms
the suspicions which have long
been prevalent concerning the won
derful sprinter's amateur standing.
Western Manager McCaughern,
'05, of the American Athletic
Union, who was captain of the

Stanford Varsity track team in
1902 and 1903, has stood for clean
sport for years, and it is under
stood that it was at his request
that the first investigation of the
standing of Duffy was made.
With the erasing of Puffy's
records there will be a grand rush
next spring among track athletes
to set a new mark for the 100- and
220-yard daghes, but it is probable
that it will be a long day before the
9 3-5 of the Georgetown man ie
equaled.
