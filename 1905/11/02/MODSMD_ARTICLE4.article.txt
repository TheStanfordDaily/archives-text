# PLUG UGLY TO-MORROW
## "PIRATES" TO BE PRESENTED ON THE OVAL. Junior Class Will Dedicate Hats. Cast of Characters of the Show. 
### 
The production of the annual
Junior Plug Ugly will take place
on the football oval to-morrow eve
ning at 8:15. The piece entitled
"Pirates'' by L. M. Edwards, '07,
and \V. F. Herron, '08, will be pre
sented, after which the Juniors
will don their painted plug hats
and attempt to march around the
quadrangle. This annual Junior
festivity has become a recognized
feature of theatricals during the
fall semester, not because of its ar
tistic presentation, but because of
the significance attached to it by
the wearing of the Junior plug.
The large number of men in the
class compelled the commiteee to
select a Plug Ugly which would
afford an opportunity for many to
take part. No football man will
take part in the production, as was
at first anticipated, since the
coaches do not wish to run the risk
of having men injured in the con
test with the Seniors after the Plug
Ugly is over.
