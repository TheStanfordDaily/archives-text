# LARGE TENNIS SQUAD
## TWENTY-TWO WOMEN SIGN FOR FALL PRACTICE. Largest Squad in the History of Intercollegiate Tournaments to Work on Roble Courts. 
### 
The formal organization of the
women's tennis squad was perfected
yesterday at a large meeting held
in Roble Hall. The chief topic
under discussion was the use of the
women's courts, and it was decided
that any members of the associa
tion who will agree to practice
regularly three times a week may
have the use of the courts at stated
hours three times a week. This
decision includes any women stu
dents in the University who will
agree to practice regularly, the
skill of the individual players not
being taken into consideration.
The schedule of hours for prac
tice will be posted on the courts
and in the gymnasium as soon as
it is completed.
Twenty-two players signed for
practice yesterday. This is a
larger number than has ever been
out before. Any woman wishing
to join the squad and have a regu
lar practice hour assigned may do
so by applying to Miss Emma
Haywood, '06, tennis manager.
The organization and direction of
the squad is being carried on by
the tennis committee of the
Women's Athletic Association, Miss
Elsie Owen, '07, captain, Miss Em
ma Haywood, '06, manager, and
Miss Merl Morris, '08.
