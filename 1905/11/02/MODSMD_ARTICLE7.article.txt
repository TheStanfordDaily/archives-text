# SEAT SALE TUESDAY
## TICKET FOR "BEAUTY SHOP" TO BE ONE DOLLAR. Will Be Sold at Box Office on Quad. One Person May Purchase Ten Seats. 
### 
Seats for"The Beauty Shop" will
go on sale on the quad at 9 o'clock
Tuesday morning. A flat rate of
one dollar will be asked for seats in
all parts of Assembly Hall. There
will be no general admission, all
the seats being reserved, and the
first in line Tuesday morning will
have their pick of the house.
To eliminate the possibilities of
scalping, Treasurer Barrett an
nounced this afternoon that he
would not sell more than ten seats
to one person, and then only upon
presentation of written signatures
for each ticket. Tuesday morning
will be reserved for the sale of tick
ets to undergraduates, faculty and
alumni. In the afternoon outsiders
may buy seats.
On account of the general inter
est in the show it will probably not
be deemed neccessary to go to the
expense of issuing a po√üter as first
planned.
