### 
A number of offers for post-sea
son games have been received by
R. \V. Barrett, manager of the foot
ball team, but none of them will
be considered because of the
opposition of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee. The University
of Colorado, which was defeated by
the Stanford team by the score of
33-0 last year, desires to play
again in Denver this Thanksgiving.
The Denver Athletic Club is also

that have been received are with
the Haskell Indians in San Fran
cisco on Christmas, with Pomona

with the University of Utah in
