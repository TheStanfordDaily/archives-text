The persistent failure of certain
students to obey the coaches' re
quest to keep out of the Encina
windows during secret football
practice is distinctly humiliating,
fur we have but recently been con
gratulated on our comparative free
dom from muckers and mncker
ism; and this latest outburst of the
evil does much to upset the com
placency of the University. It is
to be hoped that the indignation
exceed by the actions of the dis
loyal men, who have been peeping
from the security afforded by the
dormitory, will result in such dras
tic action against the offenders that
they will never dare to repeat the
offence. In this connection it
might be well to suggest that the
punishment of the culprits be left
in the hands of the members of Eu
cina Club. Several of the guilty
men are not inmates of the Hall,
but this is no reason why they
should not be dealt with by the
club, which will no doubt be
anxious to vindicate the good name
of its members.
Herafter, the name of any man
caught watching secret practice
from the windows of Encina Hall
or through the cracks of the fence
surrounding the oval will be pub
lished in the Daily Palo Alto.
