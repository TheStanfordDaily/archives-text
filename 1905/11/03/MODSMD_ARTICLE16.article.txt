Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As u student, loyal to Stanford
and to all the University activities,
I cannot help regarding the edi
torial attacking the University
Band in the last issue of the Cha
parral as Bcurilloue and outrageous}.
It is to be expected that every stu
dent activity and every prominent
mail in the University will be sub
jected to the ridicule of our alleged
humorous paper. Indeed, the ordi
nary knocking resorted to in that
sheet has grown so stale and
nauseating that it is no longer
taken seriously by anyone familiar
with its methods. But the Chapar
ral has an extended exchange list,
and it seems that every sentiment
of decency, loyalty, and good taste
would have moved it to refrain
from pictuiing any University
situation as an object worthy of
the scoin of other universities. 1
charge (In- editor of the Chaparral
and every one of his associates who
in any way approved or counte
nanced the above mentioned edi
torial with utterly lacking the com
mon loyalty and spirit which the
humblest student in the institution
is expected to display.
The University Hand, far from
meriting the storm of abuse
launched forth upon it in the
Chaparral, is entitled to the very
highest credit. They give their
services freely at every game and at
every dramatic performance. Every
one vise who eerves his University
receives compensation in some
form, either in sweaters, emblems,
medals, or various other badges of
honor. Hut the Band receives
nothing,â€”not even the thanks of
the student body. Its sole reward
is an abusive shower of vitriol and
foul-smelling acid from the Chapar
ral.
It may be said, in reply to these
remarks", that the editorial referred
to was a joke. But the article
went far beyond the limits of clean
legitimate humor, and I leave it to
the fair-minded judgment of the
whole University whether at the
very eve of the great game with
California the Band, which plays
such an important part at that
game, should be maliciously at
tacked by a Stanford publication.
"Junius."
