# TRUSTEES MET FRIDAY
## FAILURE TO SECURE QUORUM PREVENTS DEFINITE ACTION. According to Reports Given Out Today the Board Discussed Questions Informally. 
### 
Owing to the lack of a quorum
sufficient to justify their voting on
any important measures, the Board
of Trustees were unable to accomp
lish anything definite at their meet
ing last Friday. According to the
report of the meeting which was
given out yesterday, beyond voting
the usual monthly appropriations
for the maintenance of the various
University departments, the board
did nothing more than discuss in
formally the various important
questions which were presented to
them.
The petition of the alumni re
garding the appointment of Mrs.
Stanford's successor was read and
laid on the table. The prevailing
sentiment among the members of
the board present at the meeting
seemed to be that nothing should
be done until at least a year after
Mrs. Stanford's death, there being
no immediate necessity for the ap
pointment of a new member to the
board. Whether the majority of
the trustees will take this view of
the matter, when the quorum of the
board is present, remains to be
seen in the future.
Regarding the recent trouble in
Encina Hall, the board seemed to
think that some radical change
should be made in the government
of the Hall. The trustees seem to
favor a modified form of the plans
proposed by the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs and the Encina
representatives at the meeting of
October 12th. The main features
of this plan include a special faculty
committee in charge of Encina af
fairs, co-operating with a body of
upper-classmen elected by the En
cina Club as their representatives.
Of course this plan is purely ten
tative, but it is interesting as an
expression of the ideas of the board
on this difficult problem.
The trouble over the threatened
danger to the water supply by the
action of the Spring Valley Water
Company, in boring wells near
Menlo, was brought up before the
meeting. After some discussion
the matter was left to the action of
the people of Palo Alto, who have
taken up the matter with the com
pany. The next meeting of the
board will be held on the 24th of
November.
