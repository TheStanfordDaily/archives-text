# FINAL VARSITY GAME
## LAST PRELIMINARY GAME OF SEASON TO-MORROW. University of Southern California Football Team in Fine Condition for Hard Struggle. 
### 
The last preliminary game of the
season will be played on the cam
pus gridiron to-morrow afternoon
at 2:30, when the Varsity will meet
the eleven from the University of
Southern California.
Coach Holmes, Manager Buck
master, and seventeen players ar
rived from Los Angeles last night.
They are being entertained at En
cina Hall and at the various frater
nity houses on the campus.
The southern team has been in
hard training since September 18th,
almost as long as the Varsity. They
play a fast, open style of ball, and
are particularly strong on the de
fensive. The team has the reputa
tion of executing more plays to the
minute in a game than any in the
south. Their offensive playing and
scoring ability was tested in a game
with the eleven from the Whittier
State School two weeks ago, when
the team from the University of
Southern California made fourteen
touch-downs. The Whittier team
was much lighter, but the lack in
weight was offset by the short
halves played. The seventy-five
points were scored in twenty-six
minutes of actual play, and seven
substitutes were played on the
U.S. C. team.
They have defeated all the elev
ens whom they have played, and
have not been scored against this
season. Harvard School was de
feated 12-0; Company F, 29-0;
Polytechnic High, Los Angeles,
27-0; and the alumni of the Uni
versity of Southern California,62-0.
The remainder of their schedule
includes games with Occidental
College, St. Vincent's, Pomona and
the Sherman Indians.
The Varsity has had a week's
secret practice since the contest
with the Sherman Indians, and it
is anticipated that the showing
to-morrow will give some indica
tion of what the coaches have in
store for the intercollegiate game
with the University of California.
The squad is in good condition,
and the coaches will give a number
of the men an opportunity to play
to-morrow, for it will be the last
chance to try out some of the can
didates.
The line-up will be as follows:
STANFORD U. 8. C.
