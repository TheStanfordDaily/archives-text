their class debating team, and af
ter listening to their arguments
Instructor L. P. Lewis, Professor
L. E. Bassett, and H. M. Lewis,
'04, the judges, selected I). E.

and A. L. Kocher as the best speak
ers. By this decision the first three

a University contest.
The successful candidates all
showed thorough knowledge of
their subjects, and much skill in
logic and delivery. Mahon made
a strong speech against the adop
tion of the same policy by the
United States in the Philippines as
in Cuba. His effective presenta
tion of the negative arguments on
this question appealed to the judges.
Politzer probably made the best
talk of the evening. In a quiet,
logical manner he presented an ar
ray of facts against the resolution
that the United States should re

of territory in South America,
which opponents were unable to
combat. Bush urged the abolish

and probably won him the place.

and delivery induced the judges to
make him alternate.

allotted seven minutes, the first af
firmative on each squad taking an
