# DEBATING TRIO CHOSEN
## SHELTON, NEWLANDS AND HERRON BEST OF SOPHOMORES. Much Ability Shown by Speakers. None of Last Year's Team Enter Try-out. 
### 
W. C. Shelton, L. Newlands and
W. F. Herron will represent the
Sophomore class in their debate
against the Freshmen three weeks
from next Friday, and \V. H. Bor
land will he alternate.
The nelection of this team was
made by Professor C. H. Huberich
and Instructor \V. N. Hohfelt of
the Law department and Registrar
O. L. Elliott, sitting as a committee
of judges on the merits of the vari
ous candidates, made Saturday eve
ning after the usual formal try
out.
Although the personnel of the
team is entirely changed from what
it was last year, the combination
chosen is undoubtedly a strong one.
From the abilities displayed by the
respective debaters in the try-out
it would appear that they combine
almost all the requisites of a good
team: Shelton displayed logic
and sound thought in his try-out
speech. Newlands was a thorough
master of his subject, and left no
point untouched to establish his
case. Herron attacked his oppon
ents vigorously on rebuttal and did
clever extemporaneous work. If
the Freshmen defeat this team they
will not only break all precedents
since the Class of 1904 won their
initial debate, but they will also
have the satisfaction of beating an
unusually strong interclass trio.
The four successful speakers have
had much experience in forensic
work. Newlands was alternate on
the 1908 team last year, whileShel
ton and Borland have participated
in several try-out debates. Her
