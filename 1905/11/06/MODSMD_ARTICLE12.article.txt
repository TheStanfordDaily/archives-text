# FRESHMEN LOSE TO FACULTY.
## Defeated 15 to 6 in an Uninteresting Game of Baseball Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
In a ragged and uninteresting
game of baseball the Freshmen
were defeated by the Faculty on
Saturday morning by a score of
15 to 6. The poor showing made
by the '09 baseball men is excus
able, however, in view of the fact
that they played two full teams
and many substitutes in the course
of the game.
The first team, which played
through the third inning, showed
up very well, holding the Faculty
down to two runs, and batting out
three themselves. Aside from the
first inning Goodell pitched a fine
game, and he should give a good
account of himself next season.
Gowan and Watson, who succeeded
him in the box, were wild and re
ceived a terrific hammering from
the Faculty hatters, which resulted
in the large final score.
The line-up follows:
