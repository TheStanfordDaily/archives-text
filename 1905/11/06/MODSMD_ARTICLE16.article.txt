# THIRD TEAM DEFEATED.
## Soldiers Have Little Difficulty in Scoring: on Lighter Opponents. Final Score 23-0. 
### 
The third team was defeated by
the Fifteenth Infantry at Monterey
last Saturday by the score of 23-0.
The heavy soldiers found little
difficulty with the light eleven,
and scored at will in the second
half. The score at the end of the
first half was 5-0. The soldiers
kicked off in the first half to the
10-yard line and by a series of
bucks the third team advanced the
ball to the center of the field and
were then forced to kick. The hol
diers scored their only touch-down
in the first half by a series of split
tandem bucks from their own 10-
yard line. Lieutenant Waugh
played a star game, running his
team in firt-t-class order. The
Stanford team lined up as follows:
Doane and Myers, center; Bee and
Wilde, right guard; Wilde, left
guard; Blood, left tackle; Gay,
right tackle; Derby and Riddell,
right end; Johnson and Sheehy,
left end; Laumeister and Owen,
quarter-back; Goldsmith (c) and
Ray, right half-back; Doig, left
half-back; Aynesworth, full-back.
