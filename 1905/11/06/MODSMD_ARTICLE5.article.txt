# STANFORD 16, U.S.C.O.
## Fast Team from Los Angeles No Match for Varsity, which Scores Three Touch-downs. 
### 
Stanford won the last prelimi
nary game of the season by defeat
ing the University of Southern
California by the substantial score
of 16 to 0 after a spirited struggle
on the campus oval Saturday after
noon. The Varsity relied princi
pally upon heavy mass plays, and
this method of advance proved
thoroughly effective but painfully
slow. This fact may be attributed
in part to the splendid defensive
game played by the visitors, but
on the whole it cannot be said that
the Varsity exhibited the scoring
efficiency which it possessed at the
corresponding date last year. Oc
casionally the monotony of the ad
vance was relieved by a quarter
back run or a dash around the end
of the visitors' line, but no unusual
formations were used by Stanford
at any stage of the game.
The southerners had the ball in
their possession but a few times,
and they lost it on fumbles as often
as on downs. But they held pos
session of the sphere long enough
to show that the team is one of the
fastest seen on the Stanford grid
iron this year. It was on the de
fensive that the visiting team made
its best showing. The line could
not withstand the terrific bucks sent
against it, but the magnificent
work of the backs made them a
formidable second line of defense.
Captain Elliott played his end in
good style, and Ochoa, the big In
dian full-back, proved himself a
star in both offensive and defens
ive work.
The game was discouragingly
slow until near the end of the sec
ond half, when a number of changes
in the line-up seemed to put new
life into the Varsity, and a rapid
series of plays gave the Cardinal
two touch-downs in the space of
eight minutes. The last touch
down was made after four spirited
plays, which included a spectacular
run of seventy yards from the kick
off by Vandervoort, and a smash
ing buck for twenty yards by
Slusher.

Stanford won the last prelimi
nary game of the season by defeat
ing the University of Southern
California by the substantial score
of 16 to 0 after a spirited struggle
on the campus oval Saturday after
noon. The Varsity relied princi
pally upon heavy mass plays, and
this method of advance proved
thoroughly effective but painfully
slow. This fact may be attributed
in part to the splendid defensive
game played by the visitors, but
on the whole it cannot be said that
the Varsity exhibited the scoring
efficiency which it possessed at the
corresponding date last year. Oc
casionally the monotony of the ad
vance was relieved by a quarter
back run or a dash around the end
of the visitors' line, but no unusual
formations were used by Stanford
at any stage of the game.
The southerners had the ball in
their possession but a few times,
and they lost it on fumbles as often
as on downs. But they held pos
session of the sphere long enough
to show that the team is one of the
fastest seen on the Stanford grid
iron this year. It was on the de
fensive that the visiting team made
its best showing. The line could
not withstand the terrific bucks sent
against it, but the magnificent
work of the backs made them a
formidable second line of defense.
Captain Elliott played his end in
good style, and Ochoa, the big In
dian full-back, proved himself a
star in both offensive and defens
ive work.
The game was discouragingly
slow until near the end of the sec
ond half, when a number of changes
in the line-up seemed to put new
life into the Varsity, and a rapid
series of plays gave the Cardinal
two touch-downs in the space of
eight minutes. The last touch
down was made after four spirited
plays, which included a spectacular
run of seventy yards from the kick
off by Vandervoort, and a smash
ing buck for twenty yards by
Slusher.
