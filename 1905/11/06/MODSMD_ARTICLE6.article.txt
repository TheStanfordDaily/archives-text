# PLUGS ARE DEDICATED
## RECORD CROWD WITNESS PRODUCTION OF "PIRATES." Juniors and Seniors Meet in Annual Affair on the Quad and at the Post-office. 
### 
The production of the 1907 Plug
Ugly on the football oval Friday
evening whs attended hy a record
breaking crowd. Fully twenty-five
hundred people were present, and
of these at least twenty-four hun
dred were paid admissions. The
play itself, "Pirates," was up to the
usual standard of Plug Ugly pro
ductions, but was nothing excep
tional. It had very little plot, and
the chief interest lay in the numer
ous local hits scatterred through
the two acts. The songs were writ
ten to some of the popular music of
the day, and one of them, set to the
air of "Tammany," was enthusias
tically received by the crowd.
Unfortunately for the actors, the
Seniors, who sat on the ground di
rectly in front of the stage, had
procured the manuscript before the
show. They took entire lines out
of the mouths of the players, and
forced them to very amusing repeti
tions. H. P. Bittner as D. C.
Guardian, R. A. Kellogg as Pegasus
Steward, and P. N. Hartzell as
Charley Meyers, did good work in
their parts.
Both the under classes attended in
a body and enlivened the proceed
ings before the beginning of the
play by yelling and joshing each
other. Later the Juniors entered
and gathered behind the stage,
while the Seniors mossed them
selves directly in front and did
their best to confuse the actors.
Before thesecond act was finished
they cut the performance short by
rising in a body and leaving the
oval. This was a signal to the
Juniors, who donned their plugs
immediately and started on their
march to the quad.
They ran from the oval to the
space by the University Inn with
no definite organization. There
they formed in a solid phalanx,
and avoiding the stepß in front of
the French department, where the
Seniors were massed to receive
them, rushed upon the quad by the
steps to the south. The Seniors,
who were surprised at this manoeu
vre, were unable to offer any effec
tive resistance and the Juniors
swept.on to the quad.
The third-year men made a cir
cuit of the inner quad and then
rushed to the post-office steps.
They were fiercely attacked there
by the fourth-year men, and the
hardest fighting of the evening took
place at this time.
Before the fighting on the quad
had been finished the Freshmen,who
had come from ttie football oval in
a body, attacked the Sophomores
upon the quadrangle. The trouble
culminated in a general rush upon
the baseball diamond, in which
honors were about even.
