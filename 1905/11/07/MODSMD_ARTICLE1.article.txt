# TO CONTINUE POLICY
## GUILD BOARD WILL ADMIT OUTSIDERS TO HOSPITAL. Reports Show That Results Justify Continuation of System Adopted This Year. 
### 
An important meeting of the
hoard of directors of the Guild
Hospital was held yesterday eve
ning. The chief business to come
before the board was the decision
as to whether the policy of admit
ting outside patients had been a
success. The financial side of the
question was thoroughly discussed,
and the board finally decided that
the experiment had been a com
plete success.
In accordance with promises
made to the physicians in Palo Alto
at the first of the semester, the
board was to admit outside patients
at least until Christmas, when they
would make their final decision.
At first the financial success of the
experiment was doubted, but the
favorable reports of yesterday's
meeting seem to indicate that the
policy will be made a permanent
one.
The report of Dr. Snow showed
that the Guild Hospital had treat
ed more cases this year than at a
corresponding date last year, in
spite of the fact that at this time
last year a small epidemic of diph
theria brought thirty patients into
the hospital. This would seem to
mean that there had been an in
creased amount of sickness in the
University community, but this is
not the case. The fact is that the
increased efficiency of service and
equipment at the hospital have
brought all the local physicians to
recommend it to their patients,
even though thev are not seriously
ill.
The report showed that a daily
average of from eight to thirteen
student cases have been in the hos
pital since college opened, and that
the average of outside cases treated
has been three per day. The out-j
side patients have in most cases
required serious surgical operations,
while the students' cases have not,
in general, been of a serious nature.
As was expected, the increased
revenue from the admission of out
side patients has paid for the extra
nurses employed and for the in
creased running expenses. The ad-j
ditional equipment and nursing
staff make it possible for the guild
to take care of a greater number of
student cases than at any time in J
the past.
A total expenditure of $1025.27
was authorized by the board to
meet the October running expenses.
Beside this, the sum of $250 was
voted for the payment of bills, for
equipment.
