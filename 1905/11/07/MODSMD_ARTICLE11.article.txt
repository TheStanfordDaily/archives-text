The Daily I'alo Alto to-night
takes the liberty of suggesting to
the Varsity yell leaders a change
in their methods at the Varsity
game—a change that we think will
make the rooting far more effective
and at the same time lighten the
labors of the men who help along
the game, or at least add to the en
thusiasm, with their lungs. What
we suggest is that we have no at
tempts to yell each other down, as
we did at the Freshman game.
Many persons who go to the game
are almost as much interested in
the display of colors and the root
ing and the enthusiasm as they are
in the contest itself. The rooters of
each side, too, are concerned in
whatever compliments the other
side has to offer. All the pleasures
of these little side-plays are lost
when both sides root at the same
time. In years past our yell lead
ers have had definite arrangements
with our friend the enemy that
there should be no cross yelling,
the single exception being in the
case of a certain yell to which our
friends are particularly averse to
listening in ijuiet. We need such
an agreement again.
Another thing. When Stanford
men sing "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"'
they stand. When California men
sing "Hail, California," they stand,
and so should we. This is the finest
compliment that one college can
pay to another. It was done a
year ago, but unfortunately not at
this year's Freshman game. It
should be done again, and always.
