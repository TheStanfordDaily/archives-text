# FEW EATING ARRANGEMENTS.
## No Official Action Taken to Accommodate Crowd at Big Game. 
### 
Aside from the student body
notifying the managers of the eat
ing places on the cam{tus and in
Phlo Alio that an unusually heavy
patronage may be expected on the
day of the intercollegiate game, no
definite arrangements have been

made for the accommodation of the
crowds that will be on the campus
on November 11th. Neither the
Training House Corporation nor the
Associated Students will assume
the responsibility of attempting to
supply any certain means by
which the visitors may secure
meals and lodging.
Most of the fraternities expect to
care for a large number of guests,
and it is probable that Encina
Club will be able to accommodate
many members of the alumni who
are coming to the campus on the
day before the game. Many pri
vate residences will also be thrown
open for the use of visitors. Man
ager Barrett is doing everything
to relieve the threatened congestion,
and the people coming from San
Francisco are being requested to
bring lunches with them. The
University Inn is making special
arrangements to furnish extra
meals.
