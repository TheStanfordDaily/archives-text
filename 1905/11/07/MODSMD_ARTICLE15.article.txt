# Faculty Will Entertain.
## 
### 
As the meansof obtaining lunch
eon on the day of the game are
likely to prove inadequate to meet
the demand, the house committee
of the Faculty Club has decided to
serve a buffet luncheon at the club
house from 11:30 until 1:30. An
invitation has been sent to the
members of the faculty of the Uni
versity of California extending
a welcome to each member of the
faculty.
Besides the combined efforts of
the club, many of the professors
will entertain individually in their
private homes. As' Dr. Jordan left
to day for the East he will not be
on hand to receive, but Mrs. Jordan
intends to have a large number of
intimate friends at the president's
residence.
