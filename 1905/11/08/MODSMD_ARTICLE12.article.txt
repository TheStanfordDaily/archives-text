# RALLY IN ENCINA HALL.
## Rooters Decide to Gather in Front of Memorial Arch Before Game. 
### 
A large and enthusiastic rally
was held in the Encina club-room
last night, and a number of im
portant questions in regard to
Saturday's game were discussed.
The meeting lasted about one hour,
the greater part of which was given
over to song and yell practice.
In discussing the arrangements
for the seating of the rooters Satur
day and for receiving the California
rooters, Yell-leader Cunha left
several questions to be decided by
the students themselves. It was
decided that all the rooters shall
meet in front of Memorial Arch at
1:15 on the day of the game, and
after lining up in order of the num
ber of each man's ticket, march to
the bleachers. In this way all
confusion in seating the rooters can
be avoided, and the Stanford con
tingent can make its appearance in
a body.
The question which was most
seriously discussed related to the
steps necessary for the protection
of the campus on the day of the
game The guarding of the new
athletic field was placed in charge
of the members of the Freshman
class, and a meeting of the men of
the first-year class will be held to
morrow to discuss arrangements.
It has not yet been definitely
settled as to whether the team will
remain upon the campus the night
before the game, but in case this
should occur the sentiment of the
entire student body was that abso
lute quiet should prevail. A large
attendance upon the bleachers is
expected at the last open practice,
which will take place to-morrow,
and the yell leaders will then give
the final directions for the rooting
on Saturday.
