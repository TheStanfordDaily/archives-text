Every loyal Stanford partisan
in the University must be present
in the Assembly Hall to-morrow
evening at 7:30. Every rooter
must be prepared to yell himself
hoarse. A spirit must be awakened
that will make the winning of Sat
urday's contest possible. A fight
ing "never die" spirit is sure to
pervade the University, and the
result of this Bpirit will be a victory
on Saturday. The team expects to
win, and we feel that they are go
ing to win. They will do their
part in actions upon the field; we
must do ours on the bleachers.
Over-confidence is bad, but confi
dence in the team at this time in
the season is not only desired but
it is essential. We will be the vic
tors in a hard fought game, and
part of the fighting is going to come
from the Stanford bleachers. Start
to-morrow night and give a fair
idea of how we are going to yell,
act and feel on the day of the big
game.
