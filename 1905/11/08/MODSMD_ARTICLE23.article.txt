# TRY-OUT FOR CHESS CLUB.
## Competition for Membership Starts. Few Players Turn Out. Material Is Good. 
### 
Although but few players have
turned out for the Chess Club try
outs, tlie material is much above
the average, and the outlook is
bright for a winning team next
spring. The tournament which is
to decide who shall become mem
bers of the club is now in progress.
There are eight vacant places,
six men who have previously
played on the Varsity team being
members without competition. The
club is much strengthened lÂ»y the
return of M. M. Sterns,'o6, to col
lege. Sterns has played in two
contests with the University of Cal
ifornia and is a clever player.
Owing to the scarcity of material
the club will permit any chess
player who wishes to try out for
the club to enter the tournament
now. All entries should be handed
to H. W. Strong, '06.
