# FINAL OPEN PRACTICE
## STUDENTS WILL HAVE CHANCE TO SEE TEAM IN ACTION. Last Work of Season Will Be Done To-morrow on New Field. 
### 
The Varsity will practice on the
new field to-morrow, and the stu
dents will be privileged to watch the
squad the entire afternoon. The
practice will consist for the most
part in signal work.
The men will not do any scrim
mage work, because of the nearness
of the intercollegiate match. The
students will have their last oppor
tunity of seeing the team in action,
as the work to-morrow will practi
cally close the season.
The players are in good condi
tion, and the general spirit prevail
ing is very good. The return of
Stanford, '06, to the equad has
cheered the men considerably, al
though Stanford is somewhat out
of form and slightly lacks practice,
he will probably be able to play
in next Saturday's game.
