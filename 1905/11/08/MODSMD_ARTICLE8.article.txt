# Will Not Use Training House.
## 
### 
The California team does not in
tend to use the new training house
under the west end of the bleachers
at the game Saturday, on account
of the fact that the rival coaches
might be heard through the par
titions. The walls have been
specially constructed to deaden the
sound, but the California coaches
prefer to take no chances. A tent
arrived from Berkeley this morning
which will he erected at theeastend
of the field for the use of the squad.
The training house will be occu
pied by the Stanford team.
