head linesman for the big game on
Saturday seems to be an argument
against having graduates of either
university officiate at intercollegi
ate contests. But the stand that
Manager Barrett has taken in in
sisting that he he allowed to name
the head linesman is not only to
be commended but it deserves the
support of every member of the
student body. Lat-t year a gradu
ate of the University of California
officiated as head linesman, and the
understanding was that Stanford
should have her representative in
this capacity this year. A question
of principle is at stake. Are we
going to stand up for our rights?
We certainly should, and Manager
Barrett's firm stand demanding
that a Stanford man he the official
should be the stand of the entire
Stanford student body.
