# CALIFORNIA'S ELEVEN
## KNIBBS EXPECTS TO WIN BY STRAIGHT FOOTBALL. Fast Backs and Clever Ends, but Mediocre Line and a Poor Punter Characterizes Team. 
### 
"We want to beat Stanford by
straight football. If this wont do
the job we may be forced to try
other ways." This is all that Coach
Knibbs of California will say
concerning the situation as it
stands to-day. If he follows out
this policy in Saturday's con
test, there is a strong possibility
that Stanford will see some of the
famous Dartmouth plays, which
have been so carefully developed
behind closed doors this season.
The California team has come
out of its long seclusion with a
team that is fast and in remark
ably good condition. Clever backs,
strong, experienced ends, and a fair
line, making one of the best teams
that has represented the Blue
and Gold for several years. Sper
ry, Snedigar and Mead are all
speedy men and, on past form, they
should make some sensational
dashes in Saturday's game. Un
fortunately their performances this
season are no indication of their
true form, for in all the preliminary
games they have been played for
five or ten minutes only, and it is
impossible to judge of their endur
ance in a gruelling contest.
It is a noteworthy fact, that while
most of the San Francisco experts
believe that California will win by
one touch-down, Hemphill, who
coached the Sherman Indians, and
Holmes of the University of South
ern California, both pick Stanford
to be victorious in Saturday's
game. Both the men from the
south base their predictions on the
remarkable improvement of the In
dian team between the California
and Stanford games, and the fine
showing made by the Cardinal
team at Los Angeles.
For the first time in five years
the California team will be with
out the services of an exceptional
punter. Overall and his successor
Heitmuller were two of the greatest
kickers who ever played on the
Coast, and while they were in the
game this was one of the strongest
points of the Blue and Gold. This
year Bush has been doing most of
the punting, but his work has been
very mediocre throughout the sea
son.
