# Law Association Smoker To-morrow.
## 
### 
The Stanford Law Association
will hold a smoker at the Univer
sity Inn to-morrow night. All
alumni of the Law department are
invited, and a large attendance is
expected. Probably there will not
be as many San Francisco alumni
present as was anticipated, because
the Stanford Club of that city will
also hold a smoker to-morrow
night.
The smoker will be informal and
serve as a jolly-up for the alumni
who may be on the campus in the
evening. All arrangements have
been completed to accommodate a
large number of guests.
