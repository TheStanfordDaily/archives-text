WHY NOT LIVE IN PALO ALTO ?
When the first intercollegiate football game between Stanford and
Berkeley was played in 1892, Palo Alto was a wheat field. Now
it is a city of 5000 population, with municipal water and light
plants, sewer system, four school buildings, thirty- five miles of
cement sidewalks, macadamized streets, and hundreds of beautiful
homes.
WATCH PALO ALTO GROW DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS
The completion of the Bay Shore Cut-off next summer will bring our town
seven miles nearer to San Francisco than at present, cutting the time down to
35 minutes. This will make Palo Alto a suburb of San Francisco with advan
tages of climate, educational opportunities, and beauty of scenery unexcelled
by any other suburb. DON'T WAIT. Buy a home site in Palo Alto now.
