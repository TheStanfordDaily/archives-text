SOUTH PALO ALTO
The Most Attractive Residence Subdivision
Adjoining Stanford University
This tract, recently opened up, is the most attractive subdivision
that has been placed on the market in this locality. In view of the
University buildings, studded with live oaks, streets graded, and
having an independent water system unequalled by any in the County,
SOUTH PALO ALTO has attracted scores of home builders. Since
June 15th, this year, up to this time, over 300 lots have been sold. This
demonstrates what is thought of SOUTH PALO ALTO.
