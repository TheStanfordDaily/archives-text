know a good thing when they see it; and so do Palo Alto people, or they would not
be living in Palo Alto. All old grads. remember when they could have bought
lots on University avenue for almost any old price. History repeats itself, and at
Sunnyvale you have the same chance to make easy money to-day that you had in
Palo Alto ten years ago. Hence do not delay, but come down to Sunnyvale, on the
old Murphy Ranch, only 9 miles south of the University, and while there look over
the magnificent plant of The Goldy Machine Company, who will employ hundreds
of hands, and the works of the Jubilee Incubator Company, who employ at present
fifty men and will employ many more before the year is out. Sunnyvale is natur
ally a fruit center, draining the whole west side of the valley. It is a town which
has felt the magic touch of manufacturing industries. It has an elevation of 93
feet against 7(> feet for Mountain View and 56 feet for Palo Alto, which, making it
almost free of fog and frostand free in drainage, places it as an ideal residence section.
When you stop off at Sunny vale, look at the improvements and push of busi
ness in the town ; look at the five-acre tracts in the artesian well belt, prolific in
great fields of alfalfa, apples and various vegetables and fruits. Think of and feel
the wonderful climate, and you cannot but be satisfied and be filled with wonder.
