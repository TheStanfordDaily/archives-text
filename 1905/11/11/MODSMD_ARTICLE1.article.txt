# Stanford and California Ready for Great Struggle
## Contest on the New Cardinal Field Will Be One of the Closest in Recent Years. 
### 
FOR the fifteenth annual time since
Stanford University and the
University of California established
athletic relations with each other,
the elevens of the rival colleges are
prepared to struggle for the football
supremacy of the Pacific Coast.
For more than one reason to-day's
game on Stanford Field promises to
overshadow in importance all of its
historic predecessors, which for over
a decade have been the premier
events in the amateur athletic world
west of the Rockies. It is the sec
ond intercollegiate game to be played
on the campus of either university,
and it is the first time that the con
test for gridiron honors will be held
on Stanford territory. And to-day's
game will determine, to a large ex
tent, whether or not campus games
can be considered a success. Anoth

er notable feature of the contest is
the fact that for California it will in
augurate radical changes in the foot
ball system in vogue at the State
University. For the first time in
many years the wearers of the Blue
i and Gold will discard the famous
Princeton system, and substitute in
its stead the more modern Dart
mouth system, which has lately
proven so efficient in the East;
Another California experiment, which
will be watched with interest, is the
result of the replacement of her grad
uate coaches by imported profession
al instructors. Perhaps the factor
which adds the greatest interest in
to-day's contest is the privilege, which
- will be extended to the winner, ol
dedcating Stanford's splendid sta
dium. Last year Stanford had the
pleasure of serpentining on her
rival's fiekl, and naturally enough
the California partisans have an in
j tense desire to see history repeat
J itself.
The outcome of to-day's game
| means a great deal to botn universi
ties. To Stanford, a defeat would be
a crushing blow, for the victors
would serpentine on the new "Stan
ford Field," which has never before
| been the scene of even a preliminary
gridiron battle. California has noth
ing to fear in this respect, but every
thing to gain, as a victory on her
j opponent's grounds would be par
ticularly gratifying to her supporters
in view of the outcome of last year's
match. On the other hand, Cali
fornia's coaches have their reputa
tions at stake and a victory is imper
ative for them, while Stanford's coach
has his reputation so firmly estab
lished that even a severe defeat could
not shake the confidence which the
! student body has in its coach.
Roth teams enter the contest with
i no defeats marked against their
records for the present season. The
J members of the Blue and Gold
! eleven have sustained no serious in
juries in the preliminary games, and
| it is said that the team is in splendid
! physical condition. So much cannot

be said of the Cardinal players, who
have suffered numerous accidents in
practice contests; but the day of the
game finds the Stanford eleven physi
cally fit for a gruelling struggle.
Perhaps no past contest of the kind
has produced so much diversity of
opinion as to its final outcome as the
struggle of the big elevens on Stan
ford Field to-day. It is natura for
the partisans of the respective teams
to pin their faith to the eleven which
wears their colors, but the reluctance
of impartial critics to issue any
definite forecast is unusual. The
coaches and trainers of the contend
ing elevens seem serenely confident
that their favorite will bring credit to
their respective systems of play by
winning a decisive victory; but the
general public, which has been kept
in painful ignorance of their methods,
await the sound of the referee's
whistle with more than usua iu.
patience.
The last practice of the Stanford
Varsity was held on the new field
Thursday afternoon before an enthus
iastic crowd of its loyal supporters,
who had gathered to cheer their
team for the last time before it meets
California. The men went through
signal practice, and the rapidity with
which they executed the plays
augered well for Stanford. Yester
day Head-Coach Lanagan took his
charges for a drive and walk in the
hills, where they could be away from
the excitement and unrest which
always pervades the campus before
an important athletic contest. The
players remained in seclusion until
this morning, when they returned to
their quarters to prepare for the
momentous struggle of the after
noon. The coaches have definitely
selected the men who will battle for
the Cardinal; and as the student body
has implicit faith in the football in
structors, it is certain that the selec
tions will meet with general approba
tion. Some of the fortunate players
won their position by so narrow a
margin that, if they are compelled to
retire from the game, they can be

replaced by substitutes so slightly in
ferior in ability that the team will not
be appreciably weakened.
The game will be called promptly
at 2, but long before that hour the
rival rooting sections will be in their
seats, and a contest of wits and re
partee will precede the more impor
tant gridiron struggle. There has
been a record-breaking sale of seats,
and it is expected that the new
stadium will be filled to its utmost
capacity by the people who are now
anxiously awaiting the whistle which
will inaugurate the big football
struggle.
The officials will be John P. Poe,
Jr., and Nielson Poe, alternating
referee and umpire; Chester Murphy,
'00, head linesman; K.C.Hamilton,
U. C. '07, and John T. Nourse, '00,
linesmen; D. E. Brown, '97, and
Everett Brown, U. C., time-keepers.
