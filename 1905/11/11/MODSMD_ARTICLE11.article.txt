# Presidents Will Not Be Present.
## 
### 
A remarkable feature of to-day's
game is the fact that the contest will
not be witnessed by the president of
either university. In past intercol
legiate struggles Dr. Jordan has been
a familiar figure on the side-lines, and
he has always taken a keen interest
in the welfare of Stanford football
teams. President Wheeler of Cali
fornia has been an enthusiastic follow
er of intercollegiate football since his
arrival on the Coast, and this is the
first big contest he has missed.
Dr. Jordan left for the East last
Tuesday, his destination being New
York City, where he will attend a
meeting of the trustees of the Carne
gie fund. President Wheeler left
Thursday for Washington, D. C.,
where he will attend the meeting of
the American Association of Agricul
tural Colleges and Experiment Sta
tions.
