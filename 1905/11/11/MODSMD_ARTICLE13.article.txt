# General Directions.
## 
### 
To the stranger it is hoped the fol
lowing directions may assist him in
locating the principal points of inter
est.
Following on the appended map,
the main thoroughfare, University
avenue, beginning at the Palo Alto sta
tion, runs due north to the main clus
ter of University buildings. A half
mile up the driveway is an inter
esting road, marked on the map by a
circle. This road leads on the right

to the Mausoleum, where lie the re
mains of the Stanford family, and on
the left to the new athletic field,
where the game will be played to
day. To the left on the next road,
which intersects our course at right
angles as we proceed up the avenue,
is the new Gymnasium but a block
from us, while directly opposite on

the other side of the avenue is the
University Museum. Looking a
little further ahead from this spot to
the left and right respectively we see
the new Library in process of con
struction and the completed Chem
istry building. Passing on around
the oval, ahead of us, we are directly
under Memorial Arch and looking
into Memorial Court, both dedicated
to the memory of Leland Stanford,
Jr. Class-rooms and laboratories are
all around us. Straight ahead is the

famous Memorial Church. To the
left and east from the Arch a quar
ter of a mile lies Encina Hall, the
men's dormitory, and at an equal
distance to the west is Roble Hall,
occupied by the women. Going east
along the Outer Quadrangle and then
turning south on the road which
skirts the University buildings, we

secure access to the upper part of
the campus, where lie the post-office,
fraternity houses and the homes of
many faculty members.
The Way to the Field.
Now lor the actual ways and
means of getting to and from the
game. From Palo Alto station the
distance to the field is about a mile,
and the fare to-day will be twenty
five cents each way. To those who
ride or walk the course will be just

the same, up University ave
nue to the first important in
tersecting roadway, marked
on the map by a circle; thence
to the left on the intersecting
road and straight ahead on
this road to the football field.
Carriages cannot continue on
this road clear to the gates,
but must unload their passen
gers near the point marked
" Faculty Club-House."
Some two hundred yards fur
ther on is the field, which
must be reached from here
on foot.
Route of Busmen.
To busmen the student
body manager wishes an an
nouncement made. To avoid
any confusion they must fol
low the course just indicated
in conveying passengers to
the game. Then after un
loading near the faculty club
house they will not be per
mitted to turn due back on
the course, but must proceed
to their right to the Gymnas
ium, to their right again to
University avenue, and thence
back again to Palo Alto.
After the game vehicles will
be found waiting at the same
place where the passengers
left them.
Instructions for Automobiles.
Automobiles will only be
permitted to enter the cam
pus by the Fmbarcadero
road, which intersects the
County road some half a mile
to the south of the gateway.
Following up this road, auto
mobiles will find accommo
dations for their machines at
its termination at the faculty
baseball diamond near the
club-house. Expert garage
tenders will have a tent erect
ed here, where they will check
all machines and be prepared
to make such repairs as are
necessary.
Where Meals Can Be Secured
Meals can be secured at
the various restaurants in
Palo Alto, which are nearly
all situated on University
avenue, near the station.
Several places will serve
meals to the people on the
campus: one will be the Uni
versity Inn, situated between
Encina Hall and the quad;
accommodations here have
been made for over 400 peo
ple; the charge for luncheon
at the Inn to-day will be fifty
cents. The Y. M. C. A. will
have a five and ten cent
lunch counter near Encina

Hall where 2,000 may be accommo
dated. At Roble Hall seats will be
provided for 140, at fifty cents a meal.
How Trains Will Leave.
