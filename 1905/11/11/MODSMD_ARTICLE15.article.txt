On the morning of the greatest
athletic event of the year Stanford is
well prepared to give a creditable
account of herself. Whatever may
be the outcome of the struggle this
afternoon, Stanford will have no
reason to be ashamed of her team,
her coaches, or her rooters. While
we are not confident of a victory, we
are confident that Stanford will add
to her glory and good name. The
general condition of affairs which
has been attained is the result of long
and hard work, and there are many
to whom praise is due. First of all,
the eleven is deserving of great
credit for the spirit with which they
have played and the way they pulled
themselves out of the inevitable
slump. The men of the second and
third teams are deserving of the
same credit, for they have made the
perfecting of the eleven possible.
The thorough and arduous work of
the coaches is understood and appre
ciated by the entire student body,
and we realize that they have put
their heart and soul into the coach
ing, as no men of a foreign univer
sity are capable of doing. The ser
vices of our trainer have been inval
uable. The rooters who have
pulled themselves out of a slump as
bad as that of the team are
also to be congratulated. In fact
the conditions and spirit on this
critical day are ideal. The team
Stanford is sending forth will fight
from the kick-off to the sound of the
final whistle. We do not underesti
mate our friends, the enemy, but we
have confidence in the men who are
going to fight like tigers for our
University and for our new field.
The rest remains for the student
body to do, and the rooters are
going to do it. There must and
will be such rooting that the team
will have their spirit worked up to
such a pitch that defeat will be im
possible.
