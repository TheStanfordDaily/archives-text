# STANFORD'S NEW FIELD
## HISTORY OF BUILDING THE BIG GRIDIRON. Great Credit Due Members of the Training House Corporation For Their Work. 
### 
THE field upon which the game
between Stanford and Califor
nia will be played this year has just
been completed. It is the first re
sult of the plans of the Training
House Corporation, an organization
formed seven years ago for the bet
terment of athletic conditions at Stan
ford, and is but a small part of the
grounds to be eventually constructed.
The newly-constructed bleachers
have a capacity of accommodating
14,500 spectators with 110 difficulty,
and standing room for 1000 more
has been provided at one end of the
field. The entire cost was approxi
mately $14,000, an amount which
compares very favorably with the re
ported expenditure of $25,000 on
the California field. The bleachers
have been constructed with a special
view to combining durability and
lightness, and this has been accom
plished so successfully that it is
claimed that they are destined to be
come the model for such structures
all over the country.
The bleachers were designed by
Professor C. B. Wing of the Engi
neering department, who donated
his services to the corporation, there
by contributing materially towards
the low cost of the undertaking. In
calculating the strength of the stands,
allowance was made for a much
greater weight than could possibly be
crowded on the bleachers, so that
the structure is much stronger than
is necessary for any pressure that
may be put 011 it.
The new athletic grounds, of which
the football field is a part, are located
in a section of over forty acres allotted
to the Training House Corporation
in 1904 by the Board of Trustees of
the University. This land stretches
oft" in the fields northeast of the new
Gymnasium. The gridiron extends
in direction to the east and west,
with bleachers along the sides and at
the west end, while the east end is
left open.
The training house, located under
the west end of the stand, is admir
ably suited to meet the needs of ath
letic quarters. An assembly room,
with comfortable benches and a fire
place, is separated from the two
rooms for the accommodation of the
rival teams by double walls. Store
rooms and closets containing shower
baths are located on each side of
these larger rooms. The piazza is
outside the bleachers, facing the new
Gymnasium. The building is well
lighted by windows looking out upon
the field, and is supplied with elec
tricity and telephone and telegraph
connections.
Preliminary surveys for the field
were made last spring, and the work
of clearing the space of trees was car
ried on during the summer. The
students returned in the fall to find
active preparations for the erection of
the bleachers being made, and but a
short time elapsed before the first
section was completed. There was a
little delay in the work, but the field
was finished much earlier than was
expected.
The funds which have been used
in building the new field have been
supplied by the Training House Cor
poration. In 1899 this organization
was formed, and the present fund

was based on an appropriation ol
$300 from the class graduating that
year. The fund has been rapidly in
creased since that time through the
agreement with the Associated Stu
dents, by which the Training House
Corporation is allowed 5 per cent of
the gross proceeds of all games, all
the student body assessments, and
any surplus which may be left in the
treasury at the end of the year.
Over $12,000 has been collected at a
total expense of but $30. It is prob
able that in the near future $10,000
will be borrowed at 6 per cent inter
est to enable the immediate comple

tion of the proposed baseball dia
monds and the track.
The following present members of
the corporation are largely respons
ible for the realization of Stanford's
long-felt want for an athletic field: J.
E. McDowell, '00, president; H. H.
Taylor, '00, secretary; Dr. T. M.
Williams, '97, F. L. Berry, '99,- T.
J. Hoover, '01, R. W. Barrett, *04,
and A. L. Trowbridge, '05. Dr.
Frank Angell is treasurer of the cor
poration, and although not a member,
is deserving of much praise for the ac
tive interest he has taken in its af
fairs.

The newly-constructed bleachers
have a capacity of accommodating
14,500 spectators with 110 difficulty,
and standing room for 1000 more
has been provided at one end of the
field. The entire cost was approxi
mately $14,000, an amount which
compares very favorably with the re
ported expenditure of $25,000 on
the California field. The bleachers
have been constructed with a special
view to combining durability and
lightness, and this has been accom
plished so successfully that it is
claimed that they are destined to be
come the model for such structures
all over the country.
The bleachers were designed by
Professor C. B. Wing of the Engi
neering department, who donated
his services to the corporation, there
by contributing materially towards
the low cost of the undertaking. In
calculating the strength of the stands,
allowance was made for a much
greater weight than could possibly be
crowded on the bleachers, so that
the structure is much stronger than
is necessary for any pressure that
may be put 011 it.
The new athletic grounds, of which
the football field is a part, are located
in a section of over forty acres allotted
to the Training House Corporation
in 1904 by the Board of Trustees of
the University. This land stretches
oft" in the fields northeast of the new
Gymnasium. The gridiron extends
in direction to the east and west,
with bleachers along the sides and at
the west end, while the east end is
left open.
The training house, located under
the west end of the stand, is admir
ably suited to meet the needs of ath
letic quarters. An assembly room,
with comfortable benches and a fire
place, is separated from the two
rooms for the accommodation of the
rival teams by double walls. Store
rooms and closets containing shower
baths are located on each side of
these larger rooms. The piazza is
outside the bleachers, facing the new
Gymnasium. The building is well
lighted by windows looking out upon
the field, and is supplied with elec
tricity and telephone and telegraph
connections.
Preliminary surveys for the field
were made last spring, and the work
of clearing the space of trees was car
ried on during the summer. The
students returned in the fall to find
active preparations for the erection of
the bleachers being made, and but a
short time elapsed before the first
section was completed. There was a
little delay in the work, but the field
was finished much earlier than was
expected.
The funds which have been used
in building the new field have been
supplied by the Training House Cor
poration. In 1899 this organization
was formed, and the present fund

was based on an appropriation ol
$300 from the class graduating that
year. The fund has been rapidly in
creased since that time through the
agreement with the Associated Stu
dents, by which the Training House
Corporation is allowed 5 per cent of
the gross proceeds of all games, all
the student body assessments, and
any surplus which may be left in the
treasury at the end of the year.
Over $12,000 has been collected at a
total expense of but $30. It is prob
able that in the near future $10,000
will be borrowed at 6 per cent inter
est to enable the immediate comple

tion of the proposed baseball dia
monds and the track.
The following present members of
the corporation are largely respons
ible for the realization of Stanford's
long-felt want for an athletic field: J.
E. McDowell, '00, president; H. H.
Taylor, '00, secretary; Dr. T. M.
Williams, '97, F. L. Berry, '99,- T.
J. Hoover, '01, R. W. Barrett, *04,
and A. L. Trowbridge, '05. Dr.
Frank Angell is treasurer of the cor
poration, and although not a member,
is deserving of much praise for the ac
tive interest he has taken in its af
fairs.

THE field upon which the game
between Stanford and Califor
nia will be played this year has just
been completed. It is the first re
sult of the plans of the Training
House Corporation, an organization
formed seven years ago for the bet
terment of athletic conditions at Stan
ford, and is but a small part of the
grounds to be eventually constructed.

have a capacity of accommodating
