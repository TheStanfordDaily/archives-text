# SCORES OF THE PAST
## STANFORD HAS LARGEST NUMBER OF GAMES WON. California Has Not Been Scored Against This Season in the Preliminary Contests. 
### 
Though a comparison of the scores
of the preliminary games of the sea
son is generally an unreliable method
of judging the two teams, still some
idea ot their ability may be gained in
this way. California has not been
scored against this season, while Stan
ford has had her opponents tally by
aTplace-kick in two different games.
But Stanford has won every prelimi
nary game, while California, failing
to score in two contests, tied with
her opponents. Stanford has made
126 points in seven games, while Cali
fornia was making 70 in six. Cali
fornia defeated the Indians 21 to o,
while Stanford was victorious by the
small score of 6 to 4, —but it was a
far stronger team that Stanford met.
The rest of the preliminary games
show small differences.

Of the past fourteen intercollegiate
contests Stanford has scored the
greatest number of points and has
won the most games, while California
has the credit of making the largest
score in any one game, when the
team in 1899 made 30 points.
The nearest Stanford has come to
this score was in 1897 when the Car
dinal made twenty-eight points. Since
1895 there has been, but one tie game
out of the nine contests played. Be
fore, the score was even several years.
Four times the teams have tied, and
three of these times it was by a 6 to
6 score. Six times the Cardinal has
won, and four times failed to score,
while the Blue and Gold have ser
pentined four times and failed to
score five.
