# SHOW THIS EVENING
## STANFORD STUDENTS WILL GIVE "THE BEAUTY SHOP." The
						Farce Will Take Place in Assembly Hall, Commencing Promptly at 8:15. 
### 
TO-NIGHT the students of Stan
ford will attend en masse an
undergraduate interpretation of J. C.
Crawford's "Beauty Shop," which
the popular Kolb and Dill have made
famous all over the country by their
humorous acting of the two leading
German parts.
Assembly Hall, on the Outer Quad
rangle facing University avenue, will
be the scene of the show, which will
commence at 8:15.
This production of "The Beauty
Shop" will take the place of the loot
ball show which it was first planned
to hold 011 the new gridiron on the
evening of the game. The commit
tee appointed early in October to
consider the production of a local
farce in the open air decided that
none of the manuscripts submitted
by students were of sufficient excel
lence, and accordingly Student Treas
urer Barrett secured the rights and
privileges of Crawford's masterpiece.
Some might think that presented
in toto as written and by a student
cast "The Beauty Shop" might not
satisfy the tastes of the critical and
excited audience which will witness
it, but this difficulty has been sur
mounted by a complete revision of
the lines and songs so as to make
them entirely Stanford in expression
and sentiment.
The show itself is extremely inter
esting and humorous. The plot
deals with an enterprise known as a
beauty shop, where ugly women are
made beautiful and old made young.
Around this central idea are woven
numerous interesting and complicat
ed situations from which the "Dutch
men," Culmbacher and Pilsner, extri
cate themselves in many queer ways.
The cast is a good one, and the
men in the chorus have trained faith
fully, until they can execute the diffi
cult steps intended for a female
chorus with exceeding skill. R. U.
Fitting, '06, and F. H. Bernard, '07,
handle the German parts cleverly,
and R..S. Kellogg,'o7, in the fe
male role, Madame Voluptia, is ex
ceedingly lifelike and humorous. E.
J. Swift, '08, in the "tough" charac
ter, Professor Brannagain, has a
realistic "Bowery" dialect.
