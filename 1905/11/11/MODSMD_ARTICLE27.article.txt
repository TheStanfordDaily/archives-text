# CALIFORNIA'S PLAYERS
## ELEVEN WHO WILL PLAY FOR BLUE AND GOLD. Football History of Men Who Will Take Part in To-day's Contest. 
### 
Sperry, Full-Back.
W. K. Sperry, '07, will be the
fourth man behind California's line
to-day. Sperry was a Christmas
freshman and played a halt on the
'08 freshman team. Later in the
season he was shifted to full-back and
played that position on the 18 to o
varsity. In build Sperry resembles
"Jim" Weller, but he lacks the fight
ing' qualities of the great Cardinal
full-back. Beside being a good foot
ball player, Sperry is a star man on
the track In last year's intercol
legiate meet he ran up the largest in
dividual score for his university.
Snedigar, Right Half-back.
O. A. Snedigar, '06, is the fastest

man on either
of the teams,
and is one of
California's
all-roundath
letes. He has
had two years
e xperien ce,
playing on
the '03 and
'04 varsities.
For a man
of his speed
Slled i g a r
possesses a
remarkab 1 y
heavy build,
which makes
him almost
an ideal half.
He bucks
well and is a
d anger ous
man in an
open field.
Snedigar has
run the hun
dred in ten
flat and is
credited with
very fast time
in the two
twenty.
Mead. Left
Half-back.
11. R. Mead,
'07, Califor
nia's speedy
left half, made
his big "C"

in hist year's intercollegiate game,
when lie was substituted for Claude
Kern. Mead is a light half, but
makes up for his lack of weight by
the speed and dash of his play. He
is a fast runner and will probably be
called on for most of the Blue and
Gold gains around the end of the
Stanford line. On the defensive
Mead plays a strong, hard game, and
is a sure tackier.
Whitman, Quarter-back.
J. C. Whitman, '07, will direct
California's plays to-day. Whitman
won his position only after ;i hard
tight with Boothe, last season's quar
ter-back. He played as substitute
on his freshman team and in last
year's varsity game. This season he
has shown up remarkably well. His
work in the back-field is consistent
and safe, although lacking in bril
liancy. He runs his team well, put
ting snap and vigor into the plays,
and uses clever head work in direct
ing his attacks. He will do Califor
nia's drop-kicking.

Elliott, Right End.
R. H. Elliott, '06, like his team
mate, Kittrelle, was developed from
a half-back to an end. Elliott was
sub-half on the 'o'> freshman team
and in his sophomore year he tried
for the same position 011 the varsity.
Last season he was moved out to end
and he played in the 18-0 game.
Elliott is a strong, fast end and a
hard fighter, but lacks head work,
especially when playing 011 the de
fensive. He is an extremely fast
man at running down 011 punts.
Kittrelle, Left End.
R. G. Kittrelle, '06, California's J
left end, has had a long and varied
experience 011 the Berkeley gridiron.
Failing to make his freshman team,
Kittrelle tried in his sophomore year
for half on the '03 varsity, but was
unsuccessful. Last season he was
played at quarter-back, but lacked
the necessary speed. Finally, as an
experiment, he was moved out to end,
where he soon demonstrated his
ability to play a hard, fast game.
He played that position on the '04
varsity. Kittrelle is a strong defens
ive player and a fast man at running
down 011 kicks.
Captain Force, Right Tackle.
J. O. Force, '06, who will captain
the Blue and Gold in to-day's strug
gle, won his varsity emblem as a
substitute full-back in the '03 varsity
game. He gained his football ex
perience at Denver, where he played
on the Colorado School of Mines
team. Last year Force played
tackle and was one of the few Berke
ley men who held his position
throughout the entire game. He is
not a brilliant player, but he has won
his position by his pluck and strength.
He will do the place-kicking for Cali
fornia.

Bush, Left Tackle.
F. W. Bush, '06, who will hold
down left tackle for the Blue and
Gold, is a product of second-team
work. Heretofore, although possess
ing strength and weight, Bush has
been handicapped by a lack of speed. |
This year he has been picked by the j
coaches to fill the place of "Heinie" I
Heitmuller, and sufficient aggressive-1
ness has been drilled into him to
make a formidable lineman. He has
never played in an intercollegiate!
contest before. Bush will probably
do most of California's punting to
day.
Stern, Right Guard.
L. E. Stern, '06, the third mem- '
ber of California's strong center trio, '
is the veteran of the team. He
played full-back on the '06 fresh-!
man team, and the following year!
held down the same position 011 the ;
6 to 6 varsity. With the discovery
of Sperry last year, Stern was shifted
to the line, where his weight com
bined with his speed in starting have
made him California's strongest line
man. This season he won his po- j
sition with practically no opposition,
and his work in the preliminary
games has stamped him as a high- j
class guard.
Gray, Left Guard.
P. N. Gray, '06, will play left
guard. Gray held down that posi
tion on the '06 freshman team and !
later on the '04 varsity. He is aj
plucky, aggressive player, and a hard j
man to handle. Gray practically j
won his position this year by his j
great work in the 18-0 game, when, j
with a bruised and poisoned knee, !
he sustained the attacks of the smash- i
ing Cardinal line buckers until he!
could no longer stand up. Gray has i
been on the varsity throughout the |

season, and was one of the few men
whose position was won from the out
set.
Haffey, Center.
C. W. Haffey, '07, will pass the
ball for California. He was center
011 the defeated '07 freshman team,
and took Stroud's place for a few
minutes in last season's varsity con
test. While lacking the strength
and speed of last year's captain, Haf
fey puts up a steady and consistent
game. He passes well for kicks and
plays a good offensive game. On
the defensive he is reliable and breaks
up bucks well. Haffey weighs about
185 pounds, and backed up by two
strong guards, he should play a for
midable game this year.
