# CALIFORNIA'S PLAYERS
## ELEVEN WHO WILL PLAY FOR BLUE AND GOLD. Football History of Men Who Will Take Part in To-day's Contest. 
### 
Sperry, Full-Back.
W. K. Sperry, '07, will be the
fourth man behind California's line
to-day. Sperry was a Christmas
freshman and played a halt on the
'08 freshman team. Later in the
season he was shifted to full-back and
played that position on the 18 to o
varsity. In build Sperry resembles
"Jim" Weller, but he lacks the fight
ing' qualities of the great Cardinal
full-back. Beside being a good foot
ball player, Sperry is a star man on
the track In last year's intercol
legiate meet he ran up the largest in
dividual score for his university.
Snedigar, Right Half-back.
O. A. Snedigar, '06, is the fastest

man on either
of the teams,
and is one of
California's
all-roundath
letes. He has
had two years
e xperien ce,
playing on
the '03 and
'04 varsities.
For a man
of his speed
Slled i g a r
possesses a
remarkab 1 y
heavy build,
which makes
him almost
an ideal half.
He bucks
well and is a
d anger ous
man in an
open field.
Snedigar has
run the hun
dred in ten
flat and is
credited with
very fast time
in the two
twenty.
Mead. Left
Half-back.
11. R. Mead,
'07, Califor
nia's speedy
left half, made
his big "C"

in hist year's intercollegiate game,
when lie was substituted for Claude
Kern. Mead is a light half, but
makes up for his lack of weight by
the speed and dash of his play. He
is a fast runner and will probably be
called on for most of the Blue and
Gold gains around the end of the
Stanford line. On the defensive
Mead plays a strong, hard game, and
is a sure tackier.
Whitman, Quarter-back.
J. C. Whitman, '07, will direct
California's plays to-day. Whitman
won his position only after ;i hard
tight with Boothe, last season's quar
ter-back. He played as substitute
on his freshman team and in last
year's varsity game. This season he
has shown up remarkably well. His
work in the back-field is consistent
and safe, although lacking in bril
liancy. He runs his team well, put
ting snap and vigor into the plays,
and uses clever head work in direct
ing his attacks. He will do Califor
nia's drop-kicking.
