# U.C. UNKNOWN QUALITY
## CALIFORNIA MEN ENTIRELY IN THE DARK. Believe that Surprises Will Be Sprung and Victory Rest with Blue and Gold. 
### J.R. Gabbert 
The students of the University of
California are just as much in the
dark as to the character of the team
that will represent the Blue and Gold
at Stanford to-day as the people who
have followed the season's games in
the newspapers. For many weeks
almost every practice has been be
hind closed gates with none present
outside coaches and trainers. Num
erous outsiders have hazarded wild
guesses as to what has gone on inside
and hundreds of rooters have swarmed
to the single open practice held each
week, expecting to find out what has
been accomplished by the new sys
tem. They have never been able to
see anything more than a little punt
ing, the running through of straight
signals, and practice at the tackling
bag.
In the numerous practice games
the Varsity has been content with
playing straight ball. Not a trick
play has been attempted in any of
these preliminary contests. The
biggest scores made have been ac
complished by smashing through the
teams on straight bucks through the
line. That such a course will be
followed against the heavy Cardinal
seems very improbable, and the Cali
fornia rooters are looking for a style
of play that has been entirely lacking
in the games played so far this year.
California has the fastest set of
backs it has had for several years,
and that such men as Snedigar, Mead,
and Sperry will be turned loose by
the men from Dartmouth merely to
pound against the opposing line is
very improbable. On the other
hand, there is a theory that numerous
fast, open plays will be attempted.
These plays have been developed
very easily against the second eleven
in the secret scrimmages that have
been held during the year and not
attempted in the games played.
We believe, therefore, that Cali
fornia's strength will lie in her speed,
strength behind the line, and in the
new system of play that has been so
carefully rehearsed behind the fence
that incloses California Field. The
team will be in perfect physical con
dition and in shape to fight harder
than it has at any other time during
the year. In this, its hardest fight of
the year, we look for some puzzling
plays, which, with the line-smashing
ability of the backs, we think will en
able California to win by a small
margin.
