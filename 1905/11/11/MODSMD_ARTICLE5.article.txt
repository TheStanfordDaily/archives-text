# ASSISTANT-COACH GRIFFIN.
## Second Coach of California Varsity also a Dartmouth Football Man. 
### 
California revolutionized her sys
tem of" football coaching this year
after two unsuccessful seasons with
graduate coaches. When Knibbs
was secured as head coach, the man
agement secured the services of Dr.
F. B. Griffin, also a Dartmouth man,
as his assistant. Griftin was a promi
nent player as an undergraduate.
The policy adopted by California was
more to harmonize the coaching
board, something which has been so
painfully lacking in her system, than
to eliminate graduate coaches alto
gether.
