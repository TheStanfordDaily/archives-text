# STANFORD'S PROSPECTS
## LOCAL VIEW OF THE CARDINAL'S CHANCES. Undergraduate Thinks Eleven Should Be Victorious in To-day's Gridiron Battle. 
### B.S. Allen 
Stanford expects to dedicate her
splendid new field with a glorious
victory, and it is not difficult to
understand that this expectation is
grounded upon substantial reasons.
Not the least of these is the fact that
the contest will be waged on the
home grounds of the Cardinal, where
every loyal Stanford partisan can be
present to cheer his team.
But there are also some very con
crete reasons why the Cardinal should
wave above the Gold and Blue when
the referee's whistle announces the
end of to-day's struggle for gridiron
honors. The first of these is the
fact that Coach Lanagan of Stanford
has proven his worth by two years of
coaching, which has won unstinted
praise from football critics; while
Coach Knibbs of California is a com
parative novice as a gridiron instruc
tor. The victory of the California
freshmen can hardly be considered a
triumph for Knibbs, as it was the re
sult of the antique quarter-back kick
which proved successful against a
team that was obviously the superior
of the victorious eleven in almost
every department of the game.
California is evidently relying to
a great extent on the magic of the
mysterious Dartmouth system to
tempt the bird of victory to her
standards. And in a measure this
reliance can be justified; but it may
be well to consider that the ignorance
of the general public in regard to this
system is not shared by Coach Lana
gan, whose knowledge of the game is
not limited by any geographical
boundaries. On the other hand, if
Coach Knibbs has been schooling
his charges to meet the celebrated
Harvard offense, he has been playing
into Stanford's hands, lor it would be
much more correct to say that Har
vard is at present using the Stanford
system rather than to assert that the
Cardinal is pursuing the system so
long in vogue at the Eastern institu
tion.
In material the Blue and Gold
undoubtedly possess an advantage
over the Cardinal. Nine veterans of
last year's team appeared on the grid
iron of the state institution at the
opening of the season, while only
three members of the great eleven
which upheld the Cardinal returned
to Stanford this year. But it must
be remembered that the nine Cali
fornia players are veterans of a badly
defeated team.
Stanford does not expect to win
by a large score, as the team will de
pend almost entirely on mass plays
directed against the opposing line,
and this method of advance is effec
tive but slow. Besides the split buck,
which proved such a reliable ground
gainer last year, Lanagan has per
fected several new formations which
California will find difficult of solu
tion.
It is probable that the California
back-field is faster than its rivals, but
the superior aggressiveness of the
Cardinal forwards will overcome this
advantage. In other respects the
teams seem evenly matched, and as it
has become almost an axiom that the
Cardinal players are superior in phys
ical condition, victory in to-day's
game ought to go to Stanford.
