# Stanford Eleven Triumphs Over the California Team
## New Cardinal Field Fittingly Dedicated by Serpentine After Defeat of Much-Heralded Flayers. 
### 
AFTER seventy tense minutes of
nerve racking struggle a stream
of Cardinal poured over the edge of
the new bleachers and Stanford
Field was dedicated by its builders
with a joy mad serpentine. Satur
day's great game had ended in a
12 to 5 victory for the fastest Stan
ford team ever seen on a gridiron.
And to add to the glory which the
Cardinal won is the fact that Stan
ford was opposed by a splendidly
coached and conditioned eleven
which went down to honorable de
feat before a superior team. It was
a double Cardinal victory, since it
"as gained by a Stanford team
coached by Stanford graduates, who
demonstrated clearly that Western
methods can more than hold their
own against the best systems of the
East. The result of the game was
a great triumph for James F. Lana
gan, whose intense personality
seemed infused into the players
who strove so heroically for their
college. The absolutely clean fight
ing determination which animated
every Stanford player was in some
degree a reflection of the Stanford
spirit which seems incarnate in the
head coach. And the college is
equally indebted to Assistant-
Coach Bansbach, who has more
than justifi3d all of the favorable
predictions which were made when
he was appointed to the position.
It cannot be said that there were
any individual stars on the Stan
ford eleven, because every man
played a star game and the re
sulting team-work was responsible
for the Cardinal triumph. Lanagan
says that the team which wore the
cardinal Saturday was the fastest
eleven that has ever represented
Stanford, and few who saw the re
markable contest would question
his judgment. The much-heralded
superiority of the California back
field did not manifest itself at any
stage of the game. Captain Chal
mers at full-back played a magnifi
cent game; time after time he
shattered the California line by his
terrific bucks, and on the defense he
was an ever-present obstacle to the
man with the ball. Near the close
of the game the Cardinal captain
was injured and gave way to
Slusher. At this point occurred
one of those incidents that made
the contest bo clean and sportsman
like. Captain Force, who played
manfully throughout the game, saw
that Chalmers was badly dazed and
insisted that the timer give him
more than the usual allowance, and
then called Lanagan upon the field
to see whether he thought the Stan
ford captain should be taken from
the game. Too much credit cannot be
given Force for bis actions. Slush
er signalized his advent into the
contest by making eight successive
charges through the California line.
Dole at right half did not carry the
ball very often, but he was in every
play with dash and spirit. As was
expected, Vandervoort skirled the
ends for brilliant gains, one of

which resulted in a touch-down. In
running in kicks and bucking the
line this versatile half proved that
he is worthy of the block ''S" which
he won Saturday. Stott's general
ship and head work was a feature
of a game characterized by brilliant
strategy. He directed the Cardinal
plays with precision and speed, and
in the back-field made several sub
stantial gains.
Star work in the back-field was
to be expected, but the great play
ing of the green Cardinal line was
a revelation. Thompson, the lone
veteran among the line-men, sus
tained the faith reposed in him by
crashing through the California
line for Stanford's first touch-down.
Molfino, at center, more than com
pensated for his lack of weight by
his aggressiveness. He was in
every play, and by unerringly fol
lowing the course of the ball here-

covered several fumbles which
might have proven disastrous to
Stanford. Frizzell at right guard
put up a splendid defense against
his heavy opponent. California
massed some of her heaviest bucks
against Horton, but the big Cardi
nal tackle bore the brunt of these
attacks without flinching, and
when Stanford held the ball he
opened up great holes in the oppos
ing line. Crawford played a strong
defensive game, but it was when ha
had the ball tucked securely be
neath his arm that lie did his finest
work. By one smashing plunge he
carried the sphere for a gain of
20 yards, and his other bucks sel
dom failed to gain. Lyons, Koer
ner and Stanford showed by their
playing that the ends of the Cardi
nal eleven were in the same high
class with the other members of
the team.

California has probably never
been represented by a team equal
in condition to the eleven which
upheld the Blue and Gold on Stan
ford Field Saturday, but before the
game was very old the Stanford
players showed that they possessed
greater physical stamina than their
nvals. Snedigar was the greatest
ground gainer for California, and
his bursts of speed when he made
his two thrilling runs were marvel
ous. The fake kick mußt have
been devised for him, as it depend
ed for success upon tremendous
strength and speed. Otherwise
the system did not develop any
thing startling. The California
team showed signs of excellent
coaching, but it did not exhibit any
phenomenal speed or team work.
The management must be con
gratulated for the efficient manner
in which the 13,000 people who saw
the game were seated in the stadi
um. The great crowd was bandied
quickly and without confusion. In
this connection it may be well to
note the miserable and inefficient
service which the Southern Pacific
gave the visitors. The first special
from San Francisco arrived after
two hours and fifteen minutes had
been spent on the road. Other
specials arrived proportionately
late.
Many visitors chose to remain
rather than make the tiresome trip
to their respective homes, and the
way in which the large crowd was
entertained until yesterday was
nothing short of remarkable.

Final score: Stanford 12, Califor

AFTER seventy tense minutes of
nerve racking struggle a stream
of Cardinal poured over the edge of
the new bleachers and Stanford
Field was dedicated by its builders
with a joy mad serpentine. Satur
day's great game had ended in a
12 to 5 victory for the fastest Stan
ford team ever seen on a gridiron.
And to add to the glory which the
Cardinal won is the fact that Stan
ford was opposed by a splendidly
coached and conditioned eleven
which went down to honorable de
feat before a superior team. It was
a double Cardinal victory, since it
"as gained by a Stanford team
coached by Stanford graduates, who
demonstrated clearly that Western
methods can more than hold their
own against the best systems of the
East. The result of the game was
a great triumph for James F. Lana
gan, whose intense personality
seemed infused into the players
who strove so heroically for their
college. The absolutely clean fight
ing determination which animated
every Stanford player was in some
degree a reflection of the Stanford
spirit which seems incarnate in the
head coach. And the college is
equally indebted to Assistant-
Coach Bansbach, who has more
than justifi3d all of the favorable
predictions which were made when
he was appointed to the position.
It cannot be said that there were
any individual stars on the Stan
ford eleven, because every man
played a star game and the re
sulting team-work was responsible
for the Cardinal triumph. Lanagan
says that the team which wore the
cardinal Saturday was the fastest
eleven that has ever represented
Stanford, and few who saw the re
markable contest would question
his judgment. The much-heralded
superiority of the California back
field did not manifest itself at any
stage of the game. Captain Chal
mers at full-back played a magnifi
cent game; time after time he
shattered the California line by his
terrific bucks, and on the defense he
was an ever-present obstacle to the
man with the ball. Near the close
of the game the Cardinal captain
was injured and gave way to
Slusher. At this point occurred
one of those incidents that made
the contest bo clean and sportsman
like. Captain Force, who played
manfully throughout the game, saw
that Chalmers was badly dazed and
insisted that the timer give him
more than the usual allowance, and
then called Lanagan upon the field
to see whether he thought the Stan
ford captain should be taken from
the game. Too much credit cannot be
given Force for bis actions. Slush
er signalized his advent into the
contest by making eight successive
charges through the California line.
Dole at right half did not carry the
ball very often, but he was in every
play with dash and spirit. As was
expected, Vandervoort skirled the
ends for brilliant gains, one of

which resulted in a touch-down. In
running in kicks and bucking the
line this versatile half proved that
he is worthy of the block ''S" which
he won Saturday. Stott's general
ship and head work was a feature
of a game characterized by brilliant
strategy. He directed the Cardinal
plays with precision and speed, and
in the back-field made several sub
stantial gains.
Star work in the back-field was
to be expected, but the great play
ing of the green Cardinal line was
a revelation. Thompson, the lone
veteran among the line-men, sus
tained the faith reposed in him by
crashing through the California
line for Stanford's first touch-down.
Molfino, at center, more than com
pensated for his lack of weight by
his aggressiveness. He was in
every play, and by unerringly fol
lowing the course of the ball here-

covered several fumbles which
might have proven disastrous to
Stanford. Frizzell at right guard
put up a splendid defense against
his heavy opponent. California
massed some of her heaviest bucks
against Horton, but the big Cardi
nal tackle bore the brunt of these
attacks without flinching, and
when Stanford held the ball he
opened up great holes in the oppos
ing line. Crawford played a strong
defensive game, but it was when ha
had the ball tucked securely be
neath his arm that lie did his finest
work. By one smashing plunge he
carried the sphere for a gain of
20 yards, and his other bucks sel
dom failed to gain. Lyons, Koer
ner and Stanford showed by their
playing that the ends of the Cardi
nal eleven were in the same high
class with the other members of
the team.

California has probably never
been represented by a team equal
in condition to the eleven which
upheld the Blue and Gold on Stan
ford Field Saturday, but before the
game was very old the Stanford
players showed that they possessed
greater physical stamina than their
nvals. Snedigar was the greatest
ground gainer for California, and
his bursts of speed when he made
his two thrilling runs were marvel
ous. The fake kick mußt have
been devised for him, as it depend
ed for success upon tremendous
strength and speed. Otherwise
the system did not develop any
thing startling. The California
team showed signs of excellent
coaching, but it did not exhibit any
phenomenal speed or team work.
The management must be con
gratulated for the efficient manner
in which the 13,000 people who saw
the game were seated in the stadi
um. The great crowd was bandied
quickly and without confusion. In
this connection it may be well to
note the miserable and inefficient
service which the Southern Pacific
gave the visitors. The first special
from San Francisco arrived after
two hours and fifteen minutes had
been spent on the road. Other
specials arrived proportionately
late.
Many visitors chose to remain
rather than make the tiresome trip
to their respective homes, and the
way in which the large crowd was
entertained until yesterday was
nothing short of remarkable.

AFTER seventy tense minutes of
nerve racking struggle a stream
of Cardinal poured over the edge of
the new bleachers and Stanford
Field was dedicated by its builders
with a joy mad serpentine. Satur
day's great game had ended in a
12 to 5 victory for the fastest Stan
ford team ever seen on a gridiron.
And to add to the glory which the
Cardinal won is the fact that Stan
ford was opposed by a splendidly
coached and conditioned eleven
which went down to honorable de
feat before a superior team. It was
a double Cardinal victory, since it
"as gained by a Stanford team
coached by Stanford graduates, who
demonstrated clearly that Western
methods can more than hold their
own against the best systems of the
East. The result of the game was
a great triumph for James F. Lana
gan, whose intense personality
seemed infused into the players
who strove so heroically for their
college. The absolutely clean fight
ing determination which animated
every Stanford player was in some
degree a reflection of the Stanford
spirit which seems incarnate in the
head coach. And the college is
equally indebted to Assistant-
Coach Bansbach, who has more
than justifi3d all of the favorable
predictions which were made when
he was appointed to the position.
It cannot be said that there were
any individual stars on the Stan
ford eleven, because every man
played a star game and the re
sulting team-work was responsible
for the Cardinal triumph. Lanagan
says that the team which wore the
cardinal Saturday was the fastest
eleven that has ever represented
Stanford, and few who saw the re
markable contest would question
his judgment. The much-heralded
superiority of the California back
field did not manifest itself at any
stage of the game. Captain Chal
mers at full-back played a magnifi
cent game; time after time he
shattered the California line by his
terrific bucks, and on the defense he
was an ever-present obstacle to the
man with the ball. Near the close
of the game the Cardinal captain
was injured and gave way to
Slusher. At this point occurred
one of those incidents that made
the contest bo clean and sportsman
like. Captain Force, who played
manfully throughout the game, saw
that Chalmers was badly dazed and
insisted that the timer give him
more than the usual allowance, and
then called Lanagan upon the field
to see whether he thought the Stan
ford captain should be taken from
the game. Too much credit cannot be
given Force for bis actions. Slush
er signalized his advent into the
contest by making eight successive
charges through the California line.
Dole at right half did not carry the
ball very often, but he was in every
play with dash and spirit. As was
expected, Vandervoort skirled the
ends for brilliant gains, one of

which resulted in a touch-down. In
running in kicks and bucking the
line this versatile half proved that
he is worthy of the block ''S" which
he won Saturday. Stott's general
ship and head work was a feature
of a game characterized by brilliant
strategy. He directed the Cardinal
plays with precision and speed, and
in the back-field made several sub
stantial gains.
Star work in the back-field was
to be expected, but the great play
ing of the green Cardinal line was
a revelation. Thompson, the lone
veteran among the line-men, sus
tained the faith reposed in him by
crashing through the California
line for Stanford's first touch-down.
Molfino, at center, more than com
pensated for his lack of weight by
his aggressiveness. He was in
every play, and by unerringly fol
lowing the course of the ball here-

covered several fumbles which
might have proven disastrous to
Stanford. Frizzell at right guard
put up a splendid defense against
his heavy opponent. California
massed some of her heaviest bucks
against Horton, but the big Cardi
nal tackle bore the brunt of these
attacks without flinching, and
when Stanford held the ball he
opened up great holes in the oppos
ing line. Crawford played a strong
defensive game, but it was when ha
had the ball tucked securely be
neath his arm that lie did his finest
work. By one smashing plunge he
carried the sphere for a gain of
20 yards, and his other bucks sel
dom failed to gain. Lyons, Koer
ner and Stanford showed by their
playing that the ends of the Cardi
nal eleven were in the same high
class with the other members of
the team.

California has probably never
been represented by a team equal
in condition to the eleven which
upheld the Blue and Gold on Stan
ford Field Saturday, but before the
game was very old the Stanford
players showed that they possessed
greater physical stamina than their
nvals. Snedigar was the greatest
ground gainer for California, and
his bursts of speed when he made
his two thrilling runs were marvel
ous. The fake kick mußt have
been devised for him, as it depend
ed for success upon tremendous
strength and speed. Otherwise
the system did not develop any
thing startling. The California
team showed signs of excellent
coaching, but it did not exhibit any
phenomenal speed or team work.
The management must be con
gratulated for the efficient manner
in which the 13,000 people who saw
the game were seated in the stadi
um. The great crowd was bandied
quickly and without confusion. In
this connection it may be well to
note the miserable and inefficient
service which the Southern Pacific
gave the visitors. The first special
from San Francisco arrived after
two hours and fifteen minutes had
been spent on the road. Other
specials arrived proportionately
late.
Many visitors chose to remain
rather than make the tiresome trip
to their respective homes, and the
way in which the large crowd was
entertained until yesterday was
nothing short of remarkable.

which resulted in a touch-down. In
running in kicks and bucking the
line this versatile half proved that
he is worthy of the block ''S" which
he won Saturday. Stott's general
ship and head work was a feature
of a game characterized by brilliant
strategy. He directed the Cardinal
plays with precision and speed, and
in the back-field made several sub
stantial gains.
Star work in the back-field was
to be expected, but the great play
ing of the green Cardinal line was
a revelation. Thompson, the lone
veteran among the line-men, sus
tained the faith reposed in him by
crashing through the California
line for Stanford's first touch-down.
Molfino, at center, more than com
pensated for his lack of weight by
his aggressiveness. He was in
every play, and by unerringly fol
lowing the course of the ball here-

covered several fumbles which
might have proven disastrous to
Stanford. Frizzell at right guard
put up a splendid defense against
his heavy opponent. California
massed some of her heaviest bucks
against Horton, but the big Cardi
nal tackle bore the brunt of these
attacks without flinching, and
when Stanford held the ball he
opened up great holes in the oppos
ing line. Crawford played a strong
defensive game, but it was when ha
had the ball tucked securely be
neath his arm that lie did his finest
work. By one smashing plunge he
carried the sphere for a gain of
20 yards, and his other bucks sel
dom failed to gain. Lyons, Koer
ner and Stanford showed by their
playing that the ends of the Cardi
nal eleven were in the same high
class with the other members of
the team.

California has probably never
been represented by a team equal
in condition to the eleven which
upheld the Blue and Gold on Stan
ford Field Saturday, but before the
game was very old the Stanford
players showed that they possessed
greater physical stamina than their
nvals. Snedigar was the greatest
ground gainer for California, and
his bursts of speed when he made
his two thrilling runs were marvel
ous. The fake kick mußt have
been devised for him, as it depend
ed for success upon tremendous
strength and speed. Otherwise
the system did not develop any
thing startling. The California
team showed signs of excellent
coaching, but it did not exhibit any
phenomenal speed or team work.
The management must be con
gratulated for the efficient manner
in which the 13,000 people who saw
the game were seated in the stadi
um. The great crowd was bandied
quickly and without confusion. In
this connection it may be well to
note the miserable and inefficient
service which the Southern Pacific
gave the visitors. The first special
from San Francisco arrived after
two hours and fifteen minutes had
been spent on the road. Other
specials arrived proportionately
late.
Many visitors chose to remain
rather than make the tiresome trip
to their respective homes, and the
way in which the large crowd was
entertained until yesterday was
nothing short of remarkable.

Final score: Stanford 12, Califor

AFTER seventy tense minutes of
nerve racking struggle a stream
of Cardinal poured over the edge of
the new bleachers and Stanford
Field was dedicated by its builders
with a joy mad serpentine. Satur
day's great game had ended in a
12 to 5 victory for the fastest Stan
ford team ever seen on a gridiron.
And to add to the glory which the
Cardinal won is the fact that Stan
ford was opposed by a splendidly
coached and conditioned eleven
which went down to honorable de
feat before a superior team. It was
a double Cardinal victory, since it
"as gained by a Stanford team
coached by Stanford graduates, who
demonstrated clearly that Western
methods can more than hold their
own against the best systems of the
East. The result of the game was
a great triumph for James F. Lana
gan, whose intense personality
seemed infused into the players
who strove so heroically for their
college. The absolutely clean fight
ing determination which animated
every Stanford player was in some
degree a reflection of the Stanford
spirit which seems incarnate in the
head coach. And the college is
equally indebted to Assistant-
Coach Bansbach, who has more
than justifi3d all of the favorable
predictions which were made when
he was appointed to the position.
It cannot be said that there were
any individual stars on the Stan
ford eleven, because every man
played a star game and the re
sulting team-work was responsible
for the Cardinal triumph. Lanagan
says that the team which wore the
cardinal Saturday was the fastest
eleven that has ever represented
Stanford, and few who saw the re
markable contest would question
his judgment. The much-heralded
superiority of the California back
field did not manifest itself at any
stage of the game. Captain Chal
mers at full-back played a magnifi
cent game; time after time he
shattered the California line by his
terrific bucks, and on the defense he
was an ever-present obstacle to the
man with the ball. Near the close
of the game the Cardinal captain
was injured and gave way to
Slusher. At this point occurred
one of those incidents that made
the contest bo clean and sportsman
like. Captain Force, who played
manfully throughout the game, saw
that Chalmers was badly dazed and
insisted that the timer give him
more than the usual allowance, and
then called Lanagan upon the field
to see whether he thought the Stan
ford captain should be taken from
the game. Too much credit cannot be
given Force for bis actions. Slush
er signalized his advent into the
contest by making eight successive
charges through the California line.
Dole at right half did not carry the
ball very often, but he was in every
play with dash and spirit. As was
expected, Vandervoort skirled the
ends for brilliant gains, one of

Final score: Stanford 12, Califor
nia 5.
AFTER seventy tense minutes of
nerve racking struggle a stream
of Cardinal poured over the edge of
the new bleachers and Stanford
Field was dedicated by its builders
with a joy mad serpentine. Satur
day's great game had ended in a
12 to 5 victory for the fastest Stan
ford team ever seen on a gridiron.
And to add to the glory which the
Cardinal won is the fact that Stan
ford was opposed by a splendidly
coached and conditioned eleven
which went down to honorable de
feat before a superior team. It was
a double Cardinal victory, since it
"as gained by a Stanford team
coached by Stanford graduates, who
demonstrated clearly that Western
methods can more than hold their
own against the best systems of the
East. The result of the game was
a great triumph for James F. Lana
gan, whose intense personality
seemed infused into the players
who strove so heroically for their
college. The absolutely clean fight
ing determination which animated
every Stanford player was in some
degree a reflection of the Stanford
spirit which seems incarnate in the
head coach. And the college is
equally indebted to Assistant-
Coach Bansbach, who has more
than justifi3d all of the favorable
predictions which were made when
he was appointed to the position.
It cannot be said that there were
any individual stars on the Stan
ford eleven, because every man
played a star game and the re
sulting team-work was responsible
for the Cardinal triumph. Lanagan
says that the team which wore the
cardinal Saturday was the fastest
eleven that has ever represented
Stanford, and few who saw the re
markable contest would question
his judgment. The much-heralded
superiority of the California back
field did not manifest itself at any
stage of the game. Captain Chal
mers at full-back played a magnifi
cent game; time after time he
shattered the California line by his
terrific bucks, and on the defense he
was an ever-present obstacle to the
man with the ball. Near the close
of the game the Cardinal captain
was injured and gave way to
Slusher. At this point occurred
one of those incidents that made
the contest bo clean and sportsman
like. Captain Force, who played
manfully throughout the game, saw
that Chalmers was badly dazed and
insisted that the timer give him
more than the usual allowance, and
then called Lanagan upon the field
to see whether he thought the Stan
ford captain should be taken from
the game. Too much credit cannot be
given Force for bis actions. Slush
er signalized his advent into the
contest by making eight successive
charges through the California line.
Dole at right half did not carry the
ball very often, but he was in every
play with dash and spirit. As was
expected, Vandervoort skirled the
ends for brilliant gains, one of

which resulted in a touch-down. In
running in kicks and bucking the
line this versatile half proved that
he is worthy of the block ''S" which
he won Saturday. Stott's general
ship and head work was a feature
of a game characterized by brilliant
strategy. He directed the Cardinal
plays with precision and speed, and
in the back-field made several sub
stantial gains.
Star work in the back-field was
to be expected, but the great play
ing of the green Cardinal line was
a revelation. Thompson, the lone
veteran among the line-men, sus
tained the faith reposed in him by
crashing through the California
line for Stanford's first touch-down.
Molfino, at center, more than com
pensated for his lack of weight by
his aggressiveness. He was in
every play, and by unerringly fol
lowing the course of the ball here-

covered several fumbles which
might have proven disastrous to
Stanford. Frizzell at right guard
put up a splendid defense against
his heavy opponent. California
massed some of her heaviest bucks
against Horton, but the big Cardi
nal tackle bore the brunt of these
attacks without flinching, and
when Stanford held the ball he
opened up great holes in the oppos
ing line. Crawford played a strong
defensive game, but it was when ha
had the ball tucked securely be
neath his arm that lie did his finest
work. By one smashing plunge he
carried the sphere for a gain of
20 yards, and his other bucks sel
dom failed to gain. Lyons, Koer
ner and Stanford showed by their
playing that the ends of the Cardi
nal eleven were in the same high
class with the other members of
the team.

California has probably never
been represented by a team equal
in condition to the eleven which
upheld the Blue and Gold on Stan
ford Field Saturday, but before the
game was very old the Stanford
players showed that they possessed
greater physical stamina than their
nvals. Snedigar was the greatest
ground gainer for California, and
his bursts of speed when he made
his two thrilling runs were marvel
ous. The fake kick mußt have
been devised for him, as it depend
ed for success upon tremendous
strength and speed. Otherwise
the system did not develop any
thing startling. The California
team showed signs of excellent
coaching, but it did not exhibit any
phenomenal speed or team work.
The management must be con
gratulated for the efficient manner
in which the 13,000 people who saw
the game were seated in the stadi
um. The great crowd was bandied
quickly and without confusion. In
this connection it may be well to
note the miserable and inefficient
service which the Southern Pacific
gave the visitors. The first special
from San Francisco arrived after
two hours and fifteen minutes had
been spent on the road. Other
specials arrived proportionately
late.
Many visitors chose to remain
rather than make the tiresome trip
to their respective homes, and the
way in which the large crowd was
entertained until yesterday was
nothing short of remarkable.
