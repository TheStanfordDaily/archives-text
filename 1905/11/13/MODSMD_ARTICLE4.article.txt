# Rooting Spirited.

One of the features at Saturday's
contest was the splendid and effect
ive support which the rival rooting
sections gave the respective teams.
The California rooters were the first
to arrive. Ten minutes afterward
the entire Stanford rooting section
appeared, headed by the Stanford
band. Blue and Gold bunting was
draped so as tocover the entire front
of the California section. A huge
red banner ''Stanford" in white
was placed directly in front of the
Stanford section. Three Hag-poles
at the top of the section bore huge
Stanford banners. During the
progress of the game a number of
white pigeons with red ribbons tied
to their feet were allowed to fly
away.
When Thompson scored the first
touch-down several hundred red
balloons were loosened and soared
upwards over the Stanford section.
Stanford again made use of the
white block "S" in her red rooting
section, but the manner in which
the trick was done made the repe
tition of the stunt effective. As
the rooters filed in the gates each
man was given a bag of red con
fetti, which each rooter placed in
his megaphone upon finding his

Beat. At a signal from the yell
leaders the megaphones were waved,
thus distributing theconfetli every
where When the rooters sat down
the white block "B'' appeard
through the clouds of confetti, at
first rather indistinct, but finally
clear-cut and perfect.
During the first selection by the
hand, the rooters kept time by wav
ing their megaphones from one side
to the other. This was one of the
prettiest bits of "stunt" work dur
ing the day, and compared favor
ably with California's yellow
handkerchief exercise worked in
the same manner later in the day.
California, as usual, was without
any special features. The flag-pole
on the left side of the training
house bore the California colors,
while the Cardinal waved from the
top of Stanford's side of the train
ing quarters.
