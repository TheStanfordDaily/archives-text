# COLUMBIA PARK BOYS
## YOUTHS WILL GIVE ENTERTAINMENT IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Versatile Pupils of Peixotto Will Be Seen on the Campus Next Week. 
### 
The Columbia Park Hoys'Club
of Sail Francisco will give one of
their characteristic entertainments
in Assembly Hall on the evening of
November '24th. The program for
the evening has not yet been sub
mitted by the managers of the club,
but it will probably be a varied one
and consist of exhibitions of the
work done by the members along
all lines.
The Columbia Park Boys' Club
is located among the homes of the
working people of San Francisco,
and draws its members from this
class. Sidney S. Peixotto, the
present leader of the club, founded
the organization over ten years ago
for the purpose of aiding the in
tellectual and moral training of the
rising generation, and to develop
their mental and physical facul
ties. The results have more than
justified the effort expended. The
first aim to raise the moral stand
ard of the boys has been achieved
without a doubt. Further than
that, all that is best physically and
mentally in the youths has been
tyroUght out. The club has pur
sued Work along athletic and musi
cal lines, and has achieved won
derful success through its efforts in
this direction. Excellent teams
are turned out yearly in all the
outdoor sports, and there are
choruses and soloists which dis
play musical talent hardly con
ceivable in persons of such tender
years. In art work, too, these
juvenile prodigals excel, and their
productions in painting and sculp
ture have attracted attention in the
most exclusive art galleries in San
Fr&ncsico. v
-i The program prepared for this
season covers all the lines of the
club's work, with athletic "stunts"
and concert singing predominating.
