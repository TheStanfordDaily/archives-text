Copies of the special football edi
tion of the Daily Palo Alto are on
â– ale at the bookstores and at this
office, at ten cents.
As booh as definite plans are
formulated for the rally on the
baseball diamond which will cele
brate our victory, the mem hers of
the Freshman class should begin
collecting wood for a monster fire.
The gathering of wood for these
rallies has always been the duty of
every Freshman class. At the
rally before the big game the ma
jority of the class did not gather
wood. These people now have a
chance to redeem thempelves. Let
every Freshman from Encina, the
Row, and Palo Alto gather wood
and make this rally one to be re
membered.
