There are a number of customs
in force in the University com
munity which are beneficial. There
seems to he room for the addition
of several more, and one of these is
that everyone should refrain from
smoking in such public places aR
the University Post-office and
Bookstore, where the men of the

the women. Smoking in these
places is annoying and disrespect
ful at least, and it can be done
away with without much trouble
or self-denial.
