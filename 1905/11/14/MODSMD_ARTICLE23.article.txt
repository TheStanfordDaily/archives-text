# SHOW AFTER THE GAME
## "THE BEAUTY SHOP " ADAPTED TO LOCAL SETTING. Hooters Adjourn to Assembly Hall, Where Team and Coaches Were Guests of Honor. 
### 
In the evening Assembly Hall
furnished the occasion fur the ex
ploaion of the pent-up feeling which
had been aroused in the afternoon
by the successful issue of the foot
ball game. The hall was Hiled
with spectators, and the show was
a successful financial venture.
Somewhat to the surprise of many
the assembled robters were not as
loud in their demonstration as ex
pected, hut til in was doubtless due
to the trying ordeal on the bleach
ers and Held in the afternoon.
Just before the rise of the curtain
the football squad, headed by
Coaches Lanagan and Bansbach,
tiled into the seats reserved for
them in the front of the house.
The band occupied a conspicuous
position in the gallery and helped
enliven the evening.
The show itself was as good as
could be expected under the cir
cumstances. All the characters
were in poor voice as a result of
their strenuous work on the bleach
ers, and consequently it was often
difficult to hear the lines. Hoarse
voices, too, spoiled several solos
and duets which otherwise would
have been entertaining and enjoy
able. The work of all the cast, how
ever, gave evidence of hard drilling,
and the chorus especially distin
guished itself by the execution of
many fancy dances and movements.
As expected the lines were full
of local hits, hut the audience was
either too tired or disinterested to
appreciate them. The actors
worked hard and are deserving of
much praise for the sacrifice of
time and recreation which they
made to make the production of
the football show possible.
"Dad" Moulton and his dogs
were the main features of the eve
ning. Before the rise of the curtain
for the first act, the veteran trainer
came before the curtain with his
clever pets and put them through
numerous entertaining tricks.
"Dad" himself was given a rous
ing ovation bv the assembled stu
dents, who still had clearly in
mind the splendid physical con
dition which the Cardinal eleven
had displayed during the whole of
the strenuous game in the after
noon.
