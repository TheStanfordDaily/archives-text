# ELECTS NEW MEMBERS
## ENGLISH CLUB ADDS FOUR NAMES TO ITS ROLLS. Interesting Address on Magazine Work by Assistant Editor of Big Eastern Periodical. 
### 
The English Club held its fifth
meeting yesterday evening at the
Kappa Alpha Theta house. The
most important business transact
ed was the announcement by the
executive committee that four new
members had been elected to the
club. They are President Jordan,
Professor M. B. Anderson, Miss N.
K. Dunn, '06, and H. P. Bittner,
'07.
President Jordan - has always
been a guest at the meetings of the
club, and his election last night as
an honorary member was a mere
matter of form. Professor Ander
son has also prominently con
nected with the affair√ü of the club,
although he was formally admitted
as a faculty member only last
night. He has been the head of
the University's English depart
ment for some years past. Miss
Dunn is an English major and has
been a frequent contributor to the
Sequoia during her college course.
Bittner is an associate editor of the
Daily Palo Alto.
After the transaction of some
other business of minor importance,
the club listened to a very interest
ing talk from William Morrow of
New York, assistant editor of the
American Illustrated Magazine,
which was formerly known as Les
lie's Monthly. Morrow spoke on
the general subject of magazines
and magazine-making to-day, and
described the way in which the
great modern magazines gather
their material and collect it in a
form best suited to the tastes of the
public. He told of the trials which
are undergone by the editors and
readers in their search for live, in
teresting short stories, which often
seem impossible to secure, and of
the writing of the special articles
on topics of timely interest which
make up such a large part of our
modern magazines.
