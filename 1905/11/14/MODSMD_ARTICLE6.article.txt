# Meeting of Freshman Debaters.
## 
### 
The Freshman Debating Society,
formed early in the semester, will
meet in room 31 at 7:30 to morrow
evening to consider the advisability
of disbanding. It has always been
the custom in the past to disband
the Freshman society as soon as
the class try-out has been held each
year, and the Freshmen will prob
ably follow the same policy this
year.
