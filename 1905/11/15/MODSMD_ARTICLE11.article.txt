# Dr. Griffin's Return Uncertain.
## 
### 
The date of Dr. J. 0. Griffin's re
turn to the University is uncertain.
Three weeks ago the loss of the
sight of one of his eye√ü compelled
him to give up his teaching tem
porarily, while he remained under
the care of an oculist at the Lane
Hospital, San Francisco. At that
time it was supposed that one
month's time would be sufficient
for regaining the recovery of his
sight, hut although his condition is
gradually improving, it is probable
that he will not be able to resume
his work in the German depart
ment before January. It can be
definitely stated that Dr. Griffin
will fully regain the use of his eye,
though at first his sight was de
spaired of.
