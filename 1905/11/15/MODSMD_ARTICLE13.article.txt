Conservative estimates piace the
attendance at the game Saturday
close to 12,000. The total receipts
will probably net over $24,000, a
sum considerably less than the re
ceipts of the game at California
last year. Manager Decoto of
California will not he able to make
a statement of his part of the finan
cial transactions until Satur
day, so that a definite record of the
finances of the game cannot he se
cured until next week. Deducting
a mutual expense item of about
$500 for the two universities, each
college will receive something over
$11,000 from the game.
