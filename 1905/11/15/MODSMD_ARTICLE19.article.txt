Now that all our visitors have
left the campus, we need no longer
hesitate in speaking plainly of
some of the occurrences just previ
ous to the day of the big football
game. These happenings can be
properly designated only as din
graceful, absolutely at variance
with the spirit and ideals of the
pa»t, and never likely to be toler
ated again if we are to retain our
boasted freedom from muckerism.
The facts, in plain words, seem to
be these: the members of the Class
of 1908 undertook to protect the
bleachers and the campus gener
ally from any decoration at the
hands of California enthusiasts
during the night of Thursday last.
Instead of devoting themselves to
this duty, many of the men threw
aside all restraint and went to
great excesses. We are informed
that as a consequence the floor of
the training house,which was await
ing a hardwood finish, was ren
dered unfit for that work.
This was a disgraceful enough
dedication of the new field; but
this phase of the matter was by no
means the most serious. What
must be regarded as most un
worthy of Stanford was the fact
that these men created such a
noise and disturbance about the
campus and the hall that the sleep
of the football men was seriously

interfered with, for which we have
the personal assurance of two mem
bers of the Varsity. Had the
Freshmen conducted themselves in
similar fashion the following night,
it is safe to say that our team
would have been in no condition
to play California, and we would
have lost the game. And this a
few hours after Lanagan had ap
pealed to the men of the Univer
sity, at a meeting called especially
for that purpose, to preserve the
most absolute quiet!
We leave it to the men of the
University to say whether the
coach and the team were fairly
dealt with. We leave it to the men
of the Class of 1908 to decide what
should be done to those of their
members who have put a blot upon
the fair record of their class. We
leave it to the Junior and Senior
classes to say what ought to be the
punishment of the upper-classmen
who were involved. But we submit
that if the matter is passed over in
silence, we will have made a serious
break from the excellent spirit of
loyalty to our teams which has
been built up during the past few
years, an unrebuked precedent that
will threaten our athletic successes
in future years. The matter is one
that deserves the serious attention
of the undergraduate body, and we
think it may safely be left in their
hands.
