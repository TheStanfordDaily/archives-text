Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is with some considerable re
luctance that I ask the courtesy of
your columns for setting forth
events of recent occurrence which
reflect no great credit on our col
lege spirit; and it is in the sincere
belief that a frank statement of
these events is more healthful for
us than concealment, that I ven
ture to bring them before the col
lege public.
Last Friday when I went down
to the bleachers, I was informed by
the workmen that some students
had taken possession of the train
ing-house, and had so stained and
dirtied the floor of the assembly
room that it was impossible to get
it in order and wax it before the
game Saturday. It seems, as far
hs I can learn, that a party of
second-year men, detailed to watch
the bleachers, had, in a more or
less drunken condition, entered the
room and abused it beyond the
possibility of restoration for the
next day.
The feeling that comes from the
consciousness of faithful and efii
cient service is about the only re
ward that the managers of the
Training House Corporation look
forward to, but they certainly did
not anticipate that the structure
which past generations of students
planned and worked for should be
dedicated by students entering into
possession of it with a drunken
spree.
The next matter in which it
seems to me that college spirit is
less active than it should have been
is that of tho rooters' seats. Mr.
Barrett, with the knowledge that
<500 seats bad been too large an al
lowance last year at Berkeley, was
of the opinion that the block of
705 seats set aside for the use of
the rooters was enough, in which
opinion I agreed with him. But
had I disagreed I certainly should
have deferred to Mr. Barrett's judg
ment on account of his experience
in the matter â€”a position which I
think might have been well taken
by some of Mr. Barrett's critics.
As a matter of fact, there were stu
dents who tried to get rooters'seats
and were unable to procure them.
What is the explanation? The ex
planation is at once simple and
unpleasant: Some students were
unable to get rooters' eeats because
other Stanford students had secured
seats in the rooters' section for peo
ple not in the University. One
preparatory school in this vicinity ;
had, in this way, secured a com
paratively large number of rooters'
seats.
I regret extremely at this time
to write a communication of this
nature, but it seems to me that
it is due to the Training House
Corporation and Mr. Barrett on
the one hand, and for the general
welfare on the other, that a few

plain statements should be made in
regard to the matters.
Frank Angell.
