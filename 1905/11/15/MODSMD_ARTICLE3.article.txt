# Glee Club to Resume Practice.
## 
### 
During the last two weeks the re
hearsals of the Glee Club have
practically been abandoned on ac
count of the number of Glee Club
men in the football show and other
activities which require a great
deal of time just before the inter
collegiate game, but next week the
practices will be renewed.
New music has just been received
from the East, and the club will be
gin at once to do systematic work
in getting the program in shape for
the southern trip, to be taken dur
ing the Christmas vacation.
