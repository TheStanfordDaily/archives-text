# FINAL RALLY TO MORROW.
## Recent Victory Will Be Fittingly Celebrated on the Baseball Diamond. 
### 
An enthusiastic rally on the old
baseball diamond to-morrow eve
ning will bring the successful sea
son of 1905 to a fitting close. The
jollification of to-morrow night
will be primarily a celebration of
the victory of last Saturday, and
consequently the men who won the
game will be guests of honor. The
team will be seated together during
the rally in a conspicuous position.
Several faculty members, who have
not yet been announced, will be the
speakers of the evening. An im
mense bonfire will be built in the

middle of the field, and sky-rock
ets and other fireworks touched
off as a part of the celebration,
which will also include the usual
features of the serpentine, and the
giving of songs and yells. Music
will be furnished by the University
Band.
The Freshmen of the University
are expected to furnish the mater
ial for the bonfire, and they are re
quested by Assistant Yell-Leaders
Kellogg and Collom to meet in En
cina club-room at 1:30 to-morrow
afternoon for this purpose.
