# TO VOTE VARSITY EMBLEMS.
## Athletic Committee Will Hold Its First Meeting To-morrow Night. 
### 
The University Athletic Commit
tee will meet to-morrow night in
room 22 at 7:30.' This is the first
meeting of the year, although the
committee was elected last May.
The principal business to be trans
acted will be the voting of the right
to wear Varsity emblems to the
thirteen men who represented Stan
ford last Saturday. The question
of voting second team and substi
tute emblems to the men who were
on the side-lines in the intercolleg
iate game will also be taken up.
There is a strong possibility that
the committee will recommend that
some special emblem, as a watch
fob, be given to the members of this
year's team.
