# Freshman Sweaters Are Returned.
## 
### 
Owing to the mistake in the style
of numerals, made through the
fault of the company from which
the Freshman football sweaters
were ordered, Manager Barrett has
sent the sweaters back. In accord
ance with the decision of the Ath
letic Committee that the Freshman
football sweaters should be in the
same style as those of last year,
the sweaters were ordered to be
made with a block '09, eight inches
high, in white. Instead, however,
those which came bore 1909 across
the breast. The sweaters with the
correct numerals are expected to
arrive about next Friday, Novem
ber 17th.
