# FOOTBALL PROSPECTS
## TWELVE OF THIS YEAR'S TEAM WILL RETURN. Possibility That Several of the 1904 Varsity Will Be Back to College Next Term. 
### 
After last year's intercollegiate
football game there was a well
founded report that the victorious
18-0 team would return almost to
a man. The four-year rule pre
vented Captain Clark, ex-'O5, and
quarter-back Bansbach, '05, from
further participation, but their
places were to be filled by Smith,
ex-'O6, and Stott, '07. Roosevelt,
ex-'O5, one of the guard*, was a
man whose return was not a cer
tainty. Before the 1905 football
season opened, it was definitely
known that Weller, ex-'O7, Dole,
ex-'O5, West, ex-'()7, Shields, '05,
Hyde, '05, and Captain-elect Sprott,
ex-'O6, would not return.
In view of the result of the bril
liant prospects of last season, which
decreased before the opening of col
lege in September 1905, it may be
well to look at the bright prospects
for next year with considerable re
serve.
Of the thirteen men who played
against the University of California
last Saturday all will return, and
will be eligible to play, with the
single exception of Thompson, '05,
the veteran guard, who played for
the fourth time last Saturday.
Around the nucleuß of twelve
veterans whose fighting ability was
demonstrated less than a week ago,
the coaches can build a team
stronger than any which has rep
resented the Cardinal within the
past few years. The excellence of
the second team material, aug
mented by the return of several
Varsity men of last year's team, at
once eliminates the doubt as to the
possibility of good available ma
terial.
The possible return of Weller, ex
'o7, next semester, will be heralded
with much joy by the entire stu
dent body. Weller played full-back
on the victorious 1907 Freshman
team, and easily retained the same
position on the 1903 and 1904 Var
sity elevens. Weller may be shift
ed to a guard position in the event
of his return.
At full-back the most likely can
didate is Crow, '07, who was pre
vented from playing that position
by an injury sustained in the game
with the Sherman Indians. Slush
er, '07, showed clearly by his bril
liant line-bucking in the intercol
legiate game last Saturday that hie
showy playing throughout the pre
liminary season is a characteristic
of his work. Crow and Slusher are
reliable men, but Crow's remark
able defensive playing stamps him
at once as the superior of all can
didates. His line-bucking is char
acterized by the same fierceness
whice earned Slusher his place on
the Varsity.
Chalmers, '07, will resume his
position at right half-back. He
was switched to the full-back posi
tion at the last moment. His work
at either place makes him invalu-
able back of the line, because of his
fearless, dashing play.
The other candidates for posi
tions are all strong men, and the
question is how they will be shifted
in order to give them a chance to
get into the gatne.
Dole, '07, and Vandervoort, '08,
the regular half backs this year,
will both return next fall, and are
eligible to play three more seasons.
Dole's steadiness, and Vander
voort's ability to run in a scattered
field, give these men a lead over
their opponents. Strong, '07, who
played right half-back on the Idaho
varsity for three seasons, will be a
candidate with Rook, '06, for half
back positions.
A Stanford team is never stronger
than at the quarter-back position.
Stott, '07, stands out most promi
nently among the likely candidates
for this position who will return
next year. The fact that he has
played in two intercollegiate con
tests makes it apparent that it will
be difficult to duplicate his work.
Fenton, '08, and Laumeister, '07,
will return, and with Stott will
form the strongest trio Stanford
has had for a decade.
The line presents almost as
brilliant an array of players. The
entire line except Thompson, '05,
will be back and eligible to play.
At tackle there will be Horton, '08,
and Crawford, '09, of this year's
Varsity. Blow, '09, will be eligible
to play next year. He will prove
a worthy rival of Molfino, '07, at
center. The guard positions will
be well filled with Frizzell,'o6, and
Brennan, '07. The possibility of
Weller's playing one of the guards
will materially strengthen the line.
Lyons, '06, Koerner, '08, and Stan
ford,o6, the regular ends this year,
will be back at college and eligible
to play. Smith, ex-'O6, and Butter
field, '05, will both return and com
pete for end positions. Smith won

hiw "S" in 1903, and Buttertield in
1904.
The class of 1909 will furnish
mucli good material. Besides Craw
ford al tuck It*, there are Torney at
end, Goodeli at full-back, Terrill at
half-hack, Cuthbertson and John
son at tackles, Minturn at guard,
and Doane at center, who will join
the squad at the beginning of the
season, and who will in every in
stance give their opponents a hard
run for their positions.
Next year will see a large num
ber of good punters. Besides Craw
fore, '09, who did the-punting this
year, there will be Torney, '09,
Dole, '07, Fenton, 'OS, and Goodeli,
'09.

sity elevens. Weller may be shift
ed to a guard position in the event
of his return.
At full-back the most likely can
didate is Crow, '07, who was pre
vented from playing that position
by an injury sustained in the game
with the Sherman Indians. Slush
er, '07, showed clearly by his bril
liant line-bucking in the intercol
legiate game last Saturday that hie
showy playing throughout the pre
liminary season is a characteristic
of his work. Crow and Slusher are
reliable men, but Crow's remark
able defensive playing stamps him
at once as the superior of all can
didates. His line-bucking is char
acterized by the same fierceness
whice earned Slusher his place on
the Varsity.
Chalmers, '07, will resume his
position at right half-back. He
was switched to the full-back posi
tion at the last moment. His work
at either place makes him invalu-
able back of the line, because of his
fearless, dashing play.
The other candidates for posi
tions are all strong men, and the
question is how they will be shifted
in order to give them a chance to
get into the gatne.
Dole, '07, and Vandervoort, '08,
the regular half backs this year,
will both return next fall, and are
eligible to play three more seasons.
Dole's steadiness, and Vander
voort's ability to run in a scattered
field, give these men a lead over
their opponents. Strong, '07, who
played right half-back on the Idaho
varsity for three seasons, will be a
candidate with Rook, '06, for half
back positions.
A Stanford team is never stronger
than at the quarter-back position.
Stott, '07, stands out most promi
nently among the likely candidates
for this position who will return
next year. The fact that he has
played in two intercollegiate con
tests makes it apparent that it will
be difficult to duplicate his work.
Fenton, '08, and Laumeister, '07,
will return, and with Stott will
form the strongest trio Stanford
has had for a decade.
The line presents almost as
brilliant an array of players. The
entire line except Thompson, '05,
will be back and eligible to play.
At tackle there will be Horton, '08,
and Crawford, '09, of this year's
Varsity. Blow, '09, will be eligible
to play next year. He will prove
a worthy rival of Molfino, '07, at
center. The guard positions will
be well filled with Frizzell,'o6, and
Brennan, '07. The possibility of
Weller's playing one of the guards
will materially strengthen the line.
Lyons, '06, Koerner, '08, and Stan
ford,o6, the regular ends this year,
will be back at college and eligible
to play. Smith, ex-'O6, and Butter
field, '05, will both return and com
pete for end positions. Smith won

hiw "S" in 1903, and Buttertield in
1904.
The class of 1909 will furnish
mucli good material. Besides Craw
ford al tuck It*, there are Torney at
end, Goodeli at full-back, Terrill at
half-hack, Cuthbertson and John
son at tackles, Minturn at guard,
and Doane at center, who will join
the squad at the beginning of the
season, and who will in every in
stance give their opponents a hard
run for their positions.
Next year will see a large num
ber of good punters. Besides Craw
fore, '09, who did the-punting this
year, there will be Torney, '09,
Dole, '07, Fenton, 'OS, and Goodeli,
'09.
After last year's intercollegiate
football game there was a well
founded report that the victorious
18-0 team would return almost to
a man. The four-year rule pre
vented Captain Clark, ex-'O5, and
quarter-back Bansbach, '05, from
further participation, but their
places were to be filled by Smith,
ex-'O6, and Stott, '07. Roosevelt,
ex-'O5, one of the guard*, was a
man whose return was not a cer
tainty. Before the 1905 football
season opened, it was definitely
known that Weller, ex-'O7, Dole,
ex-'O5, West, ex-'()7, Shields, '05,
Hyde, '05, and Captain-elect Sprott,
ex-'O6, would not return.
In view of the result of the bril
liant prospects of last season, which
decreased before the opening of col
lege in September 1905, it may be
well to look at the bright prospects
for next year with considerable re
serve.
Of the thirteen men who played
against the University of California
last Saturday all will return, and
will be eligible to play, with the
single exception of Thompson, '05,
the veteran guard, who played for
the fourth time last Saturday.
Around the nucleuß of twelve
veterans whose fighting ability was
demonstrated less than a week ago,
the coaches can build a team
stronger than any which has rep
resented the Cardinal within the
past few years. The excellence of
the second team material, aug
mented by the return of several
Varsity men of last year's team, at
once eliminates the doubt as to the
possibility of good available ma
terial.
The possible return of Weller, ex
'o7, next semester, will be heralded
with much joy by the entire stu
dent body. Weller played full-back
on the victorious 1907 Freshman
team, and easily retained the same
position on the 1903 and 1904 Var
sity elevens. Weller may be shift
ed to a guard position in the event
of his return.
