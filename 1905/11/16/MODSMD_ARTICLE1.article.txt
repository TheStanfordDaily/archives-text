# FOOTBALL PROSPECTS
## TWELVE OF THIS YEAR'S TEAM WILL RETURN. Possibility That Several of the 1904 Varsity Will Be Back to College Next Term. 
### 
After last year's intercollegiate
football game there was a well
founded report that the victorious
18-0 team would return almost to
a man. The four-year rule pre
vented Captain Clark, ex-'O5, and
quarter-back Bansbach, '05, from
further participation, but their
places were to be filled by Smith,
ex-'O6, and Stott, '07. Roosevelt,
ex-'O5, one of the guard*, was a
man whose return was not a cer
tainty. Before the 1905 football
season opened, it was definitely
known that Weller, ex-'O7, Dole,
ex-'O5, West, ex-'()7, Shields, '05,
Hyde, '05, and Captain-elect Sprott,
ex-'O6, would not return.
In view of the result of the bril
liant prospects of last season, which
decreased before the opening of col
lege in September 1905, it may be
well to look at the bright prospects
for next year with considerable re
serve.
Of the thirteen men who played
against the University of California
last Saturday all will return, and
will be eligible to play, with the
single exception of Thompson, '05,
the veteran guard, who played for
the fourth time last Saturday.
Around the nucleu√ü of twelve
veterans whose fighting ability was
demonstrated less than a week ago,
the coaches can build a team
stronger than any which has rep
resented the Cardinal within the
past few years. The excellence of
the second team material, aug
mented by the return of several
Varsity men of last year's team, at
once eliminates the doubt as to the
possibility of good available ma
terial.
The possible return of Weller, ex
'o7, next semester, will be heralded
with much joy by the entire stu
dent body. Weller played full-back
on the victorious 1907 Freshman
team, and easily retained the same
position on the 1903 and 1904 Var
sity elevens. Weller may be shift
ed to a guard position in the event
of his return.
At full-back the most likely can
didate is Crow, '07, who was pre
vented from playing that position
by an injury sustained in the game
with the Sherman Indians. Slush
er, '07, showed clearly by his bril
liant line-bucking in the intercol
legiate game last Saturday that hie
showy playing throughout the pre
liminary season is a characteristic
of his work. Crow and Slusher are
reliable men, but Crow's remark
able defensive playing stamps him
at once as the superior of all can
didates. His line-bucking is char
acterized by the same fierceness
whice earned Slusher his place on
the Varsity.
Chalmers, '07, will resume his
position at right half-back. He
was switched to the full-back posi
tion at the last moment. His work
at either place makes him invalu-
