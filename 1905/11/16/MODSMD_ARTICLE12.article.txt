The gift of a watch to Professor
Wing in appreciation of his work
toward the building of Stanford
Field is an expression of gratitude
from the whole student body. The
college at large realizes the invalu
able work that he has done toward
the erection of Stanford's new stadi
um, and the great expense that he
has saved the student body. It is
fitting that some token be given
this benefactor as a symbol of the
feeling of the undergraduates.
