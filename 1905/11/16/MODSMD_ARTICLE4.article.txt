# NO WORK ON DIAMOND
## LANAGAN DISCONTINUES FIRST SEMESTER BASEBALL. Lateness of Season and Inability of Coach to Be Present Cause This Step. 
### 
Contrary to last year's policy,
there will lie no baseball practice
this fall. Coach Lanagan was de
cidedly opposed to any continua
tion of this custom, and the fact
that Captain Sales has been called
away to Seattle on private business
for about two weeks makes any
practice impossible. Last year
about twenty-five men turned out
and did light work under the
supervision of Captain Trowbridge.
The practice proved of little value
in getting a line on new men be
cause it was started too late in the
year, the heavy rains soon causing
it to be discontinued.
This year Lanagan has deter
mined to take charge of the work
from the beginning, and he prefers
to lose the little additional time
afforded by fall practice to run
ning the risk of having the men
started off contrary to his ideas.
Moreover, some of the best baseball
men have been playing football
this fall, and they cannot spare
the time for work on the diamond.
In all probability this next sea
son will see some changes in the
coaching of the Stanford baseball
squad. Lanagan's personality and
knowledge of the game should be
invaluable in turning out a team
which will break the Stanford
hoodoo in next spring's intercol
legiate series. Two years ago when
he coached the Varsity, after Doyle
had been compelled to leave, the
team improved sufficiently in one
week to take the second game of
the series from California, and to
lose the third by a very small mar
gin, after a close contest.
