# PROF. WING REWARDED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VOTES HIM A GOLD WATCH. Football Fobs Awarded to Members of Winning Team, Coaches, Trainer, and Manager. 
### 
The most important action taken
by the Executive Committee at
their regular weekly meeting last
night was the voting of a gold
watch to Professor C. B. Wing, who
did so much toward the completion
of the new football bleachers and
the training house. Professor Wing
drew the plans of the new bleach
ers, donating his services free of
charge to the student body. Mana
ger Barrett has been appointed to
purchase the watch and have it
properly inscribed. This will be a
fitting token of the student body's
appreciation of Professor Wing's
work. If possible, the watch will
be presented at to-night's rally.
The committee also voted small
gold football watch-fobs to the
members of this year's winning
football team, and to the coaches,
trainer, and manager. Manager
Barrett announced that he was un
able to present a detailed report of
the finances of Saturday's game, as
Manager Decoto of California is
away on a trip, and he has not yet
turned in his account.
