# ROBLE TO ENTERTAIN.
## Faculty of the University Will Be Guests at Presentation of Play. 
### 
Friday evening the faculty will
be the guests of the Ruble Club at
the reception which is tendered an
nually to them by the members
of the club. During the evening
W. B. Yeats' play, ''Land of
Heart's Desire," will be presented
by a cast composed of members of
the faculty and of Roble Club.
The scene of the play is laid in a
county of Ireland, and the life
pictured is the simple Irish coun
try life of a century ago. The
story centers around the rural
peasant festivities of May-day eve,
and the presence of the fairy-child,
whose companions carry off the
spirit of the newly-made bride,
Mai re Bruin.
Interest is added to the play by
the fact that Mr. Yeats lectured
here last year on the "Revival of
the Celtic Drama," a subject in
which he is greatly interested.
