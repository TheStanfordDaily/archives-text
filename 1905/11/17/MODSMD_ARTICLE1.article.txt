# RALLY CLOSES SEASON
## GATHERING ON DIAMOND ENDS FOOTBALL FOR YEAR. Little Enthusiasm Shown at Final Jolly-up in Honor of Saturday's Victory. 
### 
The football season of 1905 was
brought to a close last night by the
final rally of the year, which was
held on the baseball diamond, with
the usual display of fireworks and
red fire. The celebration was con
tinued for over an hour and a half,
but was disappointing in the lack
of real enthusiasm which should
have marked the rejoicing over last
Saturday's splendid victory.
At 7:30 the men of Encina Hall
formed in the club-room, and
headed by the band marched in
procession across the baseball dia
mond, past the bleachers, where a
fair-sized crowd had already assem
bled, and up Lasuen street, being
augmented en route by men from
the fraternity houses. Then they
proceeded down Alvarado row, re
joining the crowd on the diamond.
The lighting of the bonfire, which
had been prepared by some of the
men of the Freshman Class, was
delayed long enough to enable some
songs and yells to be given, and in
the meantime twelve boxes of red
fire were set off, and twelve sky
rockets fired, representing the num
ber of points scored in last Satur
day's game.
Dr. Frank Angell, Captain Chal
mers, and Professor E. P. Smith, of
the Geology department, were to
have been the speakers of the eve
ning, but the latter was the only
one present at the rally. His speech
was short, but full of praise for the
men who represented Stanford in
this year's game with California.
He spoke in part as follows:
"Hero worship is a characteristic
of the human race, and from the
days of Greece down to the present,
men have bowed down and worship
ped at the feet of their particular
heroes. Even to-day each of us
has his own particular idol. The
graduate of some years standing
refers back to the names of Carle
or Fickert, Cotton or Murphy, as
the greatest of Stanford's football
heroes. This year we have no par
ticular hero. There are thirteen of
them, and they include every one
of the thirteen men who played on
Stanford Field last Saturday. Every
member of that team that went in
to the game predestined to defeat
by the critics, and came out with a
score of 12 to 5 in its favor, is a hero.
"Stanford football history divides
itself into three eras; the first is
the era of Camp, the second that of
what we shall call mixed coaching
and the third that of Lanagan.
As long as the era of Lanagan
lasts, Stanford will keep on win
ning,as she has done since it began."
A short address was made by C.
A. Beardsley, '06, who said Profes
sor C. B. Wing would be presented
with the gold watch voted him by
the Executive Committee in recog
nition of his services in the build
ing of Stanford Field. The rally
closed with the singing of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail!"
