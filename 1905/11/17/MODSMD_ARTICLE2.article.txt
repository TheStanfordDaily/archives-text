# VARSITY EMBLEMS FOR OARSMEN
## Athletic Committee Make Many Radical Changes at Last Night's Meeting. 
### 
The Athletic Committee held its
first meeting last night arid decided
on many questions of the utmost
importance to Stanford. The most
interesting action taken by the
committee, and the one which will
be the farthest reaching in its
effects, is the granting of the Var
sity "S" to all future Varsity crews
as long as boating remains an in
tercollegiate sport. The motion as
originally passed granted sweaters
to last year's crew, but this was
afterwards amended. The award
was made under the new ruling,
adopted last January by the inter
collegiate athletic committee, which
made annual freshman and varsity
boat races a regular intercollegiate
event, and placed the sport on an
intercollegiate basis. In this con
nection block intercollegiate '08
numerals were voted to last year's
victorious Freshman crew. The
men who will receive these sweaters
are E. N. Smith, A. N. Cole, R. H.
Conant, L.R.Gay, and F. W.Turner.
The committee then took up the
matter of class baseball and tennis
sweaters. After considerable dis
cussion, it was decided that here
after class numerals in these sports
should only be granted to teams
winning the interclass champion
ship. The committee farther de
cided that this ruling should be
held to cover all numerals granted
in the future, whether they were
granted for past or future contests.
Thiß rule will have an excellent
effect on the promiscuous distribu
tion of class sweaters which has
taken place in the past.
The committee then took up the
matter of granting some special
emblem to men who have won
their Varsity "S" for four consecu
tive years in any one branch of in
tercollegiate sport. The matter
was finally passed on to a sub-com
mittee composed of E. P. Stott, '07,
A. J. Chalmers, '07, and Manager
Barrett, and full power to adopt
such an emblem was placed in
their hands. This sub-committee
met this afternoon and decided on
a regular white "S" with four white
stars in a line, directly above it.
This emblem will be given only to
a man who has won his emblem
four times in the same branch of
athletics. The only sweater of
this kind given by the committee

last night was voted to R. A.
Thompson, '05, who has played
guard on the Varsity football team
for the past four years.
Regular Varsity emblems were
voted to the thirteen men who
played against California last Sat
urday. The names of those who
will receive these sweaters are: A.
J. Chalmers, '07, G. E. Dole, '07,
T. Vandervoort, '08, E. P. Stott,
'07, W. E. Lyons, '06. W. F. Koer

Crawford, '09, P. T. Frizzell, '06,
A. Molfino, '07, J. N. Stanford, '06,
and D. SI usher, '07. Black Ger
man "S" emblems were voted to all
the men who were on the side-lines
in Saturday's game. As nearly as
can be ascertained thirteen men
will receive this emblem. They
are: J. R. Pemberton, '08, L. R.
Gay, '08, A. B. Cox, '08, F. Lane,
'06, J. G. Marks, '06, R. H. Rook,
'06, C. F. Laumeister, '07, J. F.
Crow, '07, K. L. Fenton, '08, T.
Vail, '08, S. B. Thompson, '07, L.
Bogle, '06, and E. Lamb, '06.
The recommendation of the Ex
ecutive Committee that gold watch
fobs be given to the members of
this year's Varsity was formally
sanctioned, and Chalmers, Stott
and Barrett were appointed as a
committee to adopt the design for
these emblems. The committee
met this afternoon and decided on
a gold football similar in shape
and size to that granted last year.
On one side the football will have
a raised Varsity "S" in red enamel
and the engraving "1905," "Pacific
Coast Champions." On the other
side will be the player's name and
the position which he played, and
under this the score, "Stanford 12,
California 5." Beside the thirteen
men who played in Saturday's
game, these fobs were voted to
Coach Lanagan, Assistant-Coach
Hansbach, Trainer Moulton, and
Manager Barrett.
The men present at last night's
meeting were E. P. Stott, '07, L. G.
Russell, '06, A. .T. Chalmers, '07, J.

The Athletic Committee held its
first meeting last night arid decided
on many questions of the utmost
importance to Stanford. The most
interesting action taken by the
committee, and the one which will
be the farthest reaching in its
effects, is the granting of the Var
sity "S" to all future Varsity crews
as long as boating remains an in
tercollegiate sport. The motion as
originally passed granted sweaters
to last year's crew, but this was
afterwards amended. The award
was made under the new ruling,
adopted last January by the inter
collegiate athletic committee, which
made annual freshman and varsity
boat races a regular intercollegiate
event, and placed the sport on an
intercollegiate basis. In this con
nection block intercollegiate '08
numerals were voted to last year's
victorious Freshman crew. The
men who will receive these sweaters
are E. N. Smith, A. N. Cole, R. H.
Conant, L.R.Gay, and F. W.Turner.
The committee then took up the
matter of class baseball and tennis
sweaters. After considerable dis
cussion, it was decided that here
after class numerals in these sports
should only be granted to teams
winning the interclass champion
ship. The committee farther de
cided that this ruling should be
held to cover all numerals granted
in the future, whether they were
granted for past or future contests.
Thiß rule will have an excellent
effect on the promiscuous distribu
tion of class sweaters which has
taken place in the past.
The committee then took up the
matter of granting some special
emblem to men who have won
their Varsity "S" for four consecu
tive years in any one branch of in
tercollegiate sport. The matter
was finally passed on to a sub-com
mittee composed of E. P. Stott, '07,
A. J. Chalmers, '07, and Manager
Barrett, and full power to adopt
such an emblem was placed in
their hands. This sub-committee
met this afternoon and decided on
a regular white "S" with four white
stars in a line, directly above it.
This emblem will be given only to
a man who has won his emblem
four times in the same branch of
athletics. The only sweater of
this kind given by the committee

last night was voted to R. A.
Thompson, '05, who has played
guard on the Varsity football team
for the past four years.
Regular Varsity emblems were
voted to the thirteen men who
played against California last Sat
urday. The names of those who
will receive these sweaters are: A.
J. Chalmers, '07, G. E. Dole, '07,
T. Vandervoort, '08, E. P. Stott,
'07, W. E. Lyons, '06. W. F. Koer

Crawford, '09, P. T. Frizzell, '06,
A. Molfino, '07, J. N. Stanford, '06,
and D. SI usher, '07. Black Ger
man "S" emblems were voted to all
the men who were on the side-lines
in Saturday's game. As nearly as
can be ascertained thirteen men
will receive this emblem. They
are: J. R. Pemberton, '08, L. R.
Gay, '08, A. B. Cox, '08, F. Lane,
'06, J. G. Marks, '06, R. H. Rook,
'06, C. F. Laumeister, '07, J. F.
Crow, '07, K. L. Fenton, '08, T.
Vail, '08, S. B. Thompson, '07, L.
Bogle, '06, and E. Lamb, '06.
The recommendation of the Ex
ecutive Committee that gold watch
fobs be given to the members of
this year's Varsity was formally
sanctioned, and Chalmers, Stott
and Barrett were appointed as a
committee to adopt the design for
these emblems. The committee
met this afternoon and decided on
a gold football similar in shape
and size to that granted last year.
On one side the football will have
a raised Varsity "S" in red enamel
and the engraving "1905," "Pacific
Coast Champions." On the other
side will be the player's name and
the position which he played, and
under this the score, "Stanford 12,
California 5." Beside the thirteen
men who played in Saturday's
game, these fobs were voted to
Coach Lanagan, Assistant-Coach
Hansbach, Trainer Moulton, and
Manager Barrett.
The men present at last night's
meeting were E. P. Stott, '07, L. G.
Russell, '06, A. .T. Chalmers, '07, J.
C. Macfarland, '07, F. R. Lanagan,
