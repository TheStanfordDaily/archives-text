# FIRST TRACK MEET
## LARGE NUMBER OF ENTRIES INDICATE EXCITING CONTEST. All Distances Will Be Shortened. First Race at Ten O'Clock Sharp To-morrow. 
### 
From present indications the fall
track meet to be held to-morrow
morning promises to he one of the
most successful ever held at this
time of the year. There has been
an unusually large number of men
training this fall, and consequently
the entries for to-morrow's meet
will be large. The first event will
start at ten o'clock, and admission
to the oval will be free.
It is always uncertain to predict
which races will be fast and close
ly contested, but judging from the
entries it appears that the two-mile
event will be the most exciting of
the day. The distance will be
shortened to five laps, making it a
mile and a quarter, and there will
be at least four first-class men en
tered. C. D. Giebel, '08, who ran
well in the intercollegiate two-mile
last spring, and W. C. Shelton, '08,
one of the best of last year's milers,
will be two entries already known
here. Two new men who are ex
pected to give a good account of
themselves are W. B. Loughbor
ough, '07, who was a cross-country
runner at the University of Kansas,
and J. G. Ferguson, '09, a Fresh
man who has done considerable
distance running in England. With
such a field the time should be fast
in this event, and a close finish is
expected.
The quarter-mile event, which
will be shortened to 300 yards, also
promises to be a hotly contested
race. W. M. Rawles, the Fresh
man who has a good preparatory
school record in this event, will
meet some men to-morrow who are
sure to make him do his best.
The work of all men in the field
events will be watched with inter
est, as Trainer Moulton is very
anxious to develop some new weight
men and some jumpers. F. M.
Redman, '07, is the only man now
in college, and eligible to compete
against California, who was entered
in the broad jump in last year's
intercollegiate meet. H. L. Hor
ton, '08, who was entered in three
events in last year's intercollegiate
meet, will probably be one of the
strongest men in the shot-put and
high jump this year. Horton has
not done any work on the track
since last spring on account of foot
ball, but he may enter theehot-put
to-morrow. However, there are
several Freshmen who should de
velop in both the weight events and
the jumps. D. P. Crawford, '09,
who played on the Varsity football
team, is expected to do well in the
weights, and W. M. Rawles, '09,
has done some good broad jump
ing. There are also other men out
for these events who give promise
of developing into point winners
before next April.
In the sprints and the hurdles it
is hard to tell how the men will
perform to-morrow, but it is certain
that several of them are in first
class condition. Captain Macfar
land, '07, L. M. Edwards, '07, and
W. E. McNeil, '07, have all been
working steadily this fall. Either
the hundred or the two-twenty may
bring out some Freshman, as sever
al of the new men have shown re
markable speed in starting. The
220-yard dash will be cut down
to 180 yards as the trainer is afraid
to run the men too hard so early
in the year.

mores against the Juniors and I
Freshmen. Each relay will proba
bly be two hundred and twenty
yards, but this is undecided.

will enter the meet than given above,
as many of them neglected to sign
the entry blanks in time to appear
in this issue.
