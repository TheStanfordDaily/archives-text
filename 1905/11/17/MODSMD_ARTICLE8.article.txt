A number of important steps
were taken by the Athletic Com
mittee last night. Some were in
the right direction, but one at least
will be questionable in its effects.
The committee seems to have rushed
headlong into several important
matters without first sufficiently
testing student body opinion upon
them.
In the main, they have proved
to be right. The curtailing of the
list of men who will receive class
baseball and tennis sweaters, by
imposing the qualification that they
must be interclass champions, is
certainly a move in the right direc
tion. It will serve to raise the pres
ent cheap class sweater, which is
being and has been worn by men
who are not deserving of this ques
tionable honor, to a higher stand
ard. The action awarding a Var
sity sweater with four stars to a
man who has won his emblem for
four years, will provide a suitable
insignia for such men.
But the action of voting Varsity
sweaters to the boating men seems
to have been a hasty step. That the
crew and all the boating men are
deserving of the greatest credit for
the spirit that they have shown and
the way that they have struggled
to make the sport a success is ac
knowledged; that they have prac
ticed faithfully with little encour
agement is known; that ultimately
the custom of awarding Varsity
emblems to the members of the
crew should be started, is grant
ed. But is the present the right
time to start, this custom? If
the committee is basing its action
upon the fact that the sport has
been recently placed upon an inter
collegiate basis, why did they not
vote sweaters to members of last
year's crew, who rowed under this
agreement? If the action is based
on the fact that the committee
thinks that it has reached the right
point of prominence in undergrad

uate life, let them find out how
many studenta even know all the
names of the men who rowed on
last season's crew. That the com
munity should know all these men
is acknowledged. But the fact that
they do not, is an example of the
way the sport is regarded here. If
they gave the "S" to promote inter
est in this sport, they will probably
attain their end to a certain degree.
But this end could be accomplished,
not so quickly but without cheapen
ing the Varsity emblem, by giving
the crew some other insignia in
recognition, and holding out the
"S" for the time when they
Bhould attain a certain standard.
Does it seem right for the crew
man to wear the same emblem as
the football man, when two sports
are not regarded as being any
where in the same class by the stu
dent body? As long as the com
mittee is proceeding along these
lines it is but a step farther to the
tennis and basket-ball men. The
cry is raised I hat these men do not
have to do the grinding training
that the crew has to go through.
If so, why does not the track man
who works all year on the track,
makes the team, being one of the
three to five men in his event, hut
fails to make a point, receive
the Varsity "S"? He gets a Ger
man "S" in recognition of his ser
vices, but no Varsity "S" is allotted
to him. But regarding the Boat.
Club as it stands at present, has it
had a trainer to see that the men
kept training and were in condition?
Has it had a coach appointed by
the student manager, like other
Varsity sports? It has had a
coach, to be sure; but has he been
a man who is especially fitted for
the work, like other universities
have — for example, California?
That the crew should be given
some distinctive insignia is proper
and is needed; that the crews
should ultimately receive the Var
sity "S" at Stanford is also proper
and necessary. But that the time
has arrived for granting the Varsi
ty emblem is open for grave doubt.

must be interclass champions, is
certainly a move in the right direc
tion. It will serve to raise the pres
ent cheap class sweater, which is
being and has been worn by men
who are not deserving of this ques
tionable honor, to a higher stand
ard. The action awarding a Var
sity sweater with four stars to a
man who has won his emblem for
four years, will provide a suitable
insignia for such men.
But the action of voting Varsity
sweaters to the boating men seems
to have been a hasty step. That the
crew and all the boating men are
deserving of the greatest credit for
the spirit that they have shown and
the way that they have struggled
to make the sport a success is ac
knowledged; that they have prac
ticed faithfully with little encour
agement is known; that ultimately
the custom of awarding Varsity
emblems to the members of the
crew should be started, is grant
ed. But is the present the right
time to start, this custom? If
the committee is basing its action
upon the fact that the sport has
been recently placed upon an inter
collegiate basis, why did they not
vote sweaters to members of last
year's crew, who rowed under this
agreement? If the action is based
on the fact that the committee
thinks that it has reached the right
point of prominence in undergrad

uate life, let them find out how
many studenta even know all the
names of the men who rowed on
last season's crew. That the com
munity should know all these men
is acknowledged. But the fact that
they do not, is an example of the
way the sport is regarded here. If
they gave the "S" to promote inter
est in this sport, they will probably
attain their end to a certain degree.
But this end could be accomplished,
not so quickly but without cheapen
ing the Varsity emblem, by giving
the crew some other insignia in
recognition, and holding out the
"S" for the time when they
Bhould attain a certain standard.
Does it seem right for the crew
man to wear the same emblem as
the football man, when two sports
are not regarded as being any
where in the same class by the stu
dent body? As long as the com
mittee is proceeding along these
lines it is but a step farther to the
tennis and basket-ball men. The
cry is raised I hat these men do not
have to do the grinding training
that the crew has to go through.
If so, why does not the track man
who works all year on the track,
makes the team, being one of the
three to five men in his event, hut
fails to make a point, receive
the Varsity "S"? He gets a Ger
man "S" in recognition of his ser
vices, but no Varsity "S" is allotted
to him. But regarding the Boat.
Club as it stands at present, has it
had a trainer to see that the men
kept training and were in condition?
Has it had a coach appointed by
the student manager, like other
Varsity sports? It has had a
coach, to be sure; but has he been
a man who is especially fitted for
the work, like other universities
have — for example, California?
That the crew should be given
some distinctive insignia is proper
and is needed; that the crews
should ultimately receive the Var
sity "S" at Stanford is also proper
and necessary. But that the time
has arrived for granting the Varsi
ty emblem is open for grave doubt.
