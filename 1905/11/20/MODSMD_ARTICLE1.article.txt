# FAST TIME ON TRACK
## ODD-NUMBERED CLASSES WIN FIRST FIELD MEET. W.M. Rawles, '09, Was Star Performer.—Other Freshmen Show Good Form. 
### 
The interchips fall track meet
held Saturday morning resulted in
a decisive victory for the odd num
bered classes by the score of 88£
to 61 -i. Points made by each class
were as follows: '08,
'07,31; '06, 20; '05,1. As was
expected, the Freshmen showed
some good men, and '09 promises
to be a strong track class, with sev
eral point winners in the intercol
legiate meet next spring. W. M.
Rawles, '09, was the star of the
meet and did even more than was
expected of him. He won the hun
dred and two hundred and twenty
yard dashes in fast time and also
captured first place in the broad
jump, clearing 21 feet inches,
which is remarkably good work.
Rawles also tied for third place in
the high jump at 5 feet 2 inches.
The hundred-yard dash was run
on the football field, and taking
this into consideration 0:10.2 is ex
cellent time. Altogether Rawles
made points, which was by far
the highest number of points made
by any individual.
In the two-mile event, which was
shortened to a mile and a quarter,
J. G. Fergusson, '09, won easily
from Shelton,'oB, a miler on last
year's Varsity team, and several
other good men. Fergusson took
the lead and set the pace all the
way, finishing with a strong sprint
more than twenty yards ahead of
Shelton. Judging from Saturday'B
performance Fergusson will be a
valuable man in the intercollegiate
two mile. C. D. Giebel, '08, who
ran well in the two-mile against
California last year, did not enter
this event Saturday as he has a
slightly sprained ankle
The quarter - mile, which was
shortened to 300 yards, was won
handily by G. M. Goldsmith, '06,
from a fast field. J. D. Hussey,
'09, was the only Freshman enter
ed in this race and he finished fifth,
which was good considering the
extremely fast pace.
In the low hurdles S. VV. Cooper,
'09, took first place, with J. B.
Swickard, '09, second, and C. A.
Ball, '06, third. Both the Fresh
men in this event showed good
form, and Stanford promises to be
nearly as strong in the low hurdles
next spring as she was last year.
Captain Macfarland did not enter
the low hurdles, but he won the
high hurdles, with C. A. Ball, '06,
a close second, and B. L. Gregg, '09,
third. Ball showed up well in
both the hurdles for this time of
the year, as he is not yet in good
condition.
H. L. Horton, '08, won the shot
put at 37 feet 6 inches, which is
only two feet less than his per
formance last spring, when he took
third place on the intercollegiate.
W. K. Ford, '09, took fourth place
in this event with 33 feet 1 inch,
but this is below his usual per
formance.

There were only five entries in
the mile event, which was shortened
to three-quarters of a mile, and J.
P. Dunn, '08, won easily in the
good time of 3:40. Dunn tried the
sprints last year, but it appears
that he is a better distance man,
and he may come out for the mile
next spring. The high jump was
won at 5 feet 4½ inches by T. A.
Du Flon, '06, with B. Stolz, '09,
second.
The performances in all events
except the high jump and shot-put
were superior to those in the fall
meet last year and Trainer Moul
ton expressed himself as well satis
fied with the results. He was es
pecially pleased with the work of
the new men in the sprints and the
broad jump. L. G. Freeman, '06,
and several other veterans did not
compete in Saturday's meet, so the
prospects for next spring are even
brighter than would be shown by
the results of this first meet. There
was no hammer-throw or pole
vault in the meet Saturday, and the
relay was eliminated because most
of the men who intended to enter
this event had already run in sev
eral races and they were not in
condition for the relay. A. E.
Roth, '09, a fast Freshman in the
100- and 220-yard dashes, was un
able to enter the meet on account
of sickness.
