Thk communication in to-night's
issue comes from a member of the
Boat Club, when a member of the
Athletic Committee could more
properly justify thesr action, but
the arguments advanced are prob
ably the same. The main trend
of the article from start to finish ie
to convey the idea that because of
the time, labor and energy ex
pended, the crew should receive the
Varsity "S." In fact, the whole
justification of the committee's
action rests, according to the wri
ter's article, more upon the work
done than upon the result accomp
lished. In a word, the giving of the
Varsity sweater is "charitable," al
though the writer while conveying
this ideaand approving of it, plain
ly states that the sweaters were not
awarded for "charitable motives."
His statement that the Varsity
emblem was given in "just recogni
tion of deserving athletes" borders
on thecharitv idea, and is certainly
not the principle which has guided
the granting of these sweaters in
the past.
Does the football man who plays
hard for several seasons and is
finally conceded his place on the
Varsity eleven but injures himself
shortly before the game and fails
to get into the actual contest, re
ceive his Varsity "S"? He is cer
tainly a "deserving athlete" in the
fullest sense, but he does not re
ceive the emblem. Why? Because
the Varsity "S" is given for results
accomplished, and formerly has not
been distributed by a benevolent
society.
The writer maintains that condi
tions which governed last year's
crew "are different from the prob
able conditions of the next regatta."
Th word "probable" leaves too
much room for the uncertainty with
which the coming conditions must
be viewed. Before we run the risk
of greatly cheapening our most

Bacred emblem we Bhould be shown
what the "probable conditions" are.
The comparison of last year's relay
team to the Varsity boat crew, in
the matter of the respective men
being known, is not a fair one, for
the relay team is only part of the
track team; and if the boating men
are going to compare only part of
the men of one Varsity team, let
them reduce their men proportion
ately. A more fair comparison
would be, Do more people know the
men who ran on last year's relay
team than know the man who
rowed number three on the crew?
The track men and relay men have
a far greater acquaintance than the
crew men, which shows their sport
is one entered into with a greater
interest by the student body.
When the writer begins to com
pare the crew with baseball in a
matter of training he is not draw
ing a very good analogy in sports.
The baseball man needs very little
care from the trainer, but what
little he needs is given by the reg
ular salaried trainer of the student
body. The reason that is given for
not having a salaried coach is the
tendency to get away from profes
sionalism. It is a fine theory; but
boating is a trifle weak to take this
lead when football, baseball and
track cannot do without the sal
aried instructor.
In speaking or giving the Varsity
"S" to the men the writer makes
the broad statement that the "ma
jority of the student body are ready
to grant they deserve the emblem."
This should he qualified by the
words 11 some emblem." Another
statement to the effect that the
action is supported by the student
body, if not untrue, is permissible
of so much doubt that it is at least
very questionable in its authentic
ity.
Not on a charitable basis, but on
results accomplished, the crew de
serve some distinctive emblem —but
not the Varsity " S." They do not
deserve the "S" until they have
raised boating to a higher standard
than at present. Let the Univer
sity help the boating men to this
level, not by the cross-cut of cheap
ening the Varßitv " S," but by help
along other lines.
