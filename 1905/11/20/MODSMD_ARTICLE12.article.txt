Editor Daily Palo Alto:
An editorial in Friday's daily,
while admitting that the men who
make the crew should, at some
time, receive the Varsity sweater,
sought to raise the doubt that the
proper time had come.
A substantial reason that the
next crew should receive the Var
sity "8" is the fact that the sport has
been placed on an intercollegiate
basis: the crew will row under the
intercollegiate agreement and in
the name of the Stanford Varsity
crew. You dismiss this with the
question as to why the Athletic
Committee did not vote the emblem
to the members of last year's crew.
The conditions of the regatta last
year were different from the prob
able conditions of the next regatta,
and the Athletic Committee prob
ably had reasons for not voting the
U S" to last year's hard-working
crew. But suppose they did not.
Is that not the more reason that
they should right the wrong this
year instead of allowing it to con
tinue?
You contend that boating is not
of sufficient prominence in under
graduate life, and support this by
the statement that the students do
not know the names of the men
who rowed on last season's crew.
This is partially true; but it is a
sad fact that it is true in about the
same proportion of the members
of other Varsity teams. Take what
is perhaps the fairest example:
How many students can name the
members of our last seas( n's win
ning relay team? The writer has
asked a number and finds that
most of them can name three of
the five relay men, four of whom
are now in college, and three of the
five members of the crew, three of
whom are now in college. This
despite the fact that the relay men
are well-known upperclasstnen,
who won their "S" before the close
of last semester and have been
wearing their Varsity sweaters
about the campus this year. The
Varsity crew, on the contrary,
rowed the intercollegiate race after
commencement last spring, and its
members have not worn the Var
sity emblem to distinguish them
from their fellow students. Is the
lamentable state of ignorance
among the students as to the iden
tity of our athletes to serve as a
a pretext for refusing the ''S" to
those who fairly earn it and whom
a majority of the student body are
ready to grant deserve the emblem?
The fact that fifty men turned out
last year, voluntarily kept train
ing rules, worked hard and con
sistently trying for places on
the crews shows that the students
are interested in boating. The
more so in that these men had no
hope of reward other than the
pleasure derived from the sport
and the knowledge that our ap
preciative student body generally

supports those who earn and de
serve support.
It is true the boating men have
had no salaried trainer. Neither
have the baseball men, yet who
questions that the baseball men
earn their Varsity sweaters? The
man who voluntarily works and
trains consistently surely deserves
equal credit with the one who does
so only under "Dad" Moulton's
watchful eye. This voluntary
training the boating men have
done for two seasons, and the wri
ter has yet to find the boat
ing man that has broken training
rules in training season. It is also
true that the crews have had no
salaried coach. But in the midst
of our fight against professionalism
are we to refuse recognition to our
representatives because their coacji
es, who have turned out four good
crews —crews able to compete with
the well-financed, university-sup
ported crews of Berkeley and
Washington—did not receive a sal
ary for so doing?
Varsity sweaters were not voted
to the crew from charitable mo
tives. Kour years of up-hill effort;
two years of consistent training
and hard practice, four good crews
upon the water; a fair fight and a
good fight, for the name and honor
of Stanford, deserve recognition. It
is for services given, for work and
time, and training, shown in a
good cause and with the Stanford
spirit, that the Athletic Committee
has voted the Varsity "S" to the
men of next spring's crew. In the
interest of good spirit, fair play
and just recognition of deserving
athletes the action of the commit
tee in granting the "S" to the Var
sity crew should be and is support

How many students can name the

five members of the crew, three of
whom are now in college. This
despite the fact that the relay men
are well-known upperclasstnen,
who won their "S" before the close
of last semester and have been
wearing their Varsity sweaters
about the campus this year. The
Varsity crew, on the contrary,
rowed the intercollegiate race after
commencement last spring, and its
members have not worn the Var

from their fellow students. Is the

among the students as to the iden

a pretext for refusing the ''S" to
those who fairly earn it and whom
a majority of the student body are
ready to grant deserve the emblem?
The fact that fifty men turned out
last year, voluntarily kept train

the crews shows that the students
are interested in boating. The
more so in that these men had no

pleasure derived from the sport
and the knowledge that our ap

supports those who earn and de

It is true the boating men have
had no salaried trainer. Neither
have the baseball men, yet who

earn their Varsity sweaters? The
man who voluntarily works and

equal credit with the one who does
so only under "Dad" Moulton's
watchful eye. This voluntary
training the boating men have
done for two seasons, and the wri
ter has yet to find the boat

rules in training season. It is also
true that the crews have had no
salaried coach. But in the midst

are we to refuse recognition to our

the well-financed, university-sup

Washington—did not receive a sal

Varsity sweaters were not voted
to the crew from charitable mo

two years of consistent training

good fight, for the name and honor
of Stanford, deserve recognition. It
is for services given, for work and
time, and training, shown in a

spirit, that the Athletic Committee
has voted the Varsity "S" to the

"A Boat Club Man"
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
An editorial in Friday's daily,
while admitting that the men who
make the crew should, at some
time, receive the Varsity sweater,
sought to raise the doubt that the
proper time had come.
A substantial reason that the
next crew should receive the Var
sity "8" is the fact that the sport has
been placed on an intercollegiate
basis: the crew will row under the
intercollegiate agreement and in
the name of the Stanford Varsity
crew. You dismiss this with the
question as to why the Athletic
Committee did not vote the emblem
to the members of last year's crew.
The conditions of the regatta last
year were different from the prob
able conditions of the next regatta,
and the Athletic Committee prob
ably had reasons for not voting the
U S" to last year's hard-working
crew. But suppose they did not.
Is that not the more reason that
they should right the wrong this
year instead of allowing it to con
tinue?
You contend that boating is not
of sufficient prominence in under
graduate life, and support this by
the statement that the students do
not know the names of the men
who rowed on last season's crew.
This is partially true; but it is a
sad fact that it is true in about the
same proportion of the members
