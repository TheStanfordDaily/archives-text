# WATCHMAN IS DISCHARGED.
## Release Comes as the Result of His Actions After the Encina "At Home." 
### 
The watchman in Encina Hall,
who has created a great deal of an
tagonism since first coining to the
Hall, was summarily released Sat
urday night for intoxication. When
the recent trouble in Encina Hall
was being investigated the students
claimed that this watchman was
not a suitable person for such a
position, as he was in the habit of
imbibing too freely before going on
duty and even while acting in his
official capacity. After the com
plaint had gone before the Board
of Trustees it was put on the table
and no action has ever been taken.
Saturday night the watchman
was noticed by eeveral students
to be in such an intoxicated condi
tion that he was absolutely unfit to
discharge his duties. Custodian P.
Q. Atkinson was notified and he
came to the Hall and immediately
released the watchman. His place
has been taken by one of the men
who was formerly a mounted watch
man on the estate.
