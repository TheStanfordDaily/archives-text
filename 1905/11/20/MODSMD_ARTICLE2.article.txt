# SELECTION OF PLAY
## SOPHOMORES WILL PRESENT "SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER," After Long Deliberation Class Decides to Give Goldsmith's Masterpiece Next Semester. 
### 
Oliver Goldsmith's "She Stoops
to Conquer," a clever comedy of
five acts, will be presented next se
mester by the Class of 1908. This
conclusion was reached to-day by
the class play committee —Miss
Helen Green, Miss E. L. Bucking
ham, E. J. Swift, C. L. Severy, and
H. B. Menardi — which has been de
liberating for some time over the
selection of a suitable drama for
production by the class.
"She Stoops to Conquer" is con
sidered the best of Goldsmith's sev
eral dramas. It was first staged in
1773 in Covent Garden, London,
and won an immediate and lasting
fame. Indeed, so successful was the
play at its initial appearance that
it ran an entire season, and when
published shortly after, 6000 copies
were immediately sold.
The comedy is dedicated to Sam
uel Johnson. One of Goldsmith's
biographers has said that this work
was "about the best thing of its
kind in the English literature of
the eighteenth century.
There are ten parts varying but
slightly in importance, six of them
being taken by men and four by
women. In addition there are sev
eral minor characters.
The cast will be selected by a
try-out, and will consist only of
Sophomores. The committee has
not yet set a definite date for the
holding of the try-out, but it will
be sometime early in the next
month.
Mrs. J. E. Walker of Berkeley,
who has successfully staged plays
at Harvard University and the
University of California, has been
secured to drill the characters and
manage the show.
