# Encina Holds "At Home."
## 
### 
The semi-annual Encina "at
home" held Saturday night was
one of the most successful ever
given by the Encina Club. There
were not as many couples on the
floor as usual, but this made the
dance more enjoyable because it
has generally been too crowded.
Green was the predominating
color in the decorating scheme, and
the large club-room looked excep
tionally well. There was a lattice
work of green tissue paper streamers
overhead, and the walls were decor
ated with this paper in various de
signs, and also palm branches and
other greens. Music was furnished
by a nine-piece orchestra from San
Jose.
