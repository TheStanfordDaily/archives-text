# VETERANS TO RETURN
## CALIFORNIA HAS BRIGHT PROSPECT FOR NEXT SEASON. Nine Men Who Played Saturday Will Be Back Next Fall.â€”Snedigar's Lobs Will Be Felt. 
### 
With the loss of four and possi
bly five of the men who represented
her in Saturday's game, Califor
nia's prospects for a strong team
next year are fairly bright. O. A.
Snedigar, '05, right half-back, L. E.
Stern, '06, right guard, J. 0. Force,
'06, captain and right tackle, P. N.
Gray, '06, left guard, and probably
R. G. Kittrelle, '06, left end, will
not return to college next year. Un
fortunately for the Blue and Gold
these men are all among the strong
est players on the California team.
Snedigar alone was one of the
greatest backs who ever wore a "C,"
and his lobs will be almost irrepar
able. In this year's intercollegiate
game he made California's only
score, and was the only back who
played a consistent game and made
any considerable gains through the
Cardinal line.
Captain Force,Gray,Kittrelle and
Stern are all steady, hard players,
although none of them have ever
shown any exceptionally brilliant
form on the gridiron. Their loss,
however, is serious, since they were
all veterans and their places must
necessarily be filled by new men.
As the nucleus for her next year's
team California will have, then,
barring accidents, six of this year's
defeated varsity and the three sub
stitutes who played in Saturday's
contest. These men are Haffey,
'07, Foster, '07, Bush, '06, Elliott,
'06, captain-elect, Mead, '07, Stow,
'08, Richardson, '08, Sperry, '07,
and Whitman, '07.
At center Haffey will return again
and will undoubtedly play this
position. Foster, who has been a
substitute guard for the past two
seasons, should acceptably fill
Gray's place, while on the other
side of the line Cunha, who played
tackle on the freshman eleven,
should be able to make the place.
Bush, one of this year's tackles,
will return to college, but he will
have to fight hard to win his posi
tion from Stow and Richardson,
both of whom substituted at that
position last Saturday. Captain
Elliott will play one end, and
should Kittrelle return he will hold
down the other. In case he does
not come back to college, either
Zacharias or Jordan, of the '08
freshmen, or O'Connor, of this
year's freshman team, would make
an acceptable substitute.
In the back-field the Blue and
Gold prospects are even brighter.
Whitman will return, and Schaefer,
the brilliant field captain of the '09
freshmen, should eive him a close
fight for his position. Henry, an
other freshman, is also a very fair
quarter and can give a good ac
count of himself. Sperry will be
back to play full, and unless the
class of 1910 brings some star to
California he will hold down that
position. For the halves, Mead of
this year's varsity, Golcher of the
'08 freshmen, and Stanton, '09, are

all fast and brilliant players, and
the light between them should be
very close.
Taking everything into consider
ation, next season's California
team should be similar to the last
one, with clever ends, fast backs
and a mediocre line. The loss of
Snedigar will be felt, but it looks as
though the weak position on all of
California's teams, quarter-back,
will be greatly strengthened.
