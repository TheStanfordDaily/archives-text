Thk Executive Committee of the
Associated Students will probably
consider the action of the Athletic
Committee to-morrow night. A
careful review of the arguments of
both sides of the question should be
made. In the minds of the major
ity, a mistake has undoubtedly been
committed. There are precedents
for the repealing of such actions, —
precedents that are similar in many
ways. The voting of some emblem
should be encouraged, and the Var
sity block "S" should be held out
as a reward of the future. The
mistake that has been made is a
mistake only in point of time.
Boating is not ready for the Var
sity "S." That it will reach this
level in the future is undoubted.
The question of time rests largely
with the student body, and the Ex
ecutive Committee as its repre
sentative. Their duty is not to try
to overcome this task by sanction
ing the granting of the " 8," for
this is an undesirable short-cut.
This would be putting the cart
before the horse, for after giv
ing the "S" the student body
would have to educate the boating
men up to its standard by taking
hold of the sport and getting coaches
and a trainer, and other factors
necessary to success. It seems more
logical that the student body en
deavor to bring about condi
tions first. They should take the
Boat Club in hand and help them
out with their debt, engage their
coach, provide their trainer, and
otherwise encourage the sport.
Then, if the results justify the
action, the Varsity "8" should be
granted. Until then, however, some
other emblem ought to be granted
for the deserving work they have
done. But the time is not ripe at
present for granting the "8," and
the Varsity emblem must not be
cheapened.
