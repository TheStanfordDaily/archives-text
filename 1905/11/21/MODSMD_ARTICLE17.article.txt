# Majestic Theatre.

"The Light Eternal" sti 11 con
tinues to break the record at the
Majestic. The sale of seats has

been enormous, and crowds have
been turned away from every per
formance. Ashton Stevens says it
is the greatest success since "Miz
pah," and Peter Robertson wrote
that no more beautiful effect has
ever been seen in San Francisco
than that of the great flaming
Miracle Cross at the end of the
fourth act of this play. The beau
tiful stage pictures have never been
surpassed in any dramatic produc
tion made on the Coast.
The play has already been trans
lated into Spanish, and will be pro
duced in the City of Mexico during
Christmas week. It has become a
sensation, and will be taken to
New York after the run here.
Santa Clara College has felt much
pride in this play, written by one
of her own students, and performed
first in her own college theatre. All
of the graduates from that col
lege in this vicinity, as well as
those now in its classes, have been
to see performances of the picce.
Father Gleason and the other mem
bers of the college faculty saw it
from a box at the Majestic,â€”an af
fair most unprecedented, as they
have not been to the theatre for
years. The play has made a sen
sation.
