# BOAT CLUB RENEWS NOTE.
## Oarsmen Pay Off a Third of Debt. No Fall Training. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Stanford Boat Club has decided
that $200 of the note held by the
Bank of Palo Alto should be paid
off, and a new note of $400 be
signed for the amount remaining
to be paid.
The new note will run six months.
This payment of one-third of the
original debt leaves the club with
about twenty-five dollars in the
treasury. There is still forty-five
dollars due the oarsmen from the
English Club, this being a part of
the surplus from "Every Man in
His Humor," the play given last
semester by that organization.
The boating men have definitely
decided to have no fall training
this semester. The last shipment
of oars from Cornell University,
which were ordered during the
summer, has not arrived, and this
fact together with the lack of water
in Lake Lagunita make√ü regular
fall training impossible.
