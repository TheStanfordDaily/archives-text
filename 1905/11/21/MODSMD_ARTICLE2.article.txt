# Knibbs and Griffin Will Not Return.
## 
### 
Coaches Knibbs and Griffin will
not return to California next year,
in spite of the flattering offers
which they have received. Before
that, win or lose, they would not
return to the State University for
another season. Dr. Griffin desires
to practice, and Knibbs has a good
business opening of which he in
tends to avail himself. Both of
the coaches left, for the East on
Wednesday morning.
