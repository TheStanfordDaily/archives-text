# Few "Quad" Assessments Paid.
## 
### 
The 1907 Quad assessments are
being paid very slowly, and Man
ager J. F. Brennan announces that
Friday, December 15th, will be the
last day for paying them. Up to
the present time only about one
tenth of the members of the Junior
class have paid their assessment.
