# MICHIGANS MAY PLAY INDIANS
## Arrangements Being Made for a Game in Pasadena New Year's Day. 
### 
Should the University of Michi
gan football team win the cham
pionship of the Middle West by
defeating Chicago next Saturday,
they will come to the Coast and
play on New Year's day in South
ern California. The management
in charge of the Tournament of
Roses is arranging for a game to
be played in Pasadena with the
Sherman Indians as Michigan's
probable opponents.
This will be the second trip that
Yost's men have made to the Coast.
On New Year's day 1901 they de
feated the Stanford Varsity in
Pasadena by a score of 49 to 0.
This year Michigan has one of the
strongest teams in her history, and
if this game is played it will give
an excellent opportunity for com
parison between the champions of
the Middle West and the Stanford
and California varsities.
