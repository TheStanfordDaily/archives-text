# Punting Cup Not Yet Awarded.
## 
### 
The punting cup offered by the
Quadrangle Club at the beginning
of the football season will not be
awarded until Coach Lanagan re
turns from the East. The club
left the awarding of the cup in the
hands of Lanagan and Bansbach,
but the head coach left so soon
after the game that any award at
that time was impossible. The cup
was won last year by W. H. Dole,
ex-'O5. This year the three prin
cipal candidates for the prize are
D. P. Crawford,'o9, G. E. Dole, '07,
and K. L. Fenton, '08. All of
these men did the punting for the
Varsity at different times during
the season, while Crawford kicked
in the California game.
