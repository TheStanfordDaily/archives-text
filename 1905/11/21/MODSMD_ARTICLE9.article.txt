# MAY NOT BUILD TRACK
## TRAINING-HOUSE CORPORATION TO POSTPONE WORK. Organization Holds Informal Meeting and Presents Gift to Architect Wing in Token of Services. 
### 
The members of the Training
House Corporation were entertained
at the residence of Dr. F. Angell at
an informal meeting recently,
when the future planß of the organ
ization were discussed. Professor
C. B. Wing was presented with a
fine shot-gun by the Corporation
in recognition of his services in de
signing the new football field.
The sentiment of the members
seems to be that no more building
should be undertaken on the new
athletic field for at least a year.
It is very probable that the Cor
poration will not build the pro
posed new track this year, although
the grounds will be graded by Con
tractor Steve Anderson, of Palo
Alto, as soon as the rains have set
in and the ground has become soft
ened. The new baseball field and
bleachers may possibly be erected
before next spring, but in case this
is not done the old field will be
used again.
In paying the bills for the new
football field, the Training House
Corporation has borrowed $3,500
from the Bank of Palo Alto, and
this loan has enabled it to clear up
all outstanding debts. The organ
ization doubts the wisdom of bor
rowing the $5,000 or more neces
sary to complete the track before
next spring. If the track should
be constructed, it could not be put
in first-class shape before the meet.
The oid track will probably be
used for the intercollegiate meet
next spring. If this is done, the
Training House Corporation will
have two years in which to com
plete a track before the next big
meet on the Stanford campus. Al
though the Corporation has not
acted officially upon the matter, it
seems very probable that the new
track will not be built this year.
However, the severity of the season
will in a large measure determine
the question. With the grading
completed, the bleachers can be
erected upon short notice, if it be
comes necessary.
