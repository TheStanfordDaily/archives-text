SEASONABLE SUITS
You need something more than
light summer clothes these crisp
mornings. Better come in here
and let us lit you out with a
seasonable fall suit and may be
a top coat too. We're showing
some beautiful things this year,
all the new styles from Schloss
Bros. & C0.,-of Baltimore, the
'Quality Makers."
Prices run from $12.50 to $25,
with a big variety to choose
from. Come in and see how you
like them.
We have everything else by way
of smart furnishings, too.
