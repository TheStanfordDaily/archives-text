## MOVEMENT TO ESTABLISH COOPERATIVE SYSTEM. Project, Backed by Business Men of Palo Alto and Graduates, to Favor Students. 
### 
As a result of the excessive
charges made by the busmen and
liverymen of Palo Alto on the day
of the big game, and of the unsatis
factory service afforded students
upon special occasions, a number
of the leading citizens of Palo Alto,
together with several prominent
graduates, are seriously considering
the plan of establishing a students'
cooperative stable. F. C. Thiele
is one of the promoters, and it is
chiefly through his efforts that the
idea was originated and that steps
are now being taken to work out
the plans by which the enterprise
is to be run.
As soon as some definite plan is
decided upon those interested in the
movement will hold a meeting and
take the necessary steps in putting
it in operation. Speaking of the
project to-day, Thiele said that a
stock company will probably be
organized, and students who would
derive a benefit from such an en
terprise will be encouraged to hold
stock in the company. These stu
dents, together with the large
stockholders, will receive the divi
dends arising from the project if it
proves to be a success, but aside
from that will enjoy no privileges
but those extended to all patrons.
A uniform rate will prevail at all
times for all people. Thiele said
that the present rates charged by
the livery and bus men will be cut
in half by the new enterprise.
Thiele. will subscribe for $1000
worth of stock and is very enthusi
astic over the present prospects.
It is the intention of those be
hind the movement to run a riding
academy in connection with the
livery stables. The fine country
roads and the drives of the Univer
sity afford ample opportunity for
exercise on horseback, which would
be taken advantage of by many
students, residents of Palo Alto, and
visitors to Stanford, if means were
but offered. As the rates of the co
operative company which is
planned would be very reasonable,
it may be expected that many per
sons would take up riding, so that
a riding academy run in connection
with livery stables would pay.
A large lot between the tracks of
the Southern Pacific Company and
the County road is being considered
as a site for the riding academy
and stables.
