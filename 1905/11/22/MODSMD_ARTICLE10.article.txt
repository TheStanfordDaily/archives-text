### 
The Columbia Park Boys' Club
of San Francisco have prepared an
interesting program for Friday eve
ning in Assembly Hall. The pro
gram is a varied one of twelve
numbers, which include the musi
cal selections, acrobatic stunts,
humorous skits, a short farce, and
other entertaing features developed
in the work of the club.
Major Sidney S. Peixotto, found
er and head worker of the club, di
rects the program and participates
in several of the more diffi
cult acts. Another unusual ar
rangement introduced by the club
is that every act is timed, so that
each one has a limited period in
which to be performed.
