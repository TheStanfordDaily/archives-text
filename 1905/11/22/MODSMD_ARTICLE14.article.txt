An institution as comparatively
new as our University ia certain to
present startling contrasts between
the beauty of its new buildings and
the ugliness of their immediate
surroundings, and only time can
remedy these crudities. Hut our
medieval system of campus light
ing could profitably be dispensed
with without further delay. The
sight of the lamp-lighter with his
ladder making his rounds each
nightmay be decidedly picturesque,
but the feeble illumination which
results can only prove exasper
ating to people who have become
accustomed to adequate street
lights. The lights are not only
wretched substitutes for real street
lamps, but their number is so lim
ited that portions of the campus
are left in utter darkness. The
walks which parallel either side
of University avenue lack even the
scant protection afforded by the
oil lamps to the pedestrians who
have cause to traverse the other
streets of the campus. Bicycle
riders frequent these walks, and the
unwary traveler on foot is in con
stant danger of being run down by
the wheelmen, who do not carry
lamps on their wheels.
The generous illumination on
the night of the football game, as
grateful as it was unexpected,
showed in some small degree the
advantages which will come from
providing suitable lighting facili
ties for the whole campus.
