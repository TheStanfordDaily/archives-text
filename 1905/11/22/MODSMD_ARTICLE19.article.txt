# FRESHMAN TRACK MEET.
## Stanford Will Have Strong Team to Contest with California's First-Year Men. 
### 
Since Saturday's field meet the
number of men out for fall train
ing has naturally fallen off. How
ever, there are still enough men out
every afternoon to keep Trainer
Moulton buwy for a couple of hours.
it is probable that the Freshmen
will be more interested in track this
year than ever before, as the first
intercollegiate Freshman track
meet will be held next spring.
When the intercollegiate athletic
committee met last spring an in
tercollegiate Freshman baseball
game was discussed, but the com
mittee rejected this proposition and
instead sanctioned a Freshman
track meet. Manager Barrett
states that definite plans have been
made for this meet, and it will be
held two weeks before the regular
intercollegiate field meet.
From the showing made by the
Freshmen in Saturday's meet it is
safe to say that Stanford will have
a good chance of winning the first
track meet. Up to date little is
known of California's new track
material. F. Q. Stanton, who
played right half on the Freshman
football team, is probably the best
known track athlete who entered
California this year. He has done
fast time in Southern California in
the 440 and half-mile, but Stanford
has one or two new men whose
records compare favorably with
Stanton's.
D. P. Crawford, '09, has been out
for the past few afternoons practic
ing with the weights, and he has
shown promising form with both
the shot and the hammer. With
W. M. M. Rawles, '09, D. P. Craw
ford, '09, J. G. Fergusson, '09, S.
W. Cooper, '09, A. E. Roth, '09, B.
Stolz, '09, and W. K. Ford, '09, and
other men who are sure to develop
the prospects for a Stanford victory,
next spring are very good.
