# DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC
## TWO COURSES TO BE GIVEN NEXT SEMESTER. Dr. Blodgett Will Instruct Students Music May Be Placed on Footing with Other Departments. 
### 
The introduction of two courses
in music in the University curricu
lum next semester marks the first
advance made to permanently es
tablishing a department of mußic
in the University.
Dr.B.C. Blodgett, who for the past
two years has been the organist in
the Memorial Church, and director
of the choir, will, next semester,
conduct two lecture courses. One
of the courses will be on the history
of music from its origin among the
ancients to its development at the
beginning of the seventeenth cen
tury. The other course will deal
with the interpretation of the works
of the leading composers since the
tenth century. In this connection
the piano will be used a great deal
during the study of Bach, Mozart,
Schubert, Chopin, Wagner and
other of the more famous mu
sicians.
It is possible that the two courses
outlined above may be blended into
one. If so, three hours credit to
wards graduation will be given for
successfully completing the work.
But if the two courses are conduct
ed separately, the work on the his
tory of music will count for one
hour, and two hours will be grant
ed for the course on interpretation.
As the courses are designed for
general students, they will not pre
poße a knowledge of music, it being
the purpose of Dr. Blodgett to meet
the desires of all students interested,
whether musicians or not. In con
nection with the lectures, however,
the classes will be obliged to do a
large amount of collateral reading.
Whether the music department
will be a permanent one is not yet
definitely known, but it is the en
deavor of Dr. Blodgett tomakeitso
on an equal basis with other de
partments of the University. Re
cently a department of music has
been organized at the University of
California, and in various Eastern
colleges it has for many years been
recognized as a legitimate field for
college instruction. For twenty
five years Dr. Blodgett directed the
music courses at Smith College,
Massachussetts.
