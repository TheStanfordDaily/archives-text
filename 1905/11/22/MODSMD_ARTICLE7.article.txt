The expenses incident to the pro
duction of the "Beauty Shop" have
been settled by Manager Barrett.
The financial statement shows that
the student body made a profit of
$211 from the performance. The
totai receipts from the sale of tick
ets were $1061, and the expense of
staging the production was $850.
The unusual expense was due to
the fact that the show was prepared
and produced within two weeks,
which necessitated a greater ex
penditure than would ordinarily
have resulted from the undertaking.
The professional coach was paid
$250 for his services, and several
hundred dollars were paid out for
costumes. Other expensive items
were: Rent of Assembly Hall, $95;
typewriting, $30; scenery, $30;
scene-shifters, $15; and orchestra,
$15.
