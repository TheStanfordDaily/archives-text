The second handicap tournament
for the possession of the valuable
trophy offered last year by F.

place Thanksgiving Day on the
Encina courts. This tournament
is open to all students registered in
the University, to all members of
the faculty, and to those who have
graduated and are still in the com
munity.
This handicap contest is held
every year in order to stimulate in
terest in tennis, and the Tennis
Club wishes all players who will
be on the campus Thanksgiving
Day to take part in the tourna
ment. Owing to the number of
players who turned out for the in
terclass try-ouU the entry list
should be large, and all contestants
will be placed upon as equal a foot
ing as possible by the handicap com
mittee.
The silver cup, the prize for the
winner, was won last year by L. R.
Gay, '08. This trophy must be won
three times to become the perma
nent possession of any player, each
winner having his name engraved
upon it and retaining possession
for one year. An entrance fee of
fifty cents will be charged to cover
the expense of holding the tourna
ment.
The Women's Athletic Associa
tion is considering the advisability
of buying a cup to be offered as a
prize for a women's tournament
which will be held on the Roble
courts the same day as the men's
contest.
