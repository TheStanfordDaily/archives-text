Mr. E. A. Cunha,
President Associated Students
of Stanford University.
Dear Sir: I wish to thank the Exec
utive Committee, and through them
the Associated Students of the Uni
versity, for the gold watch presented
to me last Thursday evening. I
prize the gift not only for its in
trinsic value but aiso as a reminder
of the kindly spirit that prompted
the giving.
The little I have been able to do
for the Associated Students was only
made possible by the wise policy,
started some years ago, of creating
and maintaining the "Training
House Fund," and to the Associated
Students of past years and the
Training House Corporation belong
the larger share of credit for the
results obtained.
Sincerely yours,
Chas. B. Wing.
