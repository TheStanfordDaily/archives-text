# GOLF PLAYERS MEET
## COMMITTEE IS APPOINTED TO SELECT LINKS. Will Consult Treasurer Lathrop on His Return and Decide Rental. 
### 
A meeting of golf enthusiasts
was held this afternoon, and the
reorganization of the Golf Club
discussed. A committee composed
of Rev. D. Charles Gardner, Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough, and R.
Hornby, '07, was appointed to in
vestigate suitable sites for golf
links, and to confer with Treasurer
C. G. Lathrop on his return in re
gard to rental. Until the report of
this committee is made, which will
be within a fortnight, no election
of officers will take place.
The most important question be
fore the club at present is the se
lection and acquisition of grounds.
As the tract of land where the
links were formerly yields a large
crop, the rent would, in all prob
ability, be high. Consequently the
advisability of looking over the
tract just beyond Stanford Field
was talked of, and the committee
will accordingly examine it, and
consult Mr. Lathrop as to the pos
sibility of using these grounds.
This portion of the estate is not
very productive, and the expense
of renting it would probably be
low.
Although this land, should it be
acquired, is not as picturesque as
the old links, there are many other
advantages in which the former
grounds were lacking. One im
provement would be the proximity
of water, which could easily be
piped from the new Gymnasium.
The greens could then be kept in
perfect condition.
The dues of the club will not be
high, and should the club have a
large membership they will be very
low. Until the committee's report
is in, however, no definite figure
can be named. The committee is
empowered to call a meeting of the
club at any time, and another
meeting will probably take place
soon after Treasurer Lathrop re
turns, when officers for the club
will be elected.
