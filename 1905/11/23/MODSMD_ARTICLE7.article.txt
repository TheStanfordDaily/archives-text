# BOYS' CLUB TO-MORROW
## ORGANIZATION WILL APPEAR IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Columbia Park Boys Will Give an Entertaining: Program Before University Audience. 
### 
To-morrow evening the Colum
bia Park Boys' Club of San Fran
cisco will present an attractive and
instructive program in Assembly
Hall.
The memberB of the club are not
young, inexperienced actors in this
line, but clever performers of ex
perience and reputation. The or
ganization has done excellent work
and has presented very entertain
ing features ever since its forma
tion fifteen years ago.
The program prepared for to
morrow evening's entertainment is
an exceedingly rangy one, and in
cludes numbers illustrative of the
work done by the club along all
lines.
Twelve different numbers in all
will be rendered in Assembly Hall.
The military band of the club,
composed of thirty boys, will begin
the entertainment at 8:15 with
three selections by well known
composers. A gymnastic stunt
known as the "Lightning Pyramid
Act," by eighteen members under
direction of the physical instructor,
Lehlitter, will be presented next.
This is said to be a very praise
worthy act, and hardly to be ex
pected of such young gymnasts.
A complicated dance by one of
the members, followed by several
clever dramatic specialties, are next
on the program. Further selec
tions by the band, solos, sextettes,
and comical negro acts will follow,
and the performance will be con
cluded by a farce, entitled "Rosie,
the Girl from Paris," in which ten
of the boys take part. This farce
has been well received everywhere,
and has been presented at more
than one hundred different perform
ances.
The whole program should prove
enjoyable because of the high cIhbs
of work presented by the boys in
all their acts, and it should be
doubly interesting because it illus
trates what results can be achieved
among the ordinarily neglected
youth of the land under such moral
training and development as the
club is designed to give.
Tickets for the entertainment
are on sale at the campus book
store and at the University Drug
Company in Palo Alto. Prices are
twenty-five and thirty-five cents.
A telegram received at 9 o'clock
this evening states that the Columbia
Park Boys' Club will not give their
entertainment in Assembly Hall Fri
day evening, account of the weather.
