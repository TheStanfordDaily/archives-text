# ATTACK ON MICHIGAN
## DR. JORDAN QUOTED EXTENSIVELY IN THE ARTICLE. Athletes Decried for Professionalism and Authorities Scored for Existing Conditions. 
### 
In the current numberof Collier's
Weekly appears an article on the
athletic conditions at the Univer
sity of Michigan. The article is
one of a series of four by D. S. Jor
dan, entitled "Buying Football
Victories," which attack the rot
tenness of athletics at the great
Middle Western universities.
The article is especially interest
ing to Stanford, as the principal
statement advanced to support the
charges made against Yost is that
of President Jordan made some
years ago,after Yost had coached the
Stanford Varsity and had gone
back to Michigan. The charges
aroused a storm of disapprobation
at that university, and Dr. Jordan
was condemned by professors and
students alike.
The statements by Jordan con
cern themselves chiefly with the
cases of Gregory and Heston, who
it is said were induced to go back
to Michigan, Gregory after flunk
ing out of Stanford, and Heston on
preparing to enter here. Dr. Jor
dan sums up his opinion of Yost
and the Yost methods in the state
ment, "All of us who have had
Yost or Yost-like men about are
not to be.counted as sinless."
