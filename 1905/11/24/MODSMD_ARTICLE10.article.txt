# WILL OPEN NEW TRACT
## BUILDING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE LESS STRICT. Larger Lots Will Be Leased in New Tract South of Campus. 
### 
There is a project on foot to open
up, in the near future, the tract be
tween College Terrace and Palo
Alto avenue in the recent addition
to the residence section of the cam
pus. The land has been already
surveyed, and when opened the re
quirements imposed at present on
prospective builders will probably
be made less strict.
The tract just subdivided is be
tween the foothills and the proposed
extension of Alvarado row. The
southern boundary is Palo Alto
avenue, an extension of the road to
Frenchman's Lake. The land is
cut up into quarter-acre lots, which
can be leased for ten years. A fac
ulty member intending to build is
required to guarantee the erection
of a residence to cost $4000, while
an outsider must guarantee a $6000
house. In the new tract the lots
will probably be leased in larger
subdivisions, of an acre or more.
These changes, together with a
lessening of building require
ments imposed on outsiders, will
enable families to settle nearer the
University, and to erect smaller
dwellings.
Upon the construction of the
electric road the general plan of the
streets and avenues in the new ad
dition will be changed also. The
survey for the electric line lies be
tween Lasuen street,as it is extended
toward College Terrace, and the
first range of foothills. This will
bisect the line of lots west of Lasuen
street as it is now ex tended. This will
necessitate the shifting of one or
two of the streets as at present
planned.
As yet nothing definite has been
done toward opening up this land,
but it is expected that such a step
will be taken.
