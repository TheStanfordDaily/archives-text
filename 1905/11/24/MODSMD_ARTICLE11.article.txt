# May Row at Seattle.

A proposal has been received by
Manager Barrett from the Univer
sity of Washington to hold the
intercollegiate contest between
Stanford and California on Lake
Washington next spring. The
University of Washington would
then have an opportunity to meet
the crews of both universities.
Lake Washington is perhaps the
best rowing site on the Coast.
San Diego is also being con
sidered as a possible place at which
to hold the final regatta. E. A.
Luce, '05, is agitating the proposal
in San Diego, and writes that the
Rowing Club of the southern city
is very anxious to take up the prop
osition, even to the extent of giv
ing financial aid.
