The members of the Athletic
Committee are to be commended
for their expressed disposition to
reconsider their hasty action of last
week. Their action last night was
in a large measure the reflection of
the student opinion which regards
the block "S" as our most sacred
insignia, to be bestowed only after
the gravest deliberation. Owing to
its infrequent meetings the under
graduates fhave had little oppor
tunity to acquaint themselves with
the duties of the Athletic Commit
tee, but the work of that body in
the past has been uniformly wiße,
and the present committee cannot
afford to jeopardize this good repu
tation by any ill-advis«d action.
It is generally conceded that the
student body must extend its un
qualified financial and moral sup
port to boating if the Varsity em
blem is granted to that sport, but
our ability to do this at the pres
ent time is a matter of grave doubt.
The whole question was discussed
at length by the Executive Com
mittee at its last meeting, and the
men who are the best informed in
regard to the fiscal condition of the
Associated Students were a unit in
declaring that Buch support cannot
be extended at this time without
danger of incurring liabilities
which we can ill afford. It is pleas
ing to note in this connection that
the strongest opponents of the
scheme to grant Varsity "S"s to
the crew are animated purely by a
regard for the sacrednessof the em
blem, and not by any desire to in
jure boating.
