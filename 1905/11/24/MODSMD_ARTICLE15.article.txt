# HARVARD-YALE GAME.
## Captain Hurley's Injuries Have Decreased Harvard's Chances of Winning. 
### 
The annual contest be
tween Harvard ana Yale will take
place to-morrow afternoon at Cam
bridge, Mass.
Yale's goal-line has not been
crossed this season, while Harvard
was scored on by several minor
colleges, and defeated by Pennsyl
vania by a score of 12-6. Last
Saturday Yale defeated Princeton
23-4. If preliminary scores count
for anything, Yale will have little
difficully in vanquishing Harvard
to-morrow. Harvard's chances
were decreased considerably several
days ago when Captain Hurley
received a blow on the head in
scrimmage work, which has neces
sitated his retirement from the
game this week, and may result in
his absence from the Harvard line
up to-morrow.
