# WILL NOT PLAY AT SAN JOSE.
## Basket-ball Men Have Date Cancelled for Second Time. 
### 
The San Jose Young Men's Chris
tian Association has for the second
time cancelled the basket-ball
game which they were to play with
the team from this campus. Ac
cording to the first arrangements,
the game was to have taken place
at San Jose last Saturday night,
but this was cancelled early in the
week and to-morrow night substi
tuted. To-day Manager Edwards
received a letter calling the contest
off indefinitely.
These two failures of the San
Jose association to live up to their
agreements have made no little an
noyance to the coaches here since
they were relying upon games for
both dates in order to get a line on
the men who should be taken to
Stockton the 2d of next month. No
further arrangements for a game
with San Jose will be made.
