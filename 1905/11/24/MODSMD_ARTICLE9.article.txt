# NO DEFINITE ACTION
## ATHLETIC COMMITTEE BARELY HAS QUORUM. Motion Made to Consider Striking Off Boating from List of Sanctioned Sports. 
### 
The Athletic Committee held its
second meeting for this semester
last night. Unfortunately only six
members were present, and the com
mittee did not consider it advisable
to take any definite action on the
important question of granting
Varsity emblems to boating men.
In view of the interest and op
position which their step aroused
in the student body, and on ac
count of the action of the Execu
tive Committee, those present at
last night's meeting decided to
frame a motion which would ex
press their sentiments on the mat
ter. This motion would not only
have the Athletic Committee re
scind its previous action of grant
ing the emblem to the Varsity
crew, but recommends the advisa
bility of striking out boating from
the list of recognized intercollegiate
sports. The exact wording of it as
it was passed last night is as fol
lows:
"That at the next meeting of
this organization it shall consider
the advisability of recommending
to our intercollegiate athletic repre
sentatives that at their next meet
ing with the California representa
tives they be instructed to vote for
the discontinuance of boating as
an intercollegiate sport."
This motion, while it withholds
any definite action until there is a
full attendance of the committee
members, plainly expresses the
feeling of those present at last
night's meeting. The reason for
this sudden change of sentiment
on the part of those present prob
ably lies in the fact that the ma
jority of them are members of the
Executive Committee. At the
meeting of that body Wednesday
night the proposition of taking
boating under the care of the As
sociated Students was informally
discussed, and the committee came
to the conclusion that the finances
were in such a state as to render
the addition of a sport as expen
sive as boating entirely out of the
question.
As the matter stands now boat
ing has been regularly sanctioned
as an intercollegiate sport for at
least three years more, and under
the intercollegiate agreement the
student body should under ordi
nary circumstances take charge of
it. There seems to be a sufficient
precedent for such an action, in the
striking of Freshman intercollegi
ate baseball from the list last year.
The Athletic Committee then
elected R. W. Barrett, '04, J. T.
Nourse, '00, and D. D. Sales, '06,
to serve as an intercollegiate ath
letic committee. These same men
were elected to this position earlier
in the semester by the Executive
Committee, but it was later found
that this body had no jurisdiction
in that matter. Barrett and
Nourse were members of last year's
intercollegiate committee, which

added boating to the list of sports.
The members present at last
night's meeting were E. A. Cunha,
'06, C. A. Beardsley, '06, R. H.
Lachmund, '06, J. C. Macfarland,
'07, E. P. Stott, '07, and Manager
Barrett. The next meeting will be
held after Thanksgiving.
