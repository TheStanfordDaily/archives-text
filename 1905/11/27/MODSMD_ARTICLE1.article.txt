## SEVERAL IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE. Bonnheim Discussion, Freshman-Sophomore Debate and Carnot Try-out Will Be Held Soon. 
### 
As the close of the semester
draws near several events of im
portance in debating circleß will
soon be held. The Bonnheim prize
contest and the Freshman-Sopho
more debate are both scheduled for
the near future.
One week from Friday, on the
evening of December Bth, will be
held the first forensic contest under
the conditions of the offer made to
the students of the University by
Mr. Albert Bonnheim of Sacra
mento. On that date C. L. Greer,
'07, D. M. Greer, '06, J. W. Mott,
'07, and J. E. Stewart, '07, will pre
sent from the platform their ideas
on the subject, "The Ethics of
Monopolistic Control of Industry."
These four men are eligible to enter
the speaking contest, having quali
fied by being awarded cash prizes
by the judges of the Bonnheim
essay contest.
To the man making the most ef
fective discussion of the ethical sub
ject will be awarded an additional
prize of $150 The value of
the prize offered and the fact that
this is the first Bonnheim discus
sion, will undoubtedly arouse much
interest in this contest.
For the first time also this year
the Freshmen and Sophomores
will fight out their annual debate
in the fall semester. On next Mon
day night this debate will be held
in the chapel, and it promises to
be an unusually spirited contest.
Not a Sophomore class has lost
this debate since the '04 team de
feated the men who represented '03.
On the following Saturday night
will occur the preliminary try-out
for the Carnot debating team. Such
a try-out has not been necessary
for several years past, but competi
tion for places on the Carnot team
is so spirited this year that it has
been found necessary to hold more
than one try-out to pick the beßt
men for the team. Fourteen de
baters will enter the preliminary
contest. The five best of these will
enter a later and final debate next
semester with the eight veterans
who are now in college. At this
time the three speakers who will
contest with the California team
for the Carnot medal will be chos
en.
