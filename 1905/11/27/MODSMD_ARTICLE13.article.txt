# TRACK MEET AT CALIFORNIA.
## Seniors Win Contest by Narrow Margin.â€”Many Promising Freshmen Appear at Berkeley. 
### 
Some good Freshman track ma
terial was brought out at the inter
claps fall meet held by the athletes
of the University of California Sat
urday morning. The seniors won
the meet with 27 points, the fresh
men were second with the jun
iors third with 18-J, and the sopho
mores last with 12.
The distances were shortened,and
as the men have not done a great
deal of training the time was not
fast. Many of the regular events
were eliminated altogether, there
being only one hurdle race and one
sprint. A twenty-five lap relay race,
the most exciting event of the day,
was won by the seniors and fresh
men combined, in 22 minutes 6 sec
onds. Crossfield, a freshman, did
0:9.1 in an 80-yard sprint, and he
also won the broad jump at 19
feet 1 inch. Cowles, another fresh
man, took second in the 80-yard
high hurdles, and several other
freshtneq did well in the distance
events. The high jump was a tie
between llickey and Abbott, two
seniors, at 5 feet 7.J inches. Alto
gether the meet was very satisfac
tory and showed that California
has an abundance of track mater
ial in the entering claBS.
