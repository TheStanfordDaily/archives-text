# BEGIN BOATING PRACTICE.
## California Commences Preliminary Work.â€”Will Have New Boathouse. 
### 
The members of the University
of California Boating Association
have begun preliminary practice
in preparation for the interclass
and intercollegiate races which are
to be held next spring. The as
sociation had been occupying tem
porary quarters in a warehouse
situated on the Alameda side of
the San Antonio estuary. These
quarters were merely temporary,
and a movement was put on foot to
provide the association with a
floating boathouse which can be
easily moved from place to place.
The interclass races are to be
held in March, and immediately
after their completion a coach will
be engaged to prepare the varsity
crew for the intercollegiate races
with Washington and Stanford,
which will take place next April
on Richardson's Hay in Sausalito.
