# STOTT ELECTED FOOTBALL CAPTAIN
## Popular Quarter-back Receives Unanimous Vote of Victorious Team. 
### 
E. P. Stott, '07, was unani
mously elected football captain
for 1906 last Saturday evening.
The election took place at a
banquet given by Captain
Chalmers, '07, at the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity house to the
members of this year's winning
team.
The newly elected captain is
one of the best quarter-backs
who have ever handled a Stan
ford football team. In his fresh
man year Stott was captain
and quarter-back of his class
team, which defeated the 1907
California eleven by a score of
12-0. His reputation, which
preceded him from Portland,
Ore., was sustained. Last year
he was substitute Varsity quar
ter-back and went into the game
after Bansbach, '05,was injured.
He retained bis position easily
this year and won additional
laurels as a field general. He
was selected last year by all
football critics of the Pacific
Coast as quarter-back on the
All-Pacific eleven.
Stott won his Varsity U S'' in
baseball last year, playing be
hind the bat. He is a member
of the Athletic Committee.

Stott registers in the Department
of Law and comes from Portland,
Ore. He is a member of the Zeta
Psi fraternity.
With the election of Stott as
leader of the football team next
year, the Class of 1907 received the
unusual distinction of furnishing
two football captains, both of whom
are from Oregon.
The following men were at the

banquet last Saturday evening:
