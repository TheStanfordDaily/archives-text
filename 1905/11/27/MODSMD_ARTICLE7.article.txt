# DR. JORDAN RETURNS
## EXPRESSES OPINION ON FOOTBALL BALL AGITATION. Attended Carnegie Fund Meeting in New York and Visited President Roosevelt. 
### 
President Jordan reached the
campus yesterday, having left
Washington, D. C., for the Coast
on November 22d. The chief ob
ject of his trip East was to attend
the first meeting of the Trustees of
the Carnegie Fund, established for
indigent college professors, held on
the 15th. Dr. Jordan also visited
Washington to confer with Presi
dent Roosevelt on matters relating
to the Alaska Fish Commission.
He delivered two addresses while
on the trip: one at Salt Lake, on
the way to New York, on "The
Call of the Twentieth Century";
the other at Swarthmore College,
on November 18th, on "The Blood
of Nations."
While in Washington, Dr. Jor
dan was present at the conference
between Dr. J. J. White, professor
of surgery at the University of
Pennsylvania, and President Roose
velt, on the football situation, at
which the President expressed his
ideas very strongly. Dr. Jordan
found that the football agitation
was very marked throughout the
East, and has written an article
for Collier's Weekly on the subject,
which will appear shortly. Dr.
Jordan is of the opinion that foot
ball is too valuable a game to lose,
but that it has become subject to
abuses which the college world
ought to be bold enough to over
come. Intercollegiate football on
the Pacific Coast he says has been
remarkably free from crookedness
for the past four years, and shows a
great contrast to Eastern methods.
In reply to a telegram from the
Chicago Tribune this morning, ask
ing for an expression of his ideas
on the present discussion, Dr. Jor
dan telegraphed the following:
"Most football accidents occur in
secondary schools. Football matches
in Buch schools should bÂ« discour
aged. Let the boys play with each
other. The game needs some
changes toward simplicity and re
duction of strain. What changes
will make a better game experts
must decide. The greatest present
evils rest on professionalism, the
playing of outside toughs under ir
responsible coaches, to the end of
victory at any price.
"No man who has not done a
man's work as a student should
play; no one Bhould play in more
than four or five intercollegiate
games in one season; a dirty player
Bhould be permanently ruled off
the field, and college authorities
should meet a gentlemen's agree
ment that each man using the col
lege name is a bona fide student
and an amateur.
"The game with all its faults has
enormous usefulness and should
not be given up without a resolute
effort to clear it from parasites and
abusei." For all these, in the last
analysis, the indifference of college
authorities ia responsible."
