The selection of Stanford's quar
ter-hack as captain of the eleven
for next year is not only the unani
mous selection of the men who
played in the game, but the unani
mous selection of the entire student
body. For the last three years
Stanford has been particularly for
tunate in the leader of her football
team. Not only have they excelled
as players, but they have worked
in harmony with our coaches and
have in each case set an excellent
example for the men of the squad.
The newly elected captain has all
the qualifications of his predecess
ors and is thoroughly adapted to
take up the work where they have
left it. He has the confidence of
the student body and of the team;
as a player, aB a leader, and as a
man who stands for what is high
est in college athletics, the newly
elected captain is a guarantee of
the success of the season of 1906.
