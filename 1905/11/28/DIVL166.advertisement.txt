light summer clothes these crisp
mornings. Better come in here
and let us fit you out with a
seasonable fall suit and may be
a top coat too. We 're showing

all the new styles from Schloss

'Quality Makers."
Prices run from $12.50 to $25,
with a big variety to choose
from. Come in and see how you
like them.
