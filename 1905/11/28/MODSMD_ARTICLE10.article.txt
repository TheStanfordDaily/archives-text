# PROF. M'LEAN RESIGNS
## HEAD OF ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT TO GO TO TORONTO. Will Leave Stanford in January to Take Professsorship in Economics of Commerce and Transportation. 
### 
Professor Simon James McLean,
present head of the Department of
Economics, has tendered his resig
nation and will leave Stanford at
the end of the present semester. He
goes to accept the professorship of
economics of commerce and trans
portation at the UDiversity of To
ronto in Canada.
Professor McLean has been con
templating this step for some time,
as, aside from the fact that the
work at Toronto will be along lines
offering him better opportunities
for advancement, the call from his
alma mater was one which he felt
he could not refuse. Dr. Jordan
has accepted Professor McLean's
resignation and in his letter accept
ing it speaks as follows:
"We recognize your ripe scholar
ship, your high ideals in educa
tion, your calmness of judgment,
and your possession of those traits
of character and thought which
mark the gentleman among other
men. As a teacher in a line of
work so much afflicted by hasty
judgment, by sensationalism and
emotionalism, you have always
held the attitude of a careful and
patient investigator, one of the
most solid and accurate within the
range of my acquaintance."
It is still too early for any defi
nite statement regarding the filling
of Professor McLean's place in the
Department of Economics, as he
will continue in charge of his
classes until the twenty-second of
December.
Professor McLean came to Stan
ford in 1902 from the University
of Arkansas, where he was professor
of economics and sociology. He
took his A. B. at the University of
Toronto in 1884 and his degree of
LL.B. in 1895 from the same uni
versity. The degrees A. M.from
Columbia and Ph.D. from Chicago
came in 1896 and 1897. Professor
McLean is a recognized authority
on the subject of railway rates, and
has been a member of several spe
cial commissions appointed by the
government to investigate condi
tions along this line.
