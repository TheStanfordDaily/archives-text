# New Course to Be Given in Pleading.
## 
### 
There will be a new two-hour
course in the Law department next
semester. It will lie given by
Prof. A. M. Cathcart and is known
as Code Pleading. This course has
never been given before. The only
course now given in pleading is
merely common law pleading. The
hour for this new course has not
been decided, but it will probably
be at 9:15.
