The lengthy letter of the coach
of California's crew on the question
of boating with special reference to
Stanford is welcome to a certain
extent, as supposed to come from a
man who thoroughly knows his
business and whose views are val
uable; but he decidedly overstepped
his limits when he began to make
disparaging remarks about "Stan
ford spirit." The extracts from
his letter to Stanford's manager
which are quoted in this evening's
paper show this coach as a self-ap
pointed critic of Stanford, a posi
tion which it is difficult to find the
slightest ground for his occupying.
Without a knowledge of the exist
ing conditions at Stanford, Mr. Gar
nett starts to work to upbraid Stan
ford, without the slightest license.
If Mr. Garnet can offer any sensi
ble suggestions without throwing
mud, they will be welcome; but if
he cannot confine himself to condi
tions that he knows something of, it
would be wiser for him to keep still.
