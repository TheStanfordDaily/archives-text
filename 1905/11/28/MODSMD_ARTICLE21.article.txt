# STONE-MASON INJURED
## D. MONROE SUFFERS SEVERE ELECTRICAL SHOCK. Falls from Top of New Machine Shop and Grasps Live Wire Carrying Twenty-three Hundred Volts. 
### 
D. Monroe, of Palo Alto, a stone
mason employed on the new addi
tion to the machine shop, had a
narrow escape from death this
morning. Monroe was walking'
around the narrow strip of rough;
stone and plaster which tops the:
unfinished walls of the shop, when
his foot slipped on the damp stone j
and he fell heavily against the
side of the telegraph pole which
stands between the machine shop
and the power-house.
Half stunned by his fall and en- j
deavoring to save himself from
striking the ground,Monroe grasped
one of the wires which supply
power to the machine shop. The
wire was uninsulated and a cur
rent of about twenty-three hundred
volts was passing through it at the!
time. As Monroe grasped the wire:
with both hands the full force of;
the current passed through his;
body, and the shock threw him;
heavily across the wall.
The other workmen on the build
ing ran to his assistance and car
ried him into the power-house.
Monroe was unconscious from the
shock and both his hands were
burned to the bone from contact
with the wire, and he was bleeding
profu«ely from numerous cuts and
bruises. The flow of blood was
stopped by rude bandages and by
the application of rope torquinets
to his arms just above the elbows.
Meanwhile Dr. Williams of Palo
Alto had been hastily summoned
and he carried the injured man to
the Guild Hospital in his buggy.
There, Dr. Reynolds, who was
Monroe's family doctor, took charge
of the case. Monroe had recovered
consciousness, but was very weak
from the loss of blood and a
thorough examination was impossi
ble. He does not seem to have suf
fered any ill effects from the shock
or the fall, however, and his chief
injury was that to his hands, which
were so badly burned that it is
very unlikely that he will recover
the use of them again.
When Monroe fell against the
wire the man in charge of the cur
rent, realizing that something was
wrong with the circuit, immedi
ately shut off the power. This un
doubtedly saved Monroe's life, as
the current was more than enough
to kill any man. The side of the'
building against which Monroe fell
and the floor of the power-house j
were spattered with blood from '
his wounds. Monroe had been em- j
ployed on the building for about:
six weeks. He is employed by the j
McGilvray Stone Company, which 1
has charge of the work.
