# SEEK AMATEUR COACH
## BOATING MEN WISH INSTRUCTOR FOR NEXT SEMESTER. California's Coach Attacks the Stanford Spirit Because of Threatened Annihilation of Boating Contests. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club, looking
forward to the necessity of a coach
for the work of next semester, has
already opened negotiations with
several well-known oarsmen. The
club is attempting to secure some
amateur who has rowed on a var
sity crew in the East, and who will
take a greater interest in a Stan
ford crew than a professional oars
man would.
The action of the Executive Com
mittee threatening to drop rowing
as an intercollegiate sport is the
subject of a letter from E. M. Gar
nett, head-coach of the crew at
California, to R. W. Barrett, '04,
Stanford's student body manager.
Garnett attacks any such action
and makes many arguments in
favor of rowing as an intercollegi
ate sport. He says in part:
"I am writing to you as one
friend of boating to another both
of whom are appreciative of the ad
vantage the sport possesses to the
universities, to the state, and to
the cause of symmetrical physical,
mental and moral development.
"If this last mentioned quality is
an educational ideal at Stanford
then the dropping of intercollegi
ate rowing, or even apathy in the
cause thereof, is at least illogical,
if not insane.
"As I told you, my stay here is
still uncertain. But while I remain
I wish to do all in my power to as
sist boating to the place it deserves
in the ranks of athletics.
"To any rational mind such a
lame and impotent conclusion as
you propose to the heroic story of
rowing at Stanford and California
is certainly a severe criticism of the
'Stanford spirit,'is it not? The ob
stacles in your path, the fruition of
the hopes of the true but meagre
minority, who surely deserve their
reward, should be easily surrmount
ed by a 'Stanford spirit' worthy of
the name. A few thousand dollars
would enable you to improve the
access to the boat house, or to
build a new one and make its sur
roundings comparatively attract
iveâ€”to say nothing of the eights
and all they would mean to the
most beautiful spectacle in the
whole world of intercollegiate ath
letics. The proper spirit once
aroused would soon find means to
enlarge Lake Lagunita sufficient
ly for effective practice.
"If all the graduates atul under
graduates are unequal to the task
of contributing an average of $1.00
a piece to 60 excellent a cause, there
must be something wrong with
their sense of the fitness of things.
"If an article or a talk from me
would be an acceptable aid to
whatever efforts you wish to make
in the matter, just touch the button
and I will spout at your conven
ience. In fact, lam so firmly con
vinced of the benefits of intercol
legiate rowing that if circumstances
and the Berkeleyites would permit,

I would volunteer to coach Stan
ford if only to encourage that
lagging 'Stanford spirit.'
"Just now, however, your most
urgent need seems to be it her the
necessary funds or else the realiza
tion of all intercollegiate rowing
will mean to the college and to the
state. Scientific rowing has the
best qualities of football, and many
others that no form of athletics
possesses. As I had occasion to
say some time ago to a Stanford
alumnus, 'Whenever at the sight of
a smoothly, beautifully rowing
eight an intelligent person invol
untarily ejaculates 'pretty work'
and experiences that healthful
glow of admiration so beneficial to
the whole physical, mental and
moral being, that person takes a
step, however small, toward higher
civilization.' "
