### 
Miss Anna Strunsky, ex-'OO, and
Miss liose Strunsky, '06, will leave
to-morrow morning from San Fran
cisco for Geneva, Switzerland, the
headquarters of the Russian revo
lutionists, where they will join the
revolutionists in their fight against
the Czar. The young ladies were
banqueted in San Francisco last
Saturday evening by a number of
men and women, prominent among
them being Jack London.
Miss Anna Strunsky is a novelist
of considerable note. She is, the
joint author with Jack London of
the Wace Hampton Letters, and
has been associated with Gellet
Burgess and other writers in San
Francisco. She has lectured before
clubs throughout the United States.
The young ladies will receive in
structions at Geneva and will prob
ably proceed to Russia, a hazard
ous undertaking considering the
fact that spies have reported the
elder Miss Strunsky to the govern
ment. Miss Anna Strunsky will
have charge of the socialistic press
and will continue her work in con
nection with the other Russian
revolutionists in Geneva.
