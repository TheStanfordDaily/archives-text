# ATHLETICS ON COAST
## PAINE PRAISES ABSENCE OF GRAFT IN CALIFORNIA. Associate Editor of "Outing" Review at Length the Relations of Stanford and California. 
### 
In the current issue of the Out
ing Magazine, Ralph I). Paine has
an article on "Pacific Coaßt Ath
letics,'' in his department, "The
School and College World." Un
fortunately Paine says very little
concerning the relative strength of
football 011 the Pacific Coast and
in the East, as his remarks are di
rected chiefly toward the attitude
of the Stanford and California
faculties toward the game of foot
ball itself ;
He speaks with high praise of
the clean athletic relations between
the two universities, and points out
that Coast football is practically
free from the graft and trickery
which has degraded the game to its
present level in the East and Mid
dle West. Regarding our relations
with California Mr. Paine says:
"California and Stanford have had
their eligibility troubles, but at
present their mutual relations are
clean and honorable, and they do
not call each other cheats and liars,
as is the custom among some an
cient and distinguished seats of
learning far to the eastward."
Mr. Paine then goes on to say
that he found the agitation for rad
ical reforms in the game to be even
stronger on the Coast than in the
East. He quotes talks which he
had with Presidents Jordan and
Wheeler, and with Dr. Frank An
gell, all condemning the game as it
ia played to day, and urging the
Rules Committee to take action.
Moreover, he considers that this
agitation on the Coast is deserving
of especial attention, as the game
here is freed from many of its at
tendant evils, such as the practice
of recruiting, and of monopolizing
all the student's time. Speaking of
this, Paine says:"The shortened
schedule with only one 'big game'
permits the Western football man
to play and study at the same
time. Jt remains, therefore, that on
the Pacific Coast the problem is
stripped of its attendant evils, and
is judged on its merits as a game.
And as a game it is condemned in
most emphatic fashion."
