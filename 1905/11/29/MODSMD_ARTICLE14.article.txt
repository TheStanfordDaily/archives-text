Skvkral note-hooks have heen
lost from time to time from the li
brary and window-sills about the
quad. It is only reasonable to sup
pose the thieves are students in
attendance at the University, for
the books have generally been taken
just before an examination. The
supposition that these books have
been taken by mistake is proven
false by the fact that the number
missing is large. The persons who
are appropriating these books belong
to the meanest class of sneak thieves,
and if detected they should be
drummed off the campus.
