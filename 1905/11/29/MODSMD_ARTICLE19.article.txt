IN "THE C0I,I.K<;E WIDOW," COMINU TO Til E COT.OMBIA THEATRE, SAN FRANCISCO
(ieorge Ade, whose famous "Fables in Slang" gave him :i unique distinction,
I fulfilled the measure of his promise when he wrote "The College \\ idow." that
I charming comedy of American life which will be seen for the first time in San
!' Francisco at the Columbia Theatre, beginning next Monday.
To lie sure "The Countv Chairman" eliminated dispute regarding Mr. Ade's
ability to construct satisfying plays, but "The College Widow" is so pre-eminently
the comedy of years that Mr. Ade's claim to the top rung of the ladder of fame as
a playwright is beyond contravention. With Mr. Ade's ideas fully met in the
liberal and painstaking producing policy that marks all the efforts of Henry \\ .
Savage, "The College Widow" becomes at once the most popular and widely dis
missed plav of the dav. Correct!v set, adequately cast, and with each and every
detail as carefully looked after as in the New York and Chicago presentation,
j "The College Widow" comes to San Francisco for a ratification of the thus far in-
I variable verdict, —"The best ever."
