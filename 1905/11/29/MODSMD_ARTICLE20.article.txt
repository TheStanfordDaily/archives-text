In order to stimulate interest in !
the game, and to aid in developing
better players for the game, ar
rangements are being made with
\V. E. Nevill of the Mechanics'j
Institute Chess Club of San Fran
cisco, for a series of exhibition j
games under the auspices of the;
club. This would be verybenefi-l
cial, as Mr. Nevill is one of the best
players on the Pacific Coast. He
is a native of Victoria, British Co
lumbia, but since coming to San
Francisco twelve years ago he has!
been well known in chess circles.'
For several years he has carried off
first honors in the annual tourna-j
ment of the Mechanics' Institute
Club.
Some years Mr. Nevill took
up the art of playing simultaneous
games of chess, and at present he
has no rival on the Coast in this'
department of the game.
