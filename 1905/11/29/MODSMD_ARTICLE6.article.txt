The completion of the football
stands and the training-house,
; along with the promise of things to
I he for other academic (though, be it
j noted, purely physical) pastimes,
I should lead us to think somewhat
of the material status of other
forms of university activity, which,
while less spectacular, are no less
important. It does seem a little
out of proportion for a university
community to set aside a score of
thousand dollars to provide oppor
tunities for a tenth or so of its per
sonnel to perform thrilling and
strenuous "stunts" while the re
mainder look on and—root. While
we have not the remotest wish of
contesting their privileges with the
athletes, would it not also be possi
ble to provide a few comforts, con
veniences— necessities, rather —for
the debaters, actors, musicians or
any of the diversions which might
appeal to the interests of any con
siderable number of individuals
forming the University community.
The lack of some such facilities
for practice is perhaps, just at
present, felt in nothing so much as
in the case of the musical organi
zations. This year we have very
good musical clubs; they are going
to take a long trip; they are going
to represent us to a great many
people; yet how little of ourselves
has gone into their training and
enthusiasm! This is not the fault
of the clubs nor is the student body

altogether blameworthy. The mis
fortune is due rather to the lack of
connection between the students
at large and the musical clubs. We
have no musical gridiron; no cosy
training house where the musicians
can get into training for their
events. They are allowed some
room on the quad not already in
use; nobody comes to hear them
practice; there is* no rooting when
they do their work well; there is
likely to be blame when they do it
badly or fail to do it altogether.
Now the number of those who
are musical or who are fond of
music must be as large as the num
ber of those who are athletic.
There can hardly be any question
of the relative value of the gifts
and of the necessity and even
pleasure of keeping them in train
ing. Is there not some way of pro
viding a place where the musicians
can get together regularly and have
their try-outs, hold their events,
have their open and secret prac
tice? A room, at least, all their
own, suitably furnished with a re
spectable piano; with music cases
with a few modern musical periodi
cals perhaps. Some place, in short,
around which the musical interests
of the University could center and
develop, as they are centering and
developing around the athletic
fields.

things, I am, Mr. Editor,
