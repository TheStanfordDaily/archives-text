## CALIFORNIA GRADUATE SAYS STANFORD GETS BEST MEN. Says that Very Cordial Relations Exist Between Stanford Student Body and Secondary Schools. 
### 
A graduate of the University of
California lias written the following
article regarding the action of the
executed committee of the Califor
nia Associated Students prohibit
ing all dual meets between second
ary schools on the Berkeley cam-
P us: -r
"Even with limitations the act
ion of the committee seems to us
unwise. That Stanford has been
more successful in recent years in
attracting promising athletes from
secondary schools has been appar
ent to all interested in intercollegi
ate athletics on the Pacific Coast.
That this was not true in former
yeaya suggests that there must be a
reason for the change. One reason
sufficient in itself to explain such a
change is to be found in the more
cordial relationship which exists
between the student body of Stan
ford and the pupils of the various
high schools scattered throughout
the state. Stanford, not California,
ie the donor of the debating cup for
which teams representing second
ary schools all over the state annu
ally contest at Palo Alto. Stan
ford, rather than California men,
fete, dine and entertain these high
school athletes upon the occasion
of their semiannual field meets or
football games, occasionally even
crossing to Berkeley to meet these
men. The football field and track
at Stanford can be obtained by
high schools at a moment's notice,
and whether in Palo Alto to play
football, contest upon the track, or
debate, the various fraternities and
members of Encina Club see to it
that such visiting teams are royally
entertained.
"There is no intention to accuse
Stanford of resorting to any of the
so-called 'recruiting' practices,
which i_ have recently occasioned
such unfavorable criticism upon
Eastern universities. Undoubted
ly it is somewhat difficult to draw
an exact line between legitimate
and illegitimate devices for attract
ing students who give promise of
developing into athletes to a par
ticular college. No one would con
tend that all means that might be
taken to attract such embryonic
athletes are legitimate. Now should
anyone contend that all means
taken to influence a decision are
legitimate? The attempt to inter
est a high school athlete in a par
ticular university by acquainting
him with its work, and with its
ideals, by extending his acquaint
anceship in its student body, by
showing a certain sympathy and
interest in his work, are not only
legitimate, but proper and desir
able devices to attract him toward
that university. The writer doe√ü
not for a moment believe that Stan
ford has gone beyond this. Nor
would he have California resort to
even one questionable device, if the
price of such honesty meant defeat
in every intercollegiate contest. 1 '
