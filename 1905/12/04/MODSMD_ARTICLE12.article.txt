Thk whole country seems to have
taken up the war against football
as it is played to-day and the indi
cations are that the game will be
abolished, or so greatly modified
that it will become unrecognizable.
There must be cause for this com
motion, for authorities high up
have given their approval, and this
leaves no doubt on this score. But
a large majority of the people who
are raising the hue and cry never
saw-a college football game and are
chronic kicking cranks. Truly
football is no longer a game for
weaklings and babes, but it is
painted in yellow journalism for
worse than it really is, and the
large body of alarmists even en
larges on these pen pictures.
The main argument advanced by
the ordinary person is that the
game is brutal and dangerous to
life. It has already been admitted
that football is not for weaklings.
It has also ceased to be a child's
game, and here is where most of
the injuries occur. Nine-tenths of
the deaths and serious injuries
from football which are reported
every year in enlarged form in the
daily papers, result to players of
high schools, athletic clubs and
small colleges of the rank of a good
high school. It is here that per
sons physically unfit to play are
allowed to take part in the game.
There is no standard of training
and in many cases there is not a
spirit of fair play prevailing. It
is in these lower schools where
the reformers can do their best
work. In the higher colleges the
injuries are comparatively small,
and the lasting injuries are prac
tically nil, at least on this Coast.
The past record of our football men
will justify these statements. The
only noticeable difference between
the football man and the non-par
ticipant is that the former is gen
erally of superior physical build,
partly due to his participation in
the game. That football of the
right kind —and this means clean

football —develops the character,
has generally been accepted. The
intercollegiate record of California
and Stanford during the last few
years shows small opportunity for
the desirability of a change in the
rules. The conditions in the East,
where the prevailing spirit is any
thing to win,the change that is most
desirable is the one of stricter con
trol by the athletic authorities in
the various universities. If they
would cleanse the sport of its rotten
professionalism and instil a spirit
of fair play, they could accomplish
to a large extent the abolishment
of the real evil of the game to-day.
Stanford and California, instead of
being classed with the Eastern col
leges in the way the game is played,
stand out as a goal to be reached
by the colleges, which is possible
without a change in the rules. The
game, as played between the two
big institutions of the state, needs
no change.
