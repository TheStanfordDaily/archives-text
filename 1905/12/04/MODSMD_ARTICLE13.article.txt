# ALUMNI WIDELY DISTRIBUTED.
## Orders for English Club Book Received from All Parts of the World. 
### 
An interesting fact in connection
with the sale of the book published
by the English Club last semester,
entitled "The First Year at Stan
ford," is the widely distributed area
from which alumni have sent in
orders. In advertising their book
the English Club printed circulars
descriptive of its contents and sent
these with order blanks enclosed to
every alumnus whose address was
known.
â–ºStatistics in connection with the
answers to these circulars are inter
esting. Out of one hundred and
fifty mail orders more than a third
were from states and counties far
removed from the Pacific Coast, a
fact which further substantiates the
often repeated . assertion that the
average Stanford students reside
an unusually long distance from
the University. Alumni residents
in twenty-five states other than
California answered the circulars,
and orders were received from all
parts of Europe, Asia and Africa.
TheStanford groupin London have
evidently not forgotten their Alma
Mater, for several orders for the
book came from there. Germany
and France were the other two
European countries reprepented.
Down in the southernmost parts of
Africa theie are live Stanford
people, several orders being received
from the Transvaal. Requests for
the book also came from China,
Japan, Cuba, and the Phillipine
Islands.
This is probably the first publica
tion since the founding of the Uni
versity which has interested the
whole body of alumni in its subject
matter. The opportunity has been
a favorable one for the accumula
tion of facts on the dissemination of
Stanford alumni and the spirit
with which they respond to a call
of this kind.
