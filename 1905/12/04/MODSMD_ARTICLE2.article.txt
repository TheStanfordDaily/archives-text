# DELANO WINS TENNIS
## BECOMES OWNER OF THEILE CUP FOR A YEAR. Judicious Handicapping of the Contestants Results in Many Close and Exciting Matches. 
### 
P. B. Delano, '08, won the an
nual Thanksgiving Day tennis
tournament, which was held on
the Encina courts Thursday and
Friday. Owing to the poor condi
tion of the courts, it was impossible
to start the contest Thursday
morning, and but three matches
were played that afternoon. Fri
day was a perfect day for tennis,
and the matches were rapidly de
cided, the last point being won
about five o'clock.
There were fifteen entries for the
handsome cup offered by Mr.
Theile of Palo Alto, and judicious
handicapping brought out some
very close matches. P. B. Delano,
'08, and J. F. Cassell, '07; G. E.
Dole, '07, and M. C. Burr, '07, were
in the semifinals. Delano and
Dole won their matches and met in
the final round, Delano winning
out after a close contest.
By winning the annual handi
cap tournament, Delano becomes
for one year the possessor of the
silver cup which was played for
last year for the first time. This
trophy must be won three times to
become the permanent property of
any one player. The name of each
winner will be engraved upon the
cup until it is finally won three
times by the same contestant. It
was won last year by L. R. Gay,
'08. The summary is as follows:
Preliminary round —J. F. Cas
sell, '07, defeated Professor C.
