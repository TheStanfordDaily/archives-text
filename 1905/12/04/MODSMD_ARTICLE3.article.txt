# MAY OFFER CLASS TROPHY.
## Alumni Arc Said to Favor Association Football at Stanford. 
### 
The San Francisco morning pa
pers printed a story yesterday
which states that association foot
ball is to be introduced on the
Stanford campus next semester,
and that to that end a committee
of alumni was authorized by the
San Francisco Alumni Association
to complete all necessary arrange
ments for the inauguration of the
new collegiate sport. The Alumni
Committee consists of three mem

hers of the pioneer class, G. E.
Crothers, secretary of the Board of
Trustees, A. B. Rice and O. P. Mor
ton.
The report states that the Stan
ford Club will offer a magnificent
silver cup as an interclass trophy
for a series of games to be played
on the campus next semester. The
report has not been verified, and
until the announcement is made
officially by the Stanford Club the
report will have to be discredited.
