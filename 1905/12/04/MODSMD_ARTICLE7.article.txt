A press dispatch from Chicago
says that Coach Stagg announced
immediately after the game with
the University of Michigan, which
won for his men the championship
of the Middle West, that "as a re
ward for the victory over Michigan
I will take the team to the Pacific
Coast to play the Stanford eleven.
If Stanford refuses to play, a match
will be secured with an athletic
club team."
