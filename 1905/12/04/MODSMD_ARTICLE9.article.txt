# CLASS PLAY TRY-OUT
## SOPHOMORES WILL COMPETE FOR PLACES WEDNESDAY. Coach Will Have Entire Charge of the Selection of the Characters. New System. 
### 
On Wednesday afternoon of this
week Rlrs. J. E. Walker of Berke
ley, who has been engaged to stage
the play which the Sophomores
have chosen to produce next semes
ter, will meet the candidates for
places on the cast for the first time.
All those desiring to try out for
places are expected to be present in
room 214 on the quad at two
o'clock on that day.
Following the custom inaugu
rated by the Class of 1907 in pro
ducing their show, the Sophomore
play committee decided to select
the cast entirely from members of
the class and by a competitive try
out. This decision made, every
thing else now rests in the hands
of the coach. Mrs. Walker only
consented to take charge of the
production under the stipulation
that she should be given absolute
discretion as to what methods
would be employed in picking the
characters. Accordingly, as she
is now planning it, there will be,
at least for a time, two persons
chosen for each part, one to act as
understudy for the other. Mrs.
Walker has tried this system suc
cessfully at Harvard University
and the University of California,
where she has staged student the
atricals.
The principal idea in introduc
ing this system is not so much to
provide a substitute for every char
acter in order to insure the success
of the show, as to make the try-out
as competitive and thorough-going
as possible. The try-out Wednes
day will be but preliminary. The
coach will go over the play with
the candidates and explain the
parts. She will then have each
candidate read selections from the
play and by this test will choose
two people for every character.
This will be as far as the try-out
on Wednesday will go. Final se
lection of the characters will be
made shortly after the regular re
hearsals begin. Both of the candi
dates for each part, will be given a
trial at the lines in regular re
hearsals until the coach can deter
mine which is the best fitted for
the character. The unsuccessful
characters will thereafter be asked
to serve as understudies for the
principals.
"She Stoops to Conquer" presents
a number of interesting parts, and
since a great many have signified
their intention of trying for places
an unusually keen competition is
promised.
