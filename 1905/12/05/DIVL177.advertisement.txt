SEE
better than ever!
Never had particu
:vjS? larly good eyes; but
. since I got glasses
at Osgood & Ball's
it's pleasure to read,
\y write, study, and see
— things generally.
Of many a one this is true. True of
others, that good sight once is poor sight
now. Come here, all classes, and get
bettered vision.
