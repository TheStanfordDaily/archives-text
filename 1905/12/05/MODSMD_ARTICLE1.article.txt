# SOPHS. WIN DEBATE
## FRESHMAN DEBATING TEAM IS DEFEATED IN CONTEST. Shelton, Herron, and Newlands Carry Off Unanimous Decision for Their Class. 
### 
The Sophomore debating team,
composed of W. C. Shelton, W. F.
Herron, and L. Newlands, last
night defeated their Freshman op
ponents, I). E. Mahon, J. M. Polit
zer, and G. B. Busch.
The subject under discussion was,
"Resolved, That the United States
should continue its present policy
of opposing the combinations of
railroads." The winning team up
held the affirmative of the propo
sition.
Shelton opened the debate for
the Sophomores, and in a well-con
structed ten minutes' address, this
being the time allotted to each of
the speakers, he defined the argu
ments which his colleagues would
present. By citing statutes and
quoting authorities, he endeavored
to show that the present policy of
the government was to oppose all
combinations of railroads which
tended to create an unreasonable
restraint of trade.
Mahon, in opening the negative
case, admitted that combinations
in general were injurious, but de
clared that the negative held for a
legalization of policy. Such a sys
tem, he declared, would not only
prevent rates and discriminations,
but would also tend to stimulate a
healthy competition, which would
work entirely for the good of the
patrons of the railroads. On the
other hand, he argued that the pol
icy now in practice, and upheld by
the affirmative, was ineffective and
failed to strike at the root of the
evil.
Herron, the second speaker on
the affirmative, wittily turned the
remarks of the preceding speaker,
and engaged the remainder of his
time in a generalization of the facts
of the case, with the idea of sup
porting his colleague's argument.
Politzer, the next '09 speak
er, declared that the affirmative
erred in their basic assumptions
that the policy of the govern
ment was only to oppose combina
tions which created an unreason
able restraint of trade. By citation
of laws he endeavored to prove
that the affirmative upheld a pol
icy which blindly opposed any and
all tendencies to combination by
railroads, a policy which could not
be construed in any way to be
beneficial.
Newlands, in closing the case for
the Sophomores, followed up the
general trend of argument outlined
by his colleagues, introducing facts
and figures to substantiate their
statements.
The closing speaker of the
Freshmen, Busch, made a powerful
appeal, in an endeavor to turn the
tide for his side. He attacked the
arguments of his opponents with
precision and logic, and exposed
inconsistencies and fallacies in their
contentions. Busch made the best
speech for his side, but the Sopho

mores had their case too well organ
ized to be overthrown.
Shelton, in the three minutes
allotted him for rebuttal, made the
best of his time in summing up the
arguments for his side.
The judges, Professor A. B.
Show of the History department,
Professor S. S. Seward Jr. of the
English department, and Mr. J. E.
McDowell, after brief deliberation,
announced the unanimous decision
for the Sophomore team.
The debate was an unusually in
teresting one, and well argued from
start to finish. The Sophomores
won on a thorough knowledge of
the facts, and a superior discretion,
gained by experience, in attacking
the arguments of their opponents.
