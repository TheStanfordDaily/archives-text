The present agitation for a re
form of football gives the two big
Pacific Coast universities an op
portunity to attain a position in
the intercollegiate athletic affairs
of the country, which has long been
denied them. The arrogant re
striction of athletic boundaries to
the territory east of the Alle
ghenies has but recently been
broken down by the Middle West,
and it was to be expected that the
recognition of the Pacific Slope
would be equally tardy. It is gen
erally agreed that the game of foot
ball as played on this Coast is a
clean sport, totally free from the
professionalism and dirty playing
which have tainted the great game
in other parts of the country, and
the acknowledgment of this fact
must be peculiarly gratifying to
those who have so long deplored
the provincial attitude of so-called
Eastern sporting critics.
The time is now ripe for Stan
ford and California to demand a
representative on the Football
Rules Committee. This body is
anything but representative with
its present personnel, and if the
future of football is to rest in the
hands of a few men this defect
must be remedied. Every college
which plays under the rules adopt
ed by the committee should have
some voice in the deliberations of
its members. The athletic aris
tocracy of the East may have been
based on actual supremacy at one
time, but this condition no longer
prevails, and the West can no
longer be kept from its place at the
top.
