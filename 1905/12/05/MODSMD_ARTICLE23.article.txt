# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS
## PRESIDENTS TO DISCUSS QUESTION OF FOOTBALL REFORM. Stanford's President Expresses His Views on the Agitation Against the Great College Game. 
### 
As yet nothing lias been done
on the Pacific Coast regarding a
change of the rules of football.
President Wheeler of the Univer
sity of California wrote President
Jordan a 6hort time ago concerning
the game, and suggested that the
presidents and the faculty athletic
committees of the University of
California and Stanford meet and
decide upon ways and means to
eliminate the objectionable features
from the game. The letter reached
Dr. Jordan too late to inform the
various members of the Stanford
Faculty Athletic Committee, and
consequently the meeting was post
poned until sometime this week.
President Wheeler is opposed to
the game of football as it stands to
day, likewise President Jordan.
But Dr. Jordan thinks that foot
ball is too valuable a game to
abolish, and his views upon this
point are decided.
President Jordan believes that
it will be possible to have rules
governing the game on the Pacific
Coast independentof the regulations
made by the self-elected rules com
mittee of the East. A suggestion
which they will consider at the
intercollegiate conference this week
is the advisability of appointing a
committee to frame rules to be
used by Stanford and California.
A suggestion which will be con
sidered by the presidents and
committees will be the advisability
of returning to the Rugby game as
originally played.
President Jordan considers the
action of the faculty of the Colum
bia University entirely too hasty.
Instead of assisting in ways and
means for the elimination of the
violent features, the faculty has
forthwith abolished the game.
In an interview to-day, Dr. Jor
dan said:
"The relations of the faculties
should be constructive toward the
game of football. The game must
not be abolished, if it can be im
proved, and the duty of those in
charge is to change the rules to
suit the demand. There ie no rea
son why we cannot have our own
rules on the Pacific Coast.''
