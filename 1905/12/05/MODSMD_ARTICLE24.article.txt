# NOT MANY MEN ON TRACK.
## Trainer Moulton Would Like to Have More Freshmen in Training for Next Spring. 
### 
For the past few days there have
not been as many men out on the
track as usual. This is probably
due to the fact that many of the
athletes are busy preparing for
heir final examinations. How

ever, both Trainer Moulton and
Captain Macfarland are very anx
ious to see more men out for track
work. In speaking of the situation
yesterday afternoon Trainer Moul
ton said that lie realized that the
men were busy with their studies,
but would like to have as many as
possible come out and do light
work the remainder of the semes
ter. He is particularly anxious to
see more Freshmen on the track, as
the first intercollegiate Freshman
track meet will be held next
spring, and "Dad" wants more ma
terial from which to develop a team
to meet California. The weather
is very favorable now for training
and the track is in fair condition,
in spite of the recent rains.
Most of the men who have been
training the past few days are vet
erans of one or more seasons. A.
C. Freeman, '00, who ran a strong
relay in last year's intercollegiate
meet, has been on the track the
last few days doing light work. R.
A. Kocher, '08, one of last year's
point winners in the pole-vault, has
been in training for some weeks
past and yesterday afternoon he
vaulted about ten feet two inches, 1

which is considered a good per
formance at this time. There are
several other members of last year's
team who are working on the
track every afternoon, and they are
all in fir√üt-class condition.
