# RETURNS FROM EAST
## HEAD-COACH LANAGAN, '00, REACHED CAMPUS TO-DAY. Considers Chicago Team the Fastest He Saw While in the East. 
### 
Head-Coach Lanagan, '00, re
turned to the campus to-day from
the East. The first game which he
witnessed was the Yale-Princeton
contest. Before leaving Cambridge,
Mass., he saw the Harvard-Yale
game. At Chicago last Thursday
he saw Michigan go down to de
feat before a team which he con
siders the fastest he saw while
in the East. Michigan, he says,
was outclassed at every point of
the game, and that Chicago was
probably a drop-kick better. He
was one of the linesmen at the
Michigan-Chicago game. He found
no difference in the style of play
in any of the games he witnessed
with that practiced on the Pacific
Coast.
