# LAST ASSEMBLY HELD
## GEN. WOODRUFF GIVES INTERESTING ADDRESS. Preparation and System the Secret of Japan's Success. — Elements of Weakness in U.S. Army Noted. 
### 
The last regular student body
Assembly of the semester took place
at 11:15 to-day in Assembly Hall.
Brigadier General Charles A.
Woodruff of the United States
Army was the speaker, and deliv
ered an address upon the subject of
"Some Military Lessonß of the War
in the Orient." After the address
several selections were rendered by
the Stanford Glee Club.
General Woodruff's address was
an exceptionally interesting one,
both from the many clean-cut
points which it developed and
from the striking delivery of the
speaker. The one great secret of
Japan's success, he said, lay in the
fact that she was fully prepared for
war at the time of the outbreak
of hostilities. Further than this
she "prepared for and conducted
the war on a strictly common sense,
scientific, military, business basis."
Summarizing the situation:
The Japs won constant victories
because:
First. —Throughout the Japanese
army there were preparedness,
trust, confidence and helpfulness.
Second.—Confidence in the Gen
eral Staff, which was not hampered
by orders from Tokio, and hearty
co-operation between it and the of
ficers of the line.
Third. —Everything was subordi
nated to the general good, to the
accomplishment of the object in
view.
Fourth. —An almost perfect mili
tary'information department and
spy system.
Fifth. —An earnest endeavor to
have every rifle in the line of bat
tle.
'"Bixth. —By kindness and prompt
payment for stores and iservices,
the friendship and good will of the
inhabitants in the theatre of war
won.
■ The Russians suffered constant
defeat because:
First. —Throughout their army,
lack of preparation, envy and dis
trust prevailed.
Second. —The efforts of the Gen
eral Staff were hampered by orders
from St. Petersburg, and rendered
almost abortive by the enmity ex
isting between its officers and those
of the line.
Third. —Military necessities were
subordinated to personal comfort,
luxurious trains of the commander
in-chief and other high officers al
ways had the right of way, to the
neglect of troop and supply trains.
This with a single line of railroad
was a terrible drawback.
Fourth. — A complete breakdown
of their military information de
partment and spy system. This
left them almost in the condition
of a blind football eleven contend
ing against a perfect team.
Fifth. —The great number of solt
diers taken from the ranks to ac
as servants for the officers, —aver-

aging over three to each officer, a
grand aggregate of 40,000 rifles
taken from the line of battle.
Sixth. —By tyranny and oppres
sion they incurred the ill will and
at times the hostility of the inhabi
tants of the field of operations.
General Woodruff pointed out
three lessons that the United States
may well learn from the way Japan
conducted herself during the war.
The first lies in the wonderful way
in which she prepared herself for
the war; the second, in the way
she treated war correspondents on
the field; and the third, in the fact
that merit, and not political in
fluence, is at the bottom of the
promotion system in the army.
Japan's sanitary care of her sol
diers, and the fact that she replaced
vacancies in the ranks by drilled
recruits from the reserves instead
of recruiting new regiments, led by
inexperienced men, were also
factors in her success that may be
noted and copied by other nations.
