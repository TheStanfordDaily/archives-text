The report published in another
column of the work accomplished
during the past year by the Y. M.
C. A. is a record which that worthy
organization can view with par
donable pride. The quiet philan
thropic efforts of the association
deserve more attention than they
have received from the student
body which has received so much
benefit from them. The employ
ment bureau conducted by the as
sociation has become a particularly
valuble aid to other members of
the University community as well
as the- students, and the other ac
tivities of the Y. M. C. A., while not
so well known, are equally praise
worthy.
