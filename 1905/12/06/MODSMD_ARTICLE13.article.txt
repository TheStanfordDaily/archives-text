Know all men by these presents:
That the editor of the Chaparral
was not, and under no consider
ation would he be, a candidate for
the editorship of such a sheet as
the Daily Palo Alto. He was
absolutely oblivious of the fact that
a number of designing fellows were
secretly striving to besmirch his
reputation. It all might have been
very fUtthy, but Chappie doesn't
see it thftt way. It was a bum
joke. Chappie voted for Cunhd,
but Allen is the right man for the
place. M. Oppenheim.
