# RIOT IN MULLEN'S HALL.
## Fight Between Students and Deputies During Performance of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." 
### 
The performance of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" at Mullen's Hall in Palo
Alto last night was the scene of a
fight between two hundred stu
dents and six members of the Palo
Alto police force. The trouble
was started by the joshing of the
actors by the students, and was
brought to a head by one of the
deputies who struck a student on
the head with a club. The as
sault was entirely unprovoked, as
the man who was attacked had
been merely an onlooker during
the previous disturbance.
This hasty action angered the
studentß and resulted in a free-for
all fight in which the representa
tives of the law were roughly
handled and deprived of their
clubs.
Chief Hill of the Palo Alto
police force states that he as
sured the manager of the show
that he would be able to handle
the crowd alone. But the manager
insisted on extra police protection,
and six deputies were sworn in to
preserve the peace. The police
were armed with clubs and an in
discriminate use of these precipi
tated the trouble.
