## Y.M.C.A. SECRETARY ISSUES STATEMENT. " A Look Backward and a Look Forward" Shows Work of Different Departments. 
### 
The Young Men's Christian As
sociation has issued a folder show
ing the amount of work done, and
the field covered by that organi
zation this year. The report shows
that the Association is growing
rapidly, and that much work has
been done.
The report covers the work of the
last year, and gives the following
figures for the Association: 200
members out of 866 men in the
University; 62 men working on
committees; 25 men in weekly af
ternoon prayer meetings; 15 men
in evening group prayer meetings;
8 men in mission study; 65 men
enrolled in systematic Bible study;
25 men at Pacific Grove Confer
ence; 15 men at State Convention,
San Jose; 120 men furnished em
ployment to the value of about
$4,500; 5 socials and receptions
given; 3 lectures and concerts giv
en.
In addition to this the members
of the Association have assisted in
the local town gymnasium, and
have conducted classes in English
and Bible studies for Japanese
janitorß and students.
The information bureau in con
nection with the Young Women's
Christian Association was kept
open in rooms 1 and 2, and at the
Southern Pacific depot in Palo Alto
August 21st to 29th. During that
week 800 people visited the bureau.
New students were directed to ex
amination roomß or the offices of
professors, and helped to register.
The report of this department is
as follows: 200 students were di
rected to rooming and boarding
places; 1400 Boarding House Di
rectories were given away; 800
Association Handbooks were dis
tributed.
The folder is entitled " A
Look Backward and a Look
Forward," and on the last page is
a summary of the Stanford Asso
ciation. Among the imperative
needs are the continuance of the
present lineß of effort; the employ
ment of a permanent general secre
tary, and the financial and moral
support of students and friends.
A plea is made for the employ
ment of a secretary who can devote
his full time to the position. The
work of the Association has grown
until a student secretary on half
time cannot do the work required,
and attend to his studies.
