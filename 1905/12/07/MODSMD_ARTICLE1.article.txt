# MANY TRY FOR CAST
## SIXTY SOPHOMORES ENTER COMPETITION FOR PLACES. Coach Selects About Twenty-five Students from Whom Will Be Picked Final Cast. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the first try
out for the selection of the cast of
the Sophomore play, Goldsmith's
"She Stoops to Conquer," was held
by Mrs. J. E. Walker. More than
sixty candidates presented them
selves for the try-out, and the
coach spent the entire afternoon
trying the candidates for voice and
effectiveness of delivery. Each
candidate was given two trials by
reading selected passages and
scenes from the play.
The try-out was most thorough,
but even after spending the whole
afternoon in comparing the merits
of the different contestants, Mrs.
Walker was unable to announce
anything more definite in regard to
the make-up of the cast than that
she had simmered the candidates
down to about twenty-five, from
whom she will finally choose the
cast.
There are eighteen characters in
the play, but four being for women.
There are four male parts all of
which are of about equal import
ance, and the competition for these
places is exceedingly close. The
contest for the women's parts is
not so spirited, and the two lead
ing characters seem about settled.
As the matter now stands the
characters, fourteen in number,
will be picked from the following:
A. C. Kerr, E. J. Swift, W. M.
Walker, R. H. Baker, F. H. Abbott,
Jr., A. A. Murphy, A. L. Munger,
H. S. Ross, M. A. Gunst, N. D.
Cook, R. A. Boyd, T. T. Bennett,
E. W. Borough, C. H. Merrill, E.
R. Dickover, P. B. Delano, H. B.
Menardi, and R. K. Marshall.
The four women characters will
be represented by the following:
Miss E. R. Ellerbeck, Miss L. G.
Sturgiss, MiBS V. A. Steele, Miss
E. L. Buckingham, and Miss C. H.
Sheidler.
The first rehearsal will be held
next Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock
in room 230 of the English build
ing. At this meeting Mrs. Walker
will make a more thorough test of
the abilities of the candidates and
will probably settle the contests
which are now being made for
several of the places.
