The following article on ''The
Future of Football" was written in
Philadelphia by I)r. Jordan while
on his trip East last month, and
will appear in the issue of Collier's
Weekly published this week:
I am asked to say a word about
intercollegiate football, from the
point of view of a College President,
one who in hie day and generation
has been somewhat of an athlete,
and who still has faith in the value
of all forms of collegiate and most
forms of intercollegiate athletics.
First, as to the good side of foot
ball. As Professor Hiram Corson
once observed, "it is not a ladylike
game." It is a rough, virile, un
sparing, man contest, with a dis
tinct lesson in courage, patience,
self-control and cooperation. When
played by gentlemen, it tends to
strengthen the instincts of a gen
tleman. When it falls among
muckers, no doubt it shows all the
features of muckerism. Such fate
is not peculiar to football. It over
takes literature for example, —the
drama, and even religion. Those
who have played straight football
in honest teams with honest oppo
nents, testify to its value in teach
ing all the many virtues implied in
successful team work.
While men are sometimes killed
at football, and sometimes maimed
for life, such things do not often
happen outside of the raw begin
nings of the untrained secondary
schools. What is called the brutal
ity of football is greatly exagger
ated in current criticisms. The
number of deaths is scarcely great
er proportionally than that arising
from horseback riding, rowing,
yachting, swimming and other
forms of manly exercise from which
danger cannot be wholly excluded.
Brutality is by no means inherent
in football. For that matter, rough
play wins no games. Yet we must
confess that brutality ia too often
present, brutality criminal and
beastly. This indicates the presence
of the mucker, —a type of man the
very opposite of that which it is
the business of the University to
discover and develop.
There has been much discussion
of the possibility of improving the
game of football by making it more
interesting, by making it leßB dan
gerous, and by excluding the possi
bility of muckerism. As to the
first and second of these matters
the writer has no right to a final
opinion. The distinguished ath
lete-professors in whose hands the
forming of the game still lies, seem
to be far from any agreement among
themselves.
Beyond a doubt, the elimination
of mass plays and the encourage
ment of end runs, punting, and
rushing through a scattered field
would make the game more inter
esting to spectators. The interest
would also be heightened by a dis
tinctive color of dress on the two
sides, with a big letter on the back
ofeaclimanto distinguish guard,
tackle, quarter-back, and the rest

of the armament, one from an
other.
It is very doubtful whether a
more open game would be less dan
gerous. Most serious accidents oc
cur in the tackling of a swift run
ner in the midst of his interference,
the very play which is most inter
esting to the spectators.
As matters are, the game is too
beefy. There is too great a pre
mium on mere muscular force and
too much stress on the ability to
hammer a weak place in the line,
until at last it gives way through
Bheer exhaustion.
The remedies for actual brutality
or "dirty football" are mainly two:
the direct penalty, and the elimi
nation through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty
men who make games "dirty." The
direct remedy is in the hands of
the umpires. This remedy is never
sure enough, for umpires do not see
everything and sometimes do not
try to. There are umpires who will
think twice before ruling out a
member of a powerful team, on
whose good will future chances for
umpiring may depend. Moreover,
the penalty is not severe enough.
Dirty play at football stands in the
same category as cheating at cards.
It shows the offender to be a cad,
a mucker, a thief, who has no rights
in the presence of gentlemen. To
be convicted of dirty football should
bar the person in question from all
future intercollegiate games. That
the innocent might not suffer from
the umpire's bad judgment on the
moment, there should be some sort
of a court of final appeal.
But the proper antidote for
muckerism must rest with the Uni
versity and its relation to its own
athletic sports.
In a recent report the President
of Yale University has stated in
striking phrase that the great
function of the University is the
fixing of standards. By the stand
ards which the University sets all
its activities of whatever sort will
in the long run be affected and de
termined. An institution may be
caught unawares by an outbreak
of parasitic vulgarity. But the
prevalence and persistence of
muckerism in athletic sports or
elsewhere, indicates a "mucker"
college. And in every such case
the final responsibility rests with
the indifference or the vulgarity of
the college faculty; with the low
ness of its standands, or its failure
to fix them at all.
It is a recognized fact that many
members of our most successful
football teams, in fact most of the
men chosen by our experts for an
"All-American" line-up are pro
fessional or semi-profesional ath
letes. That is, they are in the
college, not for education, but for
what they can make out of the
game; taking their pay in cash or
notoriety or both. Through the
ingenuity of non-academic profes
sional coaches, rank outsiders so
far as University standards are
concerned, through the patriotism
of alumni and interested citizens
(largely gabblers, saloon keepers,
and promoters) a good many "in
ducements" can be offered to the
husky boys of the high schools,
and even to the still huskier fellowß
of no school at all.
If the professor in the college as
sumes an attitude of indifference
in these matters, the "bleacher"
set has its way. The more scrup
ulous of the student body are
swept aside and the team is fired
for victory. If, as sometimes
happens, the faculty and the
bleachers are on the academic level,
the way is smoothed for the athletic
tramp. He receives permission to
register in courses or departments
without entrance requirements; he
is excused from class attendance;
he is granted special examinations;
he is spared the humiliation of
being "flunked out." Or if that
salutary experience is given him,
the cards are issued at Christmas,
—after the great game is over; and
he is allowed to return and try
again in the fall.
An amateur is one who does a
certain thing because he likes it,
his profession or avocation lying in
some other direction. Amateur
sports are the play of men who do
not depend on sport for a living.
A "professional" is one who derives
his financial support wholly or in
part from the activity in question.
In any line of activity a profes
sional will naturally excel an
amateur. A college exists to de
velop professional excellence in in
tellectual lines. A college man is
rarely intending to become a pro
fessional athlete. The professional
life of an athlete is short and pre
carious, and a college man can do
better. College sports are there
fore the by-play of scholars and of
men in training for creative action.
Because they are the by-play of
men chosen for higher things, they
have their chief interest to the pub
lic. A baseball match of college
seniors counts for far more than a
game among street gamins; though
the latter may put up a better
game. The college men represent
standards in life. They are men
with a future, and this trait is, or
ought to he, shown in their games
as well as in their themes of inves
tigation. Moreover, the intercol
legiate games involve a comparison
of ideals in institutions; each with
its group of partisans. The charm
of football lies in its clash of clans.
In the fact that each clan dearly
loves victory, the parasite of muck
erism finds its place. In the joy
of victory, his operations pass with
the rest as part of college loyalty.
The man who wins is easily made
a hero, even if he has no elements
of heroism. He may win because
he is a professional, not an amateur,
and the game has its interest and
importance solely from its amateur
character.
The evil is not in professionalism
itself. There is no crime in being
a paid athlete. It lies in the trick
ery by which professionals mas
querade as amateurs, and by which
vulgar cads and their vulgar ways
become objects of worship to college
students, and of tender considera
tion by college faculties.
The remedy is this: It is the
duty of the college to stand for in
tellectual work and intellectual ex
cellence; for the manners and in
stincts we attribute the gentleman.
If the college has parasites from
which it cannot free itself; if it
maintain Bnap courses and depart
ments unworthy of its best ideals;
if it debar the students of these de
partments from the football teams,
it may be a useful charity to main
tain a night law school, open to all
comers. It is wrong to admit this
class of students to University
privileges even in athletics. To do
so, opens the doors to all abuses.
Furthermore, the actual standards
of the college should exist in fact
as well as in name. The man who
is gaining nothing intellectually
should be "taken to the edge of the
campus and dropped off" just as
soon as that fact appears. A salu
tary time to do this is about the
first of November. In any event,
don't wait till the game is over and
the mischief is done. The professor
who neglects his duty to escape the
abuse of the bleachers is particeps
criminis in fact in what the bleach
ers may demand. Nine-tenths of
the athletic parasites remain
through neglect on the part of in
dividual professors or of scholar
ship committees of their own duty
in the matter of upholding stan
dards. As the work test gets rid
of the ordinary tramp, so does the
athletic tramp vanish before the
test of scholarship.
Yet with all vigilance (and all
courage), college authorities are
sometimes imposed upon. To this
end the rule that a student going
from one college to another shall
not play football for the first year,
is a good one. The rule that he
■hall not play till entrance de
ficiencies are made up is also good.
The rule that attendance on classes
and attention to work is the first of
training rules, is still better. It is
essential to honest football that
the player should receive no favors
in class-room markings. To this
end the number of games should
be limited. Four or five games
each season, not more than half of
these away from home grounds,
represents the most that a fair stu
dent can do and retain his stand
ing in scholarship. A schedule
much more strenuous than this is
prima facie evidence of academic
laxity, which means professional
ism.

Above all, it must be insisted
that the final responsibility for
University standards, for standards
of behavior, and standards of
honesty, as well as standards of
scholarship, must in America rest
with the University faculty. To
deny this responsibility is not to
escape from it. The student body
is our own creation. And in view
of this responsibility in athletic
matters, our attitude should be
constructive, not negative. It
serves little purpose to pile up
restrictive legislation, to be ig
nored in proportion to its severity
or its complexity. It counts for
nothing to "flunk" out an occasion
al football hero. The work of the
institution should be so organized
as to leave no stagnant waters; to
allow no dead wood accumulations.
Keep the men busy with better
things. Help them to form their
athletic ideals. Let the mucker
and the loafer be cast out by auto
matic action. Then in the final
count we shall find football inter
esting, helpful, honest, a worthy
aid in the development of sturdy
manhood.
One alternative remains : Let
the football team become frankly
professional. Cast off all deception.
Get the best professional coach.
Pay him well, and let him have the
best men the town and the alumni
will pay for. Throw off all re
strictions as to previous experience
and duration of engagement by the
players. Let the only rules be the
rules of the game. Let the paid

team struggle with its rivals on the
gridiron in perfectly honest war
fare, each known for what it is, and
with no masquerade of amateurism
or of academic ideals. Let the
rooters root and the faculty cheer
if they care to do so. There is no
harm in this. It is nothing more
nor lees than takes place in base
ball every day, only the "giants"
and the "seals" and the "red stock
ings" struggle under the banner of
individual cities, not of universi
ties. That does not matter. The
evil in current football rests not in
the hired coaches and hired men,
but in academic lying and in the
falsification of our own standards
as associations of scholars and men
of honor. Let these hired teams
play as often as they will, on Sat
urdays and on holidays, so as not
to interrupt the regular work. But
keep the students out of them,unless
they are strong enough to play for
money while they study for pleas
ure. In any case, if they do play,
let them be content to forfeit their
amateur standing. To those who
nee nothing wrong in the present
situation we commend this ar
rangement. No real interest would
suffer, because nobody would need
act a lie. Amateurism and pro
fessionalism would stand each on
its own merits, and that is all that
we ask for the purification of foot
ball. The next problem is to make
the game more civilized, more in
teresting, more individual and
more useful.

nation through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty
men who make games "dirty." The
direct remedy is in the hands of
the umpires. This remedy is never
sure enough, for umpires do not see
everything and sometimes do not
try to. There are umpires who will
think twice before ruling out a
member of a powerful team, on
whose good will future chances for
umpiring may depend. Moreover,
the penalty is not severe enough.
Dirty play at football stands in the
same category as cheating at cards.
It shows the offender to be a cad,
a mucker, a thief, who has no rights
in the presence of gentlemen. To
be convicted of dirty football should
bar the person in question from all
future intercollegiate games. That
the innocent might not suffer from
the umpire's bad judgment on the
moment, there should be some sort
of a court of final appeal.
But the proper antidote for
muckerism must rest with the Uni
versity and its relation to its own
athletic sports.
In a recent report the President
of Yale University has stated in
striking phrase that the great
function of the University is the
fixing of standards. By the stand
ards which the University sets all
its activities of whatever sort will
in the long run be affected and de
termined. An institution may be
caught unawares by an outbreak
of parasitic vulgarity. But the
prevalence and persistence of
muckerism in athletic sports or
elsewhere, indicates a "mucker"
college. And in every such case
the final responsibility rests with
the indifference or the vulgarity of
the college faculty; with the low
ness of its standands, or its failure
to fix them at all.
It is a recognized fact that many
members of our most successful
football teams, in fact most of the
men chosen by our experts for an
"All-American" line-up are pro
fessional or semi-profesional ath
letes. That is, they are in the
college, not for education, but for
what they can make out of the
game; taking their pay in cash or
notoriety or both. Through the
ingenuity of non-academic profes
sional coaches, rank outsiders so
far as University standards are
concerned, through the patriotism
of alumni and interested citizens
(largely gabblers, saloon keepers,
and promoters) a good many "in
ducements" can be offered to the
husky boys of the high schools,
and even to the still huskier fellowß
of no school at all.
If the professor in the college as
sumes an attitude of indifference
in these matters, the "bleacher"
set has its way. The more scrup
ulous of the student body are
swept aside and the team is fired
for victory. If, as sometimes
happens, the faculty and the
bleachers are on the academic level,
the way is smoothed for the athletic
tramp. He receives permission to
register in courses or departments
without entrance requirements; he
is excused from class attendance;
he is granted special examinations;
he is spared the humiliation of
being "flunked out." Or if that
salutary experience is given him,
the cards are issued at Christmas,
—after the great game is over; and
he is allowed to return and try
again in the fall.
An amateur is one who does a
certain thing because he likes it,
his profession or avocation lying in
some other direction. Amateur
sports are the play of men who do
not depend on sport for a living.
A "professional" is one who derives
his financial support wholly or in
part from the activity in question.
In any line of activity a profes
sional will naturally excel an
amateur. A college exists to de
velop professional excellence in in
tellectual lines. A college man is
rarely intending to become a pro
fessional athlete. The professional
life of an athlete is short and pre
carious, and a college man can do
better. College sports are there
fore the by-play of scholars and of
men in training for creative action.
Because they are the by-play of
men chosen for higher things, they
have their chief interest to the pub
lic. A baseball match of college
seniors counts for far more than a
game among street gamins; though
the latter may put up a better
game. The college men represent
standards in life. They are men
with a future, and this trait is, or
ought to he, shown in their games
as well as in their themes of inves
tigation. Moreover, the intercol
legiate games involve a comparison
of ideals in institutions; each with
its group of partisans. The charm
of football lies in its clash of clans.
In the fact that each clan dearly
loves victory, the parasite of muck
erism finds its place. In the joy
of victory, his operations pass with
the rest as part of college loyalty.
The man who wins is easily made
a hero, even if he has no elements
of heroism. He may win because
he is a professional, not an amateur,
and the game has its interest and
importance solely from its amateur
character.
The evil is not in professionalism
itself. There is no crime in being
a paid athlete. It lies in the trick
ery by which professionals mas
querade as amateurs, and by which
vulgar cads and their vulgar ways
become objects of worship to college
students, and of tender considera
tion by college faculties.
The remedy is this: It is the
duty of the college to stand for in
tellectual work and intellectual ex
cellence; for the manners and in
stincts we attribute the gentleman.
If the college has parasites from
which it cannot free itself; if it
maintain Bnap courses and depart
ments unworthy of its best ideals;
if it debar the students of these de
partments from the football teams,
it may be a useful charity to main
tain a night law school, open to all
comers. It is wrong to admit this
class of students to University
privileges even in athletics. To do
so, opens the doors to all abuses.
Furthermore, the actual standards
of the college should exist in fact
as well as in name. The man who
is gaining nothing intellectually
should be "taken to the edge of the
campus and dropped off" just as
soon as that fact appears. A salu
tary time to do this is about the
first of November. In any event,
don't wait till the game is over and
the mischief is done. The professor
who neglects his duty to escape the
abuse of the bleachers is particeps
criminis in fact in what the bleach
ers may demand. Nine-tenths of
the athletic parasites remain
through neglect on the part of in
dividual professors or of scholar
ship committees of their own duty
in the matter of upholding stan
dards. As the work test gets rid
of the ordinary tramp, so does the
athletic tramp vanish before the
test of scholarship.
Yet with all vigilance (and all
courage), college authorities are
sometimes imposed upon. To this
end the rule that a student going
from one college to another shall
not play football for the first year,
is a good one. The rule that he
■hall not play till entrance de
ficiencies are made up is also good.
The rule that attendance on classes
and attention to work is the first of
training rules, is still better. It is
essential to honest football that
the player should receive no favors
in class-room markings. To this
end the number of games should
be limited. Four or five games
each season, not more than half of
these away from home grounds,
represents the most that a fair stu
dent can do and retain his stand
ing in scholarship. A schedule
much more strenuous than this is
prima facie evidence of academic
laxity, which means professional
ism.

Above all, it must be insisted
that the final responsibility for
University standards, for standards
of behavior, and standards of
honesty, as well as standards of
scholarship, must in America rest
with the University faculty. To
deny this responsibility is not to
escape from it. The student body
is our own creation. And in view
of this responsibility in athletic
matters, our attitude should be
constructive, not negative. It
serves little purpose to pile up
restrictive legislation, to be ig
nored in proportion to its severity
or its complexity. It counts for
nothing to "flunk" out an occasion
al football hero. The work of the
institution should be so organized
as to leave no stagnant waters; to
allow no dead wood accumulations.
Keep the men busy with better
things. Help them to form their
athletic ideals. Let the mucker
and the loafer be cast out by auto
matic action. Then in the final
count we shall find football inter
esting, helpful, honest, a worthy
aid in the development of sturdy
manhood.
One alternative remains : Let
the football team become frankly
professional. Cast off all deception.
Get the best professional coach.
Pay him well, and let him have the
best men the town and the alumni
will pay for. Throw off all re
strictions as to previous experience
and duration of engagement by the
players. Let the only rules be the
rules of the game. Let the paid

team struggle with its rivals on the
gridiron in perfectly honest war
fare, each known for what it is, and
with no masquerade of amateurism
or of academic ideals. Let the
rooters root and the faculty cheer
if they care to do so. There is no
harm in this. It is nothing more
nor lees than takes place in base
ball every day, only the "giants"
and the "seals" and the "red stock
ings" struggle under the banner of
individual cities, not of universi
ties. That does not matter. The
evil in current football rests not in
the hired coaches and hired men,
but in academic lying and in the
falsification of our own standards
as associations of scholars and men
of honor. Let these hired teams
play as often as they will, on Sat
urdays and on holidays, so as not
to interrupt the regular work. But
keep the students out of them,unless
they are strong enough to play for
money while they study for pleas
ure. In any case, if they do play,
let them be content to forfeit their
amateur standing. To those who
nee nothing wrong in the present
situation we commend this ar
rangement. No real interest would
suffer, because nobody would need
act a lie. Amateurism and pro
fessionalism would stand each on
its own merits, and that is all that
we ask for the purification of foot
ball. The next problem is to make
the game more civilized, more in
teresting, more individual and
more useful.

The following article on ''The
Future of Football" was written in
Philadelphia by I)r. Jordan while
on his trip East last month, and
will appear in the issue of Collier's
Weekly published this week:
I am asked to say a word about
intercollegiate football, from the
point of view of a College President,
one who in hie day and generation
has been somewhat of an athlete,
and who still has faith in the value
of all forms of collegiate and most
forms of intercollegiate athletics.
First, as to the good side of foot
ball. As Professor Hiram Corson
once observed, "it is not a ladylike
game." It is a rough, virile, un
sparing, man contest, with a dis
tinct lesson in courage, patience,
self-control and cooperation. When
played by gentlemen, it tends to
strengthen the instincts of a gen
tleman. When it falls among
muckers, no doubt it shows all the
features of muckerism. Such fate
is not peculiar to football. It over
takes literature for example, —the
drama, and even religion. Those
who have played straight football
in honest teams with honest oppo
nents, testify to its value in teach
ing all the many virtues implied in
successful team work.
While men are sometimes killed
at football, and sometimes maimed
for life, such things do not often
happen outside of the raw begin
nings of the untrained secondary
schools. What is called the brutal
ity of football is greatly exagger
ated in current criticisms. The
number of deaths is scarcely great
er proportionally than that arising
from horseback riding, rowing,
yachting, swimming and other
forms of manly exercise from which
danger cannot be wholly excluded.
Brutality is by no means inherent
in football. For that matter, rough
play wins no games. Yet we must
confess that brutality ia too often
present, brutality criminal and
beastly. This indicates the presence
of the mucker, —a type of man the
very opposite of that which it is
the business of the University to
discover and develop.
There has been much discussion
of the possibility of improving the
game of football by making it more
interesting, by making it leßB dan
gerous, and by excluding the possi
bility of muckerism. As to the
first and second of these matters
the writer has no right to a final
opinion. The distinguished ath
lete-professors in whose hands the
forming of the game still lies, seem
to be far from any agreement among
themselves.
Beyond a doubt, the elimination
of mass plays and the encourage
ment of end runs, punting, and
rushing through a scattered field
would make the game more inter
esting to spectators. The interest
would also be heightened by a dis
tinctive color of dress on the two
sides, with a big letter on the back
ofeaclimanto distinguish guard,
tackle, quarter-back, and the rest

of the armament, one from an
other.
It is very doubtful whether a
more open game would be less dan
gerous. Most serious accidents oc
cur in the tackling of a swift run
ner in the midst of his interference,
the very play which is most inter
esting to the spectators.
As matters are, the game is too
beefy. There is too great a pre
mium on mere muscular force and
too much stress on the ability to
hammer a weak place in the line,
until at last it gives way through
Bheer exhaustion.
The remedies for actual brutality
or "dirty football" are mainly two:
the direct penalty, and the elimi
nation through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty
men who make games "dirty." The
direct remedy is in the hands of

amateur. A college exists to de
velop professional excellence in in
tellectual lines. A college man is
rarely intending to become a pro
fessional athlete. The professional
life of an athlete is short and pre
carious, and a college man can do
better. College sports are there
fore the by-play of scholars and of
men in training for creative action.
Because they are the by-play of
men chosen for higher things, they
have their chief interest to the pub
lic. A baseball match of college
seniors counts for far more than a
game among street gamins; though
the latter may put up a better
game. The college men represent
standards in life. They are men
with a future, and this trait is, or
ought to he, shown in their games
as well as in their themes of inves
tigation. Moreover, the intercol
legiate games involve a comparison
of ideals in institutions; each with
its group of partisans. The charm
of football lies in its clash of clans.
In the fact that each clan dearly
loves victory, the parasite of muck
erism finds its place. In the joy
of victory, his operations pass with
the rest as part of college loyalty.
The man who wins is easily made
a hero, even if he has no elements
of heroism. He may win because
he is a professional, not an amateur,
and the game has its interest and
importance solely from its amateur
character.
The evil is not in professionalism
itself. There is no crime in being
a paid athlete. It lies in the trick
ery by which professionals mas
querade as amateurs, and by which
vulgar cads and their vulgar ways
become objects of worship to college
students, and of tender considera
tion by college faculties.
The remedy is this: It is the
duty of the college to stand for in
tellectual work and intellectual ex
cellence; for the manners and in
stincts we attribute the gentleman.
If the college has parasites from
which it cannot free itself; if it
maintain Bnap courses and depart
ments unworthy of its best ideals;
if it debar the students of these de
partments from the football teams,
it may be a useful charity to main
tain a night law school, open to all
comers. It is wrong to admit this
class of students to University
privileges even in athletics. To do
so, opens the doors to all abuses.
Furthermore, the actual standards
of the college should exist in fact
as well as in name. The man who
is gaining nothing intellectually
should be "taken to the edge of the
campus and dropped off" just as
soon as that fact appears. A salu
tary time to do this is about the
first of November. In any event,
don't wait till the game is over and
the mischief is done. The professor
who neglects his duty to escape the
abuse of the bleachers is particeps
criminis in fact in what the bleach
ers may demand. Nine-tenths of
the athletic parasites remain
through neglect on the part of in
dividual professors or of scholar
ship committees of their own duty
in the matter of upholding stan
dards. As the work test gets rid
of the ordinary tramp, so does the
athletic tramp vanish before the
test of scholarship.
Yet with all vigilance (and all
courage), college authorities are
sometimes imposed upon. To this
end the rule that a student going
from one college to another shall
not play football for the first year,
is a good one. The rule that he
■hall not play till entrance de
ficiencies are made up is also good.
The rule that attendance on classes
and attention to work is the first of
training rules, is still better. It is
essential to honest football that
the player should receive no favors
in class-room markings. To this
end the number of games should
be limited. Four or five games
each season, not more than half of
these away from home grounds,
represents the most that a fair stu
dent can do and retain his stand
ing in scholarship. A schedule
much more strenuous than this is
prima facie evidence of academic
laxity, which means professional
ism.

Above all, it must be insisted
that the final responsibility for
University standards, for standards
of behavior, and standards of
honesty, as well as standards of
scholarship, must in America rest
with the University faculty. To
deny this responsibility is not to
escape from it. The student body
is our own creation. And in view
of this responsibility in athletic
matters, our attitude should be
constructive, not negative. It
serves little purpose to pile up
restrictive legislation, to be ig
nored in proportion to its severity
or its complexity. It counts for
nothing to "flunk" out an occasion
al football hero. The work of the
institution should be so organized
as to leave no stagnant waters; to
allow no dead wood accumulations.
Keep the men busy with better
things. Help them to form their
athletic ideals. Let the mucker
and the loafer be cast out by auto
matic action. Then in the final
count we shall find football inter
esting, helpful, honest, a worthy
aid in the development of sturdy
manhood.
One alternative remains : Let
the football team become frankly
professional. Cast off all deception.
Get the best professional coach.
Pay him well, and let him have the
best men the town and the alumni
will pay for. Throw off all re
strictions as to previous experience
and duration of engagement by the
players. Let the only rules be the
rules of the game. Let the paid

team struggle with its rivals on the
gridiron in perfectly honest war
fare, each known for what it is, and
with no masquerade of amateurism
or of academic ideals. Let the
rooters root and the faculty cheer
if they care to do so. There is no
harm in this. It is nothing more
nor lees than takes place in base
ball every day, only the "giants"
and the "seals" and the "red stock
ings" struggle under the banner of
individual cities, not of universi
ties. That does not matter. The
evil in current football rests not in
the hired coaches and hired men,
but in academic lying and in the
falsification of our own standards
as associations of scholars and men
of honor. Let these hired teams
play as often as they will, on Sat
urdays and on holidays, so as not
to interrupt the regular work. But
keep the students out of them,unless
they are strong enough to play for
money while they study for pleas
ure. In any case, if they do play,
let them be content to forfeit their
amateur standing. To those who
nee nothing wrong in the present
situation we commend this ar
rangement. No real interest would
suffer, because nobody would need
act a lie. Amateurism and pro
fessionalism would stand each on
its own merits, and that is all that
we ask for the purification of foot
ball. The next problem is to make
the game more civilized, more in
teresting, more individual and
more useful.

The following article on ''The
Future of Football" was written in
Philadelphia by I)r. Jordan while
on his trip East last month, and
will appear in the issue of Collier's
Weekly published this week:
I am asked to say a word about
intercollegiate football, from the
point of view of a College President,
one who in hie day and generation
has been somewhat of an athlete,
and who still has faith in the value
of all forms of collegiate and most
forms of intercollegiate athletics.
First, as to the good side of foot
ball. As Professor Hiram Corson
once observed, "it is not a ladylike
game." It is a rough, virile, un
sparing, man contest, with a dis
tinct lesson in courage, patience,
self-control and cooperation. When
played by gentlemen, it tends to
strengthen the instincts of a gen
tleman. When it falls among
muckers, no doubt it shows all the
features of muckerism. Such fate
is not peculiar to football. It over
takes literature for example, —the
drama, and even religion. Those
who have played straight football
in honest teams with honest oppo
nents, testify to its value in teach
ing all the many virtues implied in
successful team work.
While men are sometimes killed
at football, and sometimes maimed
for life, such things do not often
happen outside of the raw begin
nings of the untrained secondary
schools. What is called the brutal
ity of football is greatly exagger
ated in current criticisms. The
number of deaths is scarcely great
er proportionally than that arising
from horseback riding, rowing,
yachting, swimming and other
forms of manly exercise from which
danger cannot be wholly excluded.
Brutality is by no means inherent
in football. For that matter, rough
play wins no games. Yet we must
confess that brutality ia too often
present, brutality criminal and
beastly. This indicates the presence
of the mucker, —a type of man the
very opposite of that which it is
the business of the University to
discover and develop.
There has been much discussion
of the possibility of improving the
game of football by making it more
interesting, by making it leßB dan
gerous, and by excluding the possi
bility of muckerism. As to the
first and second of these matters
the writer has no right to a final
opinion. The distinguished ath
lete-professors in whose hands the
forming of the game still lies, seem
to be far from any agreement among
themselves.
Beyond a doubt, the elimination
of mass plays and the encourage
ment of end runs, punting, and
rushing through a scattered field
would make the game more inter
esting to spectators. The interest
would also be heightened by a dis
tinctive color of dress on the two
sides, with a big letter on the back
ofeaclimanto distinguish guard,
tackle, quarter-back, and the rest

of the armament, one from an
other.
It is very doubtful whether a
more open game would be less dan
gerous. Most serious accidents oc
cur in the tackling of a swift run
ner in the midst of his interference,
the very play which is most inter
esting to the spectators.
As matters are, the game is too
beefy. There is too great a pre
mium on mere muscular force and
too much stress on the ability to
hammer a weak place in the line,
until at last it gives way through
Bheer exhaustion.
The remedies for actual brutality
or "dirty football" are mainly two:
the direct penalty, and the elimi
nation through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty
men who make games "dirty." The
direct remedy is in the hands of
the umpires. This remedy is never
sure enough, for umpires do not see
everything and sometimes do not
try to. There are umpires who will
think twice before ruling out a
member of a powerful team, on
whose good will future chances for
umpiring may depend. Moreover,
the penalty is not severe enough.
Dirty play at football stands in the
same category as cheating at cards.
It shows the offender to be a cad,
a mucker, a thief, who has no rights
in the presence of gentlemen. To
be convicted of dirty football should
bar the person in question from all
future intercollegiate games. That
the innocent might not suffer from
the umpire's bad judgment on the
moment, there should be some sort
of a court of final appeal.
But the proper antidote for
muckerism must rest with the Uni
versity and its relation to its own
athletic sports.
In a recent report the President
of Yale University has stated in
striking phrase that the great
function of the University is the
fixing of standards. By the stand
ards which the University sets all
its activities of whatever sort will
in the long run be affected and de
termined. An institution may be
caught unawares by an outbreak
of parasitic vulgarity. But the
prevalence and persistence of
muckerism in athletic sports or
elsewhere, indicates a "mucker"
college. And in every such case
the final responsibility rests with
the indifference or the vulgarity of
the college faculty; with the low
ness of its standands, or its failure
to fix them at all.
It is a recognized fact that many
members of our most successful
football teams, in fact most of the
men chosen by our experts for an
"All-American" line-up are pro
fessional or semi-profesional ath
letes. That is, they are in the
college, not for education, but for
what they can make out of the
game; taking their pay in cash or
notoriety or both. Through the
ingenuity of non-academic profes
sional coaches, rank outsiders so
far as University standards are
concerned, through the patriotism
of alumni and interested citizens
(largely gabblers, saloon keepers,
and promoters) a good many "in
ducements" can be offered to the
husky boys of the high schools,
and even to the still huskier fellowß
of no school at all.
If the professor in the college as
sumes an attitude of indifference
in these matters, the "bleacher"
set has its way. The more scrup
ulous of the student body are
swept aside and the team is fired
for victory. If, as sometimes
happens, the faculty and the
bleachers are on the academic level,
the way is smoothed for the athletic
tramp. He receives permission to
register in courses or departments
without entrance requirements; he
is excused from class attendance;
he is granted special examinations;
he is spared the humiliation of
being "flunked out." Or if that
salutary experience is given him,
the cards are issued at Christmas,
—after the great game is over; and
he is allowed to return and try
again in the fall.
An amateur is one who does a
certain thing because he likes it,
his profession or avocation lying in
some other direction. Amateur
sports are the play of men who do
not depend on sport for a living.
A "professional" is one who derives
his financial support wholly or in
part from the activity in question.
In any line of activity a profes
sional will naturally excel an
amateur. A college exists to de
velop professional excellence in in
tellectual lines. A college man is
rarely intending to become a pro
fessional athlete. The professional
life of an athlete is short and pre

essential to honest football that
the player should receive no favors
in class-room markings. To this
end the number of games should
be limited. Four or five games
each season, not more than half of
these away from home grounds,
represents the most that a fair stu
dent can do and retain his stand
ing in scholarship. A schedule
much more strenuous than this is
prima facie evidence of academic
laxity, which means professional
ism.

Above all, it must be insisted
that the final responsibility for
University standards, for standards
of behavior, and standards of
honesty, as well as standards of
scholarship, must in America rest
with the University faculty. To
deny this responsibility is not to
escape from it. The student body
is our own creation. And in view
of this responsibility in athletic
matters, our attitude should be
constructive, not negative. It
serves little purpose to pile up
restrictive legislation, to be ig
nored in proportion to its severity
or its complexity. It counts for
nothing to "flunk" out an occasion
al football hero. The work of the
institution should be so organized
as to leave no stagnant waters; to
allow no dead wood accumulations.
Keep the men busy with better
things. Help them to form their
athletic ideals. Let the mucker
and the loafer be cast out by auto
matic action. Then in the final
count we shall find football inter
esting, helpful, honest, a worthy
aid in the development of sturdy
manhood.
One alternative remains : Let
the football team become frankly
professional. Cast off all deception.
Get the best professional coach.
Pay him well, and let him have the
best men the town and the alumni
will pay for. Throw off all re
strictions as to previous experience
and duration of engagement by the
players. Let the only rules be the
rules of the game. Let the paid

team struggle with its rivals on the
gridiron in perfectly honest war
fare, each known for what it is, and
with no masquerade of amateurism
or of academic ideals. Let the
rooters root and the faculty cheer
if they care to do so. There is no
harm in this. It is nothing more
nor lees than takes place in base
ball every day, only the "giants"
and the "seals" and the "red stock
ings" struggle under the banner of
individual cities, not of universi
ties. That does not matter. The
evil in current football rests not in
the hired coaches and hired men,
but in academic lying and in the
falsification of our own standards
as associations of scholars and men
of honor. Let these hired teams
play as often as they will, on Sat
urdays and on holidays, so as not
to interrupt the regular work. But
keep the students out of them,unless
they are strong enough to play for
money while they study for pleas
ure. In any case, if they do play,
let them be content to forfeit their
amateur standing. To those who
nee nothing wrong in the present
situation we commend this ar
rangement. No real interest would
suffer, because nobody would need
act a lie. Amateurism and pro
fessionalism would stand each on
its own merits, and that is all that
we ask for the purification of foot
ball. The next problem is to make
the game more civilized, more in
teresting, more individual and
more useful.

The following article on ''The
Future of Football" was written in
Philadelphia by I)r. Jordan while
on his trip East last month, and
will appear in the issue of Collier's
Weekly published this week:
I am asked to say a word about
intercollegiate football, from the
point of view of a College President,
one who in hie day and generation
has been somewhat of an athlete,
and who still has faith in the value
of all forms of collegiate and most
forms of intercollegiate athletics.
First, as to the good side of foot
ball. As Professor Hiram Corson
once observed, "it is not a ladylike
game." It is a rough, virile, un
sparing, man contest, with a dis
tinct lesson in courage, patience,
self-control and cooperation. When
played by gentlemen, it tends to
strengthen the instincts of a gen
tleman. When it falls among
muckers, no doubt it shows all the
features of muckerism. Such fate
is not peculiar to football. It over
takes literature for example, —the
drama, and even religion. Those
who have played straight football
in honest teams with honest oppo
nents, testify to its value in teach
ing all the many virtues implied in
successful team work.
While men are sometimes killed
at football, and sometimes maimed
for life, such things do not often
happen outside of the raw begin
nings of the untrained secondary
schools. What is called the brutal
ity of football is greatly exagger
ated in current criticisms. The
number of deaths is scarcely great
er proportionally than that arising
from horseback riding, rowing,
yachting, swimming and other
forms of manly exercise from which
danger cannot be wholly excluded.
Brutality is by no means inherent
in football. For that matter, rough
play wins no games. Yet we must
confess that brutality ia too often
present, brutality criminal and
beastly. This indicates the presence
of the mucker, —a type of man the
very opposite of that which it is
the business of the University to
discover and develop.
There has been much discussion
of the possibility of improving the
game of football by making it more
interesting, by making it leßB dan
gerous, and by excluding the possi
bility of muckerism. As to the
first and second of these matters
the writer has no right to a final
opinion. The distinguished ath
lete-professors in whose hands the
forming of the game still lies, seem
to be far from any agreement among
themselves.
Beyond a doubt, the elimination
of mass plays and the encourage
ment of end runs, punting, and
rushing through a scattered field
would make the game more inter
esting to spectators. The interest
would also be heightened by a dis
tinctive color of dress on the two
sides, with a big letter on the back
ofeaclimanto distinguish guard,
tackle, quarter-back, and the rest

of the armament, one from an
other.
It is very doubtful whether a
more open game would be less dan
gerous. Most serious accidents oc
cur in the tackling of a swift run
ner in the midst of his interference,
the very play which is most inter
esting to the spectators.
As matters are, the game is too
beefy. There is too great a pre
mium on mere muscular force and
too much stress on the ability to
hammer a weak place in the line,
until at last it gives way through
Bheer exhaustion.
The remedies for actual brutality
or "dirty football" are mainly two:
the direct penalty, and the elimi
nation through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty
men who make games "dirty." The
direct remedy is in the hands of
the umpires. This remedy is never
sure enough, for umpires do not see
everything and sometimes do not
try to. There are umpires who will
think twice before ruling out a
member of a powerful team, on
whose good will future chances for
umpiring may depend. Moreover,
the penalty is not severe enough.
Dirty play at football stands in the
same category as cheating at cards.
It shows the offender to be a cad,
a mucker, a thief, who has no rights
in the presence of gentlemen. To
be convicted of dirty football should
bar the person in question from all
future intercollegiate games. That
the innocent might not suffer from
the umpire's bad judgment on the
moment, there should be some sort
of a court of final appeal.
But the proper antidote for
muckerism must rest with the Uni
versity and its relation to its own
athletic sports.
In a recent report the President
of Yale University has stated in
striking phrase that the great
function of the University is the
fixing of standards. By the stand
ards which the University sets all
its activities of whatever sort will
in the long run be affected and de
termined. An institution may be
caught unawares by an outbreak
of parasitic vulgarity. But the
prevalence and persistence of
muckerism in athletic sports or
elsewhere, indicates a "mucker"
college. And in every such case
the final responsibility rests with
the indifference or the vulgarity of
the college faculty; with the low
ness of its standands, or its failure
to fix them at all.
It is a recognized fact that many
members of our most successful
football teams, in fact most of the
men chosen by our experts for an
"All-American" line-up are pro
fessional or semi-profesional ath
letes. That is, they are in the
college, not for education, but for
what they can make out of the
game; taking their pay in cash or
notoriety or both. Through the
ingenuity of non-academic profes
sional coaches, rank outsiders so
far as University standards are
concerned, through the patriotism
of alumni and interested citizens
(largely gabblers, saloon keepers,
and promoters) a good many "in
ducements" can be offered to the
husky boys of the high schools,
and even to the still huskier fellowß
of no school at all.
If the professor in the college as
sumes an attitude of indifference
in these matters, the "bleacher"
set has its way. The more scrup
ulous of the student body are
swept aside and the team is fired
for victory. If, as sometimes
happens, the faculty and the
bleachers are on the academic level,
the way is smoothed for the athletic
tramp. He receives permission to
register in courses or departments
without entrance requirements; he
is excused from class attendance;
he is granted special examinations;
he is spared the humiliation of
being "flunked out." Or if that
salutary experience is given him,
the cards are issued at Christmas,
—after the great game is over; and
he is allowed to return and try
again in the fall.
An amateur is one who does a
certain thing because he likes it,
his profession or avocation lying in
some other direction. Amateur
sports are the play of men who do
not depend on sport for a living.
A "professional" is one who derives
his financial support wholly or in
part from the activity in question.
In any line of activity a profes
sional will naturally excel an
amateur. A college exists to de
velop professional excellence in in
tellectual lines. A college man is
rarely intending to become a pro
fessional athlete. The professional
life of an athlete is short and pre
carious, and a college man can do
better. College sports are there
fore the by-play of scholars and of
men in training for creative action.
Because they are the by-play of
men chosen for higher things, they
have their chief interest to the pub
lic. A baseball match of college
seniors counts for far more than a
game among street gamins; though
the latter may put up a better
game. The college men represent
standards in life. They are men
with a future, and this trait is, or
ought to he, shown in their games
as well as in their themes of inves
tigation. Moreover, the intercol
legiate games involve a comparison
of ideals in institutions; each with
its group of partisans. The charm
of football lies in its clash of clans.
In the fact that each clan dearly
loves victory, the parasite of muck
erism finds its place. In the joy
of victory, his operations pass with
the rest as part of college loyalty.
The man who wins is easily made
a hero, even if he has no elements
of heroism. He may win because
he is a professional, not an amateur,
and the game has its interest and
importance solely from its amateur
character.
The evil is not in professionalism
itself. There is no crime in being
a paid athlete. It lies in the trick
ery by which professionals mas
querade as amateurs, and by which
vulgar cads and their vulgar ways
become objects of worship to college
students, and of tender considera
tion by college faculties.
The remedy is this: It is the
duty of the college to stand for in
tellectual work and intellectual ex
cellence; for the manners and in
stincts we attribute the gentleman.
If the college has parasites from
which it cannot free itself; if it
maintain Bnap courses and depart
ments unworthy of its best ideals;
if it debar the students of these de
partments from the football teams,
it may be a useful charity to main
tain a night law school, open to all
comers. It is wrong to admit this
class of students to University
privileges even in athletics. To do
so, opens the doors to all abuses.
Furthermore, the actual standards
of the college should exist in fact
as well as in name. The man who
is gaining nothing intellectually
should be "taken to the edge of the
campus and dropped off" just as
soon as that fact appears. A salu
tary time to do this is about the
first of November. In any event,
don't wait till the game is over and
the mischief is done. The professor
who neglects his duty to escape the
abuse of the bleachers is particeps
criminis in fact in what the bleach
ers may demand. Nine-tenths of
the athletic parasites remain
through neglect on the part of in
dividual professors or of scholar
ship committees of their own duty
in the matter of upholding stan
dards. As the work test gets rid
of the ordinary tramp, so does the
athletic tramp vanish before the
test of scholarship.
Yet with all vigilance (and all
courage), college authorities are
sometimes imposed upon. To this
end the rule that a student going
from one college to another shall
not play football for the first year,
is a good one. The rule that he
■hall not play till entrance de
ficiencies are made up is also good.
The rule that attendance on classes
and attention to work is the first of
training rules, is still better. It is
essential to honest football that
the player should receive no favors
in class-room markings. To this
end the number of games should
be limited. Four or five games
