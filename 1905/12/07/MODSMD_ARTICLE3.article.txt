The following article on ''The
Future of Football" was written in
Philadelphia by I)r. Jordan while
on his trip East last month, and
will appear in the issue of Collier's
Weekly published this week:
I am asked to say a word about
intercollegiate football, from the
point of view of a College President,
one who in hie day and generation
has been somewhat of an athlete,
and who still has faith in the value
of all forms of collegiate and most
forms of intercollegiate athletics.
First, as to the good side of foot
ball. As Professor Hiram Corson
once observed, "it is not a ladylike
game." It is a rough, virile, un
sparing, man contest, with a dis
tinct lesson in courage, patience,
self-control and cooperation. When
played by gentlemen, it tends to
strengthen the instincts of a gen
tleman. When it falls among
muckers, no doubt it shows all the
features of muckerism. Such fate
is not peculiar to football. It over
takes literature for example, —the
drama, and even religion. Those
who have played straight football
in honest teams with honest oppo
nents, testify to its value in teach
ing all the many virtues implied in
successful team work.
While men are sometimes killed
at football, and sometimes maimed
for life, such things do not often
happen outside of the raw begin
nings of the untrained secondary
schools. What is called the brutal
ity of football is greatly exagger
ated in current criticisms. The
number of deaths is scarcely great
er proportionally than that arising
from horseback riding, rowing,
yachting, swimming and other
forms of manly exercise from which
danger cannot be wholly excluded.
Brutality is by no means inherent
in football. For that matter, rough
play wins no games. Yet we must
confess that brutality ia too often
present, brutality criminal and
beastly. This indicates the presence
of the mucker, —a type of man the
very opposite of that which it is
the business of the University to
discover and develop.
There has been much discussion
of the possibility of improving the
game of football by making it more
interesting, by making it leßB dan
gerous, and by excluding the possi
bility of muckerism. As to the
first and second of these matters
the writer has no right to a final
opinion. The distinguished ath
lete-professors in whose hands the
forming of the game still lies, seem
to be far from any agreement among
themselves.
Beyond a doubt, the elimination
of mass plays and the encourage
ment of end runs, punting, and
rushing through a scattered field
would make the game more inter
esting to spectators. The interest
would also be heightened by a dis
tinctive color of dress on the two
sides, with a big letter on the back
ofeaclimanto distinguish guard,
tackle, quarter-back, and the rest

of the armament, one from an
other.
It is very doubtful whether a
more open game would be less dan
gerous. Most serious accidents oc
cur in the tackling of a swift run
ner in the midst of his interference,
the very play which is most inter
esting to the spectators.
As matters are, the game is too
beefy. There is too great a pre
mium on mere muscular force and
too much stress on the ability to
hammer a weak place in the line,
until at last it gives way through
Bheer exhaustion.
The remedies for actual brutality
or "dirty football" are mainly two:
the direct penalty, and the elimi
nation through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty
men who make games "dirty." The
direct remedy is in the hands of
the umpires. This remedy is never
sure enough, for umpires do not see
everything and sometimes do not
try to. There are umpires who will
think twice before ruling out a
member of a powerful team, on
whose good will future chances for
umpiring may depend. Moreover,
the penalty is not severe enough.
Dirty play at football stands in the
same category as cheating at cards.
It shows the offender to be a cad,
a mucker, a thief, who has no rights
in the presence of gentlemen. To
be convicted of dirty football should
bar the person in question from all
future intercollegiate games. That
the innocent might not suffer from
the umpire's bad judgment on the
moment, there should be some sort
of a court of final appeal.
But the proper antidote for
muckerism must rest with the Uni
versity and its relation to its own
athletic sports.
In a recent report the President
of Yale University has stated in
striking phrase that the great
function of the University is the
fixing of standards. By the stand
ards which the University sets all
its activities of whatever sort will
in the long run be affected and de
termined. An institution may be
caught unawares by an outbreak
of parasitic vulgarity. But the
prevalence and persistence of
muckerism in athletic sports or
elsewhere, indicates a "mucker"
college. And in every such case
the final responsibility rests with
the indifference or the vulgarity of
the college faculty; with the low
ness of its standands, or its failure
to fix them at all.
It is a recognized fact that many
members of our most successful
football teams, in fact most of the
men chosen by our experts for an
"All-American" line-up are pro
fessional or semi-profesional ath
letes. That is, they are in the
college, not for education, but for
what they can make out of the
game; taking their pay in cash or
notoriety or both. Through the
ingenuity of non-academic profes
sional coaches, rank outsiders so
