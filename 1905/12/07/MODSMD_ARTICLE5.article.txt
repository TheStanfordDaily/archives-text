# FIRST BASKET-BALL GAME.
## Campus Team Will Play College of Photography To-morrow Night. 
### 
The first basket-ball game of the
semester will be played to-morrow
night in Encina gymnasium at
eight o'clock. The visiting team
will be from the California College
of Photography of Palo Alto. This
team is fast and has a good record,
and the game should be interesting
from start to finish.
The men who have been practic
ing regularly in Encina gymna
sium have developed into fast and
able players, and although nearly
all the squad will be put into the
game the campus team ought to
win because of its superior physi
cal condition.
There will be no charge for ad
mittance, and seats will be arranged
for spectators. Owing to the fact
that so many players will be put
in the game, it is impossible to give
the line-up of the Encina team.
The line-up of the California Col
lege of Photography is as follows:
Brown (capt.), Axtell, forwards;
Trifts, Eggman, guards; Bouldin,
center.
