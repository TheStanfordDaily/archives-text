The affair in Palo Alto last
Tuesday night was unfortunate,
but the aftermath of the affair is
especially to be regretted. Reports
of this kind circulated throughout
the country do not reflect credit
upon Stanford, especially as the
idea is prevalent among many that
the students were entirely to blame.
Such is not the case. In fact the
story of the students concerned
places the blame on the deputies
and their friends, â€”and the word of
the students should not be ques
tioned when pitted against the riff
raff of the town.
The fact that the students were
"jollying" the play is acknowl
edged. It is an open question,
however, whether this ''jollying"
is not the principal reason people
attend shows of the nature given.
But the real question is, Who was
responsible for the trouble that
started? From the accounts which
come from reliable sources it seems
to have been caused by the scum of
Palo Alto, hired by Mullen,
proprietor of the hall. These men,
excluding the chief of police, are
known to be a set of ruffians who
were totally unfit for such a task.
They were looking for a fight, and
several of them, who were partly
intoxicated, were in a mean mood.
These men were the immediate
cause of the fight, by a cowardly at
tack upon a student. There would
not have been any serious trouble
had not men been hired who were to
tally incompetent, and who are
known to be enemies of the stu
dents. The blame should be placed
primarily upon these men.
Many of the men who precipi
tated the trouble are bus drivers,
and one livery stable keeper has
shown himself to he anything but
a friend of the students. It is now
the duty of etery student to find
out who these men are and to boy
cott them, thus showing them that
they cannot wilfully get us into
trouble one day and take our mon
ey the next.
