Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The University witnessed the
spectacle of a patrol wagon,
manned by two members of the
Palo Alto police force and a sheriff
from San Jose, driving through the
campus to arrest various students
accused of participation in the riot
which occurred at the production
of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" laat Tues
day night. Such an event is hu
miliating to the University, and it
behooves us all to examine the
facts in the case before passing any
hasty judgment. The writers of
this communication were present
at the so-called "riot," and believe
that the action of the students was
thoroughly justifiable. A wretched
aggregation of barnstormers, as is
customary at Palo Alto theatricals,
was producing a worn-out play
which richly merited a storm of
post-moriem cats and venerable
eggs. On such an occasion it was
inevitable that there should be
hooting and jeering; indeed, the
entire profits on most Palo Alto
sliowb are due to the fact that the
population attends them with the
sole desire of seeing the ensuing
"rough house." These would have
been nothing worse than a few
yells and a little "joshing" had not
trouble been precipitated by armed
ruffians deputized for the evening
against the wishes of the chief of
police at the request of the man
agement. An assault upon a Stan
ford student by bus drivers, a
horse doctor, a mule skinner, and
a drayman, arrayed with clubs and
wagon spokes and saturated with
bad rum, would inevitably provoke
a riot. The students of the Uni
versity would be beneath contempt
had they been so spiritless as to
allow these thugs to continue oper
ations unmolested. That these
facts are not overdrawn will be
vouched for by every man present
at the performance. The Palo Alto
marshall himself admits that all
the trouble was caused by the be
sotted and filthy blackguard who
acted as deputy for the occasion.
How long will the students of
the University allow themselves to
be abused and insulted by the
parasitical thugs that infest the
streets of Palo Alto after {lark?
Were it not for the University there
would be no town, and we are at
least entitled to some consideration.
If a student commits an offence,
let him be arrested by a regular
and reputable officer, and not be
throttled and mauled by an Italian
drayman. Every student should
refrain from attending further per
formances at a hall which places
armed thug* on guard, and from
further patronizing that little Eng
lish bus driver who was not a
deputy, but who nevertheless yelled
"Soak 'em, Soak 'em!" They
should demand that the stables
which employ these men send out
other drivers if they wish the pat
ronage of the students.
