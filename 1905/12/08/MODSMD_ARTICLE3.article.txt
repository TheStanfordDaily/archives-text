# BAND WILL GIVE PLAY
## COMEDY WILL BE PRESENTED IN APRIL. Committee Chosen to Arrange for Performance on Night of Field-Day. 
### 
The University Band is arrang
ing through Manager L. W. Cutler,
'06, to present a standard comedy
on April 21, 1906, in Assembly
Hall. A committee chosen from
members of the band has been
selected to supervise the prepara
tions, as follows: R. U. Fitting,'o6,
chairman, N. F. Bradley, '06, A.
Ames, '06, D. N. Richards, '07, and
H. C. Keesling, '08.
The play will be given in order
to raise money to pay a debt owed
to the student body. A year ago
the band purchased new uniforms,
advancing part of the money and
borrowing the rest from Manager
Barrett to pay for the suite. Some
new band instruments were also
purchased by Band-leader M. H.
Thorpe, '05 at the same time, so
that the sum owed to the student
body is considerable.
The committee in charge of the
play will select the cast from the
student body. The date chosen for
the performance is the night of the
intercollegiate field-day.
