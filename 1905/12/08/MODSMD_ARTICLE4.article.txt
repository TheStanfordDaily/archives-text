# "COLLEGE WIDOW "MAY COME.
## Sword and Sandals Trying to Have Geo. Ade's Production Given in Assembly Hall. 
### 
E. R. May, '06, president of
Sword and Sandals, has written to
the management of the company
playing George Ade's "College
Widow'' in San Francisco, asking
if they would consider the propo
sition of giving a performance in
Assembly Hall. The company was
billed to be in San Francisco for
two weeks, December 4th to 18th,
but it is understood that they will
remain a week longer. As the
tickets have not gone on sale for
this last week, the members of
Sword and Sandals decided to get
them here for one night if possible.
The staging and scenery used in
the production is comparatively
simple, so there would be no diffi
culty in giving the production in
Assembly Hall. So far no answer
to the letter has been received.
