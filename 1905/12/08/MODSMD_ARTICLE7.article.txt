# ACTION REAFFIRMED
## ATHLETIC COMMITTEE TO GIVE " S " TO VARSITY CREWS. Recommends that the Student Body Assume Full Management of Boating. 
### 
The Athletic Committee held its
third meeting last night, and re
affirmed its previous action of
granting the Varsity emblem to
members of all future Varsity
crews. It was also decided that
boating should continue on the list
of recognized intercollegiate sports,
and the recommendation was made
to the Executive Committee that
the student body assume full
management of boating. Those
present at last night's meeting were
E. P. Stott, '07, J. C. Macfarland,
'07, D. D. Sales, '06, E. A. Cunha,
'06, R. H. Lachmund, '06, C. A.
Beardsley, '06, K. L. Fenton, '08,
F. R. Lanagan, '08, and Manager
Barrett. A. J. Chalmers,'o7, L. G.
Russell, '06, and P. M. Davis, '08,
were absent.
The meeting was called for the
purpose of considering the motion
passed at the session of November
23d, to the effect "That at the next
meeting of this organization it
shall consider the advisability of
ecommending to our intercollegi
ate representatives that at their
meeting with the California repre
sentatives they consider the advisa
bility of the discontinuance of
boating as an intercollegiate sport."
Had the committee taken such an
action, it would practically have
rescinded its former action of vot
ing Varsity emblems to the crews.
The motion was discussed for
over an hour, and three plans of
action were outlined by various
members of the committee. The
first was to strike boating out from
the intercollegiate agreement; the
second was to take it over and
grant the emblem to this year's
crew only on condition that it de
feated California; and third, to re
affirm their previous action and
grant the emblem unconditionally.
To bring the matter to a head,
Sales moved, seconded by Lach
mund, that the committee recom
mend that boating be stricken
from the intercollegiate agreement.
The motion was lost by a vote of
four to three, the members voting
as follows: ayes —Stott, Lachmund,
Macfarland; noes —Sales, Lanagan,
Barrett, Beardsley; Fenton not vot
ing.
It was then unanimously voted
that the Athletic Committee
recommend to the Executive Com
mittee that the student body as
sume full management of boating.
This matter will come up before
the Executive Committee next Wed
nesday night. Should that body
pass on it favorably, the student
body will assume the Boat Club
debt of about $500 and will take
over the assets of the club, which
are conservatively estimated at
$700, consisting of boating para
phernalia and property at Redwood
City.
It was finally moved by Barrett
and seconded by Beardsley that
the committee reaffirm its previous

action of voting Varsity emblems
to the members of this year's crew
and all future crews. The motion
was passed without opposition, no
one voting against it, and four
members voting aye.
