# FIRST ARREST MADE
## COX, '07, IS TAKEN INTO CUS. TODY BY CHIEF HILL. Charged with Disturbing' the Peace by Participating in Mullen's Hall. 
### 
The riot in Mullen's Hall found
its first victim to-day, when A. B.
Cox, '07, was arrested by Chief of
Police Hill at 11 o'clock this morn
ing. Cox was taken into custody,
and surrendered without making
any disturbance, as he had been
seen and positively identified aB be
ing at the riot by Chief Hill.Cox was
arrested under one of the John Doe
warrants for disturbing the peace,
and was arraigned before Justice of
the Peace S. \V. Charles. He was
released on his own recognizance,
and his preliminary hearing was
set for 4 o'clock this afternoon.
The penalty for disturbing the
peace is not very serious, and Cox
does not stand in any very grave
danger of receiving a heavy sen
tence. Justice Charles stated that
in all probability the hearing this
afternoon would be devoted only to
hearing the prisoner's plea.
When arrested, Cox acknowl
edged that he had been present at
the riot, but stated that he had
taken no active part in the trouble,
and that he was only trying to
quiet some of the disturbers. The
warrant on which he was arrested
was sworn to by Dan Mullen, pro
prietor of the hall where the fight
took place. Chief Hill says that
while there will probably be other
arrests, he is not planning to
make any more descents on the
campus with a view to making
wholesale captures.
Justice Charles stated late this
afternoon that Cox was to be tried
before a jury. The impanelling of
this jury will hold the result of the
hearing until too late for to-night's
issue of the Daily Palo Alto.
Charles said, however, that he
would make every effort to try the
case to-night.
Cox entered Stanford in January
1904, and played a substitute
guard on the '08 Freshman team;
this year he was first substitute for
center on the Varsity.
