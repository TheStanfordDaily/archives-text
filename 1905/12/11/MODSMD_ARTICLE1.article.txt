# GEER WINS BONNHEIM
## AWARDED PRIZE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. Four Speakers Discuss Ethical Subject.â€”Judges Arrive at Decision with Difficulty. 
### 
Charles Lester Geer, '07, of Camp
bell, California, was awarded the
Bonnheim prize of one hundred and
fifty dollars last Saturday night for
the best presentation, in competi
tion with three others, of his ideas
on "The Monopolistic Control of
Industry."
The contest was held in the
chapel, and besides the winning
speaker D. M. Greer, '00, J. E.
Stewart, '07, and J. W. Mott, '07,
also participated. The board of
judges was composed of President
David Starr Jordan, Professor J.
M. Stillman of the Chemistry de
partment and Professor A. T. Mur
ray of the Greek department. Pro
fessor C. A. Duniway of the De
partment of History acted as pre
siding officer.
No one of the contestants evi
denced a superior knowledge of the
subject at hand over the others
and, in fact, the merits of the re
spective speakers were so nearly
equal that the judges were unable
to come to a decision for nearly
half an hour. Dr. Jordan in giv
ing the decision congratulated all
the speakers on the intelligence
with which they had treated the
subject, and 6aid that he only re
gretted that there were not prizes
for all. The board of judges, he
said, being divided in opinion as to
the best speaker, were unable to
come to a unanimous decision, but
after calculating the merits of the
speakers on as mathematical a basis
as possible they had decided that
the premium should go to Geer.
This being the first Bonnheim
contest at the University, consider
able interest was taken in the event.
The discussion did not take the
form of a debate. Each speaker
merely presented his views in the
twenty minutes allotted him on the
general subject of monopoly and
its ethics.
The four speakers, Stewart, Greer,
Geer and Mott,dealt almost entirely
with the trust question of modern
times, tracing its growth, pointing
out its evils, and suggesting reme
dies.
Geer, the winning speaker, was
undoubtedly given the decision be
cause of his comprehensive presen
tation of the situation confronting
the nation to-day. He devoted his
entire attention to a discussion of
capitalistic monopolies. He first
declared the causes for their exis
tence and their flourishing growth.
He concluded by an ethical dis
cussion of the results of trust for
mation on the laborer, the raw
producer, and the consumer. The
Standard Oil Company furnished
him with a concrete example,
around which he enlarged on the
various points of his discussion.
