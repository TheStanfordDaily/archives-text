The members of the Athletic
Committee who voted to sustain
their action to give the boating men
their "8" unconditionally are justi
fiable only upon each man having
an honest conviction that he was
expressing the will of the student
body who elected him to represent
them.
Now that the "S" has been
granted it will only be justified in
the minds of the student body if it
is possible to provide for the ex
penses neccesary to place boating
on a firm basis. The Athletic
Committee has recommended that
boating be taken over by the stu
dent body. The question now lies
with the Executive Committee. If
the plan is feasible they will un
doubtedly adopt it and boating
will in time be raised to a plane
where the men will deserve their
emblem.
