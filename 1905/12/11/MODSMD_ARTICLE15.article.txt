The action of the University of
California in selecting a graduate
coach comes as an agreeable sur
prise. Among the football players
developed by the State University
there are undoubtedly men who
are as capable to act as coaches as
any men that the East can furnish.
Moreover, the graduate coach of
the two California institutions has
been schooled in clean football, and
it is clean football that he will
teach to the undergraduates of his
Alma Mater. A graduate will
have the interests of his university
at heart. California is to be con
gratuated.
