### 
Professor E. P. Cubberley of the
Education department, who was
summoned East a few days ago on
account of the serious illness of his
father, returned to the University
on Saturday, as his father's condi
tion was thought to have decidedly
improved. But word reached him
yesterday that his father's death
had occurred that morning. Pro
fessor Cubberley will not be able to
reach his Eastern home in time for
the funeral, so he will remain on
the campus.
