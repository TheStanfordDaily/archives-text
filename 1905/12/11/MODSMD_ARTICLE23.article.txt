## California Poet Will Address English Club on Next Wednesday Evening. 
### 
Charles A. Keeler,one of the best
known of California poets and writ
ers and famous as an expert on
birds, will speak before the mem
bers of the English Club at the
Delta Tau Delta house on Wednes
day evening. His subject will be
"A Guild of California Letters,"
and there have been so many re
quests for him to say something
about birds that he will probably
speak on this interesting topic for
a little while.
Charles A. Keeler is one of the
younger generation of Western
writers of the vigorous type of
Charles F. Lummis, and like the
latter, has lived among the scenes
and things he writes about. He
has traveled extensively in Alaska,
the South Seas and the Antipodes,
and the result of his travels has
found permanent form in many
volumes. He is also the author of
a number of volumes upon birds,
his keen knowledge of which has
won him a directorship of the
California Academy of Sciences.
