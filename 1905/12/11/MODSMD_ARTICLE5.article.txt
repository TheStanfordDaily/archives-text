# GRADUATE COACH SELECTED.
## University of California Adopts Old System.â€”O.N. Taylor, '94, Selected. 
### 
At the semiannual meeting of
the associated students of the Uni
versity of California, Oscar N. Tay
lor, a graduate with the class of
'94, and one of the best full-backs
in his time, was selected to coach
the Blue and Gold for the coming
two seasons. It was announced at
the meeting that Taylor had been
chosen the year before to coach, but
did not accept, as he desired to
visit the East and study up on the
game. It was then decided to al
low him to begin in 1906, and
Knibbs and Griffin were secured
for the recent season.
Taylor, who graduated in 1894,
was the first full-back California
had, playing on the first three var
sity teams. After leaving the uni
versity he coached the team of the
Belmont School and met with great
success. W. T. Reid, Jr., was one
of his pupils. Taylor is at present
practicing medicine in the East.
