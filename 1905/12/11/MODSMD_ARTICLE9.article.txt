# DEMANDS JURY TRIAL
## COX PLEADS NOT GUILTY AT PRELIMINARY HEARING. Case Set for To-morrow Morning. Assistant District Attorney Will Prosecute. 
### 
A. B. Cox, '07, who was arrested
Friday morning by Chief Hill and
charged with participating in the
Mullen's Hall riot, will be tried to
morrow morning. Cox was ar
raigned before Justice S. W.
Charles at 5 o'clock on Friday
afternoon, and plead "not guilty"
to the charge of disturbing the
peace. He retained Walter Rogers
of Palo Alto as his counsel, and de
manded a jury trial.
This necessitated the summoning
of a jury, and Justice Charles
therefore set the case for 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning in Jordan's
Hall. A venire of thirty-five jury
men has been drawn, and from
these the trial jury will be impan
eled. Assistant District Attorney
J. P. Sex of San Jose will prosecute
the case, while Rogers will appear
for Cox. Chief Hill will probably
be the star witness for the prosecu
tion, and testimony will also be
taken from the other deputies who
were present at the riot.
Attorney Rogers stated to-day
that he had at least seven repu
table witnesses who would testify
to Cox's movements during the en
tire evening, and while he expects
that his client may be forced to
make some admissions, he does not
believe that they will tend to dam
age his case. The defense will rest
mainly on the fact that none of
Cox's actions were done in any at
tempt to maliciously inflict injury,
and that he was endeavoring to
quell the riot and not to incite it.
Although the case is to be called
at 10 o'clock both sideß fear that
there will be considerable difficulty
in obtaining a jury.
