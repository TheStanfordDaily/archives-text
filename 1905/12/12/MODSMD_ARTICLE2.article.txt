# MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS.
## Faculty Athletic Committees Would Abolish or Greatly Modify Football. 
### 
Pursuant to a call by President
Wheeler and President Jordan the
Faculty Athletic Committees of the
University of California and Stan
ford met yesterday afternoon at the
University Club in San Francisco
to discusß football and to eradicate
some of the existing evils in foot
ball. Besides the presidents of the
two universities there were present
Col. George C. Edwards, Albert W.
Whitney, and Harry B. Torrey,
constituting the University of Cali
fornia faculty athletic committee,
Professors W. F. Durand and W. F.
Snow, of the Stanford Faculty Ath
letic Committee. The joint com
mittee recommended that hereafter
California football be conducted
either on the lines of the English
Rugby game or on a modification
of the American game. The reso
lutions adopted declared in effect
against the mass play. The reso
lutions as adopted at the meet
ing yesterday are as follows:
Resolved, by the Joint Athletic
Committee of the University of
California and the Leland Stanford
Junior University, that we recom
mend to the faculties of the two
universities in question that the
intercollegiate football contest shall
be no longer held under the regu
lations of the present Football
Rules Committee. We reccom
mend as a substitute the prepent
English Rugby game, or else the
present American game with such
modifications as shall promise to
eliminate the existing evils.
Resolved, That we ask the fol
lowing gentlemen to act as advisory
members to aid us in framing a
final decision: James F. Lanagan,
Dr. Frank Simpson, Dr. A. B.
Spaulding, Prentiss Gray, James
Force, A. J. Chalmers, E. P. Stott,
Roy Elliott and W. T. Reid, Jr.
The committee appointed by the
Joint Athletic Committee to act as
advisory members of the athletic
committees contains the names of
four Stanford men. They are,
Head-Coach Lanagan, '00, Dr. A.
B. Spaulding, '06, A. J. Chalmers,
'07, and E. P. Stott, '07, captain of
next year's Varsity football team.
President Jordan made the fol
lowing statement regarding the
meeting yesterday:
"Please do not quote me as an
expert on the game, for I only
know it as a side-line observer.
Yesterday we were legislating pri
marily for the preparatory school
players, and secondarily with the
idea of improving the present
game. Football, as played between
California and Stanford, is remark
ably clean, and only once in the
past six years have I witnessed a
flagrant case of brutality, and there
has not been very much rough
playing.
"I shall offer few suggestions for
the improvement of the game, as
we are depending on our commit
tee of experts to make the neces
sary alterations. However, rough
playing and the opportunity for

rough playing must be eliminated.
The game has been brought into
disgrace and disrepute by foul tac
tics, and the opportunity for such
playing must be eradicated. Such
fouls as have brought disgrace to
Eastern football are prohibited ab
solutely in the prize ring, and the
great college game should be as
clean as pugilism.
"There is nothing sacred about
the mass play, and even its invent
or, Walter Camp, the father of
football, has attempted in vain
to either modify or abolish it. The
proposition to adopt Rugby foot
ball is not so amazing when one
considers that practically this form
of the game was played by Stan
ford and California little more
than a decade ago. The first modi
fication of the game came when the
experts decided-that interference
was necessary, and we have prob
ably seen the ultimate perfection
of this play under Lanagan's
coaching.
"The evolution in the game soon
resulted in the mass play, which is
the primary cause of the present
crusade against football. This
play requires a degree of prepara
tion and physical training out of
all proportion to the actual results
attained. And out of it has grown
the chance for the foul play which
has undermined the sport. Knee
ing and slugging have become very
common on Eastern teams, and
the remedies for these offenses have
not proven adequate.
"1 would suggest a ten-yard pen
alty for unnecessary roughness, and
perpetual suspension for the foul
player. It is pretty generally ac
knowledged by experts that the
open game offers as many, if not
more, chances of injury than mass
plays, but it must be remembered
that injuries sustained from open
field work are not so likely to be
fatal as those resulting from crush
ing line attacks.
"And it is undoubtedly true that
the immmature preparatory school
player is more liable to injury
from mass plays than the trained
college athlete. Hence our desire
to amend the game, for I think it
will be readily conceded that the
proneness of the preparatory
school lad to imitate his college
brother will prevent the adoption
of a different game by the second
ary schools.
"The National Football Rules
Committee is not a representative
body, and there is no reason why
the Pacific Coast should not legis
late for itself. I believe, however,
that the Rules Committee lias been
scared from its self-complacent at
titude, and if the rules are suffic
iently revised to eliminate the
present objectionable features of
the game I see no reason why our
two universities should not abide
by them. If not, we can play a
game of our own devising, or sub
stitute Rugby football for the pres
ent game. It is quite probable

that the other colleges and schools
of the Pacific Coast will follow the
lead of Stanford and California.
At any rate, when they play us on
our grounds they will be compelled
to play our form of the game. I
will euggest the formation of Rug
by elevens among the students as
an experiment to test the interest
that form of football would create.
Such teams would require little
training and the games could be
played next semester."

Yesterday we were legislating pri
marily for the preparatory school
players, and secondarily with the
idea of improving the present
game. Football, as played between
California and Stanford, is remark
ably clean, and only once in the
past six years have I witnessed a
flagrant case of brutality, and there
has not been very much rough
playing.
"I shall offer few suggestions for
the improvement of the game, as
we are depending on our commit
tee of experts to make the neces
sary alterations. However, rough
playing and the opportunity for

rough playing must be eliminated.
The game has been brought into
disgrace and disrepute by foul tac
tics, and the opportunity for such
playing must be eradicated. Such
fouls as have brought disgrace to
Eastern football are prohibited ab
solutely in the prize ring, and the
great college game should be as
clean as pugilism.
"There is nothing sacred about
the mass play, and even its invent
or, Walter Camp, the father of
football, has attempted in vain
to either modify or abolish it. The
proposition to adopt Rugby foot
ball is not so amazing when one
considers that practically this form
of the game was played by Stan
ford and California little more
than a decade ago. The first modi
fication of the game came when the
experts decided-that interference
was necessary, and we have prob
ably seen the ultimate perfection
of this play under Lanagan's
coaching.
"The evolution in the game soon
resulted in the mass play, which is
the primary cause of the present
crusade against football. This
play requires a degree of prepara
tion and physical training out of
all proportion to the actual results
attained. And out of it has grown
the chance for the foul play which
has undermined the sport. Knee
ing and slugging have become very
common on Eastern teams, and
the remedies for these offenses have
not proven adequate.
"1 would suggest a ten-yard pen
alty for unnecessary roughness, and
perpetual suspension for the foul
player. It is pretty generally ac
knowledged by experts that the
open game offers as many, if not
more, chances of injury than mass
plays, but it must be remembered
that injuries sustained from open
field work are not so likely to be
fatal as those resulting from crush
ing line attacks.
"And it is undoubtedly true that
the immmature preparatory school
player is more liable to injury
from mass plays than the trained
college athlete. Hence our desire
to amend the game, for I think it
will be readily conceded that the
proneness of the preparatory
school lad to imitate his college
brother will prevent the adoption
of a different game by the second
ary schools.
"The National Football Rules
Committee is not a representative
body, and there is no reason why
the Pacific Coast should not legis
late for itself. I believe, however,
that the Rules Committee lias been
scared from its self-complacent at
titude, and if the rules are suffic
iently revised to eliminate the
present objectionable features of
the game I see no reason why our
two universities should not abide
by them. If not, we can play a
game of our own devising, or sub
stitute Rugby football for the pres
ent game. It is quite probable

that the other colleges and schools
of the Pacific Coast will follow the
lead of Stanford and California.
At any rate, when they play us on
our grounds they will be compelled
to play our form of the game. I
will euggest the formation of Rug
by elevens among the students as
an experiment to test the interest
that form of football would create.
Such teams would require little
training and the games could be
played next semester."
Pursuant to a call by President
Wheeler and President Jordan the
Faculty Athletic Committees of the
University of California and Stan
ford met yesterday afternoon at the
University Club in San Francisco
to discusß football and to eradicate
some of the existing evils in foot
ball. Besides the presidents of the
two universities there were present
Col. George C. Edwards, Albert W.
Whitney, and Harry B. Torrey,
constituting the University of Cali
fornia faculty athletic committee,
Professors W. F. Durand and W. F.
Snow, of the Stanford Faculty Ath
letic Committee. The joint com
mittee recommended that hereafter
California football be conducted
either on the lines of the English
Rugby game or on a modification
of the American game. The reso
lutions adopted declared in effect
against the mass play. The reso
lutions as adopted at the meet
ing yesterday are as follows:
Resolved, by the Joint Athletic
Committee of the University of
California and the Leland Stanford
Junior University, that we recom
mend to the faculties of the two
universities in question that the
intercollegiate football contest shall
be no longer held under the regu
lations of the present Football
Rules Committee. We reccom
mend as a substitute the prepent
English Rugby game, or else the
present American game with such
modifications as shall promise to
eliminate the existing evils.
Resolved, That we ask the fol
lowing gentlemen to act as advisory
members to aid us in framing a
final decision: James F. Lanagan,
Dr. Frank Simpson, Dr. A. B.
Spaulding, Prentiss Gray, James
Force, A. J. Chalmers, E. P. Stott,
Roy Elliott and W. T. Reid, Jr.
The committee appointed by the
Joint Athletic Committee to act as
advisory members of the athletic
committees contains the names of
four Stanford men. They are,
Head-Coach Lanagan, '00, Dr. A.
B. Spaulding, '06, A. J. Chalmers,
'07, and E. P. Stott, '07, captain of
next year's Varsity football team.
