Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Having read the communication
concerning the trouble which oc
curred at the production of "Uncle
Tom's Cabin," I would like to add
my view of the matter. As my
seat was next to that of the student
who was first assaulted, I saw the
whole affair from beginning to end.
This student bad been taking no
part in the "joshing" of the show,
but as he was a small fellow and
sat on the back row, where he could
easily be attacked from behind, he
was made the object of the first as
sault. A big ruffian coming up be
hind him seized him by the collar
with his left hand while he swung
a heavy wagon spoke with his right,
and dragging him bodily over the
back of the seat started for the
door. The cry "Stanford men"
rang out, and in five seconds every
Stanford man was in the back of
the room, and every deputy was on
the stairway outside asking to be
let in again. No class of men are
more reasonable than college stu
dents, but every college man de
mands a square deal and fair play.
After this first rush the crowd
settled down again, but our friends,
the deputies, brought back their
courage, and raised their spirits by
putting down spirits. In the sec
ond attack they used their clubs
freely, hitting men full in the face
with heavy loaded billies and other
weapons, such a 8 wagon spokes and
heavy canes, the effect of which
would be to leave a man disfigured,
for life. One student was badly
cut,and that the students did not
vent their just rage upon the perpe
trators of this deed at once was due
to the fact that one of their number
tried to settle things peaceably.
Since then the police with their
usual sagacity have arrested this
same man.
Every Stanford man is a lover of
fair play, and if there are fines to
be paid, every man who was pres
ent that night should pay his
share. 1 believe that every Stan
ford man is willing to pay his share
whether he was present or not, for
the trouble was caused by the res
cue of a Stanford student and every
Stanford man should be interested
in that. The men who started this
trouble are bus drivers; and the
man who hired them, and after
wards swore out warrants for ar
rests, is a livery stable keeper, who
is not a friend of the students, al
though he owes everything he has
to them. His bus has his name on
it. It will be easy to find out who
his drivers are. It will not be
necessary to hire horses or rigs
from him. There are other con
cerns which haul baggage. There
are other men who advertise in our
college publications. Look and see
if you can find his ad. in this paper.
Many of the girls have been riding
in his bus because the driver takes
them down to Waverly street.
Here is a chance to show your loy
alty and walk the few yards
farther. Let us once for all show
these people that the students have
some rights, even from those whom
they support by their patronage.
The receipts of this livery man have
already fallen off. Some of his
drivers admit that they have not
made their expenses since last
Tuesday night.
Another thing which we should
notice is the accounts in the papers.
Did the paper you read give the
impression that the students were
a lot of cut-throats and thieves?
A local paper, which owes its short
existence entirely to the fact that
the University has built up the
town, published such an account
with glowing headlines. An ac
count which may be copied all over
the country. Every student knows
how to show his or her disapproval
of these things, and it is now up to
us to remind these people that we
have some rights to be considered.

After this first rush the crowd
settled down again, but our friends,
the deputies, brought back their
courage, and raised their spirits by
putting down spirits. In the sec
ond attack they used their clubs
freely, hitting men full in the face
with heavy loaded billies and other
weapons, such a 8 wagon spokes and
heavy canes, the effect of which
would be to leave a man disfigured,
for life. One student was badly
cut,and that the students did not
vent their just rage upon the perpe
trators of this deed at once was due
to the fact that one of their number
tried to settle things peaceably.
Since then the police with their
usual sagacity have arrested this
same man.
Every Stanford man is a lover of
fair play, and if there are fines to
be paid, every man who was pres
ent that night should pay his
share. 1 believe that every Stan
ford man is willing to pay his share
whether he was present or not, for
the trouble was caused by the res
cue of a Stanford student and every
Stanford man should be interested
in that. The men who started this
trouble are bus drivers; and the
man who hired them, and after
wards swore out warrants for ar
rests, is a livery stable keeper, who
is not a friend of the students, al
though he owes everything he has
to them. His bus has his name on
it. It will be easy to find out who
his drivers are. It will not be
necessary to hire horses or rigs
from him. There are other con
cerns which haul baggage. There
are other men who advertise in our
college publications. Look and see
if you can find his ad. in this paper.
Many of the girls have been riding
in his bus because the driver takes
them down to Waverly street.
Here is a chance to show your loy
alty and walk the few yards
farther. Let us once for all show
these people that the students have
some rights, even from those whom
they support by their patronage.
The receipts of this livery man have
already fallen off. Some of his
drivers admit that they have not
made their expenses since last
Tuesday night.
Another thing which we should
notice is the accounts in the papers.
Did the paper you read give the
impression that the students were
a lot of cut-throats and thieves?
A local paper, which owes its short
existence entirely to the fact that
the University has built up the
town, published such an account
with glowing headlines. An ac
count which may be copied all over
the country. Every student knows
how to show his or her disapproval
of these things, and it is now up to
us to remind these people that we
have some rights to be considered.
