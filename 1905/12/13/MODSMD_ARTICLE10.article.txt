# OFFER PLACE TO ROW
## SAN DIEGO WANTS REGATTA FOR NEXT SPRING. Club Would Provide Training Quarters for Both Crews for Final Practice. 
### 
The San Diego Rowing Club has
made a proposition to Manager
Barrett asking to have Stanford
come to San Diego and row its
annual race against the University
of California there. The plan in
cludes having both university
crews in San Diego about two weeks
before the regatta, allowing them
to finish their training upon the
course which they will row over.
Although the club has made no
definite proposition, it is evident
that their offer would he very lib
eral if the Cardinal oarsmen would
consent to make the trip. The
plan also includes a track meet to
be held in San Diego about the
same time, in which they wish to
have the Stanford track team take
part.
Nothing definite has been done
about the matter. It is possible,
however, that the Stanford crew
may row the San Diego club there
if the more elaborate plan of an
intercollegiate regatta fails.
