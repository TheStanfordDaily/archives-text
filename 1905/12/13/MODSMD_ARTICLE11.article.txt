# "College Widow" Will Not Come.
## 
### 
A letter has been received from
the management of the "College
Widow" company in San Francisco
stating that the time of the
company is entirely booked,
and that it will be impossible
to give a performance on the Stan
ford campus.
The letter was written in response
to an invitation to produce the
"College Widow" here under the
auspices of Sword and Sandals.
The manager suggested that a
Stanford night be arranged either
for some performance before the
close of the San Francisco engage
ment, which ends December 23d,
or at San Jose, where the company
will play on January 3d. Stan
ford colors and college yells would
be introduced with other hits of a
local nature at such a performance.
It is not probable, however, that
this can be arranged, because of
the nearness to the examinations
and close of the semester.
