The arrest of one of the students
concerned in the recent disturbance
in Mullen's Hall was shown by hie
acquittal yesterday to have been
another blunder of the parties who
caused,and are now prosecuting, the
affair. The notoriety that has been
given the entire affair has undoubt
edly hurt the reputation of the
Stanford student body. That the
incident would not have occurred
if the quelling of the disturbance
had been attempted in a rational
manner seems evident. It also
would not have been given the pub
licity it has, if it had not been dealt
with in a foolhardy manner. A
large number of students have
realized this and have also realized
who the man is that is largely re
sponsible for the affair. They have
expressed their disapproval by not
patronizing hie livery business.
But there are other students, a large
per cent of whom are women, who
could and should show their dis
like of his methods in this way, but
have not done so.
