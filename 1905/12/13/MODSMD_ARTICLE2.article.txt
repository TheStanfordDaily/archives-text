# Graduate Club Defers Meeting.
## 
### 
Owing to the stress of University
activities, and the lateness of the
date, the executive committee of the
Graduate Club has deferred calling
a meeting of the club until next
semester. Several times the execu
tive committee has met, but some
thing has always intervened to pre
vent a meeting of the club. It is
now anticipated that the club will
come together about the 26th of
January, at which time it is hoped
that the graduate students who are
new to the University will attend.
