# MAY PLAY RUGBY HERE
## NEW ZEALAND TEAM WILL PROBABLY GIVE EXHIBITIONS. Prospect of Having Professional Cracks Play Here Causing Favorable Comment.

The probability that the New
Zealand Rugby football players
will give exhibition matches in
California upon their homeward
trip from England, where they
have been playing for some time,
has caused considerable talk about
the campuß, in Berkeley, and in
San Francisco, where the principal
enthusiasts of the game reside.
President Jordan is enthusiastic
over the possibility of inducing the
New Zealand team to come by way
of California. He expressed the
hope that the student body would
extend every courtesy to the visit
ing team, in order that the inter
esting experiment can take place.
Head - Coach Lanagan, '00, is
as anxious as President Jordan to
see the game played here by the
professionals from New Zealand.
He said: "It is a splendid idea, and
I highly approve of it. It will
give every one a chance to see just
what sort of game Rugby is. Many
of the people now discussing it
have never seen it played, and an
exhibition game by the New Zea
land experts would probably open
their eyes."
Captain-elect Stott, '07, is also
in favor of having the New Zealand
ers play at Stanford. He said:
"Such an exhibition would provide
a splendid opportunity for a com
parison between Rugby and inter
collegiate football, and I hope that
the matches can be secured. The
games will derive additional value
from the fact that the New Zealand
team plays championship ball. I
am not greatly impressed with the
value of Rugby, and I expect the
projected matches either to con
firm or entirely upset my convic
tions."
Manager Barrett, '04, will prob
ably offer substantial inducements
to persuade the experts from New
Zealand to give an exhibition game
here.
