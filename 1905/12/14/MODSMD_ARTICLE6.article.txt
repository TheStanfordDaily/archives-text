# BOTANIST GETS POSITION.
## Dr. Olsson-Seffert o Do Experimental Work on Plantations in Mexico. 
### 
Dr. Pehr Olsson-Seffer, for the
last two years an instructor in the
department of Systematic Botany,
has been selected to take charge of
a new botanical station in tropical
Mexico, and will sail with the next
steamer.
The object of the station, with
which will be connected a chemical
laboratory and a meteorological
bureau, is to investigate the differ
ent problems connected with culti
vation of rubber and coffee. Twelve
large plantations belonging to the
Hidalgo and La Zacualpa Com
panies, with headquarters in San
Francisco, will comprise the field
of work, of which Dr. Olsson-Seffer
will be scientific director. Nine of
these plantations are devoted en
tirely to coffee, the rest to rubber
planting. They are all under the
general managership of Mr. O. H.
Harrison, the most progressive
planter in Mexico.
The establishment of a perma
nent scientific station for study of
the rubber culture promises a new
era in this important industry. Dr.
Olsson-Seffer has been busy for the
last few weeks shipping the neces
sary equipment for the laboratory.
