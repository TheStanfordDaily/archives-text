# BOATING TAKEN OVER
## SPORT WILL BE MANAGED WITH STUDENT BODY FUNDS. Present Debt of Boat Club Not Assumed.—Basket-ball Team Granted Name. 
### 
The Executive Committee met
last night and took action on sev
eral matters of importance. After
some discussion and careful con
sideration the committee voted to
recognize and take up boating as a
regular University sport. It is to
be placed on exactly the same
basis as football, baseball or track.
This means that it will be financed
by the student body—just as these
other sports —and the probable en
gagement of a coach. It will be on
an equal footing with the other
college sports in all respects. How
ever, before taking this action the
committee made one condition.
This was a provision that thestudent
body should not take over the
present Boat Club debt of $400.
With this action, boating is now
firmly established as a regular
sport and it must be carried on by
student body funds.
The granting of the name Stan
ford to the basket-ball team was
another action of importance taken
by the committee last night. This
team has previously been known as
the campus team or the Encina
gymnasium team. Now that it
is thoroughly organized and has a
competent coach the committee
considered it advisable to grant the
request made by the basket-ball
men some time ago.
H. E. Savage, '06, a member of
the Executive Committee, handed
in his resignation, as he will not
return to college next semester.
His successor will be elected at the
meeting of the committee next
week. Savage was also a member
of the Guild Board, and his depar
ture left a vacancy there. The
Guild Board sent in th« names of
three men, one of whom was to be
elected to fill this vacancy, and E.
A. Austin, '06, was chosen at the
meeting last night.
