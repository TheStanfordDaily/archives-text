# COLLEGE SETTLEMENT.
## Rev. D. Charles Gardner Asks Cooperation of San Francisco Alumni. 
### 
The Rev. D.Charles Gardner has
addressed the following invitation
to over one hundred alumni of the
University who are residents of
San Francisco:
"You are cordially invited to at
tend a meeting of representative
Stanford Alumni, to be held at the
Occidental Hotel on Saturday, De
cember 16th, at 8 p.m., to consider
the founding of a Stanford College
Settlement in San Francisco.
Yours faithfully,
D. Charles Gardner."
No plan has yet been developed.
The principle underlying the idea
is to establish in San Francisco h
Stanford College Settlement, that
alumni and undergraduates of the
University may do something to
help their fellow men, and thus
perpetuate the idea of the Univer
sity.
