# WILL TRAVEL ABROAD
## NEWCOMER AND HEATH TO GO AROUND WORLD. Members of English and Zoology Departments on Leave of Absence for Semester. 
### 
Professors A. G. Newcomer of
the English department and H.
Heath of the Zoology department
will be on leave of absence next
semester, and will spend their va
cations abroad. Both expect to
travel around the world, Professor
Newcomer going west and Professor
Heath east.
Although he has not definitely
determined his route of travel, it is
Professor Newcomer's intention to
spend the majority of his time in
Greece and England, where he will
gather material for his English
work. He will leave early in Feb
ruary and return to the campus
before the opening of the fall semes
ter next year. He is taking the
trip primarily for rest and recrea
tion, and will be accompanied by
his son. r '
Professor Heath will leave the
University on next Wednesday,
first going to New Orleans to attend
the national meeting of the Associ
ation for the Advancement of
Science. After leaving New Or
leans he will spend some time in
visiting the National Museum at
Washington, D. C. He will also
spend some of his time in the Phil
adelphia museum.
On January 27th he will sail
from New York for Naples, where
he will be engaged in research
work for two months. From Naples
he will make a side trip into
Egypt.
From Naples Professor Heath
will sail for Yokohama, Japan, vis
iting on his way Ceylon and other
islands on the Malay Archipelago,
where he will collect specimens and
material for the Stanford Zoology
department. After spending two
months and a half in Japan he will
sail for this country, reaching the
Coast in August.
As no courses were announced to
be given by Professor Newcomer in
the second semester, 1905-06, his
work, so far as it is to be continued,
will be carried on by other mem
bers of the English department.
Professor Heath is now giving two
courses, one of which ends at the
close of the semester. The other
will be conducted next semester by
Mr. W. K. Fisher, assistant in the
Zoology department.
