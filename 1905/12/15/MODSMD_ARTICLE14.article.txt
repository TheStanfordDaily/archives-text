# WILL REQUIRE DEPOSIT.
## Bookstore to Protect Itself Next Semester Against Loss on Orders. 
### 
Owing to the large number of
orders for books which are filled by
the University Bookstore and are
not called for, the management has
decided to require a deposit on all
orders which it accepts. Hereto
fore no deposit has been asked.
The result of this leniency on the
part of the management has been
promiscuous ordering of books, and
leaving the same to stay on the
shelves of the store after they have
arrived. Up to a few weekß ago,
over one hundred books had ac
cumulated at the Bookstore with
out being claimed. In several in
stances practically whole classes
had given orders for text books.
Special pains had been taken to
have such volumes arrive in as
short a time as poseible. Yet the
value of the number uncalled for
has in one case alone amounted to
forty dollars. When the miscel
laneous orders have been added,
the whole collection constitutes a
small library worth about $150.
The management has sometimes
been able to sell these books, but
the loss in general is considerable,
and a deposit must be paid on all
orders after the first of next se
mester. The schedule of charges
has not been arranged, hut it has
been mentioned that twenty-five
cents will be required on books
valued at fifty cents or less, and
that deposits will be in proportion
with the value of books, no deposit
to be less than twenty-five cents.
