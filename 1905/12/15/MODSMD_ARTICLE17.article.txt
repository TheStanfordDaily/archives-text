Manager Barrett has arranged
no definite schedule of baseball
games for next semester up to the
present time. He is negotiating
with St. Mary's and Santa Clara
for the usual preliminary series,
and he will probably schedule
games with some of the semi-pro
fessional teams from San Francis
co. There is also a strong proba
bility that the Varsity will play a
series of games with the nine from
St. Vincent's College. Should St.
Vincent's make the trip, they will
prove worthy opponents for the
Varsity, as their team is usually
the strongest college aggregation in
Southern California.
