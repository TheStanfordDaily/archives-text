# CAST PARTLY CHOSEN
## SOPHOMORES WHO WILL TAKE LEADING PARTS SELECTED. Brief Summary of the Play That Will Be Given Early Next Semester. 
### 
The temporary cast for the
Sophomore play, "She Stoops to
Conquer," as selected by the coach,
Mrs. J. E. Walker, at the prelimi
nary try-out held last week, met
yesterday afternoon for the first
rehearsal.
While Mrs. Walker did not an
nounce that she had as yet made
any definite choice of characters, it
seems certain that the leading roles
are already practically settled.
There are six leading male and
four female parts to be filled. E.
J. Swift, W. M. Walker, and R. H.
Baker will undoubtedly be the
three principals in the show, tak
ing the parts of Hastings, Ycung
Marlow, and Tony Lumpkin respec
tively. Hardcastle, a slightly less
important part, will be taken by F.
H. Abbott, Jr., but the part of Sir
Charles Marlow, of about equal im
portance, has not yet been settled.
Among the female parts Misß E.
11. Ellerbeck and Miss L. G. Stur
giss will have the leads, the former
filling the role of Miss Hardcastle
and the latter representing Miss
Neville. Miss V. A. Steele will
take the part of Mrs. Hardcastle,
while the role of Dolly, the maid,
falls to Miss C. H. Sheidler.
In addition to the characters
just enumerated there are nine
more of minor importance which
have not yet been definitely filled.
The play was first produced in
1773, and while the lines are for
the most part modem in expres
sion, the spirit of the play is typi
cal of the time in which it was
written. The gentlemen characters
are bombastic, while the rougher
characters occasionally descend to
vulgarity. The plot is an interest
ing and humorous one.
A country community but a
short distance from London fur
nishes the principal scene of action.
Sir Charles Marlow and Hardcastle,
old friends, arrange a meeting of
their son and daughter, with the
hope that the young people will be
attracted to each other. According
to arrangements Young Marlow, in
company with his friend Hastings,
sets out for the Hardcastle country
place. On the way they are mis
directed by Tony Lumpkin, the
dare-devil son of the elder Hard
castle, who sends them to his home
under the illusion that it is an inn.
Unknown to Marlow, Hastings
is an old friend of Miss Neville, the
intimate friend of Miss Hardcastle.
Hastings on his arrival immedi
ately plans an elopement with Miss
Neville. This escapade and the
misconception of Young Marlow
that he is at an inn results in
many humorous complications,
which are, however, all finally
cleared away by a reconciliation of
all parties and the betrothal of the
two young couples.
A date for the production of the
play has not yet been set. Before

the close of the semester it is hoped
to settle all the characters so that
the mem hers of the cast may study
their lines during the holidays. To
accomplish <this several more re
hearsals may he necessary before
the close of the semester. The full
cast will meet again in room 230
to-morrow afternoon at 1:30.
