# COLLEGE SETTLEMENT
## DR. GARDNER DISCUSSES PLAN FOR CHARITY WITH ALUMNI. Many in Favor of a Stanford College Settlement in San Francisco. 
### 
In response to the Rev. D. Charles
Gardner's call, a meeting of
San Francisco alumni was held
on Saturday night at the Occi
dental Hotel to discuss the pro
posed Stanford College Settlement.
A. B. Rice, '95, made a hrief ad
dress in which he emphasized the
importance of settlement work and
the noble idea of thereby express
ing the better side of Stanford life.
Besides alumni the chief college
settlement workers of San Fran
cisco were present and addressed
the meeting.
No definite plan had been prev
iously formulated and none was
expected as the result of this first
meeting. The problems confront
ing college settlement workers were
freely discussed, and many impor
tant suggestions were advanced
which will serve as a basis for the
initiation of settlement work by
Stanford men and women. It is
hoped that through such work the
spiritual life of the University will
express itself and make the highest
ideals of its founders a living
reality in the hearts of men.
The general principle and plan
have been formulated by Dr. Gard
ner as follows:
"1. The Principle.—To establish
in some neglected quarter of San
Francisco a Stanford College Settle
ment, that alumni and undergrad
uates may do something to help
their fellow <men and thus per
petuate the ideal of the Univer
sity.
"2. The Plan. — (a) To engage a
Stanford girl to do neighborhood
nursing—this work to serve as a
nucleus about which to build Stan
ford settlement work, (b) To form
an undergraduate committee to
study settlement work and social
problems, and to co-operate with
an alumni committee in San Fran
cisco."
