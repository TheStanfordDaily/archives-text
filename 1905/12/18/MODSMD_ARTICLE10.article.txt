# Arrangements for Concert.
## 
### 
Arrangements for the concert by
the combined musical clubs of the
University of Nebraska on April
25th are being definitely concluded.
The clubs will appear in Assembly
Hall under the auspices of the stu
dent body, on their own responsi
bility. Manager Barrett will not
receive any percentage of the re
ceipts of the concert. The Nebraska
students will travel in their own
special sleeping and dining cars, so
that no arrangements for their ac
commodation here will be neces
sary. A letter from the manager
states that the clubs are practicing
regularly and will be able to give a
fir√üt-class concert.
