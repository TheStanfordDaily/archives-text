###

was defeated at Stockton last Fri
day night by the Young Men's
Christian Association. The final
score was 16-14, the result being
in doubt until the last whistle. At

Btood 14-14, thus requiring extra
time to finish the contest, Stockton
finally winning the extra two
points after nearly five minutes of
fierce playing.
The play during the entire game
was exceedingly rough and char
acterized by much fouling. Con
sidering the fact that the Stockton
team has played together for four
years, and has held the champion
ship of the state for two, the show
ing made by the Stanford team
was very encouraging. The team
played fast and consistent ball and
fought hard, the Blippery floor and
poor light proving a heavy handi
cap.

baskets, and Presley covered his
man hard and thoroughly, giving
him almost no opportunity to
handle the ball.

opponents. This contest was the
