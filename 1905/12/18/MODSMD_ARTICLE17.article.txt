The action of the Athletic Com
mittee in recently passing restric
tions in regard to granting class
sweaters for baseball and tennis
met with general approval. There
is, however, an evil in another
branch of sport, namely track,
which they failed to correct. In
general a track man who wins his
sweater in an interclass meet has
to exert himself to finish in one of
the three places which entitle him
to this honor; but there is the ex
ception when there are but three
men in an event. An example of
this has been the hurdle races in
the interclass meets during the last
few years. The men who receive
third place may or may not have
deserved their sweaters, but when a
man is able to "win" his class em
blem by merely covering a fixed
distance regardless of time or speed,
the class sweater ,is undoubtedly
cheapened. Some step should be
taken to require that there must
be competition to entitle a man to
his class sweater for finishing first,
second, or third in an interclass
field meet. Restrictions have been
placed on class baseball and tennis
sweaters, and they are being dis
criminated against unless some
action is taken in regard to this
evil in obtaining class track
sweaters.
