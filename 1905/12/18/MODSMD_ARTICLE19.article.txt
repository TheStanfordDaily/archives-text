# LECTURE ON MUSIC.
## Organist of Memorial Church Talks on "Some Prevalent Fallacies Concerning Music." 
### 
Aqinformal address was given
by Dr. Blodgett in the chapel on
Friday evening upon "Some Preva
lent Fallacies Concerning Mußic."
Music was defined as being a de
termined series of tones in melodic
and rhythmic order, according to
the nature of the mind, for the pro
duction of a predetermined aes
thetic impression. Bird songs, the
splash of a waterfall, the murmur
of a brook, are not music, however
beautiful they may be.
The true way to hear music is to
be utterly unbiased by "explana
tions," so that it may make its own
unhindered impression. Dr. Blod
gett showed that the content and
primary appeal of music is spirit
ual, not intellectual, but that its
influence upon intellectual pro
cesses is all the more powerful.
Specialization in music until a
broad and deep intellectual and
scientific foundation for it had been
laid was condemned as a well-nigh
universal fallacy in America, and
the elimination of personality in
the performance of music, as in
mechanical and piano-playing in
struments, was vehemently de
plored.
[ti conclusion Dr. Blodgett traced
the relation of music, properly
studied, to the intellectual and
moral life, instancing the lives of
Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mendels
sohn, Schumann, and Wagner as
corroboration of it.
