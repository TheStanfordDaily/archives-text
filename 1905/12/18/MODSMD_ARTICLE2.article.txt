# SERMON ON MISSIONARIES.
## Regular Service Was Held in the Morning and Oratorio in the Evening. 
### 
Dr. Samuel Satthianadhan de
livered the address in Memorial
Church Sunday morning. His
subject was "What Christian Mis
sionaries Have Done in India."
In the evening Handel's famous
sacred oratorio was given by the
choir assisted by Mrs. Sarah Bibby-
Brown, soprano; Miss Pearl Cooper,
contralto; Dr. G. B. Little, tenor;
and Mr. Charles B. Moser, bass.
The last oratorio of the semester
proved the best that has been given.
Owing to the bad weather a large
number were kept away, and many
requests have been made that "The
Messiah" be given again. This
oratorio requires nearly three
hours' time, but is one of the finest
written. The same composition
may be rendered again in Febru
ary.
