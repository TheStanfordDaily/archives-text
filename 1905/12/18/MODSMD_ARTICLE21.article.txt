# NEW SYSTEM IN OPERATION.
## Improved Books for Keeping of Class Finances Received. 
### 
The class treasurers met laßt Fri
day night, and adopted the books
which have been made for them.
The new system of book-keeping
will go into immediate operation.
The caßh book, which is the basis
of the system, is a heavy book,
handsomely bound in red leather.
It has printed title-page and head
ings.
The voucher and receipt books
are in the form of check books, and
each voucher and receipt bears a
number, which number will be en
tered in the cash book at the time
of the transaction.
The new system of book-keeping
and the new books can easily be
adapted to any student organiza
tion, and were made for that pur
pose.
