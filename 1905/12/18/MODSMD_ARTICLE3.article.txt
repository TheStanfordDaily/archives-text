The victorious football team, with

queted at the Hotel Vendome in

gathering had been scheduled for
the Friday night after the intercol
legiate game, but the absence of

members of the team marked the
climax of the good feeling which
prevailed. The cup was presented
to Thompson in recognition of four
years' faithful service on the grid
