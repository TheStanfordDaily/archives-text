# WOULD REVIEW RECORD
## ALUMNUS TO JUDGE FOOTBALL SITUATION. A.B. Rice, '95, Declares that Few Changes Are Needed in Game on Coast. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I believe that Stanford can show
the best and cleanest football re
sults of all big universities in this
country.
In the present discussion through
out the United States the opponents
of the varsity game are dealing
with generalities and using excep
tional cases of brutality and in
jury as adverse criticisms applica
ble to all teams. Where totals of
injuries are charged to different
sports the aggregate number of par
ticipants is each is not mentioned,
but football, for instance, with its
tens of thousands of players, is
made to appear more dangerous
than pugilism, which probably has
only about one per cent as many
participants, and they not in one
fourth as many contests.
No college has yet pesesented its
complete football record. President
Jordan and Dr. Spaulding, a mem
ber of the recently appointed Cali
fornia-Stanford investigating aid
rules committee, have requested
my co-operation. I want Stanford's
record —authentic facts of all kinds
bearing on the development of the
sport and its faults and favorable
features. That record I can sup
plement with my personal observa
tions and written accounts of the
fifteen seasons.
With crystallized facts from Stan
ford as a basis, a similar record
can be compiled at Berkeley, and
then the committee will have some
thing tangible upon which to base
its deliberations for the improve
ment and preservation of the great
game. The records deduced by the
two big, powerful football rivals of
the Pacific Slope could go forth to
the press of the country as actual
results, showing the percentage of
injuries and practically challeng
ing fair comparison with other ath
letic sports, all of which have their
casualties and occasional fatalities.
The facts can be dug up. Volun
teers must do it. Twenty men
giving one hour apiece sometime
during the Christmas vacation
could take the library's bound vol
umes of the Daily Palo Alto and
skim through them for football
stuff, and reduce it to tabular form.
They could obtain essentially these
facts for each of the seasons: (1)
The aggregate number of Stanford
men playing at the game, with the
average number of days and total
of hours probably devoted to the
sport, showing how many played
occasionally and how many regu
larly. (2) The length of the season
in days. (3) The number of prac
tice games, and the probable total
of Stanford participants. (4) The
total of matches, including both
the first and second elevens, and
showing the total of Stanford par
ticipants. (5) The total of injuries
of every description, summarizing
and classifying them as to their
character, and indicating which
were in match games, which in
practice games, and which in scrub
games by untrained men. (6) The
number of protracted injuries, giv
ing approximate time lost from
study and time lost from active
participation in the game. (7) The
number of permanent injuries and
to whom, and how caused. (8) The
number of Stanford men ruled off
for rough playing. (9) Each sea
son's aggregate football receipts
and expenditures. (10) Each sea
son's expense for coach or coaches.
(11) The total number of Stanford
practice and match games partici
pated in by each of Stanford's
Varsity captains, and the injuries
each captain sustained; also which
captains graduated, and what each
is doing now. (12) The total num
ber of men students in Stanford
each season, aB shown by the Regis
trar's records. (13) And other
general or specific information that
may lie discovered.
I might mention that in the fif
teen seasons Stanford has had but
one man ruled out of a big inter
collegiate game for intentional
roughness, while California has
had seven; and that no Stanford
man, whether trained or unpre
pared, has, so far as 1 know, sus
tained fatal or permanent injuries
at the game.
If undergraduates will promptly
dig out the dope I'll help to super
vise its final reduction to the most
available form, and then Stanford
can stand on her actual football
record as a clean exemplar of the
game, qualified to help reform the
rules for the Western Slope.
To minimize mass plays and
produce a more open, and therefore
a more brilliant, game it might be
practicable to make rules requiring
the defensive halves to stand in
direct line behind their guards and
the quarter- and the full-back sim
ilarly in direct line behind the cen
ter. That would handicap line
plays and purposely weaken the
initial defense on end runs, which
could be further encouraged by in
creasing the required distance to
ten yards and permitting five
downs to make it on outside of
tackle plajs and only three downs
on plays inside of tackle. It might
also lie well to forbid interference
traveling in advance of the ball.
Intentional roughness and slugging
might be effectively restrained by
drastic penalties and by a whole
some student sentiment that would
not permit any man to remain in
college who had ever been ruled off
the field. Alienie Kick, '95.

its deliberations for the improve
ment and preservation of the great
game. The records deduced by the
two big, powerful football rivals of
the Pacific Slope could go forth to
the press of the country as actual
results, showing the percentage of
injuries and practically challeng
ing fair comparison with other ath
letic sports, all of which have their
casualties and occasional fatalities.
The facts can be dug up. Volun
teers must do it. Twenty men
giving one hour apiece sometime
during the Christmas vacation
could take the library's bound vol
umes of the Daily Palo Alto and
skim through them for football
stuff, and reduce it to tabular form.
They could obtain essentially these
facts for each of the seasons: (1)
The aggregate number of Stanford
men playing at the game, with the
average number of days and total
of hours probably devoted to the
sport, showing how many played
occasionally and how many regu
larly. (2) The length of the season
in days. (3) The number of prac
tice games, and the probable total
of Stanford participants. (4) The
total of matches, including both
the first and second elevens, and
showing the total of Stanford par
ticipants. (5) The total of injuries
of every description, summarizing
and classifying them as to their
character, and indicating which
were in match games, which in
practice games, and which in scrub
games by untrained men. (6) The
number of protracted injuries, giv
ing approximate time lost from
study and time lost from active
participation in the game. (7) The
number of permanent injuries and
to whom, and how caused. (8) The
number of Stanford men ruled off
for rough playing. (9) Each sea
son's aggregate football receipts
and expenditures. (10) Each sea
son's expense for coach or coaches.
(11) The total number of Stanford
practice and match games partici
pated in by each of Stanford's
Varsity captains, and the injuries
each captain sustained; also which
captains graduated, and what each
is doing now. (12) The total num
ber of men students in Stanford
each season, aB shown by the Regis
trar's records. (13) And other
general or specific information that
may lie discovered.
I might mention that in the fif
teen seasons Stanford has had but
one man ruled out of a big inter
collegiate game for intentional
roughness, while California has
had seven; and that no Stanford
man, whether trained or unpre
pared, has, so far as 1 know, sus
tained fatal or permanent injuries
at the game.
If undergraduates will promptly
dig out the dope I'll help to super
vise its final reduction to the most
available form, and then Stanford
can stand on her actual football
record as a clean exemplar of the
game, qualified to help reform the
rules for the Western Slope.
To minimize mass plays and
produce a more open, and therefore
a more brilliant, game it might be
practicable to make rules requiring
the defensive halves to stand in
direct line behind their guards and
the quarter- and the full-back sim
ilarly in direct line behind the cen
ter. That would handicap line
plays and purposely weaken the
initial defense on end runs, which
could be further encouraged by in
creasing the required distance to
ten yards and permitting five
downs to make it on outside of
tackle plajs and only three downs
on plays inside of tackle. It might
also lie well to forbid interference
traveling in advance of the ball.
Intentional roughness and slugging
might be effectively restrained by
drastic penalties and by a whole
some student sentiment that would
not permit any man to remain in
college who had ever been ruled off
the field. Alienie Kick, '95.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I believe that Stanford can show
the best and cleanest football re
sults of all big universities in this
country.
In the present discussion through
out the United States the opponents
of the varsity game are dealing
with generalities and using excep
tional cases of brutality and in
jury as adverse criticisms applica
ble to all teams. Where totals of
injuries are charged to different
sports the aggregate number of par
ticipants is each is not mentioned,
but football, for instance, with its
tens of thousands of players, is
made to appear more dangerous
than pugilism, which probably has
only about one per cent as many
participants, and they not in one
fourth as many contests.
No college has yet pesesented its
complete football record. President
Jordan and Dr. Spaulding, a mem
ber of the recently appointed Cali
fornia-Stanford investigating aid
rules committee, have requested
my co-operation. I want Stanford's
record —authentic facts of all kinds
bearing on the development of the
sport and its faults and favorable
features. That record I can sup
plement with my personal observa
tions and written accounts of the
fifteen seasons.
With crystallized facts from Stan
ford as a basis, a similar record
can be compiled at Berkeley, and
then the committee will have some
thing tangible upon which to base
its deliberations for the improve
ment and preservation of the great
game. The records deduced by the
