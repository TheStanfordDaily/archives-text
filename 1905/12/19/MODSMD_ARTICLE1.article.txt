# WOULD REVIEW RECORD
## ALUMNUS TO JUDGE FOOTBALL SITUATION. A.B. Rice, '95, Declares that Few Changes Are Needed in Game on Coast.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I believe that Stanford can show
the best and cleanest football re
sults of all big universities in this
country.
In the present discussion through
out the United States the opponents
of the varsity game are dealing
with generalities and using excep
tional cases of brutality and in
jury as adverse criticisms applica
ble to all teams. Where totals of
injuries are charged to different
sports the aggregate number of par
ticipants is each is not mentioned,
but football, for instance, with its
tens of thousands of players, is
made to appear more dangerous
than pugilism, which probably has
only about one per cent as many
participants, and they not in one
fourth as many contests.
No college has yet pesesented its
complete football record. President
Jordan and Dr. Spaulding, a mem
ber of the recently appointed Cali
fornia-Stanford investigating aid
rules committee, have requested
my co-operation. I want Stanford's
record â€”authentic facts of all kinds
bearing on the development of the
sport and its faults and favorable
features. That record I can sup
plement with my personal observa
tions and written accounts of the
fifteen seasons.
With crystallized facts from Stan
ford as a basis, a similar record
can be compiled at Berkeley, and
then the committee will have some
thing tangible upon which to base
its deliberations for the improve
ment and preservation of the great
game. The records deduced by the
two big, powerful football rivals of
the Pacific Slope could go forth to
the press of the country as actual
results, showing the percentage of
injuries and practically challeng
ing fair comparison with other ath
letic sports, all of which have their
casualties and occasional fatalities.
The facts can be dug up. Volun
teers must do it. Twenty men
giving one hour apiece sometime
during the Christmas vacation
could take the library's bound vol
umes of the Daily Palo Alto and
skim through them for football
stuff, and reduce it to tabular form.
They could obtain essentially these
facts for each of the seasons: (1)
The aggregate number of Stanford
men playing at the game, with the
average number of days and total
of hours probably devoted to the
sport, showing how many played
occasionally and how many regu
larly. (2) The length of the season
in days. (3) The number of prac
tice games, and the probable total
of Stanford participants. (4) The
total of matches, including both
the first and second elevens, and
showing the total of Stanford par
ticipants. (5) The total of injuries
of every description, summarizing
and classifying them as to their
