If the reports are true that the
manager of the Associated Students
has engaged a coach for the crew, it
is plain that he has not only acted
hastily in the matter, but h;»B evi
dently exceeded his authority.
The engagement of a coach in
volves the expenditure of consid
erable money, and such action
should l»e taken only after ma
ture deliberation and with the
hearty co-operation of the members
of the Executive Committee. With
out the sanction of that body no
contract with a boating coach can
be valid, and courtesy alone should
have demanded that the committee
be consulted before a trainer for
the oarsmen was definitely engaged.
But there are even more pertinent
reasons why a boating coach should
not be secured without a thorough
canvass of the field. The student
body cannot afford to spend much
on boating this spring, and the
chance to secure the services of a
competent oarsman, who was will
ing to give his services free of
charge, should not have been light
ly disregarded. It is more than
probable that the determination
not to build the new. track this
year was due to the assumption of
the support of the crew by the As
sociated Students and the conse
quent fear of a deficit next semes
ter. If this is true— and there is no
reason to believe it is not —-the stu
dent body can hardly afford to en
gage an expensive professional
coach at this time.
