# DRAMATISTS ELECTED
## SWORD AND SANDALS CHOOSES MEMBERS. Officers Named and New Constitution Discussed at Recent Meeting. 
### 
At a recent meeting of Sword and
Sandals the following men were
elected to membership in the dra
matic society: L. W. Cntler, '06, J.
M. Ward, '07, J. E. Stewart, '07,
and F. H. Bernard, '07. Officers
of the organization for the coming
semester were elected as follows:
R. S. Kellogg, '07, president, and E.
R. May, '0(>, secretary-treasurer.
Professors L. E. Bassett and S. S.
Seward of the English department
were elected honorary members.
Plans were considered for the
drawing up of a new constitution
which would place the society on a
more definite basis, particularly in
defining the standards of eligibility
for membership in the organization.
The accumulation of stage property
also calls for some regulations in
regard to its retention and use.
Manager Barrett has turned over
to Sword and Sandals the title to
all stage paraphernalia now in
possession of the Btudent body, and
has suggested that the society rent
these out on occasions to help pay
for their maintenance. Several
classes have given the scenery from
their productions to the dramatic
organization. It may also have the
custody of the properties belonging
to the English Club.
More definite plans will be form
ulated at the first meeting next
semester. It is probable that ward
ens will be appointed from the so
ciety who will have charge of the
repainting and Btoring of the prop
erties.
