In a personal communication
addressed to L. R. Weinmann, '06,
Archie Rice, '95, very emphatical
ly declares that the story recently
printed in the city papers that the
San Francisco Alumni Association
proposed offering a silver cup for in
terclass association football games,
was true in every particular.
Rice is a member of the commit
tee, appointed for this purpose, and
is therefore in a position to speak
authoritatively on the subject. He
says, in part: "We are intending
to call a meeting in Encina early
in January and start association
in the proper manner, and hope
eventually to see lacrosse well es
tablished at Stanford. None of thi6
is intended to displace Varsity
football; get that idea out of the
undergraduate head. We want all
the best sports at Stanford, played
at their best, and all the men play
ing something, till the last delving
dig has to come out of his hiding
place and get into some kind of
athletic recreation."
From this it may be judged that
the alumni really are actively in
teresting themselves in the intro
duction of the English game. Rice
adds that the Stanford Club is se
curing a magnificent silver cup to
be awarded the winner of an inter
class series if such can be arranged.
