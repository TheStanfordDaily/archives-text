# BIG CONCERT PLANNED
## ALL MUSICAL ORGANIZATIONS TO COMBINE ON PROGRAM. Funds Will Be Used to Pay Balance on Piano for Use at Assembly Hall Concerts. 
### 
A combined concert, in which all
of the representative musical or
ganizations of the University, with
the exception of the Band, will take
part, will be held in the Assembly
Hall on the night of January 19th.
The funds raised by the concert
will be devoted to paying off the
balance yet due on the Steinway
grand piano, which was purchased
by the faculty two years ago for
use in Assembly Hall.
The concert wili also serve to
bring before the University organ
izations which are to-day little
more than a name to the majority
of the student body. The Glee and
Mandolin Clubs, the Orchestra, the
Woman's Glee Club, and the Choir,
as well as a number of the Univer
sity's vocal and instrumental solo
ists, will take part in the program.
The only musical organization
which will not be represented is
the Band, and it is omitted only
because many of the players are
also members of the University Or
chestra. It is the hope of those
who are backing and organizing
the concert that it will become an
annual event and be the greatest
musical feature of the college
year.
The piano on which the balance
is due was purchased some two
years ago by the faculty committee
on entertainments to save the ex
pense of renting a piano from San
Francisco for use at concerts. A
part of the purchase price was paid
from funds then available, and
some members of the faculty signed
notes for the balance, hoping to
pay it off from the proceeds of their
concerts. Unfortunately the con
cert receipts were very small and
there was only sufficient surplus to
pay the interest on the notes. For
tunately the leaders of the different
organizations are enthusiastic over
the proposition and its success
seems assured. As soon as the
piano is paid for, the committee
will present it to the student body
for use in the Assembly Hall.
