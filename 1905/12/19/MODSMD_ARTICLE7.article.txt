# NEW PLAN PROPOSED
## GREEN SUBMITS FACULTY IDEA OF HALL CONTROL. Proposition Will Be Voted on by Members of Encina Club Tomorrow Night. 
### 
The members of Encina Club
will vote to-morrow night on the
question of whether they shall be
controlled by a board of sixteen
monitors, appointed by the com
mittee on student affairs, or whether
this committee shall have full
charge of the Hall, as it has in the
past. On account of the many
controversies over the management
of the Hall at present it is thought
that some change should be made.
It is strongly hinted that even if
the Encina men reject the proposed
plan, some radical change will be
made by the faculty committee.
The following letter was received
by President Crawford this after
noon:
Dec. 19, 1905.
Mr. W. E. Crawford,
President of Encina Club.
Dear Sir: —President Jordan has
instructed the Committee on Stu
dent Affairs to nominate sixteen
monitors and to define their au
thority and responsibilty in main
taining order in Encina Hall. In
pursuance of these instructions the
committee has formulated the fol
lowing tentative plan, which 1 send
to you for the information of the
men in Encina:
Duties of Monitoks.—lt shall
be the duties of the monitors to
maintain order and to see that
personal rights are respected; to
use all means at their command to
suppress "tubbing" and hazing; to
prevent as far as possible such un
necessary noise as would interfere
with work or rest; to enforce the
rule against bringing intoxicating
liquors into the Hall.
In cases of theft, drunkenness, or
other legal or moral offences of a
character too serious for the moni
tors to deal with, the monitors are
to report the facts to the Commit
tee on Student Affairs.
Authority of Monitors.—The
monitors, individually and sever
ally, will be expected to use any
proper means in performing their
duties; but in case such personal
endeavor on the part of a monitor
is not effective, the facts shall be
referred by him to the monitors
acting collectively; and such moni
tors may by vote exclude an offend
ing student from the Hall.
The above plan has been formu
lated after criticisms and sugges
tions have been received from a
number of upper-class men in the
Hall, and seems to promise the
best solution of the problem under
consideration with the means
available at the present time. Its
success depends upon the measure
of support given to the monitors
by those who favor good order and
the protection of the elementary
personal rights of the residents
in the Hall.
It will be noted that the plan
outlined places the power to disci
