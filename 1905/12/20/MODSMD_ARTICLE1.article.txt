# COAST FOOTBALL FAST
## STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA MANIPULATE MOST PLAYS. Comparisons Made by "Springfield Republican" Deduct Above Conclusions. 
### 
A recent number of the Spring
field Republican contains a resum6
of the football season which con
tains records proving that the Stan
ford-California game was played
faster than any of the big Eastern
contests. The article is in part as
follows:
In what 1905 match of 35-min
ute halves was the fastest football
played —that is, in what match of

regulation length
were the greatest
number of plays
executed ? With
Middle Western tra
ditions and claims
in mind, many
guesses would
doubtless be pinned
to the Michigan-
Chicago Thanks
giving Day battle,
were off-hand re
plies demanded.
Yale's two big
games seemed also
tolerably rapid.The
Dartmouth- Brown
contest in this city
was one of the live
liest of the cam
paign. Yet none of
these holds the rec
ord. The available
diagrams show that
rapid-lire football
delivery was seen
at its best whereone
would least expect
it —in California. A
map of the Stan
ford-C a 1 if or n i a
game of November
11th, prepared by

Archie Rice, the football authority
of the Pacific Coast, shows that
87 plays were reeled off in the
first half, and 111 in the second
— a total of 198. Careful scrutiny
of charts of four representative
Eastern games and one engage
ment of the Middle West fails to
reveal anything quite so spright
ly as this. Michigan and Chicago
are only three behind, with 19.',
movements of the ball. The Dart
mouth-Brown match in this city
had 183 plays, Harvard-Yale 160,
Yale-Princeton 155, and the poky
Army-Navy collision 150.
It is possible that the Yale-Co
lumbia total surpasses any of these,
for Yale wasted less time than us
ual between plays. But it is yet to
be claimed that this 53-0 catastro
phe should be classed among the
real contests of the year. The other
game* cited were bitterly argued.
It is worth noting that the second
halves of four of them were faster
than the first halves:
Ist 2d

Harvard-Yale 75 85 100
Yale-Princeton 70 85 155
Brown-Dartmouth .. 100 83 183
Army-Navy 84 66 150
Chicago-Michigan . . .96 99 195
Stanford-California...B7 111 198

The Stanford-California jump
from 87 to 111 is really remark
able. The chronicler does not say
just how near the temperature was
to the lotus-breeding kind that
Easterners like to credit to Califor
nia as a fixed asset; but it was at
leant so warm that the pictures
show the bleacher girls in summery
attire, and the officials, "Johnny"
Poe and his brother Nielson, gad
ding about without sweater or vest.
The above figures are not submit
ted as being of any especial import
ance as indexing Eastern or West
ern football. Circumstances of
weather, field, opponent and me
thod enter deeply into this speed
question. It was not observable
that either Yale or Harvard, in the
last two games, laid any particular

stress upon cutting down the time
between downs. Certainly there
were times in the Harvard-Yale
match when laymen felt that the
Crimson eleven lost hard-earned
advantages by not reforming rapid
ly, and crowding their plays when
they had Yale "on the run." Both
big elevens seemed bent on leisure
ly loading, and hitting hard rather
than often. It is also true, inci
dentally, that the Coast elevens
paid part penalty for haste in fre
quent fumbling, which was all but
unknown hereabout in the final
games. It should also be said that
there were Eastern games where the
rate of delivery was as high as that
of the California contest, except
that the halves were not of regula
tion length, and that the Western
duelists, averaging under 180, were
light, judged by Eastern standards.
