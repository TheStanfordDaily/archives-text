# REQUIRE EXTRA YEAR
## PRACTICAL WORK IN PEDAGOGICAL STUDY DEMANDED. High School Teachers' Certificates After May Will Presuppose Graduate Study. 
### 
The State Legislature has recent
ly passed a set of resolutions to be
adopted by the State Board of
Education, regarding the issue of i
high school teachers' certificates!
after May, 1906.
Under the present system high
school certificates are issued to
university graduates who, besides
satisfying thu ordinary graduation
requirements in their major and i

minor departments, include in
their courses work in the Depart
ment of Education equivalent to
twelve hours of credit, in addition
to any other courses that may be
deemed necessary in the special
case. But according to the recent
legislation, university graduates de
siring to teach will he obliged to
complete eight hours of work in
the Departmentof Education during
the undergraduate period, and will
have to carry a year of academic
work beyond the usual baccalaure
ate requirements; the graduate
work to be of such nature as is in
dicated in the text of the resolu
tions printed below.
The newly proposed system of
fers several advantages over the
former method. Besides raising
the standard of scholarship and in
creasing the amount of practical
pedagogical work required of future
teachers, an opportunity is given
the students to take their A. M.
degree at the same time they are
awarded their teachers' certificates.
This movement on the part of
educational authorities is strictly
in line with similar movements
undertaken by other professions
in the last few years. Many of the
medical and legal colleges now re

quire the equivalent of the A. B.
degree before allowing a student to
enter the institution, and in Borne
branches of •ngineering graduate
work is required before giving the
professional degree. Pedagogy then
is the laßt of th» professions that
has made graduat* study an ex
action. Following is a detailed
stenographic report of the reading
of the resolutions as presented for
adoption to the State Board of
Education on Tuesday, December
sth:
