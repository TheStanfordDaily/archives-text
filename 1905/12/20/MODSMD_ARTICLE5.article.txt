A news clipping from tt small j
town in Maine has been received J
by this paper. It concerns the late j
trouble at Mullen's Hall in Paloi
Alto, and, greatly exaggerating the
affair, places the blame upon thei
students. That news of this trou- i
ble should travel as far hs Maine is
surprising. It was printed by the
paper the day after the so-called
riot. Affairs of this kind do not
benefit Stanford,and the widespread
notoriety should afford food for re
flection.
