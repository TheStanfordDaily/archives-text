Columbia. —The last perform
ance of ''The College Widow" will
take place Saturday night. Few
plays presented in San Francisco
this winter have aroused the inter
est created by this clever piece by
George Ade. The success which it
has won shows the interest of the
general public in a good college
play when it can be kept up to the
ordinary standard of excellence.
The Alcazar. —This week the
production of "Brown's in Town"
is drawing large houses at the Al
cazar. The comedy is to be fol
lowed by a magnificent Christinas
production, the first in San Fran
cisco, of Mark Twain's famous six
teenth century romance, "The
Prince and the Pauper," in which
Ollie Cooper, the most remarkable
child actresß on the Pacific Coast,
will have the dual role of little
Prince of Wales and the pauper
lad Tom Canty. The charm of a
fairy story is combined with the
splendor of a brilliant stage spec
tacle, and the holiday attraction
will appeal alike to old and young.
