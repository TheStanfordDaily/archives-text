Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The "Writer of : last night s editor
ial was evidently misinformed. At
the last Executive Committee
meeting the student- body assumed
boating expense and management,
and the manager was authorized to
engage a couch. Acting on this
authorization, the manager has ne
gotiated with several coaches, and
in conjunction with the Boat Club
has decided that Mr. Dan Murphy
is the beet man. No contract has
been signed with him. The matter
will be discussed at to-night's
Executive Committee meeting.
The writer is also mistaken in
assuming that the building of the
new track comes under the super
vision of the student body. This
is in charge of the Training House
Corporation. They have voted to
make the track, but not to erect
the bleachers. This decision was
reached because Trainer Moulton
assured them that it would be im
possible to get the track in good
condition for the big meet.
The bleachers for the track will
cost seven thousand dollars, and
the coach for boating only three
hundred. Even if both matters
were under the supervision of the
same management, it would be il
logical to conclude that the antici
pation of a three hundred dollar
expenditure would prevent the en
tering into a seven thousand dollar
contract.
I feel that it would not be asking
too much of the editor, or anyone
else who is inclined to criticise, that
he first ask for an explanation
from the Executive Committee or
the manager. Such a step would
in many cases prevent criticism
based on conditions which do not
in fact exist, and would make less
burdensome a task which is diffi
cult under most favorable condi
tions. R. W. Barrett.
