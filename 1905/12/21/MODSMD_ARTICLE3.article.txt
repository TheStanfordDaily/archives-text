# NEW PLAN REJECTED
## ENCINA MEN REFUSE FACULTY SUGGESTION OF CONTROL. Vote Is Decisive on Important Question.-Faculty Will Probably Take Action in Hall Affairs. 
### 
The members of Encina Club re
jected by a decisive vote the plan
of student control for the Hall as
submitted in a letter from Pro
fessor 11. L. Green. President
\V. E. Crawford, '06, stated the
proposition to the members of the
club, and after explaining a few
points that were not thoroughly
understood, called for a vote.
The first vote was taken vive

voce, hut as those who were in
favor of the adoption of the pro
posed plan made more demonstra
tion than their numbers warranted,
tlio president called for a division,
and when the two factions separ
ated those desiring the establish
ment of the new system were out
numbered about seven to one.
There was a large attendance at
the meeting.
It is difficult to predict what ac
tion will be taken by the Student
Affairs Committee in regard to the
management of the Hall. How
ever, President Crawford of Encina
Club haR intimated that some radi
cal changes will be made and that
the faculty propose to strictly en
force all rules. The vote on this
new plan of control was the only
business before the meeting last
night.
