# CANADIANS MAY PLAY
## WOULD INTRODUCE RUGBY AT STANFORD. Possibility of Game Between Rival Teams.â€”Occidental College Adopts Rugby. 
### 
Dr. Frank Angel], chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
has received a letter from the sec
retary of the British Columbia
Rugby Union, offering to send a
team to play an exhibition game of
Rugby football at Stanford Uni
versity. The union offers to pay
all expenses of its team, and
vouches for its amateur standing
in the strictest sense of the word.

The British Co
lumbia Rugby Un
ion in an association
with headquarters
at Vancouver, B.C.,
whose members fos
ter and play the
gameofRugby foot
ball under what are
known as Union
rules, for the sake
of the sport alone.
The association has
representatives in
Montreal, Quebec,
Manitoba, and all
theother important
cities of Canada,
its members are of
independent means
and the best type
of sportsmen, so
that nothingstands
in the way of hav
ing them play a
game at Stanford
in spite of the fact
that the Union is
not a collegiate in
stitution or its
members students
of colleges.
Dr. Angell has
expressed himself

as being heartily in favor of the
project for many reasons. In view
of the present indecision as to
what sort of football is to be played
on the Coast in the future, and in
consideration of the proposal that
Rughy shall be substituted, and
the general scant information con
cerning the latter game, the chance
for an exhibition of its features
comes most opportunely. The
strict amateur standing of the
players, and their desire to play
for sport's sake, appeal strongly to
Dr. Angell. As the members of
the team would pay their own ex
penses, finances need not be con
sidered. Furthermore, Dr. Angell
characterizes the game, when
played by experts, as one of the
most exciting and skilful branches
of athletics. For these reasons he
has announced that he will urge
the Vancouver team to come south,
promising to do all in his power
to arrange matters so that an ex
hibition of Rugby will be given
herein the near future.
As has been suggested, the team
of New Zealand's Rughy football
playeri, which is now in England,
may give an exhibition match on
the campus. It is highly probable
that such will be the case if the
players can he induced to return
home via the Pacific Coast. It is
Dr. Angell's plan to endeavor to
bring about a match game
of Rugby between the Can
adian and New Zealand teams.
As both are composed of experts,
and the issue would result in great
rivalry, he expects that the contest
would prove one of the fastest Rug
by matches ever witnessed.
In the development of interest in
the Rugby game comes the news,
contained in a letter received by
Dr. Angel), that Occidental College,
Los Angeles, will maintain next
season fit least one Rugby football
team, partly as an experiment.
The authorities of the college state
that as the game has been already
tried to a limited extent and recent
conditions in football have not been
satisfactory this has led to their
present action.
