Before the semester closes the
editor wishes to publicly acknowl
edge the debt that he owes to the
staff and the manager of the paper.
The entire staff without exception
have worked faithfully throughout
the semester and to their efforts is
largely due whatever success the
paper has attained. Whatever
have been the short-comings of the
paper is the fault of the editor,
through his inability to direct a
capable staff. All the members
from the managing editor down to
the lowest assistant have given
time and labor to better the inter
ests of the paper, often at a sacri
fice, but without complaint and
without any reward. The spirit of
competition among the different
members has been most fair, and
has served to lighten the unpleas
ant task of ranking the contestants.
In conclusion he would like to say
that personally he has never seen a
better all-round staff since he has
been on the paper, and thanks them
for the aid they have given him.
The service of the business man
ager has been invaluable. Trained
by his former experience with the
paper, he has had no small part in
contributing to its publication.
The correctness of the paper typo
graphically is largely due to his ef
forts. He has given an unusual
amount of time, and has patiently
borne all short-comings of the edi
torial staff.
The paper after January will
probably be an improvement over
this semester. With B. S. Allen as
editor the paper will have a cap
able chief, who has faithfully
served through the different stages
of apprenticeship, and is in every
way qualified to assume the leader
ship of the paper. He will be sup
ported by the same capable staff.
