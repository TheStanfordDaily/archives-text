# RICE TO CHANGE PROFESSION.
## Prominent Alumnus Leaves Journalism for the Insurance Business. 
### 
A. B. Rice, '95, who was very
prominent in undergraduate work
while in college, has permanently
given up journalism as a profession
and will enter the insurance busi
ness. In the future Rice will be
connected with the Union Central
Life Insurance Company of Cincin
nati, Ohio. Rice was one of the
founders of the Daily Palo Alto and
the Press Club. He was president
of the pioneer class, and the recent
success of the Alumnus was due in
a great measure to his efforts.
