### 
President D. S. Jordan has ap
pointed Professors A. C. Whitaker
and K. G. liendtorff to be the act
ing heads of the Economics and
German departments respectively.
Professor S. J. McLean, the
former head of the Economics de
partment, will depart in a few days
to accept the professorship of eco
nomics of commerce and transpor
tation at the University of Toronto
in Canada. The vacancy in the
German department is caused by
the linability of Dr. J. O. Griffin
to return to his work because of
the injury to his eye received last
semester.
Assistant Professor Whitaker
graduated from Stanford Univer
sity in 1899 and took his Ph. I).
degree at Columbia in 1904. He
was a Scholar in economics there
in 1899 and 1900. In 1901-02 he
was a student at the University of
Berlin, Germany.
Assistant Professor Rendtorff,
the new acting head of the German
department, took his A. M. degree
at Stanford in 1894 and his Ph. D.
in 189'3. He had previously stud
ied abroad for seven years at the
universities of Giessen and Kiel in
Germany.
The resignation of Professor Mc-
Lean has thrown Ihe w hole work
of the Economics department upon
Professors Whitaker and Millie,
and this has necessitated a great
deal of changing around of the
courses. Economic Theory, Money
and Banking, and Corporations
and Trusts have been changed
from their former hours in the
morning and will be given in the
afternoon during the coming se
mester.
