# HEAVY REGISTRATION
## THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN ENROLL. Number Will Be Increased by Registration This Evening.â€”Few Assessments Paid To-day. 
### 
To-day's registration is probably
the heaviest in the history of Stan
ford. Up to 5 o'clock 1327 stu
dents had registered. The Regis
trar's office will continue open un
til 10 o'clock this evening, when
registration for the day will be
closed. Students registering after
this evening will be compelled to
pay an additional two dollars. At
noon time to-day 940 had registered,
which is an unusual number for
one morning. The figures cannot
be contrasted with those of last
year because at that time two days
were allowed for registration, only
750 registering the first day.
The number of Christmas fresh
men and former students cannot
be learned at this time, but indi
cations are that those who enter
for the first time will number
about fifty-five. Study-cards must
be filed not later than next Friday.
The number of student body as
sessments is comparatively small.
Up to 5 o'clock this evening 695
assessments bad been paid. Of
this number 4(55 were paid by the
men students and 230 by the
women.
