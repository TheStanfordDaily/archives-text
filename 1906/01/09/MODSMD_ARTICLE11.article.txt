# POOR STUDENTS SUSPENDED.
## Scholarship Committee Suspends Sixty-two and Warns Seventy-two Undergraduates. 
### 
Sixty-two Btudents were dis
missed from the University for
failure to secure passing grades in
two-thirds of their work during the
past semester, and seventy-two
were warned that unless their work
shows a decided improvement in
the future they too will he sus
pended sometime during the pres
ent semester.
As usual the record of the
women students is far superior to
that of the men, but one of those
dropped being a woman. Of the
seventy-two warned but five were
women students.
These figures, when compared to
those of the first semester a year
ago, show a decided improvement
as a record of scholarship. At
that time sixty-two students were
dropped and seventy-eight warned,
but the registration then was near
ly two hundred less than the figures
for last semester.
An unusual feature of the action
of the committee this year is the
small number of Freshmen that
have been suspended. This is due
to the new rule which provides
that during their first semester
new students shall he required to
make passing grades in but one
third of their work.
