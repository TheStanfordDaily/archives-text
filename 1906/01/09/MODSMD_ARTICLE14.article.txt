The proportion of the students
paying their student body assess
ment is barely half of the number
registering. This lack of the stu
dent body support must be due to
a misunderstanding on the part of
the students in regard to the assess
ment. The assessment is due at
the beginning of each semester, and
not only in the fall, as was formerly
the custom. The students who
failed to pay the assessment to-day
will be given an opportunity to
rectify their mistake, as a student
will be in the Registrar's office all
day to-morrow for this purpose.
With the building of the new Stan
ford Field, the women's tennis
courts, and the other improvements
that are contemplated, every dollar
is needed to further the athletic
interests of Stanford. Every man
and woman student who has not
paid the assessment should not fail
to do eo to-morrow.
