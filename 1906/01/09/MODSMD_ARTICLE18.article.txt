# DENIES TRUTH OF INTERVIEW.
## Dr. Jordan Misquoted by Denver Reporter Concerning Mrs. Stanford's Death. 
### 
President Jordan returned from
his trip to Denver about the mid
dle of last week. During the trip
he spoke twice, once before the
teachers' institute of Los Angeles,
and once at Denver where he read
a paper before the Colorado State
Teachers' Association.
While at Denver, Dr. Jordan was
very much annoyed by the mis
quotation of certain statements
made by him concerning Mrs.
Stanford's death, in an interview
with a Denver reporter. The in
terviewer alleged that Dr. Jordan
had charged the Honolulu officials
and doctors with a gigantic con
spiracy to bleed the Stanford es
tate for large sums of money by
giving out the report that Mrs.
Stanford was murdered. One of
the San Francisco papers, which
had been very loud in advancing
the murder theory, seized upon the
interview and greatly magnified it,
publishing denials from all the
Honolulu officials.
As soon as he learned of the re
port Dr. Jordan issued the follow
ing signed denial:
"The Denver report in the Bulle
tin is incomplete and incorrect,
though perhaps not intentionally
so. It was my mistake to talk at
all with so careless a young man
after the interview was over. It
was then clearly understood that I
authorized but one single state
ment. The rest as telegraphed
from Denver was a jumble of
blunders for which I take no re
sponsibility. I shall not discuss
the subject further. I said that
tcp wflrfl sure that Mrs. Stanford's
natural causes.
)ably by a rup
v- Is of the heart.
D. S. Jordan."
