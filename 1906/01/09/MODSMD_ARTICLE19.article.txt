5 h n t)'e iter of the education
dowly moving to the
Middle West is shown by compara
tive figures of university attend
ance compiled by the Boston Tran
script. This table concerns the
twenty-seven largest universities of
the United States, and covers a
period of ten years, from 1895 to
1905. Within this decade, of the
first twenty institutions showing
the largest per cent of gain, seven
are eastern, one southern, and
twelve wee tern.
To the University of Kansas the
first place for the greatest growth
is given in 1905, while in 1895
Kansas was the seventeenth. The
growth of Harvard and Yale is
shown to be not nearly as rapid as
that of Western colleges. Stanford

ranked fifteenth in 1895, but drop
ped to the sixteenth place this
year. The University of California
was in the eighth place in 1895
and also in 1904, with an attend
ance of 3283, but this year it shows
a decrease. The percentage of
growth in the Southern universities
has not been as rapid as that of those
in the West.
This year the average growth of
the fifteen universities of this table
west of the Alleghenies, and in the
North, has been ten per cent; while
the average of the seven Eastern
universities has been but four.
Nothing is more evident from these
statistics than that the education
al center is slowly but surely
moving west.
