### 
The Sherman Indian football
team, which has given Stanford
and California close games for the
past four years, will cease to exist
with this season. Superintendent
Hall of the Sherman Institute has
found that the game does not pay
financially, and as it has devolved
upon him to make good the de
ficits, he has decided to put an end
to football at the school. The team
is reported to have lost $2000 this
season.
