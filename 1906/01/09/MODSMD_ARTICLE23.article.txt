# NEW COURSE IN ASTRONOMY.
## Purely Descriptive Study of Astronomical Phenomena Will Be Made. 
### 
A new departure in the Mathe
matics department is the estab
lishment of a simple elementary
course in astronomy. Professor G.
A. Miller will be in charge of the
course, and instead of the require
ments being trigonometry and solid
geometry as heretofore, only the
descriptive side of astronomical
phenomena will be dealt with. No
such study has been made here for
almost eleven years, when Professor
Hussey was the head of a depart
ment of astronomy.
The new course, besides being
descriptive, will comprise a study
of spectroscopy, and the discov
eries made by means of the spec
troscope in the last forty years.
These discoveries include the rate
of the movement of stars, and star
composition. The names of the
constellations, and their individual
stars, meteors, comets,eclipses, and
every phenomenon of the heavens
will also come under the observa
tion of the class. The course is
open to all.
