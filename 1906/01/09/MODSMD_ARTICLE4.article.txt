# CLUBS ARRIVE HERE
## ORGANIZATIONS RETURN AFTER SUCCESSFUL TRIP. Small Deficit Will Probably Be Removed at Final Concert on January 19th. 
### 
The Stanford Musical Clubs
reached the campus to-day after a
very successful trip through the
southern part of the state. The
final concert was given in Bakers
field last night, which netted over
$200 clear, leaving a deficit con
siderably under $100, as a result
of the trip. This is by far the best
showing made on any trip for sev
eral years past. Manager Barrett
expects to more than remove this
amount at the final home concert
on January 19th, in Assembly
Hall.
The Combined Clubs have been
pronounced the best that have ever
taken the holiday trip, and were
enthusiastically received all along
the line. The conduct of the mem
bers was favorably commented up
on by the newspapers as a credit to
their Alma Mater outside as well
as inside the theatres. The Man
dolin Club played especially well,
and were highly praised for their
work. The college songs by the
Glee Club were heartily encored.
The cello solos by Lovell Lang
stroth, 'OS, were well received, his
interpretation oi the Hungarian
Rhapsody being unusually delight
ful.
The "stunt" by May, '06, Kel
logg, '07, and Bernard, '07, made a
great "hit." The following clip
ping from the RedlaniVs Daily Facts
is an example of the comment upon
it:"The stunts kept the audience
in tears —tears of joy—for they
were really wonderfully clever.
The rehearsal for lvellogg's trage
dy (?) was simply great and
brought down the house. For an
encore Messrs. Kellogg, May and
Bernard gave some take-offs on
popular sports and pastimes, in
cluding automobiling, which were
greatly appreciated."
The members of the clubs were
entertained at the cities in which
performances were given. Notable
among the entertainments was the
launch ride given by the Zlac Row
ing Club of San Diego. In the eve
ning the Stanford Club entertained
at a banquet.
The best houses were had at
Bakersfield, San Diego, Santa Bar
bara, Pasadena and Redlands.
Thirty men took the trip, giving
fifteen concerts in all. Concerts
were given in the following places:
San Jose, Santa Cruz, Salinas, San
Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ven
tura, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Santa
Ana, San Diego, Riverside, Red
lands, San Bernardino, Pomona
and Bakersfield.
