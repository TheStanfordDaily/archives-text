# TRACK WORK TO BEGIN
## TRAINER MOULTON WANTS MEN OUT THIS WEEK. All the Old Men Are Expected to Return and Outlook Is Bright. 
### 
Track work will begin at once,
and Trainer Moulton requests that
all the men come out for work this
week if possible. Strict training
rules will not go into effect until
about February Ist, which is the
usual date. However, the trainer
will be out at the track every day
from ten to twelve in the morning,
and from three to six in the after
noon, and expects to have all the
candidates begin light training.
During vacation considerable
work was done toward improving
the oval. Cinders are now being
put on the track, and it will soon
be in good condition.
As far as it is possible to learn
at present most of the veterans will
return to-day or to-rnorrow. Cap
tain Macfarland and J. O. Miller,
'08, both registered to-day, and
Trainer Moulton said that he ex
pected all the old men to return,
it is too early to find out whether
any Freshmen with track ability
will enter this semester, but it is
safe to say that there will be one
or two valuable additions to the
track squad. Altogether, the out
look is very bright, and work will
begin immediately.
