## REGISTRAR'S OFFICE ESTABLISHES WAITING LIST. Issues Pamphlet Defining the Entrance Requirements Necessary for Freshman Women. 
### 
The Registrar has formulated a
plan of admission for women stu
dents, which may be obtained in
pamphlet form on application at
his office.
No radical changes have been
made in the regulation of the en
trance of women students, but the
old provisions have been system
atized and several new provisions
made whereby the five hundred

limit may not be ex
ceeded.
Graduates of this
UDiversity and of uni
versities of equivalent
standing will be ad
mitted without previ
ous application, and
women once admitted
may complete their
courses in the regular
manner.
To take effect after
January, 1906, the en
trance of Freshman
women will he regu
lated as follows: ap
plications must state
the proposed time of
entrance at the time
of the presentation of
credentials. "To in
sure consideration,ap
plications must he

formally renewed within ten months
of the proposed date of entrance."
This last provision would seem to
indicate that applications mu6t be
filed at least ten months before en
trance.
The pamphlet further states that
next August there will be room for
approximately 150 more women.
Continuing the custom already in
force, the University will admit no
women without full entrance
standing. Anticipating that there
will be more than this number de
siring admission next semester, the
Registrar will begin a numbered
list on the first of July, applicants
being listed according to the date
of their original applications.
Those failing to secure entrance
in August, on request, will secure
preference on the January, 1907,
list, which will be begun on the
first day of October, 1906.
The purpose of the system seems
to be to regulate the entrance of
women, not by raising entrance re
quirements, but rather by estab
lishing a waiting list.
