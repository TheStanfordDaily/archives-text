The scheme of dividing Encinft
Hall into three parts should meet
with the disapproval of the student
body. Since the beginning of the
University Encina Hall has been
as it now is, and Encina men have
been uniformly proud of their dor
mitory. Because they have been
housed where communication was
easy there has been a larger list of
acquaintances on the part of each
student. Situated as Stanford is,
the students have always been
thrown into cloee contact with each
other, and from these acquaint
ances they derive a benefit that is
equal to that derived from their
studies. Anything that tends to
separate the students to any degree
is detrimental, and a division of
the Hall into three parts would
probably result in a rivalry of the
different sections, which might or
mif'ht not be beneficial. Besides,
ti Hall as it now stands is a grand
st ucture, and partitions inside the
building would spoil it.
The reasons advanced for this
proposed change are two: that
smaller dormitories work well in
other universities; and that the
change would probably do away
with any disturbances in the
Hall. The argument that we
should follow the Eastern cus
tom is not a very strong one —
conditions are different in the West
than they are in the East. The
spirit is freer here and students are
not so prone to "clique" as they
are in the East, where a number of
dormitories are probably necessary
for this very reason. The conten
tion that such a partition would
rAonU J i the so
or may
tbably re
uun. tmougn rivalry in just the
evil that iB being sought to be
avoided. But in any event, before
the Hall is divided every other
means ought to be sought to attain
the desired ends. And among the
plans that should be tried is a stu
dent government plan which is pos
sible of meeting the approval of the
students living in the Hall.
