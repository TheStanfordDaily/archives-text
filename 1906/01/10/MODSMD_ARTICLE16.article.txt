# CHANGES IN ECONOMICS 1.
## Will No Longer Be Given as An Optional Two- or Three-hour Course. 
### 
The course in Economics 1,
which will be given this semester
by Professor A. C. Whitaker, will
hereafter be a straight three-hour
course. Last semester it could be
taken either as a two- or three-hour
course, with two lectures and one
quiz a week, but this term Whita
ker proposes to make it a straight
three-hour lecture course. Last se
mester it was announced that Eco
nomics 1 would be a deferred
course, and on the cards sent out
in December the hours made in it
are marked as deferred hours.
Professor Whitaker made the an
nouncement this morning that the
course had been changed and that
the hours were no longer deferred,
but would be granted to all those
who passed the course last semes
ter.
Those who have already regis
tered for eighteen hours including
Economics as a two-hour course
will he compelled either to take a
substitute for it or to do three
hours' work for two hours' credit.
