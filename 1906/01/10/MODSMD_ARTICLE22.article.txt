# PREPARE FOR CARNOT
## ELIGIBLE DEBATERS STUDY FOR TRY-OUT DURING HOLIDAYS. Ten Candidates for Places.â€”Debate Will Be Held at California in February. 
### 
During the holidays the candi
dates for the Carnot debating team
have been busy studying the ques
tion and arranging the material
for the final try-out, which will be
held shortly. The general field for
study this year is "The Foreign
Policy of the Third Republic."
Like all Carnot questions, the one
to be discussed this year is broad,
and one from which many precise
resolutions can be evolved. But,
in general, those who have been
studying the question incline to the
belief that it is as satisfactory and
particular a one as can be submitted
under the present Carnot system.
The Stanford team will be picked
from a list of ten eligibles, of these
five having had such previous ex
perience on debating teams that
they may be called veterans.
Leading in point of experience is
D. D. Sales, '06, who was a member
of the Carnot team which last year
so completely outclassed the Cali
fornia representatives, and whose
valuable service on the intercol
legiate trio last spring aided in
bringing the Hearst trophy to
Stanford. Closely following Sales
in point of experience come W. L.
Blair, '06, C. S. Osgood, '06, J. L.
Maloy, '06, and E. A. Cunha, '06,
all of whom have been prominent
in debating work and each of whom
has at some time qualified as a
regular member or alternate on
some one of the intercollegiate
teams. These five men constitute
the veteran material from which
the Carnot trio may be drawn.
But there are still five other
debaters who are eligible to enter
the try-out. These are J. W. Ma
loy, '07, J. F. Brennan, '07, W. A.
Campbell, '07, W. F. Herron, '08,
and I. D. Gibson, '07. These men
qualified for the final try-out last
semester, when they were successful
in competition with many others
in a preliminary contest. All have
had considerable experience on
class teams or in literary societies,
and with these men in the contest
it is by no means a certainty that
the team will be chosen entirely
from among the five more ex
perienced debaters.
According to the terms of the
Carnot agreement the debate will
be held at California this year on
the first Friday in February.
