# PLAN TO DIVIDE ENCINA HALL
## Doctor Jordan Discusses Plans and Reasons for Proposed Change. 
### 
There have been constant rumors
circulating among the men who
live in Encina Hall in regard to
the suggested division of the dormi
tory into two or three sections.
The Encina men gained the im
pression that the Hall was to be
divided in half by a solid partition.
This is causing much discussion
and especially in regard to the
club-room, which the men feared
would be divided.
When interviewed in regard to
this matter Doctor Jordan said:

"All the large modern Eastern
dormitories are divided into smaller
sections —somewhat on the idea of
flats. I visited dormitories at the
University of Pennsylvania and
Swarthmore College, and at both
these institutions this system was
successful.
"As now suggested, the second,
third, and fourth floors of Encina
will be divided into three sections.
The first floor will remain just as
it is at present. This will allow all
men the privileges of the club-room.
"The proposed plan is not at all
of recent origin. It was suggested

during the first year of the Uni
versity, but no necessity arose for
making the change.
"The object of this proposed
change is to gain more privacy for
the residents of the Hall and also
to prevent men from congregating
in such large numbers. By this
method the University authorities
hope to prevent hazing and rioting,
which has gone on recently.
"No actual steps have been taken
in regard to this division of the
Hall, but if it is architecturally

possible, the change will probably
be made. However, it is certain
that no work will be done until
next summer, and in the meantime
plans will be considered and the
cost estimated."
C. E. Hodges, University archi
tect, when interviewed this after
noon stated that he knew nothing
definite in regard to this change,
but he had heard rumors of the
proposed plan. It has been re
ported that a San Francisco archi
tect has been consulted in regard
to the matter, but this rumor could
not be confirmed.
