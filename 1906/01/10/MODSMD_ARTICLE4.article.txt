# REGISTRATION IS HEAVY.
## Large Number of Students Entered in the University at Five O'clock To-night. 
### 
At five o'clock to-night 1408 stu
dents had registered in the Uni
versity, 48 registering to-day.
Of this number 75 are new stu
dents. These figures compared
with those of last year at this time
are much larger, there being a
total of but 1292 at that time, of
which 56 were new students.
The registration for the year now
amounts to 1753, with a Freshman
class of 701, which is by far the
largest which has ever entered
Stanford.
The number of women students
registered has not yet been deter
mined, but is almost sure to go to
the limit of 500 before registration
is completed.
The number of graduates and
special students is also yet in

doubt and cannot be determined
for some little time. Last semes
ter the total number of all students
taking work in the University was
1603, which exceeds the present
figures by about 200.
