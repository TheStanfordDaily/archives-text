# NO MONEY FOR TRACK
## CORPORATION STATES POSITION REGARDING IMPROVEMENTS. Treasury Exhausted on Football Field.—Apathy of Students Does Not Warrant Further Expense. 
### 
If present conditions are not ma
terially changed in the immediate
future, the coming intercollegiate
track meet must again be held on
the oval, or if the weather should
be so unfavorable as last year,
Stanford may not be able to hold
the meet on her own territory at
all. Such in substance were the
statements made this morning by
Dr. Frank Angell, senior member
of the Training House Corporation,
and Trainer "Dad" Moulton. Dr.
Angell says that the present finan
cial status of the corporation does
not warrant the expenditure of
money on a new track, and "Dad"
Moulton says that the old track is
in such bad shape that on a very
rainy day it would be impossible to
hold a meet there.
The facts and figures which
called forth these declarations are
perhaps unknown to the student
body at large.
Dr. Angeil explains the financial
condition as follows: There is no
money at hand for the needed
work except that derived from the
one dollar assessment just levied
on the student body. Up to noon
to day G46 men had paid this as
sessment and 291 women, which
makes an aggregate of $791.50 after
subtracting the half of the 291 as
sessments which goes to the women's
athletic fund. Now, in Dr. Angell's
opinion, a thousand dollars would
put the new track in "good shape,"
while "Dad" Moulton thinks it
could be done for even less. On
the face of the proposition as it thus
stands there would seem no reason
for not pushing the intended work
to completion. Hut there are out
standing debts against the Training
House Corporation, three notes to
the amount of $1000 each, for
which members of the faculty are
personally responsible. These three
notes represent the indebtedness in
curred in the construction of the
new football field. One of these
notes falls due on the 18th of this
month, and as stated above there
is -to date but approximately $800
to meet it, with but little prospect
of more being added. Apparently
these men are going to be personal
ly liable for the $200 necessary to
meet the note coming due, and un
der such circumstances, in which
they are placed by the apathy of
the student body as evidenced by
the failure of 500 to pay the one
dollar assessment, they do not feel
justified in further obligating them
selves by incurring additional per
sonal liability in order that a new
track may be built.
In the words of Dr. Angell, the
position of the three directors of the
building work is simply this: "If
the student body would evidence a
vital interest in the proposed
schemes of improvement by will
ingly 1 paying the special assess
uTiit . ; u bv agreeing to another
;• rh« nt the first semester of

next year we would be able to meet
the note coming due and would
willingly go further in debt in or
der to hasten to completion the
building of a new track this
spring."
Trainer Moulton declares em
phatically that if a new track is
not constructed this spring, the
work cannot be done during the
summer. He bases this statement
on his long experience in this line
of work, during which time he has
personally superintended the con
struction of many tracks. Grading
cannot be done during the dry
months, and a newly constructed
track should he given at least one
rainy season in which to settle. If
the work is not done in the spring,
the trainer declares it will be use
less to begin it until after another
rainy season, which would not be
until late next fall. With the foot
ball men housed in comfortable
training quarters and practicing on
a new field, he thinks it would be
difficult to get men out for track

work next fall, which would seri
ously jeopardize our chances in the
'07 meet. But these evils are the
minor ones in Moulton's opinion.
So worn out is the old track, he de
clares, that if the day of the field
meet should be such as last year,
Stanford would be confronted with
the ignominious admission that she
had no suitable place to hold the
meet. He is positive that the old
track will not stand any siege of
bad weather.
This is the situation as the vet
eran trainer sees it, and he thinks
the present state of affairs reflects
seriously on Stanford's interest in
athletics.

condition as follows: There is no
money at hand for the needed
work except that derived from the
one dollar assessment just levied
on the student body. Up to noon
to day G46 men had paid this as
sessment and 291 women, which
makes an aggregate of $791.50 after
subtracting the half of the 291 as
sessments which goes to the women's
athletic fund. Now, in Dr. Angell's
opinion, a thousand dollars would
put the new track in "good shape,"
while "Dad" Moulton thinks it
could be done for even less. On
the face of the proposition as it thus
stands there would seem no reason
for not pushing the intended work
to completion. Hut there are out
standing debts against the Training
House Corporation, three notes to
the amount of $1000 each, for
which members of the faculty are
personally responsible. These three
notes represent the indebtedness in
curred in the construction of the
new football field. One of these
notes falls due on the 18th of this
month, and as stated above there
is -to date but approximately $800
to meet it, with but little prospect
of more being added. Apparently
these men are going to be personal
ly liable for the $200 necessary to
meet the note coming due, and un
der such circumstances, in which
they are placed by the apathy of
the student body as evidenced by
the failure of 500 to pay the one
dollar assessment, they do not feel
justified in further obligating them
selves by incurring additional per
sonal liability in order that a new
track may be built.
In the words of Dr. Angell, the
position of the three directors of the
building work is simply this: "If
the student body would evidence a
vital interest in the proposed
schemes of improvement by will
ingly 1 paying the special assess
uTiit . ; u bv agreeing to another
;• rh« nt the first semester of

next year we would be able to meet
the note coming due and would
willingly go further in debt in or
der to hasten to completion the
building of a new track this
spring."
Trainer Moulton declares em
phatically that if a new track is
not constructed this spring, the
work cannot be done during the
summer. He bases this statement
on his long experience in this line
of work, during which time he has
personally superintended the con
struction of many tracks. Grading
cannot be done during the dry
months, and a newly constructed
track should he given at least one
rainy season in which to settle. If
the work is not done in the spring,
the trainer declares it will be use
less to begin it until after another
rainy season, which would not be
until late next fall. With the foot
ball men housed in comfortable
training quarters and practicing on
a new field, he thinks it would be
difficult to get men out for track

work next fall, which would seri
ously jeopardize our chances in the
'07 meet. But these evils are the
minor ones in Moulton's opinion.
So worn out is the old track, he de
clares, that if the day of the field
meet should be such as last year,
Stanford would be confronted with
the ignominious admission that she
had no suitable place to hold the
meet. He is positive that the old
track will not stand any siege of
bad weather.
This is the situation as the vet
eran trainer sees it, and he thinks
the present state of affairs reflects
seriously on Stanford's interest in
athletics.
If present conditions are not ma
terially changed in the immediate
future, the coming intercollegiate
track meet must again be held on
the oval, or if the weather should
be so unfavorable as last year,
Stanford may not be able to hold
the meet on her own territory at
all. Such in substance were the
statements made this morning by
Dr. Frank Angell, senior member
of the Training House Corporation,
and Trainer "Dad" Moulton. Dr.
Angell says that the present finan
cial status of the corporation does
not warrant the expenditure of
money on a new track, and "Dad"
Moulton says that the old track is
in such bad shape that on a very
rainy day it would be impossible to
hold a meet there.
The facts and figures which
called forth these declarations are
perhaps unknown to the student
body at large.
Dr. Angeil explains the financial
condition as follows: There is no
money at hand for the needed
work except that derived from the
one dollar assessment just levied
