# LIBRARY WILL BE DELAYED.
## According to Recent Plans New Building Will Be Thoroughly Fireproof. 
### 
There are plans on foot now to
tear out much of the woodwork in
the new Library, and to substitute
iron beams Hnd joists. This lias
been decided upon in order to elim
inate any possible danger of fire,
and to make the building entirely
safe.
Although the Library would be
virtually fireproof from an under
writer's point of view if completed
on the present lines, it was believed
to be a more profitable undertak
ing to take out some of the wood
work, and to make the building
absolutely safe from conflagrations.
The main rotunda of the edifice
and the two main wings will prob
ably undergo this change. Wooden
floors have already been laid, and
many wooden braces and joists set
up. These will all be removed and
steel girders will be laid in their
places. This will likely necessitate
firmer brick and stonework, and
will thus considerably lengthen the
time before completion.
Besides these changes, the walls
of the building will be fireproofed
in the most modern way. Flues
and masonry work, together with
well protected electric wires and
steam pipes, will complete the pre
cautions.
As no set time has been an
nounced for the completion of the
Library building, the fact that it
will be delayed will break no con
tract. The length of the delay is
not certain, but it will in all prob
ability be close upon eight months
or a year.
