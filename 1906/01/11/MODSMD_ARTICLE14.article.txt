# COMMITTEE SUSPENDS MEN.
## Disturbances in Encina Last Semester Result in Rigid Investigation and Action. 
### 
Two men were dropped from the
University rolls as the result of a
prolonged session of the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs,
which has occupied the past two
days. The immediate cause of this
radical action on the part of the
committee was a disturbance
which took place in the Hall late
last semester over the tubbing of a
Freshman, in which the condemned
men were alleged to have been
implicated. The committee, how
ever, presented a great mass of evi
dence to the effect that the accused
were incorrigible rioters, and their
presence in Encina was detriment
al to law and order in the Hall.
The peculiar phase of the whole
proceeding seems to lie in the fact
that the men who were suspended
from the University were given no
inkling last semester or during
vacation of the fate which was in
store for them. In fact they were
permitted to return to Stanford
and register, and then without any
particular warning they were
called before the committee and in
formed that their presence here
was no longer desirable.
It is rumored that there will be
more sessions of the committee
over the disturbances in the Hall
which marked the close of the se
mester, and that more men will
probably be suspended from En
cina, if not from the University.
