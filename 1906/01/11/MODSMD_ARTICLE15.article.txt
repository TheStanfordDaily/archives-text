# May Postpone Benefit Concert.
## 
### 
The concert by the combined
musical organizations of the Uni
versity, announced last semester to
be given on January 19th in As
sembly Hall, may be postponed
until a later date in order that the
home concert of the Glee and Man
dolin Clubs may be given that eve
ning. The Combined Clubs desire
to give the final concert as soon as
possible after the holiday trip,
while still in excellent practice.
The concert arranged last semes
ter was to be given to pay for the
new piano in Assembly Hall. The
matter is now being considered by
Professor C. Searles, of the Ro
manic Languages department, and
Manager Barrett, and definite ar
rangements will be announced
shortly.
