# HODGE WILL NOT PLAY
## STANFORD'S TENNIS CAPTAIN RESIGNS HIS POSITION. California May Also Be Crippled. The Cardinal Has Much Untried Material. 
### 
The University Tennis Club will
meet sometime next week to con
sider plans for the coming semes
ter and also to elect a tennis cap
tain. G. A. Hodge, '06, the pres
ent captain, will be unable to play
this spring on account of the pres
sure of college work, and has re
signed his position as captain.
The loss of this man, undoubt
edly the beet player in college at
present, greatly decreases Stan
ford's chances of winning the inter
collegiate tennis this year. Hodge
made an excellent showing last

year, taking the first set from
Wayne, the California representa
tive, in easy style, and only losing
the match after the rain had made
the court and balls unfit for "use.
Although greatly crippled by the
loss of the tennis captain, Stanford
has several promising players on
the squad, any of whom would
give a good account of themselves
in a contest with the Blue and
Gold representatives.

A. R. McSwain, ex-'OB, who
played the second match in the
singles last year, has not returned
to college, and this leaves the ten
nis club with only one veteran, J.
F. Cassell, '07, the present Univer
sity champion, who played in the
doubles match with G. A. Hodge,
'06, last year.
Although it iB not definitely
known, it has been rumored that
the California doubles team, Claude
Wayne and R. H. Variel, will not
again represent the State Univer
sity. It is certain that Wayne will
not play, California's champion
preferring to try baseball this
spring.
This condition of affairs will
leave California with one veteran,
Neill Baker, who defeated A. R.
McSwain, ex-'OB, in the intercol
legiate tournament last spring. If
the report that Wayne and Variel
will not play proves to be true,

Stanford should stand an equal
chance of winning the tennis in the
coming contest.
Herbert Long, who has made a
reputation for himself upon the
California Club courts, is at the
University of California, and in
addition there is a good deal of un
tried material at that institution.
At Stanford there are several good
players, but nearly all are untried
in biu; tournaments.


G. A. Hodge
