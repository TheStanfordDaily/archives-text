# ALL-AMERICA ELEVEN
## CAMP AND WHITNEY MAKE FOOTBALL SELECTIONS. Both Say Last Season's Material Was Very Mediocre as Compared to that of 1904. 
### 
Walter Camp and Caspar Whit
ney, who are probably the closest
students of intercollegiate foot
ball in America to-day, have an
nounced their selections for an
all-America team for the season of
1906. Both of the experts refuse
to consider the claims of any of
the members of the Michigan and
Minnesota teams, as they claim
that the rottenness of athletics at
these two universities does not en
title their teams to serious consid
eration.
Camp and Whitney agree only
on six men, and one of these, Ecker
sall of Chicago, is picked for quar
ter by the Yale expert, while VVhit
ney again places him at full-back.
Of last year's all-America teams
but three stars remain: Eckersall
of Chicago, Torney of West Point,
and Shevlin of Yale. Eckersall,
as the greatest punter and drop
kicker in the country, was prac
tically assured of a place on both
teams regardless of the position in
which he was played.
Of the seventeen men who com
pose the two teams, Yale has four,
Harvard four, Pennsylvania two,
and Princeton one; of the smaller
Eastern colleges, Amherst, Dart
mouth and West Point have one
man apiece; while the Middle West
has two representatives, both from
Chicago. Michigan for the first
time in five years is without a
representative.
Both experts lament the great
lack of really first-class line men
on all of the big teams, a lack
which is only partially compen
sated by fast backs and brilliant
ends. Whitney considers Yale,
Harvard, Pennsylvania, Chicago
and Dartmouth the five leading
teams in the country. He gives
Harvard credit for the greatest ad
vancement over last year's eleven,
and pays high tribute to Reid, the
California coach.
Camp's team is as follows: Ends,
Shevlin, Yale, and Glaze, Dart
mouth; tackles, Sampson, Penn
sylvania, and Squires, Harvard;
guards, Tripp, Yale, and Burr,
Harvard; center, Torrey, Pennsyl
vania; quarter, Eckersall, Chi
cago; half-backs, Roome, Yale, and
Hubbard, Amherst; full-back, Mc-
Cormick, Princeton. Whitney sub
stitutes Brill of Harvard for
Squires of the same university as
tackle; Catlin of Chicago for Glaze
of Dartmouth as end; Hutchinson
of Yale for Eckersall of Chicago as
quarter; Torney of West Point and
Hurley of Harvard for Camp's
half-backs; and Eckersall of Chi
cago for McCormick of Princeton
as full-back.
