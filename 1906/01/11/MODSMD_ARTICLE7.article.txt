The article that appears in this
evening's Daily Palo Alto regard
ing the new track shows a gloomy
outlook for Stanford in this direc
tion. We have the material for a
winning track team and we have a
tried coach for developing this team
to the highest state of perfection.
The only thing that is lacking is
not due to any fault of the Train
ing House Corporation. The fault
seems to lie largely with the part
of the student body who have not
paid their assessment this semester.
Among the five hundred who failed
to pay there are probably a few
who are really financially unable
to meet the one dollar assessment,
but the vast majority are surely
able to pay this amount. The per
sons who are able to pay this as
sessment and failed to do so must
have a feeling that they are not
true to their University, and that
they are reaping benefits which
others are paying for, and are hold
ing back their fellow students and
University by their action. It is
not too late now to pay the assess
ment, and it should be done before
it is too late. A step should be
taken immediately to prevent any
person from voting at a student
body election who has not paid his
or her assessment.
The need of a new track seems
imperative. Last season the track
men labored under unusually hard
conditions, due to the bad state of
the track during the rainy season;
and now the trainer expresses doubt
as to whether the track will weather
the present season. This is surely
a dreadful state of affairs. If the
track is not built this semester it
will seriously jeopardize Stanford's
chances of developing a high-class
team this spring when the meet is
to be held here. If the track is not
built this spring there is a proba
bility of its not being erected the
following year, for the intercollegi
ate meet will not be held here then.
This question of funds is a serious
matter. Stanford last semester took
over another intercollegiate sport,
thus increasing its athletic ex
penses. Football, which is the one
sport which nets a large revenue,
and which supports several branch

es of college activity, is in an un
settled state. If football is radi
cally changed, the receipts will
undoubtedly fall off. With in
creased expenses the future is de
cidedly uncertain for athletic im
provements.
