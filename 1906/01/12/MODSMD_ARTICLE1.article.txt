# PLAY IN FEBRUARY
## SOPHOMORE COMEDY SET FOR EARLY NEXT MONTH. Frequent Rehearsals Will Be Held from Now On.â€”Cast Remains Unchanged. 
### 
The Sophomor* class comedy,
Oliver Goldsmith's "She Stoops to
Conquer," will be presented in As
sembly Hall on Friday evening,
February 9th. The play commit
tee has recently reached this de
cision, and all efforts will now be
bent toward making the perform
ance an artistic and financial suc
cess.
A full rehearsal of the cast was
held yesterday afternoon, for the
first time since the holidays. The
various members of the cast have
all learned their lines, and the
coach, Mrs. J. E. Walker, will devote
all her attention from now until
the date of the production to drill
ing the characters in the interpre
tation of their parts. Rehearsals
will be held at least three times a
week for the present, and it is ex
pected that the number will be in
creased to daily rehearsals before
long. As soon as practicable As
sembly Hall will be utilized for the
preliminary meetings of the cast.
Two posters will be issued to ad
vertise the play, the first of these,
a plain card, being expected in a
few days. Immediately before the
date of the show a more elaborate
and artistic advertisement will ap
pear.
No changes have been made in
the personnel of the cast, although
the illness of Miss A. Ellerbeck,
who was originally assigned a lead
ing part, may necessitate a shift
ing among the female parts.
