The action of the Student Af
fairs Committee in dealing with the
men concerned in the hazing and
tubbing in the Hall seems to have
been rather severe. A certain
amount of hazing and tubbing is
undoubtedly good for some Fresh
men; but if it is determined to put
an end to these so-called disturb
ances, the result may be accom
plished by suspending men from
the University. But this is drastic
action and probably spoils the col
lege life of the individual con
cerned. Compelling a student to
give up his residence in Encina
Hall and move away, putting him
to great inconvenience and separ
ating him from his friends, is no
light punishment. It would seem
that it is possible to attain the
desired ends without suspending
students. And it is well to re
member the fact that persons at
tending college are at that age
where they are full of life. They
must be allowed some latitude, but
of course must be kept within rea
sonable bounds. The great ques
tion is to determine what are the
reasonable bounds. There has
been a general tendency at Stan
ford to impose restrictions of
doubtful value, and these restric
tions have been gradually increas
ing. It is admissible of some
doubt whether these restrictions
are attaining their desired ends —
and this raises the question
whether these matters are being
dealt with in the right way.
