## TREASURER LATHROP MAKING INQUIRIES. Petition for Links Rests in His Hands.—Probable Location for the Links. 
### 
Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop
has signified his intention of help
ing the golf enthusiasts toward get
ting suitable links. He has decided
that the tract beyond Stanford
Field, the field near the Cooksey
house, and the space north of La
gunita, could not be used on ac
count of their fertility. Mr. Lath
rop has devoted much of his time
to selecting a suitable area. He
may allow the club to use the fields
directly back of Professor W. F.
Durand's residence. This ground
is gravelly and is not so productive
as other parts of the estate, but it
will afford an excellent course.
Mr. Lathrop will also communi
cate with the management of the
Del Monte Hotel, where there are
splendid links, the best in Califor
nia. His inquiries will be made
with a view toward modeling the
Stanford links after those at Mon
terey; to learn the number of acres
needed for golf; and to find out
something in regard to rental and
care. The southern hotel pays
something in the neighborhood of
$1000 for only a portion of the
ground in use for golf.
The matter of definite disposal
of the petition now lies entirely in
Mr. Lathrop's hands. He also con
trols the matters of location and
rental, but since his return from
his trip East he has not had time
to complete all these details.
If Mr. Lathrop rents this land to
the golf club, the holes will prob
ably be laid out with the first
green on the southern slope of the
hill on which Professor Durand's
house is placed. The holes from
there will run about due south
across the level and up on to the
second range of foothills. Here
the course will turn eaßt and then
north, the last hole, in all likeli
hood the ninth, being very near
the first. This plan, if carried out,
will result in first-class links.
