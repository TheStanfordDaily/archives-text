# DEGREES ARE GRANTED
## ACADEMIC COUNCIL ANNOUNCES MID-YEAR GRADUATES. Twenty-nine Men and Women Receive the Degree of Bachelor of Arts. 
### 
The Academic Council of the
faculty met late this afternoon and
granted the degree of Bachelor of
Arts to twenty-nine men and wo
men who completed their under
graduate work at the close of last
semester. The number of graduates
is unusually small this year, as
last January saw forty-five degrees
granted. Another noticeable fact
is the absence from the list of any
men or women who received the
higher university degrees. Last
year seven students received their
degrees in the more advanced
branches of university work. The
list follows:
Bachelor of Arts.
