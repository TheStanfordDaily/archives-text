# REPORT ON ATHLETICS
## COMMITTEE DISCUSSES STATUS OF STANFORD SPORT. Football and Baseball Heavily Scored for Existing Evils Which Demand Reform. 
### 
The first report of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, which waß
given to President Jordan last No
vember, was made public to-day.
The report covers the period of
University sports from October 10,
1904, to December 1, 1905.
While the report commends ten
nis, track and rowing as intercol
legiate sports, it heavily scores both
football and baseball as they are
played to-day.
Commenting on the various
branches of college sport, the re
port says:
Football Should Be Reformed.
"The committee is of the opinion
that the present game of football
should be so changed as to meet
the following objections:
1. The closed formations favored
by the present rules make possible
unfair and brutal playing which
cannot be detected.
2. The game with its corps of at
tendants, and its complicated drill,
has become a business rather than
a sport.
3. The methods of play almoßt
wholly exclude men of medium
weight however quick and agile
they may be. This means that a
large majority of students are shut
out from the game altogether.
4. The game is in no sense a col
lege sport: students do not form
volunteer teams and play football
for sport as they play baseball,
though this was the practice in this
country and still is in England and
Canada.
"The formation of rules to meet
these objections does not lie within
the functions of this committee. It
is, however, idle to expect that any
change save that of abolishment
will meet all the criticism —ignor-
ant and expert —which has been
directed against the game during
the past decade. But the abolish
ment of Rugby football this com
mittee would regard as a very seri
ous loss and misfortune to college
athletics. It is to be remembered
on the one hand that any game
will be played brutally by brutal
players, and on the other, that the
elimination from football of all the
factors which involve the possibil
ity of danger would make it unin
teresting to the players and m«rit
less as a game —a statement which
holds true of most manly sports.
Track Training Beneficial.
"The committee has been glad to
note an increase in the numbers as
well as efficiency of those taking
part in track and field sports: more
than any other branch of college
athletics the track and field con
tests open up une carridre ouverte
aux talents. The training and dis
cipline are beneficial, and in gen
eral the sports as now conducted
are in the most healthful and nat
ural condition of any branch of the
university athletics.
Baseball in Need of Reform.
"The committee considers that
baseball stands on a distinctly
lower level than any other college
sport at this University both as re
gards the spirit of amateurism and
of courtesy and fairness of play.
The rules governing baseball are
professional rules, elaborated by
professional players, and the tricks
and manners of the professional
game are not only imitated but
also applauded in amateur games.
Summer Sail a Menace.
"This committee has as yet had
very little difficulty with the ques
tion of the summer hotel ball play
er which has been 6uch a menace
to college baseball in the East: but
in the town and commercial nines
as they exist on this Coast there
exißt in all probability factors of
still greater danger to amateur
baseball. Teams of this class play
for gate receipts, which mainly go
towards compensating the semi
professional and poorer professional
players comprising the nucleus of
these nines, and it is from teams of
this Hort that most of our varsity
ball players are offered 'induce
ments' of one kind or another to
play during the summer vacation.
The committee has no objections to
make to a student's meeting his ex
penses by professional or semi-pro
fessional ball playing so long as he
is not a candidate for a position on
a varsity team; but it does not
consider it fair that such a player
should compete with strict ama
teurs for these positions, and it ob
jects most strongly to the introduc
tion of'brush league'tricks and man
ners into university ball playing.
Professionalism Must Stop.
"Now the members of this com
mittee do not feel that they have
either the time or inclination to go
outside the University and hunt up
evidence in these matters: when
ever evidence is brought before
them of infringement of the amateur
standards they will investigate the
case as fully and as impartially as
they are able. Their rule of action,
however, as regards amateurism is
and must be that every student is
to be regarded as an amateur who
has not been shown to be technical
ly or virtually a 'professional.'
"But should it appear that the
rule to protect the amateur stand
ard in the University passed by
representatives of the students
themselves was not operative and
could not be made so, that players
on both sides by tacit consent con
nived at the infringement of the
agreement, then the committee sees
but little use in continuing inter
collegiate contests in baseball.
Tennis and Rowing Strong.
"Tennis here as elsewhere main
tains its traditions as an excellent,
gentlemanly sport. The commit
tee would be glad to see more men
taking part in the game. A like
statement may be made in regard
to rowing, which last year was ad
mitted into the intercollegiate fold.
In addition, the rowing men are to
be commended for the spirit they
have shown in overcoming natur
al obstacles in the way of putting
out creditable crews and of getting
enjoyment from the sport. It is to
be hoped that a sport which is so
thoroughly recreative and which
everywhere has maintained a high
amateur standard will be recog
nized and become a fixture at this
University."

to college baseball in the East: but
in the town and commercial nines
as they exist on this Coast there
exißt in all probability factors of
still greater danger to amateur
baseball. Teams of this class play
for gate receipts, which mainly go
towards compensating the semi
professional and poorer professional
players comprising the nucleus of
these nines, and it is from teams of
this Hort that most of our varsity
ball players are offered 'induce
ments' of one kind or another to
play during the summer vacation.
The committee has no objections to
make to a student's meeting his ex
penses by professional or semi-pro
fessional ball playing so long as he
is not a candidate for a position on
a varsity team; but it does not
consider it fair that such a player
should compete with strict ama
teurs for these positions, and it ob
jects most strongly to the introduc
tion of'brush league'tricks and man
ners into university ball playing.
Professionalism Must Stop.
"Now the members of this com
mittee do not feel that they have
either the time or inclination to go
outside the University and hunt up
evidence in these matters: when
ever evidence is brought before
them of infringement of the amateur
standards they will investigate the
case as fully and as impartially as
they are able. Their rule of action,
however, as regards amateurism is
and must be that every student is
to be regarded as an amateur who
has not been shown to be technical
ly or virtually a 'professional.'
"But should it appear that the
rule to protect the amateur stand
ard in the University passed by
representatives of the students
themselves was not operative and
could not be made so, that players
on both sides by tacit consent con
nived at the infringement of the
agreement, then the committee sees
but little use in continuing inter
collegiate contests in baseball.
Tennis and Rowing Strong.
"Tennis here as elsewhere main
tains its traditions as an excellent,
gentlemanly sport. The commit
tee would be glad to see more men
taking part in the game. A like
statement may be made in regard
to rowing, which last year was ad
mitted into the intercollegiate fold.
In addition, the rowing men are to
be commended for the spirit they
have shown in overcoming natur
al obstacles in the way of putting
out creditable crews and of getting
enjoyment from the sport. It is to
be hoped that a sport which is so
thoroughly recreative and which
everywhere has maintained a high
amateur standard will be recog
nized and become a fixture at this
University."
The first report of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, which waß
given to President Jordan last No
vember, was made public to-day.
The report covers the period of
University sports from October 10,
1904, to December 1, 1905.
While the report commends ten
nis, track and rowing as intercol
legiate sports, it heavily scores both
football and baseball as they are
played to-day.
Commenting on the various
branches of college sport, the re
port says:
Football Should Be Reformed.
"The committee is of the opinion
that the present game of football
should be so changed as to meet
the following objections:
1. The closed formations favored
by the present rules make possible
unfair and brutal playing which
cannot be detected.
2. The game with its corps of at
tendants, and its complicated drill,
has become a business rather than
a sport.
3. The methods of play almoßt
wholly exclude men of medium
weight however quick and agile
they may be. This means that a
large majority of students are shut
out from the game altogether.
4. The game is in no sense a col
lege sport: students do not form
volunteer teams and play football
for sport as they play baseball,
though this was the practice in this
country and still is in England and
Canada.
"The formation of rules to meet
these objections does not lie within
the functions of this committee. It
is, however, idle to expect that any
change save that of abolishment
will meet all the criticism —ignor-
ant and expert —which has been
directed against the game during
the past decade. But the abolish
ment of Rugby football this com
mittee would regard as a very seri
ous loss and misfortune to college
athletics. It is to be remembered
on the one hand that any game
will be played brutally by brutal
players, and on the other, that the
elimination from football of all the
factors which involve the possibil
ity of danger would make it unin
teresting to the players and m«rit
less as a game —a statement which
holds true of most manly sports.
Track Training Beneficial.
"The committee has been glad to
note an increase in the numbers as
well as efficiency of those taking
part in track and field sports: more
than any other branch of college
athletics the track and field con
tests open up une carridre ouverte
aux talents. The training and dis
cipline are beneficial, and in gen
eral the sports as now conducted
are in the most healthful and nat
ural condition of any branch of the
university athletics.
Baseball in Need of Reform.
"The committee considers that
baseball stands on a distinctly
lower level than any other college
sport at this University both as re
gards the spirit of amateurism and
of courtesy and fairness of play.
The rules governing baseball are
professional rules, elaborated by
professional players, and the tricks
and manners of the professional
game are not only imitated but
also applauded in amateur games.
Summer Sail a Menace.
"This committee has as yet had
very little difficulty with the ques
tion of the summer hotel ball play
er which has been 6uch a menace
