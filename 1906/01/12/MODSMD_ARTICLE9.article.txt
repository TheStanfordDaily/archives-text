# REPORT ON ATHLETICS
## COMMITTEE DISCUSSES STATUS OF STANFORD SPORT. Football and Baseball Heavily Scored for Existing Evils Which Demand Reform. 
### 
The first report of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, which waß
given to President Jordan last No
vember, was made public to-day.
The report covers the period of
University sports from October 10,
1904, to December 1, 1905.
While the report commends ten
nis, track and rowing as intercol
legiate sports, it heavily scores both
football and baseball as they are
played to-day.
Commenting on the various
branches of college sport, the re
port says:
Football Should Be Reformed.
"The committee is of the opinion
that the present game of football
should be so changed as to meet
the following objections:
1. The closed formations favored
by the present rules make possible
unfair and brutal playing which
cannot be detected.
2. The game with its corps of at
tendants, and its complicated drill,
has become a business rather than
a sport.
3. The methods of play almoßt
wholly exclude men of medium
weight however quick and agile
they may be. This means that a
large majority of students are shut
out from the game altogether.
4. The game is in no sense a col
lege sport: students do not form
volunteer teams and play football
for sport as they play baseball,
though this was the practice in this
country and still is in England and
Canada.
"The formation of rules to meet
these objections does not lie within
the functions of this committee. It
is, however, idle to expect that any
change save that of abolishment
will meet all the criticism —ignor-
ant and expert —which has been
directed against the game during
the past decade. But the abolish
ment of Rugby football this com
mittee would regard as a very seri
ous loss and misfortune to college
athletics. It is to be remembered
on the one hand that any game
will be played brutally by brutal
players, and on the other, that the
elimination from football of all the
factors which involve the possibil
ity of danger would make it unin
teresting to the players and m«rit
less as a game —a statement which
holds true of most manly sports.
Track Training Beneficial.
"The committee has been glad to
note an increase in the numbers as
well as efficiency of those taking
part in track and field sports: more
than any other branch of college
athletics the track and field con
tests open up une carridre ouverte
aux talents. The training and dis
cipline are beneficial, and in gen
eral the sports as now conducted
are in the most healthful and nat
ural condition of any branch of the
university athletics.
