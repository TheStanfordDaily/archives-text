# ASSEMBLY WEDNESDAY
## OREGON'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE TO ADDRESS STUDENT BODY. Governor Chamberlain and Great Party of Excursionists Will Visit the Campus. 
### 
The first University Assembly of
the semester will be held in the As
sembly Hall next Wednesday
morning at 11:15. Governor George
T. Chamberlain of Oregon will be
the principal speaker, and one or
two members of his party will be
called upon to make a few addi
tional remarks.
The occasion for the assembly
will be the presence upon the cam
pus of the great Oregon excursion,
185 strong, which is touring Cali
fornia in a special train. The ex
cursionists include some of the
most prominent and influential
men in the Web-foot State, and their
addresses should be timely and in
teresting. No subject for Governor
Chamberlain's speech has as yet
been announced, and it is probable
that it will be in the nature of an
informal talk.
The excursion will arrive at Stan
ford at 10 o'clock Wednesday
morning, and will remain on the
campus until 12:30, when it will
go on to San Jose. The party is in
charge of William McMurray, the
assistant general passenger agent
of the Harriman lines in Oregon,
and the excursion is made under
the auspices of the Oregon Develop
ment League. The members of the
League desired to show their ap
preciation of California's part in
making the Lewis and Clark Ex
position a success, and to do this
they decided to send a party of
Oregon's most distinguished citi
zens to tour California. The spec
ial train is scheduled to arrive in
San Francisco this evening.
All University exercises will be
suspended during the Assembly
hour. Between the speeches the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs will ren
der some selections.
