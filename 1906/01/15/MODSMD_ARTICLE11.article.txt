In assuming tardy control of the
Daily Palo Alto the editor wishes
first of all to publicly express his
gratitude to L. R. Weinmann, who
so kindly took charge of the paper
for the first week of the present se
mester.
It is wholly unnecessary for the
new management of the Daily
Palo Alto to announce a policy
for the paper, as it will be conduct
ed as in the past. The present
method of covering the news field
has proven quite successful, but
there is Jstill much room for im
provement, and no effort will be
spared to give the patrons of the
paper the best service possible.
Editorially, the Daily Palo
will continue in its efforts to
honestly express student body
opinion, and to aid him in this by
no means easy task the editor in
vites criticisms and suggestions
from the students.
If the "knocking" of the paper
is done within the editorial sanc
tum, great improvement will sure
ly result, and at the end of his
term the editor may hope to retire
with more friends than enemies in
the student body.
