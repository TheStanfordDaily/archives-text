## STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA NOT REPRESENTED. Amalgamation of Football Rules Committees Occurred Last Friday. 
### 
At a meeting of the Football Rules
Committee in New York City last!
Friday it was voted by the mem
bers present to amalgamate with
the new committee appointed by
the so-called conference recently
held in New York at the invitation
Qf New York University. The
amalgamation of the two commit
tees has resulted in a more evenly
distributed committee, and will
probably result in the formation of
rules adequate to cover the needs
of the various sections of the coun
try. All of the important colleges
and universities which were repre
sented at the New York conference
are represented on the joint com
mittee.
Walter Camp of Yale will edit
the new rules. The officers of the
new committtee are L. M. Dennis,

Cornell, chairman, and W. T.
i Reid, Jr., Harvard, secretary.
There are thirteen men on the new
committee, which includes the en
tire old Football Rules Committee
excepting Robert 1). Wrenn of
Harvard, whose place is taken by
W. T. Reid, Jr., also of Harvard.
As the Pacific Coast universities
were not represented at the New
York conference, no one from this
section has been appointed to the
joint committee. The East has
eight representatives, the Middle
West four, and the South one.
This joint committee will make the
new rules which will be edited by
Walter Camp of Yale.
No action has been taken by the
committee representing California
and Stanford, but it is pvobable
that they will wait until the East
ern committee has issued the new
rules to find out whether it is
necessary to create a separate set
for use on the Pacific Coast.
The joint committee is now com
posed of the following men: John
C. Bell, Pennsylvania; Walter
Camp, Yale; W. T. Reid, Jr., Har
vard; J. B. Fine, Princeton; A. O.
Stagg, Chicago; E. K. Hall, Dart
