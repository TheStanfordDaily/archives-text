## REV. D.C. GARDNER OUTLINES HIS PLANS. Sunday Sermon Devoted to Discussion of College Work Among the Poor. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner pub
licly launched his long cherished
plan for a Stanford college settle
ment in a strong sermon which he
preached from the Memorial Church
pulpit Sunday morning.
In defining the ideal College Set
tlement, the preacher said that it
was not built of bricks, but of per
sons. In other words, a settlement
is composed of a group of refined,
cultured college men and women,
who, for love of their fellow men
and women, choose to settle in
some neglected quarter or tenement
district of a city.
Its. first influence is that of a
home, with the simplicity and dig
nity of the simple life as it is un
derstood by gentlemen and gentle
women, and with that true neigh
borliness which makes a home the
center of kindliness and helpful
ness.
The settlement home at its best
is the mind and heart of the block.
It is the center of neighborly activ
ity, demanding clean streets, stand
ing for the "square deal" in neigh
borhood politics, organizing amuse
ments, protecting the weak and
nursing the sick. In short, the
"settlers" become true neighbors,
and"the almoners of God's bounty
to the multitude of God's poor."
The settlement is the common
center to which will gravitate the
larger minded and the warmer
hearted of the alumni of the city.
The alumni doctors, lawyers, scient
ists, journalists, and women of lei
sure can all lend a helping hand in
the work of social betterment.
Clothing, books, food, fruit and
flowers may be sent for distribution
and by and by will come "fresh
air" funds, and a cottage by the
sea or amid the redwoods for the
ailing children or the tired women
of the slums.
Dr. Gardner pleaded for the set
tlement idea on three grounds: first,
the need attested by settlement
workers and by personal experi
ence; second, for the conservation of
the personal element in Christian
charity; third, because the Stan
ford "S" stands for service.
The service of humanity waß the
animating spirit of the founders of
the University. Service is the true
ideal to-day, and each student
should make his personal motto
the motto of the English king, Ich
dien—l serve.
