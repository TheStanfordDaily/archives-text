# Track in Fine Condition.
## 
### 
"Dad" Moulton desires all the
track candidates to come out on
the track and do light work every
day. The new dirt which has been
spread over the surface has set well
under the rain and the track is , it)
first-claes shape, so that even the
inclemency of the weather* can
have no effect on it.
