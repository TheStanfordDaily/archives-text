# MURPHY ISSUES CALL
## CARDINAL OARSMEN WILL BEGIN WORK AT ONCE. New Rowing Coach Arrives on the Campus.â€”Much Good Material in College. 
### 
"All candidates for Varsity and
Freshman crews will report to me
to-morrow afternoon at Encina
gymnasium. D. J. Murphy."
Coach "Dan" Murphy arrived
on the campus yesterday evening
and will take immediate charge of
the Cardinal oarsmen. Work will
start to-morrow upon the rowing
machines, and this preliminary
training will probably continue
for a week or so until Lake Lagu
nita has sufficient water in it to
warrant the shell and barges being
put into use.
Murphy is very anxious that a
large squad of men should turn
out. "The first requisite for a
winning crew," he states, "is plenty
of material to work upon." All
candidates for the present will
work in Encina gymnasium, and
training-rules will go into effect be
fore the end of the week.
The crews will not row at Red
wood for some time, Lagunita be
ing as good as the larger stretch
for the preliminary work. Al
though it will be difficult to teach
a definite style and stroke the first
season, Murphy will attempt to
have the men take a hard, close
catch and pull all the way through,
ending the stroke with a close
feather.
Stanford has three veterans of
last year's Varsity crew now in
college. All the men who pulled
on the fast 1908 Freshman crew
have returned, and there is also a
wealth of good material which did
not make places on the crews last
year. These facts, taken into con
sideration with Murphy's acknowl
edged worth as a rowing coach,
should augur well for a Cardinal
victory in the next intercollegiate
regatta.
Up to the present time little is
known of the rowing material in
the 1909 class; but there is plenty
of athletic ability in the entering
class, and if the men turn out Stan
ford should have a good Freshman
crew to represent her next spring.
