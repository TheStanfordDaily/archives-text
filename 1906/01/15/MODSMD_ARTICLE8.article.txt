# CONCERT TO BE GIVEN
## MUSICAL CLUBS WILL PLAY FRIDAY NIGHT. Excellent Showing Expected After Successful Tour of Southern California. 
### 
Next Friday evening, January
19tli, at eight o'clock, the Com
bined Varsity Glee and Mandolin
Clubs will give a concert in Assem
bly Hall. After the most success
ful trip ever taken by the clubs,
and with the praise of enthusiastic
crowds in the south to their credit,
an excellent showing is expected
before a home audience.
The program will be much the
same as it was throughout the trip,
with the addition of a few new
songs by the Glee Club. Lovell
Langstroth, '08, will render several
solos on the cello, and the three
stunt men —E. 11. May, '06, 11. S.
Kellogg, '07, and F. H. Bernard,
'07 —will put on the same stunts
that took so well in Southern Cal
ifornia.
The southern press in every case
accords this stunt the place of "the
feature" in the concerts of the clubs.
The skit is a clever take-off on
modern tragedy. Besides this there
are numerous imitations which
made a hit wherever given. In
Pasadena especially the stunt was
well received, and the Pasadena
Daily News says about it:
"Roy Kellogg of Pasadena made
one of the hits of the program in
his amusing stunt, and received a
huge cluster of carnations in the
Stanford red, tied with his college
colors. He was ably assisted by
May and Bernard. This trio had
provided themselves with several
new and really funny jokes and
pranks, and their ludicrous imper
eonitications were capital."
From the Pasadena Evening Star
of January 2d:
"The stunts by Messrs. Kellogg,
May and Bernard more than won
the admiration of the audience, and
were applauded until the young
men were too tired to further re
spond. This organization is be
ing most enthusiastically received
wherever it appears, and makes a
pronounced hit."
In San Bernardino also the skit
was very popular. According to
the San Bernardino Daily Sun:
"The next to the last number on
the program, the 'stunt' by Messrs.
Kellogg, May and Bernard, per
haps 'took' better than anything
else on the program. This was a
bit of farce, and was well acted
nonsense."
The posters announcing this re
turn concert are very simple, and
contain cuts of the two clubs, the
stunt men, and celloist Langstroth.
The tickets for the concert will go
on sale to-morrow at the Bookstore
and at the University Drug Com
pany in Palo Alto. All the seats
will be reserved, and there will be
but the one admission price of 50
cents.
