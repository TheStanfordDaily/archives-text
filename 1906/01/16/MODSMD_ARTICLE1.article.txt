# PROFESSOR TO TRAVEL
## J.O. GRIFFIN GOES TO EUROPE FOR HEALTH. Head of German Department Will Do Light Work for Six Months or Year. 
### 
Professor Griffin, acting head of
the department of Germanic Lan
guages, who was recently released
from the hospital after a protracted
treatment for deranged eye-sight,
which prevented him from conduct
ing classes after the early portion
of last semester, departed for the
East and Europe to-day on a Sab
batical leave of absence for a year.
The proposed trip, which is to be
taken against Professor Griffin's
will, who says that he would
rather remain at home and work,
is the desire of the specialist under
whose care Professor Griffin has
been since leaving the University
and is recommended as a means of
affording complete rest for his left
eye, whose retina dropped forward
from its socket as a result of over
work. Professor Griffin will travel
direct to Southampton, New York,
where he will visit his brother for a
month or more. After leaving the
United States he will sail for Ger
many, making his headquarters for
a period at Berlin, the home of the
German drama. As Professor
Griffin's stay abroad is not primar
ily for study, he will register at no
university. The chief work which
he intends to do is in amplification
and development of Course 4 in
German, entitled "Modern German
Drama," which he gave at Stanford
until forced to withdraw from par
ticipation in University affairs on
account of his eyes. Whatever
study he will make from books
must be carried on by having mat
ter read to him. Lectures and the
theatres he will attend at leisure,
always on the lookout for ad
ditional knowledge profitable to
his special investigation.
In the spring, probably about
the first of May, Professor Griffin
will go southward to Freiburg.
Here he will spend Mb time at the
university, pending the recovery
of the use of his eye. If its im
provement warrants, he will return
to America in August, 1906, and
resume work at the beginning of
next semester. If further rest is
necessary, he will spend the sum
mer in Sweden, journeying south
ward again in September. As the
European universities do not open
until October, 60 little time would
be available for study, considering
a return toward the end of the
year, that Professor Griffin pro
poses to start homeward after a
few weeks passed in Germany. Ac
cording to expectation, Professor
Griffin will return, at the latest, in
next December, and resume his
regular classes at the University at
the beginning of the second semes
ter of 1906-7.
