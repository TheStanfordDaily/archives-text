# COMMITTEE IS NAMED
## IMPORTANT ACTION TAKEN AT CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK. Chairman Dennis Names Sub-committees of American Intercollegiate Football Committee. 
### 
The two football rules commit
tees which amalgamated in New
York last Friday night decided
that the joint committees shall be
known officially as the American
Intercollegiate Football Committee.
At all meetings eight members will
constitute a quorum and eight of
the total of fourteen votes shall
constitute the official vote of the
committee as a whole. Professor
L. M. Dennis, of Cornell, member of
the old football rules committee
and chairman of the joint commit
tee, announced four sub-committee√ü
that shall report to tlie full com
mittee, which will meet in New-
York City January 27th. The sub
committees are: On provisions for
eliminating brutality and foul
play; on suggestions looking for
ward to the opening of the game;
on suggestions as to the ways and
means of appointing a central
board of football officials; on
propositions looking forward to a
field laboratory, at which sugges
tions of the playing rules shall be
practically demonstrated.
The joint committee of California
and Stanford will meet in San
Francisco next Saturday afternoon.
They will do one of three things at
the conference: either vote to adopt
the new rules about to be made by
the American Intercollegiate Foot
ball Committee; adopt the Rugby
game as played in Canada or New
Zealand; or make a new set of
rules for use on the Pacific Coast.
The report that Patrick O'Dea,
the famous Wisconsin punter and
drop-kicker, would confer with Dr.
Jordan regarding the proposed
changes in the football rules, is a
mistake.
