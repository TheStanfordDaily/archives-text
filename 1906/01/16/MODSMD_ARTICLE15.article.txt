# BAND TO BE ACTIVE
## FIRST MEETING SET FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. Organization to Present Play and Give Promenade Concert During Semester. 
### 
The University Band will hold
its first regular meeting for the se
mester on Thursday evening in the
old band-room, when the election
of officers will be held and plans
for the benefit play to be given in
April will be discussed. All the
former members of the organiza
tion are urged to be present, as well
as any new men who can play any
band instrument. The first prac
tice will be held at the conclusion
of the business meeting. Baritones,
piccolos, and clarinets are especial
ly desired for the band.
It is the intention of the band to
resume the promanade concerts on
the quad as soon as the weather is
favorable. These concerts were
very popular last year. Later in
the semester concerts may also be
given at Lake Lagunita.
The play committee, consisting
of R. V. Fitting, '06, chairman, N.
F. Bradley, '06, A. Ames, '06, D. N.
Richards. '07, and H. C. Keesling,
'OS, will make its report on Thurs
day evening. The performance
will be given in April, the evening
of the intercollegiate track meet. It
is possible that an old time Stan
ford farce will be presented, per
haps one of the most popular of
those given by the college genera
tion preceding the present one.
The play is to be given in order to
reimburse the student body treas
ury for money advanced last year
to pay for new uniforms for the
band.
