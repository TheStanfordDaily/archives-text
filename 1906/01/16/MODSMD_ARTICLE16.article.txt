### 
At the Musical Clubs' concert

tures will be the cello solos of Lov
ell Langstroth, '08. Langstroth
has spent much time studying un
der the masters of to-day, and
throughout the Pacific Coast his
playing is noted as being of the
first order. Especially in San
Francisco has he taken part in
prominent concerts, and he is con
ceded by all who have heard him
to be a most talented musician.
During the recent southern tour
Langstroth's solo was heartily
commended by the musical critics.
The Bakersfield Daily Californian of
January 9th contains warm words
of praise for the clubs in general
and Langstroth in particular. It
praised the celloist in the following
terms:
"While the rollicking songs of
the Glee and the spirited numbers
of the Mandolin Club received

their full share of applause, it was
generally conceded that the real
musical treat of the evening cen
tered in Langstroth, the celloist.
Unassuming in manner, Lang
stroth showed himself to be a per
fect master of his instrument. Hie
conquest was complete. With the
house in an uproar of laughter
when he came upon the stage, he
had but to draw his bow across the
strings in the first rich, compelling
strains of Popper's Hungarian
Rhapsody, and the house was his.
A magnetic personality combined
with a wealth of expression, and a
perfect technique —all went to ac
count for the tumultuous burst of
applause that marked the conclu
sion of each of Mr. Langstroth's
numbers, and forced him to re
spond to encore after encore."
Langstroth will render several
selections on Friday evening, and
his playing will be an excellent ad
dition to the song and mandolin
numbers.
