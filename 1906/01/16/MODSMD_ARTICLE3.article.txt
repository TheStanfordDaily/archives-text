# PRACTICE SATURDAY
## BASEBALL CANDIDATES WILL START WORK THIS WEEK. First Game with St. Mary's for the 27th of January. 
### 
Baseball practice will begin next
Saturday afternoon. Coach Lana
gan and Captain Sales have decided
to get the candidates out and work
ing as soon as possible in order to
get a good line on their ability
during the week of practice before
the first game. Light work will be
the order of the week in batting
and fielding, and the squad should
be in good shape when they meet
St. Mary'son the diamond January
27th. Further announcement re
garding the exact time and place
for reporting for work will be made
later through the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto.
Manager Barrett has scheduled a
series of five games with the fast
St. Mary's team, the first of which,
on the 27th of January, will be the
opening game of the season. The
Oakland institution has met the
Varsity in five game series for the
past five years, and has been al
most uniformly victorious. This
year's team is reported to be espe
cially fast, and they should give
the Varsity the best possible prac
tice. Besides the series with St.
Mary's, Barrett is negotiating for
games with teams from Santa
Clara, St. Vincent's College, Fort
Baker and the Presidio. No defi
nite dates have as yet been ar
ranged with these teams, but Bar
rett expects to have the schedule
arranged very shortly.
An innovation which will be
made this season is the furnishing
of uniform suits for the squad from
the beginning of the season. Coach
Lanagan and Manager Barrett will
go to San Francisco to-morrow to
order fifteen new uniforms. These
will be of the same style and color
as those worn by last year's Var
sity team, except that the cardinal
"S" which was worn by last year's
nine will not be placed on this
year's uniform until the final selec
tion is made of the men who will
meet California. The ordering of
these suits will do away with the
variegated uniforms which have
been the distinguishing feature of
past Cardinal teams early in the
season.
All of the eight Varsity baseball
men who were in college last se
mester have registered already, and
the only serious loss which the
squad has suffered is that of R. H.
Rook, ex-'O6, who has left college
to enter business. Rook was sub
stitute pitcher on last year's team,
but was ineligible to pitch against
California under the operations of
the one-year residence rule. He
pitched brilliant ball in the second
game against Waseda and held the
Japanese batters down to two
scratch hits.
