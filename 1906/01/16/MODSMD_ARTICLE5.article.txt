# DEFENDS HIS ACTION
## MULLEN DENIES ILL-FEELING TOWARD STUDENTS. Proprietor of Hall Says Deputies Were Not Appointed at His Request. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to ask the assistance of
yourself and of your valuable news
paper in an effort to correct, if pos
sible, an erroneous impression re
garding myself and my connection
with a recent minor disturbance at
Mullen's Hall, it having been gen
erally believed, especially among
the Stanford University students,
that I took the lead in a light
against the students on the night
in question and in their persecution
since that time.
In answer to the first charge, I
will say that the hall was leased
from me by the manager of the
Uncle Tom's Cabin company, and
that when so leased my authority
was practically at an end; positive
ly at an end so far as the conduct
of the performance, etc., was con
cerned. It was the manager of the
company, I am informed, who com
plained to the town authorities that
his show was to be rough-housed,
and asked that special officers be
detailed. lam informed that Po
liceman Hill took the matter to the
president and other members of the
town board, and was given author
ity to deputize certain persons to
assist him in preventing a disturb
ance.
I was away from the hall at the
time of the rough-house and the
onslaught by the policeman and
deputies, and knew nothing about
it until after it was all over with.
It was with reluctance that I was
prevailed upon by the town author
ities during the next few days to
file complaints upon which John
Doe and Richard Roe warrants
were issued. I was practically
forced to take this step by the
statements of the town authorities
that if I did not do so I would not
in the future be given police pro
tection at my hall.
I believe the testimony at the
trial that followed was sufficient to
demonstrate that there was no par
ticular call for the presence of the
deputies. The sensational state
ments attributed to me as to dam
ages, revenge, vindication and the
like, were, as you must know and
as time will prove, yarns spun by
writers for outside newspapers.
1 wish it strictly understood that
I have no grievance against the
students; the old timers all know
that, and I want the new arrivals
to know it as well; and I think this
statement over my signature will
assist in convincing the most skep
tical. It has always been my pol
icy to meet the boys face to face
when I had anything to say and
to say it in plain words, â€”and I
want them to accord me the same
sort of treatment.
Trusting you will give publicity
to my statement and do what you
can with the powerful influence of
the Daily Palo Alto to assist in
righting what I believe to be a seri

ous wrong, and again assuring
yourself and all students of my de
sire to do the right thing at all
times, I am
Yours very sincerely,
Peter Mullen.
