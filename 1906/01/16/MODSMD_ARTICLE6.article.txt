# ASSEMBLY TO-MORROW
## DISTINGUISHED OREGONIANS TO SPEAK. Prominent Citizens of Web-foot State Will Visit University and Deliver Addresses to Students. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
the members of the great Oregon
excursion will arrive at Palo Alto,
and will proceed at once to the
campus, where they will be enter
tained until the time of the Assem
bly at 11:15. Among the 185 mem
bers of the party are Governor
George E. Chamberlain of Oregon,
who will be the leading speaker at
the Assembly, and a large number
of the most prominent men of the
Web-foot State, several of whom
will also make addresses. The ex
cursion will leave for San Jose im
mediately after the Assembly to
continue its trip through the south
ern portion of the state.
Among the distinguished Oregon
ians who will be present on the
campus to-morrow, besides Gover
nor Chamberlain, are \V. E. Ma
honey, special correspondent of the
Portland Oiegonian and Telegram,
Henry L. Pittock, one of the pro
prietors of those papers, Tom Rich
ardson, manager of the Portland
Commercial Club and secretary of
the Oregon Development League,
and President H. M. Cake of the
Portland Commercial Club. It is
probable that two or three of these
men will be upon the platform
with Governor Chamberlain at the
Assembly to morrow.
None of the speakers have an
nounced their subjects yet, but it
is probable that they will all treat
of the growing unity of interest be
tween the Pacific Coast states,
which the excursion is intended to
foster. The reception accorded to
the visitors in San Francisco and
the northern portions of the state
through which they have already
passed has been most cordial.
During the Assembly the Univer
sity Glee and Mandolin Clubs will
render selections.
