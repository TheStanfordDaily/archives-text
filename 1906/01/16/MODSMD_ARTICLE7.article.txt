# New Track Will Be Built.
## 
### 
At a meeting this afternoon of
Dr. Frank Angell, Track Captain
Macfarland, J. E. McDowell, Treas
urer Barrett and "Dad" Moulton
it was decided that steps be taken
toward starting work on the new
track. The matter will be brought
before the student body at a meet
ing called by President Cunha for
next Tuesday afternoon.
As soon as the Training House
Corporation is assured that the
student body is behind it, work
will be begun immediately. The
bleachers in use at the present
track will be moved to the new one.
The cost of the track will not be
great, probably in the neighbor
hood of $1000, and the cost of mov
ing the bleachers will not amount
to much.
