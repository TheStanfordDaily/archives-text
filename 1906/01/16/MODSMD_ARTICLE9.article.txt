In the readjustment of the staff
rendered necessary by the retire
ment of last semester's editor, a
number of promotions bave been
made. J. F. Cassell, '07, becomes
managing editor, and H. P. Bittner
will serve as news editor. Both of
these members of the staff have
earned their promotions by faith
ful and unremitting service to the
paper.
The associateship left vacant by
the promotion of H. P. Bittner will
not be filled until the end of a six
weeks' try-out for the place by the
present assistants.
