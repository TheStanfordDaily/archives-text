# PLANNING FOR TRACK
## STUDENT BODY MEETING WILL. BE HELD TUESDAY. Ways and Means for Raising Necesary Funds Will Be Discussed. 
### 
President E. A. Cunha, '06, has
called a meeting of the student
body to beheld in the chapel Tues
day, January 23d, at 1:15. The
purpose of the meeting is to consid
er the advisability of building the
new track this semester, and, if
this is deemed advisable, to discuss
the ways and means of raising the
necessary money. The matter will
be laid open to discussion by the
whole student body and Tuesday's
meeting should definitely deter
mine whether this year's meet with
California shall be held on a new
Stanford track.
At present two plans have been
put forward by the advocates of the
new track. They suggest that a
voluntary subscription, such as
was made for the football field a
year ago, be taken up throughout
the student body, and also that the
student body assessment be raised
next semester from one to two dol
lars. The money raised by sub
scription could be used to meet the
interest on any loans incident to
the construction of the track and
the moving or building of the new
bleachers.
There seems to be a good deal
of doubt, however, as to the pos
sibility of getting the new track
and bleachers into shape for the
California meet in April. It is ac
knowledged that this would require
the most favorable weather condi
tions, and that a long rainy season
would be fatal to the plans of the
builders.
Contrary to the general impres
sion of the student body, work on
the track itself will, at least, be be
gun this semester no matter what
action is taken at Tuesday's meet
ing. Manager Barrett let the con
tract for the preliminary grading
last summer to Steve Anderson, the
Palo Alto contractor, who did some
of the work on the Stanford foot
ball field. As soon as the weather
permits, Anderson will put his
teams to work leveling off the site
selected for the track, which lies be
tween the faculty club-house and
Stanford Field. In case the stu
dent body votes to raise the neces
sary fnnds work will be rushed
and the contracts for the bleachers
will be let at once. According to
Manager Barrett's estimate the
bleachers will cost $6000, while the
work which will be done on the
track this semester will amount to
about $800, which sum can now be
spared from the student body treas
ury.
In case the students decide not
to build the track this year, Stan
ford will have two more years in
which to do the work, and Barrett
believes that this will give the stu
dent body plenty of time to meet
the necessary expenses without
•resorting to extraordinary meas
ures.
At Tuesday's meeting one or two
proposed changes in the intercol
legiate agreement will be brought
up for the consideration of the stu
dents. The committees of the two
universities meet this month, and
minor amendments to the present
agreement are evidently necessary.
