# TO CONTINUE POLICY
## GUILD HOSPITAL WILL ADMIT NON-STUDENT PATIENTS. Third Resident Nurse Appointed. Hospital Has an Efficient Staff Equipment. 
### 
During the present semester at
least, the Students' Guild will con
tfnue its policy of admitting to the
hospital all residents of Palo Alto,
as well as the students and faculty
of the University. The experi
ment of admitting patients not
connected with the University who
live in Palo Alto and vitinity was
first tried last semester, and has
proven such a financial success
that it will be continued.
It is estimated that a saving of
about one-third in the running ex
penses of the hospital has been ac
complished through this new regu
lation. The increase in patients
has necessitated the raising of the
number of nurses from two to five,
but the larger salaries .Jiave been
more than compensated for by the
money received from the non-stu
dent patients treated.
Of the five nurses employed at
present by the Guild at least three
will be retained throughout the se
mester. Miss I. YV. Dawson has
b«en appointed the regular third
nurse, and the two others will be
retained if the number of patients
warrants it.
Miss E. Hayward, '06, the chair
man of the managementcommittee,
whose place during her illness had
been temporarily filled by Professor
C. H. Gilbert, has resumed her po
sition and will continue to act the
rest of the semester.
The efforts of the Guild Board
have been directed from the origin
of the hospital toward increased ef
ficiency in the nursing and equip
ment of service. With the appoint
ment of Miss Dawson to the posi
tion of a regular resident nurse the
hospital has on its permanent staff
three nurses of high efficiency.
Miss C. E. Hogue, '99, who was
appointed executive nurse last year,
has a brilliant record in this line
of work and several special recom
mendations from the hospitals and
doctors with whom she has served.
Miss M. M. H. Du Bose, though
not a Stanford graduate, is well
known here, having acted as head
nurse during the trying times of
the detention hospital at the time
of the first diphtheria outbreak.
Miss Dawson, the newly appointed
resident nurse, is a graduate of the
Children's Hospital in San Fran
cisco.
The equipment of the Guild
Hospital is constantly being im
proved to keep pace with this ex
cellent staff of employes. At the
last meeting it was voted to pur
chase a water sterilizer at a cost of
.$250.

Will Sing at .Friday's Concert.
R. H. Lachmund, 'OG, has suffi
ciently recovered from an attack of
la grippe to sing in the Combined
Musical Clubs' concert next Friday
evening. Lachmund's solos are
known to every lover of music in
the University, and his program
Friday evening will give him am
ple opportunity of using his voice
to advantage. That his songs were
popular before southern audiences
is proved by the following clipping
from the Los Angeles Herald:
"Mr. Lachmund has one of the
finest baritone voices that Stanford
has ever produced. His rendition
of Flegier's "Horn" solo was superb,
and his delightful little encore was
received even more enthusiastically
by the audience than the original
number."
On Friday evening Lachmund
will add to his repertory a new
song from Silvio Hein's latest opera.
Besides this he will sing the "Horn"
solo and "Robinson Crusoe's Isle,"
the two numbers that took so well
on the tour.
