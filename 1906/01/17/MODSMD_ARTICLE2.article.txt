# GOVERNOR CHAMBERLAIN SPEAKS
## Oregon's Chief Executive Talks on "Problems in American Political Life." 
### 
The first student body Assembly
of the semester took place in As
sembly Hall at 11:15 this morn
ing, and was made notable by the
presence of the great Oregon State
Excursion, and by the address of
Oregon's chief executive, Governor
G. E. Chamberlain, who was one of
the members of the party. The
Assembly was exceptionally well
attended, and the entire Oregon
delegation occupied seats facing the
audience on the stage.
After some selections by the Glee
and Mandolin Clubs, President
Jordan made a short speech of wel
come to the visitors, and introduced
Governor Chamberlain as the first
speaker of the meeting. Governor
Chamberlain took for his topic
"Evils in American Politics To
day." After briefly outlining the
chief evils existing at the present
time, he proceeded to point out the
remedies to which America must
look to solve the problem. He
spoke in part as follows:
"Moral obliquity is not confined
entirely to the public service. Re
cent investigations into the affairs
of quasi-public corporations have
brought to light the fact that mil
lions of dollars, saved from the
earnings of labor and of thrift to
protect the breadwinner in his de
clining years and the widow and
the orphan when he has lain aside
life's burdens, have been diverted
frotn their purposes to swell the
coffers of presidents and other of
ficers of life insurance companies.
The end of these investigations has
not yet been reached, but develop
ments have been sufficient to shock
the public conscience, sully the
reputations of senators, financiers
and business men, and to convince
the people that funds which ought
to be treated as a sacred trust have
been used to assist in elections,
national, state and municipal, and
to bribe officials and legislatures
everywhere. And when, forsooth,
these and other distinguished law
breakers are called upon to answer
for their crimes, they bid defiance
to the courts, and refuse to testify
in cases where the people are di
rectly interested.
"And assuming that the condi
tions to which I have called atten
tion exist —for surely no one can
gainsay it —what is the remedy that
should be applied for their eradi
cation?
"First of all, and over all, a public
opinion compelling the same moral
obligation in public as in private
affairs; a public opinion able to
distinguish between the spurious
and the real; in short, a trained
intelligence sufficently diffused
among the people to protect them
at least against the grosser forme
of deception.' Such an opinion
would drive parties to the nomina
tion of men who could not be
bribed—unpurchased and unpurch
asable—'tall men and true, who live
above the fog in public duty and
in private thinking.'
"And, next, quoting again from

the same address of immortal
Washington, I would say, 'Of all
the dispositions and habits which
lead to political prosperity, religion
and morality are indispensable
supports.' In vain would that man
claim the tribute of patriotism who
should labor to subvert these great
pillars of human happiness —these
firmest props of the duties of men
and citizens. The mere politician,
equally with the pious man, ought
to respect and to cherish them. A
volume could not trace all their
connections with private and pub
lic felicity. Let it simply be asked,
Where is the security for property,
for reputation, for life, if the sense
of religious obligation desert the
oaths which are the instruments of
investigation in courts of justice?
And let us with caution indulge
the supposition that morality can
be maintained without religion.
Whatever may be conceded to the
influence of refined education on
minds of peculiar structure, reason
and experience both forbid us to
expect that national morality can
prevail in exclusion of religious
principle.
"And, finally, another remedy iB
the cultvation of a spirit of inde
pendence amongst the electors of
the country. The fearlessness of
President Roosevelt in denouncing
and overthrowing bossism, and
pursuing criminals in his own par
ty, is doing much towards the cre
ation of a spirit of political inde
pendence throughout the country.
I have heard men boast that they
made it a rule of their lives to vote
the ticket of their party as it came
from the party's convention —a poor
compliment indeed to one's patriot
ism aud intelligence. Why should
the citizen vote for any candidate
for office whom he would not em
ploy or trust in his own private
business? The signs of the times
indicate a disposition to break
away from party ties and obliga
tions and to select for official ser
vice those who are known to be
above suspicion of dishonesty. Let
us hope for the rapid approach of
the time when duty to the state
will be placed above loyalty to
party.
"Upon the young men and women
whom this great institution of
learning is sending out must de
volve a part of the duty of cultivat
ing a healthy public opinion in the
state and nation. Our country
needs more than ever before educat
ed and thoughtful men and women.
"God give us men!
A time like this demands
Strong hearts, great minds,
True faith and ready hands —
Men whom the lust of office does
not kill,
Men whom the spoil of office does
not buy;
Men who possess opinions and a
will;
Men who have honor,
Men who will not lie;
Men who can stand before a dema
gogue,

And damn his treacherous
Flatteries without winking;
Pure men, sun crowned,
Who live above the fog
In public duty and in private
thinking."
Governor Chamberlain was fol
lowed by State Senator H. V. Coe,
who spoke briefly of the part that
the universities are playing in the
development of the Pacific Coast,
and especially of the influence that
is being exerted by Stanford. He
emphasized the point that the in
fluence of the University works not
only for the State of California, but
for Oregon and the other states of
the Pacific Slope as well.

of the excursion attended an organ
recital in the Memorial Church,
and left for San Jose at 12:30 to
continue their southern trip.

reputations of senators, financiers

the people that funds which ought
to be treated as a sacred trust have
been used to assist in elections,
national, state and municipal, and
to bribe officials and legislatures
everywhere. And when, forsooth,
these and other distinguished law

A time like this demands
Strong hearts, great minds,
True faith and ready hands —

Men whom the spoil of office does

Men who have honor,

Governor Chamberlain was fol

"Evils in American Politics To
