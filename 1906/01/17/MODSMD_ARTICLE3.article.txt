## TENNIS SQUAD TO ADHERE TO LIGHT RULES. Club Votes to Give Squad Rights on the Courts.-Election of Tennis Captain Deferred. 
### 
At a meeting of the University
Tennis Club held last night it was
decided that the men who intend
to try out for the Varsity tennis
teams this semester must hand in
their names before next Saturday
night at six o'clock. By signing
up for the try-out the men pledge
themselveskeep light training
rules until the competition for
places is over.
These men will be considered the
tennis, squad and will be given
cards, signed by the president of
the club and the student body
treasurer, entitling them to the ex
clusive use of the Encina courts.
All players not on the squad are
expected by the Tennis Club to give
the preference in the use of the
courts to the holders of the cards,
from whom the team to represent
Stanford next spring will be chosen.
For five years Stanford has not
won a victory upon the courts, and
one of the greatest difficulties of
the club has been to prepare the
men for the try-outs. Many stu
dents who play only for pleasure
and recreation keep the courts
from the use of the players who
wish to practice. The creating of
a definite Bquad and the giving of
rights on the courts to them is
aimed to remedy this evil.
The election of a tennis captain
was deferred until after the selec
tion of the team. The officers who
served during the last semester
were unanimously elected to fill
the same positions until next May.
These officers are: President, B. S.
Allen, '06; vice-president, G. E.
Dole, '07; secretary-treasurer, P.
B. Delano, '08: executive commit
tee, J. E. Cushing, '08, W. H.
Swayne, '07.
The question of the date of the
try-out tournament was not decid
ed. After much discussion it was
decided to leave the decision to the
tournament committee, which con
