The determination of the tennis
men to turn out a winning team
this spring is to be heartily com
mended. An uninterrupted series
of reverses has brought the eport
into disrepute, and if it is to retain
its place as an intercollegiate event
something must be done to bring it
up to the standard of the other
Varsity games. In the early days
of the game at Stanford a wealth
of seasoned material brought vic
tory to the Cardinal in spite of the
inadequacy of the facilities for prac
tice. After the new courts were se
cured various spasmodic efforts
were made to revive interest in the
game, but the slipshod manner in
which the tournaments have been
conducted has not impressed the
average undergraduate with the
importance of tennis as an inter
collegiate sport. But the present
plan of compelling the candidates
for the tennis team to observe train
ing rules will do much toward re
storing the support of the student
body to the long-neglected sport.
