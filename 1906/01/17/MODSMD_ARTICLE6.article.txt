If we are to judge by its appear
ance at the Assembly this morning,
the membership of the Mandolin
Club has dwindled greatly since its
return from the southern holiday
tour. This organization is one of
the most expensive interests which
depend for support on the Associ
ated Students, and the failure of
its members to reciprocate for the
favors which they have received
will not increase the popularity of
the club. Last semester in answer
to the profuse promises of good be
havior made by the combined
clubs the student body agreed to
overlook their unsavory past record
and permitted them to make a
holiday tour. It now looks aB if
the Mandolin Club is seeking to
impose on this good nature. If the

I partial appearance of the Mando
j lin Club this morning was not an
act of ingratitude it was at least a
poor advertisement for Friday
night's concert.
