# PRACTICE POSTPONED
## WEATHER PREVENTS WORK ON DIAMOND SATURDAY. Baseball Men Will Meet Monday Afternoon at 1:10 in Room 50. 
### 
The first baseball practice has
been postponed. A week of prac
tically uninterrupted rain has ren
dered the diamond unlit for use,
and the practice which had been
called for Saturday will not be
held. The coating of the infield
has been soaked into a slippery
mud puddle and the outfield is
covered in many places with pools
of water, which would make fielding
practice an impossibility.
On Monday afternoon at 1:10 all
those who intend to come out for
this year's Varsity are expected to
report at room 50 in the Education
department. Coach Lanagan and
Captain Sales will outline their
plans for the season, and will tell
the men what is expected of them.
If the weather permits, active prac
tive will begin the first of next
week, as there will be only a week
of practice before the first St.
Mary's game, which is scheduled
for Saturday, January 27th.
