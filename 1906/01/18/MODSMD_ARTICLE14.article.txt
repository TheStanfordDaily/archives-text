# COLLEGE SETTLEMENT CLASS.
## Women Students Orgsnize to Promote Social Movement. 
### 
The leaders of the Young Wo
men's Christian Association have
been active in starting a class for
the study of settlement work with
the view not only of interesting
students in the undertaking, but
of preparing them with a knowl
edge of the work, its the
ories and methods, so that they
may someday be able to meet any
demand for active service. In the
future the class hopes to found a
college settlement in San Francisco
through the activity of the Stan
ford members.
The first regular meeting was
held Wednesday afternoon and
the class will meet regularly
hereafter. Mrs. H. A. Millis has
consented to lead the class, as she
has a practical knowledge of settle
ment work, having been several
years at Cincinnati, and visited
the largest settlements in Chicago
and New York for the purpose of
study. She spoke of the appeal of
this work to all classes of people,
religious or otherwise, through its
offer of asceticism with warm hu
man interes.
Mrs. Millis then briefly outlined
the work to be taken up: first, the
history, then the theory, and finally
the study of methods in the settle
ment work. Topics were assigned
Miss Smith and Miss Hyatt spoke
on the lines of two of the first lead
ers, Dennison and Toynbee.
