# FEW CANDIDATES FOR CREWS.
## Only Twenty-five Men Turn Out for Both the Varsity and Freshman. 
### 
About twenty-five candidates for
the Varsity and Freshman crews
have turned out for the first
work of the season. Of this num
ber about twelve were Freshmen.
The men were given light work on
the machines and instructed by
Coach Murphy how to hold their
oars and to pull an even stroke.
The work in Encina gymnasium
will be gradually increased until
the men have a fair amount of en
durance and can pull together.
There is a possibility that if the
weather is clear the shell will be
taken to Redwood next Saturday
and a few of the men who rowed
last year given a chance to do a
little light work upon the water
there.
"Dan" Murphy and the boating
men are at present busily engaged
in putting the boat-house at Lagu
nita in shape, and in overhauling
and repairing the four-oared and
two-oared barges. These boats are
in pretty poor shape, several seams
having opened in them.
The men are also handicapped a
present by a lack of oars, there be
ing but five uninjured sculls to
work with. There are two consign
ments due, however, in a few days,
and they will probably arrive be
fore active work in the boats is be
gun.
E. V. Henley, '06, the president
of the Boat Club, is attempting to
arrange for, a boating rally to be
held in the club-room of Encina
Hall. If the necessary speakers
can be secured it is Henley's plan
to hold the meeting next Monday
night.
