# RAIN PREVENTS TRACK WORK.
## Trainer Moulton Wants Candidates Out as Soon as the Weather Will Permit. 
### 
Owing to the heavy rains for the
past week little work has been pos
sible on the track. J. 0. Miller,
'08, was out one afternoon and
found the track in remarkably good
condition, considering the weather.
All the track men are anxious to
get into training, and as soon as
the weather is favorable "Dad"
Moulton wants all the candidates
to come out. E. C. Cope, '08, who
was unable to train last spring on
account of an injury to his foot,
will come out this season. It is
impossible to tell whether Cope
will be able to get into condition,
but if he succeeds he will be a very
valuable addition to the squad.
C. A. Ball, '06, who was a promis
ing hurdler on th« '04 track team,
is expected to come out this spring
and will make a strong bid for
points in the intercollegiate meet.
F. H. Thomas, '08, who came to
college with a good preparatory
school record in the high jump and
hurdleß, will probably come out
this year, and should do well in
these events. Besides these three
additions to the squad there will be
a large number of men out this
year who have already had one or
two seasons of training and may
develop into point winners this
spring. At present the indications
are that there will be an unusually
large number of candidates for the
track team, and Trainer Moulton
announces that work will begin
just as soon as the weather per
mits.
