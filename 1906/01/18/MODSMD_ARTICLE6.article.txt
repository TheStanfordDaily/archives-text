# WILL GIVE CONCERT FRIDAY NIGHT
## Combined Musical Clubs Will Appear Before Stanford Audience in Assembly Hall To-morrow Evening. 
### 
To-morrow evening at 8
o'clock the Combined Glee and
Mandolin Clubs will give a
return concert in Assembly
Hall. The program, which
was carefully selected, was the
same during the whole trip,
and without exception was
well received.
To-morrow evening the
clubs will give practically the
same numbers as they did
while in the south, and which
other audier.cts have with one
accord pronounced of the very
first order. Since the return
of the clubs to the University
they have been practicing
faithfully, and this combined
with the presence and experi
ence gained during the holi
days should insure a good
showing before a home audi
ence.
Besides the numbers which
the clubs render, there is much
excellent individual work.
The "bum" quartette, made up
of H. Park, '0(i, 11. S. Kellogg,
'07, 0. K. Grau, 'OG, and E.
J. Swift, 'OS, presents a clever
take-off on four country
"rubes," and theirattempts at
close harmony. R. H. Lach
mund, '06, has a most exten-

sive repertory, and his baritone
voice is known to every University
music-lover.
The cello solos of Lovell Lang
stroth, '08, are known and appreci
ated in all musical circles. E. It.
May, '06, It. S. Kellogg, '07,and F.
H. Bernard,'o7, put on a skit which
was the decided feature of the holi

clay tour. Nothing further need be
said as to the style and quality of
acting in the "stunt," as the three
participants have already estab
lished their reputations as comed
ians before Stanford people. E. R.
May, '06, will act as accompanist
for the clubs.
