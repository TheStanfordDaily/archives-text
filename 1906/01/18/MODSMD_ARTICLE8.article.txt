# MAY PLAY RUGBY HERE.
## Plans to Have New Zealand and Canadian Experts Play on Campus. 
### 
The New Zealand Rugby Foot
ball team will leave Southampton,
England, about the 20th of this
month, returning home by the way
of New York and San Francisco.
They will be in California about
the 10th of February, and if it is
possible the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee will arrange to have them
play an exhibition game in the
new stadium on the campus.
Word has been received from
the British Columbia Athletic Un
ion that there is a possibility that
they may come to Stanford if a
game can be secured with the New
Zealand team. I)r. Jordan is much
in favor of having the players here
in order to give the experts on the
Pacific Coast a chance of seeing
the Rugby game under the most
favorable conditions.
