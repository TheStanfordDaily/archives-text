## INTERCOLLEGIATE AGREEMENT MAY BE AMENDED. Executive Committee Instructs Stanford Men Who Will Attend Meeting on January 27th. 
### 
The first regular meeting of the
Executive CoYnmittee was held last
night. Important instructions were
given to the three men who will rep
resent Stanford at the meeting of
the IntercollegiateAthletie Commit
tee to be held Saturday, January
27th. In the.present Intercollegi
ate Athletic Agreement, Section 10
of Article II states: "No person
drawing a salary on a university
appointment to do other than man
ual lUbor may compete." The Ex
ecutive Committee instructed the
Stanford members of the Intercol
legiate Athletic Committee to have
thiq clause stricken out. This is
for the purpose of allowing deserv
ing students who occupy positions
in the Library and the various de
partments to compete, without be
ing forced to give up their posi
tions. An amendment is recom
mended to Section 11 of Article II
which will permit a student com
ing from another university of
standing to compete in an intercol
legiate contest before he has been a
student in the university he repre
sents for one year: provided he has
been out of college a year.
Manager Barrett was authorized
by the Executive Committee to
suitably furnish a room in the
training house —built for this pur
pose —for two students to live in,
as a compensation for watching
$nd taking care of the new football
field.
L. R. Weinmann, '06, was ap
pointed to the vacancy on the aud
iting committee, caused by the
resignation of H. E. Savage, '06.
Manager Barrett was also author
ized to pay all Glee Club bills and
some bills which were incurred dur
ing the latter part of the football
season and for the football show.
The Executive Committee also
received an important suggestion
from W. H. B. Fowler, '06, which
is discussed fully in another col
umn.
