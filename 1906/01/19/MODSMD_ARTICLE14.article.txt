# TRY-OUT TO BE HELD
## CARNOT TEAM WILL BE HELD TO-MORROW EVENING. Nine Candidates for Places.— Alden, Cathcart, and Suzzallo Will Act as Judges. 
### 
The main debating event of the
spring semester will occur to-mor
row evening, when the Carnot de
bating team for 1906 will be
chosen.
Nine debaters will compete for
the honor of entering the lists for
the Carnot medal. D. D. Sales,
'06, J. L. Maloy, '06, J. W. Maloy,
'07, W. A. Campbell, '07, J. F.
Brennan, '07, I. D. Gibson, '06, W.
L. Blair, '06, E. A. Cunha, '06, and
W. F. Herron, '08, will contest for
places, and of these Sales alone has
had experience on an intercol
legiate team. Blair, Cunha, and
J. L. Maloy rank next in experi
ence, and the other five have de
bated about an equal length of
time on class and literary society
teams.
The general Carnot subject this
year is "The Foreign Policy of the
Third Republic." Since last No
vember, when this question was
announced, the debaters have been
busy in study upon it, with the
idea of preparing themselves for
the comprehensive discussion of
any resolution which may be
evolved from the general field. As
provided under the Carnot regula
tions, this definite subject will be
submitted to the speakers only
two hours before the time of the
try-out. At the same time, six
o'clock in the evening, the candi
dates will choose the side of the
question which they wish to dis
cuss, and will spend the interim in
collecting their material.
Each contestant will speak twice
in the course of the evening—once
for a period of ten minutes in
presentation of his main argu
ments, and later for three minutes
in a summary of hie former speech.
Upon Professor R. M. Alden of the
English department, Professor A.
M. Cathcart of the Law depart
ment, and Professor A. H. Suzzallo
of the Education department will
fall the duty of picking the team.
Three regulars and an alternate
will be chosen.
.A committee of three ex-Varsity
debaters —H. M. Lewis, '04, F.
Roehr, '04, and A. Sherriffs, '06—
will meet to-night to draw up the
subject for the try-out debate. The
debate will begin at 8 o'clock and
will be held in the chapel.
