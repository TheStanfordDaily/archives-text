# MAY GIVE UP BASKET-BALL.
## But Four Men Turn Out for the First Practices. 
### 
Unless more men turn out for
the basket-ball team the coaches
will be obliged to discontinue this
sport. But four players appeared
for the last practice, and if a
much larger number do not respond
to the call before the end of next
week, basket-ball will have to be
dropped this semester.
All the members of the team
which played at Stockton and near
ly all of last year's squad have re
turned to college, but many of the
men have decided to enter other
forms of athletics this semester and
this accounts for the few men out
for work. Both the coaches and
the captain are much disappointed
at the poor showing and are very
anxious to have enough men on
the floor to continue the sport.
