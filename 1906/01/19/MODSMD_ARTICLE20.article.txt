# PLAY MUST BE POSTPONED.
## Date Intended for Production of Sophomore Comedy Already Taken by Music Committee. 
### 
Although the time first appointed
for the production of the Sopho
more comedy, "She Stoops to Con
quer," is unusually late for this
annual Sophomore event, in all
probability the date for the show
will have to be set a week or per
haps two weeks later than original
ly intended. It was planned to
present the play on February 9th,
but it was ascertained this morn
ing that Assembly Hall had al
ready been engaged for that eve
ning by the Faculty Music Com
mittee who are planning a concert
by the Girls' Glee Club.
The problem which now con
fronts the play committee is
whether the show would be financ
ially successful if produced a week
after the musical concert or whether
it would be advisable to postpone
it still later. The question will be
brought before the class next Mon
day.
