# LECTURE ON JAPANESE ART.
## Henry P. Bowie Explains Paragons. Talk Illustrated by Sekko Shimada. 
### 
Mr. Henry P. Bowie, president
of the Japanese Society of America,
lectured yesterday in the chapel on
Shi Kun Shi, or the Four Paragons
in Japanese Art. The lecture was
illustrated by Mr. Sekko Shimada,
a famous Japanese artist, who
worked while Mr. Bowie talked.
Mr. Bowie explained that the
four plants which are regarded as
paragons by Japanese artists came
to their distinction because of their
typification of noble qualities.
The orchid bends to the inevitable
storm in winter like a wise man,
and raises itself every spring with
the same fortitude as of old. So it
is noble. The bamboo, evergreen,
typifies constancy. The plum tree,
with its all-pervading perfume, and
its beautiful early budding after
the ravages of winter, is character
istic of the young life of the new
year. The chrysanthemum, which
opens in full bloom after autumn,
the Baddest season of the year,
typifies the recuperative power of
mankind.
The technical part of drawing
these plants was illustrated by Mr.
Shimada in progressive outline
sketches. It consists in recogniz
ing and depicting resemblances in
the plants to features of animals
and to characters in the written
language, because of which the
words expressed by Buch char
acters are sometimes applied to the
plants as names. For instance, in
the make-up of the conventional
orchid are found the wasp, the eye
of the elephant, the eye of the
phoenix, and the tail of the rat.
Mr. Shimada made finished pic
tures of each flower, and Mr. Bowie
exhibited several paintings by
other Japanese artistß.
At the close of the lecture the
drawings were distributed among
the audience, and one in particular,
an orchid twining around the re
ceptacle in which it was growing,
inscribed with the name of the
president of the University in Ja
panese, was presented to Dr. Jordan
by Mr. Bowie as a token of Mr. Shi
mada's admiration for him.
