# GREAT TRACK MEET IS PROPOSED
## W.H.B. Fowler, '06, Suggests Plan to Bring Best Preparatory School Athletes Together on Stanford Campus Track—Trophy Offered. 
### 
The Executive Committee at last
night's meeting received a sugges
tion from W. H. B. Fowler, '06,
that a field meet be held each year
at Stanford between all the Cali
fornia preparatory schools, or even
all the secondary institutions of the
Pacific Coast. In order to increase
the interest and asaure the success
of this project Fowler has given a
valuable cup, subject to one con
dition. The Executive Committee
received this suggestion with great
approval, and a committee com
posed of J. C. Macfarland, '07, C.
F. Laumeister, '07, and H. L. Hor
ton, '08, was appointed to take im
mediate action upon the matter.
The proposed plan is fully ex
plained in the following letter:
J. C. Macfarland, Esq.,
Track Captain.
Dear Sir: —May I ask you to
bring formally before the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated
Students the subject of the forma
tion of a Stanford University In
terscholastic Athletic Association,
concerning which I had a confer
ence with you last semester? That
the suggestion may take more defi
nite form, it is my plan to put
down here a few of the ideas that
have been suggested in conferences
with yourself, Payson J. Treat,
Ben S. Allen, 0. F. Laumeister and
Dr. Frank Angell.
Briefly, the suggestion is this,
that each year we have upon the
Stanford track a meet that shall be
open freely to every public or pri
vate preparatory school of Califor
nia, or even of the Pacific Coast,
should any outside school desire to
send men to compete. The pur
pose of such a meet would be two
fold: First, the object would be
the advancement and improve
ment of amateur athletic sports
among the California preparatory
schools by giving the school ath
letes opportunity to meet in friend
ly contest, on neutral ground and
under the clean and favorable con
ditions that govern university
sports. And secondly, the meet
would afford a proper and health
ful means to make the preparatory
school athletes acquainted with
Stanford University.
The proposed meet would differ
materially from those held under
the auspices of the Academic
Athletic League. I am informed
that the membership of the Aca
demic Athletic League is limited,
as the association requires the pay
ment of certain annual fees which
bear heavily upon the smaller
schools, so that they allow their
membership to lapse and are there
fore barred from the competition.
In the interscholastic association
suggested there should be no need
for any regular fees beyond per
haps an entry charge of twenty
five or fifty cents for each individ
ual in a race, and not even this if
the gate receipts are sufficient to
cover all expenses. The meet would

also differ from those of the Aca
demic Athletic League in another
way, and this the most vital and
important: The meet would not
be—or, at least, should not be —a
matter of two hours of effort on the
track. The plan pursued at Wes
leyan University seems remarkably
good. There the schools are asked
to send their athletes on the day
before the meet and to permit them
to stay until the day after the meet,
giving them practically two or
three days on the campus. The
president of the VVesleyan associ
ation appoints a carefully selected
committee of entertainment, and
this committee sees to it that every
delegation is well taken care of in a
fraternity house, or a hall, or a
private residence as long as they
remain. For the period the visit
ors are completely the guests of the
university. The men of the uni
versity enter into the spirit of the
occasion, and the success of the
plan is great. What has been done
at Wesley an we can do here.
I enclose for your inspection a
copy of the constitution and by
laws of the Wesleyan University
Interscholastic Athletic Association,
which has been procured for me by
Mr. Treat. These are the fruit of
years of experience at Wesleyan,
and if not adopted by Stanford as
a whole, they at least give an ex
cellent basis for a similar organiza
tion.
As to the meet itself: The schools
might enter a team or a single man,
but every competitor should have
the guarantee of the head of his
school that he is a bona fide ama
teur. The particular incentives to
the schools to send men to the
meet would be of two kinds: First,
there might be a cup to be com
peted for by the teams; and, sec
ondly, medals for the point-win
ners. It is the custom at the East
ern meets to give medals of gold,
silver, and bronze to the first, sec
ond and third place men respec
tively; and these medals, costing
about $1£ a set, are much prized.
The expense of these at the pro
posed meet would certainly be met
by the gate receipts.
If the cup for the winning team
be of attractive design and good
value, and if it be a permanent
challenge trophy which must be
defended every year, I believe it
would have double value and in
terest, and the champions of one
year would be led to make a strong
fight to retain the trophy for the
next season. With these two in
centives, the cup for the best team
and the medals for the point-win
ners, I believe that a very strong
representation would be drawn to
the meet. A big school with a
strong team would surely send it to
secure a valuable cup, and a school
with a few good men, or even one
good man, would send those men,
or that man, to take the medals.
Perhaps after a while we might in
Borne way pecure a cup for the best
individual athlete, to he retained
permanently hy him if he wins it
two or three times.
It is the matter of a challenge
cup for the winning team that
leads me to take a personal interest
in the project, and to take the lib
erty of making these suggestions
that might seem to come mora ap
propriately from one more closely
associated with athletics. I have
in my hands lome $176 which was
paid to me as editor-in-chief of the
Daily Palo Alto. It was in my
mind a privilege to have been able
to serve the student body in a ca
pacity where I might in some meas
ure make a very small return of
my great debt to the University,
and the personal pleasure that I
derived from the work was ample
compensation for the effort. If,
therefore, the Executive Committee
looks kin diy upon the project of an
annual interscholastic meet upon
the Stanford track and will under
take to carry it out without delay,
I shall be very glad to return to
the.atudent body in the form of a
cup the Daily Palo Alto money.
The only condition I make ia that
the cup shall be a permanent
challenge trophy.
Very sincerely your»,
W. H. B. Fowler.
