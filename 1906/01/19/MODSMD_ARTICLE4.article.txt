# WEST IS DROWNED
## STAB ATHLETE MEETS DEATH ON THE EEL RIVER. Boat Capsized While Victim Was Inspecting Power Company's Dam. 
### 
According to a dispatch from
Ukiah, R. F. West, ex-'07, one of
Stanford's most brilliant athletes,
was drowned in Eel River yester
day afternoon. West was employed
by the Eel River Power Company
on its big dam near Potter. The
heavy rains of the past week had
Btrained the masonry of the dam
almost to the breaking point, and
streams of water 250 feet wide were
pouring over the top. West was
sent out alone in a small boat to
watch the dam and report any
leakage. In some way the boat
was capsized and West was thrown
into the stream. It is believed that
he was struck by one of the logs or
other pieces of debris which were
floating on the water, rendered un
conscious, carried ouer the dam,
and drowned. The body has not
yet been recovered.
West was one of the most bril
liant and consistent athletes who
ever wore the cardinal. He entered
Stanford in January, 1903, and
made a place on the intercollegiate

track team that season, competing
in the broad jump. He failed to
take a place, however. The next
semester he played a substitute end
on the 1907 Freehman team and
took Morrow's place in the second
half.
In the 1904 California meet West
won his Varsity emblem for the
first place in the broad jump. The
next semester West again came out
for end on the Varsity. At the be
ginning of the season he was hard
ly conceded a chance for the place,
but he played brilliant and consis
tent football through the season,
and was finally played at right
end on the famous 1904 Varsity
which defeated California 18-0.
West returned to college the follow
ing semester, but left before the
track season was well under way.
His home was in Seattle, Washing
ton, and he had but recently left
there to accept the position with
the power company.
