The movement which was quiet
ly launched at the meeting of the
Executive Committee last night
marks the beginning of a new era
in Stanford athletics. Probably no
more effective or legitimate means
of recruiting athletes from prepara
tory schools could be devised than
the proposed plan. In the East
several universities make a feature
of an annual interscholastic field
day held under their auspices with
the avowed purpose of attracting
students. At the University of
California the semiannual field
meet of the A. A. L. has served
practically the same purpose, but
Stanford has always been practi
cally isolated from preparatory
school athletic affairs. The Pacific
Coast offers a wide field for the ex
ploitation of the contemplated pro
ject, and the added incentive of the
valuable cup bo generously donat
ed by W. H. B Fowler ought to
make the proposed field-day a bril
liant success.
