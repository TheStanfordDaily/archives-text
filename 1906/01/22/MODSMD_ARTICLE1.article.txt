# NO DECISION REACHED
## ATHLETIC COMMITTEE MET TO DISCUSS FOOTBALL. Three Hours' Deliberation Brings Many Recommendations, But No Results. 
### 
The fate of football on the Pa
cific Coast has not yet been settled.
The faculty athletic committees of
Stanford and California and the
joint special committee, appointed
as an advisory board, met Satur
day in San Francisco, and after
three hours of deliberation reached
no definite decision in regard to
the future of the game. The only
official action taken by the com
mittees was the appointment of a
sub-committee, composed of the
following: Stanford — Dr. Angell
(chairman), J. F. Lanagan, Dr. A.
B. Spaulding; California —Colonel
Edwards, P. N. Gray, and Dr.
Frank Simpson.
The report of Stanford's Faculty
Athletic Committee, published in
the Daily Palo Alto",for January
12th, was read in so far as it re
lated to the reformation of football.
The four evils of the game dealt
with in the report were then sub
mitted to the new committee and
will be considered by them at
length, together with ways and
means for doing away with them.
This sub-committee will then sub
mit its report to the joint commit
tee, which will take final action ac
cordingly.
Beside the appointment of the
sub-committee, there were a num
ber of resolutions passed during
the session, all making more or
less radical recommendations, to
the sub-committee. The most im
portant of these was a proposition
that no freshman be allowed to
compete on the varsities next fall,
and that the freshmen play Rugby
at their annual game.
This resolution was heartily
backed by Presidents Jordan and
Wheeler, and will be considered
more as an experiment than a
permanent modification of existing
conditions. It is also hoped that
by keeping the freshmen out of
the varsity game during their first
year, it may do away with failures
which are annually laid at the door
of football.
Another recommendation was
that the athletic committees of the
two universities should obtain
from every other institution with
which it plays games, a satisfac
tory assurance that each member
of the team is a bona fide athlete.
These recommendations will be
carefully considered by the sub
committee, which will report on
them to the joint committee as
soon as it has reached some de
cision.
