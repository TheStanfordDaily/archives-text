# "QUAD" OFFERS PRIZES
## ART AND LITERARY WORK TO BE REWARDED. Work Is Progressing Well on Junior Annual and Editor Bickel Is Well Satisfied. 
### 
The '07 Quad board held a meet
ing yesterday morning and definite
plans for the work of this semester
were made. K. A. Bickel, editor of
the Quad, announces several prizes
which will be offered in the various
departments to encourage both
literary and artistic contributions
to the Junior annual. A prize of
$10 is offered for the best short
story of about two thousand words.
There is also a prize of $10 offered
for the best poem, particularly for
a poem characteristic of Stanford
life or scenes. Any stories or
poems which have appeared in cur
rent Stanford publications are
considered as entered in this com
petition. A prize of $10 is also
offered for the best drawing for the
Quad. This is especially designed
to encourage competition among
the college artists, and it is hoped
that a large number of drawings
will be submitted. Three prizes of
$5, $3, and $'2 are offered respect
ively for the three best joshes.
These joshes may be accompanied
by drawings, or may be merely
metre or prose without any art
work.
Bickel also requests that all
presidents or secretaries of student
organizations will kindly prepare
a list of their officers and mem
bers. A notice will be sent to all
such officers within a short time to
send in these lists, and Bickel hopes
to avoid unnecessary delay. In
regard to photographs of athletics
or any college interest —josh or
otherwise — Bickel urgently re
quests that anyone who has such
photographs would send them to
the Quad.
Work on the Quad is progressing
very well, and if possible it will
appear a little earlier this year
than usual. Consequently all con
tributions in the poem, story, and
josh competitions must be handed
in by March Ist. Such contribu
tions should be addressed to D. H.
Clift, '07. The art contributions
may be sent as late as May Ist,
and should be addressed to J. R.
Dillon, '07.
