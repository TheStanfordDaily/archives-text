To the Students: —You have
heard both sides of the case of boy
cott on ni}' stables because of my
alleged unfairness to the students.
As I said before, I claim I was not
in the least unjust to the students
in allowing the town officials in
their own way to protect the peace
of the citizens of Palo Alto while
in my hall.
Hut realizing that all the blame
has been laid on me—and I may
have made mistakes —I ask now
your co operation in helping me to
prove that I always was, and al
ways will be ready to do the right
thing by the students.
To the just and fair-minded stu
dents, as Stanford students are,
this proposition should appeal. 1
hope and ask that I may receive
your patronage, as I always have
My five-cent bus from the quad
to Palo Alto will from now on run
as before. Petek Mullen.
