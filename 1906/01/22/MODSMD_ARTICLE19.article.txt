Dean Hodges delivered his first
sermon in Memorial Church Sun
day morning on the subject, "Idea
of God." The minister said in the
course of his sermon: "It is enter
ing into the modern mind, as the
doctrine of Copernicus entered in
the sixteenth century, and the
doctrine of Darwin in the nine
teenth â€”pervasive, revolutionary, a
new light, changing our ways of
thinking. Thus these works are
not only the formula of a concep
tion of God, but a symbol of prog
ress in the domain of theology.
The world was dull enough for the
student of religion in the days
when the formula, 'It is written,'

was supposed to be a sufficient
answer to all questions.
"His business then was only to
commit old books to memory. To
day all that is changed. To-day
the student of theology goes to the
church and to the Bible as freely
as the student of geology goes to
the hills."
A sketch was given of the in
fluence of political enlightenment
and science in bringing about a
better and clearer idea of God.
