# HAS HAND BADLY MANGLED.
## V.T. Watkins Injured by Accidental Discharge of Weapon While Hunting. 
### 
V. T. Watkins, gr., while hunt
ing Friday afternoon, had his hand
and wrist badly mangled by the
accidental discharge of his shotgun.
It was found necessary to amputate
the injured member, and the oper
ation was performed Friday night
by the surgeons at the Guild Hos
pital.
Watkins, with A. J. Meents, '09,
went to the bay Friday to shoot
ducks, and while waiting for a shot
put his gun in the bottom of the
boat. While attempting to hastily
pull the weapon from under the
seats the trigger caught on some
projection, and the full charge
struck Watkins in the right hand
and wrist.
With his uninjured hand Wat
kins coolly seized the arteries above
the mangled member and pressed
them firmly to prevent bleeding to
death, while Meents rowed to the
shore. A short walk brought the
students to a house, a carriage was
secured, and they were rapidly
driven to the Guild Hospital, where
the lacerated hand was cut off.
Watkins came to Stanford last
semester from the Northwestern
University law school, and is tak
ing graduate law work here.
