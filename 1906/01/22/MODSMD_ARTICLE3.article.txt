# CARNOT TEAM CHOSEN AT TRY-OUT
## Sales, Cunha, and Herron Will Uphold Cardinal in Medal Contest.â€”Osgood Chosen as Alternate. 
### 
Two more men have been added
to the roll of Varsity debaters, and
the occasion which furnished them
with the opportunity for gaining
this distinction was the annual
try-out for the Carnot team, held in
the chapel Friday night.
W. F. Herron, '08, and E. A.
Cunha, '06, are the successful de
baters. These two with |D. D.
Sales, '06, the only veteran remain
ing in college from the victorious
team of last year, will represent
Stanford at Berkeley next month
in the annual contest with the
University of California speakers
for Carnot medal honors. C. S.
Osgood, '06, was chosen as alternate.
Professor 11. M. Alden of the
English department, Professor A.
H. Suzzallo of the Education de
partment, and Professor A.M. Cath
cartofjthe Law department were
judges of the try-out, and it was no
easy task which confronted them.
An unusually large number of
candidates, ten in number, entered
the competition, and they were
very evenly matched.
"Resolved, That the policy of
Minister Delcass6 as regards Mo
rocco was for the best interests of
France", was the question debated
by the aspirants for the Carnot
team. C. S. Osgood, '06, 1. D.

Gibson, '06, J. W. Maloy, '07, J. F.
Brennan, '07, D. D. Sales, '06, and
J. L. Maloy, '06, chose to uphold
the affirmative side of the question,
while the remaining speakers, W.
A. Campbell, '07. E. A. Cunha, '06,
W. F. Herron, '08, and W. L.
Blair, '06, defended the negative.
p]ach man was allowed thirteen
minutes to present his case, divid
ed into two speeches as he chose,
provided only that the first must
occupy at least four minutes, time.
Most of the speakers devoted about
ten minutes of their time to the
first talk, leaving but a few min
utes in which to summarize their
cases.
Sales impressed the judges by his
excellent stage presence and force
ful delivery and his characteristic,
precise method of handling the
subject. Cunha's logic was good,
and if number of arguments and
rapidity of speech count for any
thing, he was more thoroughly pre
pared on the subject than any of
the others. Herron presented his
arguments with conciseness and
erred only in extravagance of ex
pression. Of Osgood, to whom
falls the position of alternate, it
can be best said that his deliberate
presentation of ideas was his
strongest point.
