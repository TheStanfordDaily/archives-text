# SUCCESSFUL RETURN CONCERT.
## Combined Clubs Make Good Showing Before Large Audience. 
### 
On Friday evening the Combined
Musical Clubs gave a concert that
was conceded by all to be the best
that has ever been given here. In
every respect the affair was a suc
cess, as the attendance was good
and the financial returns were
more than had been expected. After
the holiday tour and the experi
ence and practice gained as a result,
both clubs were in a position to
make a most creditable showing.
Although the clubs were very
generous with their encores the pro
gram was none too long.
The decided hit of the evening
was the "stunt." The "correct
imitations" were of a new class en
tirely, and May, Kellogg, and Ber
nard were recalled time and again.
The cello solos by Lovell Lang-
Rtroth, '08, were warmly received.
The singing of Lachmund was of a
high order. The "bum quartette"
was another unusual feature, which
was encored several times.
The work of both clubs was ex
cellent, and showed good training
and faithful work. Especially good
were the Glee Club selections from
I)e Koven, and the Mandolin Club
"Robin Hood."
Assembly Hall was well filled,
and the return concert was a suc
cessful end of a successful season,
both musically and financially.
