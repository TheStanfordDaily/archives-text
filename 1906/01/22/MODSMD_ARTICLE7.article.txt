# SEASON OPENED TO-DAY
## BASEBALL CANDIDATES SIGN UP FOR VARSITY SQUAD. Coach Lanagan Discusses Plans for Coming Season at Meeting. Strict Training Rules. 
### 
The baseball season was ushered
in this afternoon with a meeting of
the candidates for this year's Var
sity. Coach Lanagan addressed
the meeting and outlined his policy
for the coming season. Lanagan
said in part: "An object lesson this
year will bo to get together nine
men who will play better baseball
than the California team. We are
going to proceed on a different bas
is than in football. There, at the
beginning of the season, we do not
consider that any team exists, and
the novice with no experience
stands as good a show of making
the Varsity as the veteran of last
year's team. To know baseball a
man must have played the game
from the time he was seven years
old, for it is impossible for a man
to learn the game in a season.
Therefore, the men who played on
last year's Varsity will be consid
ered as on this year's team, until
some other candidate demonstrates
that he is a better man, or until the
Varsity man shows that he is not
giving his best to the team. The
men who have had no experience
are at perfect liberty to come out
and try for their class teams, but
we do not want them on the Var
sity squad. Practice will be held
every afternoon at 4:30, and all the
Varsity candidates are expected to
be there, and be there on time. The
training rules will be exactly the
same as those governing the foot
ball squad. There must be no
smoking or drinking, and every
man must be in bed by eleven
o'clock. The men must keep train
ing rules and do what they are
told, or we don't want them on the
field. The things which we will
consider in picking the final team
will be, in order of importance,
batting, base-running, and fielding.
A sure hitter, whether he can field
or not, will be given preference
over the brilliant fielder who steps
away from the ball every time he
gets up to the bat."
The men who signed up for the
Varsity and the positions for which
they intend to try are as follows:

The first regular practice was
held this afternoon at 4:30.
The baseball season was ushered
in this afternoon with a meeting of
the candidates for this year's Var
sity. Coach Lanagan addressed
the meeting and outlined his policy
for the coming season. Lanagan
said in part: "An object lesson this
year will bo to get together nine
men who will play better baseball
than the California team. We are
going to proceed on a different bas
is than in football. There, at the
beginning of the season, we do not
consider that any team exists, and
the novice with no experience
stands as good a show of making
the Varsity as the veteran of last
year's team. To know baseball a
man must have played the game
from the time he was seven years
old, for it is impossible for a man
to learn the game in a season.
Therefore, the men who played on
last year's Varsity will be consid
ered as on this year's team, until
some other candidate demonstrates
that he is a better man, or until the
Varsity man shows that he is not
giving his best to the team. The
men who have had no experience
are at perfect liberty to come out
and try for their class teams, but
we do not want them on the Var
sity squad. Practice will be held
every afternoon at 4:30, and all the
Varsity candidates are expected to
be there, and be there on time. The
training rules will be exactly the
same as those governing the foot
ball squad. There must be no
smoking or drinking, and every
man must be in bed by eleven
o'clock. The men must keep train
ing rules and do what they are
told, or we don't want them on the
field. The things which we will
consider in picking the final team
will be, in order of importance,
batting, base-running, and fielding.
A sure hitter, whether he can field
or not, will be given preference
over the brilliant fielder who steps
away from the ball every time he
gets up to the bat."
