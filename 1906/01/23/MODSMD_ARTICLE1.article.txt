# WILL BUILD TRACK
## STUDENT BODY IN FAVOR OF PROJECT. Funds To Be Raised By Students Who Will Collect Fifty Cents From Every Student. 
### 
The special meeting of the stu
dent body in the chapel this af
ternoon was well attended. The
students seem to realize the abso
lute necessity of building a new
track this spring. A motion was
made and unanimously passed that
a number of collectors be appoint
ed to collect fifty cents from every
student. All the speakers empha
sized the necessity of building a
new track at once, and also the es
sential fact that money is needed
for this purpose. President E. A.
Cunha, '06, called the meeting to
order.
Trainer Moulton was called upon
first. He said, in part: "1 don't
know exactly what I came here for
to-day. Ido know that we want a
new track this spring. The pres
ent track won't do, —we can't even
get over there without ruining a
pair of shoes. If there are any
students here who have not yet
paid their assessment they should
do bo at once. We are going to
have a big meet here for the cup
offered by Fowler — which is a
grand idea —and we would be
ashamed to hold it on our present
track. That track is worn out, and
it can't be repaired. Some fine
men have been developed on this
track; but it is too old now, and the
University is growing and needs a
new track. I guess a collection
would be about as good a way as
any to raise the money. This is
the first time I have ever made a
speech for contributions, and I
don't know exactly what to say.
But we need a new track right
away, and the students should
make this possible by contributing
to the cause."
"Dad" Moulton's speech was
greeted with great applause, as he
seemed to have voiced the senti
ments of the students present.
The next speaker was Dr. Frank
Angell, chairman of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, who went
right to the point when he said:
"When I come before you students
I am always begging —begging for
money. The proposition this time
is that we want a new track. We
all want to keep 'Dad' Moulton
here, and it is hard to keep him
here under these conditions. An
able trainer cannot help getting
disappointed when he is forced to
work on such a track.
"In order to build the training
house, bleachers, and football field
we have gone in debt $2800, and
this was after years of saving by
the Training House Corporation.
Now we need money at once, and it
seems it should lie raised.
"I propose that in order to in
crease the amount of money in the
student body treasury we change
the student body assessment to $2
the ffirst semester and to $1 the
second semester. It seems to me
that this great University with its
