games for the Varsity baseball
team. There are seventeen games
on the list, including five with St.
Mary's, five with Santa Clara,
three with. St. Vincent's, three with
the Elks Ciub, and one with the
Alameda High School, which has
an unusually strong team this
year. Santa Clara and St. Mary's
both have teams that are as strong
as usual, and St. Vincent's bears
the reputation of turning out fast
nines. The Elks Club is composed
of the members of the old Indepen
dent team, which played here last
season. It numbers among its mem
bers Franks, Dunleavy, Moskiman,
Devereaux, and Boettiger, all of
