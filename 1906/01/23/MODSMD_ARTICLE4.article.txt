# TRAINER FAVORS PLAN
## "DAD" MOULTON HOPES TO SEE INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET. Predicts Success of Such an Event and Will Aid All Arrangements. Constitution Drawn Up. 
### 
The proposed field-meet between
all the preparatory schools of Cali
fornia has met with general ap
proval among the students, and es
pecially the track men. When in
terviewed in regard to the project
Trainer Moulton said: "This sug
gestion of Fowler's in regard to a
great field-nuet on the Stanford
track between the preparatory
schools of California—and possibly
the entire Pacific Coast —is certain
ly a fine idea. It is an event that
has long been needed in this state.
A very important point in favor of
the proposed meet is the fact that
schools with only one or two ath
letes—who do not belong to the
Academic Athletic League—can
come and compete on an even foot
ing with rivals from larger schools.
It also seems to me that in view
of this proposed idea we should cer
tainly have a new track this spring.
If we held such a field meet it
would be sure to be far more suc
cessful on a fine new track. lam
very enthusiastic over the project,
and hope to see it become a reality,
and there seems to me to be no rea
son why it should not.
"Such a proposition as this was
talked of when I first came here;
and J. C. McCaughern, 'Of., who
was then track captain, strongly
favored the plan,— but at that time
it was impractical. But at present
it seems to me that this is just the
time to successfully launch such a
project, and I will heartily cooper
ate in any plans or means to pro
mote the proposed meet."
The special committee composed
of J. C. Macfarland, '07, C. F. Lau
meister, '07, and H. L. Horton,'oB,
which was appointed to take some
definite steps toward the adoption
of the proposed plan, met yesterday
afternoon. This committee drew
up a constitution and by-laws for
the establishment of an association
to hold such a field-meet among
the preparatory school athletes.
The constitution is almost complete,
and, with the addition of a few
minor details, it will be presented
at the next meeting of the Execu
tive Committee.
