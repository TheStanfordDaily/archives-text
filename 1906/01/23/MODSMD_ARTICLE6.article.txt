# ENGLISH CLUB PLANS
## LITERARY ORGANIZATION TO CELEBRATE FESTIVALS. Old English Customs Will Be Revived. â€”"Twelfth Night" the First Celebration. 
### 
At a recent meeting of the exec
utive committee of the English
Club it was decided to try a new
plan for the regular meetings of the
club, which are held every two
weeks. The plan as formulated at
present is to hold, as far as pos
sible throughout the semester, a
celebration of the old English an
nual holiday festivals. These
celebrations will be carefully out
lined each time, with the view to
keeping them as much like the old
festivals as possible in the matter
of amusements, fancy dress, and
the like. This plan was suggested
by Mr. E. K. Putnam, the faculty
member of the executive committee,
and for each celebration the presi
dent will appoint committees from
the club at large to work out the
evening's entertainment.
The first one of the festivals is
"Twelfth Night," which comes
ordinarily on January 6th, but ow
ing to the suspension of college
work during the Christmas vaca
tion, will be observed at the first
meeting of the club, which will be
held Wednesday evening, January
24th, at 8 o'clock, at the Delta
Upsilon house. Miss Alice Hayes,
'06, and Paul Edwards, '06, presi
dent of the club, have planned the
"Twelfth Night" celebration. In
"Merrie England" at the time of
the institution of these holiday fes
tivities, the first step in the plan
was the coronation of a king and
queen of "Misrule,"and throughout
the evening of "Twelfth Night" the
utmost jollity and unconvention
ality prevailed. Shakspere's play,
"Twelfth Night," or "What You
Will," which was written for the
royal celebration of the holiday, is
a good illustration of the absolute
freedom from restraint and care
which characterized the annual
national observance of the day in
England.
At the meetings of the club
which are not given over to the
celebration of old English holidays
the former policy of the club,
namely that of inviting outside
speakers of note to address the
meetings, will be observed. There
are several interesting and able
lecturers who will be asked to speak
before the club during the coming
semester.
The executive committee, at its
last meeting, levied an assessment
of twenty-five cents to he collected
from the members, for the purpose
of paying for the page in the Quad
which is devoted to the English
Club. These assessments may be
paid to the secretary-treasurer at
any time.
