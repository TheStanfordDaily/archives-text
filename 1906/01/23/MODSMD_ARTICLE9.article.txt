The editorial office of the Daily
Pai.o Alto has become the reposi
tory for various complaints and
communications, which for a num
ber of reasons cannot be given to
the public through the columns of
the paper. Some are of such a na
ture that their publication would
probably deprive the paper of its
editor, while others are of such
slight interest to the University
community that space cannot be
given them. The editor is now in
possession of a communication, the
publication of which might brine
ridicule upon both the paper and
the writer of the article. In it, the
unknown writer complains that
an unfavorable impression is cre
ated on our distinguished guests by
the songs which are sung at As
semblies. As an instance he cites
the "Son of a Gambolier," but
further criticism proves that he
labors under the misapprehension
that a gambolier gains his liveli
hood in places where shaded lights
hang above green-topped tables,
and the sound of poker chips is
heard. If the student who wrote
the communication will call at the
Daily Palo Alto office we will
give him additional reason for not
putting his effort into type.
This paper has also received a
delicate and unofficial intimation
from the President's office that
most of the complaints lodged with
the Daily Palo Alto might be
more profitably left with the head
of the University. However true
this may be, the Daily Palo Alto
will continue to welcome com
plaints which provide material for
editorial comment, and in the case
of those that cannot be printed for
one reason or another, the paper
will be pleased to bring them per
sonally to the attention of the
President.
