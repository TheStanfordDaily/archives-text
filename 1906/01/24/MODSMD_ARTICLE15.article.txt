# TO BUY NEW SCENERY
## ORGANIZED MOVEMENT TO INCREASE STAGE PROPERTIES. Available Scenery Will Be Collected and Sinking Fund Started to Buy More. 
### 
A movement has been set on foot
in University dramatic circles to
systematize the control of available
stage properties and to regulate
their use. Nothing absolutely de
finite as to the means by which this
end will be attained can be an
nounced at the present time.
The Sword and Sandals society
has organized the movement, and
they hope in the next few days,
perhaps, to secure possession in
trust or at least management of the
stage properties now in the hands
of scattered organizations. Perhaps
an endeavor will also be made to
start a sinking fund, from which,
as necessity requires, the stage in
Assembly Hall may he improved.
The Sophomore play committee has
already been asked to contribute to
such a fund from the proceeds of
their coming class play, and this
proposition will probably be put
before the claes for consideration.
Sword and Sandals at a meeting
last night chose P. C. Edwards,'o6,
to assume control of such stage
properties as are now in possession
of the society. This organization is
also considering the production of
a show sometime this semester,
and a committee with R. S. Kel
logg, '07, as chairman, will manage
the production.
J. M. Ward, '07, J. E. Stewart,
'07, F. H. Bernard, '07, and L. W.
Cutler, '06, were initiated as mem
bers of the society at last night's
meeting.
