# GRADUATES WILL MEET
## CLUB TO CONVENE AT HOME OF DR. JORDAN. Members and others Invited to Attend Business and Social Session. 
### 
The Graduate Students' Club
will hold its first meeting of the se
mester on January 26th at the
home of Dr. Jordan. The meeting
is to be of a social nature primar
ily, the business session being chief
ly intended for the election of offi
cers. Professor William James has
agreed to deliver a short informal
talk on topics of special interest to
graduate students.
For the information of those who
are ignorant of the purpose of the
club it may be explained that over
a year ago about thirty-five post
graduates formed the club to be
come better acquainted with each
other and with the other graduate
students, many of whom were
strangers at Stanford from differ
ent universities. The meeting is
to further the original purposes of
the club, and is set for so early a
date in the semester in order that
the graduate students at present in
the University who are not well ac
quainted may become familiar with
their surroundings.
As far aB possible all the gradu
ate students at Stanford will be
notified of the particulars of the
meeting. But since to do this com
pletely is a rather difficult matter,
all graduate students are requested
to come to Dr. Jordan's house a
week from Friday night and take
part in the meeting.
