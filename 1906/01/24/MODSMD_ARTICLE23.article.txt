# WILL MOVE IN FEBRUARY.
## Bookstore Expects to Occupy New Quarters Early Next Month. 
### 
The campus bookstore will be in
stalled in its new quarters opposite
the Electrical Engineering shop by
the middle of February at the lat
est. Work on the new building
will in all probability be completed
by the first of next month, but at
that busy collection time it will be
impossible to effect an immediate
transfer.
No definite arrangement has
yet been made to dispose of the
old building. This is the property
of the bookstore corporation, and
they will probably sell it.
In expectation of increased busi
ness in the new quarters, the man
agement have already augmented
their working force by the addition
of several new clerks.
