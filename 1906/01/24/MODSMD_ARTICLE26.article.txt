# Professor Huberich Left Last Night.
## 
### 
Professor C. H. Huberich, of the
Law department, received a tele
gram yesterday announcing the
death of his father. No cause of
the sudden death was given in the
telegram, and Professor Huberich
supposed he was in his usual good
health, as he had received a letter
to that effect the day before. Prof,
and Mrs. Huberich and their
small child left on the evening
train for Austin, Texas. As it is
uncertain how long he will be
absent, his classes will be taken
by other members of the Law fac
ulty.
