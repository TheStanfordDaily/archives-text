# Members of Clubs to Receive Share.

Manager Barrett states that as
the result of the final home con
cert in Assembly Hall last Satur
day evening, the Combined Musi
cal Clubs now have a surplus on
hand of about $160 which will be
divided equally among the mem
bers who deposited $20 each before
taking the southern trip.
It is probable that several con
certs will be given latÂ«r in the se
mester in nearby towns which will
further reimburse the men. Sever
al proposals have been received.
