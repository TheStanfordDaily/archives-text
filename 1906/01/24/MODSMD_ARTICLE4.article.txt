The January issue of the Stan
ford Alumnus will contain a resum6
of football the past season in the
Pacific Coast states. The article is
by Archie Rice, '95, and is entitled
"All-Pacific Team and Football
Review." The author has been a
close follower of the game for more
than ten years, and has been writ
ing expert articles on football for
many seasons. The Alumnus ar
ticle will appear in the official foot
ball guide which is edited by Wal
ter Camp.
Stanford has twice as many
representatives on the 1905 All-
Pacific team as any other single
college. The representation in
numbers follows: Stanford, four;
California, two; Oregon Agricul
tural College, two; Idaho, Oregon,
and the Sherman Indians each

one. It is interesting to note that
the Idaho representative is Roose
velt, ex-'O4, who played on the
Varsity in 1901 and 1904. Rice
selects ex-Captain Chalmers, '07,
Captain Stott, '07, Thompson, '05,
and Crawford, '09, as members of
the All-Pacific team, and Molfino,
'07, and Horton, '08, as representa
tives of the second team. Califor
nia has two representatives on the
second team and four on the third.
Stanford is not represented on the
third team.
Stanford is ranked as the best
team of the nineteen from which
Rice makes his deductions. The
order of the next five is given as
follows: California, Idaho, Mult
nomah Club, Oregon, and Oregon
Agricultural College.
