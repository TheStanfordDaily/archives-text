# MUST NOT COME OUT EARLY.
## Lanagan Does Not Want Baseball Squad on Diamond Before 4:30. 
### 
Coach Lanagan wishes it defi
nitely understood that candidates
for the Varsity baseball team are ex
pected to report on the diamond at
4:30 and no earlier. In the past it
has been the custom of the men to
come out early and tire themselves
out throwing around the diamond
before the coach arrived.
Practice for the past two nights
has consisted of batting and field
ing. The infielders have been di
vided into three squads and take
turns at batting and fielding, while
the outfielders have been catching
flies and batting the curves of the
candidates for pitcher. Last night
the first squad of infielders was
composed of Presley, first base,
Bell, second base, Fenton, third
base, and Rhyne, short-stop.
