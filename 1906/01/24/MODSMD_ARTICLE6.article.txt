# Track Work Has Begun.
## 
### 
Training on the track began in
earnest Monday and a large num
ber of men were out for work.
Rubbers have been in the train
ing shed in the morning and after
noon for the past two days and the
men are receiving careful attention.
Trainer Moulton is out on the track
every day from 10:30 to 12 and
3:30 to 6, and the work of all can
didates is being closely watched.
There will be a meeting of all the
track men within a few days, at
which time strict training rules will
go into effect. The first meet will
be held about February 3d. This
meet is usually an inter-depart
ment or an inter-class meet.
