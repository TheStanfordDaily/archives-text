# BAND TO GIVE CONCERTS.
## Three Promenade Concerts Will Be Rendered During the Semester. 
### 
The University Band held a reg
ular business meeting and prac
tice last evening. L. W. Cutler,
'06, and Guy Knupp,'o7, were unan
imously re-elected as leader and
manager respectively for the pres
ent semester.
The Band decided to continue the
promenade concerts which have
been given in past semesters, and
during the present semester three
such concerts will be given. Two
of the concerts will be held on the
quad; and the remaining one on
the lake. The bandstand which
has been recently purchased by the
Associated Students will be used
for the concerts on the quad, while
at the lake the Band will either
play on the boat-house float or take
a position on the opposite bank.
Practice for the coming concerts
will be begun at once, and meet
ings will be held twice a week, Mon
day and Thursday evenings at 7:15.
Henceforth each member will be
compelled to deposit the sum of
two dollars with the manager, from
which deductions are to be made in
case of tardiness and absence.
A change will be made in the
music played, and in the future
concert pieces will receive the at
tention of the Band.
The committee appointed to con
sider the giving of a play for the
benefit of the organization made its
report, but nothing definite will be
known in regard to the project un
til a conference is held with Sword
and Sandals.
