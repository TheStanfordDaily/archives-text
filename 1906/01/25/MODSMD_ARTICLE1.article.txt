# FOOTBALL INJURIES
## INTERESTING STATISTICS COLLECTED BY ARCHIE RICE. Article Dealing with Injuries Sustained at Football by Stanford Men, in January "Alumnus." 
### 
Archie Rice, '95, has made a
careful and thorough investigation
as to Stanford's injuries at football
and has put intp tabulated form
for the January Aluvmus the par
tial result of his investigations.
"The record," writes Rice, "not yet
finally reduced to exact form, shows
fifteen seasons of playing, about
nine hundred different participants,
forty men injured with fractures,
dislocations, sprains, strains, water
on the knee, and other casualties,
none killed nor permanently in
jured, and very few who lost time
from college recitations because of
their injuries.
"No attempt has yet been made to
secure the records of casualties in
other branches of sport at Stanford,
the injuries at baseball, bicycling,
boxing, gymnasium work, basket
ball, and aquatics."
With the assistance of several
undergraduates, Rice is making an
exhaustive chart of the injuries at
football as compared with other
athletic sports.
The short statement by Trainer
Moulton, which appears below, is
the introduction to an article which
has been submitted to the Alnmnus.
This article is a review of track
work at Stanford since Moulton's
arrival in 1901, and it shows that
the spirit has been excellent in this
branch of sport and also that the
men have done well in their studies.
"Dad" Moulton says: "On the
track in 1902 we had thirty-eight
men turn out and in 1905 there
were one hundred and eleven men
in training. But this season, owing
to changes in the Gymnasium
rules, the number of men will be
cut down and will thus lessen our
chances to build up new material
for future seasons. We have had
no serious accidents on the track,
no first-place men have flunked out,
and few track men have ever been
dropped. There have been many
men who worked hard and failed
to win the coveted "S", but many
of them have told me that they
would not have missed the benefits
and pleasures of their training for
anything.
"Training rules are a religion
with the track and football men at
Stanford, and I have received let
ters from the trainers and athletic
managers of two state universities
in the Middle West asking how we
manage to keep the men from
breaking training rules. I an
swered that Principle and Stanford
Spirit did the work. Everybody
in college helps the men during
training season to keep strict train
ing rules, and this fact accounts for
the excellent conditions of our
teams.
"In reviewing the track at Stan
ford, since my arrival in 1901, I
will take the met, in each event
who did the best work and not only
•discuss their athletic ability but

show that they were good students
in college and have done well since
graduation. Thus proving that a
man may go in for athletics and
the same time do good work in his
studies."
