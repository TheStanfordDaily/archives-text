The movement to secure suffici
ent funds to pay for the new track
has started with a swing which
promises to produce results. For
several good reasons it is absolutely
necessary that the money should
be subscribed wholly by the stu
dents. First of all it is essentially
our affair, and secondly it is high
time that we were vindicating our
right of self-government. The stu
dent body has always viewed with
a jealous eye any faculty interfer
ence in purely undergraduate ac
tivities, but has not hesitated to
accept substantial favors from fac
ulty men. It is planned to exert
more or less faculty control in the
management of the new athletic
field, and it is up to us to make
this control decidedly less. But
can we consistently oppose this as
sumption of power while serenely
continuing to impose heavy finan
cial burdens on certain men who
are not members of the Associated
Students? We are in honor to re
lieve these faculty members of the
obligations which they cannot af
ford to carry on for an indefinite
period, and until we do this wecan
not with good grace demand full
control of the new athletic field.
We are confronted by a problem
which cannot be adequately solved
unless every student in college con
siders that he is personally obli
gated to pay his share of this com
mon debt. And in this connection
it is well to keep in mind that at
the recent meeting of the Associated
Students we practically pledged
ourselves to increase the regular
student body assessment, and if we
pay the increase there is no reason
why the new field should not be
finished without shifting our bur
dens to shoulders which are under
no obligations to bear them.
