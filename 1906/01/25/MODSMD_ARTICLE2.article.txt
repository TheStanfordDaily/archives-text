# ENGLISH CLUB MEETS
## TWELFTH NIGHT CELEBRATED IN QUAINT FASHION. Literary Organization Observes Festival.-St. Valentine's Day to Be Commemorated. 
### 
The English Club held one of
the most successful meetings in its
history last evening at the Delta
Upsilon house. According to the
new plan for the meetings the old
English festival of "Twelfth Night"
was celebrated in typical holiday
fashion. Following the brief busi
ness session, Instructor L. E. Bas
sett of the English department
gave a brief talk on the origin of
the early custom of observing the
holiday, which comes regularly on
January 6th, the twelfth night
after the celebration of Christmas.
The holiday was distinctly religious
in its origin, but in its observance
was given over to rustic rites and
simple jollity. The choice of a
king and queen of Misrule, through
the finding of the magic beans in a
large cake, resulted in much of the
celebration. Miss Hayes, '06, and
L. \V. Cutler, '06, were the sov
ereigns of last night's festival,
while the lot of the knave, deter
mined by the finding of a clove,
fell to E. J. Hadley, '08.
Harry Johnson, '06, officiated as
herald, and the royal decrees were
executed by court mummers, in the
persona of F. H. Fowler, '05, W.
H. B. Fowler, '06, B. S. Allen,
'06, M. M. Stearns, '06, A. R.
Fletcher, '06, G. P. Jones, '06, and
H. P. Bittner, '07.
During the evening the men who
were without the house were forced
to sing for readmittance, which was
gained only after one of their num
ber had guessed the occupation
which the women were carrying on
behind closed doors. An attempt
to furnish the old English holiday
refreshments for such occasions
was successfully carried out. J. C.
Ray, '07, rendered violin solos dur
ing the regal rule.
The next festival which will be
celebrated by the club in like man
ner is that of Saint Valentine's
day, which was one of the favorites
with the English court and people.
