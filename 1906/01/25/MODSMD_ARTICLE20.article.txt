# MUST PAY THEIR ASSESSMENT.
## Delinquents Are to Be Notified that Money Is Still Due. 
### 
Those who failed to pay their
student body assessment at the be
ginning of the semester are to be
officially informed of this fact by
the student body manager. The
need of funds for the new track
and the failure of so many to pay
their one dollar has forced Man
ager Barrett to take this step. The
delinquents have been checked off
on the students' register with the
aid of the receipt-book stubs on
which the assessments were en
tered. They will be informed by
postal card that their money iB
needed, and that they are expected
to pay it to collectors who will be
on the quad Monday and Tuesday
mornings.
Considerable clerical work and
postage will be saved, however, if
those who have yet to pay will at
once hand the money to Treasurer
Barrett, M. A. Thomas, '04, or W.
H. B. Fowler,'o6, who carry receipt
books. Checks may be mailed to
Treasurer Barrett. Payments of
the regular assessment may be
made to the collectors of the special
assessment if that method is more
convenient to the student. While
the special assessment was placed
at fifty cents by the student body,
many students have given larger
amounts, and it is hoped that a
yet larger number will give an
added sum to make sure that there
will be enough to have the new
track built.
