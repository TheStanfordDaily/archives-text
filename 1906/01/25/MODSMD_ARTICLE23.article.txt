### 
The first issue of the Chaparral
will be placed on sale on the outer
quadrangle Monday morning.
The paper is larger than usual and
will sell for fifteen cents. Editor
ially Chappie scores the present
student spy system, and says some
sarcastic things about the proposed
division of Encina Hall. The lit
erary contributions are numerous
and the art features are up to the
usual standard.
