# Seminary Sections in Philosophy 1.
## 
### 
Dr. James has divided his class
in Philosophy 1 into seminary sec
tions of sixteen members each.
Mrs. Russell, his assistant, will
meet each section at different hours
and discuss the work as given by
Dr. James in his lectures. No ex
tra credit will be allowed, the idea
being merely to supplement the
lectures.
This is a new departure at Stan
ford, but is modeled after the "tu
toring system" now in use at many
of the Eastern universities.
