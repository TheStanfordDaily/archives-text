# BEGIN WORK ON WATER
## EIGHT MEN GIVEN LIGHT PRACTICE ON LAGUNITA. Candidates for Varsity and Freshman Crews Continue to Report. Sixty-eight Men at Work. 
### 
This afternoon marked the be
ginning of work on the water for
the boating men. A squad of eight
veteran oarsmen with F. W. Turn
er, '08, as coxswain, were given the
opportunity by Coach "Dan" Mur
phy to use the pair-oared barge
upon Lake Lagunita. The work
was purely elementary, and no at
tempt was made to have the men
pull any distinctive stroke, Coach
Murphy being engaged with the
larger squad upon the machines.
The squad which did the first
rowing of the season this afternoon
was composed of the following men:
B. Bryan, '07, N. P. Bryan, '07, G.
E. Dole, '07, F. Zimmerman, '07,
L. R. Gay, '08, R. H. Conant, '08,
E. N. Smith, '08, A. N. Cole, '08.
As the four-oared barge was not fit
for use, the oarsmen were confined
to rowing on the one pair-oared
boat. The larger boat will be put
in the water Tuesday.
The number of candidates for the
Varsity and Freshman crews has
been increased from fifty-five to
sixty-eight, thirteen men having
signed the roll since Tuesday eve
ning. Of the new men seven are
Freshmen, thus raising the total
number of first-year candidates to
thirty-five. There are thirty-three
men out for the Varsity four.
The men who have recently
turned out are W. A. Paxton, '06,
R. B. Moran, '06, E. Baker, '07, K.
