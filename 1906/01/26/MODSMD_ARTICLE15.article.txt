# CLUB WISHES REGATTA
## SAN DIEGO OARSMEN OFFER INDUCEMENTS TO CREWS. Southern Club Wants California and Stanford Varsities to Row on Glorietta Bay. 
### 
The San Diego Rowing Club, act
ing with the San Diego Board of
Trade, has been negotiating for
several weeks with Manager R. W.
Barrett, '04, in the hopes of having
the next intercollegiate regatta held
on Glorietta bay, a sheet of water
inside of San Diego bay.
The University of California has
also been approached on the sub
ject, and the San Diego club offers
liberal inducements to both uni
versities to induce them to agree to
the plan. The plan of the south
ern oarsmen is to have the fresh
man and varsity crews of Stanford
and California meet on Glorietta
bay about .June Ist, during a car
nival of athletic sports on water
and land which will last for a
week.
Manager Barrett is favorably
impressed with the plan, but a re
cent issue of the Daily Californian
states that the proposition of the
San Diego club was definitely re
jected at the last meeting of the
associated students.
The committees from Stanford and
California, which will meet to-mor
row night to discuss amendments
to the intercollegiate agreement,
will also consider a suitable place
for this year's regatta, and the of
fers of the San Diego Rowing Club
will be further discussed then.
The club suggests that in case
an intercollegiate regatta on Glori
etta bay is not feasible, southern
boating enthusiasts propose to have
the Stanford Varsity meet the crew
of the San Diego club. In case
the first plan falls through, Bar
rett states that it is probable that
the Stanford four will meet the
club team.
