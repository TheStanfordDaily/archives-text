# BASEBALL MEN MEET MONDAY.
## New Method of Practice for Interclass Teams to Be Considered. 
### 
Baseball players who are inter
ested in interclass baseball will
meet in the chapel Monday after
noon at 1:10. The captains of the
class teams for the coming season
will be elected, and the date for the
interclass contests will be fixed at
the meeting.
Coach J. F. Lanagan, '00, has an
important question to lay before
the players. At present the Var
sity squad is too large and un
wieldy, many of the men being
hopelessly outclassed, and simply
interfering with the coach in his
efforts to produce a winning team.
A number of these players are
out for their class teams alone, and
Lanagan intends to have the men
decide whether the interclass games
shall be held at once, thus getting
rid of a large portion of such
players, or whether the games
shall be held some time later in the
season and a new system of prac
tice for the class teams be intro
duced.
Under this new plan all players
who were out for their class team
would practice on the campus dia
mond every day before 4:30, giving
place at that time to the Varsity
squad. By this means a great
many men would be given a chance
to play for recreation and pleasure
and at the same time it would be a
much simpler task for the baseball
coach to handle the more experi
enced squad.
