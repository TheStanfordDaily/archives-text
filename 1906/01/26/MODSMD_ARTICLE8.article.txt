# NEW TRY-OUT SYSTEM
## CHANGE METHOD OF HOLDING DEBATING PRELIMINARIES. Henceforth All Try-outs Will Be Held on the Question Chosen for Varsity Debate. 
### 
Preliminary debating try-outs
will in the future he conducted on
a different basis from that formerly
in use. Heretofore it has been the
custom to subject the inexperi
enced candidates for varsity debat
ing teams to a try-out preliminary
to the main event, at which the in
tercollegiate or Carnot trio was
chosen. The squads in these pre
liminary debates have discussed no
particular question, and conse
quently such try-outs have always
been uninteresting and in a way un
satisfactory. Furthermore, the ob
jection has been long raised to the
old system that the new men were
put at a great disadvantage by
having to prepare on two separate
questions in competition for a place
on a varsity team.
This afternoon the University
Debating Club decided to meet
these objections by reorganizing
the whole system. Any try-out,
preliminary or final, will hereafter
be on the question which has been
chosen for the debate with the Uni
versity of California.
As soon as the question for the
intercollegiate debate is decided all
the Stanford candidates will begin
preparation on this subject. Two
try-outs will then be held as usual,
but with this difference: the pre
liminary in which the new men
will participate will be but a few
days before the final, and will be
on the intercollegiate question;
those chosen in this preliminary
contest will debate with the veter
ans a few nights later on the same
question.
