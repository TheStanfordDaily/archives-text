# TRAINING RULES ON TRACK.
## Trainer Moulton Emphasizes Importance of Keeping Regulations. Will Begin Thursday. 
### 
Strict training rules will go into
effect for track men on Thursday,
February Ist. This means that
all track candidates will have to
stop drinking and Bmoking, and
must retire before eleven o'clock.
The only dance that track men will
be allowed to attend is the Encina
"at home." Some exceptions may
be made to this rule during the
first few weeks of training by spe
cial permission from Trainer Moul
ton.
This morning "Dad'* said that
there would be no official signing
of training rules this Bemester. He
said that the old men knew what
training rules meant on the track
at Stanford, and that he wanted to
impress upon the Freshmen the
seriousness of observing these rules.
But it is especially important this
semester, as the Freshmen will have
their first intercollegiate meet, and
a great deal depends on condition.
The intercollegiate Freshman meet
will be held on March 24th at Ber
keley. A week before this date the
Freshmen may have a meet with
the athletes of the Bay Counties
League, but this has not been defi
nitely arranged. If the Bay Count
ies appear to be exceptionally
strong they may be pitted against
the Varsity candidates instead of
the Freshmen.
The first track meet of the season
will be held next Saturday morn
ing. It will be an inter-depart
ment meet, and probably some of
the distances will be shortened, as
many of the men are not yet in
condition for hard races. At pres
ent Captain Macfarland has the
names of over forty candidates for
track honors, but there is no doubt
that far more than that number
will begin training on the first.
Blanks will be posted in the train
ing shed for entries in next Satur
day's meet.
