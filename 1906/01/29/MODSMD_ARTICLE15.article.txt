# Report that Vallejo Wishes Regatta.
## 
### 
The San Francisco Sunday
Chronicle contains a statement from
Vallejo to the effect that the Valle
jo Yachting and Rowing Club is
attempting to get the Stanford and
California Varsity crews to hold
their annual regatta at Vallejo.
In contradiction to this state
ment, Manager R. W. Barrett, '04,
stated to-day that he has received
no communication of any kind
from the Vallejo club, and that he
is entirely ignorant of any such
plans in that direction.
Work in the boats for the Stan
ford oarsmen began in earnest Sat
urday. A large squad was sent
out on the lake at various times in
the two-oared barge with F. \V.
Turner, '08, as coxswain. The four
oared barge has been entirely over
hauled and varnished and will be
ready for use Wednesday.
