# CAMPUS DEBATES DISCUSSED.
## Planned to Hold Intercollegiate Forum Contests at Universities. 
### 
Stanford debaters are desirous of
making the intercollegiate debate a
campus event hereafter. This con
test has always been held in San
Francisco in past years, usually on
the night of the intercollegiate field
day; but it has always been felt,
and especially since the recent agi
tation for holding contests of all
kinds on the campuses of either
university, that this big debating
event of the year should be held
alternately at California and Stan
ford.
The University Debating Club
referred the matter Friday to the
Faculty Committee on Literary
Contests for their decision, but the
committee took no action,preferring
to wait and present the matter di
rect to the Intercollegiate Debating
Committee, which meets in San
Francisco next Saturday. It is
understood that the faculty are in
favor of the proposed change and
that they will endeavor to secure
the adoption of such an amend
ment.
Another proposition which the
Stanford representatives will also
urge for adoption will be the estab
lishment of a small admission fee
at intercollegiate debating contests.
H. M. Lewis, '04, F. Roehr, '04, and
D. D. Sales, '06, will represent
Stanford on the intercollegiate de
bating committee.
