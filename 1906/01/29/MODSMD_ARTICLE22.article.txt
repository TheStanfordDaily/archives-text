# California Loses Two Track Men.
## 
### 
Track practice at the University
of California commenced to-day.
Sperry, who made more points than
any other contestant in last year's
intercollegiate field-day, and Zach
arias, another good man, will not be
in attendance at California this
spring. Walker, who ran the mid
dle distances for Oakland High
School, has registered at California.
