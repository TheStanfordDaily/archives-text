# NO FINAL ACTION ON AMENDMENTS
## Intercollegiate Committees Table Proposals for Three Weeks, Awaiting Meeting of Football Delegates. 
### 
Only one definite move was made
by the Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee of Stanford and California
at their meeting in San Francisco
Saturday night. The amendment
introduced by the Stanford com
mittee to permit those receiving
money from either university for
other than manual labor to com
pete in intercollegiate contests, was
lost by a vote of four to two. The
remainder of the amendments to
be considered were tabled until the
next meeting, on Saturday, Febru
ary 17th. The reason for this post
ponement was the desire of the
committee to await some defin
ite action on the part of the in
tercollegiate football committee,
which might necessitate additional
changes in the Stanford-California
agreement.
The recommendation of the foot
ball committee that one year's res
idence at either university should
be required before any man should
be eligible for a Varsity team, was
thoroughly discussed. A strong
minority sentiment seemed to favor
the barring of freshmen from Var
sity athletics, but it is highly im
probable that it will be made a
part of the agreement at the next
meeting. In case this should not
pass, the Stanford amendment, en
larging the one year residence rule
to include one year's absence from
another university, will probably
be passed.
The matter of the intercollegiate
boat races this spring was left en

tirely in the hands of Managers
Barrett and Decoto. They will
meet and endeavor to settle the
time and place for holding the races
before the next meeting of the dele
gates, when they will submit their
request for approval. In case they
should be unable to settle the mat
ter, the committee as a whole will
take it up and act on it on the 17th
of February.
By a curious combination of cir
cumstances, Stanford had four del
egates at Saturday night's meeting,
instead of the regular three. It
was reported on the campus that J.
T. Nourse, '00, who was appointed
last semester, had left San Fran
cisco and could not be present at
the meeting. The undergraduate
athletic committee then held a hur
ried session late last week and elec
ted E. P. Stott, '07, to succeed
Nourse. The latter appeared at
Saturday's meeting, however, and
served in his regular place, Stott
not taking part in the discussion
nor voting. Nourse will leave in
the course of the next week, and
Stott will then succeed him on the
committee.
At Saturday's session, Everett
Brown of California was elected
chairman, and Manager Barrett
secretary, of the committee. The
active delegates at the meeting were:
Stanford—J. T. Nourse, '00, R.
W. Barrett, '04, I). D. Sales, '08.
California—Everett Brown, gr.,
O. A. Snedigar, '05, and Manager
Ezra Decoto.
