# LOSES FIRST GAME
## VARSITY DEFEATED BY ST. MARY'S, FOUR TO TWO. Opening Contest of Season on Stanford Diamond Is Fast and Interesting. 
### 
The Varsity emerged from Sat
urday's contest on the short end
of a four to two score. Errorless
fielding by St. Mary's and thirteen
strike-outs by McGregor were re
sponsible for Stanford's defeat in
the first game of the season. Lana
gan played two full teams during
the game, substituting the second
nine in the second half of the sev
enth inning. Sales, Theile, and
Whitmer were all given a chance in
the box, and between them they
held the Phoenix batters down to
five hits. Loose fielding and fail
ure to hit the ball lost the game
for the Cardinal.
Stanford's two runs were scored
in the third inning. Chalmers
singled and Dudley was hit by a
pitched ball, Sales advanced them
each a base by a pretty sacrifice,
and both scored on Daily's
grounder. St. Mary's got three in
the same inning on two hits, a base
on balls, and errors by Sales and
Daily. In the eighth, Haley's hit
and an error by Preciados gave
them their fourth run.
