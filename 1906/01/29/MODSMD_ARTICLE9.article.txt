Strict training rules for the
track men have been announced
by " Dad " Moulton, and under
ordinary circumstances it would
hardly be necessary to emphasize
this fact. But this year for the
first time an intercollegiate Fresh
man field day will be held, and
the Class of 1909 can only hope to
win by the closest adhesion to the
training regulations announced by
the veteran conditioner of athletes.
The old track men have a high re
gard for the rules and a wholesome
respect for the punishment which
inevitably follows their infraction;
but the Freshmen, so recently from
preparatory schools, where train
ing is largely a matter of personal
preference, may deem the regula
tions of little importance. To such
the warning is given that the
breaking of training rules is one of
the cardinal offenses against the
Stanford spirit. " Dad '' Moulton
is eminently fair with his men, but
he will not tolerate the slightest
breach of the rules, and any of
fender will be publicly dismissed
from the squad.
