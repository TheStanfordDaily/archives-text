# REFORM IS SATIRIZED
## FOOTBALL AGITATION CLEVERLY RIDICULED BY PAPER. Chicago " Record-Herald" Burlesques the Movement to Eliminate Brutality. 
### 
Under the title of "With the
Devotees of 'Soft' Sports," a recent
issue of the Chicago Record-Herald
contains the following humorous
satire on the agitation for football
reform:
FROM CAMBRIDGE.
Since the disgraceful days of
football our young men have given
themselves heartily to milder and
more wholesome forms of amuse
ments. A very pleasant evening
at "Button, button, who's got the
button?" was passed last night by
the members of the Hasting Pud
ding Club.
A number of the rougher ele
ment in our university have pe
titioned the faculty for permission
to hold a "crack the whip" tourna
ment in the stadium, but the plan
is frowned on by university circles
as a whole, being regarded as un
safe to life and limb.
A number of men may be called
before the faculty for maltreating
their fellow students. The offense
was committed at a private gather
ing where blind man's buff was
the feature of amusement. The
game by itself is moBt harmless,
but a former football player con
ceived the idea of smiting the
blind-folded person with a stuffed
stocking, which was also well with
in the rules until the most brutal
member of the party put a stick in
the stocking. This, added to the
punch-bowl, brought on an alarm
ing degree of brutality. The col
lege paper to-day contains a
scathing editorial on the unwhole
someness of the sport.
FROM CALIFORNIA.
The football field at Leland
Stanford will possibly be plowed
and sowed to clover. It is the
sentiment of the college community
that the sweet scent of the flowers
will serve as a most suitable sub
stitute for a field whence impreca
tions, fierce yells and brutal glee
have been wafted in the past.
Tennis is to be reformed to meet
the demands of an enlightened and
refined student body. The game
has retained some of the rough
features that were common to all
sports in the days of cruel football.
Smashing will be prohibited alto
gether, and it will be unlawful for
a player to drive a ball faster than
ten miles an hour. The hard, un
sightly clay courts, suggestive of
the strenuous game, will give way
to the restful greenness of the turf.
