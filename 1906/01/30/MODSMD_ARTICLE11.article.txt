The writer of the principal edi
torial in the recent issue of the
Alumnus displays lamentable ig
norance in regard to the conditions
which prevail in Encina Hall —ig-
norance almost as dense as that of
the Student Affairs Committee.
The men of Encina justly resent
the imputation that they are dan
gerous rioters who must he re
pressed with an iron hand, and it
is to he regretted that the alumni
organ has seen fit to disseminate
this false impression among the
graduates of the University. Still
it is not difficult to account for the
distorted view of Hall affairs which
the editor of the Alumnus has re
ceived, when even the authorities of
the University persist in exaggera
ting the trouble in the big dormi
tory. It is the uniform testimony
of every one who is in a position to
know that Encina is as quiet and
orderly as any place on the campus
where men students reside. Even
the so-called riot, which so effect
ively called the attention of the
public to the painful fact that the
inmates of the Hall were guarded
by a drunken thug, was tame in
comparison to the "rough-houses"
which in the past took place in the
Hall without exciting either public
comment or official displeasure.
The members of the Student Affairs
Committee as well as the editor of
the Alumnus can easily satisfy
themselves of the truth of the
above statements by consulting the
representative men of the Hall.
And it might be well to further in
form the committee that the truly
representative occupants of Encina
pay cash rental for their rooms.
