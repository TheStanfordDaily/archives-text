# JANUARY "ALUMNUS"
## FIRST ISSUE OF PAPER CONTAINS MANY INTERESTING ARTICLES. Graduates Discuss Encina Troubles Proposed Changes in Athletic Rules.â€”Alumni Notes. 
### 
The January issue of the Stan
ford Alumnus, which has just ap
peared, contains several articles
of vital interest to the graduates
and the student body at large. A
lengthy discussion of the recent
troubles in Encina Hall and the
proposed plan of division occupies
the first place, and concludes with
a sentimental plea for peace and
quiet in "dear old Encina."
The article which has been des
tined to arouse most genuine inter
est is that containing the an
nouncement of the "All-Pacific"
football team, with four Stanford
men assigned to positions on the
first team and two on the second.
Several paragraphs in the issue
are devoted to a discussion of the
proposed change in football rules,
and to a table of "Stanford Football
Injuries," planned to show the ab
sence of permanent injury to foot
ball players during the past fifteen
years.
The remaining pages of the issue
are filled with glowing reports of
the tour of the musical clubs, the
Stanford Club's dinner to Doctor
Jordan during his recent visit in
Denver, the list of graduates re
ceiving degrees this January, and a
memorial notice of the death of
Raymond F. West, ex-'O7.
There are two or three photo
graphic reprints of the church and
the entrance, with a full length
view of the front of the outer quad
rangle, in the Alumnus, which will
convey to early graduates a slight
idea of the growth of the University
buildings.
The most pleasing feature of the
issue, taken as a whole, is the sec
tion devoted to "Alumni Notes."
Through this section the graduates
are able to trace the careers of old
college friends, whose whereabouts
might remain unknown, and the
plea of the editor of the Alumnus
for more of these notes should meet
with a hearty response from club
secretaries and officers of local al
umni associations.
