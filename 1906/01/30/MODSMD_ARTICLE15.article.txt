# EXTENSIVE PLAN MADE
## COLLEGE SETTLEMENT PROJECT ASSUMES DEFINITE SHAPE. Organization of Classes, Which Will Be Addressed by Prominent Sociologists. 
### 
While the Stanford Settlement is
an institution of the future,certain
definite work is being done, and a
general plan of campaign is now
being worked out.
Rev. D. C. Gardner in an inter
view says that the establishment of
the college settlement will natural
ly follow a proper development of
university sentiment, and a careful
maturing of plans. For the present
semester the following work is out
lined: Miss 0. Briggs of San Fran
cisco will address the women of the
University on the "Neighborhood
Settlement." Next week it is pro
posed to ask Ernest Piexotto and
Mr. Metzeuthin, who have had ex
tended experience in New York, to
speak to the men on the"Club
Idea" in settlement work. At a
University assembly in the near
future Dean Hodges will address
the studentß on the Settlement idea
from the sociologist's point of view.
When this preliminary work of
education is done, Dr. Gardner
will then call together those stu
dents who are interested in social
problems, social centers and social
settlements, to form a "Stanford
Settlement Club." This club will
meet monthly to talk over settle
ment work and kindred subjects,
and to listen to addresses by settle
ment workers, sociologists and labor
leaders. If practicable,the club will
furnish an advisory board to per
fect plans for the Stanford Settle
ment, and to cooperate with a San
Francisco Alumni Settlement Club.
