# ANNIVERSARY SERMON.
## Dean Hodges Gives Interesting Address Sunday Morning. 
### 
Dean Hodges preached the anni
versary sermon in Memorial
Church Sunday morning. The
minister said in part.
"We are all here in search of
wisdom. That is the explanation
of our academic life. We are not
satisfied, I hope, with knowledge.
The difference between knowledge
and wisdom is like the difference
between fact and truth: Knowl
edge is what man knows; wisdom
is what man is. The initial step
in that direction is the fear of God.
The fear of God is related even to
all knowledge, but it is essential to
wisdom.
''Of this fear of God, this church
is the visible symbol in this place.
"The most profound impression

which the University makes upon
a thoughtful visitor is represented
by this church.
"The first function of the univer
sity church is to impart religious
instruction. The 6econd function
is to inspire and direct the desire
for social service. The third func
tion of the church is to provide an
opportunity for worship. The fear
of the Lord means the knowledge
of His will."
