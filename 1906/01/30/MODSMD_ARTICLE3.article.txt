# MAY PLAY RUGBY HERE
## NEW ZEALAND CHAMPION PLAYERS IN NEW YORK. Manager Barrett Will Try to Arrange for a Game to Be Played on the Campus. 
### 
The crack New Zealand Rugby
football team, composed of twenty
five men, arrived in New York Sat
urday on the American liner New
York, en route home by way of San
Francisco. It was the original in
tention to have a game of Rugby
in New York with one of the Ca
nadian college teams, but the plan
was abandoned because a suitable
place to play could not be found.
The team will start for San Fran
cisco about Thursday and it is
probable that a game will be ar
ranged for by Manager Barrett, to
be played on the campus.
The New Zealand team has won
thirty-two of a total of thirty-three
football games played with the
strongest teams of the United King
dom. All the big English colleges,
including Oxford and Cambridge,
were defeated with ease. The All-
France team was beaten 38-8. The
one defeat was at the hands of the
Wales Association team, when the
New Zealanders were beaten by the
score of 3-0.
Manager Barrett has not yet
communicated with Captain Dixon
of the New Zealanders, but will do
so when the players reach the
Coast.
