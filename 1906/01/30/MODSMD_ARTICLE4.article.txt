# Great Relay Race Planned.
## 
### 
"Dad" Moulton has arranged a
grand feature event to close the
field meet on Saturday morning. It
will be a mile relay between teams
of twelve men, each runner cover
ing 146§ yards. Captain J. C. Mac
farland and L. M. Edwards, '07,
will each lead a team. Trainer
Moulton thinks that 146⅔ yards
will not be too far for any of the
men to run, and the race is sure to
be exciting.
The teams picked are as follows:
Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07, W.
M. Rawles, '09, J. G. Marks, '06,
A. C. Freeman, '06, L. G. Russell,
'06, C. L. Severy, '08, L. W. Barbur,
'07, E. J. Nash, '07, C. D. Giebel,
'08, G. C. Ainsworth, '08, R. A.
Kocher, '08, and E. C. Cope, '08.
Edwards' team consists of the fol
lowing: L. M. Edwards, '07, C. F.
Elwell, '07, A. E. Roth, '09, J. P.
Dunn, '08, P. M. Davis, '08, H. L.
Horton, '08, W. T. McNeil, '07, H.
Fitch, '07, W. C. Shelton, '08, W.
C. Harmon, '08, T. Vandervoort,
'08, and C. A. Ball, '06.
For the substitutes the following
men are named: J. G. Ferguson,
'09, G. Knupp, '07, F. R. Lanagan,
'08, J. E. Campbell, '06, E. J.
Boyce, '08, C. S. Morris, '08, and F.
M. Smith, '09.
Trainer Moulton urgently re
quests that all the track men re
port for the meet on Saturday
morning, as he desires to get some
line on the new material. The dis
tances will be shortened, as it is so
early in the season. This meet
will be held at 10 o'clock Saturday
morning, and the admission will
be free.
