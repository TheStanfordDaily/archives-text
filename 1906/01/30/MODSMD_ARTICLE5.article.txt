# TO SEE RUGBY FIRST
## COMMITTEE WILL AWAIT COMING OF NEW ZEALANDERS. Want to See English Game Played Before Acting on Coast Situation. 
### 
The Coast universities will see
Rugby as it is played by experts,
before any action is taken toward
modifying the present game. The
sub-committee, in whose hands the
fate of the game was left by the
joint conference, will not meet un
til the New Zealanders have played
their exhibition games on the
Coast. In case the islanders fail
to appear the committee desires
time make a thorough study
and investigation of the Rugby
game.
The only possible contingency
under which the committee will
meet earlier, would be some defi
nite steps by the National Rules
Committee, now in session, to meet
the objections to the modern game
made by the Stanford-California
conference. These objections were
embodied in the report of the Stan
ford Faculty Athletic Committee,
which was printed in the issue of
the Daily Palo Alto for January
12th. Briefly they are as follows:
the abolition of closed formations;
the objection that the game is now
a business rather than a sport; the
majority of students are now shut
out of the game altogether and it
has ceased to be a true college
sport.
The postponement of the meeting
of the committee until after the ar
rival of the New Zealanders may
leave the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee with nothing to
do at their next meeting on Febru
ary 17th. They postponed action
last Saturday for three weeks
awaiting the meeting of the foot
ball delegates.
