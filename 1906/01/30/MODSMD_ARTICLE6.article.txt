Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As 1 read No. IV of Chappie's
Popular Lecture Courses, entitled
"Eng. 23: The Egotistic Milton
Course," an expression which our
chaplain uses occasionally came to
my mind: ''I protest."
I believe the article in question
purports to be humorous, but I
must confess that to me, for one, it
does not seem funny. The egotistic
pedant represented there, speaking
inane nothings, has absolutely no
likeness to Professor Anderson and
hence is not funny to those who
know him; and it is hardly the
proper thing for a college humorist
to draw such a picture, label it
with the name of one of our most
honored professors, and scatter it
broadcast where it may fall into
the hands of those who do not
know him.
The reputation of a university is
made by the scholars who come
there to teach, and it seems to me
that a certain measure of respect is
due them even at the pens of the
college humorists. Of course, nn
disrespect was intended, but might
we not l)e a little more thoughtful?
A Student.
