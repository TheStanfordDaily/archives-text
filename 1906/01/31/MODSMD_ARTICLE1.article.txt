# TO GIVE EXHIBITION
## RUGBY FOOTBALL TEAMS MAY PLAY HERE. Games Will Probably Be Arranged Between the Vancouver and New Zealand Players. 
### 
Manager Barrett yesterday re
ceived a telegram from the manager
of the Vancouver Rugby football
team stating that he will arrive
from the north to-morrow to ar
range for a game either with the
University of California or Stan
ford to be played on either campus
or in San Francisco. Managers
Barrett and Decoto, will probably
arrange forseveral exhibition games
to be played on'either campus be
tween the Vancouver and New
Zealand teams, the latter of which
is now en route to San Francisco.
Everything is necessarily indefinite,
since neither Decoto nor Barrett
have communicated with the man
ager of the New Zealand team.
The arrival of the manager of the
Vancouver team when the New
Zealanders are here will facilitate
the arrangement of a game or series
of games. The New Zealanders are
desirous of playing a game with
either Stanford or California. Such
a contest would of necessity be un
satisfactory from the spectators'
viewpoint because of the unevenness
of the teams. A game between the
Vancouver and New Zealand teams
will give a fair idea of the merits
of the game.
