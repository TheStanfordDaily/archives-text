# "THOU SHALT NOT"
## PRESIDENT'S OFFICE MAKES REQUESTS. Initiations, Elections, and Chalk on the Quad Receive Official Frown. 
### 
Three notices of direct concern to
the students of the University have
been issued by the President's
office.
Notice No. 1 follows: "Students
are again reminded that freak ini
tiations and exhibitions of that na
ture should not invade the quad
rangle during recitation hours.
David S. Jordan, President."
The reminder is called forth by
the recent actions of the neophytes
of Phi Delta Phi, who were com
pelled to appear on the quad in
grotesque costumes. The reason
assigned for the above publication
from the President's office is that
"freak initiations and exhibitions
of that nature" ill become the dig
nity of the quad and distract the
attention of students from their
University work.
Notice No. 2: "The holding of
class and other elections at the en
trance to the University near the
Inn is attended with disturbance to
the classes in adjoining rooms. It
is requested that these elections be
held in the future at the main arch
or at the entrance to the inner
quadrangle from the Memorial
Court, where they were formerly
held. David S. Jordan,
President."
Last Monday two elections were
held on the outer quadrangle near
the Inn. Complaint was received
at the President's office from the
faculty members whose quarters
are nearby that the disturbance
during election hours was so great
that it was impossible to conduct
satisfactory recitations.
Notice No. 3 is as follows: "Stu
dents are requested to refrain from
the indiscriminate chalking of not
ices on the pavements of the ar
cades. It was agreed that notices
would be confined to the entrance
to the inner quadrangle from the
Memorial Court, the entrance from
Roble at the chapel corner, the en
trance from the Inn, and the en
trance at the side of the Business
Office (better changed to the corner
of the Engineering Building facing
the rows), and it is requested that
the chalking of notices be confined
to these points.
David S. Jordan,
President."
