The date for the great Interscho
-1 astic Field-day has been fixed, and
the promoters of the affair have set
energetically to work to make it a
success. To a great extent the ul
timate success or failure of the pro
ject will depend on the way our
preparatory school guests are re
ceived and entertained while they
are on the campus. Consequently
it is well 10 bear in mind the date
of the meet, so as not to make any
engagements which might keep us
from devoting our entire attention
to our guests.
