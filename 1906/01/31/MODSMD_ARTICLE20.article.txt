# CARNOT TO BE HELD FRIDAY.
## Medal Contest Will Be Held at California This Year.—Stanford Team Prepared. 
### 
Camot medal honors for 1906
will be decided next Friday night
at the University of California.
The debate goes to the California
campus this year, and the Stanford
team will be under the handicap
of debating from a strange forum.
The Stanford team has not done
any active work since they were
chosen at the try-out two weeks
ago, but they feel confident that the
question will be practically the
same as the one discussed at that
time. Sales,. Cunha and Herron
have combined their individual
arguments in an effort to secure as
much team work as is possible
under the Carnot system. What
ever the question for discussion be,
none of the Stanford debaters will
have an advantage over the others
in point of argument. Further
more, the home debaters feel fairly
confident as to the question which
will be submitted. They can evolve
no other logical resolution from the
general field, "The Foreign Policy
of the Third Republic," than one
relating to some phase or other of
the Moroccan question.
The selection of the question,
however, will not' be made until
Friday afternoon, when the faculty
committees meet at Berkeley —
Professors C. M. Gay ley and Bacon
for California, and Professors C. A.
Duniway and 11. M. Alden for
Stanford.
