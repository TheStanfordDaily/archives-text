# TRAINER HAS OFFERS
## WILLAMETTE AND UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO WANT "DAD." Large Number of Men. Out on Track Lately.—Relay Race Every Other Afternoon. 
### 
Trainer Moulton already has two
offers to coach and train track ath
letes at other colleges after his sea
son here closes. Last night ''Dad"
received a telegram from Willam
ette University in Oregon offering
him a position as trainer at his
own terms, and urging him to ac
cept if possible. Earlier in the
season the University of Idaho also
made a bid for Moulton's services
to train their track men. The track
season at both these universities is
so late that it would not interfere
in any way with "Dad's" contract
h«re.
Last season Moulton trained the
Willamette track athletes, and he
was successful there, and the man
agement is particularly anxious to
sign him again. At present "Dad"
has not decided to accept either of
fer. In case he should decide to
sign with one of these universities
for a short time after our season is
over, he will have to obtain a re
lease from the Executive Commit
tee, — but this has always been grant
ed without any difficulty.
The number of men training on
the track has been increasing for
the past three days. Yesterday
afternoon there were more than
fifty men working on the track. A
mile relay between two teams
of twelve men each was run, and it
proved an exciting race. "Dad"
Moulton and Captain Macfarland
have decided that it is a good plan
to hold such a relay every other
afternoon. The same men need
not run each night, but Trainer
Moulton says he would like to try
all the men out at this distance—
146-f yards—and then pick two
evenly matched teams to run on
Saturday. As yet the teams are
not definitely chosen, and a relay
of this kind will be held about five
o'clock in the afternoon.
