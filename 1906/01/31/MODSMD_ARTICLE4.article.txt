# SANTA CLARA NEXT
## TEAM FROM CATHOLIC COLLEGE WILL MEET VARSITY. Stanford Hitters Improving and Tomorrow's Game Should Be Fast and Interesting. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon at 3:30 on
the Varsity diamond Stanford will
cross bats with Santa Clara in the
second game of the season. The
Varsity will go into the game with
the team which lined up first
against St. Mary's last Saturday.
It is probable, however, that two
men will go into every position and
that at least three pitchers will be
tried out. The batting and base
running of the whole squad has
improved greatly during the past
week and they should play better
ball than they did in the last game.
The Santa Clara team is as
strong this year as ever and has an
especially fast battery. Kilburn,
the pitcher, played for the college
last year until he was put out of
the game by being hit in the head
with a pitched ball thrown by
Sales. The Stanford schedule calls
for a series of five games with San
ta Clara, of which to-morrow's is
the first. The line-up follows:
Stanford Santa Clara
Sales p Kilburn
Stott c Collins
Presley 1 b Byrnes
Bell 2b.. Twohv
Fenton .3 b Russell
Sampson s s Schaefer
Wirt. .1 112 Frieve
Chalmers. c 112 Walters
Dudley r 112 Lappin
