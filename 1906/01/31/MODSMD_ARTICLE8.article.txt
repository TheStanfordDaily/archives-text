# DATES SET FOR TRACK MEETS.
## Interscholastic Meet Will Be Held March 24th.â€”Intercollegiate Freshman Meet March 31st. 
### 
The committee in charge of pre
liminary arrangements for the in
terscholastic track meet has set the
date for this contest on March 24th.
This is just one week before the
intercollegiate Freshman field-day,
and seems to be a very appropriate
time for the preparatory school
meet. All athletes will be in con
dition at that time and interest
will be particularly keen in track
athletics. With such conditions it
seems certain that the first inter
scholastic field meet on the Stan
ford campus should be a success,
both in regard to the number of
contestants as well as the atten
dance.
The date of the intercollegiate
Freshman track meet is March
31st, the last Saturday in the
month. The statement in the
Daily Palo Alto that this Fresh
man meet would be held on the
'24th of March was a mistake.
