# OFFERS REPARATION
## EDITOR OF " CHAPARRAL " EXPLAINS CRITICIZED ARTICLES. Publication Was Not Caused by Any Animus Against Persons Joshed. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The editor of the Chaparral has
been advised that certain articles
and editorials in the last issue of
the paper are of a character to give
offence to certain members of the
faculty and the student body. The
editor is forced to admit that this
is true. The Chaparral is a josh
paper and its aim is to josh —and
not to insult. Since the editor is
solely and ultimately responsible
for all the matter in tlie paper, he
feels it devolves upon him to offer
reparation. If he had thought for
an instant that these articles were
written with a malicious motive
and not in pure fun he would cer
tainly not have published them.
All that he can say is that he sin
cerely regrets it. As to the editor
ial on the proctors the editor wishes
to state that he has received infor
mation which places them in an
entirely different light. He has
discovered that these students ap
pointed as proctors by the Presi
dent are really taking the positions
for a nominal remuneration, their
chief purpose in view being to
maintain good order by their in
fluence as good fellows. It was a
most unfortunate affair and the
editor hereby endeavors to atone
for his wrong attitude.
