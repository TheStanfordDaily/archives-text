The Executive Committee made
a good move when it recommended
that our delegates to the Intercol
legiate Debating Committee he in
structed to propose to that body
that all debates shall hereafler be
held at the competing universities.
There is much to be said in favor
of the plan and few arguments
against it. The Carnot debate has
been a campus affair for several
years, and every one will concede
that the contests for the medal
have been successful both from the
standpoint of attendance and in
terest manifested. Why should
not the Intercollegiate debate be
equally successful if held on the
campus? The opponents of the
plan argue that it is difficult to se
cure competent judges for campus
debates. But such has not been
the case in the debates for the Car
not medal, for with remarkably
few exceptions these contests have
been excellently judged. It is fur
ther complained by the advocates
of the present system that the at
tendance will be materially de
creased if the Intercollegiate debate
is no longer held in San Francisco.
This may be true as to the general
attendance of the public, but it is
equally true that the number of
students attending the debate will
be greatly increased if it is trans
ferred to the campus. The com
mittee does not meet until Satur
day, and by sending a large dele
gation to the Carnot to-morrow
night Stanford can effectually re
fute the last argument of the op
ponents of the change.
