# RECOMMENDS ACTION
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE INSTRUCTS DEBATERS. Stanford Interscholastic Athletic Association Authorized to Assume Name. 
### 
At the meeting of the Executive
Committee last night the Stanford
representatives of the Intercollegi
ate Debating Committee were au
thorized to enter into a new agree
ment with California,and instructed
to secure the holding of future de
bates on the campuses of the two
universities. The other business
consisted in authorizing the Stan
ford University Interscholastic
Athletic Association to use the
name of Stanford University, and
the official sanctioning of a concert
by the Girls' Glee and Mandolin
Club at San Jose.
The motion which authorized
the debating committee to draw up
a new debating agreement is em
bodied in the following resolution,
that:
"Frank Roehr, Frank English
and H. M. Lewis, the committee on
Intercollegiate Debating, be author
ized to enter into a new agreement
to govern the annual intercollegiate
debates to be held between Stan
ford and California; and to provide
in that agreement that such de
bates shall be held on the respec
tive campuses of the two universi
ties.'' R. 11. Lachmund,
Sec. Executive Committee.
By these instructions the com
mittee is restricted to an agreement
which contains the clause favoring
campus debates. The old agree
ment, which has been in force for
three years, expired last Saturday.
The Stanford and California de
bating committees will meet in
San Francisco next Saturday night
to draw up the new agreement.
By authorizing the Stanford
University Interscholastic Athletic
Association to use the Stanford
name, the Executive Committee
gives up all jurisdiction in the mat
ter, and the meet will not be con
ducted as a student body affair.
The auditing committee was au
thorized to employ a bookkeeper to
assist in experting the various
books of the Associated Students.
