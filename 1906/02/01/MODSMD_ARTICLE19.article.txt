# New Oars for Boating Men.
## 
### 
The four-oared barge was put in
to the water this afternoon for the
first time. Coach "Dan" Mur
phy has had nearly the whole
squad in the pair-oared barge dur
ing the past week, but the work has
been much handicapped because
this one boat was alone available.
T. R. Keenan, who has the con
tract for the making of eight new
sweep oars for the Cardinal oars
men, wrote yesterday that the oars
would be shipped from San Fran
cisco to day. This will make twelve
sweeps in good condition for the
coming season.
