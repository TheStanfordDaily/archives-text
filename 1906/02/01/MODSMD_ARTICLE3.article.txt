# Varsity May Meet Nevada.
## 
### 
For the first time in the history
of the two universities, Stanford
and Nevada may meet on the
diamond. Manager Barrett has
opened negotiations with Hoffmann
of Nevada for a series either in
Reno or at Stanford this spring.
Nothing definite has as yet been
arranged, but if everything goes
well Reno will probably be the
meeting place of the two teams. If
Nevada can guarantee sufficient
funds and if the powers that be are
willing, the Stanford team will
make the trip, probably after the
intercollegiate series with Cali
fornia.
