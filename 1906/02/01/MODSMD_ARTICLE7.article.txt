# Games May Be Cancelled.
## 
### 
There is little probability that
the series of basket-hall games
which the Stanford team had hoped
to arrange with the University of
California will come off, as Miss
Florence Grace, '06, was informed
yesterday by the manager of the
Berkeley team that the faculty has
decreed that all game√ü be played
on the home field.
As it is not yet fully determined
whether the faculty here will al
low the Stanford team to play
away from the campus there is
little prospect of a schedule of
games being arranged. If permis

sion is granted the Stanford team
will probably play one game on the
California court sometime within
the next two weeks.
