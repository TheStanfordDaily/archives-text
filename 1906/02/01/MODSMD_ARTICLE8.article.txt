### 
D.C.Alexander,'o6, W. F. Ewing, '00,
G. D. Boalt, '04, D. R. Gardner,'o7,
E. H. Coleman,'o6, L. G. Russell,'o6,
The above men have accepted
appointments by President Jordan
as proctors of Encina Hall, and
they conjointly with VV. E. Craw
ford, '06, VV. A. Pax ton, '06, E. C.
Itittenhouse, '04, and M. A. Thom
as, '04, will serve as monitors for
the remainder of the semester. The
proctors are the personal representa
tives of the President of the Univer
sity. Ad titianal monitors will
probably be appointed at a later
date. As a remuneration for their
services these men will receive their
room rent, which amounts in the
majority of cases to six dollars per
month.
Great difficulty was encountered
in securing the proctors, as there
was an evident disinclination on
the part of the representative up
perclassmen of the Hall to serve.
The proctors will occupy the
same rooms in which they are at
present living. The plan is to di
vide the number equally through
out the Hall, and with that end in
view four men will be stationed on
each floor. Next year the monitors
will be assigned to rooms which
will be reserved for them.
The original list contained eleven
new names, but five of the appoint
ees resigned this afternoon.
