# OFFICERS FINALLY ELECTED.
## Freshman Class Fill Vacancies Made by the Recent Resignations. 
### 
This afternoon the Freshman
class met to consider the resigna
tions of the newly elected officers,
and to fill the resulting vacancies.
The resignations of Vice-President
Neytnan and Secretary Strickland
were accepted, while that of Presi
dent Naylor was voted down. 11.
G. Marshall was then elected vice
president and E. A. Rogers sec
retary.
On motion of G. B. Bush, treas
urer for last semester, a committee,
consisting of C. E. Sampson, J. M.
Politzer and H. S. Goold, was ap
pointed to audit the books of the
office. The former treasurer re
ports that up to date a very small
number of the class assessments
levied last semester have been paid.
In order to obtain a Sophomore hat
next semester it will probably be
necessary that this assessment be
paid. In view of this fact the mat
ter of payment should receive the
attention of the delinquents.
