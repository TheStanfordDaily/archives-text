# Basket-Ball Team to Play San Jose.
## 
### 
The Stanford basket-ball team
will meet the team from the San
Jose Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation to-morrow night at San
Jose. The Cardinal will be repre
sented by a strong five, probably
the same team that played at
Stockton last semester.
San Jose has greatly strength
ened her line-up by the addition of
several former college players, and
the game to-morrow should be fast
and interesting. During the last
week the squad which has turned
out for practice has been too small
for scrimmage work, and the men
have been given light training in
signals and basket-throwing.
