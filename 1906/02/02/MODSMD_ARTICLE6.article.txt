# EDITORS IN TROUBLE
## HEADS OF PUBLICATIONS BEFORE COMMITTEE. Allen's Case Undecided, but Oppen-heim Is Again in the University. 
### 
A conference lasting over an
hour and a half was held this
morning between 13. S. Allen, '06,
editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
and Professors It. L. Green, A. B.
Show, G. C. Price, and L. R. Len
ox of the Student Affairs Com
mittee in relation to an editorial
which appeared Tuesday evening,
referring to the selection of repre
sentative Encina men as proctors.
At the close of the conference the
members of the committee ex
pressed an opinion to the effect
that the editorial was vicious, un
fair, and inclined to obstruct the
work of the committee in their ef
forts to establish harmony in the
halls of the big dormitory.
The investigation proceeded
along three definite lines, upon
which Allen was questioned. The
committee inquired as to Allen's
opinion as to how far the editor of
the Daily Palo Alto was justified
in opposing any movement insti
tuted by any governing body of
the University. Allen replied that
he felt that he was justified in
criticising any action instituted
by any department or committee
connected with the University, pro
vided that such criticism was hon
est and done without malice.
The committee then inquired as
to Allen's understanding of the re
lations which existed between the
Daily Palo Alto and the student
body. Did Allen believe that the
editor of the Daily Palo Alto occu
pied the same position in relation
to his subscribers as did the editor
of any daily newspaper published
off the campus? Allen replied that
he did not believe that lie could
honestly stand in any other posi
tion. The third question related
to the present situation in Encina
Hall, and the discussion entered
into the subject very generally.
No plan of relief, however, was
evolved. The committee did not
take any definite action in Allen's
case, and the question of his re
sponsibility to the faculty for the
writing of the editorial is still in
abeyance.
M. Oppenheim, '05, editor of the
Chaparral, was released from his
suspension, which was the result of
editorials and other articles in the
recent issue of the josh paper, last
evening by the order of President
Jordan, as the statement of the ed
itor of the Chaparral in yester
day's Daily Palo Alto was con
sidered a sufficient retraction.
