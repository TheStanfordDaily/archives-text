The new plan for conducting in
terclass baseball is well under way,
and it promises to be a decided suc
cess. Perhaps its most praisewor
thy feature is the fact that under it
more men will he led to play the
game, for, with the hest players on
the Varsity squad, the novices are
given more opportunities to in
dulge in the national pastime. A
favorite argument advanced by the
opponents of intercollegiate sports
is that only a comparatively limit
ed number of students participate.
With a large number of men out
for the class teams and the big
Varsity squads on diamond, track,
and water this contention hardly
applies to Stanford athletics at the
present time.
