# BEN S. ALLEN IS SUSPENDED BY STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
## Refuses Terms Offered by Committee. Executive Committee Accepts Resignation of Former Editor. 
### 
Ben S. Allen, '06, editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, was formally
served with his notice of suspen
sion from the University to-day at
12:30 o'clock by Mr. It. L. Green,
chairman of the Faculty Commit
tee on Student Affairs. The notice
of suspension was written on the
afternoon of February 2d, but was
not served until to-day because of
the intercession of members of the
faculty, who wished the notice to
first pass through the hands of
President Jordan.
The notice states that Allen's
withdrawal from the University is
demanded because of his responsi
bility for an editorial which ap
peared last Tuesday evening, refer
ring to the policy of placing stu
dent proctors in the Hall. The
committee affirm that the effect of
the editorial was to increase opposi
tion and to obstruct the efforts of
the committee to prevent hazing
and tubbing in Encina Hall, and
that its effect had also been to
create unjust prejudices against
the men who had accepted the
positions.
The final announcement of Al
len's suspension came after a num
ber of conferences had been held
between Dr. Jordan and the editor
of the Daily Palo Alto. The final
conference was held this morning
at eleven o'clock, when Dr. Jordan
made Allen the proposition that he
would intercede in behalf of Allen
before the Committee on Student
Affairs on certain conditions. These
conditions were that, primarily,
there must be order in Encina
Hall, and that the men of Encina
must promise to no longer oppose
the institution of proctors in the
Hall.
Doctor Jordan then suggested
that Allen procure the signatures
of the men in the dormitory who
were unalterably opposed to the
abolition of "tubbing" and who
would promise to leave Encina
Hall at once. Allen was also to
secure the signtures of students liv
ing in Encina Hall who, though
opposed to the abolition of "tub
bine," would promise to desist and
retain their rooms. If the editor
of the Daily Palo Alto secured
these signatures and was readmit
ted to full University standing, he
would not be allowed to resume
charge of the Daily Palo Alto-
Allen refused to accept the prof,
fered terms, and the notice of sus
pension went into effect.

Friday evening after the Daily
Palo Alto had gone to press, the
Hist notification of the dismissal
of the editor of the Daily Palo
Alto was made. Mr. R. L. Green,
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee, called upon Allen at
the office of the Daily Palo Alto
and informed him that the com
mittee had decided to suspend him
and that he would mail him the
formal notice Saturday morning.
"I inquired whether there was
any appeal from the action of the
committee," states Allen, "and was
told that 1 could appeal to Presi
dent Jordan and the Advisory
Committee."
Dr. Abbott, Allen's major profes
sor, interceded in Allen's behalf
with R. L. Green, chairman of
the Student Affairs Committee, and :
secured his consent to withhold the
notification until it had been final-1
ly reviewed by President Jordan.
On Sunday Allen met with Dr.
Jordan and a long interview en
sued. In this interview Dr. Jordan
intimated that he strongly disap
proved of the policy of the Daily
Palo Alto during the past year,
and that the attitude of the Daily
Palo Alto had been such as to ob
struct the work of the governing
committees of this University. He
stated that beheld the editor of the
Daily Palo Alto responsible for
the attitude of the students who
were opposing the institution of
proctors in Encina Hall.
"Dr. Jordan declared," stated
Allen to-day, "that I represented a
small but malignant minority of
the students. The governing body
of the University is determined to
stamp out tubbing in Encina Hall
if they have to eject every man who
is now living there. At the same
time Dr. Jordan stated that he had

perfect confidence in Mr. R. L.
Green, chairman of the Committee
on Student Affairs, and that the
proctors, although perhap√ü not rep
resentative men, had been appointed
by the proper authorities and that
they would receive the full support
of the authorities."
This morning Dr. Abbott met
Dr. Jordan and presented Allen's
case for final review. The Presi
dent, however, had not yet received
official notice from the chairman
of the Student Affairs Committee
and until that notification had
been received he could take no ac
tion. Shortly afterwards Allen
went to Dr. Jordan to discover
whether any action had been taken
by the executive. Dr. Jordan
again stated that he had heard
nothing of an official nature from
Mr. R. Jj. Green. At this time Dr.
Jordan declared that he had not
the slightest personal animosity
against Allen, on the contrary Al
len had his highest regard, but
that be felt that Allen was ob
structing the work of the consti
tuted authorities of the University.
"I consider this to be a question
of greater importance than my
mere personality," declared Allen.
"It is a question of policy. How
is the student press of this Univer
sity to - be governed? It is because
of this that I ant taking my present
attitude." Dr. Jordan staled that
the question of the policy which
was to govern the student publica
tions would be settled immediately
after the close of the present trouble
with the Daily Palo Alto.
Allen then requested that his
case be settled at once. The Presi
dent made a proposition to Allen
regarding the men of Encina Hall,
which was the only condition
upon which the President offered to

exercise his authority. Allen ab
solutely refused to consider the
President's offer. At this juncture
Mr. It. L. Green, chairman of the
Student Affairs Committee, arrived
for a conference with Dr. Jordan,
and Allen left the room.
Allen waited in the arcade until
Mr. It. L. Green, chairman of the
Student Affairs Committee, ap
peared. In Mr. Green's hand was
the official notification of Allen's
dismissal. He offered to it Allen
unsigned, stating that he thought
that it was only fair to Allen
that he should know of the pro
posed announcement before it was
made public. Allen again reaf
firmed his intention of not accept
ing the conditions imposed.
"J consider the proposition a
gratuitous insult, Mr. Green,"
stated Allen. "You will do me a
personal favor if you sign the noti
fication and so close the incident."
Allen placed the Daily Palo
Alto in charge of H. P. Hittner,'07,
until the Executive Committee for
mally elected a temporary editor.
