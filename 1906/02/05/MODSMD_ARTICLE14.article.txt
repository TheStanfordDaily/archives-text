the meet was the showing made by
new men, and "Dad" Moulton was
well satisfied. There were a num
ber of fast men entered in the hun
dred-yard dash, and J. R. ilolman,
'09, showed that he is a speedy
man and should improve. E. C.
Cope, '03, ran well, but he is not
yet in condition and could not be
expected to do much.
E. J. Nash, '07, and J. G. Fer
gusson, '06> afforded the most ex
citing finish of the day when they
came down the stretch at the end
of the six-lap event. Fash won
the race, but Fergusson was a
strong contender, and both men
showed great gameness. C. D.
Giebel, '08, who finished third in
this event, does not yet seem to be
near his form of last season.
W. D. Peaslee, '09, showed up
well, winning both the high and
low hurdles. The distances were
cut down in both these uvents, but
Peaslee demonstrated that he has
both form and speed.
