# PROFESSOR SEARLES STATES PURPOSE.
## Removal of Piano Debt Assumed by Faculty Members is Attempted. 
### 
Professor C. Searles, who, on he
half of the faculty committee on
public entertainments, is arrang
ing the concert to be given by Stan
ford musicians next Friday eve
ning, has made the following state
ment in regard to the motives and
purposes for which the concert will
be held:
"The concert to be given next
Friday night, it may be well to re
peat, has been organized for the
purpose of removing the debt from
the piano in Assembly Hall. This
piano was bought three years ago
by the faculty committee on public
entertainments. At that time a
fund of several hundred dollars
had been collected for the purpose
of procuring a concert piano, and
the committee determined not to
wait longer. A Steinway grand
was purchased and the amount un
paid was secured by the notes of
members of the faculty. It was
hoped that something might he
realized on concerts that were to be
arranged. This proved to be a vain
hope; not enough has been made
the last year even to meet the in
terest. Evidently something must
be done to pay off the amount still

due, or the piano must be sold to
release the men who signed the
notes from their liabilities. This
concert is the something which, it
is to be hoped, will save us the
piano.
"The committee was hurried into
buying the instrument because it
found that the guarantees required
by artists, the hall and the lighting
thereof, along with the renting of a
piano from the city with all ex
penses of transportation, etc., made
it practically impossible to present
any musical entertainment of de
sirable quality to the community.
All these items made a grand total
which was prohibitive. If we lose
the piano now when it is partly
paid for we shall revert to that con
dition for an indefinite period. We
may not hope to have the privilege
of listening to any of the great art
ists who come to the Pacific Coast
every winter; we shall be cut off
from one of the greatest sources of
educational as well as pleasurable
recreation for a long time to come.
"But this concert is not intended
merely to save the piano but it will
give the University a very compre
hensive idea of the musical re
sources we have in our midst and
of which we seem sometimes too
unconscious. The program will be
varied, it will represent many dif

ierent types of music, and best of all
it will acquaint us with our own
musicians, whom it would be vastly
to our pleasure and profit to know
better. C. Searles."
