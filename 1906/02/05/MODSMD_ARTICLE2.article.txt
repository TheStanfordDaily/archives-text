# LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AFFAIRS
## 
### 
Stanford University, Cal.,
Mr. B. S. Allen, Feb. 2, 1906.
Stanford University.
Dear Sir â€”The Committee on Student Affairs requests you
to withdraw from the University on account of your responsibil
ity, as editor of the Daily Palo Alto, for the editorial of Tuesday,
Jan. 30, 1906, and especially on account of the references to the
proctors in that part of the editorial which follows:
The members of the Student Affairs Committee
can easily satisfy themselves of the truth of these statements by
consulting the representative men in the Hall. And it might be
well to further inform the committee that the truly represen
tative occupants of Encina pay cash rental for their rooms.
The natural effect of the editorial is increased opposition
and obstruction to the efforts of the Committee to prevent hazing
and "tubbing" in Encina Hall; and its natural effect has also
been to create unjust prejudice and personal antagonism against
men for assisting in the effort to preserve order and personal
rights in the Hall. Very truly yours,
R. L. Green,
Chairman, Committee on Student Affairs.
