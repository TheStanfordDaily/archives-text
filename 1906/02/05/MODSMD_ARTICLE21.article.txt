# FORMALLY RESIGNS
## ALLEN TENDERS LETTER TO EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. Ex-Editor Gives Reason for His Dismissal from the University. 
### 
The following letter of resigna
tion was received from B. S. Allen,
ex-'OO. Its publication has been
ordered by the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students:
Stanford University,
February 5, 1906.
The Executive Committee of
the Associated Students.
Gentlemen: —I hereby tender my
resignation as editor-in-chief of the
Daily Palo Alto. I am led to
take this step by a notice from the
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee requesting my with
drawal from the University. The
severance of my relations with the
University renders my further re
tention as editor of the student
body organ impossible. In justice
to myself and the paper, I crave
permission to explain briefly the
causes which led to my dismissal
from college: In Tuesday's issue
of the Daily Palo Alto an editor
ial appeared criticizing the Stu
dents Affairß Committee. 1 be
lieved then, and I continue to hold
the same opinion, that the editorial
in question expressed the feeling of
a large majority of the members of
the Associated Students. But ar
bitrarily assuming jurisdiction of a
matter which was neither a ques
tion of conduct nor discipline, the
Students Affairs Committee dis
missed me from the University on
account of the editorial. I con
sider that the action of the com
mittee was wholly unjustified and
without either reason or expediency.
In short I feel that I was tried and
convicted before I ever entered the
committee room where my case was
decided. After the meeting of the
Student Affairs Committee I was
informed by its chairman, R. L.
Green, that my motives in writing
the editorial could not be ques
tioned, but that after due deliber
ation the members of the inquisi
torial body had decided that I
must be punished for the effect
which it had. After an appeal to
President David Starr Jordan I
was told that I had a chance to re
turn to college by submitting to a
shameful condition, the very sug
gestion of which was a gratuitous
insult, wholly unworthy of the
men who offered it.
In conclusion permit me to sug
gest that as representatives of the
student body it is in your power to
aid in the movement for putting
an end to a condition of affairs
which is rapidly becoming intoler
able. To the members of the As
sociated Students I wish to express
my dee}) gratitude for the honor
which they conferred upon me and
my equal regret that I am no
longer in a position to serve their
interests. I am ready to give up
the paper, as freedom of dicussion is
no longer tolerated and my useful
ness is at an end. Further permit
me to take advantage of this com
munication to express to Mr. Green
and his estimable committee my
heariest thanks for my premature
diploma, which under the present
circumstances I consider a greater
honor than an A. 1?. degree.
Ben Allen, ex-'O6.
