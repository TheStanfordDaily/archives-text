## DEFENDS ACTION OF COMMITTEE IN SUSPENDING ALLEN. President Asserts that Step Was Taken to Preserve Good Order in Encina. 
### 
Referring to the matters in En
cina Hall, I may say:
The process of hazing known as
"tubbing" in Encina Hall has al
ways been forbidden by the Uni
versity. The University Commit
tee on Student Affairs has been
instructed to enforce this rule, in
the interest of good order and of
the good name of the University.
To this end, the force of student
proctors in Encina Hall was in
creased in December from four to
sixteen. These men, as hitherto
and as in dormitories generally,
are instructed to stand for good or
der and to assist in its mainte
nance.
As editor of the college daily,
Mr. Allen has attacked the policy
of the University in abolishing
hazing and in similar matters, not
alone by argument and statements
of facts, but by a display of parti
san feeling and factious opposi
tion, tending to interfere with the
work of the proctors. Because the
natural effect of a certain editorial
of Mr. Allen's, in the judgment of
the University Committee, was "in
creased opposition and obstruction
to the efforts of the Committee to
prevent hazing and 'tubbing' in
Encina Hall,'' and because "its
natural effect is to create unjust
prejudice and personal antagonism
against men for assisting in the
effort to preserve order and per
sonal rights in the Hall," Mr. Al
len has been suspended from the
University.
The question involved is the
right of the University to enforce
its own regulations through its rec
ognized authorities.
The University authorities be
lieve themselves pledged to regard
every student as having a right to
his own room and to his own per
son while in attendance at the Uni
versity, and they are sure that the
wisdom of this course will be recog
nized by those who are now fight
ing the means chosen to ensure this
condition. David S. Jordan,
President.
