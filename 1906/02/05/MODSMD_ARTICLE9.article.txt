# Basket-ball Team Is Defeated.
## 
### 
The Stanford Basket-ball Team
was defeated by the San Jose
Young Men's Christian Association
by a score of 18-14 last Saturday.
The game was loosely played and
characterized by much fouling.
Lack of systematic practice on the
part of the Cardinal five was plain
ly apparent from their poor team
work.
