## ADDRESSES UNIVERSITY MEN IN ENCINA CLUB-ROOM. Defines Position in Maintaining Proctors in Hall, and Toward Journalism. 
### 
President Jordan addressed a
meeting of University men last
night in the Encina club-room on
the subject of proctors in the Hall.
The audience was remarkable for
the number of those present who
did not live it), the dormitory. Dr.
Jordan talked for twenty-five min
utes, and spoke in part as follows:
"What I shall say will be simple.
I have been a college man for thir
ty-seven years, and throughout my
career as freshman, sophomore,
junior, senior, professor and presi
dent, have rarely been out of sym
pathy with ; the majority.
"I have been proud of the Stan
ford boys and particularly the
boys of Encina. The only thing
that we m'ky disagree on here this
evening is the matter of 'tubbing'
and hazing."
Here Dr. Jordan went into the
history of hazing in the Hall, stat
ing that while tubbing had a good
effect on many freshmen, its ten
dencies weire bad for the men who
did the tubbing.
Dr. Jordan stated that proctors
in the Hall were appointed for the
maintenance of good order, and
that there had been no cases in
which secret information has been
received at the President's office.
"Any man who calls the proctors
spies is a coward."
, "A man's room is his castle, ac
cording to old English law, and he
has a right to exclude anyone
therefrom whom he sees fit. The
proctors who have been appointed
are representative men. They
represent me and I represent the
institution. There is not one of
them who is keeping his position
just for his room rent, but they
are working to keep good order in
Encina. They are men of courage
or they would not accept the po
sitions. The welfare of the Hall
must sooner or later come into line
with the President's views."
Dr. Jordan then paid a tribute
to the personal character of B. S.
Allen, late editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, and said that as he
had stood in the way of the right
understanding of the actions of the
Student Affairs Committee, he had
to be dismissed.
"Now I wish to lay down a few
laws in a modest, unassuming
way," said President Jordan.
"Hazing must stop, —the right of
every student to his room and body
must be observed."
"This is a comparatively free in
stitution} You are given more
here than in any Eastern college,
and the governing body of the fac
ulty must be untrammeled. If
those men who are called represen
tative and who are in favor of
tubbing do not like the way the
Hall is run, let them live else
where. Men are prone not to ap
preciate the free education which
they receive here. You must be
lieve that others who are in a po

sition to know, do know better than
you what is good for these men.
If they wish to carry on a running
fight they must leave the Hall."
Dr. Jordan closed his speech
with a few short remarks in
which he expressed the hope that
conditions would improve and
present strained relations between
the men of the Hall and the au
thorities would close.
