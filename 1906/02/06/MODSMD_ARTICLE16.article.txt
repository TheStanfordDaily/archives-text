# BELMONT STUDENTS COMING.
## Professor McDougal Will Bring English Classes to Sophomore Play. 
### 
An evidence of the interest taken
in the coming production of Gold
smith's masterpiece, "She Stoops
to Conquer," is a communication
just received from Professor W. M.
McDougal, head of the English de
partment of Belmont School, in
which he requests a reservation of
a large block of seats for the mem
bers of the higher English classes.
Professor McDougal wishes his stu
dents to witness the play because
of its bearing on their work in
literature. The Belmont delega
tion will consist of at least fifty
persons.
The painting of new scenery and
the making of costumes is being
hastened. An expert artist from
the city has been engaged to pre
pare three scenes, one of an old inn,
another a typical English scene,
and a third an interior view char
acteristic of the time for which the
play was written. The costuming
in the show will also be unusually
artistic and effective. Entirely
original designs have been devised
for the costumes of the principals.
