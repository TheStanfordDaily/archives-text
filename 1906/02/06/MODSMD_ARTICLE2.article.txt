Francisco Saturday afternoon and
made several amendments to the
intercollegiate debating agreement
which will vitally affect the con
duct of future inter-university for
ensic contests.
The Stanford delegates were in
structed by the Faculty Committee
on Literary Contests to advocate
three changes in the agreement:
namely, that intercollegiate debates
shall in the future be campus
events, that a nominal admission
fee shall be charged at all such
contests, and that the questions for
the annual spring debates shall be
submitted alternately by the two
universities. All three of the prop
ositions were received favorably
by the California delegates and
were embodied in the agreement.
However, the California faculty
committee on debating must yet
approve of the changes, and though
no opposition is expected from this
quarter, the amendments will not
have official sanction until such
approval is secured.
Stanford won the toss for choice
of question or side in the coming
debate. Accordingly California will
submit the question for debate two
weeks from next Saturday, Feb
ruary 24th. Stanford will then be
given one week in which to choose
sides.
