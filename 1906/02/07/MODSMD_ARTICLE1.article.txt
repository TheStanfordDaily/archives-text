# GOLFERS TO ORGANIZE
## MEETING WILL BE HELD FR Follweas of the Game Will Select a Favorable course Next Week. 
### 
A meeting of campus residents
who are interested in the game of
golf will be held in room 24 for the
purpose of perfecting the organiza
tion of the proposed club. There
are over one hundred and fifty en
thusiasts of the game on the cam
pus among the faculty and student
body.
The committee appointed at the
former meeting of the golfers has
conferred with Mr. Lathrop, who
has been considering the matter of
grounds for the proposed course.
It is the intention of the com
mittee in charge to organize the
new club on a strict business basis.
While in operation the club will be
under considerable expense, and to
meet this and the expense neces
sary to lay out the links, an initi
ation fee and monthly dues will
probably be charged.
