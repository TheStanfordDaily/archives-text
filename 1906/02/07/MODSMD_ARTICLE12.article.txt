## New Zealand Chanpions and Team from Vancouver Will Play at Berkeley. 
### 
The New Zealand Rugby football
players will play an exhibition
match with a team from the Brit
ish Columbia Rugby Union at
Berkeley on next Saturday at 3
o'clock. It is possible that this
game, which originally was to be
played next Tuesday, will be the
only game in which the New Zea
land champions will engage before
they leave America for Aukland,
although Dr. Angell of the Faculty
Athletic Committee is trying to ar
range a game to be played at Stan
ford.
The New Zealanders are return
ing from a victorious tour of Eng
land and have eo far played only
one game in this country. Their
opponents were an all-New York
team picked by the Metropolitan
Association Football League, and
were defeated by the score of 46 to
13. The New Zealanders will ar
rive from New York Friday. The
British Columbia Union team is
expected in San Francisco to-mor
row from Vancouver.
