Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Owing to the fact that few pro
fessional concerts have been given
in Assembly Hall, and, further
more, that few people have attend
ed when they were given, it seems
that there are a great many around
the University who do not feel per
sonally acquainted with the grand
piano therein incarcerated. The
instrument is a Steinway grand,
class C, list price $1250, if the
writer's memory does not play him
false. The reasons for the removal
of the piano from the public eye
are as follows: Somewhere in the
distant past, when traditions were
being formed and the student body
was more interested in music, a
piano was bought for the Assembly
Hall. It was a Chickering concert
grand. Now among many valua
ble qualities the Chickering boasts
especially of its longevity and pow
ers of endurance. That piano was
installed in the hall and left there.
It soon became impossible to lock it
up, for good and sufficient reasons;
it lost its varnish, next the loud
pedal, then Bundry other parts and
members; its keys became subject
to a sort of chronic aphasia, and
soon it was piled up at one side un
der the balcony, a melancholy ruin,
a warning and an example. The
Committee on Public Entertain
ments heeded that warning and ex
ample. At much trouble and con
siderable expense they had a loft
arranged under the stage so that
the piano when not in use can be
lowered into a tight case, protect
ing it from the destroying elements
of temperature and rag time.
Some curiosity has been evinced
as to what will be done with the
piano if it is paid for. In brief, it
may be said the piano will be con
sidered a piece of University prop
erty and so managed as to serve
the University's best interests. It
will not be thrown open for a few
to play upon at their pleasure.
That would be to finish it by the
"knock-out route." But it will be
kept where it is when not in use.
It will be in ÜBe for any and every
bona fide concert whenever proper
assurances are given that it will be
properly treated. It may be said
in passing that it was placed at the
disposal of the musical clubs for
their concert last month, but they
decided not to use it. In short it
will be used whenever there is oc
casion for it to be used, and no
measures will be taken in regard to
it which are not in the interest of
its preservation and so in the in
terests of the University commun
ity in general. C. Seakles.
