# GUILD MAKES IMPROVEMENTS.
## Living Room for Nurses Will Be Built.â€”Many Town Patients Admitted. 
### 
At the regular monthly meeting
of the Student Guild board held
Monday night money was voted to
equip a suitable living room for
the nurses in attendance. Further
improvements in the operating
room being considered necessary,
an expenditure was also authorized
to provide needed shelving and a
new stretcher.
Forty patients have been treated
in the hospital during the past
month, and a dozen surgical oper
ations performed, mostly of a seri
ous nature. Town patronage has
increased considerably, and the
hospital authorities consider the
innovation of admitting town pa
tients a decided success.
