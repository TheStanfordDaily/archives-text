# GAME AT SANTA CLARA
## VARSITY WILL PLAY TO-MORROW AWAY FROM HOME. For the Second Time Stanford Will Line Up Against Santa Clara. 
### 
The Varsity will play its first
game off the campus to-morrow af
ternoon, when they meet Santa
Clara on the grounds of the Catho
lic college. This is the second time
the two teams have lined up against
each other this season. In the first
contest, last Thursday afternoon,
Santa Clara won by a score of live
to three. In that game the Varsity
outplayed their opponents, but lost
through a combination of bad luck
and poor work in the box.
The bus for the Varsity will leave
the Irin promptly at 12:15 to-mor

early as possible in the afternoon.
The probable line-up follows:
STANFORD. SANTA CLARA.
