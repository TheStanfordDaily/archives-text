# STUDENT VIEW OF COMMITTEE.
## Quadrangle Club's Statement Signed by Representative Men and Women, and Placed in Hands of President Jordan. 
### 
To the President of Leland Stan
ford Junior University:—The Quad
rangle Club of Stanford University,
at the request of many prominent
men and women of the student
body, has agreed to formulate, for
the information of the President of
the University, a statement of what
seems to be a fair and generally ac
cepted student view of the composi
tion and policy of the Committee
on Student Affairs.
With an entire elimination of
the personal element, and actuated
solely by a desire to do away with
the spirit of friction that exists be
teen the student body and one of
the administrative committees of
the University—the Committee on
Student Affairs —we submit to you
that as at present constituted that
committee must necessarily fail in
its efforts to control harmoniously
the conduct of the student body.
We believe this to be due to the
fact that a majority of the members
of that committee are entirely out
of touch and sympathy with the
undergraduate body, and that their
influence for good, in consequence
of this lack of intimate knowledge
and appreciation, has been and
must continue to be entirely lost.
With no intention of deciding as
to the justice or injustice of partic
ular administrative acts of that
committee, we believe that a large
majority of the students have so
far lost confidence in the judg
ment of that administrative body
that a practically complete change
in the committee's personnel is es
sential to a friendly co-operation of
the student body with the adminis
trative powers of the University.

This statement has been submit
ted to the Pi Beta Phi sorority, and
rejected by it. This statement was
also submitted to a number of the
members of Roble Club, and to the
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
Alpha Theta sororities, but no ac
tion has been taken upon it by
them.
This statement, formulated by
the Quadrangle Club and signed
by representatives of the various
sections of the student body, was
last night approved by the Execu
tive Committee, and presented to
Dr. Jordan as a means of setting
forth the generally accepted view
in regard to the relations of the
student body with the Student
Affairs Committee. The statement
aims to present an impartial idea
of the predominating sentiment
among the students, stating that it
is believed that the efforts of the
Student Affairs Committee to con
trol harmoniously the conduct of the
student body must necessarily fail
because a majority of the members
of the committee are out of touch
and sympathy with the undergrad
uate body.
At the meeting of the
Committee last night the members
approved of the resolutions in the
following unanimously adopted
motion:
"That the Executive Committee
go on record as favoring the state
ment of the Quadrangle Club, and
sign this statement; also that the
statement be presented to the Presi
dent this evening by a member of
the Executive Committee."
Student Body President E. A.
Cunha, '06, then appointed C. A.
Beardsley, '06, to take the state
ment to President Jordan. The
members of the Executive Commit
tee then added their signatures to
the resolutions.
The document, with signatures
attached, was presented to Dr. Jor
dan late last night. He stated that
the matter was one to be considered
by the Advisory Board, and that he
