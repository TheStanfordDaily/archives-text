The statement made by the Pres
ident of the University that the
suspended editor of the Daily Palo
Alto "represented a small but ma
lignant minority of the students"
does not seem to he borne out by
the communication which was sent
to the President last night, and to
which are attached the names of
many prominent men and women
students who represent a majority
of the student body of this Univer
sity. On the contrary it would
seem from the almost unanimous
approval of the statement by the
students that it is a small minor
ity which does not sanction the de
posed editor's ideas.
The action of the Quadrangle
Club has received the sanction of
more than two thirds of the men
and women in college — students
who represent the best element in
the University community. It has
been praised likewise by numerous
members of the faculty, and should
receive the serious consideration of
the President. Every fair-minded
man and woman acknowledges that
the only solution of the present
trouble is a general reorganization
of certain faculty committees. This
applies directly to the Student Af
fairs Committee.
