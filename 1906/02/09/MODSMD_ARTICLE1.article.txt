# VARSITY VS. ELK CLUB
## SECOND GAME AGAINST SEMIPROFESSIONAL NINE. Stanford Will Play Sixth Contest To-morrow Afternoon at 2:30. 
### 
Weather permitting, the Varsity
will line up against the Elk Club
of Oakland to-morrow afternoon at
2:30. The rumors that the game
was to he called off on account of
the Rugby contest at Berkeley are
not true, although some of the foot
ball men may not be in the Cardi
nal line-up on account of the Rug
by game.
This will be the second time that
Stanford has played the Elk team
this season. In the first game the
semi-professionals were easily de
feated, losing by a score of 8 to 2.
To-morrow, however, the Elks will
play with a stronger line-up.
