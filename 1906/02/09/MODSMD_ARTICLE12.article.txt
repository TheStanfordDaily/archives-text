The innovation in elections in
troduced by the Sophomore class
to-day ought to be perpetuated.
The hours as at present arranged
are inconvenient and the time al
lotted is much too brief. People
who areunable to vote at the fourth
hour are often unable to return to
the quad after lunch, and the re
sults are often deplorable. If the
polls are open all morning there
cannot be any excuse for a single
failure to cast a ballot.
