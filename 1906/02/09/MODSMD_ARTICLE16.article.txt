# "Quad" Wants Photographs.
## 
### 
On account of the unfavorable
weather conditions at the intercol
legiate track meet last year the
Quad photographer was unable to
get many good photographs. Con
sequently, Editor Bickel has found
it difficult to obtain any good pic
tures of this contest. Anyone who
has photographs of the meet is ur
gently requested to give them to
L. M. Edwards, '07, or A. B. Pack
ard, '07.
