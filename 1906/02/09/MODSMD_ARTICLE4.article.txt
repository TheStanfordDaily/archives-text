# CHAMPIONSHIP RUGBY
## NEW ZEALANDERS VERSUS CANADIANS. Evenly Matched Teams Will Straggle in Berkeley To-morrow. 
### 
On California Field at the Uni
versity of California to-morrow
afternoon the All-British Columbia
Rugby Football Team and the
world champions from New Zea
land will struggle for the right to
the title. Experts predict the
greatest battle in the history of the
game, as both aggregations are
splendidly matched.
The athletes from the south
Pacific have just returned from
England, where they were without
tquals, and while en route they
easily added the All-New York
team to their list of conquered. The
New Zealanders are unusually
heavy and have combined with
this weight extraordinary speed.
So far they have held undisputed
the championship title of the
world, but never yet have they had
as opponents such a fast team as
that from the north. .
The Vancouver aggregation has
held the championship of Canada
for five years, and is conceded by
followers of rugby to be one of the
fastest teams to be found anywhere.
Their conch, Dave Dishpan, is an
old star from Auckland, and as he
understands the methods of the
he lias turned out a
crowd all the more to be feared by
them.
Every one of the southerners is a
track man. Three of them run the
hundred-yard dash in ten seconds
flat, and the rest of their team
mates hold records of ten and one
half seconds. This aggregation is
so fast that they have to their cre
dit thirty-two games, having lost
only one game.
The game will be called at three
o'clock, and as the attendance is
expected to he very large, the ad
mission will be but fifty cents.
The Vampires and Hornets will
play an exhibition game of associa
tion football before the big contest
is becun.
