# CONTINUE WORK ON LAGUNITA
## Varsity and Freshman Crew Candidates Will Row at Redwood Soon. 
### 
Coach "Dan'' Murphy is prepar
ing the boating men for the more
serious training upon the water at
Redwood. They have been given
longer and longer stretches at the
sculls upon Lagunita, until several
crews are now able to pull a strong
and even stroke several times
around the lake, ending with a
short spurt at the finish. Lagunita
is now completely filled with
water.
Beveral of the veteran men have
swung quite readily into the new
stroke which Murphy is trying to
teach, and with the better facilities
at Redwood the coach expects to
rapidly round a large squad into
good form. It has been very diffi
cult to obtain a good line on the
Freshman candidates up to the

present time because of the elemen
tary form of work which has been
done. Murphy thinks, however,
that the Freshman crew which rep
resents Stanford in the coming in
tercollegiate regatta will average at
least ten pounds lighter than the
1908 four. The Freshman squad,
besides being light, is inexperi
enced, but a large portion of the
men are rapidly learning the rudi
ments of shell rowing, and Mur
phy thinks the final 1909 crew will
be fast.
