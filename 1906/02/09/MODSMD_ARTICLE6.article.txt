# SECOND TRACK MEET
## OVER FIFTY ENTRIES PROMISES EXCITING CONTESTS. First Race Will Start Promptly at 9 O'clock.â€”Two Mile Will Be Feature Event. 
### 
The second track meet of the year '
will be held promptly at 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning. It will he be
tween the athletes who live on the
campus and those who reside in |
Palo Alto and other towns. There
were over fifty entries posted to-day
at noon and there are undoubtedly
a large number of men who will
compete that have not yet signed
up.
There are many more campus
entries than non-campus entries,
but the members of the non-campus
team are all high-class men and
should make a hard fight. In the
two-mile E. J. Nash, '07, J. G. Fer
gusson, '09, and C. D. Geibel, '08,
will again meet, and this should
prove a great race. The list of en
tries in the 100-yard dash includes
all the fast men now in training,
and as the track is in better condi
tion now than it was last Saturday
there may be some fast time made
in the sprints. There will be a
mile relay between two teams led
by Captain Macfarland, '07, and
L. M. Edwards, '07. Most of the
track events will be run at the full
distance except the two mile
and mile. Both Trainer Moulton
and Captain Macfarland are very
anxious that every man who is in
training should enter this meet. It
is also probable that the rubbing
list will soon be announced and
the showing made in to-morrow's
meet will lie important on this ac
count.
The meet will begin promptly at
9 o'clock, this early hour being set
because a number of the track men
are going to Berkeley in the after
noon to witness the Rugby football
game.
