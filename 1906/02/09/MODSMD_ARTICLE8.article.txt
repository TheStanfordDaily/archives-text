# JORDAN INTERVIEWED
## QUADRANGLE CLUB'S STATEMENT DISCUSSED. Signers of Communication Will Not Be Required to Appear Before Advisory Board. 
### 
When interviewed this morning
in regard to the statement present
ed to him by the Quadrangle Club
and signed by representative men
and women of the University, Presi
dent Jordan said: "When I stated
that the signers of the communi
cation of the Quadrangle Club
would probably be called before
the Advisory Board to explain
their position, to state any per
sonal grievance which they might
entertain, 1 had not yet read the
statement. After reading it I find
that there are no specific facts or
grievances charged, and conse
quently there is no necessity for
the signers to make any explana
tions. They will not be asked to
appear before the Advisory Board."
The statement will probably be
brought up for consideration
before the Advisory Board at its
next meeting, on Tuesday eve
ning.
I)r. Jordan had no further state
ments to make in regard to the
matter, and it was evident from
his attitude that he regards the af
fair as one for the attention of the
Advisory Board, and not for his
personal consideration. Dr. Jor
dan left for San Jose this afternoon
and did not state when he would
return.
