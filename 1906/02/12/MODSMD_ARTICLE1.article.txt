# ELKS BEATEN AGAIN
## VARSITY WINS PITCHERS' BATTLE BY CLOSE SCORE. Weak Hitting of Cardinal Team Offset by Errors of Their Opponents. 
### 
The Varsity again defeated the
Elks on Saturday by a Bcore of
2 to 1. The game was a pitchers'
battle between Sales and Hopkins,
in which the latter had the best of
it, but lacked support. Stanford
was lamentably weak with the bat,
making but three hits and scoring
their two runs in the first inning
on errors. Three of the Elk team
failed to materialize and their
places were filled by members of
the Varsity squad.
Following is the detailed score:
