# CONCERT FAILS FINANCIALLY.
## Only Two Hundred Dollars Cleared Last Friday Night. 
### 
From a musical standpoint the
combined concert in Assembly
Hall was a great success, but finan
cially the results were very unsatis
factory. Less than $200 was cleared
of the $600 necessary to remove the
debt on the Assembly Hall piano.
The amount raised will, however,
cover the payment due this year,
and it is hoped that the total debt
can be raised by another concert.
The Memorial Church Choir and
the Girls' Glee Club did good work
and all the soloists were enthusias
tically received.
