# GOOD POLE-VAULTING
## KOCHER, '08, CLEARS ELEVEN FEET SATURDAY. Second Track Meet of Season Held Under Unfavorable Conditions. Mile Run in Fast Time. 
### 
The track men residing on the
campus last Saturday defeated
those who live in Palo Alto, San
Jose and other towns by a score of
50 to 37. Despite the handicap of
a heavy track and a cold wind,
several excellent performances were
made.
One of the best performances was
the pole-vault, won by R. A. Ko
cher, '08, with a vault of 11 feet
1 inch, which is high-class work
for this time of the season.
G. C. Halsey, '08, again captured
first place in the mile, running in
4:58, which was good time under
the conditions. The quarter was a
fast race and the first three men all
showed great speed. L. G. Russell,
'06, won the half mile from twenty
entries. The two mile run was
omitted.
Unfavorable weather conditions,
coupled with a small number of
entries and the absence of H. L.
Horton, '08, J. O. Miller, '08, and
E. C. Cope, '08, prevented the meet
from being a success. Trainer
Moulton said that he was well
pleased with certain events, but
that the small number of entries
and the meet in general disap
pointed him. He has decided that
as an experiment the next meet be
held on Friday afternoon, since so
many of the men have field work
on Saturday morning. The sum
mary follows:

Edwards, '07, second; Rawles, '09,
