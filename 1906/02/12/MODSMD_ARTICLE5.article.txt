# EXPERTS PLAY RUGBY
## NEW ZEALAND WINS FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA. English Game Is Fast and Spectacular.—Opinions of Stanford Spectators. 
### 
Rugby football played by its
greatest exponents was seen on
California Field Saturday afternoon
when New Zealand met British
Columbia for the championship of
the world. New Zealand won easily
by a score of 43 to 6, sweeping the
Canadians off their feet.
Comparisons were the order of
the day, and the general concensus
of opinion seemed to be that from
the spectacular point of view Rug
by was far superior to the Ameri
can game. The open plays and
the fast passing from player to
player across the field keep the ball
always in sight of the bleachers
and emphasize the work of the in
dividual far more than the grind
ing play of the American ma
chines.
The gama is fast and action oc
cupies every minute of the ninety
of play. There are no tedious
waits for men to pick themselves
up and get into their places while
the quarter is calling the signals.
The tackling is all above the waist
but it is harder and fiercer than
anything in the American game.
All of the New Zealanders are
sprinters, and the collisions between
two eleven-second men resulted in
some terrific falls. The game is
usually played on a grass field,
and the gravelly surface of the
California gridiron cut and scratch
ed the unprotected legs of the
players.
To-morrow afternoon at Recrea
tion Park in San Francisco the
same teams will meet in another
contest.
The game made a great impres
sion on the American football play
ers who witnessed it.
Captain Stott, '07, made the fol
lowing statement: "If the Ameri
can game can be slightly modified
so as to meet the approval of the
Faculty Athletic Committees, I
think it would better satisfy the
needs of American students than
Rugby. 1 think it would be diffi
cult for American players to adapt
themselves to the Rugby game. A
Rugby football club in the Univer
sity would be an excellent thing.
If the American game must he rad
ically changed I would rather see
Rugby adopted outright."
Coach J. F. Lanagan, '00, did
not see the game, and had nothing
to say regarding it in comparison
with our game.
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee,
said: "From a spectator's stand
point the game was exceedingly in
teresting and exciting. Expert and
unexpert were struck with the tech
nical skill of the players in hand
ling the ball. Their endurance
was no less remarkable. Cease
lessly th§y ran up and down the
field at top speed,and they never ap
peared winded. The play was open,
so that the umpire could see all
fouls. The tackling in general was

easy, except on the side-lines, when
it was very hard."
President Jordan said: "I should
like to see Ilngby played between
the two universities because indivi
dual bead work is a factor in win
ning or losing. The open play
makes 'dirty' playing impossible,
as everything is in full view of the
spectators and referee. We might
modify it in certain ways and
adopt it. At any rate I should like
to have the two freshman teams
play it next fall, if for nothing else
than to get the high school boys
interested in it."
