# WILL TAKE NO ACTION
## QUADRANGLE CLUBS'S STATEMENT NOT TO GO TO BOARD. President Jordan to Take Consideration of Matter into His Own Hands. 
### 
The statement formulated by the
Quadrangle Club, and signed by
representative men and women of
the University, regarding the per
sonnel of the Student Affairs Com
mittee, will not be brought before
the Advisory Board to-morrow
night. The matter rests in the
hands of President Jordan and as
yet there has been no official action
on his part.
When the President gave out
an interview published in Friday
night's Daily Palo Alto to the ef
fect that the signers of the state
ment would not be called before
the Advisory Board to explain
their position, he intended to say
that the statement itself would not
be called to the attention of the
board. As there were no specific
facts or grievances charged in the
statement, President Jordan decid
ed not to bring the matter before
the board, but to consider it him
self. The general impression cre
ated by Friday night's interview
was erroneous.
The Committee on Student Af
fairs, regarding the personnel of
which the statement was formulat
ed, is an administrative commit
tee. It is appointed by the Presi
dent and is directly responsible to
him. He in turn is solely respons
ible for it and its personnel, and
all complaints and statements re
garding it must be acted on by
him. When thePresident said, at the
time that the statement was hand
ed to him, that he would present it
to the Advisory Board, he had not
fully read or considered the state
ment. After a careful examination
of the matter, he decided to take
it into his own hands and not pre
sent it to the board.
