It is to be feared that we are
slowly drifting away from the cus
tom of holding student body as
semblies. We have had only one
this semester, and that of such a
nature that it was almost a politi
cal gathering. When these assem
blies were established some three
years ago and were held regularly
every two weeks they came to have
a strong hold on the students be
cause they served to break the
monotony of the week-after-week
study, and in the opportunity that
they gave the men to get together
on absolutely common ground they
were no small influence in develop
ing the best Stanford spirit, and in
this were fully equal in value to
the hour of class work necessarily
cut out. Nowadays, however, we
have assemblies so seldom that
when we find ourselves unexpected
ly haled to the Assembly Hall we
hardly know what to do when we
get there. We are told that it is
difficult to find speakers. Un
doubtedly this is true, but we are
of the opinion that this difficulty
would vanish with the exercise of
a little greater energy on the part
of the assembly committee. The
English Club has for years suc
ceeded in finding a speaker of fair
interest at least for every two weeks.
With its much wider field to choose
from, cannot the assembly commit
tee do as well ?
