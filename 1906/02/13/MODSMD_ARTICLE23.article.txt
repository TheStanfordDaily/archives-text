Another Book by Professor Smith
Professor James Perrin Smith,
who occupies the chair of mineral
ogy and paleontology, is the joint
author with Alpheus Hyatt, a
geologist of the government, of a
report entitled "The Triassic Ceph
alopod Genera of America," recent
ly published by the United States
Geological Survey of the Depart
ment of the Interior. The volume
contains 214 pages of reading mut
ter and over 170 plates, with very
numerous photographs illustrating
the species studied. Every genus
of cephalopod in the Triassic of
America and a representative
species under each genus are de
scribed. The studies have been
made from specimens collected by
Professor Smith during the last
twelve years, most of the material
being new, although all available
collections in the United States
have been utilized. The publica
tion is part of a fuller report which
will be made later, and which will
contain descriptions and illustra
tions of marine fauna.
