# INNOVATION IN "QUAD"
## ALL SENIORS MAY HAVE NAMES IN CLASS LIST. Editor Bickel Will Introduce a New System in Senior Lists. 
### 
An innovation in the publication
of the Senior Class Roll in the 1907
Quad has been announced by K. A.
Bickel, the editor. Hitherto only
those seniors whose names were
posted by the Registrar as candi
dates for graduation were allowed
to have their names published in
the Senior list in the Annual. Be
cause of this fact, the names of
many prominent Stanford students,
who failed to graduate with their
class anil left college, were never
published in the Quad, and there
fore the list is incomplete.
To obviate this difficulty and to
make the Senior list as complete as
possible it has been decided that
"Quad Senior Information Cards"
will be sent to every student in col
lege who is eligible to wear the
sombrero or the cap and gown, re
gardless of the date of their proba
ble graduation. In this manner
the 1906 Senior list will he a com
plete record of the class roll.
The Senior information cards
will be sent out within the next
week, and to facilitate the work of
the Quad staff they should be filled
out and returned on the day re
ceived. A number of the fraterni
ties and student organizations have
also failed, as yet, to hand in their
pictures and membership list. This
should be done immediately, as the
forms are being made up.
