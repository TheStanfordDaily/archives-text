# PLANNING FOR MEET
## INTERSCHOLASTIC ASSOCIATION ARRANGING FOR CONTEST. Only Three Places Will Be Given. Many Entries Expected From High Schools. 
### 
The Board of Governors of the
Stanford Interscholastic Associa
tion met Monday night to make
further arrangements for the first
interscholastic track meet on the
campus, which will be held on Sat
urday, March 24th, on the new
track.
The proposition of Frank Mor
ton, principal of the Lowell High
School, San Francisco, on behalf of
the school, that four places in each
event be counted, was discussed.
The proposal was that five points
be allowed for first place, three for
second place, two for third place,
and one for fourth place. As the
third man under this arrangement
would get two points instead of one
it was decided that the larger
schools, which would have many
men of comparatively inferior abil
ity, would have too great an advan
tage over the schools with few en
tries. For this reason the proposi
tion was voted down.
Owing to the fact that the Uni
versity of California will no longer
permit the use of its cinder path by
any scholastic associations except
the Amateur Athletic League, it is
probable that the field-days of the
Bay Counties and San Francisco
Leagues will be called off on ac
count of the lack of a place to hold
the meets. Thus it is expected that
an extra large number of entries
will be made. Manager Barrett is
negotiating for railroad rates to ac
commodate those coming to the
University for the great track
meet. The constitution of the In
terscholastic Association is now in
the hands of the printer, and will
be published in a few days.
