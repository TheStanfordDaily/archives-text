# ROBLE DID NOT ACT
## STATEMENT OF QUADRANGLE CLUB NOT PASSED UPON. Failure to Call a Special Meeting of the Club Resulted in No Action Being Taken. 
### 
The statement formulated by the
Quadrangle Club and presented to
Dr. Jordan with the acquiescence
of about two-thirds of the student
body was not presented to the girls
of Roble Hall to be acted upon.
It was handed to Miss Florence
Grace, '06, president of the Roble
Club. She and several of the lead
ing girls of the Hall took it under
consideration. They decided that
it was not a matter preeminently
for the Roble Club to pass upon,
as it is loosely organized, and is
principally social in nature, lhey
considered it a matter for individu
al signatures. Miss Grace, however,
conceded that could four represen
tative girls be prevailed upon to
present the statement that it would
be taken up in a Roble Club meet
ing. She based her action on the
fact that a club meeting cannot be
called save upon the application of
four girls. No girls were found
among the upper-class women who
were willing tc take the responsi
bility, and consequently the peti
tion received no cognizance.
