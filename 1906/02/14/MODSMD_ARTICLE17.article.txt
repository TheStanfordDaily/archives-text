# DATE OF FIRST PROMENADE CONCERT ANNOUNCED.
## The
						Organization Is Practicing Twice a Week.â€”Will Play Saturday if a Game Is Secured. 
### 
The date for the first of the three
promenade concerts which are to
be given by the Band during the
remainder of the semester has been
tentatively planned for March 7th.
As lias been previously announced
these concerts are to be given at the
lake. The Band will probably take
its position on the side opposite
from that on which the boat-house
is situated.
The organization is practicing
steadily twice a week in prepar
ation for the concerts, and its im
provement has been marked. The
Band will play at the baseball
game next Saturday. Some of the
new concert music which has been
received lately will probably be
played. There are now twenty-two
members in the organization, and
since the installation of the new
system of attendance, which pro
vides for a fine for tardiness and
absence, the attendance has been
proverbial. Several new players
have been added to the member
ship of the Band since last semes
ter.
