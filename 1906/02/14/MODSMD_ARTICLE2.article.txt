# BOATING MEN STILL DOING PRELIMINARY TRAINING.
## Part of Freshman Squad to Row in the Mornings.â€”Four-oared Barge Badly Strained. 
### 
Because of the size of the Fresh
man boating squad, Coach "Dan"
Murphy will have a portion of the
candidates row in the mornings for
the present. It is impossible for
all the men to get a chance in the
boats during one afternoon, and
Murphy hopes by this new method
to give the Freshmen a better
chance for work. At the same time
it will enable him to get a line on
the promising candidates.
No attempt has yet been made
to divide eihter the Varsity or first
year men into different squads.
Murphy's plan is to first teach the
men to pull a strong, clean stroke,
and also to row on either side of
the boat.
The shell will be put into Lagu
nita about the first of next week.
The constant use of the four-oared
barge has necessitated the putting
in of diagonal braces to stiffen the
sides, the pull of the outriggers
having badly strained the boat.
