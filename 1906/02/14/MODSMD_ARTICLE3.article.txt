# OPPENHEIM JUSTIFIED
## TRUTH ABOUT TROUBLES OF EDITOR OF " CHAPARRAL." Hellman of " Californian" Apologizes After Conflict and Conference with Stanford Humorist. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon M. Oppen
heim, '05, received a letter from
Sam Hellman, editor of the Daily
Californian, in which the writer
states that in view of the stories
sent to thecity papers by the Stan
ford correspondents he would rather
not apologize. In the letter Hell
man frankly admits that he had
promised reparation in the form of
an editorial as a result of a lengthy
conference with Oppenheim, but
that he prefers not to carry out his
intention because it would appear
in the eyes of the public that he
had been forced to apologize. Hell
man further insists that he was in
no way responsible for the story
that appeared in last Sunday's
Chronicle.
According to eye-witnes√ües who
accompanied Oppenheim, the lat
ter went to Berkeley on Friday af
ternoon and proceeded directly to
the office of the Daily Californian,
but not finding the editor in, he
made a systematic search of all of
Hellman's haunts, without success,
cess- At about eight in the evening
Hellman was finally located at the
Bachelorden Club and this became
the goal of the Stanford procession.
Oppenheim met Hellman standing
on the edge of the sidewalk and the
editor of the Chaparral requested
an apology of the editor of the
Daily Californian. Hellman re
fused, Oppenheim struck, Hellman
ran and Oppenheim pursued. Hell
man sought refuge in the club
house and friends came to the
rescue. A peace conference was
brought about in the course of
which Hellman became impressed
with the propriety of Oppenheim's
stand. Hellman then apologized
in person to Oppenheim and also
to C. F. Laumeister, '07, and C. M.
Hadlev, '06, who had journeyed to
Berkeley with Oppenheim. The
Californian editor further promised
a public apology in an editorial
which he is now loath to publish
on account of the fact that the
public might believe he had been
forced to write it.
