### 
At ft regular meeting of Sword
and Sandals last evening, the pro
duction of the comedy, "Two Gen
tlemen of Verona," which the or
ganization has decided to give for
the benefit of the Band, was dis
cussed and tentative plans consid
ered, but no definite arrangements
were made. A coach has not been
decided upon, and the impression
that the society had asked Professor
L. E. Bassett to assume charge of
the production was a mistaken one.
Professor Bassett's name was being
considered, but no offers had been
made, as the arrangements were too
indefinite at the time.
