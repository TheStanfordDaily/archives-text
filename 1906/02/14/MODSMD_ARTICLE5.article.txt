###

fornia universities have a team
strong enough to warrant a dual
meet with Stanford. Manager Bar

suade these universities to combine
and send a picked team to repre
sent Southern California against
Stanford. In this way a high-class
meet could be held, but up to date
the Southerners have rejected the
proposal.
Several of the track athletes of
the Olympic Club of San Francisco
have expressed a desire to obtain a
meet with the Varsity. Manager

pears that the Olympic Club can
gather a strong team, Manager Bar
rett may arrange a meet for the
Varsity.
