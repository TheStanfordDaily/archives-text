# MAY ACCEPT BELMONT OFFER.
## Musical Clubs Take No Final Action but Members Favor Concert on Washington's Birthday. 
### 
A meeting of the combined mu
sical clubs was called for last eve
ning to consider the proposition re
ceived a few days ago from Bel
mont School for a concert to be
held there on Washington's birth
day. Although the attendance was
so small that no official action was
taken, there seemH to be generally a
favorable attitude among the mem
bers of both clubs towards the pro
posal.
The Belmont authorities have
invited the musical clubs to come
to their campus on the afternoon
of the 2'2d and bring ladies from
the University with them. A
dance will follow the dinner, to
which Belmont School has also in
vited the members of the clubs.
The only obstacle, it seems, which
might prevent the acceptance of
this invitation would be the inabil
ity of some of the members to go
because of previous engagements.
A canvass of the clubs will be made
within the next few days, and if a
suitable number of men can go the
trip will probably be made.
