# SOPHOMORE COMEDY TO-MORROW
## Class of 1908 Will Present "She Stoops to Conquer" in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Sophomore talent will appear to
morrow night in Oliver Goldsmith's
comedy, "She Stoops to Conquer."
Promptly at 8:15 the curtain will
rise on the first act of this clever
play which the Class of 1908 has
chosen to produce.
No pains have been spared to
make the show successful. Mrs. J.
E. Walker has coached the cast.
She has a wide reputation as a di
rector of amateur athletics, by long
work at Harvard University and
the University of California. No
suitable costumes could be secured
to depict the dress of Goldsmith's
time correctly, and so the com
mittee went to the expense of hav
ing entirely original costumes
made. Further, two scenes were
especially painted for this produc
tion, that the setting might be true
to the time the book was written.
Added to these favoring circum
stances Mrs. Walker has succeeded
in drawing an unusually clever
cast from the members of the Soph
omore class, and the show promises
to add several stars to Stanford's
dramatics.
11. H. Baker, who appeared with
credit in several shows last year,
has perhaps the most interesting
male part, that of Tony Lumpkin,
tfte shiftless son of a good family.
Baker has shown much ability in
rehearsals, and takes off the brag
gadocio of hiB lines excellently. W.
M. Walker and E. J. Swift repre
sent Young Marlowe and Hastings
respectively, the gentlemen and
leading characters of the play.

Miss Ellkrbeck as Miss Hardcastle
Both have had considerable experi
ence in dramatics.
The best acting in the show, how
ever, will probably be done by the
women. Miss A. Ellerbeck, as
Miss Hardcastle, the heroine of the
escapade which forms the principal
incident of interest in the plot,
takes off the curtsy and affected
ness of the age remarkably well.
Miss V. A. Steele, in the part of
scolding Mrs. Hardcastle, also does
an interesting bit of character
work.

The plot is a very simple one but
abounds in many humorous situa
tions. Sir Charles Marlowe, desir
oub of arranging a match between
his son and the daughter of his old
friend Hardcastle, sends young
Marlowe in company with Hast
ings, his friend, to visit the Hard
castle country place. The mali
cious Tony Lumpkin intercepts the
gentlemen, and directs them to his
home under the allusion that it is
an inn. This mistaken idea is the
keynote to the plot. Many comp
lications follow, but in the end Mar
lowe becomes engaged to Miss
Hardcastle, and his friend Hast
ings forms an affection for her
friend, Miss Neville.
