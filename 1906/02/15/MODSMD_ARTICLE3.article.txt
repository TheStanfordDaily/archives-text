### 
Instructor Edward K. Putnam
of the department of English, has
resigned his position in the Uni
versity, the resignation to take ef
fect at the close of this semester,
when he will go East to become
trustee for the I'utnam Memorial
Fund for the benefit of the Daven
port, lowa, Academy of Sciences.
The Putnam family has been
identified with the Davenport Acad
emy of Sciences for many years.
Instructor Putnam's mother and
elder brother have endowed the
academy heavily. Upon the
recent death of William Cle
ment Putnam, a business man
in Davenport, and Instructor Put
nam's second brother, over $500,-
000 more was willed by him to the
academy. It is to take legal charge
of this endowment fund that Mr.
Putnam will leave here.
The Davenport Academy is one
of the leading institutions of its
kind in the country. It has many
large buildings, and in particular a
well-equipped museum. It was
founded in 1867, and since then
has published ten volumes of im
portant proceedings.
Instructor Putnam's work will
comprise not only a supervision of
the Academy but will also include
the disposition of the income of the
fund. This income will be used to
erect new buildings, and to advance
the institution in every possible
way.
Instructor Putnam came to
Stanford in 1901. He has de
grees from Illinois University and
from Harvard, and has done much
valuable research work in Europe.
Last year he was an assistant in
the publication of Dr. Ewald Flu
gel's Chaucer Dictionary. Mr.
Putnam has been successful as a
teacher and especially as University
adviser.
