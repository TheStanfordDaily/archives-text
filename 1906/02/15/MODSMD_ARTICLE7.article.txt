Another of our prominent fac
ulty members has resigned his
position to accept one of greater
trustand responsibility at a Middle
Western academy. While here he
has won the respect of the entire
student body as a teacher and as
an adviser. He has tactfully filled
one of the most difficult positions
ever occupied by a Stanford pro
fessor, that of University censor.
It is with great regret, therefore,
that the Daily Palo Alto to-night
announces the resignation of In
structor Edward Kirby Putnam.
