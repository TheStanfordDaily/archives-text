The original of the drawing en
titled ''The College Widow," which
appeared in this morning's issue of
the Chaparral, was placed as an ad
vertisement in the window of Pro
fessor VV. F. Durand's office in
the Engineering building yester
day. Between the hours of eight
and five one of those parasites
whom we charitably describe as
kleptomaniacs stole or "removed"
the picture. So flagrant a theft
renders editorial comment neces
sary. It was the original drawing,
the personal property of the artist,
which was merely loaned to the
Chaparral for advertising purposes.
It was one of the finest drawings
that has ever appeared in a Stan
ford publication, and its value as
such renders the theft the more rep
rehensible. That the person who
took the drawing regarded it as an
ordinary poster is scarcely possible,
for nearly everyone on the quad
knew that it was the original. If,
however, he was under this misap
prehension, he should return it im
mediately to the owner with a suit
able apology. Otherwise he is
nothing more gthan a common
sneak-thief, and should, if detected,
be dealt with accordingly. In
stances of petty theft have become
so common in the University of
late that it is high time for the
authorities to take sotne action to
protect personal property.
