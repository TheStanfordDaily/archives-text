# Michigan Will Continue Football
## 
### 
The University of Michigan has
voted to retain "Hurry-Up" Yost
as football coach, contrary to the
recommendations of the faculty
representatives to the "big nine"
conference recently held in Chicago
which declared against professional
coaches. In addition the conference
voted for a three years' eligibility
rule and the abolition of training
tables. These and the remaining
recommendations were accepted by
Michigan, but the proposal by the
University of Chicago that football
be suspended for two years was de
cisively defeated.
