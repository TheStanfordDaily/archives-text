# TENNIS MEN AT WORK
## TRY-OUTS FOR VARSITY TEAM START FEBRUARY 22D. New System of According Privileges Upon the Courts to Tennis Squad Brings Favorable Results. 
### 
The try-outs for the Varsity ten
nis teams will start on Washing
ton's Birthday, February 22d.
Barring the past three days of rain,
the weather has been very favor
able for the work of the tennis men
and the Encina courts have been
constantly filled with players.
The creation of a definite tennis
squad and the granting of exclusive
privileges upon the Encina courts
to these players has had the effect
desired by the Tennis Club. The
candidates for the teams have had
no difficulty in securing courts to
practice upon.
Although Stanford will doubtless
be severely crippled by the loss of
both of the singles representatives
who played against California last
year, the form shown by several of
the new players makes it evident
that the Cardinal will be well rep
resented in the coming tourna
ment.
With but twenty-two men in the
squad, the try-outs for both singles
and doubles teams should be fin
ished in three weeks after the start
of the competition. The three singles
contests will be immediately fol
lowed by the round-robin tourna
ment for the winners. There will
be but one tournament to select the
doubles team.
