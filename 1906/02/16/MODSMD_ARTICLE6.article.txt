# MAY POSTPONE ACTION
## ATHLETIC COMMITTEES MAY NOT MEET TO-MORROW. Will Await Initiative on Part of Football Rules Committee. 
### 
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of
the committee on the revision of
football rules, has sent notices to
all the other members of the com
mittee, asking their opinion as to
the best date for their next meeting.
It was the original intention of the
committee to hold their first session
after the New Zealanders had
played Rugby in San Francisco.
It was supposed at the time that
the Eastern rules committee would
have finished its labors by then
and that the Coast could profit by
their modification.
Unfortunately the Eastern com
mittee adopted numerous tentative
modifications and then adjourned
until the third of March, without
having accomplished any definite
results. Dr. Angell now desires to
ascertain whether the majority of
the committee members desire to
postpone their meeting until some*
thing definite has been done in the
East, or whether they prefer to
meet at once and proceed along in
dependent lines. He will then call
the meeting in accordance with the
wishes of a majority of the com
mittee.
Whether or not the Intercollegi
ate Agreement Committees from
Stanford and California will meet
to-morrow night had not been defi
nitely settled up to a late hour this
afternoon. When the committees
met on January 27th they agreed
to postpone action on the proposed
amendments until February 17th.
The reason for the postponement
was the desire of the committee to
await some definite action on the
part of the Intercollegiate Football
Rules Committee.
The rules committee, however,
has postponed its meeting, await
ing first the arrival of the New
Zealand Rugby players and later
some action by the Eastern rules
committee, which meets on the
third of March. Manager Barrett
tried to reach Manager Decoto this
afternoon and find out whether the
California representatives desired a
postponement, but he was unable
to locate the California manager.
Incase the committees meet to
morrow they will probably be un
able to accomplish anything defi
nite, as most of the proposed
amendments depend on the action
of the football committee. The one
year residence rule, the barring of
freshmen from varsity teams, and
the time and place for holding the
intercollegiate regatta will all be
discussed at the meeting which
mav be held to-morrow.
