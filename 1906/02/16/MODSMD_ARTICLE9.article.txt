### 
The Junior clans to-day voted to
donate $100 of the claps funds to
ward building the new track. This
money will be turned over to the
Training House Corporation by G.
Knupp, treasurer of the class. A
motion was also passed authorizing
E. Ilossiter, manager of the class
baseball team, to purchase nine
suits not to cost over $50, to be
come the personal property of the
men making the team.
There is now a balance of
$327.26 in the treasury, a sum
larger than any previous Junior
class has had at its disposal. When
the expenditures authorized to-day
have been made the class will still
have a large balance on hand,which,
coupled with the receipts from Jun
ior day and the class farce, will be
one of the largest balances ever
held by a Senior class.
