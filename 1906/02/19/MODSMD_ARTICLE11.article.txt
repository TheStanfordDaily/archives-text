The innovation introduced by
the editor of the 1907 Quad, where
by all Seniors may have their
names placed on the Senior Class
Roll in the Junior annual, regard
less of the fact that their names do
not appear on the Registrar's list
of candidates for graduation, is an
important step in the right direc
tion. It is of vast importance that
the Senior list be as complete as
possible as a matter of record, and
this is made possible only when
the members of the Senior class
who wear the sombrero or cap and
gown are given an opportunity of
inserting their names and records.
The most valuable data regarding
a man's career in college is pre
served in this list, and it is impor
tant that the information be cor
rect and complete. Many of the
strongest men who have been stu
dents at Stanford University have
left no accurate record of their
work because they did not receive
the University's official degree.
it would, however, seem a wise
thing if the editor of the Quad
should restrict the new privilege to
those Seniors who do not intend to
return to college to graduate in an
other year. If a man proposes to
return and graduate he will be
known finally as a member of the
class with which he graduates, and
his college record should be printed
with the records of the other mem
bers of that class.
