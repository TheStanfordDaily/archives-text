# COMEDY A SUCCESS
## SOPHOMORE ACTORS DO WELL IN "SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER." Long Waits Between Scenes Prove Tiresome.â€”Sir Roger de Coverly Dance the Feature. 
### 
The Sophomore class presented
Oliver Goldsmith's comedy, "She
Stoops to Conquer," in Assembly
Hall Friday evening before a
crowded house. The members of
the east acquitted themselves with
credit, and praise is also due the
management for the clever costum
ing and artistic scenic effects se
cured. Most of the members of the
cast carried their lines well, and it
is surprising that amateur talent
should have carried this long
drawn out old English play through
with as little hesitation and tedium
as was effected. The waits between
scenes proved exceedingly tiresome
however, and coupled with the fact
that the lines were not memorized
thoroughly by several members of
the cast,were particularly annoying.
Financially the comedy was a
decided success. Assembly Hall
was filled, and though exact fig
ures are not now obtainable, a hand
some profit will certainly accrue to
the Sophomore class treasury from
their dramatic enterprise.
Some exceedingly clever acting
was done, the feminine parts being
particularly well carried. Miss
Viola Steele was a decided success
as Mrs. Hardcastle and Miss A.
Ellerbeck and Miss L. G. Sturgis
did their parts well. R. H. Baker
as Tony Lumpkin carried the lead
ing male role, and his character
work was excellent. W. M. Walk
er and E. J. Swift did well as the
dashing young gentlemen, Marlow
and Hastings. As expected, the Sir
Rodger de Coverly dance, intro
duced by Mrs. Walker to lend an
old English effect to the setting,
was a unique feature and well re
ceived by the audience.
