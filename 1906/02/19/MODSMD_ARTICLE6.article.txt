# GOOD WORK ON TRACK
## AS RESULT OF MEET FIFTY MEN MAKE RUBBING TABLE. E.J. Nash, '07, and E.C. Cope, '08, Were Stars in Contest on Friday Afternoon. 
### 
The track meet held Friday af
ternoon to determine the men who
should be placed on the rubbing
list was the most successful meet of
the season. In spite of the slow
track and the cold weather there
were a large number of entries in
most of the events, and good time
was made in all the distances and
also in the 60-yard dash. As a re
sult of the meet fifty of the athletes
will have the privileges of the rub
bing table. Additions will be made
to this list whenever candidates
come up to the required standard,
either in competition or individual
trials.
The feature of the afternoon was
the sensational finish of E. J. Nash,
'07, in the seven lap event. J. G.
Fergusson, '09, led in this race up to
the last sixty yards, when Nash
showed a wonderful sprint and
won handily. E. C. Cope, '08, won
the sixty-yard dash from several
fast men, and promises to be a
strong representative in the sprints
this season. C. A. Ball, '06, won
the high hurdles, showing good
form in his first race this year.
The half-mile and the mile were
both run in fast time, and the men
were well bunched at the finish,
which shows that competition in
these events will be very keen for
the remainder of the season.
In the field events the results
were not quite so promising as on
the track, although some of the
men showed improvement over
their work in the two former
meets.
