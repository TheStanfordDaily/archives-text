J. C. Macfarland, Esq.,
President Interscholastic Ath

Dear Sir:—Some time ago I com
municated with \V. H. B. Fowler
in regard to a cup which I proposed
to give to the relay team first win
ning three times the relay race in
the annual meet of the Interscho
lastic Athletic Association of Stan
ford University. My plans were
only tentative at the time. Since
then I have definitely decided to
present such a cup, and I wish to
offer the same to you, as president
of the Interscholastic Athletic As
sociation.
Two conditions accompany the
offer: first, that the cup be won
three times by a relay team repre
senting the same school in order to
become the permanent property of
that school; and secondly, that I
may reserve the privilege of renew
ing this offer as soon as the cup is
permanently awarded.
Very sincerely yours,
H. P. Bittner.

Winters, Covelo, Stockton, Fresno,
Campbell, Centerville, Mountain

San Jose High School, and Santa

strong team.
All the correspondence received

Oakland High School requests fur

its intentions in regard to the meet,
but all the other schools have sig
nified their desire to become mem

from four to eight men each in the
event of their inability to send full
teams.
