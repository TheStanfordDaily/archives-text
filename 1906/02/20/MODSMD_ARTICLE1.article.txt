# FUNDS FOR NEW TRACK
## STUDENTS TURN IN MONEY TO MANAGER BARRETT. Total of $270 Secured from Special Assessment To Be Used in Construction of New Track. 
### 
The total of the special track as
sessment has been computed by
Manager Barrett, the figures show
ing that the sum of $276.50 has
been turned in by the special col
lectors. The subscription of the
Junior class has also been received,
making a total of $376.50. This
amount, added to the regular stu
dent body assessments given to the
track fund, gives a total of about
$500 to be used in meeting the im
mediate expenses of building the
new track. Of the special assess
ment, $57 was collected on the
quad before the appointment of the
student collectors. The amounts
turned over by the collectors to
Manager Barrett were in some in
stances very large, but usually
they were unable to collect from all
the students in their division.
The largest collections were made
in Encina Hail, where a large pro
portion of the students responded
to the call for funds to carry out
the plans for the new track. In
Roble Hall the collectors secured
$40, of which $12 consisted of de
linquent student body assessments.
Forty collectors were appointed on
January 23d, representing the fra
ternities and sororities, Roble Hall,
Encina Hall, and Palo Alto. Most
of these students reported on Feb
ruary 15th, but the last payment
was not made until to-day.
It is not likely that more than
$900 will be paid out this semester
for building the track. Should the
remaining $400 needed not be
forthcoming from any other source,
Manager Barrett may be forced to
draw on the surplus student body
funds temporarily to meet the ex
penditures. The contracts have
been let and the grading is now
under way.
Since sending out delinquent
notices to students who failed to
pay their student body assessments
Barrett has received about $200.
