# WILL MEET IN CHAPEL
## ENGLISH CLUB TO HOLD OPEN SESSION. Miss Marie Shedlock of London Will Address Students on Hans Christian Andersen. 
### 
The next regular meeting of the
English Club will be held Tues
day evening, February 27th. in the
University chapel, and will be an
open meeting. Through the aid of
Professor E. K. Putnam and Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough, Miss Marie
L. Shedlock of London has con
sented to speak, and in order that
the college at large may have the
opportunity of hearing her, the
chapel has been engaged for that
evening. Miss Shedlock has a
world-wide reputation as a lecturer
and reader, and her success as an
interpreter of Hans Christian An
dersen, his life and his fairy tales,
has won her unbounded applause,
both in America and Europe. The
subject of Mies Shedlock's talk here
will be "Fun and Philosophy in
Hans Christian Andersen," and it
will lie illustrated by selections
from the Danish story writer.
At the close of the lecture the
English Club will tender Miss
Shedlock a reception at one of the
fraternity bouses, in order that the
club members may have an oppor
tunity of meeting her. The lecture
in the chapel will be open to the
public at large and will begin
promptly at 7:45. Miss Shedlock
will close her talk with a reading
from the "Knight and Barbara"
stories. This collection of stories
was taken from those told by Doc
tor Jordan in his story book, and
was illustrated and published sev
eral years ago. The edition of the
book was eminently successful, and
Miss Shedlock's rendering of the
story gives promise of being very
successful. On his recent visit to
Denver I)r. Jordan met Miss Shed
lock and reissued the invitation to
visit Stanford. Professor Cuhberley
of the Education department has
asked Miss Shedlock to speak to
the class in Education 1 on the
"Value of Story Telling in the Ele
mentary Schools." This subject is
one on which Miss Shedlock has
gained many valuable recommend
ations from prominent educators
throughout the country.
