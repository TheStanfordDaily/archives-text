The Junior Farce Committee
made a bad beginning when it
allowed the dramatists of the Uni
versity eight days in which to pre
pare their efforts for the usual com
petition. The report that the com
mittee intends to follow up this
step by banding out the part* to
those whom it deems most worthy
to fill them, omitting the customary
try-out, shows that they intend to
go from bad to worse. The Junior
farce cast last year was selected
by the try-out system, and the
result has amply justified the
method. Moreover a committee of
seven members has too many
friends in the University to admit
of a fair and impartial selection.
Thi√ü is a fact, the truth of which
has been demonstrated time and
time again in the history of Stan
ford dramatics, to the great discom
fort of Stanford audiences. Nor
does the very mediocre production
of ''She Stoops to Conquer," last
Friday night, seem to justify the
retention of the dramatic coach
4
who staged it.
