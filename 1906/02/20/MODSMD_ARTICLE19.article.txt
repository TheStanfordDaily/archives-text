The Junior and Freshman
classes have each voted substantial
sums to the fund for the building
of a new track. In order that Stan

| ford may have a track which shall
he on a par with the new football
stadium, it is necessary that the
Training House Corporation shall
not he continually hampered by
lack of funds. The special assess
ments alone will pay for but a
[small part of the proposed oval,
and to avoid placing a heavy bur
den of debt upon the shoulders of
the Corporation it is necessary that
money shall be forthcoming from
other sources. The contribution of
$100 from the Juniors and $50
from the Freshmen shows a true
Stanford spirit. The present Fresh
man class, as all Freshman classes,
is not yet on a firm financial foot
ing, and the unexpected proposed
gift from them at this time comes
as a pleasing surprise.
