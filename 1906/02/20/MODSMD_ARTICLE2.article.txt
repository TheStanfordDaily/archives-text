# Rain Prevents Baseball Games.
## 
### 
The Gantner and Mattern-Var
sity game, scheduled for this after
noon, was postponed on account of
rain. The San Francisco team
made the trip to the campus, and
up to noon it was expected that
the game would he played. The
rain which set in this afternoon,
however, soaked the diamond so
that play was impossible. The
1906 Belmont game was also called
off.
