Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Owing to a wrong impression
conveyed by that part of the head
ing of the article in Friday's issue
of the Daily Palo Alto concerning
the Stanford Settlement, which
states that "\V. Y. Wentz,'06, will
study for College Settlement," an
explanation seems neccessary in
order that my relation to the move
ment may be made clear. It is not
my intention, as the heading teems
to indicate, to make settlement
work my profession, but simply to
give my aid to Chaplain Gardner
in directing among undergradu
ates the study of the politics, eco
nomies, and sociology of college
settlements.
In addition to this explanation,
I wish to present a summary of the
Stanford Settlement movement up
to the present time, and also to in
dicate future plans, as outlined by
Chaplain Gardner. So far the
movement has met with enthusias
tic response from Stanford men
and women. The first step was
taken last semester when a meeting
of San Francisco alumni was held
at the Occidental Hotel, at which
the chief settlement workers of that
city were present. The second step
has been a series of University
meetings addressed by prominent
settlement workers. The next step
is shortly to be taken here at the
University, the plan being to form
a Stanford Settlement Club organ
ized on the same lines as the Eng
lish Club.
The club will meet at stated
times to talk over social, industrial
and political problems, social bet
terment and social settlements.
From time to time men of promi
nence in these fields will address
the club. In connection with the
club, groups will be formed for
social'studies, and later an advisory
board will be organized to act with
the alumni of San Francisco in the
foundation of a Stanford Settle
ment. W. Y. Wentz.
