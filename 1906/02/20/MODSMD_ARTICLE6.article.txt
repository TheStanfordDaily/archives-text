At a meeting of the Freshman
class this afternoon it was voted to
give fifty dollars from the class
treasury to the new track fund.
This sum is to be given as soon as
the amount of money collected
from dues exceeds one hundred dol
lars. Fifty dollars of this sum has
already been deposited in the treas
ury, and Treasurer Wyatt will ap
point collectors in the Hall, Palo
Alto, and among the fraternities
and sororities.
The Freshmen also decided to
adopt the present Sophomore hat
for next year, and a Hat Committee
has been appointed to send for
samples and prices.
