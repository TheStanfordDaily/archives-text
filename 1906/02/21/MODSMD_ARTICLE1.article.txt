# TRY-OUTS TO-MORROW
## CANDIDATES FOR THE TENNIS TEAMS WILL COMPETE. Twenty-One Entered for First Singles Tournament.—Courts in Poor Condition. 
### 
If the condition of the courts per
mits, twenty-one men will meet in
the first of the try-outs for the Var
sity tennis teams to-morrow morn
ing, at 8 o'clock, on the Encina
courts. The rain has left the
ground very slippery, but if it is
clear an attempt will be made to
play off the matches in the prelim
inary rounds early in the morning.
The new system of having the
tennis squad keep training rules
has put the players in good condi
tion for the try-outs. From the
form shown by several of the men
it is evident that some of the
matches to-morrow will be very
close and interesting. l t.
At a meeting of the executive
committee of the Tennis Club held
late this afternoon* G. E. Dole, '07,
was elected president of the club to
fill the vacancy caused by the res
ignation of B. S. Allen, '06. H. P.
Bittner, '07, was elected vice-presi
dent, the position T foraierly held by
Dole.
In case it is impossible to start
the try-outs to-morrow they will be
postponed until Saturday morning.
