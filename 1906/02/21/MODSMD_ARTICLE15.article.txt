# Glee and Mandolin Clubs Will Appear Before Belmont School.
## 
### 
The Combined Glee and Mando
lin Clubs will drive to Belmont
School to-morrow afternoon to give
a concert there in the evening.
About thirty members will make
the trip and a number of ladies
will accompany them. Several
tally-hos will be employed to carry
the crowd and they will return the
same evening after the concert and
dance at the school. The party
will leave thÂ©- campus about four
o'clock in the afternoon.
Practically the same program
will be rendered by the clubs as
was given on the holiday trip and
at the return concert. Kellogg, May,
and Bernard will give their stunts
which were so well received by the
University audience.
