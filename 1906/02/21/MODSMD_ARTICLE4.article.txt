# TALK ON ARBITRATION
## PROFESSOR JAMES AND DEAN HODGES ADDRESS ASSEMBLY. Value of Heroism in Peace Emphasized by Speakers at University Gathering This Morning. 
### 
Arbitration was the subject of the
second student body assembly of
the semester, which was held this
morning in Assembly Hall. In
the absence of President Jordan
and Vice-President Brantier, Pro
fessor C. A. Duniway, chairman of
the Committee on Public Exercises,
presided, and introduced the two
speakers, Dr. William James, act
ing head of the department of
Philosophy, and Dean Hodges,
special Memorial Church preacher.
Dr. James spoke in part as fol
lows:
"I wish simply to point out that
the anti-war party has to take ac
count of the bellicose constitution
of human nature. We inherit the
warlike type, and for most of the
capacities of heroism, martyrdom,
endurance, that the human race is
now so full of, we have to thank
this cruel evolutionary history. It
has bred the instinct of pugnacity
into our bone and marrow, and
thousands of years of peace could
not breed it out of us. We spend
hundreds of millions as a matter
of course when destructive battle
ships are asked for—yet universities
cost no more than battleships, and
last forever.
"But our imagination likes all
the pomp of war. The people love
it. Our minds feed on the thought
of war and bloodshed. The leaders
are not to blame for present wars;
the fault lies with public opinion.
Let it reach a certain pitch of ex
citement and no ruler can with
stand it.
"What is to be done about it?
Leave war for the imagination of
the future to play with. Leave
that possibility of romance open.
But circumvent the actual explo
sion. Arbitration treaties and the
Hague Tribunal form an organized
machinery for this purpose. To
you, young men and women of the
educated classes, I commend this
problem. Begin at all events by
speaking out as individuals, what
ever truth, however unpopular, is
in you. As Emerson says, 'He
who will always speak the truth
will not fail to find himself in suf
ficiently dramatic situations,' and
I may add, warlike situations. The
wars of the future must be waged
inside of every country, between
the destructive and constructive
ideals and forces."
Dr. James was followed by Dean
Hodges, who also spoke along the
same lines. "Dr. James spoke the
truth when he said that the war in
stinct is deeply ingrained in the
human race. But we are getting it
out now more rapidly than ever be
fore. In the past century more
than two hundred and fifty dis
putes have been settled by arbitra
tion, leading up to the establish
ment of the Hague Tribunal, and
that great peace monument, the
Christ of the Andes.
"We need public opinion to make

war unpopular and to lead to a
better appreciation of peace. We
need to gain a new perspective of
courage—the courage of peace and
not of war. We should recognize
the splendor of bravery, to be sure,
but of that real bravery that in
creases our value to our fellow
men. We must measure courage
by what it effects and not by the
glory that it brings to the doer. To
cite an example near to you:
when the President and professors
of this University were paying their
own salaries and staying here, for
love of the college,they showed not
the occasional courage that comes
with the roll of drums, but the
hard, grinding endurance of the
heroism of pence. We want to
translate the courage of Nathan
Hale into our every-day life for im
itation and emulation. Thus the
kingdoms of the earth shall be
come, indeed, the kingdoms of the
Prince of Peace."
Before and after the speeches, the
University Orchestra rendered some
selections.
