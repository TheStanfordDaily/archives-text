# FINAL WEEK OF TESTS
## ACADEMIC COUNCIL REGULATES TIME FOR EXAMINATIONS. Closing Six Days of Semester Will Be Set Apart Entirely for Examination Purposes. 
### 
At a meeting of the Academic
Council, which was held yesterday
afternoon, the following statute
was passed on recommendation of
the Faculty Executive Committee:
End-Semester Examination Period.
1. The last six days of the semester
(Saturday to be included) shall be
free from all recitations, lectures, and
required laboratory work, and shall
be set aside for examination purposes
for those instructors who desire to
give examinations of whatever sort at
the close of the semester.
2. No preliminary nor final exami
nations shall be held during the week
preceding this examination period.
3. A schedule of examinations for
each examination period shall be ar
ranged by the Committee on Sched
ules and Examinations and published
in advance in connection with the
Schedule of Lectures and Recitations,
and no end-semester examinations
shall be held at any other time except
by permission and arrangement of
the Committee on Schedule and Ex
aminations.
This action of the Academic
Council was taken to relieve the
congestion of examinations which
confronts many students at the
end of 'the semester. The new
regulation has been under the con
sideration of the council for over a
year, and many requests for such a
ruling have come to that body from
various sources.
The new statute is not intended
to force all professors to give ex
aminations, but simply to scatter
the final tests that are given over a
week and thus avoid having too
many occur on the same day. The
new regulation will go into effect
at the end of the present semester.
