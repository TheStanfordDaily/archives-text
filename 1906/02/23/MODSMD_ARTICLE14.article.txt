The action of the Academic
Council in establishing a final ex
amination week at the end of each
semester is thoroughly to be com
mended. The week will be de
voted entirely to examinations and
will be altogether free from lectures
and recitations. This arrange
ment will result most beneficially
in doing away with the confusion,
haste, and clamor which formerly
prevailed at the end of the semester
when lectures, recitations, labora
tory periods and examinations
were heaped together in one hope
less and incomprehensible jumble.
The rule prohibiting all prelimi
nary or final examinations during
the preceding week is also calculat
ed to avoid confusion, and the
published schedule is a most ad
mirable arrangement. The new
ruling will have the effect of sav
ing much time and inconvenience
to both faculty and students.
