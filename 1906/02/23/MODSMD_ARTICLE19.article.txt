# BASKET-BALL MEN DISBAND.
## Lack of Interest and Place to Play Make This Action Necessary. 
### 
The basket-ball squad, which has
maintained a desultory practice
since the opening of last semester,
has disbanded for the year. Ham
pered by a lack of interest among
the student body and having no
suitable place to play, the few who
have taken an interest in the game
have finally decided to discontinue
the efforts. This action was taken
on the advice of Professor Colbert
Searles, who has assisted the play
ers as coach. A challenge was late
ly received from the Santa Cruz
Young Men's Christian Association
for a game either at Stanford or at
Santa Cruz, but this was declined.
