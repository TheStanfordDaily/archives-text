# WATER LEVEL FALLS
## OARSMEN HANDICAPPED BY LACK OF WATER IN LAKE. Coach Murphy Formulates Plans for Interclass Regatta.â€”Race Will Be Rowed in Heats. 
### 
For some unexplained reason the
level of water in Lake Lagunita
has been rapidly falling during the
past few days. The water has been
flowing in as before, and because
of the recent rains it would seem
as if the lake should be higher
than it has been this year, but it is
now so low that the float in front
of the boat-house is nearly upon
dry land. This has greatly inter
fered with the work of the oars
men, making it difficult to get the
boats safely in and out of the lake.
Coach Murphy had planned to
put the shell in Lagunita this week,
in order to give both the Varsity
and Freshman candidates a little
practice in shell-rowing before go
ing to Redwood, but from the pres
ent outlook the oarsmen will be
forced to travel to the slough for
work very soon, and the shell
probably will not be putin the
lake this season.
Murphy plans to hold the inter
class races in about three weeks.
The distance rowed will be one and
one-half miles, the crews rowing in
heats, Sophomores against Fresh
men, Seniors against Juniors. The
winners of the two preliminary
races will meet in the final heat
for the championship. Murphy
has written toKeenan of San Fran
cisco asking him to rent a four
oared barge for the regatta.
The coach has not attempted to
make up any class crews and
probably will not put them to
gether until a week before the in
terclass contest. The candidates
for the Vareit}' four seem to have
caught the new stroke taught by
Murphy and are rowing in fine
form. Although continually shift
ed about in the boats, several crews
have rowed 34 and 36 strokes to
the minute across the short stretch
on the lake.
The Freshman squad is rapidly
dwindling and Murphy is begin
ning to get a line on the promising
candidates. Because of this nat
ural vveeding-out process no attempt
has yet been made to cut down the
number of first-year men and the
squad will he kept as it is until
practice is begun at Redwood.
