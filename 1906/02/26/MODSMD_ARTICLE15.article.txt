The librarian of the University
has called the attention of the
Daily Palo Ai,to to certain grave
offenses committed by students
ÃœBing the library. Reference books
have been removed from the shelves
before examinations, and have been
kept until the examinations were
over, thus causing incalculable in
convenience to those who wished to
make use of the volumes in ques
tion. Atlases have been taken
from the shelves in the reference
room and have been kept for days
at a time. In one instance a stu
dent in his impatience cut out the
desired maps, leaving the mutilated
volume on a desk. Bound maga
zines, current unbound magazines,
reference books loaned to the libra
ry by professors and the personal
property of the lenders, have also
disappeared in some unaccountable
manner. In addition to these in
stances of unlawful borrowing and
theft, there have been many cases
of vandalism and wanton destruc
tion of library property. Pictures
and articles have been cut out of
newspapers and magazines which
the library desires to preserve for
binding, and this mutilation ren
ders them valueless for that pur
pose. Offenses of this nature have
become so frequent that stringent!
measures have become necessary,
and those who abuse the privileges
of the library in this manner should
if detected be deprived of the right
to any further share in its advan
tages.
