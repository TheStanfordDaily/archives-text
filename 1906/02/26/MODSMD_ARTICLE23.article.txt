### 
The constitution and by-laws of
the Interscholastic Athletic Asso
ciation of Stanford University have
been printed in pamphlet form and
copies were mailed Friday night to
preparatory schools interested in the
association. Appended to the con
stitution and by-laws are the rules
for the annual meet, which include
all the events of intercollegiate field
days except the two-mile run. The
weights used are a twelve-pound
shot and a twelve-pound hammer.
The mile relay is run by five men,
each covering 352 yards. No ac
count of its result is to be taken
in deciding the winner of the meet,
in order that schools sending large
teams shall have the least possible
advantage over schools whose rep
resentatives are few in number.
The winner in each event shall
score five points, the second man
three, and third place shall count
one. The first three places shall
take respectively gold, silver and
bronze medals. When two or more
schools score an equal number of
points, if one of them shall have
been champion in the previous
year, that school shall continue to
hold the championship. If none
of these schools held the champion
ship in the previous year, the tie
shall be recorded on the Stanford
University cup, which shall be re
tained by the Board of Governors.
Except where cups are awarded
permanently, security must be fur
nished the association sufficient to
cover their value. Descriptions of
the Stanford University Cup, pre
sented by W. H. B. Fowler, '06, the
Sigma Sigma Trophy, presented by
the Sigma Sigma Junior frater
nity, and the Bittner Trophy,given
by H. P. Bittner, '07, are given.
