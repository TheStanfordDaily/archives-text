# REHEARSALS IN PROGRESS.
## Sword and Sandals Preparing the " Two Gentlemen of Verona," to Be Presented April 20th. 
### 
Sword and Sandals has begun
active rehearsals of' Two Gentlemen
of Verona," which is to be present
ed April 20th for the benefit of the
Band. The rehearsals now being
conducted are in the nature of a
try-out, and after the capabilities of
each individual are determined up
on the definite cast will be selected.
In the play there are fourteen
main parts, and as there are hardly
enough members in Sword and
Sandals to fill these, it is likely that
some talent outside of the society
will be included in the cast.
P. C. Edwards, '06, has been
elected coach and is supervising the
preparations for the production.
He has absolute charge of this end
of the play and no outside coach
will be secured. PI R. May, '06, is
business manager.
