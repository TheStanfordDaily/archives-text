# TRUSTEES DISCUSS ALLEN'S CASE
## Reinstatement Depends Upon Action of President Jordan and Faculty Committee on Student Affairs. 
### 
It now rests with the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs
whether Ken Allen will be allowed
to re-enter college this semester or
any other semester. The Board of
Trustees decided last Friday that
matters of this class in which dis
cipline plays an important part
shall be decided by the President
and any committee or committees
which he sees fit to appoint. For
Allen Dr. Jordan still expresses
the same admiration as a represen
tative Stanford student, but says
that because he caused the friction
between the students and faculty
he was suspended. Hewillbeglad
to see Allen reinstated, he says, but
desires to leave the matter in the
hands of Professor R. L. Green and
his committee. The trustees warm
ly approved of the efforts of the
University to abolish hazing. They
not only wish it stopped in the dor
mitories but stated emphatically
that the practice must be discon
tinued in the fraternity houses,
campus boarding and lodging
houses, and all University com
munities on and off the campus.
This decree indirectly sanctions the
proctor system as it stands in En
cina Hall and the other actions of
the faculty.
At the meeting Friday several
appointments and changes in the
faculty for next semester were
made.
Rennie W. Doane, '90, was ap
pointed Curator and Instructor in
Economic Entomology, and Horner
P. Earle, '04, Instructor in Ro
manic Languages, to fill the va
cancy caused by the absence of In
structor Stanley S. Smith, '03, who
will be gone on a two-years' leave
of absence. Smith will go to Eu
rope to enter the University of
Paris, where he will study for his
doctor's degree. He will then go
through Italy and Spain to take
practical work in the languages of
those countries. Doane received a
position as assistant entomologist

in the experiment station of the
Washington Agricultural College
at Pullman, Washington, after his
graduation. He remained there
four years, when he was made di
rector of the Washington State
Fisheries and Experiment Station
located in Seattle. From that
office, last September, he came to
Stanford as Assistant in Entomol
ogy. Doane will have charge of
the entomological collections here.
His work will also comprise the
study of the life histories of certain
insects, especially injurious ones.
Earle, the newly appointed In
structor in Romanic Languages,
since taking his degree here in
1904 has been studying at Johns
Hopkins.
The board also voted a substan
tial increase in the salaries of all
the younger members of the facul
ty, especially in the case of the in
structors, assistants and associate
professors. No change was made
in the amount received by the pro
fessors, as this was increased last
year.
The proposed plan of raising the
buildings directly adjoining the
Memorial Arch on either side to
two stories was favorably discussed
but action postponed until the
University is better prepared
financially to undertake the re
quired alterations. The laboratory
of the Metallurgy department is to
be given a complete fire-proofing
and will be completely disconnected
from the other buildings of the
quad. New quarters for the shops
of the Engineering departments
will be built as rapidly as there is
call for additional room.
It is likely that the community
will soon be delivered from the ten
der mercies of the bus drivers, as
there are several new plans to pro
vide conveniences to be governed
by the University. A system of
electric automobiles was given con
siderable attention at the meeting
last week.
