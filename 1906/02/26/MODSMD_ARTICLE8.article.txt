# Football Sub-Committee Will Meet.
## 
### 
The sub-committee, appointed by
the Stanford-California Football
Conference to suggest changes in
the present game, will not wait for
the football committees in the East
to act, but will meet sometime this
week. The replies which Dr. An
gell, the chairman of the commit
tee, has received in response to his
queries as to whether or not the
committee should await the action
in the East, are unanimous in the
opinion that because of the con
fusion among the Eastern experts,
the committee should meet at once.
