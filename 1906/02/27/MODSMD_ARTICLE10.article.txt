To-morrow is the anniversary of
the death of Mrs. Jane Lathrop
Stanford, the co-founder of this Uni
versity. The day should he fittingly
observed by all students by careful
abstinence from the usual holiday
frivolities, and the afternoon ser
vice in reverence to the sacred
memory of our noble founder should
be attended by every student in
the University. No more unselfish
woman ever lived. She sacrificed
everything and left all that she
had to the cause of free education
and enlightened culture. And she
left it not only to us, but to all
races and to every age. She has
left a monument more enduring
than the massive masonry of these
edifices. To-morrow we should go
with bowed heads and reverent
steps to pay homage to her name.
We should not in the enjoyment of
our gifts forget the magnificent self
sacrifice and noble generosity of
the giver.
