# TO CONSIDER CHANGES
## FOOTBALL SUB-COMMITTEE TO MEET THURSDAY EVENING. Men Appointed by the Football Conference Will Seek a Remedy for Present Game. 
### 
Dr. Angell, the chairman of the
sub-committee, which was ap
pointed by the Stanford-California
Football Conference to suggest
changes in the present game, an
nounced to-day that the committee
will meet Thursday evening at the
University Club in San Francisco.
The committee will consider rem
edies for the four evils of the game,
which were dealt with in the report
of the Stanford Faculty Athletic
Committee. The evils brought for
ward by this report were:
1. The closed formations favored
by the present rules make possible
unfair and brutal playing which
cannot be detected.
2. The game with its corps of at
tendants, and its complicated drill,
has become a business rather than
a sport.
3. The methods of play almost
wholly exclude men of medium
weight, however quick and agile
they may be. This means that a
large majority of students are shut
out of the game altogether.
4. The game is in no sense a col
lege sport; students do not form
volunteer teamß and play football
for sport as they play baseball,
though this was the practice in this
country and still is in England
and Canada.
Beside these objections to the
game the conference passed a num
ber of resolutions which will also
be considered by the sub-commit
tee in their attempt to suggest
changes for the game. The most
important of these recommenda
tions was to the effect that no
freshman shall be permitted to
compete on a Varsity team next
fall, and that the freshmen play
Rugby in their annual game.
Another suggestion laid before
the sub-committee was that the
athletic committees of both univer
sities shall obtain from every other
institution with which they play
games a satisfactory assurance that
each member of the team is a bona
fide amateur.
These points will all be consid
ered by the sub committee at its
meeting Thursday evening. The
committee is composed of the fol
lowing members: Stanford — Dr.
Frank Angell, chairman, J. F. Lan
agan, '00, Dr. A. B. Spaulding, '96.
California —Colonel Edwards. P.N.
Gray, and Dr. Frank Simpson.
