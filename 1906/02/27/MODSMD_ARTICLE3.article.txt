# PRESIDENT WILL WITHHOLD NEWS
## Dr. Jordan Refuses to Issue Further Items for Publication to Student Journalists. 
### 
"No more news will be given out
from the President's Office to either
Daily Palo Alto men or the stu
dent correspondents of the San Fran
cisco papers until some agresment is
arrived at between these correspond
ents and the President's Office by
which the news given out to them will
not be misconstrued."
This statement was this after
noon made to the editor-in-chief of
the Daily Palo Alto, the student
correspondents of the San Francisco
Chronicle, Examiner and Call, and
the Associated Press, by G.A.Clark,
secretary to the President, and ver
ified by President Jordan.
President Jordan gives as a cause
for this radical action the miscon
struction by both the Daily Palo
Alto and the outside papers of
news given out l>y them. As in
stances of this so-called miscon
struction are given the "journalistic
exploits" of last night's issue of
this paper, and of this morning's
stories in the San Francisco jour
nals.
The President objects to the first
two sentences in last night's Daily
Palo Alto which associate the
Allen case with the recent meeting
of the Board of Trustees. He ob
jects to the article, because, he says,
Allen's case lias always rested with
the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, and since he has never
stated that the trustees discussed
the case. The Daily Palo Alto
inferred that the Allen case had
been brought up and discussed
because of a written statement con
cerning the board meeting which
he gave the correspondent of the

San Francisco Call, and from
which the story in the Daily
Palo Alto was taken. The Presi
dent's revised statement of the ac
tion of the board meeting includ
ed a discussion of the Allen case,
and consequently the inference was
natural that the board had entered
into a discussion of the merits of
the case. President Jordan to-day
stated that he did not intend to
associate the Allen case with the
board meeting, and that his doing
so was a mistake. He did not deny,
however, that the case was discussed
by the trustees, as he is not at lib
erty to state what transpired at the
meeting.
The President objects to any en
largement of stories secured through
his oflice, and the consequent infer
ences drawn therefrom. President
Jordan desires absolutely that all
news from his oflice shall be printed
as given out by him or his secre
tary. Consequently until the Daily
Palo Alto, conjointly with the cor
respondents of the San Francisco
papers, arrive at some agreement,
they will be unable to secure any
further news from the President's
oflice. Just what form this agree
ment shall take the President and
secretary did not state. Hereafter
all news from the President's office
will be given out either by the
President or by G. A. Clark, secre
tary to the President, and this will
be communicated directly to the
San Francisco papers. The Daily
Palo Alto will hereafter accord
ingly be compelled to secure this
information from the columns of
the metropolitan dailies.
