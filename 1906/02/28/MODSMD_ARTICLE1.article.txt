# Simple Anniversary Services in Memory of Jane Lathrop Stanford
## Dean Hodges and Chaplain Gardner Preach Sermons in Memorial Church. 
### 
Simple and unostentatious ser
vices in Memorial Church marked
the first anniversary of the death
of Jane Lathrop Stanford. All
University exercises were suspend
ed for the day and all student ac
tivities were postponed. In the
afternoon at 4 a large congregation
gathered in Memorial Church and
listened to impressive addresses by
Dean Hodges and Chaplain Gard
ner.
CHAPLAIN GARDNER'S SERMON
My Friends: â€” .
We meet in loving memory of
the mother of the University. We
come to this 6ac.red place, the cen
tral shrine of all her joys and sor
rows, to weave a laurel wreath of
reverence.
This is not the time or the occa
sion to speak of Mrs. Stanford's
work and labor of love. Time will
mature a fitting eulogy. I venture
to speak simply of the sustaining
motives of the "widowed life." her
devotion to the memory of her
loved ones; her personal piety; her
passionate belief in a future life.
Her devotion to the memory of her
loved ones.
To speak of Mrs. Stanford's de
votion to her loved ones is to tread
on holy ground. Her mother heart
ever yearned for her boy; her wo
man heart was ever loyal to her
husband. All that was done in
the lonely years of bereavement
was bound with cords of love and
laid upon the altar of devotion.
The incense of that sacrifice still
clings about these cloisters, and
meeting thus we keep the censer
burning.
In her deep sorrow the lonely
woman prayed: "Forgive my grief
for one removed, Thy creature,
whom I found so fair. I trust he
lives in Thee, and there I find him
worthier to be loved."
Her personal piety.
Personal piety is one of the
graces of a strong character. Pos
sessed of an emotional nature,
trained in a religious home and in
an evangelical church, Mrs. Stan
ford's religious feelings dominated
her life. She had a deep and abid
ing consciousness of God. She be
lieved Christ to be her Savior. She
was a woman of prayer. Yet she
stood firm for intellectual freedom
in religious thought, and she rose
above all denominational predilec
tions in the statesmanlike provi
sions governing this Church.
This building is a monument to
Mrs. Stanford's piety. She built it
in memory of her husband. But
in setting in motion the spiritual
activities of this Church she ex
pressed her passionate hope that

through its fellowship and worship
the moral and spiritual life of
youth might be fostered. She be
lieved that the sons and daughters
of the University should be taught
to be God fearing men and women.
Some day our University world
will realize how substantial a con
tribution is thus made to the cause
of religion in relation to education.
Her belief in a future life.
As the sun of life set towards the
west, vexed by the cares of this
world, parted from her dearest and
her best, Mrs. Stanford yearned for
the life immortal.
She spoke of heaven with the
rapture of a mystic. For her the
invisible was vivid and real, peo
pled by the loved ones gone before.
I'he hope of immortality was the
shining light which led her on
through the dark and cloudy days.
She was not vexed by any influ
ences which seemed alien to her
simple faith. She believed that
Christ had abolished death, and
brought life and immortality to
light through the gospel. In that
belief she lived, she labored, she
suffered, she died.
I emphasize these three elements
of Mrs. Stanford's character, be
cause so far we may follow her ex
ample. We may be debarred from
doing great things for the state, but
love of family, simple piety, a spir
itual hope, these are graces of char
acter each of us may cultivate.
In a sunny land beyond the sea
her life went out. Far away from
kith and kin, far away from those
who would gladly have ministered
to her declining years, 6he died.
With simple pageant she was
laid to rest beside her loved ones.
To-day the hearts of her children
go out in reverence to the memory
of a noble woman whose life was
one of complete devotion to a noble
cause.
May God grant her peace, and
may His benediction rest upon her
work throughout all generations.
DEAN HODGES' SERMON.
We are met together in reverent
memory of the mother of this Uni
versity. It is significant that our
commemoration takes the form of a
religious service. This it does by
instinct, and as a matter of course.
We assemble here not only because
this church was Mrs. Stanford's
gift, and not only because it was
her pride and her joy, but because
it is a symbol of her spirit and of
her supreme desire for this institu
tion. This spirit and this desire
[she has put into abiding expression
in the inscriptions which are en
graved upon these walls.

Significance of church inscriptions.
Unable as I am to speak of Mrs.
Stanford from personal acquaint
ance, I offer as my contribution to
this anniversary some comment
upon these sentences. I am told
that they were probably her own
words. Here and there is a touch
which suggests quotation, but not
often. If there are quotations, no
account is given of their source. In
any case, she had made them her
own. They were the utterance of
Iter own thought.
The fact that she wrote these
words and had them graven here
shows that she desired that this
church should be not only a place
of beaut}' but a place of spiritual
profit. She had in mind the good
of the students. Great buildings
have been erected to the glory of
the builder, to satisfy a tasle for
architecture, to do a splendid thing
in a splendid way, to perpetuate a
name. This was built that it might
preach a sermon. The shining pic
ture over its outer doors proclaims
its meaning. All its windows, all
its walls, are significant. And lest
their significance should be lost in
the mere delight of beauty, here are
these inscribed panels, speaking in
plain letters and in plain English
from the heart of the founder to

the heart of the worshipper. She
spared no pains to dedicate this
place to the purposes of religion.
Some of these sentences are very
intimate in their character. They
are the result of personal experi
ence. "It is by suffering," the
founder says, "that God has most
nearly approached to man; it is by
suffering that man draws most near
to God." She had learned that by
her own pain. "Events," she says
again, "are messages of either
divine goodness or divine justice.
Each has a mission to fulfill." This,
also, she had proved by hard expe
rience. It was first written in her
heart, then on these stones. Even
the event of bereavement she had
come to understand as the bearer
of a message, as the ambassador of
a mission. It was in the realiza
tion of this truth that this Univer
sity came into being.
Mrs. Stanford's greatest sacrifice,
j Very personal and intimate and
touching are the frequent refer
ences here to the value of small
llhings. As if, in the midst of great
jiiches, the founder looked back
with a pang of regret to the days
when the simplicity of life was the
dominant note for her; when self
denial was a present virtue, not ac
