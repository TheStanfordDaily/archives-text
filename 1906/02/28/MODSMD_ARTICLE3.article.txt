This day in, for Stanford men
and women, a day of remembrance
and sorrow —the anniversary of
our greatest loss. It is fitting thai
it should be celebrated as it has
been celebrated with dignity and
simplicity, —a dignity and a sim
plicity worthy of the woman whose
memory we honor, and worthy of
the great service to which she dedi
cated her life. No finer tribute
could be paid to the devotion of
Mrs. Stanford than the silent sor
row of the student body, which
found its outward expression in
the flowers heaped around her
tomb.
