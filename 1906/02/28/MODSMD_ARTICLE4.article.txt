of the beloved founder of the Uni
versitv was the wealth of flowers,
placed in humble reverence and
love on the tomb of the benefactors.
The simplicity of the arrange

From the fraternities and soror
ities, from the various classes, from
the college dormitories, and from
every group of Stanford students
within reach, came a floral tribute,

year by the class of 1905, the Sen
ior class placed a large bunch of
pink carnations, and from the
Junior class came a wealth of white
rose buds and ferns.
From each of the fraternities and
organizations of the University

love, too numerous to be given in
dividual mention.
