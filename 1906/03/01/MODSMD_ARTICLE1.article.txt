# VARSITY TRACK MEET
## CHANCE TO MAKE RUBBING LIST TO-MORROW AFTERNOON. Manager Barrett Has Contest Scheduled with Strong Olympic Club Team for March 30th. 
### 
Trainer Moulton announces that
there will be a track meet at 3
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and
men who are not on the rubbing
list will have an opportunity of
making it. The track promises to
be in good condition, owing to the
favorable weather of the past two
days, and probably the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes will
be run full distance, and possibly
the hurdles. All the men in train
ing will enter this meet, and "Dad"
Moulton is anxious to increase the
rubbing list, as lie wants as many
men as possible from which to pick
his team. The intercollegiate
Freshman track meet is only four
weeks away and "Dad" wants to
have a strong team to represent us.
Manager Barrett has completed
arrangements for a Varsity track
meet with a team from the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco, to be
held Friday afternoon, March 30th.
The Olympic Club will be repre
sented by a strong team of about
eighteen men, captained by Andrew
Glamer, the well-known distance
runner and one of the best milers
on the Coast. Other strong men
who will wear the Olympic Club
emblem are Powell, a crack hur
dler, Abadie, a sprinter, and Flaw,
the great hammer-thrower. These
three men were all point winners
for California a few seasons ago.
Maundrell, Bonner, Williams and
several other Academic Athletic
League men will also be on the
team. All these men will start
training on the Lowell High School
track and will be under the care of
Trainer Cornell of the Olympic
Club, who states that his team will
be in good condition for the meet.
