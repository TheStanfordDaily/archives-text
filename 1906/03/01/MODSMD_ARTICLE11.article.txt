### 
Miss Marie L. Shedlock of Lon
don spoke before a large audience
under the auspices of the English
Club in the chapel Tuesday eve
ning on "Fun and Philosophy in
Hans Christian Andersen." In the
past six years Miss Shedlock has
delivered lectures on this and kind
red subjects, and she is perhaps
the greatest exponent of the tales of
Andersen now living. The lecture
was of a very informal nature, and
was greatly enhanced by the dram
atic light in which it was presented.
After the lecture the English Club
entertained Miss Shedlock at the
Alpha Phi House.
