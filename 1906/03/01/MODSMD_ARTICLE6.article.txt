# PLAN ENTERTAINMENT
## INTERSCHOLASTIC ASSOCIATION PROVIDES FOR GUESTS. Representatives of Fraternities and Hall Meet to Make Arrangements. 
### 
Representatives from the hall
and the fraternities met at the Zeta
l J si house on Tuesday evening to
discuss plans for the entertainment
of the students who will enter- the
track and field meet of the Inter
scholastic Athletic Association,
which will be held on March 24th.
An arrangement founded on that
in practice at Wesleyan University
was proposed by W. H. B. Fowler,
'06, and accepted as the most feas
ible. The association will welcome
any suggestions for the improve
ment of the plan adopted, which
follows as it was submitted:
"The names of all entries will be
received by the 17th. Each frater
nity, individual hall men, and men
in private houses will be asked to
tell exactly how many men it or
they can take. By that time, if a
fraternity has asked any individual
or team to be its guest, and the in
vitation has been accepted, the
fraternity shall at once notify the
secretary of the association, C. F
Laumeister. Thereafter all assign
ments shall he in the hands of the
committee.
"An effort will be made to keep
together the members of a team.
Each fraternity and the individual
hall men will be requested to ad
vise the secretary of the committee
as early as possible if they have
any special crowd among the vis
itors that they wish to entertain.
In certain houses there are men
from the high schools that will be
represented, or men who have per
sonal friends among the visitors,
and it will make the task easier
and more pleasant on both sides if
the assignments are made along
these lines.
"Where two or more crowds ex
press a desire to entertain a certain
team, the task of the committee is
made more difficult. It should be
left to the judgment of the com
mittee to make arbitrary assign
ments in certain cases, but ordi
narily it will be fair to all to flip a
coin or draw names from a hat.
"Once these assignments have
been made they must be strictly
observed. Each fraternity and
each hall man will be informed
which team or which athlete has
been assigned to it or to him to
look after, and there must be no
question but that that team or in
dividual will be allowed to keep
the assignment and not invited
elsewhere. Only in this way can
we all work in harmony.
"Each house and the president of
Encina Club will be asked to name
a representative who shall act on
a suit-committee on entertainment.
It will be the duty of each repre
sentative to meet at the train and
generally look after the visitors as
signed to his house or club. The
visitors will be apprized as to their
hosts, aud will be asked to inform
the committee as to the exact time

of their arrival. This information
will be furnished to the men on the
sub-committee.
"The committee thinks that no
special program of entertainment
is necessary. Such spare time as
the visitors may have will be pretty
well employed in looking about the
quadrangle and the campus, and
for Friday and Saturday evening
perhaps it will be possible to have
some small jinks in the Encina
club-room. The several clever
"stunt" men in college should be
able to put together a very fair
hour's enteitainment.
"With the hearty cooperation of
every one and a willingness to
make some small personal sacrifice
for a couple of days, the committee
feels thai it will be possible to
make the accommodation and en
tertainment part of the meet suc
cessful, with the resulting pleasure
to the visitors atid benefit to the
University."
