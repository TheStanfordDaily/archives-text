# VARSITY HITS THE BALL HARD
## Gantner-Mattern Nine Defeated This Afternoon by Big Score. 
### 
The Gantner-Mattern team was
easily defeated by the Varsity this
afternoon. The game started out
well, but as soon as the Varsity
took the lead the professionals
slowed up and the contest became
a Cardinal procession around the
bases. Both Sales and Goodell
were hit hard, but they received
good support, and succeeded in
keeping down the runs.
