Save
One-half
the cost of a trip East, and yet go in solid
comfort with ever}' courtesy, by traveling in
one of the fine new
Tourist Sleepers
of the Southern Pacific. While the rate is
very low, these cars are perfectly appointed,
have a conductor who looks out for you per
sonally. A most pleasant journey all the way.
Ask A. A. Hapgood, Agent, Palo Alto, Cal.,
about a trip East in a tourist car via
Southern Pacific
