ionable points; or, finally, to adopt
the Rugby game for the Freshman
and to play the annual Freshman
game in the spring. These four al
ternatives will be thoroughly dis
cussed, and the committees will en
deavor to formulate some definite
amendments to the agreement
which will settle the status of foot
ball on the Coast.
The amendment, supported by
the Stanford delegates, providing
for an entension of the one year
