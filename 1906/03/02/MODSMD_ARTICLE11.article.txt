# FACULTY CRITICIZED
## FEBRUARY "ALUMNUS" COMMENTS ON ALLEN CASE. Editor Timmons Devotes Editorial Space to Criticism of Action of Committee. 
### 
The February Alumnus contains
a number of articles of especial in
terest to the undergraduate student
body. The Allen case is complete
ly reviewed, and is also commented
upon editorially in a most inter
esting manner.
Editor Timmons writes in favor
of the stand Allen took, and decrvs
the petty and undiplomatic action
of the Student Affairs Committee.
The editorial in question follows:
"A student editor lacking in
moderation has been eliminated
from college life by a faculty com
mittee lacking in toleration. Two
lines of an editorial that most per
sons would have yawned over have
been construed as arch treason, and
another campus controversy has
got into print with the unseemly
accompaniments that strengthen
the mistaken conviction- in the
minds of a multitude that aca
demic freedom is unknown at
Stanford.
"The faculty committee on stu
dent affairs gave too much value to
the power of the press. Allen's
editorial was more of an effect than
a cause. Its influence on the moni
tors was due to their belief that it
fairly represented public opinion.
The committee did not make its
immediate task less arduous by
expelling Allen. It has to deal
with a new editor quite as cour
ageous as Allen, though it is to be
hoped more moderate. And its
reward is a very conclusive ex
pression of the student opinion of
it —an opinion long known to pre
vail by those in close sympathy
with the undergraduates.
"The Alumnus is truly sorry that
its appeal for harmony should
have helped to stir up discord.
The students who agree with Allen
that the Alumnus editor showed
great ignorance may be interested
to know that the faculty was as
little pleased. Neither side is
willing to admit itself wrong in the
least detail. The faculty commit
tee is more to be blamed, for its
members ought to be less petty,
less vindictive, more diplomatic and
more resourceful than the students
with whom they deal."
Besides the review of the Allen
affair, and the usual alumni notes,
the February issue contains an il
lustrated article on the new gym
nasium by Thomas A. Storey.
