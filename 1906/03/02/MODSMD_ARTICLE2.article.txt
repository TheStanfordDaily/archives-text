The sub-committee appointed by
the Stanford-California Football
Conference to suggest changes in
the present game met last evening
at the University Club in San
Francisco. The committee went
into executive session and the rec
ommendations which they will
make to the conference will not be
published until they have been
considered by that body. Dr. An
gel 1, the chairman of the sub-com
mittee, started to-day that the
members came to no satisfactory
agreement concerning the changes
in football. The date for the meet
ing of the Stanford-California con
ference has not yet been decided
upon, but President Wheeler, the
chairman, will probably call the
members together as soon as the
sub-committee announces that its
report is ready to be submitted.
