I'rince of Wales' household, and it
was then that the late Senator
Stanford met him. Soon after he
accepted a position in the Senator's
household. He accompanied Stan
ford on all his travels and was very
highly regarded by him.
Adderson also went to Honolulu
for a few years, where he managed
the Royal Hotel, and later was em
