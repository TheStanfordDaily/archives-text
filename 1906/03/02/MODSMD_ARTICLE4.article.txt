The plot centers round the college
custom of stealing various articles
of silverware from restaurants.
Jack Daring, '07, trying to obtain
a silver service for his house, is
caught, and sends a telegram to his
frat. brothers asking for bail. They
are unable to send this, and need
ing a prom, partner for Jack's
cousin and fiancee, they press Harry
Careless into this part and pass
him off as Jack. Jack, however, re
turns unexpectedly, but having two
detectives on his track, is forced to
go to the Junior prom, disguised.
Amusing complications arise from
this situation, and the comedy is
kept up by the two detectives and
Miss Peggy Blue, the girl from Ber

keley. At the end of the second
net everything in pretty well tangled
up, but all the difficulties are final
ly smoothed away in the last act.
The first act takes place in the
Lanebisan House, the second at the
Junior prom, and the third on the
quad, by moonlight.
