## BOTH PRELIMINARY GAMES PLAYED TO-MORROW. Line-up of the Four Teams Announced.—Sampson Will Captain Freshmen.

The preliminary games in the
interchips baseball series will be
played to-morrow. In the morn
ing at 10:30 the Sophomores and
Freshmen will meet and in the af
ternoon at 2 the Juniors will cross

four teams have been practicing
hard for the paet three weeks and
they are all so evenly matched*
that the series should be close and
exciting. The three upper-class
teams will be severely handicapped
by the disbarment of Sales, '06,
Daily, '07, Stott, '07, and Theile,
'08.
