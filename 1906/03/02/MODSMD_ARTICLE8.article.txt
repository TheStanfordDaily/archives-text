Every public corporation has
certain public duties which are un
avoidable, chief among which is the
duty of providing for the public
safety and the public health. A
coal-mining company should pro
vide its employees with safety
lamps, a railroad must so guard its
crossings that passers-by will not
be ground to pieces under rapidly
moving trains. A city must make
its streets safe for vehicles and pe
destrians by removing obstructions
and providing lamps. A Univer
sity is also a corporation doing a
public work, and it also has public
duties to perform in the land over
which it exercises jurisdiction. As
it is the duty of a town to light its
streets, it is the duty of a universi
ty to light its campus. In this
last step the University authorities
have failed to take the necessary
precautions. Not a single light il
luminates the main thoroughfare
from the gates to Memorial Arch.
On a cloudy or rainy night it is
impossible for a pedestrian to see
twenty feet in front of him. and he
is in grave danger of being run
down and seriously injured by
some cyclist who is riding without
a light. As a result all pedestrians
are forced to continuously whistle
to avoid collisions, and a person
who journeys to or from Palo Alto
after dark needs to be equipped
with a headlight and an auto horn.
Furthermore, there have been in
the past several instances of petty
hold-ups on the avenue, and in the
present regime of utter darkness, it
would be child's play for some en
terprising footpad to rob belated
students and escape undetected.
The University authorities should
place lights along the avenue for
the sake of the public safety, to
avoid serious accidents, and relieve
students of the disagreeable experi
ence of being thrown headlong into
a mud puddle by a false step in
the dark. Over five hundred stu

dentß reside in i'alo Alto, many of
whom are forced to study by night
in tiie library, and the University
should take the necessary precau
tions for their comfort and safety.
