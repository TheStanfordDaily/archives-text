The collectors appointed to re
ceive the payments of the special
assessment levied for the purpose
of constructing the new track have
thus far collected only two hun
dred and Beventy-six dollars. This
means that eleven hundred stu
dents of the University have not
paid the assessment. It seems in
credible that so large a number
should be so utterly lacking in en
thusiasm for one of the mo√üt im
portant branches of college activi
ties, but this is the evidence told
by the receipt-book.
The fifty-cent assessment was
levied at a regular student body
meeting, which all students were
urged to attend, and at which they
were privileged to express their
opinions regarding this important
undertaking. If for any reason
any student was not desirous of
having the measure passed, he
should have placed himself on
record to that effect then and there.
His very absence or failure to op
pose the adoption of the measure
bespoke confidence in the deliber
ations of the meeting or acquiesc
ence to the plans proposed. The
fact that the privilege of an open
meeting was extended the students
so that action would express the
general student body feeling, makes
it all the more incredible that
there should be numbered among
the students eleven hundred de
linquents. Fifty cents is not an
embarrassing sum for any Uni
versity student, and even if ad
vanced as an excuse it cannot be
accepted as reason for delinquent
payment.
A student sentiment should pre
vail which would not tolerate con
ditions of this sort. The men who
give their time and energy unre
mittingly to the upbuilding of a
strong track team, do so without
solicitation. Their compensation
is measured by the pleasure and
the benefit derived from training,

and eventually perhaps by the ac
quisition of a coveted emblem,
which may or may not be sufficient
remuneration for the services ren
dered. But in justice and fairness
to these men who do unnoticed
the hard, disagreeable drudgery
of training day after day, the other
portion of the student body should
assert itself in a liberal and sub
stantial response.
