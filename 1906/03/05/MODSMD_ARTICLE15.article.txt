# " Chaparral" Publishes Bright Issue.
## 
### 
The current issue of the Chapar
ral is noteworthy for the funny edi
torials and the good drawings.
The comment on the Sophomore
comedy is eminently just and its
fairness is supported by clever
puns and allusions. The full-page
crayon and half-tone illustrations
by E. E. Horowitz, '06, are promi
nent through their excellence.
The principal prose article, "A
Flea for the Open Game in Base
hall," seems to voice a popular
sentiment. The verse and jokes
are bright and amusing.
