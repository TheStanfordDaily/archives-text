### 
The freshman track candidates
at California held a preliminary
meet Thursday afternoon as a try
out to select the men who will meet
the sophomores in a dual contest
next Saturday. F. Q. Stanton,
who played half on the 1909 fresh
man team, won both the 100- and
220-yard dashes. R. R. Cowles
was the best all-round performer,
as he won both hurdle races, the
pole-vanlt, and tied for third in
the broad jump. Dozier was sec
ond in the 440-yard dash, which
was won by Rathbone. G. B. Bell
put the shot 36 feet 11 inches, and
the pole-vault was won at 10 feet
by R. M. Sheridan and R. R.
Cowles. No times were given out
in any track events, but Trainer
Christie announced that he was
very well satisfied with the results.
