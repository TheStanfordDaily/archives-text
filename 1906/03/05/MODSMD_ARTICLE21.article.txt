# ALUMNI IN TORNADO
## STANFORD MEN ON ISLAND OF TAHITI. Lives of H. J. Edwards, '01, and S. H. Adams, ex-'O4, Threatened by Fierce Tidal Wave. 
### 
Two prominent Stanford men,
H. S. Edwards, '01, and S. H.
Adams, ex-'O4, were among the
white persons whose lives were
threatened by the destructive tor
nado which visited the Society Isl
ands on February Bth, a vivid ac
count of which by Edwards is
published in yesterday's San Fran
cisco Examiner. Edwards and
Adams are both in the employ of
the Moore, Doty Co., owners of ex
tensive sugar plantations and co
coanut groves. Edwards is the
manager for the company at Pa
peete, Tahiti, and Adams was sta
tioned at the nearby island of Te
tiaroa with his wife, in charge of
fourteen native laborers.
After rough weather for ifour
days, the wind commenced to blow
hard on the morning of February
Bth. There was great destruction
of property and it was thought that
the island of Tetiaroa had been
badly washed. Edwards dispatched
the schooner Orohena to the island
from Papeete. Adams met the
vessel in a little boat and he and
his wife were taken back to Pa
peete.
While in college Edwards played
four years on the Varsity baseball
team, captaining the nine in his
senior year. The next two years,
1902 and 1903, he successfully
managed the finances of the stu
dent body. Adams was a member
of the 1901 Varsity intercollegiate
tennis team. Both Adams and
Edwards are members of Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity.
