A special meeting of the Execu
tive Committee was called this af
ternoon to consider the purchase of
new boats for Coach Murphy and
his men. Treasurer Barrett was
authorized to bid on three
barges and a shell which the Stock
ton Athletic Club is offering for
sale. He will make a definite
offer for the boats, and if it is ac
cepted he will probably bring them
to the campus within a week. The
barges are four-oared, while the
shell has but a single pair of oars.
Perhaps two of the barges only will
be placed on Lagunita, the others
being left at Redwood for use there
as soon as the crews begin training
on the bav.
