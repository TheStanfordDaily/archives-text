# FAVOR PRESENT GAME
## ATHLETIC COMMITTEES PASS RESOLUTIONS ON FOOTBALL. Boat Races Will Be Held over Sausalito Course on Last Saturday in April. 
### 
. "Resolved, That it be the sense
of this meeting of the Intercollegi
ate Athletic Committees of Stan
ford and California that the game
of football should remain as it is
played at present, abiding the mod
ifications advocated by the Nation
al Rules Committee."
In this resolution the Intercol
legiate Athletic Committees defined
their stand in the present agitation
against football on the Coast, at
their meeting Saturday night. The
committees took this action with
out any recommendation from the
Coast Football Conference. They
desired to put themselves on re
cord and to express what they be
lieved to lie the sentiment of the
student bodies of the two univer
sities. Moreover, the committees
had been forced to postpone their
meeting twice on account of the
slowness of the conference in tak
ing any action, and they did not
desire to wait any longer. The
resolution in itself will probably
have little effect on the conference,
as none of the faculty were repre
sented at Saturday's meeting.
The only other amendment to
the Intercollegiate Agreement fixed
the time and place for the intercol
legiate regatta for the next three
years. The races will be held over
the Sausalito course on Saturday,
April 28th. This was settled by
Managers Barrett and Decoto at a
meeting Saturday afternoon, and
ratified by the committees in the
evening.
The amendment regarding the
extension of the one-year residence
rule was tabled, the vote standing
three to three. An amendment in
troduced by Manager Barrett to
bar coaches and trainers from the
field during an intercollegiate con
test was also lost. The committees
will not meet again this semester
unless they are called to act on the
changes made by the Football Con
ference.
Everett Brown, one of Califor
nia's delegates, was absent, but his
proxy was voted by the other two
members of the Blue and Gold
committee. The members present
were:
Stanford—D. I). Sales, '06, E.
P. Stott, '07, and Manager R. W.
Barrett.
California —H. A. Encell and
Manager Ezra Decoto.
