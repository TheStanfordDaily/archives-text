# FRESHMEN vs. OAKLAND
## TRACK MEET TO BE HELD SATURDAY MORNING. High School Athletes Will Give First-Year Men Close Contest. 
### 
The Freshman track candidates
will have a meet with the Oakland
High School track team on Satur
day morning at 10. This is the first
meet of the season with an outside
team and it will afford some line
on the Freshman material.
Although Oakland has recently
lost some of her best men, the team
has been greatly strengthened by
the addition of Munn, the former
Modesto star. He is a great per
former in the high jump, pole
vault, and weights, and is expected
to enter the hurdles. Dozier and
Vail will also represent Oakland
in the hurdles. The high school
team is training hard and will un
doubtedly give the Freshmen a
close contest.
All the Freshmen seem to be in
good condition and Trainer Moul
ton expects them to do their best
Saturday morning. This meet
will give him an opportunity to
size up his material for the inter
collegiate Freshman meet which
is drawing near.
There will be a meet Friday af
ternoon among the Varsity candi
dates.
