# EASY FOR FRESHMEN
## FIRST-YEAR MEN DOWN SOPHOMORES 12 TO 3. Class of 1909 Hammers Menardi Hard and Often.—Sophomores Get Ball. 
### 
The Class of 1909 evened up old
scores this afternoon, taking the
Sophomores into camp to the tune
of 12 to 3. Menardi was batted
hard and often, and he received
very loose support. Witmer and
Goodell both pitched good ball.
The Freshmen scored four runs
in the first inning and from then
on they hammered out a run in
every inning but the fourth, end
ing by bunching up four more runs
in the seventh. The game broke
up in the eighth inning. Fenton,
who replaced Menardi in the box,
threw the ball to Vandervoort in
center field, who succeeded in elud
ing the Freshmen and escaped with
the ball. The feature of the game
was the hitting of Gadwalader and
Navlor, both of whom made three
hits out of four times at bat. The
score follows:
R H E
Freshmen 12 12 3
Sophomores 3 6 8
Batteries —Goodell, Witmer and
Richardson; Menardi, Fenton and
Cole. Umpire, Presley, '09.
