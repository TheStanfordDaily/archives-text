## STANFORD PROFESSORS TO CONDUCT EXPEDITION. Party to Sail in April for Investigation of Zoological Resources of Western Islands. 
### 
In April, under the supervision
of the United States government,
Professor C. H. Gilbert, head of the
department of Zoology, leaves San
Francisco on the steamer Alba
tross for an extended trip for
zoological research and investiga
tion. The expedition is important
because it is proposed to make a
thorough investigation of the aqua
tic resources of the northwest parts
of the Pacific about the Japanese
Archipelago.
The personnel of the party in
cludes men well known in zoologi
cal research, who have been en
gaged in this same work before.
President Jordan will be director
of the expedition and will have
general charge in matters pertain
ing to scientific investigations. Dr.
Gilbert will be chief naturalist and
will have charge of the dredging
and collecting operations. Dr. H.
B. Torrey of the University of Cal
ifornia and H. C. Fasset will also
accompany the expedition, the lat
ter having immediate charge of the
fishing and collecting of material.
Besides the above there are sev
eral general assistants. Dr. Harold
Heath, who left Stanford last se
mester for a tour of Europe and
who is at present in Naples engaged
in special study, Professor J. 0.
Snyder, M. Sindo and Charles V.
Burke will also assist in the work.
Dr. Gilbert will have general
charge of the ship and will attend
to the collecting operations. Dr.
Gilbert has had experience in this
line of work before. In 1902 he
was engaged in special study about
Hawaii and two years later he ac
companied another expedition of
research.
President Jordan will join the
party at Hakodate, Japan, where
he will work on shore, carrying on
the scientific investigations. Dr.
Heath will join the party in June.
The ablest zoologists of Japan will
also contribute their services to the
work.
The scope of the investigations
will include an investigation of the
aquatic life of the Japanese Archi
pelago and its relation to that of
Alaska and Hawaii; an examina
tion of the Japanese commercial
fisheries, their methods, and use
made of the marine products, con
cerning which we have much to
learn from the Japanese; an inves
tigation of the fish-cultural oys
ter, and an inquiry into the ad
visability and possibility of intro
ducing the oyster into this country.
The Albatross is specially fitted
for this kind of work, and is fully
equipped with all necessary appar
atus and fishing materials.
