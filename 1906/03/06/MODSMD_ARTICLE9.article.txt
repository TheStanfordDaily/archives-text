The triangular lot south of the
University library has been con
verted into a general rubbish
ground. A mass of tin cans, de
cayed vegetation, scraps of iron,
old paper, wire and wood cover
the entire triangle. The pile of
matter has been increasing daily
until it has Bpread from corner to
corner and side to side. It is a
pity that any part of the campus
should be disfigured by the pres
ence of an unsightly rubbish pile,
but conversion of what was for
merly a fairly respectable looking
part of the campus into a general
dumping ground is to be lamented.
The presence of this ugly mass of
matter is all the more to be de
plored because the plot upon which
it reposes is constantly being passed
by visitors and students either up
and down the avenue or to and
from Encina Hall. The mass of
rubbish dumped upon the triangle
is most offensive to the Bight, and
should either be covered by a thick
layer of soil or else entirely re
moved.
