# CHANGE CONSTITUTION
## INTERSCHOLASTIC ASSOCIATION CHOOSES OFFICIALS. Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Give Rates to Parties of Ten or More. 
### 
The board of governors of the
Interscholastic Athletic Association
of Stanford University met last
night and made an important
change in the constitution, affect
ing the eligibility of intending en
tries in the annual meet of the as
sociation. Article VIII was so
modified in regard to the regular
attendance of students at their re
spective schools that students may
register at a date not later than
three weeks after the opening of
school and still be eligible. Feb
ruary Ist was the date formerly
mentioned, but it was found that
owing to the late opening of some
schools the constitution did not al
low enough time for tardy regis
tration. A partial list of officials
was formulated and letters have
been sent to the men desired re
questing that they give their ser
vices at the meet on March 24th.
John Elliott, referee, and Luther
Cary,starter, prominent in amateur
athletics, particularly in intercol
legiate field meets, will be secured
if possible to act in their respective
accustomed capacities. William
Greer Harrison, president of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco,
who is especially interested in the
advancement of amateur sport, has
been asked to he a judge of the fin
ish. Colonel Edwards and Track
Captain Snedigar, of the University
of California, have been invited to
act as officials.
Manager Barrett has secured
from the Southern Pacific and the
Santa Fe a round-trip rate of one
single fare between Palo Alto and
all other points on the lines of the
respective railroads for parties of
ten or more. Barrett will try to
have the limit decreased in num
ber so that smaller parties may re
ceive the advantage of reduced
rates.
The cups which it has so far been
decided to award have been com
pletely designed by Shreve and
Company of San Francisco, who
have promised that they will be
finished in sufiicient time for exhi
bition first in the city and later at
the University. The board of gov
ernors have planned to assign a
number to each athlete entered in
the meet, to be worn conspicuously
while he is on the field. The num
bers will be printed in a separate
list on the program of the meet, so
that they will serve as an immedi
ate index to the name of every
man entered. Manager Barrett is
securing a number of tents for use
as dressing apartments. Large
teams will be given the disposal of
separate tents, while smaller aggre
gations will club together. Rub
bers and rubbing-tables in suffici
ent number will be furnished by
the association.
C. F. Laumeister, '07, secretary
of the Interscholastic Association,
