# MORE TRACK MONEY
## SOPHOMORE CLASS VOTES ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. Play Committee Reports.â€”Debating Pins to be Ordered Next Week. 
### 
At a meeting of the Sophomore
class this afternoon the sum of $100
was voted toward the track fund.
The report of the Play Committee
was presented by Chairman Menar
di. The receipts from the play
amounted to $813.20 and the ex
penditures $527.70, leaving a bal
ance of $285.50 in the treasury.
Few of the twenty-five cent assess
ments levied last semester have
been paid, and in order to get this
money at once President Smith
will appoint new collectors to col
lect the unpaid assessments. An
auditing committee consisting of
W. C. Theile, J. F. Reilly and C.
B. Nordhoff was appointed to look
over the Play Committee's report.
The debuting pins, awarded last
semester to W. F. Herron, L. New
land and W. C. Shelton, will be
purchased next week. The debat
ers will be given the privilege of
submitting their own design for a
pin to either C. B. Nordhoff or E.
N.Smith. The pins will cost no
more than class sweaters.
