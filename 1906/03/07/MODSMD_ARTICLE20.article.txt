# CHANGES IN FOOTBALL RULES.
## National Committee Makes Several Important Rulings. 
### 
At a meeting of the National
Football Rules Committee, held in
New York City last Saturday, sev
eral additional changes were made
in the rules, but no steps were
taken towards the final codifica
tion of the 1906 code.
It was decided at Saturday's
meeting to reduce the length of the
halves from 35 minutes tri 30, with
the customary intermission of 10
minutes. It was also voted to
recommend the adoption of a plan
looking to the instruction and su
pervision of officials, and suggest
ing that different sections of the
country appoint central commit
tees who shall be charged with the
introduction of such a system.
Rules regarding holding and
hurdling were submitted for con
sideration. A vote will be taken
on those rules March 30th.
