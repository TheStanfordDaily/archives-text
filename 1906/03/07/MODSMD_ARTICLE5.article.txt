# CLASS CREWS TO MEET
## INTERCLASS REGATTA WILL BE HELD AT REDWOOD CITY. Manager Barrett and Coach Murphy Decide to Buy No Boats from Stockton Club. 
### 
The annual interclass regatta
will be held on the slough at Red
wood City Saturday, March 17th.
The regatta will be rowed in the
boats now in use by the class crews,
as Manager Barrett and Coach
Murphy deem it inadvisable on ac
count of the time and trouble to
purchase the boats from the Stock
ton Athletic Club.
The races will be rowed in heats
and the crews will draw for the
choice of barge or shell, the shell to
be handicapped in some manner
not yet decided. The class crews
have not been selected, but it is
probable that the crews which
represented the three upper classes
in last year's regatta will be in the
boats this year. The Freshmen
are as yet an unknown quantity,
but in a few days Murphy will
have a provisional crew of four se
lected, with an additional four as
substitutes. The crew which rows
in the interclass will not be con
sidered the final selection, but will
be subject to change at the discre
tion of the coach.
The four-oared shell was put in
to the lake this afternoon for the
first time, and the old men given a
little fast work to prepare them for
salt water. The men will begin
work at Redwood City sometime
next week.
