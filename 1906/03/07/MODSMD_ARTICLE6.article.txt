# UNDER CLASSES CLASH.
## Freshmen Thrown in the Lake and Sophomores Forced to Perform Many Stunts. 
### 
A 8 an aftermath of the Freshman
victory yesterday afternoon, there
were several clashes between the
members of the two classes last
night. About ten o'clock some
twenty-five Sophomores gathered
on the Varsity diamond and
brought out the ball which had
been captured after the game.
Three Freshmen were captured and
were ordered to paint out the 1909
numerals, which ornament the
back-stop. The Freshmen refused
and were quietly carried up to
Lagunita and dropped in.
In revenge for this a party of
fifty Freshmen assembled on the
Varsity diamond and decoyed ten
Sophomores into their clutches.
They forced the second-year men
to paint the score of the afternoon's
game on the back-stop, and then
threw them into a nearby mud pud
dle. One of the victims was forced
to climb a tree and was assisted by
a stream of water in his ascent.
After tormenting their captives for
over an hour, the Freshmen re
leased them and dispersed.
