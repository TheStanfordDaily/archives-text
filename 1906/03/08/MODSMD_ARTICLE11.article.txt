To-morrow morning the Univer
sity community will gather in As
sembly Hall to honor the memory
of the man who made Stanford
University possible. There will
be addresses by three of the strong
est speakers in the faculty,—men
who are well worth hearing for
themselves and who will be doubly
so to-morrow since they will speak
on subjects that vitally concern
Stanford. We do not feel, perhaps,
the personal note so strongly in to
morrow's gathering as we did
when we assembled in Memorial
Church a week ago to honor the
memory of Mrs. Stanford. Her
life and death are still near enough
to the present generation of Stan
ford students to make her influence
a vital thing in Stanford life. But
the figure of the Senator is seen
only in the far-distant beginnings
of the University and his part in
Stanford life appeals to us only
through history and tradition. Yet
it is fitting that we honor him, if
not for what he is to us at least for
what he has done for us and for
Stanford University.
