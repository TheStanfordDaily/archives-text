# TRIALS WILL BE RUN.
## All Candidates for Track Team Will Be Tried Out To-morrow Afternoon. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon all the men
in training for track will run trials
in their different events. It will
not be a meet, hut if a man is train
ing for more than one event he will
have to run a trial in each distance
for which he is trying. In this
way Trainer Moulton expects to he
able to find out just what each man
is able to do.
The trials will begin at 2:30
o'clock and will be run just as soon
as the men come out. On account
of the interclass baseball game it is
likely that most of the men will
come out early and run their trials
so that they may witness the base
ball game. Trainer Moulton is
going to have several watches held
on each event so that there will be
no mistakes as to the exact time
which is done.
