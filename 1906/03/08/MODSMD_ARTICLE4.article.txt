# FINAL GAME FRIDAY
## JUNIORS AND FRESHMEN WILL MEET AT 2 O'CLOCK. Fast Contest Between Evenly Matched Teams to Decide Championship of the University. 
### 
At 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon
the Juniors and Freshmen will
meet on the Varsity diamond to
decide the class championship of
the University. Both teams are
fast and showed up well in their
preliminary games. The Fresh
men batted hard against a slow
ball pitcher, but it remains to be
seen what they can do against
Chalmers' fast pitching. The Jun
iors have the faster fielding team
and are stronger behind the bat,but
the Freshmen showed up better
with the bat and should give the
Juniors a close game.
Manager Barrett has scheduled a
game for the Varsity for Saturday
afternoon at 2:30 against a team
picked from the troops quartered
on Angell Island in San Francisco
bay. The army team is an un
known quantity, and Manager Bar
ret has been unable to secure their
