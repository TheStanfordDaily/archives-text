# "QUAD" BOARD CHOSEN
## EARL J. HADLEY NAMES SEVENTEEN ASSISTANTS. New Features to Be Introduced in Junior Year-book Which Will Be Published Next Year. 
### 
The hoard of editors of the 1908
Quad whs announced this morning
and the members notified by Editor
in-chief Earl J. Hadley. The board
is composed of seventeen members,
which is three larger than the 1907
and several greater than former
editions. Those who will assist in
editing the 1908 annual are: W. F.
Herron, J. E. Gushing, L. S. Levy,
D. H. Ferry, P. Stuart, F.W.Turn
er, R. E. Hodge, I). V. Marceau, C.
H. Merrill, C. L. Bradley, C. C.
McColloch, H. R. Brown, C. N.
Leach, E. N. Smith, Miss M. F.
Osborne, Miss C. Vickers and Miss
E. E. Dickover.
Several new innovations are
scheduled to appear in the next
annual record. The majority of
the changes will be along the line
of former editions, but will tend to
give individuality rather than
uniqueness to the book, as the pres
ent field of features has already
been widely worked over. The
specialization of the various de
partments will be the point at
which Hadley will devote most of
bis efforts.
Due to the specialization of the
departments the increase in the
board is attributed. The various
branches of undergraduate activi
ties will be handled by the heads
of the various departments, who
will have several assistants direct
ly responsible to them. This sys
tem is aimed to equalize the amount
of work and effectively cover the
field.
The work of the present edition
will take up all events up to the
Junior Day at which date the 1908
journal will commence. The board
has been appointed considerably
earlier than usual to avoid the con
fusion encountered by former edi
tions caused by the congestion of
events which occur at the com
mencement of the semester.
The book will cover the activi
ties of the coming year under the
various divisions: University Or
ganizations, Literary Societies, Mus
ical Clubs, Publications, Athletics,
Debating, Dramatics. Joshes, and
Statistics, and any innovations
which are to be made. The mem
bers of the board who have been
appointed to take charge of the de
partments have not yet been an
nounced by Hadley.
