The hoard of editors of the 1908
Quad whs announced this morning
and the members notified by Editor
in-chief Earl J. Hadley. The board

Leach, E. N. Smith, Miss M. F.
Osborne, Miss C. Vickers and Miss
E. E. Dickover.
Several new innovations are
scheduled to appear in the next
annual record. The majority of
