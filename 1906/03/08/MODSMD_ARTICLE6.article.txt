# NEW LAW DEGREE
## JURIS DOCTOR SUBSTITUTED FOR BACHELOR OF LAWS. New Title to Be Conferred Only on Those Students Who Have Taken Degree of Bachelor of Arts. 
### 
At a meeting of the Academic
Council yesterday afternoon the
following recommendations of the
executive committee regarding the
Law department were formally
adopted, and go into effect at once:
"That, in place of the existing
degree of Bachelor of Laws, the de
gree of Juris Doctor (J. D.) be con
ferred upon students who have
previously received the academic
degree of Bachelor of Arts, or its
equivalent, upon the completion of
a three years' professional law
course as defined by the Depart
ment of Law."
"That the degree of Bachelor of
Laws as at present conferred upon
special students in Law, upon the
completion, with distinguished ex
cellence, of the required fifteen
courses in Law, be not granted af
ter May, 1907."
"That the University issue, upon
the recommendation of the Depart
ment of Law, to special students
in Law who complete the three
years' course in Law without fulfill
ing the requirements for any de
gree, a certificate stating the com
pletion of such a course, in such
form as may have been agreed
upon."
The degree of Juris Doctor, as a
substitute for Bachelor of Laws, in
the case of students who have pre
viously taken the degree of Bache
lor of Arts, has already been adopt
ed at Chicago, Columbia, New
York and various other universi
ties. The degree J. U. D. (Doctor
of Civil and Canon Law) is a long
established degree in German uni
versities, and implies a less profes
sional study of the law than the
regular law courses of the Ameri
can universities. The new degree
is of course a conventional designa
tion, but has been selected because
something more appropriate than a
second bachelor's degree seemed to
be needed and because thus modi
fied it connects itself with the his
torical J. U. D. degree without pre
tending to cover exactly the same
field of study. The new law degree
has been under discussion by the
various law faculties for some
years and may now be said to be
fairly in the way of adoption gener
ally by American universities.
