# HALF-MILERS ARE FAST
## RUSSELL, '06, AND SEVERY, '08, RUN TRIALS IN 2:4. Nash, '07, Makes Good Time in the Two-Mile, and Halsey and Knupp Show Speed in the Mile. 
### 
There were a large number of
trials run on the track this after
noon, and several of the men made
good time. On account of the
interclass baseball game some of
the trials were not run until rather
late, and consequently the results
in to-night's paper are somewhat
incomplete. The weather was fine
and the track fast.
L. G. Russell, '06, and C. L.
Severy, '09, both ran the half-mile
in 2:4, which is remarkably good
time; and it seems that Stanford
will be very strong in this event in
the intercollegiate meet. T. T.
Bennett, '08, made 2:8 in the half
mile and showed that he is a
Varsity possibility in this event.
In the mile G. C. Halsey, '08, and
Guy Knupp, '07, ran in good time,
Knupp making 4:51.4 and Halsey
4:53. These are good performances,
as the mile is a difficult race to
run in fast time when a man runs
alone. C. F. Elwell, '07, made fast
time in both the quarter and the
220-yard dash. In the 440-yard
dash he did 0:54 flat and in the
shorter event he made 0:24. Elwell
ran his quarter first, so this makes
his time in the 220-yard dash very
good.
E. J. Nash, '07, ran a two-mile
trial in 10:43.3 and finished very
strong. W. C. Shelton, '08, paced
the first mile, which was fairly fast,
and Nash ran the last mile alone.
Nash's work was very good and
shows that he will be a very hard
man in the two-mile when the in
tercollegiate meet is held. A. C.
Freeman, '06, ran the quarter in
0:54 2 In the broad jumpT. Van
dervoort, '08, made 20 feet 2 inches,
but most of the men did about 19
feet 3 or 4 inches. L. M. Edwards,
'07, has run several trials in the
hundred the last few days and
makes a shade under 0:10 3. Yes
terday he ran the 220-yard dash in
0:23.2.
The Freshmen ran no trials this
afternoon as they have a meet with
Oakland High School to-morrow
morning at ten o'clock.
