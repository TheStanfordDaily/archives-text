# CONCERT WELL ATTENDED.
## Crowds Gather on Shores of Lagunita and Listen to Well-Rendered Program. 
### 
A crowd of over eight hundred
people listened to the first concert
given by the University Band at
Lagunita last night, livery boat
on the lake was out, and the banks
near the boat-house were lined
with people. The night was perfect
and the Band played splendidly.
The only fault to be found with
the concert was due to the fact
that the band-stand was so far
away from the audience that
distance destroyed the effect of the
lighter numbers. The quartet,
"Knight's Farewell," and the cor
net solo, "The Holy City," were the
best numbers on a well-selected
program.
