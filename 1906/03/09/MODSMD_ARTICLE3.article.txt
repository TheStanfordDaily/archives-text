# FOUNDER'S DAY OBSERVED.
## Speakers at Assembly Eulogize Senator and Mrs. Stanford and the Impulses That Created the University. 
### 
To-day the fiteenth Founder's
Day was observed by exercipes
held in the Assembly Hall. The
speakers were Professor M. B. And
erson, Dean G. Hodges, and Pro
fessor William James. These
three men spoke of the lives and
ambitions of the Founders, and of
the ideals of this University.
Dr. Jordan, in his introductory
remarks, deplored the absence of
the greater part of the student
body from the services, but pre
ferred that the attendance of the
students be spontaneous and not
compulsory. Professor Anderson
spoke first on "The Ideals of our
Founders"; and the Memorial
Church choir sang.
Dean Hodges addressed the as
sembly on "The Stanford Spirit,"
saying that the University has ev
ery opportunity to form a fine col
lege spirit, since our traditions are
still in the making. He then de
fined what a true spirit should be.
He spoke as follows:
The Stanford Spirit.
"By the Stanford Spirit I mean
the significance and expression of
the University. It is a blending of
the historical with the ideal. Be
cause your traditions are still in
the making, you are yourselves de
termining the spirit of the place.
We are concerned, therefore, to con
sider not only what the college
spirit actually is, but what it ought
to be.
"It is, in the first place, thespirit
of courtesy, — the function of the
University is not to turn out civil
engineers, chemists, merchants,
lawyers, ministers or school teach
ers, but men and women of culti
vation, with good manners, which
are the expression of fine feeling,
and with a certain attitude towards
the world. The courtesy of the
college appears in the athletic field,
where a man shows his good breed
ing or the lack of it by the dis
tinction which he makes between
sport and war. Our nervous anxi
ety to win is due in part to the
conditions of our American life, but
in a game it menaces that spirit of
courtesy which is of more value
than a thousand trophies. An
English gentleman and athlete, an
Oxford oarsman, came over here
some years ago to coach the Har
vard crew. He brought with him
the fine traditions of the older uni
versities. He greatly changed the
undergraduate relations between
Yale and Harvard. They had be
haved towards one another like the
street urchins of a country town.
He persuaded them to play their
games and row their races in the
spirit of wholesome adult manhood,
like gentlemen. This is the spirit
which, I am told, governs athletics
here.
What College Is.
"The spirit of courtesy widens out
into the spirit of the community. A
group of professors and company of
students do not make a college. A

catalogue does not make a college.
A business office does not make a
college. President Garfield said,
indeed, that a log of wood with a
student at one end and Dr. Mark
Hopkins at the other was good
enough college for him. But that,
while admirable in its essential
meaning, is not an adequate defini
tion. The college is a fraternity of
men of learning, old and young,
intent upon the truth, and inter
ested in the life which that purpose
implies. Their BUpreme desire is
that the fair name of the college
shall be exalted in the community.
In this spirit men come asking not,
What can the college do for me?
but, What can I do for the college?
Defects of California
"The general testimony of thought
ful persons is that two things are
the matter with California: one is
individualism, the other is materi
alism. They are both bad enough
while they last, and are alike op
posed to everything which a uni
versity signifies, but they are hope
ful defects. They belong with
their riches. They are outgrown as
the community becomes accus
tomed to its novel possessions, and
learns how to use them, and comes
to have traditions and understands
the responsibility which goes along
with privilege. Here it is, indeed,
that the college finds its mission in
the wise discipline of prosperity, in !
the instruction of the rich, in the
initiation of Midas and Croesus in
to the mystic fraternity of letters,
in teaching Dives how to make the
most of life, in establishing a right
perspective."
Professor James spoke at length
on "The Development of Stanford's
Ideal Destiny." He said in part:
Higher Learning Idealized.
"There is something almost pa
thetic in the way in which our suc
cessful business men seem to ideal
ize the higher learning and to be
lieve in its efficacy for salvation.
Never having shared in its bless
ings, they do their utmost to make
the youth of coming generations
more fortunate. Usually there is
little originality of thought in their
generous foundations. The donors
follow the beaten track. Their
good will has to be vague, for they
lack the inside knowledge, What
they usually think of is a new col
lege like all the older colleges; or
they give new buildings to a uni
versity, or help to make it larger,
without any definite idea as to the
improvement of its inner form.
Improvements in the character of
our institutions always come from
the genius of the various presidents
and faculties. The donors furnish
means of propulsion, the experts
within the pale lay out the course
and steer the vessel.
Heroism of Mrs. Stanford.
"'Where there is no vision, the
people perish.' Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford evidently hail vision of the
most prophetic sort. They saw the
opportunity for an absolutely
unique creation, they seized upon
it with the boldness of great minds;
and the passionate energy with
which Mrs. Stanford, after her hus
band's death, drove the original
plans through in the face of every
damaging obstacle, forms a chap
ter in the biography of heroism.
Heroic also the loyalty with which
in those dark years the president
and faculty made the University's
cause their cause, and shared the
uncertainties and privations.
Stanford University Is Unique.
"And what is the result to day?
To-day the key-note is triumph
antly "struck. The first step is
made beyond recall. The char
acter of the material foundation is
assured for all time as unique and
unparalleled. It logically calls
for an equally unique and unparal
leled spiritual superstructuie.
''Certainly the chief impression
which the existing University must
make on every visitor is something
unique and unparalleled. Its at
tributes are almost too hackneyed
to bear recapitulation. The classic
scenery of its site, reminding one
of Greece, Greek too in its atmos
phere of opalescent fire, as if the
hills that close us in were bathed
in ether, milk and sunlight; the
great city near enough to for con
venience, too far ever to become in
vasive; the climate so friendly to
work that every morning wakes
one fresh for new amounts of work;
the noble architecture, so generous
ly planned that there is room to
spare for every requirement; the
democracy of life, no one super
fluously rich, yet all sharing so
far as their higher needs go, in the
common endowment —where could
a genius devoted to the search for
truth, and unworldly as most gen
iuses are, find on the earth's whole
round a place more advantageous
to come and work in? Die Luft
der Freiheit iveht! All the tradi
tions are individualistic. Red
tape and organization are at their
minimum. Interruptions and per
turbing distractions hardly exist.
Eastern institutions look all dark
and huddled and confused in com
parison with this purity and se
renity. Shall it not be auspicious?
Surely the one destiny to which
this happy beginning seems to call
Stanford is that it should become
something intense and original, not
necessarily in point of wealth or
extent, but in point of spiritual
quality. The Founders have, as I
said, triumphantly struck the key
note, and laid the basis. The qual
ity of what they have given is
unique in character. It rests now
with the Stanford officials of the
present and future, it rests with
the devotion and sympathetic in-
sight of the growing body of grad
uates, to prolong the vision where
the Founders' vision terminated,
and to insure that all the succeed
ing steps, like the first steps, shall
single out this University more and
more as The University.
Nations Need Superior Men.
"The world is only beginning to
see that the wealth of a nation con
sists more than in anything else in
the number of superior men that it
harbors.ln the practical realm it has
always been recognized and known
that no price is too high to pay for
a great statesman or great captain of
industry. But it is equally so in
the religious and moral sphere, in
the poetic and aesthetic sphere.
Geniuses are ferments; and when
they come together as they have
done in certain lands at certain
times, the whole population seems
to share in the higher energy which
they awaken. The effects are in
calculable and often not easy to
trace in detail, but they are per
vasive and momentous.
Economic Value of Genius.
''From the bare economic point of
view the importance of geniuses is
only beginning to be appreciated.
Who can measure the cash value to
France of a Pasteur, to England of
a Kelvin, to Germany of an Ost
wald, to us here of a Burbank?
One main care of every country in
the future ought to be to find out
who its first-rate thinkers are and
to help them. Cost here becomes
something entirely irrelevant, the
returns are sure to be incommens
urable.
Universities Encourage Genius.
"This is what wise men the
world over are perceiving. And as
the universities are already a sort
of agency providentially provided
for the detection and encourage
ment of mental superiority, it
would seem as if that one among
them that followed this tide most
successfully would quickest rise to
a position of paramountcy and dis
tinction.
"Why should not Stanford im
mediately adopt this as her vital
policy? Her position is one of
unprecedented freedom. Not tram
meled by the service of the state,
as other universities on this Coast
are trammeled, independent of
students' fees and consequently of
members, Utopian in the material
respects I have enumerated. She
only needs a boldness like that
shown by her Founders to become
the seat of a glowing intellectual
life sure to be admired and envied

the world over. Let her claim her
place; let her espouse her destiny.
Let her call great investigators
from whatever lands they live in,
— from England, France, Germany,
Japan, as well as from America.
She can do this without presump
tion, for the advantages of this
place for steady mental work are
so unparalleled. Let those men
following the happy traditions of
the place make the University.
The original foundation had some
thing of eccentric in it. Let Stan
ford not fear to he eccentric to the
end, if need be. Let her not imi
tate, let her lead, not follow.
Future of Stanford.
"Can we not, as we sit here to
day, frame a vision of what it may
be in a century hence, with the
honors of the intervening years all
rolled up in its traditions? Not
vast, but intense; less a place for
teaching youths and maidens than
for training scholars; devoted to
truth; radiating influence; setting
standards; shedding abroad the
fruits of learning; mediating be
tween America and Asia, and help
ing the more intellectual men of
both continents to understand each
other better. What a history! and
how can Stanford ever fail to enter
upon it!"

Future of Stanford.
"Can we not, as we sit here to
day, frame a vision of what it may
be in a century hence, with the
honors of the intervening years all
rolled up in its traditions? Not
vast, but intense; less a place for
teaching youths and maidens than
for training scholars; devoted to
truth; radiating influence; setting
standards; shedding abroad the
fruits of learning; mediating be
tween America and Asia, and help
ing the more intellectual men of
both continents to understand each
other better. What a history! and
how can Stanford ever fail to enter
upon it!"
To-day the fiteenth Founder's
Day was observed by exercipes
held in the Assembly Hall. The
speakers were Professor M. B. And
erson, Dean G. Hodges, and Pro
fessor William James. These
three men spoke of the lives and
ambitions of the Founders, and of
the ideals of this University.
Dr. Jordan, in his introductory
remarks, deplored the absence of
the greater part of the student
body from the services, but pre
ferred that the attendance of the
students be spontaneous and not
compulsory. Professor Anderson
spoke first on "The Ideals of our
Founders"; and the Memorial
Church choir sang.
Dean Hodges addressed the as
sembly on "The Stanford Spirit,"
saying that the University has ev
ery opportunity to form a fine col
lege spirit, since our traditions are
still in the making. He then de
fined what a true spirit should be.
He spoke as follows:
The Stanford Spirit.
"By the Stanford Spirit I mean
the significance and expression of
the University. It is a blending of
the historical with the ideal. Be
cause your traditions are still in
the making, you are yourselves de
termining the spirit of the place.
We are concerned, therefore, to con
sider not only what the college
spirit actually is, but what it ought
to be.
"It is, in the first place, thespirit
of courtesy, — the function of the
University is not to turn out civil
engineers, chemists, merchants,
lawyers, ministers or school teach
ers, but men and women of culti
vation, with good manners, which
are the expression of fine feeling,
and with a certain attitude towards
the world. The courtesy of the
college appears in the athletic field,
where a man shows his good breed
ing or the lack of it by the dis
tinction which he makes between
sport and war. Our nervous anxi
ety to win is due in part to the
conditions of our American life, but
in a game it menaces that spirit of
courtesy which is of more value
than a thousand trophies. An
English gentleman and athlete, an
Oxford oarsman, came over here
some years ago to coach the Har
vard crew. He brought with him
the fine traditions of the older uni
versities. He greatly changed the
undergraduate relations between
Yale and Harvard. They had be
haved towards one another like the
street urchins of a country town.
He persuaded them to play their
games and row their races in the
spirit of wholesome adult manhood,
like gentlemen. This is the spirit
which, I am told, governs athletics
here.
What College Is.
"The spirit of courtesy widens out
into the spirit of the community. A
group of professors and company of
students do not make a college. A

catalogue does not make a college.
A business office does not make a
college. President Garfield said,
indeed, that a log of wood with a
student at one end and Dr. Mark
Hopkins at the other was good
enough college for him. But that,
while admirable in its essential
meaning, is not an adequate defini
tion. The college is a fraternity of
men of learning, old and young,
intent upon the truth, and inter
ested in the life which that purpose
implies. Their BUpreme desire is
that the fair name of the college
shall be exalted in the community.
In this spirit men come asking not,
What can the college do for me?
but, What can I do for the college?
Defects of California
"The general testimony of thought
ful persons is that two things are
the matter with California: one is
individualism, the other is materi
alism. They are both bad enough
while they last, and are alike op
posed to everything which a uni
versity signifies, but they are hope
ful defects. They belong with
their riches. They are outgrown as
the community becomes accus
tomed to its novel possessions, and
learns how to use them, and comes
to have traditions and understands
the responsibility which goes along
with privilege. Here it is, indeed,
that the college finds its mission in
the wise discipline of prosperity, in !
the instruction of the rich, in the
initiation of Midas and Croesus in
to the mystic fraternity of letters,
in teaching Dives how to make the
most of life, in establishing a right
perspective."
Professor James spoke at length
on "The Development of Stanford's
Ideal Destiny." He said in part:
Higher Learning Idealized.
"There is something almost pa
thetic in the way in which our suc
cessful business men seem to ideal
ize the higher learning and to be
lieve in its efficacy for salvation.
Never having shared in its bless
ings, they do their utmost to make
the youth of coming generations
more fortunate. Usually there is
little originality of thought in their
generous foundations. The donors
follow the beaten track. Their
good will has to be vague, for they
lack the inside knowledge, What
they usually think of is a new col
lege like all the older colleges; or
they give new buildings to a uni
versity, or help to make it larger,
without any definite idea as to the
improvement of its inner form.
Improvements in the character of
our institutions always come from
the genius of the various presidents
and faculties. The donors furnish
means of propulsion, the experts
within the pale lay out the course
and steer the vessel.
Heroism of Mrs. Stanford.
"'Where there is no vision, the
people perish.' Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford evidently hail vision of the
most prophetic sort. They saw the
opportunity for an absolutely
unique creation, they seized upon
it with the boldness of great minds;
and the passionate energy with
which Mrs. Stanford, after her hus
band's death, drove the original
plans through in the face of every
damaging obstacle, forms a chap
ter in the biography of heroism.
Heroic also the loyalty with which
in those dark years the president
and faculty made the University's
cause their cause, and shared the
uncertainties and privations.
Stanford University Is Unique.
"And what is the result to day?
To-day the key-note is triumph
antly "struck. The first step is
made beyond recall. The char
acter of the material foundation is
assured for all time as unique and
unparalleled. It logically calls
for an equally unique and unparal
leled spiritual superstructuie.
''Certainly the chief impression
which the existing University must
make on every visitor is something
unique and unparalleled. Its at
tributes are almost too hackneyed
to bear recapitulation. The classic
scenery of its site, reminding one
of Greece, Greek too in its atmos
phere of opalescent fire, as if the
hills that close us in were bathed
in ether, milk and sunlight; the
great city near enough to for con
venience, too far ever to become in
vasive; the climate so friendly to
work that every morning wakes
one fresh for new amounts of work;
the noble architecture, so generous
ly planned that there is room to
spare for every requirement; the
democracy of life, no one super
fluously rich, yet all sharing so
far as their higher needs go, in the
common endowment —where could
a genius devoted to the search for
truth, and unworldly as most gen
iuses are, find on the earth's whole
round a place more advantageous
to come and work in? Die Luft
der Freiheit iveht! All the tradi
tions are individualistic. Red
tape and organization are at their
minimum. Interruptions and per
turbing distractions hardly exist.
Eastern institutions look all dark
and huddled and confused in com
parison with this purity and se
renity. Shall it not be auspicious?
Surely the one destiny to which
this happy beginning seems to call
Stanford is that it should become
something intense and original, not
necessarily in point of wealth or
extent, but in point of spiritual
quality. The Founders have, as I
said, triumphantly struck the key
note, and laid the basis. The qual
ity of what they have given is
unique in character. It rests now
with the Stanford officials of the
present and future, it rests with
the devotion and sympathetic in-
sight of the growing body of grad
uates, to prolong the vision where
the Founders' vision terminated,
and to insure that all the succeed
ing steps, like the first steps, shall
single out this University more and
more as The University.

Future of Stanford.
"Can we not, as we sit here to
day, frame a vision of what it may
be in a century hence, with the
honors of the intervening years all
rolled up in its traditions? Not
vast, but intense; less a place for
teaching youths and maidens than
for training scholars; devoted to
truth; radiating influence; setting
standards; shedding abroad the
fruits of learning; mediating be
tween America and Asia, and help
ing the more intellectual men of
both continents to understand each
other better. What a history! and
how can Stanford ever fail to enter
upon it!"
To-day the fiteenth Founder's
Day was observed by exercipes
held in the Assembly Hall. The
speakers were Professor M. B. And
erson, Dean G. Hodges, and Pro
fessor William James. These
three men spoke of the lives and
ambitions of the Founders, and of
the ideals of this University.
Dr. Jordan, in his introductory
remarks, deplored the absence of
the greater part of the student
body from the services, but pre
ferred that the attendance of the
students be spontaneous and not
compulsory. Professor Anderson
spoke first on "The Ideals of our
Founders"; and the Memorial
Church choir sang.
Dean Hodges addressed the as
sembly on "The Stanford Spirit,"
saying that the University has ev
ery opportunity to form a fine col
lege spirit, since our traditions are
still in the making. He then de
fined what a true spirit should be.
He spoke as follows:
The Stanford Spirit.
"By the Stanford Spirit I mean
the significance and expression of
the University. It is a blending of
the historical with the ideal. Be
cause your traditions are still in
the making, you are yourselves de
termining the spirit of the place.
We are concerned, therefore, to con
sider not only what the college
spirit actually is, but what it ought
to be.
"It is, in the first place, thespirit
of courtesy, — the function of the
University is not to turn out civil
engineers, chemists, merchants,
lawyers, ministers or school teach
ers, but men and women of culti
vation, with good manners, which
are the expression of fine feeling,
and with a certain attitude towards
the world. The courtesy of the
college appears in the athletic field,
where a man shows his good breed
ing or the lack of it by the dis
tinction which he makes between
sport and war. Our nervous anxi
ety to win is due in part to the
conditions of our American life, but
in a game it menaces that spirit of
courtesy which is of more value
than a thousand trophies. An
English gentleman and athlete, an
Oxford oarsman, came over here
some years ago to coach the Har
vard crew. He brought with him
the fine traditions of the older uni
versities. He greatly changed the
undergraduate relations between
Yale and Harvard. They had be
haved towards one another like the
street urchins of a country town.
He persuaded them to play their
games and row their races in the
spirit of wholesome adult manhood,
like gentlemen. This is the spirit
which, I am told, governs athletics
here.
What College Is.
"The spirit of courtesy widens out
into the spirit of the community. A
group of professors and company of
students do not make a college. A

catalogue does not make a college.
A business office does not make a
college. President Garfield said,
indeed, that a log of wood with a
student at one end and Dr. Mark
Hopkins at the other was good
enough college for him. But that,
while admirable in its essential
meaning, is not an adequate defini
tion. The college is a fraternity of
men of learning, old and young,
intent upon the truth, and inter
ested in the life which that purpose
implies. Their BUpreme desire is
that the fair name of the college
shall be exalted in the community.
In this spirit men come asking not,
What can the college do for me?
but, What can I do for the college?
Defects of California
"The general testimony of thought
ful persons is that two things are
the matter with California: one is
individualism, the other is materi
alism. They are both bad enough
while they last, and are alike op
posed to everything which a uni
versity signifies, but they are hope
ful defects. They belong with
their riches. They are outgrown as
the community becomes accus
tomed to its novel possessions, and
learns how to use them, and comes
to have traditions and understands
the responsibility which goes along
with privilege. Here it is, indeed,
that the college finds its mission in
the wise discipline of prosperity, in !
the instruction of the rich, in the
initiation of Midas and Croesus in
to the mystic fraternity of letters,
in teaching Dives how to make the
most of life, in establishing a right
perspective."
Professor James spoke at length
on "The Development of Stanford's
Ideal Destiny." He said in part:
Higher Learning Idealized.
"There is something almost pa
thetic in the way in which our suc
cessful business men seem to ideal
ize the higher learning and to be
lieve in its efficacy for salvation.
Never having shared in its bless
ings, they do their utmost to make
the youth of coming generations
more fortunate. Usually there is
little originality of thought in their
generous foundations. The donors
follow the beaten track. Their
good will has to be vague, for they
lack the inside knowledge, What
they usually think of is a new col
lege like all the older colleges; or
they give new buildings to a uni
versity, or help to make it larger,
without any definite idea as to the
improvement of its inner form.
Improvements in the character of
our institutions always come from
the genius of the various presidents
and faculties. The donors furnish
means of propulsion, the experts
within the pale lay out the course
and steer the vessel.
Heroism of Mrs. Stanford.
"'Where there is no vision, the

He persuaded them to play their
games and row their races in the
spirit of wholesome adult manhood,
like gentlemen. This is the spirit
which, I am told, governs athletics
here.
What College Is.
"The spirit of courtesy widens out
into the spirit of the community. A
group of professors and company of
students do not make a college. A

catalogue does not make a college.
A business office does not make a
college. President Garfield said,
indeed, that a log of wood with a
student at one end and Dr. Mark
Hopkins at the other was good
enough college for him. But that,
while admirable in its essential
meaning, is not an adequate defini
tion. The college is a fraternity of
men of learning, old and young,
intent upon the truth, and inter
ested in the life which that purpose
implies. Their BUpreme desire is
that the fair name of the college
shall be exalted in the community.
In this spirit men come asking not,
What can the college do for me?
but, What can I do for the college?
Defects of California
"The general testimony of thought
ful persons is that two things are
the matter with California: one is
individualism, the other is materi
alism. They are both bad enough
while they last, and are alike op
posed to everything which a uni
versity signifies, but they are hope
ful defects. They belong with
their riches. They are outgrown as
the community becomes accus
tomed to its novel possessions, and
learns how to use them, and comes
to have traditions and understands
the responsibility which goes along
with privilege. Here it is, indeed,
that the college finds its mission in
the wise discipline of prosperity, in !
the instruction of the rich, in the
initiation of Midas and Croesus in
to the mystic fraternity of letters,
in teaching Dives how to make the
most of life, in establishing a right
perspective."
Professor James spoke at length
on "The Development of Stanford's
Ideal Destiny." He said in part:
Higher Learning Idealized.
"There is something almost pa
thetic in the way in which our suc
cessful business men seem to ideal
ize the higher learning and to be
lieve in its efficacy for salvation.
Never having shared in its bless
ings, they do their utmost to make
the youth of coming generations
more fortunate. Usually there is
little originality of thought in their
generous foundations. The donors
follow the beaten track. Their
good will has to be vague, for they
lack the inside knowledge, What
they usually think of is a new col
lege like all the older colleges; or
they give new buildings to a uni
versity, or help to make it larger,
without any definite idea as to the
improvement of its inner form.
Improvements in the character of
our institutions always come from
the genius of the various presidents
and faculties. The donors furnish
means of propulsion, the experts
within the pale lay out the course
and steer the vessel.
Heroism of Mrs. Stanford.
"'Where there is no vision, the
people perish.' Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford evidently hail vision of the
most prophetic sort. They saw the
opportunity for an absolutely
unique creation, they seized upon
it with the boldness of great minds;
and the passionate energy with
which Mrs. Stanford, after her hus
band's death, drove the original
plans through in the face of every
damaging obstacle, forms a chap
ter in the biography of heroism.
Heroic also the loyalty with which
in those dark years the president
and faculty made the University's
cause their cause, and shared the
uncertainties and privations.
Stanford University Is Unique.
"And what is the result to day?
To-day the key-note is triumph
antly "struck. The first step is
made beyond recall. The char
acter of the material foundation is
assured for all time as unique and
unparalleled. It logically calls
for an equally unique and unparal
leled spiritual superstructuie.
''Certainly the chief impression
which the existing University must
make on every visitor is something
unique and unparalleled. Its at
tributes are almost too hackneyed
to bear recapitulation. The classic
scenery of its site, reminding one
of Greece, Greek too in its atmos
phere of opalescent fire, as if the
hills that close us in were bathed
in ether, milk and sunlight; the
great city near enough to for con
venience, too far ever to become in
vasive; the climate so friendly to
work that every morning wakes
one fresh for new amounts of work;
the noble architecture, so generous
ly planned that there is room to
spare for every requirement; the
democracy of life, no one super
fluously rich, yet all sharing so
far as their higher needs go, in the
common endowment —where could
a genius devoted to the search for
truth, and unworldly as most gen
iuses are, find on the earth's whole
round a place more advantageous
to come and work in? Die Luft
der Freiheit iveht! All the tradi
tions are individualistic. Red
tape and organization are at their
minimum. Interruptions and per
turbing distractions hardly exist.
Eastern institutions look all dark
and huddled and confused in com
parison with this purity and se
renity. Shall it not be auspicious?
Surely the one destiny to which
this happy beginning seems to call
Stanford is that it should become
something intense and original, not
necessarily in point of wealth or
extent, but in point of spiritual
quality. The Founders have, as I
said, triumphantly struck the key
note, and laid the basis. The qual
ity of what they have given is
unique in character. It rests now
with the Stanford officials of the
present and future, it rests with
the devotion and sympathetic in-
sight of the growing body of grad
uates, to prolong the vision where
the Founders' vision terminated,
and to insure that all the succeed
ing steps, like the first steps, shall
single out this University more and
more as The University.
Nations Need Superior Men.
"The world is only beginning to
see that the wealth of a nation con
sists more than in anything else in
the number of superior men that it
harbors.ln the practical realm it has
always been recognized and known
that no price is too high to pay for
a great statesman or great captain of
industry. But it is equally so in
the religious and moral sphere, in
the poetic and aesthetic sphere.
Geniuses are ferments; and when
they come together as they have
done in certain lands at certain
times, the whole population seems
to share in the higher energy which
they awaken. The effects are in
calculable and often not easy to
trace in detail, but they are per
vasive and momentous.
Economic Value of Genius.
''From the bare economic point of
view the importance of geniuses is
only beginning to be appreciated.
Who can measure the cash value to
France of a Pasteur, to England of
a Kelvin, to Germany of an Ost
wald, to us here of a Burbank?
One main care of every country in
the future ought to be to find out
who its first-rate thinkers are and
to help them. Cost here becomes
something entirely irrelevant, the
returns are sure to be incommens
urable.
Universities Encourage Genius.
"This is what wise men the
world over are perceiving. And as
the universities are already a sort
of agency providentially provided
for the detection and encourage
ment of mental superiority, it
would seem as if that one among
them that followed this tide most
successfully would quickest rise to
a position of paramountcy and dis
tinction.
"Why should not Stanford im
mediately adopt this as her vital
policy? Her position is one of
unprecedented freedom. Not tram
meled by the service of the state,
as other universities on this Coast
are trammeled, independent of
students' fees and consequently of
members, Utopian in the material
respects I have enumerated. She
only needs a boldness like that
shown by her Founders to become
the seat of a glowing intellectual
life sure to be admired and envied

the world over. Let her claim her
place; let her espouse her destiny.
Let her call great investigators
from whatever lands they live in,
— from England, France, Germany,
Japan, as well as from America.
She can do this without presump
tion, for the advantages of this
place for steady mental work are
so unparalleled. Let those men
following the happy traditions of
the place make the University.
The original foundation had some
thing of eccentric in it. Let Stan
ford not fear to he eccentric to the
end, if need be. Let her not imi
tate, let her lead, not follow.
Future of Stanford.
"Can we not, as we sit here to
day, frame a vision of what it may
be in a century hence, with the
honors of the intervening years all
rolled up in its traditions? Not
vast, but intense; less a place for
teaching youths and maidens than
for training scholars; devoted to
truth; radiating influence; setting
standards; shedding abroad the
fruits of learning; mediating be
tween America and Asia, and help
ing the more intellectual men of
both continents to understand each
other better. What a history! and
how can Stanford ever fail to enter
upon it!"
