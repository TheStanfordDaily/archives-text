# FOUNDER'S DAY OBSERVED.
## Speakers at Assembly Eulogize Senator and Mrs. Stanford and the Impulses That Created the University. 
### 
To-day the fiteenth Founder's
Day was observed by exercipes
held in the Assembly Hall. The
speakers were Professor M. B. And
erson, Dean G. Hodges, and Pro
fessor William James. These
three men spoke of the lives and
ambitions of the Founders, and of
the ideals of this University.
Dr. Jordan, in his introductory
remarks, deplored the absence of
the greater part of the student
body from the services, but pre
ferred that the attendance of the
students be spontaneous and not
compulsory. Professor Anderson
spoke first on "The Ideals of our
Founders"; and the Memorial
Church choir sang.
Dean Hodges addressed the as
sembly on "The Stanford Spirit,"
saying that the University has ev
ery opportunity to form a fine col
lege spirit, since our traditions are
still in the making. He then de
fined what a true spirit should be.
He spoke as follows:
The Stanford Spirit.
"By the Stanford Spirit I mean
the significance and expression of
the University. It is a blending of
the historical with the ideal. Be
cause your traditions are still in
the making, you are yourselves de
termining the spirit of the place.
We are concerned, therefore, to con
sider not only what the college
spirit actually is, but what it ought
to be.
"It is, in the first place, thespirit
of courtesy, â€” the function of the
University is not to turn out civil
engineers, chemists, merchants,
lawyers, ministers or school teach
ers, but men and women of culti
vation, with good manners, which
are the expression of fine feeling,
and with a certain attitude towards
the world. The courtesy of the
college appears in the athletic field,
where a man shows his good breed
ing or the lack of it by the dis
tinction which he makes between
sport and war. Our nervous anxi
ety to win is due in part to the
conditions of our American life, but
in a game it menaces that spirit of
courtesy which is of more value
than a thousand trophies. An
English gentleman and athlete, an
Oxford oarsman, came over here
some years ago to coach the Har
vard crew. He brought with him
the fine traditions of the older uni
versities. He greatly changed the
undergraduate relations between
Yale and Harvard. They had be
haved towards one another like the
street urchins of a country town.
He persuaded them to play their
games and row their races in the
spirit of wholesome adult manhood,
like gentlemen. This is the spirit
which, I am told, governs athletics
here.
What College Is.
"The spirit of courtesy widens out
into the spirit of the community. A
group of professors and company of
students do not make a college. A

catalogue does not make a college.
A business office does not make a
college. President Garfield said,
indeed, that a log of wood with a
student at one end and Dr. Mark
Hopkins at the other was good
enough college for him. But that,
while admirable in its essential
meaning, is not an adequate defini
tion. The college is a fraternity of
men of learning, old and young,
intent upon the truth, and inter
ested in the life which that purpose
implies. Their BUpreme desire is
that the fair name of the college
shall be exalted in the community.
In this spirit men come asking not,
What can the college do for me?
but, What can I do for the college?
Defects of California
"The general testimony of thought
ful persons is that two things are
the matter with California: one is
individualism, the other is materi
alism. They are both bad enough
while they last, and are alike op
posed to everything which a uni
versity signifies, but they are hope
ful defects. They belong with
their riches. They are outgrown as
the community becomes accus
tomed to its novel possessions, and
learns how to use them, and comes
to have traditions and understands
the responsibility which goes along
with privilege. Here it is, indeed,
that the college finds its mission in
the wise discipline of prosperity, in !
the instruction of the rich, in the
initiation of Midas and Croesus in
to the mystic fraternity of letters,
in teaching Dives how to make the
most of life, in establishing a right
perspective."
Professor James spoke at length
on "The Development of Stanford's
Ideal Destiny." He said in part:
Higher Learning Idealized.
"There is something almost pa
thetic in the way in which our suc
cessful business men seem to ideal
ize the higher learning and to be
lieve in its efficacy for salvation.
Never having shared in its bless
ings, they do their utmost to make
the youth of coming generations
more fortunate. Usually there is
little originality of thought in their
generous foundations. The donors
follow the beaten track. Their
good will has to be vague, for they
lack the inside knowledge, What
they usually think of is a new col
lege like all the older colleges; or
they give new buildings to a uni
versity, or help to make it larger,
without any definite idea as to the
improvement of its inner form.
Improvements in the character of
our institutions always come from
the genius of the various presidents
and faculties. The donors furnish
means of propulsion, the experts
within the pale lay out the course
and steer the vessel.
Heroism of Mrs. Stanford.

people perish.' Mr. and Mrs. Stan
