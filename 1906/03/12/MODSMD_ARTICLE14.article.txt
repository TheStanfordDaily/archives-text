# TRACT NOT SECURED
## COURSE FOR GOLF CLUB HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED UPON. Board of Trustees Too Busy to Consider the Matter at Last Meeting and Will Take it Up at Next. 
### 
The Board of Trustees, at their
recent meeting, were unable to con
sider the matter of a tract of land
for the Stanford Golf Club. He
cause of the large amount of busi
ness which was scheduled to go
before the meeting the appeal from
the Golf Club was forced to remain
untouched. The project will be
discussed at the next meeting of
the board.
In the meantime the organizers
of the club are securing prospective
members and making known the
plans and purposes of the club to
those who are interested in the
game. At the present time a large
number of enthusiasts have signi
fied their willingness to join the
club and it is expected that many
more will do so when the land is
secured. This fact has prevented
much progress, and when the tract
is secured tin- club will make rapid
strides in advance. The tract of
land just beyond the Cooksey place
was surveyed Inst week and found
to contain between thirty and forty
acres. This will be sufficiently
large to provide a nine-hole course,
which is the present plan of the
club. As soon as word is secured
from the Board of Trustees or
Treasurer Lathrop the club will
meet and complete its organization.
