The various class and University
organizations which have staged
amateur productions of any sort in
Assembly Hall have been forced to
contend with inconveniences of every
nature. The inadequate facilities
for shifting and changing scenery
have proven such a serioushandicap
thatiwenty and thirty minute waits
between acts have been occasioned
at different times. The inadequate
staging and machinery for scene
shifting augmented by the incom
petent unprofessional stage hands,
have resulted in destroying the
pleasant effect of numerous pro
ductions.
Sword and Sandals are busying
themselves with ways and means
with which to remedy existing in
convenient conditions, and have
placed before the presidents and
treasurers of the four classes a
proposition which will eliminate
the long and tiresome waits between
acts, and which will facilitate
matters on the stage so that the
amateur stage hands can set
a scene within five minutes.
The plan of building a gridiron
on the stage will be presented to
the Executive Committee for
approval, and if the committee's
action is favorable, Sword and
Sandals will proceed with the erec
tion of the required machinery.
It is to be hoped that no hitch
will prevent the consummation of
this excellent plan, and that the
gridiron may be installed in time
for the Junior Farce.
