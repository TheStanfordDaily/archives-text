### 
Professor William Oswald, a Ger
man philosopher who has lectured
at the University of California
Summer School, criticised the
American student upon his return
to Germany last week. He said:
"Football, before all, is loved un
commonly by the American stu
dent, and it is practiced in such
fashion that academic and state
authorities are near to forbidding
it altogether. The personal atten
tion of the student, aside from his
studies, is criticised alone in sport,
which draws this attention alto
gether from intellectual or esthetic
pursuits. In the course of a single
semester nineteen students fell vic
tims to enraged, brutal handling.
At all the American universities
are open amphitheatres in which
many thousands of spectators view
the periodic football battles."
