# DEBATING TRY-OUTS
## THREE TEAMS WILL BE CHOSEN THIS MONTH. New System Based on Those Used by Harvard and California Will Be Put in Practice. 
### 
Stanford debaters are busily en-1
gaged in preparing for the annual
intercollegiate try-outs which occur
in several weeks. The last week
before Easter vacation three differ
ent teams will be chosen: one to de
bate California, another to debate
Nevada, and a third to serve as a
practice team for the main trio.
A new system of choosing debat
ing squads was inaugurated this
year, partly formed on the Califor
nia and partly on the Harvard
plan. The California custom of
holding but one big try-out upon
the intercollegiate question waß
adopted, and in consequence the
old method of holding one or more
preliminary debates to thin out the
number of candidates was abol
ished . All the aspirants for places
are preparing on the football ques
tion, and in the closing week of the
month a series of squads will Bpeak
on this subject, perhaps two whole
afternoons and evenings being tak
en for the purpose. The nine best
speakers, with alternatives, out of
the many candidates will be chosen
at this time to constitute the three
teams before mentioned.
The Harvard part of the new sys
tem is the idea of picking a prac
tice team for the Varsity trio. This
idea has long been successfully in
use at the Eastern university, and
will be given a thorough trial here.
Stanford's second team will meet
Nevada on home ground this year
according to the agreement entered
into with the sage-brush university
last spring. A question will soon
be submitted to them for their
choice of sides and a date set for
the debate.
