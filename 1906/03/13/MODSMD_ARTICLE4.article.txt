## SWORD AND SANDALS ASKS AID FOR PLAN. To Build "Gridiron" for Assembly Hall which Will Do Away with Unnecessary Delays. 
### 
In response to a call from Sword
and Sandals, there was a meeting
of representatives from the four
classes last evening at the Delta
Tau Delta house to consider the
proposition of appropriating money
to build a "gridiron" for the Assem
bly Hall stage. A "gridiron" is a
wooden framework hung between
the Hies and above the stage. The
scenes, which are hung from the
"gridiron," can be raised and low
ered with but little delay.
Several schemes were proposed
last evening to raise $150 necessary
to putin the framework. As prac
tically all the scenery belongs to
Sword and Sandals, the proposi
tion of charging for various sets of
scenery used in student productions
was considered.
Another plan proposed was that
the four classes appropriate money,
but this was not considered feasible,
especially on account of the heavy
expenses with which the Senior
class is now burdened, and also be
cause considerable money has been
given by the classes to the track
fund.
The third tentative plan was to
present the proposition before the
Executive Committee for their ap
proval and sanction. If the Exec
utive Committee approves of the
plan the "gridion" will be built at
once and will probably be ready
for the Junior farce.
