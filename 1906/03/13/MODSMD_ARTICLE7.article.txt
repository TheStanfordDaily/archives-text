# CLASS CREWS CHOSEN
## MURPHY SELECTS MEN TO ROW IN INTERCLASS REGATTA. Freshman Squad Is Cut Down to Ten Men.—Difficulty in Selecting a Senior Crew. 
### 
The make-up of the class crews,
with the exception of the 1906 four,
was announced this afternoon by
Coach Murphy. The crews are as
follows:
Freshman —A. B. Shutts, stroke,
P. A. Robinson, 3, It. YV. Hornby,
2, H. J. Hatch, bow, G. Costar, cox
swain.
Sophomore—E. N.Smith, stroke,
L. R. Gay, 3, R. H. Conant, 2, A.
N. Cole, bow, F. W. Turner, cox
swain.
Junior —F. Zimmerman, stroke,
D. R. Gardner, 3, N. P. Bryan, '2,
C. E. Bee, bow, C. W. Henderson,
coxswain.
Owing to the fact that there are
but four Seniors on the squad,
Coach Murphy will be obliged to
select some other oarsman to pull
with the 1900 men. B. Bryan, M.
M. Stearns, and W. A. Paxton will
pull oars and E. V. Henley will
be the Senior coxswain. Murphy
will choose a man to fill the vacant
place sometime before the end of
the week.
The Freshman crew which will
go into the interclass races will not
necessarily be the four that will
row against the California first
year men in the interclass re
gatta. Besides the regular 1909
crew Murphy has retained six other
Freshmen on the squad: S. B. Dole,
\V. H. Stark, C. F. Smith, F. L.
Fetzer, S. C. Bias and F. Parton.
If at a later date these men show
themselves better oarsmen than the
present crew, Murphy will change
the make-up of the 1909 four.
During the present week the men
will row together as class crews in
preparation for the regatta. In or
der to do away with the unfairness
which might result from injudicious
handicapping in case the intercol
legiate races were rowed in the
barge and shell, Coach Murphy
yesterday wrote to the California
oarsmen and asked them for the
use of their barge in the coming
contest.
