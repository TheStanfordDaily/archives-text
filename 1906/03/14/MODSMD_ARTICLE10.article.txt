The Stanford Golf Club is at last
a reality, due to the determined ef
forts and indefatigable work of sev
eral members of the faculty and
student body. It is to be hoped
that those faculty and student body
members who play golf but who
have thus far evinced no interest
in the newly founded organization
will do so now, as the golf links
are assurred. The maintenance of
the links will depend on the
financial support of the stu
dents of the University, and the
project deserves the support of the
entire student body, since it adds
another s.port to the list of athletic
recreations and affords a further
avenue for athletic development
and pastime.
