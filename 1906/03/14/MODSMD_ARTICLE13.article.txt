Another step is about to betaken
in the development of the idea of
social science among the under
graduates. Rev. D. Charles Gard
ner has addressed a circular letter
to members of the University ask
ing them to meet at the home of
Vice-President Branner a week from
to-morrow evening. The object is
the formation of a Stanford Social
Science Club, which will meet peri
odically and semi-eocially.
The club will attempt to foster
among the undergraduates the idea
of social science. There will be
sections organized for the study of
social problems, social betterment,
and University settlement. In this
connection a good working library
has been added to that in Memorial
Church.
Under the auspices of the club
social work will be done by its
members in the neighborhood of the
University. The club will secure
speakers on sociological subjects
and others to give their experiences
in university settlements. At the
meeting next week the club will be
formally organized and a president,
secretary and advisory board elect
ed. The advisory board will act in
conjunction with an alumni associ
ation looking forward to a Stanford
University Settlement in San Fran
cisco.
The whole matter of social sci
ence will be brought before the stu
dent body at an assembly to be
held in April, at which President
Jordan, Dean Hodges and Rev. D.
Charles Gardner will be speakers.
