# Interfraternity Baseball.
## 
### 
A meeting of representatives
from the various fraternities was
held last night at the Phi Delta
Theta house to discuss plans for
interfraternity baseball. Drawings
were made, and the teams will be
gin playing off the series for the
championship cup at once. Var
sity men will not be barred unless
Coach Lanagan refuses them per
mission to play. The champion
ship cup has already been awarded
twice; last year it was won by Zeta
Psi, and the year before that by
Phi Delta Theta. The cup must
be won three times to become the
permanent property of ntiy frater
nity. The series will be run off
along the lines of a tennis tourna
ment, the losers dropping out and
the winners playing down to the
finals. E. Green, '07, was elected
general manager of the series.
The drawings follow: Phi Gamma
Delta vs. Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Theta Delta Chi vs. Sigma Chi,
Zeta Psi vs. Phi Kappa Psi, Phi
Delta Theta vs. Delta Tau Delta,
Chi Psi vs. Kappa Alpha, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon vs. Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Sigma vs. Sigma Nu, and
Beta Theta Pi, a bye.
