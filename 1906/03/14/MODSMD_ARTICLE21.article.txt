At a meeting held Monday night
J. R. Hickey, ex-'OB, appeared be
fore the Pacific Amateur Associa
tion and requested that the associa
tion send down a team of athletes
to meet the Varsity on March 30th.
This was the date that the Olympic
Club team was to have held their
meet with Stanford, but the
club men announced that they
would be unable to come. The Pa
cific Amateur Association stated
that it would be glad to send down
gome athletes to meet the Varsity,
but Manager Barrett has not yet
received an official communication
from the association.
