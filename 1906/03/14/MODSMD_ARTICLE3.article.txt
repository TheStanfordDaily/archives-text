# ABBOTT ON FOOTBALL
## HEAD LAW PROFESSOR ARGUES AGAINST MODERN GAME. Debating Candidates Hear Interesting Lecture on Intercollegiate Question. 
### 
Professor Nathan Abbott de
livered an interesting address in
the Law building yesterday on the
football agitation. There were
fifty or more undergraduates pres
ent, principally the candidates for
the debating teams, who are study
ing the football question for their
try-outs.
Dr. Abbott ha√ü pronounced views
against the modern game. He de
veloped his argument with partic
ular regard to the wording of the
intercollegiate question. He held
that the ideal of a university was
to graduate a cultured, educated
gentleman; and then citing Presi
dent Eliot as authority and speak
ing from his own personal obser
vations, he held that the modern
game had such inherent evils of
professionalism, and encouraged
such general corruption in univer
sity athletics, that it was predju
dicial to this ideal.
Speaking more particularly, Dr.
Abbott warmly commended the ac
tion of Columbia University in
abolishing the game there, and he
prophesied that this stand would
soon be taken by all the major uni
versities of the country. The
speaker drew an interesting paral
lel between the attitude of Har
vard and Yale toward athletics.
Though himself a Yale graduate,
the law professor denounced the
conduct of athletics at his alma
mater and highly commended as
straightforward and manly the
position which Dr. Eliot has always
demanded at Harvard.
Dr. Abbott speaks with some
little authority on this question,
having been a student, as he ex
plained yesterday, of university
athletics for many years. He has
gathered much data on the subject
and has a mass of statistical and
documentary evidence to substanti
ate his assertions.
