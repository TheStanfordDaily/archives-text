# Interclass Will Be Rowed in Barges.
## 
### 
The California oarsmen notified
Coach Murphy to-day that they
were willing to lend their barge to
Stanford for the interclass races,
which are to he held at Redwood
next Saturday. Since the Califor
nia boat is practically the same
model as the one now in use by
the Stanford squad, this courtesy
of the Blue and Gold oarsmen will
do away with the necessity of hand
icapping one of the boats in Satur
day's regatta.
