George Klaarman, who hue been
an official in past intercollegiate
field-dayß and who will give his
services at the meet of the Stanford
Interscholastic Athletic Association
to be held on March 24th, yesterday
expressed himself as follows: "The
track and field meet which will he
held a week from next Saturday
under the auspices of the Inter
scholastic Athletic Association of
Stanford University will have the
largest list of entries of any such
meet ever held in the State of Cali
fornia." As Klaarman takes great
interest in track athletics, himself
holding the indoor record of the
Olympic Athletic Club of San
Francisco for 600 yards at 1:26 2-5,
and is brought in contact with
athletes all over the state through
his connection with a prominent
knitting and sporting goods house
of San Francisco, he knows whereof
he speaks. The semi-annual meet
of the Academic Athletic League
has heretofore been the leader in
number of entries, with over one
hundred contestants; so, on account
of the vastly greater number of
schools competing, it is probable
that the local interscholastic meet
will approach the two hundred
mark.
Definite acceptances have been
received from several of the men
asked to act as officials. William
Greer Harrison, president of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco,
who has taken an active interest
in athletics on the Pacific Coast for
the past thirty years, will be referee
of the meet. The starter will be
Phil Wand, also of the Olympic
Club. He has been starter in
several intercollegiate meets and a
number of those held by the Pacific
Athletic Association. O. F. Snedi
gar, captain, and Gilbert Neigh
bor, a broad-jumper of the Uni
versity of California track team,
will act as officials.
The Sigma Sigma cup and the
Bittner relay trophy are finished
and will be on exhibition to
morrow in the window of Shreve &
Co. of San Fraticisco. The Stan
ford University cup offered by W.
H. B. Fowler, '06, and the individual
cup offered by the Encina Club,
will be completed Friday. All of
the cups will then be shipped to
the Interscholastic Association and
exhibited in a window on the
quad. The medals, which will be
gold for first place, silver for sec
ond, and bronze for third, are valued
at $16.50 a set. They will bear
the Palo Alto tree and the German
motto of the University. Around
the edge in raised red enamel will
be the name "Interscholastic Ath
letic Association of Stanford Uni
versity." On the reverse will be
engraved the name of the event in
which the medal was won, the name
of the winner, the time or the dis
tance made, and the date. A spec

ial set of bronze medals will be
awarded to the members of the
winning relay team. Lowell, Lick
and Oakland high schools lire plan
ning to send large delegations of
rooters to the meet to cheer on the
representatives of their respective
schools. If necessary to acommo
date the crowd of spectators, an
other section of bleachers will be
moved from the Varsity diamond
and placed alongside those already
established at the track. A wire
will be stretched along the front of
the spectators' seats, as is d<>ne in
intercollegiate field meets. No one
will be allowed on the field besides
the contestants and officials.
The entertainment committee de
sires to gain full information in re
gard to intentions and arrange
ments for lodging the competing
athletes, and specially requests
that individuals in Palo Alto who
have invited athletes to stay with
them will give notice to that effect,
in accordance with a notice which
will be found in the announcement
column.
