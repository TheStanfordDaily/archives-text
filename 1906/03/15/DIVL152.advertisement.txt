THE BOOKSTORE
In expectation of moving into our new building in January we ordered a
stock of baseball and tennis goods. As we may not move into tbe new store
until the athletic season is nearly over, we have decided to display the new
stock as well as possible at the old store.
Students needing anything in the line of athletic goods are requested
to inquire at Tlic Kookstorc
