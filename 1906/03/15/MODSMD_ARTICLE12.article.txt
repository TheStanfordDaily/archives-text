The special attention of fraterni
ties and individuals is called to the
statement of the Interscholastic
Athletic Association in the an
nouncement column. The enter
tainment committee asks for the
names of all athletes who have ac
cepted invitations to stay with
fraternities or individuals during
their visit on the campus. This
information is wanted by Saturday
night, when entries for the meet
will close and assignments be made.
As outlined in its published plan a
week ago, the association purposes
to make the assignments upon the
most agreeable lines.
It seems hardly necessary to
point out the necessity of prompt
and hearty co-operation of the stu
dents with the committee in these
matters. The success of the com
ing meet depends as much on the
proper working out of the plan of
entertainment as on the smooth
running of the field meet itself. The
athletes will be the guests of the
men of the University, and there
must be no hitches. The problem to
be met by the entertainment com
mittee is a new one and not easy, but
cordial support in every way will
help materially in its solution.
