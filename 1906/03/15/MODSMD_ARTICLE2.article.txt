# "CHAPARRAL" OUT TO-MORROW
## Will Comment on Restriction of the Press and Contain Much Matter of Interest. 
### 
The Chaparral will appear to
morrow, containing much matter
of unusual interest. The editorials
are particularly strong and deal
with college concerns in a timely
way. One "Now That" comments
upon the censorship of the local
press, and is considered of suffi
cient importance to be accorded
the prominence of first place over
the others, which respectively re
gard the lack of sanitary drainage
on the campus, the baseball spirit
of the college, and the presence of
the bovine kind on the land near
the shores of Lagunita.
The front-page poem is by L. S.
Levy, '08, and lias for its subject
the connection of the much-cele
brated green with St. Patrick's
Day. Humorous articles on the
Stanford Interscholastic Athletic
Association and an examination
by an up-to-date college professor
are the chief prose features. Sally
Sharpe contributes the Society
Notes, in which Madrono Hall
figures prominently. A Tam o'-
Shanter girl drawn by E. E. Horo
witz, '06, occupies a full page.
Other art work is done by R. E.
Snodgrass,'ol, J. J. Sheehy, '06,
D. H. Ferry, '08, and M. J. Hel
mick, '09.
