# WILL REVISE CONSTITUTION.
## Executive Committee Will Propose Changes to Student Body.—"Gridiron” Not Considered. 
### 
At a regular weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee held last
night C. F. Laumeisler, '07, J. C.
Macfarland, '07, and R. W. Bar
rett, '04, chairman, were appointed
a committee to revise the constitu
tion of the student body.
This is a formal, annual proceed
ing. The Executive Committee
proposes changes in the constitu
tion each year to the student body
for consideration at their annual
meeting in the spring. A peculiar
situation holds now, however, which
may necessitate considerable
changes. Last year certain revis
ions were proposed, particularly
in respect to the management of
the Guild. These propositions were
finally passed in such an amended,
confused form that they were never
embodied in the printed copy of
the constitution. In consequence
student body affairs have been con
ducted this year under the old
unamended provisions. These cor
rections must now be finally de
termined and several additional
changes made which seem to be
necessary. The whole constitution
as revised will beHubmitted to the
student body meeting soon to be
held.
The Executive Committee ex
pected to be asked last night to
consider the erection of a gridiron
on the stage in Assembly Hall, but
since no member of Sword and San
dals, which is agitating the propo
sition, was present, the matter was
laid on the table indefinitely.
