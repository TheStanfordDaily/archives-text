# Many Warning Cards Are Issued.
## 
### 
The last of the warning cards
from the Faculty Scholarship Com
mittee will he mailed hy to-morrow
morning. Fifty-five were issued in
more than one subject. This num
ber exceeds that of last year by
seven. Six were suspended, which
is an increase of two over last year.
Many were warned in single sub
jects, but the full list has not been
completed. The increase in the
number of delinquents may be ac
counted for by the fact that due to
the new system instituted at the be
ginning of last semester by which
an entrant had only to make a
small portion of his registered units
many were allowed to return on
probation who have not kept up to
the standard.
