# TO REFORM SPELLING
## ANDREW CARNEGIE WILL FINANCE GIANT SCHEME. Board Appointed to Simplify English Orthography.â€”Stanford Professors Are Members. 
### 
Andrew Carnegie, the famous
capitalist, has undertaken to hear
the expense of a great reform, in
the simplification of English spell
ing. An organization including
prominent men of affairs and lead
ing men of letters has been formed
to carry the proposed reform into
practical use. Stanford is repre
sented on the hoard by President
Jordan, Professor Hem pel, the newly
appointed head of the German de
partment, and Professor James,
acting head of the department of
Philosophy.
The Simplified Spelling Board is
the result of an effort made by
hundreds of English speaking
people to have the simplified spell
ings, adopted by the National Edu
cational Association some years
ago, brought into general use. By
remedying the illogical spelling,
which is now the greatest draw
back to the adoption of English as
the great world language, the board
hopes to be able to aid the rapid
spread of the Anglo-Saxon tongue.
The board does not advocate
change merely for the sake of
change. It does not intend to make
any violent alterations in the ap
pearance of familiar works. It
only desires to do away by slow de
grees with the present cumbrous
orthography, and to introduce
also simpler and more phonetic
forms.
The immediate activities of the
board will be directed by an execu-*
tive committee chosen from the
members residing in New York.
From that committee the educa
tional campaign will be conducted
by a competent staff. Local so
cieties will be organized wherever
groups of willing workers can be
gathered together. The full per
sonnel of the board is as follows:
