# WILL PLAY SOLDIERS
## VARSITY MEETS FORT McDOWELL NINE TO-MORROW. Alameda State League Team Unable to Come.â€”Presley May Not Be in Game. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon at 2:30 the
Varsity will meet another soldier
team, from Fort McDowell on Han
Francisco Bay. Manager Barrett
had originally scheduled a game
with the Alameda State League
nine, but the professionals wired
him yesterday that they would be
unable to come down. The game
with the soldiers was scheduled at
once to fill the place of the post
poned contest, and nothing is
known regarding the strength of
their team. G. J. Presley, '07, who
has been playing first base on the
Varsity, is laid up with a badly in
jured thumb, and may not be able
to play in to-morrow's game. In
that case his place will be filled by
shifting Owen to first, Dudley to
center-field, and playing Cadwala
der in right. The probable line-up
of the Varsity follows;
Sales, Theile, p; Stott, Daily, c;
Owen, Presley, 1 b; Bell, 2b; Fen
ton, 3b; Sampson, ss; Chalmers, If;
Dudley, cf; Cadwalader, rf.
