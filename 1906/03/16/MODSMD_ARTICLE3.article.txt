# BRILLIANT SPEECHES AT ASSEMBLY
## Noted Professors Talk Before Student Body on California, Football, and University Ideals. 
### 
Three distinguished American
educators addressed the student
body at the third Assembly of the
semester, held this morning in
Assembly Hall. The speakers were
President Remsen of Johns Hop
kins University, Professor Car
penter of Columbia, and Dean
West of Princeton, all of whom
represent their universities at the
present session of the Association
of American Universities. Presi
dent Van Hise of Wisconsin was
on the platform but did not speak.
President Jordan introduced Dr.
Remsen as the first speaker and
asked him to give his impressions
of California. Dr. Remsen said in
part:
"As to the effect of California on
the Eastern mind, 1 can only say
that the mind ceases to operate!
I am dumbfounded at all that I
have seen. I thought that in the
past I had been living, but I find
that I have not. On viewing Cali
fornia and Stanford I have dis
covered what a university ought to
be as regards material surround
ings, and I do not want to have my
university mentioned here. You
could put our buildings into your
Inner Quadrangle. What we need
is elbow room and of that you have
plenty here."
Professor Carpenter then spoke
on the recent action of Columbia
in abolishing football. He said in
part: "The radical action taken by
the Columbia faculty may require
some explanation. The faculty did
not abolish football but did abolish
the game as it is now played.
They saw clearly that the present
game was sadly in need of better
ment. I know that conditions on
the Coast are cleaner than they are
in the East. Football there has

become an obsession. We saw
that it had developed into a verit
able gladiatorial combat. All the
attendant evils of the game —train-
ing table, professional coaches and
great gate receipts — were wrong,
and we felt that we should let the air
of righteousness in to clean Augean
stables. We desire all students to
participate in athletics, and we
have secured permission of the city
of New York to build a giant ath
letic field on piles into the stream
of the Hudson. We believed that
the faculty should put their hands
down hard against the present
game and then that some day a
game would come of which they
could approve."
The last speaker was Dean West
of Princeton. He said in part:
"I feel despondent over the awful
revelation just made of the con
ditions of Columbia football.
I believe football ought to be
a gentlemanly game, but I do
not believe that it should be made
into a ladylike game. But that is
another story. lam very glad to
be here and 1 desire to say a few
words to you on what seems to me
of vital interest to university men.
I plead for the preservation of indi
vidualism arid for the democracy
of student life and ideals. The
true glory of university studentship
is to have a clean heart and a clear
head. Let us burn our colleges if
we are going to hold our college
men as cxmiething apart. The three
ideals of college standards should
be culture, success and loyalty.
Culture is the making of a perfect
engine for life, success is the mo
tive power, and fidelity is the run
ning on the straight track."
Before the speeches the orchestra
played.
