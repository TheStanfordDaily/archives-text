# PLANS FOR RE-UNIONS
## SENIOR WEEK COMMITTEE ADOPTS NEW CUSTOM. Class of 1906 Will Attempt to Establish a Precedent by Arranging a Series of Reunions. 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior Week
| Committee last evening a plan was
brought forward for a series of re
unions to be held by the classes af
ter graduation. As carried out at
Yale, where these reunions have
been the most successful,each grad
| uating class appoints a permanent
class secretary, with a fund to
cover expenses, to have charge of
the reunions.
Three years after graduation
each class returns for its first re
union, and three years later for the
. second. After the first two returns
periods of five years are allowed to
j elapse before the next return. The
returning classes are guests of the
Senior class and for a period of five"
days make merry in memory of
I their former college days.
The Senior Week Committee
voted to adopt this system for the
Class of 1906, and also to recom
mend it to the three other classes
in the University and those already
graduated. To give some definite
start to the movement, the present
Senior class will invite the classes
of 1895, 1900, and 1903 to return
this year and thus establish a pre
cedent in this direction.
The Senior Week Committee ap
pointed the following committee to
further investigate the plan and to
invite the classes of 1895, 1900,
and 1903 to return for the first of
1 the proposed reunions: Miss H. C.
Hetherington, Mies I. C. Dille, Miss
G. B. Weaver, A. C. Freeman, A.
i N. Lewis, Jr., H. I. Cruzan, chair-
I man.
This committee met this after
noon and appointed a sub-commit
tee composed of H. I. Cruzan, A.C.
j Freeman and A. N. Lewis, Jr., to
confer with the under classes con
! cerning the new plan. The presi
dents of the under classes will ap
i point committees to meet to-mor
! row at 1 o'clock, to confer with
| this sub-committee concerning per
manent plans for the reunions.
The duty of looking up the
members of the classes who are
to be invited baa been divided
among the members of the commit
tee. A circular letter will be sent
to the alumni fully explaining the
proposed system of reunions and
asking their co-operation.
Beeides this plan for systematic
1 reunions the Senior Week Commit
tee listened to reports from the
chairmen of the various commit
tees. The finances of the 1906
class are in especially good condi
tion and an assessment of $2 00
will be sufficient to carry the class
through the festivities of Senior
Week.
An attempt is being made by the
Senior Ball Committee to obtain
the use of the dance hall in the new
gymnasium for their final dance.
President Jordan has expressed
himself as willing if the matter
can be adjusted with the Board of
Trustees and the contractors.
