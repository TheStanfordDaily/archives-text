The Clans of 1906 has taken the
first steps in the promotion of a
custom which it will be the priv
ilege and duty of the under classes
to adopt and establish before they
leave the University. The scheme
as proposed by the present Senior
class calls for a reunion each year
of the two classes which have grad
uated three and six years before,
and of the classes every five years
previous to that time. The class
of 1911, for example, will invite
the classes of 1908, 1905, 1900 and
1895, each successive class follow
ing out this general plan. By this
svstem the classes will assemble
every five years after the first two
reunions. The classes will return
upon invitation of the graduating
class and will be the guests of the
fourth-year students to the extent
that the Seniors will provide a
week's amusement and entertain
ment for the visiting alumni.
This is a most admirable plan,
as is gives the classes an oppor
tunity of visiting the University
under favorable circumstances at
intervals of five years, and of spend
ing one week with classmates,
other alumni and undergraduates.
The scheme is meritorious from
the point of view that it will fos
ter clasß spirit, and bring into
closer contact all the members of
each class. It will afford them
a chance of meeting fellow class
mates amidst old Bcenes, and will
refreshen the memories of under
graduate days. Under the pro
posed system a returning alumnus
will visit the University with the
assurance that he will be met by
old familiar faces and not by a
host of strange younger brothers
and sisters. He will look forward
to these reunions with the keenest
delight because he has the solemn
assurance that there will he gath
ered many of the men and women
of his class with whom he spent

his four happiest years. It will not
be with a sense of longing that he
will walk about the scenes of his
triumphs and trials, searching in
vain for a familiar face. It is
perhaps this consideration more
than any other that should occupy
the attention - and claim the con
sideration of the studentß cailed
upon to accept or reject the plan.
