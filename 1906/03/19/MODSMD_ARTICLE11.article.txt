## Report that President Jordan Has Been Selected as Honorary Head of Pasadena Institution. 
### 
A report from Los Angeles that
Dr. Jordan has consented to as
sume the duties of honorary presi
dent of a $1,000,000 college for wo
men at Pasadena was published in
the San Francisco papers to-day.
The college, according to the re
port, will soon be erected, and Mrs.
J. J. Johnson, a Colorado woman,
who is one of the prime movers in
the project, will leave for New
York, as soon as she procures an
official statement from the trustees,
to take advantage of certain chan
nels now open in the matter of an
endowment fund.
No definite information in regard
to the report could he obtained
from the President's office to-day,
but when showed the article the
secretary stated in an unofficial
way that "the natural inference to
be drawn after reading such a re
port is that it is nonsense." Dr.
Jordan could not be seen, so no
further information was obtaina
ble.
