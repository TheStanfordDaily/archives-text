# Professor Terry Declines Offer.
## 
### 
President Jordan received a tele
gram last week from Professor R,
B. #erry, of Harvard, declining the
offer made him sometime ago of be
coming the head of the Philosophy
department at Stanford. This
information was secured from an
authoritative source.
A well founded rumor has it that
Stanford had but little hopes of
securing Perry since President
Eliot had declared outspokenly
that he considered Perry such a
valuable man he intended to
retain him at any cost. From
the same source it is learned that
Dr. Jnrdon has two other Harvard
men in view for the department. The
Daily Palo Alto surmises that
perhaps theP resident's Eastern trip
in the near future may be incident
ally for the purpose of securing one
or the other of these men.
