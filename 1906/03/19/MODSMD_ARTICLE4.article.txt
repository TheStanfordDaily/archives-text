# SOPHOMORE CREW WINS
## 1908 FOUR MAKES FAST TIME IN INTERCLASS REGATTA. Races Are Delayed by Many Accidents.—Course Is Shortened Because of Rough Weather. 
### 
The Sophomore crew won the
interclass regatta on the Redwood
slough last Saturday. Against both
the Freshmen and the Juniors, the
1908 four jumped to the lead at the
start, and were never headed, de
feating the former by two and the
latter by five lengths.
The regatta proved one of vexa
tious delays. Owing to a break in
the machinery the launch with the
borrowed California barge did not
arrive at the slough until 12 o'clock
and then went aground about a
mile from the boat-house. It was
three o'clock before the first heat
was started —five hours after the
scheduled time.
The underclassmen met in the
first contest. The day was cold,
with a raw wind and a choppy sea,
so the course was shortened to about
three quarters of a mile. The
Sophomores caught the water first,
and rapidly swung ahead, there be
ing clear water between the boats
in the first hundred yards. After
a little bad splashing at the start,
the Freshmen steadied and rowed
a strong race, but were unable to
catch their opponents, who crossed
the line about two lengths ahead.
The time was 4 minutes and 20 se
conds.
The Seniors defaulted to the
Juniors because of the lateness of
the hour and the breaking of
a seat in the Junior boat, which
was not fixed until 5 o'clock.
The Sophomore and the Junior
crews were sent away by Starter
Murphy at 5:15. As in the first
heat, the 1908 four caught the
water first and pulled away from
their opponents with ease. At the
half mile mark they had a lead of
three lengths, the boat running
smoothly with no spray from the
sculls. Coxswain Turner sent his
men hard over the final quarter
mile, and the winning crew crossed
the line five lengths ahead of the
Juniors, having covered the course
in the fast time of 4 minutes and
14 seconds.
The make up of the 1908 crew
was the same as that of last year,
when, as the Freshman crew, they
carried the Cardinal to victory in
the three-cornered regatta at Se
attle.
The summary of Saturday's re
gatta is as follows:
First heat. —Sophomores defeated
Freshmen by two lengths. Time,
4:20.
Second heat.—Seniors defaulted
to Juniors.
Final heat. — Sophomores de
feated Juniors by fivelengths. Time,
4:14.
Officials.— Starter, Coach Mur
phy; judge of the finish, Professor
