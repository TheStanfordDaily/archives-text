### 
In a meet which was marked by
some high class performances, in
spite of the unfavorable weather
conditions, the Freshmen defeated
the Bay Counties League athletes
Saturday morning by the score of
71* to 49i W. M. Rawles, '09,
was again the star of the Fresh
man team, and when he beat Hus
sey, '09, and Crabtree of Lick, in
52.3 he ran the fastest quarter
that has been seen here this season.
His work in the 100 and '220 yard
dashes and the broad jump was
also high class. The two mile went
to Garvin and Myers, of Lowell,
without a struggle, as Fergusson,
'09, was in no condition. In the
half mile the visitors took three
places with Maundrel and Smith
of Lowell, and Williston of Wil
merding, but aside from these two
races the Freshmen took places in
every event.
H. R. Stolz, '09, Lieb of Lowell,
and Rawles, '09, did better than 20
feet 9 inches in the broad jump,
Stolz winning at 20 feet 11 inches.
The shot-put was also a feature of
the meet, W. K. Ford, '09, winning
with a put of 40 feet 8 inches. In
the 100 yard dash Rawles, '09, and
Holman, '09, tiedin 10.2, with Gol
cher a close third. The surprise of
the day was the defeat of Maun
drell, the Lowell miler, by Ball of
Berkeley High, a new man who
put up a great sprint at the finish
and won in 4:46.2. On account of
the poor condition of the take-off
the high jump was won at a low
figure, and Griffiths, the Lick pole
vaulter, also fell below his usual
mark. Oakland High School was

the Bay Counties League athletes
Saturday morning by the score of
71* to 49i W. M. Rawles, '09,
was again the star of the Fresh
man team, and when he beat Hus
sey, '09, and Crabtree of Lick, in
52.3 he ran the fastest quarter
that has been seen here this season.
His work in the 100 and '220 yard
dashes and the broad jump was
also high class. The two mile went
to Garvin and Myers, of Lowell,
without a struggle, as Fergusson,
'09, was in no condition. In the
half mile the visitors took three
places with Maundrel and Smith
of Lowell, and Williston of Wil
merding, but aside from these two
races the Freshmen took places in
every event.
H. R. Stolz, '09, Lieb of Lowell,
and Rawles, '09, did better than 20
feet 9 inches in the broad jump,
Stolz winning at 20 feet 11 inches.
The shot-put was also a feature of
the meet, W. K. Ford, '09, winning
with a put of 40 feet 8 inches. In
the 100 yard dash Rawles, '09, and
Holman, '09, tiedin 10.2, with Gol
cher a close third. The surprise of
the day was the defeat of Maun
drell, the Lowell miler, by Ball of
Berkeley High, a new man who
put up a great sprint at the finish
and won in 4:46.2. On account of
the poor condition of the take-off
the high jump was won at a low
figure, and Griffiths, the Lick pole
vaulter, also fell below his usual
mark. Oakland High School was
not represented in the meet. A
