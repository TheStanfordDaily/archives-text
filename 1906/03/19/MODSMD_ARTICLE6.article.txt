ling gold ore which revolutionized

tablish his invention. While in
the mining regions he became in
volved in some trouble which final
ly led to his being shot just at the
time when an old friend of his, who
is closely connected with the plot
of the story, arrived at the mining
town in which Darrell stayed. It
is a strong story and is particular
ly well written. Beymer,the author
of the story, is now studying art in

er and an artist. He was a mem
ber of the Sequoia staff and also be
