A fifth cup has been presented
to the Interscholastic Athletic Asso
ciation to he awarded to the prepar
atory school winning second place
in the meet here next Saturday
under the rules of that association.
Such a cup has long been desired
by the Board of Directors of the
association, and the gift of the
trophy by a generous outsider
comes as a pleasant bit of news.
Upon several previous occasions
Mr. Thiele has shown himself a
warm friend of student interests
and his public spiritedness and
generosity at this time are a further
evidence of his good will and in
