# TRUSTEES WILL DECIDE.
## Question of Granting Gymnasium for Senior Ball Before Executive Board. 
### 
The Board of Trustees will decide
at the next meeting on March 31st
whether the Senior class may use
the new gymnasium for their ball.
Treasurer Lathrop has referred the
matter to the hoard for final decis
ion. Architect C. E. Hodges is
preparing a statement of the con
dition of the building which he will
submit to the trustees, and theclass
committee will present their peti
tion at the same time.
So far as can he learned no harm
will come to the floor from using it
now, but the objection to granting
the request will probably be that if
the gymnasium is used now legal
complications with the contractors
may ensue.
The ball committee estimates
that tickets can be sold cheaper if
the dance is held in the gymnasium,
since no decoration will be neces
sary and more people will attend.
