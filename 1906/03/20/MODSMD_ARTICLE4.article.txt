# ALUMNI WILL REUNITE
## NEW SYSTEM RECOMMENDED BY JOINT COMMITTEES. Classes of 1896, 1901 and 1904 Will Be Guests of 1906 This Year.—New Scholarship Fund Discussed. 
### 
At a meeting of the Permanent
Alumni Organization Committees
to-day a system of alumni re
unions, and the establishment of a
scholarship fund, were recommend
ed for adoption by the classes. The
reunion system decided upon differs
from the one originally suggested
in that a class will unite two years
after graduation. The next meet
ing will be held three years later,
or five years from graduation.
From that time on reunions will be
held every five years.
This arrangement was made in
order that the Class of 1896 might
meet this year as they had
planned. The Class of 1895 would,
according to the original plan, meet
this year, but, as their reunion was
held last commencement, it was not
deemed practicable to issue invi
tations for an assembly immediate
ly following last year's one. This
change will bring back the classes
of 1896, 1901 and 1904 this year as
guests of 1906, instead of the classes
of 1895, 1900 and 1903.
Besides the system of reunions a
new scholarship fund was suggested
and decided upon. This fund will
be begun by the turning over of the
permanent class secretary's fund to
a trustee upon the death of the
members of the class. The perma
nent secretary is supplied with
funds from the interest on a cer
tain sum of money placed in trust
each year of undergraduate work
by a class. The principal remains
untouched throughout the life of
the class, and as the interest will
more than cover the expenses of
the secretary, the fund will be of
quite considerable proportions at
the end of forty or fifty years.
This fund, when placed in the
hands of a trustee, will draw inter
est, which will be used, when it
amounts to enough, to put a chos
en student through the University.
As class upon class adds its fund
to the scholarship deposit more
and more men can be supported
through a college course. This
new scholarship will be known as
the "Stanford Alumni Scholarship
Fund."
The committees which represent
ed the classes were composed of the
following men: Freshmen —1). 11.
Walker, D. W. Burbank, .J. K.
Hutchinson; sophomore — D. 11.
Ferry, E. J. Hadlej', W. C. Thiele;

The recommendations adopted
follow:
"The Joint Committees appoint
ed by presidents of the present
classes of Stanford University, for
the purpose of effecting a scheme
of permanent class organization,
and to unite the alumni and the
University on a more firm basis, do
recommend the following:
