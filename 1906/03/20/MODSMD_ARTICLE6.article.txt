# ANOTHER TRACK MEET
## COACH HOLMES WILL BRING TEAM. Varsity Will Compete with an All Southern California Team on Junior Day. 
### 
Manager Barrett has arranged a
meet between an all-Southern Cali
fornia team and the Varsity for
March 30th. This was the date
that had been reserved for the
Olympic Club athletes, but owing
to some difficulty in obtaining a
team Captain Koeenfeld of the
Olympic Club asked Manager Bar
rett to cancel the date. Now that
the Southern California meet has
been arranged for, the club has
straightened out its internal diffi
culties and wants to schedule a
meet. Manager Barrett is trying
to arrange a date for the Olympic
Club men. If a meet is arranged
it will probably be held on the
morning of April 7th, the day of
the first intercollegiate baseball
game. There is considerable likeli
hood that the interclass meet will
be run during the spring vacation
as Manager Barrett is unable to
find a suitable date before the
intercollegiate meet.
