Every year it becomes necessary
to inform the Freshmen that at
Stanford such petty tricks as the
stealing of Sophomore hats are not
tolerated. Class traditions are
looked upon as something to be
respected, and the unsophisticated
Freshman who has not been im
pressed with this fact by this time is
in need of an education that is not
given in the class-rooms. A class
hat as well as any other headgear
left in the Library or in any Uni
versity building should be and
must be regarded as absolutely safe
until the owner recovers it. When
conditions are such that Freshmen
remove Sophomore hats without re
turning them and retain them as
souvenirs, it is high time for classes
to make investigations and to punish
the offenders.
