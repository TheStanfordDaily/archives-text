# Freshman "Bogie" Comes Out.
## 
### 
At an early hour this morning
numerous copies of a freshman
"bogie" were scattered over the
campus and Palo Alto. The un
known authors indulged in a score
or more of "knocks," varying in
length and strength, upon certain
members of the Freshman Class.
The "bogie" was unusually well
printed upon one sheet of yellow
paper, but most of the jokes were
not cleverly written, and the publi
cation's neat appearance was vir
tually its one redeeming feature.
