# "Chaparral" Issues Good Number.
## 
### 
The current number of the
Chaparral is a praiseworthy issue.
The poeni entitled "Loyal to Green"
is timely, up-to-date, and due in
its references to St. Patrick's Day.
The editorials express the truth in
regard to some changes which may
be made in college conditions. The
drawings and jokes are profii√üe
and of good quality. The prose
articles are, on the whole, amusing.
Those persons who were fortunate
enough to obtain Sally Sharpe's
"Society Gossip" were forced to
borrow a neighbor's magazine in
order to read the post-office notices
on page one hundred and seventy.
