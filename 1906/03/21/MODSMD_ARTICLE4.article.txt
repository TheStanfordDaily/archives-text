# PLATE COMMITTEE MEETS.
## Seniors Decide to Insert Numerals in Irregular Square. 
### 
The Senior Plate Committee met
Friday afternoon and disposed! of
the difficulty presented by the
irregularity of the square in the
quad pavement which follows after
the 1905 plate. The next square
is cut diagonally in half by a
straight belt of cement which rune
transversely across the pavement
of the inner quad parallel with the
west side of the church. The com
mittee decided to allow the Senior
plate to lap over into this belt of
cement. It will be necessary to
cut off one corner of the 1906 plate
and also the contiguous corner of
that of 1907, as the bell of cement
is not quite wide enough to admit
the inner halves of these two con
tiguous plates, but the discrepancy
will in no way interfere with the
numerals of either 1906 or 1907.
