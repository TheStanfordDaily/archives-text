# SESSION AT MONTEREY
## SUMMER SCHOOL IN BIOLOGY TO OPEN IN JUNE. Five Hours University Credit Will Be Given for Six Weeks' Work at Pacific Grove. 
### 
Beginning Monday, June 4th,
1906, and continuing six weeks un
til July 14th, the Marine Biologi
cal Laboratory of Stanford will
hold its fifteenth session at Pacific
Grove. This Laboratory is an in
tegral part of the biological depart
ments of the University, and is
carried on entirely under their
! supervision.
Three classes of students are pro
vided for: First, those who have
never had any training in Botany
or Zoology but wish to take up
| work of an elementary character.
Laboratory work in conjunction
with lectures is provided for these
students. Besides, they receive in
dividual instruction at the work
table and make special studies on
the collecting grounds and in pre
servation of material. Drill in
laboratory methods of study, dis
secting, and use of the microscope
is taught.
The next class includes those ad
| vanced students in Zoology, Bot
| any and Physiology who wish to
1 take advantage of a well equipped
'marine laboratory for pursuing
' their studies. The last class com
' prises those investigators prepared
to carry on researches in Morphol
ogy and Physiology.
The corps of instructors is com
posed entirely of members of the
faculty. George C. Price of the
Zoology department, Clara C. Stol
tenberg of the Physiology depart
ment, and Harry B. Humphrey of
the Botany department, will have
charge of the instruction. Profes
for Price, who will have general
! supervision of the laboratory, has
been connected with the work at
Pacific Grove for several years.
' Last year, when the laboratory was
opened after having been conduct
ed on loose methods for two years,
Professor Price had charge of the
work, aud helped to restore the
laboratory to the position it had
held.
i Four courses of instruction will
be offered this summer. The first
is an elementary course in general
! Zoology under Professor Price, open
1 to all University students who de
sire to study the anatomy and life
history of marine animals, and the
methods pursued in laboratory
study. One lecture a day will be
given, the rest of the time being
spent in the laboratory and on the
collecting grounds. The next course,
|in Botany, will pay especial at
tention to the study of marine and
fresh-water algae, as to morphology
and distribution. An excursion
: along the coast for field study and
a lecture will take place every
week. The next is an advanced
course in Zoology, and aims to give
| students a wide general knowledge
jof marine forms. Special attention
will be given to the study of mater
ial collected both at low tide and
at the surface of the ocean. The
