# HEATS IN MORNING
## MANY ENTRIES IN INTERSCHOLASTIC EVENTS. Trials in Three Track Events and Three Field Events To Be Held Early. 
### 
Owing to the large number of
men entered in the interseholastic
meet for next Saturday, heats of
three races and preliminaries in
three field events will be held in
the morning, so that the finals and
regular events will afford unabated
interest for the afternoon. The
price of admission to the meet will
be fifty cents and tickets will be
sold at the track, to be good for all
day. The contestants will lunch
at 11:30 so as to have plenty of
time before the afternoon meet,
which will commence at 1:45 sharp.
The trials in the 440-yard dash, the
220-yard hurdles, and the 220-yard
dash, and the preliminaries in the
pole-vault, broad jump and ham
mer-throw will take place in the
forenoon. In every track event ex
cept the high hurdles, in which
twenty-three men will compete, the
number of entries exceeds that in
any field event. The middle dis
tances are the most popular, while
the fewest entries are in the weights,
the hammer-throw having fifteen
men entered and the shot-put six
teen. The four-forty and the half
mile have respectively forty and
thirty-two intending contestants.
Saturday morning four heats
with ten men in each will be run
off in the 440-yard dash, the first
four men in each heat qualifying
for the finals. The 220-vard hurd
les will have seven heats. Four
men will start in six and three in
the seventh, making twenty-seven
to compete in this event. The 220-
yard dash will be run in seven
heats, four men to a heat. The
hundred yard dash will have six
men in each and five heats. The
mile run has twenty-nine entries.
The 120-yard hurdles will have
four men in each of four beats, and
three in a fifth. In the field events,
after each man has had the regular
number of trials he must pass a
certain mark in order to qualify
for further competition. The high
and broad jumps have respectively
twenty-five and twenty-six entries
and the pole-vault twenty entries.
