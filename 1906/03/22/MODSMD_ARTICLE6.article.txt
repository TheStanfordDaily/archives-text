# NEVADA DEBATE PLANS
## SUBJECT AND DATE APPOINTED FOR SECOND TEAM DEBATE. Football Question Will Be Discussed with the Sagebrushers on the Campus May 5th. 
### 
The debate with the University
of Nevada will be held May sth
on the campus, and it will be on
the same subject as the big debate
with California in April. This
was recently determined by corres
pondence between the University
Debating Club and the Nevada
manager.
Nevada last year proposed the
subject, and consequently the priv
ilege fell to Stanford this time.
Thinking it would be beneficial to
have both intercollegiate debates
on the same subject, Stanford some
time ago submitted the football
question: "Resolved, That the
American game of football has
done more harm than good to the
ideals for which universities should
exist." Nevada elected to defend
the affirmative, and in consequence
Stanford's two teams are thrown
on opposite sides of the same ques
tion. This situation will prove of
great help because the squads can
hold practice debates against each
other and at the same time work
up their own cases and gain a
knowledge of the arguments which
may be advanced by their oppon
ents.
Judges have not jet been selected,
but several prominent men are be
ing considered for these positions.
