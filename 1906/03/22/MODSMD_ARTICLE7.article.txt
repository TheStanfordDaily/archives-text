# Rawles Is Freshman Captain.
## 
### 
The Freshman track athletes met
at the training shed this afternoon
and elected W. M. Rawles, the
speedy quarter-mile, to captain the
1909 team. Rawles came here with
a good reputation from Ukiah High
School and he has lived up to his
preparatory record. He is a very
fast man in the quarter and is also
expected to take points for the
Freshmen in the broad jump, 100-
and 220-yard dashes.
