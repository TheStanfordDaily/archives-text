# BAN DECLARED OFF
## PRESIDENT'S OFFICE WILL NO LONGER WITHHOLD NEWS. No Formal Agreement Made with Correspondents and Settlement Comes Unexpectedly Last Night. 
### 
The President's office has re
scinded its previous action by
which it refused to give out news
to the correspondents of the San
Francisco papers and to the Daily
Palo Alto. The ban is removed
without reservation and the news
paper men are placed on the same
basis with regard to the President
as that which they occupied before
the recent break. The action of
President Jordan comes as a com
plete surprise to the college jour
nalists. They had made absolute
ly no overtures looking toward a
settlement of the difficulty, and the
President's action was evidently
inspired by entirely external in
fluences.
The San Francisco correspon
dents and the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto were notified of the
change by a messenger from the
President's office, at a late hour
yesterday evening. They signed
no agreement and made no con
cessions. The removal of the ban
amounts, therefore, to a practical
resumption of the old state of af
fairs, with the journalists free to
get their news from the official
source.
The breaking of the deadlock re
lieves a tension of three weeks'
standing. Tuesday, February 27th,
the President's office announced
that no more news would be given
to the city correspondents or to the
Daily Palo Alto, until some agree
ment lie arrived at between the con
tending parties by which news
given out by the President's office
would not be misconstrued. The
direct causes for the trouble were
articles in the Daily Palo Alto in
which the President claimed that
the journalists had added inferences
of their own to official statements
given out by him. After this an
nouncement the President's office
positively refused to give any as
sistance in the business of news
gathering to the college journalists.
Matters remained thus without an
attempt at negotiations by either
side, until the sudden removal of
the prohibition last night.
