# PROSPECTS FOR MEET
## FEW POINTS WILL BE NEEDED TO WIN FIRST PLACE. Entries Are Capable of Good Records If Weather Conditions Permit. 
### 
From the number of men entered
in to-morrow's meet by the Califor
nia School of Mechanical Arte,
Santa Rosa High School, Lowell
High School and Oakland High
School who have shown themselves
to be capable athletes, and from
the records stated in the entry
blanks, it appears that the choice
for first place is to be made from
among these three schools. Weather
conditions, the number of schools
competing, and the scarcity of in
formation concerning the ability of
some teams, may upset all calcu
lations. Belmont School has seven
teen entries, but is an unknown
quantity. It is probable that
twenty points will win the meet
with ease. Individual men may
capture enough points to seriously
affect the result. Munn of Oak
land, Bellah of Hanford, and Tom
asini of Palo Alto have the best
chances for winning the Encina
Club cup. If Tomasini is not kept
out on account of sickness, there is
a possibility that he will break the
world's interscholastic record for
throwing the twelve-pound ham
mer. His present record is 18(5 feet,
which is one foot short of the re
cord.
The best time known of all con
testants in the 100-yard dash is
0:10.1, done by Gray on the fast
Santa Rosa track. McHenry of
Santa Clara College may show up
well in this event. These men,
with Buttgenbach of Lowell, Gol
cher of Lick, and Bellah of Han
ford, will be stars in the sprints.
Wallace of Ukiah, Crabtree of
Lick, and Wilson of Santa Rosa
have excellent records for places in
the quarter. If the track is in good
shape excellent records should be
made in the low hurdles and the
mile. In the former Bellah can do
26:2; in the latter Maundrell of
Lowell has a record of 4:38 4-5. In
the 880-yard run Johns of Lick,
Free of Oakland, and Maundrell of
Lowell should place. Boyd and
Kerr of San Jose and Leib of Low
ell are good high hurdlers.
Bellah and Munn can do over
eleven feet in the pole-vault, with
Vail of Oakland close up. In the
broad, Scott of Alameda, Leib of
Lowell, Le Veau of San Jose, and
Bellah should be among the lead
ers. Munn has the best mark in
the high jump, followed by many
men who can do 5 feet 6 inches
with ease. Holmes of Lick, Munn
and Tomasini should figure in the
shot-put. Ten relay teams have
entered. Of these, Lick, Oakland,
Lowell, Ukiah, Santa Rosa and
Harvard are worthy of considera
tion.
