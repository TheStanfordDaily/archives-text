The first field and track meet of
the Stanford University Inter
scholastic Athletic Association will
be held to-morrow. The meet prom
ises to surpass in all respects
anything of its kind ever held on
the Pacific Coast. The success of
this meet cannot be foretold, as the
plans of the association are still in
their infancy, and will only be
perfected with experience. The as
sociation hopes to bring together
each year preparatory school ath
letes whose standing will permit
them to register, and whose credit
able records will lend interest to
the meet. The athletes most de
sired and welcomed are the very
ones who are seldom factors in the
final result. The idea of the as
sociation is to get together men
who are bona fide preparatory
school students, even if they have
only fair records as athletes. The
ideals of the association are excel
lent. and the success of the meet
to-morrow will in a measure deter
mine the proficiency of the methods
employed in attaining these ideals.
