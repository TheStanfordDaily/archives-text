# REACH QUICK DECISION
## ADOPTION OF RUGBY BY CONFERENCE PURELY FORMAL. President Jordan and Dr. Angell Declare that Choice of English Game Is but Tentative. 
### 
The meeting of the Stanford-
California Football Conference yes
terday afternoon, which resulted in
the death of American football on
the Pacific Coast, was purely form
al; the real decision as to the game
to be played having been reached
when the sub-committee decided in
favor of Rugby. "The adoption of
the game recommended by the sub
committee was a foregone conclu
sion," declares Dr. Angell, chairman
of the Faculty Athletic Committee.
Dr. Angell also reiterated the
statement made by President Jor
dan last evening to the effect that
while the decision of the Stanford-
California Football Conference was
final as regarded the adoption of
Rugby for the present, the English
game would only be played here as
long as no American game exists
which meets the objections of the
conference.
In deciding upon a remedy for
the brutality in football the sub
committee found four possible solu
tions, as follows:
1. To adopt the Eastern Rules
Committee's modifications of the
present game.
2. To make new rules for the
game to be played on the Pacific
Coast.
3. To abolish intercollegiate foot
ball between Stanford and the Uni
versity of California.
4. To adopt the English game of
Rugby.
After prolonged discussion the
second and third solutions were
adjudged impractical. Because of
the indisposition of the Eastern
Committees to make any radical
changes in the game which was
played last year, it was finally de
cided to pay no more attention to
their efforts, but to recommend in
the report to the Conference the
adoption of the English Rugby
game.
The Conference was in session
but forty minutes yesterday after
noon, and the resolutions of
the sub-committee recommending
Rugby were adopted without dis
cussion. Nearly all of the time
was taken up by the reading of the
minutes of the meetings of the sub
committee, in order to give the
members of the Conference an idea
of the discussions which took place
before the resolutions were finally
drawn up.
Both Coach J. F. Lanagan, '00,
and Captain E. P. Stott, '07, refus
ed to give their opinion of the
action of the Conference in adopt
ing the Rugby game. Ex-Captain
A.J.Chalmers, '07, says: "It was
Rugby or nothing. I know there
is a general sentiment among
the football men at Stanford
against Rugby, and I heartily
concur with that sentiment. I am
opposed to Rugby, but when it
comes to a choice of Rugby or
nothing, I will support the English
game."
