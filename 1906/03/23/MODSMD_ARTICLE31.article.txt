ing the club was formally organized
and the following officers were

and J. E. McDowell, '00, treasurer.
These three officers will make up
the executive board of the club.
Minor matters, such as time of
meeting and dues, have not yet
been decided.
The club will be divided for the
purposes of work into seven groups,
as follows: 1. Social Problems. 2.
Social Settlements and Betterment.
3. Political Science. 4. Boys' Clubs.
5. Collections — money, clothes,
magazines. 6. Correspondence. 7.
Educational work among the poor.
The first section will consider
social problems of all sorts, and
the second, social settlements and
their betterment here and else
where. The third will study
political conditions, particularly
of this state. The work of the
fourth, fifth and sixth will be
of a more pratical nature —money,
clothing, and magazines will be
collected.
Boys' clubs will be established
where there is need of them, and
correspondence with Stanford settle
ment workers in the counties will
be kept up. The last section will
take up a study of the relation
of education to social work. The
sections will meet separately and
each will have its own officers, but
they will report at the regular
meetings of the club as a whole,
with papers for discussion.
Dr. Gardner opened the meeting
with an address, in which he pointed
out the need and use of such a club
here, and its purposes, which are
in a general way to present the
ideal of social service to the stu
dents, and to study social problems
and conditions with a view to their
betterment hereafter. Addresses
in reference to the work were also
made by Mrs Milllis, VV. Y.
Wentz, '06. K. A. Bickel, '07, H. L.
