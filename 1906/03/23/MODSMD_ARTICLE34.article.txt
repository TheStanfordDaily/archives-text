# CENSURE TREASURER LATHROP
## Fish Commissioners Demand That University Treasurer Rectify Fracture of State Laws. 
### 
Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop
has come into contact with the
Santa Clara County Fish Commis
sioners, and has been ordered to
either immediately remove his
numerous irrigation dams on San
Francisquito creek, or else to put
fish ladders in these obstructions.
At the instigation of several local
sportsmen Fish Commissioner H.
W. Semichy of Portola has investi
gated the complaint that the trout,
which were planted in the creek
several years ago, could not reach
the headwaters of the stream to
spawn, and therefore were dying
off. Semichy found that Lathrop's
dams were unsurmountable ob
stacles for the fish, and he sent im
mediate notice to the treasurer, de
manding that instant care be
taken of the matter, and stating
that Lathrop had seriously violated
the fish laws of the state.
"Frequent complaints by fisher
men in this vicinity in regard to
the dams putin by Lathrop caused
the investigation," said Commis
sioner Semichy. "The dams were
unlawful, as they prevented spawn
ing fish from reaching the head
waters of the creek. Fish ladders
will have to he installed by La
throp.
