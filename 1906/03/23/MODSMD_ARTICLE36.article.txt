# Dennis Will Test Refrigerator Cars.
## 
### 
Instructor S. J. Dennis, of the
department of Michanical Engi
neering, left last night for River
side where he will remain for sev
eral days making measurements
and tests of refrigerator cars for
shipping fruit. For some years the
United States Department of Agri
culture has been making investiga
tions in Southern California with
reference to the most efficient meth
od of shipping fruit to the Eastern
market. Recently the department
of Mechanical Engineering at Stan
ford was called upon for assistance,
and it was in response to this re
quest that Instructor Dennis has
gone to Riverside.
