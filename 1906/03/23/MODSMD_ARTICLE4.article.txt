# YOUNG ATHLETES MEET ON TRACK
## State Preparatory Schools Send Teams for Biggest Athletic Event of California. 
### 
To-morrow at 1:45 o'clock, on the
University oval, the greatest aca
demic track and field meet ever
held in the state of California will
start —a contest that is first in the
size of the entry list, unique in the
scope of the geographical area from
which the participants are drawn,
largest in the value and beauty of
the trophies to be competed for, and
pre-eminent in the field of prepar
atory school athletics on the Pacific
Coast —the initial annual meet of
the Stanford University Interscho
laßtic Athletic Association.
One hundred and sixty-eight en
tries out of a total of twenty-three
schools, coupled with the fact that
there is no limit on the number of
events in which a man may com
pete, has necessitated the extension
of the meet over the whole day.
Tickets will be sold at fifty cents
and will be good for both morning
and afternoon. In the forenoon,
the four trials in the 440-yard dash,
the seven in the22o yard dash, and
the seven in the 220-yard low hur
dles will be run off. The first four
men in each heat of the 440
will qualify to run in the final. On
account of the turn and the nar
rowness of the track, only four men
can run abreast in the 220-yard
dash and low hurdles. In order to
reduce the number of men who will
compete in the finals in these races,
it will be necessary to run semi
finals. The first and second men
in each preliminary heat will qual
ify for the semi-finals, in which
fourteen men will be distributed

among four heats. Preliminaries
iti three field events —the pole-vault,
broad jump and hammer-throw—
will also he held in the morning.
A qualification will he set for the
finals. The morning contests will
he over early enough so that all
athletes may lunch at 11:30, which
hour will afford ample time for
rest and preparation for the after
noon meet.
Commencing at 1:45 sharp, the
events will follow each other in the
intercollegiate order without a stop
until the victorious relay-runner
has crossed the tape. All track
events except the 100-yard dash,
in which five heats with six men
each will he run, will he finished
in one race. Places will count re
spectively five points, three points
and one point, with the exception
of the relay, the result of which
will not figure in the final score of
the meet in order not to give large
teams an advantage over those of
few men. There will he no two
mile race.
The interscholastic field day will
be the most comprehensive academ
ic meet ever held in California.
The representatives of the Harvard
School of Los Angeles, and the
Thacher School of Nordhoff, Ven
tura county, will compete with the
teams from Ukiah High School of
Mendocino county and the institu
tions of secondary education in
San Francisco, the bay counties,
and various other parts of the
state.


The Stanford University Cup
Presented by W. 11. B. Fowler, '0(1
Speaking in regard to the five
cups to be awarded by the Inter
scholastic Association, Trainer
"Dad" Moulton said yesterday:
"They are the finest set of cups
ever offered for any meet in the
United States —the most expensive
and the best in every way." The
medals are equally to be prized.
The outlook is bright that to-mor
row's interscholastic meet will
eclipse any other such contest ever
held west of the Rocky Mountains.
