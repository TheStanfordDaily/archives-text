# ALLEN IS REINSTATED
## STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE RESTORES DEPOSED EDITOR. Man Who Criticised Faculty Policy Can Return to University Without Apology or Retraction. 
### 
"The suspension of Mr. B. S. Al
len from the University has been
terminated by the Committee on
Student Affairs. This is based up
on a petition from Mr. Allen and
upon assurances from him that he
will not place hinmelf in opposition
to the constituted authorities of the
LI ni versity
This official announcement from
the Committee on Student Affairs
was made public this afternoon.
It conies as the result of several
meetings of the committee held
during the past three weeks which
culminated in a final session this
morning. At this session the
official action was taken.
When Allen was suspended on
February sth for his editorials in
the Daily Palo Alto criticising
the authorities, it was understood
by the committee that he would be
permitted to return at the expira
tion of a short period, if he so
desired. Some three weeks ago,
J. H. Craig, Allen's brother-in-law,
visited the University and made
an oral appeal to the committee.
He was told that if Allen would
make a written statement to the
committee of his policy in regard
to the constituted authorities of
the University, the committee
would gladly consider the matter.
Allen was very sick at the time
and unable to present his statement
until a short time ago.
While Professor 11. L. Green,
chairman of the Committee on
Student Affairs, did not make pub
lic the statememt presented by Al
len, it is generally understood that
the deposed editor made no apology
to the committee, nor was he ex
pected by the committee to do so.
In fact Allen has not changed his
position with regard to the Student
Affairs Committee, and he will not
be forced to change in order to re
gain his standing in the University.
The only promise made by Allen
was the assurance that he would
not place himself in direct oppo
sition to the constituted authorities
of the University.
Allen was unofficially informed
of the committee's action by the
Daily Palo Alto at his home in
Woodland, over the telephone.
He is still seriously ill and was
carried to the telephone on a couch.
When told that he had been reinstat
ed unconditionally, he was greatly
surprised, as he had not as yet
heard of the committee's action.
He stated that if he is well enough
he will return to the University
and re-register next week. He will
then take out a leave of absence
for the remainder of the semester,
and will enter college next Sep
tember to complete his course in
the Law department.
The reinstatement of Allen caused
much pleasure among those stu
dents who learned of it, and the
action of the committee was gener
ally commended.
