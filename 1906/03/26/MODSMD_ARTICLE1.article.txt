# PRIVILEGES EXTENDED
## PRESIDENT JORDAN CANCELS PRESS RESTRICTIONS. Amicable Settlement of Trouble Due to Efforts of Professor Suzzallo. 
### 
As a result of the recent contro
versy between the representatives
of the press and the President's of
fice, a conference of the newspaper
men of the University was held
last Tuesday night in Encina Hall.
The meeting was called at the init
iative of Professor Suzzallo of the
department of Education, after dis
cussing with President Jordan the
issues involved in the recent mis
understanding as to official news.
The whole status of the college
press throughout the country and
at Stanford University in parti
cular, was discussed. The result
of this informal conference was a
general agreement on certain facts
and controlling principles with
regard to the gathering and report
ing of news. These were as fol
lows:
(1) That the student press sys
tem as known at Stanford Univer
sity is far superior to the outside
press representative system as
known at other places, Columbia
Fully fifteen hundred people
gathered on the bleachers early in
thd'afternoon to see the young ath
letes compete. The majority of
were from the Stanford stu
dent body, but many of the con
testing schools had their supporters
on the bleachers and Oakland sent
a full rooting section. From the
first event, when Kenyon Lee, Har
vard's plucky miler, broke the tape
let) feet ahead of the interscholastic
champion Maundrell, to Munn's
record-breaking vault the result
was always in doubt. Harvard
with three first and one second
place man on the track took the
lead and until the pole-vault set
tled the result, had totaled 18
points,. San Jose second with 15
and Oakland third with 14.
.There were many surprises dur
ing the day The Lees of Harvard
tobk Maundrell's measure in the
mile and half-mile. Gillern, a com
pirati'vely unknown sprinter from
Pacific Grove, won the hundred,
and Crabtree, Lick's crack quarter
miler, was beaten by Kerr of San
Jpse Bellah of Han ford, who was
supposed to he Munn's most dan
gerous opponent for individual
honors, won his heats easily in the
low hurdles, only to slip and fall
in the final of the race. Even then
he ran out pluckily to the finish and
came in a close fourth. His fall
shook him badly, however, and he
failed to equal his former records
in the broad jump and pole-vault,
winning second in the former and
tying for second with Vail of Oak
land in the latter.
Oakland's was practically a one
man team, while Harvard had five
brilliant performers. Munn won
three firsts —the shot-put, the pole
vault and the high jump—and took
second in the hammer-throw, mak
ing a total of 18 points for his
team. Tomasini was another re
markable performer, throwing the
twelve-pound hammer over 170
feet from a slippery ring.
The officials were: Referee,
William Greer Harrison; starter,
Phil. M. Wand; timers, E. W.
Moulton, Dr. Frank Angell, George
Klaarrnan, 0. F. Snedigar and I.
C. Ackermann, '06; judges of the
