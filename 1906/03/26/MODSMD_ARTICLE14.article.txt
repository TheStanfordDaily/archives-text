# OPINION OF AN ALUMNUS.
## Interesting Review of First Interscholastic Meet. 
### Archie Rice, '95 
The success of succeeding pre
paratory school annual field-days
at Stanford will be measured by
the high standards established at
the first great meet in 190b.
To prepare such an event on
comparatively short notice was a
record in itself. But to assemble
168 representative young athletes
from twentv-three schools, several
of them at a distance of from 300
to 500 miles from the University,
and the very day when eleven
other preparatory schools were
holding a previously arranged
field-day at Ventura, was a splen
did initial endorsement of the
Stanford spirit and hospitality
that conceived and smoothly car
ried out the whole plan.
There was a novelty and a charm
about the invitation to spend the
greater part of three days as the
guests of the undergraduates in the
halls and fraternity-houses at
Stanford. The material incentives
were the five beautiful, big, silver
loving cups, costing in the aggre
gate about $400, and the twelve
gold, twelve silver, and twelve
bronze medals, making altogether
approximately $600 worth of prizes.
Forty-seven races on the track,
including the various heats and the
relay, and five field events, made
an unprecedented list of contests.
But so smoothly and expeditiously
were the preparations completed
that every event, except the culmi
nating and, as it proved,all-critical
pole-vault, was decided by a few
minutes after 4 o'clock. Not an
accident, not a protest, not a show
of harsh rivalry, not an unsports
manlike incident occurred to mar
the meet. And when the disposi
tion of the three most important
cups and the winning of the field
day depended upon the perform
ances of the thirteen pole-vaulters,
it was a fitting conclusion to the
day's sport that glorious double
rainbows-pointed their good omens I
in the eastern heavens while 2 200
spectators stood hatlessat the great
chorused singing of "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," and watched the vaulters
vie on and on till a world's prepar
atory school record was broken in
deciding which school should have
highest rank in the meet.
it has been my privilege to at
tend all the great collegiate, aca
demic, and other amateur field
days held in California during the
last seventeen years. The first in
terscholastic meet at Stanford for
numbers, good sportsmanship, and
diversity of] sections represented
surpasses all the others. But for
the torrential rains of the few pre
ceding days and the resultingly
softened track the running records
might have been better, because
many of the finishers were capable
of faster time.
Most of the contestants in this
meet will probably make other pil
grimages to Stanford for similar
field-days. Some of them will be
future intercollegiate rivals in an
nual varsity meets. That is why
in recording the results I have
taken pains to indicate the dis
tances that separated competitors
at the finish. They will be able
to get a better line on their future
chances.
Another year the new field will
add to the interest of the event,
and possibly it will be held a little

later in the season to make sure, of
the most advantageous weather.
Then, too, there can be in position
a large blackboard on which the
points may be conspicuously dis
played as events change the totals.
Also, I hope to see twelve addition-,
al cups put up next year by the
Stanford classes from '95 to '06,
each class fostering some partic
ular event and taking pride in
drawing to it more actual contest
ants than participated the year
before. With such trophie√ü added,
any school with one good athlete
may reasonably hope to take home
a beautiful prize.
