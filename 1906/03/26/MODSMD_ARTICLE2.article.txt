With the standards set at 11 feet
inches, Munri of Oakland broke
the world's interscholastic record
in the pole-vault, won for his team
the meet, the Stanford University
and Sigma Sigma cups, and for

himself the Encina Club cup,
bringing to a close the greatest field
meet ever held on the Pacific Coastr.
To the speedy team from Lick went
the Bittner relay trophy and the
Coast record for the five-man, stand
ing-touch relay, which they low
ered from 3:28 to 3:26.4. To the
Harvard School of Los Angeles
went the Thiele second-place cup
and the honor of having undoubt
edly the best balanced team in the
meet.
The day itself was cloudy, with
showers in the morning, and the
track soft and soggy from protract
ed rain. The arrangements for the
meet were perfect and the large
number of entries in the various
events were handled without a
hitch. From the starting gun,
which sent off the first 220-yard
heat at 10 in the morning, there
was not the slightest delay to mar
the success of the meet. To the of
ficers of the Interscholastic Associ
ation and to officials on the track,
due credit should be given for the
perfection to which their arrange
ments were brought.
