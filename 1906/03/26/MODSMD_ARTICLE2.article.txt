With the standards set at 11 feet
inches, Munri of Oakland broke
the world's interscholastic record
in the pole-vault, won for his team
the meet, the Stanford University
and Sigma Sigma cups, and for

himself the Encina Club cup,
bringing to a close the greatest field
meet ever held on the Pacific Coastr.
To the speedy team from Lick went
the Bittner relay trophy and the
Coast record for the five-man, stand
ing-touch relay, which they low
ered from 3:28 to 3:26.4. To the
Harvard School of Los Angeles
went the Thiele second-place cup
and the honor of having undoubt
edly the best balanced team in the
meet.
The day itself was cloudy, with
showers in the morning, and the
track soft and soggy from protract
ed rain. The arrangements for the
meet were perfect and the large
number of entries in the various
events were handled without a
hitch. From the starting gun,
which sent off the first 220-yard
heat at 10 in the morning, there
was not the slightest delay to mar
the success of the meet. To the of
ficers of the Interscholastic Associ
ation and to officials on the track,
due credit should be given for the
perfection to which their arrange
ments were brought.
University for example, as evi
denced by the form and character
of news printed.
(2) That the student press sys
tem at Stanford is operated upon a
far higher plane than in many
other colleges. The kind of news
which has been recently forbidden
by the Senior College Council of
the University of Chicago, that of
the sensational reporting of lectures
in the classroom and matters of
discipline in the women's halls, has
always been voluntarily eliminated
by the Stanford press.
(3) That the responsibilities of
the men engaged in newspaper
work as students in the University
are primary to their responsibilities
as press correspondents.
(4) That in the reportingof news,
particularly official news, theetate
ments of fact should be verified
where such is essential to the truth
of any statement or article.
(5) That the misquotation or
garbling of official statements is
sued in person or in writing is an
evil which the Stanford press has
always deprecated.
(6) That the press recognizes
that in the administration of a uni
versity, certain matters must be re
garded by the officials as executive
in their nature, and that a declina
tion upon the part of the university
officials to reveal the facts connect
ed with such matters is legitimate,
and in no way involves a lack of
willingness to cooperate with the
press.
Other matters were discussed by
those present, the above being the
more important considerations. The
editor of the Daily Palo Alto, and
the press representatives of the Call,
Chronicle, Examiner and Bulletin
were present. Professor Suzzallo
was also present, taking active and
advisory part in the discussion.
It was upon a personal presenta
tion of these generally accepted
views and principles of the news
paper men of the college by Pro
fessor Suzzallo to President Jordan
that the President's office re-ex
tended the news privileges to the
press.

are primary to their responsibilities
as press correspondents.
(4) That in the reportingof news,

ments of fact should be verified
where such is essential to the truth
of any statement or article.
(5) That the misquotation or

evil which the Stanford press has
always deprecated.
(6) That the press recognizes
that in the administration of a uni

officials to reveal the facts connect
ed with such matters is legitimate,
and in no way involves a lack of
willingness to cooperate with the
press.
Other matters were discussed by
those present, the above being the
more important considerations. The
editor of the Daily Palo Alto, and
the press representatives of the Call,
Chronicle, Examiner and Bulletin
were present. Professor Suzzallo
was also present, taking active and
advisory part in the discussion.
It was upon a personal presenta

With the standards set at 11 feet
inches, Munri of Oakland broke
the world's interscholastic record
in the pole-vault, won for his team
the meet, the Stanford University
and Sigma Sigma cups, and for

himself the Encina Club cup,
bringing to a close the greatest field
meet ever held on the Pacific Coastr.
To the speedy team from Lick went
the Bittner relay trophy and the
Coast record for the five-man, stand
ing-touch relay, which they low
ered from 3:28 to 3:26.4. To the
Harvard School of Los Angeles
went the Thiele second-place cup
and the honor of having undoubt
edly the best balanced team in the
meet.
The day itself was cloudy, with
showers in the morning, and the
track soft and soggy from protract
ed rain. The arrangements for the
meet were perfect and the large
number of entries in the various
events were handled without a
hitch. From the starting gun,
which sent off the first 220-yard
heat at 10 in the morning, there
was not the slightest delay to mar
the success of the meet. To the of
ficers of the Interscholastic Associ
ation and to officials on the track,
due credit should be given for the
perfection to which their arrange
ments were brought.
