The Daily Palo Alto believes
that as the organ of the students of
Stanford University it should ex
press their opinions upon - all sub
jects and events of importance.
Inasmuch as the students of this
institution are in an overwhelming
majority in favor of the old Ameri
can game of football, we feel that
we should voice their sentiments in
regard to the action of the Football
Conference.
In the first place, the action of
the Football Conference in adopt
ing the Rugby game was taken with
undue haste. The students of the
universities affected by the change
were given no voice in the proceed
ings and no opportunity to petition
or protest. Without opportunity
for defense, the American game
was sentenced, executed and thrust
into its grave, almost before its
friends knew that it was even in
danger. Such an action required
deliberation, but everything was
done in baste and confusion.
Secondly, the action of the Con
ference was unwarranted. The
evils charged against football, such
as brutality, professionalism, and
lowering of intellectual and moral
standard?, may exist elsewhere,
but do not exist and never have ex
isted in the contests between Stan
ford and California. As long as the
students kept the game from these
vices they had a right to continue
to play it, and thus the action of
the Conference was a flagrant dis
regard of that right, while the
charge against the game implied
by that action is utterly groundless
and false.
Again, the action of the Confer
ence is contrary to the wishes of the
Stanford student body. With
scarcely a dissenting voice we de
sire and demand the game—the old
game which we ourselves have
played, and which has been played
by Stanford men in the paßt. It
is that game which we want, and
not some imported English product.

The abolition of the American
game has taken place without our
consent and in spite of our pro
tests. Hut in any such action
we have a right to a voice, and
we demand a voice. We insist that
we shall not he deprived of the
game which we love and which we
wish to perpetuate. And we de
nounce the action of the Conference
as hasty, arbitrary, unwarranted,
inexpedient, and flagrantly unjust.
We want the American game, and
unless we have that we will have
nothing. This protest we regard
as our final and unalterable senti
ment, and though we are powerless
to prevent the step taken by the
Conference, we can at least raise
such a storm of opposition that it
will be forced to reconsider its act
ion.
