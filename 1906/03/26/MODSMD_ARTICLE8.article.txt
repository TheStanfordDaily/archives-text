# GOOD CONCERT DESPITE RAIN
## Crowds Gather on Quad and Listen To Music Given Visiting Athletes. 
### 
The second concert given by the
University Hand, last Friday even
ing, March 23d, proved to be a
great success. The band stand was
situated under the main arch of
the inner quad, and a large crowd
of 700 people gathered in the near
by arcade. Plans had been made
to hold the concert in front of the
Memorial Church, but the rain
necessitated the change. The
promenade feature had also to be
abandoned on account of unfavor
able weather, but the large and
enthusiastic number present attest
ed to the appreciative regard in
which the band music is held.
