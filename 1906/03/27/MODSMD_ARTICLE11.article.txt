At certain intervals the student
body of Stanford University is
called upon to decide important
questions regarding undergraduate
customs. To-morrow the men of
the Senior class will decide whether
the long-established custom of ap
pearing on graduation day attired
in the latest as well as remote fash
ions shall be abolished, or whether
the men of the class shall appear
in cap and gown.
The Seniors should adopt the
conventional garb, not because it is
conventional but in order to lend
dignity to an occasion which has
previously been passed over with
businesslike rapidity, and to which
little or no importance has been
attached. Heretofore the com
mencements at Stanford have been
on a par with high school or pre
paratory school graduation days,
while they should be in keeping
with the dignity of the University.
