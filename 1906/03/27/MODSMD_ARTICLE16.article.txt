Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I ask the courtesy of your
paper to say a word about the golf
links. The Reservoir field has been
rented to us by the Board of Trus
tees at a small rental. The links
have been laid out by a profes
sional. The executive committee
is proceeding as rapidly as the
weather permits in improving the
field. The greens are being laid
out, the field rolled, and the grass
cut. But the process of develop
ment will soon cease unless the
lovers of the game come foward
and help bv the payment of en
trance fees ($8) and semester dues
($1). The executive committee
will not go into debt, and the links
cannot be developed without prompt
support. Fees and dues may be
paid to the secretary and E. C.
Sterling, D. K. E. house, or any
member of the executive committee.
If those interested will attend to
the matter of dues there is every
reason to hope that weather per
mitting we may have an opening
tournament directly after the va
cation. D. Charles Gardner,
President Stanford Golf Club.
