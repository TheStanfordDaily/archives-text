# "Chaparral" Out Wednesday.
## 
### 
The regular Junior number of
the Chaparral will be on sale on
the quad Wednesday morning. The
issue will be the largest and most
elaborate ever published in honor
of the Junior class. It consists of
twenty-six pages arid a half-tone
supplement. The supplement pic
ture is that of D. 1). Sales, 'OG,
captain of the Varsity baseball
team. The cover for this issue will
be novel and attractive, being a
flaring cardinal with "Chappie"
attired in green instead of the usu
al red. Chappie's editorials are
easily the funniest of the year. He
treats of the Junior class, the farce,
and the prom, in a most humorous
manner, and the remaining three
editorials are devoted exclusively
to the coming election at Mayfield
where the voters will decide for
prohibition or an open town. Chap
pie's instructions as to how to vote
on the proposition are as amusing
as they are peculiar. The literary
features are mainly devoted to the
Junior festivities. A diary of a
young girl, a new batch of society
notes, and a story of complications
that arose from Wilson's tempor
ary raise in the price of nut sun
daes comprise the most prominent
prose articles. There is a humor
ous short history of the Chaparral
in which the editor for 1907 is in
troduced, and a lone dialect poem
on the prom. More than the usual
amount of jokes and shorter verse
is contributed by G. G. Altnow,

'06, E. J. Hadley, '08, J. Nibley,
'06, M. W. Curtain, '08, and G. F.
Morgan,'o9. The art work is more
plentiful and of a higher quality
than usual. The Junior poster girl
and a full-page crayon entitled
"Lent," by E. E. Horrowitz, '06,
are the art features of the number.
M. J. Helmick, '09, contributes
several timely cartoons, and Snod
grass, '01, offers a number of excel
lent sketches. I). H. Ferry, '08,
and J. J. Sheehy, '06, also contri
bute heavily. In all the number
is perhaps the best and breeziest
Chappie has offered this year.
