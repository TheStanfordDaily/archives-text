# Junior Arrangements Completed.

### 
The cast of the Junior farce is be-'
ing drilled in the finishing touches
of "Stanfordâ€”The Life Strenuous"
in Assembly Hall, preparatory to
the production Thursday night.
The special prom, scene, to be used
in the second act, has arrived, and
will be used in the final dress re
hearsals. The chorus has been
thoroughly trained and promises to
be the feature of the opera. The
preliminary sale of seats has been
very heavy.
On Friday morning a track meet
between the Varsity and an All-
Southern California team will be
held. It is probable that the game
arranged with St. Mary's for Fri
day afternoon will not be played,
as the Varsity is scheduled to meet
the same team in Oakland Satur
day. Instead, the Junior team will
probably play the Faculty nine.
The prom, will be held in En
cina in the evening. Brohaska's
orchestra will furnish the music
for the program of twenty-one
dances.
