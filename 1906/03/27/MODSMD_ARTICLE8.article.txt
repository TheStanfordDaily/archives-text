ex-'O6, made the team, but has
left the University to accept a
position on a farm in Southern
California. When the prospects of
the two rival teams are compared,
Stanford's chances for defeating the
California men next month seem
excellent. The time and place for
the intercollegiate meet have not
yet been definitely arranged. Both
sides, however, are agreed that
compus games are the most desira
ble. The Stanford players have
opened negotiations to have the
tournament held hero the evening
before the intercollegiate field meet,
which is run off April 21st.
