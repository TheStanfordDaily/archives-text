# B.S. ALLEN RETURNS
## MAKES STATEMENT CONCERNING RE-ADMISSION. Correspondence Leading Up to Reinstatement Is Published in Full. 
### 
B. S. Allen, '06, who was sus
pended from the University on
February sth for an editorial in the
Daily Palo Alto, and notice of
whose reinstatement by the Com
mittee on Student Affairs was
made public last Friday afternoon,
returned to the campus Monday.
Allen had been recuperating at his
home in Woodland from a serious
nervous collapse, and upon hear
ing of the termination of the period
of his suspension left hastily for
the University in order to settle
his affairs.
He has not yet decided whether
he will remain for the remainder of
the semester or not. On discuss
ing with some of his professors the
advisibility of immediately resum
ing his college work, Allen found
that he would be pressed in bis
present poor state of health, and so
will wait until next week to see if
there is sufficient improvement in
his condition to warrant his re
maining in college. If Allen takes
out a leave of absence he will in all
probability return next semester
and finish his college course. In
regard to resuming his work at
this time, he said that he would be
so busy studying that he would
have no time for taking an active
part in the trouble between the stu
dents and the faculty. This'state
ment is made as an assertion in
the letter written by Allen to Pro
fessor It. L. Green, chairman of the
Student Affairs Committee, con
cerning which the latter said that
Allen had made assurances "that
he will not place himself in opposi
tion to the constituted authorities
of the University." Allen says that
this phrase includes no more than
he stated, and furthermore that he
never petitioned the committee for
reinstatement. Allen maintains
that his suspension was terminated
through the intercession of his
brother-in law, J. S. Craig, who
recently met the committee on his
behalf. The first letter of the com
mittee to Allen follows:
LELANDSTANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY
COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AFFAIRS
Stanford University, California,
March 5, 190G.
Mr. B. S. Allen,
Woodland, California.
Dear Sir: —Your brother-in-law,
Mr. Craig, acting for you, has to
day petitioned the Committee in
your behalf that you be permitted
to return to the University and
finish your course this semester.
On behalf of the Committee I am
instructed to suggest to you that
you write to us in your own way
and as fully as you care to make it
a statement concerning your atti
tude and activity as a student dur
ing thiB semester in case you were
re-admitted to the University.
Very truly yours,
It. L. Green, Chairman.
Although Allen was reluctant
about making any statement, he
finally wrote the following letter:
Mr. R. L. Green,
Chairman Committee on Stu
dent Affairs.
Dear Sir: —In the event that I
am reinstated in Stanford I shall
take no further active part in the
trouble which prevails between the
students and the authorities. I feel
that I have done my share of the
fighting and I do not care to parti
cipate any further. I shall also be
very busy with my studies and my
efforts to make up the work which
I have lost will preclude the possi
bility of my taking a very active
part in undergraduate affairs, as
Mr. Craig on my behalf informed
the Committee.
B. S. Ai.len.
After some deliberation the com
mittee sent last Friday afternoon
the official notification of his re
instatement, which is given below.
Mr. B. 8. Allen.
Dear Sir: —The Committee on
Student Affairs has granted your
petition to be re-admitted to the
University. There was some ques
tion on the part of the Committee
concerning the word "active" as
used with reference to your part as
a student in relation to the consti
tuted authorities of the University.
However, the members of the Com
mittee understood from the context
that this word was meant by you
in a way acceptable to the Com
mittee.
R. L. Green, Chairman.
