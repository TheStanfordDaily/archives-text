# B.S. ALLEN RETURNS
## MAKES STATEMENT CONCERNING RE-ADMISSION. Correspondence Leading Up to Reinstatement Is Published in Full. 
### 
B. S. Allen, '06, who was sus
pended from the University on
February sth for an editorial in the
Daily Palo Alto, and notice of
whose reinstatement by the Com
mittee on Student Affairs was
made public last Friday afternoon,
returned to the campus Monday.
Allen had been recuperating at his
home in Woodland from a serious
nervous collapse, and upon hear
ing of the termination of the period
of his suspension left hastily for
the University in order to settle
his affairs.
He has not yet decided whether
he will remain for the remainder of
the semester or not. On discuss
ing with some of his professors the
advisibility of immediately resum
ing his college work, Allen found
that he would be pressed in bis
present poor state of health, and so
will wait until next week to see if
there is sufficient improvement in
his condition to warrant his re
maining in college. If Allen takes
out a leave of absence he will in all
probability return next semester
and finish his college course. In
regard to resuming his work at
this time, he said that he would be
so busy studying that he would
have no time for taking an active
part in the trouble between the stu
dents and the faculty. This'state
ment is made as an assertion in
the letter written by Allen to Pro
fessor It. L. Green, chairman of the
Student Affairs Committee, con
cerning which the latter said that
Allen had made assurances "that
he will not place himself in opposi
tion to the constituted authorities
of the University." Allen says that
this phrase includes no more than
he stated, and furthermore that he
never petitioned the committee for
reinstatement. Allen maintains
that his suspension was terminated
through the intercession of his
brother-in law, J. S. Craig, who
recently met the committee on his
behalf. The first letter of the com
mittee to Allen follows:
