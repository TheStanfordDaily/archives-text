# Will Have New Field.
## 
### 
Columbia University will build
a million dollar athletic field which
shall be free to all students at all
i times. It is to be constructed on
made ground between One Hun
dred and Sixteenth and One Hun
dred and Twentieth streets, west
!of Riverside Park. The field as
I proposed will be large enough for a
full sized baseball diamond or a
football gridiron. The stand sur
rounding the field will be con
stucted of steel and concrete and
will be finished in an artistic and
decorative style. Provision is also
made for two public playgrounds,
one on the north for tennis and
similar sports and one on the south
for a baseball diamond, for the use
of the public schools.
