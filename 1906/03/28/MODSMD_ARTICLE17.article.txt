# MAKE DEBATING TEAMS
## BLAIR, HEBRON AND SALES, McCOLLOCH AS ALTERNATE. Nevada Team Will Consist of Beardsley, Brennan, Cunha and Maloy. Football Question Discussed. 
### 
After a spirited try-out in which
new material figured prominently
a first and second Varsity debating
teams were picked last night in
room 62 on the quad. The decis
ion of the judges was that VV. L.
Blair, '06, VV. F. Herron, '08, D. D.
Sales, '06, and C. C. McColloch, '08,
had acquitted themselves best of
the twelve candidates and should
therefore constitute the team to de
bate the University of California,
McColloch to act as alternate. The
judges named the three next best
speakers for the Nevada team as
follows: C. A. Beardsley, '06, J. L.
Brennan, '07, and E. A. Cunha, '06,
with J. L. Maloy, '06, as alternate.
Sales is the veteran debater of
both teams. In his sophomore
year he debated for his class. This
makes his second year as an inter
collegiate debater, and he has al
ready been a member of the two
last Carnot teams.
Blair was intercollegiate alternate
in 1903 and a member of the 1905
Nevada team. Herron debated
with the 1908 trio against the
Freshmen last fall. He debated
against California for the Carnot
medal this year. McColloch was a
member of the 1908 Freshman
team.
The second team also is not lack
ing in experience. Cunha, Beards
ley and Maloy have all been in in
terclass debates, and Brennan has
had much practice in Euphronia
Literary Society. Cunha also al
ternated against Nevada last spring
while he was a leading candidate
in the last Carnot contest.
The question for discussion was,
as previously announced: "Re
solved, That the American game of
football has done more harm than
good to the ideals for which uni
versities should exist."
At the conclusion of the speeches,
which occupied more than two
hours, the judges retired to deliber
ate on the merits of the speakers,
and were out nearly an hour more
before they brought in their decis
ion. Professor C. A. Duniway in
reporting for the board of judges
commented on the unusual close
ness of the contest and recommend
ed that a different system of try
out hereafter be employed whereby
each speaker may do rebuttal work
which, he said, was almost neces
sary to afford the judges opportun
ity of estimating properly the rela
tive ability of speakers.
