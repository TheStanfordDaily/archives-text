# SOUTHERN TRACK MEET
## COACH HOLMES WILL BRING FIFTEEN ATHLETES. High-class Contest Assured for Friday Morning.â€”Hagerman and Munger Star Jumpers. 
### 
Coach Holmes of the University
of Southern California will arrive
on the campus to-morrow night
with a team of fifteen track athletes.
This team is selected from all the
southern California universities
and contains several high-class per
formers who will undoubtedly give
the Varsity a hard contest Friday
morning. The Freshmen will be
unable to take part in the meet,
as the intercollegiate Freshman
track meet will be held on Satur
day. This will weaken the Varsity
considerably and consequently in
sures a close contest with the
southerners.
Hagerman, a broad jumper and
hurdler, is one of the stars of the All-
Southern California team and has a
record of over twenty-three feet in
the broad jump. Munger of Pomo
na is another man upon whom
Holmes relies to take points in Fri
day's meet. In a recent contest in
the south Munger cleared 6 feet 1
inch in the high jump, which
makes him practically certain of
five points against the Varsity.
Breitkrutz, a former Wisconsin
athlete, will run the half-mile and
mile. He has fine records in both
these distances and should give the
Varsity men a hard race in both
events. The All-Southern Califor
nia representatives are a well-bal
anced team, having at least one
high-class man in each event, and
the meet is sure to be the best con
test seen here this year, aside from
the intercollegiate meet. The meet
will be held at 10 o'clock Friday
morning and the admission will be
fifty cents.
