# SOUTHERNERSMAYWIN
## HOLMES' TEAM HAS GOOD CHANCE TO WIN. Fast Time Will Be Made on the Track, and Field Events Should Be High Class. 
### 
To-morrow morning at 10 the
Vareitv track men will meet the
best team Southern California can
produce. Coach Holmes of the
University of Southern California
has gathered a team which contains
several stars, and every man is
above the average in his event. The
meet to-morrow will undoubtedly
be high-class, and if the weather
conditions are favorable there is a
possibility of some record-breaking
performances.
In the mile the Southerners have
Lorbeer of Occidental College, who
has a record of 4:37. J. E. Mil
ler will be forced to extend himself
to win this race, which should prove
one of the events of the meet. Breit
krutz, of the University of South
ern California, who ran the half
mile under two minutes when at
Wisconsin, is expected to win this
event for the visitors. He will be
forced to do his best by Russell,
Shearer and Severy. Bird of Oc
cidental, and Wilson of the Uni
versity of Southern California, are
the two men upon whom Coach
Holmes relies in the sprints. Their
records are good, and it is likely
that first places in the dashes will
go to the Southerners. The two
mile should prove to be a great
race between Nash, '07, and Cha
pin of Occidental, who has done
close to ten minutes. In the high
jump and broad jump Munger of
Pomona and Hagerman of Occi
dental are almost certain of firßt
places, as their records are superior
to anything done by the men who
will represent Stanford.
It seems in predicting the out
come of the meet that the All-
Southern California team has more
than an even chance, their only
handicap being lack of numbers as
compared with the Stanford entries.
Trainer Moulton considers to-mor
row's contest a severe lest of the
Varsity material, and states that
Holmes' team is one of the best
ever gathered together on this
Coast. The meet begins at ten
o'clock and the admission is fifty
cents. A complete list of entries

cidental, and Wilson of the Uni
versity of Southern California, are
the two men upon whom Coach
Holmes relies in the sprints. Their
records are good, and it is likely
that first places in the dashes will
go to the Southerners. The two
mile should prove to be a great
race between Nash, '07, and Cha
pin of Occidental, who has done
close to ten minutes. In the high
jump and broad jump Munger of
Pomona and Hagerman of Occi
dental are almost certain of firßt
places, as their records are superior
to anything done by the men who
will represent Stanford.
It seems in predicting the out
come of the meet that the All-
Southern California team has more
than an even chance, their only
handicap being lack of numbers as
compared with the Stanford entries.
Trainer Moulton considers to-mor
row's contest a severe lest of the
Varsity material, and states that
Holmes' team is one of the best
ever gathered together on this
Coast. The meet begins at ten
o'clock and the admission is fifty
cents. A complete list of entries

To-morrow morning at 10 the
Vareitv track men will meet the
best team Southern California can
produce. Coach Holmes of the
University of Southern California
has gathered a team which contains
several stars, and every man is
above the average in his event. The
meet to-morrow will undoubtedly
be high-class, and if the weather
conditions are favorable there is a
possibility of some record-breaking
performances.
In the mile the Southerners have
Lorbeer of Occidental College, who
has a record of 4:37. J. E. Mil
ler will be forced to extend himself
to win this race, which should prove
one of the events of the meet. Breit
krutz, of the University of South
ern California, who ran the half
mile under two minutes when at
Wisconsin, is expected to win this
event for the visitors. He will be
forced to do his best by Russell,
Shearer and Severy. Bird of Oc
cidental, and Wilson of the Uni
versity of Southern California, are
the two men upon whom Coach
Holmes relies in the sprints. Their
records are good, and it is likely
