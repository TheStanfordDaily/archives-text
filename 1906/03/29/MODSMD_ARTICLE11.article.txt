# PLANS OF SOCIAL. SERVICE
## Club to Meet Every Three Weeks Outside Speakers to Address Meetings. 
### 
The executive committee of the
Social Settlement Club will meet in
the near future to complete plans
for the further advancement of the
new club. At present the club will
confine itself principally to the
educational side of settlement and
social problems, but as soon as con
ditions are ripe and the members
can co-operate with the alumni in
San Francisco a regular college
settlement, similar to those found
in the East, will be established in
the city.
For special study the clul) is
divided into sections, but a person
may belong to the Social Service
Club itself, without identifying
with any of the sub-organizations.
One of the strongest of the latter
organizations is that formed to
study political problems. Another,
under the leadership of Professor
Suzzallo, will consider educational
problems. liev. Gardner will
have charge of a section to study
social problems. Another section
will deal with boys' clubs and their
organization where needed. Other
sections will deal with work among
the poor and with the establishment
of regular systems of correspondence
with Stanford alumni in all parts
of t he world.
The club as a whole will n eet
every three weeks, and on April
11th a special assembly will be
held, at which it is expected that
Dr. Jordan and other speakers will
address the student body on social
settlement workandsocial problems.
.The next meeting of the club will
probably he held on April 18th, at
which time there will be an address
by a prominent speaker, whose
name will be announced later.
