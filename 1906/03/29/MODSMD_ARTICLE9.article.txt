Stanford has been remarkably
void of hoodlumism in classrooms
in the past, and it is to be regretted
that the action of certain members
of different classes during the past
few weekH should necessitate editor
ial mention, but the flagrant viola
tion by several students of all sent-e
of decency makes it necessary.
These violators of the laws of eti
quette and decency scuffle their
feet, make remarks out loud, and
guffaw when something amusing
occurs. The men who have com
mitted these acts attend the classes
and listen to the lectures of their
own free will and accord, and if
they cannot restrain themselves
they had best keep away. If they
do not desire to act otherwise, they
should not only get out of the class,
but get out of Stanford. Stanford
is no place for hoodlums —and the
actions of these persons brand them
as such. In a majority of the
cases the guilty persons cannot even
assert that the professor was ex
ceeding the time limit. They have
no reason and hardly an excuse,
and if they do not conduct them
selves as gentlemen, they should
not be tolerated either by the stu
dent body or University authori
ties.
