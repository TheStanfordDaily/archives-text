# SOUTHERN TEAM WINS
## VARSITY LOSES MEET BY SCORE OF 63½ TO 58½. E.J. Nash Establishes Stanford Record of 10:27 in Two Mile. Bird Is Southern Star. 
### 
In a close conteBt marked by
high-claes performances the All-
Southern California team defeated
the Varsity athletes this morning
by the score of 631 to The
Southerners took the lead from the
start and it looked like an easy
victory for them until the field
events were decided. These brought
up the Stanford score and placed
the final result in doubt until after
the relay, which the visitors won
by a very close margin.
E. J. Nash, '07, won the two
mile from Himrod of Pomona and
Roth of Occidental in 10:27. Nash's
time establishes a new Stanford re
cord for the two mile and is within
six seconds of the Coast Intercolle
giate record. The former Stanford
record was held by L. (i. Burr, '05,
at 10:27.2. Himrod of Pomona ran
a great race and it was Nash's
sprint at the finish that won for
him. The time was phenomenal
for the muddy track.
Bird of Occidental College was
easily the star of the Southern
team. He won the 100 and 220
yard dashes and took first place in
the quarter at 52.2, which is fast
time, especially on such a track. In
the 220 yard dash Bird won easily,
but he was closely pressed by Cope,
'08, and Vandervoort, '08, in the
hundred.
The Southern jumpers did not
equal their past performances but
they did well enough to capture
first places in both the high and
broad. In the weights the visitors
were badly beaten and in the pole
vault only half a point went to
Hoi tnes' team. Chapin of Occi
dental won the mile in 4:44, and
Miller, '08, did not show up as well
as expected. Brown of Pomona
captured the half mile in 2:03.4,
beating a high-class field.
