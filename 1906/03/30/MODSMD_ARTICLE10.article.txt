## EMINENT PHYSICIANS COMPILE STATISTICS OF INJURIES. Doctors Nichols and Smith, Surgeons of Harvard Football Squad, Declare Game Dangerous. 
### 
An article which recently ap
peared in the Boston Medical and
Surgical Journal, entitled "The
Physical Aspect of American
Football," throws a new light upon
the subject of injuries received in
the game.
The article is written by Dr. Ed
ward H. Nichols and l)r. Homer
B. Smith, two well-known phy
sicians who had the care of the
Harvard football squad last sea
son, and in it these eminent au
thorities show by means of statis
tics that the percentage of injuries
is larger than is generally believed.
The following consists of ex
tracts from the article:
"There were 150 men altogether
in the football squad, of whom
50, at least, played but a very
short time, varying from a few
days to a week or two. Of the re
maining 100, only 70 can be
said to represent the real playing
strength of the football squad.
This fact makes the proportion of
injuries received this year almost
double as great as would appear at
first sight.
