"The injuries were received in
various ways: some in open play,
some in the mechanical drill of
'tackling the dummy,' but a very
great proportion occurred in the
'bunch' or 'pile' which forms after
a player running the ball is tackled.
The surgeons very quickly got in
the way of watching every pile
with great interest and apprehen
sion. The exact proportion between
the injuries received in the open
and in the pile, however, are not
controlled by accurate figures. The
number of injuries received in the
games and in practice were propor
tionately about the same.
