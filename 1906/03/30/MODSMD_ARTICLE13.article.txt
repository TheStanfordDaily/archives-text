# Are Injuries Avoidable?
## 
### 
"The question arises, Is it pos
sible to avoid these injuries as the
game is now played? Many of the
players claim that many of the in

juries are avoidable. This year
special precautions were taken to
avoid the occurrence of injuries.
Men who were known to I>e candi
dates for tlio squad weir notified
early in the hummer to begin lo get
into good physical condition before
reporting for football in the middle
of September. The scrimmage was
not begun as early this year as is
usual, in order to harden the men
up as much as possible before the
violent work hegan, and special
pads and armor were provided in
sufficient quantities to protect the
players as far as possible. In
spite of the-<e special precautions
it is claimed that the number of
injuries was excessive.
