# Comparison of Sports.

''An accurate comparison as to
the relative proportion of injuries
received by men playing football
and those taking part in other ma
jor sports would be interesting, but
we have not the facts to make an
accurate comparison. One of us,
however, has had a very intimate
knowledge of college baseball for
the past seven years, and there is
no question but that, while a man
may be seriously injured in playing
baseball, the relative number of
injuries is incomparably less in
baseball than it is in football. We
believe the same to be found true
in rowing and in track games.
