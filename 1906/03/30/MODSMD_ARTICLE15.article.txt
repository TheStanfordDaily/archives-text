# Conclusions.

### 
"In consideration of the above
facts we helieve that the following
conclusions may be drawn:
1. The number, severity and
permanence of the injuries which
are received in playing football are
very much greater than generally
is credited or believed.
2. The greater number of the in
juries come in the 'pile' and not in
the open plays, although serious
injuries are received in the open.
3. The number of injuries is in
herent in the game itself, and is
not due especially to close compe
tition, as is shown by the fact that
the proportion of injuries received
in gitmes and in practice is about
the same.
4. A large percentage of the in
juries is unavoidable.
5. The percentage of injuries is in
comparably greater in football than
in any other of the major sports.
G. The game does not develop
the best type of men physically,
because prominence is given to
weight without corresponding nerv
ous energy.
7. Constant medical supervision
of the game where large numbers
of men are engaged is a necessity
and not a luxury, although it is a
question if a game requiring the
constant attendance of two trained
surgeons is played under desirable
conditions.
8. The percentage of injury is
much too great for any mere sport.
9. Leaving out all other objec
tions to the game, ethical and
practical, the conditions under
which the game is played should
be so modified as to diminish
to a very great degree the number
of injuries."
