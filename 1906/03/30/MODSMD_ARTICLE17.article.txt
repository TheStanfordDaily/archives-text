# DEFENDS OUR FOOTBALL
## COLLEGE PAPER ARGUES FOR WESTERN METHODS. Chicago Daily Says Pacific Coast Started Movement Against Eastern Misrule. 
### 
In a recent issue the Daily Ma
roon, published by the students of
tiie University of Chicago,• com
menting editorially, fixes the es
sential difference between athletics
in the East and athletics in the
West, in h contribution to the foot
ball controversy. The editorial, of
course, includes in the West all
colleges which a Pacific Coast ob
server would call in the Middle
West, and also those which might
be spoken of as being in the Far
West. The remarks are prefaced
with the following quotation from
"Gov." Yates of Swarthmore Col
lege, formerly a Western player,
who is conversant with both East
ern and Western methods of play:
"Eastern football is much rough
er, more brutal, and 'dirtier' in
every way than the game as played
in the West. I saw every big team
in the East play this fall," he said,
''and 1 was in action against Penn
sylvania and many other promi
nent Eastern teams. Pennsylvania
I would class as containing the
worst bunch of ruffians on a foot
ball field I have ever seen. Yale
and Harvard are almost as bad,
and Princeton is likewise an ex
ceedingly rough-playing team.
Members of the 'big four' constant
ly slug their opponents in the
games."
Yates goes on to give several ex
amples of brutal play which he
himself suffered. The editorial cites
accounts of games played by Co
lumbia to prove that the sketch of
brutality made by Yates is not
overdrawn, and continues with the
statement: "This pretty picture is
absolutely without a parallel in the
West."
A second quotation, dealing with
a different branch of athletics, iB
from remarks made by Emmett D.
Angell, Wisconsin's basket-ball
coach:
•'A comparison of Eastern and
Western basket-ball establishes sev
eral interesting points. The East
ern game is rougher. ... It
is characteristic of Western basket
ball to enforce the rules, and it
is certainly true that the game
as played in the West is cleaner
than the Eastern game."
After having exhibited strong
evidence that there is a well estab
lished tradition in the East in fa
vor of brutality or roughness, and
laxity on the part of the officials,
the writer points to the'conference'
rules, which govern the chief inter
collegiate contests of the Middle
West, and the freshman ruie in
particular, which bars freshmen
from participation in such contests,
as being commended by Eastern
critics themselves. He closes with
a forceful appeal for Western self
government in athletics, which is
as follows:
"It is time, therefore, that the
West cease to look to the East for
approval, that it ignore the dic
tates of any Eastern 'misrule'com
mittee until such time as the East
will be morally fit to assume lead
ership. This means that the West
should remain sufficient to itself,
formulating its own style of play

without the necessity of considering
conditions which in the West do not
exist, and for which the West should
not be held responsible.
"The Pacific Coast teams have
planned the first steps in the move
ment to free the West, with its
clean traditions of sportsmanlike
conduct in athletics, from the tram
mels imposed on it hy a section of
the country where such marked
differences in this regard prevail."
