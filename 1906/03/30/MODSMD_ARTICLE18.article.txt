## Sport Suspended Until University Committee Is Satisfied with New Rules. 
### 
The board of overseers of Har
vard University has abolished foot
ball pending the leformation of the
rules of the game so that brutality,
foul play, and trickery will be
eliminated. As the university
committee on the regulation of
athletic sports put it, if changes are
to lie made no member of the so
called rules committee should have
a hand in them. This sentiment
was adopted unanimously by the
board. As the board must be per
fectly satisfied with the new rules
and will await the report of the
university committee before re-es
tablishing football, it is doubtful
whether Harvard will play in any
intercollegiate matches in the sport
next year.
