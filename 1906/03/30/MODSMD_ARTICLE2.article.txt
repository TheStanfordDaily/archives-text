# FRESHMAN TRACK TO-MORROW AND VARSITY BASEBALL NEXT WEEK.
## Stanford Freshmen Meet California To-morrow. Class of 1909 Has Even Chance To Win First Intercollegiate Field-Day. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon for the first
time in the history of the two uni
versities, rival Freshman track
teams will face each other on the
Berkeley oval. This meet will lie
watched with great interest, not
only because it is sure to be a close
and exciting contest, but because it
will afford an opportunity of get
ting a line on the Freshman ath
letes in each university who are
sure to play an important part in
the big meet this year. The Stan
ford team numbers but nineteen
men while the California Freshmen
have over forty athletes entered.
In the sprints and the 440-yard
dash Stanford will depend mainly
upon Rawles, with Holman and
Roth fighting for the places. Stan
ton, the speedy Freshman half
back, is the man whom California
expects to win the sprints. The
440-y'ard dash wrll be a great race,
as Rawles is a remarkable runner
in this event and he will be forced
to do his best by such men as
Walker, Sheehan, and McNamara,
California Freshmen who have
good records and are reliable per
formers.
The mile run is the first event,
and Stanford has but three entries
opposed to seven men from Califor
nia. Bradford is a new man who
has improved rapidly and will be
a strong contender. Fergusson is
not in the best of condition and his
showing is somewhat uncertain.
Keyes and Newberry are probably
the best of the California milers.
Stanford is not remarkably strong
in the half-mile, but none of the
California men have made any ex
ceptional time, so the outcome is
uncertain. Bradford, Coonan and
llichardson are probably the
strongest Cardinal entries. With
Fergusson in condition Stanford
had expected to capture the two
mile, but he has been sick recently
and can not be depended upon to
morrow. Morell has done good
work recently and has a fair chance
to take points.
With Peaslee, Swickard and
Gregg in the hurdles Stanford
should about divide the points, al
though California claims a first
place man in Covvles, who has done
fast time. The jumps are uncer
tain from a Stanford standpoint,
except in the case of Rawles, who
should take a place in the broad
jump. Hall is practically sure of
winning the high jump. The pole
vault is an event in which Stan
ford is not depending on making
any points. Stolz has a chance to
place, as California's vaulters are
not particularly high-class. Ford,
Owen, and McCowen should take
the majority of the points in the
weights.
