Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As a result of the work of souve
nir collectors at the JuniorFarcelast
night the Class of 1907 will be put to
considerable unneccessary expense,
unless those who took the stage
"properties" will kindly return
them. In all the local productions
most of the stage fittings have to
be borrowed. If this practice of
souvenir collecting is continued it
will lead to a complete refusal on
the part of everyone to loan their
property for stage setting. The
following is a partial list of the
articles taken last night, which
will be thankfully received at room
18 Encina Hall: —A Stanford pen
nant, a Cornell pennant, a Rippon
College pennant, an ash-tray, and
a white yoke. A Senior.
