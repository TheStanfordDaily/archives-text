With the first game of the inter
collegiate series a week away,
neither Lanagan nor McCarthy
have announced the personnel of
their teams. On the Stanford nine
the battery positions are still un
settled and three Freshmen are
running a close race for 'center
field. The remainder of the posi
tions are filled, barring accidents.
Should Theile pitch, Captain Sales
will he played in the outfield. Stan
ford's chances this year are very
bright and the Varsity should break
the hoodoo which has hung over
Cardinal nines since the series of
1898.
One week from to-morrow Stan
ford and California will meet on
the Varsity diamond in the first
game of the intercollegiate series of
1906. Stanford, with an experi
enced coach and a veteran team,
has turned out the fastest and most
evenly-balanced nine that has rep
resented the Cardinal for many
seasons. California, from her show
ing in preliminary games, seems to
have a team which is below her
usually high average.
Stanford has the advantage this
year of starting off the series on
her home grounds, and this alone
should prove a great help. The
most hopeful sign in the outlook,
however, is the sudden batting
streak developed by the Varsity
stickers. For the last five prelim
inary games the Varsity has ham
mered the opposing pitchers hard,
and in this department of the game
it should surpass California. Both
teams have veteran infields and
fast men in the outer gardens, so
that the fielding should be an even
break. On the bases, thanks to
Lanagan's careful coaching, Stan
ford should have the best of it.
A comparison of the batteries is
a more difficult matter, as neither
coach has definitely selected his
men. Captain Sales is a veteran
of three intercollegiate series, and
Theile this season has made a bril
liant record in preliminary games.
California has no great twirlers of
the class of Overall and Heitmuller,
so that unless Reinkardt and New
man develop unexpected form,
