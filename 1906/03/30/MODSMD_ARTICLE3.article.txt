With the first game of the inter
collegiate series a week away,
neither Lanagan nor McCarthy
have announced the personnel of
their teams. On the Stanford nine
the battery positions are still un
settled and three Freshmen are
running a close race for 'center
field. The remainder of the posi
tions are filled, barring accidents.
Should Theile pitch, Captain Sales
will he played in the outfield. Stan
ford's chances this year are very
bright and the Varsity should break
the hoodoo which has hung over
Cardinal nines since the series of
1898.
One week from to-morrow Stan
ford and California will meet on
the Varsity diamond in the first
game of the intercollegiate series of
1906. Stanford, with an experi
enced coach and a veteran team,
has turned out the fastest and most
evenly-balanced nine that has rep
resented the Cardinal for many
seasons. California, from her show
ing in preliminary games, seems to
have a team which is below her
usually high average.
Stanford has the advantage this
year of starting off the series on
her home grounds, and this alone
should prove a great help. The
most hopeful sign in the outlook,
however, is the sudden batting
streak developed by the Varsity
stickers. For the last five prelim
inary games the Varsity has ham
mered the opposing pitchers hard,
and in this department of the game
it should surpass California. Both
teams have veteran infields and
fast men in the outer gardens, so
that the fielding should be an even
break. On the bases, thanks to
Lanagan's careful coaching, Stan
ford should have the best of it.
A comparison of the batteries is
a more difficult matter, as neither
coach has definitely selected his
men. Captain Sales is a veteran
of three intercollegiate series, and
Theile this season has made a bril
liant record in preliminary games.
California has no great twirlers of
the class of Overall and Heitmuller,
so that unless Reinkardt and New
man develop unexpected form,
Stanford should have the best of it
in the box. With two veteran
catchers either of whom is capable
of playing a strong game behind
the bat, as opposed to California's
Varsity substitute of last year, the
advantage in this position seems to
lie with the Cardinal.
The Stanford team has still two
preliminary games to play. To
morrow - morning in Oakland it
meets the fast St. Mary's nine and
on April sth it plays the sixth
game of the Santa Clara serieß. Of
the thirteen preliminary games al
ready played, the Varsity has won
seven and lost six. It has, how
ever, taken two straight games
from Santa Clara and has won the
last four games played. Rain has
seriously interfered with the pre
liminary contests, six of them hav
ing been called off on account of
wet weather.
All of the fourteen men from
whom the final nine will be picked
have had considerable baseball ex
perience. Captain Sales has pitched
in the last two intercollegiate series
and Stott was behind the bat last
year. Theile and Daily were sub
stitute battery on last year's Var
sity and both have won their class
numerals. In the infield Presley,
Bell and Fen ton won their Varsity
emblems last season and Sampson
captained his class team this year.
In the outfield, Chalmers and
Dudley are both veterans, and the
three Freshman candidates for cen
ter field. Owen, Cadwalader and
Woodbury, all played on the 1909
team. The umpire for the series
has not yet been chosen. The game
will be called at 2:30.

With the first game of the inter
collegiate series a week away,
neither Lanagan nor McCarthy
have announced the personnel of
their teams. On the Stanford nine
the battery positions are still un
settled and three Freshmen are
running a close race for 'center
field. The remainder of the posi
tions are filled, barring accidents.
Should Theile pitch, Captain Sales
will he played in the outfield. Stan
ford's chances this year are very
bright and the Varsity should break
the hoodoo which has hung over
Cardinal nines since the series of
1898.
One week from to-morrow Stan
ford and California will meet on
the Varsity diamond in the first
game of the intercollegiate series of
1906. Stanford, with an experi
enced coach and a veteran team,
has turned out the fastest and most
evenly-balanced nine that has rep
resented the Cardinal for many
seasons. California, from her show
ing in preliminary games, seems to
have a team which is below her
usually high average.
Stanford has the advantage this
year of starting off the series on
her home grounds, and this alone
should prove a great help. The
most hopeful sign in the outlook,
however, is the sudden batting
streak developed by the Varsity
stickers. For the last five prelim
inary games the Varsity has ham
mered the opposing pitchers hard,
and in this department of the game
it should surpass California. Both
teams have veteran infields and
fast men in the outer gardens, so
that the fielding should be an even
break. On the bases, thanks to
Lanagan's careful coaching, Stan
ford should have the best of it.
A comparison of the batteries is
a more difficult matter, as neither
coach has definitely selected his
men. Captain Sales is a veteran
of three intercollegiate series, and
Theile this season has made a bril
liant record in preliminary games.
California has no great twirlers of
the class of Overall and Heitmuller,
so that unless Reinkardt and New
man develop unexpected form,
Stanford should have the best of it
in the box. With two veteran
catchers either of whom is capable
of playing a strong game behind
the bat, as opposed to California's
Varsity substitute of last year, the
advantage in this position seems to
lie with the Cardinal.
The Stanford team has still two
preliminary games to play. To
morrow - morning in Oakland it
meets the fast St. Mary's nine and
on April sth it plays the sixth
game of the Santa Clara serieß. Of
the thirteen preliminary games al
ready played, the Varsity has won
seven and lost six. It has, how
ever, taken two straight games
from Santa Clara and has won the
last four games played. Rain has
seriously interfered with the pre
liminary contests, six of them hav
ing been called off on account of
wet weather.
All of the fourteen men from
whom the final nine will be picked
