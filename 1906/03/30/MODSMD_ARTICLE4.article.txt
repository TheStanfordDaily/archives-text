# 1907 PRESENTS FARCE
## "STANFORD—THE LIFE STRENUOUS" PRODUCED BY JUNIORS. Musical Comedy by W.G. Bateman, '07, Staged by Amateurs Last Night. 
### 
The junior farce, "Stanford —the
Life Strenuous," was presented last
evening before a good sized and ap
preciative audience, and on the
wliole may truly be said to have
been successful. A good bit of
effort was shown on the part of W.
G. Bateman, '07, who not only
wrote the book and score, but took
an active part in the staging of the
play and drilling the chorus.
Although as a composer Bate
man was hardly productive of any
striking or tuneful melody,yet at
times his music had a rapid move
ment and proved quite effective.
His music, however, was essentially
instrumental rather than operatic
or vocal. One ensemble number,
"The Stanford Varsity," which
opened the third act, was clever,
both in the idea it expressed and
the way it was sung; and it received
by far a greater amount of applause
than any of the others. The Palm
Maiden octette was very prettily
sung and staged; the woodland
costumes and dancing aided it
largely iri bringing forth a hearty
encore. In the first act the Pipe
Song was also done well, proving
quite a pleasing number. The re
maining solo work was poor, it be
ing hard to see how some of the
singers secured their assignment.
Quite unconsciously, Huggins, '09,
afforded no end of amusement to a
rather indulgent audience. The
dramatic action of the piece opened
the first act briskly, and brought
forth some amusing situations, but
fell considerably after this, especial
ly in the last act, where nothing was
done by the plot but match off the
engaged characters in a rather con
ventional and awkward manner.
Among the players, Miss. C. C.
Pedlar '07, and R. S. Kellogg, '07,
easily carried off the honors of the
evening. Miss Pedlar is naturally
talented and had decidedly the
moat pleasing stage presence and
personality of any of the actresses
last flight. It was only to be re
gretted that more was not given her
to do. Kellogg, who for several
times past his proven himself the
best character comedian now in
Stanford dramatics, did exception
ally well with the part of Harry
Careless, getting out of it all the
possibilities it contained. J. M.
Ward, '07, who played the silver
stealing hero, worked hard at his
part, but seemed rather miscast, for
the humor of the rendition of his
lines seemed rather forced. The
girls' lead was played acceptably
by Miss H. I. Moise, though at
times her enunciation and reading
was a trifle loud and pronounced.
The minor characters were fairly
well taken by the remaining mem
bers of the cast. Several hitches
in the performance showed the need
of more thorough and continued
coaching. But Stanford audiences
overlook defects due to lack of time.
