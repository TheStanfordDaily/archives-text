To-morrow for the first time in
the history of athletics at Stanford
and California will Freshman
teams representing the two univer
sities meet upon the track. The
institution of an additional inter
collegiate Freshman contest will
afford followers of the respective
Varsity track teams a means of
comparison of the Freshman ma
terial and will give both sides a
chance of figuring with considera
ble accuracy on Freshman influ
ence in the big meet. But far above
this consideration is the fact that
the new men who train faithfully
but whose performances do not
justify the trainer and captain in
giving them a place on the inter
collegiate team are given an op
portunity of meeting men of an.
other university in a contest in
which both the honor of the class
and of their college is at stake.
