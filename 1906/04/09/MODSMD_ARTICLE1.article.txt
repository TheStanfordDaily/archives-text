# Stanford Wins on Diamond Freshmen Lose Track Meet
## CALIFORNIA GETS SHUT OUT Presley Scores Cardinal's Only Run by Clever Base Running. Sales Pitches Great Game. 
### 
In a nine-inning pitchers' battle
between Sales and West, Stanford
blanked California and took the
first game of the Intercollegiate
series by a score of 1 to 0. The
Varsity'e lone tally came in the
third inning as the result of some
heady work on the bases by Pres
ley. The Cardinal first-baseman
was on third when Sampson
knocked a high foul down the first
base line. Graham, West and
Schaeffer all started after the ball,
and the former caught it. Before
he could recover and throw to the
plate, Presley had scored what
proved to be the winning run.
Stanford outhit California about
three to one and would have ham
mered West harder but for fast
work in the Blue and Gold outfield,
which cut off at least four prom
ising hits. In the field there was
little to choose between the work of
the two teams, although the Car
dinal infield worked a shade more
smoothly than their opponents.
On the bases Stanford had slightly
the better of it.
But it was in the work of the
batteries that the Varsity's superi
ority was most marked. Sales
pitched the game of his career, fan
ning eight men and allowing two
hits, both of the scratch variety.
The Cardinal captain also led his
team in the hitting, making two
clean singles out of three times at
bat. Stott caught a good game
and allowed only one Btolen base.
West pitched steady ball hut was
hit hard.
The game was not marked
by any brilliant plays. Fenton

made one clever stop of a bad
grounder, and Sampson, Bell and
Presley handled everything that
came their way. Dudley was the
only Cardinal outfielder to get a
chance and he captured his two
Hies easily. The whole California
team played a good fielding game,
but was decidedly inferior in its
stick-work to last year's nine.
California was first at bat. Ileid
struck out and Heister flew to Dud
ley. Jordan was hit but died on
first, when Graham hit to Sales,
In Stanford's half Bell was out.
Sampson took first, being hit by
West. He went to second on
Graham's error and took third on
Fenton's out. Owen ended the
inning by flying to Causley.
Neither team got a man on base
in the second. In the third, Gunn
reached first when Stott dropped
hi* third strike. West hit a fast
grounder to Sales, who caught Gunn
at second. Sampson completed
the double by a fast throw to first.
Reid walked and stole second but
Heister fouled to Fenton. In
Stanford's half came the first run
I of the game. Presley and Sales
singled. Bell beat out a bunt and
Sampson fouled to Graham, Pres
ley scoring on the catch. Fenton
went out Gillis to Graham, and
Owen fanned.
In the fourth California made
her only bid for a run. Jordan
singled and took third when Gra
ham interfered with Presley's throw
to Bell. Causley was up, and Mc-
Carthy signalled hit and run from
the bench. Sales guessed the play

SUMMARY.
Stolen bases—Presley, Fenton,
Reid. Double play —Sales to

Sampson to Presley. Bases on
balls —off Sales 1, off West 2. Hit
l>y pitcher — Sampson, Jordan.
Struck out —by Sales 8, by West 5.
Passed ball — S.chaeffer. Wild
pitch —Sales.
Time of game—l hour, 45 min
utes. Umpire —Johnson.
In a nine-inning pitchers' battle
between Sales and West, Stanford
blanked California and took the
first game of the Intercollegiate
series by a score of 1 to 0. The
Varsity'e lone tally came in the
third inning as the result of some
heady work on the bases by Pres
ley. The Cardinal first-baseman
was on third when Sampson
knocked a high foul down the first
base line. Graham, West and
Schaeffer all started after the ball,
and the former caught it. Before
he could recover and throw to the
plate, Presley had scored what
proved to be the winning run.
Stanford outhit California about
three to one and would have ham
mered West harder but for fast
work in the Blue and Gold outfield,
which cut off at least four prom
ising hits. In the field there was
little to choose between the work of
the two teams, although the Car
dinal infield worked a shade more
smoothly than their opponents.
On the bases Stanford had slightly
the better of it.
But it was in the work of the
batteries that the Varsity's superi
ority was most marked. Sales
pitched the game of his career, fan
ning eight men and allowing two
hits, both of the scratch variety.
The Cardinal captain also led his
team in the hitting, making two
clean singles out of three times at
bat. Stott caught a good game
and allowed only one Btolen base.
West pitched steady ball hut was
hit hard.
The game was not marked
by any brilliant plays. Fenton

made one clever stop of a bad
grounder, and Sampson, Bell and
Presley handled everything that
came their way. Dudley was the
only Cardinal outfielder to get a
chance and he captured his two
Hies easily. The whole California
team played a good fielding game,
but was decidedly inferior in its
stick-work to last year's nine.
California was first at bat. Ileid
struck out and Heister flew to Dud
ley. Jordan was hit but died on
first, when Graham hit to Sales,
In Stanford's half Bell was out.
Sampson took first, being hit by
West. He went to second on
Graham's error and took third on
Fenton's out. Owen ended the
inning by flying to Causley.
Neither team got a man on base
in the second. In the third, Gunn
reached first when Stott dropped
hi* third strike. West hit a fast
grounder to Sales, who caught Gunn
at second. Sampson completed
the double by a fast throw to first.
Reid walked and stole second but
Heister fouled to Fenton. In
Stanford's half came the first run
I of the game. Presley and Sales
singled. Bell beat out a bunt and
Sampson fouled to Graham, Pres
ley scoring on the catch. Fenton
went out Gillis to Graham, and
Owen fanned.
In the fourth California made
her only bid for a run. Jordan
singled and took third when Gra
ham interfered with Presley's throw
to Bell. Causley was up, and Mc-
Carthy signalled hit and run from
the bench. Sales guessed the play

SUMMARY.
Stolen bases—Presley, Fenton,
Reid. Double play —Sales to

Sampson to Presley. Bases on
balls —off Sales 1, off West 2. Hit
l>y pitcher — Sampson, Jordan.
Struck out —by Sales 8, by West 5.
Passed ball — S.chaeffer. Wild
pitch —Sales.
Time of game—l hour, 45 min
utes. Umpire —Johnson.
In a nine-inning pitchers' battle
between Sales and West, Stanford
blanked California and took the
first game of the Intercollegiate
series by a score of 1 to 0. The
Varsity'e lone tally came in the
third inning as the result of some
heady work on the bases by Pres
ley. The Cardinal first-baseman
was on third when Sampson
knocked a high foul down the first
base line. Graham, West and
Schaeffer all started after the ball,
and the former caught it. Before
he could recover and throw to the
plate, Presley had scored what
proved to be the winning run.
Stanford outhit California about
three to one and would have ham
mered West harder but for fast
work in the Blue and Gold outfield,
which cut off at least four prom
ising hits. In the field there was
little to choose between the work of
the two teams, although the Car
dinal infield worked a shade more
smoothly than their opponents.
On the bases Stanford had slightly
the better of it.
But it was in the work of the
batteries that the Varsity's superi
ority was most marked. Sales
pitched the game of his career, fan
ning eight men and allowing two
hits, both of the scratch variety.
The Cardinal captain also led his
team in the hitting, making two
clean singles out of three times at
bat. Stott caught a good game
and allowed only one Btolen base.
West pitched steady ball hut was
hit hard.
The game was not marked
by any brilliant plays. Fenton

made one clever stop of a bad
grounder, and Sampson, Bell and
Presley handled everything that
came their way. Dudley was the
only Cardinal outfielder to get a
chance and he captured his two
Hies easily. The whole California
team played a good fielding game,
but was decidedly inferior in its
stick-work to last year's nine.
California was first at bat. Ileid
struck out and Heister flew to Dud
ley. Jordan was hit but died on
first, when Graham hit to Sales,
In Stanford's half Bell was out.
Sampson took first, being hit by
West. He went to second on
Graham's error and took third on
Fenton's out. Owen ended the
inning by flying to Causley.
Neither team got a man on base
in the second. In the third, Gunn
reached first when Stott dropped
hi* third strike. West hit a fast
grounder to Sales, who caught Gunn
at second. Sampson completed
the double by a fast throw to first.
Reid walked and stole second but
Heister fouled to Fenton. In
Stanford's half came the first run
I of the game. Presley and Sales
singled. Bell beat out a bunt and
Sampson fouled to Graham, Pres
ley scoring on the catch. Fenton
went out Gillis to Graham, and
Owen fanned.
In the fourth California made
her only bid for a run. Jordan
singled and took third when Gra
ham interfered with Presley's throw
to Bell. Causley was up, and Mc-
Carthy signalled hit and run from
the bench. Sales guessed the play
