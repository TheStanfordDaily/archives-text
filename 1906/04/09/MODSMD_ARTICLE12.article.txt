## Several Students and Faculty Member Thrown from Steeds. 
### 
Dr. Leon Lewis of the Law de
partment was severely thrown from
his horse while riding in Golden
Gate Park, San Francisco, last Sun
day afternoon. A physical exam
ination disclosed noserious injuries,
though it is feared that he may be
injured internally. He will be
taken to the Guild Hospital for an
expert examination to-morrow.
G. B. McLain, '07, while riding
last Tuesday, was thrown from his
horse and was badly cut and lacer
ated about the face. McLain was
unconscious for twelve hours after
his accident and at one time it was
doubtful if he would recover. It
was necessary to take twenty-six
stitches in one of the many cuts
about his face McLain was about
to-day.
Miss A. S. Hayes, '06, and Miss
E. L. Officer, '07, were thrown
from a carriage in which they were
driving last Thursday, but sustain
ed no injuries. That both young
ladies were not killed is a miracle,
as their horse, taking fright at an
automobile, turned around, upset
ting the carriage and violently
hurling the young ladies into the
street. Both young ladies are
members of the Pi Beta Phi sorority.
