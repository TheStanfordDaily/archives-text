# Will Not Hold Ball in New Gym.
## 
### 
The Senior claps will not be
permitted to hold their ball in the
new gymnasium as they hoped.
The Board of Trustees, which met
on March 31st, refused to grant
the petition presented by the class
asking for the new building. The
trustees are not ready to accept the
building yet from the contract
ors, although all the work is prac
tically finished, and they fear that
the use of the dancing hall could
be legally held by the contractors
to be a token of acceptance.
A place has not vetheen determin
ed wherein to hold the ball, but the
choice rents between Encina club
room and the new skating rink
recently opened in Palo Alto.
