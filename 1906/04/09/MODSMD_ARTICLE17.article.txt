### 
Cardinal Anti-Saloonists Defeat the
California Team. â€”Stuntz, ? 07,
Wins Oratorical Contest.
The Stanford Prohibition debat
ing team, consisting of Miss Mary
Balcomb, '06, and B. E. Long, '07,
easily defeated the team from the
University of California, composed
of S. II. Beach and E. L. Lord, in
the intercollegiate Prohibition Lea
gue debate held in Mullen's Hall,
Palo Alto, March 31st.
Miss Balcomb, '06, opened the
debate on the affirmative for
Stanford, with a well organized ar
gument. She was followed by S.
H. Beach for California, who had
a nicely balanced speech but lacked
in force and delivery. B. E. Long,
'07, was the best speaker of the
evening, his delivery being in pleas
ing contrast to thatof his opponent.
E. L. Lord was forced to read his
speech, destroying almost entirely
any good effect it might have.
Marshall Black,ex-'97, Professor
H. A. Millis of the Economics de
partment, and Miss Lulu M. Mayne
of the University of the Pacific, were
the judges.
Stuntz Wins the Oratorical Contest.
W. 0. Stuntz, '07, won the ora
torical contest of the Prohibition
Leagues of Northern California,
on March 30th. His subject was
"The Need of the Hour," and he
proved himself the superior of both
his opponents, who were S. H.
Beach of the University of Califor
nia, who talked on the "Ethics of
Prohibition," and B. G. Lipsky of
the University of the Pacific, who
took for his subject, "Public Opin
ion and the Liquor Problem."
On Saturday morning, W. E.
Counter, '09, addressed the temper
ance convention on the need of
unity among the temperance forces,
and on Sunday evening John G.
Wooley talked on the "Reasonable
ness of Temperance."
