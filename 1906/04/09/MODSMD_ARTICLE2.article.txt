The iirst Intercollegiate Fresh-:
man track meet, held at Berkeley,
Saturday, March 31st, was won by
the University of California by the
score of to The Stanford
I athletes were outnumbered two to
one, yet in spite of this great hand
icap and the muddy, slow track, they
did exceedingly well, capturing the
relay race with a team of men
every one of whom had already
competed in two or three events,
and securing points where the most
hopeful had conceded defeat. The
deplorable condition of the track,
and the cold wind caused the slow
time in all of the events.
Bradford Places in the Mile.
Bradford, a gritty Freshman,

started the day well by capturing
third place in the mile against a
large field of California runners.
Bradford was the only Stanford
entry in tins event, and his pres
ence averted a ridiculous situation
and prevented a farcical conclusion
to the race, for California had eight
entries.
Holman a Surprise in the Hundred.
Another surprise was sprung in
i the final of the 100-yard dash,
j when Holman secured third place
i from Captain Rawles. The miser
able condition of the track prevent
ed fast time. Stanton was looked
upon by California as a sure win
ner in the sprints, and he justified
their certainty b} r easily taking
both the 100- and 220-yard dashes.
The severe turns on the curves at
either extremity of the track always
handicap Stanford sprinters in the
1220- and 440-yard dashes, and
Rawles' inability to take the miser
able turn in the 220-yard dash
which resulted in his placing third
i shows how problematical these two
dashes are, for without experience
a good runner may be outclassed
by an inferior sprinter who is ac
i customed to the track.
Third Place in the High Hurdles.
Peaslee secured third in a hard
struggle in the 120-yard hurdles.
Gregg unfortunately got tangled
up in the fourth hurdle but finish
ed gamely a foot behind Peaslee.
Rawles a Fast Quarter-Miler.
Captain Rawles lived up to his
reputation in the 440-yard dash by
winning the race against a large
field. Considering the heavy track,
the sharp turns and the stiff wind,
Rawles'time of 55.1 seconds must
be considered excellent time. Coon
an's sensational finish in second
place ahead of Walker of Califor
nia upset all calculations, for Cali
fornia had pinned great hopes to
Walker, whom many declared
would win.
Morell the Two-Mile Star.
The finest exhibition of the Stan
ford spirit of determination was
evidenced by Morell, who won the
two-mile run against a fast field.
The finish of this race was the most
sensational and exciting of the day.
Gaines and Lang, California's en
tries, set the pace after Fergusson
of Stanford relinquished the lead at
the end of the first mile. After the
sixth lap the two Califomians hard
pressed by Morell only remained
to fight out the contest. Morell
tenaciously clung to the wearers of
the Blue and Gold and retained his
position close up to the runners
until the eighth lap, when he lag
ged behind until a distance of 20
feet separated him from the first
man. This distance was recovered
in the last lap by a beautiful sprint
which put him in second place and
left Gaines far behind. Morell drew
abreast of Lang on the stretch, sev
enty-five yards from the finish, and
held this position to within five
feet of the tape, when with a final
spurt he dashed across, winning by
about two feet.
Swickard a Surprise in the Hurdles.
Swickard took second place in
the low hurdles, only two feet be
hind Cowles, a reputably fast hurd
ler. Peaslee, as in the high hurdles,
took third.
Coonan Places Again.
A further evidence of Coonan's
remarkable grit was exhibited in
the half-mile, when he took third
after a most gruelling quarter.
The Field Events.
California secured 2G£ and Stan
ford 18£ points in the field events.
In the hammer-throw Owen and
Ford took first and second. This
advantage was offset in the pole
vault, where California secured
nine points. The shot-put also went
to Ford. With a jump of 20 feet
inches, Stolz won the broad
jump. In the high jump Stolz se
cured one half of a point by tying
for third with Paul of California.
On the jump-off Stolz won. Capt
ain Hall of California won this
event with a jump of 6 feet 2 inches.
He failed to clear 6 feet 4 inches,
but came dangerously near it in
one trial.
Stanford Wins Relay.
As is generally the case, the relay
race was won by Stanford. Peas
lee, Gregg, Swickard, Holman and
Rawles won handily in 3:80 4-5.
Captain Rawles ran the last lap.
This victory in the relay came as a
surprise to Califomians and show
ed the gritty spirit of the Cardinal
Freshmen, who had already severe
ly tested their endurance in other
events.
Stanford sent more than 300
rooters to the meet.
