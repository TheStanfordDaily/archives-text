The iirst Intercollegiate Fresh-:
man track meet, held at Berkeley,
Saturday, March 31st, was won by
the University of California by the
score of to The Stanford
I athletes were outnumbered two to
one, yet in spite of this great hand
icap and the muddy, slow track, they
did exceedingly well, capturing the
relay race with a team of men
every one of whom had already
competed in two or three events,
and securing points where the most
hopeful had conceded defeat. The
deplorable condition of the track,
and the cold wind caused the slow
time in all of the events.
Bradford Places in the Mile.
Bradford, a gritty Freshman,

started the day well by capturing
third place in the mile against a
large field of California runners.
Bradford was the only Stanford
entry in tins event, and his pres
ence averted a ridiculous situation
and prevented a farcical conclusion
to the race, for California had eight
entries.
Holman a Surprise in the Hundred.
Another surprise was sprung in
i the final of the 100-yard dash,
j when Holman secured third place
i from Captain Rawles. The miser
able condition of the track prevent
ed fast time. Stanton was looked
upon by California as a sure win
ner in the sprints, and he justified
their certainty b} r easily taking
both the 100- and 220-yard dashes.
The severe turns on the curves at
either extremity of the track always
handicap Stanford sprinters in the
1220- and 440-yard dashes, and
Rawles' inability to take the miser
able turn in the 220-yard dash
which resulted in his placing third
i shows how problematical these two
dashes are, for without experience
a good runner may be outclassed
by an inferior sprinter who is ac
i customed to the track.
Third Place in the High Hurdles.
Peaslee secured third in a hard
struggle in the 120-yard hurdles.
Gregg unfortunately got tangled
up in the fourth hurdle but finish
ed gamely a foot behind Peaslee.
Rawles a Fast Quarter-Miler.
Captain Rawles lived up to his
reputation in the 440-yard dash by
winning the race against a large
field. Considering the heavy track,
