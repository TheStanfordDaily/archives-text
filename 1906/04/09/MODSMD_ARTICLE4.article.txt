Stanford has reason to feel
proud of her athletic teams who
have competed with the University
of California within the past week.
The most sanguine Cardinal sup
porters predicted decisive defeat for
the Cardinal first-year men. Yet
in the face of glaring odds, and
with a team outnumbered two to
one, the Stanford Freshmen worked
hard to overcome the severe handi
cap, and their excellent showing
demonstrated that they are built of
the right material and that they
are men whom Stanford may well
feel proud to have represent her.
The showing was most creditable,
and the gritty up-hill fight merited
the constant and generous applause
which more than 300 Stanford
supporters gave them.
The expectations of Stanford
men were fulfilled when the base
ball team won the first game of the
intercollegiate series. The men
composing the victorious nine have
the additional honor of administer
ing the first shut-out ever inflicted
upon a California team.
The victorious team deserves a
great deal of credit for having over
come the " hoodoo" which has
clung tenaciously to the Cardinal
for about eight years. Stanford
men can show their appreciation
of the work Coach Lanagan has
accomplished no better than by
sending the largest Stanford dele
gation ever seen on the California
campus next Saturday to cheer the
Stanford team when they meet the
Blue and Gold in what will prob
ably be the last game of the series.
