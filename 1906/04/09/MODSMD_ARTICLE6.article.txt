The team of star athletes from
the Olympic Cluh of San Francisco

meet Saturday morning by the
score of 8 to 6, only first places be
ing counted. The track was fast
and the weather tine, which ac
counts for the remarkably fast
time in all events, two Coast rec
ords being broken. Connelly of
the Olympic Club whs the star of
the day, establishing a new Coast
record in the two-mile race. He
ran this distance in 9:51.1, which
is nineteen seconds better than has
been done on this Coast, the for
mer record of 10:10 being made by
Hunter of the Olympic Club in
1893. E. J. Nash, '07, was the on
ly other competitor in the two-mile
who had any chance whatever.
Connelly set a terrific pace, making
the first mile in 4:51, and Nash
was forced to drop behind after
five laps. Nash's time was 10:24.3,
which is two seconds better than
the Stanford record already held
by him. The mile relay, run by
a five-man team with standing
touch, was run in 3:21, setting a
new Coast record. Rawles, Free
man, Davis, McNeil and Elwell
composed the winning team.
In the hurdles Powell, the old
California star, showed a flash of
his old time speed and ran the high
hurdles in 15.4, with Horton a
close second. Both Macfarland and
Horton beat Powell in the low hur
dles, which were run in 0:25.4. Al
though he did not run a good race
in the mile, Miller, '08, showed up
