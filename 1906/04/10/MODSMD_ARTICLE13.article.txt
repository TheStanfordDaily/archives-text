# Preceptorial System a Success.
## 
### 
The preceptorial system of in
struction which has been tried at
Princeton for one term has been
declared a success. According to
this plan the students are divided
into small groups, each group under
the care of a separate tutor. The
quality of the work done has im
proved and there has been less
cramming than under the old
methods. The work has also been
done more thoroughly and with a
greater display of interest on the
part of the students.
