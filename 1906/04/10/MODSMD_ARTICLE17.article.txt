# New Course at California.
## 
### 
A unique organization has been
formed at California, as among
many other American and Europe
an universities, for the study of
"Esperanto," the new universal lan
guage invented by Dr. Zemenhof of
Warsaw, Poland. The chief rec
ommendation of the new language
is its extreme simplicity, it being
claimed that the grammar, which
has no exceptions to the rules, can
be learned in an hour. The secret
of Esperanto is the Esperanto key
by means of which anything writ
ten in the novel language can be
translated at once. It is said a
Chinese and Hottentot might read
each other's letters with as much
ease as we read English. Twenty
six periodicals are already being
published in Europe in Esperanto.
