# THE 						MARCH "ALUMNUS."
## Issue Contains Up-to-date Items and Articles of Interest to Undergraduates. 
### 
The March number of the Stan
ford Alumnus is full of up-to-date
article√ü bearing on Stanford gradu
ate and undergraduate life. The
chief editorial is a comment upon
the hopeful view for Lhe Univeri
ty's future expressed by Professor
William James in his Founder's
Day address. The Alumnus is
heartily in accord with the senti
ments of Professor James: "Let
Stanford not fear to be eccentric to
the end, if need be. Let her not
imitate, lei her lead, not follow."
The alumni can afford to wait to
cultivate the ideals of Stanford,
and while waiting, are urged to use
their influence in the right direc
tion. The editorial closes quoting
Professor James: ''It rests with the
devotion and sympathetic insight
of the growing body of graduates to
prolong the vision where the
Founder's vision terminated, and
to insure that all succeeding steps,
like the first steps, shall single out
this University more and more as
The University."
An article of primary interest to
all Stanford men and women is a
review of Stanford's track and lield
athletes by Trainer Moulton, in
cluding the principal men who
have figured in intercollegiate field
meets since he became trainer. The
number contains an exposition of
the "Stanford Duennial Reunion
Scheme," followed by the letter
sent out by the Class of 1906, invit
ing the Classes of 1896, 1901 and
1904 to reunite on the campus next
May. The plans for the celebra
tion of Alumni Day, May 22d, are
outlined. The scheme is explained
in full bv the chairman of the
Alutnni Reunion Committee.
