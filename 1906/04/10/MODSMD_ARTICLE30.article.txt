To the members of the student body
of Stanford University:
We respectfully call your atten
tion to the fact that Sword and
Sandals will present in Assembly
Hall, April 20th, Shakespeare's
comedy, "Two Gentlemen of Ve
rona."
The society is giving this play
for the benefit of the University
Band, which is in debt to the stu
dent body. The proceeds of the
performance will be turned into the
student body treasury on the
Band's account, and should in this
way be a very material aid in the
construction of the new track.
The cast will comprise the best
talent of the University. Rehear
sals under careful coaching have
been held steadily for a period of
over two months, thus assuring a
well finished production. A feat
ure of the comedy will be a seren
ade to "Sylvia" rendered by a male
quartette and accompanied by
stringed instruments.
The seat sale will begin Monday,
April 16th, at the University Book
store, and at the Stanford Phar
macy in Palo Alto. All seats re
served, prices 50 and 75 cents. The
object of the society in giving this
play seems eminently worthy, and
your attendance will be greatly ap
preciated. Respectfully,
Sword and Sandals.
