the majority of the stock.
The left end of the store is occu

Drawing department, the architect,
who planned the store with great
forethought and taste, scrupulously
attending to details. Room is al
lowed for expansion, as the south
end is not occupied, and the build
ing was constructed so that a gal
lery could be put at the back when
increased business may demand it.
