# INTERCLASS CONTEST
## TRACK MEET TO-MORROW AFTERNOON WILL BE CLOSE. Sophomores Probably Have Best Chance of Winning Championship on the Track and Field. 
### 
The annual interclass track meet
will be held to-morrow afternoon
at 3 o'clock. Most of the men are
now in first-class condition, and
there are sure to be some first-class
races to-morrow. In both the quar
ter and half-mile events several
fast men are entered, and the point
winners are difficult to pick. If
the present good weather continues
there should be some very fast time
made. The relay promises to be
the race of the day, as as least the
three lower classes will have strong
teams entered.
