One of the most useful organiza
tions of the University is the Ger
man Club. This organization does
not figure very prominently before
the college public, but none the
less it is doing a great work for the
German department. Its meetings
are held regularly every Saturday
night, which is oftener than any
other society of the college meets,
and its members feel it either a
duty or a pleasure to come to its
meetings. Thus the men and
worm n who are doing German
work come to know each other well,
and through their intimate associ
ation a great deal of good is ac
complished. Their personal rela
tions with the members of the Ger
man faculty are strengthened and
made pleasant, and more interest
is thus injected into the scholarly
work they have in hand. Nor is
the good work of the club confined
to indoors. The members and the
faculty have widened their social
relations by picnics and other out
door amusements and have estab
lished a happy family circle in a
small way. Since the once boasted
social relations between students
and faculty at Stanford have now
practically ceased to exist, the ex
ample set by the members of the
German Club might well be fol
lowed by the majors in other de
partments.
