# SENIOR CLASS MEETS
## PLATE TO CONTAIN NAMES OF GRADUATES IN YEAR 1906. Alumni Reunion Will Not Be Held at Stanford Residence.â€”Place To Be Determined Later. 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior class
held to day it was decided that all
men and women completing their
college woi kin the calendar year
of 1906 are entitled to sign the
parchment roll to be placed in the
class plate. Following this decis
ion a resolution was passed that all
desiring their names in the plate
must pay the two dollar assessment
levied at the last meeting of the
class. Consequently all who make
their hours in May, September or
next December are to be considered
as mem hers of the 1900 class. H.
I. Cruzan of the managing commit
tee of the Permanent Alumni Asso
ciation reported that as a conse
quence of the previous indecision,
many letters are being received
from members of the classes of
1896, 1901 and 1904, who were re
cently invited to participate in a
reunion this year as guests of the
Class of 1906, inquiring as to what
provision is to be made for those
not graduating in May of the re
spective years. It was brought out
forcibly by a number of speakers
that many of the real 1906 men,
those who have always identified
themselves with the Senior class
and have done effective work in
football, track, and in debate, are
not going to graduate in May for
various reasons. It was the view
of the class that cognizance should
be taken of the real loyalty and at
titude of those who have been
known as seniors, irrespective of
the time when they will receive
their diplomas. A report from the
Registrar's office showed that those
graduating next September and
December, if not allowed to sign
the 1906 roll, will have no chance
to sign at all.
The use of the grounds around
the Stanford residence has been re
fused President Sales by Treasurer
Lathrop since no organization will
be allowed to use the grounds this
year. The reunion will be held,
however, but definite arrangements
as to time and place will be made
later by the Senior Week commit
tee.
A class secretary is to be ap
pointed by President Sales, whose
duty it will be to keep a card cata
logue of all the members of the
Senior Class, in which their future
addresses and items of interest con
cerning them may be recorded.
This secretary will receive fifty dol
lars which has been voted by the
class, out of which the necessary
expenses of the position will be de
frayed.
