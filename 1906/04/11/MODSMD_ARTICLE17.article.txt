# Working One's Way.

One of the most novel new books
of the day is entitled " Over One
Hundred Ways to Work One's
Way Through College." The hook
was written by Selby A. Moran, a
teacher in the Ann Arbor, Michi
gan, High School. The writer, the
son of poor parents living on a
farm in a western state, early de
veloped a strong desire to obtain a
college education. He resolved to
succeed. After saving a little money
he arrived at one of our best uni
versities with less than ten dollars
in his pocket. By determined,
persistent effort and by practicing
the moat rigid economy, he paid
his entire college expenses and
graduated with his class. He
found many others in school who
were working their way through
college like himself. The idea
came to him that a book explain
ing the various methods by which
young men and women worked
their way through college would
be helpful to those who must earn
an education or go without it. He
at once began to make note of all
these different ways of earning an
education which came under his
observation. The result iB a very
instructive and interesting book.
Over a hundred simple and prac
tical ways are mentioned and
actual instances given of young
people, each of whom has earned a
college education, and many of
whom have, later in life, attained
great distinction and honor. Every
young man or woman who really
wants a college education, and does
not have the necessary means,
should send one dollar to the Uni
versity Press, Ann Arbor, Michi
gan, for a copy of this book.
