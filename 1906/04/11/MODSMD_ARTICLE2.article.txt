# SOCIAL SERVICE PLAN DISCUSSED.
## Dean Hodges and Chaplain Gardner Tell of Need for Settlement Work and Workers. 
### 
The fourth student body Assem
bly of the semester was held in As
sembly Hall this morning at 11:15.
Social Service was the general topic
discussed by the two speakers,
Dean Hodges and Chaplain Gard
ner. In the absence of President
Jordan, Vice - President Rranner
presided and introduced the
speakers.
Dean Hodges made the first ad
dress, choosing for his subject "So
cial Ideas and Social Betterment."
He said in part:
"The college idea of social settle
ment was begun in England about
twenty years ago by graduates of
Cambridge and Oxford, who found
ed a settlement in the East End
slums of London. The idea came
over toAmerica and spread through
out the country, until to-day there
are over two hundred settlements
in the larger cities. The purpose
of the work is to bring the privi
leged to the service of the unprivi
leged by the method of neighborly
acquaintance. The best expression
concerning it is that it is a bridge
between rich and poor,—not afreight
bridge for second-hand clothing
and money, but a passenger bridge
for the strengthening of social ties.
The political questions and contro
versies between rich and poor may
be bettered by mutual understand
ing.
''The method of social settle
ment work is that of neighborly
acquaintance. There is no hamp
ering by bonds of constitution or
by-laws. There is no losing of
energy by attention to details. Set
tlement work is perfectly simple.
It follows no prearranged program,
but the work is successful from the
very fact that it is simple and na
tural. The work is also scientific,
following the Aggassiz method of
observing actual things and setting
clown what is discovered.
"The workers devote themselves
to first-hand investigation of condi
tions in their neighborhood. They
desire to know the life and needs

of the community. They study
bow these needs may he satisfied.
They enter into the politics of the
neighhorhood, and t hey come to un
derstand why the respectable ele
ment fails when it tries to gain
votes from the boss.
"Here at Stanford you enjoy pri
vileges than which there are none
more abundant anywhere. And in
proportion to these privileges you
should feel more responsibility.
Social service offers the natural,
pleasant and effective means of dis
charging that responsibility."
Dean Hodges was followed by
Chaplain Gardner. As an intro
duction to his speech on "Social
Settlement in the University" Dr.
Gardner paved high tribute to the
work of the Dean at Stanford dur
ing the three months of his stay
here. He then went on to speak of
the social service settlement. He
said in part:
"Social service gives succor to
the oppressed, clothing to the nak
ed, and food to the hungry. It
brings the idea, ho often expressed
by President Boose velt, of the
'square deal' all around. It is part
of the spirit of this University.
Stanford itself was founded as a
monument to this idea.
"I can give you no finer examples
of true social service than the con
duct of the student body during
the typhoid epidemic two years
ago. The Guild Hospital and the
Y. M. C. A. employment bureau
are living examples of the Stanford
spirit translated into social service.
"The newly organized social club
has for its ultimate idea the found
ation of the Stanford settlement in
San Francisco. This idea will prob
ably find its concrete expression at
some time in the future. Mean
while each one can do his share in
his own state of life. There is ample
opportunity everywhere, especially
for college people. It restH with
you, young men and women, to
solve the social problems of the
United States."

"Here at Stanford you enjoy pri
vileges than which there are none
more abundant anywhere. And in
proportion to these privileges you
should feel more responsibility.
Social service offers the natural,
pleasant and effective means of dis
charging that responsibility."
Dean Hodges was followed by
Chaplain Gardner. As an intro
duction to his speech on "Social
Settlement in the University" Dr.
Gardner paved high tribute to the
work of the Dean at Stanford dur
ing the three months of his stay
here. He then went on to speak of
the social service settlement. He
said in part:
"Social service gives succor to
the oppressed, clothing to the nak
ed, and food to the hungry. It
brings the idea, ho often expressed
by President Boose velt, of the
'square deal' all around. It is part
of the spirit of this University.
Stanford itself was founded as a
monument to this idea.
"I can give you no finer examples
of true social service than the con
duct of the student body during
the typhoid epidemic two years
ago. The Guild Hospital and the
Y. M. C. A. employment bureau
are living examples of the Stanford
spirit translated into social service.
"The newly organized social club
has for its ultimate idea the found
ation of the Stanford settlement in
San Francisco. This idea will prob
ably find its concrete expression at
some time in the future. Mean
while each one can do his share in
his own state of life. There is ample
opportunity everywhere, especially
for college people. It restH with
you, young men and women, to
solve the social problems of the
United States."
