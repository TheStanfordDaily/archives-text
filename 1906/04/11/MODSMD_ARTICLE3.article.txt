# CREWS HARD AT WORK
## OARSMEN GETTING INTO FORM FOR BIG REGATTA. Varsity Is Developing Good Speed. Freshmen Appear to Be in a Slump. 
### 
During the vacation the oarsmen
have been rowing entirely on the
slough at Redwood. The weather
has been rough and unfavorable to
good work, but the crews have been
ont every day and are steadily
rounding into shape for the big re
gatta.
The Varsity four, rowing with
R. H. Conant, '08, stroke ; J. R.
Pemberton, '08, No. 3; F. Zimmer
man, '07, No. 2; L. R. Gay, '08,
bow, and F. W. Turner, '08, cox
swain, is in fine condition and
rowing in the best of form. These
men have been in the first boat
nearly two weeks and have begun
to swing together and show speed
in a manner which is satisfactory
to Coach Murphy.
Thestroke which Murphy has been
endeavoring to drill into the Car
dinal oarsmen is rowed nearly
perfectly by the Varsity men, but
the Freshmen seem to be having
some difliculty in mastering it.
The 1909 crew appears to he suffering
from a slump, and is not rowing
as well as Murphy expected they
would at this time. To remedy
this defect the coach has had two
of the rowing machines transferredto
the boat-house at Lagunita and is
giving the Freshmen personal in
struction to bring them into form.
By next week Murphy expects to
have finally selected both the Var
sity and Freshman crews. There
will be one substitute for each four.
