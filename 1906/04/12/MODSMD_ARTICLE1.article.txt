# WILLROW WASHINGTON
## STANFORD VARSITY WILL MEET NORTHERNERS MAY 30th. Oarsmen Will Go North to Row on Lake Washington After College Closes. 
### 
Negotiations between Stanford
and Washington for a regatta be
tween the varsity crews of the two
Universities to be held on Lake
Washington, May 30th, were closed
by Manager Barrett to-day. The
Stanford oarsmen will leave im
mediately after the close of college
and will keep light training from
the time of the intercollegiate re
gatta until the northern contest.
The honors of the former contests
between Stanford and Washington
are about evenly divided. In the
regatta last year over the Sausalito
course the Washington varsity de
feated the Stanford four by a close
margin,and in thethree-cornered re
gatta at Seattle later, the Cardinal
Freshmen won from the northern
first-year men. The race between
the varsities in the Seattle contest
turned out to be rather unsatisfac
tory, the Washington boat sinking
before it crossed the line.
This year Stanford will have a
stronger, heavier, and faster crew,
to meet the Washington men. and
the race should be close and inter
esting all the way.
To accommodate the oarsmen
who are now working at Redwood
City and who do not return until
the 7:15 train, a training-table at
which the men will take dinner
every day until the intercollegiate
regatta has been installed in
Blake's restaurant in Palo Alto.
