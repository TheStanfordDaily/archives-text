It has become the vicious custom
of certain students to take as souve
nirs anything transportable from
the stage of the Assembly Hall
after class and university produc
tions. After the recent production
of the Junior Farce various articles
were removed from the stage which
have not been returned. The farce
committee bad an itemized list of
the stolen property printed in the
Daily Palo Alto before tbe vaca
tion, in the hope that the party or
parties in possession of the goods
would return the same when their
value was announced. No response
has been received to the communi
cation and for a second time the
management calls for the return of
the properties.
In another column the Junior
Prom, committee asks for the return
of goods stolen from Encina Hall
the night of the 1907 class dance.
This state of affairs must be la
mented. It seems impossible that
students will carry the vicious
habit of collecting souvenirs to the
extreme of taking that for which
the management indirectly respons
ible, and for which the class must
pay unless thearticles are returned.
This final appeal should cause the
return of every article of stolen
property to both the Junior Farce
and Junior Prom, committees.
