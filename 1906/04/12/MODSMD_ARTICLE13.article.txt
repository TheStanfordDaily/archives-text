# REVISE CONSTITUTION
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE PASSES ON PROPOSED CHANGES. Many Amendmends Offered for Government of Student Body.—Vote at Annual Meeting Wednesday. 
### 
The Executive Committee last
night considered in detail many
important changes in the student
body constitution recommended by
the committee on revision, consist
ing of R. W. Barrett,'o4, chairman,
C. F. Laumeister, '07, and J. C.
Macfarland, '07, which was ap
pointed some time ago. Of the
many proposed changes, but one
failed of approval by the Executive
Committee. The changes will be
presented at the annual meeting of
the student body next Wednesday.
The Executive Committee has not
the power of ultimate decision on
proposed changes. It merely has
the power of passing opinion on
them. This was the action taken
last night.
The changes follow below in de
tail, but in summary they are as
follows:
Beginning October 15, 1906, a
legitimate member of the Associated
Students shall be defined as one
who has paid up in full all student
body assessments.
The student body Treasurer
shall hereafter be known as the
Graduate Manager. The salary of
the Graduate Manager shall be
"$l2OO per year and traveling
expenses," whereas his remunera
tion was formerly "$lOOO a year
and railroad fare." A more care
ful supervision of the Manager's
accounts shall also be made by the
Executive Committee than hereto
fore and, in general, a more careful
supervison over all the affairs of
this office.
The Athletic Committee shall be
abolished, and the Executive Com
mittee shall take over its functions
of awarding emblems and exercise
a supervision of athletics.
For the Training House Corpor
ation shall be substituted a body
known as a Board of Control, which
shall assume direction of improve
ments on athletic fields and the
like, in conjunction with the Exec
utive Committee and the Graduate
Manager.
The qualifications for editor of
the Daily Palo Alto and the Se
quoia are defined more fully than
before, and it was also proposed
that one manager shall direct both
these publications. This latter
proposal was the only one which
failed of approval by the Executive
Committee.
Nominations for elective student
body officers must hereafter be
made at least twenty-four hours
before the time of election, and no
person shall be considered a candi
date for office unless thus regularly
nominated.
But fifty per cent of the net sur
plus in the student body treasury
at the end of each year shall here
after be applied to a sinking fund
for athletic improvements, instead
of seventy-five per cent as before.
There shall be paid into the
Woman's Athletic Association for
permanent improvements the full
sum of regular assessments paid by
the women. But fifty per cent of
the regular assessments paid by
women was formerly turned into
their own athletic treasury.
