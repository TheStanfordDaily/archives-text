# Collectors Steal at Junior Prom.
## 
### 
A number of punch glasses, sil
ver spoons, and several pitchers
were stolen at the Junior Prom,
which was held in Encina Hall the
30th of last month. The loss of
these articles will mean consider
able pecuniary loss to the Junior
class if the stolen articles are not
returned, and those who had charge
of the dance are anxious that the
class should not suffer for the bene
fit of the collectors. The purloined
articles may be left in room 120
Enina Hall during the next week.
