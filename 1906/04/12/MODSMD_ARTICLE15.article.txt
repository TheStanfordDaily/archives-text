Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the last issue of the Daily
Palo Alto just preceding vacation,
a request was made for the return
of the various pennants, stage fit
tings, etc. taken by members of the
cast andchoruswho desired souve
nirs of the performance. The
property taken was borrowed from
various people on the campus, and
so far has not been returned.
Owing to the fact that all the stage
fittings have to be borrowed for
local productions, the practice of
souvenir collecting, if allowed to
go on, will lead to a refusal on the
part of every one to lend their be
longings for the purpose of stage
productions. The offenders, on this
occasion, are known to the com
mittee, who request that the three
pennants in question — 1 Cornell, 1
Rippon, and 1 Stanford Varsity
pennant —be returned either to the
Delta Upsilon house or to room
18 Encina, as soon as possible.
Otherwise further steps will be
necessary. H. I. Cruzan.
