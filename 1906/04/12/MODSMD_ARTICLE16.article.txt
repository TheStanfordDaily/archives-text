# ENGLISH CLUB MEETS
## PROF. STEPHENS ADDRESSES A LARGE AUDIENCE. "The Poetry of Kipling," the Subject of Interesting Lecture by Distinguished Reader. 
### 
Professor Henry Morse Stephens
of the history department of the
University of California addressed
the members and friends of the
English Club last evening at the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon house. Pro
fessor Stephens lectured on " The
Poetry of Rudyard Kipling," a sub
ject on which he is admirably fitted
to speak, since he has made a
study of the development of Kip
ling as' seen in his poems. Pro
fessor Stephens spoke especially of
Kipling's volume of poems entitled
"The Five Nations." From this
volume and from two others Pro
fessor Stephens read several poems,
in a manner that kept the audience of
over one hundred guests spell
bound with delight. While at Cor
nell he was a charter member of
the first Kipling club organized in
America.
The next regular meeting of the
English Club will be held on April
22nd, at which there will be a re
union of the casts of the two Eliz
abethan plays which were staged
for the English Club by Professor
L. E. Bassett, '01. Mr. Bassett has
been asked to give a Tennyson
reading at that time.
