# ALUMNI BADLY BEATEN
## MORSE'S AGGREGATION LOSES TO VARSITY 15 TO 2. Chalmers and Bell Make Three-Baggers.—Sales and Witmer Pitch. 
### 
In a long drawn out game Stan
ford defeated "Brick" Morse's
alumni aggregation 15 to 2.
Hughes, who pitched for Oakland
High laHt year and who was later
tried out in the Coast League, was
chiefly responsible for the Varsity's
hig score. He allowed fourteen
hits, walked eleven men, hit three
and made two wild pitches. This
coupled with seven errors by the
Alumni gave Stanford fifteen runs.
Bell and Chalmers both smashed
out three-baggers, the latter scoring
on his drive because of slow hand
ling in relaying the throw.
Both Sales and VVitmer twirled
good ball, the former allowing
three and the latter five hits.
Cadwalader was played in Samp
son's place after the fifth. The
detailed score follows:
