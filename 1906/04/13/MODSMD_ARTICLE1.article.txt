# TO BANQUET TRUSTEES
## STANFORD CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO TO BE HOST. Undergraduates Invited to Attend Dinner in Honor of Board of Trustees. 
### 
On Friday evening, April 20th,
at 7 o'clock, the evening before the
field meet, the Stanford Club of
San Francisco will give a banquet
to the Trustees of the University.
This is the second banquet the
■Stanford Club has given, the one
last year at the University Club
the night preceding the track meet
being the first. This is the first af
fair of its kind in the history of the
University to be given to the Trus
tees. In view of the fact that the
Trustees only recently took active
charge of the University, the ban
quet bears particular significance.
Charles K. Field, '95, is to be
toastmaster. He was toastmaster
at the decennial reunion luncheon
held on the campus last year dur
ing Commencement weel<, and is
one of the prominent speakers and
wits of the Bohemian Club. While
in college Field was prominent in
literary lines, being on the editorial
boards of the Daily Palo Alto,
Sequoia and of the first number of
the Quad. One tenth of all the
memorable Stanford songs ever
written are attributable to Field,
especially "Stanford Red," "The
Little Vendome" and the Alumnus
verße of "One, Two, Three, Four,"
which still retain their popularity.
Since leaving college he has con
tinued his literary efforts and has
recently published a book of verse.
The other speakers have not yet
been announced.
The committee having the ban
quet in charge is as follows: Henry
H. Taylor, '00, J. F. English, '01,
E. W. Prentice, ex-'O4, and L. S.
Beedv, '98, president of the Stan
ford Club of San Francisco, who is
an ex-officio member.
Unless illness or previous en
gagements prevent, it is expected
that the following trustees will be
present: Samuel F. Leib, president,
Horace Davis, vice-president, Chas.
G. Lathrop, treasurer and business
manager, Geo. E. Crothers, secre
tary, Timothy Hopkins, Chas. P.
Eells, Thomas B. McFarland, Geo.
E. Gray, Frank Miller and Wil
liam Babock. The remaining Trus
tees, among them Whitelaw Reid,
minister to England, either live in
the East or are abroad.
The dinner will take place at the
University Club. It is not restrict
ed to alumni and trustees, but un
dergraduates and faculty are urged
to come whether they receive in
vitations or not. It has been
impossible, of course, to send in
vitations to everybody, but the
committee extends such an invita
tion through the Daily Palo Alto
to all those that it has been unable
to reach through invitations. The
dinner will be $4 a plate.
