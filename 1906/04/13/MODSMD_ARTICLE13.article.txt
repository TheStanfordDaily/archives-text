# HEALTH OF BOSTON TECH MEN.
## Interesting Report Made by Medical Inspector Franklin W. White. 
### 
An extremely interesting report
is that recently made by the
medical adviser of the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology.
This office was establishad some
two years ago at the suggestion of
President Pritchett, and to it waß
appointed Dr. Franklin W. White,
a graduate of the institute and of
the Harvard Medical School. Dr.
White entered upon his work with
zeal and intelligence, and there
suits were most satisfactory, says
the Boston Evening Transcript.
Not only does he maintain office
hours during which he may be con

suited without expense, but, in ad
dition to this, at the beginning of
each year he gives a few plain,
straightforward talks upon person
al hygiene, whieh have proved of
great value, and which, together
with his visitations, have brought
him into intimate relations with
the student body.
At the suggestion of President
Pritchett, Dr. White undertook, a
year ago, a somewhat extended in
vestigation of the physical condi
tion of the last two graduating
classes, with the purpose of deter
mining what the physical status of
the men was at the time of gradua
tion. Dr. White gives in his re
port the list of questions which lie
sent out and the nature of the
replies which were received, dis
closing not only the character of
the daily work of the students and
of their living, but also furnishing
information as to the amount of
work done during the vacation
period. Briefly stated, the result
of his inquiry is to show that in
these two senior classes nearly two
thirds of the men were never absent
a day, that only about ten per
cent had an illness of any im
portance during their four years'
course in the institute, and that
with few exceptions the men
finished in good physical condition.
Dr. White's report is valuable for
many reasons, but particularly as
showing that where ill health has
resulted it has come almost wholly
from either a neglect of physical
exercise, a deficiency in the amount
of sleep, or some other violation of
the laws of hygiene. Such neglect
of hygienic laws ought to be greatly
diminished in consequence of the
provision now made for lectures,
reference to which has already
been made; and the inference to be
drawn from this report seems to be
that for a normal, healthy boy the
amount of work required is no
greater than he may reasonably be
expected to do. Another result of
Mr. White's examination is to
emphasize the need of cheap and
comfortable quarters for that part
of the student body which now
lives under poor conditions in a
quarter of the city not favorable
for social life, and many of whom
obtain their board where either in
sufficient or poor food is provided.
Referring to that part of Dr.
White's report which deals with his
work of consultation, it is noted
that a large number of conditions
were treated, the most numerous
being surgical diseases, digestive
disturbances, diseases of the nose
and throat and of the eyes. About
a dozen men were suffering from
severe illness, such as appendicitis,
typhoid fever, and Bright's disease,
which were given appropriate treat
ment. Two men had to leave the
institute on account of pulmonary
tuberculosis, and two on account of
heart disease. The majority of the
illnesses were acute and promptly
curable. A small number of stu
dents were recommended for ad
mission to the Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital, where the institute
has free beds, for the treatment of
such acute diseases as appendicitis,
grip, typhoid, malaria, pleurisy,
etc., while a small number were re
ferred to specialists for treatment
of the eye, ear or skin. The total
number of different students who
have consulted Dr. White is given
as 185, which can scarcely be con
sidered as indicating a large
amount of illness amongst a stu
dent body of some 1600.
