Albert W. C. T. Herre, '04, A.M.
'05, has written a paper on "The
Foliaceous and Fruticose Lichens
of the Santa Cruz Peninsula of
California," which has been pub
lished by the Washington Academy
of Sciences of Washington, I). C , in
the March number of its publica
tion. The editor ranked the paper
very highly and regarded it as a

scholarly, exhaustive, thoroughly
scientific work of superior merit.
The work is of interest to students
of botany especially on account of
the keys, which render the study
of plants simple and plain.
Herre has been engaged in the
study of lichens around Santa Cruz
and Monterey for the last three
years. The first investigation in
this region was made forty years
ago, and since then there have been
several,but unimportant,researches
made, so this work is an important
addition to botanical literature and
sets forth several new specimens.
Herre is now a teacher of biology
in the San Jose Normal School.
