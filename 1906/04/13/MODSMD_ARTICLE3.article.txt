With one game of the intercol
legiate series to her credit, Stan
ford will meet California on the
State University diamond to-mor
row afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. The
Cardinal has played three games
since the 1 to 0 victory last Satur
day, defeating Morse's alumni 15
to 2 and losing twice to St. Mary's,
2 to 0 and 9 to 8 in ten innings. In
the last two games the Varsity has
hit safely twenty-eight times, ham
mering Hughes and O'Banion hard.
Unless they take a sudden slump
in this department of the game, it
is almost safe to predict that West
will not escape as easily as he did
last Saturday.
To offset this gain in hitting,
Stanford will probably be handi
capped by the loss of left fielder
Chalmers, who tore the ligaments
of his ankle sliding into first in
yesterday's game. Chalmers has
been confined to his bed all day,
but may possibly recover sufficient
ly by to-morrow afternoon to get
into the game. In case he is un
able to play his place will be taken
by either T, R. Cadwalader, '09, or
J. G. Woodbury, '09. In either
case the team will not be weakened
in the field or on the bases, but
neither Cadwalader or Woodbury
have hit as consistently at Chal
mers, and his loss would weaken
the hitting of the Varsity.
The result of to-morrow's game
will depend largely on the pitching
of Captain Sales. Last week the
Cardinal twirler pitched the game
of his career, and scored the first
shut-out in the history of the inter

collegiate Beries. Against the
alumni thin week Sales twirled for
three innings, allowing only three
hits and funning five men. Against
St. Mary's, however, a double, a
single, and a three-bagger were
scored off his delivery in the second
inning. If Sales pitches the game
to-morrow that he did a week ago
Stanford should , win easily, but
should the Cardinal captain have
an off day, the outcome of the game
is problematical. In case Sales is
unable to pitch, Theile will fill his
place in the box.
California will play the same
line-up as that of last week's de
feated team, except that Newman
may be in the box in placeof West.
The Blue and Gold nine defeated
the alumni team 9 to 4 on Tuesday
afternoon, hitting Hughes almost
as hard as Stanford did on Wednes
day. Left-fielder Jordan, who
wrenched his knee in the first inter
collegiate game, has recovered and
will play to-morrow.
The game will be played at 2:30
and " Youneey " Johnson will
handle the indicator. The Uni
versity Band will play on the
Stanford bleachers at the game.
