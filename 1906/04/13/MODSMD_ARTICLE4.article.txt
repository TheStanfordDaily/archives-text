# Button's Wrong Initials Submitted
## 
### 
Through an unfortunate error on
the part of California the initials
of the freshman crew captain were
given as A. L. instead of E. D.
Button, and unleßS Stanford con

sents to rectify the error he will be
unable to row with the crew. Col
onel Edwards has written to Dr.
Angell concerning the matter and
is in hopes that it can be arranged
satisfactorily. A number of mis
takes have happened because of
the improper submission of the
names of candidates, a case in
point being that of A. E. Roth, '09,
and sever«l other Stanford men
who could not take part in the re
cent Freshman track meet because
their names had been inadvertently
omitted from the list of eligibles.
At a late hour this afternoon Dr.
Angell stated that Button will be
allowed tocompe.teagainst Stanford.
