In addition to the regular work of a business college, AYRES is main
taining a Normal Department, and the demand for our teachers last
year was far in excess of our supply. The salaries are from $70 to $125
per month. €J In case you do not care to teach, or prefer another posi
tion, there is nothing that will expedite your university course like
shorthand. University students have completed this course in three
months. Write at once to Normal Dept. for further information.
