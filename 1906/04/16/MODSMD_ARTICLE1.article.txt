# TRY-OUTS COMPLETED
## GOWAN AND CASSELL WILL BE DOUBLES TENNIS TEAM. Gowan and Delano Will Play the California Singles Men.—Berkeley Representatives Not Yet Selected. 
### 
The tennis team that will face
the California representatives on
the Encina courts next Saturday
morning was finally selected last
Saturday when J. F. Cassell, '07,
and A. J. Gowan, '09, won the try
outs for the doubles team. Gowan
and Delano will play the singles
against the first and second Cali
fornia players, and immediately
after the second singles match
Gowan and Cassell will meet the
Blue and Gold doubles team.
There were four teams entered in
the doubles competition Saturday,
and aided by one default the
matches were finished rapidly.
Gowan and Cassell were closely
pressed by Newland, '08, and
Mann,'o9, in the final round, but
won out after losing the second set
and several games in the third.
The winning team lobbed consist
ently and Gowan was particularly
strong in his overhead work at
the net.
It is not yet determined who will
be the California representatives,
but the state university has good
material to draw from and will un
doubtedly put a very strong tenm
upon the courts. Crippled by the
loss of G. A. Hodge, '06, it would
seem as if Stanford had little more
than a good fighting chance against
the more experienced players who
will wear the Blue and Gold.
The summary of play in the
doubles try-outs is as follows:
First round —A. J. Gowan, '09,
and J. F. Cassell, '07, defeated P.
B. Delano, '08, and F. Parton, '09,
6-2, 8-6. L. Newland, '08, and H.
Mann, '09, defeated W. H.Swavne,
'07, and R. Gott, '09, by default.
Final round —Gowan and Cassell
defeated Newland and Mann, 6-2,
6-8, 7-5, 6-3.
