# CAST IS ANNOUNCED
## PARTS IN SHAKESPEAREAN COMEDY WELL TAKEN. Production of April 20th Will Be Great Success,â€”Seat Sale Commenced To-day. 
### 
Sword and Sandals has an
nounced the cast of the "Two Gen
tlemen of Verona" to be given on
April 20th, and each part will be
taken by an actor or actress whose
histrionic ability has already won
applause from Stanford audiences.
The part of Proteus, the fickle
lover, is perhaps the part requiring
the heaviest work, and J. C. Ray,
'07, has undertaken it. Ray is
well known to Stanford theatre
goers, having made a tremendous
success as Sir Anthony Absolute
in the "Rivals," the 1907 Sopho
more play. Ray has also been
seen in numerous other perform
ances, and in every case has carried
his part well.
D. D. Sales, '06, will have the
part of Valentine. Sales acted the
role of David Garrick in the 1906
Sophomore comedy of the same
name, and showed brilliant work.
Launce and Speed, the providers
of laughter in the comedy, have
had their parts taken by E. R.
May, '06, and R. S. Kellogg, '07,
respectively. May and Kellogg
have seldom been equaled here in
comedy work. May was first seen
as Humphrey in the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle" three years
ago. Since then he has been prom
inently identified with the majori
ty of the performances here. Kel
logg's first appearance here was as
Bob Acres in last year's "Rivals,"
and he was very successful in that
role. In various other productions
since the "Rivals" Kellogg has in
variably scored a hit.
J. M. Ward, '07, will be seen in
the role of Antonio, and such have
been his previous appearances that
there can be no doubt as to his
ability to act his part now with the
greatest success.
Thurio will be represented by F.
H. Bernard, '07, whose clever work
has before brought him much
praise. J. E. Stewart, '06, will
have the Duke's part, and M. A.
Gunst, '08, will appear in Panthi
no's role.
To Miss Nora K. Dunn, '06, has
fallen the part of Silvia, one of the
most dainty and charming charac
ters in the "Two Gentlemen of Ver
ona." Miss Dunn had the part of
Connie Pell in the Senior farce of
last May, and her acting was of
such a quality as to win her a high
place in the ranks of Stanford ac
tresses.
Miss Aurania Ellerbeck, '08, will
carry the part of Julia in the com
edy. Miss Ellerbeck's inimitable
performance of Miss Hardcastle's
part in "She Stoops to Conquer" is
still fresh in the minds of all who
saw the recent Sophomore play.
Elizabeth L. Officer, '07, will have
Lucetta's part.

To Miss Nora K. Dunn, '06, has
fallen the part of Silvia, one of the
most dainty and charming charac
ters in the "Two Gentlemen of Ver
ona." Miss Dunn had the part of
Connie Pell in the Senior farce of
last May, and her acting was of
such a quality as to win her a high
place in the ranks of Stanford ac
tresses.
Miss Aurania Ellerbeck, '08, will
carry the part of Julia in the com
edy. Miss Ellerbeck's inimitable
performance of Miss Hardcastle's
part in "She Stoops to Conquer" is
still fresh in the minds of all who
saw the recent Sophomore play.
Elizabeth L. Officer, '07, will have
Lucetta's part.
