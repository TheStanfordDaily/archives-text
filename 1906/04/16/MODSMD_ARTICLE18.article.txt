# CLUB-ROOM FOR BALL
## SENIOR COMMITTEE REQUESTS USE ON MAY 21ST. Tickets Will Cost Five Dollars. Plan to Number Carriages Is Favored. 
### 
'Jf'he Senior Ball committee to
day submitted an application to
the Business oflice for the use of the
Encina club-room for the Senior
Ball on Monday evening, May 21st.
This action was determined upon
at the last meeting of the commit
tee, at which many details were
arranged. The price of a ticket
will be $5, and twenty-one dances
will constitute the ball, great pains
being taken to make the occasion
perfect in every detail. A new
plan for expediting carriage service
following the dance is now under
discussion, and from present indi
cations will, in all probability, be
adopted. It is proposed to assign
a number to every carriage in
use, and to place all the vehicles in
charge of a director. When a
guest at the ball desires his car
riage he will tell the director the
number, and the latter will call the
driver by this means. This system
of having a man to superintend the
crowd of carriages is in practice in
places where a great number of
carriages must approach the en
trance of a building and move out
quickly, and has been proven a
success —notably on opera nights
in large cities.
The music will probably be ren
dered by Brohaska's orchestra,
which showed its efficiency at
the Junior Prom. As many
popular college tunes and Stan
ford songs will be used as is
practicable. The dances will be
arranged so that half will be waitzes
and half two-steps. Japanese lan
terns will be used as part of the
decorations, particularly in the
hallway near the entrance and in
front of Encina, so that the part of
the Hall around will present the
appearance of a fete. The comit
tee has sent to prominent caterers
in San Francisco, notifying them
that bids will be received for sup
plying supper, which will be served
between the ninth and eighteenth
dances, approximately. Compli
mentary tickets will be presented
only the president of the class and
the members of the ball commit
tee.
