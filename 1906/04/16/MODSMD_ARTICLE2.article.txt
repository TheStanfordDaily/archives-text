# INTEREST IN AMENDMENTS.
## Original Proposal to Change Management of Papers Withdrawn. Edwards Advances Another. 
### 
Much interest has been aroused
over the proposed change in the
method of managing the Daily
Palo Alto and the Sequoia. The
original proposal made by the
revision committee of the Execu
tive Committee to put both pub
lications under one man has been
withdrawn and will not be present
ed to the student body at all. P.
C. Edwards, '06, has advanced
another amendment which is post
ed on the bulletin-board. Edwards
proposes to establish a standing
committee to be known as the Com
mittee on Publications, to be com
posed of three seniors or graduate
students elected by the student
body, and two members of the
faculty chosen by the student mem
bers; this committee to be elected
annually and to have full power to
elect or remove, at their discretion,
a joint manager for the two papers,
or separate managers for each.
