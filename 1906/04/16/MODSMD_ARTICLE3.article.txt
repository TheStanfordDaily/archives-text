# CALIFORNIA WINS SECOND GAME
## Blue and Gold Defeats Varsity 4 to 3 on State University Diamond. 
### 
A third game will be necessary
to decide the intercollegiate series.
On Saturday afternoon, on herown
diamond, California won the second
game by a score of 4to 3. Stan
ford started off with a rush, scoring
three runs in the first two innings,
and sending West to the bench, lie
was followed by freshman Rhein
hard, who pitched a steady game.
California then began to hit Sales,
and had scored their four runs by
the sixth inning.
Stanford outhit California, but
all the baseball luck was on the
side of the Blue and Gold, and it
was this element which won the
game. The two or three close de
cisions made by Umpire Johnson
all favored California, and one of
them cost the Cardinal a run:
Owen was at the bat with two
strikes and three balls. liheinhard
threw a ball that appeared to all
the bleachers far too high, but John
son called it a strike and sent Owen
to the bench. A moment later
Sales knocked out a three-bagger
which would have scored Owen
easily.
Chalmers was unable to get into
the game on account of his injured
ankle. His place was taken by
Cadwalader, who played good ball
in the field but did nothing at the
bat. Sales did not pitch as brilli
ant a game as he did a week ago.
Seven hits,including two three-bag
gers, weresecured from his delivery.
Stanford landed hard on West
in the first inning. With one out
Stott walked. Fenton singled,send
ing him to second, and he scored on
Owen's hit. Sales knocked a long
fly and Fenton scored from third.
There was some dispute as to the
run, California claiming that Fen
ton left his base before the ball was
caught. Lanagan requested that
he be sent back to third, but John
son had not seen the play and re
fused to change his decision.
In the second, Dudley lined out
a three-bagger and scored an Samp
son's single. This ended Stan
ford's scoring.
Rheinhard replaced West after
this inning and pitched an effective
game, being especially steady with
men on bases. Six safe hits were
made from his delivery and twice
there were two Cardinal runners on
the bases, but the Blue and Gold
twirler, aided by clever work in the
outfield, shut off any further scor
ing.
In the third a triple by Svveesy
and a single by Rheinhard scored
California's first run. Reed sacri
ficed Rheinhard to second but Bell
made a sensational catch of Cans
ley's liner and retired the side by a
pretty double play.
In the fourth Graham lined out
a three bagger and scored on
Schaeffer's hit. Another double

play, Owen to Presley, ended the
inning. 111 the sixth Kenton and
Owen singled, but no run was
scored. In California's half, Reed
singled hut was thrown out at sec
ond on Causley's grounder. Jor
dan walked and Graham was hit
by pitcher. Schaeffer singled and
Causley and Jordan scored. This
ended the run getting.
In the eighth, after Owen had
been struck out on a very question
able decision, Sales knocked a
three-bagger but died on third. In
the ninth, Presley and Sampson
were easy outs. Bell lined a long
hit between left and center but was
tagged out at third on the relay.
Managers Barrett and Decoto
will meet to-night to set the time
and place for holding the third
game. Under the intercollegiate
agreement it should be played
April 28th. The two weeks added
training will work great hardships
on the baseball men and Barrett
hopes to be able to play the game
this week.
