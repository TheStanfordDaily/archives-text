Saturday's baseball game in
Berkeley was disgraced by scenes
of rowdyism and muckerism worse
than any which have ever character
ized an intercollegiate contest with
in recent years. Any Stanford
student who attended the game
knows how the California rooters
howled and hooted and jeered at
the Stanford pitcher and captain,
how attempts were made to dis
tract the attention of the Stanford
catcher when he was endeavoring
to catch a foul, and how this row
dyism was encouraged and even
instigated by the California base
ball coach. Stanford does not com
plain at the mere loss of the game,
which is a small matter. The point
is this: that such scenes were a dis
grace to the great University of
California, the conduct of whose
students at athletic contests in the
past has been almost uniformly
free from such occurrences. It is
exceedingly unfortunate that Cali
fornia students should have placed
so black a blot upon their record.
But the man upon whom rests
the greatest guilt is the California
yell leader, who had entered into a
tacit agreement that there should
be no jeering, an agreement which
Stanford lived up to at both games
of the present series. We are glad
to see that the Daily Californian
to-day, in the following ably writ
ten editorial, disavows and con
demns the action of the California
rooters:
"Saturday's game was a good one,
but the ideals of clean sportsman
ship were not advanced very ma
terially. California's rooters, for
the most part, forgot themselves
and behaved like a bunch of south
of Market street fans. It is not the
right thing to rattle the opposing
pitcher, and every square-minded
undergraduate knows it. Stan
ford's team was our guest at the
game and ordinary hospitality
should have prevented the 'mucker
ism' that was displayed. Sales'
pitching was seriously interfered
with by the continued yelling which
was directed at him â€”that was evi

dent. That alone should have in
duced the California rooters to
desist; hut despite all that Yell
Leader De Leon could do, the root
ers continued to sink deeper and
deeper into the mire of muckerism.
The Stanford rooters acted like
gentlemen. Their numbers were
few and ours were many; their
team played a clean game and the
Cardinal certainly deserved more
considerate treatment at our
hands. The ordinary dictates of
American sportsmanship and the
Bpirit of fair play should have pre
scribed honorable treatment to a
visiting nine, and to handicap our
guests by rattling their pitcher is a
distinct blot on the name of Cali
fornia. Coach McCarthy told the
bleachers to yell at the pitcher.
Coach McCarthy runs the baseball
team. We do not doubt that But
we question his right to regulate
the ethics of California's sports
manship. California must play
fair, all other considerations to the
contrary notwithstanding. We can
win without being muckers. Let's
do it."
The attitude of the editor of the
Daily Calijornian deserves the
highest praise as a manly and
courageous defense of clean sports
manship.
