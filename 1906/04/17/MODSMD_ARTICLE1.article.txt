# SENDS OUT CIRCULARS
## SIMPLIFIED SPELLING BOARD PUBLISHES PLAN. Able Argument for Reform Supported by Examples of Easy Orthography. 
### 
The Simplified Spelling Board,
founded by Andrew Carnegie for
the advancement of the simple and
logical spelling of English words,
and whose members, appointed re
cently, include President Jordan,
Professor George Hempl, the new
ly appointed head of (lie German
department, and Professor William
James, acting professor of the
department of Philosophy, has sent
out two circulars calling attention
to and explaining the need of re
forming English spelling.
Circular No. 1, entitled " A First
Step," is an argument for the sim
plified spelling as proposed hy the
hoard. The point is made that
English " is fitted hy its use as the
medium of the widest commerce
and the most progressive civiliza
tion hy its cosmopolitan vocab
ulary, and hy its grammatical sim
plicity " to " become the dominant
and international language of the
world. No other existing speech,
and none of the proposed artificial
international languages, has the
same adaptability to such a use.
If then, as is certain, the reasonable
and gradual simplification of our
spelling will aid the spread of Eng
lish, with the attendant advance
ment of commerce, of democratic
ideals, and of intellectual and po
litical freedom ; will economize the
time of our school-children and
make their work more efficient ;
and will aid greatly in the cheap
ening of printing, is it not a matter
which appeals to common sense, to
patriotism, and to philanthropy?"
It is shown that many words, not
ably past participles, were formerly
more simple than is preferred at
present, and forms like drift, dropt,
stept, crost, drest, etc., are common
in Milton, Dryden, Pope, Burns,
Byron, Tennyson, Landor, Swin
burne, and Lowell.
Circular No. 2 contains a list of
300 common words now spelled in
two or more ways, all simple spell
ings being in one column. It is
stated that there are forty distin
guishable classes of words. Rules
for simplified spelling of twenty are
given. Persons who mail a postal
to the board at No. 1 Madison
avenue, New York, signifying their
approval of the aims of the board
and agreeing to use the simpler
form as far as may practically be
possible, will have their names
placed on the files of the board, and
will receive the publications as they
appear.
