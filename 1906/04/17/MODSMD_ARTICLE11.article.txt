# MURPHY SELECTS CREW
## STANFORD WILL HAVE FAST VARSITY FOUR. Conant, Pemberton, Zimmerman, Gay and Turner Is Make-up of Final Crew.â€”Washington Will Row. 
### 
Coach Murphy announced to-day
the make-up of the Varsity crew
that will cross oars with the Cali
fornia oarsmen a week from Satur
day. The four will he composed of
the following men: R. H. Conant,
'08, stroke; J. R. Pemberton, '08,
No. 3; F. Zimmerman, '07, No. 2;
L. R. Gay, '08, bow; F. W. Turner,
'08, coxswain. A. N.Cole, '08, and
B. Bryan, '06, will he retained as
substitutes.
Of the crew selected, Conant,
stroke, Gay, bow, and Turner, cox
swain, were members of the fast
1908 crew that defeated Washing
ton and California in the regatta
at Seattle last year. Pemberton at
No. 3 is a new man on the boating
squad, but he has rapidly devel
oped under Murphy, and is now
pulling one of the strongest oars in
the boat. Zimmerman, No. 2, cap
tained the 1907 crew in his Fresh
man year.
The men that will pull the oars
in the Varsity boat are all over six
feet in height, and their weights
average about 175 pounds. They
are in the best of condition and
Murphy expresses himself as satis
fied with their work.
The coach is having no little dif
ficulty in selecting a Freshman
crew. The competition seems now
to have narrowed down to five men:
A. B. Shutts, H. I. Hatch, P. A.
Robinson, R. W. Hornby and S.
B. Dole. S C. Bias will be substi
tuted for Costar in the coxswain's
seat.
The work at Redwood has been
seriously handicapped during the
last two weeks by rough weather
and a heavy sea. The Freshman
crew had a narrow escape recently,
their boat swamping after a hard
pull in rough water, leaving the
exhausted oarsmen to swim for
their lives.
It is decided that the regatta at
Sausalito will lie a three-cornered
affair, Washington sending her
varsity crew to participate in the
contest. Whether the freshmen
from the North will also compete
with the first-year men from Stan
ford and California is not yet
known.
Manager Barrett is making ar
rangements for the officials to have
charge of the regatta, and is also
negotiating to have an observation
train follow the races.
The personnel of California's
varsity crew will lie as follows:
MacFarland, bow; Toiler, No. 2;
Jones, No. 3; Schmidt, stroke; and
Loeb, coxswain.
