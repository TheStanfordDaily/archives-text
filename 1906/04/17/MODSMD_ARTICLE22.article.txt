# ISSUE TRACK "CHAPARRAL."
## Special Number for Intercollegiate Meet Will Be Published Next Friday. 
### 
The special number of the
Chaparral for the intercollegiate
track and field meet next Satur
day will be on Bale at the quad on
Friday morning, the day before the
meet. A full-page photograph of
Track Captain Macfarland will be
run. The front page will contain
a serio-comic poem entitled '"The
Song of the German S," by E. J.
Hadley, '08. The editorials are all
humorous, and deal respectively
with the intercollegiate track meet,
the second baseball game, the
Junior farce, and eulogize the
originator of the Interscholastic
Association. The first editorial is
the feature of Chappie's sentiments.
The second denounces the umpire
and the muckerism of the Califor
nia rooters at the recent intercol
legiate ball game, held at Berkeley,
in scathing terms. The third prom
ises to create a sensation through
its utterances about the chorus m
the 1907 play, while the fourth
forgives a Senior for all of his bo
called mistakes.
The chief prose article is Chap
pie's "dope-sheet" for the track
meet. An announcement is made
purport ng to be of great import
ance to the student body —namely,
that a prominent college man has
joined the ranks of the "qneeners."
An account of the next intercol
legiate Rugby football game is
given in anticipation by L. R.
Weinmann, '06. An ideal skit is
printed by way of reference to the
late Junior farce.
A very funny drawing of the
California truck squad, by M. J.
Helmick, '09, is one of the pictorial
features that have to do with Sat
urday's intercollegiate meet. Verse
is contributed by G. G. Alt
no w, '06, E. .1. Hadley, '08, F.
A. Curtin,'oB, «nd G. F. Morgan,

full-page crayon drawing, entitled
"Stanford Poppies," in this issue.

Ferry, '08, are contributors of art
work. A cartoon called "Before
and After" is drawn by M. J.
Heimick, '09.
