# DEBATERS GET READY.
## Sales, Blair, and Herron Prepare for Contest with California Team. 
### 
With the assistance of graduate
debaters and interested faculty men
the intercollegiate team, composed
of I). 1). Sales, '06, W. L. Blair, '06,
and W. F. Herron, '08, have been
steadily grinding away for the past
month in preparation for the con
test with California next Saturday
night. Much time and attention
has been paid to an analysis of the
question, and it is certain that the
Stanford speakers will bring all
the arguments to hear against foot
ball in its relation to university
ideals which can be gathered from
any source. The second team,
which takes the other side of the
question against Nevada, has been
pressed into service for trial de
bates, and the men have thereby
become acquainted with the argu
ments which California is apt to
present.
Three prominent and eminently
fair judges have been selected to
pass judgment on the debate:
Judge F. J. Murasky of the Cali
fornia Appellate Court, Judge J. S.
Cooper of the State Superior Court,
and William Greer Harrison, presi
dent of the Olympic Club.
Tickets are being printed, to sys
tematize the seating of the audience.
No admission will be charged, but
treats will be reserved in order that
the rooting sections of the rival
universities may be located to
