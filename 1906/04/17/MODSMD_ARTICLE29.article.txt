# UNIVERSITY IN PATH OF DISASTROUS EARTHQUAKE
## Magnificent Structures Razed and Two Lives Lost. 
### 
Beginning at about seven min
utes past five this morning and
lasting for fully twenty seconds,
the greatest earthquake of modern
times shook the campus and af
fected the entire Santa Clara Val
ley and probably the whole Pacific
CoaÃŸt. The effect of the shake on
the campus was terrible. Two lives
were lost, six injure'!, and the
damage done to buildings cannot
he estimated. The exact financial
loss will not be ascertained for
weeks, but as a general and hasty
estimate President Jordan places
the figures at $2,800,000. But it
6eems certain that the loss is twice
as great. The famous Memorial
Church is practically demolished;
its tower was shaken down and
many costly windows and mosaics
were utterly ruined. The new
Library is an utter loss, except the
steel frame and the dome which it
supported. The new Gymnasium
and the great Memorial Arch are
also terribly wrecked. Along the
outer quadrangle many of the
arches are down, and for fully
thirty yards on the south side of
the outer quadrangle the entire
structure is demolished. It is dif
cult to estimate the loss in the
Chemistry building, as a vast
amount of it consists of apparatus
and chemicals which cannot be re
stored. The Museum and its rare
collections suffered equally with the
other University buildings. Encina
and Roble Halls both suffered
severely from the shock, especially
the large men's dormitory.
The new entrance is a complete
loss; and the old chimney, which
was a landmark of the campus, is
completely destroyed. All the
frame buildings on the campus
sustained varying amounts of
damage, but not as great as the
stone structures. Most of the
chimneys fell, and the plaster was
shaken off the walls. Great dam
age was done to many of the frater
nity houses, and many are shaken
off their bases and will require
practically re building. The Chi
Psi house probably suffered most
severely, but there were no injuries
of any consequence among the resi
dences on the row.
The outlying buildings of the
University were nearly all severely
shattered. The Stanford residence
was torn asunder, and Mrs. Stan
ford's former chamber was split
evenly in two. The brick winery

unharmed. "Faith," the stone
figure before the Memorial Arch,
was not touched, but the superb
newly constructed gateway was
leveled in the dust, the marble
lions broken, and but a few broken
columns left standing.
The general effect of the terrible
earthquake is appalling, and the
conditions are so confused that it
is impossible to say what plans will
be made, either in regard to re
building or to carrying on the
university work.
Dramatic Scenes in Encina Hall.
The first shock in Encina Hall
brought 800 scantily clad men into
the corridors in a mad rush for
safety and the open air. The road
in front was filled with excited stu
dents, who broke through a rain of
falling stones and plaster. As soon
as the shock subsided, the men be
gan to investigate the extent of the
damage. The cries of the victims
buried in the ruins of the collapsed
third floor were plainly audible.
The door of the main hall was bat
tered down with a beam and 200
men began the work of rescue.
Axes and ropes were brought from
the firehouse, and the injured
were removed from the debris one
by one. Two hours elapsed before
the mangled body of Hanna was
dug out, and then the work was
discontinued. Many narrow and
miraculous escapes were recorded.
In Roble Hall the floors fell
through, and some of the girls were
dropped down to the floor. The
chimney crashed through Iheroof,
and now lies straight across the
center of the hall. Several girls
had miraculous escapes from death
or serious injury, but fortunately
no one was hurt, and the relief par
ties from the hall and row found
that their services were not needed.
