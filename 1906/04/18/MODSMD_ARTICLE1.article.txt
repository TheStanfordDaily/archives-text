# DETAIL OF DAMAGE DONE TO UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS
## President Jordan Says University Will Not Open Till Friday. 
### 
The greatest damage done to any
building on the quad was suffered
by the Memorial Church, which is
practically wrecked. The clock
tower was shattered in half, stones,
brick-work and timbers falling in
to the body of the church and pil
ing up a mass of wreckage. The
works of the clock were left resting
on beams across the tower. The
front mosaic of the church, portray
ing the Sermon on the Mount, was
hurled upon the pavement of the
inner quadrangle in total destruc
tion, leaving the interior of the
church exposed and slightly dam
aging the organ. The stained-glass
window in the front of the church
was shattered into the organ-loft.
The sides of the transept were laid
open and part of the roof ripped
off. Nearly all the buttresses and
ornamental supports were demol
ished. The colonnade of the outer
quadrangle immediately behind the
church was laid upon the ground
in total ruin, the roof stretching in
a long line and covering the fallen
and scattered bricks and stones.
The Memorial Arch was lowered
to the frieze, while two huge crev
ices, one on each side, split the arch
open to the interior. The quad
rangle sustained most damage on
the west side, parts of the colon
nade being shattered and the walls
of some of the buildings torn out.
The wood-working and machine
shops and the new engineering
buildings are partially wrecked.
The big 100 footchimrey was brok
en off twenty feet from the
ground, and in falling crushed
the east end of the power-house,
burying Engineer Otto Gerdis un
der the debris, who was struck to
his death almost instantly. On the
east side, the Romanic Languages
block was badly strained, and
the arches before it piled upon the
road.
The second and third steries of
the English building caved through
in places. One of the inscriptions
in the Memorial Court was tumbled
to the ground, and two of the

Japanese bronzes were broken to
pieces.
The impetus of falling bodies was
illustrated by the fall of the statue
of Agassiz from the front of the
Zoology building. The statue was
hurled from a height of thirty feet, j
It struck the pavement head first
and remained buried to the chest.
The stone next to the keystone of
an arch on the east side of the
quadrangle was knocked out but
the arch remained. The interior of
the general library was partly de
molished by the crash of the rear
gallery.
Portions of the roofing of the
quad, miscellaneous stones and
bricks are loosened, and cracks
have weakened the walls in places.
A student guard was established
by 9 o'clock and no one allowed to
enter the quad. The work of clear
ing away the debris is going on at
a rapid rate.
