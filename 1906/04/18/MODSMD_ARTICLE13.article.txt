# Position of San Francisco Critical.
## 
### 
A late report, which comes from
San Francisco, states that while the
newly built, steel-frame buildings
are still standing, a great part of
the city is in ruins, including the
city hall.
The total destruction of the city
is threatened by fire, which is
rapidly spreading from the water
front up, and which cannot be
checked because of the broken
water-mains.
Vandalism and looting has
broken out in the wrecked city, and
martial law has hern proclaimed to
protect the inhabitants.
San Jose is suffering severely,
both from the terrific shock and
from fire. The position of the peo
ple in Agnews is critical; a num
ber of insane persons having
escaped from the demolished
asylum, are running at random
about the countrv.
