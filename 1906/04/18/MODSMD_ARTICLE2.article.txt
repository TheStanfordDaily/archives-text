### D.S. JORDAN 
University Work Will Not Be Re
sumed To-morrow.
Dr. Jordan gave out the follow
ing statement at noon to-day:
"Stanford University is hit very
hard. The damage to the build
ings amounts to upwards of $2,800-
000. The death of Mr. Hanna, the
student in Encina Hall killed in
the wreck of his room, as also that
of Mr. Gerdis, the fireman at the
power-house, is most saddening.
On the other hand, had the earth
quake taken place in the daytime,
the loss of life would have been ap
palling. And we are thankful that
matters are no worse among such
terrible possibilities.
"The work of the classes will be
resumed on Friday, or as soon as
the buildings are declared safe.
"For the past seven years Stan
ford University has been complet
ing the magnificent group of build
ings as planned by the founders.
About $400,000 each year has been
set aside for building, the Univer
sity having been run on the re

maining part of less than one half
of the income. This sum has heen
very small for the large body of
students, 1786 in the present year,
and for the way in which instruc
tion is planned. The running ex
penses of eastern universities is
largely met by the students' fees.
Harvard receives nearly $BOO,OOO a
year from its students; Stanford
barely $6,000. Stanford's buildings
have been paid for entirely from
the income of the endowment.
There is now nothing to do but to
go over it all again, with the same
rigid economies that have marked
the whole history of the University
since the death of Mr. Stanford.
"We have often said that it is
not buildings but men that make
the University. This is the time
for Stanford men to show that this
is true. Never was a time in the
history of our country when gifts
to education counted for more than
to-day.
"It will doubtless be necessary at
Stanford to limit her entering class
of next year, and to adopt a plan
of fees, not for tuition, which we
hope will remain always free, but
adequate to cover lighting, heating
and all merely administrative ex
penses.
" We shall try to make our work
as thorough and as helpful as col
lege work can be made, a place
where exceptional men can find
exceptionaltraining. But our great
ambitions for Stanford as a uni
versity must rest awhile—until we
can save the money for building
again and until our own alumni
are old enough and rich enough to
come to our rescue.
