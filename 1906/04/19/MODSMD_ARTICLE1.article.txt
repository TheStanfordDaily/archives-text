# UNIVERSITY TO SUSPEND WORK FOR THE SEMESTER
## UNIVERSITY IS QUIET ACCOUNT OF DAMAGE INFLICTED BEING TAKEN. No Further Heavy Tremblors Recorded, but Danger Keeps Many Out of Doors. 
### 
The community is slowly coming
to the full realization of the extent
and portent of the havoc wrought
by the great earthquake. With the
exception of several slight shocks
yesterday, no further tremhlors
have been felt. Campus residents
everywhere slept out of doors last
night, but all danger seems to be
past.
The buildings on the quad are
being carefully inspected by the
following party: Contractor Mc-
Gilvray, Professors W. F. Durand,
C. D. Marx, Fernand Sanford, A.
C. Whitaker, C. H. Gilbert, A. B.
Clark, and Architect C. E. Hodges.
Investigation of the damage done
to the Museum and Chemistry
Building reveals that the loss in
these buildings is greater than it at
first appeared. In the Museum
many valuable collections are total
ly destroyed, as the earthquake
wrought havoc with the ca.Â«es and
exhibit rooms. Curator H. C. Pet
erson stated to-day that the dam
age, when carefully estimated, will
be found to be very great, and
that the proper restoration of the
broken collections will cost infinite
labor and a vast sum of money.
The damage to apparatus in the
Chemistry buildiig can he repaired
for a few thousand dollars, but Pro
fessor Stillman states that the dam
age to the building is the chief con
sideration. This is comparatively
slight.
