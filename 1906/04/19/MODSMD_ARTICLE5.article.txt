## 
### 
The following special announcement was issued by President Jor
dan as the result or the meeting of the Advisory Board, held at 11
o'clock to-day:
In view of the remits of the earthquake of April 16th—its effects on the
University and the community at large—it is ordered that all class work in
Stanford University shall be suspended for the rest of the college year, and
each professor and instructor shall report the credits earned by members of
his classes as though the year's work were completed. Students of doubtful
standing may receive special examinations either at once or at the beginning
of the fall term. No one should be reported as passed unless the instructor is
certain that such report is deserved.
Each professor will indicate at once when and where he will meet his stu
dents for consultation or examination. Students entitled to degrees on the
basis of the reports received will be granted their diplomas indue season.
The next term will open on August 23d (registration August 28th), as
indicated in the Register. DAVID STARR JORDAN, President.
