# IN GRASP OF FIRE
## SAN FRANCISCO STILL FIGHTS BACK FLAMES. Horrors of Famine May Be Added to Fireâ€”City's Loss Now About 500. 
### 
In the iron grasp of martial
law, San Francisco is still fighting
hack the fires which threaten to
complete the ruin started by the
earthquake. Artillery and dyna
mite are being freely used by the
military forces to stop the spreading
of fire and to save the resident por
tion of the city.
The greater part of the business
section is already consumed. From
the ferry to Valencia street,at least
five blocks each side of Market,
nothing but burning and smoking
ruins are left.
The fire fighters are making a
desperate stand at Valencia street
in an attempt to save the remain
ing residences of the shattered city.
The latest reports indicate that
the tales of looting and vandalism,
as well as the loss of life in Sun
Francit-co, have been greatly exag
gerated, and that the city is well un
der the control of General Funston.
The instant that martial law was
declared, a proclamation was post
ed stating that ghouls and vandals
would he shot at sight, and this,
together with the presence of the
United Slates regulars in the streets,
has rendered the city comparatively
quiet. It is not thought that the
loss of life will not exceed 500.
Roughs and criminals who are
known to the police have been
warned when seen to leave the city,
and those not obeying are carried
at the point of the bayonet to
Presidio for safe keeping.
The largest and giai dest of the
San Francisco buildings have either
heen destroyed or are doomed.
Artillery was recently turned upon
the St. Francis and the Call
Building and dynamite is being
used. These structures are now
lying in the dust with the Empo
rium, the Winchester Hotel, the
liialto building, the Grand Opera
House, the Saint Patrick's Chutch,
the Examiner and Chronicle build
ings, the Columbia Theatre, and
the City Hall.
Thousands of homeless wander
ers, stunned by their losses, and
carrying with them their total sav
ings from the destruction, are pour
ing from the city inland with no
definite destination in view.
Unless traffic to the scene of de
vastation can be restored at once,
and food supplies rushed there, the
j horrors of a famine will be added
to those of the tremblor and fire.
The price of food is already boh ring,
atid in some places the only dunk
ing water to be obtained comes
from the broken water-mains. Re
lief cannot be secured from the
smaller towns, since they are also
| suffering from the effects of the
l earthquake.
