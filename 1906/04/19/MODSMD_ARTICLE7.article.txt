# RESTORATION OF BUILDINGS COMMENCES IMMEDIATELY
## $100,000 Will Refit Inner and Outer Quad by Next August. 
### 
It has been determined to im
mediately begin the task of rebuild
ing the University. By next
August it is expected that the build
ings will be so far repaired as to
readily admit continuation of all
ordinary work.
Quick estimates have been made
as to the cost of rebuilding the outer
and inner quadrangles, with the
exception of the Arch and the
Memorial Church. One hundred
thousand dollars will rebuild for
all regular purposes the outer and
inner buildings, which will be re
stored to the same state as before the
earthquake. Roble Hall will also
be restored, and will not be at all
changed in plan.
Encina Hall will be reconstructed,
in conformance wiih its orginal
plans, with the exception of the
high chimneys on the roofs. This

omitting of the stacks will preclude
any repetition of yesterday's disas
ter, one of the deaths of which was
caused by the collapsing chimneys.
The party investigating the con
ditions prevailing in the shattered
buildings have not yet finished
their tour of inspection. The Eng
lish-History building, the Library
and the Physics building were de
clared unsafe, as were the newly
completed Geology classrooms and
offices. The inner quadrangle
withstood the shock exceedingly
well, and no trouble is anticipated
from it. As far as the inner quad
is concerned work might proceed
immediately, and the routine of
daily study be continued as hereto
fore. The conditions prevailing
upon the Coast in general, however,
do not at all warrant the continu
ation of University work.
