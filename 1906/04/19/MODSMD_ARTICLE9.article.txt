# Outlying Buildings and Arch to be Rebuilt.â€”Pavilion for Gymnasium.
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan made a general state
ment this afternoon in regard to
the restoration of the buildings of
the University. Although nothing
can he definitely determined until
the Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity meets, it can be estimated
with considerable accuracy what
will be done. The date of the next
regular meeting of the trustees is a
week from to-morrow, on Friday,
April 27th, but it is highly prob
able that as soon as communica
tion from the University with the
north can be established and the
members of the board called to
gether, quick measures for the re
sumption of building will be
taken.
The new buildings will be in
Spanish style and of sandstone.
Dr. Jordan stated that the second
story of the new gymnasium will
be torn down and as much left
standing as can be used in recon
struction. The proposed plan is to
extend the first story into a pavil
ion which will afford as many and
as various uses as the plan of the
original building comprised, in
cluding gymnasium hall, indoor
track, ball-room, handball courts,
basket-ball courts, showers and

swimming tank?. The new build
ing will be constructed of Btone.
The structure of the dismantled
library building will be preserved
as far as possible, and steel, which
proved to be the only material cap
able of withstanding the shock of
the earthquake, will be used in its
restoration. The library building
will probably be reconstructed ac
cording to the original architectur
al plans, the greatest care being
taken in the modification of inside
material for strength.
The Chemistry building sustain
ed considerable breakage in appar
atus, besides being torn open. The
effects of the earthquake were not as
serious here as in the other outly
ing buildings, and the Chemistry
building will be restored as soon as
possible. It is questionable whether
the Museum will be restored to its
original plan Provision will be
made to modify the usable part of
the building and to extend it for
the accommodation of all collec
tions. Both the new library and
the Museum were built with person
al funds given by Mrs. Stanford.
The Memorial Arch will be torn
down, and upon restoration will be
lower and in the Spanish style.
