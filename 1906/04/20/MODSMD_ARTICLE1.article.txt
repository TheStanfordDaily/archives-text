# NO FUNDS ADVANCED
## HUMOR THATUNIVERSITY WILL LEND MONEY UNFOUNDED. Treasurer Lathrop States That All the Coin Is in Vaults in San Francisco. 
### 
Treasurer Lathrop when seen
this morning stated that the report
that the Business office would be
able to advance money to students
wishing to leave was incorrect. He
stated that the University had
practically no cash on hand, and
their securities were in San Fran- ,
cisco and New York. Mr. Lathrop j
expressed a desire to help if he
â€¢could, but said that the University
was not in a position to.
Dr. Jordan, when seen shortly
afterwards, gave out the following
statement:
"The best thing for students to
-do is to telegraph to have cash sent
by express or registered mail. An
other thing to do is to take a train
to Stockton or Sacramento from
San Jose, and then telegraph for
money through the Western Union
of Wells Fargo express. The Wells
Fargo and Western Union office in
Palo Alto has no money, and the
University treasury is empty.
"On the other hand, there is not
the slightest reason why anyone
should leave unless they want to.
I would just as soon sleep in Encina
as anywhere. There is not the
slightest danger. Roble Hall is
absolutely safe and unharmed, ex
cept for the fall of two ornamental
chimneys, which wrecked the rooms
directly underneath. Girls should
stay here until the railroads are in
running order."
Dr. Jordan has notified President
Roosevelt that he will not go to
Japan on the Government fish
exploration party, which was to
leave for the Orient next week. In
stead, Dr. Gilbert will have full
charge of the expedition. Dr. Jor
dan will remain in or about Palo
Alto all summer.
"All will he in readiness for fall
work," continued Dr. Jordan. "No
serious damage has been done to
books, apparatus, and collections.
Two hundred dollars' worth of
bottles and three hundred dollars'
worth of chemicals were destroyed
in the Chemistry building. Re
pairs to the outer quad. Encina,
Roble, and the Chemistry building
will amount to about $200,000.
"The University securities are
held mainly in an under-vault in
San Francisco. The bonds are all
registered, and therefore can he re
placed in case they are destroyed.
The University has lost nothing of
its capital, and practically none of
its working buildings, hut the or
namental structures are hopelessly
destroyed. The fine architectural
features, the cloisters of the inner
quad, with the Spanish towers, are
all intact.
"We have heard nothing from
the Board of Trustees as yet. Many
of them have suffered severely from
fire in San Francisco, and are occu
pied with their own affairs."
Speaking of the path of the
earthquake and the ins to be

learned from it, Dr. Jordan had
the following to say:
"The recent disturbance is a fault
or break of the inner hard crust of
the earth. As far as we can trace
from rumors and guesses, it
began near Glen Ellen, Sonoma
county, extended past Valencia
street, San Francisco, through San
Bruno, Baden, between San Ma
teo and Burlingame, across to Mill
Page road south of the University,
then apparently across to near
Pajaro and Salinas. Practically it
is one of the earth throws by which
this peninsula has been formed and
folded. It has nothing to do with
Vesuvius or any volcano, and it is
not likely that it will be repeated
for manv vears."
