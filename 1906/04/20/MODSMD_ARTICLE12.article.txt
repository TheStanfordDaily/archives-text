Stanford University hue been a
sufferer in one of the greatest disas
ters in the history of mankind. In
the twinkling of an eye our visible
strength was prostrated, and those
magnificent buildings, the monu
ments of years of toil and fore
thought, of the noblest ideals and
aspirations, were laid low in the
dust. We cannot express our feel
ing at this horrible calamity, for it
belies expression. It is the blind
force of Nature undoing in a mo
ment the proudest work of man.
But we should not despair. Out
of our grief we should arise and
labor ceaselessly to once more build
up the University in which all our
hopes are enshrined. And most of
all, let us put our trust no longer
in stone and steel, but in those
ideals which never perish, which
outlast ruin, and do not yield to
the limitations of time.
