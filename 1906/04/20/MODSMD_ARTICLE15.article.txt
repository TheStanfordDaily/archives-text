# Imperative Call for Aid.
## 
### 
Relief parties are being formed
in this vicinity, and trains are
taking the rescuers into San Fran
cisco.
A mass meeting was held in Palo
Alto last night, and numerous able
bodied men were enlisted in the
militia and the ranks of the dep
uty-sheriffs. A large party left for
the ruined city, armed and with

food-stuffs and canned goods for
the famine-stricken refugees in the
north.
Word is being sent around the
University to immediately collect
all old or misHt clothes, and to get
them to the captains of the
relief squads. The clothing will
lie used in the relief work
going on in San Francisco. This
request for clothes is imperative,
and every possible means should
be taken to aid the sufferers.
