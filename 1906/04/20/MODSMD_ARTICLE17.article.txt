# NO ELECTION TILL. SEPTEMBER
## Student Body Officers to Retain Positions Until Succeeded. 
### 
On account of the closing of the
University, it is unconstitutional
to hold meetings of the student
body. Present incumbents of stu
dent body offices will retain their
positions until their successors are
elected.
A meeting for nominations for
office was to have been held to
morrow. President Cunha has
gone to his home near San Jose on
account of a death in his family.
Although a majority of the stu
dents remain on the campus, it
is the general sentiment of the
Executive Committee that a spe
cial election in the early part of
next September will take the place
of the regular spring election of
student body officers
