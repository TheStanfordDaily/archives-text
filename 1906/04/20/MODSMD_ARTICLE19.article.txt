# Dr. Snow Tells of Suffering in 'Frisco
## 
### 
Dr. Snow of the Hygiene depart
ment, who returned from San Fran
cisco late last ni hi, says the con
ditions are appalling. The fire
started in the district south of
Market, near the waterfront, and
soon spread as far west as Fifth
street, where the flames leaped
across Market street and burned
along Kearny, Montgomery, and
Sansome streets. From Kearny
street the flames spread west to Van
Ness avenue. Scattering fires
burned along Mission and Valencia
streets.
The St. Francis Hotel was entire
ly burned. The Emergency Hospi
tal and the City Hall were wrecked,
as was the Stanford library,
the domes being left intact. Seven
patients of the Emergency Hospital
were killed outright.
The flames leaped back and forth
from the fallen ruins along Market
street, and raged against the wind,
which was blowing toward the
Ferry building. The soldiers from
the Presidio established a guard
line along Van Ness avenue, but
were forced to retreat, block by
block, as the flames drew nearer.
The dying and wounded were
crowded into the Southern Pacific
Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, and
the Mechanics' Pavilion. Later
the wounded were removed to the
Presidio Hospital.
