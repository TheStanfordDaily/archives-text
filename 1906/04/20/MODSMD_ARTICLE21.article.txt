# FIRE IS UNCHECKED
## MOST OF SAN FRANCISCO IS ENTIRELY DEVASTATED. Great Danger of Pestilence from Unflushed Sewers.â€”Hordes of People Homeless. 
### 
The latest reports from San
Francisco are anything hut en
couraging. The fire was still rag
ing in various parts of thecity,and
the district hounded 011 the west by
Gough street on the north hy the
water front, on the east by the
water front, and on the south by
23d street, is almost entirely devas
tated. The fire at one o'clock this
morning was not under control and
was rapidly consuming the un
burnt part of the city.
Hordes of people are camping
out on Twin Peaks and in the out
lying districts near the Golden
Gate Park. The ferries are now
running to all parts, and crowds
are loading down the boats. Many
hundreds of people are coming
down the peninsula.
The large buildings of the city
are not as badly injured as at first
reported. The Ferry building is
up and practically intact. The
Call and the Flood buildings are
standing solidly, although gutted
by fire. The St. Francis is stand
ing but very dangerous, and it may
be down by this time. The Fair
mount is on fire and the conflagra
tion is spreading out beyond Nob
Hill to join the blaze on Gough
street.
The streets of the city are
cracked and torn in a most alarm
ing way and the car tracks are
completely demolished. Water was
is use at 7:30 last night in the Mis
sion district and the danger of
death by thirst was averted, al
though the fire could not be
checked.
Danger of pestilence is great as
the sewers have not been flushed,
and once started disease will spread
with terrible rapidity on account
of the emaciated and weakened
condition of the starving people.
