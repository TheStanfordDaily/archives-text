# SOUTHERN PACIFIC STATEMENT.
## 
### 
As banks will not certify checks, we will be unable to honor
either checks or drafts for tickets. Will accept only cash or ex
press money-orders.
Trains between San Jose and San Francisco are running as
they can. No wires are up, so we cannot give time of arrivals
or departures of trains. Trains between San Jose and Oakland,
Oakland and the East, Oakland and Portland, and San Jose and
Los Angeles, via Niles, Tracy, and Bakersfield, are running all
right. Coast Division south of Gilroy blocked at present. We
can sell tickets to all points, except on Coast Division south of
Gilroy, and can check baggage to all points where tickets are sold,
but baggage is subject to delay. All wires will undoubtedly be
working to-night. We advise against students wiring East to
have money paid there for tickets to be issued here. Orders to do
this must come through our general offices, which are destroyed,
therefore the delivery of tickets will be delayed some time. It is
better to wire to send cash by express, or to send express money
orders.

Agent Southern Pacific Company.
