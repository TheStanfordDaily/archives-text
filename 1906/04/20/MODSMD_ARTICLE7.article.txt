# Stocks and Bonds of University Safe.
## 
### 
Out of the main endowment of
the University, which consists of
interest-hearing securities, the sum
of sixteen millions of dollars is in
registered Government bonds in the
East, and hence out of reach of the
present calamity of California.
Several millions more are in the
stocks of Eastern banks. It is quite
safe to say that aside from damage
done to the University property on
the campus, the Stanford holdings
are practically secure.
