# Mrs. Stanford's City Residence Burned
## 
### 
The $700,000 house of Mrs. Stan
ford on Nob Iliil in San Francisco
is a total ruin from the flames of
the conflagration. Mrs. Stanford
herself expended a half a million
dollars on decoration of the interior
of the residence. This last expendi
ture raided the value ol the house to
$1,200,000. All this is lost to the
University, which -will have to
spend great sums in clearing up the
property. Yet the Stanford residence
was hut a comparatively small por
tion of the University endowment,
and the value of the land on which
it was situated is very high.
