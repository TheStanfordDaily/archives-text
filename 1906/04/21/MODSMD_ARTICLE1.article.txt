# ENGINEERS REPORT ON CONDITIONS OF BUILDINGS
## Damage Is Much. Less Than Anticipated, So Say University Experts 
### 
After a careful examination of
the buildings used for university
purposes, including Roble and En
cina Halls, we find that the dam
age from the recent earthquake is
much less than was anticipated.
The buildings of the inner quad
rangle, the one-story buildings of
the outer quadrangle (with one
exception), the Zoology building,
the Physiology building, the As
sembly Hall, the Library, the old
Engineering building, the Machine
shop, the Foundry, the Mechani
cal laboratory are substantially
intact, and can be used after a few
minor repairs.
The four corner two-story build
ings and the small one-story Phys
ics building of the outer quad
rangle, the Forge shop, the Wood
working shop, and the Chemistry
building will require partial re
building of some of the walls.
In Encina Hall the south walls
of the east and west wings will re
quire partial reconstruction; also
those portions injured by the two
fallen Btone chimneys. The fall of
one of the chimneys, which tore
through the floors to the basement,
caused the death of one student.
Aside from the damage noted above,
the building, as a whole, is unin
jured and perfectly safe.
The damage to Roble Hall is
confined to the two holes torn in
the floors by the falling chimneys.
The remainder of the building
shows practically no evidence of
having passed through an earth
quake.
In the opinion of the committee,
such of the buildings mentioned
above as are necessary for carrying
on the university work can easily
be made ready for occupancy and
safe use in time for the opening of
the University on August 23d.
Our full and detailed examina

tion of the buildings, from founda
tion to roof, shows that the actual
damage to their stability is less
than might be inferred from ex
ternal appearances.
