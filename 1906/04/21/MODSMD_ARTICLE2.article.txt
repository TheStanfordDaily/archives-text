The restoration of the magnifi
cent edifice will not be begun for
several years. For the present
it must remain in ruins. Event
ually, however, it will be re-built,
its Gothic shape in the form of a
cross will be retained, while its
outer semblance will be remodeled
from the Roman and medieval
styles to the Spanish, the body of
the church supporting a lower
dome, which will culminate like
that of a Spanish mission.
Mrs. Stanford expended the sum
of $600,000 on interior decoration
of the church after the structure
was completed at a cost of $1,-
000,000. The ornate interior of the
church is dismantled. The walls
are cracked in many places, dis
figuring the stained glass windows
above,and below, thecostly mosaics,
illustrative of the stories of the
Bible. Aside from the injuries to
the walls, the damage sustained
by the church was due chiefly to
the crash of the falling clock-tower,
which tumbled northward, carry
ing the roof through near the dome.
The sides of the transept were
broken away from the church by
the force of the earthquake.
When the crash of the clock
tower came, timbers, brick?, mortar
and stones weighing hundreds of
pounds were hurled into the body
of the church, smashing windows,
statuary, and woodwork, wrecking
pews and ornaments, and littering
the interior of the chilrch with
debris. If the front wall of the
church, bearing the exterior mosaic,
had fallen inward upon the organ
loft, as did the window, the huge
and expensive organ would have
been a total wreck. Luckily few
of the pipes are known to be broken.
It is probable that the organ can
be sufficiently preserved for restor
ation.
The arches within the church re
main whole, indicating that the
lower part of the walls of the build
ing suffered little. The new Me
morial Church will have no spire.
In its place will be a dome *in the
style of the Mission fathers. The
new structure, standing in the cen
ter of the quad, will lend a Spanish
cast to the architecture of the Uni
versity, which will be continued by
the restored outlying buildings.
