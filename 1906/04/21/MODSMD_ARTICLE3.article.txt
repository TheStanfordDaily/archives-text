The injuries to Stanford Univer
sity by the earthquake of April
18th are in brief as follows:
1. Wreckage of the Memorial
Church by the fall of the heavy
spire, which crashed through the
nave, the air blowing off the upper
part of both ends of the church.
The walls generally, of steel con
struction, are intact, but the build
ing is ruined.
2. Wreck of the unfinished Li
brary. The great dome and its
steel supports are unharmed; their
swaying completely wrecked the
rest of the building.
3. Wreck of the new Gymnasium,
of brick faced with stone.
4. Wreck of parts of the Art
Museum which were made of brick
faced with cement. The central
part of concrete strengthened by
steel rods is intact.
5. The Stanford residence in San
Francisco, a huge wooden structure,
heavily built, is not harmed by the
earthquake but is completely con
sumed by fire.
6. The inner quadrangle and En
gineering shops, of heavy masonry
and one story high, are unharmed.
7. The outer quadrangle contains
four large buildings reinforced by
steel, the laboratories of Zoology,
Botany and Physiology, with the
temporary Library and the Assem
bly Hall. These are virtually un
harmed.
8. The Power-house was wrecked
by the tall stone chimney, which
was snapped off like the lash of a
whip.
9. The Memorial Arch had its
upper part snapped off and is split
almost to the base, so that it is an
entire wreck. This structure was
of brick, reinforced with steel and
faced with stone.
10. The Chemistry building lost

all its chimneys and is externally
damaged by the fall of part of its
stone facing. The building and its
contents are little injured. .
11. The four large buildings of
the outer quadrangle, of brick un
reinforced, and faced with stone,
are somewhat damaged, the History
building least, the incomplete Win
ing building most.
12. Roble Hall, women's dormi
tory, of concrete with steel wires,
is absolutely unharmed except for
the fall of two ornamental chim
neys.
13. Encina Hall, men's dormi
tory, a very large,finely built stone
building, was injured by the fall of
stone chimneys, one young man
being killed. The building also has
a serious crack in each of two cor
ners, but is otherwise unharmed.
The wooden buildings on the
grounds lost only chimneys and
parts of plastering. No injury was
done to books, and very little to
apparatus or collections. The work
ing part of the University as dis
tinct from its architectural effects
is little harmed. The most effective
part of its architecture, the inner
arcades with their Spanish arches
atid towers, is wholly undisturbed.
