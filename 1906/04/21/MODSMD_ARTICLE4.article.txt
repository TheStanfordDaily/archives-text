# Palo Alto Suffers Severely.
## 
### 
The earthquake left Palo Alto in
bad condition. University avenue
presents a scene of tottering ruins,
ready to fall at the slightest mo
tion. The Palo Alto Times build
ing is a total wreck, Fraser & Co.'s
store has lost one entire side wall,
the front of the University drug
store has partially collapsed, and
others have sustained serious dam
age. The Shipley Academy, the resi
dence of B. F. Oak ford, and the
Christian Church are ruins.
