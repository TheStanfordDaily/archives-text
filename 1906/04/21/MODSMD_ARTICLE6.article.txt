This issue of the Daily Palo
Alto will be the last of the pres
ent year. The editor wishes to
extend to the staff and to the whole
college community his thanks for
the loyal support which they have
given him since he assumed charge
of the paper. The year has been
in many ways a strenuous one, be
ing characterized by many minor
troubles and unforeseen events.
But all these are now forgotten in
the presence of the overwhelming
disaster which has befallen the
U Diversity.
The situation may be stated
briefly as follows: The buildings
of the University are wrecked, and
the labor of years, ever since the
founding, has been in a large meas
ure undone. Stanford must begin
all over again, and once more
ascend the arduous hill of difficult
endeavor. The setback has been
tremendous. In all probability it
will take five or six years at least
before Stanford will be as efficient
and as well equipped as she was
before the earthquake of Wednes
day. This is a frank statement of
the condition of the University
after the great disaster.
It is now incumbent upon all the
men and women of Stanford to
show their utmost measure of loy-1
alty and devotion. The situation j
is so grave that nothing but the!
greatest enthusiasm of all stu
dents can save the Univer
sity from a period of stag
nation. Yet there is no real
reason of discouragement. The re
sources of the University are entire
ly ample for all contingencies. The
outer and inner quadrangles will
be in good condition for recitations
by next August, and work will then
be able to proceed just as in the
past. By that time the laborator
ies and workshops will also be in
shape, and aside from the one
month lost, there will be no real
delay in the real work of learning
and progress for which the Univer

eitv exists. The danger lies in the j
fact that many of the students will
feel some hesitation in coming to j
Stanford. This will be based par
tially on foolish fear and partially
on financial difficulties. Itis there
fore absolutely necessary that every
student now in the University shall
return next fall, and furthermore
that every student shall use his tit
most endeavor to persuade others
to come. If this is done, Stanford
need not fear. All our buildings
will he restored in as short a time
as possible, our various courses will
not be impaired, and the Uni
versity will march on to
the fulfilment of her manifest
destiny. Men and women of Stan
ford! with you and you alone rests
the outcome. Let us all be true
and loyal, knowing well that we
ourselves have the power to turn
calamity into triumph, and out of
disaster to raise a new and more
glorious Stafford.
