### 
The Register for 1905-6, which
is being distributed at the Regis*
trar's oflice, contains few changes
which have not already been an
nounced. The Law department
outlines the number of hours
which are expected to be made in
various culture subjects by under
graduate Law majors. Modifica
tions have been made in entrance
requirements and accrediting.
Law majors, in arranging courses
in general culture, are expected to
apply sixty units as follows: To
Latin, 4; to either French, Ger
man, or Spanish, 6; to English, 10;
to History, 15; to Economics, 13;
to Mathematics, 6; and to one of
the sciences, 6. After next August
English Composition, now called
Entrance Subject 1, will count one
and one-half credits. The number
of credits in entrance English re
mains four; one half credit being
applied to Oral Interpretation. The
examination in this subject con
sists of reading aloud prose and
verse passages. On page fifty-five
is given a list of subjects and cred
its which will be allowed to fulfill
entrance requirements when accred
ited by various universities. Spe
cial announcement is made of ad
mission of candidates from Mexico
of sufficiently high standing.
Schools which have sent at least
five graduates to the University
who have made satisfactory records
here will be allowed accrediting
privileges without inspection if the
Committee on Admission so-votes.
Before being admitted as special
students, persons who are under
twenty-five years of age and are
not graduates of some approved
high school or equivalent prepara
tory school will be required to pass
examinations in entrance subjects
aggregating at least five units.
Two changes of 1 interest have
been made in the general regula
tions. On page sixty-nine it is
stated that an honorable dismissal
may be granted to any student not
under discipline for misconduct,
recommending him to the favor
able consideration of any institu
tion he may wish to enter. Page
seventy contains the estimate of
from $275 to $400 as the amount
necessary for expenses of the stu
dent, exclusive of clothing and
railroad fares, which is higher by
fifty dollars than last year's esti
mate. The comparison would seem
to indicate that the student's cost
of living has increased.
The summary of students shows
a total of 1786 students against
1568 for 1904-5. Of these 1341 live
in California. Forty-two states and
territories and the District of Co
lumbia are represented by students
in the University, while others
come from eight foreign countries.
