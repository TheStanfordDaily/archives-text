# JORDAN ADDRESSES STUDENTS
## The 						University Will Be Rebuilt. Instruction Will Begin in August. 
### 
Wednesday morning, in front
of the shattered men's dormitory,
Encina Hall, Doctor Jordan spoke
to a large crowd of assembled stu
dents. The University's President
discussed the great calamity which
has carried Stanford back again to
the stone age, as follows:
"It is not buildings that make a
university, but professors and stu
dents, and I ask the students to
demonstrate this. The earthquake
that struck us this morning is
probably the greatest of modern
times, and the saddest feature of it
is our loss of life.
•'Stanford has the largest endow
ment of any institution in the
world, but we are hampered in two
ways: we obtain no money from
instruction, and we are forbidden
to use the principal of our endow
ment or to go into debt.
"During the past seven years we
have been spending our income to
build, about $400,000 a year, and
we were nearly done. We were
looking forward toward greater in
tensification, toward improvements
and toward the largest, best, and
most expensive faculty of any uni
versity; but we will now have to
begin again, to return to our stone
age.
"The University will have to go
°.hcad and build itself again. We
will have to economize and struggle
up —possibly a general registration
fee will be necessary. We have
been harder hit before and we have
pulled out.
"At the time of the Government
law suits the University did not
have one chance in a hundred. We
stood together then and we will
stand together now.
"During my trip East I was of
fered the presidency of one of the
greatest institutions in America at
any salary I might name. I re
main at Stanford."
The President was warmly ap
plauded at the conclusion of his
talk, and the meeting closed with
the singing of "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."
