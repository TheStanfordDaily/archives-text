# TO HOLD GRADUATION
## CLASS OF 1906 WILL FORMALLY RECEIVE DIPLOMAS. Committee on Public Exercises Sets Aside September 15th for Commencement Exercises. 
### 
The Committee on Public
cises has set aside the date of Sep
tember 15th for the formal gradu
ation and commencement, exercises
of last year's Senior class. The
officers of the class are much in
favor of the postponed graduation
and if their plans materialize many
of the features of a regular Senior
week will be included in the pro
gram.
Announcement of the date is to
made to the men and women who
were to receive degrees last May
and all will be urged to attend. If
sufficient response is made to this
request it is the plan of the 1906
men to carry out the features of the
regular commencement as far as
practical, including the farce, the
laying of the plate, the reading of
the class will and history, the
Faculty-Senior baseball game, and
the Senior reception. Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, president of the Uni
versity of California, will deliver
the commencement address.
The graduating class will inaug
urate the custom of wearing caps
and gowns, with the idea of
making the occasion as impressive
as possible President Sales has
written a letter to the Faculty
Committee on Public Exercises
urging that members of the faculty
also appear in caps and gowns.
The baccalaureate sermon will
probably be delivered in the chapel
the Sunday following class day.
