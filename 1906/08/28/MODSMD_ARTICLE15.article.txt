# Register Twice Destroyed.
## 
### 
The University register was twice
destroyed by fire since last April.
In the San Francisco conflagration
half of the regular edition was
burned in the printing offices of the
Hicks-Judd Company. A new
edition whs immediately compiled,
in which both the faculty and stu
dent lists were omitted, the Pacific
Press Publishing Company of
Mountain View was the printer of
the new edition, and in the fire
which recently destroyed their plant
the register was also lost.
Fortunately an uncorrected gal

ley proof was saved and this was
turned over to the Eaton Printing
Company of San Jose. Thi√ü firm
expects to have the new register
out by the last of September.
