# PLANNING FOR RUGBY
## LANAGAN STUDIES NEW GAME IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. Possibility That Bansbach Will Again Be Assistant Coach.â€”Practice Starts September 10. 
### 
Practice with the Rugby gatne
chosen last spring by the faculty
athletic committees of Stanford
and California will begin Sep
tember 10th on Stanford Field
under the direction of Coach J. F.
Lanagan, '00. L. P. Bansbach,
'05, will probably succeed himself
as assistant coach.
Some five weeks after the closing
of college, Coach Lanagan left for
British Columbia to study the
Rugby game as it is played by the
Vancouver and Victoria Clubs.
In the short time at his disposal,
he could do little more than learn
the rudiments of the game. He
found, however, that the Stanford
squad must not only learn Rugby,
but also unlearn almost all that it
knew about the old game.
Fortunately Lanagan's method
has always been to start the squads
at the beginning of the season with
the rudiments of football and to
work out his strategy as the men
round into shape. The same plan
will be followed with Rugby. The
men will first be taught falling on
the ball, passing, catching, and
tackling, with the addition of catch
ing and passing on the run and with
special attention to the punting
and drop-kicking, which forms so
prominent a feature of the Rugby
game. Lanagan states that he has
outlined no definite plan of cam
paign but willdevlope the strategy
of the game as the season goes on.
Manager Barrett has so far made
no arrangements as regards pre
liminary games and has engaged
no assistant-coach. Vancouver
and Victoria have both signified
their willingness to make the south
ern trip and in all probability they
will make their appearance on the
coast fields sometime in October.
L. P. Bansbach, '05, who will pro
bably be Lanagan's assistant, has
had no experience with the Rugby
game but should be able to adapt
himself to the new conditions. In
any case no professional coach will
be employed. All the practice
games will be played on Stanford
Field but no plans have been made
for widening it. Both the Fresh
man and Varsity parries will pro
bably be played at California, where
the field is now being widened.
Instead of the regulation running
pants and bare knees, the Cardinal
squad will wear light khaki knee
pants with heavy shoes and stock
ings. The jerseys will be lightly
padded on the shoulders. The rules
under which the intercollegiate
game will be played are the regular
English Rugby rules revised by the
faculty committees of the two uni
versities. The most important
change is the introduction of three
substitutes for each team. Under
the English rules a man put out of
the game cannot be replaced and
his team must play short-handed,
but the committees fear that this

would give opportunities for un
satisfactory contests, and so made
this important change.
While it is impossible to figure
now on material for the coming
season, the outlook seems to be
bright. The squads will probably
be larger than ever before. All the
veterans of last year's winning
team who are back in college have
signified their intention of playing
Rugby and a number of track and
baseball veterans will turn out as
well. Lanagan and Captain E. P.
Stott, '07, are both highly enthus
iastic over the possibilities of the
new game, and expect that it will
rapidly gain in popularity with the
student body. The veterans of
1905 who will return to college this
semester are Captain E. P. Stott,
'07, ex-Captain A. J. Chalmers,
'07, W. E. Lyons, '06, J. N. Stan
ford, '06, T. Vandevoort, '08, W.
Koerner, '08, I). Slusher, '07, and
A. A. Molfino, '07.
