# REGISTRATION HEAVY
## INCSEASE OF NINETY-FIVE OVER LAST YEAR. Nine Hundred and Seventy-One Old Students Enrolled.â€”Few Assessments Collected. 
### 
Registration of old students be
gan at eight o'clock this morning
and during the entire day there has
been a steady line. By eight tonight
971 students had been admitted.
At a similar hour on the first day
last year the total number of old
students registered was 876. This
shows a net gain this year of 95
over last year.
Manager Barrett had received 765
assessments, 384 of which were paid
by women and 479 by men. These
figures compare favorably with
those of the first day last year when
only 691 assessments had been re
ceived by Manager Barrett.
It is estimated that tomorrow's
registration of Freshmen will
eclipse that of any former year, as
the number of applications received
has been very heavy.
