### 
The executive committee of the
associated students met this after
noon and decided to hold the an
nual student body election, post
poned from last semester, on Fri
day, August 31st. Nominations
will he made at a student hody
meeting to he held to-morrow after
noon at 1:15 in the University
chapel. Only those whose names
appear in last semester's student
directory will be permitted to vote.
This bars freshmen from all par
ticipation in the election.
The amendments to the consti
tution of the associated students,
which were proposed by the execu
tive committee last semester, will
be brought up at to-morrow'B meet
ing. These changes may be sum
marized as follows: The salary of
the graduate manager shall be in
creased from $1,000 to $1,200 a
year. The Executive Committee
shall take the duties of the Athletic
Committee, which shall be abol
ished. A Board of Control shall
be substituted for the Training
House Corporation to take charge
of all athletic fields and the like.
Whether these amendments will
be acted on to-morrow or tabled for
future consideration will rest with
to-morrow's meeting.
The committee called the meeting
so early in the semester at the in
stance of the last year's office hold
ers who are anxious to close up
their affairs as soon as possible.
The precedent for holding the elec
tion so soon after the nominations
was found in the election for editor
of the Daily Palo Alto last Feb
ruary.
Besides setting the date for elec
tion the committee accepted the
resignation of J. A. Quelle, ex-95,
as business manager of the Daily
Palo Alto. Quelle has gone to
Honolulu to teach manual training
and expects to remain away for a
year. S. S. Smith, '07, who has
been assistant manager under
Quelle for the past three years, was
appointed to succeed him tempor
arily until the election on Friday.
