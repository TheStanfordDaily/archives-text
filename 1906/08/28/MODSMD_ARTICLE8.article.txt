The large number of returning
students clearly demonstrates that
the spirit of Stanford has been
strengthened rather than broken
by the disaster of last April. For
the past week, the vicinity has been
filled with Stanford men and wo
men who arrived days earlier than
usual in their eagerness to return.
Calamity and misfortune have
shown that the Stanford Spirit of
which we boasted was a reality.
We needed but the opportunity to
demonstrate this loyalty.
In spite of unfortunate delays
and setbacks during the summer
months, the work of reconstruction
is now well under way and will go
forward without intermission. Per
haps to those of us who knew the
University before the disaster a
feeling of loss will at times dim the
goal that lies ahead and the noise
of singing be mingled with the
noise of weeping. Yet this feeling
will serve only to intensify our en
thusiasm. The present is no time
for the doubter and pessimist. It
is not the season to lament a van
ished past,'but to prepare for the
certain future. There is no real
reason for discouragement. With
the return of an overwhelming ma
jority of the old students, and with
indications of a Freshman class
larger than that of last year, with
our magnificent resources, with the
skill and energy of those who are
engaged in the work of repairing
and rebuilding, we can see no rea
son for feelings other than those of
hope and confidence.
