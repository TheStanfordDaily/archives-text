jected to the meeting because it in
terfered with the plasterers who
are at work in the Chapel. After
a long-consultation President Cun
ha gave way and the student body
adjourned to the Inner Quadrangle
where the business of the meeting
war completed.
The most important change
caused by the new amendments is
the abolishment of the Athletic
Committee and the turning over of
its functions to the Executive Com
mittee. A Board of Control consist
ing of the President, Vice-Presi
dent, Secretary, Graduate Manag
er, of the student body, the Chair
man of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee and one Faculty member
appointed by the Executive Com
mittee, will take the place of the
Training House Corporation. The
salary of the graduate Manager is
raised from $1000 to $1200 a year,
and he is allowed his travelling ex
penses in addition to his regular
salary. Another important change
makes only those eligible to vote
who have paid their regular stu
dent body assessments. This amend
ment will not take effect, however,
until after the election on Friday.
The official title of the student
body treasurer will hereafter be
Graduate Manager.
