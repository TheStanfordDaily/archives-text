President David Starr Jordan,
speaking yesterday of the resolution
passed by the Board of Trusaees
last April regulating the apdoint
mentand dismissal of faculty mem
bers and assistants, said: "The res
olution is an agreement between the
Board of Trustees and me. It was
drawn up largely by me and rep
resents the unanimous opinion of
the Board of Trustees. It is in ac
cordance with the practice in
American universities."
The resolution gives the Presi
dent of the University the iniative
sn making appointments to the
faculty, and leaves the iniative of
dismissal to his discretion. The
Board of Trustees must confirm
his recommendations in order that
these shall be binding.
The resolution of the Board of
Trustees affecting appointments
and dismissals follows:
"Whereas, it is desirable that all
nominations for appointments and
promotions of members of the teach
ing staff at the university and all
recommendations for dismissals
should be made by or through the
president, of the university, the
board of trustees taking no initia
tive in these matters;and whereas,
it is undesirable that either the
power of appointment or removal
should vest absolutely in the hands
of a single person;
"It is resolved and agreed by the
board of trustees and president of
the Lei and Stanford Jr. University
that so long as nominations for
appointments ane promotions of
members of the teaching staff at
the university are made by or
through the president of the uni
versity, no dismissal shall be made
without the concurrence of a ma
jority of the trustees present at a
meeting of the board of trustees at
which a quorum shall be present;
"That in the case of the recom
mendation of the removal of a mem
ber of the teaching staff involving
any question affecting his honor or
moral character he shall be furn
ished, upon application, by the
president with a specific written
statement of all charges and evi
dence reflecting upon his honor or
moral character and be given an
opportunity to present a written
statement of his answer and of any
evidence lie may wish to offer in
defense; and a copy of all such
charges and evidence, together with
any answer and evidence offered by
the accused, and tha recommenda
tions of the advisory board, shall
he attached to the recommendation
of the president of the university;
and the action of the board of trus
tees shall he based solely upon the
recommendation of the preeident of
the university and the record at
tached thereto, there being no
further hearing before the board of
trustees, or any member thereof,
unless the boar in its discretion
shall elect to receive other evidence
in aid of its decision, any such rec
ommendation and information af
fecting the honor or character of
a member of the teaching staff
shall be presented to and acted
upon by the board of trustees sep
arately from anything which may
involve his competency or fitness
in any other respect. The members
of the board shall not in any case
or in any event listen to or receive
