## PRESIDENT JORDAN ISSUES IMPORTANT LETTER. Students Called Upon to Combine in Representative Conference. 
### 
President Jordan yesterday sent
to the prominent student organiza
tions of the University a letter
suggesting the formation of a new
association to be known as the
President's Conference. This let
ter, which follows, explains itself:
Office of the President.
Stanford University, Cal.
Aug. 29, 1906.
Dear
I desire to establish a new or
ganization to be called the Presi
dent's Conference. It is to be com
posed of representative young men,
one each from each of certain lead
ing student organizations to be
chosen by the students concerned,
three from Encina Club. Its pur
poses will be to safeguard the good
name of the University and to pro
mote good understanding between
the executive authorities and the
student body.
The conference will meet at in
tervals of about two months, on the
call of the President of the Univer
sity, who will be ex-ojficio chairman
of the conference. The conference
will choose its own secretary, who
will be the executive channel of
publication of any views the con
ference may decide to express pub
lically. The conference will have
no power of direction or control
over anyone. Its main function is
that of an open court, in which
each person may express freely his
own views or those of the associa
tion he represents and without risk
of misunderstanding or of misquot
ation, no public statements being
made except through the secretary.
New organizations may be ad
mitted on a two-thirds vote of the
members present at any meeting,
two-thirds the actual membership
constituting a quorum. An asso
ciation or a member may be
dropped from the list by the same
vote. Membership shall be for
one collegiate year. When vacan
cies arise, the association interest
ed shall be notified of that fact.
The conference may be dissolved
at the will of the President.
These statements shall consti
tute the constitution of the' Presi
dent's Conference. It may be
amended by a two-thirds vote of
members present, but only with
the approval of the President.
The organizations selected at the
beginning are the following; Enci
na Club (3), the Y. M. C. A., the
fraternities, Nestoria, Euphronia,
the athletes wearing the "S", and
the Press Club.
May I ask to select a rep
resentative to the President's Con
ference as above indicated, report
ing the name of the person chosen
to me? The first meeting will be
called about September 10th.
Very truly yours,
David S. Jordan,
President.
