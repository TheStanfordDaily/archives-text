# REPAIRS PROGRESSING
## WORK ON QUAD BEING RUSHED RAPIDLY. Ultimate Restoration of All Buildings is Planned By Commission of Engineers. 
### 
Work upon the University build
ings has been progressing rapidly
during the summer, and another
week will see the completion of in
terior repairs upon the buildings
most needed for the use of the stu
dent body.
All efforts heretofore have been
directed towards getting the class
rooms ready for the fall semester,
and the latter work would proba
bly have been completed last week
had it not been for a two-week's
strike early in the month, due to
the refusal of union carpenters to
work with a dozen non-union men.
The University having declared
for open shop, the carpenters, stone
masons, plasterers, painters, rig
gers and structural steel workers
walked out. Two weeks later the
men returned to work, and since
then repairs have been rushed.
Shortly after the earthquake,
President Jordan appointed a com
mission, consisting of Professors C.
D. Marx, C. B. Wing, and W. F.
Durand, to examine and report up
on the condition of the buildings.
This report was published in the
Daily Palo Alto last semester.
Later the Board of Trustees em
ployed three of the best structural
engineers in San Francisco, E.
Schultze, J. D. Galloway, and J.
Leonard, to examine the buildings
and hand in a report. Late in
June the Trustees appointed a
Commission of Engineers, consist
ing of Professors Marx, Wing, and
Durand, to have permanent charge
of the reconstruction.
On July 2nd repairs were begun
upon the quad and in Roble and
Encina, over two hundred men be
ing employed. The McGilvray
Stone Company severed its connec
tion with the University and their
work was taken up by the Colusa
Sandstone and Granite Company.
C. E. Hodges, the resident archi
tect, also resigned his position.
The damage in Roble has been
repaired and the plastering in En
cina is practically completed, six
teen rooms in the wings having
been closed until the walls near
them are rebuilt.
The new Library is being taken
down to the first floor and as yet
no plans have been drawn for its
restoration. The new Gymnasium
will also be taken down to the first
floor. Several plans have been
proposed for its restoration, includ
ing a project of roofing over the
first story and extending the floor
space in the rear, but nothing
definite has been decided upon.
Memorial Church will be rebuilt
is as nearly the old form as possi
ble. The flying buttresses will
have to be constructed in some
other form, but expert advice will
be sought before anything is done.
The mosaics will probably be re
placed. A temporary roof will be
placed over the building at once,
but it will be some time before the
work of rebuilding commences.
The organ in the old chapel has
been putin shape and services will
be held in the latter place during
the year.
The work of dismantling Me
morial Arch began this week, and
will last about two months, by
which time it should be taken down
as far as the base, which will be
left standidg. Practically all the
stones can be used in the recon
struction of the Arch, but this
work will be left until toward the
last.
The Chemistry building will un
doubtedly be rebuilt first, but
enough repairs have already been
made to allow the first floor and
basement to be used.
Every building has been care
fully examined and wherever there
are anv siyns of defects, shoring
and bracing have been putin to
make the buildings safe. Several
parts of the quad have been fenced
in, but this has been done more to
give the workmen room in which
to work, rather than because the
walls are especially dangerous.
The parts of the qnad not fenced
in are absolutely safe.
