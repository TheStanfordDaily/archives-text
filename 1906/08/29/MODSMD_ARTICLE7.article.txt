One of the most unfortunate oc
currences of the summer was the
exclusion from Encina Hall of a
number of men who had resided
there for the past three years. They
were not allowed to engage their
rooms last spring owing to the all
pervading uncertainty, and on ar
riving on the campus they found
that their old rooms had been al
ready engaged. Some provision
should have been made in favor of
these men who were old residents,
and if anybody had to be excluded
it should have been the new stu
dents.
