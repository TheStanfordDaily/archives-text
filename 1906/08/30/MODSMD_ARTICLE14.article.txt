# Allen Withdraws as Candidate.
## 
### 
B. S. Allen, '07, ex-editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, has withdrawn
from the tight for re-election to that
office and has left the field clear for
G. O. Spurrier, '07, present manag
ing editor. Allen's withdrawl came
as a great surprise. Until late this
afternoon his running for the office
had been regarded as a certainty,
although the action was unprece
dented in the history of Stanford
politics. Allen assigned no reason
for his withdrawal.
