# ROWERS DO GOOD WORK
## Zimmerman, '07 and Pemberton, 'OS, With Portland Rowing Club, Win Numerous Races. 
### 
With two Cardinal oarsmen as a
nucleus, Stanford's coach, "Dan"
Murphy, developed during the
summer a four-oared crew which
is credited with making world's re
cord time at Portland and which
greatly surprised eastern athletic
circles by capturing second place
in the international fours on Lake
Quinsigamond. Murphy received
a letter from the Portland Athletic
Club shortly after the early closing
of the University, inviting him to
| come north and coach the club
crews during the summer. Theof
-1 fer was accepted and a short time
after F. Zimmerman, '07, and J.
R. Pemberton, '08, went to Port
land in response to Murphy's let
ters asking them to row in his sen
ior boat. Zimmerman and Pem
berton were both members of last
year's Varsity, the former rowing
No. 2 and the latter No. 3.
Two veteran oarsmen of the Port
land Rowing Club, King and Smid,
were added to the Stanford men,
and Murphy put forth his best ef
forts on this experienced material.
The senior four developed rapidly
into a seasoned boat and pulled
away from the best of the northern
crews with ease. On July 4th they
won the open regatta at Portland
and later followed up this victory
by winning the Nelson regatta
which carries with it the coast
chain pionship.
Finally, at Portland, Murphy's
crew in a time trial swung across a
mile and a half course in 8 minutes

1 seconds, three fourths of a sec
ond under the world's record for
that distance. After this perfor
mance the Portland Rowing Club
determined to send their oarsmen
East to the International Regatta
on Lake Quinsigamond. Just be
fore leaving their championship
shell was badly crushed and the
crew rowed all their later races in
an inferior boat, considered by ex
perts to be twenty seconds slow.
The first appearance of the west
ern oarsmen in the East did not
create a favorable impression. Mur
phy trains his men to row with
little or no body swing, and his
style did not please the Eastern ex
perts. While all admired the splen
did physical appearanceof the visi
tors, any suggestion of a chance of
their winning from the fast crews
of New York was looked upon with
contempt.
The international fours, which
occurred the next day, gave rise to
the closest racing of the regatta,
Portland finishing two lengths be
hind the Nonpareils of New York,
and defeating the Winnipegs,River
sides, Ravenwoods, the Mound City
crew, Metropolitans, and a crew
representing the Victoria Boat Club.
The Portland Rowing Club is en
thusiastic over the showing made
by their senior crew, and there is a
possibility that the same four will
go to England next year in an en
deavor to bring back the world's
championship.
