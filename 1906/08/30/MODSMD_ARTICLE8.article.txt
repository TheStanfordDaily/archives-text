A plan has been suggested by
certain upperclassmen whereby the
Sophomore and Freshman classes
will be given an opportunity to face
each other in a battle royal. The
suggestion calls for a football game
to be played on Stanford Field and
certain rules suggested by the up
per classmen which are to govern
the contest have already been ac
cepted by the Sophomores. A
challenge prepared by the Sopho
class will be presented to the Fresh
men tomorrow and if they accept
the contest will take place on Sat
urday afternoon. The game will
give all the members of the under
classes an opportunity of partici
pating and of meeting each other
in fair and square battle. The classes
will be divided evenly and the win
ners will receive the ball as a markof
superiority. The disorder in Encina
Hall, caused largely by the conflict
between Sophomores and Freshmen,
will consequently diminish as per
sonal grievances will be settled once
for all on the day of battle.
