With this issue the present edi
tor bids farewell in his official
capacity to the student body. The
period of his editorship has been
perhaps the most exciting in the
history of Stanford. It began at a
time when student indignation was
wrought up to the highest pitch by
the dismissal of B. S. Allen, '07.
During the same semester occurred
the earthquake which many people
regard as the beginning of a new
era. During this semester of con
flict and strife the editor has been
aided by a staff whose ability, ener
gy and loyalty have been so con
stant that public acknowledgment
of their services is gladly made, for
on them reverts all of the success
which the paper has attained.
The policy of the paper during
the semester which has preceded
this has been to carry out the
methods and ideas which have
been so ably carried on by the edi
tors for many years past. Begin
ning with the regime of 0. A. Wil
son, '04, the work of covering the
news field of the University has

been thoroughly systematized un
til today the news gathering has
been reduced to a science and every
individual is held responsible for a
certain field. Competition for
places on the staff of the paper has
been made more stringent than
ever, and at present the applicant
must pass successfully through a
six week's competition in order to
qualify. This has resulted in the
elimination of those wbose inten
tions are not serious and whose
interest in the welfare of the paper
is only passing. The staff of fif
teen men and women is chosen by
the strictest and altogether mostim
partial competition, and gives its
services always gladly and unhesi
tatingly to serve the University.
The present able staff particularly
deserves the praise of the Universi
ty community.
Gkorge O. Spurrier, '07, who
succeeds to the editorship has
worked long, faithfully and ably
on the staff, and is well qualified
to assume charge. Without hesi
tation we can cordially recom
mend him to the student body.
