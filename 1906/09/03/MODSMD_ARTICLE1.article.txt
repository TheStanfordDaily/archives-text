The Board of Trustees also rati
fied the choice of the deferred com
mencement day, and on Saturday,
September 15th, the class of 1900
will receive their diplomas.
Besides these actions it was de
cided to dispose of the world-fam
ous collection of Stanford jewels in
order that Mrs. Stanford's wish to
establish a library fund from the
proceeds may be gratified. The
jewels which make up the set were
given by Senator Stanford to his
wife at various times during their
European travels. The collection
is conservatively valued at one
million dollars and comprises some
of the handsomest stones in exist
ence. With the money to be de
rived from this sale it was planned
to establish a memorial library
fund with which books and valued
theses were to be purchased. This
idea will now be carried out.
The trustees also decided to sell
the Stiilman ranch in San Bernar
dino, one of the outlying properties
of the University, which is expect
ed to bring in approximately
$35,000.
