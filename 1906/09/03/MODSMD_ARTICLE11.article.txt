The Daily Palo Alto has made
rapid strides during the past few
years toward the height of efficiency
which the editors had in mind when
an impartial competition tryout
system was instituted. In order
that the standard reached may be
maintained, the methods of the
editors who have gone before must
needs be continued. Accordingly
the paper will be conducted during
the next four months along lines
similar to those followed by the
men who have directed the college
paper during the past three years.
The hearty cooperation of the mem
bers of the staff is solicited, for
upon their reliability depends the
thoroughness with which the Uni
versity news field will be covered.
