There is no foundation for the
disfavor with which Freshmen look
upon the office of class president.
This year, as usual, after numerous
men had been named for the office
and had declined, a president was
chosen, only to indignantly resign
through the columns of the Daily
Palo Alto. It would seem that in
a class of several hundred there
would be found eight men capa
ble of serving their class as presi
dent the semester each, whether in
the Freshman or Senior year. The
entering class is in need of a good
leader during the first few months
of confusion, and the man chosen
should recognize his opportunity.
In many instances it may he for
the best interests of the class that

the nominee decline, but when a
man of a caliber sufficiently large
to see the matter in the right light
is selected, he should make the very
best of his opportunity, which may
never come again. The idea that
the student who allows himself to
be chosen Freshman president can
never achieve any great additional
honors in his later college career is
contradicted by many examples.
There is no need of holding the
election so soon after registration.
Allow sufficient time to elapse in
which to find the worthy man, then
let the office bear the dignity that is
its due.
