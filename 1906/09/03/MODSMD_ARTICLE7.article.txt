# SOPHMORES WIN RUSH
## DEFEAT FRESHMEN IN GAME ON STANFORD FIELD. Many Spectators See Struggle Between the Opposing Classes.â€”1909 Has Best Organization. 
### 
Before several hundred specta
tors gathered on the bleachers of
Stanford Field on Saturday after
noon, the Sophomores and Fresh
men indulged in the first organized
rush held here in many years.
Victory went to the Sophomores
with a score of 2-0.
While the rush was not as excit
ing as anticipated, and could be
improved upon next year by the
addition of several new rules in re
gard to open playing, there were
a number of exciting moments dur
ing the game which brought the
spectators to their feet, but during
the rest of the time there was noth
ing to be seen but a struggling
mass of humanity swaying up and
down the field. As it turned out
there were too many men on the
field, preventing open playing,
which in such a contest should be
the principal feature.
The Sophomores gathered at the
training-house under the bleachers,
while the Freshmen met and or
ganized at the corner of the quad
near the History building. By
four o'clock there were over one
hundred Freshmen in line, and
four abreast they marched to the
grounds, entering by the carriage
gate at the lower end of the field.
The Sophomores were already on
the field over one hundred strong.
Captains Cadwalder and Terrill
of the Sophomores and captains
Jordan and Cheda of the Freshmen
met and decided to make the con
test a half hour long with all the
men against one another, rather
than have two halves. The Fresh
men won the toss and took the
kick off.
The classes were very evenly
matched though possibly the Soph
omores had the advantage in num
bers. The referees tried to have
the ball kept in the air as much as
possible but this soon became an
impossible task. The two hundred
or more men on the field became a
whirling mass, while on theoutside
of the circle there were numerous
groups indulging in wrestling mat
ches of their own.
After fifteen minutes of play, the
Sophomores, who were the better
organized, gradually forced the
ball down the field towards their
opponents goal. The Freshmen
fought desperately, but the ball
was finally tossed over their heads
between the goal-posts. A dozen
second year men fell upon it and
the first score was made.
The rush now became fiercer than
ever, though not much could be
seen from the bleachers on account
of the dust. The game had to be
stopped at frequent intervals as
the ball was downed. The Sopho
mores scored another goal by
clever passing and shortly after
this time was called.
