## PRESIDENT JORDAN WILL ORGANIZE COUNCIL. Will Be Composed Along Lines Similar to Men's Organization. 
### 
Following close upon President
Jordan's announcement of the
formation of a men's President's
Conference, comes the word that a
conference will he made up of the
University's representative women.
This women's association will he
modeled after the men's society,
and will have the same general pur
pose in view—that of placing the
President in such a position as to
make suggestion from the student
body an easy matter. The women
making np this conference will be
chosen as follows:
One from each sorority; two from
the women not living either in a
sorority house, or in Pwoble; one
from the Young Women's Christian
Association; and one from the So
cial Service Club. The first meet
ing will he held soon after the
initial conference of the men's asso
ciation.
righteous and sober life—a sober
life first, because to be healthy you
must be temperate in meats and
drinks, prudent in your pleasure,
bridling your body with the bit
and bridle of your will; a righteous
life because to be sane mentally
and morally and happy socially
you must live right; that iH a right
eous life.
"Lastly, a godly life, because to
be healthy spiritually, lo be noble
indeed, you must stand in right re
lations to Ciod. By sober, I mean
seriously minded, self possessed,
simple living. At Stanford this is
a primary gospel. The man who
succeeds at Stanford is the serious
minded man. Many generations
of Freshmen have found that the
soil on the Stanford farm is not
good for wild oats."
