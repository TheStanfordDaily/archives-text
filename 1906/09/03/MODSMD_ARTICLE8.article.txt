Following close upon President
Jordan's announcement of the

Conference, comes the word that a
conference will he made up of the
University's representative women.
This women's association will he
modeled after the men's society,
and will have the same general pur
pose in viewâ€”that of placing the
President in such a position as to
make suggestion from the student
body an easy matter. The women
making np this conference will be
chosen as follows:
One from each sorority; two from
the women not living either in a
sorority house, or in Pwoble; one
from the Young Women's Christian
Association; and one from the So
cial Service Club. The first meet
ing will he held soon after the
initial conference of the men's asso
ciation.
