# REUNION IS PLANNED
## 1906 ISSUES GENERAL INVITATION TO ALUMNI. Executive Committee of Alumni Association Will Appoint Class Secretaries. 
### 
The Alumni Reunion Committee,
owing to the confusion following
the disaster of April 18th, necessar
ily was compelled to give up all
plans of a class reunion this year.
However, a general invitation has
been extended to the classes of
1896, 1901, 1904 and 1906 to be
present at the Senior days of Sep
tember 14th, 15th, and 16th, al
though no special plans will he laid
for their entertainment owing to
the short notice on which the date
was settled.
No officer can be satisfactorily
elected, as it is not probable that
all the members of these classes
will attend. This necessity of hav
ingfor each of these classes a perma
nent secretary has been obviated
by the action of the Executive
Committee of the Stanford Alumni
Association in appointing such a
secretary until the earliest elector
al meeting of the classes.
C. F. Wright, '96, has been
named by the Alumni Executive
Committee as secretary for his
class; 1901 is at present without
any such officer; 1904 has as its
permanent secretary Miss A. Kim
ball, who received the appointment
from her class at its graduation.
These graduates will keep track of
the whereabouts and occupations
of the members of their classes.
The permanent secretary of 1906
will soon be elected, the work here
tofore having heen principally at
tended to by H. I. Cruzan, '06. At
his suggestion blanks have been
printed and placed in the Regis
trar's office for each 1906 man or
woman to fill out. When these
cards have been attended to and
contain the required information
about the graduates they will be
filed with the permanent secretary.
With this system, should the other
classes adopt it, an almost perfect
directory of the alumni can be
turned out.
As to the adoption by the other
classes of the plans of the Perma
nent Alumni Organized Reunions
Committee, no definite steps have
yet been taken. Last Maich com
mittees from all the classes met and
drew up a set of resolutions embod
ying the suggestions of the Senior
Class regarding the entertainment
of the alumni during Commence
ment Week.
The matter was left in somewhat
of an unsettled position, and until
the present Senior class decides to
organize a Reunion Committee
nothing definite will be done.
