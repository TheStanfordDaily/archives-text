# Communication to Alumni.
## 
### 
Owing to the earthquake and the
forced abandonment of the original
commencement plans, the first re
unions under theStanford Duennial
Reunion Plan could not be held.
In the reorganized program for
commencement on September 15th,
these reunions had to be omitted
again. The class of 1906, however,
desires that as many alumni as
possible may return to the campus,
and through the Alumni Reunion
Committee extends a hearty invit
ation to all alumni to be present at
Senior festivities on September 14th
and 15th.
Alumni Reunion Committee,
Harold Ide Cruzan, 'OG,
Chairman.
