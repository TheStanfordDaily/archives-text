The University Library will this
year try the plan of placing some
books for class use on shelves in
the reading room as well as in the
reference room. If each student
will make it a personal matter to see
that books are returned promptly
to the case provided, the arrange
ment will undoubtedly prove much
more satisfactory than the Bystem
used heretofore. Where the class
is a large one the book should not
be kept out for more than an hour
at a time. The library staff must
contend with many inconveniences
until the reconstruction is com
plete, and the work of the assist
ants will be greatly relieved by a
careful observance of these requests
on the part of the students, whose
own convenience will also be best
secured in this way.
