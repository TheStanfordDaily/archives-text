Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In your report of the sermon
preached in the University chapel
on Sunday morning you made the
preacher guilty of remarking upon
"the crudeness of the structure."
No word spoken upon that oc
casion could be so interpreted.
On the contrary I referred rever
ently to the chapel as consecrated
by the pious usage of bygone days.
