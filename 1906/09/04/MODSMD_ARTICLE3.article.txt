# FEW PRACTICE GAMES
## SMALLER COAST COLLEGES WILL NOT PLAY RUGBY. Team May Be Organized In San Francisco For Preliminary Contests. 
### 
When the varsity football squad
lines up in the practice games this
year the familiar teamsof the Pacific
Coast colleges will be missed. None
of the old opponents of the Cardinal
or California will appear in the
Rugby games. .Stanford and Cali
fornia will stand alone in the experi
ment, and therefore will have to
seek in new fields for opponents.
Student body treasurer K. \V. Bar
rett,'o4, during the summer months
corresponded with all the colleges of
Southern California, including Po
mona, University of Southern Cali
fornia,St. Vincents and others with
out result. All have decided to
either stay out or play the old
game. The northern colleges have
taken the same stand. The univer
versities of Washington and Oregon,
Portland AthleticClub,Muhnomah,
Nevada University and Utah all
refused to engage in a Rugby match
with either California or Stanford.
Negotiations have, however, been
carried on with Ilugby enthusiasts
in Vancouver and Victoria. Teams
will be sent from both of these
points. The expense of the trip
will he heavy and will necessarily
be met by the joint efforts of Stan
ford and California. They may
play several games. Plans are be
ing formulated in San Francisco by
which it is hoped an aggregation of
star players of the British game will
be organized to meet the Varsity.
Douglas Erskine, who is interested
in the sport, has undertaken to as
semble former stars from Canada,
New Zealand, Australia and Great
Britain.
With the material for practice
games reduced more play will fall
to the ''scrub" teams. This will
give the required skill but will fail
to meet the financial end of the
proposition.
