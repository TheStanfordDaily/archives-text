# BOOK SYSTEM CHANGED
## POPULAR VOLUMES IN LIBRARY MADE READY ACCESSIBLE. Rooms Altered and Contents Shifted to Enable Reconstruction of Building. 
### 
The reopening of the University
library yesterday was the oppor
tunity for introducing many im
portant improvements in the build
ing and the arrangement of the
hooks. Henceforth all the volumes
that are in constant use by stu
dents in the departments of History,
English, Economics, and Science
will be found on open shelves along
the wall in the desk-room. This
move has been made in order to
give students free access to these
books and relieve the pressure of
supplying them over the desk.
Works used by a given class will
be labeled and will always be found
in the same place. The books on
these shelves will change from time
to time as the progress of study de
mands.
In connection with the refitting
and slight remodelling of the build
ing, the contents of some rooms
have heen shifted from one to
another. The special refer
ence room and the former Hopkins
Library room have heen connected
by a doorway. Practically all the
current periodicals and bound mag
azines have been moved into the
old Hopkins Library room, which
is called the periodical room, and
all dictionaries and encyclopdias
are found in the special reference
room. The former conversation
room now has a doorway into the
catalogue room, and will be used
for the Hopkins Library as soon as
the books in that collection, which
have been moved to their future
place of keeping, can he shelved.
The policy of discouraging talk
ing in the library is manifestly con
tinued, as is evidenced by the cards
tacked upon the desks, requesting
that (hoFe in the library remain as
quiet as possible. A minor change
has been made in the system of
loaning hooks. Each circulaiing vol
ume has a card within its covers
hearing the name of the book and
affording space for the names of its
borrowers. This card is filed when
the book is loaned.
The front rooms of the second
floor have been partitioned off from
the rest of the library, in order
that the front wall of the structure
may be rebuilt. A room in the
basement has heen secured for
History seminaries, and the Ger
man seminary courses are held in
the rooms of that department.
