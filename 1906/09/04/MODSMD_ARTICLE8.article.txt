# MAY REPLACE "QUAD"
## EDITORS OF 1907 ANNUAL PLAN RECORD BOOK. Material Saved from Fire Furnishes Basis for New Annual this Year. 
### 
A meeting of the 1907 Quad board
will be bald to-morrow afternoon,
to discuss plans concerning the
disposition of the partially des
troyed 1907 Quad. It is probable
that a new record book will be fav
ored and the project be submitted
to the consideration of the Senior
class.
The Junior Quad assessment was
turned over to the H. S. Crocker
Publishing Company, of San Fran
cisco, last February as first pay
ment on the Quad. The publishers
have lost about $3,000, as the ma
terial was almost ready to go to
press. At present the Quad is in
debt for the sum of .$lOO, due the
photographers of Palo Alto on
group pictures.
K. A. Bickel, 07, editor of the
Quad, considers a record book of the
'07 Class the only practicable al
ternative for the Quad. In the ma
terial saved from the fire are four
proof-forms of the fraternity sec
tion, and a few proof-pages of the
Josh department. Bickel's objection
against undertaking a new '07
Quad is that it would conflict with
the '08 Quad, resulting probably
in financial unsuccess and a repe
tition of material.
The record book would contain
the complete class roll, all athletic
records, all fraternity, club, and or
ganization records, and a short
history of the class. It would be
of the same binding as the former
Quad.
