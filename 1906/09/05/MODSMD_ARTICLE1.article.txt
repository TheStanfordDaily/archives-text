Fred 11. Lanagan, 'OS, was unan
imously reelected to lead the Man
dolin Club at a special meeting of
the old members last night. 0. A.
Ferguson, '07, was chosen manager
and will also serve on the execu
tive committee of the club, con
jointly with R. H. Moore, '08, and
E. K. Soper, '08.
The first try-out of the season
will be held next Tuesday evening,
September 11th. Men for the club
will be selected at this time.
The tour of the combined clubs
will in all probability be extended
this year. It is proposed to visit
Denver. To make the attempt
feasible a large club will be re
quired. Only nine of the former
members have returned to college,
but it is believed that the entering
class will supply considerable good
material.
The following are the old mem
bers of the cl"b who have returned:
C. A. Ferguson, '07, A. L. Tay
lor, '07, F. B. Gowdy, '07, F. R.

fails the old territory will be cov
