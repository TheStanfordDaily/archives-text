With the election of F l . Zimmer
man, '07, to lead the varsity crew
and the reelection of J. C. Macfar
land, '07, as track captain, the ath
letic outlook for the spring semes
ter is exceedingly bright. Roth of
these men are well qualified to cap
tain the men of their respective
squads and bring out the best there
is in them. Practically the whole
of the track team which was to
have met California last April has
returned to college, and all the
members of the varsity crew selec
ted a few days before the sudden
closing of the University are back
and actively at work. Although
the intercollegiate contests in these
events could not be held last spring,
and neither college could have the
satisfaction of winning,, there is
every reason to feel confident of
a victory for the Cardinal when the
rival universities again struggle for
supremacy. With a track team
and crew composed of veterans and
captained by men who have won
the confidence and support of their
team mates by steady and con
scientious work Stanford's pros
pects for a successful season in ath
letics are indeed excellent.
