For four years Stanford has not
won a victory in the intercollegiate
tennis tournament and those who
should know have concurred in
saying that one of the principal
reasons for this poor showing lies in
the fact that the representatives of
the Cardinal have not the facili
ties for practice which the Califor
nia players enjoy. The Tennis
Club is making a praiseworthy at
tempt to remedy this defect, but its
efforts are seriously handicapped
each year by a large number of
players who take advantage of the
courts, and use the nets and other
equipment of the Tennis Club with
out a thought of adding their fi
>rt to that organiza
of the case demand
,n who uses the pro-
.ub should be a mem
ber, and thus support that organiz
ation in its attempt to turn out a
winning team next semester. The
Encina courts need improvement
and next year's team will need
training. Every tennis man owes
his support in order that the club
may successfully cope with these
problems.
