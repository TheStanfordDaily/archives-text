# BOOKSTORE REPAIRED
## $3400 LOSS SUSTAINED BY TEMBLOR. Valuable Additions to Plant Made Mayfield Bank Will Be Represented. 
### 
The University Bookstore lias
been nearly repaired and is again
in the condition it was before the
earthquake. Only eight days prior
to April 18th the new building was
entered and business begun there.
The temblor wrecked the building
itself so badly as to necessitate en
tire rebuilding, although the stock
and inner fittings and fixtures were
virtually untouched.
The original cost of the Book
store was approximately $14,000;
the loss sustained by the earth
quake was about $3,000. This does
not include an additional deficit of
$300 on a souvenir book being pub
lished in San Francisco at the time
of the fire, and of $100 worth of
publications destroyed in the Paci
fic Press Publishing Company's fire
at Mountain View.
These losses were partially cov
ered by a loan of $2,500 to the
Bookstore Corporation, and with
this resource the ruined building
was torn down and the new walls
begun. The main walls of the new
structure are of brick and specially
prepared cement mortar. The
walls above the openings are made
of reinforced concrete of the plan
conceded by all engineers to he
earthquake proof.
Owing to the destruction of so
many manufacturers' plants in
San Francisco, the Bookstore has
this year enlarged its plant to han
dle a larger stationery business. A
large paper-cutter, punch, and die
stamp have been installed at heavy
expense, which will enable the
Bookstore to handle larger orders.
In addition to these improve
ments, the Mayfield Bank and
Trust Company has arranged to
have a representative at the Book
store daily, for the convenience of
the students, fraternities, and fac
ulty members. Charles J. Crary,
'03, will cash checks and receive
deposits for the bank.
