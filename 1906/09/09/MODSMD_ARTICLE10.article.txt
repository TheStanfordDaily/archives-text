FRIDAY - SEPTEMBER 7. 1906
The annual reception to Fresh
men will occur to-morrow night in
Encina Gymnasium, a nd the plans
of the Christian Associations, under
whose auspices the reception is held,
indicate that it will be the most
elaborate yet given. Entering stu
dents always experience difficulty
in becoming acquainted with their
classmates, and conditions thisyear
are especially unfavorable because
of the confusion attendant upon
the opening of the damaged Uni
versity. Members of the class of
1910 should not fail to take advan
tage of this opportunity of meeting
at the first social gathering of the
year.
