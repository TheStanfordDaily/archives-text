# TO RESUME DUTIES
## HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS WILL BE HERE IN FEW WEEKS. Murray to Arrive at Stanford by 15th, and Fairclough to Start On the 18th. 
### 
Word has been received from Pro
fessor A. T. Murray, head of the
Greek department, who made a trip
East to his former home in New
Bedford, Mass., this summer, that
he will start for Stanford Univer
sity on September 18th. He is ex
pected to arrive about the 23d, up
to which date the class in his course
in Greek Epic will not meet. Stu
dents who have registered in this
course are to read the first two hooks
of the Iliad in lieu of the omitted
lectures, and take an examination
on the same upon the return of
Professor Murray.
Professor Murray's primary pur
pose on his trip East was to visit
his mother, who has been very ill.
While in the East, Professor Murray
gave several lectures on classical
subjects, notably on the Agamem
non of Sophocles. At the summer
conference at Chautauqua he de
livered an illustrated lecture on
Athens.
Professor H. R. Fairclough has
also been in the East during the
summer, part of the time lecturing
at the University of Wisconsin.
He took the opportunity offered by
his trip and visited his home in
Toronto, Canada. Later he re
turned to Madison, Wis., and has
been giving two courses in Latin
during the summer session of that
university. He is expected to be
at Stanford by September 15th.
With the exception of Greek 22
(Epic) the courses scheduled to be
given by Professor Murray and
Fairclough have been divided
among the other members of the
classical departments during the
absence of the head professors.
