class of 1900 by D. D. Sales, '06,
president of last year's Senior class.

The plan for the permanent re

by the reunion committee last year
provides that a class shall unite
the first time two years after grad
uation. Three years later, or five
years after graduation, the same
class will visit the campus again,

and 1905.

fund turned over to him by the
class. Upon the death of the class

trustee, who will place that sum
with the amounts received from
other classes and thus help to make
one large fund, which will be called
the "'Stanford Alumni Scholarship
Fund,'' and the interest from which
will be devoted toward helping a
chosen student through the Uni
versity.
