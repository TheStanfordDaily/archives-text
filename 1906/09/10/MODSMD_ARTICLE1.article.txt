# STANFORD MEN WRITE
## ALUMNI AND FACULTY MEMBERS CONTRIBUTE. Wallace Irwin, '00, Tells of the Shame of the Colleges.—Many Articles on Earthquake. 
### 
Stanford authors have been ac
tive within the last few months, as
is manifest from the large quantity |
of stories, articles, and poems that
have appeared in a great number
of magazines of such wide scope as
to include topics ranging from hot
any to nursery rhymes and the re
alistic side of the temblor to the
scienti tic.
The ftuthors are found in the
ranks of lhe alumni, among the
newest graduates, and several are
members of the faculty. Perhaps
the literary production which has
earned most observance is ' l Ihe
Shame of the Colleges, ' by \\ allace
Irwin, ex-'OO, a series of witty
satires that have been running in
the Saturday Evening Post on what
Irwin deems the collective person
ality and characteristic atmosphere J
that pervades our leading Ameri
can universities, lhe first article J
on Harvard and the "Gentleman,
Trust" was published on August
4th. The progress of the series has
been marked every two weeks since
by the issue of another article, the
second being on Yale and the " Dem
ocratic Machine."
The latest to come out concerned
"Princeton, Frenzied But Una
shamed," and had for its motif the
Prineetonian enthusiasm as mani
fested in yelling. Much conjecture
has been expressed as to whether
the brilliant Stanford author will
incarnate the spirit of his Alma
Mater in the series which he is now
contributing. Irwin is one of the
moßt prolific of present day authors.

"The Literary Horrors Club," a
poem in the Bookman for June;
