# Many Positions Unfilled.
## 
### 
Owing to the condition of the
campus after the earthquake there
has been an unprecedented demand
for student labor of all kinds. The
Young Men's Christian Association
has maintained an employment
bureau since opening week, which
has filled 170 applications for
work, aggregating approximately
$900 for the month. There are
still many places open. There
have been a large number of appli
cations for Japanese students and
most of these remain unfilled, as
the number of Japanese entering
the University has been less than
usual.
