# RALLY OPENS FOOTBALL SEASON
## Moulton, Lanagen, and Stott Urge Men to Try Rugby Game. 
### 
Stanford's first Rugby football
season was opened Friday night
with an enthusiastic rally in En
cina Gymnasium, when 116 men
signed up for Rugby. Fully five
hundred students were present, and
Coach James F. Lanagan, Trainer
"Dad" Moulton, and Captain E. P.
Stott, '07, the three speakers of the
evening, received tremendous ap
plause when they urged everybody
to come out and try the new game
and predicted a successful football
season for the Cardinal players.
The rally opened with about live
minutes of yelling and singing, and
then "Dad" Moulton, the popular
trainer, came forward and said a
few words in regard to the coming
football season.
He said in part: "This is an en
tirely new game which we are go
ing to play this year and I do not
know any more about it than you
do. But 1 feel confident that with
the same old spirit that we have
had in past seasons and with a de
termination to back up Coach Lan
agan in his work we will have a
successful season.Everybody should
come out and try this game. And
I would like to say a word about
training rules —they must be kept.
The old men all know thid and I
feel sure it will not take the Fresh
men long to find that training rules
cannot be broken at Stanford. 1
can't tell just how, but I feel sure
that we are going to win this year,
when we meet California in this
new game."
Coach Lanagan followed Trainer
Moulton with a short speech in
which he said: "There are only
two or three things I would like to
say about this new game which I
think a good many of you here do
i not understand. The first is that
, you can't learn to play this game
in three or four weeks. 1 learned
that this summer when I was in
Canada for that length of time. It
may take us three or four seasons
to learn this game, but when we do
learn it and have men with hearts
like last year's varsity men, we
need not be afraid of any team. 1
do not want any men to come out
and try for this team in a half
hearted manner."
Captain Stott was the last speak
er of the evening, and he said: "We
are going to play Rugby football
this year, and as Stanford is enter
ing upon a new football era I be
lieve every fellow who can spare
the time should come out and try
the new game. I feel confident
that with such a coach as Lanagan
we can develop a winning team.
Training rules will begin Monday
afternoon at 4:45 at the first prac
tice."
