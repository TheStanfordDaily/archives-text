# NEVADA ADOPTS RUGBY
## SAGE BRUSHERS WILL TRY NEW GAME. Stanford Schedules Match and Will Also Play Vancouver and Victoria Teams. 
### 
News has just bean received from
Reno, Nevada, that the University
of Nevada has definitely adopted
Rugby football. This will greatly
add to the interest taken in the
new game on the Coast, and will
mean more and better games for
both Stanford and California. The
reason for Nevada's change is prin
cipally because of her inability to
find matches should she continue
playing the old game.
A temporory schedule of games
for the Varsity has been drawn up
which includes five college teams.
So far us is known at present the
dates of the games will be as fol
lows: Nevada, about October 20ih,
Victoria, about October 27ih, and
Vancouver, about November 3d.
Other games are being arranged
with Pomona College, which has
taken up Rugby, and Santa Clara
College is considering the adoption
of the new game.
Pomona has decided to play the
English game along with the old
sport. This peculiar step was tak
en through a desire to keep up ath
letic relations with the two big
northern universities, and at the
same time to have the old game
played locally.
