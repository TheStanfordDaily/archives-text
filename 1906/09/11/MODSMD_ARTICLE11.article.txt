In the first Rugby practice last
evening the zest with which the
men took hold of the game was
very noticeable, but the spirit of
those who viewed the practice from
the bleachers cannot be equally
commended. A tendency to be
amused rather than pleased was
manifest, and the efforts of the
players were met with disinterest
rather than praise.
This attitude of indifference tow
ard the new game will doubtless
change to one of intense interest
when the merits of the game he
come more generally known. Hug
by has been permanently resolved
upon, and will be played this year
at least. The number and quality
of the men who have signed up for
the Varsity and Freshman teams
is a sufficient guarantee that the
game, although not adopted at the
wish of the students, will be given
a thorough and fair test. We have
coaches and trainer, unequalled on
the coast, who are enthusiastic over
the new game and will get the very
best results possible out of it. With
the adoption of Rugby by Nevada
and other coast colleges the outlook
becomes much brighter. It remains
to be seen whether or not the Eng
lish game has qualities sufficiently
superior to those of the old game to
enable it to overcome the prejudice
existing in favor of the latter.
