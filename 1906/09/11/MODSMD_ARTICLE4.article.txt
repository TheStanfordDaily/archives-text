# Repairing Chemistry Building.
## 
### 
Extensive repairs are now being
carried on in ihe Chemistry build
ing. The damage in this depart
ment proved much more severe
tban was at first thought, conse
quently it was impossible to open
the entire building this year. Ow
ing to the prompt action taken by
the Commission of Engineers the
entire lower floor has has been put
in readiness for the first semester's
work.
All the rooms on the second floor,
with the exception of the reference
library, are in a badly crippled con
dition. The work is progressing,
but it will be six months before the
rooms will be ready for occupancy.
The closing of the two large labora
tories on the second floor has forced
double work on the rooms of the
first floor, but there are ample ac
commodations for all studentß.
Wooden casements have been
built on three sides of the large
laboratory on the first floor, as the
outer stone walls will need entire
rebuilding. The private laborator
ies are not in condition for immedi
ate u-e.
The aparatus was not damaged
to any great extent and $750 will
cover the loss on all of the labora
tory material which were destroyed.
Temporary repairs of wood to re
place the stone have been made
both in front and rear of the upper
stories of the laboratory building.
Malthoid roofing has been used as
a substittte for the Spanish tiles.
The ventilation of the building will
be greatly improved.
The Assaying building suffered
little damage. The arches over the
entrance will need rebuilding and
a few repairs on the roof will be
made.
Professor J. M. Stillman states
that the work of restoration will
not be completed until August
1907.
