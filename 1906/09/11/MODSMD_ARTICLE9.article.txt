# FAST RUGBY PRACTICE
## SQUADS TAKE HOLD AT FIRST TRIAL. Candidates Taught Rudiments Of English Game on Stanford Field Yesterday. 
### 
One hundred and seven men,
clad in nondescript garments of
every sort and kind, appeared on
Stanford Field yesterday afternoon
for the first Rugby practice of the
season. The work was all rudimen
tary but Lanagan introduced seve
ral marked innovations, which
showed that from the start the can
didates must prepare to find great
differences between the English and
American games.
For the first ten minutes of prac
tice, the men went through fast set
ting up exercises under the leader
ship of G. J. Presley, '07. Then the
Frenhman and varsity candidates
were separated, assistant coach
Bansbach taking the former and
Lanagan the latter. Ex-captain
A. J. Chalmers, '07. assisted Lana
gnn, and Captain E. P. Stott, '07
helped Bansbach with the first year
men.
The squads were first warmed up
catching the ball from a pass and
then were divided and lined up to
practice punting and handling
kicks. The men were instructed
not to fall on fumbled balls hut to
pick them up on the run. Every
man was given a chance to punt.
Most of the candidates seemed to
have trouble at first in handling
the Rugby balls which are larger
round the center than the old
American pigskin.
Then came the most interesting
part of the day's work. The squads
were lined up and five men at a time
were started down the field on the
run, passing and catching the ball
at full speed. In Rugby every pass,
to l)e onside, muet be backward
and it took some time for the run
ners to learn to drop behind the
man with the ball and run ahead as
it came their turn to handle it.
The distances between the runners
were short and there was none of
the long clean passing which mar
ked the work of the New Zealanders,
but the men took hold well and had
made marked improvement when
Lanagan ended the practice with
a run around the field.
While the run was in progress a
squad of fourteen were lined up in
scrimmage formation with forwards
clustered together and the backs
opened out in a line. The ball was
kicked, not passed, from the for
wards and was then tossed on
backwards as they ran down the
the field. Later Lanagan lined the
forwards up against each other and
put the ball into play by throwing
it between them. The work was
exhausting and most of the men
showed poor condition,but all went
at the new game hard and the
whole practice was fast and snappy.
Some three hundred students
lined the bleachers to watch the
practice. There was very little en
thusiasm among them over the be
ginnings of the new game.
