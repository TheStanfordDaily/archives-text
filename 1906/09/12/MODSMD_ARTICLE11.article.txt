# RUGBY PRACTICE CONTINUES.
## Men Taught Punting On Run With Either Foot. 
### 
Kicking on the run with either
foot was the innovation in last
night's Rugby practice. The men
were starTed down the field in
squads of five, pat-sing the hall on
the run. When the hacks on the end
received the ball, they were in
structed to punt it out in front of
their squad in such a manner that
it could l>e easily recovered on the
bounce or fly. Ihe candidates
seemed to have difficulty in getting
their punts from the left foot, but
the rest of the work at passing on
the run showed a noticeable im
provement over the first night s
practice.
The first part of practice was de
voted to the usual instruction in
punting and catching. As at Mon
day's practice, the Freshmen squads
wpi'p in charge of Hansbacb and
Stott, while Lanagan and Chal
mers handled the Varsity candi
dates. The first year men seem to
have an abundance of material in
their ranks, and displayed more
ginger last night than at the first
practice.
