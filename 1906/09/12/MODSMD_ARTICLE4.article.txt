# ELECTRIC LINE COMING
## UNIVERSITY TO BE CONNECTED WITH NEIGHBORING TOWNS. Trustees To Determine Route of Trolley Line Through University. 
### 
Only the selection of one of sever
al surveyed routes through the
campus of Stanford University hy
the Board of Trustees is necessary
to open the way for an electric
railroad, which, it is expected, will
in six months he skirling the foot
hills of the Sierra Moreno range
from Los Gatos and San Jose to
! San Carlos, and also connecting
j the University with the towns of
; Palo Alto, Santa Clara, and Red
wood City.
The Peninsular Railway Com
pany, which is building the road,
has acquired practically all the
land necessary for its right of way
except a strip through the Univer
sity campus, permission to use
which has been solicited of the
: Board of Trustees. The Hoard has
I appointed a special committee to
.confer with the officials of the new
line, who, for the most part, are
men high in the service of the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
C. G. Lathrop, treasurer of the
University, and Judge S. F. Leib,
of San Jose, lately president of the
Board of Trustees, are members of
this committee. The mattter of
routes through the campus has
, been referred to the Commission of
| Engineers of the University, whose
| members are Prof. C. 1). Marx,
head of the department of Civil
Engineering, chairman, Prof. \V.
F. Durand, head of the department
of Mechanical Engineering, and
Prof. C. B. Wing of the Civil En
gineering department, for consider
ation and recommendation. It is
anticipated that the special com
mittee of the Board of Trustees will
meet within two weeks and report
! to the Board the best route to be
thrown open as a riuht of way for
' the trolley cars. If this is done it
i will be possible for the Trustees to
I take up the subject of granting the
necessary permission at their next
meeting, which would occur,accord
ing to schedule, on September 28th.
Various routes have been laid
out across the campus by the sur
veyors of the Peninsular Company,
j All of these courses, however, pass
in the rear of the University build
lings and the houses on Lasuen
street. One comes to the south
gate of the University at the end of
! Lasuen street, where it is planned
to have a station.
The corporation which is pushing
| the road to a rapid completion re
jcently became the owners of an
J electric line now in operation be
j tween Los Gatos, Saratoga Springs
! and San Jose over a triangular dis
i tance of twenty-eight miles. That
{the company expects to use this fu
' ture branch as a center from which
| to extend their trackage is evident
i from the fact that they have al
ready commenced work in the vi
cinity of the lately purchased road.
Ten thousand tons of steel rails
have arrived at San Jose and Los

Gatos and will be laid a? soon as
the labor of preparing a roadbed
to receive them has been complet
ed It is the intention of the ofli
ciale of the new railroad eventually
to run their cars into San Mateo.
As they plan to have the southern
portion of their line in operation as
far north as San Carlos within six
months, it seems that hut a short
time will elapse until the seven
mile pap between San Carlos and
San Mateo will he covered and
complete communication by elec
tric railway will he established
from San Jose through Stanford
University to San Francisco.
