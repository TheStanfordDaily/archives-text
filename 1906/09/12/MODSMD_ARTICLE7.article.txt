In another column of this issue
of the Daily Palo Alto will be
found an account of the election of
the leader of the Glee Club for the
coming year. From the complaints
to be heard regarding the manner
in which the election vvasconducted,
it is evident that there is more to be
told than appears in the news arti
cle. Specifically, certain men who
are not members of the Glee Club,
and who, therefore, have no right
to a vote in that organization, were
present at last night's meeting and
cast their ballot for one of the can
didates for the leadership.
It is not a question of whether or
not the result of the balloting would
have been different had these men
been barred from voting, as they
should have been had the constitu
tion been followed. What concerns
the student body is the fact that an
organization that is representative
of Stanford, and which is financed
by the Associated Students, is able
to inaugurate such practices with
out a vigorous protest from its
members.
Article IV, Section 1, of the con
stitution of the Combined Musical
Clubs, says: "Glee Club. —A mem
ber shall be one who was successful
in the final try-out, and who has con
formed to the rules as to rehear
sals." In the issue of the Daily
Palo Alto for Tuesday, December
12th, 1905, there was published the
list of men who were successful in
making the final try-out and had
been chosen to make the Southern
trip with the club. In this list the
names of the men in question do
not appear, nor were their names
added before the trip was taken.
Section 111 of the same article
states: "The leader shall be elected
by a majority of men who are mem
bers of the Glee Club." The con
stitution of the club was published

in the Daily Palo Alto on Wed
nesday, April 11, 1906.
An election by a student body
organization in violation of itß pub
lished constitution should not pass
unchallenged. Before the adoption
of a constitution by the Combined
Clubs such matters were regulated
by precedent, but it is safe to say
that no past action of the club
would warrant the radical step
taken last night. Certain it is that
if this action is allowed to stand, a
bad precedent will have been estab
lished which must be contended
with in future elections.
