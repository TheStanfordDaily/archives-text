The Daily Pai.o Alto publishes
to-night an account of the meeting
of the Glee Club this afternoon
which explains how a general mis
understanding of the circumstances
under which the recent election took
place was possible. Tt seems that
the record of the club was mislaid,
but has been found in time to be
produced at the meeting to-day.
No public announcement has been
made of the membership of the Glee
Club, and it was due to this fact
that the student body had no clear
conception of what men were actu
ally members. The fact that the
Glee Club has been roused to a real
sense of its responsibility will doubt
less result in in some needed reforms
in the near future, but we wish it
clearly understood that no per
sonal implications were intended
in our criticism last evening.
