# Assembly Hall Ready for Use.
## 
### 
The repairs upon Assembly Hall
are being rushed and tbe auditori
um will be ready for tbe dress re
hearsal of the Senior farce to-night.
In repairing the buildings of the
University special attention has
been given Assembly Hall. The
entire auditorium has been renov
ated and now appears in more per
fect condition than formerly.
The stage itself has been im
proved. The gridiron which was
suggested by Sword and Sandals
last semester has been installed.
Those in charge say that improve
ments were made to do away with
the danger of fire to which the
building was exposed under the old
system of drops. All of the cur
tains and drop scenes will be sup
ported by the gridiron, which is
now in place. The arrangement
of the gridiron will make possible
rapid shifting of scenes and will
eliminate the rope devices formerly
used.
