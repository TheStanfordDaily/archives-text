mer, a Stanford student learned
that it was customary at Yale, Har
vard, Princeton, Cornell, and other
large colleges to have "Bull Dur
ham Smokers.'' These smokers are
in the form of rallies held every
year dining the football and base
ball seasons. The "Buil Durham"
tobacco company furnishes enough
tobacco to liberally supply all those
attending the rally.
The Company was accordingly
visited and arrangements made for
having similar smokers at Stanford.
It agreed to furnish enough tobacco
to amply provide all those at the
rally. Yesterday thpre arrived on
the campus seventy-five pounds of
tobacco, which will be distributed
on the bleachers at practice next
Friday afternoon. It was origin
ally planned to have the smoker in
the evening during one of the foot
ball rallies, but as no occasion is
offered in the near future, it was
decided to have it immediately in
the open air.
