Peter Tewksberry, a plain busi

the vagaries of bis daughter, Alicia,
who turns the house into a place of
entertainment for artists, musi
cians, painters and Bohemian so
ciety in general. He writes to his
old friend Robert Scott to send his
son and a friend to visit them, hop
ing in this way to distract Alicia

from her other society. He becomes
angry and decides not to send the
letter, hut Fritz, an old servant,
finds and mails it without his
knowledge. Prior to this, Alicia
has asked M. Anatole du Boisse, a
French poet, to make their house
his headquarters while in America.
While she is out making prepara
tions for a reception in his honor
that evening, Bob Scott and his
chum, Gordon Latimer, arrive.
Fritz mistakes them for the poet
and his secretary, comments on
their ordinary appearance, and re
veals the fact that Miss Tewksberry
likes only verv original people.
Scott, thinking that he means by
"Miss Tewksberry" Philippa, whom
he has met in Germany and fallen
in love with, decides to play the
part of the poet. At dinner be
realizes that he has mistaken Alic
ia for Philippi, but it is too late to
change his plans.
At the reception Scott is the most
eccentric of the eccentric there and
as M. du Boisse makes a great sen
sation. During the course of the
evening the real M. du Boisse ar
rives, is taken for a French waiter,
and put to work. Latimer finds
that he falling in love with Alicia.
Latimer is assuring Scottthat Alicia
loves him when old Mr. Tewksberry
overhears them. He accuses Alicia,
who denies it. After the reception
Philippa and Alica walk in the
garden. Alicia confesses that she
cares for Latimer and Philippa that
she cares for Scott, whom she imag
ines M. du Boiss6. The real M. du
Boiss6 overhears her statement and
is much disturbed. He appeals to
Mr. Tewksberry and they quarrel.
Scott creeps down to the dining
room at midnight to get something
to eat. Philippa comes for a simi
lar purpose, recognizes Scott now
without his poet garb, and he con
fesses everything. They concoct a
plan by which Latimer is made to
propose to Philippa.

The synopsis of the play is as
follows:
Peter Tewksberry, a plain busi
ness man, is much worried over
the vagaries of bis daughter, Alicia,
who turns the house into a place of
entertainment for artists, musi
cians, painters and Bohemian so
ciety in general. He writes to his
old friend Robert Scott to send his
son and a friend to visit them, hop
ing in this way to distract Alicia

from her other society. He becomes
angry and decides not to send the
letter, hut Fritz, an old servant,
finds and mails it without his
knowledge. Prior to this, Alicia
has asked M. Anatole du Boisse, a
French poet, to make their house
his headquarters while in America.
While she is out making prepara
tions for a reception in his honor
that evening, Bob Scott and his
chum, Gordon Latimer, arrive.
Fritz mistakes them for the poet
and his secretary, comments on
their ordinary appearance, and re
veals the fact that Miss Tewksberry
likes only verv original people.
Scott, thinking that he means by
"Miss Tewksberry" Philippa, whom
he has met in Germany and fallen
in love with, decides to play the
part of the poet. At dinner be
realizes that he has mistaken Alic
ia for Philippi, but it is too late to
change his plans.
At the reception Scott is the most
eccentric of the eccentric there and
as M. du Boisse makes a great sen
sation. During the course of the
evening the real M. du Boisse ar
rives, is taken for a French waiter,
and put to work. Latimer finds
that he falling in love with Alicia.
Latimer is assuring Scottthat Alicia
loves him when old Mr. Tewksberry
overhears them. He accuses Alicia,
who denies it. After the reception
Philippa and Alica walk in the
garden. Alicia confesses that she
cares for Latimer and Philippa that
she cares for Scott, whom she imag
ines M. du Boiss6. The real M. du
Boiss6 overhears her statement and
is much disturbed. He appeals to
Mr. Tewksberry and they quarrel.
Scott creeps down to the dining
room at midnight to get something
to eat. Philippa comes for a simi
lar purpose, recognizes Scott now
without his poet garb, and he con
fesses everything. They concoct a
plan by which Latimer is made to
propose to Philippa.
The class of 1906 will present
"The Original Miss Tewksberry"
in Assembly Hall to-morrow night
at 8:15 Miss Stella F. Wynne,
'06, wrote the play for presentation
in Senior Week last May, but the
closing of the University prevented
the carrying out of the plans.
