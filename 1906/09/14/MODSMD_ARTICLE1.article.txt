# CHANGE IN TRY-OUTS
## PROFESSIONAL WILL CHOOSE GLEE CLUB MEMBERS. Prof. H. Roberts Will Select Men at First Trial Monday Evening.

The following communication
has been received from the exec
utive committee of the Glee Club,
in regard to changes in the meth
od of trying out new members:
Editor 1 >a11.y Pai.o Alto:
Reports have recently come to
the executive committee of the
Glee Club that some members of
the student body are dissatisfied
with the customary manner of
choosing the members of this
organization. Without exception
these reports seem to have origi
nated in the complaints of unfair
nes made by men who have been
unsucessful in the try-outs for
the club. As members of the
present executive committee of
the Glee Club, and for the Glee
Club itself, we do not deem it
necessary nor worth while to en
ter into a discussion of the
truth or falsehod of these com
plaints, but in order to remove
all possibility of such charges in

the future, we wish to publish,
through the columns of your pa
per, the details of a new plan,
which has been adopted by the
executive committee for select
ing the members of the club.
The constitution of the Com
bined Musical Clubs, which has
been endorsed by the Executive
Committee of the student body
as well as by the Faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs, leaves
the selection of members of the
clubs entirely to the judgment of
their respective executive com
mittees. The Executive Com
mittee of the Glee Club has de
termined to wave this power of
judging the voice at try-outs and
rest it entirely in a professional
vocal instructor, who will be
thoroughly disinterested and still
be competent to choose the best
voices.
For the past two years the re
hearsals of the Glee Club have
been directed by Prof. 11. Roland
Roberts of Palo Alto. Mr. Rob
erts is a graduate of the Indiana
Conservatory of Music, and the
Conservatory of Music and Dra
matic Art at the University of
Chicago. lie has also studied
under Dr. James Savage of New
York, lie is now engaged in the
practice of his musical profession
