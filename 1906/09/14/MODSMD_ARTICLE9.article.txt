With the production of the
Senior Farce this evening 1906
begins its commencement. The
class is deserving of the highest
praise for the perseverence and
determination displayed in ar
ranging the three days of festivi
ties against the adverse condi
tions met with, The time in
which to make the preparations
was extremely short, and
the graduates were widely
scattered. In spite of these ob
stacles, a program of exercises
has been arranged which has all
the merits of a term-end com
mencement, and in addition en
joys the advantage of occurring at
a time when all the undergradu
ates are on the campus. The
fact that Stanford is publicly
graduating the "earthquake"
class is in itself of great import
ance in contradicting the popular
idea that the University was de
moralized by the disaster of
April 18th.
