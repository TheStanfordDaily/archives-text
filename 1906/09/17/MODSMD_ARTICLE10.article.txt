The class of 1906 wound up its offi
cial career at Stanford by an act which
reflects as much credit upon its mem
bers as any which it performed in its
undergraduate days. The gift of two
hundred dollars to the track is a gift
made in a good cause and at an op
portune time. With the payment of all
outstanding debts the Graduate Man
ager finds himself with exactly one hun
dred and forty dollars at his command,
and the financial success of Rugby still
a problem that admits of no present
solution. There is moreover seven hun
dred dollars raised by student body as
sessment, which although officially vot
ed to the new track was spent of neces
sity in other channels. But the new
track has already been banked and
cleared with the money raised last year.
It must be graded and strengthened 011
the embankment with stone against the
wash of the fast approaching rains,
and here is where the two hundred
dollars from '06 will be put to its best
use.
But the grading and strengthening
will not complete the task of the stu
dent body. There still remain bleach
ers to be built and not every class or
organization can afford to be substan
tially patriotic as 06 was. There are
one hundred men signed up for track
and they are not the only consideration.
Last spring Stanford held on the old
oval the greatest preparatory school
meet in the history of the Coast. It
takes only a glance at the list of Fresh
men signed up for fall training to show
what that meet did for us. This spring
we are preparing to repeat that meet
and for that repetition a new track is
not an ornamental adjunct but a plain
necessity.
We must build the track. To build it
we must have money. To get that mon
ey the student body and the various
college organizations following the
lead of [906, must lie willing to demon
strate that there i> more to Stanford
Spirit than the singing of songs and
the crowding of the bleachers.
