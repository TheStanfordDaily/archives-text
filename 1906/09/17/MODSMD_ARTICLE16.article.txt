# Scrimmage Work is Started.
## 
### 
Captain Stott scored the first try of
the Rugby season Saturday afternoon
in a practice scrimmage between teams
picked from the Juniors and Seniors
on the varsity squad. The work was
the fastest and most interesting on
Stanford field this semester. Both
classes were represented by full fifteens
and the twenty minutes scrimmage was
as hard fought as an intercollegiate
contest.
The weight of the Junior forwards
gave them a decided advantage at the
start and they drove the Seniors back
rapidly past the center of the field.
There 1907 picked the ball out of the
scrum and by clever passing in the
back field worked it out to Stott at
right wing. He had a clear field and
was never headed until he crossed the
Senior goal line.
The tackling on both sides was hard
and clean and the forwards scrum quar
tan and live-eighths did good work. In
the backfield there was too great a ten
dency to hold in to the ball anil run
with it instead of passing or dribbling
from back to back.
Before the scrimmage work began
the Varsity and Freshmen were lined
up against each ither in squads of five
and practiced in back field work. I'.. 1).
