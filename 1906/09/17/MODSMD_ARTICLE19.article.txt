# FOWLER READS CLASS HISTORY
## Survey of College Career of 1906 Shows a Disaster Every Year. 
### 
The Class History, read by VV. H.
B. Fowler, the 1906 historian, contained
a comprehensive survey of the event
ful life of the class. It follows in full:
The other day I heard two letters
applied to the class of 1906 —the let
ters "K. K." Naturally curious, I
inquired their special significance, and
was told that they stood for "Kalam
ity Klass."
A survey of the college career of
the class of iqo6 will convince any
one that the term "K. K." is rather
appropriate. The four years that the
men and women about to depart
spent at this University were certain-

ly strenuous. Things seemed to hap
pen just as soon as we got here. In
deed it must have been a humdrum
college before the fateful day in 1902
when we regisered. And things con
tinued to happen until we left. I feel
safe in claiming that our final wind
up was the most strenuous in the his
tory of any university of modern
times. We take no special credit
upon ourselves for this, but none the
less, now that it is all over, we can
speak of it as a fitting conclusion to
our career.
In our Freshman year we went
through the terrible typhoid epi
demic that claimed the lives of many
of our fellow students. Daily men
and women whom we met constantly
in our work and knew well were
taken away to a hospital or to their
homes, some to recover after weeks
of suffering, but too many to pass
beyond. The courage of Stanford
men and women was surely tried in
those days, and from the tragedy
Stanford emerged strong.
We were to lie tried again in our
Sophomore year. As, a twelve-month
before, we had been almost over
whelmed by the dread typhoid, now
we had to face the Hardly less ter
rible diphtheria. This disease too
claimed its victims from our midst,
taking friends and associates. With
the epidemic of the previous year
fresh in their minds, many took a
very gloomy view of the situation.
As Juniors we had to face the sad
dest event in the University's history,
already so full of tragedy. This was
the passing of the joint founder of
the University, Jane Eathrop Stan
ford, under the most distressing cir
cumstances. None of us will forget
the sense of shock when the sorrow
ful tidings reached the campus at 8
o'clock on that eventful morning.
We heard, but we were reluctant to
believe until we could no longer
evade the truth. And then we had
the long and sorrowful wait until we
were able to pay our last tribute to
the memory of the noble woman.
The fourth year of the class of
1906 came, and we waited to see what

should make this year memorable.
The unjust and arbitrary dismissal of
the editor of the"Daily Palo Alto"
stirred the University from top to
bottom, and the class of 1906 cer
tainly seemed to have lived up to
their trouble record. But neither
they nor the college were to escape
so easily, for there came along the
earthquake, which shook the Univer
sity from bottom to top. The earth
quake shook the class of 1906 out of
college, and thereat we are sorry, be
cause there is much work to be done
here, under conditions that are not al
together pleasant, and we would like
to be with you of the other classes
in the reconstruction test that you
must go through. But, departing,
we have no fears, for we know that
every Stanford man and woman of
the present and every Stanford man
and woman that is to be will live
up to the Stanford standard and rise
above every difficulty.
The class of 1906 has not been a
particularly strong class athletically,
but it has contributed a fair share to
the athletic successes of the Univer
sity. P906 lost their Freshman foot
ball match with California; lost it fair
and square. And yet the Freshmen
furnished to the Varsity that year
Magce, a great punter, and Sprott,
one of the finest tackles who ever
came to this college, and who sub
sequently was chosen football cap
tain. Other varsity men of the class
were George W. Smith, W. R. Scho
field, J. N. Stanford, W. E. Lyons
and P. T. Frizzell.
The earthquake unjustly deprived
Captain Sales, 1906, of the privilege
of breaking the baseball hoodoo that
has hung over the University for
! several years, for the playing of the
third game last spring was hardly
more than a formality. There was
no danger there in counting the
chickens ahead of time. 1906 men
who have made the Varsity in base
ball, besides Captain Sales, are W.
Wirt, R. A. Williams, J. H. Colbert
and E. G. Dudley.
On the track the 1906 members of
the intercollegiate teams have been
I 11. F. Lovell, F. R. Estes, A. I. Stiles,
M. J. Weller and R. F. West (later
members of 1907), 1. J. Bounds, L. G.
j Russell and A. C. Freeman.
What the class of 1906 has lacked
| in track material it has endeavored
I to atone for by inaugurating an inter
j scholastic meet to be held on the
' Stanford campus every year, so that
I a large number of athletes will be
j given a fine chance to see the beau
ties of the co-education system and
j what a fine place this is to live in.
In tennis the 1906 man most con
spicuous has been George 1 lodge,
acknowledged one of the best play
ers the collcgc has had in years.
A certain amount of credit for the
progress of boating at Stanford must
be given to R. 11. Gaither, 1906, cap
| tain and coach of the crew. Of the
lirst intercollegiate crew, three of the
live men in the boat were members
j of 1006 —Gaither, A B. Cheadle and
I B. Bryan.
In the athletics of the girls the
most prominent igc6 women have
been Miss Jane Spaulding, Miss Em-
I ma Hayward, Miss G. Pitman, Miss

Mary Betz and Miss Florence Grace.
In a literary way members of the
class of 1906 have done perhaps a lit
tle more than their share. Four men
who entered with the class have been
editors-in-chief of the"Daily Palo
Alto"—W. H. B. Fowler, L. R. Wein
man, Ben S. Allen and H. P. Bittner.
The policy of these editors has been
officially condemned as too progres
sive and plain-spoken for a college
paper. They have not sought, how
ever, to simulate official displeasure
rather to present plain and unvarnish
ed facts to the students who elected
them to their position. And the edi
tors believe that they have given emi
nent satisfaction to the great major
ity of the student body and of the
faculty.
Other members of the class of 1906
who have been prominent in the
"Daily Palo Alto" work are Clyde
M. Hadley, C. G. Atwood, Miss Hazel
Pedlar and A. N. Lewis, Jr.
Two members of 1906 have been
editors of the literary monthly, the
"Sequoia." These editors were Miss
Edith Mirrielees and Paul Edwards.
The columns of the "Sequoia" have
been freely contributed to by mem
bers of the class, and notable among
these contributors has been Miss Stel
la Wynne, who has already won rec
ognition from the great magazines of
the nation.
Upon the "Chaparral" board have
been found Joel Nibley, Chet Lyman,
M. M. Stearns, G. G. Altnow, L. R.
Weinmann and I. C. Ackerman.
To Ernest R. May must be given the
credit for produring a "Quad" that has
no superior and only one equal—the
"Quad" of the class of 1904, edited
by Ike Russell. The associate mem
bers of the "Quad" board were Allen,
Gaboon, Dudley, Edwards, Fowler,
Nibley, Stearns, Edith Mirrielees and
Alice llayes.
And here, speaking for the class of
1906, I beg to tender tlie class of 1907
our most sincere repret at the utter
destruction of their "Quad," and to
pledge to them any aid that 1906
men or women can give in repairing
tlie great loss.
In debating many '06 men have
been prominent. Alexander Sheriffs,
formerly '05, winner of a Carnot
medal, and member of intercollegiate
man. Fletcher, Cunha, Maloy, Os
man. Fletcher, Cunha, Meloy, Os
good and Blair also have represented

the University on its teams.
In dramatics, 1906 has done fine
work. As Juniors they produced the
"Princess Enone," the best musical
farce ever given since the "Princess
Leland," many years ago. Their pro
duction of "The Original Miss Tewks
herry" last night was undeniably the
best farce that has been given here
within the memory even of the old
est holdover. Most conspicuous
among the actors of the class have
been Ernest R. May, D. D. Sales,
Paul C. Edwards, L. W. Cutler, R. H.
Lachmund, E. V. Henley and Miss
Alice Hayes.
The class of 1906 takes to itself
credit for having brought order out
of chaos in the financial affairs of
the classes and of many of the organ
izations. This is the result of the
introduction of the simple bookkeep
ing system inaugurated by the Sen
ior treasurer, Walter Y. Wentz. In
the past scandal has been not un
known in the finances of the classes:
hereafter there can be 110 excuse for
it.
A history of the class would be in
complete without mention of the 1906
Plug Ugly. There was more row
over this than over any other similar
affair in memory. The class of 1906
had a first-class snow and they
thought it was worth twenty-five
cents to their friends of other classes
and to the public generally to see it.
The class of 1905 came in very
quietly through the big gate—to save
the entry fee. They sat down in
front of us and told us we were
doomed: we would never reach the
quad alive. We finished our show,
and we reached the quad. We made
the prescribed journey around under
the arches. And then we established
a new Stanford record. We made
the round of the quadrangle again, so
that we completed a double circuit.
That feat had never been done before,
nor has it since. Our record stands.
The class of 1906 —the "Kalamity
Klass"—has been essentially a class
of trouble. We have never sought
that particular kind of amusement,
but it has come upon us none the
less. We have always endeavored,
after trouble got started, to meet it
well half way, so that its momentum
might not become so great as f n
overwhelm us. We have greeted it
in the usual Stanford manner, and it
has retreated.

farce ever given since the "Princess
Leland," many years ago. Their pro
duction of "The Original Miss Tewks
herry" last night was undeniably the
best farce that has been given here
within the memory even of the old
est holdover. Most conspicuous
among the actors of the class have
been Ernest R. May, D. D. Sales,
Paul C. Edwards, L. W. Cutler, R. H.
Lachmund, E. V. Henley and Miss
Alice Hayes.
The class of 1906 takes to itself
credit for having brought order out
of chaos in the financial affairs of
the classes and of many of the organ
izations. This is the result of the
introduction of the simple bookkeep
ing system inaugurated by the Sen
ior treasurer, Walter Y. Wentz. In
the past scandal has been not un
known in the finances of the classes:
hereafter there can be 110 excuse for
it.
A history of the class would be in
complete without mention of the 1906
Plug Ugly. There was more row
over this than over any other similar
affair in memory. The class of 1906
had a first-class snow and they
thought it was worth twenty-five
cents to their friends of other classes
and to the public generally to see it.
The class of 1905 came in very
quietly through the big gate—to save
the entry fee. They sat down in
front of us and told us we were
doomed: we would never reach the
quad alive. We finished our show,
and we reached the quad. We made
the prescribed journey around under
the arches. And then we established
a new Stanford record. We made
the round of the quadrangle again, so
that we completed a double circuit.
That feat had never been done before,
nor has it since. Our record stands.
The class of 1906 —the "Kalamity
Klass"—has been essentially a class
of trouble. We have never sought
that particular kind of amusement,
but it has come upon us none the
less. We have always endeavored,
after trouble got started, to meet it
well half way, so that its momentum
might not become so great as f n
overwhelm us. We have greeted it
in the usual Stanford manner, and it
has retreated.

The Class History, read by VV. H.
B. Fowler, the 1906 historian, contained
a comprehensive survey of the event
ful life of the class. It follows in full:
The other day I heard two letters
applied to the class of 1906 —the let
ters "K. K." Naturally curious, I
inquired their special significance, and
was told that they stood for "Kalam
ity Klass."
A survey of the college career of
the class of iqo6 will convince any
one that the term "K. K." is rather
appropriate. The four years that the
men and women about to depart
spent at this University were certain-

ly strenuous. Things seemed to hap
pen just as soon as we got here. In
deed it must have been a humdrum
college before the fateful day in 1902
when we regisered. And things con
tinued to happen until we left. I feel
safe in claiming that our final wind
up was the most strenuous in the his
tory of any university of modern
times. We take no special credit
upon ourselves for this, but none the
less, now that it is all over, we can
speak of it as a fitting conclusion to
our career.
In our Freshman year we went
through the terrible typhoid epi
demic that claimed the lives of many
of our fellow students. Daily men
and women whom we met constantly
in our work and knew well were
taken away to a hospital or to their
homes, some to recover after weeks
of suffering, but too many to pass
beyond. The courage of Stanford
men and women was surely tried in
those days, and from the tragedy
Stanford emerged strong.
We were to lie tried again in our
Sophomore year. As, a twelve-month
before, we had been almost over
whelmed by the dread typhoid, now
we had to face the Hardly less ter
rible diphtheria. This disease too
claimed its victims from our midst,
taking friends and associates. With
the epidemic of the previous year
fresh in their minds, many took a
very gloomy view of the situation.
As Juniors we had to face the sad
dest event in the University's history,
already so full of tragedy. This was
the passing of the joint founder of
the University, Jane Eathrop Stan
ford, under the most distressing cir
cumstances. None of us will forget
the sense of shock when the sorrow
ful tidings reached the campus at 8
o'clock on that eventful morning.
We heard, but we were reluctant to
believe until we could no longer
evade the truth. And then we had
the long and sorrowful wait until we
were able to pay our last tribute to
the memory of the noble woman.
The fourth year of the class of
1906 came, and we waited to see what

should make this year memorable.
The unjust and arbitrary dismissal of
the editor of the"Daily Palo Alto"
stirred the University from top to
bottom, and the class of 1906 cer
tainly seemed to have lived up to
their trouble record. But neither
they nor the college were to escape
so easily, for there came along the
earthquake, which shook the Univer
sity from bottom to top. The earth
quake shook the class of 1906 out of
college, and thereat we are sorry, be
cause there is much work to be done
here, under conditions that are not al
together pleasant, and we would like
to be with you of the other classes
in the reconstruction test that you
must go through. But, departing,
we have no fears, for we know that
every Stanford man and woman of
the present and every Stanford man
and woman that is to be will live
up to the Stanford standard and rise
above every difficulty.
The class of 1906 has not been a
particularly strong class athletically,
but it has contributed a fair share to
the athletic successes of the Univer
sity. P906 lost their Freshman foot
ball match with California; lost it fair
and square. And yet the Freshmen
furnished to the Varsity that year
Magce, a great punter, and Sprott,
one of the finest tackles who ever
came to this college, and who sub
sequently was chosen football cap
tain. Other varsity men of the class
were George W. Smith, W. R. Scho
field, J. N. Stanford, W. E. Lyons
and P. T. Frizzell.
The earthquake unjustly deprived
Captain Sales, 1906, of the privilege
of breaking the baseball hoodoo that
has hung over the University for
! several years, for the playing of the
third game last spring was hardly
more than a formality. There was
no danger there in counting the
chickens ahead of time. 1906 men
who have made the Varsity in base
ball, besides Captain Sales, are W.
Wirt, R. A. Williams, J. H. Colbert
and E. G. Dudley.
On the track the 1906 members of
the intercollegiate teams have been
I 11. F. Lovell, F. R. Estes, A. I. Stiles,
M. J. Weller and R. F. West (later
members of 1907), 1. J. Bounds, L. G.
j Russell and A. C. Freeman.
What the class of 1906 has lacked
| in track material it has endeavored
I to atone for by inaugurating an inter
j scholastic meet to be held on the
' Stanford campus every year, so that
I a large number of athletes will be
j given a fine chance to see the beau
ties of the co-education system and
j what a fine place this is to live in.
In tennis the 1906 man most con
spicuous has been George 1 lodge,
acknowledged one of the best play
ers the collcgc has had in years.
A certain amount of credit for the
progress of boating at Stanford must
be given to R. 11. Gaither, 1906, cap
| tain and coach of the crew. Of the
lirst intercollegiate crew, three of the
live men in the boat were members
j of 1006 —Gaither, A B. Cheadle and
I B. Bryan.
In the athletics of the girls the
most prominent igc6 women have
been Miss Jane Spaulding, Miss Em-
I ma Hayward, Miss G. Pitman, Miss

Mary Betz and Miss Florence Grace.
In a literary way members of the
class of 1906 have done perhaps a lit
tle more than their share. Four men
who entered with the class have been
editors-in-chief of the"Daily Palo
Alto"—W. H. B. Fowler, L. R. Wein
man, Ben S. Allen and H. P. Bittner.
The policy of these editors has been
officially condemned as too progres
sive and plain-spoken for a college
paper. They have not sought, how
ever, to simulate official displeasure
rather to present plain and unvarnish
ed facts to the students who elected
them to their position. And the edi
tors believe that they have given emi
nent satisfaction to the great major
ity of the student body and of the
faculty.
Other members of the class of 1906
who have been prominent in the
"Daily Palo Alto" work are Clyde
M. Hadley, C. G. Atwood, Miss Hazel
Pedlar and A. N. Lewis, Jr.
Two members of 1906 have been
editors of the literary monthly, the
"Sequoia." These editors were Miss
Edith Mirrielees and Paul Edwards.
The columns of the "Sequoia" have
been freely contributed to by mem
bers of the class, and notable among
these contributors has been Miss Stel
la Wynne, who has already won rec
ognition from the great magazines of
the nation.
Upon the "Chaparral" board have
been found Joel Nibley, Chet Lyman,
M. M. Stearns, G. G. Altnow, L. R.
Weinmann and I. C. Ackerman.
To Ernest R. May must be given the
credit for produring a "Quad" that has
no superior and only one equal—the
"Quad" of the class of 1904, edited
by Ike Russell. The associate mem
bers of the "Quad" board were Allen,
Gaboon, Dudley, Edwards, Fowler,
Nibley, Stearns, Edith Mirrielees and
Alice llayes.
And here, speaking for the class of
1906, I beg to tender tlie class of 1907
our most sincere repret at the utter
destruction of their "Quad," and to
pledge to them any aid that 1906
men or women can give in repairing
tlie great loss.
In debating many '06 men have
been prominent. Alexander Sheriffs,
formerly '05, winner of a Carnot
medal, and member of intercollegiate
man. Fletcher, Cunha, Maloy, Os
man. Fletcher, Cunha, Meloy, Os
good and Blair also have represented

the University on its teams.
In dramatics, 1906 has done fine
work. As Juniors they produced the
"Princess Enone," the best musical
farce ever given since the "Princess
Leland," many years ago. Their pro
duction of "The Original Miss Tewks
herry" last night was undeniably the
best farce that has been given here

paper. They have not sought, how
ever, to simulate official displeasure
rather to present plain and unvarnish
ed facts to the students who elected
them to their position. And the edi
tors believe that they have given emi
nent satisfaction to the great major
ity of the student body and of the
faculty.
Other members of the class of 1906
who have been prominent in the
"Daily Palo Alto" work are Clyde
M. Hadley, C. G. Atwood, Miss Hazel
Pedlar and A. N. Lewis, Jr.
Two members of 1906 have been
editors of the literary monthly, the
"Sequoia." These editors were Miss
Edith Mirrielees and Paul Edwards.
The columns of the "Sequoia" have
been freely contributed to by mem
bers of the class, and notable among
these contributors has been Miss Stel
la Wynne, who has already won rec
ognition from the great magazines of
the nation.
Upon the "Chaparral" board have
been found Joel Nibley, Chet Lyman,
M. M. Stearns, G. G. Altnow, L. R.
Weinmann and I. C. Ackerman.
To Ernest R. May must be given the
credit for produring a "Quad" that has
no superior and only one equal—the
"Quad" of the class of 1904, edited
by Ike Russell. The associate mem
bers of the "Quad" board were Allen,
Gaboon, Dudley, Edwards, Fowler,
Nibley, Stearns, Edith Mirrielees and
Alice llayes.
And here, speaking for the class of
1906, I beg to tender tlie class of 1907
our most sincere repret at the utter
destruction of their "Quad," and to
pledge to them any aid that 1906
men or women can give in repairing
tlie great loss.
In debating many '06 men have
been prominent. Alexander Sheriffs,
formerly '05, winner of a Carnot
medal, and member of intercollegiate
man. Fletcher, Cunha, Maloy, Os
man. Fletcher, Cunha, Meloy, Os
good and Blair also have represented

the University on its teams.
In dramatics, 1906 has done fine
work. As Juniors they produced the
"Princess Enone," the best musical
farce ever given since the "Princess
Leland," many years ago. Their pro
duction of "The Original Miss Tewks
herry" last night was undeniably the
best farce that has been given here
within the memory even of the old
est holdover. Most conspicuous
among the actors of the class have
been Ernest R. May, D. D. Sales,
Paul C. Edwards, L. W. Cutler, R. H.
Lachmund, E. V. Henley and Miss
Alice Hayes.
The class of 1906 takes to itself
credit for having brought order out
of chaos in the financial affairs of
the classes and of many of the organ
izations. This is the result of the
introduction of the simple bookkeep
ing system inaugurated by the Sen
ior treasurer, Walter Y. Wentz. In
the past scandal has been not un
known in the finances of the classes:
hereafter there can be 110 excuse for
it.
A history of the class would be in
complete without mention of the 1906
Plug Ugly. There was more row
over this than over any other similar
affair in memory. The class of 1906
had a first-class snow and they
thought it was worth twenty-five
cents to their friends of other classes
and to the public generally to see it.
The class of 1905 came in very
quietly through the big gate—to save
the entry fee. They sat down in
front of us and told us we were
doomed: we would never reach the
quad alive. We finished our show,
and we reached the quad. We made
the prescribed journey around under
the arches. And then we established
a new Stanford record. We made
the round of the quadrangle again, so
that we completed a double circuit.
That feat had never been done before,
nor has it since. Our record stands.
The class of 1906 —the "Kalamity
Klass"—has been essentially a class
of trouble. We have never sought
that particular kind of amusement,
but it has come upon us none the
less. We have always endeavored,
after trouble got started, to meet it
well half way, so that its momentum
might not become so great as f n
overwhelm us. We have greeted it
in the usual Stanford manner, and it
has retreated.

The Class History, read by VV. H.
B. Fowler, the 1906 historian, contained
a comprehensive survey of the event
ful life of the class. It follows in full:
The other day I heard two letters
applied to the class of 1906 —the let
ters "K. K." Naturally curious, I
inquired their special significance, and
was told that they stood for "Kalam
ity Klass."
A survey of the college career of
the class of iqo6 will convince any
one that the term "K. K." is rather
appropriate. The four years that the
men and women about to depart
spent at this University were certain-

ly strenuous. Things seemed to hap
pen just as soon as we got here. In
deed it must have been a humdrum
college before the fateful day in 1902
when we regisered. And things con
tinued to happen until we left. I feel
safe in claiming that our final wind
up was the most strenuous in the his
tory of any university of modern
times. We take no special credit
upon ourselves for this, but none the
less, now that it is all over, we can
speak of it as a fitting conclusion to
our career.
In our Freshman year we went
through the terrible typhoid epi
demic that claimed the lives of many
of our fellow students. Daily men
and women whom we met constantly
in our work and knew well were
taken away to a hospital or to their
homes, some to recover after weeks
of suffering, but too many to pass
beyond. The courage of Stanford
men and women was surely tried in
those days, and from the tragedy
Stanford emerged strong.
We were to lie tried again in our
Sophomore year. As, a twelve-month
before, we had been almost over
whelmed by the dread typhoid, now
we had to face the Hardly less ter
rible diphtheria. This disease too
claimed its victims from our midst,
taking friends and associates. With
the epidemic of the previous year
fresh in their minds, many took a
very gloomy view of the situation.
As Juniors we had to face the sad
dest event in the University's history,
already so full of tragedy. This was
the passing of the joint founder of
the University, Jane Eathrop Stan
ford, under the most distressing cir
cumstances. None of us will forget
the sense of shock when the sorrow
ful tidings reached the campus at 8
o'clock on that eventful morning.
We heard, but we were reluctant to
believe until we could no longer
evade the truth. And then we had
the long and sorrowful wait until we
were able to pay our last tribute to
the memory of the noble woman.
The fourth year of the class of
1906 came, and we waited to see what

should make this year memorable.
The unjust and arbitrary dismissal of
the editor of the"Daily Palo Alto"
stirred the University from top to
bottom, and the class of 1906 cer
tainly seemed to have lived up to
their trouble record. But neither
they nor the college were to escape
so easily, for there came along the
earthquake, which shook the Univer
sity from bottom to top. The earth
quake shook the class of 1906 out of
college, and thereat we are sorry, be
cause there is much work to be done
here, under conditions that are not al
together pleasant, and we would like
to be with you of the other classes
in the reconstruction test that you
must go through. But, departing,
we have no fears, for we know that
every Stanford man and woman of
the present and every Stanford man
and woman that is to be will live
up to the Stanford standard and rise
above every difficulty.
The class of 1906 has not been a
particularly strong class athletically,
but it has contributed a fair share to
the athletic successes of the Univer
sity. P906 lost their Freshman foot
ball match with California; lost it fair
and square. And yet the Freshmen
furnished to the Varsity that year
Magce, a great punter, and Sprott,
one of the finest tackles who ever
came to this college, and who sub
sequently was chosen football cap
tain. Other varsity men of the class
were George W. Smith, W. R. Scho
field, J. N. Stanford, W. E. Lyons
and P. T. Frizzell.
The earthquake unjustly deprived
Captain Sales, 1906, of the privilege
of breaking the baseball hoodoo that
has hung over the University for
! several years, for the playing of the
third game last spring was hardly
more than a formality. There was
no danger there in counting the
chickens ahead of time. 1906 men
who have made the Varsity in base
ball, besides Captain Sales, are W.
Wirt, R. A. Williams, J. H. Colbert
and E. G. Dudley.
On the track the 1906 members of
the intercollegiate teams have been
I 11. F. Lovell, F. R. Estes, A. I. Stiles,
M. J. Weller and R. F. West (later
members of 1907), 1. J. Bounds, L. G.
j Russell and A. C. Freeman.
What the class of 1906 has lacked
| in track material it has endeavored
I to atone for by inaugurating an inter
j scholastic meet to be held on the
' Stanford campus every year, so that
I a large number of athletes will be
j given a fine chance to see the beau
ties of the co-education system and
j what a fine place this is to live in.
In tennis the 1906 man most con
spicuous has been George 1 lodge,
acknowledged one of the best play
ers the collcgc has had in years.
A certain amount of credit for the
progress of boating at Stanford must
be given to R. 11. Gaither, 1906, cap
| tain and coach of the crew. Of the
lirst intercollegiate crew, three of the
live men in the boat were members
j of 1006 —Gaither, A B. Cheadle and
I B. Bryan.
In the athletics of the girls the
most prominent igc6 women have
been Miss Jane Spaulding, Miss Em-
I ma Hayward, Miss G. Pitman, Miss

Mary Betz and Miss Florence Grace.
In a literary way members of the
class of 1906 have done perhaps a lit
tle more than their share. Four men
who entered with the class have been
editors-in-chief of the"Daily Palo
Alto"—W. H. B. Fowler, L. R. Wein
man, Ben S. Allen and H. P. Bittner.
The policy of these editors has been
officially condemned as too progres
sive and plain-spoken for a college
paper. They have not sought, how
ever, to simulate official displeasure
rather to present plain and unvarnish
ed facts to the students who elected
them to their position. And the edi
tors believe that they have given emi
nent satisfaction to the great major
ity of the student body and of the
faculty.
