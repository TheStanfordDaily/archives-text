By presenting "The Original Miss
Tewksberry," written by Miss S. F.
Wynne, '06, and managed by P. C. Ed
wards, '06, which was given in As
sembly Hall last Friday night, the class
of 1906 opened its formal commence
ment with the finest written and most

systematically acted Senior farce that
lias been seen on the campus of Stan
ford University in years.
The rise of the curtain disclosed Pet
er Tewksberry taking his daughter to
task. After permission has been grant
ed her to hold her salon the stage is
left to the entrance of Latimer, which
part was acted by D. 1), Sales, '06, and
Scott, who was played by F. H. Ber-

nard, '07. The plainness of the father
with regard to art was well portrayed
by J. E. Stewart, '07. Fritz, the ser
vant, an old man who bad outlived his
usefulness, was effectively played by 11.
W. Reed, '06. The queer actions of
Scott, who is personating the poet, M.
Anatolc du Roissc. provoked signs of
great amusement from the audience.
Hits were made by E. R. May, '06, as
du Boisse, and Miss E. L. Officer, '07,
in the part of Mrs. Harman.
Music was furnished by the Univer
sity orchestra, which was at its best.
