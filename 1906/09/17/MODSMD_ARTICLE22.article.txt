The Right Rev. William F. Nicholls,
bishop of California, delivered the Bac
calaureate Sermon, Sunday, Septem

graduating class of 1906.
In introducing his subject, "The
Diploma of Principle," Bishop Nich

"The diploma in some respects is
a document as non-committal as its
name, which we all know means some
thing folded double. In point of fact
it is seldom folded at all, almost always
rolled, though couched in excellent
language, Latin perhaps concealing the
thought from the recipient, seldom
if ever displayed as a credential be
cause not needed, put away in some
drawer or chest that the ten years'
graduate has to take a little time to
remember, and valued perhaps more
for the distinguished autographs that
sign it than for the faultless script and
initials and sometimes marvels of pic
torial embellishment, with which the
signatures are in delightful, if not al
together symmetrical contrast of aban
don. And yet we work years for that
diploma and it is the pride of a life
time, because it is the symbol of our
"early advantages," and our greater
or less use and assimilation of them.

we do not carry our diplomas around
in our pockets. Xow if a diploma were
to say exactly the thing for which the
best ideals out in the world just now
are calling, and if our young men and
young women were to ask how in
themselves they could step into the re
sponsibilities of that big world with the
best outfit to respond to the ideals
and the call of the century, I venture
to think it would be soemthing like
