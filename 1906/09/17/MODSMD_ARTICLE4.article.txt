In bidding official farewell to the
good class of 1905, I take my text, such
as it is. from a French novel, a cynical
story of an unpleasant person. Samuel
Brohl, by Victor Clierhuliez: ".My son,
we should lay up a stock of absurd en
thusiasms in our youth or else we shall
reach the end of our journey with an
empty heart, for we lose a good many
of them by the way."
And 1 my message in its fashion shall
be an appeal to enthusiasm in things
of life, a call to do things because we
love them, to love things because we
do them, to keep the eyes open, the
heart warm and the pulses swift. ;is we
move across the field of life; "To take
the old world by the hand and frolic
with it." This is Stevenson's recipe
for joyottsness. Old as the world is,
let it be always new to us as we are
new to it. Let it be every morning
nnde afresh by Him who "instantly
and constantly rcneweth the work of
:rea ion." Let "the bit of gree.t . d

under your feet ! ■: the suvetest to yo.i
in he world, u; any world." Half
the joy of life is in little things taken
on the run. 1 ■: us run if we inns —
ovt the sa" ! that—but let us
•t:r hearts vo.mg and our eyes opjii
tf'.it nothing wnith our while shall
escape us. And everything is wor.h
our while, i* a.' only grasp it and iit:
significance As we grow older it \)i
mes harder 10 c'o this, A grown '.tan
recs nothing he not ready to see n
his youth. So long as enthusiasm lasts,
so long is youth still with us.
To make all this more direct we may
look to the various sources from which
enthusiasm may he derived. What does
the school give us in this direction?
Intellectual drill, broadening of mental
horizon, professional training, all this
we expect from school, college and uni
versity and in every phase of this,
there is room for a thousand enthusi
asms. Moreover the college gives us
comradeship, the outlook on the hopes
and aspirations of our fellows. It
opens to us the resources of young life,
the luminous visions of the hoys that
arc to be men. We. come to know "the
wonderful fellow to dream and plan,
with the great things always to come,
