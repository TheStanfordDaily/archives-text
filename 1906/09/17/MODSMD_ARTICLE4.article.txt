# ADDRESS BY DAVID STARR JORDAN
## President of University Speaks to Graduates on Subject of "Life's Enthusiasms." 
### 
President David Starr Jordan de
livered the usual farewell address to
the graduates. The President spoke
eloquently of "Life's Enthusiasms" and
urged that all should grow old "as
grand old men," with interest and en
thusiasm. The address follows:
In bidding official farewell to the
good class of 1905, I take my text, such
as it is. from a French novel, a cynical
story of an unpleasant person. Samuel
Brohl, by Victor Clierhuliez: ".My son,
we should lay up a stock of absurd en
thusiasms in our youth or else we shall
reach the end of our journey with an
empty heart, for we lose a good many
of them by the way."
And 1 my message in its fashion shall
be an appeal to enthusiasm in things
of life, a call to do things because we
love them, to love things because we
do them, to keep the eyes open, the
heart warm and the pulses swift. ;is we
move across the field of life; "To take
the old world by the hand and frolic
with it." This is Stevenson's recipe
for joyottsness. Old as the world is,
let it be always new to us as we are
new to it. Let it be every morning
nnde afresh by Him who "instantly
and constantly rcneweth the work of
:rea ion." Let "the bit of gree.t . d

under your feet ! ■: the suvetest to yo.i
in he world, u; any world." Half
the joy of life is in little things taken
on the run. 1 ■: us run if we inns —
ovt the sa" ! that—but let us
•t:r hearts vo.mg and our eyes opjii
tf'.it nothing wnith our while shall
escape us. And everything is wor.h
our while, i* a.' only grasp it and iit:
significance As we grow older it \)i
mes harder 10 c'o this, A grown '.tan
recs nothing he not ready to see n
his youth. So long as enthusiasm lasts,
so long is youth still with us.
To make all this more direct we may
look to the various sources from which
enthusiasm may he derived. What does
the school give us in this direction?
Intellectual drill, broadening of mental
horizon, professional training, all this
we expect from school, college and uni
versity and in every phase of this,
there is room for a thousand enthusi
asms. Moreover the college gives us
comradeship, the outlook on the hopes
and aspirations of our fellows. It
opens to us the resources of young life,
the luminous visions of the hoys that
arc to be men. We. come to know "the
wonderful fellow to dream and plan,
with the great things always to come,
Religion. In terms of Life, Thoburn's
students will interpret all their own
various problems, for in terms of life
all things we do must finally be formu
lated. Every observation we make,
every thought of our minds, eevry act
of our hands, has in some degree an
ethical basis. It involves something of
light or wrong, and without adhesion
to right, all thought, all action must
end in folly. And there is no road to
righteousness so sure as that which has
right living as a travelling companion.
The very humanity of men at large
is in itself a source of inspiration.
Study men 011 the trains, at the ferry,
on the road, in the jungles of the for
est or in the jungles of great cities,
"through the ages, every human heart
is human." Look for the best, and the
best shall rise up always to reward
>ou. One who has traveled among
simple-living people, men and women
we call savages, because they live in
the woods and not in cleared land or
cities, will bear witness that a savage
may be a perfect gentleman. Every
race has its noblemen and through
these humanity is ennobled. It is worth
while to go far from Boston, to find
that such things are true.
And we may look not alone among
primitive folk who have never envied
us our civilization or ever cared that
we possessed it. Badalia Ilerodsfoot,
in Kipling's story, lived and died in
darkest London. Gentle hearts and
pure souls exist anions our own un
-I*' ruinates. tho> e whom our society lia.i
shown only its seamy s-ide. All misery
and failure as well as all virtue has its
degree, and our social scheme is still
far from the demands of perfect jus
tice.
Some one has said that "the wise
young man will wear out three dress
suits in a year." This is a playful way
of saying that lie will not shun men
and women, even those bound by the
conventions of society. All such as
sociation can be made to pay—not in
money—but in getting the point of view
of other people. This is worth while if
not costing too much of time and
strength. There is another maxim
which can offset the first. It is from
Lorimer's Chicago pork packer: "You
will meet fools enough during the day
without trying to round up the main
herd of them at night." But even the
main herd of fools may teach its les
son to the student of human nature.
It gives at least a point of departure in
the study of wisdom. To study men
or to kill time. What is your motive?
The poorest use of time is to kill it.
This is the weakest and most cowardly
form of suicide. Moreover it is never
quite successful. That "time which
crawleth like a monstrous snake,
wounded and slow and very venomous"
is sure to take its own revenges.
It is therefore good to look 011 the
cheerful side of life. A touch of hum
or is necessary to the salvation of the
serious man. It is a gift of the men
of America to see droll things and to
express them in droll fashion. To see
the funny side of one's own accomplish
ments is the highest achievement of the
American philosopher and there is hope
for the land in which the greatest wits
have been the most earnest of moral
teachers. Who was more earnest than

Oliver Wendall Holmes, who more gen
uine than Mark Twain? Without the
saving grace of humor our Puritan
conscience, which we all possess, would
lead us again into all extravagance,
witch-burning, Quaker-stoning, heresy
trials and intolerance of politics and re
ligion. From all these we are saved by
our sense of teh incongruous. But a
touch of humor recalls us to our senses.
It "makes the whole world kin."
In the love of nature is another
source of saving grace. Science is pow
er. In the stores of human experience
lies the key to action, and modern civi
lization is built on science. The love
I of nature is akin to science but dif
ferent. Contact with outdoor thing-, is
clircct experience. I'. is not stored, no*
co-ordinated, not always convertible
into power, but real nevertheless and
our own.
Ten thousand pictures which could
be called up equally at random and
from eevry foot of land on the globe—
all these arc objects of nature. All
these represent a point of human con
tact and the reaction which makes for
youth, for virtue and for enthusiasm.
To travel is merely to increase the
variety of contact by giving our time to
it, and by extending the number of
points at which contact is possible. It
may be that "he who wanders widest,
lifts no more of beauty's jealous veils
than he who from his doorway sees the
miracle of flowers and trees." It is
true, however, that the experiences of
the traveller covers a wider range and
fill his mind with a larger and more
varied store of remembered delights.
That poetry was a means of grace
was known to the lirst man who wrote
verse or who sang a ballad, away
back in the darkness before men in
vented words or devised letters. The
only poetry you will ever know is that
you learned by heart when you were
young. Happy is he who has learned
much and much of that which is good,
liad poetry is not poetry at all except
t< the man who makes it. For its crea
tor, even the feeblest verse speaks
something of inspiration and of aspira
tion. It is said that Frederick the
Great went into battle with a vial of
poison in one pocket and a quire of bad
verse in the other. Whatever we think
of the one, we feel more kindly toward
him for the other.
Charles Eliot Norton advises every
man to read a ''bit of poery every day,
for spiritual refreshment." It would
be well for each of lis if we should
follow this advise. It is not too late
yet and if some few of you would heed
his words and mine, I shall not have
spoken quite in vain.
In the arts of music and painting and
sculpture, one may find not only pro
fessional satisfaction, but the strength
that comes from higher living and more
lofty feeling. In the study of history
as biography, the acquaintance with the
men and women of other times, those
who have felt and thought and acted
and suffered to make a freer world for
you and me, like inspiration may be
found. History is more than its inci
dents. It is the movement of man. It
is the movement of individual men,
and it is in giving illumination to per
sonal and racial characters that the suc
cession of incidents has its value.
With all this comes that feeling of
dedication to the highest purposes
who knows?" His dream may be out
inspiration as it passes, as its realiza
tion may be the inspiration of future
generations. In the collcge is life in
the making, and with the rest we are
making our own lifes with the richest
material ever at our hand. Life is
contagious and in the fact lies the
meaning of Comradeship. "Gemein
gcist unter frcien Geistern," comradery
of free spirits: this is the definition of
College Spirit given us by Hutten at
Greiseswald, four centuries ago. This
definition serves for us to-day. life is
the same in every age. All days arc
one for all good things. They arc all
holy days, to the Freshman of to-day,
all joys of comradery, all delights of
free enthusiasm arc just as open, just
as fresh as ever they were. From the
tcachcr like influences should proceed.
Plodding and prodding is not the tcach
cr's work. It is inspiration, on-leading,
the flashing of enthusiasms. A teach
er in any field should be one who has
chosen his work because he loves it,
who makes no repine because he takes
with it the vow of poverty, who find!'
in the joy of making known. Our
his reward in the joy of knowing and
tcachcr is the man who has succeeded
along the line in which we hope to suc
ceed, whose success is measured as we
hope to measure our own. Each leader
of scicnce and of intellectual life is on
some degree the disciple of one who

has planned and led before him. There
is a heredity of intellect, a heredity of
action, as subtle and as real as the
heredity of the continuous germ-plasm.
And there are masters in the art
of living as well as in other arts and
sciences. "A log with Mark Hopkins
at one end and myself at the other."
—that was Garfield's conception of a
university. Tiie older students of
Stanford will always show the traces
of the master teacher Thoburn. "In
terms of life," thus he construed all
problems of Science of Philosophy, of
which is the essential factors of relig
ion. Religion should be known by its
tolerence, its broad mindedness, its
faith in God and humanity, its recog
nition of the duty of action.
And action should be understood in
a large way, the taking of one's part
in affairs worth doing, not mere activ
ity, nor fussiness, nor movement for
movement's sake, like that of "ants
on whom pepper is sprinkled." As the
lesser enthusiasms fade and fail, one
should take a stronger hold on the
higher ones. "Grizzling hair the brain
doth clear," and one sees better per
spectives, the things that need doing.
It is thus possible to grow old as a
"grand old man," a phrase invented
for Gladstone but which fits just as
well our own Mark Twain. Grand old
men are those who have been grand
young men, and carry still a young
heart beneath old shoulders. There
are plenty of such in our country to
day, though the average man begins to
give up the struggle for the higher life
at forty .
We hear much in these days of the
wickedness of power, of the evil behav
ior of men in high places, of men in
low places, and men whom the people
have been perforce obliged to trust.
This is 110 new thing, though the strug
gle against it, the combination of the
forces of reform and blackmail, of
dreamers and highwaymen is offering
some new phases.
There is a kind of music popular
with uncritical audiences and with peo
ple who know 1 >etter, which answers to
the name of ragtime. It is the music of
those who do not know good music or
who have not the moral force to de
mand it. The spirit of ragtime is not
confined to music. Graft is the rag
time of business, the spoils system the
ragtime of politics, adulteration the
ragtime of manufacture. There is rag
time science, ragtime literature, rag
time religion. You will know each of
these by its quick returns. The spirit—
sellers, the most popular policeman, the
favorite congressman, the wealthiest
corporation, the church which soonest
rents its pews.
Hut it does not control the man who
thinks for himself. It has no lien on
the movements of history, its decrees
aavil nothing in the fixing of truth.
Tne movements of the stars lav it no
tribute, neither do the movements of
humau'ty. The power of graft is a
t;an ient deception Em; sou's p.irable
vf 'he illusions the clue to ou
Inn", to all time in its contrast of the
things which appear with the things that
abide.
This 1 was prepared to say to you
011 the twenty-third day of last May.
But many things have happened since
then and many words have been left
unsaid. The time for action has has
come and swept it all away. These last
paragraphs I wrote on a spring morn
ing within a huge hotel of steel and
stone in the heart of a bustling city, in
the most gracious of lands and under
the bluest of skies.
The most cosmopolitan of all Ameri
can towns, the one fullest of the joy of
living, the one least fearful of future
disaster, "serene, indifferent to fate,"
thus her own poets have styled her,
and 011 110 other city since the world
1 cgan lias fae, unmalicious, mechanical
and elemental, wrought such a terrible
havoc. In a day this city has vanished;
the shock of a mighty earthquake for
gotten in an hour in the hopeless hor
ror of tire; homes, hotels, hospitals,
hovels, libraries, museums, skyscrapers,
factories, shops, banks and gambling

dens, all blotted out of existence al
most in the twinkling of an eye; mil
lionaires, beggars, dancers and work
ers, men great and small foolsli and
courageous, with their women and
children of like natures with them,
lleeing together by the thousands and
hundreds of thousands to the hills and
the sand dunes and 011 the grass and
the shifting sands they all slept togeth
er or were awake together in the old
primal equality of life. Never since
men began to plan and to create has
there been such a destruction of the
results of human effort . Never has a
great calamity been met with so little
repining. Never before has the com
mon man shown himself so hopeful,
so courageous, so sure of himself and
his future. For it is the man, after all,
that survives and it is the will of man
that shapes the fates.
It is the lesson of earthquake and
lire that man cannot be shaken and can
not be burned. The houses lie builds
are houses of cards, but he stands out
side of them and can build again. It is
a wonderful thing to build a great city.
Men can do this in a quarter century,
working together each at his own part.
More wonderful still is it to be a city,
for a city is composed of men, and
now, ever, and forever the men must
rise above his own creations. That
which is in the man is greater than all
that he can do.
The lesson of San Francisco has been

our lesson ;it Stanford. The wrecking
of buildings does nut wreck a I ni
versity. The University exists in the
minds, the wills, the souls of men. We
must make good our damages, we inn-,
•i- our faces. It all comes in the
day's work, the day in which we, each
of us. shall do our part. The Univer
sity of the future, the Stanford of the
twentieth century, still lies before us.
