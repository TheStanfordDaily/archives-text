# WHEELER ON SPELLING
## PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA GIVES VIEWS IN ADDRESS. English Language Is Property of People and Should Not Be Arbitrarily Changed.

Benjamin I do Wheeler, President of
the I niversity of California, delivered
the commencement address in Assem
bly 11 all. W heeler spoke upon the
movement toward spelling reforms and
severely criticized the action of Presi

The chief instrument of that inter
communication amongst men upon
which is conditioned human sympa

ciety is language. The significance or
this occasion prompts me therefore
to some remarks on unity of standard
