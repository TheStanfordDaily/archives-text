# WHEELER ON SPELLING
## PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA GIVES VIEWS IN ADDRESS. English Language Is Property of People and Should Not Be Arbitrarily Changed. 
### 
Benjamin I do Wheeler, President of
the I niversity of California, delivered
the commencement address in Assem
bly 11 all. W heeler spoke upon the
movement toward spelling reforms and
severely criticized the action of Presi
dent Roosevelt in attempting to hasten
matters in that direction. He said in
part:
\\ e are assembled to-day in the
name ol the University not built with
hands. The same disorder of Na
ture which last April made men dis
trust the solid earth on which they
dwelt, revealed to them the sure re
source of human helpfulness; and the
same distress which showed how
small their actual need in things of
sense, pointed straight toward the
tilings that are real and the things
that abide. The same disorder that
doubly decimated the monied support
ot Berkeley and disheveled the glo
ries of Sanford's poecile walls un
shed to clearer view the greater
University of Man we always knew
was always there, the university of
common purpose in common love of
truth and cleanness, —not anchored
r o the soil of any place, not named
with names, not built with hands
1 am sure there never was a time
when, by the touch of world-wide
. ynpathy, Stanford felt more cc.*-
tf!inly conscious of its part in t;:is
greater university; I am sure ihire
never was a day when the hand-clasp
of Stanford and Berkeley carried the
heart-beat, as this day which by its
ve r y circumstances remind of com
mon loss and common task, and
blends oneness of fate with oneness
of spirit. A memorial will we rear
to-day "out of our strong griefs" and
it shall he a witness between us, and
Mizpah, the watch-tower, shall be
its name: the Lord watch between
me and tlicc when we are absent o
from another.
The chief instrument of that inter
communication amongst men upon
which is conditioned human sympa
thy and mutual understanding as the
ha: is ot the larger life in human so
ciety is language. The significance or
this occasion prompts me therefore
to some remarks on unity of standard
in intercourse by language, and 1 an:
further encouraged thereto by the
consideration that philology having
of late "got into politics" a little, is
suffering the usual maltreatment in
current discussions. It is not with
a view to taking sides in a practical
controversy, but in order to present
some fundamenal principles of the
science of language pertinent thereto
and commonly ignored, that I make
tliis my venture, trusting to your
kind allowance, that philology, now
that various walks of life have had
hearing in the matter may not seem
to trespass in claiming for its adum
brations the right to throw some fur
ther shadows upon the question.
The definition of language as
voice expressive of thought is doubly
inadequate. In the first place, it is
far less a means of expression than a
vehicle of communication. Histori
cally it takes its form almost entire
ly, not from the prompting to express
what is within one, but from the sug
gestions of hearing as to what will
be intelligible to others. It is a
means of communication; it always
takes into account the other man; it
is pre-eminently a social instrument.
In the second place, it is, in modern
civilized society, addressed more to
the eye than to the ear. Most of us
read every day more language than
we hear, even if we limit our read
ing to newspapers and text-books,
but if we turn to the higher intellec
tual life, there can be no doubt that
our acquaintance with the larger range
of powers and possibilities in lan
guage is determined measurably more
by reading than by hearing. Broad
ened intercourse in the world of men
is calling more and more for an in
tercommunication of thought not re
stricted to the range of a speaker's
voice. We resent the power of dis
tance to keep men and ideas -ind
sympathies asunder, and we refuse to
condition intercommunication upon a
certain physical propinquity of
larynxes and ears. The phonograph
and the telephone are ultro-modern
devices for annulling distance and
bringing larynx and ear nearer to
gether. As such these instruments
aid in returning language to its orig
inal character as sound addressed to
the car. Still if we were from this
time on to abandon altogether
the pen and the printing press, and
make our libraries into storehouses
of phonograph cylinders, we should
at least cut ourselves off from the
past, for written language is an in
srument not only of triumph over
space, but even more significantly, as
a means of record, an instrument of
triumph over time. One may fairly
presume, I think, that the device of
written language, by which man
has been slowly lifting himself dur
ing the last four millenia out of
the shackles of space and time, i.e
out of savagery, is not likely to be
abandoned forthwith. The problem
however, of how to hold the
written language in intelligible re
lation to the viscous body of the
the essential value of the former as
an agency of civilization will com
mand increasing attention, and
will demand the co-operaion of
special knowledge, boad human
wisdom, and withal much caution, for
the problem is beset with grave dif
ficulties. and as most specially con
cerns the English language of all
languages there arc or ever have
been.
As every language serves the
purpose of communication among the
members of its speech-community it

follows that every language is a
standardized product. This is true of
spoken language as well as of written
language, though in a more refined
degree and less obtrusively.
The modern state is national by
virtue, not of unity of blood or faith,
but pre-eminently by virtue of unity
ii, the medium intercourse, primar
ily by writing, secondarily by speech.
Germany has one recognized stand
ard language overlying various
shrinking dialects of speech; likewise
France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Nor
way is held aloof from Sweden by a
distinct standard of Scandinavian
speech, and is turned toward Den
mark. Austria-Hungary fails of na
tionality from lack of a common
idiom.
I come now to speak of the English
language. This has made more than
a nation, and more than an empire.
The one instance in history of a sin
gle language serving two great em
pires, it has dedicated a broad region
belting the globe to free intercourse
and equality before tfie law.
(Here follow certain points of
view on the proposed change in spell
ing-)
First: Uniformity in the written
language throughout its entire terri
tory in any given period, as the pres
ent, is ;t prime demand of civilized
intercourse.
Second: The establishment for the
United States of a standard of written
English different from that recog
nized elsewhere in the English
speaking territory is an isolating and
divisive movement promising loss and
waste to intercourse and culture, and
introducing consciousness of con
trariety where the opposite is desired.
The needless irritation caused by the
minor differences already existing
points ominously to what would re
sult from greater.
Third—The English language is not
the property of the people of the
United States, still less of its gov
ernment ; it is a precious possession
of the English-speaking world, and
:he maral authority to interfere in its
legulation must arise out of the en
tire body and not from a segment
thereof.
Fourth—Every person who is born
to the use of the language inherits
thereby a definite advantage in the
world of intellectual gain, for influ
ence and effectiveness, yes, even for
commercial success, by very reason
of its extension of use in uniformity
of standard. This inherited advan
tage constitutes vested interest, and
must not be trifled with.
Fifth —Any radical change, such as
for instance would be involved in pho
netic writing, would have the effect
of cutting us off from the language of
Shakespeare and the English Bible,
making this a semi-foreign idiom, to
be acquired by special study. In-*
deed our entire present library col
lections of English books would be
placed beyond the reach of the ordi
nary reader, and be as Dutch to his
eyes. The bond uniting all the pro
ducts of the language from the Eliza
bethan period to the present day cre
ates a very precious heritage for
every speaker of he English tongue.
Sixth—The adoption of a phonetic
writing, it should furthermore be re
membered. would involve imitation of
the various dialectal forms of the
spoken language, all of which is high
h interesting to phonologists, but 10
the plain reader anathema.

Seventh—Print is addressed to the
eye, and the reader's eye taking in
1 whole words or even the composite
form of whole phrases in rapid glance
I is disturbed and hindered by abnorm
al forms of spelling.
Eighth—The proposal gradually to
] introduce through ' the co-operation
, of volunteers a certain number of new
spellings and then, when these arc
I well under way, presumably certain
others, seems to promise an area of
[ ghastly confusion in printing offices
and in private orthography and hcte
rography, as well as much irritation
: to readers' eyes and spirits.
Ninth—The list of three hundred
words proposed by the Simplified
Spelling Board is a somewhat hap
j hazard collection following no very
clear principle of selection. One
I hundred and fifty-seven of them, such
as color for colour, are already in
their docked form familiar to Ameri
i can usage. The remainder seem to
| owe their inclusion in the list to their
! having been misspelled a number of
times in English literature.
The English tongue is our priceless
heritage whereby we as a people and
as individuals are made members of
the widest community of intelligence
j and freedom in the records of man
! kind and and sharers of the simplest
traditions of vigor, integrity and self
government, and it behooves us to
deal considerately with it, and keep it
in honor. This possession, further
j more, we hold in joint title with many
I peoples in many lands, and we may
not ask for the portion of goods that
is ours without injuring the rights
of others and likewise impairing our
own estate and the inheritance of our
children. In the jealous keepership of
i ur children an .dour children's chil
dren, the tongue in which our fathers'
spoke the freedom of the individual
man shall become the chief instru
ment of unity and peace among all
men.

\\ e are assembled to-day in the
name ol the University not built with

trust the solid earth on which they
dwelt, revealed to them the sure re
source of human helpfulness; and the
same distress which showed how
small their actual need in things of
sense, pointed straight toward the
tilings that are real and the things
that abide. The same disorder that
doubly decimated the monied support
ot Berkeley and disheveled the glo
ries of Sanford's poecile walls un
shed to clearer view the greater
University of Man we always knew
was always there, the university of
common purpose in common love of
truth and cleanness, —not anchored
r o the soil of any place, not named
with names, not built with hands
1 am sure there never was a time
when, by the touch of world-wide
. ynpathy, Stanford felt more cc.*-
tf!inly conscious of its part in t;:is
greater university; I am sure ihire
never was a day when the hand-clasp
of Stanford and Berkeley carried the
heart-beat, as this day which by its
ve r y circumstances remind of com
mon loss and common task, and
blends oneness of fate with oneness
of spirit. A memorial will we rear
to-day "out of our strong griefs" and
it shall he a witness between us, and
Mizpah, the watch-tower, shall be
its name: the Lord watch between
me and tlicc when we are absent o
from another.
The chief instrument of that inter
communication amongst men upon
which is conditioned human sympa
thy and mutual understanding as the
ha: is ot the larger life in human so
ciety is language. The significance or
this occasion prompts me therefore
to some remarks on unity of standard
in intercourse by language, and 1 an:
further encouraged thereto by the
consideration that philology having
of late "got into politics" a little, is
suffering the usual maltreatment in
current discussions. It is not with
a view to taking sides in a practical
controversy, but in order to present
some fundamenal principles of the
science of language pertinent thereto
and commonly ignored, that I make
tliis my venture, trusting to your
kind allowance, that philology, now
that various walks of life have had
hearing in the matter may not seem
to trespass in claiming for its adum
brations the right to throw some fur
ther shadows upon the question.
The definition of language as
voice expressive of thought is doubly
inadequate. In the first place, it is
far less a means of expression than a
vehicle of communication. Histori
cally it takes its form almost entire
ly, not from the prompting to express
what is within one, but from the sug
gestions of hearing as to what will
be intelligible to others. It is a
means of communication; it always
takes into account the other man; it
is pre-eminently a social instrument.
In the second place, it is, in modern
civilized society, addressed more to
the eye than to the ear. Most of us
read every day more language than
we hear, even if we limit our read
ing to newspapers and text-books,
but if we turn to the higher intellec
tual life, there can be no doubt that
our acquaintance with the larger range
of powers and possibilities in lan
guage is determined measurably more
by reading than by hearing. Broad
ened intercourse in the world of men
is calling more and more for an in
tercommunication of thought not re
stricted to the range of a speaker's
voice. We resent the power of dis
tance to keep men and ideas -ind
sympathies asunder, and we refuse to
condition intercommunication upon a
certain physical propinquity of
larynxes and ears. The phonograph
and the telephone are ultro-modern
devices for annulling distance and
bringing larynx and ear nearer to
gether. As such these instruments
aid in returning language to its orig
inal character as sound addressed to
the car. Still if we were from this
time on to abandon altogether
the pen and the printing press, and
make our libraries into storehouses
of phonograph cylinders, we should
at least cut ourselves off from the
past, for written language is an in
srument not only of triumph over
space, but even more significantly, as
a means of record, an instrument of
triumph over time. One may fairly
presume, I think, that the device of
written language, by which man
has been slowly lifting himself dur
ing the last four millenia out of
the shackles of space and time, i.e
out of savagery, is not likely to be
abandoned forthwith. The problem
however, of how to hold the
written language in intelligible re
lation to the viscous body of the
the essential value of the former as
an agency of civilization will com
mand increasing attention, and
will demand the co-operaion of
special knowledge, boad human
wisdom, and withal much caution, for
the problem is beset with grave dif
ficulties. and as most specially con
cerns the English language of all
languages there arc or ever have
been.
As every language serves the
purpose of communication among the
members of its speech-community it

follows that every language is a
standardized product. This is true of
spoken language as well as of written
language, though in a more refined
degree and less obtrusively.
The modern state is national by
virtue, not of unity of blood or faith,
but pre-eminently by virtue of unity
ii, the medium intercourse, primar
ily by writing, secondarily by speech.
Germany has one recognized stand
ard language overlying various
shrinking dialects of speech; likewise
France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Nor
way is held aloof from Sweden by a
distinct standard of Scandinavian
speech, and is turned toward Den
mark. Austria-Hungary fails of na
tionality from lack of a common
idiom.
I come now to speak of the English
language. This has made more than
a nation, and more than an empire.
The one instance in history of a sin
gle language serving two great em
pires, it has dedicated a broad region
belting the globe to free intercourse
and equality before tfie law.
(Here follow certain points of
view on the proposed change in spell
ing-)
First: Uniformity in the written
language throughout its entire terri
tory in any given period, as the pres
ent, is ;t prime demand of civilized
intercourse.
Second: The establishment for the
United States of a standard of written
English different from that recog
nized elsewhere in the English
speaking territory is an isolating and
divisive movement promising loss and
waste to intercourse and culture, and
introducing consciousness of con
trariety where the opposite is desired.
The needless irritation caused by the
minor differences already existing
points ominously to what would re
sult from greater.
Third—The English language is not
the property of the people of the
United States, still less of its gov
ernment ; it is a precious possession
of the English-speaking world, and
:he maral authority to interfere in its
legulation must arise out of the en
tire body and not from a segment
thereof.
Fourth—Every person who is born
to the use of the language inherits
thereby a definite advantage in the
world of intellectual gain, for influ
ence and effectiveness, yes, even for
commercial success, by very reason
of its extension of use in uniformity
of standard. This inherited advan
tage constitutes vested interest, and
must not be trifled with.
Fifth —Any radical change, such as
for instance would be involved in pho
netic writing, would have the effect
of cutting us off from the language of
Shakespeare and the English Bible,
making this a semi-foreign idiom, to
be acquired by special study. In-*
deed our entire present library col
lections of English books would be
placed beyond the reach of the ordi
nary reader, and be as Dutch to his
eyes. The bond uniting all the pro
ducts of the language from the Eliza
bethan period to the present day cre
ates a very precious heritage for
every speaker of he English tongue.
Sixth—The adoption of a phonetic
writing, it should furthermore be re
membered. would involve imitation of
the various dialectal forms of the
spoken language, all of which is high
h interesting to phonologists, but 10
the plain reader anathema.

Seventh—Print is addressed to the
eye, and the reader's eye taking in
1 whole words or even the composite
form of whole phrases in rapid glance
I is disturbed and hindered by abnorm
al forms of spelling.
Eighth—The proposal gradually to
] introduce through ' the co-operation
, of volunteers a certain number of new
spellings and then, when these arc
I well under way, presumably certain
others, seems to promise an area of
[ ghastly confusion in printing offices
and in private orthography and hcte
rography, as well as much irritation
: to readers' eyes and spirits.
Ninth—The list of three hundred
words proposed by the Simplified
Spelling Board is a somewhat hap
j hazard collection following no very
clear principle of selection. One
I hundred and fifty-seven of them, such
as color for colour, are already in
their docked form familiar to Ameri
i can usage. The remainder seem to
| owe their inclusion in the list to their
! having been misspelled a number of
times in English literature.
The English tongue is our priceless
heritage whereby we as a people and
as individuals are made members of
the widest community of intelligence
j and freedom in the records of man
! kind and and sharers of the simplest
traditions of vigor, integrity and self
government, and it behooves us to
deal considerately with it, and keep it
in honor. This possession, further
j more, we hold in joint title with many
I peoples in many lands, and we may
not ask for the portion of goods that
is ours without injuring the rights
of others and likewise impairing our
own estate and the inheritance of our
children. In the jealous keepership of
i ur children an .dour children's chil
dren, the tongue in which our fathers'
spoke the freedom of the individual
man shall become the chief instru

men.

doubly decimated the monied support
ot Berkeley and disheveled the glo
ries of Sanford's poecile walls un
shed to clearer view the greater
University of Man we always knew
was always there, the university of
common purpose in common love of
truth and cleanness, —not anchored
r o the soil of any place, not named
with names, not built with hands
1 am sure there never was a time
when, by the touch of world-wide
. ynpathy, Stanford felt more cc.*-
tf!inly conscious of its part in t;:is
greater university; I am sure ihire
never was a day when the hand-clasp
of Stanford and Berkeley carried the
heart-beat, as this day which by its
ve r y circumstances remind of com
mon loss and common task, and
blends oneness of fate with oneness
of spirit. A memorial will we rear

it shall he a witness between us, and

The chief instrument of that inter
communication amongst men upon
which is conditioned human sympa
thy and mutual understanding as the
ha: is ot the larger life in human so
ciety is language. The significance or
this occasion prompts me therefore
to some remarks on unity of standard
in intercourse by language, and 1 an:
further encouraged thereto by the
consideration that philology having
of late "got into politics" a little, is
suffering the usual maltreatment in
current discussions. It is not with
a view to taking sides in a practical
controversy, but in order to present
some fundamenal principles of the
science of language pertinent thereto
and commonly ignored, that I make
tliis my venture, trusting to your
kind allowance, that philology, now
that various walks of life have had
hearing in the matter may not seem
to trespass in claiming for its adum
brations the right to throw some fur
ther shadows upon the question.
The definition of language as
voice expressive of thought is doubly
inadequate. In the first place, it is
far less a means of expression than a
vehicle of communication. Histori
cally it takes its form almost entire
ly, not from the prompting to express
what is within one, but from the sug
gestions of hearing as to what will
be intelligible to others. It is a
means of communication; it always
takes into account the other man; it
is pre-eminently a social instrument.
In the second place, it is, in modern
civilized society, addressed more to
the eye than to the ear. Most of us
read every day more language than
we hear, even if we limit our read
ing to newspapers and text-books,
but if we turn to the higher intellec
tual life, there can be no doubt that
our acquaintance with the larger range
of powers and possibilities in lan
guage is determined measurably more
by reading than by hearing. Broad
ened intercourse in the world of men
is calling more and more for an in
tercommunication of thought not re
stricted to the range of a speaker's
voice. We resent the power of dis
tance to keep men and ideas -ind
sympathies asunder, and we refuse to
condition intercommunication upon a
certain physical propinquity of
larynxes and ears. The phonograph
and the telephone are ultro-modern
devices for annulling distance and
bringing larynx and ear nearer to
gether. As such these instruments
aid in returning language to its orig
inal character as sound addressed to
the car. Still if we were from this
time on to abandon altogether
the pen and the printing press, and
make our libraries into storehouses
of phonograph cylinders, we should
at least cut ourselves off from the
past, for written language is an in
srument not only of triumph over
space, but even more significantly, as
a means of record, an instrument of
triumph over time. One may fairly
presume, I think, that the device of
written language, by which man
has been slowly lifting himself dur
ing the last four millenia out of
the shackles of space and time, i.e
out of savagery, is not likely to be
abandoned forthwith. The problem
however, of how to hold the
written language in intelligible re
lation to the viscous body of the
the essential value of the former as
an agency of civilization will com
mand increasing attention, and
will demand the co-operaion of
special knowledge, boad human
wisdom, and withal much caution, for
the problem is beset with grave dif
ficulties. and as most specially con
cerns the English language of all
languages there arc or ever have
been.
As every language serves the
purpose of communication among the
members of its speech-community it

follows that every language is a
standardized product. This is true of
spoken language as well as of written
language, though in a more refined
degree and less obtrusively.
The modern state is national by
virtue, not of unity of blood or faith,
but pre-eminently by virtue of unity
ii, the medium intercourse, primar
ily by writing, secondarily by speech.
Germany has one recognized stand
ard language overlying various
shrinking dialects of speech; likewise
France, Italy, Holland, Spain, Nor
way is held aloof from Sweden by a
distinct standard of Scandinavian
speech, and is turned toward Den
mark. Austria-Hungary fails of na
tionality from lack of a common
idiom.
I come now to speak of the English
language. This has made more than
a nation, and more than an empire.
The one instance in history of a sin
gle language serving two great em
pires, it has dedicated a broad region
belting the globe to free intercourse
and equality before tfie law.
(Here follow certain points of
view on the proposed change in spell
ing-)
First: Uniformity in the written
language throughout its entire terri
tory in any given period, as the pres
ent, is ;t prime demand of civilized
intercourse.
Second: The establishment for the
United States of a standard of written
English different from that recog
nized elsewhere in the English
speaking territory is an isolating and
divisive movement promising loss and
waste to intercourse and culture, and
introducing consciousness of con
trariety where the opposite is desired.
The needless irritation caused by the
minor differences already existing
points ominously to what would re
sult from greater.
Third—The English language is not
the property of the people of the
United States, still less of its gov
ernment ; it is a precious possession
of the English-speaking world, and
:he maral authority to interfere in its
legulation must arise out of the en
tire body and not from a segment
thereof.
Fourth—Every person who is born
to the use of the language inherits
thereby a definite advantage in the
world of intellectual gain, for influ
ence and effectiveness, yes, even for
commercial success, by very reason
of its extension of use in uniformity
of standard. This inherited advan
tage constitutes vested interest, and
must not be trifled with.
Fifth —Any radical change, such as
for instance would be involved in pho
netic writing, would have the effect
of cutting us off from the language of
Shakespeare and the English Bible,
making this a semi-foreign idiom, to
be acquired by special study. In-*
deed our entire present library col
lections of English books would be
placed beyond the reach of the ordi
nary reader, and be as Dutch to his
eyes. The bond uniting all the pro
ducts of the language from the Eliza
bethan period to the present day cre
ates a very precious heritage for
every speaker of he English tongue.
Sixth—The adoption of a phonetic
writing, it should furthermore be re
membered. would involve imitation of
the various dialectal forms of the
spoken language, all of which is high
h interesting to phonologists, but 10
the plain reader anathema.

Seventh—Print is addressed to the
eye, and the reader's eye taking in
1 whole words or even the composite
form of whole phrases in rapid glance
I is disturbed and hindered by abnorm
al forms of spelling.
Eighth—The proposal gradually to
] introduce through ' the co-operation
, of volunteers a certain number of new
spellings and then, when these arc
I well under way, presumably certain
others, seems to promise an area of
[ ghastly confusion in printing offices
and in private orthography and hcte
rography, as well as much irritation
: to readers' eyes and spirits.
Ninth—The list of three hundred
words proposed by the Simplified
Spelling Board is a somewhat hap
j hazard collection following no very
clear principle of selection. One
I hundred and fifty-seven of them, such
as color for colour, are already in
their docked form familiar to Ameri
i can usage. The remainder seem to
| owe their inclusion in the list to their
! having been misspelled a number of
times in English literature.
The English tongue is our priceless
heritage whereby we as a people and
as individuals are made members of
the widest community of intelligence
j and freedom in the records of man
! kind and and sharers of the simplest
traditions of vigor, integrity and self
government, and it behooves us to
deal considerately with it, and keep it
in honor. This possession, further
j more, we hold in joint title with many
I peoples in many lands, and we may
not ask for the portion of goods that
is ours without injuring the rights
of others and likewise impairing our
own estate and the inheritance of our
children. In the jealous keepership of
i ur children an .dour children's chil
dren, the tongue in which our fathers'
spoke the freedom of the individual
man shall become the chief instru
ment of unity and peace among all
men.
Benjamin I do Wheeler, President of
the I niversity of California, delivered
the commencement address in Assem
bly 11 all. W heeler spoke upon the
movement toward spelling reforms and
severely criticized the action of Presi
dent Roosevelt in attempting to hasten
matters in that direction. He said in
part:
\\ e are assembled to-day in the
name ol the University not built with
hands. The same disorder of Na
ture which last April made men dis
trust the solid earth on which they
dwelt, revealed to them the sure re
source of human helpfulness; and the
same distress which showed how
small their actual need in things of
sense, pointed straight toward the
tilings that are real and the things
that abide. The same disorder that
doubly decimated the monied support
ot Berkeley and disheveled the glo
ries of Sanford's poecile walls un
shed to clearer view the greater
University of Man we always knew
was always there, the university of
