# GRADUATING CLASS MAKES BEQUEST
## B.S. Allen Reads the Last Will and Testament of the Seniors. 
### 
The Class Will, read by its author,
B. S. Allen, left bequests in the usual
sarcastic way to the incoming Seniors.
The Will is full follows:
We, the class of 1906, "having at
tained maturity in spite of the tem
blor which attempted to graduate us
from life's school without the usual
preliminary formalities and being of
sound, and disposing mind, do here
by make this our last will and testa
ment.
To our Alma Mater, we beqeath a
lifetime of loyalty and devotion to
Stanford ideals as a slight compensa
tion for her loving kindness during

the four years we have just spent as
wards of her red tiled principality.
To her faculty we give gratitude for
the knowledge with which we stand
equipped to begin life's battle, but
greater thanks are due for an out
pouring of the Stanford Spirit which
has been granted us during the dark
days of April.
To a minority of the class of 1907,
we give and bequeath for the term
of one year, the senior sombrero; to
the other members of this class great,
bccau.se of its numbers, we give the
headgear of dignity and honor, for a
tcim of two years and longer if nec
essary. We also bequeath to the
class of 1907 a goodly number of loy
al Stanford men and women whom
the three fates, hard luck, Green and
Gilbert have not permitted to pass
with us. Receive them with due
yratitude 1907, for though they may
not increase your athletic prestige,
i: is certain that some among their
number will be your sole representa
tives in Phi Beta Kappa.
To the classes which fo'low us and
t- us Stanford posterity we 'eavc the
beneficent results of .1 great earth
.ike, which taught us that the
strength of Stanford is not in her
liautiful buildings but in the stout
hearts of the men and women whom
she has trained. To them we be
queath the pleasure of watching the
lebuilding of our beloved church and
the erection of a new arch. We
leave them also the privilege and
pleasure of seeing the erection of a
real gymnasium and a library worthy
•112 the jewel fund .vich is set ."ide to
support it. To accomplish this work
of rebuilding our Alma Mater, we
leave to you in perpetuity the Com
mission of Engineers, a living guaran
tee that the task will be done speed
ily and well.
To succeeding classes and the fac
ulty, we leave the President's Confer
ence Committee, in the fond hope
that the new plan may succeed in
putting an end to tiic estrangement
tvveen the students and the powers
that be. To those who arc so un
fortunate as to be brought into con
tact with the Student Affairs Com

mittee, we bequeath a ray of hope
in the person of its new member, W.
F. Durand.
To the pugnacious members of fut
ure Freshman and Sophomore
classes, we leave the new rush, which,
though not as clean and interesting to
the spectator as tubbing, is more dan
gerous to life and limb. We would
suggest, however, that the referees
permit free fights on the side so that
the spectators will not be bored.
To the women of the University, we
give and bequeath the Cap and Gown
Society in the hope that some day it
may be worthy to be classed with its
male prototype. To this end, we rec
ommend that the present mode of
election, which has kept the great
est of women students from mem
bership, be changed lest it soon be
come as moribund as its predecessor,
the Women's League.
We leave to those wfio have earned
membership in them, the Quadrangle
Club, Press Club, and Sigma Sigma,
three thriving organizations which
promise to do much for Stanford
this year and in the years to come.
The"Daily Palo Alto" we give and
bequeath to G. O. Spurrier and Har
old Fitch, in the hope that it will
continue its course as a true exponent
of student body opinion. To Karl
Bickcl, we give the "Sequoia," confi
dent that said sheet is neither hope
lessly literary nor thoroughly emas
culated. We assure him of our faith
that if necessary he will cause the
"Sequoia" to occupy the place which
is ordinarily held by the other two
sheets.
To D. H. Clift we leave the Chap
arral with the recommendation that
Chappie be restored to its old place
among the college funny papers, for
the perusal of the contents of any
number would have a sobering effect
even 011 the cover design.
The residue of our estate we divide
and apportion as follows: To "Dud"
Sales, "Dick" Barrett's job and his
hard work; to "Jack'* Macfarland, the
'06 track meet; to "Stump" Stott, a
Rugby victory, which is at least
somewhat better than a Rugby de
feat; to George Presley the comple
tion of "Dud" Sales task; to the San
Francisco Relief Committee, Gutten
berg's shoes left on the rock pile Ap
ril 18th; to '07 from '03, '04, '05 and
'06 hopes of a Senior Ball in the new
"Gym"; to the town of Palo Alto,
"Hodge's Dog"; to the town of Gold
field, Nevada, the Pan-Hellenic con
tract; to the shade of Dr. Nathan Ab
bott, the undying love of all law ma
jors, and to the University of Chica
go, the request for a safe return of
the person of the said Nathan Abbott
to an institution which cannot afford
to lose him.
And, finally, to the class of '07, a
challenge to prevent final examina
tions by a more effective means than
the '06 earthquake.

tee that the task will be done speed
ily and well.
To succeeding classes and the fac
ulty, we leave the President's Confer
ence Committee, in the fond hope
that the new plan may succeed in
putting an end to tiic estrangement
tvveen the students and the powers
that be. To those who arc so un
fortunate as to be brought into con
tact with the Student Affairs Com

mittee, we bequeath a ray of hope
in the person of its new member, W.
F. Durand.
To the pugnacious members of fut
ure Freshman and Sophomore
classes, we leave the new rush, which,
though not as clean and interesting to
the spectator as tubbing, is more dan
gerous to life and limb. We would
suggest, however, that the referees
permit free fights on the side so that
the spectators will not be bored.
To the women of the University, we
give and bequeath the Cap and Gown
Society in the hope that some day it
may be worthy to be classed with its
male prototype. To this end, we rec
ommend that the present mode of
election, which has kept the great
est of women students from mem
bership, be changed lest it soon be
come as moribund as its predecessor,
the Women's League.
We leave to those wfio have earned
membership in them, the Quadrangle
Club, Press Club, and Sigma Sigma,
three thriving organizations which
promise to do much for Stanford
this year and in the years to come.
The"Daily Palo Alto" we give and
bequeath to G. O. Spurrier and Har
old Fitch, in the hope that it will
continue its course as a true exponent
of student body opinion. To Karl
Bickcl, we give the "Sequoia," confi
dent that said sheet is neither hope
lessly literary nor thoroughly emas
culated. We assure him of our faith
that if necessary he will cause the
"Sequoia" to occupy the place which
is ordinarily held by the other two
sheets.
To D. H. Clift we leave the Chap
arral with the recommendation that
Chappie be restored to its old place
among the college funny papers, for
the perusal of the contents of any
number would have a sobering effect
even 011 the cover design.
The residue of our estate we divide
and apportion as follows: To "Dud"
Sales, "Dick" Barrett's job and his
hard work; to "Jack'* Macfarland, the
'06 track meet; to "Stump" Stott, a
Rugby victory, which is at least
somewhat better than a Rugby de
feat; to George Presley the comple
tion of "Dud" Sales task; to the San
Francisco Relief Committee, Gutten
berg's shoes left on the rock pile Ap
ril 18th; to '07 from '03, '04, '05 and
'06 hopes of a Senior Ball in the new
"Gym"; to the town of Palo Alto,
"Hodge's Dog"; to the town of Gold
field, Nevada, the Pan-Hellenic con
tract; to the shade of Dr. Nathan Ab
bott, the undying love of all law ma
jors, and to the University of Chica
go, the request for a safe return of
the person of the said Nathan Abbott
to an institution which cannot afford
to lose him.
And, finally, to the class of '07, a
challenge to prevent final examina
tions by a more effective means than
the '06 earthquake.


B. S. Allkn.
The Class Will, read by its author,
B. S. Allen, left bequests in the usual
sarcastic way to the incoming Seniors.
The Will is full follows:
We, the class of 1906, "having at
tained maturity in spite of the tem
blor which attempted to graduate us
from life's school without the usual
preliminary formalities and being of
sound, and disposing mind, do here
by make this our last will and testa
ment.
To our Alma Mater, we beqeath a
lifetime of loyalty and devotion to
Stanford ideals as a slight compensa
tion for her loving kindness during

the four years we have just spent as
wards of her red tiled principality.
To her faculty we give gratitude for
the knowledge with which we stand
equipped to begin life's battle, but
greater thanks are due for an out
pouring of the Stanford Spirit which
has been granted us during the dark
days of April.
To a minority of the class of 1907,
we give and bequeath for the term
of one year, the senior sombrero; to
the other members of this class great,
bccau.se of its numbers, we give the
headgear of dignity and honor, for a
tcim of two years and longer if nec
essary. We also bequeath to the
class of 1907 a goodly number of loy
al Stanford men and women whom
the three fates, hard luck, Green and
Gilbert have not permitted to pass
with us. Receive them with due
yratitude 1907, for though they may
not increase your athletic prestige,
i: is certain that some among their
number will be your sole representa
tives in Phi Beta Kappa.
To the classes which fo'low us and
t- us Stanford posterity we 'eavc the
beneficent results of .1 great earth
.ike, which taught us that the
strength of Stanford is not in her
liautiful buildings but in the stout
hearts of the men and women whom
she has trained. To them we be
queath the pleasure of watching the
lebuilding of our beloved church and
the erection of a new arch. We
leave them also the privilege and
pleasure of seeing the erection of a
real gymnasium and a library worthy
•112 the jewel fund .vich is set ."ide to
support it. To accomplish this work
of rebuilding our Alma Mater, we
leave to you in perpetuity the Com
mission of Engineers, a living guaran
tee that the task will be done speed
ily and well.
