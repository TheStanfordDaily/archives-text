# First Rugby Game On Saturday.
## 
### 
Next Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock the first Rugby game will be
played on Stanford Field. The op
posing teams will be picked from the
members of the varsity squad. Judg
ing from the scrimmage work last
Saturday afternoon, the game should
be closely contested and interesting.
Coach Lanagan took charge of the
Freshmen last night and started
scrimmage work with two picked
teams. The lirst year men did not
show up as well as the varsity fif
teens. The work of the forwards in
the scrum was poor and the backs
lacked speed and accuracy in their
passing.
