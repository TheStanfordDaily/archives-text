# TO COMPLETE TRACK
## SURFACING AND CURBING TO BE FINISHED. Commission of Engineers Will Donate and Haul Debris for Foundation. 
### 
Work on the new track, including
sufacing and curbing, will be rapidly
finished in order that he track prop
ed, the o straightaway, the paths,
and the take-offs may be completed
before the heavy rains.
The Commission of Engineers has
offered to Manager 1). D. Sales, '06,
enough broken rock to amply cover
the graded track about four inches
deep, with small pieces of stone and
brick. The Commission will haul
the material to the track free of
charge. A rock-crusher will be
erected at a convenient place and the
miscellaneous stones and bricks re
duced to a proper size to constitute
;i bed for the soil to be laid. The
expense of distributing the crushed
material will be borne by the stu
dent body.
A layer of clay will follow the rock.
The soil that is used by Trainer
"l)ad" Moulton for tliis purpose is
found in a cellar in Palo Alto and is
extremely rare in this part of the
country. It has an unusually small
.••mount of sand in its composition
mill resists the effects of soaking by
r;iin better than any other known
- übstance. The cinders will be laid
upon this clay.
A\ ith tlie $_'oo set aside by the
cl.'i-s of 1006 for the track. Manager
Sales has $340 on hand. Of ibis $[40
■nil! be used at once to meet miscel
laneous expenses. It is estimated
that the curbing alone of the track
will cost in the neighborhood of
$:00.
