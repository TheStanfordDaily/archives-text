# MEN'S CHORUS FORMED
## STUDENTS INAUGURATE NEW MUSICAL ORGANIZATION. Dr. Blodgett Will Have Complete Supervision of All Rehearsals. 
### 
A new musical organization has
made its appearance in the shape of
the "Stanford's Men's Chorus," which
held its first rehearsal Thursday
evening in the chapel under the
leadership of Dr. B. C. Blodgett, or
ganist. It was in pursuance of his
expressed enthusiasm and desire that
a meeting of all men interested in
chorus work was called at which
plans were perfected by some thirty
men for the formation of a men's
chorus somewhat after the style of
the large choruses now existent in all
big cities.
An executive committee composed
1 of S. Moser, '06, Barkelew, '08, and
E. G. Sheibley, 08, was elected to at
! tend to necesasry business. An as
sessment of one dollar per member
was voted to pay for music which
Dr. Blodgett has ordered.
At the first meeting of the execu
tive committee it was decided to ad
here to a plan well tried in chorus
work in Eastern cities, which pro
vides that any member, 011 leaving
the organization, may take with him
a copy of such music as he has help
!ed to buy. Any new member will
| be required to gain the approval of
1 the executive committee before join
! ing.
At the Thursday evening rehearsal
Dr. Blodgett said: "We are here to
| r-ight to form a chorus to sing good
J things, not for the success that may
I be involved, but for our own love of
' music. We want men who are will
! ing to give up an hour a week and
give it up regularly; not the man
j who, however well he may sing, un
dertakes to attend rehearsals spas
modically, for above all things, con
sistent hard work is needed to make
a chorus."
