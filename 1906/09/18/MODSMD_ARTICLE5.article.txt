# SUPPORTS RUGBY GAME
## FACULTY COMMITTEE SENDS LETTER TO PREP. SCHOOLS. Urges Them to Adopt English Game Following Lead of Stanford and California. 
### 
An open letter signed by Dr. Frank
Angell, chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee and bearing the
stamp of President Jordan's approval,
j was mailed to-day to all the great
preparatory schools on the Coast,
urging them to adopt the Rugby
j game. It states in full the objections
to the old game and the reasons why
Rugby was adopted by the faculty
committees of Stanford and Califor
nia The text of the letter follows:
Stanford University,
September 18, 1906.
| Dear Sir ; —
The game of football as pl.iyed laft
I year in most of the schools and c »!-
leges in the United States was given
up by theUniversity of California and
Stanford University, for various rea
sons. Chief among these were the
tendency of the same to favor un
j fair and tricky play, the chances it
! gave for undetected brutality, and
the fatalities in the sport arising from
the dangerous character of the play.
The conference appointed by the
presidents of the universities was of
the opinion that in the long run the
Ir'gh schools and colleges would
probably come to play the same form
of game, and inasmuch as almost all
of the twenty-seven players killed
last year under the old rules were
school boys, and most of them high
school boys, the conference felt that
the game should be changed to some
form which was not a menace to the
lives of players who were more or less
immature or who had not the bene
fit of elaborate training and expen
i she equipment.
Accordingly, after careful delibera-
I tion in repeated meetings, the con
j ference recommended the Rugby
J game of football as played in Great
1 Britain and throughout the British
j colonies. While the rules of this
! game permit tackling and running
j with the ball, and the play thereof
j is often rough and in some respects
I harder than the American game, it
does not appear that it is dangerous
to life and limb. The secretary of
the Rugby Union of British Colum
bia, which comprises a large number
of clubs, informs 11s mat no fatal
! accident has occurred in the matches
played by the Union since its forma
tion.
1 We therefore recommend the Rug
-1 by football to your consideration as a
R;ime which for many years has been
I tried and tested by an athletic peo
' pie; a game which while rough is not
'necessarily dangerous to life; one
which docs not put a premium 011 1111-
I fair play; a game which calls for a
I higher degree of football skill 011
j the part of the individual player and
I which therefore places less of a
premium <>11 mere weight and brute
force than is the case with the game
played in thi > country.
It is unfortunateTy true that this
1 year there are but few coaches

available to teach the Rugby game.
On the other hand, as the sport de
pends more on the acquirement of
football skill and the possession of
staying qualities on the part of the
individual players than is the case
with the American game, the coach
is not a necessary adjunct in devel
oping a good team after the rules of
the game have been learned.
