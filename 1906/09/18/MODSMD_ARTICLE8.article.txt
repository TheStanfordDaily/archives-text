With the Inn closed this year the
problem of finding a suitable and con
venient eating place is more perplex
ing to Encina men, and many other
residents of the campus as well, than
ever before. There are only two
boarding places on the campus, and
they are already crowded with about
seventy-live hoarders froi;i the Hall
and the different lodging houses.
This number represents a very small
percentage of the campus residents
who cannot eat at their lodging
place, there being two hundred and
fifty men in Encina alone. The re
sult is that a large number fully two
thirds, of the Encina men are forced
to eat either in clubs at College
Terrace or at Palo Alto restaurants.
Both these places are a mile from
Encina Hall and the great inconven
ience of being forced to travel such
a distance three times a day is clearly
evident. It is an imposition upon
the Encina men and there appears to
be no good reason for it.
.\ university of this size, with a
handsome dormitory housing so
hirge a number of students, should
certainly offer these students some
suitable eating facilities. The busi
ness management announced this
year that a suitable tenant could not
be obtained for the Inn. It seems
that this must be due in some meas
ure to the terms imposed by the
business management, which will not
allow a person to lease the Inn for
more than a year. Xo matter what
the reason may be, the fact remains
that there is no convenient place for
Encina men to eat and it works a
Rreat injustice which will be doubled
when the rainy season begins.
It is a difficult matter to suggest
a solution of this eating problem,
hut it is imperative that some change
should he made to improve the pres
ent deplorable conditions. If eating
clubs, which are highly successful on
the I errace, were allowed on the
utmpus it would undoubtedly: relieve
the situation. But still it seems
reasonable to believe that Stanford

University should have an Inn which
would compare favorably with the
Inns at Cornell and Princeton,
which are successfully managed and
occupy an important place in college I
life as a gathering place for the stu
dents.
