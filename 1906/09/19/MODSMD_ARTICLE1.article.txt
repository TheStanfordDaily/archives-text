# 1907 TO ISSUE "QUAD."
## TWO HUNDRED PAGE BOOK WILL APPEAR THIS SEMESTER. Two Dollar Assesment Will Be Levied On Members of Senior Class. 
### 
The 1907 "Quad" will be published
before college closes for this semes
ter. This was the decision of the
Senior class at their meeting this
afternoon. The volume will contain
two hundred pages of reading matter
and art work and will be modelled
along the lines of the first issue of
the annual in '95.
When the meeting was called to
order, editor K. A. Bickel, 07, took
the fioor and read his report outlin
ing the two schemes for issuing the
"Quad." The proposition for the
smaller issue of the annual to be
printed before Christmas was adopt
ed practically without discussion. In
his report Bickel read a request from
the '08 "Quad" editor and manager
that '07 would leave /he advertising
field to the present Junior class. No
formal action was taken 011 this re
quest.
To raise funds for the publication
of the "Quad," a two dollar assess
ment will be levied on every member
of the Junior class. The volume it
self will sell for $2.50, a dollar less
than the price for the regular annual.
By this means Bickel hopes to be
able to get out the book without re
sorting to advertising.
S. M. Salisbury and S. S. Smith
were appointed to manage the
"Quad" in place of J. F. Brennan,
who has left college. Bickel and all
of last year's board who are now 011
the campus will handle the editorial
end.
