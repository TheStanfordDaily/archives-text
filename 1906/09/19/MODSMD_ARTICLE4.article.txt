# STRONG SPEECHES AT ASSEMBLY.
## President Jordan, C.F. Laumeister and "Dad" Moulton Address the Student Body. 
### 
The first assembly of the semester
and the first gathering of the .stu
dent body since the abupt closing of
college last spring was held this
morning in Assembly Hall. The
meeting was well attended and some
enthusiastic yelling and singing was
engaged in.
President David Starr Jordan pre
sided and made the principal address,
which was intended for the special
benefit of the Freshman class. C. F.
Laumeister, '07, student body presi
dent, made a very creditable address
in which he called for the support of
the student body in the Rugby sea
son. He stated that although some
were sorry to see the old game of
football go, the time for weeping
was past and that the time for action
had come. He also requested that
the appeal for funds to build the track
be met liberally.
Dr. Jordan, in presenting trainer
Moulton, called attention to the fact
that a new degree had been voted to
the veteran. "IX D." is the title,
which Pesident Jordan explained
signified "Dear Dad."
Trainer Moulton spoke of the de
plorable condition of the track and
declared that more money should be
spent to make the cinder path in
keeping will the standard set by the
football stadium. He quoted statis
tics to show that a larger number
of athletes were represented on the
track than in any other branch of ex
ercise. lie expressed an opinion that
Rugby would not prove as gentle a
game as was generally expected but
that rather it would turn out to be
a good, brisk, manly sport.
Regarding the money for the new
track, "Dad" stated that $250 lias al
ready been subscribed, $200 from the
class of 1906 and $50 from Sigma
Sigma. A student subscription will
be taken in order to get the neces
sary funds for the rapid completion
of the track.
President Jordan in his address,
complimented the amount of Stan
ford Spirit that has been shown by
the returning classes. To the Fresh
men he gave advice 111 keeping with
their position in the University.
Dr. Jordan said in part:
"The University is made of men,
not of buildings. This we have often
said before the 18th of last April. It
i> for us now to make it good.
"This the earthquake has done for
11s. It has brought us back to pio
neer times. The University was
built on love and trust and hope.
I was built for men and women of
courage, the true pioneers who felt
that in the new University, there
was something for them, something
thev could find nowhere else and
tliey were not afraid. With the
breaks in the walls, the coming of
adversity, the need for the old zeal
and faith has come again, and we
know how splendid the response.
"This is the test of what we call
the Stanford Spirit, the spirit which
is good in adversity or prosperity
alike, and this spirit is with all the

old students and the new students
will find it very catching.
"1 have said many times the Uni
versity belongs to the students. It
is for their use. It is for them that
it has been planned and built and
completed. But it is theirs to pre
serve it, to see that 110 harm comes
to its buildings, its traditions, its rep
utation, its ideals. It does not be
long to the students who are here to
day, nor this year, rtor this century.
It belongs to all Stanford students of
all time, and you must not abuse it
nor vulgarize it.
"And so it cannot be put without
reserve into inexperienced hands.
You have to grow, to became wise,
to get over the habits of narrowness,
of selfishness, of vulgarity and of
muckerism, before you can be mas
ters of your university.
"Rowdyism is not an academic
I thing; drunkenness is not a Univer
sity function ; a Stanford banner is a
red rag when you flaunt it in a Menlo
Park saloon, and all Stanford insig
nia are signs of shame when you car
ry them where a gentleman should
not go.
"For all these reasons, so long as
you are Freshmen, so long as you
are undergraduates, the faculty will
not turn over the University to you.
You may take what you please—it
is all yours for the taking, but with
your teachers is the final word as to
what you shall do w ; th it. We must
see that ignorance, inexperience, idle
ness and vulgarity leave no perma
nent mark 011 Stanford men.
" 'The University exists, so Presi
dent Hadley tells us, 'to maintain
standards.' And the standards of
scholarship, of behavior, of ideals
shall be kept high at Stanford. And
one way to do this, as the old stu
dents will tell you, is to take the man
of low standards to the edge of the
Campus and there wish him God
speed and hope he will be back in six
months.
"Be athletic. In this climate, you
can afford to do out of door things.
Keep active, —this is not your time
"to bask and ripen." A college life
should be taken on the run. It will
get you in the habit of running.
There is 110 part of the college teach
ing worth more than the power to
interpret ideas in terms of action.
"Stanford is a democratic place.
It don't care who your father was,
what your ancestry was, where you
came from or even "what was your
name in the states." It asks only
what you are —or rather what can
Stanford make of you, for you must
all in your fashion be born again.
"All that the men and women of
the Freshman class have to do is to
watch the others, to act just as dif
ferently as you can, and when the
question is one of Stanford Spirit, to
fall into line and then to feel and to
speak and to act just as you see the
others do. And when your day
comes, the Stanford mantle will fall
! on you and wherever you go, you
will carry the Stanford Spirit."
