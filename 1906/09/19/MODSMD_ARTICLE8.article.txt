The action of the Faculty Athletic
Committee in issuing to the prepara
tory schools an open letter urging
them to adopt the Rugby game
seems untimely and ill-advised. Rug
by is upon a trial basis at Stanford
and California and its success as an
American collegiate game is in 110
wise so certain that it can be recom
mended thus widely and unhesitat
ingly. The preparatory schools of
California are in 110 condition to take
up the English game. At Stanford
and California Rugby starts under
the most favorable circumstances,
with expert coaches and full equip
ment, and we hope and believe it will
be a success. But coaches and equip
ment are both scarce and expensive;
few institutions below collegiate
rank can afford them. Without them
a school-boy's attempt to learn the
new sport is liable to end in the play
ing of a game, neither English nor
American, but with the vices of both.
The important consideration is
that the letter opens its attack upon
the American game with the state
ment that it"was abolished by Stan
ford and California for various rea
sons.'' This assertion would give the
impression that the action was the
result of a student-body sentiment,
opposed to American football, and
prevalent at both Stanford and Cal
ifornia. Such was palpably not the
case. It was with the greatest re
gret that those most vitally inter
ested in football, —tne students them
selves, —saw the old game go, and it
with almost as much regret that we
see a statement circulated which
might be construed as saying that
these students were the authors of
its abolishment.
It is inadvisable to discuss the rel
ative merits of the two games to
day, because the English game has
not yet had a trial. We wish no fur
ther recommendation of the sport
than that of James F. Lanagan, who
says Rugby is a good game. But we
do not wish to stand sponsor for its
introduction when in reality we were
the sincerest mourners at the death
of its rival. However, that is past,
and the English game will be tried
with the same spirit that character
ized the playing of the former game.
