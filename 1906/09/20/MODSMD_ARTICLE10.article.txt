### 
The September issue of the "Se
quoia" will appear next Monday, and
with it will begin a new era in the
make-up and policy of the periodi
cal. The coming issue contains num
erous articles of vital interest to the
University community, besides a full
quota of excellent fiction and verse.
In a forcibly written discussion of
Stanford politics, W. F. Herron, '08,
says, "Stanford politics are not cor
rupt; they are only disorganized and
unintelligent. What we need is a
political boss." The writer also goes
011 to caustically criticize the politics
among the women of the University,
and to tell of the recent campaigns
for the various offices. The article
is illustrated with cuts of D. D. Sales,
'06, and M. Oppenheim, '05, who
managed Sales' recent fight for
Graduate Manager.
Editorially the "Sequoia" com
ments upon the introduction of a new
element in the University's politics,
that of the faculty. Their influence
has been felt recently in regard to
the withdrawal of prospective candi
dates from the field. Besides this
comment, editorial space has been
given to a discussion of Rugby, its
merits and its drawbacks.
With this issue the periodical begins
a series of special articles by J. E.
Cushing, '08. The first subject treat
ed will be the splendid development
of the"Daily Palo Alto'' under the
six great editors, beginning with Or
rin A. Wilson, and ending with Ben
S. Allen. Other subjects to be writ
ten upon in the future will be the
"Executive Committee," "Baseball"
and "Football."
Another article of exceptional in
terest at the present time has been
written by Miss Helen Pope, '04,
upon sorority rushing at Mount
Holyoke College. Miss Pope has
admirably pointed out the strength
of the Eastern system.
James F. Lanagan, '00, and H.
Merton Ostroski, '09. have both writ
ten articles for the September issue
011 the new intercollegiate sport.
Ostroski was a member of the cham
pionship Rugby team of the Western
Dominion of Canada and he is thus
in a position to write interestingly
on the game.
The strong short stories of the
new number have been written by
Laura Wells, '09, and Antoinette
Crawford, '08. Verses are by James
Temple, W. F. Uerron, '08, and J. k.
Hutchinson, '09.
The cover of the magazine will be
in three colors, and will have a cut
of E. P. Stott, 07, as a cover feature.
Four new appointments to the
staff of the "Sequoia"' have been
announced. They arc: Miss An
toinette Crawford, '08, Miss Laura
Wells, '09, Vergil F. Bellows, '09, and
J. K. Hutchinson, '09.
