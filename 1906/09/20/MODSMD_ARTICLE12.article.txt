The members of the University
Band who have returned to college
are meeting with unwarranted dis
couragement in their efforts at re
organization. There is a great deal
of talent available in the University,
and there is no reason why Stanford
cannot have a band which will be
a great credit to the institution.
While the semester is yet young a
plea for new members is in order, so
that the band may begin practice at
once. The reward for the time and
energy devoted to the band by its
members has never been attractive,
in fact, the band has been the subject
of considerable misdirected criticism
in the past. Doubtless if steps were
to be taken whereby this organization
could be put on an equal basis with
other similar organizations which
have the support of the Associated
Students, the inducements could be
made much more attractive. With
an increased membership the stand
ard of the band can be raised and the
change suggested will then be attain
able.
