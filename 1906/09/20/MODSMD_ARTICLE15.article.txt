# REPORT OF MEET
## INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION IS PROSPEROUS. Receipts of Preparatory School Track Meet Were $666.50 and Expenditures $344.00. 
### 
Dr. Frank Angell, treasurer of the
Interscholastic Athletic Association,
has tiled his annual report, which
was delayed by the earthquake. The
Interscholastic Meet has proved an
unqualified success and will hold a
very prominent place in Stanford ath
letic contests. In view of the prob
able increased competition for the
next field day, Dr. Angell offers
some valuable sugestions in conjunc
tion with the report.
"Taking out a small sum to meet
the preliminary expenses of next
year's meet, I would suggest that the
remainder be put at interest until the
larger expenses be incurred. The
success of the meet will insure a
larger attendance next year, and it is
very far from the intention of the
Board of Governors to manage the
event with a view to financial profit.
The first question that arises is: Shall
we reduce the receipts to a small but
safe margin of profit, or shall we set
aside a fund whose interest shall
provide for special cups and medals?
Certain measures are obvious; such,
for example, as a decrease of the
entrance fee. It has also been sug
gested that, in view of the large
number of entrants at these meets,
special accommodations for the par
ticipants be constructed. But what
ever plan the Board of Governors
may finally adopt, I should earnestly
advise against any considerable in
crease in the cost of medals.
"In the unavoidable confusion of
setting a new undertaking in motion,
certain irregularities occurred which
may be easily avoided hereafter: I
have, for example paid bills for
stamps and railroad tickets for which
no vouchers were turned in. I know,
of course, that these were legitimate
expenses paid for by members of the
Board out of their own pockcts.
