The matter of securing Coach Dan
Murphy to instruct the candidates
tor the Stanford rowing crews was
discussed at length. It is the opinion
of the Executive Committee and the
sentiment of the student body at
large that Murphy should be retain
ed, if possible, the only drawback to
his engagement being a financial one.
ile has asked Manager Sales, '06, for
$35 per week. As Sales feels that
the Associated Students could hardly
draw a contract with Murphy at such
terms, an endeavor to secure Murphy
at a lower salary will be made.
A "smokerless smoker'' was pro
posed by Manager Sales as a means
of raising funds in order to help fill
the depleted treasury of the Associat
ed Students. Such an affair would
partake of the nature of a vaudeville
show and would be followed by an
informal dance in Encina Hall. The
suggestion was discussed with favor
by the committee, as similar func
tions have been given with success
in Eastern universities. October
12th, the night before the intercol
legiate Freshman Rugby game, is se
lected as a probable date for the
"smoker."
C. R. Crider, '07, was appointed
official gate-keeper for all athletic
contests to be held on the campus
this year.
