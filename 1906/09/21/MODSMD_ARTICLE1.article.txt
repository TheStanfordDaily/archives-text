# GREEN INTERVIEWED
## SPEAKS OF PAST ACTIONS OF COMMITTEE. During Term as Chairman Average of Five Men Yearly Have Been Suspended. 
### 
111 an interview today with Profes
sor Rufus Lot Green, late chairman
of the Committee on Student Affairs,
some of the important details of the
work of the committee since its or
ganization in 1892 were discussed.
Professor Green stated that the
work of the committee has been two
fold: disciplinary work and aid in
matters of importance in regard to
the welfare of the affairs of the stu
dent body. The policy of the body
was distinctly not one of spying or
detective work, he said. No action
was ever taken on second-hand in
formation, but only on specific com
plaint, and the average number of
men dropped annually from the Uni
versity was only five. In many in
stances students who failed in their
studies, and who left on that ac
count only, were said to have come
under the ban of the Student Affairs
Committee. Thus this body and the
Scholarship Committee were often
confused in the public mind. Re
garding the students dropped from
the University, he said:
"Although the average number of
men dropped in a year was only five,
the last two years have unfortunately
seen an increase. Two years ago the
disciplinary board dropped nine men,
all for flagrant drunkenness. Last
year six men and one woman were
suspended. Ben S. Allen was one of
these. Of the others four were barred
for hazing, one for drunkenness, and
the last for theft.
"It is safe to say that but one man
has ever been expelled finally. In
every other case the men have been
permitted to return, providing the
person in < question exhibited the
qualities that can make a good man.
This fact shows that the committee's
policy was not nearly so strict or
harsh as was generally supposed.
"The committee has had complete
control of Encina Hall only since the
earthquake. Before that the dormi
tory was under the joint administra
tion of the faculty bodies and the
Busintss Office."
The Student Affairs Committee ha«
been in existence since the beginning
of the University. The late Pro
fessor Wilbur W. Thoburn was the
chairman in early days. Professor
Green became a member of the com
mittee in 1895, and upon Professor
Thoburn's withdrawal a year later
took the chairmanship himself and
held it until yesterday. Since that
time only two cases upon which the
committee has taken action have at
tracted the attention of the public.
These were the instances of Will Ir
win, '96, and Ben S. Allen, '06.
Professor Green came here in 1893
from Indiana University to ac
cept the position of Associate Profes
sor of Pure Mathematics. He was
made Professor in T894. Professor
Green graduated from Indiana Uni
versity in 1885, and knew President
Jordan personally. It was at Prcsi

dent Jordan's urgent call that Green
came to Stanford.
Professor Green gives as a reason
tor his resignation the fact that he
was utterly tired of the committee
work, and that public sentiment had
not the least influence upon him in
the step lie has recently taken.
