The resignation of Prof. R. L.
Green as chairman of the Student Af
fairs Committee and the announce
ment that an entirely new committee
will be selected confirms the belief
that Stanford is entering upon a new
era in which a better understanding
will be brought about betwen the
students and those in control of Uni
versity affairs. Through the influ
ence of the President's Conference
much may be attained which in pre
vious years it has not been possible
to even bring to the notice of the
authorities. Differences which form
erly led to bitter disputes between
the "powers that be" and the stu
dents may now be brought before
the Conference, from which they
may be presented to the proper
officials.
We feel certain that the new Stu
dent Affairs Committee, of which the
chairman will undoubtedly be Prof.
W. F. Durand, the temporary ap
pointee, will view with absolute fair
ness and full consideration any mat
ters that may be brought to their
notice, either through the Presi
dent's Conference or in the direct re
lations of the Committee with the
students. Matters had reached a state
so impossible of an amicable solution
that a change is gladly welcomed by
the student body. With a new com
mittee which is able to take up its
duties unhampered by any past quar
rels and which has the confidence of
the students there should be no pos
sibility of a repetition of troubles
similar to those of the past semester.
