# SENIORS PLAN CIRCUS
## CLASS OF 1907 WILL GIVE GREAT CARNIVAL. Open-Air Production in the Form of a Midway Is Planned for November. 
### 
The Senior Class plans to give a
burlesque circus some time during
the latter part of November. L. M.
Edwards, 07, has been appointed to
have full charge of the production.
The circus will be much in the
same form as a "Midway" or "Pike"
at a great exposition, much smaller
and more limited in its scope. It will
include a multitude of attraction* in
the form of minstrels, vaudeville,
trained dogs, burlesque and acrobats.
The plans for the production of
the circus are as yet but general, and
nothing definite has been decided.
Manager Edwards has written a let
ter to the Universities of Michigan
and Wisconsin, and to Cornell,
asking for further information
upon the college circus, which is a
great event at these institutions.
If the necessary permission can be
secured, the circus will be given in
the new football stadium.
President E. P. Stott has appointed
a committee which will report to the
class at the next meeting. All plans
for the circus will then be discussed.
The committee is as follows: A. B.
Packard, C. F. Laumeister, C. R.
Crider, S. B. Thompson, W. A. Camp
bell, R. S. Kellogg and L. M. Ed
wards, chairman.
