## 
### 
The Board of Governors of the In
terscholastic Athletic Association
met Thursday afternoon in Dr. All
- office. The sum of $150 was
appropriated from the general fund
for the purpose of constructing a
drainage system on the new track.
Dr. Angell and the board opposed
this money being used for the new
tiack without specific benefit to the
Interscholastic meet. In view of the
fact that the meet is an early one,
and the consequent liability of the
track being in poor condition, this
appropriation was made. This will
insure the track being in good con
dition for the field-day next March.
