# REDS VERSUS BLACKS
## FIRST RUGBY GAME TOMORROW AT FOUR-THIRTY. Two Fast Teams Picked from Varsity Squad Will Meet on Stanford Field. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 two
teams picked from the varsity squad
will meet in the first Rugby game
to be played 011 Stanford field. They
will be practically the same teams
which have been meeeing in practice
scrimmage all week. On paper the
teams seem to be evenly matched,
with a slight difference in favor of
the Reds. The forwards 011 both
teams are about the same average
weight but the Red backfield is the
faster and more experienced.
The game was originally announc
ed for three o'clock but has been
postponed until four-thirty to enable
all the players to get out on the
field.
Aside from its interest as the first
Rugby game 011 the Stanford campus,
tomorrow's contest should afford a
good line on the work of the varsity
candidates. The men are picking up
the game fast and there has been a
decided improvement in the practice
of the varsity squad during the past
week.
