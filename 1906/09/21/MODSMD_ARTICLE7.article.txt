a committee of three to investigate
the matter.
In case new eating houses are built
the question of opening the Inn as a
Stanford headquarters was discussed,
the idea being to use the building as
a meeting place for various college
organizations. This plan was favored
by many, as heertofore there has been
110 central place where meetings
could be held, other than in various
fraternity houses or in a room on the
quad. It was also suggested that a
trophy room might be started con
taining cups, banners, and trophies
won in intercollegiate contests. A
committee consisting of \\ . A. Camp
bell, '07, Paul C. Edwards, '07, and
B. S. Allen, '07. was appointed to in
vestigate the matter and report at the
next meeting, which will probably be
