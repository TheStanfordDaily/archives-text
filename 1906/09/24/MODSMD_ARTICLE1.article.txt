# RUGBY GAME IS SLOW
## REDS DEFEAT BLACKS BY ONE TRY ON SATURDAY. Holman's Run to a Score Redeeming Feature of Uninteresting Contest. Freshmen Play Well. 
### 
Breaking through a scattered field
for forty yards, Holman scored the
only try in Saturday's contest, win
ning for the Reds the first Rugby
game ever played on Stanford Field.
The score was made from the first
scrum in the second half. Stott pick
ed out the ball and shot it to Chalm
ers, who passed to Severy. Severy
stepped to one side and punted clean
ly over the heads of the advancing
Black forwards. Holman starting
from the wing picked up the ball on
the run and dodged down the field
for a try. Fenton missed a hard
goal. Outside of this one bit of
brilliant work, the game was slow
and uninteresting. There were num
erous penalties and free kicks which
delayed the more spectacular scrums
and the passing in the backfield of
both teams was poor. Twice the
Blacks dribbled the ball down to the
Reds five yard line, only to be held
and driven back by the superior work
of the Red forwards, who never
failed to work the ball out of the
scrum straight into Stott's hands.
There was too much forward pass
ing and fouling in the scrum during
the two fifteen minute halves to give
the spectators a chance to judge
fairly of the merits of the new game.
All the men evidenced a great de
sire to play the old game and run
with the ball —a fault which twice
cost the Reds a chance to score.
Once in the second half Chalmers
broke through the field for twenty
yards but held on to the ball too
long and was dragged down by the
Black backs.
Both teams failed to keep their
backs spread out across the field and
in consequence lost many chances for
long runs down the side lines, as the
man with the ball was rarely back
ed up. Fenton, Stott and Holman
were the stars of the Red backfield,
while Owen and Cole did good work
for the Blacks.
The officials were: Referee—Dr.
Frank Angell. Timekeeper—J. R.
Mickey, '08. No changes were made
n the line up as run in Friday's is
ue of the"Daily Palo Alto."
Following the varsity contest, the
10 Reds and Blacks played a twenty
linutc game. The passing and back
eld work of the I' reshmen was far
I uperior to that of the Varsity and
icy put up a faster and more inter
ring game. The Reds scored one
