###

Bryant street, will be turned over to
Graduate Manager 1). D. Sales for the
purpose of giving n benefit for the
new track fund. Twenty-five cents
admission will be charged and twen
ty-live cents to sftate. Thus the
proceeds will in all probability be
no small sum, and they will be turn
ed entirely into the fund for the new
track.
Should the student body respond
readily enough to this idea there will
probaly be a masquerade ball on
skates on the evening of the benefit.
If it is decided to give this ball a
great deal of interest will be mani
fested outside of University circles,
and in this way the attendance will
be materially increased.
Manager Sales is also planning to
arrange to have the University band
at the rink on the night of the event
and in that way to afford music for
the skaters. The rink will probably
be trimmed in cardinal and the whole
building decorated.
