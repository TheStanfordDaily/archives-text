# FRESHMAN GAMEHERE.
## 1910 INTERCOLLEGIATE SET FOR OCTOBER 13th. First Freshman Game Ever Held at Stanford Will Be Played on Stanford Field. 
### 
The date of the Freshman Inter
collegiate Rugby game has been offi
cially announced as Saturday, Octo
ber 13th. The game will be played
011 Stanford Field in the afternoon,
and the admission will be $1, with
no reserved seats.
The rumor that the Freshman
game would be played upon Califor
nia Field is unfounded. California
has done nothing towards moving
the bleachers on her stadium, and
thus enlarging the arena to the size
properly needed for Rugby, so there
is 110 choice between fields as re
gards adaptability. Last year's
Freshman game was played at Berke
ley, and the 1910 game will be played
here.
From line to line Stanford Field
is sixty-six yards. The Rugby rules
call for "seventy-five yards, or as
near as possible." Consequently
Stanford Field will be a little small,
but no serious trouble in playing is
expected 011 this score. The coming
game will be the first Freshman
game ever played 011 home grounds.
