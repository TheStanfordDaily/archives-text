The ' Daily Palo Alto" wishes to
acknowledge the receipt of a letter
lrom George E. Crothers, secretary
of the Board o.' Trustees, in which
the problem of eating facilities for
students residing on the campus is
discussed in the light of the history
of experiments made since the found
ing of the University.
The writer begins by stating "It
may be wrong to deliberately violate
one of the few local customs, by
answering a protest on the part of
University men relative to any real
or imagined grievance; but 1 am go
ing to do so in connection with the
problem of the Inn,"' Continuing, he
says, "All will agree with j - ou that
"It is a difficult matter to suggest a
solution of this eating problem" and
that "it is imperative that some
change should be made to improve
the present deplorable condition."
You suggest two solutions, provision
for eating clubs upon the campus and
the maintenance of an Inn which
would compare favorably with the
Inns of Cornell and Princeton which
you siijr 'ar- sucre y .uanaged

The inn of Ii award and Prince
lon are characterized by Mr. Croth
ers a-< being too expensive, and he
state - that he know.- of no university
in America which officially under
takes to feed its own students. .Re
garding attempts to do this at Stan

attempt was made at the very begin
