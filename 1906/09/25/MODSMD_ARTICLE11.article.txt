The class of 1907 has entered upon
its Senior year with a deficit in the
treasury, which, although small, de
mands the consideration of the class
members. The publication of an an
nual to replace the destroyed 1907
"Quad" has been undertaken this
sem'eStet*, aiid' next semester the
heavy expense of Commencement
Week must be met. The Senior an
nual will doubtless be self-support
ing, but the financial problem which
Will present itself at graduation will
be no small one. The plan of hold
ing a Senior circUs to raise funds has
many commendable features. A cus
tom which has a firm place in a
number of the Eastern colleges, will
be introduced at Stanford. As a
means of raising money, the scheme
should prove very successful, since
the expense of producing the vari
ous burlesques and side-shows should
be comparatively small, and the re
ceipts will undoubtedly be large.
The Plug Ugly is the nearest ap
proach to a carnival of this sort, but
the two events are so different in
character that there should be 110
room for conflict. Coming in the
first semester, .the Senior circus will
enliven a period heretofore devoid
of attractions, and offset the over
balance of farces and other enter
tainments occuring in the spring
semester.
