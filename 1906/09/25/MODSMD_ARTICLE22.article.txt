The Junior class voted a $4 "Quad"
assessment at a meeting held this
afternoon, which was one of the
stormiest that the class has held in
some time. At a meeting of the
"Quad" board held last night it was
decided that a $5 assessment would
l>c none too small on account of the
lack of advertising material for the
"Quad". However, whett the pro
position of the increased hSsessment
was put before the class fcAnsiderable
opposition developed. After a long
argument an amendment making the
assessment $4 was proposed and car
ried.
