# FRESHMEN TO MEET VARSITY.
## Two Practice Games on Stanford Field To-morrow. 
### 
Tomorrow afternon at 4:30 the
Freshman fifteen will be lined up
against the Varsity for two short
practice halves. The varsity Reds
will meet the Freshmen Blacks and
the Freshman Reds will be pitted
against the varsity Blacks. The
first-year men will be worked hard
this week to get them into shape for
their outside game, against Santa
Cruz on Saturday.
The scrimmage work of the two
varsity squads last night showed a
great improvement over Saturday's
game. The backs 011 both the Red
and Black teams were shifted around
and the change made the scrimmages
faster and more interesting. Neith
er team scored, but the Red backs,
by brilliant running and passing,
twice came dangerously near a try.
The varsity teams will play again
on Saturday afternon after the
contest.
