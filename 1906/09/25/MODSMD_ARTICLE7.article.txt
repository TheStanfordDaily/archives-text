# GOES AROUND WORLD
## DR. CAMPBELL SPENDS YEAR IN RESEARCH. Visits England, Africa, India, and Antipodes on Botanical Investigations. 
### 
Dr. Campbell's round-the-world
trip on which he set out early last
summer proved to be one of excep
tional interest both from the stand
point of travel out of the beaten
tracks but more especially in the
splendid opportunities offered for
scientific research.
The International Botanical Con
ference at Vienna was Dr. Camp
bell's objective point when he sailed
from New York, although he spent
some little time in England en route.
A party of scientists from the Con
ference made an interesting five
weeks trip down into the Austrian
Tyrol and the excursion was pro
ductive of many interesting speci
mens which Dr. Campbell has
brought home,with him.
In July, with the members of the
British Association for the Advance
ment of Science, Dr. Campbell sailed
foi South Africa and attended all
the sessions of that body at Cape
Town and Johannesburg. An inter
esting trip was undertaken to Vic
toria Falls and the party had the op
portunity of being present when the
great railway bridge across the river
was opened.
After a stay of two months in
South Africa Dr. Campbell sailed for
India, reaching Bombay in October.
All the cities of Northern India were
visited and Dr. Campbell express
ed himself as charmed with Agra and
Delhi, although the architecture of
Southern India appealed to him on
the whole more strongly. During
the two months spent in India lit
tle botanizing was done, as this was
left to the more fertile fields of Cey
lon and Java.
A Christmas in Mandalay was one
of the features in Dr. Campbell's
trip and from here he returned to
Ceylon, going up into the mountains
to spend six weeks or more in the
Botanical Garden at Peridinia and
the virgin forests of Kuralia farther
north.
The richest field that the trip af
forded was, however, the wonderful
garden of the Governor of the Dutch
East India possessions at Buitcn
zorg in Java, and here Dr. Campbell
spent three months in the midst of
the most luxuriant vegetation in the
world, where very valuable material
was gathered. This soil is far rich
e" in specimens than even the Gar
dens of Ceylon, being a wetter and
more favorable to tropical vegeta
tion and being free from the objec
tion that Dr. Campbell had to make
of the Ceylon forests, that few of
them were virgin.
While in Java, at) interesting ex
cursion was planned to the Island of
Cracatoa, the eruption of which in
1882 destroyed all vegetation and has
left the island as an interesting field
of investigation to scientists who can
watch here the natural restoration of
vegetation with no artificial agencies
at work.
