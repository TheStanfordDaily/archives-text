# BRIGHT OUTLOOK
## MANY OLD MEN RETURN TO COLLEGE. FRESHMAN CLASS HAS GOOD MATERIAL IN STARS OF INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET. 
### 
Both Trainer Moulton and Cap
tain J. C. Macfarland, '07, are well
pleased with the outlook for a suc
cessful track season at Stanford this
year. Several valuable members of
last year's team have either gradu
ated or will not return to college, but
in spite of these losses the prospects
are unusually bright. Most of last
year's team are now in college and
there have been some strong ad
ditions to the track material in the
entering class. Although it is a lit
tle early to know all the good track
athletes in the Freshman class it is
safe to say that there was never an
entering class at Stanford with more
promising material for development
011 the track than is contained in the
ranks of 1910.
The varsity track men now in col
lege are: Captain J. C. McFarland,
'07, hurdler; W. T. McNeil, '07, sprin
ter; L. M. Edwards, '07, sprinter; C.
F. Elwell, '07, quarter-miler; J. O.
Miller, '08, distance runner; F. R.
Lanagan, '08, pole-vaulter, and R. F.
Koclier, '08, pole vaulter. In addition
to these veterans J. C. Taylor, ex-'o4
has returned to college and will un
doubtedly be seen 011 the track next
spring. He is an old varsity hurdler
and ran a close third to Powell and
Cheek, of California, when they broke
the coast record several years ago.
Taylor runs both the low and high
hurdles and will be a valuable addi
tion to the track team.
Besides these wearers of the var
sity "S" there are a number of ex
cellent athletes in college this se
mester who are expected to take
points in the big meet next semester
who are expected to take points in
the big meet next semester. E. J.
Nash, '07, who was doing fine work
last spring in the mile and two
mile, will be 011 the track again this
semester and will compete with such
distance men as W. C. Shelton, '08,
G. Knupp, '07, C. B. Bradford, '09,
and G. I*. Morell, 09. In the sprints
T. Vandervoort, '08, and J. R. llol
man, '09, arc two men who were de
veloping rapidly last year and should
be valuable to tlic Cardinal next
spring. A. E. Roth, '09, is another
sprinter who will be on the track this
year. In the quarter W. M. Rawles,
'09, was conceded a place last year
and probably would have won the
event in the intercollegiate meet, lie
was also a strong relay runcr and
was broad jumping well. Rawles will
be 011 the track again tliis year. G.
D. ilussey, 09, is another strong can
didate in the quarter and also P. M.
Davis, '08, and C. C. Coonan, '09. C.
L. Severy, '08, is a half-miler who
will be sure to do well 011 the track
this year as he was one of the best
men 011 last year's team. In the
hurdles C. A. Ball, '07, and W. D.
Peaslee, '09. and B. L. Gregg, '09, arc
among last year's team, who will
be out again this season. C. C. Ow-
