Stanford's prospects on track are
exceptionally bright this year. We
have more and better men than ever
before, and are beginning a new track
which, when completed, will be to
track athletics what Stanford Field
is to football. At present the ques
tion in every mind is, when will
work on this new track begin?
Enough money has already been sub
scribed to enable the work to start,
and collectors are at work among
the students. They are handicapped,
however, by the fact that the evi
dences of active construction on the
track have yet been given. The time
to do this work is before the rains
set in, while the days arc yet warm
and dry enough to allow the dirt to
settle properly.
The improvement planned on the
new athletic field will cost a consid
erable sum of money, while the treas
ury of the Associated Students is al
most emptyâ€”a result of t'-e failure
of the expected return ; fron the
intercollegiate trick meet last semes
ter and the third of the series of base
ball games. With the financial re
turns from the Rugby season in
doubt, the safest method of raising
money is to depend on the student
body. Therefore, when admission is
charged to practice Rugby games,
which will be few, there should be
no grumbling on the part of the
students.
