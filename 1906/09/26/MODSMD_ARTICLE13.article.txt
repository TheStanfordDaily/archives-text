# Dr. Snow Pronounces Water Safe.
## 
### 
Dr. W. F. Snow, having received
many inquiries concerning the water
that has been supplied of late along
Lasuen street, has had both a chem
ical and bacteriological examination
made, and stated today that the wa
ter is not dangerous. The disagree
able taste and stench is caused from
the Searsville water, which contains
large qauntities of iron and sulphur
*alts, leaking into the pipes from the
reservoir.
