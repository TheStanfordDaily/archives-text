# "CHAPARRAL" OUT FRIDAY.
## Art Work from New Contributors. Issue is Satirical. 
### 
The third number of the "Chap
arral" will be placed on sale Friday
morning, and will be sold lor fifteen
cents. The issue contains much ex
cellent art work by E. E. Horowitz,
'06, K. E. Snodgrass, '01, and M. J.
Helmick, ex- 09.
The drawing on the iirst page is
by Helmick, and cleverly represents
local football conditions "When Eng
lish Rugby Comes to Stanford." The
art feature of the issue is a girl's head
by Horowitz, which is the best pic
ture that has appeared in the "Chap
arral" this year. It is a clever idea,
and indicates the popularity of the
Guild Hospital.
S. McDonald, '10, is a new artist
who begins contributing with this is
sue. He is represented by an excel
lent football player, called "The New
Football Idol." M. A. Van Deursen,
'10, contributes a characteristic
Freshman picture, which is the iirst
of a series of four drawings.
The text of the issue is extremely
satirical, containing among other
features a column of Roble society
gossip, a phonographic record on
Uncle John's "spiel" to the tourists,
a sarcastic chat with Chappie in the
sanctum, and much excellent verse,
by F. A. Curtin, '08, and E. J. Had
ley, '08.
Editorially the number attacks the
mimicry of the first "Sequoia";
knocks the lack of eating facilities
upon the campus; criticises the ab
sence of the faculty at the recent
graduation exercises, and puts in a
good word for Rugby.
