# FOR TRACK TEAM

en, '09, A. Tomasini, '08, A. B. Cox,
'07, and W. K. Ford, '09, are among
the old candidates who will be in the
weight events again this year. All
these men mentioned are enough to
insure a strong track team. There
are sure to be a large number of men
who did not attract attention last
year but will greatly improve this
season and may win points in the big
meet. This is particularly true of
the distance runners and Trainer
Moulton says he looks for several
surprises in the cases of men who
were underestimated last year and
who will improve wonderfully this
season.
The Freshman track material is
unusually promising. Probably the
two athletes in the entering class who
are best known on account of their
preparatory school reputations are S.
H. Bellah, from Hanford High
School, and W. H. Crowley, of
Throop School in Pasadena. Both
these men have done over eleven
feet in the pole vault and together
with Lanagan and Kocher should
form an invincible quartet of pole
vaulters. Bellah is also a hurdler
and broad jumper of ability and
Crowley has won points in the shot
put in academic meets. H. P. Cheda
from San Luis Obispo, is a Freshman
who should do well in the mile,
judging from his high school record,
and his brother, G. E. Cheda, will
probably be a good man in the
weights. Lee Scott, from Alameda
High School, is one of the best
sprinters in the Freshman class and
should be a varsity possibility. In
the hurdles D. B. Arrell, from Mo
line, Ill., has a good preparatory
school record and should develop
under training. G. Macreadie, from
I liroop school, is a promising half
miler and may also enter the high
jump. G. L. Perry, a distance runner
from Ohio, comes here with a good
reputation and is expected to do well.
There are many other athletes in
the Freshman class who, although
their preparatory school reputations
are not so well-known, are expected
to develop under Trainer Moulton's
care and help win the meet next
spring. Altogether the outlook is
highly encouraging and the opening
year on the new track should be a
winning season for the Cardinal.
