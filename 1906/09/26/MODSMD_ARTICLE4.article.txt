# WOMEN'S BASKET-BALL
## THIRTY-ONE SIGN UP ON PRACTICE SQUAD. Interclass Series Will Begin Soon Intercollegiate Game To Occur Next Semester. 
### 
The first practice of the Women's
Basket-ball squad took place yester
day. Thirty-one have signed up for
the squad and almost all turned out
for practice yesterday. All unusual
number of freshmen have entered,
and there is much promise of good
material for the team, which will not
be formally announced until the in
tercollegiate game with Berkeley, to
take place some time next semester.
There was formerly an intercollegiate
game each semester alternating be
tween the Stanford and Berkeley
athletic grounds, but owing to the
ruling of the University of Califor
nia that the Berkeley team cannot
play off its campus, the games have
been reduced to one, to be played in
the Berkeley grounds during the sec
ond half of the college year.
A plan which will be carried into
execution in two or three weeks is
the reviving of the interclass games
which were in vogue two years ago.
Interclass games with specially chos
en teams will take place at ten
o'clock every Saturday morning.
Later in the semester games will be
played with outside teams from Mills
College, San Mateo, Redwood and
Palo Alto High Schools, and the San
Jose Normal. Miss M. Montcith, '08,
is captain of the basket-ball squad.
