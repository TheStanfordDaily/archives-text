# PLACES FOR ALUMNI
## EMPLOYMENT BUREAU ORGANIZED BY WRIGHT. Secretary of Alumni Association Will Secure Positions for Stanford Graduates. 
### 
A letter is being sent to all Stan
ford alumni by C. F. Wright, '96,
which outlines his plans towards the
organization of the Stanford Employ
ment Bureau. This is a new depar
ture and its results will be of inter
est to graduates of the University.
The letter, which is self-explanatory,
follows:
"Dear Sir: â€”Growing out of my
work as secretary and treasurer of
the Stanford Alumni Association I
have undertaken a movement which
1 think may be made of great and
permanent value to the graduates of
Stanford. This is the organization
of the Stanford Bureau which has
for its purpose the bringing of high
grade men and high-grade positions
together, with special reference to
the graduates of our own Univer
sity.
By listing the desires and the
qualifications of our alumni and by
keeping in touch with the leading
employers of the country it will be
possible for the Stanford Bureau to
place our graduates in the way of
securing desirable openings. The
Bureau is not intended primarily for
the unemployed but rather for the
assistance of those already holding
positions but who wish to secure
promotion and advancement in their
chosen line of work.
"It is to be noted that 110 registra
tion charge of any kind is required.
In view of this fact everyone send
ing in membership blanks is request
ed to file with the Bureau satisfac
tory evidence of his fitness for the
position or positions which he would
like to secure, or to have his refer
ences write letters of recommenda
tion direct to the undersigned. It is
also to be noted that the charge
made by the Bureau after a member
has been successfully placed is but
little more than half of that made
by the several branches of the Hap
good organization, which handles the
same class of work for commercial
and technical men throughout the
Eastern and Middle States.
"The Stanford Bureau will work
in close touch with the University
and its interested departments. With
the co-operation of the different de
partments of the University, and
with the co-operation of the alumni
who are looking for capable em
ployes or who are themselves seek
ing better positions, T feel confident
that tlie Stanford Bureau can be made
of great value to our graduates.
Very sincerely,
C. F. WRIGHT, '96, Manager."
The terms of membership in the
Bureau are set forth in a blank form,
the substance of which follows:
"Upon the acceptance of a position
secured through the Bureau, the
member agrees to pay to the Bureau
a commission of three per cent of
the first year's salary. On a tempo
