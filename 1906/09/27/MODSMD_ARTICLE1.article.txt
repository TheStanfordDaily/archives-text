# VARSITY TEAMS WIN
## REDS DEFEAT FRESHMEN TWENTY-FIVE TO NOTHING. Fast and Interesting Games on Stanford Field.â€”Varsity Blacks Also Victorious. 
### 
The best Rugby that has been seen
on Stanford Field this season was
played last night, when the varsity
iiid Freshman squads met in ,vo
fast and interesting games. Both
varsity teams proved too strong for
their first-year opponents, the Reds
winning easily 25-0 and the Blacks
coming out 011 the long end of a 5-3
score.
The first game between the varsity
Reds and the '10 Blacks was the fast
est of the day. The Freshmen play
ed gritty ball but their scrum and
backs were outclassed by the clever
passing and dribbling of the Varsity.
J.N. Stanford fell 011 a dribbled ball for
the first try after seven minutes of
play and Fenton kicked the goal.
The second score came later in t he
half, Holman scoring after a brilliant
t.venty yard run. Fenton kicked a
very difficult goal. Early in the. sec
ond half Holman again scored on a
poor kick by the Freshman full, Fen
ton kicking the third goal. Stoti
scored the fourth try on clever pass
ing and Pemberton went over the
line for the final score after a twentv
five yard run from Chalmers kick
The work of the Reds showed a
wonderful improvement over Satur
day's game. There was less forward
passing and running with the ball,
and more of the clever punting and
spectacular runs which make the ex
citement in the new game. Fenton,
Hussey and Holman were the stars
in the backfield and all the men in
the scrum played god ball. Little
and Wort bin gton did good work for
the Freshmen.
The second game was slower and
less exciting. The Freshmen scored
early when Cook fell on a blocked
kick but failed to kick the goal. The
Blacks tied them a moment later
when Laumeister picked the ball
from a scrum on the Freshman ten
yard line and touched it down be
tween the goal posts. Macdonald won
the game with an easy goal. Lau
meister, Cole and Cook showed up
well, but neither team played as fast
or spectacular a game as the first
contest.
Douglas Erskine, the well-known
football expert, viewed the games and
expressed himself as very much
pleased at the way in which the squad
has taken hold of the new game. He
was especially impressed with the
work of the varsity Reds and praised
their speed and aggressiveness very
highly.
Assistant Coach Bansbach refereed
both games and J. R. Hickcy, '08, act
ed as timekeeper.
