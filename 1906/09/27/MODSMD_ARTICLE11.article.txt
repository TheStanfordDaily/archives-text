# TRUSTEES MEET TO-MORROW.
## Board Will Probably Discuss Questions of Interest. 
### 
The regular meeting of the Board
of University Trustees will be held
in San Francisco tomorrow afternoon
at one o'clock. Besides the routine
business to be transacted the board
will in all probability consider several
matters of great interest to the Stan
ford student body. Encina control,
the eating situation on the campus
and the report of the Commission of
Engineers on the progress of the re
pairs on the University buildings will
probably all be considered at tomor
row's meeting. Just what recom
mendations, if any, the Board will
make with regard to the first two
problems, is impossible to forecast.
The subject of control in the Hall
has been so long discussed and is in
such a peculiar situation that it is
highly improbable that anything defi
nite will be done.
