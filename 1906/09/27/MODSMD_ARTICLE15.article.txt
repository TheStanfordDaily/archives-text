At a recent Rugby practice at the
University of California two men,
one a prominent alumnus and the
other a varsity coach, attacked the
lack of enthusiasm of the Berkeley
rooters. One of these men, in his
plea for a little noise to encourage
the players, paid a strong tribute to
the spirit which the Stanford men
were showing in the support of their
players and the new game. He de
clared that Stanford students were
back of their teams to a man and
that the enthusiasm on our bleachers
would be a revelation to the Blue
and Gold supporters.
We hope that this gentleman was
not, by any chance, at the Varsity
l'reshman game yesterday. Had he
been present, he might have reversed
his opinion. Nothing less than a
thirty yard run produced any enthus
iasm on the bleachers and the songs
were rung in a dreary monotone
which was painful. Indifference on
the part of the rooters is not exactly
encouraging nor does it augur well
for a winning team, but it is much
less of an evil than a tendency to
make fun of the efforts of the players,
which appears to lie undiminished.
The players themselves admit that
the laughter which comes from the
bleachers after each attempted play
both irritates and makes them nerv
ous. The men on the held are doing
the hardest kind of work in order
that the varsity fifteen may be vic
torious this fall, and at least they
deserve to have their efforts treated
with respect.
