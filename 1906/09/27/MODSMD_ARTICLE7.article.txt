# AUTHORIZED TO ACT
## TRAINING HOUSE CORPORATION TO COMPLETE TRACK. Executive Committee Arranges for Try-outs for Assistant Yell Leaders. 
### 
Most important in the business
transacted by the Executive Commit
tee at its regular weekly meeting last
night was the authorization given to
the Training House Corporation to
proceed at once in finishing the work
on the new track. With this permis
sion, the Corporation will at once un
dertake the necessary curbing and
surfacing and push it to a speedy
completion. It is estimated that by
putting a reasonable force of men at
work, the Corporation can make the
track ready for use before the end
of the present semester.
Previous to the grant of this sanc
tion the question of changing the re
spective representations of the fa
culty and alumni on the newly con
stituted Board of Control had stayed
the prosecution of work on the oval
For it was uncertain whether the
Board of Control, as established b>
the amendments to the constitution
of the Asociated Students passed at
the last student body election, had
legally succeeded to the powers of
the older Training House Corpora
tion. The Board is composed of the
chairman of the Faculty Athletic
Committee, two alumni members up
pointed by the Executive Committee,
and the following officers of the As
sociated Students: the President,
Vice-president, Secretary and Gradu
ate Manager.
The Training House Corporation, ex
pressing its views through Dr. F. An
gell, chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee and a leading mem
ber of the Training House Corpoia
tion. claims that the organization of
the new Board does not admit of con â€¢
tinuity of membership sufficient to
uphold the responsibilities which it
proposes to undertake. Hence Dr.
Angell argues that the number of
alumni members of the Board should
be lessened from two to one, and
that the faculty should be represent
ed 011 the Board by two members
elected by the Executive Committee.
The matter of the authority of the
Board of Control was to have been
decided last night, but was laid over
011 account of the unavoidable ab
sence of Graduate Manager D. D.
Sales, '06, from the campus.
The Executive Committee voted to
Veil-leader R. S. Kellogg, '07, tho
power of holding try-outs to fill the
vacancies in the two positions of
assistant yell-leader. Previous to
this year, the function of holding s'u .>
contests has been exercised by the
Executive Committee.
