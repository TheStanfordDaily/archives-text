THEN ANO NOW
In the good old days of the tallow
candle the Bible and the almanac
comprised most of the reading mat
ter in many homes. But just think
of the many books, papers and maga
zines nowadays, and tlien you wonder
why so many eyes give out and so
many people have to wear glasses?
'Tisent work, but overwork, that |
kills. These are strenuous times in |
which we're living and if you feel
your eyes giving out under the strain,
remember we stand ready to help
them to bear the burden with the
best glasses that modern science and
skill can supply.
