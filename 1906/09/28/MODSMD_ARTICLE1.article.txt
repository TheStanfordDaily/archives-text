# TO MEET SANTA CRUZ
## FRESHMEN WILL PLAY RUGBY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Fast English Team Will Meet First Year Men in Second Preliminary Game. 
### 
The first Rugby game of the season
against an outside fifteen will be play
ed tomorrow on Stanford Field, when
the Freshmen line up against the
team from Santa Cruz. The first
year men have been playing good
ball this week and should give the
visitors a good game. Santa Cruz is
practically an unknown quantity.
Manager Sales has received no defi
nite line-up from them and the per
sonnel of their team cannot be an
nounced tonight.
There is a large colony of English
men in Santa Cruz, however, and
they should be able to get together
, a fast team with a good knowledge
of the game.
The Freshman team is the strong
est that has been played together
this season. The best men on the
Red and Black teams have been
picked, and the 1910 aggregation will
more than make up in individual
speed and brilliance what it lacks in
team work. Tomorrow's game will
give the bleachers a good line on the
Freshman material and will be the
first opportunity this season to see
any but a Stanford Rugby team in
action. The intercollegiate first-year
contest is only two weeks away and
there is very little time for the Fresh
men to get in any practice games
with visiting teams. Tomorrow's
contest is the most important pre
liminary game that has been sched
uled thus far.
Following the Santa Cruz contest
the varsity Reds and Blacks will
play. There was a considerable
shake-up last night in the Red back
field. Laumeister was taken on as
half. Stott went to five and Chalmers
to center, replacing Owen, who was
played as half on the Blacks. There
was no scrimmage at last night's
practice but the men were given a
thorough drilling in the rudiments of
the game.
The line-up of the Freshman team
which will meet the Santa Cru:-; fif
teen tomorrow follows:
Forwards—G. Cheda, Fitting, Win
ter, Hine, Reynolds, Thorpe, Worih
ington and George.
Wing forwards—Myer and Pcmber
ton.
TTalf—Little and Weaver.
Five—Meredith.
Centers—Mitchell and Jordan.
Wings—Cook and De Bolt.
Full—F. Faulkner.
