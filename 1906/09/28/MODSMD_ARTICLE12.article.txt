Jt is very necessary to the rowing
interests of Stanford that Coach Mur
phy be re-engaged for the coming
season. No ends should be spared
to secure his services, which means
a great deal to the future of boating,
Last year lie trained the squad from
which came the men who astonished
the Eastern crews by their excellent
showing. Should he return to re
sume his coaching, there is no doubt
that a better crew than has ever be
fore rowed for Stanford will be turn
ed out to meet California next spring,
and there is a possibility that a Stan
ford crew may be sent against the
Eastern universities Murphy ranks
as one of the finest coaches in Ameri
ca, and had several opportunities to
coach at universities where boating is
much further advanced than here,
but is holding out in the hope that
Stanford will desire his services.
With the excellent beginning made
last year and the great possibilities
at hand there is but one course open
for the boating men, the retention of
Coach Murphy. The efforts of the
men interested in boating to recure
his return should be supported in
every way possible by the student
body.
