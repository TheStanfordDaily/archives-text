A good system of student control
for Encina Hall was proposed and
discussed last evening by the students
in the dormitory, which we hope the
authorities will recognize as the real
solution of all their troubles. The
proctor system must be regarded as a
failure if only because of the fact that
no one seems particularly anxious to
accept free room rent, with the sti
pulation that he watch his fellow
students, attached to tlie gift. It i>
now 110 more than fair that the En
cina men themselves should be giv
en a chance to see what success they
will have with a plan of their own.
