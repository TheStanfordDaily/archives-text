# ASSISTANT LEADERS TRY-OUT.
## Each Aspirant to Lead Yelling One Day at Bleachers. 
### 
Yell-leader R. S. Kellogg, '07, has
announced the beginning of the com
petition for the position of assistant
leader.
The plan this year is slightly
changed from the previous method
and it is expected that more satis
factory results will be obtained than
heretofore.
Every candidate for the position
will be required to hand in his name
to yell-leader Kellogg immediately
and will then have one afternoon as
signed to him, when it will be his
duty to conduct the yells at the regu
lar practice. This will afford every
aspirant a chance to show what he
can do and the best man will be sure
of securing the honor through the de
cision of the Executive Committee.
The afternoons of next week will be
used for the competition.
On October sth, the prize compe
tition for yells and songs will close.
Words written to music which has
stability will receive a vote over that
written to popular music of the day.
The yells and songs which receive
first and second prizes will be kept
in secret for the varsity game and
the remaining good ones will be used
for the Freshman game.
