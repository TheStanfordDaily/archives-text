# CLUB IS ORGANIZED
## CONSTITUTION ADOPTED BY SOCIAL SERVICE CLUB. New Body Plans To Establish Stanford Settlement in San Francisco. 
### 
At the meeting of the Social Ser
vice Club last night a constitution
was adopted and definite organiza
tion accomplished. The future plans
of the club were also discussed and
the ideals and policy outlined.
The preamble to the newly adopt
ed constitution, which tells of the
ideas in the minds of the founders
in the formation of the club, follows:
"Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, a monument of paternal love,
stands unique among the world's
great institutions of learning. Dedi
cated to the services of humanity it
strives to become the ideal Univer
sity for the training of the ideal man
and womanâ€”a university in which the
development of character shall be as
important as the development of in
tellect. With its magnificent inde
pendence financially, politically, and
religiously, and with its commanding
position in the centre of a new civi
lization, it is prepared to foster the
spirit of unselfish service in the
world, and to make the ideals of its
founders living in potent realities in
its own life."
The objects of the Social Service
Club are set forth thus:
"The objects of this association
shall be, first, to foster in the life of
the University the ideals of social
service; second, to study social prob
lems, social betterment, social set
tlements, and political science; and,
third, to establish in San Francisco a
Stanford University settlement, and
other centres there and elsewhere for
social work."
The membership of the club, ex
clusive of honorary members, is at
present limited to one hundred. This
number may be increased upon the
appearance in the social service field
of enough eligible members. New
members are elected by the executive
committee of the club. Members of
the faculty, students and alumni of
the University who show an active in
terest in social service are- eligible.
An important factor in the adminis
tration of the club will be an Ad
visory Board, made up of the Chap
lain of the University as chairman,
the president of the University, the
president of the Social Service Club,
and two elected members of the
club.
Numerous open meetings of the
club will be held, but the club "shall
never became an instrument of any
social, religious, or political organiza
tion, but shall always maintain an un
partisan and independent attitude to
ward all social, religious, and politi
cal bodies or movements."
The dues of the club arc fifty cents
a semester; the initiation fee is also
fifty cents.
An election of officers for the club
was held last evening and resulted
in the present administration being
re-elected, with the addition of W. F.
Lyons, '07, as vice-president. Talks

of great interest were made before
the club by Charles Gardner,
Professors A. H. Suzzallo, R. L,
Green, and G. H. Marx, and Presi
dent Walter Y. Wentz, '06.
