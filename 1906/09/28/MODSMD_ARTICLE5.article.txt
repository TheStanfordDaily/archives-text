# MURPHY MAY RETURN
## BOATING MEN START FUND TO RETAIN COACH. Oarsmen Who Trained Last Year's Crews Wishes To Coach at Stanford. 
### 
Every student present at a meet
ing of men interested in boating this
afternoon pledged himself to obtain
at least a dollar a month toward a
fund which is to be devoted to bring
ing Coach "Dan" Murphy back to
Stanford. Murphy's reputation as a
boating coach is such that several
colleges have made flattering offers
to Stanford's coach. Murphy is anx
ious to come to Stanford, but the Ex
ecutive Committee, because of the
many expenses of the Student Body
this year, will not authorize Graduate
Manager Sales to pay him the salary
offered by Eastern universities.
The boating men intend that
Murphy shall coach, however, and
the fund which they have pledged
themselves to raise is to be devoted
to paying the amount of his salary
which is not covered by the Execu
tive Committee's appropriation.
Captain F. Zimmerman, '07, has ap
pointed the following committee to
receive the names of any additional
men who will help raise the neces
sary money; D. R. Gardner, '07, R.
H. Conant, '08, . R. Pemberton, '08,
L. R. Gay, '08, F. W. Turner, '08,
A. B. Shutts, '09.
Zimmerman telegraphed to Murphy
this afternoon asking him to keep his
offer open a little longer, and that a
fund to raise the necessary amount
had been started.
