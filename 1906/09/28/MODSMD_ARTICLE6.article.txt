### 
Yesterday the work of finishing
the new track was begun. The sur
veyors are making their final survey
of the track and the work of prepar
ing to construct the curbing is al
ready under way. The outlook is
highly encouraging at present and it
seems certain that if there is 110 1111-
forseen interruption the new track
will be putin good condition before
the rainy season begins. At present
there are four men at work and as
soon as possble more workmen will
be placed on the job as it is important
to rush the work during the present
good weather.
