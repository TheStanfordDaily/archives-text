# NEW PLAN OF CONTROL
## ENCINA MEN DISCUSS SYSTEM FOR DICIPLINE OF HALL. Entire Control Is To Be In Hands of House Committee of Upperclassmen. 
### 
A new plan for a system of stu
dent control in Encina Hall was
discussed by the members of Encina
Club last evening. Under this plan,
the entire control of the affairs of the
dormitory will be in the hands of
a committee of upperclassmen, known
as the house committee. This body is
to be elected by the Sophomore, jun
ior and Senior men, the Freshmen
having no vote in its selection.
The committee will have full au
thority but will be bound by no set
of rules to govern its action, its dis
ciplinary acts being governed by its
own discretion. The test in all cases
before the committee is to be wheth
er the student charged acted in a
gentlemanly manner. The committee,
in cases where actual dismissal from
the hall is necessary, will go to the
offender in a quiet way, and in no
cases will the student be brought be
fore the committee or expelled in a
public manner.
This idea was thoroughly discussed
but no definite action was taken.
The question of having two or three
informal dances to take the place of
the present semi-annual at home was
also brought up and probably will be
adopted if the authorities are willing.
