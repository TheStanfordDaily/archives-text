# LOSE TO SANTA CRUZ
## FRESHMEN DEFEATED BY PENALTY KICK. Varsity Reds Show Splendid Form in Game with Third Team. 
### 
The Freshmen lost Saturday's game
to Santa Cruz by the narrow margin
of 3 points. Two minutes after play
Davis made a penalty drop kick from
the forty yard line, and the ball sailed
squarely between the goal posts.
Davis was easily the star of both
teams in spite of his years, and he
showed that his early training 011
some of the best teams of England
and Wales had not been forgotten.
Dake and Mead also did excellent
work for the visitors. In the scrums
the weight of the Freshmen gave
them the advantage, but in the other
departments of the game the Santa
Cruz players were clearly superior.
At times the Freshmen played list
lessly and many times they lost
ground through sheer carelessness.
They also showed a tendency to ne
glect to follow the ball.
After scoring the Santa Cruz team
was content to remain 011 the defen
sive, and the Freshmen made desper
ate, but futile efforts to score. Short
ly after the drop kick Davis broke
through the scrum for a thirty yard
run, and a moment later 1910 rushed
the ball back twenty-five yards only
to lose it to Dake, who skirted the
wing for thirty yards. Short gains
were then made by both sides and
the first half ended with tha ball
well within 1910's territory.
Several times in the second half
the Freshmen were on the point of
scoring but Santa Cruz rallied each
time and saved its menaced goal line.
The startling feature of the second
half was the long run of Faulkner,
who successfully hurdled two of
the Santa Cruz players before he was
finally tackled.
