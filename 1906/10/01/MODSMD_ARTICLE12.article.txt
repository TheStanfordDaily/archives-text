to reduce the labor bill to a minimum.
The rigidity of the structure was
demonstrated immediately after the
"big game" of last November when
the students rushed down the seats
and over the balustrade to get on the
field. Under this test ihe vibration
of the structure was not noticeable.
In closing this report it is fitting
that some mention should be made of
the former students of this Univer
sity who were originally identified
with the Training House movement.
The first to discuss the project ser
iously was T. T. C. Gregory, 'gg; the
scheme was further advanced by For
rest Fisher, '90, who suggested and
brought into effect the plan of Sen
ior class contributions. The project
was finally placed on a sound busi
ness basis through the thoughtful
ness and foresight of H. H. Taylor,
J. K. McDowell, B. J. Gildersleeve
and Theodore lloover, the original
directors of the corporation, for
whose efforts in promiting University
sport, all Stanford men should feel
grateful.
Very sincerely yours,
FRANK ANGELL.
