# LAKE MAY NOT BE FILLED
## Unless a New Flume Is Built Lagunita Will Be Dry Next Spring. 
### 
Unless the Board of Trustees sees
fit to appropriate money for a new
flume, there is a strong probability
that Lagunita will remain dry next
spring. The old flume has fallen to
pieces in many places and is almost
beyond repair. Whether the Board
will care to spend six or seven thous
and dollars to build a permanent
flume is a question which is causing
some talk, especially among the row
ing men.
The flume which supplies the lake
is about fifteen years old, having
been built by Senator Stanford. It
did good service up to several seasons
ago when it began to leak. Last sea
son it had to be continually repaired
and was a constant source of annoy
ance. Sometime ago estimates for
a new flume were secured, and it was
found that it would cost between
$6000 and $7000, and to construct a
temporary "V" flume would cost in
the neighborhood of $3000. It is un
likely that the Trustees will put up a
temporary structure, and it is a ques
tion whether with all the additional
expense they have been put to on
account of the earthquake, they would
be willing to build a new flume.
Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop is
anxious to see the lake filled next
spring, but he has 110 authority to
build the flume or the money to ex
pend, unless the Board of Trustees
take some action in the matter.
