# TRUSTEES PROMOTE PROFESSORS AND CONSIDER ENCINA AFFAIRS
## NEWCOMER AND WHITAKER GO UP.— IMPROVEMENTS IN MEN'S DORMITORY SANCTIONED AT MEETING FRIDAY. 
### 
At the regular meeting of the Board
of Trustees, held in San Francisco
Friday afternoon, many matters of
interest to the Student Body were
considered, principal among which is
the decision reached in regard to mat
ters concerning Encina Hall. The
question of the number and character
of the entertainments to he given by
Encina Club has been turned over to
President Jordan and the Committee
on Student Affairs and it now lie*
with the University authorities to say
how many dances can be held in the
dormitory. The matter of installing
shower baths in the Hall was ap
proved by the trustees and referred
to Treasurer Lathrop with power to
act. Aside from the action on stu
dent matters several important
changes in the personnel of the fa
culty were made.
Professor A. G. Newcomer has
been promoted from his former posi
tion as associate professor to a full
professorship at the head of the Eng
lish department. Assistant Professor
A. C. Whitaker was moved up to As
sociate Professor of Economics.
The action of the Board in taking
up the matter regarding Encina Hall
was slightly out of order, as all such
affairs have been turned over to Pres
ident Jordan, but special stress was
laid upon the matter of allowing more
than the fixed number of dances in
the dormitory, as an expressed wish
of Mrs. Stanford stands on file in the
books of the trustees touching upon
this point. It is highly probable than
the desires of Encina Club will meet
with co-operation on the part of the
President and the Student Affairs
Committee.
The Board considered the invita
tion issued by the women of Roble
Hall in which the use of the parlors
of the Hall are offered to the Wom
ans's League for its monthly meet
ings.
The matter was referred to Presi
dent Jordan and the Committee 011
Student Affairs.
The eating question was one of the
topics presented at the President's
Conference which callcd for action
upon the part of the Trustees. In re

gard to the improvement of present
facilities little was done as at present
an application is before the Board
for the lease of the Inn. This was re
ferred to the finance committee of
the Board of Trustees for action.
Chairman Leon Sloss of this commit
tee is empowered to act and condi
tions will probably be bettered in the
near future. The name of the appli
cant is kept secret by the committee
upon the request of the lessee, who
does not wish his name to appear
should his offer be refused. Several
other problems concerning the fi
nances of the University were pre
sented and referred to this sub-com
mittee.
The Trustees offered to build
houses upon the campus as requested
by certain members of the faculty.
The homes will be built by the Uni
versity and rented to the applicants
for ten per cent of the actual cost of
construction. The plans and speci
fications together with the locations
must be-approved by the Board.
The list of student assistants was
confirmed as presented. The list by

At the regular meeting of the Board
of Trustees, held in San Francisco
Friday afternoon, many matters of
interest to the Student Body were
considered, principal among which is
the decision reached in regard to mat
ters concerning Encina Hall. The
question of the number and character
of the entertainments to he given by
Encina Club has been turned over to
President Jordan and the Committee
on Student Affairs and it now lie*
with the University authorities to say
how many dances can be held in the
dormitory. The matter of installing
shower baths in the Hall was ap
proved by the trustees and referred
to Treasurer Lathrop with power to
act. Aside from the action on stu
dent matters several important
changes in the personnel of the fa
culty were made.
Professor A. G. Newcomer has
been promoted from his former posi
tion as associate professor to a full
professorship at the head of the Eng
lish department. Assistant Professor
A. C. Whitaker was moved up to As
sociate Professor of Economics.
The action of the Board in taking
up the matter regarding Encina Hall
was slightly out of order, as all such
affairs have been turned over to Pres
ident Jordan, but special stress was
laid upon the matter of allowing more
than the fixed number of dances in
the dormitory, as an expressed wish
of Mrs. Stanford stands on file in the
books of the trustees touching upon
this point. It is highly probable than
the desires of Encina Club will meet
with co-operation on the part of the
President and the Student Affairs
Committee.
The Board considered the invita
tion issued by the women of Roble
Hall in which the use of the parlors
of the Hall are offered to the Wom
ans's League for its monthly meet
ings.
The matter was referred to Presi
dent Jordan and the Committee 011
Student Affairs.
The eating question was one of the
topics presented at the President's
Conference which callcd for action
upon the part of the Trustees. In re

gard to the improvement of present
facilities little was done as at present
an application is before the Board
for the lease of the Inn. This was re
ferred to the finance committee of
the Board of Trustees for action.
Chairman Leon Sloss of this commit
tee is empowered to act and condi
tions will probably be bettered in the
near future. The name of the appli
cant is kept secret by the committee
upon the request of the lessee, who
does not wish his name to appear
should his offer be refused. Several
other problems concerning the fi
nances of the University were pre
sented and referred to this sub-com
mittee.
The Trustees offered to build
houses upon the campus as requested
by certain members of the faculty.
The homes will be built by the Uni
versity and rented to the applicants
for ten per cent of the actual cost of
construction. The plans and speci
fications together with the locations
must be-approved by the Board.
The list of student assistants was
confirmed as presented. The list by
cicpartments follow
