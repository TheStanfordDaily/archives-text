### 
Dr. Frank Angell, secretary of the
Training House Corporation, has sub
mitted his final report of the finances
of that organization. The report
shows that the corporation has now
an excess liability of $2279.45. This
amount is secured by a note to the
Bank of Palo Alto, endorsed by J. E.
McDowell, C. B. Wing and F. An
gell.
The last report of the secretary
was made May 6, 1905, and at that
time the Training House Corpora
tion had assets to the amount of
$8806.92 with 110 liabilities. The re
ceipts form this date to May 10, 1906
were $9122.83, including a loan from
the Bank of Palo Alto of $3000. This
amount increased the total funds
available for the building of the new
athletic fields to $17,929.75.
Money was gradually expended
upon the new stadium and the train
ing house until of this sum but $416.55
remained. The lumber for the new
bleachers cost $5990.00 and for the
training house $900.00. The payments
on the contracts for the building of
these structures came to $6402.00.
The painting cost $414.60, and the
insurance for three years amounted to
$250.00. A payment of $700 was
made on the note held by the Bank
of Palo Alto, and this leaves the cor
poration in the financial condition
stated above; which in detail is as
follows:
ASSETS.
Balance in Bank of Palo
Alto $ 416.55
Final payment 011 interest .. 44 00
Total $ 460.55
LIABILITIES.
Note to Bank of Palo Alto $ 2,300.00
Interest on note at 7 pet 65.00
Due 011 grading for track
(about) 325.00
Outlay for care of bleachers
and fields (about) 50.00
Total $2,740.00
Excess liabilities $2,279.45
Secretary Angell in his report gives
some interesting facts and figures
concerning the new Stanford Field,
and also a short resume of the move
ment toward the forming of the
Training House Corporation:. He
pays:
"Contractor Bean's bid for material
and latior for bleachers and Tr;i n
ing House was $13,452.00, and
for the Training House alone
$2,740.00. Consequently, the cost of
the bleachers alone was $10,712 dol
lars which amounts to about 70 cents
a seat.
The seats are higher and the space
assigned 1 > each spectator is larger
than is the ease with any bleachers
which have come under my observa
tion. That such results should have
been gotten at so low a cost, is. of
course, dut to the great care taken
by the designer, Prof. C. B. Wing,
