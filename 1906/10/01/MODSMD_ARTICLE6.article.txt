Although the Freshmen lost to the
more experienced players from Santa
Cruz at Rugby Saturday, there were
many points of the new game in
which spectators who know the plays
pronounced the 1910 team superior to
their opponents. The intercollegiate
match between the Freshman teams
of Stanford and California is scarcely
two weeks away and Saturday's game
demonstrated that the team which
will represent the Cardinal will give
a good account of itself. But it was
in the contest between the two var
sity squads that the greatest revela
tions were made. The Reds played
like veterans. Their excellent work
was very favorably commented on
by Professor David, of the University
of Sydney, who was 011 the bleachers
and expressed himself as very well
pleased with the showing made. This
unexpected aptitude for the new game
is very pleasing to the student body,
and will do much toward strengthen
ing the growing enthusiasm for
Rugby.
