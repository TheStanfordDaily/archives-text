# TEAMS SHOW PROGRESS
## SCRIMMAGE WORK LAST NIGHT IS FAST AND EXCITING. Freshmen Play Better Than When Against Santa Cruz.â€”Varsity Reds Score Three Tries. 
### 
The Freshman and varsity Blacks
and Reds were lined up last night
for one of the fastest practice scrim
mages of the season. The first year
men showed a great improvement
over their work against Santa Cruz.
The passing was better and the backs
handled the dribbling faster and more
cleanly, j. ne Blacks scored a try 011
a brilliant play by Little, who picked
the ball out of a scrum on the twenty
yard line, feinted a pass and then car
ried the ball up to the five-yard line.
From there it was an easy matter for
Cook to carry the ball over for a
try. The angle was difficult and Lit
tle missed the goal. Faulkner again
played a star game at full.
The varsity Reds again demon
strated their efficiency as a scoring
machine carrying the ball over the
Black's line for three tries. The
Blacks fought hard but the rapid at
tack of the Red backs and the su
periority of the Red scrum wore them
down. The first score was made by
Fenton on clever passing along the
line of backs. The second came a
few moments later when Ivoerner fell
011 a blocked kick. Fast passing by
Stott and Hussey to Macfarland
brought the third try shortly before
the whistle ended the fifteen minutes
of play. The chief fault of the Reds
last night lay in their tendency to
work the ball so far out to the wings
that all of the trys were scored al
most against the sidelines, making
the three goals impossible for Fen
ton.
There was another considerable
shake-up in the personnel of the
varsity teams last night. Laumeister
and Owen were switched, the former
going to half on the Blacks and the
latter playing the same position on
the Red fifteen. Wallace was shifted
from the Blacks replacing Minturn
in the Red scrum. Terrill and Gar
lias were promoted from the third
team, the former at five and the lat
ter at center, Vail going to the other
center in place of Severy. Both Gar
fias and Minturn were temporarily
out of the scrimmage last night, the
former with a badly bruised foot and
the latter with a weak ankle. The
same teams will probably be lined up
for scrimmage work every night this
week and especial attention will be
paid to the Freshmen to get them
into shape for the intercollegiate
game, one week from next Saturday.
