# TRACK BEING CURBED
## TRAINING HOUSE CORPORATION SUPERVISING WORK. Stanford May Not Enter P.A.A. Meet This Month.â€”Fall Training Continues. 
### 
The work of curbing the new track
and putting it into proper condition
is being carried on slowly. It is diffi
cult to obtain men for the work and
the management has had trouble se
curing the lumber. Consequently
progress lias been slower than was
anticipated, but the work will be
rushed as rapidly as possible. It is
probable that the new track will be
available for late fall training.
Contrary to first expectations, no
contracts will be let, but all work will
be carried 011 directly and actively
superintended by the Training House
Corporation. It has been estimated,
from bids received for work neces
sary to complete the new track, that
the I raining House Corporation can
do the work much cheaper.
The regular fall track meet held
under the auspices of the Pacific
Athletic Association is scheduled to
take place 011 Saturday, October 27th.
At present it does not seem probable
tli.it any of the Stanfoid track men
will enter this meet. Many of the
best track men are out lor Rugby at
present and those who arc not play
ing loot ball have hardly iiad sufficient
turning to enter the P. .A. A. meet.
However, there is a possibility of
one or two Stanford entries. J. O.
Miller, 08, the well-known miler, will
enter this meet if lie can get into
satisfactory condition before the re
quired date.
ball training is being carried 011 as
well as possible under the present
conditions. Some of the men are
working on the old track while others
do their running 011 the new foot
ball field. I bis makes it difficult for
Trainer Moulton to watch all his
men but lie says he is very well
pleased with his new material.
