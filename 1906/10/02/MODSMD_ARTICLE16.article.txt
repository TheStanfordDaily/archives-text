\Ye wish to call attention to the
fact that the song and yell contest
will close on Friday, and urge that
every student who has any ability
whatever in writing songs or yells
submit his effort to the yell com
mittee. Thus far very few yells or
songs have been turned in, a fact
that reflects no credit on the mem
bers of the student body It is a suf
ficiently bad state of affairs when it
becomes necessary to offer monej
prizes as an inducement for students
to help the college spirit along, but
when even this means fails to bring
out a response there reason to
question the sincerity of their loyal
ty to the University. If but one
third of the students of Stanford were
to compose songs or yj'ls, and there
is no reason why a much larger num
ber should not do so, it would be an
easy matter for the committee to se
lect a production worthy of the com
bined effort. Stanford has brought
forth almost no enduring songs or
yells since the early days. Of the
beginning new era and the renewal
of the spirit of loyalty, there could
be no more fitting comemmoration
than a song that should take its place
along with the classics written in the
old days.
