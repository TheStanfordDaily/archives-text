# Phonograph Method in French.
## 
### 
The French department has added
to its equipment an Edison Repeating
Phonograph for use in teaching cor
rect pronunciation in the elementary
classes.
It is the intention of the depart
ment to supplement the regular class
work with individual work 011 the
phonograph, where the student may
hear correct French, spoken at any
speed to suit his ability and repeated
until it is perfectly mastered.
The records now in use are those
of the language course of the Inter
national Correspondence Schools, but
new records are on the way from
Paris which will give the pronuncia
tion of the Parisian stage.
