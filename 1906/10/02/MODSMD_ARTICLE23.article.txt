Editor "Daily Palo Alto": â€”I beg
leave to say a few words in your col
umns about a matter which used to
be, and 1 think should be still of po
tent interest to uppcrclass men. 1 re
fer to the wearing of lea!her cuffs on
corduroys.
I have noticed during the past year
and a half a tendency to break away
from the good old tradition which
ruled that only Seniors were eligible
to wear leather cuffs on their cordu
roys. Last year I saw but one man
breaking the tradition, and as he was
of the perpetual Freshman type, ev
eryone quite expected it of him.
This year, it is evident from the num
ber of corduroys with leather cuffs,
that a few of our Junior-, are ignorant
of the fact that there used to be a
tradition in this regard.
The grandest thing about Stanford
is its traditions, and it is with re
gret that we are seeing one of the
customs of the "old boys" cast aside.
Let us all pull together and set the
custom up again as a live tradition.
A STANFORD MAN.
