A letter has just been received at
the President's office f-om Bristow
Adams, '01, secretary of the Stanford
Restoration Fund, urging further
subscriptions from all Stanford alum
ni or former students.
The fund has been growing with
promising rapidity and it is possible
that the object which the Alumni
Committee have had in mind, the re
building of the Arch, wi'l be set aside
for the time being and the more
pressing restoration of ihe facade of
Memorial Church undertaken. If this
is done it will be in accordance with
the feeling expressed by Dr. Jordan
and others that a more modest un
dertaking than the rebuilding of the
Arch, the cost of which could run up
probably over a hundred thousand
dollars, be undertaken by the alumni.
Adams has expressed his desire to
meet Dr. Jordan's suggestion in this
respect and the fund will in all proba
bility be turned over to the Trustees
to be administered by ihem as they
think best.
