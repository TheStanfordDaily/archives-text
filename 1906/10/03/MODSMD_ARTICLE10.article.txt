In another column of this issue of
the"Daily Palo Alto" will be found
an account of the method of playing
the Rugby game, and an explanation
of some of the more important rules.
The English game is not generally
understood by those who have fol
lowed the American game in its ca
reer as an intercollegiate sport, and
as there is little opportunity to be
come familiar with the new game
through observing its practice, we
hope that the article published will be
of service in enlightening the spec
tator as to the peculiarities of Rugby.
