# Duniway's New Book Praised.
## 
### 
The latest number of "The Nation"
contains a highly favorable review of
Prof. C. A. Duniway's recently pub
lished book, "The Development of
Freedom of the Press in Massachu
setts." In the course of an unusually
long treatment there appears this tri
bute: "It is much more than the
history of the development of a free
press in Massachusetts. Either in the
text or in the footnotes there is
found the history of a free press in
the United States. Dr. Duniway
comes nearer than any other writer
to being the historian of the free
press in the Anglo-Saxon world."
