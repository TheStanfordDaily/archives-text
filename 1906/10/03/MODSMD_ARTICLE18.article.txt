# University Postoffice Growing.
## 
### 
The growth of the University
post-office is shown by the fact that
there has been an increase of $700
in the gross receipts of the year end
ing March 1, 1906, over
those for the year ending
March 1, 1905. It has become neces
sary to employ an additional assistant
in order to handle the large distribu
tion of mail.

siring to take the examination should
