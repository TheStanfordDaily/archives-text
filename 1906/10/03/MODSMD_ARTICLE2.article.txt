# PRACTICE CONTINUES FAST.
## Chalmers Temporarily Out of Game With Weak Knee. 
### 
Rugby practice last evening con
tinued fast and interesting. There
was no regular game bin the ball was
thrown in from the twenty-five yard
line and scrimmaged for by the Var
sity and the Freshman team. The
varsity Reds succeeded in working
the ball down the length of the field
for a try after some pretty passing
by the backs. Chalmers was out of
the game last night with a bad knee
which was hurt in last Saturday's
game. Rogers took his place in the
Red backfield and Baldwin and Sev
ery were played 011 the Blacks.
