# RUGBY RULES AND STYLE OF PLAY EXPLAINED
## ENGLISH GAME DIFFERS FROM AMERICAN INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORT CHIEFLY IN METHOD OF ADVANCING THE BALL. 
### 
In view of the strangeness of Rug
by to the average college student and
the difficulty of becoming acquainted
with the objects and means of official
football as played by the Universities
of California and Stanford this article,
explaining the mode of play and the
fundamental rules of the game, has
been prepared.
Rugby is played by two teams of
fifteen players each, on a field meas
uring iro by 75 yards. The essential
difference between the old and new
game is in the method of advancing
the ball. In Rugby it consists in con
tinuous running, passing, and "drib
bling," which is advancing the belli
easily along the ground, by kicking.
Team work enters into hardly any
other branch of the English game
than passing. Rugby has 110 downs,
no bucks, no interference .
At the kick-off, the players of the
attacking side are lined across the
center of the field and their oppo
nents are disposed over their own
territory, as in the American game.
If a player of the defending side
catches the ball on the kick-off lie Ins
the choice of running or kicking it
down the field. The men near rhe
player in possession of the ball may
form a line and run down the field,
passing the ball. The man with the
ball advances it as far as possible
until about to be tackled, when he
passes it to the man next in line.
If opponents crowd round the man
with the ball his best play is to kick
it down the field, sufficiently high to
allow one of his team to catch it on
the fly, but the man catching the ball
must be on-side. According to rule
7, a player is off-side if he enters a
scrummage from his opponent's side,
or, "if the ball has been kicked,
touched or is being run with by one
of his own side behind him." Sec
tion "d" of rule 8 says, "a player is
placed 011-side, when one of his side
* * * has run in front of him,
having kickcd the ball when behind
him." Under 110 circumstances could
the catcher of the ball take it on the
bounce until "the ball has been kick
cd by or has touched an opponent."
An off-side player is also placed on
side "when an opponent has run five
yards with the ball" and "when one
of his side has run in front of him
with the ball."
Sometimes when a rr;n with the
ball is tackled there is contention for
possession of it and the play becomes
mixed. If a forward pass is made
the umpire calls time and a scrum
mage or "scrum" takes place. A
player of the side opposite to the one
which made the forward pass then
throws the ball under the feet of
the men in the scrummage. The
member# of one team shove against
those of the other, trying to kick the
ball back to one of tlicit own men.
Just as soon as the ball is kicked out
of the scrummage this formation
breaks up and active play recom

mences.
If the ball is dropped or rolls to the
ground and cannot be picked up he
cause of the number of opponents
near, "dribbling" conies into use. If
one side gains the upper hand in this
play the other side will probably kick
it"in touch," thus putting it tempo
rarily out of play and gaining an
equal chance when the ball is put
hack in play. '1 he ball is in touch
when it, or a player carrying it, touch
or cross the touch-line (side-line); it
shall then belong to the side opposite
to that last touching it in the field of
play, except when carried in. One
of the side to whom the hall belongs
shall bring it into play at the spot
where it went into touch by either
throwing it out so as to alight at
right angles to the touch-line; or
scrummaging it at a spot 011 a line
at right angles to the touch-line.
Besides the wing play—continually
passing the ball to the side while
running with it—another play de
serves mention because of its specta
cular nature. This is the fiying drop
kick. A player is running with the
ball toward his opponents' goal. Men
run threateningly upon him. Just
as lie is about to be tackled, in a flash
he has dropped the ball and kicked
it the instant it rises from the ground.
A successful kick of this kind requires
great skill and counts four points.
When the ball has gone over the
goal line and is first touched by one
of the team attacking that goal, a
"try" is gained. A try counts three
points and corresponds to a touch
down in the American game. There is
a "touchdown" when a player touches
the ball down behind his own goal
line, provided the impetus which sent
the ball was given by an opponent,
and corresponds to the old "touch
hack." A "safety" is made "when a
player touches the ball down in his
own goal, provided the impetus which
sent it in was given by his own side."
"When one side makes a safety,
the opposite sido may claim a drop
out or that a scrummage be formed
five yards from the goal-line opposite
the spot where the ball was given
the impetus causing the safety to be
made." By a drop-out is meant the
following: the team attacking the
goal behind which the safety was
made line tip 011 the twenty-five yard
line and a member of the defending
side puts the ball in play by a drop
kick down the field. After a
"touchdown" the ball is putin play
by a drop-out. There are frequent
free kicks in Rugby, as this kick is
allowed as a penalty in many in
stances. The free kick after a fair
catch is familiar to the patrons of the
American game.
A place kick or goal from a penalty
kick counts three points. A goal af
ter a try scores two points. The try,
the goal after a try, and the goal
from the field, including the drop
goal from a mark or a penalty kick.

arc the methods of scoring. The at
tempt for a goal after a try is the
same as that in American football,
with this modification: if the attempt
is unsuccessful, a drop-out puts the
ball into play; if the goal is made,
the side scored against kicks off in
the accustomed manner and play is
resumed by the two opposing teams.
