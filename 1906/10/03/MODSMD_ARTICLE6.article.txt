# SENIOR CLASS MEETS
## MANAGER REPORTS ON 1907 CIRCUS. Class Roll and Two Group Pictures Will Replace Photographs in Burned "Quad." 
### 
The Senior Class held a meeting
this afternoon and lis'.e.ied to the
treasurer's report and a special re
port by chairman L. M. Edwards, of
the Senior circus committee. There
have been practically no expenses so
far this year, but the finances of the
class are low and consequently chair
man Edwards said that the circus
would be managed on an economical
basis and no money would be spent
that was not absolutely necessary to
make the affair a success. The class
voted to allow the committee in
charge of the circus to draw upon the
class treasury for what money was
needed for preliminary expenses. Ed
wards also emphasized .he necessity
of every member of the class taking
an active interest in the circus in
order to insure its success. He also
said that all the men in the class were
expected to take part in the parade
on the afternoon of the circus.
S. M. Salisbury, one of the "Quad"
managers, made a short speech in
which he stated that if the members
of the class expected to have their
individual pictures in the annual, as
they would have appeared in the vol
ume that burned up, it would cost
about one dollar more for each mem
ber of the class and would also cause
much more work and a certain
amount of delay. Consequently the
class decided not to have the individ
ual pictures. A roll of the members
of the class of 1907 will appear in the
book and it has been suggested that
two group pictures be takeji for the
"Quad," one of the Senior women
and one of the men.
