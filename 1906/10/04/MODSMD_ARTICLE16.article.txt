The work of the Engineering Com
mission in the rapid clearing up and
reconstruction of the buildings in
jured by the earthquake calls for the
unanimous commendation of students
and faculty. When the University op
ened in August it seemed as if little
had been done toward repairing the
damage, even to a sufficient extent
that the class rooms could be entered.
This was not, however, in any meas
ure the fault of those who had the
work in charge, but resulted from
the strike of the workmen and other
unavoidable delays. When the stu
dents returned for the fall semester
the interrupted work had just been
resumed and has been pushed since
that time with thorough and efficient
zeal, until the classes are now com
fortably cared for and the University
courses are being given in the usual
way.
Thus far the commission has aimed
solely at the quick repair of the serv
iceable buildings and the demolish
ment of those deemed worthless. No
plans have been settled upon as to
the ultimate plan of rstoration, but
it is crtain that this Herculean task
will be well accomplished, for the
personnel of the Commission insures
the very best and most prompt re
sults. Stanford has men and spirit,
and with these essentials the build
ings will rise up again to complete
the growth of a great university.
