An opportunity to contribute to
the track fund and at the same time
derive a considerable amount of
pleasure will be offered tomorrow
evening at the skating rink. We
hope that the students will support
this plan for raising money, as well
as others which Manager Sales pro
poses to inaugurate in the near fut
ure. The student body treasury, as
i-; well known, is not in a prosperous
condition, and if the improved athletic
facilities desired arc to be secured,
it is necessary that the finances be
maintained by other than the regula
tion means.
