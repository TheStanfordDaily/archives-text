# Changes in Old Football Rules.
## 
### 
Considerable change has been made
in the rules of the football game that
Eastern colleges will play this year.
The more important ones follow:
The length of the game is short
ened ten minutes making each half
25 minutes in length. The player
must clearly signal for a fair catch.
Time may be asked for by each cap
tain three times in each half. Hur
dling is clearly defined and forbidden.
The necessary distance to be gained
in three downs has been doubled.
One forward pass is allowed to each
scrimmage, provided the player is
behind the line of scrimmage when
the ball is put into play.
