## Prohibition Club Changes Name and Broadens Activity. 
### 
At a meeting of the Prohibition
League last Tuesday evening, it was
decided to change the name of the
organization to the Stanford Tem
perance Study League, and to change
the constitution so as to be consis
tent with this larger work. The
amended object of the League is "to
study the liquor question in all its
aspects, from a scientific and non
partisan standpoint, to promote in
terest in this study among the stu
dents and to develop a spirited public
sentiment." These changes have
been made because of the fact that
the word, prohibition, has always giv
en the false impression that it is di
rectly allied to the Prohibition Party,
and because there is a larger work
here for a temperance league.
The State Prohibition Leagues have
agreed to let this new organization
take part in the annual debating con
tests.
The National Secretary of Colle
giate Prohibition Leagues will be at
the University on October 18th and
