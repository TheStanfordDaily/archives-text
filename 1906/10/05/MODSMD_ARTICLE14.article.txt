The Freshman Class lias at last or
ganized itself and is already showing
good results. Today it was decided
to adopt a class cap to be worn as a
distinctive emblem during the year.
Such a step has been agitated in pre
vious years, but 1910 is the first class
that has seen lit to act on the sug
gestion. In so doing the Freshmen
are introducing no innovation in the
way of college customs, 'ait are mere
ly following the lead of many other
universities. In many ot the larger
Eastern colleges the custom of the
first year men wearing caps is so
(irmly rooted that no Freshman may
wear anything but a cap upon the
campus.
In adopting caps for the use of the
Freshmen, 1910 has taken a wise step.
The adoption of a hat would have
hardly met with the approval of the
other classes, but a simple and tasty
cap will be entirely approved of.
It is to be hoped, nowever, that
the 1910 cap will be of such a style
as to preclude any possibility of suc
ceeding entering classe- refusing to
adopt a similar headgear. Since there
is to be a Freshman insignia it should
be suitable, not only for 1910, but for
everv Freshman class o f the future.
