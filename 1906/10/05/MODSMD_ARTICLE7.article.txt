# MAY PLAY IN SOUTH
## FRESHMEN WILL GO AGAINST LOS ANGELES AGGREGATION Trip to Southern City After 1910 Intercollegiate Game is Planned. 
### 
There is little doubt that the Fresh
man team will go south soon after
they have met the 1910 team from ac
ross the bay. The Polytechnic High
School of Los Angeles lias been en
tered into negotiations with by Man
ager Sales, and a definite date will be
set by next week.
Polytechnic High lias been holding
Rugby practice and playing the old
game at the same time. Not until
this week was the fact that this south
ern school was contemplating the
adoption oif the English game known,
when the southerners began corre
spondence with the northern univer
sities with a view toward getting
games with either the second or the
r reshmen teams. Sales has looked up
on the proposition to s'.nd the 1910
aggregation south, with favor, and it
is now an assured fact that the first
year men will take the trip.
• Polytechnic has not only material
with an excellent reputation, but also
a coach of the very first quality. This
is "Pat" Higgins, of the all-Australian
stars, who is considered by many the
best informed Rugby man on the Pa
cific Coast.
Other southern schools are gradual
ly falling into line behind their north
ern leaders, and it is safe to predict
that before this season is passed Poly
technic will have Rugby rivals in her
own territory. One drawback to an
immediate success of the new game
is the marked lack of available
coaches with a thorough knowledge
of the English sport.
