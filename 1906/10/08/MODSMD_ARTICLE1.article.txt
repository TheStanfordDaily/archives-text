# FRESHMEN PLAY WELL
## REDS RUN UP SIXTEEN POINTS ON 1910 BLACKS. Worthington Makes Brilliant Place Kick from Thirty-Yard Line.-Varsity Reds Play Poorly. 
### 
Playing in the best form which
they have shown so far this season,
the Freshmen Reds ran up a total of
sixteen points on the Black fifteen
in Saturday afternoon's game. Aside
from a tendency to frequent forward
passing, the Red backs and forwards
played fast and clever Rugby. Their
play was a great improvement 011 last
Saturday's game against Santa Cruz
and it augurs well for a good showing
by the Cardinal players when they
meet California next week.
Five minutes after the kick-off
Mitchell rushed the ball across the
line for the first try. Jordan missed
an easy goal. The second score came
in the most spectacular feature of the
game. A forward pass gave the Reds
a free kick from the thirty-yard line
with the ball set almost against the
fence. Worthington shot it squarely
between the posts from placement,
scoring the second three points.
This ended the scoring for the first
half.
After the ball had worked up and
down the field in the second period
the Reds broke it out of a scrum and
dribbled it across the line, Thorpe
falling on it for the second try. Lit
tle kicked an easy goal. The last
score was made by Mitchell after a
long, dodging run endiing across the
Black goal-line in the extreme cor
ner of the field. Again Worthing
ton kicked a beautiful goal from a
very difficult angle.
Upson, who took Faulkner's place
at full 011 the Reds, played a strong
game, getting away his punts very
fast and covering his territory in the
backfield in good style. Cook, Ga
nong and Little played good ball in
the backfield, while Worthington,
Thorpe and Chcda were the stars
of the scrum. The team as a whole
worked well and developed more
scoring power than they have hereto
fore shown this season.
Following the Freshman game,
the varsity Blacks and Reds lined
up as usual; the Reds won but they
were unable to score more than one
try, which was made early in the
first half after a long run by Chal
mers when Hussey and Macfarland
carried the ball over the line, Fenton
missing a hard goal. For the rest
of the game the Blacks had all the
best of it, playing hard and aggres
sive Rugby and smashing the hither
to invincible back advance of the
Reds with case. Three times the
Blacks were within easy scoring dis
tance and three times a try was
averted, twice by the good work of
Fenton who punted out of danger.
In the second half Lanagan sub
stituted three of the third team men
on the Blacks. Moser who took Mac
donald's place at full showed up well.
Laumcister, Rogers and Cole all play
ed good ball 112 rothe Blacks.
Jennings, an old English star, rcf
ereed both games and worked them
off faster than any other official who
has appeared so far this season.
He penalized frequently and was very
strict as regarded forward passes.
Jennings stated that the men were
picking up the new game well, but
that they still had lots to learn. He
said that it appeared to him an even
break between the work of the Cardi
nal and California squads.

ton kicked a beautiful goal from a
very difficult angle.
Upson, who took Faulkner's place
at full 011 the Reds, played a strong
game, getting away his punts very
fast and covering his territory in the
backfield in good style. Cook, Ga
nong and Little played good ball in
the backfield, while Worthington,
Thorpe and Chcda were the stars
of the scrum. The team as a whole
worked well and developed more
scoring power than they have hereto
fore shown this season.
Following the Freshman game,
the varsity Blacks and Reds lined
up as usual; the Reds won but they
were unable to score more than one
try, which was made early in the
first half after a long run by Chal
mers when Hussey and Macfarland
carried the ball over the line, Fenton
missing a hard goal. For the rest
of the game the Blacks had all the
best of it, playing hard and aggres
sive Rugby and smashing the hither
to invincible back advance of the
Reds with case. Three times the
Blacks were within easy scoring dis
tance and three times a try was
averted, twice by the good work of
Fenton who punted out of danger.
In the second half Lanagan sub
stituted three of the third team men
on the Blacks. Moser who took Mac
donald's place at full showed up well.
Laumcister, Rogers and Cole all play
ed good ball 112 rothe Blacks.
Jennings, an old English star, rcf
ereed both games and worked them
off faster than any other official who
has appeared so far this season.
He penalized frequently and was very
strict as regarded forward passes.
Jennings stated that the men were
picking up the new game well, but
that they still had lots to learn. He
said that it appeared to him an even
break between the work of the Cardi
nal and California squads.
