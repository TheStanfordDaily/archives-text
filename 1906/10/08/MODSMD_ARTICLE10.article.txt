Coach Murphy has wired his wil
lingness to accept the offer made him
by Manager Sales and the boating
men of the University, and the only
step that remains to make his return
certain is the approval of the terms
by the Executive Committee. In the
overtures made to the great coach a
direct offer was not made but the
terms which it was possible for Stan
ford to give were stated in an un
official way. The boating men then
wrote asking Murphy not to sign any
other contract until he heard again
from Satnford, and at the same time
pledged themselves to raise the dif
ference between what the Associated
Students would pay and what Mur
phy asked.
The promising condition of rowing
at Stanford certainly warrants the
retention of last year's coach, and
we hope that the Executive Commit
tee will see fit to re-employ him. He
is ready and anxious to again direct
the interests of boating, and experi
ence goes to show that without a
first-class coach rowing cannot be
thoroughly successful at this Univer
sity.
Murphy's development of a winning
Stanford crew was unfortunately in
terrupted last semester, but this op
portunity to continue with the excel
lent beginning should not be over
looked.
