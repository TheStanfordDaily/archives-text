Delano, '08, being postponed Satur

of two sets to one, in favor of Gow
an will stand when these players
meet to finish the contest for the
University championship.
The first match, the Junior-Senior
contest between S. M. Salisbury, '07,
and P. B. Delano, '08, was started
on the Encina courts last Saturday
morning at 9 o'clock. The match was
won by the Junior representative, af
ter a rather slow contest, both men
playing listless tennis.
The Sophomore-Freshman match
between A. J. Gowan, '09, and T. C.
Henry, '10, which followed immedi
ately afterward, developed some very
pretty tennis, five sets being played
before Gowan defeated the 1910 repre
sentative. Both men handled them
selves well at the net and in the back
court, ITenry using a very effective
chop and placing accuiately, while
Gowan played strong at nearly all
points and won finally through his
steadiness and tournament experi
ence.
The winners met in the final round
at 4 o'clock. This match also proved
very close, the games running into
deuce sets until darkness stopped
further play. Delano took the first
set and Gowan the next two. The
championship will be decided next
Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock
on the Encina courts, the play to
continue from the present score. The
summary follows:
Junior-Sophomoreâ€”Unfinished, A.
J. Gowan, 6-4, 7-5; P. B. Delano,
7-5-
P. B. Delano and L. 1?. Gay won
the Junior double try-out this after
noon, defeating K. L. Fenton and
J. E. Cushing in the final round, 6-4,
6-4. .
