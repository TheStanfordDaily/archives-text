# ANGELL ON RUGBY
## EXPLAINS RULES AND PLAYS OF GAME. Describes Scrummage And Points Out the More Common Fouls and Penalties. 
### Dr. F. Angell 
The essential difference between
Rugby football and the American
game is in the matter of interference.
The rules penalize with a free kick
the side of a player who "holds an
opponent who has not got the ball,"
or "not himself running at the ball
charges or obstructs an opponent not
holding the ball." A player running
at the ball may only shoulder charge
an opponent so running at the ball.
A piling up is also penalized. The
rules governing this impose the pen
alty of a free kick if any player "be
ing on the ground does not immedi
ately get up" or "prevents an oppo
nent getting up or putting the ball
down" or "having the ball doe* not
immediately put it down in front oi
him on being held." "Held" means
tackled so that the player cannot p;iss
or get rid of the ball. This result.-
in much of the high tackling seen in
the Rugby game.
But it is the "scrum" which is
least understood from the bleachers
Like our scrimmage, the scrum fol
lows in the course of play when the
ball is held or down. It. is enforced
as a penalty when a player kno :ks
or throws a ball forward ("knock on"
and "throw forward"). A majority
of the penalties imposed in the games
on Stanford Field have been for
breaches of the rules governing play
in the scrummage. The free kick
penalty is imposed when a player
"cither handles the ball or falls down
in a scrummage," picks the ball out
of a scrum or "while in scrummage
lifts his foot before the ball is put
into scrummage." It is also imposed
when the ball is put "unfairly," i. c.,
not midway between the opposing
forwards, or when the ball has come
out of scrummage and is returned by
hand or foot." Again when a player
"obstructs his opponents' backs by
remaining on his opponents' side of
the ball when it is in scrummage" a
free kick is given as penalty. This
rule was repeatedly broken by the
Santa Cruz backs in the Freshman
game and though they were several
times penalized, the most effectual
remedy for repeated violation of a
rule, —the ruling off from the field
of the offending player—was not ap
plied. And it may be noticed that
the rules give the referee much lat
itude in the direction of imposing the
heavier penalties ; if the penalty pro
vided for the breach of a given rule
does not bring about reform, he may
impose a heavier one.
The formal line-up in the scrum is
not necessary. "One man can make
a scrum": the usual scrum play for
the Santa Cruz team was for the play
er having the ball to put it down
and heel it back or kick it forward
to the surprise of the Stanford men,
who thought a ball must necessarily
be thrown in from the side.
When a ball goes out of bounds,
i. e., into "touch" it may be brought

ten yards into a scrum; the usual
way, however, is to throw it in at
right angles to the side line.
The plays that occur when a ball
is hatted or thrown often puzzle the
spectator: a ball may be batted or
thrown backward without penalty; if
it is batted or thrown forward and
caught by an opponent, a free kick is
allowed: otherwise a scrummage
takes place as penalty.
Tn counting points a "try" (touch
down of the old game) counts three
points: the goal kickcd from a try
counts two: a goal from free kick un
less a punt, gives three, but a goal
from a drop kick in the course of
play counts four. A goal from a punt
counts nothing.
The development of the rules in
Rugby has been directed against un
necessary injury to the players: in
case of a player waiting for a catch,
an offside opponent must keep at
ten yards distance, nor may he tackle
the catcher till he has run five yards.
In any case the referee must stop
play when he considers it danger
ous. In the Victoria League of Aus
tralia, the "scrum" has been abolished
altogether.
