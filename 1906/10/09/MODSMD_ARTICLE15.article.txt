The call by the Graduate Manager
for men to work on the new track to
morrow will doubtless meet with a
hearty response from the students of
the University, since there is a great
desire for the completion of the new
oval in time for fall training. The
Training House Corporation is mak
ing every effort to rush the work, and
much of the material is on the
ground. The financial side of the
undertaking has taken on a some
what better aspect than the uncertain
outlook of the beginning of the se
mester. A serious difficulty has been
encountered, however, in the matter
of securing labor, which is not only
scarce, but unreasonably expensive
this year. This has led to the decis
ion of the corporation to dispense
with contractors and to take up the
construction of the track under its
own direct management, by which it
is expected that a large saving will
be made.
The speed with which the new track
will be finished and the amount of un
necessary expenditure that will be
avoided, will in a large measure lie
determined by the manner in which
the call for assistance is responded
to tomorrow.
