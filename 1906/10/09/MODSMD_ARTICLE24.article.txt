# SALES ORDERS ROOTERS' HATS.
## Graduate Manager Places Order for Four Hundred. 
### 
Graduate Manager D. D. Sales lias j
decided to purchase four hundred ,
rooters' hats in order to insure the !
convenient and certain obtaining of !
official hats by those who are to oc- j
cupy the Stanford rooting section on |
the ioth of November. The contract |
of ordering hats was given to two
Kncina men last week by a Palo Al
to firm but, as up to date only one
hundred and fifty hats have been or
dered. Sales considered it expedient
that the student body take upon itself
the..responsibility of guaranteeing the
ordering of sufficient hats. All orders
previously taken will be turned over
to the manager, and the former solici
tors reimbursed. The hats will be
placed on sale by Frazer & Company.
The hats are to be manufactured
by a Chicago firm. It is also expect
ed that by this wholesale purchase
about $50 will be netted to the stu
dent body. The hat ordered will cost
tifty cents and is to be identical in
pattern with that of last year, but the
color will be of a much lighter shade
of red. The first order was sent in
tonight. By seeing Manager Sales
during his office hours names and ex
act sizes may be placed 011 a reserve
list: F. C. Thiele of Palo Alto has
signified his intention of furnishing
megaphones.
