The Seniors majoring in the Elec

initial steps toward the organization
of a society. A committee consisting
of L. A. Henley, '06, L. W. Lowles,

ed to draw up a constitution modelled
after the one governing the society at
Cornell, which is a branch of the
American Institute of Electrical En
gineers. The society will hold its
next meeting October 22(1 at which
more complete organization and elec
