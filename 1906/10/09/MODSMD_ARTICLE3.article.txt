# CHANGES IN LINE UP
## VARSITY BLACKS AND REDS SWITCHED LAST NIGHT. Freshman Reds Make Very Disappointing Showing In Scrimmage Against Blacks. 
### 
The personnel of the varsity Blacks
and Reds received the severest shak
ing np of the season at last night's
practice. In the back field, Macfar
land and Hussey were switched from
the Reds and Rogers and Cole were
substituted. Laumeister replaced
Owen at scrum half on the Reds, and
Searles and Myers were taken on in
the scrum in place of Tomasini and
Edwards.
These changes seemed to strength
en the Black team and they were
able to score for the first time this
season. The Reds also scored a try
and Fenton kicked an easy goal, leav
ing his team on the long end of a
five to three score. The Blacks had
all the best of the contest and three
times were within scoring distance
of the Red goal but failed to shove
the ball across. On the Black team
Terrill was moved into the. scrum and
Moser who played a strong game at
full Saturday took his place at five.
The Freshman Reds showed a very
disappointing reversal of form, in
their practice scrum with the 1910
Blacks. Neither side was able to
score but the Blacks had all the
best of the game and kept the ball
in Red territory throughout. The
Reds fought hard but lacked aggres
siveness and failed miserably when
they tried to advance the ball. Their
passing was poor and the Black
backs were able to break any
gains by this style of play with case.
At dribbling the Black forwards gain
ed consistently. The game was a
great disappointment after the show
ing of the Reds 011 Saturday and
showed conclusively that there will
have to be a great improvement in
the work of the first year men before
they go up against California next
Saturday.
