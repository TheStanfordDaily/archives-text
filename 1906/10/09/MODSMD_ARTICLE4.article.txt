# NO OFFICIAL CHOSEN
## DAVIES WILL NOT REFEREE FRESHMAN GAME. Taylor Refuses To Accept Santa Cruzan.—Sales and Snedigar Meet Tomorrow. 
### 
Up to date the official for the inter
collegiate Freshman game next Sat
urday, has not been selected. A ten
tative arrangement with Davies, ihc
Santa Cruz star, had been made by
Sales and Snedigar, but since the Cal
ifornia-Santa Cruz game last Satur
day, Coach Oscar Taylor will not
agree to the crack drop-kicker as th»
intercollegiate referee. The two
graduate managers will meet in San
Frarcisco tomorrow and will endeav
or to pick another Rugby player who
will be agreeable to both parties
Negotiations, looking to the en
gagement with Davies were opened
by Snedigar who wrote to the Sania
Cruzan about two weeks ago, invit
ing him to act as the official . Davies
replied stating that he would be
pleased to act in this capacity, but
that he would prefer postponing his
definite answer, until Santa Cruz had
met both of the 1910 fifteens, and
both coaches had seen his style of
play. Meantime Snedigar had con
ferred with Sales and found that Da
vies was agreeable to Stanford also
It seemed then, as though the diffi
cult question of an official had been
satisfactorily solved.
Last Saturday the Blue and Gold
Freshmen played Santa Cruz, and af
ter the game it was currently report
ed that Davies was not acceptable to
the California coach. These reports
were definitely confirmed today,
when Snedigar telephoned to Sales,
! stating positively that Taylor refused
I to accept Davies.
The lateness of the date and the
scarcity of good Rugby officials near
San Francisco will make the selection
jof an able referee for Saturday's
game a very difficult one. Sales and
Snedigar will, however, do all that is
in their power to close the matter
tomorrow and finally sclect Davies'
I successor.
