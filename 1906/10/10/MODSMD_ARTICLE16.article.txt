The fact that the final rally be
fore the intercollegiate Freshman
game is to be held in Assembly Hall
is due to the generosity ot the Busi
ness Office in allowing the student
body to meet in the auditorium with
out charge. Since the University au
thorities have in the past discouraged
the practice of holding rallies in the
chapel, and as a rally is not an oc
casion of pecuniary profit lor the
Associated Students, the waiver of
the hire of Assembly Hall seems evni
nently just, and is to be regarded as
a great favor on the part of the
business management.
