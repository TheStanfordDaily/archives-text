## DR. ANGELL AND PROFESSOR SEARLES WILL BE AMONG SPEAKERS AT SEND-OFF FOR 1910 RUGBY PLAYERS. 
### 
The rally for the Freshman team
will be held on Thursday evening at
7:30 in Assembly Hall. The Univer
sity band will head a procession,
which will form at Encina, and from
there march to Assembly Hall. The
Business Oftice granted R. S. Kellogg,
'07, the use of Asscnbly Hall for this
occasion without compensation. It
is probable that there will be at
least five speakers, two of whom will
be Dr. Angell and Professor Searles.
The other speakers have not been an
nounced as yet.
Of the twenty-five songs handed i".
seven have been held out from which
to select the first and second prize
winners. There were a number of
good songs which were written to
popular music and others in which
the music was too difficult for the
bleachers. These songs could not be
accepted. Of the fifteen yells, two

have been favorably considered for
submission to a final try-out for the
first prize on the bleachers this after
noon. These two yells arc as fol
lows:
