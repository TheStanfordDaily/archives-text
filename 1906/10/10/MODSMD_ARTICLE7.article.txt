### 
Only one change was made last
night in the line-up of the varsity
teams when lieinly took Presley's
place at wing forward. There was
no preliminary practice last night,
but the Freshman Reds and Blacks
were started off in a fairly fast game.
J he Reds showed a slight improve
ment in their work and succeeded in
scoring eight points 011 the Blacks.
Ganong and Cheda scorcd twice and
Little kicked one of the goals. The
Reds played faster ball than at Mon
day's practice but their work still
lacks fight and aggressiveness. The
competition for all the places on the
team is so close and shifts have been
so frequent in the past week, that
it will probably be impossible to an
nounce the final line-up of the 1910
fifteen until Friday night.
Following the Freshman game the
varsity Reds and Blacks played a
hard contest, the Reds scoring one
try and kicking the goal. Chalmers
was out of the game last night and
Coach Lanagan played center for the
Reds. He made one spectacular
gain, catching his own punt and run
ning down the field for fifteen yards.
