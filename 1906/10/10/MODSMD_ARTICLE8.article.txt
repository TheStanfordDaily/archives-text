# Chicago Abolishing Co-education.
## 
### 
The University of Chicago has tak
en active measures toward the abol
ishment of co-education. The meth
od used will be a gradual one and
the women are now barred from hev
eral departments and in the near
insure will be excluded from the Uni
versity entirely.
Dr. Jordan expressed himself on
this subject as follows: "This sort
of a movement in the abolishment of
co-education is decidedly in the
wrong direction. Co-education has
always been very satisfactory at Stan
ford and we have had 110 trouble with
the young women."
