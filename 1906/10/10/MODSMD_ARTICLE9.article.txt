# "CHAPPIE" APPEARS FRIDAY.
## Football Number Deals Chiefly with Old and New Game. 
### 
The special Freshman football
number of the "Chaparral," with con
siderable art work, will be placed on
sale on the quad Friday morning, at
twenty-five cents per copy.
A sensational feature entitled
"Chappie Laughs Again," will be dis
closed when the number goes on
sale. Two pages are devoted to a
burlesque on the "Sequoia" article
regarding the"Daily Palo Alto."
The art work of the number is of
an unusually high standard. The
feature of the issue is a full page pose
of a Stanford girl watching the foot
ball game, in a player's overcoat. It
is run against a yellow tint, and is
the work of E. E. Horowitz, '06.
D. 11. Ferry, '08, contributes two
drawings, one a football cartoon on
the first page. S. Mac Donald, '10, has
another football pose called, "Goal";
J. M. Van Dcursen, 'to, contributes
a football girl and an heroic football
man. F. O. Lantz, '08, has drawn a
cartoon lamenting the loss of the
old game, and Virgil Bellows, cx-'oq,
is represented by a full page drawing
called "Ghosts," which suggests the
football interest of the past.
The literary features deal largely
with football interests. There is
some short verse by L. S. Levy, '08,
and F. A. Curtin, '08. E. J. Hadley,
'08, contributes several short prose
skits dealing with the Rugby .game.
The editor treats with Freshman
Profs, says some tilings about the
proposed Senior circus, deals with
the Freshman Rugby game, and
closes with a word regarding contri
butions for "Chappie."
