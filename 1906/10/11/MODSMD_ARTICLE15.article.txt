idea of a
• i ■> . n : i to t t ' e place of
the old 'training Mouse Corporation,
was advanced last semester by Dr.
Frank Angell, a member of that cor
poration. lie took the idea to the
Board of Trustees and it was passed
upon favorably by them, provided
there was sufficient faculty and
alumni representation on the Board.
This plan was submitted to the old
Executive Committee and a formal
amendment was drafted by them to
be added to the Student Body Consti
tution.
This amendment was finally voted
upon and passed at the student body
meeting of August 29, 1906. Unfortu
nately the personnel of the Board as
therein provided did not agree at all
with that advanced by Dr. Angell and
passed favorably upon by the Board
of Trustees. The newly elected Ex
ecutive Committee then passed over
the appointment of any board un
der the amendment, for three meet
ings. Meantime President Jordan
had outlined a Board of Control in
conformance with the ideas of the
Trustees. This Board was to have
two faculty members, two student
body members and two alumni mem
bers. Its powers were the superin
tendence of all work on the new ath
letic fields, acting under the general
direction of the Trustees.
There was, then, one Board of Con
trol in the field and it would have
been ill-advised for the Executive
Committee to elect another, since
conflict of powers between the two
would have arisen. Another amend
ment to the Constitution would have
involved a useless waste of time. The
Committee decided, therefore, to ta
ble the matter until the annual stu
dent body meeting next spring. By
that time there will have been time
to observe the workings of the
Trustees' Board of Control and the
student body will be in a position to
decide intelligently as to what shall
be done with the present amendment.
