Editor "Daily Daily Palo Alto":â€”
An article appeared in Monday's
issue of the San Francisco papers an
nouncing the resignation of Profes
sor Anderson from the University.
Since the statements made in the ar
ticle were altogether untrue, those of
us who realized how annoying the
consequences of such an article can
Le, hoped that the University com
munity would he informed that the
statements were not true. No correc
tion having appeared as yet, 1 beg the
privilege of space for this brief note.
