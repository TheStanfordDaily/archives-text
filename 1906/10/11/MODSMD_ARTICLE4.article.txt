# MURPHY IS ACCEPTED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE APPROVES OFFER TO COACH. Appointment of Board of Control Is Left in Hands of University Authorities. 
### 
The most important business trans
acted by the Executive Committee at
its weekly meeting last night was the
action taken sanctioning Graduate
Manager D. D. Sales, '06, to offer
Rowing Coach Dan Murphy $100 per
month from January Ist to June Ist,
1907, for coaching the Stanford
oarsmen, which practically assures
the presence of Coach Murphy at
Stanford next year.
Coach Murphy has repeatedly sig
nified his desire to return to coach
the Stanford rowing squad if the
student body would pay him suffi
cient recompense. The Executive
Committee has offered Murphy all
that it considers practicable in view
of the condition of the student fi
nances, and the boat club has pledged
itself to make up the balance of the
sum asked by Murphy.
In a letter dated October sth, sent
to F. Zimmerman, '07, captain of the
varsity crew, Murphy writes as fol
lows in connection with the matter
of races between varsity eights from
California and Stanford: ''The
quickest, surest and cheapest way to
do is to buy a couple of eights from
Harvard or Yale from the same
builder. That would likely be Davy
ol Cambridge. 1 dare say you can get
a couple of good shells, perhaps for
$250 apiece." Captain Zimmerman
has expressed himself as highly in
favor of the eight-oared race.
The Executive Committee decided
not to appoint the members of the
newly-constituted Board of Control
for one year. This action leaves the
Training House Corporation still in
control of the athletic fields. A board
of control is being formed by Presi
dent Jordan and other members of
the faculty, however, which will rep
lesent the interests of the Board of
Trustees in the construction of the
athletic fields.
Complimentary tickets were voted
to each man on the entire football
squad, entitling him to one admis
sion to the Freshman game.
