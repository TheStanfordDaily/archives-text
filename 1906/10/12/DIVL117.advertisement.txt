The world is divided on the ques
tion of glasses. People who need and
wear them are happy and contented
in their use and well satisfied as to
their value.
There are those, however, who
need, but refuse to use them, doubt
ing their value and efficiency in their
case. These people may get along
and often do by frowning, and squint
ing, and straining their eyes. 'Tisn't
pleasant though and besides is often
dangerous. If you've eye trouble
why not come over on the happy,
contented side with the glass wearers.
