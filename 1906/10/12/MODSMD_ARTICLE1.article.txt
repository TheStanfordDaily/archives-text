## LINE-UP PRESENTS A STRONG AND HEAVY SCRUM, WITH FAST PLAYERS IN BACKFIELD.

R. Little, captain of the 1910 play
ers, will hold down the position of
scrum half in tomorrow's game. Lit
tle has been playing behind the scrum
all season 011 the first fifteen and was
one of the team which met Santa

years old and weighs 145 pounds.
He is a member of the Beta Theta Pi

C. Pemberton will play the impor

member of the fifteen which met San

weighs 158 pounds.
