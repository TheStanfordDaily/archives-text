# RECORDS OF MEN ON STANFORD TEAM
## LINE-UP PRESENTS A STRONG AND HEAVY SCRUM, WITH FAST PLAYERS IN BACKFIELD. 
### 
R. Little, captain of the 1910 play
ers, will hold down the position of
scrum half in tomorrow's game. Lit
tle has been playing behind the scrum
all season 011 the first fifteen and was
one of the team which met Santa
Cruz. He gained his football train
ing at the Pasadena High School
where he played quarter at the old
game. Little is a heady and ag
gressive player. He passes well and
is a fairly good man in a scattered
held. From the first practice he had
a clean lead over the other candidates
for his position and the consistent
game, which he put up, easily entitled
him to the captaincy. Little is 19
years old and weighs 145 pounds.
He is a member of the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity.
C. Pemberton will play the impor
tant position of wing forward in to
morrow's game. Pemberton is an
other man who has been playing in
the same position 011 the first squad
throughout the season. He was a
member of the fifteen which met San
ta Cruz. Pemberton is a clever
passer and uses good judgment in
getting off his throw-ins from a line
out. On the defensive Pemberton is
fast and can be relied on to break
up California's attempts to work the
ball directly out of the scrum. He
got his football training at the Mis
sion High School, where he learned
the American game. Pemberton is a
member of the Kappa Alpha frater
nity. He is twenty years old and
weighs 158 pounds.
For the positions in the scrum com
petition has been very close. Hardly
any of the men had their positions se
cured before the final line-up was an-
nounced tonight. G. E. Cheda of the
San Luis Obispo High School, who
has an excellent preparatory school
record as a player of the old game,
was shifted into scrum after a try
at center. Cheda weighs 180 and is
wonderfully fast and aggressive for
so heavy a man. He is a good de
fensive player and is a dangerous man
in a scattered field in spite of his
weight.
R. S. Worthington is another mem
ber of the scrum who has been hold
ing his position through the season.
Worthington is a light man but he is
strong and fast. He is the best place
kicker on the team and should he be
given an opportunity for a penalty
Kick tomorrow lie may score for the
Freshmen. Worthington made a
good showing on the track last se
mester as a miler, but was unable to
compete in the Freshman meet owing
to some trouble over his registra
tion. He comes from the Pacific
Grove High School, is 22 years old
and weighs 158 pounds. He is a
member of Encina Club.
C. A. Thorpe, of Los Angeles, is an
other forward who won his position
early in the season. Thorpe is a fast
man and a clever dribbler, besides be
ing heavy and strong. lie comes
fiom Belmont School where he played
a tackle on last year's eleven. Thorpe
tips the scales at 170 pounds and is
20 years old. lie is a member of the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
j.W.Fitting will also be in the scrum
tomorrow. He has played one of the
forwards 011 the first or second fif
teens throughout the season. Fitting
is one of the heaviest men 011 the
team, weighing 178 pounds. He

front rank forward in tomorrow's
contest. Reynolds is another Pasa

170 pounds and is 18 years old. Rey
nolds is a member of the Zeta Psi

E. K. Meredith will be another
member of the 1910 scrum. Meredith
weighs only 158 pounds, but is fast
and a clever passer. He is 19 years
old. Meredith comes from Hoitts
School and is a member of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity.
P. C. Giesy is another forward
who had a hard fight for his position
and was frequently shifted between
the Reds and Blacks. Giesy comes
from Portland but entered Stanford
from the Mt. Tamalpais Military Aca
demy. He weighs 170 pounds and is
19 years old. Giesy is a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
C. F. Ganong, from the Portland
High School, will play center three
quarter tomorrow. Ganong was not
played at this position on the first
team until after the Santa Cruz game.
He is a clever dribbler and is fast
on his feet, but is inclined to hold
on to the ball too long after getting
it. Ganong weighs 155 pounds. He
's a member of Encina Club.
At the other center three-quarter
will be K. S. Jordan who has been
playing 011 the first team since the
opening of the season. Jordan was
originally tried at five-eighths but
later shifted to his present position.
He is a fast, heavy back. His worst
fault seems to be a tendency to lose
his head in a tight place. Jordan is

a good punter and a fair goal-kicker.
He comes from Palo Alto High
School where he played half-back at
the old game. Jordan is 18 years old
and weighs 155 pounds. He is a
member of the Delta Upsilon frater
nity.
The Cardinal wings who will play
tomorrow are both fast and clever
men, who have consistently held
down their places since the Santa
Cruz game. A. B. Cook who will
be 011 the extreme left of the Stan
ford backfield is the youngest man
on the Freshman team. C~»ok came
from Santa Barbara High School >vitii
a good record as a clever pl.t ye * of
the American game. At the begin
ning of the season Cook was trier
out at center but his speed and ag
gressiveness >rn caused h's shift
ing to the >>• r.g position wii'di lie
will play in tomorrow's game. Cook
is 17 years oil and weighs 145 pourds
At the other wr.g position will be A.
McDonald, who is the lightest man
cp the team. McDonald comes from
the Hill Military Academy of Port
land. He won his position after a
close race against T. A. Deßolt of
Los Angeles. McDonald tips the
scales at only 128 pounds, but what
lie lacks in weight lie makes up in
speed and clever passing. McDonald
is a member of the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity.
The all important five-eighths posi
tion will be held down by M. M.

Mitchell. Mitchell came to Stanford
from Los Angeles High School with
a fine record as a football and basket
ball player. Mitchell was shifted
into his present position after being
tried for half the season at center.
He is a fast and accurate passer, but
is apt to hold on to the ball too long.
Mitchell has been playing a good de
fensive game all season and should
spoil many of the Blue and Gold's
attacks tomorrow. Mitchell is ex
traordinarily heavy for so fast a man,
weighing 170 pounds. He is a mem
ber of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
G. C. Faulkner will be the Cardinal
fullback in tomorrow's game. Faulk
ner was also a development of the
latter half of the season. He made
his first appearance in the Santa Cruz
game and his work was of such a bril
liant order that he won his place al
most without opposition against a
strong field. Faulkner is a good pun
ter and excels at scooping up dribbled
balls on the run. On the defensive
he is a fairly sure tackier. Faulkner
got his football training at the San
Luis Obispo High School. He is 19
years old and weighs 145 pounds.
