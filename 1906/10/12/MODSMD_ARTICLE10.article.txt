Regarding tomorrow's game,
Assistant Coach Bansbach said:
"I realise that the California
team is a good, fast aggregation
and has got all kinds of fight.
I saw that at Santa Cruz. It
is a question of whether our fel
lows play the game they can
play. If they will play the game
they are capable of, they will
beat the California team."
