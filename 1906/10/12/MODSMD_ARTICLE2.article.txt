# First Intercollegiate Rugby
## FRESHMEN OF STANFORD AND U.C. MEET IN ENGLISH SPORT TOMORROW. 
### 
For the thirteenth time in the his
tory of the two universities the Fresh
man teams of Stanford and California
will battle tomorrow afternoon, at
2:30, 011 Stanford Field. They will
meet for the first time in an English
1 game, under English rules and refe
reed by an English official. Rugby
will have its first practical test to
morrow at the hands of the first year
teams.
Neither coach has had much time
to work the 1910 fifteens into very
fine shape. The men had to unlearn
all the old American game and to
learn the new and strange plays
which Rugby brought in. There was
little or 110 chance for preliminary
,:ames outside of practice scrums be
tween the first and second fifteens
and in fact each team has played only
1.lie game with a strange aggregation.
The only outside contests on which
any comparison can be based were the
Santa Cruz games. The Cardinal lost
to the Santa Cruzans 011 a penalty
kick 3-0, while the following week
California defeated the same aggre
gation 18-0. Using this alone as a
basis upon which to compare the

teams, tomorrow's contest would
mean an easy victory ror the Blue
and Gold. But spectators who saw
both games state that Santa Cruz
showed very poor form against the
California Freshmen compared to the
team work which they displayed 011
Stanford Field.
The Cardinal Freshmen will be
heavy in the scrum and should be
a little faster than California in work
ing out the ball. The wing forwards
seem about equally matched with a
slight advantage in weight for the
Cardinal. Behind the scrum, Little
has been showing up well and he
should be able to more than hold his
own with the Blue and Gold half,

FROM COACH LANAGAN
When Coach Lanagan was
questioned regarding the
chances for the 1910 fifteen, he
said, "It is absolutely impos
sible for me to make any state
ment. I have not seen the Cali
fornia Freshmen play, and I
know no more about our
chances than anybody else does.
If it were the American game I
might be able to say something,
but Rugby is too uncertain."
