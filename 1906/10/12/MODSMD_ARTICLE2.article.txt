# First Intercollegiate Rugby
## FRESHMEN OF STANFORD AND U.C. MEET IN ENGLISH SPORT TOMORROW. 
### 
For the thirteenth time in the his
tory of the two universities the Fresh
man teams of Stanford and California
will battle tomorrow afternoon, at
2:30, 011 Stanford Field. They will
meet for the first time in an English
1 game, under English rules and refe
reed by an English official. Rugby
will have its first practical test to
morrow at the hands of the first year
teams.
Neither coach has had much time
to work the 1910 fifteens into very
fine shape. The men had to unlearn
all the old American game and to
learn the new and strange plays
which Rugby brought in. There was
little or 110 chance for preliminary
,:ames outside of practice scrums be
tween the first and second fifteens
and in fact each team has played only
1.lie game with a strange aggregation.
The only outside contests on which
any comparison can be based were the
Santa Cruz games. The Cardinal lost
to the Santa Cruzans 011 a penalty
kick 3-0, while the following week
California defeated the same aggre
gation 18-0. Using this alone as a
basis upon which to compare the

teams, tomorrow's contest would
mean an easy victory ror the Blue
and Gold. But spectators who saw
both games state that Santa Cruz
showed very poor form against the
California Freshmen compared to the
team work which they displayed 011
Stanford Field.
The Cardinal Freshmen will be
heavy in the scrum and should be
a little faster than California in work
ing out the ball. The wing forwards
seem about equally matched with a
slight advantage in weight for the
Cardinal. Behind the scrum, Little
has been showing up well and he
should be able to more than hold his
own with the Blue and Gold half,

FROM COACH LANAGAN
When Coach Lanagan was
questioned regarding the
chances for the 1910 fifteen, he
said, "It is absolutely impos
sible for me to make any state
ment. I have not seen the Cali
fornia Freshmen play, and I
know no more about our
chances than anybody else does.
If it were the American game I
might be able to say something,
but Rugby is too uncertain."

both at securing the ball and at get
ting it off to the backs.
At five, wings and center the ad
vantage rests with California. Her
backs are faster and headier than the
Cardinal men. Their passing is more
highly developed and from all ac
counts tliej' have the ground-gain
ing cross kick down to a science. In
the Santa Cruz game, the Califor
nians were able to rush the ball down
the held through the defence of the
Englishmen for substantial gains.
At full-back, Faulkner is easily the
superior of his California rival. He
is a sure man at stopping up drib
bled balls and his return punts are
strong and clean.
Taken as a whole, Stanford should
be superior in breaking the ball out
cf scrum or working back to the half.
At the dribbling game California will
have a slight advantage, and at pass
ing and cross kick work the Blue and
Gold should be slightly superior. On
throw-ins and on scrums near the
goal the superior weight of the Car
ciinal forwards will give them the ad
vantage.
The punting and goal kicking abil
ities of the two teams are about
equal and there should be little scor
ing from penalty kicks. On the de
fensive Stanford will be more than
able to hold her own, and most of
California's attempts for long gains
will probably be broken up.
Tomorrow's game will be full of
penalizing and for this reason the
two thirty minute halves will be
slower than expected. Unmack bears
the reputation of being a very strict
official and many violations of the
lules which have passed unchallenged
so far this season will probably be
strictly noted tomorrow. No time
is taken out in Rugby exccpt for goal
kicks and the whistle should blow for
the end of the second half before four
o'clock. This will give the spectators
from San Francisco, who will leave
San Francisco at twelve on a special
train, a chance to return on one of
the late afternoon trains.
The rooting sections will be on the
same sides of the field as at last year's
varsity game, but they will occupy
the scats in the middle of the field.
The Blue and Gold will send down a
large rooting contingent with their
hand.

1.lie game with a strange aggregation.
The only outside contests on which
any comparison can be based were the
Santa Cruz games. The Cardinal lost
to the Santa Cruzans 011 a penalty
kick 3-0, while the following week
California defeated the same aggre
gation 18-0. Using this alone as a
basis upon which to compare the

teams, tomorrow's contest would
mean an easy victory ror the Blue
and Gold. But spectators who saw
both games state that Santa Cruz
showed very poor form against the
California Freshmen compared to the
team work which they displayed 011
Stanford Field.
The Cardinal Freshmen will be
heavy in the scrum and should be
a little faster than California in work
ing out the ball. The wing forwards
seem about equally matched with a
slight advantage in weight for the
Cardinal. Behind the scrum, Little
has been showing up well and he
should be able to more than hold his
own with the Blue and Gold half,

FROM COACH LANAGAN
When Coach Lanagan was
questioned regarding the
chances for the 1910 fifteen, he
said, "It is absolutely impos
sible for me to make any state
ment. I have not seen the Cali
fornia Freshmen play, and I
know no more about our
chances than anybody else does.
If it were the American game I
might be able to say something,
but Rugby is too uncertain."

both at securing the ball and at get
ting it off to the backs.
At five, wings and center the ad
vantage rests with California. Her
backs are faster and headier than the
Cardinal men. Their passing is more
highly developed and from all ac
counts tliej' have the ground-gain
ing cross kick down to a science. In
the Santa Cruz game, the Califor
nians were able to rush the ball down
the held through the defence of the
Englishmen for substantial gains.
At full-back, Faulkner is easily the
superior of his California rival. He
is a sure man at stopping up drib
bled balls and his return punts are
strong and clean.
Taken as a whole, Stanford should
be superior in breaking the ball out
cf scrum or working back to the half.
At the dribbling game California will
have a slight advantage, and at pass
ing and cross kick work the Blue and
Gold should be slightly superior. On
throw-ins and on scrums near the
goal the superior weight of the Car
ciinal forwards will give them the ad
vantage.
The punting and goal kicking abil
ities of the two teams are about
equal and there should be little scor
ing from penalty kicks. On the de
fensive Stanford will be more than
able to hold her own, and most of
California's attempts for long gains
will probably be broken up.
Tomorrow's game will be full of
penalizing and for this reason the
two thirty minute halves will be
slower than expected. Unmack bears
the reputation of being a very strict
official and many violations of the
lules which have passed unchallenged
so far this season will probably be
strictly noted tomorrow. No time
is taken out in Rugby exccpt for goal
kicks and the whistle should blow for
the end of the second half before four
o'clock. This will give the spectators
from San Francisco, who will leave
San Francisco at twelve on a special
train, a chance to return on one of
the late afternoon trains.
The rooting sections will be on the
same sides of the field as at last year's
varsity game, but they will occupy
the scats in the middle of the field.
The Blue and Gold will send down a
large rooting contingent with their
hand.
For the thirteenth time in the his
tory of the two universities the Fresh
man teams of Stanford and California
will battle tomorrow afternoon, at
2:30, 011 Stanford Field. They will
meet for the first time in an English
1 game, under English rules and refe
reed by an English official. Rugby
will have its first practical test to
morrow at the hands of the first year
teams.
Neither coach has had much time
to work the 1910 fifteens into very
fine shape. The men had to unlearn
all the old American game and to
learn the new and strange plays
which Rugby brought in. There was
little or 110 chance for preliminary
,:ames outside of practice scrums be
tween the first and second fifteens
and in fact each team has played only
1.lie game with a strange aggregation.
