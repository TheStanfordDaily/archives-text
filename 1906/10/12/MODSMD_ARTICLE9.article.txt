The Freshmen of the Cardinal
team will enter a contest full of un
certainties tomorrow, for no one is
able to predict with any degree of
surity the outcome of the first great
test of the new game. Stanford has

which wee ocntested for to the last
minute, and the thorough training of
the men, we believe will accomplish
all that the supporters of the Cardi
