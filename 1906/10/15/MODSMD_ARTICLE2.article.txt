After the game Coach Lanagan
said, "We were fairly beaten by a
heavier and in some respects a bet
ter team. The game was a very poor
exhibition of Rugby and every pen
alty that could possibly be inflicted
was forced upon the referee for de
cision. Unmack made a great offi
cial."
Referee Unmack said: "It was a
good hard fight all the way through
and the teams were very evenly
matched. The boys know a good
deal about the game considering the
short time that they have played it.
Most of the penalties came for over
eagerness to get the ball in the
scrum. All the men showed too
much of a tendency to hold on to
the ball especially in the California
back-field."
Dad Moulton said: "They were
too heavy for our boys. It was a
good hard fight and the Stanford
1' reshmen were certainly game. Not
a man on the team quit at any stage
of the contest."
Assistant Coach Bansbach said:
"We have 110 excuses. California
was too heavy for 11s in the scrum
and this gave them a great advantage
as our backs did not get a chance
to show what they could do. There
were altogether too many infringe
ment of the rules to make the game
interesting."
