# Stanford Team Loses to California
## CARDINAL FRESHMEN DEFEATED BY BLUE AND GOLD IN FIRST RUGBY GAME. 
### 
Three points scored on a place
ment kick from a fair catch, won for
the California Freshmen the first in
tercollegiate Rugby game, and gave
to the wearers of the Blue and Gold
their first serpentine on Stanford
Field. For the first half of the game
the advantage was with the Cardinal,
but in the second thirty minutes ex
cessive penalizing and the weakening
of the Stanford scrum, kept the ball
in her territory and finally brought
the winning score eight minutes be
fore the calling of time. Off-side
; playing and over-eagerness on the
| part of the forwards to get at the
| ball cost Stanford the game. Her
1 only chances to score were thrown
away in the free kicks which Cali
fornia gained for every infringement
of the rules, and repeated offenses in
the second half gave the Blue and
Gold their winning score.
As an exhibition of Rugby, the
game was a disappointment. Cali
fornia s boasted back-field played the
American game straight through
and failed to make a single gain by
passing or cross kicking. Her cen
i ters and wings would grab the ball
and try to buck through always with
I disastrous results. The Cardinal
■ backs had very little chance to show
. what they could do owing to the su
periority of the California scrum,
which hardly ever failed to work the
ball out into the hands of Burnham.
But on the defensive they put up a
cool and gritty game holding Califor
nia's gains to the few yards ham
mered down by every scrum.
An hour before the time scheduled
for the game the crowd began to
gather at Stanford Field and when
the teams appeared there were some
twenty-five hundred people on the
bleachers. Both colleges had full
rooting sections and the yelling and
singing was above the average of
past Freshmen games. Stanford ran
out first from the training house,
followed <t moment later by the blue
jerseyed Californians. dcadden was
out of the game from injuries, but
White of Lick had replaced him in
the California back-field. The teams
gathered around Referee Unmack to
get his final instructions and then
the Stanford fifteen scattered over
the training house end of the field
and Burnham balanced the ball for
the kick-off. On the first play Cali
fornia was off-side and the ball was
put into scrum in the center of the
field. For the first two or three
plays there was no gain, but finally
the Stanford forwards worked the
ball out and rushed it down the
field by clever dribbling. On Califor
nia's twenty-yard line, the first off
side play in the Stanford scrum gave
the Blue and Gold a free kick out of
danger. Again Mitchell, Thorpe and
Worthington dribbled down the field
until a brilliant punt by Miller sent it
back to the fifty-yard line. Here Lit
tle picked it out of the scrum and
tossed it to Jordan, who kicked clean
over the heads of the California team,
the ball rolling across the goal-line
for a touch-down.

The Blue and Gold scrum was
j working out the ball in almost every
j scrimmage, but the splendid work
| of Pemberton and the Stanford back-
I field was preventing any sensational
| gains. At dribbling Stanford had all
the best of it. All the ground gain
ed in this manner, however, was lost
by free kicks. The Cardinals, only
real chance to score came late in the
half when an off-side play gave Stan
ford a free kick from the thirty-live
yard line. Little made a splendid
try at goal from placement but
the ball fell short by about a yard.
Two revolver shots announced the
j end of the half with the ball on
! California-s twenty-five yard line,
j The second period found the
I Stanford scrum worn out, while their
j heavier opponents were still compar-
I atively strong. California had giv
en up trying to work long runs by
the back-field and was content to
let the ball travel down the field by
short gains in the scrum, trusting
for their greatest advances to the
inevitable free kick. Slowly but
surely the ball was worked down in
to Stanford territory, until at length
a penalty on the twenty-yard line
gave Johns his first try at a goal.
He put the ball between the posts,
but in doing so kicked from eight or
ten feet off his line and Unmack
refused to allow the score. A sec
ond attempt ftom the other side of
the field resulted in no goal and the
Stanford bleachers began to breathe
more easily.
Then cime the fatal play. From a
scrum the ball was worked back to
Faulkner on the ten yard line. He
punted weakly off at an angle. Johns
heeled the ball on the twenty yard
line and stepped back for the third
attempt. It resulted in a beautiful
goal.
This seemed to take the heart out
of the Cardinal Freshmen and from
the kick-off they were driven back
down the field to their own five
yard line.' Here they railed and
fighting desperately held the Blue
and Gold within a yard of a try. A
minute later Brown's revolver an
nounced the end of the game, and
the California rooters broke from
their bleachers into the serpentine.
Stanford's 1910 team was defeated
but by 110 means disgraced. With a
light and in some respects a weaker
team she fought hard and lost only
011 an accidental score. Cook was
the star of the Cardinal fifteen. He
was in every play and his kicking
and tackling were of the highest or
der. Captain Little played a brilliant
and heady game behind the scrum
and Mitchell at five-eighths made
several long gains through the Cali
fornia line. Ganong and Jordan both
played a strong defensive game and
McDonald on the wing was re
sponsible for several clever runs. In
the scrum every man played good,
hard ball, Cheda, Thorpe and Pem
berton standing out as perhaps the
most aggressive of the forwards.
Faulkner played well on the defen
sive but did not punt in his usual

' good form.
For California Webster at full and
Johns and White in the line of backs
played the strongest game. Burn
ham proved himself a fair passer but
lacked Little's speed and head-work.
All of the Blue and Gold scrum
showed up well and developed re
markable team work.
Unmack's work as referee was
above reproach. He penalized fre
quently but fairly, and California's
numerous free kicks were due to no
favoritism on his part. He followed
the men around and kept them hard
at the game for every minute of play.
The detail of the game follows:
First half.—Burnham kicked off fif
teen yards but the play was off-side
and the ball was put into scrum 111
the center of the field. Thorpe drib
bled through for fifteen yards. An
other dribble by Ganong netted five
more, White falling on the ball.
Pemberton and Mitchell dropped
Burnham in his tracks on the suc
ceeding scrums. Stanford was pen
alized and California was also off
side on the free kick. The ball was
scrummed 011 her thirty-five yard line.
Johns fumbled and the ball rolled
out of bounds. On the line out Stan
ford gained ten yards by pretty
passing. From an off-side play
Johns punted twenty-five yards out
of bounds. Mitchell and Cook drib
