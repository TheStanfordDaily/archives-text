Although the Stanford Freshmen
lost to California Saturday, they
fought gallantly and were defeated
only after a tremendous struggle
against the superior scrum and the
American tactics of the California
team. It was in tha second half that
the tiring effect of the constant run
ning back for penalty kicks told on
the Cardinal, and the Blue and Gold
was able to force the ball toward the
stubbornly defended Stanford goal.
As a game for the spectators the
contest was somewhat unsatisfactory.
It must be remembered, however,
that scarcely six weeks ago the
players were entirely unacquainted
with Rugby. As the season pro
gresses improvements may be ex
pected and the varsity game may be
looked forward to for a more sat
isfactory trial of the new sport.
