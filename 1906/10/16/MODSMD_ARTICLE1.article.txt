# IBSEN'S HEDDA GABLER
## PROBLEM PLAY TO BE PRESENTED TOMORROW NIGHT. Constance Crawley Appears in Title Role.â€”Stanford Graduate in Cast. 
### 
The special performance of Henrik
Ibsen's greatest play, Hedda Gab-j
ler, in Assembly Hall tomorrow even
ing at 8 o'clock, will be the lir>t op
portunity the University has had of
seeing the work of this great dram
atist. The demand for Ibsen pro
ductions all over the country is in- 1
creasing, and all students of the mas
ter have found Mrs. Crawley's por
trayal of the unfortunate Hedda an I
interesting and powerful study.
Nearly every one is familiar with
this play of the neurotic Hedda Ga-
Ider, a girl strong-minded, cold, be
lieving that marriage is the only per
missablc way of acquiring a villa, a
"liveried servant" and a "horse for
riding."
Imagine that girl married to a sim
ple antiquarian with a meager salary
and suddenly thrown blindly into the
fid! meaning of wifehood and the
purpose of life; that is the tragedy
which Ibsen unfolds to the view in
Hedda Gabler. The other characters :
are as clearly drawn and construct
ed as Hedda and Tesman, the pro- 1
fessor husband. Judge Brack, the
evil genius of Hedda's life, the one
who judiciously fosters her discon
tent to gain his ends; Mrs. Elvsted,
the simple, nervous wife of a selfish
busy sheriff, who has just got the
first interest in her life and does not
know what it means; Sovborg, the
genius, the reformed rake, who is so
quick to fair when tempted by Hedda
and Julia; Aunt Julia, the one love
able character, the incarnation of the
motherly, tender-hearted bourgeoise:
Ibsen winds up all these puppets, his
creations, and on the rise of the
curtain we see them dance to his
tune, the tune that only Ibsen could
play. i
Mrs. Constance Crawley has won
much praise by her performance of ;
the title role, and local followers of
modern drama have gladly seized j
this opportunity of seeing this actress :
in a play so different from all others !
she essays.
Mrs. Crawley is supported by her
own company of players, each of :
whom has no small histrionic repu
tation. Especially of interest to ;
Stanford people is the fact that Miss
Anna Scott, '04, has the part of the
aunt, a role of importance. Miss J
Scott has been with Mrs. Crawley
since last September, and has won
much praise for her work from dra-'
matic critics. She graduated in the
department of English and was a
member of the Delta Gamma soror
ity. '
