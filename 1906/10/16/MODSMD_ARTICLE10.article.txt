## Many Candidates Sign for Hockey and Practice Begins. 
### 
The Women's Athletic Association
held a meeting yesterday, in which
it decided to, purchase new nets for
the tennis courts. Hockey was dis
cussed informally as well as the
schedule for basket-ball.
In the preliminary hockey practice
yesterday afternoon ten women came
out. Miss E. Buckingham, '08, and
Miss E. Palmer, '10, are leading the
squad, both having had some experi
ence in the game.
Eleven forms the usual number on
a hockey team, although a less num
ber can play. The game has been
played very little in the West, but
is a familiar sport in Colorado and
in the North. It is a very popular
game throughout the East, where
many of the schools and colleges
have well organized teams.
