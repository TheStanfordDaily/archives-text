The"Daily Palo Alto" tonight

staff of the paper. We take pleasure
in publishing the following additions:

geles; E. C. Boobar, '10, of San Fran
cisco; W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, of San
Mateo; W. J. Telfer, '09, of San Jose;
and L. Merriman, '10, of Palo Alto.
These successful contestants have
done faithful work during the period
of try-out, and are all qualified for
membership on the"Daily Palo Al
to" staff. With this issue H. L.
Rixford, '09, and J. K. Hutchinson,

to the associate staff.
H. F. Bruning, *09, tonight resigns
from the staff of the paper after a
period of excellent service, because
of the pressure of other work. We
regret the loss of his services and
wish to thank him for his work in
the interests of the"Daily Palo Alto."
