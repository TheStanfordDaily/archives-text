Editor "Daily Palo Alto":â€”
Encina Hall men have noticed, and
in no inconsiderable number of cases
have been unpleasantly reminded,
that a new rule is governing the pay
ment of rent in the dormitory. The
verdict of all the men who have given
the matter thought is that it is inex
plicable why a custom long estab
lished and found efficient should be
superceded by an apparently unneed
ed change and ojie, moreover, well cal
culated to bring inconvenience to all,
and in some cases, financial loss, to
llall men. Prior to the present year
rent was payable between the sth and
icth of each month, and the regula
tion was well adapted to the needs of
Encina men, who in nearly all cases
receive their allowances on or a few
days after the sth. Now that it is
demanded that rent be paid during
the first five days under penalty of
expulsion from the Hall, it means
that much troublesome borrowing has
to be done around the first of each
month. Some have not yet made in
timate friends, while perhaps the cre
dit of others is doubtful. Further
more, a man leaving the Hall form
erly had the first four days in which
to remove his belongings, but now
if all his possessions arc not out of
his room on the first he is charged
for the room for the entire month,
though occupying it but a day. And,
again, it takes the clerk three times
as long to make out receipts as it
did previously, owing to the fact that
the bills can not be made out before
the day of payment. Much wonder
ment is afloat in Encina as to the
cause of this onslaught of inconven
ience and annoyance. This might not
be an improper subject to be taken
up at the next meeting of the Presi
dent's Conference.
