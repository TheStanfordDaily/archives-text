# Will Try Songs on Bleachers.
## 
### 
The new songs will be tried on the
bleachers tomorrow afternoon at the
regular practice. The Glee Club has
become thoroughly acquainted with
the music and words and will assist
the rooting section in learning them.
After they have been given a fair
trial the iirst and second prizes will
be decided upon. The songs are as
follows:
"A Song to the Stanford Spirit,"
L. S. Levy, 'oS; "Stanford Spirit," P.
X. Hartzell, '07; "Cheer for Old
Stanford," R. J. Will, '08; "Stanford
All Glorious," A. B. Packard, '07 and
B. Thompson, '07.
