The first Encina "At Home," held
Saturday evening, was one oif the
most enjoyable ever given by Encina
Club. The event was well attended
and the entire program of twenty
dances was thoroughly enjoyed. The
decorations were simple, the corners
of the club-room and stairways be
ing banked with potted palms.
