# MENAGERIE FOR CIRCUS.
## Seniors Plan Novel Feature in Animal Competition. 
### 
The Senior Circus Committee has
decided to introduce a novel feature
at the circus in the way of a mena
gerie, the animals being gotten up
by the different fraternities and by
Encina Hall. Each fraternity will be
allowed to enter one animal, and En
cina Hall one or more, and to the
organization contributing the most
original and best carried out exhibit,
a prize will be given. At a certain
part of the programme, the animals
will be brought out in a procession
around the field, and the prize will be
awarded by several judges.
Owing to the expressed desire on
the part of the women of the Senior
class to aid in the success of the
circus, the committee decided to
have the refreshment booths decor
ated in an attractive way, and place
them in charge of the women for that
evening. In this way an opportun
ity will be given for every person to
contribute toward the success of the
circus. Any member of the Senior
class who has any good "stunt"
which might be of use is asked to
give the suggestion to the members
of the committee. Every man in
tin* class is expected to take part in
the parade and every one should pre
pare some feature and report to R.
