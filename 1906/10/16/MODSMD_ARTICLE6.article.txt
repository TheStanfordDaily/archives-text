# PLUG-UGLY SELECTED
## PLAY BY L.S. LEVY, '08, WINS FIRST PRIZE. Date of Production Not Set.â€”Plugs Will Cost More Than in the Past. 
### 
The Plug Ugly committee met last
night and awarded the first prize for
this year's Plug Ugly to L. S. Levy,
08, his play, "The Fleecers,"' being
considered by the committee to be
the best of the manuscripts handed
in this year. Nothing is known as
yet concerning the plot other than
the fact that it deals with local con
ditions.
The committee will meet again dur
ing the week to pick the cast, which
will immediately begin rehearsals.
Levy will be asked to take charge
and direct the actual work done to
wards preparing the play for presen
tation.
'I he author lias been prominent in
college li'.erary circles, and at pres
ent is 011 the "Chaparral" staff and al
so a member of the 1908 "Quad"
board. He was also the author of
one of the prize football songs last
year.
The date for the production of
the Plug Ugly has not yet been set
owing to the difficulty in getting the
plugs in time. It is impossible to
obtain them on the Coast and an
endeavor was made to purchase them
in the East, but this failed owing to
the fact that the Felt-workers Union
has refused to turn out any more
felt campaign hats similar to those
used for the Plug Ugly. This makes
it necessary to putin a special order
for woolen hats, and also increases
the price to $1.75, against 90 cents
paid for felt hats in the past. The
committee enedavorcd to get cheap
er hats, but it was found to be im
possible to do so. Furthermore it
has been necessary to place a special
order for the hats and it will take
at least three weeks to turn them
out. The express company will not
guarantee to get the shipment here
from the East inside of ten days, so
the class cannot hope to produce the
play inside of four or five weeks at
the very earliest. This will bring
the time of production after the var
sity football game and before the
Senior Circus, or about ten days later
than the time that the Plug Ugly
was produced last year.
