# SQUADS REORGANIZED
## TWO TEAMS AND SUBSTITUTES OUT FOR VARSITY. Reds and Blacks Show Tendency to Forward Passing in Latest Practice. 
### 
With the majority of the Fresh
men off the lield, the coaches have
settled down to the task of whipping
the Varsity into shape before No
vember 10th. There was a hard
scrum last night between the Reds
and Blacks resulting in 110 score for
either side. Both teams played hard
Rugby and there was far too much
forward passing and off-side play.

and the varsity candidates have been
divided into two fifteens, the Reds
and the Blacks, with substitutes for
each team. The men line up as fol
