# INTEREST AT ASSEMBLY
## ROBERT E. SPEER AND LUTHER BURBANK MAKE ADDRESSES. Noted Horticulturist and Speaker from East Make Third Gathering Decided Success. 
### 
The third assembly of the se
mester, held this morning at the
third hour in Assembly Hall, was one
of the most interesting on record.
The principal speaker at the gather
ing was Robert K. Speer ot Prince
ton, '89, and it was largely due to
his address that the assembly was
a success. Luther Burbank, the not
ed horticulturalist, also appeared and
made a few valuable remarks to the
students. The auditorium was un
usually well filled.
Speer is a graduate of Princeton
University and at present holds an
influential position in missionary
work, being one of the secretaries of
the Presbyterian Board of Foreign
Missions. He chose as his subject,
"Margins of Life," and in his speech
dwelt uj 011 the various phases of the
life into which the question of a mar
gin entered.
In introducing his topic Speer
stated that in this age of tolerance
many are allowed to openly confess
their unbeliefs but few have the cour
age to- express their convictions. He
went on to say that in choosing his
subject that its context would be in
part religious but that many would
hardly expect from the subject that
such was the fact as margins enter
largely into business transactions.
His examples of margins were to
the point. He showed that the boun
dary or margin between two condi
tions directly opposed was but poor
ly defined and to be on the safe side
it was best to stay at a great dis
tance from the boundary. He said
he believed that not many inten
tionally became intoxicated but that
the boundary between temperance
and intemperance was ill-defined and
many a man had failed to heed the
margin. To keep within an ample
margin one must abstain entirely.
"There are political, religious and
moral margins," stated Speer, "and to
be on the safe side keep away from
the margin. It is the damnation of
our business men of today that they
see how close they can come to the
margin of dishonesty and illegality
without going over the edge.''
He said that no man was too
strong to be exempt from the warn
ing and that the man who considered
himself strong enough to resist and
capable of approaching the margin
was in greater danger than his weak
er brother. To illustrate this point,
he told of the consternation that
would be caused by a single misdeed
upon the part of President Roosevelt
as compared with a single falsehood
of "Abe" Hummel, the notorious
criminal lawyer of New York. He
showed how the act of Hummel could
not lower his status in society while
the same slip upon the part of the
executive of the country would cause
universal distrust. He advised stu
dents to give a wide margin to any
debatable subjcct.
