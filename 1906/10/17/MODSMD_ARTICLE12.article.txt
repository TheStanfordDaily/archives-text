Tl â€¢ ret anization of the Women's
i i..Lie is i t one instance of the
p eworthy . terest being display
ec; ii co' ge : tivities this semester
b} the wo v:: of tlie Univrsity. It
has been several years since such gen
eral and acute purpose on the part
of the women students has been prev
alent, and the renewed attitude is a
very commendable one. It is hoped
that the meeting of the women to
morrow at Roble Hall will be well
attended in order that the plans of
the Women's League may be given
the consideration due them. The
women students are now in a posi
tion to accomplish large results, and
will undoubtedly do so if the pres
ent interest in the support of ath
letic and other activities continues.
