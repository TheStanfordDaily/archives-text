# Varsity Plays Good Rugby.
## 
### 
The varsity Reds and Clacks lined
up last night for a fifteen minute
scrum. Both teams played good Rug
by the Red forwards breaking out of
the scrum fast, and the backs getting
behind each other well, passing clean
and accurately. The Blacks were on
the defense practically during the en
tire game, but put up a stubborn
fight, their goal line being crossed
for two tries.
