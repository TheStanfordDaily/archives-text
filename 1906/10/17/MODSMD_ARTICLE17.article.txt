Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
May I ask the courtesy of your
columns for an appeal to our Stan
ford community. Many of us re
member the late Masashi oshimi.
His death in San Francisco two
weeks ago was a peculiarly sad one.
He leaves a wife in Japan who has
been working to support herself and
their child while he was struggling
for an education here, lie completed
the course in Education at Stanford
in 05 and last May he received the
Master's degree at the University of
California, lie was, therefore, just
ready to begin remunerative work and
had entered upon it when sickness
and death intervened. 11 is last ex
penses were borne by relatives in
the city who were ill able to bear
them. The Japanese Student's Asso
ciation of Stanford are raising among
themselves a fund to send to the
widow in Tokio. If there are any
friends of Mr. Yoshimi or sympathiz
ers who would like to assist, their
contributions would be gladly receiv
ed by S. Anju, president of the above
association, or by the undersigned.
To help in such a cause is to express
sympathy in a practical form, for it
will enable a poor widow to become
self-supporting.
It is proposed to send the fund
subscribed to Mr. Fukukita, a Stan
ford graduate, now translator at the
American consulate at Tokio, who
will administer it to the best ad
vantage.
