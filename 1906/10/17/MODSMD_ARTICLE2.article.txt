# LEAGUE WILL MEET
## WOMEN STUDENTS TO REORGANIZE AT ROBLE. Club-house Plan To Be Discussed and Officers Nominated at First Regular Meeting. 
### 
The first regular meeting of the
Women's League is to be held in
the parlors at Roble Hall on Thurs
day, October 18th, at four-thirty.
The nomination committee will re
port on the officers for the ensuing
year, and action will be taken on a
proposed revision of the constitution.
Miss Alice Kimball, 04, will speak
on the aims of the organization, and
on the plan of officially undertaking,
in conjunction with a committee of
the Women's Conference, the build
ing of a women's clubhouse.
The Women's League was organ
ized 011 January .24, 1902, under the
leadership of Mrs. Jordan, with the
chief purpose of bringing all the
women of the University in close
touch with each other, thereby giving
an impulse, by means of a broader
acquaintance, to all branches of
women's activities. With this almost
purely social aim, the Women's
League was very successful, until the
rule was passed that no outside or
ganization could meet at Roble.
Two years ago the last meeting at
Roble was held, and from that time,
for lack of a social meeting place,
the League has been almost inactive.
Through a petition from the Wom
en's Conference, permission has been
granted for meetings to be held
monthly at Roble, thereby assuring
the reorganization and former activ
ity of the Women's League. The
project of a women's clubhouse was
first proposed in a meeting over two
years ago, but never acted upon.
