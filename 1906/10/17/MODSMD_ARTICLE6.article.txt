# BURBANK GIVES TALK
## ADDRESSES FACULTY ON WORK WITH PLANTS. Selection and Hybridization With Examples from Cactus and Poppy Described. 
### 
Luther Burbank addressed the
members of the faculty last evening
on his work in plant selection and
hybridization. His talk was in part
as follows ;
"In the cross of the California
black walnut and the English walnu:
yon get twice as many leaves as in
the English walnut, and some of the
trees grow three or four inches in
height, some three or four feet. In
the second generation some of the
hybrid walnut trees grow five hun
dred times as fast as ordinary trees."
In speaking of his experiments with
the poppy, he said:
"I crossed the common opium pop
py with the oriental poppy. The lat
ter has mullein like leaves and the
flower is snow white. The result ob
tained was a brilliant crimson flower,
the Colorado poppy."
The method of securing a good
chestnut by crossing:
'*1 crossed the Japanese chestnut,
the European and the American. One
little seedling produced nuts. 1
planted it in the spring and the next
fall found a bunch of nuts on it. 1
then grafted these onto a full-grown
tree and was able to secure the nuts
almost at once.
"You usually have to wait sixteen
or eighteen years but in this manner
1 obtained them in a season and they
bore all the year round. Some peo
ple cannot eat the English walnut
011 account of the biter taste due to
a skin surrounding the meat. By
constant experiments in grafting I
obtained a tree bearing nuts with
white meat and no bitter tas'e what
ever."
Relating to the matter of grafting
into old trees, he stated:
"I have an apple tree with 526 dif
ferent kinds of apples and a plum
tree with four hundred different va
rieties. Thus I can accomplish my
experiments without the use of a
large number of acres of land.
The dehorning of the cactus was
an interesting topic:
"There are little bundles of needle
like forms, four or five hundred in
a bunch, scattered all over the leaves
and fruit of the cactus. The larger
ones can be burned off with gaso
line but these little spicules cannot.
Cattle die of eating them. I have
a plant at home, one of the leaves of
which is estimated to weigh 1000
pounds. A lucious fruit can be pro
duced upon it. The plant can be
grown in North America, and in
Mexico. The larger varieties will nor
grow farther north than the state
of Washington, but I have a variety
which will grow in Alaska.
"The cross between the sweet ami
sour apple is interesting as the re
sult obtained is that one-half is sweet
and one-half sour. Sometimes, one
quarter of the apple will be sweet
and' the remainder sour. The sweet
part is always red while the sour i*
yellow.

"There has been a stenclcss plum
in Europe for the last 200 years but
it has a pit in it no larger than a
pea. 1 crossed this with the French
prune and now 1 have a whole variety
of them without stones."
