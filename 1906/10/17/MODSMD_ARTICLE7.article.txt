# FRESHMEN NOT BARRED
## STANFORD HAS AS YET TAKEN NO ACTION. California Excluded Her First-Year Men by Ruling Made Last Semester. 
### 
California lias barred Freshmen
from her varsity teams; Stanford
has as yet taken no such action.
Such is the true status at present of
the eligibility of the first year men,
which lias been creating so much dis
cussion among the student bodies of
both universities.
California's action was taken last
April shortly after the meeting of the
joint conference, which adopted Rug
by football, and was based upon the
recommendations of this conference.
These recommendations were re
ferred to the faculties of the two
universities for final action.
On April 13th, Colonel Edwards
notified the Stanford Faculty Athletic
Committee that California had barred
first year men from varsity athletics.
A meeting of the Stanford committee
was called for that same week to
consider the State University's ac
tion, but before it was held the earth
quake brought the semester to an
end.
Stanford's faculty committee will
meet very soon to consider Califor
nia's ruling and take some acti' it
upon it, but as the matter now
stands Stanford's Freshmen are eligi
ble to compete for varsity teams.
