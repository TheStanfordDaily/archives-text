# New Automobile Entrance Planned.
## 
### 
The surveying of a new entrance
for the automobile road, at present
running from the main entrance, has
been completed, and the entrance will
probably be built before winter.
At present the road begins just
to the left of the main entrance and
runs to a point near the faculty club
house. According to present plans,
the new entrance will be placed to
the east of the main gate, leaving the
county road at right-angles, and then
swinging to the left until it meets
the road already constructed. This
new gate will be the means of keep
ing the main entrance free for ve
hicles. The work of grading will
probably begin in the near future.
