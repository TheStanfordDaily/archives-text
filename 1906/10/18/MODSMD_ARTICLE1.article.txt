# CONTROL BY STUDENTS
## MEMBERS OF ENCINA CLUB TO GOVERN THEMSELVES. Dicipline of Men's Dormitory Will Be in Hands of Upperclass-men Committee. 
### 
A system of student control, giving
seven upper classmen the entire con
trol over all affairs relating to dis
cipline in Encina Hall, was adopted
and incorporated into the constitu
tion of Encina Club last evening. The
amendments to the club constitution,
giving for the first time the govern
ment of the big dormitory into the
hands of the students themselves, are
worded as follows:
Section I. —The officers of this
club shall be a president, a board of
directors, and a house committee.
Section 2. —The house committee
shall consist of the president of the
club, who shall be cx-officio chairman
of the committee, and six upper
classmen who shall be elected in the
manner provided for in Article 3,
Section i. It shall be the duty of
the committee to control all matters
concerning the peace, good order, and
honor of Encina Hall; to control the
membership of the club; in general
to deal with the general welfare and
comfort of the club members.
Article 3, Section 1. —The officers
of the club shall be elected by bal
lot on the Wednesday two weeks
preceding the last Wednesday of
each semester. * * * The house
committee shall be chosen by the
members of the three upper classes,
and shall be elected as follows:
three members from the Junior class
at the fall semester election; three
members from the incoming Senior
class at the spring semester election.
The term of office for the members
of the house committee shall be one
year.
Section 3. —111 case of a vacancy
occurring in the house committee the
president shall call a special election
for the purpose of electing a member
to fill such vacancy. The member so
elected shall serve out the balance
of the unexpired term."
It is the purpose of the amend
ments to provide a quiet, efficient
body of representative men who will
be able to control the hall without
public dismissals and by means of
influence more than punishments. 111
all cases the committee will go to
the man charged, when action is nec
essary, instead of bringing him up
for examination.
The question of new eating facili
ties was discussed at last night's
meeting, and G. J. Presley, '07, sub
mitted to the members of the club
two solutions proposed by President
Jordan at the last meeting of the
President's Conference. The iirst was
a plan to let the University build a
number of cottages somewhere near
Encina, and to rent these cottages to
co-operative clubs, thus bringing the
eating facilities of College Terrace
to the campus. The second proposi
tion was a plan to turn over the Inn
to the members of the club to be con
ducted by them as one large eating
club, no rent to be charged by the
University.

These two plans were placed before
the clubs for the members to choose
from, with the understanding that the
one selected should be favorably re
ported to the Board of Trustees by
Dr. Jordan. The club was unani
mously in favor of the first plan,
which was selected without opposi
tion.
The election of the upperclassmeri
to fill the house committee, provided
by the new system of control, was to
have been held last evening, but on
account of the poor attendance, the
election was postponed until tonight.
