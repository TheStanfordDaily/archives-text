Editor '"Daily Palo Alto":
A large and eager audience gather
ed last night to witness the perform
ance of "Hedda Gabler," one of Ib
sen's most serious and subtle plays.
But what we were treated to was a
farce, a lamentable misinterpretation
and in parts a wilful distortion of a
serious drama.
Whatever our personal attitude to
wards Ibsen may be we must ac
knowledge that his dramas are works
of art —and art is always a serious
thing. To see sn?h a work of art
degraded before an audience hungry
for the best and capable of appreciat
ing it, is something that should not
be allowed to pass by without being
branded as it deserves.
