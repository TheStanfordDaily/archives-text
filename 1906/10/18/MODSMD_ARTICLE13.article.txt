It has been decided that Encina
Hall is to be controlled by the up
perclassmen. This is a matter that
has long been desired and at a meet
ing of Encina Club held last night
the members voted to have all affairs
of the Hall regulated by a committee
of upperclassmen. There are to be
seven members of this body, whirli
will be known as the house com
mittee. The committee will be com
posed of the president of the club,
three Seniors, and three Juniors. The
president of the club will be elected
at the general election of the mem
bers of the club, but the remaining
six members of the house com.ml tec
will be chosen at a special election
at which the Freshmen in the club
will have 110 vote. In this way the
members of this most important com
mittee will be elected by the men who
really understand the affairs of the
Hall. It is evident that the success
of this proposed uppcrclass control in
the Hall will depend almost entirely
upon the character of the men on the
house committee. Therefore the
greatest care should be exercised in
the selection of the members of this
committee. This is the first time that
upperclassmen have been given an
opportunity to control affairs in the
Hall and the outcome will be closely
watched by the University commun
ity.
