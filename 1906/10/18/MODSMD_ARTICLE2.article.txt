# TO CONFER TOMORROW
## TRUSTEES WILL DISCUSS DISBARMENT OF FRESHMEN. Difficulty Is One of Differing Interpretations of Football Conference's Report. 
### 
Representatives of the Faculty
Athletic Committees of Stanford and
California will meet tomorrow at the
State University to settle once and
for all the question of the eligibility
of Freshmen for Varsity teams 'J he
Stanford committee met yesterday
and decided to arrange the conference
with California's representatives, in
order to end the misundersU.id>ng
which has arisen from the different
interpretations of the resolutions of
last semester's football conference.
Stanford's representatives have nut
been announced but they will probably
be chosen from the Faculty Athlctic
Committee. The members of this
body are Professors Angell, Wi.ig,
Durand, Snow and Searles. No word
has been received from California re
garding the men who will confer w' li
the Stanford delegates.
Should California refuse to recede
from her interpretation of the con
ference report, which bars first year
men from varsity athletics, Stanford
will be placed in a very difficult posi
tion. She must either yield to the
California ruling, or she must strnd
by the present arrangement here and
refuse to exclude her Freshmen. In
the latter alternative matters would be
deadlocked and as a result ai.hici.ic
relations between the two universities
would probably be broken off.
It is believed, however, that no
such alarming results need to be
feared. Stanford seems to favor the
continuation of the rules which have
prevailed in the past, but since the
difficulty is one of interpretation
alone, an amicable settlement will
probably be reached.
