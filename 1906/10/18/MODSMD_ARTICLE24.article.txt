Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
The Committee on Public Enter
tainments wishes to express its grati
tude to Sword and Sandals for very
valuable assistance rendered in the
presentation of Hedda Gabler last
night. The efficiency of the men of
our dramatic club may be gathered
from the following entirely volun
tary declaration of Mrs. Crawley: "I
have never had the stage work better
attended to even by professionals in
the business. The committee is also
very grateful to the McKibben Fur
niture Company, of Palo Alto, for
its generous loan of stage furnishings.
We regret the delay in beginning
the entertainment, but it was due to
the fact that so many people had ne
glected -to procure tickets before
hand. This caused an unprecedented
sale at the door, making it impossible
for the players to begin.
C. SEARLES,
Chairman Committee on Public En
tertainments.
