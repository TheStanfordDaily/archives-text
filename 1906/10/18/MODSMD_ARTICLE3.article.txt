# Mandolin Club May Disband.
## 
### 
A meeting of the Mandolin Club
will be held this evening to consider
the matter of disorganizing. Tues
day night the Mandolin Club held its
final try-out and the lack of good
material, together with the absence
of the older players, has led to the
consideration of disbanding. The
present club has but twelve mem
bers. Graduate Manager Sales stated
that the disbanding of the Mandolin
Club would ruin any chances of a
trip for the Combined Clubs, as it
would not be deemed profitable.
