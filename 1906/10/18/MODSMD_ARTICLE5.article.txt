# Memorial Church Roofed Over.
## 
### 
The roofing over of Memorial
Church has practically been com
pleted, only a small amount of work
remaining to be done, such as the
boarding in of the corners. The scaf
folding on the inside is being re
moved. The new roof will be cover
ed with rubcroid for the present as
a protection from rains.
No attempt has been made as yet
to putin a new flooring, much of
which was torn away when the roof
of the church fell in. It is unlike
ly that anything will be done in the
near future until more definite plans
have been formed.
