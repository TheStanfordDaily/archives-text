# "Sequoia" on Sale Next Monday.
## 
### 
The October issue of the "Se
quoia" which will go on sale next
Monday is replete with interesting
features. W. F. Herron, '08, the act
ing editor, comments forcibly upon
co-education, proof-stealing, and the
"rough-housing" of Plug-Uglies.
Numerous articles upon vitally im
portant questions are also contained
in the edition, notably two, from dif
ferent standpoints, upon the disad
vantages of co-education. Harold
Fitch, '07, contributes "Two Miles to
Lunch." The verse and prose of the
number is excellent as is the cover,
drawn by V. F. Bellows, '09, and
completed in three colors. Dug Fer
ry, '08, also contributes three inter
esting cartoons.
