### 
The second step toward student
control in oncina Hall was taken last
evening when the lyembers of Encina
Club elected six upperclassmen to the
new student disciplinary body, the
house committee. The following
men, with the addition of J. X. Stan
ford, 07, who as president of the
club, will act as ex-ofticio chairman,
will compose the new committee:
Seniors—G. Knupp, II. K. Savage,
and J. E. Stewart; Juniors —C. C.
Johnson, W. C. Thiele and J. F.
Reilly.
The committee has as yet 113 defi
nite plans, but will assemble in the
next few days to consider their pol
icy and their method of procedure.
It seems to be the general sentiment
of the men, following out the general
directions, in the recently adopted
amendments, that the committee will
make 110 attempt to lay down any
definite laws to govern the discipline
in the hall, but will meet each indi
vidual case as it arises with the ap
propriate remedy, thus developing a
mass of customs and traditions by
which future committees may be
guided, and which will be greatly su
perior, because of its elasticity, to
any laid and fa'st rules.
The new body will not meet regu
larly, but only when action or con
sultation is necessary because of
some offense by a member of the
club. In their first action for which
there exists 110 precedent, the com
mittee will look at all cases from the
standpoint of gentlemanly conduct.
