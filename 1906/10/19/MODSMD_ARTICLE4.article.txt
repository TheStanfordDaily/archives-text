The first intercollegiate varsity
game-of the season will be played on
Stanford Field tomorrow afternoon
3:30, when the Cardinal fifteen will
line up against the Rugby team from
the University of Nevada. This is
the first outside game that the var
sity lias played this season and its
outcome will be watched with great
interest as giving the first good line
011 the development of the varsity fif
teen. At the old game Nevada al
ways sent down strong teams, and
their first Rugby aggregation is re
ported to be no exception to the scl
eral rule. The Sagebrushers have
been coached by Cameron, an old
New Zealand star, and reports from
Reno state that they play the fast
passing game which characterized the
play of the New Zealand champions.
This more open form of game is the
one which the varsity has been prac
tising hardest and tomorrow's game
should result in a very spectacular
exhibit ion.
The Cardinal line-up tomorrow is
practically that of the Red team
which lias been playing together all
week and on the form which they
have been slu-wing it <eeir.s hardly
possible that Nevada can win. Rug
by, however, is such an uncertain
quantity that it is impossible to ven
ture any predictions 011 the probable
score. Next week Nevada will meet
California at Berkeley and these
games will form the first basis of
comparison between file two 'earns
The Mine and Gold fifteen left for
Los Angeles yesterday and will play
Pomona tomorrow. Next week Stan
ford will make the Southern trip and
these two games, taken in connec
tion with the Nevada contests should
give the student body a fair idea of
the outcome of the big game.

fully in the Freshman game, will refe
ree tomorrow's contest. E. J. Nash.
