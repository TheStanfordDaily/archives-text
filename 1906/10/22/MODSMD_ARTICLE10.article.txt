The war of words between the
"Chaparral" and the "Sequoia" has
passed the bounds of the humorous
or clever and has assumed an offen
sive aspect. As is usual in cases of
this kind, it is the general public
who is the sufferer, in this instance
the student body, who are compelled
to hear men, presumed to have suf
ficient common sense to know better,
air their personal and political griev
ances. The "Chaparral," although a
private corporation and not under
student body control, still represents
the University, and has not the right
to engage in offensive personal at
tacks. It is very regretable that a
periodical, which once contained
some of Stanford's best literature,
written by some of Stanford's ablest
men should be dragged down to so
low a level to revenge the petty and
personal dislikes of one man. With
the "Sequoia" the responsibility is
clearer and the offense is .therefore
greater. The "Sequoia" is a student
body paper, with an editor elected by
the student body and supposedly as
responsible to the student body as
any other officers of that organiza
tion. It would not appear to be part
of an acting editor's prerogatives to
answer personal attacks in kind
through the columns of his paper.
The excuse that the "Chaparral" be
gan the attack is no excuse at all.
That might justify a demand for rep
aration made in person, but in can
not justify personal recrimination in
the columns of an official student
body organ. Looking at the ques
tion from another standpoint, there
is urgent reason for a cessation of
these personalities. Both periodicals
have a circulation that is not limit
ed to the Stanford campus. They go
to the outside world as representa
tives of Stanford thought and Stan
ford opinion. It is not the part of
two Stanford men to present as the
best of this thought and opinion a
childish effort at mutual vituperation.
It is not the part of two Stanford
men to present as the essence of the
Stanford spirit the endeavor to sur
pass each other in the grossest of
personalities.
