# HOUSE COMMITTEE MEETS.
## New Organizing Body to Confer With Encina Men. 
### 
The recently elected house com
mittee of Encina Hall met yesterday
and discussed, in a general way,
plans for the control of the Hall. It
appeared to be the sense of the meet
ing that while no body of rules
should be compiled, the committee
has certain requests to make to the
men living in the dormitory which
would greatly aid toward a good un
derstanding between the new com
mittee and those subject to their
legislation.
The order to discuss these affairs
and to bring before the club the gen
eral improvement in the discipline
of the Hall, President J. N. Stanford,
'07, will call a meeting within the
next few days.
