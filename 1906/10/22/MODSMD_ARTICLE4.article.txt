# STANFORD, II ; NEVADA, 0.
## Cardinal Defeats the Sagebrushers In the Fastest Game of the Season. 
### 
In a fast, clean game Stanford de
feated Nevada on Saturday afternoon
by the score of n-o. Two tries were
made in tlie first half by Captain
Stott, one of which l'enton converted
into a goal, and in the second period
of play the Cardinal full-back again
put the ball between the posts from
a penalty kick. The Varsity played
in the best form which they have
shown this season. The passing of
the backs was fast and accurate and
the scrum hardly ever failed to work
out the ball into Owen's hands. Ne
vada played a plucky game and show
ed surprisingly good form for the
short time in which they have been
practicing Rugby, but they were so
far outclassed in the scrum that
their backs never had a chance to
demonstrate what they could do.
There was very little penalizing
in the game and from the spectators'
point of view it was a far more sat
isfactory exhibition than the Fresh
man intercollegiate last Saturday.
There was still a tendency, however,
on the part, of the Stanford back:,
to forward passing and to throwing
the ball away when they were
tackled. Molman and Chalmers were
the chief offenders in this and both
of them spoiled several good gains
which they had made by tossing the
ball away after they were downed to
some Nevada man, who would run it
back for a gain.
Only twice was the Cardinal goal
line in danger. Once in the first half
when Magee broke loose from the
scrum and gained thirty yards only
only to run fairly into Fen
ton's arms. Again in the second
half, the Sagebrushers dribbled down
to the three yard line. Here Stanford
was off-side and Magee tried for a
place kick from the fifteen yard line
but missed. This was the last
chance that the Blue and White had
to score.
Stott, Fenton and Cook played a
star game for Stanford in the back
field and Molfino and Koerncr show
ed up well in the Cardinal scrum.
For Nevada Magee at five, was un
doubtedly the star of the day. His
punting and running were sensational
and lie made most of the gains for
the visitors. Hart in the scrum put
up a strong game.
Coach Lanagan was very much
pleased with the showing of the
Varsity and Referee Unmack declar
ed that it was the best Rugby play
ing lie had seen so far in California.
Stanford substituted Presley for
Heinlcy, Rogers for Pemberton and
Laumcister for Owen in the second
half. Nevada played through the
game with the same line-up. The
detail of play follows:
Stanford was off-side on her kick
off and the ball was putin play in
the center of the field. Stanford
dribbled for a good gain. Nevada
was offside and Fenton tried a place
kick from the forty yard line but

failed. A moment later Stanford
was off-side and Magee had a chance
at a field goal but his try also fell
short. Stott carried the ball twenty
yards. Clever dribbling by Chalmers
netted twenty more, but a free kick
for Nevada prevented a try. Again
Stanford dribbled down to the
twenty-five yard line. Pemberton ad
vanced fifteen. Nevada was off-side
and Fenton took the ball back and
tried a hard goal but missed. From
the kick-out Chalmers rushed the
ball back thirty yards and Stott ad
vanced it ten more. Stanford drove
the ball out of bounds for a five yard
gain and on the throw-in Stott went
through for ten yards and a try. Feu
ton kicked the goal. Score —Stanford
