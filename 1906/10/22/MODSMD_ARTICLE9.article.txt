MONDAY. OCTOBER 22, 1906

I The Nevada game Saturday was
the most poorly attended of the sea- I
son, and the women on the bleachers J
were noticeably few. The fact that
the weather was bad cannot be of
fered as an excuse for this lamentable
lack of interest, since two function-;
given by the two most prominent of
the women's organizations during the
same hours were largely attended.
The reception by Cap and Gown, as
well as the lecture under the auspices
of the Young Women's Christian As
sociation. might without any great
inconvenience have been held at .some i
other more opportune time. The
first named organization we assume j
to have been formed to include m its
purposes the fostering of Stanford
Spirit, and the young women of the
Christian Association \ve believe
would not, in their thoughtful mo
ments, violate the best inteie,-ts of
j the student body. \Ye hope that in
I the future the women will e:.ercise
i more care in selecting the dates of
their meetings, since it appears that
these are of greater importance lo
them than the support of Stanford's
i teams
