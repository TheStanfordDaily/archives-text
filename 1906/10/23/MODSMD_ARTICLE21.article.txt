# Changes Made in Library.
## 
### 
The periodicals in the Library have
been shifted into the front room of
the right wing, which formerly con
tained the Hopkins Railroad Library,
and this room, in charge of Miss
Miles, is being remodelled and fur
nished artistically in mission wood.
A new room in the basement is to
be devoted to documentary history.
