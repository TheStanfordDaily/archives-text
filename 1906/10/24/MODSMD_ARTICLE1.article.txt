# NO TRIP THIS YEAR
## COMBINED CLUBS VOTE TO STAY AT HOME. Lack of Suitable Material Given As Reason.â€”Clubs Will Not Disband. 
### 
At a meeting of the Combined
Musical Clubs held last evening it
was decided to give up plans for mak
ing any trip during tlie Christmas
vacation. This decision is due to the
fact that so little suitable material has
come out for the clubs this year, es
pecially in the case of the Mandolin
Club. It was felt by those in charge,
that the clubs would not be represen
tative of the University and it would
be better to remain at home. Mat
ters were in such a state that some
radical action had'to be determined
upon. A communication has been
drawn up by the two leaders and the
president of the combined clubs,
which sets forth definitely the rea
sons for giving up the trip. The com
munication is as follows:
"The action of the Combined Clubs
in voting last evening to give up the
intended vacation trips this year was
only taken after very careful con
sideration.
"It has been found impossible dur
ing the present year to interest the
good material in college and, as a con
sequence, after the second try-out
there remained far from enough eligi
ble men 011 the Mandolin Club to
make the intended trip successful,
and, realizing that it is far better
to stay at home with scanty material
than to appear before the public in
the guise of a thoroughly representa
tive student body organization, the
Combined Clubs unanimously voted
to give up the trip.
"The Clubs will not disband, but 011
the contrary will practice as usual
and try to carry out the established
policy of the past two years by ap
pearing as often as possible before
the collcgc public."
