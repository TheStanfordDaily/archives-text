# BOAT CLUB ORGANIZED
## OBJECT IS TO PROMOTE STANFORD'S ROWING INTERESTS. Members Pledged To Raise Money for Murphy and To Buy Eight-Oared Shell. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club was re
vived last evening, being organized
to take the place of the old club,
which some time ago passed out of
active existence. The meeting was
called at the instance of Captain Fred
Zimmerman, '07, and the following
officers were elected: President, F.
W. Turner, '08; vice-president, R. H.
Conant, '08; treasurer, S. B. Dole, '09;
secretary, E. N. Smith, '08.
Committees were appointed by the
president to draw up by-laws and
constitution to conform with the gen
eral constitution of the National As
sociation of Amateur Oarsmen, with
which organization the Stanford club
hopes to become identified in the
near future, thereby securing official
recognition of work and races held
by Stanford.
Active work will be started im
mediately towards raising enough
money to buy an eight-oared shell
for this spring, and from the present
outlook it seems possible that enough
money can be raised from the Palo
Alto merchants and other sources to
buy a second-hand shell, which will
not cost over $250. At the same time
the club is considering ways to pay
off the old boat club debt of some
$350, and a committee was appointed
to look into the matter of having
some kind of an entertainment in the
near future which will aid in reduc
ing the sum. Efforts will be made
to free the club debt within a year.
In order to obtain Dan Murphy's
services as coach for the coining year,
the members of the club have person
ally agreed to raise enough money to
pay the difference between the
amount the Executive Committee will
pay Murphy, and the sum Murphy de
mands. This extra amount will be
about $35 per month, and so far
nearly thirty dollars has been
pledged.
The immediate objects of the pres
ent club will be to collect all the
property belonging to the old clubs,
to assume all obligations of the last
club, to retain Murphy as coach, and
in company with California, to buy
an eight-oared shell as soon as pos
sible.
The club will hold anotlier meeting
as soon as word is received from the
N. A. A. O. and the committee ap
pointed draws up a set of by-laws and
a constitution.
