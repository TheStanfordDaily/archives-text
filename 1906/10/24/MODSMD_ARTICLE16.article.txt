The action of the Combined Clubs !
in abandoning their proposed Christ- j
mas vacation trip, deserves the high- j
est praise, in view of the circum- ■
stances necessitating this step. It is j
to he deeply regretted that there is \
such a lack of interest on the part of
the mandolin players in college. This
lack of interest, although it does not
augur well for the future, is evident
ly not the fault of the men who are
directing the Mandolin club. Their
frank acceptance of the situation
shows that they realize the difficulties
under which they arc working, and
are ready to meet those difficulties
in the only possible way. They have
abandoned their annual trip, which
is practically the only reward for
their work, because they are unwil
ling to send out, under the Stanford
name, a club which is not up to the
standard of past years.
The history of the musical club
trips up to last year, has been one
of financial difficulties, and in some
cases, of gross misconduct on the
part of the men. These trips did
Stanford 110 good and there grew up
in the student body a feeling of dis
trust toward the clubs and their
members. Last year's successful trip
did much to dispel tliis feeling and
the action of the leaders this year in
refusing to take the trip with a poor
club, should completely restore the
student body's shaken confidence.
The announcement that the clubs
will not disband gives tTicm another
chance to show that this confidence
is justified. There will be many of
the student body assemblies before
the end of the semester and the ap
pearance of the clubs is always wel
comed at these gatherings.
