Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
The Social Service Club invites all
students and members of the faculty
to aid Prof. A. B. Show in mak
ing a complete record of the work of
the Stanford Relief and of the times
at the University immediately fol
lowing the earthquake. Interesting
personal experiences connected with
these times and statistics of various
kinds relating to the work of re
lief are asked for. These can be
submitted to Professor Show or
handed to me, in manuscript form.
Photographs or drawings also are
desired. In cases where it is found
inconvenient to submit manuscripts,
Professor Show has arranged with a
stenographer to take down from di
rect dictation important material. In
reference to any of these matters,
Professor Show can be consulted dur
ing his office hours on Monday and
Friday mornings, from 11:30 to 12:00
o'clock, in room 230. Arrangements
for submitting contributions of all
kinds should be made at once.
A history such as Professor Show
is working upon will be of very great
value in years to come when un
numbered generations of Stanford
students will read about the great
crisis through which we have just
passed, and, therefore, all who care
should make contributions. The his
tory, too, will record one of the
most brilliant periods in the annals of
Stanford men and women —a period
when the Stanford spirit found its
purest and most unselfish expression
—and ; t is our duty now, as well as
our privilege, to make the record as
complete as possible.
This semester material for the his
tory will be collected and arranged
by Professor Show, and next semes
ter the Social Service Club expects
to publish it in attractive and per
manent form.
