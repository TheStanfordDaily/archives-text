The announcement that the Alumni
will aga'u occupy the ccntral section
011 the bleachers at the intercollegiate
game will be the subjeci of consider
able comment among th undergrad
uates. The reasons given for this ac
tion by the graduate managers of
Stanford and California are conform
ance to custom and courtesy to 11n
former students of the two univer
sities. The student body has grum
bled for many seasons at this "cus
tom." particularly in the matter of
giving the general public preference
over the students in the selection of
seats. The games are played primar
ily for the undergraduates, who, as
the most interested spectators, should
get the best seats. The alumni
would doubtless be as well satisiied
with the seats it is now proposed to
give to the undergraduates, namely,
the section immediately joining the
seats of the graduates. The reserva
tion of this section for the rooters
will, however, be a concession over
the arrangements of previous years,
when the students have been forced
to sit near the end of the field, while
the better seats were given over to
the gneral public. It is to be hoped
that the managers will not allow an
opportunity to take in slightly larger
gate receipts to interfere with the best
remaining plan for the seating of
the rooters at the big game.
