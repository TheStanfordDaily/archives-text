# U.C. WINS FROM VANCOUVER.
## Coach Lanagan Declares Game "A Fine Exhibition of Rugby." 
### 
The California Rugby team yester
day defeated the Vancouver fifteen,
by a score of 5-0, after a hard, fast
game. The play on which the try
was made started near the center of
the field. After several passes Whit
man, the Berkeley three-quarters, got
the ball and made a fast forty-five
yard run, crossing the line.
Coach Lanagan saw the game and
spoke of it as follows: "Yester
day's game at Berkeley was the
best exhibition of Rugby 1 have ever
seen and was far above anything we
have had here. Naturally, the Brit
ishers, were by far the cleverer, but
they were greatly outweighed in the
scrum and, acordingly they could not
get possession of the ball. Still, in
the first half the advantage was with
them, but weight and condition gave
California all the better of the last
1 eriod. The play 011 which Berkeley
scored was one of the prettiest and
finest I have ever seen. The best
team won."
