Although the University is fast
recovering from the disastrous effects
of the catastrophe of April 18th,
many students persist in sending
away pictures of the "ruins" and ex
aggerated accounts of the damage to
be seen. This is a practice which
may well be discouraged. The gen
eral impression which prevails
throughout the country is that Stan
ford was practically destroyed by the
earthquake. For the good of the
University every opportunity to
counteract this opinion and reveal
our true condition should be taken
advantage of. The least to be done
in accomplishing this result is to re
frain from sending out photographs
or statements tending to give a false
idea of the University.
