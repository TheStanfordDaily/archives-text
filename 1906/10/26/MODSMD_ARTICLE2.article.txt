# STANFORD vs. POMONA
## CARDINAL FIFTEEN PLAYS TO-MORROW IN LOS ANGELES. Game Should Furnish Basis Of Comparison Between Stanford and California. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at Fiesta
Park, Los Angeles, Stanford will line
up against Pomona in the second in
tercollegiate game of the season. The
contest with the collegians is very
important, as it affords the first basis
of comparison between the Stanford
and California fifteens. Last week
the Blue and Gold defeated Pomona
6-0, scoring one try and one penalty
kick.
During the intervening week the
Southerners have been working hard
and reports from Los Angeles state
that their team work shows consider
able improvement. The Cardinal
fifteen has shown some improvement
in its scrummage work since the Ne
vada game, especially in the passing
of tlie back-field and in getting the
ball out of scrum.
Pomona plays the same line-up as
against California last week and Stan
ford will have the team which de
feated Nevada. If the improvement
of both teams has been consistent, to
morrow's game should result in a
small score victory for the Cardinal
or else in a tie. At all events it will
be a fair basis for a comparison of
the work of Stanford and California.
Pat Higgins, an old Australian star,
who is coaching the Rugby team of
the Pasadena Polytechnic School,
will probably referee the contest.
Higgins understands the game thor
oughly and should make a capable
official.
This is the first time that Stanford
has played football against Pomona.
They have competed twice on the
track, both meets resulting in vic
tories for the Cardinal:
The line-up follows:
Pomona Stanford.
