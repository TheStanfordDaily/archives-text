The"Daily Palo Alto" is in receipt
of the following letter:
"Editor "Daily Palo Alto".
"A fact which is probably not known
at Stanford is that E. W. Darling, ex
'o6, the "nature man," who has until
recently been living in the South
Sea Islands, has discovered what ap
pears to be an entirely new and un
heard of species of animal.
The British consul at Tahiti has
become so greatly interested in the
discovery that through his efforts the
British Museum has made Mr. Dar
ling an ofifer for one of the animals
and he is now about to start on the
trip to England, via America, bring
ing with him the pzaha semnopithe
cus, as the new animal is to be called.
S. H. A., '03.
Tahiti, September 10, 1906."
