# TO PLAY FINAL ROUND
## JUNIORS AND FRESHMEN TO DECIDE CHAMPIONSHIP. Delano and Gay Meet Green and Mackey In Last Match of Interclass Tennis. 
### 
The final match in the interclass
tennis tournaments will he played
off 011 the Encina courts tomorrow
morning at nine o'clock, the Junior
and Freshman teams meeting to de
cide the University doubles champion
ship. The outcome of tomorrow's
match is very doubtful. Throughout
the earlier try-outs, the Junior repre
sentatives, Delano andGGar,} r , played to
gether in very fair style, but in the
first match of the tournament, with
the Seniors, they both appeared to be
suffering from a reversal of form, due
to a lack of practice and to a failure
to understand each other's game.
The Freshmen, Green and Mackey,
are unknown quantities. They played
good, but not brilliant tennis in the
try-outs, winning from Henry and
Little in the final round after a close
contest. Their first match, against
the Sophomores, was a four set af
fair, rather erratic, but showing that
1910 has a very promising team.
