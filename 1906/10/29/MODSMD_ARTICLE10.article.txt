Rugby will get its first true test
on Stanford Field, Wednesday after
noon, when the Cardinal lines up
against Vancouver. The teams which
Stanford has met so far this season
have been novices at the English
game and it is impossible to draw from
them any adequate idea of the real
strength of the Cardinal fifteen.
Judging from the two Vancouver-
California games, the Blue and Gold
is almost equal to the British Colum
bians. This week will show whether
Stanford has made as much progress
at the new game as have Taylor's
pupils. The Pomona contest is a very
uncertain basis of comparison. The
two games this week are next in im
portance to the intercollegiate 011 No
vember 10th. The cost of bringing

Vancouver here has been no slight
one and it is the duty of every Stan
ford man and women to back up the
team and the management by ap
pearing on the bleachers, Wednesday
and Saturday.
