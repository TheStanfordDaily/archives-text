The fast fifteen Rugby players from
Vancouver defeated the varsity of the
University of California Saturday af
ternoon in an exciting game upon
the Berkeley campus by the score of
3 to o. The Northerners met a slight
ly inferior team to the aggregation
they encountered on Wednesday, as
Coach Dr. Taylor held several of the
most promising of his men out of the
game. The British team, however,
had more light and played hard to re
trieve the defeat of two days before.
Assistant Coach L. P. Bansbach
witnessed the match and spoke highly
of the class of ball played. * He was
puzzled, however, as to the attitude
of the referee, who allowed more
scrimmage than has been customary
in any of the games played here. The
kicking duels of the two teams were
one of the features of the contest.
The full back of the Vancouver team
saved his team mates upon numerous
occasions with his well-placed returns
into touch. He kicked with either
foot running at full speed. The
scoring occurred late in the second
half with but a few minutes more of
play. The goal was practically im
possible to kick.
