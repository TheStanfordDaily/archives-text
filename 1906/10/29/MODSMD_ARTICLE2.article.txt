# NO PRIZES FOR SONGS.
## Committee Decides On Honorable Mention for Best Productions. 
### 
There will be no prizes given this
year for the winners of the song com
petition. This decision was rendered
by the song committee at its meeting
Friday night. A member of the song
committee made the following state
ment in regard to the action: "The
Executive Committee has given us
full power to use our own discretion
in deciding the winners of the song
contest. We have rehearsed the
songs a number of times and find they
arc too difficult for the bleachers to
-s+t-vjfr----the most we can do is to
give three of the songs honorable
mention and print them in the yearly
song book. The three songs are,
'Stanford Spirit," by I'. N. Hartzell,
'07; 'Glorious Stanford,' A. B. Pack
ard, '07, and S. B. Thompson, '07,
;ind 'Stanford Spirit,' by L. S. Levy,
â€¢08."
Xo decision has yet been reached
regarding the prize yell, but it is
probable that the committee will re
port tomorrow.
