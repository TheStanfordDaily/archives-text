# STANFORD, 26; POMONA, O.
## Cardinal Fifteen Plays Fast Ball in Saturday's Game at Los Angeles. 
### 
Over one thousand people saw
Stanford run up twenty-six points to
Pomona's nothing, Saturday after
noon in Los Angeles. The Cardinal
fifteen played in splendid form and
won all the way from the wearers of
the Blue and White. Three tries
were scored in each half and four out
of the six goals were kicked by Fen
ton.

Stanford's line was only once in
clanger when Pomona forced the ball
down to the seven-yard line but fail
ed to put it across.
The teams were evenly matched at
dribbling in the scrum but the Stan
ford forwards heeled the ball out on
almost every play and the Cardinal
back-field completely outclassed Po
mona. Holman, Rogers, Owen, Stott
and Chalmers all played a brilliant
game and were responsible for most
of Stanford's score. Chalmers was
slightly hurt late in the second half
and was played at full for the balance
of the game, Fenton going in to cen
ter.
Metcalf and Chisholm starred for
Pomona and Vaile at scrum half put
up a good game. According to No
ble, who coached the Claremont team,
their showing on Saturday was supe
rior to that of a week ago against
California. The concensus of opinion
seems to be that Stanford was a
shade faster and stronger than the
Blue and Gold fifteen in the scrum
and at dribbling but that California's
passing in the back-field was showier
and more brilliant.
Mather, an old Scotch player, refe
reed. He proved to be very strict on
forward passes but was more lenient
than Unmack on ofif-side work in the
scrum. Pomona was not penalized
once while Stanford lost about sixty
yards for infractions of the rules.
Owen was responsible for one of
the most brilliant plays of the game.
Picking the ball from a scrum in the
second half, he feinted a pass to
Chalmers and then broke through for
forty yards. He was downed 011 the
five-yard line, but managed to pass to
Stott who scored the try.
Pomona kicked-off and after a few
scrums, Stott broke loose for thirty
live yards. Pomona punted back to
her own twenty-five yard line. On
the next play Chalmers and Holman
carried the ball down the field for a
try. Fenton missed a hard goal. An

exchange of kicks followed the punt
out and Holman gained thirty yards,
but fumbled. Metcalf recovered the
ball and regained half the distance.
Owen ran across the line but Chis
holm's tackle threw him into touch
ad saved a try. A few plays later
Fenton missed a place-kick on a fair
catch by Holman. The ball then
worked back and forth for no gain
until Chalmers broke loose on the
forty-yard line and scored the second
try. Fenton kicked the goal. Some
clever dribbling and passing by Stott
and Holman to Chalmers brought the
third try and ended the half with the
score of 13-0 in Stanford's favor.
Presley replaced Heinly, and Mac
farland and Rogers went in behind the
line in the second half. Stanford
started off with a rush, running the
ball over the line twice, but neither
of the tries were allowed. Then Po
mona rallied and rushed the ball back
by ten and twenty yard gains, until
they were stopped on the Cardinal's
seven-yard line, where a clever punt
saved a score. Holman scored again,
following Pomona's sensational rally
and a clever run by Stott gave Stan
ford her fifth try. The final try came
on Owen's clever run following his
feint at a pass to Chalmers. Fenton
kicked two out of the three goals
leaving the final score, Stanford 26,
Pomona 0. The line-up follows:

carried the ball down the field for a
try. Fenton missed a hard goal. An

exchange of kicks followed the punt

Over one thousand people saw
Stanford run up twenty-six points to
Pomona's nothing, Saturday after
noon in Los Angeles. The Cardinal
fifteen played in splendid form and
won all the way from the wearers of
the Blue and White. Three tries
were scored in each half and four out
of the six goals were kicked by Fen
ton.

Stanford's line was only once in
clanger when Pomona forced the ball
down to the seven-yard line but fail
ed to put it across.
The teams were evenly matched at
dribbling in the scrum but the Stan
ford forwards heeled the ball out on
almost every play and the Cardinal
back-field completely outclassed Po
mona. Holman, Rogers, Owen, Stott
and Chalmers all played a brilliant
game and were responsible for most
of Stanford's score. Chalmers was
slightly hurt late in the second half
and was played at full for the balance
of the game, Fenton going in to cen
ter.
Metcalf and Chisholm starred for
Pomona and Vaile at scrum half put
up a good game. According to No
ble, who coached the Claremont team,
their showing on Saturday was supe
rior to that of a week ago against
California. The concensus of opinion
seems to be that Stanford was a
shade faster and stronger than the
Blue and Gold fifteen in the scrum
and at dribbling but that California's
passing in the back-field was showier
and more brilliant.
Mather, an old Scotch player, refe
reed. He proved to be very strict on
forward passes but was more lenient
than Unmack on ofif-side work in the
scrum. Pomona was not penalized
once while Stanford lost about sixty
yards for infractions of the rules.
Owen was responsible for one of
the most brilliant plays of the game.
Picking the ball from a scrum in the
second half, he feinted a pass to
Chalmers and then broke through for
forty yards. He was downed 011 the
five-yard line, but managed to pass to
Stott who scored the try.
Pomona kicked-off and after a few
