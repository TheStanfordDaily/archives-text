# Lanagan Tells of Game.

Coach Lanagan said: "It was
a hard game, much harder
than the score indicates, and we
had to fight for every inch.
The team played a great deal
better than ever before. A
strong wind favored us greatly
in the first half and died down
completely after we changed
sides. We were treated royally,
and the Pomona players show
ed themselves true sportsmen."
