# JUNIORS WIN TENNIS
## DELANO AND GAY TAKE DOUBLES CHAMPIONSHIP. 1908 Team Defeats Freshmen In the Final Interclass Match of the Year. 
### 
By defeating C. A. Green and L. B.
Mackey, the Freshman team, in the
last match of the interclass tourna
ments, P. B. Delano and L. R. Gay
won for the Junior class the Univer
sity doubles championship for the
season of 1906. The 1908 team pulled
themselves out of the slump which
they were in at the time of their
match with the Seniors and played
good tennis, defeating the first year
men in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.
Only during the first set did the
Freshmen appear to have the advan
tage over their opponents. Five out
of the first eight games went to the
1910 team, making the score 5-3, with
but one game necessary to win the
first set. At this point, however, Del
ano and Gay braced and took the next
seven games, giving them a lead
which they maintained until the end
of the match.
The summary of the tournament
follows:
Sophomore-Freshman.—Won by
Freshmen, 6-2, 6-1, 2-6, 6-4. Senior-
Junior. —Won by Juniors, 1-6, 6-4, 4-6,
