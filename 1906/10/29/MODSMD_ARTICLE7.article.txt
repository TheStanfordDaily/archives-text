# STATUS OF RECONSTRUCTION.
## Rapid Progress Being Made In Wrecking and Restoration. 
### 
The work of wrecking and restoring
the damaged buildings of the Univer
sity is now progressing rapidly. The
carpenters have finished work on
Memorial Church, having covered all
the exposed portions of the roof with
ruberoid. The church is now in good
condition to withstand the winter
storms, and it is unlikely that any
thing further will be done until the
Board of Trustees forms some definite
plans in regard to rebuilding.
The new Library has been wrecked
to the water-table and most of the
wrecking crews have been transferred
to the Gymnasium and the Museum.
The larger part of the wrecking
crew is now working on the Museum,
the buildings of which are being
wrecked to the first floor. It is prob
able that they will be reconstructed
in a different manner, in order to
make them as earthquake-proof as
possible.
The rear walls of the wings of En
cina Hall have been taken down and
are being rebuilt and strengthened
in every way possible to make the
building absolutely safe.
Work on the arcades along the
east side of the quadrangle has been
progressing rapidly, the stoncworV in
front of the Business Office and
the French building having been re
placed. Work is now being centered
on two of the arcades. These should
be finished in the course of two weeks
after which- the entire length of the
east side of the quadrangle will be
open 112o r use with the possible excep
tion of the Engineering building.
