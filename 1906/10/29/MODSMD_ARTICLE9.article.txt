The chief reason given for the de
cision of the song committee to with
hold the prize offered is that none
of the songs submitted are considered
up to the standard of former years.
This is doubtless the case, for the
committee is well qualified to judge,
but in view of the recent announce
ment that the songs would be first
tried on the bleachers, this decision
may seem unwarranted to those who
as yet have not had an opportunity to
hear them. Had this plan been car
ried out and had the student body
reached the same conclusion as the
committee has, there would be no op
portunity for dissatisfaction. How
ever, the merits of the contributions
cannot be discussed until we have
heard them. The committee seems
justified in its action, and is to be
commended for the stand taken for
several reasons. When a prize is
offered it is presumed that there will
be a competition for it, but this year
practically none of the contributions
were handed in until the last week of
the try-out. Songs so hurriedly com
posed could not be of the best qual
ity. Moreover, Stanford has many
excellent songs handed down from
old days, and the productions of the
last few years have not added mate
rially to the list. Unless a song is
worthy to stand with those which
have endured the trials of many sea
sons, it should not be recognized as
equal to them by awarding it a prize.
