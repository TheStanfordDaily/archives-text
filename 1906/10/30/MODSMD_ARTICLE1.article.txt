# VANCOUVER TOMORROW
## FIRST GAME WITH BRITISH COLUMBIAN FIFTEEN. Cardinal Team In Good Shape and Should Give Britishers Hard Contest. 
### 
Stanford will meet Vancouver to
morrow afternoon at 3:30 in the most
important preliminary game of the
season. The Cardinal will have their
first chance at a team which has
played Rugby for years and which
will afford an excellent test of the
game as ii is played by Stanford.
The Vancouver team went through
light practice last night on Stanford
Field and will work out again this
evening. They are a heavy team and
most of the men in the scrum are
rangy and fast. In the two Califor
nia games the work of the scrums
was slightly in favor of the English
men and in the back-field work, pass
ing and kicking, tin ir play was far
superior to that of the Rlue and Cold.
The scores of the games on Wed
nesday and Saturday should give the
bleachers a fair idea of the relative
merits of the two varsity teams. Cal
ifornia won and lost to the English
men last week, taking the lirst game
5-0 and coming out in the second 011
the short end of a 3-0 score. On
Saturday ne.\t the Blue and Gold will
play \ i vada and from these games it
should !"■ possible to determine \Vith
some degree of accuracy the strength
of Stanford and California.
Rut one change, of importance has
be, n made in the Cardinal line-up. J.
R. Pcmberton, 'ott, is back in the
scrum and L. -M. Edwards, '07. was
last night shifted from the scrum into
a center three-quarters position. The
team is in good condition after their
Southern trip, and showed up well
at the light practice which was held
last night.
Unmack, who officiated at the
freshman and Nevada games, will
probably be referee tomorrow. 111
case his business will not permit him
to be present, one of the Vancouver |
men may take his place. E. J. Nash, !
'07, will probably act as Stanford's
time-keeper and Claude H. Downing,
ex-'<)s, will be one of the touch
