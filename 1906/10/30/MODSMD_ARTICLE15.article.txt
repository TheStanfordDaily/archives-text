The detailed figures of the track
subscription, given out last night by
Manager Sales, are worthy of careful
consideration. 1 lie collectors in the
fraternities and sororities made a
splendid showing. Almost $350 came
from the Row. Roble turned in a
substantial sum and the Japanese
Club contributed over twenty dollars.
The one collector who reported
from Encina Hall, took in almost
forty dollars. From the other col
lectors in the Hall, from the men
who represented Palo Alto on the
list, there was absolutely 110 return.
Such a gross neglect of duty cannot
be permitted to pass unnoticed. The
collectors by the acceptance of their
appointment became liable for at least
an effort to gather funds. They re
ceived warning that their subscrip
tions were delinquent a full week ago.
Even then there was 110 perceptible
effort on thir part to get to work.
The showing made by those who
did make some effort in the matter,
renders any excuse of stinginess on
the part of the student body, ridicu
lous. Had the Palo Alto and Encina
collectors done their duty or even
part of their duty, the sum contrib
uted would have been practically
doubled. There can be no excuse
save that of laziness or lack of inter
est. The collectors who have not made
their returns stand self-convicted of
failing to fulfill the trust imposed
on them by the Stanford student
body.
