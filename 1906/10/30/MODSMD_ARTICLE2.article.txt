# PHELAN TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY.
## Well Known San Franciscan Will Tell of Conditions Since Earthquake. 
### 
The fourth Assembly will be held
tomorrow morning at 11:15 in Assem
bly Hall and will be devoted entirely
to the Social Service Club. James D.
Phelan, ex-mayor of San Francisco,
has accepted the invitation of the
club and will be the speaker. As an
official who has been connected with
the inner workings of the relief com
mittee in San Francisco, he is well
grounded as to the political and so
cial status of affairs in the metropolis.
Phelan should prove a most interest
ing speaker and the assembly will
probably be one of the best this ho
mester.
Phelan is the most prominent relief
worker in San Francisco, being at
the head of the present "San Fran
cisco Relief and Red Cross Funds, A
Corporation." He also was chair
man of the Finance Committee of the
Rvd Cro-s Fund prior to the absorp
tion of this organization by the pres
ent corporation. Phelan served on

the Committees of Forty and Twen
ty during the earthquake and has
taken part in all the. work of recon
struction.
A- a politician Phelan is probably
best known, having been mayor of
San Francisco for several terms, lie
was suggested as a possible candi
date for governor on the Democratic
ticket. It is proposed to have simi
lar assemblies in the future and the
Social Service Club will probably
have at least one or two speakers
each semester.
Phelan will tell of the present and
past conditions in San Francisco, lie
will j robably touch on the present
political fracas in which he is inter
ested as a citizen and property own
er. Phelan will meet the members of
the political section of the Social
Service Club later in the day at a
reception tendered him at the Bache
lors' Club.
