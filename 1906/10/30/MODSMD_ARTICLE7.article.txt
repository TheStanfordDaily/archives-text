# PLUG UGLY DATE SET
## JUNIOR PRODUCTION TO BE ON NOVEMBER 16th. Play Will Probably Be Given On the Oval Instead of Stanford Field. 
### 
. \tter considering all available
dates upon which the Plug-Ugly
could be held, the committee has at
last decided, to produce the Junior
play on Friday evening, November
16th. This date was c uisidered the
best !c>r the reason that it will come
immediately after the game with Cal
ifornia, thus allowing all the men of
the ela.-s to take part in the play, and
will occur one week before the Senior
Circus. '1 o set the date later i> im-,
possible on account of the nearness
of examinations at the close of the
semester. It was also considered out
of the question to hold the Plug-Ugly
next semester.
The farce will undoubtedly he held
<>n the old football field, which will
lie the best available place from which
to start the Senior-Junior clash which
is the inevitable climax to the
production. Stanford Field was con
sidered, but it was soon given up as
being too far a.way from the quad.
The committee is still making ac
tive efforts to have the plugs here in
time for the plaj', and a meeting of
the class will be held in the near
tuture to consider this matter.
