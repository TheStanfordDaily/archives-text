Graduate Manager D. D. Sales has
received a letter from Dan Murphy,
accepting the position of boating
coach. The communication follows:
"I am in rcccipt of your letter of
the 15th. In reply will say that the
student body's terms, commencing
January Ist and ending June Ist, are
accepted at $100 per month. You can
ararnge contract at your leisure and
forward it to me to sign. I wrote to
Captain Zimmerman in reference to
starting in December Ist. I simply
want to have a little more time to
look over the men than I had last
year. Fifteen or twenty minutes a
day with a lot of men will give me
a good chance to size up and pick
out the best. We do not want to let
our opponents beat us out, conse
quently the more time we have on
new men the better. I am not at
all anxious about the crew men, who
are perhaps playing football. I
would not think of interfering with
them. The men who are to succeed
them are the ones I want to interest
myself in, in the meantime. This De
cember matter I am talking over with
the captain and showing him the
feasibility of it. But as I say, our
arrangements I thoroughly under
stand and am satisfied. You can tell
the boys I will be with them, and, if
such a thing is possible, will bring
them to victory in '07."
