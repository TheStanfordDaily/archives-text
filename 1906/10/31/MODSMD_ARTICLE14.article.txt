# WILL OCCUPY NEW QUARTERS.
## Art Department Expects to Move to Inner Quadrangle Soon. 
### 
The Art department will move
from its present quarters in the
wooden building back of the machine
shop, to new rooms in the inner
quadrangle between Memorial Church
and the Geology department. Work
men arc now busy preparing the new
quarters for occupancy and the ar
tists will probably be installed there
within the next week.
The studios which will be vacated
by the Art department were the gifts
of .\lrs. Edward Baron, in 1898, and
were intended at that time to be
merely temporary structures, and to
provide quarters for the art students
until the University was in a position
to carry out its plans and provide
permanent studios of its own.
The light in the new studios will
be inferior to the old, but this disad
vantage will be greatly outweighed
by increased facilities, the locker
room, lecturing facilities, and other
advantages being greatly increased.
