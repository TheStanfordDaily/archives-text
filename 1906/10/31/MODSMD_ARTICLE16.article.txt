# CINDERS DONATED FOR TRACK
## Manufacturing Company Gives Carload to Associated Students. 
### 
E. J." Nash, '07, who made a trip
yesterday to Newark, Alameda coun
ty, for the purpose of investigating
the opportunity of procuring cinders
for the new track, has returned with
the information that the Newark
Stove Manufacturing company will
donate a carload of cinders to the As
sociated Students 011 condition that
the latter transport the cinders. The
matter now rests with the Executive
Committee, which meets this evening.
It is probable that the sanction of the
Executive Committee will be given
tonight and that Manager Sales will
see to the transportation of the cin
ders immediately.
Trainer Moulton stated this after
noon that the only difficulty in the
way of the speedy completion of the
new track is the uncertainty of get
ting cinders to the site of the track.
If three carloads of cinders could
be brought to the University as soon
as they arc needed, which will be
probably within the coming week, the
track would be reasonably certain of
being finished for the annual fall
meet on November 24th. Some trou
ble may be encountered owing to the
scarcity of all kinds of freight cars.
