# Palo Alto Merchants Aid "Stunts"
## 
### 
Yell Leader R. S. Kellogg, '07, has
succeeded in securing all the mate
rial necessary for the "stunts" at the
big game through the generosity of
the merchants of Palo Alto. F. C.
Thiele will furnish all the mega
phones as he did last year. Frazer
& Co. have agreed to contribute
fifteen dollars toward several "stunts"
which are not to be announced until
a later date. Haskell & Co. will fur
nish the red fire for the rally to be
held before the varsity game. This
will cost close to fifteen dollars.
