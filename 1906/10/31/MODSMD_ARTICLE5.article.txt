# PHELAN DELIVERS STRONG ADDRESS
## Describes Difficulties Encountered In Rebuilding of City and Condemns Grafting Officials. 
### 
The fourth Assembly, held this
morning in Assembly Hall, proved to
be the most interesting of any stu
dent body gathering held in some
time. The success of the gathering
was due 10 the speaker of the occa
sion, James D. Phelan, ex-mayor of
San Francisco, who addressed the
gathering at the request of the Social
Service Club.
Phelan came with the intention of
dealing with the social service prob
lem? as presented in San Francisco.
It was his declared purpose to tell
the students how the greatest social
service work, the rehabilitation of
San Francisco, was accomplished
through the various committees, of
which James D. Phelan has been the
foremost worker. But the issue of
the day in San Francisco soon proved
too much for the temperament of Phe
lan, who .ias been lighting the alleged
municipal "grafters," and he soon
deviated from his topic and in sen
sational and dramatic sentences de
nounced "Abe" Ruef, the supervisors,
and the entire municipal government.
He told of how the municipal officers
deserted the city in the time of de
struction and how the committe of
"Fifty," composed of the most prom
inent of the citizens took over the
reins of the government and ran
things to suit the people.
In most scathing terms he referred
to the San Francisco boss as the
"university bred boss." He declared,
however, that the university
from which the boss graduat
ed, was not responsible for the train
ing of the politician, stating that
Ruef did not begin his career until
after graduation.
Phelan, before deviating from his
original subject, told of the vast sums
of money which were poured into the
coffers of the destroyed city from all
quarters as soon as the people of the
country had time to realize the great
ness of the disaster. He told of the
principles upon which the money had
been distributed and explained the
grave danger of pauperism which
confronted the committees and how
they have attempted to prevent the
evij.
President Jordan opened the meet
ing but turned over the chair to W.
Y. Wcntz, '06, as president of the So
cial Service Club. Wcntz made a
short and creditable address and
spoke of the history, policy and prin
ciples of the Social Service Club.
Vice-president Dr. J. C. Branner in
troduced the speaker of the day.
He said in part:
"Prior to the great disaster San
Francisco had reached the zenith of
prosperity in all phases of develop
ment and in the short fifty-six years
of its growth had fulfilled the pre
diction of Sydney Smith, who de
clared when civilization reached the
Pacific it would abound in poetry,
music and education. This happy
state of affairs was reached in the
fifty-six years instead of the two cen

turies predicted. Now we have lost
all. All the labors of these years
must begin again. The problem
which presented itself was unheard
of before. Over 300,000 people were
left absolutely homeless. Not only
was the base of employment cut off,
but all other necessities of life were
removed. Some people had money
but could not use it. There was no
place to buy even food. Some had
money but it was in banks, where
they could not use it if there had
been places to procure nourishment.
And there were people who had no
money. All were placed on a com
mon footing.
"Thus the problem of rehabilitation
which presented itself to the people
after the disaster was great.
"Rehabilitation is charity and the
problem was how to provide for the
people and prevent pauperism from
obtaining a grip 011 the people."
After telling of the methods sug
gested and the committee appointed
he said of the Committee of Fifty:
"The committee of Fifty, appointed
by the Mayor, you might say had ab
solute rule over the city after the
lire. The supervisors had disappear
ed into their holes. They had gone
and we hoped forever. They were
gone, whither none could tell and we
in our charity hoped to heaven, there
are enough devils in hell." This allu
sion to the dishonest officials of San
Francisco brought a cheer from his
hearers.
Phelan told how figuratively the
city hall flew the red flag when the
Schmitz administration came into
office.
"This was not the flag of anarchy,
I told my friends," continued the
speaker. "It was only the flag of
auction. Under the domination of
those craven fellows anything was
for sale and everything had a price."
He went on to tell of the scandal
which the administration has tried to
perpetrate upon the city in connec
tion with the water system. He con
demned their thieving methods in
strong terms.
"The University-bred Ross" was
the appellation by which Phelan des
ignated Ruef. He stated the univer
sity from which Rucf took his degree
should not be held responsible for the
after deeds as Rucf himself has de
clared he did not enter into politics
until after graduation and until after
he was of age. Phelan afterward ex
plained that he made mention of the
latter fact so that 110 undue odium
should be connected with the state
institution.
Phelan closed the address by stat
ing that the idea of his visit here was
not to dwell upon the political situa
tion in the city but that as lie had
allowed himself to become infused
with the spirit he did not believe it
out of place. San Francisco needed
relief from graft and corruption as
much as from anything else.
