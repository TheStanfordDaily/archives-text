pretty play by Snowden. lie punted
from the twenty-five yard line and
catching his own kick, gained fifteen
yards. lie fumbled and the ball roll
ed across the line and a Vancouver
man touched it for a try.
In the second half occurred the
grossest act of muckerism which has
disgraced Stanford Field. Bishpam,
Vancouver's wing forward and cap
tain, who had been playing dirty
ball throughiut the game, ran back to
tackle Owen. lie failed to reach him
but deliberately kicked out with his
foot, dropping the Cardinal half in
bis tracks. Pemberton, then, lost his
head and mixed with the Englishman
in a fist fight. The men were soon
separated but neither was ruled off
the field by Referee Unmack.
Stanford started off poorly in the
first half, Vancouver outdribbling
them and outplaying them in every
scrum. The Cardinal was slow get
ting started and the ball was in their
territory most of the time. Desper
ate defense by the backs prevented
more than one score, Fenton's work
being especially brilliant.
Stanford crossed the line on pretty
passing by Stott and Edwards, but
Unmack refused to allow the score
on a technicality. In the second half
also Stanford was twice deprived of
a try by the decisions of the referee.
Stanford started the second half
with a rush. Chalmers and Hussey
carried the ball thirty-five yards to
Vancouver's forty yard line. By fast
dribbling the Cardinal then worked
the ball down to the twenty yard line.
On two successive rushes Chalmers
gained fifteen yards finally tossing
the ball to Stanford, who pulled three
of the Englishmen over the line for
a try. Fenton kicked the goal.
On the next kick-off Stott fumbled
and Vancouver ran down to Stan
ford's ten yard line. Here the Car
dinal held and finally forced the bait
back. Just before time was called
brilliant work by Owen and Stott
carried the ball across Vancouver's
line for another try. Again Unmack
called back the ball 011 a technical
ity.
All the Cardinal back-field played a
fine game, Stott, Owen and llolman
being the particular stars. All o; the
men in the scrum shewed up well rind
Presley at v ing forward playeu an
aggressive game. For Vancouver
Marshall and Snowden played bril
liant Rugby.
Lanagan said 'Vncy we c keener af
