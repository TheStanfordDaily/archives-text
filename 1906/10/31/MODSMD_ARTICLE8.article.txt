The generosity of Palo Alto's mer
chants in subscribing money for col
lege affairs is deserving of recipro
cation from the students. The men
who have subscribed money to assist
the "stunts" at the intercollegiate
game should be given the first con
sideration by the college public, and
it is in this connection that we wish
to mention certain apparently con
flicting interests of the student body
and Palo Alto firms, from which com
plaints have arisen. Last night the
"Daily Palo Alto" published a news
article announcing the sale of the
rooters hats ordered by the Graduate
Manager. In fairness to the adver
tisers who support the paper it should
be understood that an impartial stand
is taken. The item purported to be
nothing more than a news article, and
should not be interpreted as oppos
ing the interests of any firm which
may have rooter's hats on sale.
While supporting the interests of the
student body, the"Daily Palo Alto"
has no intention of obstructing those
of its advertisers.
