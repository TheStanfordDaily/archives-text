PROTECTION FOR AUTUMN RAINS
One of the best all-round Garments made is the Cravenette or Rain Coat.
Any woolen fabric may be cravenetted, which is a chemical process mak
ing any cloth water proof.
Men who pride themselves on the correctness of their attire consider this
garment necessary for wear in rainy weather alone, but it serves the double
purpose of being equally good for cool sunshiny days or as a protection against
rain.
We carry them in sizes from 33 to 42. Prices, $12.50 to $25.
