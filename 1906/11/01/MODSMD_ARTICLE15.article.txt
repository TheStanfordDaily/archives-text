# Tom Treanor for Recorder.
## 
### 
Every voter in Palo Alto township,
who has lived here two years or more,
is familiar with the now famous case
of Williams vs. Treanor, the case in
which a man who had been duly clect
cd to the office of county recorder
by a clear majority of jog votes was
ousted from office by the man who
had been his political opponent, by
means of chicanery and a clever ma
nipulation of legal technicalities. The
case was in the courts two years and
cost Mr. Treanor, who, as any other
man would have done defended his
rights until the courts ruled against
him, a great deal of money and also
the loss of two years time and a large
amount of the salary of the office
which was legally his. There is not
a citizen in the county who is at all
familiar with the case, who does not
believe that Mr. Treanor was honestly
and squarely elected to that office,
and then shamefully beaten out of it
by some of the dirtiest trickery that
a gang of rotten politicians knows so
well how to employ to gain their ends.
Mr. Treanor is before the people
again asking them to elect him to his
office—-his by every legal right—and
every voter who is a friend to justice
and fair play should help him to come
once more into his own. As a n.nn
he is above reproach in every way,
ami dtn ng the time that Ik: had
h,T-ge of the office he conduced it
bet er iran it had ever been conduct
ed beii'e. He installed new and im
proved rystems of records which are
now in use and which save many
thousands of dollars to the taxpayers
of the county in time and accuracy.
If you believe in treating a man
square, vote for Tom Treanor, no
matter what your political affiliations
arc.
