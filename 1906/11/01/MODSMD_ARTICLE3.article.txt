# COMEDY BY SWORD AND SANDALS.
## "Two Gentlemen of Verona" Will Be Presented in Assembly Hall Tomorrow Night. 
### 
Tomorrow evening at eight o'clock
the long planned for production of
the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" by
Sword and Sandals will take place in
Assembly Hall. The long period of
training and rehearsing that has been
gone through, and the large amount
of money that has been spent in
perfecting the scenery and the light
effects, should insure an excellent
performance.
The cast of the "Two Gentlemen
of Verona" is a guarantee of the suc
cess of the comedy. Miss Aurania
Ellerbeck, 08, will take the part of
"Julia," the most important of the
female characters. Miss Ellerbeck
has been before Stanford audiences
in the past, her excellent appearance
in "She Stoops to Conquer" still be
ing in the minds of the playgoers of
the University. Miss Nora Kath
leen Dunn, '06, will appear as "Sil
via," the dainty daughter of the Mil
anese Duke. Miss Dunn is also
known as an actress here, her "Con
nie Pell" in the 1905 Senior farce be
ing a distinct success. Miss Eliza
beth Officer, '07, has the part of Lu
cetta," the foil for "Julia" in the form
of the maid.
Among the male characters Dudley
D. Sales, '06. deserves first mention.

tine." He was active in dramatics
throughout his four undergraduate
years, and last appeared in the re
cent Senior farce, "The Original Miss
Tewksberry."
James C. Ray, '07, will be seen in
the role of "Proteus." Although this
is Ray's first attempt at a heavy par'
his previous performances in farces
and comedies point toward a good
rendition of the fickle courtier. Ray
has long been prominently identified
with Stanford dramatics.
The parts of the two comedians of
the drama, Launce and Speed, are
well taken. Ernest R. May, '06, an 1
R. S. Kellogg, '07, will carry these
roles respectively. May has had a
very successful dramatic career at
Stanford since his Freshman year,
when he appeared in the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle." Kellogg has
also done much excellent work in the
recent shows in which he has taken
part, notably the "Rivals," in which
he took the part of "Bob Acres."
"Antonio," the irritable father, wi 1

splendid work as "Jack Darling" in
"Stanford—The Life Strenuous," the
last Junior opera, won much praise.
F. F. Municr, 'to. will take the part
of "Panthino." Munier has never be
fore appeared here but brings a good
record from the San Diego high
school, where he took the part of
"Jacques" in "As You Like It,"
"Launce" in the "Two Gentlemen of
Verona," and "Shylock* in the "Mer
chant of Venice."
W. M. Walker, '08, who was
"Young Marlowe" in "She Stoops to
Conquer," E. J. Swift, '08, who was
"Hastings" in the same comedy, and

R. H. Baker, '08, who also had a part
in the 1908 play, that of "Tony Lump
kin," will represent the three out
laws.
J. E. Stewart, '06, will appear in
the role of the "Duke of Milan."
Stewart appeared two years ago in
the English Club play, "Every Man
in His Humour."
The part of "Thurio" will be taken
by F. H. Bernard, '07. Bernard ap
peared as "Sally Slick" in the 1905
Senior farce, as "Pilsener" in the
"Beauty Shop," as "Salary Small" in
the 1907 opera, and as "Robert Scott"
in the recent Senior play. Miss
Georgina Lyman, '07, has the part of
"Ursula."
The scenery for the comedy has
been specially painted by Ludwig and
Rosa, of the Columbia Studio of San
Francisco. The ideas for the scenes,
being Italian, were drawn from the
numerous colored plates of Tuscan
and Neapolitan villas which were
published in the "Century Magazine"
last year. In acquiring such excel
lent scenery and stage properties
Sword and Sandals has expended
over $.200. This will greatly facilitate
the staging of plays in the future.
A study was made of scenic light
effects for the stage by the members
of the dramatic society and as a re
sult the production tomorrow even
ing will be replete with scenic fea
tures, such as a moonlight scene
changing to a gray dawn. Much
valuable electric apparatus has also
been acquired in this connection.
The musical features of the play
will be the quartette singing of Schu
bert's famous music to Shakespere's
ballad to "Sylvia," by O. K. Grau.

Tomorrow evening at eight o'clock
the long planned for production of
the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" by
Sword and Sandals will take place in
Assembly Hall. The long period of
training and rehearsing that has been
gone through, and the large amount
of money that has been spent in
perfecting the scenery and the light
effects, should insure an excellent
performance.
The cast of the "Two Gentlemen
of Verona" is a guarantee of the suc
cess of the comedy. Miss Aurania
Ellerbeck, 08, will take the part of
"Julia," the most important of the
female characters. Miss Ellerbeck
has been before Stanford audiences
in the past, her excellent appearance
in "She Stoops to Conquer" still be
ing in the minds of the playgoers of
the University. Miss Nora Kath
leen Dunn, '06, will appear as "Sil
via," the dainty daughter of the Mil
anese Duke. Miss Dunn is also
known as an actress here, her "Con
nie Pell" in the 1905 Senior farce be
ing a distinct success. Miss Eliza
beth Officer, '07, has the part of Lu
cetta," the foil for "Julia" in the form
of the maid.
Among the male characters Dudley
D. Sales, '06. deserves first mention.

tine." He was active in dramatics
throughout his four undergraduate
years, and last appeared in the re
cent Senior farce, "The Original Miss
Tewksberry."
James C. Ray, '07, will be seen in
the role of "Proteus." Although this
is Ray's first attempt at a heavy par'
his previous performances in farces
and comedies point toward a good
rendition of the fickle courtier. Ray
has long been prominently identified
with Stanford dramatics.
The parts of the two comedians of
the drama, Launce and Speed, are
well taken. Ernest R. May, '06, an 1
R. S. Kellogg, '07, will carry these
roles respectively. May has had a
very successful dramatic career at
Stanford since his Freshman year,
when he appeared in the "Knight of
the Burning Pestle." Kellogg has
also done much excellent work in the
recent shows in which he has taken
part, notably the "Rivals," in which
he took the part of "Bob Acres."
"Antonio," the irritable father, wi 1
be acted by J. W. Ward, '07. whose
splendid work as "Jack Darling" in
"Stanford—The Life Strenuous," the
last Junior opera, won much praise.
F. F. Municr, 'to. will take the part
of "Panthino." Munier has never be
fore appeared here but brings a good
record from the San Diego high
school, where he took the part of
"Jacques" in "As You Like It,"
"Launce" in the "Two Gentlemen of
Verona," and "Shylock* in the "Mer
chant of Venice."
W. M. Walker, '08, who was
"Young Marlowe" in "She Stoops to
Conquer," E. J. Swift, '08, who was
"Hastings" in the same comedy, and

R. H. Baker, '08, who also had a part
in the 1908 play, that of "Tony Lump

peared as "Sally Slick" in the 1905
Senior farce, as "Pilsener" in the
"Beauty Shop," as "Salary Small" in
the 1907 opera, and as "Robert Scott"
in the recent Senior play. Miss
Georgina Lyman, '07, has the part of
"Ursula."
The scenery for the comedy has
been specially painted by Ludwig and
Rosa, of the Columbia Studio of San
Francisco. The ideas for the scenes,
being Italian, were drawn from the
numerous colored plates of Tuscan
and Neapolitan villas which were
published in the "Century Magazine"
last year. In acquiring such excel
lent scenery and stage properties
Sword and Sandals has expended
over $.200. This will greatly facilitate
the staging of plays in the future.
A study was made of scenic light
effects for the stage by the members
of the dramatic society and as a re
sult the production tomorrow even
ing will be replete with scenic fea
tures, such as a moonlight scene
changing to a gray dawn. Much
valuable electric apparatus has also
been acquired in this connection.
The musical features of the play
will be the quartette singing of Schu
bert's famous music to Shakespere's
ballad to "Sylvia," by O. K. Grau.
'07, J. J. Hill. '08, 11. S. Ross, '08, and
