# PREDICT CLOSE GAME
## BRITISHERS THINK VARSITIES ARE EVENLY MATCHED. Cardinal Fifteen More Aggressive On Attack Than Blue and Gold. 
### 
Ysterday's game offered the first
real chance for a comparison of the
Stanford and California fifteens. The
Pomona game should not be taken
into consideration, because of the
Southerners' erratic playing, and be
cause luck greatly favored the Cardi
nal. Yesterday's score indicates that
Stanford and California are very
evenly matched, and this seems to
be the concensus of opinion among
the Vancouver players. When ques
tioned on the subject, one of them
said:
"The intercollegiate game will un
doubtedly be very close and very
hard. It is impossible to predict the
outcome. In the scrum California is
much heavier and more formidable,
although no faster than the Stanford
forwards. It is difficult to compare
the two teams, as their style of play
is entirely different. California plays
a defensive game, while the Cardinal
plays a scoring game, always being
on the aggressive. If both teams are
at their best, a battle royal should
result."
The Britishers were not at all
pleased with Referee Unmack. They
admit that both sides suffered, but
say that he was very poor, when
compared to the officials they have
been accustomed to. His greatest
fault, they assert, was his failure to
follow the ball closely.
For Bispham's unsportsmanlike
tactics his teammates offer no ex
planation, saying that they were en
tirely inexcusable. One of the Van
couver backs said:
"We were more put out than any
one and 'roasted' him, as he deserved.
After that unfortunate disturbance
the entire team lost heart. Nothing
like it has ever occurerd before and,
let us hope, it will not occur again."
