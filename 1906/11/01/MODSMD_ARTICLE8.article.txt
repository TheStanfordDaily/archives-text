# President Laumeister's action in
## 
### 
removing those of the track collec
tors who have shown no interest in
the work of gathering funds is cer
tainly justified. The men were given
ample time to do their soliciting.
Even after the appointed day had ex
pired they were given warning that
they had failed to do their duty. In
the face of this they continued to
show their indifference toward one of
Stanford's most important undertak
ings. Such indifference well deserves
the public manner of the punishment.
The excuse advanced by some of the
men involved, that the pressure of
other duties prevented them from col
lecting, cannot be considered. If
these men felt that they would be un
able to do the work, they should not
have accepted the appointment.
There is nothing to be said regarding
the women who have failed to report. !
It is apparent that with many of them j
there is no possible expedient for I
arousing their interest in student j
body affairs.
