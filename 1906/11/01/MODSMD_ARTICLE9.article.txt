From the comparison of the Stan
ford and California Varsities made
by the Vancouver players it seems
certain that the intercollegiate game
will he a hard fought contest with
the outcome extremely uncertain.
The teams seem to he about evenly
matched, with advantages equally
divided. It is impossible to make
any forecast of the outcome, and the
uncertainties of the new game ad
mit of no attempt at such a predic
tion. Neither university has any
cause for confidence. The game will j
he close, and the amount of support
and encouragement given by the stu
dent body will play a strong part in
determining a Cardinal victory.
