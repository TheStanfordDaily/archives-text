# VARSITY vs. VANCOUVER
## SECOND GAME WITH ENGLISHMEN TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Last Preliminary Contest Before Intercollegiate Game on November 10th. 
### 
The last preliminary game of the
season will be played on Stanford
Field tomorrow afternoon at two
thirty, when the Varsity meets Van
couver for the second time. This will
be the last chance the student body
will have to see the team in action
against an outside fifteen before the
intercollegiate game on November
10th.
Stanford's victory on Wednesday
by no means discouraged the British
ers and *hey arc prepared to make
a fierce tight to obtain an even break
in the series. Their back-field has
been strengthened by the playing of
Woodward at center three-quarters
in place 01 Johnson. Woodward is
a fast player and should strengthen
the British back-field.
The game tomorrow will be played
under the New Zealand rules as was
Wednesday's game, but the experi
ence which the Varsity gained in that
contest should stand them in good
stead.
There will be but one change in
the Stanford line-up. Minturn takes
Conant's place at scrum center. Min
turn was originally in the line-up of
Wednesday's game but was switched
at the last moment and will be given
his chance tomorrow.
Neither Stanford nor the Vancouv
er men would stand for Unmack as
referee. The work of the Queens
lander in Wednesday's game was a
disappointment to both sides, and his
name was not considered in connec
tion with tomorrow's contest.
R. Woodward, who is coaching
Vancouver, will take his place to
morrow. Woodward has had a great
deal of experience at Rugby and
should make a good official.
Manage: Sales has advertised the
game extensively in San Jose and ex
pects a large crowd 011 the bleachers.
