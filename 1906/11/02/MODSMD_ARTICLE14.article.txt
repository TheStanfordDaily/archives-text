# CLASS SELECTS PLUGS
## JUNIORS DECIDE TO BUY FELT HATS. After Much Difficulty the Committee Secures a Sufficient Supply In San Francisco. 
### 
The Junior class at a meeting held
this afternoon decided to accept a hat
for plugs recommended by the Plug-
Ugly committee. The plugs are of
felt, of a darker color than the form
er wool plugs and about as heavy.
'1 hey are made of better material
than the hats used formerly and for
that reason will cost in the neighbor
hood of $1.40,
The committee has been in touch
\Vith hat manufacturers in the East
and also in all the cities along the
coast, but found it impossible to get
the old style hats, owing to the fact
that the Felt-Workers Union pro
hibited the men turning out wool
hats in the future. Efforts were then
made to secure hats in New York,
and while one firm could supply the
tops, they could not get the brims.
Recourse was again had to firms in
the city and Prazer and Company of
Palo Alto found that they could get
enough felt hats to supply the de
mand. The hats will need some
changing, cutting down and blocking,
more substantial than the plugs of
former years. All members of the
class desiring plugs must hand their
names wkh deposit and size of hat
to any member of the Plug-Ugly
Committee, as the plugs will be or
dered immediately.
