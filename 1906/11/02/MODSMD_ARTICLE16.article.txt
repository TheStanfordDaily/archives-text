The Senior Circus Committee has
just received word from G. W. Darl
ing ex-'os, that lie will bring the
"Pzaha" hy way of Stanford, en route
for London, where it will be placed
in the British Museum. It was only
through the close personal friend
ship of one of his classmates with
Mr. Darling, known as "Barefoot
Bill," that the committee was able
to secure the exhibit. The discov
ery of the Pzaha by Darling has
caused quite a stir among zoologists,
as it was believed that the species
was entirely extinct, being known
to scientists only through fossils
found in the Andes Mountains. The
following cablegram has been re
ceived from Darling:
"Tahiti, Oct. 30, '06.
"Will bring Pzaha by way of Stan
ford in time for circus. Sail on the
"Alphi," Nov. Tst.
G. W. DARLING, ex-05."
L. M. E., '07.
