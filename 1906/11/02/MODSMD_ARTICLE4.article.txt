# ROOTERS SEATS POOR
## ARE THREE SECTIONS FROM CENTER OF FIELD. Train Arrangements Made for Day of Big Game.â€”Alumni Tickets On Sale Tomorrow. 
### 
Manager Sales has finally an- |
nounced that the rooting section* at :
the intercollegiate game will be in j
a corresponding position to those of ,
last year, that is, two sections from J
the alumni seats. This decision will
mean that the rooters of the Uni
versities will be seated several sec
tions away from the center of the
field, instead of immediately opposite
the center, as was originally planned
this year.
This action was taken not only be
cause Manager Snedigar of Califor
nia held rut for it, but because the
tickets for the rooting section were
already on the lithographer s press,
and could not be changed without
much expenditure of time and money.
As to the condition of the bleach
ers at Berkeley, which are being set
further apart, Snedigar claims that
the contractors have promised to
have their work completed by next
Sunday evening. The appearance of
California Field as a whole, how
ever, is not at all encouraging, and
trouble may be met with in the prep
aration of the seats.
The tickets the Alumni seats
have arrived and will be put on sale
tomorrow at the Bookstore from 10
to 12 in the* morning by C. F. Wright,
'96.
Manager Sales has also made ar
rangements for a special train to San
Francisco on the day of the Inter
collegiate game to start from the
University at about 9 o'clock. A re
turning train will probably be run
from Berleley by way of San Jose
to the University, leaving Berkeley
about 11:30 in the evening. The fare
for the round trip will probably be
$T.IO.
