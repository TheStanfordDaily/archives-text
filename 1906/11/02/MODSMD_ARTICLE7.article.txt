# ADDRESS BY SUZZALO
## TALKS TO ENCINA CLUB ON HOUSE COMMITTEE. No Written Rules of Government, But Code of Honor Should Determine Conduct of Men. 
### 
At ;i meeting of Encina Club
last night J. E. Stewart, '07, a mem
ber of the House Committee, made a
short speech setting forth the general
ideas of the committee and saying
that at present affairs in the Ilall were
entirely satisfactory. Professor A. H.
Suzzallo was then introduced. He
gave a clear statement of just what
is meant by the government of the
Hall by the House Committee. Pro
fessor Suzzallo is an old Encina man
and he has been deeply concerned
with all the affairs of the Hall. His
efforts have been largely responsible
for the present scheme of control in
the dormitory. He said in part:
"You have recently taken upon
yourself the responsibility for student
government in this hall. As the spe
cial and final means for the discharge
of that obligation you have deter
mined upon the method of house-com
mittee control. Jt seems somewhat
fitting then that "one of you" should
talk to "the rest of you" regarding
the meaning of the business that we
are just now about.
"For the time being your own des
tinies have been given over to your
own wisdom. You are to live by a
world-old code that you will not have
to read or study, for it has already
been written on your lives by the con
tact of men. It is the ancient code of
a gentleman of honor, a code which
has never been written down.
"If anything goes wrong in the
days that arc to come, it will not do
any good to make or re-make any
laws, for the things that arc wrong
will not lie out in the world to be
made over by a vote. The things
that are wrong will lie within you.
to this extent, then, your govern
ment is self-government, that the im
pulses which start your conduct will
always predominantly come from
within you. No monitor, no watch
man, no spy, no police will be the
dictator of order! But everywhere
and always in the world where men
have striven toward self-government,
there have been weak men, and strong
men that have sometimes been weak.
"It is this House Committee which
is your protection against weak men
and strong men who are sometimes
weak, which is the investment you
make in a calm and provident hour of
wisdom .against the folly and the un
wisdom of some other hour when
calm is gone. Your house committee
is not to govern you, it is to influence
you; to bring the faded right impulse
into your mind at the right hour so
that it may lead you back to your bed
rooms for a good night's sleep and
many day's of work, and finally out
into a world that will be warm with
its greetings because you have proved
more of a man. Of course, if there is
nothing in you to which to appeal, if
