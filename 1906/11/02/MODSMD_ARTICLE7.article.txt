# ADDRESS BY SUZZALO
## TALKS TO ENCINA CLUB ON HOUSE COMMITTEE. No Written Rules of Government, But Code of Honor Should Determine Conduct of Men. 
### 
At ;i meeting of Encina Club
last night J. E. Stewart, '07, a mem
ber of the House Committee, made a
short speech setting forth the general
ideas of the committee and saying
that at present affairs in the Ilall were
entirely satisfactory. Professor A. H.
Suzzallo was then introduced. He
gave a clear statement of just what
is meant by the government of the
Hall by the House Committee. Pro
fessor Suzzallo is an old Encina man
and he has been deeply concerned
with all the affairs of the Hall. His
efforts have been largely responsible
for the present scheme of control in
the dormitory. He said in part:
"You have recently taken upon
yourself the responsibility for student
government in this hall. As the spe
cial and final means for the discharge
of that obligation you have deter
mined upon the method of house-com
mittee control. Jt seems somewhat
fitting then that "one of you" should
talk to "the rest of you" regarding
the meaning of the business that we
are just now about.
"For the time being your own des
tinies have been given over to your
own wisdom. You are to live by a
world-old code that you will not have
to read or study, for it has already
been written on your lives by the con
tact of men. It is the ancient code of
a gentleman of honor, a code which
has never been written down.
"If anything goes wrong in the
days that arc to come, it will not do
any good to make or re-make any
laws, for the things that arc wrong
will not lie out in the world to be
made over by a vote. The things
that are wrong will lie within you.
to this extent, then, your govern
ment is self-government, that the im
pulses which start your conduct will
always predominantly come from
within you. No monitor, no watch
man, no spy, no police will be the
dictator of order! But everywhere
and always in the world where men
have striven toward self-government,
there have been weak men, and strong
men that have sometimes been weak.
"It is this House Committee which
is your protection against weak men
and strong men who are sometimes
weak, which is the investment you
make in a calm and provident hour of
wisdom .against the folly and the un
wisdom of some other hour when
calm is gone. Your house committee
is not to govern you, it is to influence
you; to bring the faded right impulse
into your mind at the right hour so
that it may lead you back to your bed
rooms for a good night's sleep and
many day's of work, and finally out
into a world that will be warm with
its greetings because you have proved
more of a man. Of course, if there is
nothing in you to which to appeal, if
the code of honor is not within you,
if j'ou have ceased to be a gentleman,
or have never been one, then you will
have to go,< for under the code of
honor only gentlemen can live! Then
the House Committee will not remind
you, but command you. No crime is
charged, no inevitable offense; you
have ceased to be congenialâ€”that is
all!
"If such is to be your house-com
mittee, you know the kind of men
you must elect. Not the sociable and
sympathetic, tlie gentle and just, but
the most sociable and the most sym
pathetic, the most gentle and the
most just. For these are the men to
set the standard and ideal in the or
dinary hours, and in the hour of the
unusual danger, to hold the standard
when it has gone from your minds,
and by a word to bring you back to
your precious possessions. Such men
are rare. You cannot pick up any
man. Remember that you cannot be
equally sociable with every man in the
ball, you will not have the chance,
some live at the other end of the hall,
then some sit beside you in the class
room day after day and you know
them. Some will be of your set and
some will not. But if he is not a man
there "is 'ho reason for your refusing
to know his value. Make choice of
your house-committeemen in a non
partisan spirit. There are not two
kinds of gentlemen in this world,
therefore there is no need of party
tickets and party strife in your elec
tion."
