The "Daily Palo Alto" is in re
ceipt of a long communication from
H. L. Haehl, '01, chief engineer of the
Bay Cities Water Company, regard
ing certain charges made against the
water company in connection with
the reference to the alleged graft in
San Francisco by former Mayor J.
D. Phelan in his recent address he
fore the Assembly. We are unable
to print the document because of
lack of space, and because it is not
the policy of the "Daily Palo Alto"
to print communications regarding
matters outside the University. The
writer of the article objects to the
indulgence by Phelan "in certain
charges and insinuations" which, he
believes, "are unwarranted and un
just. Inasmuch as they affect the
affiliations and interests of a consid
erable number of Stanford men," he
says, "I have taken the liberty, as
one of them, to write and place be
fore you what I believe to be some
of the truth of the matter."
Regarding the attitude taken by
Phelan before the Assembly, Haehl
says, "Prominence in social and
political life give certain men ready
access to the car of the public. It is
lamentable when this privilege is
used for the furtherance of private
ambitions and for the abuse of hon
orable citizens. I do not attempt to
say what Mr. Phelan's motives may
be; I cannot believe that lie is so
lacking in intelligence that he does
not appreciate the discrepancies in
the statements cited. The fact re
mains that a man of standing and
enjoying the respect of every com
munity has indulged in statements
which do not seem possible of veri
fication."
