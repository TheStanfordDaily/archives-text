# COMEDY IS A SUCCESS
## SWORD AND SANDALS GIVES GOOD PRODUCTION. Excellent Interpretation to the Part of "Julia" is Given by Miss Ellerbeck, '08. 
### 
The performance under the aus
pices of Sword and Sandals of
Shakespeare's "Two Gentlemen of
Verona," on Friday evening was by
far the best exhibition that Stanford
playgoers have witnessed in recent
years. The scenery was constructed
especially for the occasion, and was
in excellent taste. The caste had
been drilled to perfection in their;
various parts, and the entire perform
ance went through without a single
hitch. By far the most successful

piece of staging in the course of the
performance was the moonlight scene
in the fourth act, which represented
the palace garden during the sing
ing of the song to Sylvia. The song,
set to Schubert's music, was most ad-,
mirably rendered, and was distinctly
the feature of the evening. The cos
tumes of the players, while not in
every case distinctly typical of the
Middle Ages, were nevertheless beau
tiful and elaborate. The managing
and staging of the play was in the
hands of P. C. Edwards, '07, and the
splendid success of the performance
was due to his skillful direction and
untiring exertions.

dled their parts admirably and well,
Miss Ellerbeck outdistancing all the
others by the remarkable handling of
a most difficult part. Her interpre
tation of the character of Julia was
indicative of true genius, and was,
indeed, superior to the acting of any
other woman on the Stanford stage
during the past few years. Miss
Dunn spoke her lines well and han-

tiled her part with dignity, but with
out sufficient animation. The lead
ing role of Valentine was splendidly
portrayed by D. D. Sales who dis
played every qualification for the
part, J. C. Ray, who in the past has
done so well in comic and grotesque
parts, rather overdid the part of Pro
teus, who should not have strutted
and fumed and mouthed his lines so
much, but should have remembered
Shakespeare's own advice to actors
to use all gently. May and Kellogg,
who played the parts of the two
clowns, Launcc and Speed, handled J
their roles with their usual s I>i 11 and 1
kept the audience in continual laugh
ter by their buffoonery. In a minor
part, Mitnier did excellent work and
demonstrated his unquestioned abil
ity for dramatics, i lie rest of the
cast handled their parts with great
credit, and without a single fault of
execution.
There was a large and appreciative
audience, but it made the same error
that audiences usually make when it
gave.more applause to the mere per
siflage of the two clowns than to the
really unusual excellence which Miss
Ellerbeck displayed in the portrayal
of a serious part. The result of the
perf irmance was a splendid success
both for Sword and Sandals and for
the student body, which had the op
portunity of seeing a play of a great
master presented in a manner which
would do credit to the professional
stage.
