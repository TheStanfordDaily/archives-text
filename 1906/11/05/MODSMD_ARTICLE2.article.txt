# STANFORD, 16; VANCOUVER, 6.
## Cardinal Fifteen Wins Second Game With the Canadians by Good Score. 
### 
Stanford made it two straight from
Vancouver on Saturday afternoon,
defeating the Canadians by the de
cisive score of 16-6. The Cardinal
scored two tries and kicked one goal
in each half. Both of Vancouver's
scores were made in the second half
on penalty plays, the first coming
from a placement kick by Fowler on
an offside play and the second as the
result of Chalmers tackling a Van
couver man who was about to fall on
the ball behind Stanford's line.
The game was by far the most ex
citing that has been seen on Stanford
Field this year. Both teams made
most of their gains by the fast pass
ing and long runs, which kept the
bleachers on edge throughout the
hour of play. Vancouver failed to
play up to their made in
Wednesday's game and except for
several brilliant rallies seemed to be
slow and out of condition. The Var
sity followed up the ball better and
played a more aggressive game than
in the first contest with the Canadi
ans. The whole back-field played
splendid Rugby and the scrum was
fast and clever in working out the
ball. Stanford's showing, however,
was due more to the weakness of the
Englishmen, who failed to put up any

consistent defence, than to any won
derful improvement on the part of
the Cardinal players. A better un
derstanding of the New Zealand
rules, under which the swies was
played, also helped Stanford and
several times saved them from be
ing scored on.
The first try was scored within two
minutes of play. Vancouver returned
Pemberton's kick-off to Chalmers,
who carried the ball in to the Cana
dians' twenty-five yard line. On the
first scrum Owen picked out the ball
and, feinting a pass, dodged through
the Vancouver backs for a try. Fen
ton missed a hard goal. From the
drop out Vancouver held the ball in
the center of the field, until Holman
broke through for a twenty-five-yard
run. From the next scrum Van
couver dribbled out of danger. Ed
wards gained fifteen yards, but a
penalty kick gave the Canadians the
distance again. Minturn and Cheda
! carried the ball down into Vancouv
| cr's territory and fast passing by Ed
| wards, Presley and Stott landed it on
j the ten-yard line when Snowden pick
ed up a fumble and punted out of
j danger. A minute later clever drib
bling by Hussev and Molfino left
the ball on the five-yard line, where
Owen let a dribble get away from him
and Vancouver turned a try into a
touch-down. A fair catch by Pem
berton gave Stanford a free kick,
and I'enton dropped a short punt into
Vancouver's territory. Chalmers
captured the ball and he and Stan
ford carried it down to the ten-yard
line. Here the Canadians made an
other desperate stand, and when the
ball did go over the line it was
touch-in-goal. From here the play
worked back and forth with the ad
vantage to Stanford. Fenton missed
a drop-kick from the 45-yard line by
a narrow margin. Koerner and
Pemberton dribbled to the 15-yard
line, but the Englishmen sent it back
twenty yards. Here Holman picked
up the ball and made a beautiful scat
tered-field run, passing to Cheda, who
scored the second try. Fenton kick
ed the goal just as the whistle blew.

ter a few minutes of play. Fentor.
stopped several dangerous dribbles

3. Again Stanford advanced tb* ball
but tlii- time Vancouver succeeded in
dribbling out of danger. Edwudi
and Mussey carried the ball dov>-n to
the twenty-yard line and 011 the next
play Stott smashed through a scat
tered field for another try. This time
Fenton kicked the goal. From the
kick-off Stanford advanced steadily
until Stott was able to try for a fair
catch 011 the 25-yard line. A Van
couver man knocked down the ball
and Woodward, picking it from the
scrimmage, broke loose for the long
est run of the day. He passed Fen
ton but was run down and dropped
011 Stanford's fifteen-yard line. The
ball was dribbled across 011 the next
play and Holman fell on it, but re
feree Woodward awarded the Cana
dians a try for a foul by Chalmers,
who tackled an Englishman just as
he was about to fall on the ball.
Fowler missed the goal. For the re
mainder of the half the ball worked
back and forth in the center of the
field. The final score stood, Stan
ford 16, Vancouver 6.
Woodward proved himself a very
capable official. He was less strict
on penalizing for technicalities than
Unmack and in consequence the
game was more spectacular and fas
ter. Bispham, Vancouver's captain
was sick and unable to play. His
place at wing forward was taken by
Harris. The Englishmen remained
011 the campus until last night when
they started 011 their return journey
to British Columbia.
Coach Lanagan was none too pleas
ed with Stanford's showing. He said
after the game, "Vancouver was off
her game and played miserably which
accounts for our large score. Stan
ford showed no improvement over

her work in Wednesday's game."
The crowd was the largest of the
season's preliminary games. There
were about twelve hundred people 011
the bleachers and almost the entire
student body turned out to view the
contest. The rooting was the best
that has been done this season.
