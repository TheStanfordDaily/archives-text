# STANFORD, 16; VANCOUVER, 6.
## Cardinal Fifteen Wins Second Game With the Canadians by Good Score. 
### 
Stanford made it two straight from
Vancouver on Saturday afternoon,
defeating the Canadians by the de
cisive score of 16-6. The Cardinal
scored two tries and kicked one goal
in each half. Both of Vancouver's
scores were made in the second half
on penalty plays, the first coming
from a placement kick by Fowler on
an offside play and the second as the
result of Chalmers tackling a Van
couver man who was about to fall on
the ball behind Stanford's line.
The game was by far the most ex
citing that has been seen on Stanford
Field this year. Both teams made
most of their gains by the fast pass
ing and long runs, which kept the
bleachers on edge throughout the
hour of play. Vancouver failed to
play up to their made in
Wednesday's game and except for
several brilliant rallies seemed to be
slow and out of condition. The Var
sity followed up the ball better and
played a more aggressive game than
in the first contest with the Canadi
ans. The whole back-field played
splendid Rugby and the scrum was
fast and clever in working out the
ball. Stanford's showing, however,
was due more to the weakness of the
Englishmen, who failed to put up any

consistent defence, than to any won
derful improvement on the part of
the Cardinal players. A better un
derstanding of the New Zealand
rules, under which the swies was
played, also helped Stanford and
several times saved them from be
ing scored on.
The first try was scored within two
minutes of play. Vancouver returned
Pemberton's kick-off to Chalmers,
who carried the ball in to the Cana
dians' twenty-five yard line. On the
first scrum Owen picked out the ball
and, feinting a pass, dodged through
the Vancouver backs for a try. Fen
ton missed a hard goal. From the
drop out Vancouver held the ball in
the center of the field, until Holman
broke through for a twenty-five-yard
run. From the next scrum Van
couver dribbled out of danger. Ed
wards gained fifteen yards, but a
penalty kick gave the Canadians the
distance again. Minturn and Cheda
! carried the ball down into Vancouv
| cr's territory and fast passing by Ed
| wards, Presley and Stott landed it on
j the ten-yard line when Snowden pick
ed up a fumble and punted out of
j danger. A minute later clever drib
bling by Hussev and Molfino left
