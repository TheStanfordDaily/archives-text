Vanderlyn Stow, the newly elected
Trustee, will fill the vacancy in the
board, caused by the death of Jane
Lathrop Stanford. Stow is a grad
uate of Harvard University and has
always taken a great interest in col
lege affairs. At Harvard Stow was a
member of the varsity football team
and varsity crew. His home is in
San Francisco, where he is a member
of the firm of Thomas Day and Com
pany.
C. N. Cioss, who will fill the va
cancy in the Mechanical Engineering
department caused by the resignation
of S. J. Dennis, graduated from Cor
nell in 1896. Cross comes to Stan
ford from Buffalo, where lie has held
a position in the Lackawanna Steel
Corporation since lie left Cornell.
The Electric car line is to follow
j the county road behind the Univer-
I sity, through the Stock Farm, and
into San Mateo County. The course
j of the new automobile road was also
| determined by the Trustees, although
j the date of its opening was not defi
nitely decided. This road will enter
the campus from a point east of the
main entrance, run through the arbo
retum, connect there with the road
running by the new Gymnasium and
continue by the quad to Lasuen
street, which will connect it with the
county road behind the University.
This road is to be completed as soon
as practicable.
The Trustees determined that La
gunita should be filled during the
coming spring semester, but owing
to the rotten condition of the flume,
which supplies the water the lake will
probably not be filled again. The
flume is almost ready to fall apart,
and next year the lake must remain
I dry as the University cannot afford
the money necessary to build another
flume.
The action of the Trustees adopting
1 the retiring rules expressed in their
resolution was intended by that body
1 as a rule of procedure, to be applied
j when a speciiic case shall arise. As
j provided in the Carnegie fund, all
retired professors are to receive one
halt" of their salary, three thousand
dollars being the maximum amount
allowed as a pension.

flume is almost ready to fall apart,
and next year the lake must remain
I dry as the University cannot afford
the money necessary to build another
flume.
The action of the Trustees adopting

resolution was intended by that body

Vanderlyn Stow, the newly elected
Trustee, will fill the vacancy in the
board, caused by the death of Jane
Lathrop Stanford. Stow is a grad
uate of Harvard University and has
always taken a great interest in col
lege affairs. At Harvard Stow was a
member of the varsity football team
and varsity crew. His home is in
San Francisco, where he is a member
of the firm of Thomas Day and Com
pany.
C. N. Cioss, who will fill the va
cancy in the Mechanical Engineering
department caused by the resignation
of S. J. Dennis, graduated from Cor
nell in 1896. Cross comes to Stan
ford from Buffalo, where lie has held
a position in the Lackawanna Steel
Corporation since lie left Cornell.
The Electric car line is to follow
j the county road behind the Univer-
I sity, through the Stock Farm, and
into San Mateo County. The course
j of the new automobile road was also
| determined by the Trustees, although
j the date of its opening was not defi
nitely decided. This road will enter
the campus from a point east of the
main entrance, run through the arbo
retum, connect there with the road
running by the new Gymnasium and
continue by the quad to Lasuen
street, which will connect it with the
county road behind the University.
This road is to be completed as soon
as practicable.
The Trustees determined that La
gunita should be filled during the
coming spring semester, but owing
to the rotten condition of the flume,
which supplies the water the lake will
probably not be filled again. The
flume is almost ready to fall apart,
and next year the lake must remain
I dry as the University cannot afford
the money necessary to build another
flume.
The action of the Trustees adopting
1 the retiring rules expressed in their
resolution was intended by that body
1 as a rule of procedure, to be applied
j when a speciiic case shall arise. As
j provided in the Carnegie fund, all
retired professors are to receive one
