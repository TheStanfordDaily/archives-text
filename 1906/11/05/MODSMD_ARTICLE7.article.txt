As the football season draws to a
close interest in the intercollegiate
game becomes more intense. The nat
ural result is that football becomes
the prevalent topic of conversation
among the undergraduates. This keen
interest in the outcome of the football
game should be encouraged but it
has one danger which the members
of the student body must guard
against. We refer to the constant
discussion of the prospects of the
team with the men who are on the
football squad. These men are per
sistently bothered with all sorts of
questions as to the chances of the
team. It makes no difference wheth
er a man is in his own room, in the
library, or at a recitation he is un
able to avoid a discussion of the com
ing football, game.
This condition of affairs should be
discouraged. The constant discussion
of football with the players not only
distracts them from their studies but
it serves to keep them continually
thinking about the coming game and
adds greatly to the worry which is
ordinarily experienced by the men
during the last week of training.
Therefore one of the best ways for
the student body to help the team
win the game is to refrain from both
ering the players with the discus
sion of football topics. Do not talk
football to the players until after the
game.
