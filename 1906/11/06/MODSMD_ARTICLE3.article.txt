### 
If the negotiations with the Van
couver Rugby players, which Grad
uate Manager D. D. Sales is carry
ing on are successful, the football
team will in all probability go North
upon the close of the present semes
ter and engage the Britishers in a
series of games during the holidays.
Hie Vancouver players are very anxi
ous to meet Stanford again after they
have had more practice. Dr. Frank
Angel! states that he does not be
lieve that the faculty will impose any
obstacle in the way of the project
and believes that the trip would be
a good thing. The Faculty Athletic
Committee has not met to consider
the matter, as definite arrangements
have not been negotiated. The trip
is a strong possibility, however.
In case the team goes North it will
play games with the fifteens repre
senting Vancouver, Victoria and Na
nimo. All of these towns are mem
bers of the British Columbia Rugby
League and each of them is repre
sented by a fast team. The men who
represented Vancouver on her South
ern trip were picked from the Van
couver and Nanimo fifteens. If Stan
ford goes North all her expenses will
be paid by the Canadians.
