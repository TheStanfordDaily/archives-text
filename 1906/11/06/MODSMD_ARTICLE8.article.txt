1 lie sale of seats 011 the quad this
afternoon for the intercollegiate game
amounted nearly to $2500. By 3:30
all the roters' tickets had gone, and
when the sale closed most of the
section next to the rooters had been
disposed of, together with about 200
of the $2.00 seats.
Although seats in the rooting sec
tion were advertised at $1.50, the ma
jority of the men who will occupy
the Stanfo-d rooting section Saturday
have paid $1.65 for the privilege. By
seven o'clock yesterday evening
there were ten or a dozen men in
line at the place of sale 011 the inner
quadrangle, each with his fifty sig
natures it fifteen cents per signa
ture.
The line increased slowly, most of
the rooters preferring to pay the in
creased price rather than spend the
night 011 the pavement of the quad,
with the prospects of a seat in the
top row of the section. Many of
those in the line took the names of
about twenty-five rooters and then
refused to be bothered with more,
preferring to accept the ten per cent
commission 011 the $2.50 and? 2 00
seats.
At one o clock the space between
the two of the pillars was roped off
and Manager Sales and his assistants
placed the tickets on sale. The first
six men in the crowd cleaned out all
the desirable seats in the section,
leaving the crowd behind them to
pick up what were left. The sale of
the reserved seats outside the root
ing section was not heavy at first but
attained considerable proportions lat
er in the afternoon.
