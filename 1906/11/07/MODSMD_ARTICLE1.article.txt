# RED BUTTONS ON CAPS
## FRESHMEN ACCEDE TO SOPHOMORE SUGGESTIONS. Action Results From 1909 Communication Read at Meeting Today. 
### 
The Freshmen class decided this
afternoon to adopt a red button tor
their grey caps. This question has
been under consideration by the cap
committee for the last ten days and
after a thorough discussion it was de
cided to leave the final decision to the
class at large.
The class today decided to adopt
the red button and instructed the
committee to withhold all caps until
the button has been put on them.
Plain gray caps have been ordered
and arc now on the way, so that it
will be necessary to have the change
made in Palo Alto.
The action taken today is largely
due to the influence of the Sopho
mores; who caused the letter which
follows to be read at the Freshman
meeting.
"November 5, 1906.
"To the Class of 1910: —
"Gentlemen—After proper and ex
tensive inquiry as to the attitude of
the upper classes, the Sophomore
class has decided to recommend to
the Freshman class, in initiating the
custom of a hat, to take due care
and make sure that the action will
answer the best needs of Stanford
life. The upper classes commend
the Freshman class for the hat cus
tom. We feel thai men who have
onl}' been at Stanford three months
are not in a position to appreciate
the importance of such an undertak
ing. To make the cap distinctive of
Stanford it would necessarily require
first of all Stanford's color placed
on it in some manner. To have the
cap all red, would encroach upon the
well establisheed Sophomore hat.
We therefore suggest either a red
button or visor that the hat may be
distinguished. In regard to the rum
or of stealing class hats we would
say that it is unfounded. Such actions
are universally condemned at Stan
ford. Customs at Stanford have been
established by men who have spent
years, not months, at Stanford. Tt is
therefore obvious that a custom
should not be attempted by strangers
to this community. Therefore the
class of 1909 recommends that the
wishes and suggestions of the upper
classes be duly considered before es
tablishing a custom at Stanford.
Sincerely yours,
D. D. SMITH,

F. K. WYATT, Chairman.
