# SEASON ALMOST OVER
## LAST HARD WORK TONIGHT ON STANFORD FIELD. Climate and Lack of Injuries Have Favored Cardinal In First Rugby Season. 
### 
Stanford's first Rugby season is
drawing to a close under the most
auspicious circumstances. Aside from
tliree showery days there lias been 110
rain since practice began in Septem
ber and at no time has the weather
interfered with the work of the
squads. Climatic conditions have
favored the new game and should the
good weather continue up to Satur
day the season will break all records
in that respect.
The last hard practice of the season
was run through tonight when the
Reds and Blacks scrimmaged for two
fast halves on Stanford Field. To
morrow the varsity fifteen and the
five substitutes will have light work
for the last time before the big game.
Following Lanagan's custom the team
will take a trip into the hills on Fri
day leaving early in the morning and
remaining away from the campus all
day.
All of the varsity players are in
splendid condition. Trainer Moulton
has been running the men every
morning ; sound the field and he de
clares that they will easily be able to
stand the strain of the two long
halves on California Field next Satur
day. Molfino, whose eye was hurt in
the secon 1 Vancouver game and who
has been 111 the hospital for the past
four days, reappeared on the field to
night and will be able to take his
place in the front rank of the scrum.
The season has been almost entirely
free from serious accidents and
Trainer Moulton declares that it is
the most successful series he has ever
known from that point of view.
