As one of those who enjoyed the

performance of the "Two Gentlemen
of Verona" on Friday evening,—en
joyed the evenness of the whole pre
sentation, acting and stage-manage
ment both, —1 can not refrain from
saying a word about what seems to
me the larger significance of it all.
And that is the inestimable help that
every serious dramatic effort is to
the plays that come after. One can
easily trace the remarkable success of
this performance beyond the more
immediate labors of Sword and San
dals, ambitious and painstaking
though tlity were, back to the earlier
undertakings that made this last suc
cess possible.
If one reviews the previous plays
in which the actors of the Sword
and Sandals play gained their experi
ence, and the director and stage man
ager their training, one goes over in
retrospect the most wortl'y -'fforts in
Stanford dramatics for four years.
And in th : s development it is hard to
overestimate the influence of the
Sophomore plays that have recently
been given. It is largely to the cred
it of these performances that we have
selected for their general dramatic
worth, that we have discovered in the
succeeding classes actors capable of
the serious, ambitious work imposed
upon them, and that we have seen
high standards of stage presentation
set and maintained.
We are fortunate in having an or
ganization like Sword and Sandals
that can take the best of the material
that has already been found, and
develop it to a perfection impossible
to the pioneer conditions of the class
play; but we are fortunate, too, in
having a tradition of worthy ideals
and independent methods in the pres
entation of class plays. It is the co
operation of these influences that
augurs so well for the future of dra
matic entertainment at Stanford. And
it will be encouraging, indeed, if we
find as we go on that all the organi
zations interested in dramatic work
co-operate in their several capacities
in keeping the standard of our col
lege plays no less high than has been
attained.
