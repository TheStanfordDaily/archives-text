# LAST SCRIMMAGE FAST
## VARSITY AND SECOND TEAM PLAY CLOSE GAME. Drive to Hills Is Program of Squad for Last Day Before Contest. 
### 
In the last scrimmage practice of
the season the Varsity ran up twenty
one points on the second team, scoring
five tries and three goals in fory
mi nine sof play. In f-p'fe'of the large
score the work of the Varsity was
rather disappointing. The team
played a strong scoring game on the
aggressive but were weak on defense,
the work of Fenton and Laumeister
at full saving them at least three
times from being scored on.
In the scrum the Varsity had all
the best of it, heeling the ball out at
will and dribbling through fast. In
the backfield the second practically
out-classed their opponents. Mac
farland, Rogers, Cole and Newland
put up a -trong, fast game and were
responsible for many long gains,
while Faulkner at full made a splen
did showing.
Holman's foot still troubled him
last night and Cook played in his
place. Laumcister was substituted la
ter in the game at full in place of
Fenton. He played a sensational
game, making three clever scattered
held runs and kicking two goals from
very difficult angles.
There was light practice this after
noon on Stanford Field for the Var
sity and the live men who will lie on
the side-lines Saturday.
Tomorrow morning the team will
leave the campus on an all day drive
through the hills in the direction of
