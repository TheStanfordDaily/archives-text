# NO TRIP FOR COACH
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS VISIT EAST USELESS. Lanagan May Go to New Zealand If Rugby Is Played Next Year. 
### 
At a long session last evening the
Executive Committee passed the fol
lowing resolution: "That it is the
sense of the Executive Committee, on
account of the strong probability that
Rugby will be played next year, that
it is needless to send Coach Lanagan
East according to contract."
The agreement between Coach Lan
agan and the Associated Students
states that the coach shall be sent
East every year. The agreement was
made in 1905 and the idea was to send
the coach to the carter of football
activity to study the game as there
played. Last night's action was taken
in view of the fact that should Coach
Lanagan go East, it would be neces
sary for him to start shortly after the

Intercollegiate game in order to he
present at the most important games
of the Eastern eollcges.
If the English game is played here
next year it is probable that Coach
Lanagan will go to New Zealand, one
of the foremost countries in which
Rugby is played, next summer. Lan
agan was present at the meeting last
night and stated that the first actual
game of Rugby he saw was at Stan
ford, and that Rugby as a game was
better than he had expected. In his
opinion the decision as to what game
shall be played should be left to the
men on the football squad.
Manager Sales announced that the
trip of the football team to Los An
geles for the Pomona game cost about
$200 more than was received, while
a surplus of over $100 was netted 011
the two games with Vancouver.
