Stanford's Rugby team has enjoyed
a very successful season, and has
demonstrated that it is a very cap
able aggregation. The supporters of
the team have reason to feel that the
Cardinal will be well represented by
this team, but there is no justification
for the absolute confidence that seems
to have become lodged in the minds
of many of the students. Over-con
fidence has lost a great many games,
both for Stanford and California.
Fast experience should be a sufficient
warning to cause us to guard against
this evil. It is certain that the Cali
fornia team may lie depended 011 to
give a good account of itself, and an*'
apparent slump is of absolutely no
value as a basis of comparison. The
game will be close and neither side
has any advantage sufficiently great
to be certain of winning.
