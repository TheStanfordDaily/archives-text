### 
The final send-oft" of the team was
held last night in Assembly Hall and
the enthusiasm of the rooters and
assembled students exceeded all pre
vious demonstrations. In the esti
mation of the oldest post-graduates
and members of the faculty last
night's jollification was the greatest
of its kind ever witnessed at Stan
ford. Every speaker was applauded

to the echo and the demonstration
given Coach Lanagan and the fifteen
men and substitutes excelled any
thing in the line of yelling heard in
many years. The tumultuous shout
ing and yelling when the team entered
was deafening and continued for sev
eral minutes without cessation.
The hall was packed to the doors
long before the scheduled time. All
-eats on the main lloor were lilled and
the gallery was taxed to the limit
by the women of the University and
interested members of the commun
ity. Veil Leaders Kellogg and llartz
ell kept the rooters busy until the
arrival of the team practicing the new
yells.
Professor A. H. Suzzallo of the
Education department opened the
rally with a brilliant and character
istic address. He was cheered heart
ily whenever he referred to the vic
tory of the Cardinal which was so
evidently to be the outcome of the
contest tomorrow. He told the stu
dents to mould the Freshmen into
good true Stanford men. In defin
ing the "Stanford Man" he told hum
orous stories touching the point
which brought down the house, lie
described the process of training the
new athletes as "Lanaganizing." He
said the game of Rugby was good for
both players and rooters.
Coach Tames F. Lanagan followed
Professor Suzzallo and in a direct and
plainly-worded speech told of the
prospects of the team and gave three
reasons why the successful candidates
"were selected. Tie said, "I want to


Trainer .Moolton
express tlie thanks and appreciation
of the squad, Trainer Moulton and
myself for the support which the
student body has given the Rugby
game. The game was not what the
students wanted but you have sup
ported it grandly. In selecting the
team three qualities have been observ
ed: first, the spirit of each man
has been taken into consideration;
second, an absolutely unselfish re
gard for fellow teammates, and third
and last a knowledge of the game.
All the men who have made the team
are absolutely unselfish. If any man
gave evidence that he wanted to make
all of the trys himself no matter how
good a flayer he was he would not
be considered for a place on the team.
I believe the hearts of all of the men
are in the right place and that they
are full of fight. I appreciate the at
tendance of the rooters at the prac
tices. We began the season with ab
solutely no knowledge of the Rugby
game and the rooters have stayed by
us and given us encouragement from
the start. You do not know how
much this means to the men who are
on the field.
"As to the outcome of the game I
want to siy to the student body right
here, 'Don t be guided by comparative
scores. They are deceptive. We
have a fighting chance, —only a fight
ing chance to win and that's all. I
hope we will win, as the men cer
tainly deserve to."
Dr. Gardner spoke a few words to
the students and warned all against
degrading the Stanford name by any
excesses alter the game.
"Dad" Moulton was optimistic and
in a short address which stirred the
audience to a fever pitch said the
outcome of the game was only a mat
ter of the size of the score. He
furthermore told of the speed of the
team. "Never have T seen such a
fast bunch of runners in one team be
fore. They are very tast and if the
Berkeley boys arc faster and huskier
than trie Stanford team, this is truly a
great ate for runners."
After the completion cf the regular
speeches R. J. McFadden, ex-'o4, was
called on for a short addiess. He
said that was a great game.

fore. They are very tast and if the
Berkeley boys arc faster and huskier
than trie Stanford team, this is truly a
great ate for runners."
After the completion cf the regular
speeches R. J. McFadden, ex-'o4, was
called on for a short addiess. He
said that was a great game.
The final send-oft" of the team was
held last night in Assembly Hall and
the enthusiasm of the rooters and
assembled students exceeded all pre
vious demonstrations. In the esti
mation of the oldest post-graduates
and members of the faculty last
night's jollification was the greatest
of its kind ever witnessed at Stan
ford. Every speaker was applauded

to the echo and the demonstration
given Coach Lanagan and the fifteen
men and substitutes excelled any
thing in the line of yelling heard in
many years. The tumultuous shout
ing and yelling when the team entered
was deafening and continued for sev
eral minutes without cessation.
The hall was packed to the doors
long before the scheduled time. All
-eats on the main lloor were lilled and
the gallery was taxed to the limit
by the women of the University and
interested members of the commun
ity. Veil Leaders Kellogg and llartz
ell kept the rooters busy until the
arrival of the team practicing the new
yells.
Professor A. H. Suzzallo of the
Education department opened the
rally with a brilliant and character
istic address. He was cheered heart
ily whenever he referred to the vic
tory of the Cardinal which was so
evidently to be the outcome of the
contest tomorrow. He told the stu
dents to mould the Freshmen into
good true Stanford men. In defin
ing the "Stanford Man" he told hum
orous stories touching the point
which brought down the house, lie
described the process of training the
new athletes as "Lanaganizing." He
said the game of Rugby was good for
both players and rooters.
Coach Tames F. Lanagan followed
Professor Suzzallo and in a direct and
plainly-worded speech told of the
prospects of the team and gave three
reasons why the successful candidates
"were selected. Tie said, "I want to


Trainer .Moolton
express tlie thanks and appreciation
of the squad, Trainer Moulton and
myself for the support which the
student body has given the Rugby
game. The game was not what the
students wanted but you have sup
ported it grandly. In selecting the
team three qualities have been observ
ed: first, the spirit of each man
has been taken into consideration;
second, an absolutely unselfish re
gard for fellow teammates, and third
and last a knowledge of the game.
All the men who have made the team
are absolutely unselfish. If any man
gave evidence that he wanted to make
all of the trys himself no matter how
good a flayer he was he would not
be considered for a place on the team.
I believe the hearts of all of the men
are in the right place and that they
are full of fight. I appreciate the at
tendance of the rooters at the prac
tices. We began the season with ab
solutely no knowledge of the Rugby
game and the rooters have stayed by
us and given us encouragement from
the start. You do not know how
much this means to the men who are
on the field.
"As to the outcome of the game I
want to siy to the student body right
here, 'Don t be guided by comparative
scores. They are deceptive. We
have a fighting chance, —only a fight
ing chance to win and that's all. I
hope we will win, as the men cer
tainly deserve to."
Dr. Gardner spoke a few words to
the students and warned all against
degrading the Stanford name by any
excesses alter the game.
"Dad" Moulton was optimistic and
in a short address which stirred the
audience to a fever pitch said the
outcome of the game was only a mat
ter of the size of the score. He
furthermore told of the speed of the
team. "Never have T seen such a
fast bunch of runners in one team be
fore. They are very tast and if the
Berkeley boys arc faster and huskier
than trie Stanford team, this is truly a
great ate for runners."
After the completion cf the regular
speeches R. J. McFadden, ex-'o4, was
called on for a short addiess. He
said that was a great game.
