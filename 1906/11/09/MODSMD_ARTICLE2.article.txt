Coaches Talk of Cardinal's Chances.
The coaches, trainer and captain
all realize that Stanford is facing a
hard proposition in tomorrow's game.
None of them expect an easy victory.
Their opinions on the Cardinal's
i chances follow:
Lanagan.
Coach Lanagan had little to say
when questioned as to Stanford's
chances. "It is going to he a hard
i

close fight and the team will have to
play its best to win. That's all," was
the way in which he summed up the
situation.
Bansbach.
Assistant Coach Bansbach said; "It
is going to be a very close game and
the team that wins will know that it
has been playing Rugby."
Moulton.
Trainer Moulton said: "Taken ns
a whole the team is in as good con

dition as any I have handled since I
have been here. Tliey are all fighters
and let me tell yon, tliey arc fifteen
of the fastest men in the State of
California."
Stott.
Captain Stott said: "We arc up
against a hard proposition and \vc
will have to play our best to win.
Every man is in fine condition."
Tomorrow afternoon on California
field the Cardinal and the Blue and
Gold will do battle in the greatest
athletic event of the year. The game
promises to be the most important
in the history of the two universities.
Coming as it does at the close of the
first Rugby season,it furnishes the
supreme test of the English game.
The future of football on the Coast
will be in the balance for two hours, i
while the success or failure of the
game will largely determine the fate
of Rugby.
Viewed from another standpoint,
j the struggle is one of momentous
interest. Through the series of inter
collegiate games, stretching back to
the beginning of things in 1892, no
team has won three successive games.
Tie or defeat has in cvey instance
broken the sequence. Stanford failed
in '98 and California in 1900. Tomor
row the Cardinal has her second
chance and backed by the spirit of
Lanagan, she may accomplish what
has hitherto been found impossible.
Stanford's team was announced to
the college world last night. Every
man on it won his place by hard
and consistent fighting and every
man on it is well worthy to represent
the Cardinal's honor tomorrow. Of
the difficulties and troubles attendant
upon the introduction of Rugby, it
is useless to speak here. Lanagan,
Hansbach and Stott have risen supe
rior to every difficulty and have ac
complished what was apparently im
possible. They have turned out a
team at a game, which none of them
had ever seen played, a team which
met a Canadian fifteen at their own
game and won from them two clean
cut victories. The credit for this


'liiAi.MRHS-Ccnter
brilliant performance rests primarily
with the coaches, but praise must also
be accorded to the squad and to the
bleachers who watched with patience
the slow development of a game to
which they were bitterly opposed.
Of Stanford's chances tomorrow it
is difficult to form any definite opin
ion. She has won all her preliminary
games by safe scores, while California
has lost twice to teams which have
fallen before the Cardinal. But pre
liminary games are notoriously 110
basis of comparison and especially is
this true at a game as uncertain as
Rugby, There is absolutely no ex
cuse or cause for overconfidence on
the part of the Stanford student body
Taylor has developed his men on
lines exactly opposite to those fol
lowed by Lanagan. Stanford, with
her splendid set of b'tcks and her fa»c
scrum, is essentiallj an aggress' v'e
team and does her hest work on the
attack. California has a magnificent
defense and prefers to stop up her op
ponent's plays and wait for the for
tunes of the game to give her an
opportunity to score. No team can
be anything but dangerous with such
men as Stanton and Schaeffer behind
the line.
The contest then will be primarily
1 i.e between an aggressive team and
a ccfcnsive team, a team which makes
it - , opportunities an! a 1 earn w'licii
..il-es them. The i v.i.lc cf such a con
l>i defies prophecy Ti. is idniirtcd
that Stanford > b.ickfiel.l is faster and
better at passing than California's.
It is admitted that the Cardinal will
have a slight advantage in working
the ball out of scrum. But on the
other hand it must be admitted that
California's scrum is heavier and
stronger defensively and that she has
in her backfield men who by their
individual speed and skill are dan
gerous at every stage of the game.
Rugby has developed no stars at
either university. The game is too
essentially unselfish to permit any
man to outshine his team-mates.
Both institutions will, therefore, be
represented by fifteens in which the
individual has been subordinated to
the team.
Passing rapidly over the opposing
scrums, Stanford will he outweighed
by over 40 pounds at the position of
wing forward, but Presley's speed and
aggressiveness should more than off
set this handicap. Molfino has han
dled Haffey successfully twice be
fore and he should have 110 trouble in
repeating the trick. Koerner and
Farmer are evenly matched. Behind
the front rank, California has a small
advantage in weight, but Pemberton,
Minturn, Stanford, Tliorpe and Cheda
should be able by their greater speed
to keep the Blue and Gold scrum
from doing any damage.
Behind the line the advantage is
all with the Cardinal. Owen and
Schaeffer are evenly matched hut
Chalmers and Edwards are faster and
stronger than their California oppo
nents. At five Stott is playing his
usual brilliant game and he should
be able to offset Stanton's speed by
his greater knowledge of the game.
TTolman and Laumeister are both fas
ter than Whitman and Dyer and both
show an excellent knowledge of the
game. Fetiton at full is Butler's su
perior at kicking and scooping.
All of Stanford's five substitutes

are Rood men who gave the varsity
players a close fight for their posi
tions and they should fill acceptably
any vacancies which may occur in the
line up. There seems to be small
probability, however, of any substi
tute leav'ng the side lines. "Dad"
has outdone himself and the team is
in the finest possible condition to go

[ the long route which is laid out for
theni Saturday.
Stanford has more than a fighting
chance to win, but her victory, if vic
tory it may he, will he hy a close
score. Lanagan's spirit and fifteen
fighting men make a combination
hard to beat and California has her

work cut out for lior if she iloin-s I< 1
serpentine lier own field on Saturday.
