Coaches Talk of Cardinal's Chances.
The coaches, trainer and captain
all realize that Stanford is facing a
hard proposition in tomorrow's game.
None of them expect an easy victory.
Their opinions on the Cardinal's
i chances follow:
Lanagan.
Coach Lanagan had little to say
when questioned as to Stanford's
chances. "It is going to he a hard
i

close fight and the team will have to
play its best to win. That's all," was
the way in which he summed up the
situation.
Bansbach.
Assistant Coach Bansbach said; "It
is going to be a very close game and
the team that wins will know that it
has been playing Rugby."
Moulton.
Trainer Moulton said: "Taken ns
a whole the team is in as good con

dition as any I have handled since I
have been here. Tliey are all fighters
and let me tell yon, tliey arc fifteen
of the fastest men in the State of
California."
Stott.
Captain Stott said: "We arc up
against a hard proposition and \vc
will have to play our best to win.
Every man is in fine condition."
Tomorrow afternoon on California
field the Cardinal and the Blue and
Gold will do battle in the greatest
athletic event of the year. The game
promises to be the most important
in the history of the two universities.
Coming as it does at the close of the
first Rugby season,it furnishes the
supreme test of the English game.
The future of football on the Coast
will be in the balance for two hours, i
while the success or failure of the
game will largely determine the fate
of Rugby.
Viewed from another standpoint,
j the struggle is one of momentous
interest. Through the series of inter
collegiate games, stretching back to
the beginning of things in 1892, no
team has won three successive games.
Tie or defeat has in cvey instance
broken the sequence. Stanford failed
in '98 and California in 1900. Tomor
row the Cardinal has her second
chance and backed by the spirit of
Lanagan, she may accomplish what
has hitherto been found impossible.
Stanford's team was announced to
the college world last night. Every
man on it won his place by hard
and consistent fighting and every
man on it is well worthy to represent
the Cardinal's honor tomorrow. Of
the difficulties and troubles attendant
upon the introduction of Rugby, it
is useless to speak here. Lanagan,
Hansbach and Stott have risen supe
rior to every difficulty and have ac
complished what was apparently im
possible. They have turned out a
team at a game, which none of them
had ever seen played, a team which
met a Canadian fifteen at their own
game and won from them two clean
cut victories. The credit for this
