On the eve of the first intercol
legiate Rugby game between the Var
sities of Stanford and California, the
Cardinal supporters extend best
wishes to the team and the assurance
that they will be back of the players
throughout every minute of the game.
No Stanford squad has ever had bet
ter support than the Rugby team this
year. Encouragement that was given
at first because the team was a Stan
ford team has become genuine loyalty
and unequalled enthusiasm. The
rooters will go to the game tomorrow
ready to fight with the Stanford fight
ing spirit against opponents proven
fair and sportsmanlike. No matter
what the outcome may be, Stanford's
name and spirit will be unÂ«cathed. It
is needless to speak of the confidence
the student body places in the work
of the coaches and trainer. Their ca
pabilities have been amply demon
strated in the past. To say that noth
ing but words of praise and admira
tion are to be heard for the showing
that the team has made this season,
both as regards training and coaching
is sufficient. The game tomorrow is
Stanford's opportunity to score a
third victory over the Blue and Gold.
