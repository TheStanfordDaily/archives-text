# STANFORD—6, CALIFORNIA—3
## LANAGAN'S TEAM WINS THIRD STRAIGHT VICTORY FROM BLUE AND GOLD. 
### 
Stanford swung her second ser
pentine across California Field 011
Saturday afternoon, breaking the in
tercollegiate record by winning three
straight varsity games and lowering
the colors of the Blue and Gold in the
first Rugby contest, by a score of 6-3.
Two penalties converted into goals by
Fenton's clever kicking gave Lana
gan's men their score. California suc
ceeded in rushing the ball over the
line early in the first half for a try
but after that one spurt she was con
sistently outplayed in every depart
ment of the game by the wearers of
the Cardinal, who menaced her line
at least four times in the later prog
ress of the game.
The game was the third triumph for
Lanagan's methods, and proved con
clusively that the Stanford coach, who
had never seen a Rugby game until
this season, was more than the master
of Taylor, who had learned the Eng
lish sport in New Zealand. But back
of Lanagan and his methods stand the
ultimate means by which his results
were accomplished—the fifteen men
who. turned defeat into victory for the
Cardinal. It was Fenton's good for
tune to win the game for his team l>y
grasping opportunities when they
came to him, but the men who drove
the ball into California territory and
worked into such positions that the
penalties might be put to the best ad
vantage, are 110 less deserving of
credit
California Field was in miserable
condition and in the first fifteen min
utes of play the roughness of the
ground and the superior weight of the
California scrum swept the Cardinal
forwards fairly off their feet and
finally ended in a California score.
Here "Dad'' Moulton's fine condition
ing became apparent and the Blue and
Gold worn out by their exertions were
driven slowly up the field until a foul
tackle gave Stanford her chance and
Fenton sent the ball between the
posts. Again in the second half Dad's
charges were fresher than ever, and
Christy was pouring stimulents into
the Blue and Gold forwards to keep
them at their work, the Stanford
scrum was working the ball down the
field until Fenton put over the win
ning kick. Three times the speedy
Cardinal backs worked the ball to the
five-yard line and three times they
lost their chance for a try by a lucky
play on the part of Taylor's men.
I'tilly fifteen thousand people saw
the game and the financial success of
the first Rugby season from a Stan
ford point of view seems to he as
sured. As a spectacular event the
first part of the game was not a suc
cess. Taylor's men followed their
tactics of the Freshman (?amc and
persisted in smothering the ball in

scrum, which their superior weight j
enabled them to do. Aside from i
some pretty punting and tackling by I
Cerf, Schaeffer and Whitman and '
some cool work by Butler at full their I
back-field did nothing, the redoubt- |
able Stanton failing to show the form :
with which he has been so often cred
ited. Koerner and Molfino in the |
front rank never failed to heel out the
ball from every scrum, and Minturn, {
Pemberton, Stanford, Cheda and
Thorpe behind them worked as one
man and for the greater part of the
game outplayed their heavier oppon
ents at dribbling and on the attack.
Presley at wing forward, although
outweighed over forty pounds and
pitted against Tuller, one of the most
formidable men on the California
team, slipped past his opponent on
every play and stopped up many of
California's advances single-handed.
Owen at half played a fairly steady
game although not up to his usual
form. Several times the ball was
heeled out of scrum and passed him
before he could pick it up. Stott and
Chalmers played brilliant ball. Both
of them made several clever runs
through scattered fields, and in this
department of the game Edwards and
Holman were not far behind. The
latter brought the bleachers to their
feet several times in the last half by
his dodging dashes down the touch--
lines for long gains, and the former
was responsible for a pretty piece of
Rugby, dropping a short punt of the
California tacklers and gathering it in
on the run for a substantial gain.
Laumeister played a line game on the
other wing and dropped Whitman
several times by clever tackles.
Aside from his goal kicking Fenton at
full pulled his team out of several
tight places. Twice his punting into
touch actually prevented tries by Cal
ifornia, and his scooping was fast and
accurate.
Unmack refereed an impartial game.
California's only legitimate complaint
can be that Stanford's penalties came
when they could be put to good use
while the Blue and Gold was unable
to accomplish anything with a like
number of penalty kicks. The two
Browns kept time and Percy Hall,
California's famous half-back, and
"Heff" Williams, Stanford's greatest
center, held the touch flags.
