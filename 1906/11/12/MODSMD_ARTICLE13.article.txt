# STANFORD YFLLING IS GOOD.
## No New Stunts Used. â€” California Makes Fine Showing. 
### 
The presence of the Stanford root
ers was marked by concentrated and
spirited yelling. By two o'clock the
majority of the Cardinal contingent
had taken their seats and yelling com
menced. The usual repartee between
the opposing rooting sections was in
dulged in, the chief occasion afforded
Stanford being the firing of bombs
from a mortar before the California
rooters, which broke into paper fig
ures and pennants in the air. New
stunts and new songs were conspic
uously absent from the Cardinal sec
tion. In accordance with a custom
that has been established in the last
two years, the Stanford rooters
formed a large block, white "S."
When the team appeared upon the
field, the rooters rose in a body,
cheering and scattering red confetti
over the bleachers. The men in the
"S" stood out in relief. But it was
not in exact position to be viewed
from the field and was promptly
righted.
The California rooters were clad in
white sh'rts, and the rows of men had
alternately blue and gold megaphones,
which were waved in a brilliant dis
piay.
A pigeon bearing cardinal ribbons
was released from the Stanford sec
tion twice and encircled the goal
posts. Barring some confusion which
existed between the two yell leaders,
and the rooters, the checring was
crditably conducted by yell-leaders R.
S. Kellogg, '07, and N. Hartzell,
'07. Most of Stanford's yelling was
done without megaphones, the result
being snappy and distinct.
When the game resulted in a vic
tory for the Cardinal, the Stanford
rooters poured forth from their sec
tion into the field and formed the
second serpentine danced by Stanford
011 California Field.
The megaphones for the game were
furnished by F. C. Thiele, the cloth
used in making the "S" by E. Wilson,
the confetti by C. E. Haskell, and the
red fire for Thursday night's rally by
Frazer and Company.
