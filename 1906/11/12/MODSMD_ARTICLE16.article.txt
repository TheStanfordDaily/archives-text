Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
I wish to call attention to the prac
tice which is coming into vogue of
farming football tickets. The sys
tem of allowing certain ones to act
as authorized agents for others up
to the number of fifty in procuring
tickets and charging a nominal sum
for their trouble is allowable, al
though it is a poor system. But
when these agents abuse their privi
lege, as some did in the recent sale,
their action becomes unbearable. The
practice on the part of students who
indulged in the speculation was to
sign names of other students from
whom they had asked no permission
whatsoevei, in order to fill out the
number of procurable tickets. Tick
ets thus obtained were withheld with
the demand for a much higher com
mission on them, while the speculator
was safeguarded from loss by the
promise A the management to take
off his hands any tickets remaining
unsold. It ought not to have to be
pointed out that speculation on the
part of individuals in student body
property is dishonest, and that the
usual weak, would-be justification
that "everybody else did the same,"
and that "the same thing was done
last year," is no justification at all
but only makes matters worse.
