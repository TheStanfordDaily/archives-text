Stanford won a deserved and well
earned victory Saturday when Cali
fornia's Varsity was bested for the
third consecutive time. The game
did not fulfill the expectations of its
supporters, but was a very creditable
exhibition of Rugby when the fact
that both universities have studied it
but little more than two months is
considered. The possibilities of the
game are evident, however, and with
a more thorough developemnt and a
better understanding it should be able
to hold its place as an intercollegiate
sport. The first season's test has
been even more satisfactory than
could have been expected.
Great credit is due to Coach Lana
gan and Assistant-Coach Bansbach,
for the showing they have made with
the new game. They struggled
against tremendous odds, and the vic
tory Saturday is a fitting testimonial
to their work. Trainer Moulton re
peated Irs past successes in bringing
about the excellent condition of the
men.
Of the work of Captain Stott and
his team-mates it need only be said
that the University is justly proud of
the manner in which the players
adapted themselves to the new game,
and of the record of a season through
which the Cardinal Varsity passed un
defeated.
If Rugby is to continue as the game
of the Coast universities, the season
demonstrates that it will be success
ful.
