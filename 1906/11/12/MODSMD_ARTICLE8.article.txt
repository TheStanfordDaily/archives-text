# No Trip to Nevada.

### 
The Cardinal fifteen will not take .1
trip to Reno 011 the 17th of November
to play the University of Nevada.
The long strain of training for the
California game would have rendered
it almost impossible for the men to
make the trip in any kind of condi
tion. In all probability the team will
visit British Columbia during the
Christmas vacation and will meet
Vancouver, Victoria and Nanaimo.
In case this trip is taken the team
will go into light training after the
Thanksgiving vacation.
