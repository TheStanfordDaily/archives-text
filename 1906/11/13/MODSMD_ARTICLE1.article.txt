# INN WILL OPEN SOON
## STUDENT TO UNDERTAKE MANAGEMENT OF EATING PLACE. Campus Establishment Will Accomodate Encina Men By First of Next Semester. 
### 
The Stanford Inn will open for
student boarders the first of next
semester. W. C. Shelton, '08, today
announced that the Board of Trustees,
acting through treasurer C. G. Lath
rop, has granted him the lease of the
establishment and that with the open
ing of college after the Christmas va
cation he will conduct the eating place
upon a basis similar to that followed
by the co-operative clubs of College
Terrace and Palo Alto. All boarders
will be charged $15 a month.
The proposition of Shelton has met
with the hearty co-operation of the
trustees and treasurer Lathrop, and is
considered by them the only possible
solution of the campus eating ques
tion. President Jordan is in favor of
the plan and already fifty students
have requested the new manager to
consider them as future patrons, ft
is expected that the majority of the
students eating at the private board
ing places will also transfer to the
more centrally located eating place.
The Inn will suffer a change in
name as well as character of manage
ment. As the establishment is in
tended primarily to accomodate the
men students who eat at the co-oper
ative clubs and who for the greater
part are residents of Encina Hall.
Shelton proposes to have his venture
known as the "Encina Inn." He is
not sure of the title but expects this
will be the name.
The plans of Shelton which have
been acted upon favorably have been
before the committee of the Board of
Trustees for the greater part of two
months. Besides the Inn proper, sev
eral concessions have been granted
the student manager. An up-to-date
ice-cream parlor will be conducted. It
is also expected that a portion of the
building will be turned into a club
room for Encina men, and a general
meeting place. The whole idea of the
new management is to conduct the
place as an ideal eating place of stud
ents at which the customary air of a
public restaurant will be omitted.
The main dining-room of the eating
establishment will be decorated with
trophies and varsity colors. It will
be a meeting place for all students.
At first no accommodations will be
attempted for tourists and transient
boarders. Later on it is planned to
have a portion of the building re
served for this branch of patronage.
Tables will be reserved in the main
dining rooms for congenial clicks and
club life within a club will lie ob
served. The proposition has been
brought before the eating clubs of
College Terrace for consideration.
The equipment of the Inn will be
overhauled and the entire building put
into shape during the mid-winter re
cess and the doors opened for busi
ness the first day the University is in
session.
