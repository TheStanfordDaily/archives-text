Although Stanford showed better
spirit Saturday than California, and
yelled harder for the team in adversity
than for the team in triumph, the
showing made, in respect to original
ity and well conducted rooting, was
admittedly poorer than that of the
California contingent. For this the
rooters cannot be held blameworthy,
for no Varsity was ever supported by
a more enthusiastic rooting section.
The responsibility for the confusion
and the unoriginal character of the
Stanford showing must be borne by
the yell leader. This state of affairs
was doubtless the result of uninten
tional negligence, largely, we think, in
the failure to make adequate prepara
tion for the game, both in preliminary
practice and in previously worked up
"stunts." Whether this can in a mea
sure be attributed to any lack of spirit
on the part of the student body in
cident to the new game, we are not
prepared to say. It is true that the
University did not respond in the old
way to the first appeals for enthusi
asm over Rugby. At all events, the
fact remains that Stanford's rooting
this year does not compare favorably
with that of previous football seasons.
We hope that whatever changes may
be necessary for its improvement will
be brought about before Stanford en
ters the intercollegiate baseball and
track contests next spring. The hap
hazard methods of the season just
closed should not again be noticeable.
