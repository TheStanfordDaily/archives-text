# UNMACK REPLIES TO CRITICS.
## Says California Takes Defeat In Unsportsmanlike Way. 
### 
Referee Unmack made the follow
ing reply to the criticisms of the Cali
fornia partisans in the "Chronicle"
this morning.
Sporting Editor "Chronicle"—l have
been accused of having shown the
Stanford team favoritism in the Rug
by game, which 1 refereed last Satur
day. 1 wish to state through your
columns that I had no favorites and
that 1 showed no favors. I played
the teams strictly to the rules, and my
conscience is clear.
If that is the only way partisans of
a California team can take a defeat —
blamiUg the referee—then I am sorry
for their sporting instincts. For men
to say what was quoted in your col
umns in Sunday's issue, just goes to
show they have no honest sporting
blood.
I did what I could on several oc
casions preceding the big game to
help both teams in their efforts to ac
quire Rugby form. I have neglected
my business and have lost money
through attending the various
matches, and the only thanks 1 get is
censure and ingratitude.
I do not know Mr. Pat O'Dea, nor
did I ever hear of him before, but
I notice by his account of the game
that he has played Rugby himself, and
I thank him for his remarks as to
my refereeing.
1 have refereed my last match.
Never in all my experience as an
athlete, football player or referee,
have 1 come across a team that took
a fair and honest beating so badly as
this Berkeley varsity.
The penalties from which Stanford
scored were for breaches under rule
ii. A referee's duties at any time are
not all champagne and oysters. There
are many things he possibly may not
see, through players getting in his
way and for other reasons and when
he happens to be on the blind side of
the scrum. It is for these things that
a referee is adversely criticised, when
he is doing his best to give his de
cisions on what he does see.
I shall make no further comment
on whatever may appear in the pa
pers, and only the remarks quoted in
Sunday's edition have drawn these
lines from me. Yours truly,
WILLIAM UNMACK.
