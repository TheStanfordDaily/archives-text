# Debating Try-outs Postponed.
## 
### 
At a joint conference between the
debating squads of the Sophomore
and Freshmen classes and represent
atives of the Intersociety Debating
League recently, it was decided to
postpone the tryouts for the interclass
debate, in order to give more time for
preparation. The annual debate be
tween the two lower classes will be
held Dcember Bth, as scheduled, 'flic
tryouts for places 011 the Sophomore
team will lie held November 20th; the
Freshman tryouts coming on the 19th.
Owing to the large number of entries
for the Freshman tryouts it will prob
ably be necessary to have the debates
of the first two grades in the afle
noon.
It has been decided by the Interso
ciety Debating League to require all
the speakers to deliver a four-minute
rebuttal in addition to their regular
speeches. This step has been taken
for the reason that it is necessary that
every member of the team be able
to do extemporaneous work, and it
is impossible to judge of their ability
to do this unless they are required to
deliver a rebuttal in the tryouts. Ac
cordingly, as soon as the speakers on
each squad have finished their main
speech, each speaker in regular order
will have four minutes for rebuttal.
1 he main argument will be limited
to seven minutes each.
