# WILL NOT HOLD RALLY
## NOT ENOUGH INTEREST TO WARRANT A CELEBRATION. Saturday's Victory Was Enthusiastically Received But Excitement Is Now Over. 
### 
it lias been definitely decided by the
yell leaders that no rally will be held
in celebration of the Rugby victory
last Saturday. The principal reason is
that there seems to be no particular
enthusiasm and these rallies after the
game seldom aroused much interest.
This is the situation at present, and
consequently no attempt will be made
to hold a rally. There was plenty of
enthusiasm before the game, and the
rally for the team last Thursday night
was the best ever seen at Stanford,
but now that the game is past the
interest is gone. It is extremely
doubtful if a successful rally could be
held and the yell leaders have con
cluded that it is far better not to hold
a rally than to have a poor one. The
rooters, as well as the players, are too
busy with their studies to spare the
time for a rally when there is no par
ticular necessity for it.
It has been suggested that there is
less enthusiasm over this Rugby vic
tory than there was in the old inter
collegiate football triumphs. How
ever, this does not seem to be the
case, judging from the sentiments ex
pressed by many of the prominent
members of the student body. Sat
urday's victory was as enthusiastically
received as any recent Stanford vic
tory. The reason for not holding a
rally is that these rallies have not
liecn successful in the past and there
is 110 reason to believe that this sea
son would be an exception.
