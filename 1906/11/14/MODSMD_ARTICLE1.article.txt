# ON BOARD OF CONTROL
## BODY TO SUPERCEDE TRAINING HOUSE CORPORATION. Student and Faculty Members Chosen, and Two Alumni Vacancies Will Be Filled Soon. 
### 
The faculty Board of Control which
is to take the place of the old Train
ing House Corporation now lacks but
two members to make the board com
plete. Dr. F. Angell, chairman of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, C. F.
Laumeister, '07, president of the stu
dent body, and C. R. Crider, '07, sec
retary of the student body, are mem
bers ex-ofificio. President Jordan has
appointed Professor C. B. Wing to
ini the other faculty position. The
two vacancies on the board will be
filled by the election of alumni mem
bers, which will probably take place
within the next week.
This board, when brought into ex
istence, will have full control of all
affairs formerly in the hands of the
Training House Corporation. The
Executive Committee in its meeting
Oct. 10th, tabled indefinitely the
Board of Control, which through a
misunderstanding was to be created
by the students instead of the faculty,
and thus opened the way for the cre
ation of this board by President Jor
dan. It is very probable that the new
board will be complete within two
weeks, as the only action necessary
in the alumni body, is an election of
two members through their executive
committee.
