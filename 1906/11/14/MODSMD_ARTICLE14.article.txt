The following interesting comment
on the conduct of the Stanford stu
dents at the Ye Liberty Theatre, in
Oakland, the night of the football
game, appeared in the editorial col
umns of Tuesday's edition of the
"Oakland Herald":
"Dr. Jordan owes a stern rebuke to
the "muckers" of Stanford that came
to Oakland to "root" for their foot
ball team and remained to disturb the
peace of this community and to dis
grace their college.
"These young men took possession
of a theatre in this city and by their
rowdyism and obscenity first drove
decent people out of the place and
then compelled the stage manager to
ring down the curtain and turn out
the lights.
"Such conduct is more than repre
hensible—it is outrageous. It trans
cends the extreme latitude that is
usually accorded to the college youth
when he "runs in gangs" after a great
college event. The objection in this
instance was not .so much to the noisy
demonstrations of the Stanford mob
as to the vile language used by the
more drunken members of the classes.
This language was uttered in the
presence of respectable and modest
women —wives, daughters and sisters
of Oakland citizens who were entitled
by payment of money at the door to
sit in the auditorium of the theater
and witness the play as it progressed
on the stage. These women were
compelled to leave the theater to
these beer-bloated "muckers" of Stan
ford to avoid further shame of listen
ing to words and epithets that could
only have been used in a brothel; no
self-respecting saloon-keeper would
have permitted the obscenity within
the portals of his place of business,
however free these Stanford hood
lums might have been in the expend
iture of their money over his bar.
"In exemplary contrast to the
"rough house" created by the Mo
hawks of Stanford was the jovial as
sembly of the California "rooters" at

another theater—Homeric as regards
noise, as was to be expected, but de
cent in conduct and language. The
women of the audience were not
forced to leave the theater and the
performance was assisted by the wit
and good humor of the boys rather
than retarded —and none of the C.ili
fornians were drunk."
It is with a great deal of reluctance
that the"Daily Palo Alto" consents
to take notice of anything as filthy
as the above clipping. Although we
realize that an attack printed in the
editorial columns of the "Oakland
Herald" can do Stanford students lit
tle harm in the estimation of think
nig people, there is a possibility that
the paper may fall into the hands of
some stranger, uninformed as to the
"Herald's" character, who may place
some credence in the charges laid at
our door.
For the benefit of such people we
wish to say that when the "Oakland
Herald" states that Stanford students
used obscene language at the produc
tion of "The Admirable Crighton,"
or acted in any way that might give
rise to a legitimate charge of mucker
ism, that sheet utters a malicious and
uncalled-for lie.
In the theater Saturday evening
were many Stanford women, and
they are unanimous in saying that
they heard nothing but a good ma
tured jollification and joshing of the
production. We are at a loss to un
derstand the motive of the "Herald"
in its cowardly attack. The only ex
planation that seems at all plausible
is that their representative at the play
was himself intoxicated.
