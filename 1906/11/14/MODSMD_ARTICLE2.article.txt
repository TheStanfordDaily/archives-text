# RECEIPTS ARE LARGE
## $13,400 STANFORD'S APPROXIMATE SHARE. Joint Expenses Are About $400, Which Compare Favorably with Those of Past Years.

Manager D. D. Sales, '06 returned
this afternoon from Berkeley and an
nounced that the total receipts from
the intercollegiate football game were
$27,186. This amount far exceeds the
expectations of the most hopeful and
compares very favorably with the re
ceipts of former years, the 1904 game
being the only one at which there was
a larger gate. That year the receipts
totaled over $30,000, but at the '05
contest only $24,000 was taken in.
The expenses this year amounted to
about $400, so Stanford's share of the
receipts will be approximately $13,400.
Manager Sales is extremely pleased
with the showing made.
The seat sale for the performance
of "The Admirable Crichton" at Ye
Liberty Theatre Saturday night net
ted the student body the unexpect
edly large sum of $728. The entire
house was bought up by the Graduate
Manager for $900, but the sale
amounted to over $r,600, the audit
orium being packed to the doors.
