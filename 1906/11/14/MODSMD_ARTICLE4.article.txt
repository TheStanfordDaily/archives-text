# OLDER SCORES RUEF
## FLAYS BOSS AND HIS CONSTITUENTS AS CORRUPT. Managing Editor of San Francisco "Bulletin" Tells of Municipal Corruption. 
### 
At a well attended meeting of the
Social Service Club last night at the
Phi Gamma Delta house, Fremont
Older, managing editor of the San
Francisco "Bulletin," spoke on the
"Political aspects of newspaper work
and its influence in developing a
proper attitude toward the duties of
citizenship."
Older explained in a very pointed
and personal talk, that the subject of
his speech was gleaned from first-hand
observation of political conditions in
San Francisco today, as a newspaper
man. He laid great stress upon the
fact that the American people are
giving more attention nowadays to
luxurious living, and less attention to
the vital political questions of the
time, thus bringing about an excess
ively evil social system, which makes
lieroes out of criminals who move in
high society.
"Today business men cater to cor
rupt politicians in order to gain per
sonal benefit, and they even go so
far as to elect a man to contral the
money of the state or city, whom
they would not, under any circum
stances, allow to handle their own
funds."
"The most respectable citizens feel
honored to accept an invitation to
dine with soulless corruptionists and
unconvicted criminals."
He applied many of the points of
his talk to Abraham Ruef, the "boss"
of San Francisco, and he flayed the
government of that municipality as
unscrupulous and immoral. He also
illustrated very aptly how machine
politics nominate and elect the of
ficers of government.
His talk was ended by laying par
ticular emphasis upon the ability and
duty of college men to go out into
the world today, alive and ready for
opportunities to stand for clcan poli
tics and higher ideals.
President Walter Y. Wentz, '06,
announced to the club the receipt
from Ex-Mayor James D. Phelan, of
San Francisco, of a valuable copy of
the Burnham plans for the beautifica
tion of San Francisco, as a gift to the
club.
