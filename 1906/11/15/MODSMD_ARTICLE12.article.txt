# THANKSGIVING MEET
## OLYMPIC CLUB WILL HOLD TRACK CONTEST. Trainer Moulton May Enter a Team in the Mile Belay.â€”Track Men Are Busy. 
### 
Fall training on the track is pro
gressing well and every afternoon
there are twenty or thirty men ont for
work. Now that football is over
Trainer Moulton can give his entire
attention to the track men and he is
out on the old track every afternoon.
The Fall track meet is scheduled for
Saturday, November 24th, and most
of the men will be in fair condition by
that date.
There will be a track meet held in
the Golden Gate Park Stadium on
Thanksgiving Day under the auspices
of the Olympic Club. Trainer Chris
tie of California expects to enfer a
large number of his men in this meet.
There are to be seventeen events and
four of these will be handicapped.
Although Trainer Moulton would like
to enter a few men in this meet it
does not seem likely that any of the
Cardinal runners will appear. In
speaking of the meet yesterday after
noon "Dad" said: "I would like to
enter four or five half-milers but I
will be unable to as my middle dist
ance men are not in condition and
several of them have not been train
ing this fall. It ought to be a good
meet and I would like to have some
Stanford runners entered but I do not
want any of the men to enter in the
meet unless they are in the best poss
ible condition. Now that Rugby is
over there will be more men out on
the track but they will not have time
to get into condition for a hard meet
on Thanksgiving Day. There is a
possibility that we may enter a team
in the five-man mile relay if our men
get into shape. This is the only event
that is likely to contain a Stanford
entry."
Captain Macfarland of the track
team says that he does not think Stan
ford will enter any men in the
Thanksgiving Day meet.
