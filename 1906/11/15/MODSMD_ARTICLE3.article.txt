# READY FOR PLUG-UGLY
## JUNIOR PRODUCTION OF "THE FLEECERS" TOMORROW NIGHT. Farce Begins at Eight O'clock on Old Football Oval.â€”Admission 25c. 
### 
Arrangements for the Plug-Ugly
have been completed and everything
is in readiness for the production of
the Junior play tomorrow evening at
8 o'clock on the old football field.
The cast has been holding rehears
als for the last two weeks, and have
been meeting every day during the
past week. The final rehearsal was
held this afternoon. The scenery has
been made especially for the produc
tion and the fact that the stage man
agement is in the hands of Sword and
Sandals insures success from that
standpoint. Two new scenes will be
used, the first being an interior, and
the second, which will be used in the
second and third acts, is a vivid rep
resentation of the lower regions.
The outline of the plot is substan
tially as follows: A number of pro
fessors, while meeting in a room at
Mayfield, are spied upon by two
Juniors. The latter are discovered,
and one escapes. The other Juniors
is held by the professors. The Junior
class is aroused and attempts a rescue
but the professors escape with their
victim. However, they meet with an
accident and are killed.
The second scene takes place in the
lower regions. The devil, in company
with his attendants, receive the pro
fessors, and release their captive Ju
nior. The professors are then brought
before a tribunal and punished accord
ing to the ideas of the Juniors.
The devil is appealed to about the
plugs, the money for them having
been taken by the professors. The
devil makes an attempt to get it but
fails, thereupon the enraged Juniors
start after the professors.
The third scene is the same as the
second. The professors arc again
brought forward. This time they
weaken and promise to regain the
hats. One professor is sent for the
hats while the revels continue. The
professor returns but has only a por
tion of the hats. The Juniors, again
enraged, condemn the professors to
life servitude and go after the hats
and recover them in the midst of great
rejoicing.
The cast of the Plug Ugly is as fol
