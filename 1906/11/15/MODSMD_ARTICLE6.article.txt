# ERSKINE ON RUGBY
## ENGLISH GAME PRAISED BY ASSEMBLY SPEAKER. Richard M. Hotaling Gives Pertinent Advice in Witty and Well Received A dress. 
### 
The fifth regular assembly was held
this morning in Assembly Hall at the
fourth hour. Richard M. Hotaling
and Douglas Erskine were the speak
ers of the occasion and were received
with much enthusiasm by the assem
bled students. The gathering lacked
the marked enthusiasm of some of
the previous meetings but made up in
jollity. The first speaker, "Dick" Ho
taling, had the audience convulsed for
the greater part of his allotted time.
Douglas Erskine told of the relative
merits of the two football games un
der consideration 011 this coast.
Dr. Frank Angcll occupied the
chair of Dr. Jordan today in the ab
sence of the president and vice-presi
dent of the University. He intro
duced Hotaling first and spoke of the
San Franciscan as a well known Bo
hemian.
Hotaling had the sympathies of the
students with him from the start. He
declared at the outset that he would
talk about the students and in his
terse and brilliantly witty manner
went 011 to give advice which had a
deep significance but was enlightened
by his constant oratorical ability and
pertinent slang which appealed to all.
His stage presence and delivery, as
well as his subject, was interesting.
He began at the beginning of the
career of a student. He told of the
first appearance of the freshman. The
type of entrant who is "fresh" was es
pecially alluded to. The merits of the
tub were expounded by the speaker
who declared however, he would not
put himself on record as an exponent
of this form of discipline. He de
clared that the "tubbee" usually learns
that, "It is better to know less than
a whole lot that is wrong." The cig
arette period, and the "booze fest"
were explained and commented upon
in picturesque slang.
In his advice the speaker declared
that at the outset young people should
be true to themselves and obey their
natures rather than to aspire to im
possible ideals. "Laugh all you can,
sullenness is never regarded as dig
nity," lie continued. In conclusion he
spoke of college friendships and ama
teur theatricals, advising the making
of the former and the participation in
the latter.
Douglas Erskine, who has played
at both Rugby and intercollegiate
games of football, followed Hotaling.
His ideas of the relative merits of the
fitness of the two branches of the
sport were listened to with rapt at
tention on the part of all present.
Erskine stated clearly that he be
lieved that the new game was by all
odds the best sport for intercollegiate
contests. He explained his preference
at length. Before beginning his ad
dress he took advantage of the oppor
tunity to declare that it was his honest
opinion that in the intercollegiate
match with the University of Califor
