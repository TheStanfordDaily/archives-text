In iiis speech before the student
body assembly this morning, Douglas
Erskine said, "You have given both
the Rugby and American games a fair
trial and you are now in a position
to decide which you think is the best
game." His statement is worthy of
careful consideration by every mem
ber of the student body. The ques
tion may or may not be open to dis
cussion. The decision in that matter
rests ultimately with the faculties of
the two universities. They abolished
the old game and recommended that
Rugby be adopted as a substitute un
til such time as modifications in the
rules of intercollegiate football might
remove their objections to that game.
Whether they consider the revised
game as played in the East today to
have done away with those objections,
it is now impossible to say. If they
do consider that these objections have
been removed, the ultimate decision
will rest with the student body.
Should need for decision arise, every
member of the student body should
be able to give his individual opinion
and to give it quickly. The decision
may never fall to us, but if it does we
must be ready to make our choice
fairly and intelligently.
