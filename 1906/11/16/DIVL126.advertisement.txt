TO TELL THE TRUTH
Our glasses are not different from
those fitted by others. It's the fitting
that makes the difference.
You might have a solid gold frame
and pehble lenses costing $20, but if
the lenses were not properly fitted to
correct your visual defect, and relieve
your eye-strain, they would be worth
less to you than a brass frame and a
common glass lens, provided the lens
was "RIGHT JUST RIGHT.'
After all it's the fitting of the lenses
that makes the difference between sat
isfactory glasses and those that are
not so.
Our guarantee of "entire satisfac
tion" covers every point; fit of lenses,
style of frame and price.
