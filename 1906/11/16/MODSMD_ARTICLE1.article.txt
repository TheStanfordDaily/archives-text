# LANAGAN TO GO EAST
## COACH WILL WITNESS YALEHARVARD AND OTHER GAMES. Executive Committee Takes Unexpected Action Last Night at Special Meeting. 
### 
Coach Lanagan will leave for the
East on Saturday to witness as many
of the big games under the new rules
as time will permit. This was decided
by the Executive Committee at a spe
cial meeting last night.
A week ago the Executive Commit
tee voted to do away with Lanagan's
Eastern trip this year in view of the
fact that Rugby would probably be
the game here next year. At that
meeting the proposition of sending
the coach East irrespective of what
game would be played, was thor
oughly discussed but the state of the
student body finances at that time was
such that the committee feared to or
der what might prove an unnecessary
expense.
The unexpected success of the big
game from a financial standpoint and
the growing sentiment among the
players and the student body have
since appeared to justify the expense.
Accordingly a special meeting was
called last night at which Coach Lan
agan, E. P. Stott, '07, A. J. Chalmers,
'07, and W. E. Lyons, '07, were also
present. Lanagan placed himself en
tirely at the disposal of the commit
tee, and stated that whatever action
they might take would govern him in
the matter.
Stott, Lyons and Chalmers all made
speeches on their views of the situa
tion. The opinion seemed to prevail
that the uncertainty of the situation
would make Lanagan's trip a necess
ity, even though Rugby should be the
game played here next year. The
committee then voted that Lanagan
should go East.
The most important game of the
year —the Yale-Princeton contest—
will be played this Saturday. Prince
ton has by far the strongest and fast
est team in the East this year and it
is regrettable that Lanagan will miss
this game. He will arrive in time to
witness the Yale-Harvard and the
Army-Navy games, and will have the
benefit of two weeks with Reid, one
of the greatest football coaches in the
United States. Lanagan will also try
to see Middle-Western football, when
Chicago and Wisconsin clash. The
whole trip will keep the coach away
from the campus fully three weeks
but the experience and insight into the
new rules which he will gain are sure
to prove invaluable, should Stanford
return to the old game next season.
