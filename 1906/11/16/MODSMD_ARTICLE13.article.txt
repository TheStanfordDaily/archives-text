# SENIORS DECIDE ON PICTURES
## Two Group Photographs Will Be Taken for the 1007 "Quad." 
### 
At the Senior class meeting held
this afternoon it was decided that the
class should have two group pictures
in the '07 "Quad," one of the women
and one of the men. The picture of
the men in the Senior class will be
taken at 1:15 Tuesday on the steps of
Encina Hall, and the women's picture
will be taken on the Roble steps at
1:15 on Wednesday. This decision
was reached after some discussion in
which the impossibility of having in
dividual pictures of members of the
class was explained. The managers
of the '07 "Quad" also emphasized the
importance of an immediate payment
of the "Quad" assessment of $2.00.
The paying of this assessment entitles
the Senior to a copy of the "Quad."
Chairman L. M. Edwards, of the
Senior Circus Committee, reported
that the committee was progressing
very satisfactorily with all its plans
and that it was only a matter of class
support to assure the success of the
circus. He urged ever member of the
class to be willing to take any part in
the affair that may be assigned and by
doing this the circus is sure to be
high class and will be a financial suc
cess.
