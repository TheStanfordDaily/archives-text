# NO FALL PRACTICE
## BASEBALL SQUAD WILL NOT TRAIN THIS SEMESTER. Nine Veterans Make Prospects for a Winning Team Next Year Unusually Bright. 
### 
In accordance with Coach Lanagan's
policy to discourage fall baseball prac
tice no work will be attempted by the
players this semester. It is doubtful
whether Lanagan will be upon the
campus much of the time and in addi
tion the large numebr of baseball
players who came out for Rugby has
made it inadvisable to continue ath
letic training for these men.
Never before have the prospects for
a successful team been brighter than
this year. Nine veterans of the team
of last semester have returned. The
only player who is not eligible to
compete against California is D. D.
Sales, '06, ex-captain and pitcher.
With a veteran player who has been
in competition with California in ev
ery position except pitcher, the line-up
should present a strong bid for the
scries in 1907. Under the present sys
tem of competition for each place the
old men will not be given any pref
erence over the new aspirants, and
marked changes may occur in the per
sonnel of the Varsity before the sea
son of next semester is completed.
G. J. Presley, '07, who leads the team
this year, is a veteran of two seasons.
His work at first base has been a feat
ure of the Stanford game. In spite
of the fact that he lacks the height
commonly supposed to be a prere
quisite for a first base man he has
managed to cover the bag with pre
cision.
E. P. Stott, '07, has played behind
the bat for two years and will prob
ably hold the same position this year.
H. P. Daily, '07, who was an able
substitute last season, will again be a
candidate for the team. Daily
played in several of the more import
ant practice games last spring.
W. C. Thiele, '08, and G. L. Good
ell, '09, are the only remaining mem
bers of the squad of last year who
showed marked ability in the box.
Both Thiele and Goodell were re
garded as possible substitutes for Sales
last year. Whitmcr, '09, was also a
promising twirler but he has not re
turned this semester.
J. H. Bell, '08, varsity second base
man for two years, is eligible this year
for his old position. J. S. Wood
bury, '09, who held this bag on the
Freshman class team, will be out for
the Varsity this year.
K. L. Fenton, '08, is probably the
only candidate for third base. C. E.
Sampson, '09, at short stop, is in col
lege and should give all competitors
a hard race.
In the outfield four veterans are eli
gible; E. G. Dudley, '06, at right field,
C. C. Owen, '00, at center and A. J.
Chalmers, '07, and T. R. Cadwalader,
09, ;it left field. Chalmers played in
the first game at left field and Cad
walader in the second.
The men were especially trained in
batting last year and showed a de
cided improvement over former teams.
With another year of training under

Lanagan the team should be hard to
defeat.
