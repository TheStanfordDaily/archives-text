# SCENERY IS STOLEN
## SENIORS BORROW PLUG-UGLY PROPERTIES. 1907 Men Hold Up Expressmen, But Later Purloined Articles Are Returned. 
### 
The Seniors stopped the expressman
who was delivering the scenery for
the "Fleecers" this morning, assured
him that they were the rightful own
ers, and prevailed upon him to turn
over to them the properties which he
had instructions to take elsewhere.
The 1907 men carried the six bundles,
representing chiefly the infernal
regions, over to Stanford Field and
the Arboretum and carefully concealed
them.
The non-delivery of the scenery im
mediately sent several Juniors upon a
search for the missing articles. The
driver of the express wagon was
hunted down and was much surprised
to learn that he had stirred up so
much trouble by delivering his load
to the wrong persons. What the
"boys" had done with the properties
he hadn't the slightest idea. They had
assured him that it was "all right,"
and he had paid no further attention
to them.
The scencry, however, was pur
chased by the Junior Class through
Sword and Sandals, and since that or
ganization was responsible for its de
livery, the 1908 men reported their
loss, and the members of the dramatic
society went out to explain the matter
to the three Seniors who had started
the controversy.
When it was made clear that the
properties belonged to Sword and San
dals, the business manager of that
society was informed where the miss
ing scenery was and accom
panied by a guard of several Junior*,
the articles were located and carried
to the field.
