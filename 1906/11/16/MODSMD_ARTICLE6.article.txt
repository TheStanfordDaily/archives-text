# SEE TALKS ON EARTHQUAKES
## Says Steam Pressure Under Earth's Crust Causes Quaking. 
### 
Professor T. J. J. See, of the Naval
Observatory, Mare Island, spoke last
night in the chapel, under the aus
pices of Sigma Xi, on the "Causes of
Earthquakes."
After a study of all the chief earth
quakes of the world. Professor See
declares it his own theory that earth
quakes are due to the development of
steam pressure just under the earth's
crust, chiefly from the penetration of
sea water from the leakage of ocean
beds. The earth has a temperature
of about 2.000 degrees at a depth of
twenty miles, and when the steam
pressure ten or fifteen miles deep has
become great enough, it shakes the
crust and obtains relief at the margins
of the sea by tht pushing up of moun
tains. All mountain ranges are formed
in this way and that is why they are
all parallel to the sea.
The speaker said that we can al
ways expect earthquakes on this coast,
but that if we build properly 110 dan
ger need be anticipated from them.
