# GUILD MAKES REPORT
## PATIENTS FOR THREE MONTHS NUMBER 112. Hospital in Good Financial Condition.—University of California Wants Similar Institution. 
### 
The Guild Hospital has admitted
112 patients since the first of August,
1906. Of this number eighteen were
admitted during August, there being
nine students and nine outside cases.
During September thirty-six were ad
mitted, twenty-four students and
twelve outsiders; during October
forty-eight, twenty-four st: lents and
twenty-four outsiders; during Novem
ber to date ten, seven students and
three outsiders. These cases have in
their variety and nature of service
taxed the facilities of the hospital to
the utmost. It has been exceedingly
difficult to obtain special nurses ow r
ing to the large number of cases r.
quiring nursing about the bay during
this fall. Miss T. M. Caine has been
appointed to the staff until January
xst, 1907.
In order to provide better accom
modations for the executive nurse and
to enlarge the guild office alterations
are being made in the rooms of the
first division of the hospital. These
will be completed within a few days.
Representatives of the University of
California recently investigated the
Stanford Guild Hospital in.relation to
their plans for the university hospital
they expect to open to the students
in January. As is the case of the
Guild, they have had to remodel an
old house 011 the campus.

The total expenditures for the
month of October were $1,249.37.
The hospital charges to patients for
August were $636.32, for September
they amounted to $809.66, and for Oc
tober $840, making a total of $2,285.98.
The total expenditures for the three
months amounted to $4,337.21. Ap
proximately $900 of this was expended
during August for buildings, payments
to the Building and Loan Association,
and insurance. Thus the usual run
ning expenses would amount to about
$3,437.21. Deducting the $2,285.98 de
rived from the fees charged patients
we would have an apparent shortage
approximating $1,150. The Guild is,
however, allowed a monthly appropri
ation of $500 from the membership
dues fund. Thus $1,500 is to be bal
anced against $1,150, and it is evident
that during the last three months
something like $300 has been cleared.

forty-eight, twenty-four st: lents and
twenty-four outsiders; during Novem
ber to date ten, seven students and
three outsiders. These cases have in
their variety and nature of service
taxed the facilities of the hospital to
the utmost. It has been exceedingly
difficult to obtain special nurses ow r
ing to the large number of cases r.
quiring nursing about the bay during
this fall. Miss T. M. Caine has been
appointed to the staff until January
xst, 1907.
In order to provide better accom
modations for the executive nurse and
to enlarge the guild office alterations
are being made in the rooms of the
first division of the hospital. These
will be completed within a few days.
Representatives of the University of
California recently investigated the
Stanford Guild Hospital in.relation to
their plans for the university hospital
they expect to open to the students
in January. As is the case of the
Guild, they have had to remodel an
old house 011 the campus.

The total expenditures for the
month of October were $1,249.37.
The hospital charges to patients for
August were $636.32, for September
they amounted to $809.66, and for Oc
tober $840, making a total of $2,285.98.
The total expenditures for the three
months amounted to $4,337.21. Ap
proximately $900 of this was expended
during August for buildings, payments
to the Building and Loan Association,
and insurance. Thus the usual run
ning expenses would amount to about
$3,437.21. Deducting the $2,285.98 de
rived from the fees charged patients
we would have an apparent shortage
approximating $1,150. The Guild is,
however, allowed a monthly appropri
ation of $500 from the membership
dues fund. Thus $1,500 is to be bal
anced against $1,150, and it is evident
that during the last three months
something like $300 has been cleared.
The Guild Hospital has admitted
112 patients since the first of August,
1906. Of this number eighteen were
admitted during August, there being
nine students and nine outside cases.
During September thirty-six were ad
mitted, twenty-four students and
twelve outsiders; during October
forty-eight, twenty-four st: lents and
twenty-four outsiders; during Novem
