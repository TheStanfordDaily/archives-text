# DR. POTTER OCCUPIES PULPIT.
## Strong Appeal Made for Evangelical and Missionary Work. 
### 
Dwight L. Potter, of the First Pres
byterian Church of Oakland, spoke in
the chapel Sunday morning to a large
and thoroughly interested audience,
lie made a strong appeal for the do
ing of evangelical and missionary
work, llis text was, "Go ye into all
the world and preach the gospel to
every creature."
. He said in part: "This text has most
often been treated by preachers as a
missionary text alone. It is quite as
much an evangelical command. The
missionary spirit is but an extension
of the evangelical spirit. Charles R.
Brown has said: 'One who is not de
sirous of giving the gospel to a man
on .the other side of the globe will
not be very anxious to give the gos
pel to a nti-n on the other side of the
street.' 'Go ye into all the world,'
Jesus said, 'to all creatures. Extens
ively, it means to all nations; inten
sively, to every man. It is the duty
of every Christian to give the gospel
to every creature, and if it is properly
presented it will be accepted. It is
possible to preach so that multitudes
will be turned to Christ. But before
we can give the gospel, we must know
what the gospel is, we must have had
experience.
"I know of no greater happiness
than bringing others to the gospel.
If Christ is real to us he expects us to
have something to say of him to our
neighbors. If what for my neighbor
is good, then itÂ» is good for those in
Arizona, in New York, and those in
England. And yet I am surprised to
see the race hatred that throws itself
in the way of the advance of foreign
missions. I believe in exclusion, but
until we have become a little more
sane in our feelings toward foreign
ers, the country at large will have lit
tle sympathy for our actions. A Chi
nese editor told me that three times
he has had his head cut open. I be
lieve that for every Chinaman stoned
in this country there will be an Amer
ican stoned in China.
