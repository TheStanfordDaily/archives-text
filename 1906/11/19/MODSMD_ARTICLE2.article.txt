# LANAGAN'S ITINERARY
## COACH WILL SEE THREE BIG GAMES. Whole Trip Will Occupy About Two Weeks and Will Cover Extensive Territory. 
### 
Coach Lanagan left for the East
Saturday morning on the Overland
Limited. He will go straight to Cam
bridge and will accompany the Har
vard team when it goes to New Haven
next Saturday to meet Yale. Follow
ing this game Lanagan hopes to re
main a short time with Reid, Har
vard's coach. He will then go to
New York where he will confer with
Cochrane and Roper, the head coaches
of the Princeton eleven, which is one
of the strongest in the East this sea
son.
From then on Lanagan's itinerary
is uncertain. If he can make connec
tions successfully, he will take a fly
ing trip to Madison, Wis., to see Chi
cago and Wisconsin play on Thanks
giving day. Leaving directly after
that game Lanagan will go back East
again to see the Army-Navy contest,
which comes the Saturday following
Thanksgiving on Franklin Field, Phil
adelphia.
If Lanagan cannot arrange his Chi
cago trip he will remain in New York
until the Army-Navy contest. He ex
pects to return to Stanford about the
end of the first week in December.
Lanagan's trip this year will prob
ably be a little more expensive than
his Eastern journey last fall. In or
der to sec anything of the reformed
game at this late date, he will have to
travel fast and cover a great deal
more territory than lie did on his last
trip. This added expense should be
more than compensated for by the
knowledge whrch Lanagan will gain
of the old game under the new rules.
