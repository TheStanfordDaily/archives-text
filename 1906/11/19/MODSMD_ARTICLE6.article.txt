# PLUG-UGLY PRODUCED
## PLAY OFTEN INTERRUPTED BY THE SENIORS. Red Fire and Firecrackers Thrown On the Stage.â€”Hard Fight On the Quad. 
### 
The Junior Plug-Ugly, "The Fleec
ers," was produced on the old foot
ball field last Friday evening before
an audience of nearly 1,500 people. It
was difficult to follow the play most
of the time owing to the joshing and
rough-housing of the actors by the
Seniors. The production was fre
quently interrupted by lire crackers
which were thrown on the stage.
Those were thrown back with the re
sult that some of them fell among the
spectators 011 the bleachers, causing
considerable fright.
The members of the class of '06
came over the fence and also a large
number of the Seniors. During the
course of the play there were several
songs and choruses, but it was im
possible to give them correctly with
out the aid of the orchestra, which
was prevented from playing owing to
the fact that the torches would not
work in the high wind. An extended
plot had been published and also an
extra act placed on the program to
mislead the Seniors. At the close of
the second and last act the Juniors
left the field and marched in a body
around Encina gymnasium towards
the quad. They were met there by
about twenty Seniors, the remainder
of the class being at another entrance
to the quad. A rush was then made,
and immediately afterwards the fight
between the Senior and Juniors com
menced. The former had greased
some of the steps leading onto the
quad and also put up ropes to stop
the progress of the Juniors. It was
at these places that the hardest fights
occurred
The Juniors avoided the slippery
steps and got on the quad by the
Business Office. The Seniors soon dis
covered the ruse and the fighting be
came fierce and fast during the time
the Juniors marched around the inner
quad. The fight continued on to the
Post-office where a severe struggle
took place, each class being in pos
session of the steps at different times.
The fighting here was perhaps the
most severe of the evening, but no
one was seriously injured.
