Viewed from the financial stand
point the first Rugby season at Stan
ford was a great success. Economi
cal management of the expenses on
the part of the Graduate Manager off
set the advantages of poorly at
tended preliminary games, and the
crowd that saw Stanford defeat Cali
fornia exceeded all expectations. But
at the S'ate University the situation
is worse than ever,before. Already
burdened with debt, the Blue and
Gold was forced to borrow additional
sums on promissory notes for the
widening of California Held to meet
the Rugby requirements. Next year
the game will be played here at Stan
ford. If Rugby is continued we must
start soon to devise ways and means
for widening our field, a matter which
will mean no small drain upon our
treasury owing to the peculiar con
struction of the Stanford Field bleach
ers. If, however, there exists any
possibility of an abandonment of Rug
by, it is essential that the matter
should he threshed out and settled as
soon as possible. It would be foolish
to even start the expenditure of. any
sums for widening Stanford Field
only to find that widening useless.
It is now impossible to say with
whom the decision as to next year's
game will lie, but it is self-evident
that a long-continued postponement
of the matter will work considerable
injury to the student body treasury.
