# BOOK ON RELIEF WORK
## SOCIAL SERVICE CLUB'S PUBLICATION BEING PREPARED. Collection of Material and Stories by Students In Charge of Prof. A.B. Show. 
### 
Professor A. B. Show, of the His
tory department, is actively engaged
in preparing manuscripts for the book
to be issued next semester by the So
cial Service Club, containing a full
account of the part that Stanford stu
dents took in the relief work at the
time of the earthquake and fire.
Thus far about fifteen manuscripts
have been received by Professor
Show, and the latter is anxious to
get accounts from all the Stanford
students who took part in any way in
the relief work. Personal accounts
are especially desired, and it is hoped
that enough will be secured to cover
the entire field of Stanford relief
work.
The accounts handed in will be pub
lished, so far as possible, as they were
written, Professor Show merely re
viewing them and putting them in
shape for publication. The book will
comprise a number of these stories
of personal experiences and will also
contain an introduction by Professor
Show covering the entire field and
giving a general summary.
Names are being secured, by those
having the book in charge, of all who
took part in the Stanford relief work,
and an endeavor will be made in the
near future to get these students to
write out their experiences and sub
mit them. For those who have not
the time to write out their experiences
a special appropriation has been al
lowed by the Palo Alto Relief Board
to Professor Show for the employ
ment of a stenographer to take down
any dictation covering the subject of
the book. Arrangements can be made
with Professor Show and a time set
for any who care to make use of the
stenographer rather than writing out
their experiences.
An effort is being made to gather
all the material for the book this
semester, and it is expected that all
copy will be in not later than the end
of the Christmas vacation. The book
will probably be published before the
graduation exercises in May.
