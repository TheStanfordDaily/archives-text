The articles in this issue of the
"Daily Palo Alto," explaining the
rules of the American intercollegiate
game as played under the new rules,
should prove instructive to those who
have been following the Rugby game
during the past season. They are not
presented as an argument for the old
game, but merely in order to keep
the student body informed as to the
progress of the intercollegiate sport.
Should there be any possibility of
Stanford's reverting to the American
game, a study of the evolution of its
formations will have been of value.
It is under these rules that the con
tests which Coach Lanagan will wit
ness in the East will be played.
