# TRACK ENTRIES WANTED.
## Blanks Posted at the Training Shed For Saturday Meet. 
### 
Entry blanks were posted at the
training shed 011 the old track this
afternoon, and all men who are going
into the track meet next Saturday are
expected to sign up at once. The en
tries will close Friday noon.
Trainer Moulton and Captain Mac
farland are well pleased with the work
of the men on the track at present. In
the pole vault there are several Fresh
men who are showing remarkably
good form. Among them are W. L.
Crowley, S. M. Bellah, and L. Scott.
There arc also good men in the
weight events among the first year
men, and it is thought that Stanford
will be stronger in the field events
this year than for some time past.
From present indications it is al
most certain that there will be no
Stanford entries in the Thanksgiving
Meet to be held by the Olympic Club
in Golden Gate Park. Most of the
best men are not in good condition
and many of them do not care to train
after next Saturday. W. M. Rawles,
'09, may enter this meet but he has
not decided definitely. The Olympic
Club meet promises to be high-class
and among the entries will be Ralph
Rose, the famous shot-putter from
Healdsburg, who made his reputation
at Michigan. It is also announced
that A. D. Flaw, the great California
weight man, may compete with Rose.
Manager Sales is now negotiating
for the purchase of some cinders for
the new track and as soon as they can
be obtained the new track will be
completed.
