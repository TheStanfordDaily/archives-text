the sixteen 1910 sweaters for the
Freshman Rugby squad, from A. J.
Spaulding & Co., and they are now
being distributed. A large supply of
track shoes has also been received.

opportunity is given for end runs.
If others tackle below the knees, five
yards lost is the penalty.
One forward pass is allowed on a
play, provided the ball does not touch
the ground before touching any
player, and this pass may be made
by any man behind the line when the
ball was putin play. The pass may
be made to no men on the line except
the ends. It must not cross the rush
line until it is five yards to the side
of the spot where it was putin play.
If the ball touches the ground before
touching a player, it goes to the op
ponents on the spot where the pass
was made. Hurdling a player who is
still on his feet is punishable by a
loss of fifteen yards.
The offense is helped by the pro
vision that linemen on the defense
must keep their arms close to the
body in blocking. The scoring power
of the offense is weakened by the rule
calling for a gain of ten yards in three
downs in order to keep the ball. This
rule will diminish the use of mass
plays, but will not abolish them, as,

is also a succcssfitl ground gainer, it
being made in a manner similar to
the old quarter-back kick. A well
trained team rarely misses its recov
ery with a substantial gain. It will
he seen that the only consistent de
fense to these two innovations is the
retaining of men back from the ordi
nary scrimmage defense, and in so
doing, the regular rush line defense
has been so weakened that plays hit
ting wide may be successfully directed
against it. Thus an clement of un
certainty has been introduced, and
greater head work on the part of the
defense has become necessary.
'The introduction of the ten-yard
rule has placed less value on the pos
session of the ball, and frequent kick
ing causes it to change sides many
times.
"The 1906 requirement that the op
posing lines be separated by the
length of the ball, the allowing of
'time out" but three times, and the
more strict legislation regarding hold
ing and other fouling, have all proven
beneficial. Altogether the new rul
ings have resulted in a more spectacu

lar aiul more interesting and open
game."
in the last Harvard-Yale game, Har
vard averaged three yards for each
rush. Any man, except an end, who
is taken out of the line, must stand
five yards back of the line.
Foul play is extended to include
"obstructing a player below his knee
with the foot or leg, striking the run
ner in the face with the heel of the
hand, and striking with locked hands
in breaking through." Wilful misuse
of the fist, knee, hand, or elbow is
penalized by disqualification of the
offender and loss of half the distance
to the goal line of the offending team.
Opposing teams line up on imaginary
lines passing traversely through the
opposite ends of the ball. The space
between the two lines allows the de
tection of foul play. An extra umpire
is provided for, making three officials,
with power of severe penalizing to
accomplish a fair and legal contest.
