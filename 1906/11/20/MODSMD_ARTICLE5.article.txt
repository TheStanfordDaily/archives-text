## BELMONT'S COACH TELLS OF RESULTS UNDER CHANGES IN AMERICAN GAME. 
### 
W. E. Lyons, '07, end 011 last year's
Varsity and coach of Belmont School

statement of the practical working
out of the revisions of the rules of
American intercollegiate football:
"The changes made in American
football as a result of the application
of the new rules of 1906, have been
found to be most beneficial to the
game, which has become more in

dangerous to the player. Mass plays
have been done away with as a result
of the ten-yard rule, which is the most
important change in the old game.
Massive line bucks through inside
holes are no longer able to bring a
first down. Instead, the plays must
be directed much wider than before,
and a general opening up of the of
fense has been the result.
"To meet this requirement of an
effective open offense, the forward
pass and "011-side kick" were intro
duced, and have added great possibil
ities to the open plays already in ex

successful, and the average team is
now using it as frequently as any
other play. The most successful
method of using the forward pass
privilege is the drawing in of the de
fense by what is seemingly a short
end buck, and then executing from the
quarter-back a forward pass over the
heads of the players, to men of his
own side, fifteen or twenty yards
down the field. The "011-side kick"
