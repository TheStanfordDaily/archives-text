# FARRAND ON LEAVE
## HISTORY DEPARTMENT HEAD WILL GO EAST. Visits Washington To Complete Historical Investigations of State Department Documents. 
### 
At a recent meeting of the Board
of Trustees, Professor Max Farrand
of the History department, was
granted leave of absence from the
Thanksgiving recess until the end of
the semester. This action was taken
in order to permit Professor Farrand
to complete certain work in the man
uscripts in the State Department at
Washington. The work in which
Professor Farrand has been engaged
is an edition of the records of the
federal convention which drew up and
ratified the Constitution of the United
States. All of these records are in
the East, and further study is ab
solutely necessary before the work
can be completed. It was in this
work that Professor Farrand was en
gaged last year while in the East, and
it is in prosecution of the same that
he is making the present trip.

28th. He will first go to Portland,
