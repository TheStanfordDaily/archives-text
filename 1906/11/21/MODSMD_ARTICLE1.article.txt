# TO BUILD BLEACHERS
## ACCOMODATIONS FOR 5000 SPECTATORS AROUND TRACK. Faculty Board of Control Approves Plans of Professor Wing.â€”Widening of Stadium Considered. 
### 
The first meeting of the new Board
of Control, which is to replace the
old Training House Corporation, was
held last evening, and proved to be
one of great importance. The plans
for the bleachers to be erected at the
new track we're submitted by Pro
fessor C. B. Wing and unanimously
approved. Contracts for the lumber
will be let at once, in order to get the
work under way in time to complete
the track before the next intercolle
giate meet. Professor Wing will per-,
sonally superintend the construction
work.
The plans for the new bleachers
provide for two sections, one to be
situated on each side of the track op
posite the finish line. Each section
will seat approximately 2,560 persons,
being divided into eight divisions of a
seating capacity of about 320 each.
This will make the total seating cap
acity around the new track a trifle
over 5,000.
The section to be built on the north
side of the track, which will be near
est to the finish, is to be constructed
at an angle. Beginning at a distance
of ten feet from the cinder path, the
seats will run along the path at a
constantly widening angle, until the
end of the section is thirty feet away
from the track, thus giving the spec
tators a better chance to see the whole
race.
The question of widening Stanford
Field by moving back the bleachers
on either side, was discussed, but no
definite action was taken. The board
desires to have the field in condition
to play the next intercollegiate game
there, but this is impossible unless
the bleachers are moved back. Pro
fessor Wing said that $2,500 would be
a very conservative estimate of the
cost of widening the field.
The means of improving the ap
pearance of the field was also brought
up, and the board decided to appoint
a student gardener to work the whole
college year at this task. Vines and
shrubs will be planted around the
bleachers, and the new track will be
encircled by a hedge. Manager Sales
reported that he had discovered a
new hardy grass, known as the Mis
sion Rye Grass, which might serve
as turf for the football field next year.
The board elected no officers at last
night's meeting, Dr. F. Angcll and
C. R. Crider, '07, acting respectively
as temporary chairman and secretary.
The question of electing an outsider
to have charge of the funds of the
Board of Control was, after a short
discussion, laid upon the table.
