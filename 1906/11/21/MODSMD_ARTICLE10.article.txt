# BARS COLLEGE MEN
## A.A.U. SHUTS THEM OFF ATHLETIC CLUB TEAMS. Action Will Work Severe Hardship to University Athletes Who Make Summer Trips With Clubs. 
### 
The American Amateur Athletic Un
ion at its meeting held recently in New
York, passed a resolution which prac
tically bars college athletes from com
peting 011 athletic club teams, tinder
penalty of losing the right to repre
sent their college in intercollegiate
events. The resolution provides that
in the future college athletes in enter
ing competitions must choose between
their college and the athletic club of
which they are members. Such choice
may be made once a year, and must
be abided by.
At first glance this resolution may
appear to be one of the many use
less rulings passed by the A. A. U.,
and its local effect may not be con
sidered. It should be remembered,
however, that the big athletic clubs
depend largely 011 the college athletes
to compose their teams. It is nat
urally easier for such clubs to bear
the expense of long trips for their
teams than it is for a university stu
dent body. For instance, it is prac
tically impossible for cither Stanford
or California to send a track team to
the A. A. U. championships at the
Jamestown Exposition this summer.
The Olympic Club of San Francisco
will undoubtedly send a strong ag
gregation, but the athletes from the
two Coast universities will be barred
from taking the trip as members of
that team. Should they choose to
make the trip with the club, they
would, under the new ruling, be in
eligible to compete in an intercol
legiate contest for a year.
The action of the A. A. U. will also
hurt the rowing clubs and club foot
ball teams who depend upon the uni
versity men to strengthen their ranks
during vacation time. The two Stan
ford oarsmen who rowed on Port
land's championship four this summer,
would be debarred from representing
the Cardinal in the intercollegiate re
gatta, if they should repeat their trip
next summer.
