The communication from Professor
Searles in another column of this
issue of the"Daily Palo Alto" calls
attention to a matter which is wcl
worth tlie serious consideration of the
student body, namely, the control of
the amateur dramatic productions of
the University by a student organiza
tion.
The suggestion that Sword and
Sandals assume control should meet
with approval, for this organization
through its notable successes, has
proven itself eminently qualified to
take charge of this branch of student
activities. College dramatics have a
tendency to drift away from the legit
imate field, and attempts at inappro
priate productions often result in sig
nal failures, as well as in wasted time
and opportunities.
The chief value of a controlling
organization will be to discriminate
between legitimate and useless college
dramatics, and prevent the overcrowd
ing of this field of activity with hast
ily prepared and poorly executed pro
ductions. The coming semester will
probably bring forth the usual large
number of plays and farces, and if the
proposed control is to be established,
immediate action before the close of
the present term would seem advis
able.
