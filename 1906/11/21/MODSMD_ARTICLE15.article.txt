### 
Statistics compiled by a writer in
the "Boston Evening Transcript," for
the attendance at all universities of
the country show that Stanford and
the University of California have lost
but little by the earthquake. Cali
fornia lost eleven per cent while Stan
ford only decreased to the extent of
five per cent. The showing of the
universities in the State is highly
praised by the Eastern writer. "The
California universities," says the au
thor, "in their power of recovery were
worthy of their State and their people.
Leland Stanford, which last year
gained fourteen per cent, this year
lost eight-live students."
In ranking the institutions as to
their attendance, the University of
California is eleventh and Stanford
fifteenth. Harvard leads all institu
tions at present, with Columbia sec
ond. The great universities of the
Middle West fall next. Michigan
leads with Illinois and Minnesota
close up. Pennsylvania has at pres
ent a larger attendance than Cornell
or Yale. Cornell ranks one place
ahead of Yale. The author of the
statistics, in speaking of the leading
university, states that while Harvard
leads in registration it is rapidly giv
ing way to the institutions of the Mid
thc West.
"Chicago has the site, buildings and
general equipment, but as long as the
Rockefeller curse is upon it conscien
tious parents will hesitate to send
their boys there."
