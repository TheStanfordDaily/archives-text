Editor "DailyPalo Alto:"
Some four years ago the writer of
this communication was approached
by a number of students prominent in
literary and dramatic work to see if
some student organization could be
formed which should have control of
the amateur dramatic productions in
the University. The idea was not to
restrict but to develop and promote
interest along these lines, to system
atize and assist the efforts of those
who cared to enter this branch of uni
versity activity, and finally to sec
that all students who had aspirations
should receive at least an opportunity
to realize them. Indirectly this or
ganization was to safeguard the pub
lic against productions of inferior
quality. For clearly the ideal con
dition would be a reasonable number
of amateur productions representing
the best we can do and these inter
spersed with professional perform
ances of as high class as may be to
set us a standard and keep up our
contact with what is being done out
side in these matters.
I would like to submit that, in
Sword and Sandals, we have such an
organization and that no time could
be more favorable for the final steps
toward this obviously desirable end.
Every one will grant, after having
seen the work of the men of Sword
and Sandals in staging the three plays
of this semester, that their aid in these
matters has become almost indispens
able. All that remains then is for a
court of appeal, and then lend it the
necessary authority to prescribe rules
governing tlve seasonable presentation
of manuscripts for original plays, the
system of tryouts, etc., by directing
the Faculty Committee on Public En
tertainments to withhold the privilege
of using Assembly Hall except on the
sanction of this dramatic association
thus organized and authorized.
I make these suggestions quite un
officially and independently. I do not
even know that Sword and Sandals
would be willing to undertake the re
sponsibility, but I am convinced that
we shall never reach a satisfactory
condition of affairs in respect to uni
versity entertainments till some such
system is adopted.
