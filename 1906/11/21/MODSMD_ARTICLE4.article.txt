# Juniors Will Not Retaliate.
## 
### 
A meeting of the Junior class was
held this afternoon to discuss the ad
visability of "rough-housing" the
Senior Circus in retaliation for the
action of the Seniors in breaking up
the Plug-Ugly. It was the sense of
the meeting that nothing should be
done by way of retaliation.
