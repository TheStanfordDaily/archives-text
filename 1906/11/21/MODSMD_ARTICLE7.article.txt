# TO USE LARGER BOATS
## CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON WILL BUY EIGHTS. Proposal That Stanford Have Another Shell to Come Before Executive Committee. 
### 
The Stanford Boat Club is in re
ceipt of numerous communications
from Coach Garnett, of California,
urging the necessity of eight-oared
shells in the next Stanford-California
regatta. Garnett has options on sev
eral excellent boats in the East, and
is anxious that Stanford should decide
to try one of these.
The University of Washington has
decided to have an eight this year, as
have several of the Southern rowing
clubs. It is also definitely settled at
California in this wise, and if Stanford
fails to secure one, it is very doubtful
if the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold
will meet in an intercollegiate regatta
this year.
Coach "Dan" Murphy is much in
favor of eights and has offered, if
Stanford will secure one, to come
West a month early and give his serv
ices for that period free of charge.
The question of buying an eight will
be brought up tonight before the Ex
ecutive Committee.
