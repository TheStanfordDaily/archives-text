# Sword and Sandals Has Deficit.
## 
### 
At a meeting of Sword and Sandals
last night, treasurer F. H. Bernard
'07, made a report on the financial
outcome of the recent "Two Gentle
men of Verona." By this report it
was shown that the dramatic society
has a deficit of about $40 as a result
of the production of the comedy.
Considering the fact that the play
was prepared to within two days of
production last April, with no receipts
then to wipe out the accompanying
cost, the present state of finances is
better than could reasonably be ex
pected.
E. J. Swift, '08, was elected stage
manager, to take the place of J. C.
Ray, '07, who has left the University.
