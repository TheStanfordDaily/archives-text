The football situation at present
bears a rather unsatisfactory aspect
since both the Rugby and American
games have their supporters in the
University, while no amount of dis
cussion is able to accomplish anything
until the football horizon has cleared
up. The old game has definitely dis
appeared in the Eastern colleges and
in those of the Coast. In its place
the former are trying a modified Am
erican game, while Rugby has re
ceived a trial at Stanford and Cali
fornia. The time has not yet arrived
for the final decision as to what game,
Stanford shall play next year. Al
though Rugby has made many friend:
in its first few months of trial, and is
acknowledged to be a good game, a
great number of students desire the
return of the American game. Much
will depend upon the opinion of Coac'i
Lanagan when he returns, after hav
ing witnessed the American game un
der the revised rules. Until the tim<
is ripe for the decision of the matter
there is no need of going into th\
arguments for either side.
