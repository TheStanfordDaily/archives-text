# FOR VARSITY EIGHTS
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VOTES $500 FOR SHELL. Expenditure Subject to Discretion of Sales.â€”Circus Pledges Donation For Track. 
### 
At last night's meeting of the Exec
utive Committee, a resolution was
passed to the effect that an appropria
tion of $500 be made for the purchase
of an eight-oared shell, by Manager
Sales, if it is found possible to spend
that much money for this purpose.
The action of the Executive Com
mittee makes it practically certain
that an eight-oared crew will be the
representative of Stanford in rowing
next year. Manager Sales suggested
that if the Associated Students could
not spend as much as was proposed,
part of that sum would be available
and the members of the student body
or other sources could be called upon
for subsidiary contributions to com
plete the amount necessary for the
purchase of the shell.
Inasmuch as the Universities of Cal
ifornia and Washington have decided
to row in eight-oared boats next sea
son, and as Coach "Dan" Murphy is
highly in favor of the proposition of
a varsity eight, the prospects for Stan
ford's accepting the idea are favor
able. The question seems to be a
financial one only. Manager Sales
stated this afternoon that within a few
days he would be in a position to
state the condition of the treasury of
the Associated Students and the prob
able receipts and expenditures of the
near future, which must be estimated
in order that the expediency of mak
ing the proposed outlay may be de
tcrmined.
President Laumeister and Manager
Sales will balance the books of the
latter and see whether the condition
of the treasury will allow the expend
iture of the appropriation.
The Executive Committee granted
the class of 1907 the privilege of us
ing Stanford Field tomorrow evening
for the Senior Circus, the class pledg
ing twenty per cent of the profit from
the circus toward the construction of
the new track.
