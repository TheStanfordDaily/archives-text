# TO PURCHASE EIGHT
## STANFORD WILL HAVE FIRSTCLASS SHELL. Manager Sales Decides to Give $500 For New Boat. â€” Murphy Discusses Prospects. 
### 
The long agitation for an eight
oared shell was brought to a success
ful close this afternoon by Graduate
Manager Sales' decision to give to the
boating men $500 for the purchase of
a new boat. Sales, in balancing his
books, found that the student body
has a sufficient surplus to warrant
giving that amount to the Stanford
oarsmen.
The shell ordered will not be one
of the second-hand boats which Cali
fornia has an option 011 in the East,
but a new boat and one of the best
which can be procured. It will be
shipped from New York by water, at
a very reasonable rate, and under a
guarantee of delivery in thirty days.
Coach "Dan" Murphy will return
to Stanford a month early in order
to get the boat in working order and
to lay his plans for the training of
the larger crew. With two first-class
shells, one an eight and the other a
four, and two barges, a pair-oar and
a four, the Cardinal oarsmen will be
very fairly provided for during the
coming season.
To offset this advantage, however,
will be the difficulty of giving the
squad early practice in the eight.
In a recent letter to Captain Zim
merman. Murphy says he knows
Stanford has excellent rowing mate
rial, and that he expects no difficulty
in finding eight good men to pull
sculls in the next intercollegiate re
gatta. While last year's four took
nearly nil of the heavy men on the
squad, there were a number of excel
lent oarsmen left, lighter than could
be used to best advantage in the
smaller boat, but who will be just the
necessary material to fill out the bow
and stroke scats in an eight. The
oars for the new boat will be pur
chased by means of the subscriptions
given by the business men of Palo
Alto.
