The open and fair-minded attitude
of the Committee on Student Affairs,
of which one manifestation was made
at the conference with the fraternit
men last night, is in strong contrast
to the methods of the preceding com
mittee. By the attitude of secrecy
and apparent lack of a definite policy,
the former committee had aroused a
certain distrust among the student.
The new committee, however, cndcav
ors to get at the root of any possible
trouble by a hearty and co-operative
understanding with the student body.
In this manner definite results may
be accomplished in a way which will
not tend to arouse bitterness or an
tagonism.
