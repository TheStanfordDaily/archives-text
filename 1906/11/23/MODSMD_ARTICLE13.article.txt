# No Interclass Debate This Semester.
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that the pressure
of college work renders it impossible
for several" members of the Freshman
and Sophomore debating teams to
devote the necessary time to debate
this semester, the interclass contest
will be postponed until early next
semester.
The Intersociety Debating League
took this action this morning after
the presentation of a petition from
the members of the two teams re
questing a postponement on the
ground of inadequacy of time and
pressure of work. W. F. Ilerron,
'08, president of the League, stated
this morning that while it was unde
sirable to postpone the interclass con
test, which is the only debating event
in the first semester, yet the near
ness of the final examinations and the
request of the two teams rendered it
necessary to do so in order to insure
the success of the debate. The con
test will be held shortly after the
opening of the next semester and the
two teams should meet immediately
to choose question and sides.
