Editor "Daily Palo Alto:"
The meeting of Phi Beta Kappa
next Monday evening is an open
meeting, to which the public is cor
dially invited. This fact was stated in
your last issue, but it will bear re
peating, in view of the not unnatural
assumption that meetings of the so
ciety are primarily for its own mem
bers. The public meetings of the so
ciety are noteworthy occasions else
where, and the open meeting already
held at Stanford inaugurated most
auspiciously the interesting series we
hope to have here.
Mr. W. E. Hocking, who is to de
liver the address, is a recent addition
to our university community on the
Coast, and he comes to us after an
interesting training in philosophy, at
Harvard, where he has been associ
ated with Professor James, and
abroad at the German universities
where he studied 011 the James Vol
ker travelling fellowship. More re
cently he has been teaching the his
tory of religions at Andover.
Mr. Charles K. Field, who is to
deliver the poem, is known to all of
us, and it will be a special pleasure
to greet him 011 such an occasion.
It is not, then, for those alone who
are specially interested in the society
that the meeting Monday evening in
the chapel is held, but for the whole
body of Stanford people and friends
of Stanford.
Pill BETA KAPPA.
