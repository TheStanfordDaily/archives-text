# MEETS WITH STUDENTS
## DURAND CALLS CONFERENCE OF FRATERNITY MEN. Student Affairs Committee Outlines Policy and Disapproves of Certain Phases of Stanford Life. 
### 
At the meeting of the fraternity
representatives held last night at the
residence of Prof. W. F. Durand, at
which the members of the Student
Affairs Committee were present, sev
eral topics of vital interest not only
to the fraternities, but to the student
body in general, were informally dis
cussed. Professor Durand prefaced
the discussion with a brief talk, in
which lie outlined the liberal policy
"is a student affairs committee, not a
its wish to meet the students half way
and open-mindedly in everything.
"This Committee," he said in part,
"is a Student Affairs Committee, not a
student discipline committee. We
shall meet the students candidly, and
discipline shall be resorted to only
when every other device has failed.
Discipline is a secondary considera
tion."
Foremost among the matters talked
of was the tendency of students to
sing unnecessary songs and to make
unnecessary noise upon breaking up
their various meetings late at night.
It was stated that several complaints
had been made against the character
of the songs sung openly, and Pro
lessor Durand made it clear that such
carelessness should be carefully
guarded against, suggesting that the
upperclassmen in the houses exercise
control of such matters.
"Stanford is a community made up
of student individuals," continued the
head of the Student Affairs Commit
tee., "where each individual has his
rights as in any outside community.
By any late noise we arc infringing
upon the rights of others. \\ e should
be more careful as citizens of this
community."
The formulation of a plan leading
to the discouragement of these songs
being sung was discussed, and the
concensus of opinion was that each
fraternity should take the matter up
itself. It was determined that it was
easily within the power of the frater
nity as a unit, or at least within the
power of the upper classmen of the
organization to frown upon over
indulgence and the subsequent noise
to such an extent that anything of the
sort would be speedily and completely
eliminated.
After the general questions of
drinking and of intoxicants in the
fraternity houses were touched upon,
suggestion was made of the possible
organization of a Stanford Club, to be
patterned after the Princeton and
Harvard- Clubs of the East. These
clubs own houses, and are run upon a
student co-operative basis. The men
of the university are free to congre
gate in these rooms, where beer and
other drinks are served. Such a sys
tem results in almost total disappear
ance of any uncalled-for noise or
boisterousness.
Nothing at all definite was done
last evening along this line, but the
feasibility of such an establishment
at Stanford was pointed out.
Among other matters spoken of was
the imperative necessity of a placc
where Alumni might be properly
cared for here during commencement
week. The inadequacy of present
conditions was made very evident, to
gether with the drawbacks to the
University existing under this state of
affairs. The fact that there are now
no proper accommodations in all
probability keeps many Alumni from
revisiting Stanford.
Lastly in the discussion attention
was called to the twelve o'clock rule
for social functions on tlie campus.
Some six years ago Mrs. Stanford re
quested that all dancing he suspended
at midnight. Of late this custom has
come into disuse more and more
rather through carelessness than vol
untary violation of the founder's

wishes.
The whole of the proceedings last
night were markedly frank and in
formal, and candid discussion was
freely indulged in between tlie faculty
members and the undergraduates.
Light refreshments were served at
the close of the conference.
