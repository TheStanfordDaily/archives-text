# GOOD MEET PROMISED
## TRACK MEN TO COMPETE TOMORROW MORNING. Large Number of Entries and Freshmen are Expected to Show Up Well. 
### 
The regular fall track meet will be
held at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
on the old track. Although the men
are not in the finest possible condi
tion there is sure to be good compe
tition in most of the races. The
sprints will be especially well con
tested as many of the men who usu
ally go in longer races will be seen
in the hundred and two-twenty to- 1
morrow morning. All the track men 1
are expected to enter some event, and
the entry list is sure to be large.
This meet will be particularly inter
esting because it is the first chance
that the Freshman track athletes have
bad to appear in competition. Manyi
of the Freshmen have shown up well j
in training and there are apt to bej
some surprises tomorrow when these:
new men show what they arc able
to do. This is especially true in the
pole vault where there are sure to be
at least three good Freshmen to com
pete with F. R. Lanagan, '08 and R
A. Kocher, '08. There will be Fresh
men entered in all the events and the
work of the first year men will be
watched with interest. Nearly all the
old men will appear tomorrow and a
good meet is assured. J. O. Miller,
'08, will probably enter some shorter
event than the mile as lie has not
done much training. Captain Mac
farland will run the hurdles and will
probably have Lanagan and Peaslee
among his competitors.- Ti W. M.
Rawles, 'o<j, and 0. D. Hussey, '09,
compete in the quarteri* j's sure to be
a good race, but it is riot- certain that
Hussey will run. At ahy'ratc there
are sure to he some good men in the
quarter. E. J. Nash. '67, is by far
the best distance mad who has been
training this fall and lie will no doubt
run tomorrow.

the training shed but it has mysteri
ously disappeared so it is impossible
to print the names of all the men who
will take part in tomorrow's meet
