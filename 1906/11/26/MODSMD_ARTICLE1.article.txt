# CIRCUS IS A SUCCESS
## LARGE ATTENDANCE NETS GOOD SUM TO SENIORS. Class of 1907 Has About $700 For Commencement as Result of Innovation Friday. 
### 
Over 1,400 people attended the Sen
ior Circus at Stanford Field, Friday
evening. The affair netted the class
treasury about $700. The gate re
ceipts were about $1,100, of which
about $200 was necessary to pay the
expenses of the show, and 20 per cent
of the remainder was turned over to
the new track fund.
The public street parade began at
4:30, and was enthusiastically received
both on the campus and in Palo Alto,
where it disbanded. Every feature of
the parade was well gotten up, the
K A Hope, entered by the Kappa Al
pha fraternity, and the negro on the
water wagon being among the most
cleverly carried out.
Stanford Field was filled with a
noisy, fun-seeking crowd by the time
the evening performance was opened,
at 7:30, with the animal parade around
the field. This feature brought out
many clever and original creations,
the prize for the best animal going
to the ostrich or Hoohoopajaguilla,
exhibited by the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity. The Berkeley pelican, en
tered by the Acacia Club, was also a
very clever exhibit.
After the animal parade the Gym
nasium Club gave an open-air per
formance of mat work and pyramid
building in very good form. The
crowd then scattered to take in the
various side shows and chance games.
Among the former the Minstrel
Show and "Dad" Moulton's Trained
Dog Show deserve especial mention.
These were not "fakes" but high class
shows, each worth much more than
the price of admission. The min
strels performed in true "end man"
style while "Dad's" pets went through
tricks equal to those of the high class
circus performers. The clowns also
gave a creditable performance.
Among the .""fake" shows Shee-Mutt
was one of the best and most popular.
The performance was original and the
"spieling" was of a high order. The
Pzaha drew a large crowd and was
a clever "sell" 4vhich continued to
draw a good many dimes into the
treasury of the circus management
until late in the evening, when it was
appropriated by some one with a rel
ish for duck dinners, and the circus
management is now trying to console
the owner for the loss of her pet
duck. O'
The German beer garden, under the
management of 11. P. Bittncr, '07, did
a thriving business, the cold weather
making frankfurters and hot coffee
the most papular o/der. The peanut
and candy booths sold out their en
tire stock early ill the evening. J. R.
Holman, '09, and P. R. Johnson, '09,
the African Dodgers, were kept busy
dodging eggs until the grounds were
closed.
Among the chance games the most
popular was the plate game, which
was donated to the management by
Joe Larkin, who also gave many of
