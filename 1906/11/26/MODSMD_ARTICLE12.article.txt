# Bonheim Results Delayed.
## 
### 
The announcement of the results of
the Bonnheim contest, which the fac
ulty committee on literary contests
expected to make public today, has
been necessarily delayed by the 11011-
receival of reports from all of the
judges. It is expected that the re
ports will be received within a few
days, but beyond that nothing definite
can be stated.
