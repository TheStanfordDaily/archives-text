# ARCH NOW TORN DOWN
## SIX WEEKS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE WORK. Repairs to Stonework Along East Side of Quad Will be Finished Soon. 
### 
The wrecking of Memorial Arch
was completed last week and nothing
now remains save the two bases on
which the arch was built. It took
about six weeks to lower the stones,
and during that time there was one
acicdent, in which J. Bruce, the fore
man, was severely injured.
Practically all the stones in the old
arch can be used in the rebuilding.
The stones, when lowered, were let
tered and numbered and placed in the
stone yard, between the new library
and gymnasium, in such a manner
that the base stones, which will be
the first ones used, are at the front
of the lot.
The two bases, while cracked, will
probably not be wrecked, but instead
the damaged portions will be drawn
together and securely fastened.
The stone work along the east side
of the quad is practically completed,
with the exception of the arch, be
tween the Engineering building and
the Business Office, and this will be
completed in about a week, after
which the entire east side of the quad
will be thrown open, with the possible
exception of the arcade by the En
gineering building.
The work of repairing the arch on
the inner quad between the Law de
partment and the President's Office,
is now under way. This arch was
badly damaged by the earthquake and
a large part of it will have to be re
built.
The work of wrecking the new Li
brary is complete for the present, and
in a short time the majority of the
wreckers will be transferred to the
Gymnasium. According to the pres
ent plans the gymnasium will prob
ably be wrecked to the water table,
or first floor, in the same manner in
which the library was wrecked.
