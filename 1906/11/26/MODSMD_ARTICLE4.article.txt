# GOOD MEET SATURDAY
## FRESHMEN SHOW UP WELL IN FIRST CONTESTS. McNeil, '07, Wins Sprints In Good Form From Strong Field of Entries. 
### 
The annual fall track meet was held
Saturday morning on the old track.
There were not as many of the old
men entered as had been expected,
but the Freshmen showed up well and
altogether Trainer Moulton was well
satisfied with the meet. Few of the
men were in good condition as they
have only been training a short time,
and most of the track events were
shortened. Probably the best wo-k
was done in the pole vault by the
three Freshmen vaulters—S. M. Bel
lah, W. L. Crowley and Lee Scoit.
All three of these men went over jo
feet 6 inches and were vaulting higher
when the pole broke, and the contest
had to be called off. In the half mile
and the mile, H. II. Mandrell, ':o, ran
in his usual form and won bolli events
in good time. H. P. Cheda, '10, who
ran second in the mile, promises to
become a facto*- in this event next
spring. The sprints were both fast,
and W. T. McNeil, '07, did will in
winning them loth against such men
hs L,. M. Edwaids, '07, F. Fomeroy,
'10, and W. A!. Rawles, '09.
E. J. Helslcy, a Freshma.i from
Modesto, proved to be a goou low
hurdler and also finished third in the
high hurdles. He was the only new
man in these events. In the broad
jump three Freshmen did better 1 ban
20 feet. The event was won by Scott,
at 20 feet, 10 inches, with Bellali sec
ond and Upson third. E. J. Nash. 07,
won the mile and a quarter events
without any trouble, and showed that
he is going to be as strong a distance
runner next spring as he was last
year.
The times made on the track and
the work of the men in the field
events clearly showed that the Fresh
men are strong on track and that
there is plenty of high-class material
this year for the varsity track team.
Now that the meet is over the men
will not work daily but most of them
will run two or three times a week
up to the week when the examinations
begin.
