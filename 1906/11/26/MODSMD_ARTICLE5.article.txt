S. M. Salisbury, '07 and S. S. Smith,
'07, managers of the 1907 "Quad,"
have definitely announced that the
publication will be ready for distribu
tion 011 or before December 15th.
The 1907 "Quad" is not a record
book containing only statistics of the
college year, but is a publication con
taining the finest series of athletic
pictures that has ever been produced
in a Junior "Quad." A series of pic
tures of the Intcrcollegiate and pre
liminary games of the last season of
American football at Stanford, is one
of the features of the book.
The artists of the campus have con
tributed freely to the book, and this
department is well up to the standard
of past publications.
A complete dramatic record will
appear and will handle the subject of
college dramatics at Stanford in a full
and interesting manner.
The book will also contain a list of
all the organizations, including fra
ternities, and Roble and Encina Clubs.
The pictures of the class will be in
two groups, one of the men, and one
of the women, but individual and fra
ternity pictures will not appear.
The cover will be red, with a cover
design of a Plug in three colors. The
numerals, 1907, will be stamped in red
above the Plug. The book will con
tain 285 pages.
The prize story by W. G. Beymcr,
ex-'o7, and the prize poem by VV. F.
Herron, '08, will be published.
The price of the book will be $2.50,
but the members of the class, by pay
ing their assessment of $2.00 011 the
quad, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays,
from 9:15 to 10:15, will receive a book
free.
The management is having consid
erable difficulty in collecting the $2.00
assessment from the 204 candidates
for graduation, but 72 having paid the
assessment.
