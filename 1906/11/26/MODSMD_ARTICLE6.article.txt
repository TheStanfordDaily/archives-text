# To Inspect Hockey at Stanford.
## 
### 
Acting upon a communication from
Miss E. Palmer, '10, captain of the
Hockey team, Miss G. Kimball, presi
dent of the Mills Athletic Associa
tion, Miss Ege, Mills' Basket-ball
Coach, and Miss Griffith, Mills' gym
nasium instructor, are to visit Stan
ford either tomorrow or a few days
after the Thanksgiving vacation.
They wish to consider the require
ments of the game, in ground space
and equipment, and the success with
which it is being met at Stanford. If
the game meets with the approval of
this committee there is every promise
of its being instituted among the
sports of Mills College. In that case
there will be intercollegiate games
between the Stanford and Mills teams.
