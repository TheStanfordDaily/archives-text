# OPEN MEETING HELD
## PHI BETA KAPPA HAS ANNUAL EXERCISES. Dr. W.E. Hocking Delivers Address and Chas. K. Field, '95, Delivers Poem On "Prayer." 
### 
The annual open meeting and ini
tiation of Phi Beta Kappa was held
last night. J)r. W. E. Mocking, of
the University of California, delivered
the annual address and the poem of
the occasion was delivered by Charles
K. Field, '95.
Dr. Mocking chose for his subject,
"The Necessary and Sufficient Condi
tions for Human Happiness." He
spoke in part as follows:
"Among the several ways in which
men pretend to a distinguished place
among the animals, none appears
more remarkable than this persistent
and persistently defeated attempt to
frame to himself an image or concep
tion of his general happiness, as dis
tinct from his partial satisfactions,
and to guide his feet by means of that
conception. . . .
"The advance of scholarship from
time to time, can be measured in the
large by the degree to which the
race has grown self-conscious, dis
covering what, in the bottom of our
well, we actually demand of existence,
estimating our agreement and dis
agreement with the scheme of na
ture.''
The speaker then proceeded to say
that there is no pursuit of happiness,
but only its maintenance, as happi
ness in the abstract is but the conse
quence of our subjective way of view
ing it.
111 conclusion, Dr. Hocking said,
"To the eye of the scholar belongs
the greatest range of wholeness that
is open to men, for the scholar is
none other than he whose great con
cern it is to gain this very breadth of
mental beam from which his fellows
are estopped. If he wins happiness
it is only through bearing the world's
heaviest risk. If he gain happiness
it is because lie has claimed of the
world that prophetic consciousness
which alone can permanently sustain
his labor. For as the religious leader
bears the sins of the world in his own
body, so does the scholar bear in his
own body, the burden of the world's
ignorance and doubt."
Charles I\. Field, '95, then read the
poem which he had written for the
occasion, "Prayer."
The poem was a beautiful one, de
scribing with touching detail the
struggle that the college student
meets at his Alma Mater, when the
winds of freedom assail his "faith
outgrown." Field referred with deep
and reverent feeling to the influence
of the beautiful spirit of Dr. Thoburn.
The initiation of Phi Beta Kappa
was held at the Kappa Alpha Theta
house, directly after the public meet
ing in the chapel. The initiates were,
Helen Louise Sprague, '06, Edith R.
Mirrielees. '06, Helen Thoburn, '07,
William George Batcman, '07, Arthur
Rosenfeld. '07.
