The northern trip of the Varsity
during the holidays will serve, in part,
as a reward for the wonderful work
of the team in developing the Rugby
game in a single season. That the
old, established teams of the North
appreciate Stanford's knowledge and
practice of the English game is ap
parent from the offer which they have
made. The trip will serve not only
to increase the understanding of the
new game, but also as a basis for
actual comparison of the merits of the
best California team with those of the
more practiced Canadian players.
The Vancouver team which visited
the California universities was not, :is
was acknowledged by its members,
a representative one. \et the games
with Stanford were the best of the
Rugby season, and gave the public a
great insight into the new game. The
northern games during the holidays
will give Stanford's players an oppor
tunity to play Rugby in the true style,
and thus form a final opinion as to
its merits or faults. Ihe Northern
ers will doubtless prove to be sports
men in the truest sense of the word,
and the generous contribution of the
Canadians assures a successful trip.
