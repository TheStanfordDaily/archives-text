# GARDNER ON "JUDGMENT."
## Chaplain Explains His Idea of Rewards and Punishments. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner, in his
sermon in the chapel, Sunday, No
vember 25th, took his text from the
Epistle to the Romans: "So then ev
ery one of 11s shall give account of
himself to God.' lie led up to the
idea of the text by proving that the
principle of judgment is a natural, in
evitable and continuous process. It
is the heart of every novel, the theme
of every drama, the crisis in every
tragedy, the final chapter of every bit
of human history. The operation of
the principle of judgment was traced
as found in nature, in conscience and
in society.
He continued in part:
"Nature knows of 110 system of re
wards or punishments, simply causes
and consequences. Most of our aches
and pains and much of the heartache
of life are the consequences of our
own fault. I must deal severely with
the philosophy which says, 'A fellow
knows that if lie sins at twenty he
will suffer at fifty,' but he chooses the
present pleasure and risks the future
pain. Moral judgments are given by
the moral faculty, guided by the
standards of right and wrong. Social
judgments are expressed in social
sentiment, social movements, and in
terms of law."
"Coming to the final judgment the
chaplain said, "Christianity gives a
new standard of values and of judg
ment. The test of our religion is not
the code of Moses. It is the law of
love, as well as the law of virtue.
When Christ comes to judgment we
shall see things as they are. That
presence will lay bare every thought
and motive, every opportunity lost,
every good despised. Then we shall
sec the stream of consequence which
flowed from our example, the sad
harvest of misery and shame which
others gathered from our sowing,
'then will the books be opened."
