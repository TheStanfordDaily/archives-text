# EIGHT ORDERED TODAY
## NEW SHELL WILL ARRIVE ABOUT FEBRUARY 1ST. Boat Won National Regatta Last Year.â€” Coach Murphy Expected In Three Weeks. 
### 
Final arrangements for the pur
chase of an eight-oared shell were
made this afternoon, by Captain F.
Zimmerman, '07. The boat in ques
tion will cost $375, and was built by
Davy, of Massachusetts, for the Lynn
Boating Club of that state. The pur
chasers failed to make the necessary
payments, and the shell was never
delivered. It was loaned last year to
the Riverside Club, which won the
National Regatta with it. Davy, the
builder, constructs all the shells used
by the Syracuse University. Coach
Murphy has examined the boat and
reports that it is a first-class shell,
is in fine condition, has a great deal
of life and is admirably 'suited to a
heavy crew. Captain Zimmerman
considers it very fortunate that an
eight has been found which is so
highly recommended by Murphy.
As soon as the shell can be made
ready it will be boxed and shipped.
If sent before January Ist, it will
come around the Horn; if not, it will
come by way of Panama. In either
case it will arrive soon after Febru
ary Ist.
Murphy is at present trying to se
cure suitable oars for the new shell,
but these will probably have to be
brought from England. They will
cost about $100, which the Boat Club
will pay.
Murphy has consented to begin
work here a month earlier than his
contract calls for, without any extra
salary, and accordingly he will start
West as soon as transportation is sent
him. The amount of his fare has al
ready been subscribed and will be for
warded at once. This will bring him
to the University about the middle
of December, when he will immedi
ately begin preparations for the com
ing season.
President Salisbury, of the Univer
sity of California Boat Club, was on
the campus Sunday to confer with
the Stanford boating men concerning
the purchase of the eight-oared shells
which the California Club has options
on in the East. The Blue and Gold is
to buy two second hand eights fron
Cornell, and in addition will have
built expressly for them a new eight
and four.
The oarsmen of California arc also
planning extensive repairs for their
boat house, which added to their pur
chase of new boats will cost them in
the neighborhood of $3,500. Graduate
Manager Sales informed Salisbury
that Stanford would purchase her new
shell through Trainer Murphy, and
would not consider securing a second
hand boat of Cornell.
