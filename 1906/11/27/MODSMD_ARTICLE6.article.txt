# More Cinders Needed for Track.
## 
### 
Efforts arc still being made by
Manager Sales to procure cinders for
tbe new track. He received a notice
today from the railroad company stat
ing that one car of cinders had been
shipped to Palo Alto. There is also
a wagon load of cinders, and possibly
more, near the depot at Palo Alto,
and these will be hauled up immedi
ately and be used on the runways for
the pole vault and jumps. The avail
able supply of cinders, however, is
not anywhere near enough to finish
the track, and Manager Sales is en
deavoring to locate some cinders that
may be obtained at once.
