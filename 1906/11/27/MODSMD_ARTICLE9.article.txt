# Freshmen to Continue League.
## 
### 
At a meeting last night of the
Freshman Debating League it was
decided to continue the League
through next semester. The Fresh
man league in the past has made a
practice of dissolving after the try
outs for the annual Sophomore-Fresh
man debate, but the majority of the
members were desirous of contin
uing the league so as not to lose
the opportunity of bettering them
selves in debating, and atso in help
ing the encouragement of debating in
Stanford. 1. B. Cross, of the Econom
ies department, has consented to act
as critic and to do whatever lie can
to encourage debating among the
Freshmen. A motion was also passed
that the secretary be instructed to
send letters of thanks and apprecia
tion to Prof. A. M. Cathcart, of the
Law department, and C. A. Beardsley,
'06, who acted as judges at the I'rcsh
man tryouts.
