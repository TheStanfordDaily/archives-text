O SA Y CAN YOU SEE?
People with perfect eyes sec clearly
and continuously without pain, strain
or discomfort.
Tf your eyes trouble you it is a sure
sign that something is wrong some
where. Inflammation and sore eyes
are often—yes, usually—caused by
eye strain.
Eye waters and cold compresses
may relieve them temporarily, but the
only way to get permanent relief is to
remove the cause. If the cause is eye
strain it can no doubt be removed by
properly-fitted glasses—OUß KIND.
