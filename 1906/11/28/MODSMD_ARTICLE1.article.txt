# FAVOR NORTHERN TRIP
## ALL FOOTBALL MEN WILL GO TO VANCOUVER. Manager Sales Has Received Guarantee of $1500 and Light Training to Begin December 1st. 
### 
Last night the members of the
Rugby football team held a meeting
to find out whether the men wanted
to take the proposed trip to Vancou
ver and Victoria. All the players are
in favor of taking the trip and it
seems certain that if the Cardinal
players go North they will have the
strongest team possible. In fact it
will be the regular Varsity and five
substitutes. Manager Sales received
word yesterday from the Vancouver
management that it would guarantee
Stanford $1,500, and this is satisfac
tory to Sales.
At the meeting last night the foot
ball men decided to go into light
training 011 the first of December.
Certain training rules will be followed
but they will not be as rigid as those
in force during the regular season.
The men will also do light work 011
the football field. Coach J. F. Lana
gan is expected to return from the
East about December 6th, and he will
take charge of the work of prepara
tion for this trip. Both Coach Lana
gan and Trainer Moulton will accom
pany their team on the proposed trip.
The trip will be made on the train
as the men do not care to spend as
much time in traveling as would be
necessary if they went by boat. Man
ager Sales will also make the trip.
It is expected that at least three
games will be played, and possibly
more. The Vancouver team claims
that it will be much stronger when
Stanford meets them on their home
grounds, as one or two of their best
men did not come down here with the
team. Besides Vancouver, games will
probably be played with Victoria and
Nanaimo. All these contests should
draw large crowds during the holi
days, as Rugby is the great sport in
British Columbia. This is the first
post-season trip that has been taken
by a Stanford football team since the
1904 Varsity went to Denver and de
feated the University of Colorado, 33
to 0.
