# Chicago Daily Makes Suggestions.
## 
### 
An editorial is printed in"The Daily
Maroon," the college daily at Chicago,
suggesting a plan for the betterment
of a college paper. In brief the plan
is as follows: "to abolish all bulletin
boards, and give to the daily the ex
clusive task of distributing the in
formation of the student body. Thus
the alumni would be kept in touch
with the happenings of the university
and the editors would be relieved of
numerous letters of comment on the
lack of college notes. This plan has
been carried on with great satisfaction
at Yale and should he encouraged by
all college dailies."
