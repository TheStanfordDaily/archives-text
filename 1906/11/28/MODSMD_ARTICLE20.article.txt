# Punting Cup Not Yet Awarded.
## 
### 
The Quadrangle Club punting cup,
which is offered annually to the foot
ball man who does the best kicking
during the season, will probably not
be awarded this season until after
Coach Lanagan's return from the
East. It is customary for the coach
and captain to select the winner of
the cup. The trophy is held now by
K. L. Fenton, '08, who won it last
season for his clever kicking in the
preliminary games. The fact that
Rugby requires a great deal more
punting by every man on the squad
than did the old game, will make the
choice this season a great deal more
difficult, as several of the varsity fif
teen showed up well in this depart
ment of the game.
