enport, ex-'os, portrays a full page
scene in the Faculty clubhouse.

many new ideas. The jokes arc pur
posely made of a poor quality, and
rely on burlesque of particular pro
fessors for their force. A joke index
explains their meanings. The literary
feature is a page take-off 011 "The
Admirable Crichton." There are sev
eral poems supposedly written by the
Faculty. "A Plea to the Sensible,"
