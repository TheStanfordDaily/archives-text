# WOMEN'S ATHLETICS
## PLANS FOR REST OF SEMESTER OUTLINED. Tennis Tournament Almost Completed.— Basket-ball Tournament Planned. 
### 
The women's tennis tournament
that has been on for several weeks,
in which twenty-three women entered,
has not been finished before the
Thanksgiving recess, as hoped. One
match in the semi-finals, Miss L.
Howell, '08, vs. Miss C. Taverner, '08,
has yet to be played. The winner of
this will enter the finals against Miss
L. Peirce, '07, the other match of the
finals being between Miss E. Owen,
'07, and Miss S. Bundy, '10. There
will be 110 other tennis tournament
until the spring semester, when there
will probably be a handicap tourna
ment with a racket set up for a tro
phy. Later will follow the chief event
of the tennis year,—the championship
tournament. A small silver trophy
cup is put up each year by the Wo
men's Athletic Association. The win
ner has her name and class engraved
. 011 the large championship cup, ex
hibited in the Roble gymnasium.
The three interclass basket-ball
games have been finished, with the
j championship carried off by the class
team of 1910. A practice basket-ball
j game was to have been played last
! Monday afternoon, between a picked
team and the Redwood High School
team. The Redwood team was pre
vented from playing, however. The
class squad plans to play a round
robin tournament before the end of
the semester. There will be six
games, each class having an oppor
tunity of playing with the other, and
the championship will not be held by
• game but by the count of points.
The best practice game of the sea
son was held yesterday in hockey, a
spectator having been introduced to
the teams as one of the members of
the committee of inspection of hock
ey, from Mills College. The commit
tee was expected yesterday but was
unable to come, and sent word that
it would be down shortly after the
Thanksgiving recess. Two temporary
teams are being chosen this afternoon,
offering the opportunity of shifting
positions until two satisfactory fixed
teams can be determined upon. Miss
Mac Brown, '09, and Miss Ethel
Palmer, '10, arc the captains of the
two teams. Hockey is being received
with great enthusiasm, new players
entering at almost every practice
game. Four years ago it was started
and met with 110 success whatever,
but three or four women turning out
I for practicc at that time.
