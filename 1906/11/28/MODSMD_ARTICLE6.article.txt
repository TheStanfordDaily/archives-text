"To such a mind a voice may reach
In class-time or some graver day,
Whose value authority of speech
Shall fill our eager ear and teach
A troubled spirit how to pray;
A voice like one, —this much we
know ;
It sank in silence years ago
When he was put from sight and
sound
Beneath the Arboretum ground,
Where sweeps, as in a long caress,
The pepper branche's tenderness, —
So much we know, howe'er we guess!
Voice unforgotten: once your mess
age came,
Set in a quiet sentence; heard
Doubtless no more than word trail
after word
Along the dry course of the droning
hour,
As in a drowsy shower
Drop follows drop along the win
dow frame;
Yet one heart there was stirred,
As by its name called suddenly at
night, a flame
Leaped up with power
Upon the instant to illume
Its path's impenetrable gloom.
Your words were like the ocean's
utterance.
Whose deep, illimitable swell,
Has waked a haunting assonance
Within the hollow of a shell;
An echo yearning to set free
Tt's understanding of the sea,
And able only to impart
A hint of what is in its heart."
