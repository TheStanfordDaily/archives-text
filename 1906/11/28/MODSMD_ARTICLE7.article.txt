# Question for Debate Chosen.
## 
### 
The members of the Sophomore
debating team have chosen the ques
tion, "Resolved, that annexation is
the best solution of the Cuban situa
tion," as the subject for the inter
class debate in the early part of next
semester. This question has been
submitted to the members of the
Freshman team, but as only two of
the Freshmen arc on the campus, it
is probable that they will take no
action in choosing which side of the
question they wish to uphold, until
after the close of the recess. In the
meantime both teams will be study
ing on the subject in a general way.
This is the same question debated in
the intcrclass debate at California,
and as there is an abundance of ma
terial on the subject, it should result
in an interesting discussion.
