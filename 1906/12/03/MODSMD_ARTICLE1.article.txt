# NO CLUBS ON CAMPUS
## TRUSTEES REFUSE TO BUILD DINING HOUSES. Board Declines to Grant Exclusive Franchise For Establishment of an Automobile Bus Line. 
### 
The Board of Trustees' meeting,
which was held in San Francisco last
Friday, was unofficial in that the meet
ing lacked a quorum. The action
taken is therefore merely tentative,
and will not stand unless approved
by the whole Board at their next
meeting. The most important act of
the Board was their refusal to build
small houses near Encina Hall for
the accommodation of the eating
clubs. Eight clubs made application
for houses, and their petitions were
presented in view of the fact that the
University Inn will be opened next
semester, and unless the clubs can
move up to the campus they will suf
fer a severe loss. The Trustees, how
ever, refused to consider the proposi
tion 'fjecause of the expense involved.
The President's Conference made
an application at this meeting for a
lease of the Inn, but this was laid
upon the table, because that building
has already been turned over to W.
C. Shelton, '08, who will run a dining
hall there next semester. J. A. Mer
rill, of Mountain View, putin a re
quest for the exclusive privilege of
running automobile busses from Palo
Alto to the campus, but the Board
considered it unwise to start such a
system with aii exclusive franchise,
so the request was denied. At Fri
day's meeting Vice-President J. C.
Branner acted as executive head of
the University in the absence of Pres
ident Jordan.
