President Jordan spoke at the after
noon session of the Social Education
Congress, held at Tremont Temple,
Boston, November 30th, on "The
Young Man of the Twentieth Cent
ury." "This century," he said, "is
strenuous, complex and democratic.
There never has heen an age in which
the demand for young men who can
do something, was as great as it is
now. There is room for every yotmg
man who can rise to the opportuni
ties of the time. One-third of the
young men of today are not wanted
because of their habits, but trained,
loyal, cheerful, sober-minded young
men are in demand."
