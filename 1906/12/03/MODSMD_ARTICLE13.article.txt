The tentative decision of the Board
of Trustees not to build eating clubs
on the campus puts an end for the
present to any plans for a quadrangle
of eating houses near Encina. This
decision need not, however, be re
garded as permanently setting aside
any such plan, and seems to have
been made purely because of financial
considerations. It is inevitable that
the proposed change in the location
of the clubs will be brought about at
no distant date. The Inn, while well
adapted for use as an eating place,
will eventually be used for the better
purposes which its nearness to the
quadrangle and central location war
rant as a center of college activities.
For the present its reopening will
solve the eating problem, but we hope
that tne proposal to move the Terrace
clubs nearer Encina and devote the
Inn to other purposes will be put
through as soon as the financial con
dition of the University will allow.
