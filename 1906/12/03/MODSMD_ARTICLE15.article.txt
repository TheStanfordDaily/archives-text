# SOPHOMORE PLAY TO BE CHOSEN
## Committee Will Decide Tonight.â€” Edwards Willing to Coach. 
### 
Two modern comedies have been
selected by the Sophomore play com
mittee as alternatives to be decided
between finally this evening. Either
A. Pinero's "Trelawney of the Wells"
or "You Never Can Tell," by George
Bernard Shaw, will be pronounced by
the committee as the play fittest to
be produced by the Sophomore class
next February.
P. C. Edwards, '07, who success
fully directed the production of "The
Original Miss Tewksberry," the Se
nior farce of the class of 1906, and
Sword and Sandals' presentation of
"Two Gentlemen of Verona," has sig
nified bis willingness to coach the
Sophomore play provided that he is
accepted by the class. The commit
tee fixed 011 Edwards as the best
coach available, from the two stand
points to be considered. His services
will cost the class less than those of a
professional and his experience in col
lege dramatics gives him a superior
knowledge of what is needed in plays
at Stanford. Edwards has been an
ticipating leaving the University but
if his services arc desired he will
forego a Christmas trip to Honolulu
and will see the 1909 class play
through to production.
