# TEMPERANCE DEBATERS LOSE.
## Victory of California College Due to Good Delivery. 
### 
California College, of Oakland, won
the debate with the Temperance
Study League last Saturday evening.
The delivery of the visitors was es
pecially good, while the arguments
were about even. The question was:
Resolved, that the San Francisco sa
loons should have been closed from
April 18th, 1906, until April 18th, 1907.
The Temperance League team,
composed of R. C. Menker, '07, W. O.
Stuntz, '07, and G. C. McPheeters, '10,
upheld the negative. The judges
were Prof. R. M. Aldcn, of the Eng
lish department, Professor Lindsley,
of California College, and C. W.
Janes, secretary, of the Young Men's
Christian Association, in San Jose.
The debate was held in the University
chapel and was well attended.
The prohibition debate at Berkeley,
between teams from the University of
California and the University of the
Pacific, was defaulted by the latter.
This leaves California College and
the University of California to fight
for the championship.
