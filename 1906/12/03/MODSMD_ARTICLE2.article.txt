# WILL NOMINATE EDITOR.
## Regular Student Body Gathering Tomorrow Afternoon in Chapel. 
### 
There will be a meeting of the stu
dent body tomorrow afternoon at 1130
in the chapel, for the purpose of nom
inating the editor-in-chief of the
"Daily Palo Alto" for the next sem
ester. The meeting is the regular
gathering of students to name suc
cessors for all vacancies in student
body offices. The position of editor
in-chief of the"Daily Palo Alto" is
the only open office, all other posi
tions running for the two semesters.
According to precedent, the present
managing editor of the"Daily Palo
Alto," Harold Fitch, '07, of San Fran
cisco, appears as the logical candidate
for the office and will probably be the
only candidate chosen. Fitch has
been connected with the"Daily Palo
Alto" since his Freshman year. Pres
ident C. F. Laumeister, '07, of the
student body, will preside at the gath
ering tomorrow.
