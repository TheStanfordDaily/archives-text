# NOVEMBER "ALUMNUS" OUT.
## Literary Features Deal With Football Situation. 
### 
The November issue of the "Alum
nus," which appeared today, is de
voted principally to the present Rug
by situation. The leading articles arc
a review of the varsity game, "Stan
ford Wins on California Field," by
Will M. Walker, '08, and"The Test
of Rugby," contributed by Archie
Rice, '95, in which he reviews the
football situation as it now stands,
acknowledging the merits of Rugby
and pointing out its defects, which
he thinks could be remedied by the
adoption, in California, of an entirely
new football game combining the best
points of Rugby and the American
game with the merits of lacrosse and
hockey. Editorially the issue com
ments on the Rugby situation and ex
presses gratification at the election of
Vanderlyn Stow to membership in the
Board of Trustees.
