###

nual handicap tennis tournament and
the right to liold the Thiele trophy

the Encina courts. Henry's opponent
in the final round was P. B. Delano,
'08, who won the cup last year. These
two players were the scratch men
in the tournament and the match
brought out some interesting play.
Henry was very strong at the net
and always sure of himself in his
overhead work. He used a fore-hand
chop, his best stroke, very effectively,
and placed well into the corners and
side-lines.

well handicapped, both of the scratch
men having narrow escapes in playing
down to the finals. Delano, in the
first round, only won the deciding set
from C. A. Ferguson, '07, by a score
7-5> and in the semi-final round
Henry barely escaped defeat at the
hands of Professor W. D. Briggs.
