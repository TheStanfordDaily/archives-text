# PRACTICE IS RESUMED
## VARSITY STARTED LIGHT WORK THIS AFTERNOON. Team and Substitutes Go Into Training For Christmas Trip to Vancouver. 
### 
Football practice for the Varsity
and substitutes began this afternoon,
in preparation for the Vancouver trip,
and will continue until the final exam
ination week. In the absence of Lan
agan, Captain Stott will take charge
of the practices and Assistant Coach
Bansbach will probably be present at
least part of the time.
Until the head coach returns the
men will only run through light work
and will practice passing, running and
kicking, to keep them in good condi
tion. Just what Lanagan will do af
ter his return it is impossible to say,
but it is highly improbable that the
fifteen will do any scrimmage work
before they leave for the North.
None of the remainder of the squad
have been called out and there will
be no opportunity for the Varsity to
get any practice at line-ups. Train
ing rules will be followed but they,
will be far less rigid than those en
forced during the season.
Lanagan saw the Army-Navy game
in Philadelphia on Saturday. He
planned to leave New York immedi
ately after that game, and unless he
is unavoidably delayed, he should re
turn to the campus by December 6th.
According to present plans Lanagan,
Sales and Trainer Moulton will all
accompany the team 011 its trip to
Vancouver.
