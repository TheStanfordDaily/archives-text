### 
Manager Sales has received re
quests from Portland, Seattle and
Victoria for exhibition Rugby g.imes,
to be played in those cities by the
Varsity with local teams. Owing to
the arrangements already made, which
will probably include three games in
the city of Vancouver, it is not ex
pected that the Varsity will have suf
ficient time during the Christmas trip
to take on all the proposed contests.
The proposed game in Portland
may be the only one that can be
played outside of those for which the
Stanford team has declared itself in
favor of making the trip. The re
quest for a game in that city comes
from the Multnomah Athletic Club,
which can assemble a team 011 short
notice, as some of its members arc
experienced Rugby players. In a
contest with the Vancouver team
which last year played New Zealand
in Berkeley and San Francisco, the
Portland men lost by the score of
28 to o. The Multnomah Club is one
of the most noted amateur athletic
organizations 011 the Pacific Coast.
Its football teams formerly came
south to play with Stanford and Cali
fornia.
If a game with Multnomah is ar
ranged it will probably be played 011

most available date for this match
being Saturday, January sth.

University on the evening of Wed
nesday, December 19th, which is the
last scheduled day for final examina
tions. The trip will be made via
Portland to Vancouver, B. C\, where
it is expected that three games will
be played. Final arrangements with
llie teams to be met by the Varsity
have not been made. Manager Sales
stated that any aggregations chosen
by Manager Woodward of the Van
couver team would be acceptable to
Stanford. Whether the Varsity com
petes with men who play under the
colors of Xanaimo, or all-British
Columbia, the team which visited the
University will lie strongly repre
sented in some of the contests.
These will take place, according to
the tentative schedule, respectively 011
Christmas Day, Thursday, December
27th, and New Year's Day. at Van
couver.
The football squad held its first
practice for the Northern trip yester
day afternoon and will continue reg
ular practice until the team leaves for
the North. The field had not yet
been cleared of all the "property"' of

of Coach Lanagan, Captain Stott put
his men through light but fast and
snappy practice in receiving and re
turning punts and passing the ball.
