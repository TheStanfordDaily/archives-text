## Rev. Gardner Delivers Address On "The Hope of Immortality." 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner spoke in
the chapel Sunday morning, Decem
ber 2d, taking as his subject '"The
Hope of Immortality." The sermon
began with the statement that "in ev
ery healthy human soul there lies the
hope of immortality. It is not
enough to feel that we shall be re
membered. The continuance of per
sonal identity is one thing, our image
in some friendly soul is quite another;
nor is it enough to believe that we
survive in our children. Race im
mortality does not satisfy the soul's
desire. Man longs for some assur
ance. that he himself will live."
The preacher then reviewed science
and philosophy in their bearings on
the subject. With regard to spirit
ualism he said: "There is much in
psychical phenomena which is mys
terious and suggestive, but spiritual
ism has not lifted the veil, and un
happily, it is mixed with fraud and
humbug. We must look to science
humbug. We must look to scientific
psychology for true results in this
direction."
lie then turned to the teachings
of Christ on this subject, incidentally
referring to Christ's resurrection as
the one great proof of the life after
death." Me quoted the words of the
late master of Beliel: "He who med
itates on this divine life will find the
belief in another world coming again
to him when many physical and meta
phorical proofs are beginning to be
as broken reeds. He will find as he
draws nearer to Christ a sort of im
possibility of believing otherwise."
