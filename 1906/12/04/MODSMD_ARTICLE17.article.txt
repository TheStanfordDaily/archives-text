# Disbands Until Next Semester.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Freshman Dc
bating League last evening, it was
decided to discontinue the league the
rest of this semester. This action
was taken on account of the nearness
of the' final examinations which
would interfere with the preparing of
all debates during the next two weeks.
At the first of next semester the
league will again renew its work and
will continue it until the close of col
lege.
