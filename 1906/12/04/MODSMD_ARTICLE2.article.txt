### 
According to the "Illustrated Out
door News" the University of Penn
sylvania has taken up Rugby. The
following clipping contains the com
ment 011 the new football game:
"The University of Pennsylvania is
following the example of Leland
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia by organizing an English Rug
by football team. Pennsylvania
seems to be blessed with a large num
ber of English subjects who arc fa
miliar with the English game and
they have started a very commendable
movement to popularize this sport in
the East. It will take lots of per
sistence to enable this game, from
which our American football sprung,
to win its way here. The Pennsyl
vanians have been obliged to play
all their games against non-college
teams, but they have made a good
start and the game promises to spread
to some other institutions where the
American game does not enjoy the
fullest confidence of the faculty."
