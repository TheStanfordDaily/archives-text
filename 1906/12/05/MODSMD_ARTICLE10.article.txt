floated over the training house on the
clay of the Freshman game were

sion of a Stanford man, it will doubt

s(ins who made away with llft.se gifts
of the Training House Corporation to
the student body, probably regard
their action as a prank of no great

sidered as a serious offense against
the student hotly in which Stanford
men ought not to be implicated.
