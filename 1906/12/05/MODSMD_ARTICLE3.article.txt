# CHOOSE SHAW'S PLAY
## SOPHOMORES SELECT "YOU NEVER CAN TELL." Edwards Will Coach.â€” Class Picture Will Be Taken on Encina Steps Tomorrow. 
### 
George Bernard Shaw's "You Nev
er Can Tell," was accepted by the
Sophomore Class today as the com
edy to be produced next semester.
P. C. Edwards, '07, will coach the
aspirants for the cast and direct the
presentation of the play next Febru
ary. The action taken by the class
was a sanction of the results of the
work of the play committee during
the past six weeks, all the recom
mendations of the committee being
accepted.
Treasurer F. K. Jackson reported
that $92.85 had been collected, and
after disbursements were subtracted,
a cash balance of $86.35 was left in
the treasury. More money will be
forthcoming at the beginning of next
semester, when an assessment will
probably be levied. Such a source of
revenue would insure the payment of
the promised $50 to the track fund,
which will be turned over as soon as
the class has $ioo in the treasury.
A strqnuous effort will be made to
collect the necessary balance in order
that the payment may be made before
the close of the present semester.
P. Q. Edwards, '07, has been en
gaged as coach for the play at a cost
of $100. He will meet the candidates
for the play in room 230, tomorrow
afternoon at 4:30 o'clock. Immedi
ately after today's meeting, members
of the committee received names of
persons wishing to try out for the
play. Sixty-six names have thus far
been received and the list is growing.
At tomorrow's meeting of the candi
dates, Edwards will familiarize those
present with the play and endeavor to
( segregate persons wishing to try out
for serious parts from those who will
try out for comic parts. A short
scene will be given to each person to
learn. Thus an effort will be made
to reduce the number of competitors.
The proposition of having a picture
taken of the men of the class was
brought up and acted favorably upon.
For this purpose all 1909 men who
wish to be in the picture will meet
at Encina Hall tomorrow at 1 o'clock,
to be photographed on the steps.
