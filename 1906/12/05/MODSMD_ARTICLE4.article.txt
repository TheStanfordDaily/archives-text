# LAST ASSEMBLY HELD
## JOINT MEETING OF UNIVERSITY AND SOCIAL SERVICE CLUB. Fairfax Wheelan of San Francisco Compliments Highly Work of Stanford Relief Committee. 
### 
The last Assembly of the semester
was held this morning at the fourth
hour in Assembly Hall. Fairfax
Wheelan, of San Francisco, a well
known business man and a citizen
of the metropolis who has taken an
active part in civic reform, was the
speaker. His address was highly
pleasing to the student audience. He
did not deal with the current graft
prosecution in San Francisco, as was
expected. On the other hand the vis
itor chose to take the opportunity to
compliment the work of the Stanford
Relief corps during the time of the
destruction of the city.
Wheelan was invited to speak here
at the joint request of the Social
Service Club and the sub-committee
of the faculty. As a guest of the
Social Service Club, Wheelan dealt
with the relief subject.
In speaking of the Stanford delega
tion which took active part in the
relief work, Fairfax Wheelan had
nothing but the highest of praise. As
a member of the committee which
was engaged in the caring for the
indigent refugees and under whom
the Stanford men worked, the speaker
declared he believed himself best able
to judge of the merits of the local
workers. In his address Wheelan
also spoke of the part that Mayor E.
E. Schmitz played in the work. In
regard to the indicted city official,
Wheelan said that he must offer at
this point tribute to the Mayor for
his efficiency and efforts, however un
popular the subject might be at the
present time.
Wheelan read the names of the
men who had helped in the relief
work and expressed his regret that
the list was incomplete. After the
gathering five names were added as a
result of the call for the missing
names. Mr. Wheelan furthermore
offered an invitation to all Stanford
men who assisted in the work to re
port to headquarters of the Rehabili
tation Committee, at Gough and
Geary Streets, and take up the work
during the Christmas vacation, on a
salary.
