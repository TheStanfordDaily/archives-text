# LANAGAN DUE TONIGHT
## COACH ARRIVES IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS AFTERNOON. Probably No Foundation for Report That He Will Go to Harvard In 1908. 
### 
Coach James F. Lanagan will re
turn from the East this evening on
the Overland Limited, which is due
in San Francisco at 7:28. If the train
is on time Lanagan will be able to
return to the campus on the 8 o'clock
train from San Francisco, which ar
rives in Palo Alto at 9:15. However,
for the past week or so the overland
trains have been running three or
four hours behind time and it is very
doubtful whether Lanagan will be
able to reach the campus before to
morrow morning.
The football men have as yet set
no definite date for their annual ban
quet at which next year's captain will
be elected. It was decided to do
nothing until after Lanagan's return
from the Hast, and the date will not
be announced until he has been con
sulted. In all probability the elec
tion will be held on Friday evening.
Saturday night the Encina dance will
be held, and the fact that final exam
inations begin next week makes it
imperative that the election take place
this week.
As far as can be ascertained there
is no foundation for the report that
Lanagan has been offered a position
as head coach at Harvard after his
contract here expires. A long story
was printed in one of the San Fran
cisco papers this morning to the ef
fect that Reid would spend another
year at Harvard and then upon his
recommendation Lanagan would suc
ceed him.
According to the terms of Reid's
contract he was to remain one, two
or three years at his option. It is
announced at Belmont that Reid will
leave Harvard in January, 1907, and
will resume his position at his
father's school. As Lanagan is still
under contract to remain at Stanford
for another year, it would he imposs
} ible for him to succeed Reid, and it
is highly improbable that he would
;go East under those circumstances.
