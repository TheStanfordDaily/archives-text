In deciding to present Bernard
Shaw's "You Never Can Tell," the
Sophomore Class has taken a long
stride toward a more complete de
velopment of dramatics at Stanford.
At the same time no small responsi
bility has been assumed, for Shaw is
a dramatist whose works call for a
careful rendering and study. "You
Never Can Tell" is distinctly modern
and has a subtlety of which a clever
interpretation will mean the setting of
a dramatic precedent at Stanford hith
erto unattempted, or, if the play be
misconstrued, the enacting of a miser
able farce. But the fact that 1909 has
undertaken the task shows that it has
faith in the histrionic ability of its
actors, and in the experience of its
coach. The outcome of the play will
be an interesting one, upon the suc
cess of which depends the future of
this new phase of the University's
dramatics.
