The Executive Committee dealt
last night with financial matters only.
The Associated Students were safe
guarded against the expenditure of
more than $1,500 for the northern
trip, the Boat Club was loaned sev
enty dollars to pay for the transporta
tion of Coach Murphy from Lynn,
Massachusetts, to the University, and
bills of Manager Sales jhe amount
of $2,005.08 were approved.
Manager Sales is in receipt of $1,500
from Manager Woodward, of the
Vancouver team, to be used for the
expenses of the Stanford Varsity on
their trip to' British Columbia. The
action which was taken last night
regarding this sum insures the Asso
ciated Students against any spending
of their funds outside of the money
received from Woodward.
Coach Murphy's engagement be
gins January Ist, 1907, and he is ex
pected to arrive before that date in
order to start preliminary training of
the Stanford oarsmen.. The sum of
seventy dollars is advanced to supple
ment the funds of the Boat Club and
will be returned as soon as the treas
ury of the organization is in condi
tion from its regular receipts to re
fund the loan.
