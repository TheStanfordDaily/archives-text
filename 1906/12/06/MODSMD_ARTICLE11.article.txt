# New Lights In Library.
## 
### 
Electricians have been busy dur
ing the past few days putting in a
number of extra lights in the Library
reference and reading rooms. When
the new rooms were opened up this
semester and the reference rooms
changed about, the lighting facilities
were found to be inadequate, and it
is this defect which is now being rem
edied.
