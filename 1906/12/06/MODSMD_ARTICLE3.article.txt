# LANAGAN TALKS ON NEW GAME.
## Coach Returns From Eastern Trip. — Open Play Increased By New Rules. 
### 
"The new rules have brought a de
cidedly different game into the East.
They have opened up the game, made
it more spectacular and practically
done away with mass play. The new
game thus produced is a far more spec
tacular and exciting contest than the
old." This in brief is Coach Lana
gan's opinion of the changes in the
American game, as lie saw them ex
emplified on the Eastern gridiron.
Lanagan arrived on the campus this
morning after an absence of a little
less than three weeks. During that
time he saw the Yale-Harvard, Penn
sylvania-Cornell, and Army-Navy
games. He also had talks with all
the prominent Eastern experts, in
cluding Reid, Camp, Cochrane and
the Pennsylvania and Cornell coaches.
Mr. Lanagan says that the Eastern
coaches arc still completely at sea
over tile new rules. No specific fault
is found, but each of the coaches is
urging some change which will aid
the development of his own particu
lar team. This uncertainty will prob
ably mean that there will be no im
portant changes in the 1907 rules.
Speaking of the new game in re
lation to the objections which caused
the v.i'„n of Rugby on the
Coast last year, Lanagan said, "The
new game is more open and the
grinding mass plays have been abol
ished. There was absolutely none of
the brutality and unnecessary rough
ness which marred the Eastern games
I witnessed last year. 1 do not be
lieve that the new rules are so much
responsible for this improvement as
the greatly increased efficiency of the
officials, who do not hesitate to rule
men off the field for the slightest in
fringement of the rules. The ele
ment of danger remains unchanged
and there is as much chance of injury
as there was in the old game. The
element of commercialism naturally
still remains and always will remain
as long its intercollegiate sport is
maintained on its present basis."
\\ hen asked how the new game
compared with Rugby, Lanagan said
that he believed Rugby was a slightly
safer game. The new game has all

the elements of uncertainty which
Rugby possesses. For the rest Lan
agan was entirely non-committal as
regards the present agitation for a
return to the American game.
The Army-Navy game was the best
game which Lanagan saw. He says
that the Navy team played the fastest
and best game under the rules of any
in the East and had it been heavy
enough to meet either Yale or Har
vard, would have demonstrated its
right to the championship of the East.
Yale was the only team which could
make straight football go and that
was chiefly due to the fact that she
had an exceptionally heavy team. All
the other elevens made their gains by
trick plays or the use of the forward
pass and onside kick. Line-bucking
could only be employed when the
team was in a position to score.
Lanagan regards the ten-yard rule
as the most important and effective
change. He said, "It is harder to
make ten yards at the new game than
it was to make five at the old. Con
sequently a team must take more
chances and risk possession of the
ball more often. The forward pass
and 011-side kick have helped to in
crease the uncertainty of the game.
Against the former 110 team has as
yet devised an effective defense, but
next season will probably see more
means of stopping up this play pro
duced. The separating of the op
posing line-men and the opening up
of the game has made the line a com
paratively unimportant factor even on
the defense, most of the work falling
on the backs."
Lanagan was greatly pleased with
the way the team had taken up the
Vancouver trip. This had not been
definitely decided on when the coach
left. Lanagan will take charge of the
practice at once, and will probably
continue it along the lines upon which
it was started.
Lanagan says that the rumor that
he has received an offer from Harvard
is absolutely without foundation, lie
knew nothing of the matter until he
saw the story which was published
in yesterday's "Chronicle."
"The new rules have brought a de
cidedly different game into the East.

make ten yards at the new game than
it was to make five at the old. Con
sequently a team must take more
chances and risk possession of the
ball more often. The forward pass
and 011-side kick have helped to in
crease the uncertainty of the game.
Against the former 110 team has as
yet devised an effective defense, but
next season will probably see more
means of stopping up this play pro

posing line-men and the opening up
of the game has made the line a com
paratively unimportant factor even on
the defense, most of the work falling
on the backs."
Lanagan was greatly pleased with
the way the team had taken up the
Vancouver trip. This had not been
definitely decided on when the coach
left. Lanagan will take charge of the
practice at once, and will probably
continue it along the lines upon which
it was started.
Lanagan says that the rumor that
he has received an offer from Harvard
is absolutely without foundation, lie
knew nothing of the matter until he
saw the story which was published
in yesterday's "Chronicle."
"The new rules have brought a de
cidedly different game into the East.
They have opened up the game, made
it more spectacular and practically
done away with mass play. The new
game thus produced is a far more spec
tacular and exciting contest than the
old." This in brief is Coach Lana
gan's opinion of the changes in the
American game, as lie saw them ex
emplified on the Eastern gridiron.
Lanagan arrived on the campus this
morning after an absence of a little
less than three weeks. During that
time he saw the Yale-Harvard, Penn
sylvania-Cornell, and Army-Navy
games. He also had talks with all
the prominent Eastern experts, in
cluding Reid, Camp, Cochrane and
the Pennsylvania and Cornell coaches.
Mr. Lanagan says that the Eastern
coaches arc still completely at sea
over tile new rules. No specific fault
is found, but each of the coaches is
urging some change which will aid
the development of his own particu
lar team. This uncertainty will prob
ably mean that there will be no im
portant changes in the 1907 rules.
Speaking of the new game in re
lation to the objections which caused
the v.i'„n of Rugby on the
Coast last year, Lanagan said, "The
new game is more open and the
grinding mass plays have been abol
ished. There was absolutely none of
the brutality and unnecessary rough
ness which marred the Eastern games
I witnessed last year. 1 do not be
lieve that the new rules are so much
responsible for this improvement as
the greatly increased efficiency of the
officials, who do not hesitate to rule
men off the field for the slightest in
fringement of the rules. The ele
ment of danger remains unchanged
and there is as much chance of injury
as there was in the old game. The
element of commercialism naturally
still remains and always will remain
as long its intercollegiate sport is
maintained on its present basis."
\\ hen asked how the new game
compared with Rugby, Lanagan said
that he believed Rugby was a slightly
safer game. The new game has all

the elements of uncertainty which
Rugby possesses. For the rest Lan
agan was entirely non-committal as
regards the present agitation for a
return to the American game.
The Army-Navy game was the best
game which Lanagan saw. He says
that the Navy team played the fastest
and best game under the rules of any
in the East and had it been heavy
enough to meet either Yale or Har
vard, would have demonstrated its
right to the championship of the East.
Yale was the only team which could
make straight football go and that
was chiefly due to the fact that she
had an exceptionally heavy team. All
the other elevens made their gains by
trick plays or the use of the forward
pass and onside kick. Line-bucking
could only be employed when the
team was in a position to score.
Lanagan regards the ten-yard rule
as the most important and effective
change. He said, "It is harder to
make ten yards at the new game than
it was to make five at the old. Con
sequently a team must take more
chances and risk possession of the
ball more often. The forward pass
and 011-side kick have helped to in
crease the uncertainty of the game.
Against the former 110 team has as
yet devised an effective defense, but
next season will probably see more
means of stopping up this play pro
duced. The separating of the op
posing line-men and the opening up
of the game has made the line a com
paratively unimportant factor even on
the defense, most of the work falling
on the backs."
