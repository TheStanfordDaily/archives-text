# GORDON FRIDAY NIGHT
## NOTED TENOR WILL SING IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Program Shows a Wide Range In His Repertoire. — Concert Begins at 8:30. 
### 
The concert by Mackenzie Gordon,
the noted Scotch tenor, which has
been arranged by the Faculty Com
mittee on" Public Entertainments, will
be given tomorrow evening in Assem
bly Hall.
This will be Gordon's only appear
ance in this neighborhood, and a rare
evening of vocal and instrumental
music is in store for music lovers.
Gordon has never appeared in concert
without evoking the greatest enthusi
asm from his audience, and his assist
ing artists, Nathan Landsberger, vio
lin, and I'red Maurer, piano, are fore
most in the ranks of San Francisco's
best talent. Tickets are on sale at
the Bookstore and at the Stanford
Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
Professor Searles, chairman of the
Committee on Public Entertainments,
speaks as follows concerning the
coming concert;
"Much interest is being manifested
in the concert of Gordon, who has
been heard by many of the students
and faculty. All who have heard him
are unanimous in their praise of his
work. There seems, however, a tend
ency to wait until the door sale be
fore procuring the tickets. This is
unfortunate as the limited accommo
dations for selling tickets makes it
difficult to handle a large door sale
expeditiously.
"The concert will begin promptly at
8:30 and will be over very soon after
10 o'clock. Even though the exami
nations are so very close every one
can afford to take this time; in fact
110 one can afford to miss the oppor
tunity to hear so rare a musical treat
as will be offered next Friday night."
