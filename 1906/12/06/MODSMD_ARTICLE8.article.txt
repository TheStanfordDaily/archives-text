Coach Lanagan's return docs not, j
is was expected in some quarters, j
naterially aid in the solution of the
uestion as to what game of football

ame, however, it is evident that he
insiders the style of football now
,'ing played in the East a vast im

msed the general agitation against
e sport last year. Beyond express
g his views on the improvement of
ic American game through the appli
ition of the new rules, the coach will

)on the coach the responsibility of
'ciding upon the game for the whole
niversity are not justified in their
titude. The solution of the problem
■obably lies in a decision from the
udent body, approved by the Fac
ty Athletic Committee, and sub
itted to the football conference
