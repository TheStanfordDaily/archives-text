# MURPHY LEAVES SOON
## STANFORD'S COACH STARTS WEST NEXT WEEK. Boat Club Will Give a Play Next Semester to Relieve Financial Situation. 
### 
The money for Coach "Dan ' Mur
phy's expenses across the continent
will be wired him tomorrow, and he
will leave the East probably Decem
ber 10th, reaching Stanford about the
15th. Instructions have been sent
him to the effect that the new shell
must be placed on board the boat
leaving New York the 10th of this
month if possible. The placing of
the shell on this steamer is imperative
because it has been discovered that,
instead of the thirty days first esti
mated as the time required for get
ting the shipment here, over two
months must elapse before it can ar
rive.
Murphy will ship the new boat with
the American-Hawaiian Steamship
Company, and if successful in getting
it off on the 10th, it will reach here
about the 20th of February. If it
misses this shipment the boat can not
arrive until the latter part of March.
The new California boats will leave
on the 10th and come by the water
route.
The $500 appropriated by the Exec
utive Committee will be sent to cover
the cost of shell, boxing, and ship
ment, immediately upon the receipt
from Murphy of the telegram an
nouncing that the shell is 011 its way.
Murphy has signified his intention of
giving h : s services for that portion
of December which he is here free
of charge, and will start at once to
get the boats now available, the four
and pair-oar barges, and the four
oared shell, into condition for the pre
liminary work.
The expense of bringing Murphy
West, coupled with the pledge of a
certain monthly sum to him, and
with the notes held against the club
by the Bank of Palo Alto, places the
Boat Club in a rather hard financial
situation. To assist in meeting this,
a committee of ways and means, con
sisting of F. Zimmerman, '07. A. N.
Cole, '08, and S. C. Bias, '09, has de
cided to give some kind of a play next
semester under the auspices of the
Boat Club. Mrs. J. C. Powers, who
is well known at Stanford for her
training of the cast of "The Rivals,"
the 1907 Sophomore comedy, and who
has recently been studying dramatics
in the East, has consented to give her
services toward the development of
the play. The committee is consider
ing the advisability of making the
play a minstrel show, but the kind
of production is not as yet definitely
settled.
