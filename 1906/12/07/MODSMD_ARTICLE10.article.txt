# CHAMPIONS MAY PLAY
## POSSIBLE VARSITY GAME WITH SOUTH AFRICANS. If Famous Rugby Player Visit Coast a Match With Stanford Is Probable. 
### 
All interested in the game of Rug
by football will have one of the best
opportunities to witness the sport as
played by the champions of the world
in the near future if the negotiations
of manager Woodward of the Van
couver players and the expectations
of Dr. Frank Angell are realized.
The South Africans who have recently
won the title of supremacy in Great
Britain intend to return to Africa by
way of San Francisco. This fact has
given rise to the question as to
whether the champions could be in
duced to arrange a match with Stan
ford. Dr. Angell believes such a
game will be possible.
The African players arc far be
yond the class of any of the Ameri
can teams which have attempted to
play Rugby, but it is expected that
the poor form in which the star play
ers will lind themselves after an ocean
voyage and a transcontinental trip
will give teams here some hope of
success.
Dr. Angell, in discussing the pros
pect of the game this afternoon, said,
"It will be a fine opportunity for ev
erybody to see what the Rugby game
is like when played by experts. The
Africans are perhaps the best play
ers in the world at present, although
they have been defeated once by the
Scotch team. They have had the best
of it in all of their other matches.
"The South Africans, or "Spring
boks," as the African Rugby football
team is known, defeated the full
strength of Wales Saturday, by a
score of n to o. The victory is re
garded as placing the Springboks
ahead of all Rugby football teams.
The game was played at Swansea,
Wales.
"In addition to this victory, they
have bested the English team.
"The Africans arc a very heavy
team. Their scrum is not particularly
good but the work of their backs is
superb. They are big fast men.
Strange to say the fifteen is composed
of South Africans who fought o.i
both sides in the last war. Some are
Boers and some Britishers."
It is also probable that in addition
to this match, next year the All-Bri f
ish team will stop here on its way to
the islands. If the Africans conic
this year they should arrive some
time in February.
Practice is being held regularly
now every night in preparation lor
the Northern trip. A week from to
morrow a second team captained by
W. G. Macdonald, '07, will play .1
practice game with the Varsity, at
4:30.
