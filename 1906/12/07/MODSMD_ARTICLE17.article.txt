### 
On account of the closeness of the
examinations women's athletics are
almost at a standstill. It has been
decided to play 110 basketball games,
as proposed in the plan for a round
robin tournament. The Freshman
team has stopped practice until the
beginning of the second semester.
Nothing has been done in tennis, the
the final and championship rounds
are yet to be played off.
The last practice game in hockey
was held yesterday afternoon. The
committee from Mills to inspect the
game of hockey has again put ofif its
visit until January.
