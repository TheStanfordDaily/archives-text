# Lack of Cinders Stops Work on Track.
## 
### 
Work on the new track is tem
porarily at a standstill because of the
lack of cinders. Manager Sales has
attempted several times to secure
cinders but without success. Former
Graduate Manager Barrett is at
present visiting Oakland and Sac
ramento in an attempt to secure this
important material.
