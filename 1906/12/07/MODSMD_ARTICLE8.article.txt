# LABORATORY UNSAFE
## PROF. L.R. LENOX DISMISSES MAJORITY OF HIS CLASS. H.T. Dennis, '09, In Guild Hospital As a Result of Hydrogen Sulphide Poisoning. 
### 
Owing to the danger from poison
ous fumes it has been found necessary
to practically suspend work in the
qualitative analysis laboratory, in th"
Chemistry building. A week ago VI.
T. Dennis, '09, was taken seriously ill
with what appeared to be a case of
poisoning, and was taken to the Guild
Hospital. Upon investigation, it w.is
found that his condition was the re
sult of inhaling hydrogen sulphide
gas, which has the effect of inducing
symptoms much like those attending
cases of acute malaria. Prof. L. ri.
Lenox, of the Chemistry department,
made an examination of the quali
tative analysis laboratory and found
that a great amount of poisonous
fumes was being liberated on account
of the lack of a special generating
room. The old room is now in the
hands of the masons as a result of
damage done by the earthquake. It
was deemed advisable to discontinue
the work of the majority of the class
during the remainder of the semester.
Accordingly, yesterday all of those
whose records were of passing grade
thus far were notified that work for
the remaining days of the semester
would in their cases be waived. Out
of a class of forty-seven all but fif
teen have been excused. It is thought
that with such a small number at
work the conditions will not be dan
gerous.
