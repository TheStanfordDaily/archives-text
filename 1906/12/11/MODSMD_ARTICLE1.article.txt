# WIND IS DESTRUCTIVE
## TREES AND BUILDINGS SUFFER BY RECORD GALE YESTERDAY. Weather Prevents Holding of Classes and Renders Structures Temporarily Unsafe. 
### 
A severe storm accompanied by
a high wind commenced at 2 o'clock
yesterday and did considerable
damage to University property.
The unusually high wind lias been
responsible for the damage, the
storm attaining a velocity of about
sixty miles an hour at times.
The trees in the Arboretum
have suffered severely, many being
uprooted and blown to the ground
while nearly all have lost oranches.
The pine trees seem to have suffered
the worst, their thick branches
catching the full force of the wind.
The eucalyptus fared much better
and h*ve not suffered any great
damage.
The roof of Memorial Church
wa√ü damaged and the ledge sur
rounding the tower was completely
demolished. Part of the roof of
the tower was lifted and dropped
into the inner quadrangle, allowing
the rain to get into the church, but
no damage has been done to the
interior.
Skylights in the Engineering and
Science buildings and the Library
were shattered, and during the
high wind yesterday morning the
Library was closed on account of
the danger of falling glass. It was
opened again later in the day.
One of the most peculiar effects
of the storm was noticed at the new
library. The tower, standing alone,
caught the full force of the wind
and during the height of the storm
it moved with a rotary motion
nearly fourteen inches. There was
little or no swaying, the principal
motion being a circular one, as
though the tower was swung on a
pivot.
The tiling at the Postoffice began
coming off at an early hour, and
made it dangerous for passersbv.
The tile was torn off and whirled
to the sidewalk in front and on one
side by the the telegraph office.
The front door of the Postoffice was
closed and those wishing mail made
use of the side door. A tree was
also uprooted in front of the build
ing and the flag-pole showed signs
of collapsing several times.
One side and the entire end of
the upper story of the Woodwork
ing building was blown down.
The upper story was boarded in
after the earthquake but the wind
wrenched the lumber off and
strewed it along the road and on
the railroad track. A large amount
of tin was blown off the roof of the
Boiler House, which was recently
repaired.
Several of the walls of the new
gymnasium would probably have
dropped were it not for the bracing
putin to allow the steel work to be
taken down. As it was some of the
smaller walls blew over, but the
wallH had to come down anyway
so in this case the wind saved con
siderable work.
The dormitories stood the storm

well, a few broken windows being
about the extent of tlie damage
done there.
Several of the houpes along the
row Buffered to a greater or less
extent. Vines were torn away and
windows broken in many of the
houses. The Kappa Alpha and
Kappa Sigma houses lost part of
their chimneys, one of the galvan
ized tops being carried nearly to
the street. At the Delta Gamma
house the top of a brick chimney
toppled over on a roof.
The electric and telegraph wires
have been down for the last twenty
four hours and there is a likelihood
that the Row will be without|lights
tonight. Many poles are down
along the County Road, and it will
take considerable work to repair
the lines. The electricity comes
from the Redwood plant, but when
this breaks down the University

plant is started. The latter sup
plies Roble, Encina and the quad
but no attempt is made to furnish
the rest of the campus with light.
