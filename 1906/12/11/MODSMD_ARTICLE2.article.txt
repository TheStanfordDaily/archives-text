# PRESIDENT JORDAN FOR RUGBY.
## Returns From Eastern Trip. â€” Not Favorably Impressed With New Rules. 
### 
Od Saturday morning Dr. Jor
dan arrived on the campus after
an extensive trip to the East, cov
ering a period of three weeks.
On November 15th Dr. Jordan
left the University and went di
rectly to New York City to attend
the meeting of the Carnegie Found
ation for the advancement of teach
ing and pensioning of aged and
retired professors, and he was hon
ored hy being reelected vice-chair
man.
From New York he went to Cam
bridge where the meeting of the
Association of American Universi
ties was held, and here read a pa
per, prepared by Profrsjor Still
man, of the Chemistry department,
entitled, "Should Men Hearing the
Same Title In Any Institution Re
ceive the State Pay?"
Dr. Jordan witnessed the Cor
nell-Swarthmore game at Ithaca,
and in commenting upon the game
said: "The amending of the rules
of American football will grad
ually work into the rudiments of
Rugby. During the game forward
passes were used a number of times
and were very spectacular but the
result was usually the obtaining
of the ball by the opposing team.
As to bucking the line it was a
complete failure. It was often at
tempted but the teams were unable
to gain the required number of
yards. Both Cornell and Swarth
more had the ball on their oppon
ent's one-yard line but were unable
to buck it over."
"After peeing both the American
and the English games played this
year I have no hesitation in saying
that my opinion as to the superior
ity of Rugby over the old game is
unchanged. The old game has
been improved in many ways, but
there must be much more improve
ment before it will become a sport
and not a battle between coaches.
I am as much an adherent of Rug
by as I ever was. I do not wish
to appear arbitrary in the matter,
but it Beems to me that the Eng
lish game should have the two

year's trial to which it is entitled."
lie further stated, "I can merely
make suggestions as the matter lies
wholly in the hands of the Faculty
Athletic Committee, of which Pro
fessor Angell is chairman, and this
committee will in nil probability
require a petition signed by a
majority of the students and the
team before it will give the Ameri
can game any consideration as an
intercollegiate game for the season
of 1907."
Aftt-r visiting both Cornell and
Swarthmore he went to Yale, his
alma mater, where he delivered a
-hort address. He also visited the
Universities of Chicago, Michigan,
Harvard and Princeton. His visit
to these universities was promoted
in order that he might secure rew
teachers for his present staff and
in order to acquaint himself with
the present workings of the larger
institutions.
Dr. Jordan has under considera
tion the establishment of three new
courses, namely, Municipal Gov
ernment, Social Pathology and
Philosophy. He has secured the
services of two very able instruct
ors in the East to conduct the
courses.
Dr. Jordan visited Washington
and thus the Japanese question,
which is the most vital topic at
issue today, was brought to his
notice. That be had any words
with President Roosevelt he did
not say, but he in expressing him
self on the question, said, "The
people of this coast, especially in
San Francisco, made a great mis
take when they referred to the Jap
anese as Mongolians in their peti
tion to the executive head of the
nation. The whole question can
be solved by patience and diplom
acy, not by mass-meetings or hard
and wholesale misrepresentations.
The chief point at issue lies in the
fact that no self-respecting nation
can submit to having its people
classed as inferior because of their
nationality."
