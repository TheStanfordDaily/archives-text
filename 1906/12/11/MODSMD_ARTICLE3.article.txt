# 1910 CHOOSES AFFIRMATIVE
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Freshman
debating team held Saturday after
noon, the members decided to up
hold the affirmative of the ques
tion, "Resolved, that annexation
is the best solution of the Cuban
situation."
This question, which will be de
bated in the annual interclaFS de
bate early next semester, was sub
mitted by the Sophomore team
some time ago.
The same question was argued
in the interclass debate at Califor
nia, where the decision was in
favor of the first vear men.
