Some nosee appear to have been
"made for glasses," others don't.
But regardless of the shape of the
j nose the need of glasses comes to
all eyes. When it comes you can't
very well get a new nose hut you
can get glasses to fit the nose you
have.
Right here we come in. We
have glasses for all kinds and
shapes of noses and take special
care to give each the one best suited
to each individual nose.
Right glasses—OUß KlND—fit
nose, and eyes, and ears, hence give
comfort and satisfaction—our guar
antee.
