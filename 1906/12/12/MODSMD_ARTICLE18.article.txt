# Route of Automobile Road Changed.
## 
### 
The line of the automobile road
which is being built through the Ar
boreteum has been changed from the
original line laid out. The road starts
from a point near the Faculty club
house and swings to the left through
the Arboreteum, but instead of com
"i: ut near the main entrance to the
ids the road swings to the right
vill strike the county road some
distance below the main gate,
force of men has been at work
for some time opening up the road
and felling trees with the aid of dyna
mite. There remains considerable
work to be done and the road will
probably not be ready for use until
sometime next semester.
