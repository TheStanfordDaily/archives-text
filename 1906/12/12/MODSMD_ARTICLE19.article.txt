# Will Not Meet In December.

### 
The Women's League probably will
not meet again until next semester.
Nothing more has been done to
ward the furtherance of the women's
club-house proposition. An effort
will be made before the close of the
semester, to obtain the vote of every
woman registered in the University,
in regard to the compulsory fee plan.
