# BOATHOUSE DAMAGED
## SHELL AND BARGES AT REDWOOD ESCAPE INJURY. High Wind Which Moves Building Leaves Boats In Place and Uninjured. 
### 
Word was received yesterday
from Redwood that the boat house
in which the Stanford boats are
housed was greatly damaged. An
examination proved, however, that
although the house itself was
severely handled by the storm, both
ends being blown off and the build
ing moved about five feet, the shell
and barges were not injured in the
slightest degree. The shell and
barges were resting upon two rafter√ü,
and had been carefully tied in posi
tion as a safe-guard against another
earthquake, so escaped falling and
injury in spite of the racking suf
fered by the building.
The float in front of the boat
house was torn and twisted, and
the plank walk connecting it with
the building was deposited some
distance away on the marsh by the
wind. Owing to the fact that it
would have been necessary to re
move the back of the house this
spring in order to enlarge it for the
accommodation of the new eight,
the wreckage caused by the wind ia
not at all serious. The damage
can probably be repaired and the
necessary enlargement made for
about $25.00. The shell has been
removed to a large warehouse in
Redwood where it will remain until
the oarsmen begin work next se
mester.
