# TWENTY-ONE ON TRIP
## SALES AND LANAGAN TO ACCOMPANY RUGBY TEAM. Executive Committee Decides That Student Body Shall Stand Extra Expense Incurred. 
### 
At its meeting last night the ex
ecutive committee decided that the
student body should make good any
deficit which may be incurred on
the northern football trip. Owing
to the smallness of th - expense fund
it was thought that either Coach
Lanagan or Manager Sales would
have to remain at home, but the de
cision of the executive committee
makes it possible for both to take
the trip. It is hoped that any
financial loss thus caused will be
made up by the playing of an extra
game in Portland with the Mult
nomah Athletic Club. But final
arrangements for this contest have
not yet been made.
The schedule of games to be
played in British Columbia bas
not been definitely settled. The
team will play Vancouver at Van
couver on both Christmas Day
and New Year's, and Nanaimo has
asked for a game on December
29th, also to be played in Van
couver. Victoria and Seattle have
also asked for matches, but noth
ing has been done in either of their
cases, or in that of Nanaimo.
Neither G. I). Hussey, '09, nor
C. A. Thorpe, '10, will be able to
go North with the team. G. Wall
ace, '08, will fill Thorpe's position.
'The following men intend to take
the trip: Coach Lanagan, Manager
Sales, E. P. Stott, '07, J. N. Stan
