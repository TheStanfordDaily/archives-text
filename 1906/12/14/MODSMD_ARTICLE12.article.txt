This being the last issue of the
"Daily Palo Alto" for the semester,
the editor takes this opportunity of
expressing his hearty thanks to the
members of the staff for their con
sistent hard work throughout the
term, and to the members of the
student body for their co-operation
and support. The closing week
has proven to be an unfortunate
one for the paper, marked by but
three issues, the first on a hand
press, the second published in Palo
Alto, and this, I he last, in the
"Daily Palo Alto" office, after two
days of trials and difficulties. We
feel that an apology is due for this
state of affairs, but have none to
offer, since circumstances over
which we have no control are re
sponsible for the trouble.
The publication of these closing
issues serves as a reminder of the
old days of hand-set type and mid
night presswork. In this respect,
at least, the"Daily Palo Alto" has
been subject to improvement dur
ing the semester now drawing to a
close. The methods of the old
fashioned printing office have been
abandoned and the paper now en
joys the use of a linotype, and
goes to press sufficiently early to
enable its delivery at a compara
tively early hour.
Whatever merit or efficiency the
paper may have attained during
the semester is attributable to two
causes, â€”the able assistance of the
members of the staff and the con
tinuance of the working system de
veloped by the preceding editors.
It may be well to say a word
concerning the discontinuance of
publication before the official close
of the University. The action has
been taken chiefly because of the
examination week, all activities

having in general been suspended,
and is in accordance with the cus
tom in other universities where a
a period is set aside for final exam
inations.
