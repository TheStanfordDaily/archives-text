# Varsity Shortstop Injured.
## 
### 
E. Sampson, '09, shortstop on
the vaisity baseball team, met
with a serious accident in the
foundry Wednesday, which will
probably deprive him of the use of
his left foot for some time. Samp
son was pouring some molten iron
into a mold when the flask broke
and the hot iron ran into his shoe
Sampson was removed to the Guild
Hospital where his foot was
treated. Although it is bidly
burnt, it is not thought that it will
keep him off the diamond next
semester. Yesterday Sampson
left the hospital on crutches and
returned to the campus.
