# SHELL WILL BE LATE.
## Congestion of Freight Prevents Delivery of Boat Here Until March. 
### 
A telegram has been received
from Coach "Dan" Murphy stat
ing that because of the congested
freights he was unable to get the
shell on the boat leaving New York
on the 10th, and that it will be
impossible to start it until the lat
ter part of January.
Murphy's wire will be followed
by a letter giving full details, but
the bare facts in the telegram mean
that the boat can not arrive here
until March, and this will he a
Revere handicap to the oarsmen.
