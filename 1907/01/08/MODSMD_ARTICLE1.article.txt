# STUDENTS SUSPENDED
## COMMITTEE DROPS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED. New Policy Will Have Serious Effect Upon All Student Activities. 
### 
After receiving reports for last se
mester the Scholarship Committee
suspended or dropped nearly one hun
dred students from the University.
Ten of those dropped were women.
This is the largest number of stu
dents dropped in many years and the
percentage of women suspended is
the highest on record.
No statistics have been compiled as
yet in regard to the number dropped
from the various departments, and
none will be available for several
days.
The effect of the new policy
adopted by the Committee as shown
by its recent action, will be far reach
ing in its results as many men prom
inent in student activities were forced
to leave college.
The Committee met yesterday to
reconsider petitions and special cases
brought to its attention. While it is
not in a position to give out any in
formation as several cases arc still
under consideration, it is generally
known that but few of those sus
pended have been able to get back,
and the Committee is likely to reverse
but few of its former decisions.
The action of the Scholarship Com
mittee in dropping such a large num
ber of students is not indicative of
the fact that poor work was done
last semester but rather that the
standards of work required have been
considerably raised.
