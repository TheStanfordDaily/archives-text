Stanford lias no cause to be
ashamed of the showing made by
vhe Cardinal team on the Vancouver
trip. Two games lost by small
scores, one tie, and one decisive vic
tory make up a splendid record for
a team playing over a thousand miles
from home, and handicapped by lack
of practice and adverse climatic con
ditions. Aside from the actual re
sults of the trip, the team and coach
have gained an added knowledge of
the English game which will stand
them in good stead, if Rugby is con
tinued next semester.
At present the advantage in the
controversy seems to rest with the
supporters of the English game, and
the success of the Canadian trip will
be another strong argument in their
iavor. If the advocates of American
icotball intend to make any stand
for a return to the revised game, they
must act and act at once. Undoubt
edly the matter has not yet been def
inite!}' settled, but the supporters of
Rugby have had all the advantage in
the argument so far. They are now
in a position to stand on the defensive
and await the next move of the op
ponents of the game.
