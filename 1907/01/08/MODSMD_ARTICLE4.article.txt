After one of the longest and most
significant trips ever taken by an ath
letic team on the Pacific Coast, the
Stanford Rugby team returned to the
campus this morning from British
Columbia, enthusiastic over the gener
ous hospitality of their British hosts.
Each of the twenty members of the
squad expresses himself without re
serve in commendation of the enter
tainment afforded them by the Can
adians and the sportsmanlike attitude
of their opponents. From a financial
standpoint too the excursion into
Canadian territory was a success.
The expenses of the trip aggregated
but a few dollars more than the sum
of $1500 allowed Graduate Manager
Sales to finance the venture. The
absence of Coach Lanagan, who has
not yet returned to the campus,
makes any venture as to the effect
of the trip 011 the Rugby situation but
a hazard.
The squad left the campus 011 De
cember 19 and during the trip of
twenty days four games were played.
In these the Cardinal suffered defeat
twice, was victor once and tied once.
According to press dispatches, the
statements of the Canadians them
selves and the word of the Varsity
men, all the matches were high class
Rugby and all excelled in interest and
fierceness of play any contest held on
the California fields earlier in the sea
son. Although the scores show a
preponderance in favor of the All-
Vancouver stars, with whom three
games were played, honors were
about evenly divided in the series.
By a sudden stroke of fortune the
Britishers were enabled to snatch vic
tory from almost certain defeat in the
opening contest. In the second Stan
ford was clearly outplayed, and in the
third, 011 New Year's day, which re
sulted in a tie, honors were even in a
tierce conflict. At Seattle list Satur
day, the Cardinal outclassed their op
ponents from the University of Vic
toria and won with ease by the score
of TT-O.
The entire trip was highly enjoy
able and the University without doubt
acquired increased prestige by the
magnificent showing made by the
team. The members of the squad
cannot speak too highly of the enter
tainment offered them by the Can
adians. At Seattle the Pugct Sound
Stanford Club were hosts at a well
on the delayed train from Portland
many alumni were on hand to do the
honors during the day's sojourn of
the team in that city.
The squad arrived in San Francisco
on the delaped train from Portalnd

tliis morning. Coach Lanagan re
mained in the city 011 private affairs
and not all of the squad came directly
to the campus.
Captain Stott, Captain-elect Koer
uer, Kenton and Macfarland, remained
over in Portland and will return later.
The first game was played at Van
couver on Christmas day, before a
crowd estimated to contain fully _|,000
people. Stanford outplayed the Can
adians up to the last few minutes
when with a rush the northerners
carried the ball over the line, making
the score a tie, at nine points, and the
Canadian captain added the deciding
points by kicking the goal. In this
initial match the Cardinal gained the
respect and admiration of the British
ers by their cleverness and sports
manlike conduct. The collegians
w ere superior in tackling and rushing
the ball by sheer weight, but as ex
pected, in open work and passing,
their more experienced opponents
outclassed them.
As in the first match Vancouver
won the second game in the last few
minutes of play, when on a short
dash Churton passed to Owen of Van
couver for the only try of the game.
Time was called with Stanford in
possession of the ball 011 Vancouver's
twenty-yard line and making steady
progress toward the goal.
The field was a sea of mud during
this match and the chilling rain fell
throughout the entire contest, mak
ing brilliant individual and open work
almost impossible.
The last match with the Canadians
011 New Year's day was replete with
sensational features and although the
score was a tie, three points being
scored 011 each side, it was conceded
that the advantage was all with the
university team and that their work
in passing the ball excelled that seen
in any of the previous matches. Sev
eral inches of snow had to lie swept
from the turf before the game could
be called. The air was bitterly cold
but the footing was firm and gave the
Cardinal backs their first opportunity
to display their best work. At the
close of this last of the international
series the college team was given an
enthusiastic ovation by the crowd of
two thousand people who had gath
ered.
Stanford, scored first on a try by
Captain Stott and Churton of Van
couver turned the trick for his ti am
towards the close of the second half.
Seattle was introduced to Rugby
on January 5 when the University of
Victoria tried conclusions with the
Cardinal squad. The Canadian col
legians were no match for their op
ponents and Stanford carried off the
long end of a 11-0 score. Although
there was but a small crowd in at
tendance the game was well received
in the Sound city.

After one of the longest and most
significant trips ever taken by an ath
letic team on the Pacific Coast, the
Stanford Rugby team returned to the
campus this morning from British
Columbia, enthusiastic over the gener
ous hospitality of their British hosts.
Each of the twenty members of the
squad expresses himself without re
serve in commendation of the enter
tainment afforded them by the Can
adians and the sportsmanlike attitude
of their opponents. From a financial
standpoint too the excursion into
Canadian territory was a success.
The expenses of the trip aggregated
but a few dollars more than the sum
of $1500 allowed Graduate Manager
Sales to finance the venture. The
absence of Coach Lanagan, who has
not yet returned to the campus,
makes any venture as to the effect
of the trip 011 the Rugby situation but
a hazard.
The squad left the campus 011 De
cember 19 and during the trip of
twenty days four games were played.
In these the Cardinal suffered defeat
twice, was victor once and tied once.
According to press dispatches, the
statements of the Canadians them
selves and the word of the Varsity
men, all the matches were high class
Rugby and all excelled in interest and
fierceness of play any contest held on
the California fields earlier in the sea
son. Although the scores show a
preponderance in favor of the All-
Vancouver stars, with whom three
games were played, honors were
about evenly divided in the series.
By a sudden stroke of fortune the
Britishers were enabled to snatch vic
tory from almost certain defeat in the
opening contest. In the second Stan
ford was clearly outplayed, and in the
third, 011 New Year's day, which re
sulted in a tie, honors were even in a
tierce conflict. At Seattle list Satur
day, the Cardinal outclassed their op
ponents from the University of Vic
toria and won with ease by the score
of TT-O.
The entire trip was highly enjoy
able and the University without doubt
acquired increased prestige by the
magnificent showing made by the
team. The members of the squad
cannot speak too highly of the enter
tainment offered them by the Can
adians. At Seattle the Pugct Sound
Stanford Club were hosts at a well
on the delayed train from Portland
many alumni were on hand to do the
honors during the day's sojourn of
the team in that city.
The squad arrived in San Francisco
on the delaped train from Portalnd

tliis morning. Coach Lanagan re
mained in the city 011 private affairs
and not all of the squad came directly
to the campus.
Captain Stott, Captain-elect Koer
uer, Kenton and Macfarland, remained
over in Portland and will return later.
The first game was played at Van
couver on Christmas day, before a
crowd estimated to contain fully _|,000
people. Stanford outplayed the Can
adians up to the last few minutes
when with a rush the northerners
carried the ball over the line, making
the score a tie, at nine points, and the
Canadian captain added the deciding
points by kicking the goal. In this
initial match the Cardinal gained the
respect and admiration of the British
ers by their cleverness and sports
manlike conduct. The collegians
w ere superior in tackling and rushing
the ball by sheer weight, but as ex
pected, in open work and passing,
their more experienced opponents
outclassed them.
As in the first match Vancouver
won the second game in the last few
minutes of play, when on a short
dash Churton passed to Owen of Van
couver for the only try of the game.
Time was called with Stanford in
possession of the ball 011 Vancouver's
twenty-yard line and making steady
progress toward the goal.
The field was a sea of mud during
this match and the chilling rain fell
throughout the entire contest, mak
ing brilliant individual and open work
almost impossible.
The last match with the Canadians
011 New Year's day was replete with
sensational features and although the
score was a tie, three points being
scored 011 each side, it was conceded
that the advantage was all with the
university team and that their work
in passing the ball excelled that seen
in any of the previous matches. Sev
eral inches of snow had to lie swept
from the turf before the game could
be called. The air was bitterly cold
but the footing was firm and gave the
Cardinal backs their first opportunity
to display their best work. At the
close of this last of the international
series the college team was given an
enthusiastic ovation by the crowd of
two thousand people who had gath
ered.
Stanford, scored first on a try by
Captain Stott and Churton of Van
couver turned the trick for his ti am
towards the close of the second half.
Seattle was introduced to Rugby
on January 5 when the University of
Victoria tried conclusions with the
Cardinal squad. The Canadian col
legians were no match for their op
ponents and Stanford carried off the
long end of a 11-0 score. Although
there was but a small crowd in at
tendance the game was well received
in the Sound city.
