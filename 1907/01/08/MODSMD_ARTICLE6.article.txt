# MURPHY ISSUES CALL
## CANDIDATES FOR CREWS WILL REPAIR FLUME. Cardinal Coach Thinks There Is Good Material for Fast Eight Here. 
### 
"All candidates for the Varsity or
Freshman crews will report at the
boat-house tomorrow afternoon."
D. J. Murphy, Coach.
F. Zimmerman, '07, Captain.
"Dan" Murphy arrived on the cam
pus Thursday morning from the East,
where he has completed a very suc
cessful season, having accomplished
great results with boat club crcws.
The Cardinal coach will take hold of
the Stanford oarsmen at once, al
though his first problem will not be
training the men to row.
Owing to a break in the flume line
which brings the water from San
Francisquito creek into Lake Lagun
ita, the University authorities have
refused to till the lake. The repairing
of the one break in the flume would
not in itself be very expensive, but
the whole line is in such poor shape
that a new llume is practically the
only solution of the difficulty.
Such a line would cost about $10,-
000, and this sum the trustees are
unwilling to expend. Murphy and
several of the oarsmen, however, are
determined that their work shall not
be handicapped by the lack of a place
to do the preliminary rowing, so,
for the next two days the candidates
for the crews will be asked to give
their aid in repairing the flume, in
order that the lake may be filled as
usual.
The actual training will begin Fri
day afternoon, when the men will be
divided into squads and put upon the
machines at the boat house. Murphy
expects a large squad. In place of
the usual Varsity and Freshman four,
Stanford will meet California this
spring in a regatta including Varsity
and Freshman eights, and a substitute
Varsity four.
The development of twenty men
into such form that a creditable show
ing in (lie big regatta may be made
is more of a complex problem than
was faced by Murphy last year. The
Cardinal coach thinks, however, that
the material is here, and the eight
which meets the Blue and Gold will
be up to the high standard of last
year's four.
