# TRACK PROSPECT FAIR
## LOSSES BALANCED BY THE RETURN OF STARS. Cope, Crawford and Taylor Register and Will Turn Out This Semester. 
### 
The opening of the 1907 track sea
son finds Stanford with fairly bright J
prospects for a winning Varsity team.
Although the Cardinal will suffer
heavily from the loss of several valu
able men, this loss should be more
than counterbalanced by the return
ing to college of several former stars,
who should greatly strengthen the
scoring power of the team in the in
tercollegiate meet with the Univer
sity of California.
The chances for a victory in the
Freshman meet do not appear so
good. The entering class is seriously
handicapped by the loss of many of
its most promising athletes, among
them S. H. Bellah, who was regarded
as an exceptionally consistent per
former in several events. But al
though few new men turned out for
fall training last semester, and it is
therefore difficult to get a line on
just what material there is left in the
class, it is known that several athletes
with good preparatory school records
are here, and once put under the care
of Trainer Moulton they should give
a good account of themselves in the
annual Freshman event with Cali
fornia.
A survey of the material that will
go to make up the 1907 team indicates
that the team will be well balanced
and strong in nearly every event. The
return of E. C. Cope, '08, insures sev
eral strong runners in the sprints.
Cope should be fast this year, and
with such men as L. M. Edwards, '07,
W. M. Rawles, '09, J. R. Holman, '09,
and T. Vandervoort, '08, will make a
fast field of sprinters. As usual Stan
ford will be strong in the quarter
mile. Rawles, '09, W. T. McNeil, '07,
C. Coonan, '09, W. T. McNeil, '07,
C. F. Elwell, '07, will be difficult men
to beat in this event.
J. O. Miller, '08, is at present in the
hospital undergoing an operation, but
if he has time to get into condition
before the meet, the Cardinal will be
well cared for in the distances.
With this runner in the mile and half
mile, and E. J. Nash, '07, in the mile
and the two-mile, the majority of the
distance points are practically sure
■of coming to Stanford. In addition
to Miller and Nash there are a host
•of good distance men, who gave ev
ery indication of being Varsity mate
rial last year, and who should be both
faster and headier runners this spring.
The Cardinal hurdlers have always
been fast men and this season will be
no exception to the rule. Both the
high and low sticks will be run by
clean-cut hurdlers this year, including
Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07, F. R.
Lanagan, 08, and W. D. Peaslce, '09.
The return of J. C. Taylor, ex-'O4, a
former Varsity hurdler, adds greatly
to the strength of the team.
The weights will be well taken care
of by C. C. Owen, '09, A. Tomasini,
08, A. B. Cox, '07, and W. K. Ford,
'09. D. P. Crawford, '09, Varsity
tackle and hammer thrower, will be

in college this semester and his work
should bring points in the annual
meet. F. R. Lanagan, '08, and R. A.
Kocher, '08, should easily take tirst
and second in the pole-vault. At
present it looks as if Stanford's weak
est points would he the jumps, al
though Vandervoort, '08, in the broad,
and E. C. Sterling, '08, in the high,
are consistent performers, and may be
relied upon to bring home points.
On the whole the outlook must be
classed as bright, and Stanford should
swing the first serpentine across her
new track.

est points would he the jumps, al
though Vandervoort, '08, in the broad,
and E. C. Sterling, '08, in the high,
are consistent performers, and may be
relied upon to bring home points.
On the whole the outlook must be
classed as bright, and Stanford should
swing the first serpentine across her
new track.
The opening of the 1907 track sea
son finds Stanford with fairly bright J
prospects for a winning Varsity team.
Although the Cardinal will suffer
heavily from the loss of several valu
able men, this loss should be more
than counterbalanced by the return
ing to college of several former stars,
who should greatly strengthen the
scoring power of the team in the in
tercollegiate meet with the Univer
sity of California.
The chances for a victory in the
Freshman meet do not appear so
good. The entering class is seriously
handicapped by the loss of many of
its most promising athletes, among
them S. H. Bellah, who was regarded
as an exceptionally consistent per
former in several events. But al
though few new men turned out for
fall training last semester, and it is
therefore difficult to get a line on
just what material there is left in the
class, it is known that several athletes
with good preparatory school records
are here, and once put under the care
of Trainer Moulton they should give
a good account of themselves in the
annual Freshman event with Cali
fornia.
A survey of the material that will
go to make up the 1907 team indicates
that the team will be well balanced
and strong in nearly every event. The
return of E. C. Cope, '08, insures sev
eral strong runners in the sprints.
Cope should be fast this year, and
with such men as L. M. Edwards, '07,
W. M. Rawles, '09, J. R. Holman, '09,
and T. Vandervoort, '08, will make a
fast field of sprinters. As usual Stan
ford will be strong in the quarter
mile. Rawles, '09, W. T. McNeil, '07,
C. Coonan, '09, W. T. McNeil, '07,
C. F. Elwell, '07, will be difficult men
to beat in this event.
J. O. Miller, '08, is at present in the
hospital undergoing an operation, but
if he has time to get into condition
before the meet, the Cardinal will be
well cared for in the distances.
With this runner in the mile and half
mile, and E. J. Nash, '07, in the mile
and the two-mile, the majority of the
distance points are practically sure
■of coming to Stanford. In addition
to Miller and Nash there are a host
•of good distance men, who gave ev
ery indication of being Varsity mate
rial last year, and who should be both
faster and headier runners this spring.
The Cardinal hurdlers have always
been fast men and this season will be
no exception to the rule. Both the
high and low sticks will be run by
clean-cut hurdlers this year, including
Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07, F. R.
Lanagan, 08, and W. D. Peaslce, '09.
The return of J. C. Taylor, ex-'O4, a
former Varsity hurdler, adds greatly
to the strength of the team.
The weights will be well taken care
of by C. C. Owen, '09, A. Tomasini,
08, A. B. Cox, '07, and W. K. Ford,
'09. D. P. Crawford, '09, Varsity
tackle and hammer thrower, will be

in college this semester and his work
should bring points in the annual
meet. F. R. Lanagan, '08, and R. A.
Kocher, '08, should easily take tirst
and second in the pole-vault. At
present it looks as if Stanford's weak
est points would he the jumps, al
though Vandervoort, '08, in the broad,
and E. C. Sterling, '08, in the high,
are consistent performers, and may be
relied upon to bring home points.
On the whole the outlook must be
classed as bright, and Stanford should
swing the first serpentine across her
new track.
