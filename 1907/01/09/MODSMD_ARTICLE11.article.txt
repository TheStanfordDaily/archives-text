The track prospect, which was very
bright last fall, has been dimmed by
the failure of many promising ath
letes to return to college this semes
ter. The greater majority of these
were Freshmen who had shown up
well in the fall try-outs and of whom
much was reasonably expected. This
will naturally have more effect upon
the Cardinal's chances in the Inter
collegiate Freshman meet, but it is
also a severe blow to the Varsity.
The problem which confronts Trainer
Moulton and Captain Macfarland can
only be solved in one way. They
must have material from which to de
velop the team. The loss of so many
good men must be met by the devel
opment of other good men, who can
win points for the Cardinal. Ihe call
for track candidates will probably be
issued within the next few days. It
should meet with a ready response
from every man in the University
who has the spare time and a sound
pair of legs. Unlike baseball or foot
ball, track requires little or no prep
school experience, and more than one
point winner has been developed from
a man who never wore a spiked shoe
before entering the University.
