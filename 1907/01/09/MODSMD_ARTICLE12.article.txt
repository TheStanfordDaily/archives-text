The fact that only six men are at
work on the question announced for j
the Carnot debate does not augur well
for Stanford's chances of winning Ihe
medals this semester. Last year
there were seventeen candidates in
ihe field, and -the trio was pickcd only
after long competition. Preliminary |
tryotits were held, in which various
phases of the question were debated, j
and the experience thus gained stood
the Stanford team in good stead.
Our record in the Carnot is not one
cf which we can be proud and the
debating interests of the University
should be willing to make any effort
to better it. Even those debaters
who feel that they arc unable to make
a team, should have enough spirit to
get out and give the more prominent
candidates the benefit, which they
would undoubtedly derive from a con
sideration of the question in prelim
inary discussions.
