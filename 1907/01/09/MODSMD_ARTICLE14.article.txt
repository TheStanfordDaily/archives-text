# TO FILL EXISTING VACANCIES.
## Executive Committee Will Meet Tonight and Determine Student Body Offices. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the !
Associated Students will hold its firs
regular meeting of the semester to
night. Two of the members of the
old committee which was chosen at
the student body election last se
mester, have not returned to college.
They arc H. Fitch, '07, and J. 11. Bell,
'08. This leaves a vacancy in the rep
resentation of the two upper classes,
which will probably be filled by the
committee in accordance with the
provisions of the student body con
stitution. No action 011 this matter
will be taken at tonight's meeting.
The vacancy in the editorship of the
"Daily Palo Alto," caused by the fail
ure of Fitch to return, will probably
be filled by a general student body
election, the date for which will be
set at tonight's meeting. There is
also a possibility that K. A. Bickel,
'07, the present editor of the "Se
quoia" will not return this semester.
In such an event his place will also
lie filled by a general student body
election.
