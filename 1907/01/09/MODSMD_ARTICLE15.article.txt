# JORDAN BUYS AUTOMOBILE.
## President Purchases "Buick" Machine. Trustees May Open Campus Road. 
### 
During the Christmas recess Dr.
Jordan purchased a "Buick" auto
mobile in order to secure a more
rapid conveyance to and from Palo
Alto.
At the last meeting of the Board
of Trustees nothing was said as to
the opening of the campus to auto
mobiles, but the new road which is
being constructed as rapidly as the
weather will permit will enable ma
chines to reach the campus at a point
near the Faculty club-house. At the
next regular meeting of the Trust
ees it is expected that all roads, other
than the main drive, will be open to
the power-driven cars.
It is possible that an automobile
bus-line will supersede the present
system in the near future. When
consulted as to the probability of an
automobile bus line Dr. Jordan stated:
"Competition will be necessary before
any such scheme will be allowed by
the Trustees. A cheap fare and a
quick running schedule will also re
ceive a careful investigation."
