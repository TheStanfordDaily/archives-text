# THE 						CINDERS ARE HERE
## FIRST SHIPMENT ALREADY PARTLY DISTRIBUTED. Fencing Contract Will Be Let at Once.—Weather Hinders Progress of Work. 
### 
Cinders for the new track, which
have been long expected by Manager
Sales, are now 011 the campus. After
considerable delay, owing to scarcity
of material, Sales procured enough
from the Pacific Mail Co. to cover the
track. Part of the cinders have al
ready arrived and a quantity was dis
tributed over the track. Because of
the unsettled condition of the weather,
workmen experienced considerable
difficulty in spreading cinders advan
tageously. Now that everything is in
readiness work will be rushed to com
pletion as rapidly as possible. As it
progresses arrangements will be made
for fencing the grounds. No steps
will be taken in this direction, how
ever, until after the next meeting of
the executive committee.
The first of many important ques
tions taken up by the committee will
be the letting of a fencing contract.
•No estimate has as yet been made
as to the cost, but Manager Sales
makes a rough estimate of $5,000.
This cost will be born by the student
body.
Whether the new track will be com
pleted in time for the Intercollegiate
meet is uncertain, if not doubtful.
Sales hopes to have the track ready
in time for the meet, but can give no
assurances that such will be the case.
It will depend entirely on the con
tractors. If it is found impossible to
complete the bleachers in time for the
Intercollegiate meet, arrangements
will be made to have the meet held
elsewhere. The condition of the old
track makes it practically impossible
to hold a meet there. The fence sur
lounding the cinder path has been
almost destroyed and the entire east
end of the grounds is open.
Tlie executive committee at its first
meeting will not only consider the
track question, which Sales considers
one of the most important, but some
definite information in regard to the
unsettled condition of Rugby will
probably be given out.
