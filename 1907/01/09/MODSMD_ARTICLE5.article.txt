# Team Exceeds Expense Account.
## 
### 
Manager Sales has completed his
financial report .of the expenses in
curred by the Rugby team in its trip
to British Columbia. The report, al
though not given in detail, shows that
$150 of the expense will have to be
borne by the student body. The ex
pense account allowed by the man
agers of the northern teams was
5i,500. Owing to unexpected hotel
bills the expenses allowed were
slightly increased. Before leaving
the campus the executive committee
guaranteed any expenses the team
might incur over and above the sum
specified by the northern managers.
Sales' detailed report will be sub
mitted to the executive committee
at its next meeting.
