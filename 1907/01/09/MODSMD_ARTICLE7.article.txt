# PLEASED WITH TRIP
## LANAGAN AND ANGELL TALK ON VANCOUVER GAMES. Express No Opinions On Probable Bearing of Trip On Rugby Situation. 
### 
Coach Lanagan and Doctor Angell
were interviewed this afternoon con
cerning the northern trip from which
the Rugby team has just returned.
Both agree that the post-season series
of games was a success in every par
ticular, and that one of the great ad
vantages to he obtained from a con
tinuance of Rugby was the fact that
i' would allow of many such post
season trips.
Coach Lanagan said, in part ; "We
had a line trip and were treated roy
ally by the northerner;:. All the
games were very close and the scores
fully indicate the relative merits of
the two fifteens. The Vancouver
team was much stronger than the ag
gregation which came south a few
months ago, Marshall being the only
one who played both here and in the
north. All the games, including that
with Victoria, were, far better than
anything we have had in California.
The fellows learned a great deal of
Rugby on the trip, and the experi
ence obtained will prove of the ut
most value." When questioned as
to what effect he thought the north
ern journey would have on the pres
ent Rugby situation, Lanagan re
plied: "I don't know anything about
it."
While on a pleasure trip through
Oregon, Washington, and British
Columbia, Dr. Angell witnessed three
ot the four games played by the Stan
ford team. He was especially im
pressed with the high class of Rugby
put up by the opposing fifteens. Pro
fessor Angell has commented on the
extreme impartiality of the audiences,
which expressed no preference except
in the third game, when they seemed
to sympathize heartily with the Card
inal. Like Coach Lanagan, Dr. An
gell had nothing to say regarding the
effect the post-season scries would
have on the football outlook.
When Dr. Jordan's views were
asked on this subject, however, the
President said: "The recent northern
trip has greatly strengthened the
status of Rugby on the coast."
