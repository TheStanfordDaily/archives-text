# Will Grant Degrees Friday
## 
### 
The Academic Council will meet
on Friday, January n, to grant de
grees to those graduating in Decem
ber, 1906.
The number of degrees granted will
in all probability exceed the number
granted at previous ipid-tcrm gradua
tions. This fact is due principally to
the earthquake which left a number
of last year's candidates with incom
pletes to make up.
