# SEASON OPENS SOON
## LANAGAN WILL START BASEBALL ON JANUARY 21. Pitcher and Second Base Only Positions Not Filled By Varsity Men. 
### 
"We hope to hold the first base
ball practice a week from next Mon
day, the 21 st of the month," said
Coach J. F. Lanagan this morning
when questioned as to his plans for
early practice. "The first game will
probably be with Santa Clara on Feb
ruary 2, and thereafter practice will
be continuous as far as weather will
permit. Following our custom of
last year we will attempt to have two
games weekly right up until the Cali
fornia series."
This announcement from the Coach
although not unexpected, is a pleasing
one to the members of the team and
followers of the game. It prophesies
a continuance of the successful policy
of last year of developing the Varsity
by a continuous and thorough system
of practice games. Now that the
Rugby question is laid aside for the
year all interest centers in the base
ball prospects, and this early outline
of the work for the season is a wel
come one to the student body. Man
ager Sales is preparing the spring
schedule and he promises a partial
schedule of games in a few days.
While the hopes of a veteran team
have been shattered by the loss
of J. H. Bell, '08, and J. G. Wood
bury, '09, Varsity and substitute sec
ond base respectively, still there does
not seem to be cause for any partic
ular discouragement. Outside of this
position, there will be one or more
veteran candidates for every post and
011 top of that the 1910 class will with
out doubt, add a goodly number of
strong players to the already known
material.
Captain G. J. Presley, '07, will no
doubt prove a better man than ever
at the first bag while across the dia
mond K. L. Fenton, '08, and C. E
Sampson, '09, have already proved
their worth. About this trio of well
known players it should not be diffi
cult to develop a fast and hard-hitting
infie'd. Even if the Freshman class
does not produce a player to fill the
gap at second it is not at all doubtful
that T. R. Cadwalader, '09, might be
developed into a strong infield man.
In many of the preliminary games
last spring he filled the position of
shortstop several times satisfactorily
Behind the bat E. P. Stott. '07. and
H. P. Daily, *07, will both be avail
able once more and will take ample
ore of this important place. 'or
three seasons pr t both have proved
themselves master of the catcher's
position and the Cardinal has never
been at a loss for a reliable player
at the home plate. With the loss of
Sales, a new twirler must be devel
oped but it is already all but conceded
that the place will fall to W. C.
Theile, '08, whose work in the box
last season was excellent. Further
material is at hand for a staff of
pitchers in G. L. Goodell, '09, and C.
Witmer, '09, the two members of the
.Sophomore class who proved their
ability in the interclass scries and in

the preliminary games last year. It
is understood also that the Freshman
class has some pitchers in its ranks
who will prove no mean competitors
for this important position.
The outfield will remain intact. A
J. Chalmers, '07, in left, C. C. Owen,
'09, in center and E. G. Dudley, '07
in rijjlit, will 110 doubt prove more
capable th.-in before in covering the
gardens and should show increased
strength with the bat. If not taken
into the infield Cadwalader will also
probably stand well up in the com
petition for one of these places. He
won his letter at left field in the sec
ond game of the California series last
spring and proved a worthy substi
tute for Chalmers.

year all interest centers in the base
ball prospects, and this early outline
of the work for the season is a wel
come one to the student body. Man
ager Sales is preparing the spring
schedule and he promises a partial
schedule of games in a few days.
While the hopes of a veteran team
have been shattered by the loss
of J. H. Bell, '08, and J. G. Wood
bury, '09, Varsity and substitute sec
ond base respectively, still there does
not seem to be cause for any partic
ular discouragement. Outside of this
position, there will be one or more
veteran candidates for every post and
011 top of that the 1910 class will with
out doubt, add a goodly number of
strong players to the already known
material.
Captain G. J. Presley, '07, will no
doubt prove a better man than ever
at the first bag while across the dia
mond K. L. Fenton, '08, and C. E
Sampson, '09, have already proved
their worth. About this trio of well
known players it should not be diffi
cult to develop a fast and hard-hitting
infie'd. Even if the Freshman class
does not produce a player to fill the
gap at second it is not at all doubtful
that T. R. Cadwalader, '09, might be
developed into a strong infield man.
In many of the preliminary games
last spring he filled the position of
shortstop several times satisfactorily
Behind the bat E. P. Stott. '07. and
H. P. Daily, *07, will both be avail
able once more and will take ample
ore of this important place. 'or
three seasons pr t both have proved
themselves master of the catcher's
position and the Cardinal has never
been at a loss for a reliable player
at the home plate. With the loss of
Sales, a new twirler must be devel
oped but it is already all but conceded
that the place will fall to W. C.
Theile, '08, whose work in the box
last season was excellent. Further
material is at hand for a staff of
pitchers in G. L. Goodell, '09, and C.
Witmer, '09, the two members of the
.Sophomore class who proved their
ability in the interclass scries and in

the preliminary games last year. It
is understood also that the Freshman
class has some pitchers in its ranks
who will prove no mean competitors
for this important position.
The outfield will remain intact. A
J. Chalmers, '07, in left, C. C. Owen,
'09, in center and E. G. Dudley, '07
in rijjlit, will 110 doubt prove more
capable th.-in before in covering the
gardens and should show increased
strength with the bat. If not taken
into the infield Cadwalader will also
probably stand well up in the com
petition for one of these places. He
won his letter at left field in the sec
ond game of the California series last
spring and proved a worthy substi
tute for Chalmers.
