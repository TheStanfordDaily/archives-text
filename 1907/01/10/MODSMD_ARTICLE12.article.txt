# BOAT CLUB MEETS TONIGHT
## Freshman Candidates Should Sign Up With Murphy Before Saturday Evening. 
### 
About fifteen men have already |
signed up with Coach Dan Murphy j
for rowing. Most of these are new
men and the old men will sign in n|
day or two. It is absolutely impera
tive that the new men report to Mur
phy as soon as possible. He espe
cially desires them to sign before Sat
urday night as the men will be di
vided into squads and started on the
rowing machines Monday. At pres
ent many of the old men are repair
ing the flume but more assistance is
needed at once. The recent rains
have tilled about a fourth of the lake,
and if the flume can be repaired in the.
next few days, Lagunita will be ready
for the oarsmen inside of a week.
An important meeting of the Boat
Club will be held tonight. Murphy
will probably give the oarsmen a talk
about work for the coming season,
and the financial condition of the Club
will also come in for considerable
discussion.
