# ABBOTT WILL RETURN
## PRESIDENT JORDAN DENIES RUMORS TO CONTRARY. Head of Law Department Has Received Many Flattering Offers In East. 
### 
During the last few days many ru
mors have been circulating around
the University to the effect that Pro
fessor Nathan Abbott, head of the
Law department, would not resume
his duties here next August, when his
leave of absence expires. Although
Dr. Abbott has received three very
flattering offers from Eastern univer
sities, he has refused them all, and
unless something unforeseen occurs,
he will be in charge of the Law de
partment at the beginning of the fall
semester.
When President Jordan was asked
this afternoon, if there was any doubt
about the return of Professor Abbott
he replied: "I have no doubt of it."
The President stated that although
Abbott had been urgently requested
to remain in the East, he had only
recently written that he had declined
all offers and would be back accord
ing to schedule. A member of the
faculty of the Law department, who
is a close personal friend of Dr. Abb
ott, said that at present the latter had
firmly decided to return. He would
not deny, however, that Professor
Abbott might possibly change his
mind, as the offers he had received
were many and flattering.
