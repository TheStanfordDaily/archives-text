# Track Work Begins Monday.

"Track work will commence Mon
day on the old track. I will be on
hand from 10 to 12 a. m.and from
2:30 to 6 ;30 p. m. every day."
The above statement was made to
day by Trainer "Dad" Moulton, who
is very anxious that all the candidates
should have signed training rules by
the middle of next week. "We are
facing a serious proposition," says
Stanford's veteran trainer, "and I
want every man who has the time to
help me by coming out for the track
team."
Although the cinders are being rap
idly distributed over the new track
the cinder path will not be in shape
to be used for some time yet, so this
makes necessary the use of the old
field, which is in fair condition.
