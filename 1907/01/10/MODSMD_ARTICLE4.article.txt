chairman of the local committee.

The examinations will be received
from England in scaled envelopes to
be opened by those in charge only at
the time and placc of examination.
Immediately after each test the pa
pers of the candidates will be sealed
up in envelopes, specially provided
and forwarded to England together
with a declaration signed by the in
structors in charge of the examina
tions, specifying that the tests were
conducted regularly and in strict ac
cordance with the instructions from
Oxford.
The method of awarding the schol
arship in this State has been some
what changed. Formerly the scholar
ship was awarded in alternate years
to California and Stanford. At a re
cent meeting of the college presidents
of the State it was decided to extend
the field of award by admitting the
several Southern institutions. Ac
cordingly it was arranged with the
administrators of the Scholarships
to make the award for this State by
means of the competitive examina
tion system, but in accordance with
the previous requirements which call
for a certain grade in the papers of
the candidates.
Those expecting to take the exami
nations may secure copies of those
given here two years ago by applying
to Professor A. T. Murray, room 25,
in the Greek department.
