## COMMITTEE NAMES PRESLEY AND MILLER. Herron Editor Pro Tem of "Sequoia." Student Body Meeting Tomorrow. 
### 
At the first regular meeting this
semester the Executive Committee
last night appointed W. F. Herron.
'08, editor pro tem of the "Sequoia,"
G. J. Presley, '07, representative of
the Executive Committee from the
Senior class, and J. O. Miller, '08, rep
resentative from the Junior class.
J. E. Cushing, '08, was appointed
editor-in-chief pro tem of the"Daily
Palo Alto," at a special meeting Mon
day, and President C. F. Laumeister
has called a meeting of the student
body to convene Friday at 1:15 in
the chapel, to make nominations for
the two editorial offices.
The Executive Committee has named
Monday, January 14, as the day for
the special election to be held for the
editorships of both the student body
publications.
The vacancies in the two posts
which must be filled were caused by
the failure of the editors-elect to re
turn to college. K. A. Bickel, '07.
former editor of the "Sequoia," has
accepted a position as eity editor of
the"Daily News" of San Francisco.
Harold hitch, ex-07, editor-elect of
the"Daily Palo Alto," is shortly to
engage in newspaper work in Tono
pah, Nevada. W. F. Herron, who
will direct the editing of the first
number of the "Sequoia," has been
prominent in literary and debating
circles since he entered Stanford two
years and a half ago. He has been an
assistant anil an associate editor of
the "Sequoia," to the staff of which
magazine he was appointed in his
Freshman year. In debating he was
one of the trio to compose the Carnot
debating team last semester and also
represented Stanford on the Inter
collegiate team.
G. J. Presley, '07, one of the new
members of the Executive Commit
tee, is captain of the Varsity baseball
team, and has covered the first bag
for the Cardinal for two successive
seasons, having won his Varsity em
blem in his Sophomore year. Pres
ley was captain of his class nine last
spring and served on the Executive
Committee in his Sophomore year
He is a member of Encina Club. His
major is Law and he registers from
San Francisco.
J. O. Miller, '08, won his "S" in his
Freshman year in the Intercollegiate
field day against the University of
California. Through slush and water
on the Berkeley oval Miller took first
place in the mile and the quarter and
third in the half-mile. He is one of
Stanford's strongest distance runners
Miller registers in the Civil Engineer
ing department from Palo Alto.
It was decided in last night's meet
ing to fence the baseball field. The
work will be commenced as soon as
lumber and carpenters can be se
cured to do the job and should be
completed shortly after the first
games. While the spectators of the
games for which admission was
charged, have been loyal in paying
their fee and coming on the bleach
ers, the fence which is to be built will
not only net a few more admissions
to the management but will prevent
the possibility of spectators who are
standing just outside the foul lines
from interfering with the players.
Before the football team left for
the northern trip the Executive Com
mitte voted $200 to cover the ex
penses of Coach Lanagan and Man
ager Sales, in addition to the $1,500
subscribed and sent to Sales by Man
ager Woodward of the Vancouver
aggregation, for the use of the Stan
ford team. Manager Sales reported
to the Executive Committee that the
total expenses of the trip amounted
to $1,683, which leaves a balance of
about $17 over and above all ex
penses. Sales was also authorized to
let contracts at once for the bleach
ers on the new track.

It was decided in last night's meet
ing to fence the baseball field. The
work will be commenced as soon as
lumber and carpenters can be se
cured to do the job and should be
completed shortly after the first
games. While the spectators of the
games for which admission was
charged, have been loyal in paying
their fee and coming on the bleach
ers, the fence which is to be built will
not only net a few more admissions
to the management but will prevent
the possibility of spectators who are
standing just outside the foul lines
from interfering with the players.
Before the football team left for
the northern trip the Executive Com
mitte voted $200 to cover the ex
penses of Coach Lanagan and Man
ager Sales, in addition to the $1,500
subscribed and sent to Sales by Man
ager Woodward of the Vancouver
aggregation, for the use of the Stan
ford team. Manager Sales reported
to the Executive Committee that the
total expenses of the trip amounted
to $1,683, which leaves a balance of
about $17 over and above all ex
penses. Sales was also authorized to
let contracts at once for the bleach
ers on the new track.
