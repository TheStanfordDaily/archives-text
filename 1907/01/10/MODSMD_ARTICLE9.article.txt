Lake Lagunita, which lias played a
prominent part in Stanford life and
Stanford traditions, and which was
justly considered one of the most
beautiful spots on the campus, seems
destined to be lost forever, unless the
efforts of the Boat Club to preserve
it meet with a heartier response than
has yet been accorded them. The
final decision of the Trustees not to
expend the large sum necessary for
a new flume this year will leave the
lake dry all semester. As a conse
quence the banks of Lagunita will be
so cracked, that seepage would render
any future attempt to lill the lake im
possible. The members of the Boat
Club who are now at work on the
flume state positively that temporary
repairs, which would make it poss
ible to lill the lake at once, can easily
be made. Coach Murphy and Captain
Zimmerman had announced that they
were planning to put the crew candi
dates to work 011 the flume. This an
nouncement probably accounts for
the fact that but eight men signed up
yesterday in answer to the first call.
It is certainly as much the duty of the
boating candidates to do this work
as it is for them to practice on the
rowing machines at the orders of the
coach. Their failure to recognize and
respond to this does not speak well
for their spirit. Over live hundred
men worked day and night at Cali

fornia to get the football field in
shape for the intercollegiate game. It
is the duty of the boating men to
show that they have as much spirit
and energy as the Blue and Gold by
turning out and working under the
direction of their Captain and Coach
for the preservation of Lagunita.
