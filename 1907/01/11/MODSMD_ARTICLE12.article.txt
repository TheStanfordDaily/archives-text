The announcement of the dates and
/
speakers for two student body assem
blies during the month of January
shows that the Faculty Committee
on Public Exercises is preparing to
follow out the active policy pursued
by it last semester. Under its re
gime, assemblies were held more reg
ularly than ever before, and the
speakers who addressed these gather
ings were, as a rule, well worth hear
ing. A continuance of this policy
cannot fail to make the assemblies
more popular than ever and to in
crease the student body attendance.
At Wednesday's assembly President
Jordan will deliver bis address to the
incoming Freshman class. It is to
be hoped that the President will also
make use of this opportunity to pre
sent to the Student Body his views
on the football situation. Dr. Jordan
is known to be a staunch advocate of
the Rugby game, but his ideas on the
subject of any student body agitation
against it are awaited with interest
by the entire student body.
