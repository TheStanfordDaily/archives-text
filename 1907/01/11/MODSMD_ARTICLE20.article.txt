The following letter, regarding the
Northern trip of the team, was re
ceived today from an alumnus who
is well known both at Stanford and
in the outside world. We regret that
lack of space prevents the printing
of the letter in toto.
Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
This was the first time, for many
of us, that we saw a game of Rugby
football. We are still talking about
it, and discussing the merits of the
game as compared with the old game.
The consensus of opinion seems to
be that the old game is the more
intense, in spots, and raises within a
spectator a higher pitch of excite
ment, at moments, but that, taking
the game as a whole, Rugby is far
more interesting from start to finish,
because there is something doing all
the time, and there are none of those
long tiresome intervals such as we
had in the American game. Some
of 11s, however, still feel that there
is not the intense working up to a
climax such as we had in the other
game, and that for that reason, it does
not equal the old style of play.
But, aside from the game, we are
very anxious to send to the Univer
sity our message of congratulations
011 the splendid representatives that
she has in her football team. They
have simply done the University 110
end of good, by the impression they
made in the Northwest. Any num
ber of instances may be cited, but I
think that one expression is typical
of them all. It was voiced by one of
the guests of the hotel where the
team stopped in this city, when he
said: "I have been all over the United
States, have met all kinds of college
men, especially football men, and I
never have met a college team who
were their equals as true sportsmen
and gentlemen."
They not only play football. They
can sing better than any musical or
ganization that we ever heard at
Stanford. They sang for us, all the
old songs, and then a whole lot of
new ones that we had never heard,
and that simply set us 011 fire with
enthusiasm. Stanford men all over
Seattle are still whistling "Cheer Up
Mary."
