# WORK BEGINS MONDAY
## MURPHY WILL START MEN ON MACHINES. Boat Club Holds Important Meeting Last Night to Discuss Financial Policy. 
### 
The first meeting of the Boat Club
this semester was held at the boat
house last night and active prepara
tions were made for getting the work
for the season under way. Coach
Murphy was present at the meeting
and announced that everything would
be in full swing by Monday, by which
time it is expected that all the men
will have signed up to begin train
ing. He especially emphasized the
fact that it is necessary for the Fresh
man candidates to come out as soon
as possible and begin work 011 the
machines, which have been trans
ferred to the boat house.
The question of collecting money
owing the Club was discussed at some
length. As it is necessary to raise
$40 every month towards Murphy's
salary, a number of men pledged
themselves to give a dollar a month.
Since that time but few of the prom
ises have been kept and as a con
sequence when the time came for
Murphy to come West three mem
bers of the Club had to raise money
on personal notes to provide railroad
fare. Active means -will now be tak
en to collect dues for the last two
months, and if these can be collected
the Club will be able to meet current
expenses.
It was further decided to give
either a minstrel show or two skating
parties this semester to raise money
to pay off the debt of several years'
standing. Arrangements were left
in the hands of a committee appointed
by President Turner.
A telegram was received from Da
vey and Sons, the shell builders, that
the steamship company would accept
the shell for shipment at New York.
If so the boat will be here the latter
part of February or the first of
March. Meanwhile Murphy will be
gin developing two strong four-oared
crews so that the men will be ready
to step into the eight as soon as it
arrives.
Several requests have been received
from various clubs for races during
the present season, but this matter
was allowed to go over until the
work is further advanced. The only
other official business was the elec
tion of R. A. Carter, '08, to honorary
membership in the Club.
