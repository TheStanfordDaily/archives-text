# Washouts Delay Many Students.
## 
### 
Owing to washouts on the South
ern Pacific between Los Angeles and
Ventura many students of the Uni
versity have been prevented from en
tering college on time. Most of those
delayed are from Los Angeles. A
few arc residents of Arizona.
Not only has the delay been caused
by washouts on the Southern Pacific
but other lines have been effected
by the severe storms in the South.
Railroad officials say that the line will
be open by tomorrow, while other
reports have it that the lines will not
be open for more than a week.
