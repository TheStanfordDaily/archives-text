# REHEARSALS NEXT WEEK
## Professor Gray Is Making Arrangements for Sophomore Production. 
### 
At a conference of the Sophomore
play committee, members of the class
who are trying out for the cast and
Professor Gray, engaged as coach for
the production of the class play "You
Never Can Tell, ' held this afternoon,
the coach announced that in prepara
tion for the rehearsals he wished to
be assured of the good standing of
each aspirant for the cast.
As soon as the coach feels certain
that every person trying out can af
ford all the time necessary for re
hearsals, he will commence upon the
business of production. When he
has learned from the successful can
didates for the cast how many rehear
sals they wish, and considering how
many they need, he can estimate, in
conjunction with the play committee,
the approximate length of time re
quired for study of lines and practice
in delivery. Then some definite date
can be set for the presentation of the
comedy. It has been the custom that
the Sophomore comedy be held early
in the spring semester, either toward
the end of January or in the first part
of February, and in order to have the
play in readiness for some date next
month, work must be pushed as rap
idly as possible.
Some delay has been developed by
the failure of three or four probable
members of the cast to return to col
lege. But the coach has expressed
himself as pleased with the amount of
good dramatic material disclosed in
the 1009 tryouts and it seems that
little difficulty should be experienced
in choosing and training substitutes,
as the candidates were judged, to a
certain extent, with a view to the
selection of understudies.
