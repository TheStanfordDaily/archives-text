# OARSMEN SIGNED UP
## OVER THIRTY ANSWER THE FIRST CALL. Flume Is Completed and Lagunita Will Probably Be Filled This Week. 
### 
Over thirty men have already
signed up with Coach Murphy for
the rowing season, and of these six
teen are Freshmen. Both old men
and new ones have been slow in sign
ing this year, but this has been due
mostly to the bad weather, and the
end of the week should see double
that number at work on the machines.
The outlook for a Freshman crew
is considerably better than last year,
and the indications arc that Murphy
will have an unusually heavy squad
from which to select. Seven men in
the new squad are over six feet tall
and weigh in the neighborhood of 200
pounds. However, the success of the
crew depends to a large extent, on the
number of men, and Murphy is
anxious to have double the present
number sign up.
The old men have not begun work
yet as most of them have been de
voting their time to repairing the
flume. The work was finished yester
day and the water turned into the
lake. The fountain is also running,
and this with the heavy rains and
drainage should fill the lake in a short
time.
