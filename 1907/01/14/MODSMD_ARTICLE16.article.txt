# Poor Baseball Prospects at U.C.
## 
### 
Baseball prospccts at U. C. have
been badly shattered by the an
nouncement that neither Captain
elect Gi 1 lis, the crack second-baseman
nor Schaeffer, the Freshman catcher
of last year, will return to college.
Graham, first base and Gunn, the vet
eran third sacker have both been lost
by graduation also, so that a com
plete reorganization of the Blue and
Gold nine will probably be necessary.
These losses are partially compen
sated for by the return of Dick Wul
zen, who played on the '04 varsity
in right field.
