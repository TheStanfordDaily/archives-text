# ABE MAKES NO GUARANTEE.
## Presley Receives Letter From Waseda's Manager Concerning Baseball Trip. 
### 
A letter lias just been received by-
Captain G. J. Presley, '07, from Iso
Abe, manager of the baseball team of
Waseda University. It is in regard
to the proposed post-season trip to
Japan of the Stanford nine. Mr. Abe
will not promise any guarantee, but
he states that the team would un
doubtedly make practically all of its
expenses. He says further: "We
have never taken gate receipts here,
but we could charge ten cents in our
games with you. There is more en
thusiasm over baseball here than in
America and I believe 1 can secure
for you five or six games besides
those with us."
It seems that June is the worst
month for the team to make the trip,
for besides being examination time
in the colleges and schools of Japan,
it is also hot and rainy. So Mr. Abe
advises Presley to try and arrange
the games for September.
