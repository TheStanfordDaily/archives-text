# EASTER TRIP PLANNED
## MUSICAL CLUBS WILL BE ACTIVE THIS SEMESTER. Complete Reorganization of Mandolin and Glee Will Be Made Soon. 
### 
The musical clubs will resume prac
tice this semester. In the case of the
Glee, with most of the exceptionally
good material of last semester back,
the prospects for one of the best
clubs in the history of the University
are exceedingly bright. Last semes
ter, after the decision to drop the
Christmas trip was made, they con
tinned practicing but the incentive
necessary to the best work was iack
ing. This semester the matter lies
with the men on the clubs. The lead
ers have practically the assurance of
a trip during Easter vacation if the
clubs put themselves into conecrt
shape.
Tonight the Glee Club meets for
its first practice this year. A tryout
will be held shortly to cut the club
down to manageable shape. Event
ually it will number about sixteen
members. At least one concert will
be given, and possibly two. There
are always the chances for week end
trips, especially during the second se
mester, .and one or two will doubt
less be made by the combined clubs,
as arrangements are already under
way.
The Mandolin Club starts at some
disadvantage as not enough of the
material which came out for the try
outs last semester was up to the
standard. There can, however, with
all the available material in college,
be developed, a club which will be
fully able to maintain the standard set
by the Mandolin Clubs of past years.
In addition to this, a club, however
mediocre, would develop experienced
material for next year.
