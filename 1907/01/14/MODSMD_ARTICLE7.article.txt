Of the one hundred and thirty wo
men students of the University resid
ing in Palo Alto, over sixty were
present at a meeting held Saturday
afternoon. Mrs. E. H. Matzke pre
sided, and made an informal talk up
on the necessity for an organization
among the Palo Alto women. Each
student present was then asked to ex
press her views in regard to the pro
posed organization, and the sentiment
was unanimously in favor of the prop
osition.
It was decided that the organization
should meet one Saturday afternoon
in each month, and by unanimous
vote its affairs were left, until the
next meeting, in the hands of a com
mittece consisting of Miss V. Town
send, chairman, Miss A. Meyers, '07,
Miss J. I). Randall, '07, Miss J.
Zschokke, '07, Miss G. M. Gilbert,

Dr. Jordan made an informal talk,
commending the Palo Alto students
upon their action and inviting the
members of the club to elect two of
their number to represent them in
the President's Conference of Young
Women. The committee was em
powered by the club to act as a nom
inating committee and to decide upon
a date for the next session, when
officers and representatives will be
elected.
