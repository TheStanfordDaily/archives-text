# MEET WITH OREGON
## POSSIBILITY THAT WEBFOOT TEAM WILL COME. Cardinal Greatly Weakened By Loss of Rawles and Cope, Who Will Not Return. 
### 
Track Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07,
returned to the campus today from
the North. While in Eugene, Ore
gon, Macfarland had a talk with P.
McArthur, an alumnus of the Univer
sity of Oregon, who is much inter
ested in track athletics, and who in
formed the Cardinal captain that Ore
gon is very anxious to hold meets
with both Stanford and California this
spring.
If satisfactory arrangements can he
made the Webfoot athletes will come
South some time during the last of
March. Both Trainer "Dad" Moul
ton and Macfarland are very much in
favor of a meet with Oregon.
"Such a meet should he close and
interesting,", said Moulton today.
"Oregon has some fast men. Kellcy
is very good in the sprints, holding
the world's record of nine and three
fifths seconds in the hundred, which
is as fast as that wizard runner, Duffy,
ever covered the distance, and also,
I believe, he has the coast record in
the two-twenty, which is close to
twenty-five seconds. In addition,
Oregon has Moores, the hurdler, Mc-
Kinney, who puts the shot over forty
five feet, and Moullen, formerly of
Lick, who is a consistent performer
in both the pole-vault and the
weights.
Stanford's strength in the quarter
and the sprints will be greatly dimin
ished this season by the loss of W.
W. Rawles, '09, and E. C. Cope, '08,
who have suddenly decided not to re
turn to college. Rawles showed up
especially well last year in the four
forty, generally leading the Cardinal
men home in this event, and Cope was
one of Stanford's fastest men in the
shorter distances.
