The Sophomore play committee
does not expect the copies of "You
Never Can Tell," that were ordered
from London five weeks ago, as 110
word has been received since the or
der was placed.
Tt has been suggested that through
J the fewness of the lines of two of the
characters, nine books will do. It
seems probable that nine copies can
be secured by purchasing Shaw's two
volume plays, and through private
copies.
