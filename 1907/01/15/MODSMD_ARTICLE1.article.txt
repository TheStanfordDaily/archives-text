# MAY CHARGE TUITION
## BILL BROUGHT BEFORE LEGISLATURE BY TRUSTEES. Professional and Engineering Students Will Be Charged to Provide for Medical College. 
### 
At yesterday's session of the State
Legislature, a bill was introduced,
which, if passed, will allow the charg
ing of tuition fees in the Professional
and Engineering courses of Stanford
University. In return for the exemp
tion from taxation of the University
buildings and bonds, fees for tuition
cannot be charged unless sanctioned
by a special act of the Legislature.
The primary object of this bill is
to allow the establishment of a Medi
cal department here. This move has
been contemplated for a long time
by the Trustees, but was a financial
impossibility. The charging, of tui
tion fees will solve the difficulty. In
the event of the passage of the bill,
it is not probable that an entirely
new department will be instituted,
but rather that Cooper Medical Col
lege, of San Francisco, will become
affiliated with the University. This
affiliation has also long been thought
of, but 110 official action has ever been
taken. Such a union would be a
great benefit to Stanford, and would
undoubtedly prove much more effi
cient than the establishment of a new
department.
Nothing definite has yet been done,
as the whole matter depends upon the
passage of the bill now before the
Legislature.
Dr. Jordan says that the proposed
act would have but little effect upon
present University work. In all prob
ability it will pertain only to those
seeking advanced degrees. It is ex
pressly stipulated that students now
in the University are not to be in
cluded, and that the fees are to be
charged in the Professional and En
gineering Courses alone.
In urging the passage of the bill,
the Board of Trustees points out the
fact that tuition is charged in the
above-named courses in all the lead
ing Eastern universities, as well as at
the University of California. The
Trustees state further that there has
not yet been established here any
Engineering or Professional course
as efficient as desired. They want to
keep up the highest possible standard
in all things, but they do not feel
justified in making the large expend
itures necessary for the best mainten
ance of the courses in question.
They assert that the establishment of
some important departments and the
highest efficiency of others depends
upon the charging of tuition fees.
But they want it remembered that
"the entire net income of the Univer
sity must and will be devoted to the
promotion of higher education."
It seems indeed that the charging
of tuition would benefit all concerned
and that those who may have to pay
the fees will be enabled thereby to be
come better fitted in the course thev
pursue.
Nothing could be learned as to the
probable amount -of-the pr-oposed fee.
