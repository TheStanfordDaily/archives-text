# ELLIOTT MAKES DENIAL.
## Registrar Says He Knows Nothing of Rumored Raising of Scholarship Standards. 
### 
The rumor is prevalent that in the
near future scholarship requirements
of matriculated students will be ma
tcrially raised. The report has been
given weight by various department
heads and it is reported that some
have even made the statement that
beginning with next semester approx
imately twenty per cent better work
will be required in all branches.
However, Registrar Elliott disclaims
any knowledge of such a proposed
change.
"If such action is to be taken, I do
not know anything about it," said
he this morning. "If the standard is
to be raised in any particular depart
ment the authority for the change
will probably come from the head
of that department. I will say that
110 such order as that spoken of has
been made from this office."
It is well known that the efforts
are being directed to restrict in
creased enrollment in the University.
In fact with this end in view, the
requirement of full undergraduate
standing will be made of future
Freshman classes, and in view of the
well defined attitude of the faculty
with respect to limitations 011 the
size of the student body it would not
be at all surprising if there were a
substantial basis to the current rumor.
