# Hockey Squad Forms Club.
## 
### 
The first meeting of the Women's
Hockey Committee for this semester,
was held late yesterday afternoon.
It was decided that last semester's
enthusiasm for hockey warranted the
forming of the squad into a club, and
that at the next meeting the offices
of secretary and treasurer, will be
open for nominations. The captain
of the squad, Miss E. Palmer, '10, will
remain in office as head of the club.
I'urther subjects of discussion were
the details of the new uniform to be
adopted, the days for practice, and
the posting of a signing-up list. It
was decided to post the list on the
rest rooni door, with instructions for
the choice of the two most convenient
days for playing, by each candidate.
