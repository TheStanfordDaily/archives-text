the meeting by reporting for the play
committee. Bush outlined the diffi
culties encountered and progress
made by the committee from the be
ginning up to the present time. The
report of the committee was ac
cepted. E. E. Young then arose and
declared that the suggestion of chang
ing the play, which had been dis
cussed informally, had not come from
the committee, but there seemed to
be sufficient uncertainty as to the
wishes of the class to warrant re
consideration of the play chosen.
Young said that the committee was
anxious to answer any questions
which might be asked. R. S. Worth
ington started the interrogation by
asking if a change to the "Merchant
of Venice" was proposed by the
coach, which was answered in the
affirmative.
Then A. L. Johnson commenced an
argument for switching to the "Mer
chant of Venice," by saying that
the class ought to follow the advice
of Professor Gray, the coach, and
that "You Never Can '1 ell" had been
given only by professionals. He was
answered by D. G. Heinly, who
sprang to his feet and said, "Mr.
President; the gentleman evidently
doesn't know what he is talking
about." Heinly quoted Professor
Huston, of the Law department to
the effect that "You Never Can Tell"
was successfully produced at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin. Heinly stated
that he was opposed to the "Merchant
of Venice" because it was so much in
vogue in high schools, and he would
rather sec the class produce a modern
play.
C. B. Bradford moved that the com

mittcc go ahead. Tlie motion was
seconded from all parts of the room.
Bush stated that the matter of play
hooks could he arranged, and a mo
tion to leave the class production to
the discretion of the committtee was
cried down.
