### 
The track season will be formally
ushered in next Thursday evening by
a rally in the Encina Club room, at
7:30. Three speakers will address the
men, but only two have been chosen
thus far: Trainer "Dad" Moulton and
Track Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07.
The University Orchestra will make
its initial appearance of this semester.
It was announced last week that all
track candidates should sign up to
day, but Captain Macfarland decided
to postpone the enrollment until the
conclusion of the rally next Thursday
evening. Already many prospective
candidates have turned out and are
now engaged in light work. Strict
training rules will go into effect next
Monday.
Never before has a track rally been
held at the beginning of the semester,
and it is to be hoped that a large
crowd will be present.
