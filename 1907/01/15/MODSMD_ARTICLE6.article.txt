# SENIORS WANT REPORT
## COMMITTEE WILL INVESTIGATE "QUAD" FINANCES. Class of '07 Desires Statement from J.F. Brennan for Funds Expended. 
### 
Persistent rumors on the campus
affecting the financial management of
the 1907 "Quad," have caused some
discussion, and have led President E.
P. Stott, '07, to arrange for the ap
pointment of a committee of three
to conduct an investigation.
Rumors, and the inability to pro
cure a report from J. F. Brennan, '07,
manager of the "Quad," coupled with
the fact that the printing company
alleges that it did not receive the con
tract price for printing, has led the
class president to take such action.
So hazy are the rumors affecting the
financial management of the class
volume, that nothing definite is known
by class leaders. No aspersions are
cast upon Brennan, but the class
would like to have a report of the
financial status of the matter. The
committee will be appointed to dis
cover as far as possible, what became
of funds subscribed by fraternities,
clubs, and other organizations. The
"Quad" assessments, which according
to President Stott, amounted to $3.50
a member, have all been paid, and
were turned over to Brennan. The
entire sum collected by the "Quad''
manager for advertisements, etc., was
about $1200. Expenditures from this
amount were made by the manager,
but a detailed report, it is said, is not
available.
The money collected was turned
over before the earthquake, and most,
if not all, the advertising contracts,
were paid for by subscribers. The
printing company, with which a con
tract was made by Brennan for the
printing, now alleges that only a part
of the contract price was advanced,
and this amount was later turned
back to Brennan and his receipt taken
for the amount. The company claims
to hold a receipt for the money.
K. A. Bickel, '07, editor of
"Quad," has turned over to President
Stott, a letter giving the amount of
expenses allowed him. These ex
penses amounted to about $75. Bren
nan, it is said, advanced his advertis
ing agents ten per cent on their com
missions. These expenditures, with
payments said to have been made the
printing company, and for cuts, and
incidentals, constitute all known ex
penditures by the "Quad" manager.
Brennan, when asked for a report
of the finances, reported to the class
that lie was unable to submit one,
because all reports and stubs were
destroyed in the April fire.
President Stott has not yet selected
his committee but expects to do so
in a few days. The president of the
class wishes it to be known that he
does not make any charges, and is un
willing to have it believed that the
financial report cannot be straight
ened out. Brennan's report that his
stubs and receipts burned up in the
fire, is taken in the spirit in which it
is given, but it is desired to have
Brennan come before the class and
make either a written or a verbal
report of the matter.
