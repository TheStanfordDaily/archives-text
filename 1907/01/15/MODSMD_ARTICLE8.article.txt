The last committee appointed to
amend the student body constitution
provided an excellent remedy for the
practice of voting for and possibly
electing unnominatcd candidates at
elections where there was little gene
ral interest. At the same time they
neglected to do away with the foolish
and unnecessary system of holding
elections when there was 110 contest
for the office. Carrying out their re
form to its logical conclusion, they
could have saved the student body
no little trouble and expense by mak
ing such elections unanimous by the
expiration of the time appointed for
further nominations. The two or
three dollars expended for the print
ing of ballots is thrown away to keep
alive a useless formality, and the un
willing election board is dragged from
other and more important duties to
preside over a foregone conclusion.
If the present Executive Committee
contemplates another constitutional
reform, they should begin it by abol
ishing the present useless system of
uncontested elections.
