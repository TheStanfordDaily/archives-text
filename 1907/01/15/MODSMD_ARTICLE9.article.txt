The decision of the leaders of the
Mandolin Club to attempt a resurrec
tion of that dormant organization,
gives the musical interests of the Uni
versity a last chance to demonstrate
that they are still capable of doing
something. Last semester the men
who directed the destinies of the
Club were forced to admit that there
was not enough good material in the
student body to get together a club
which was up to the standard of past
years. As a consequence the Glee
Club, which was in better condition
than it bad been for many seasons,
was forced to forego its Christmas
trip,â€”practically the only reward of
all the rehearsals and work of a se

mester. Such a condition of affairs
could hardly be blamed upon the
leaders of the Mandolin Club, who
took the only action possible under
the circumstances. The fault lies
with the men in the student body
who have the ability but who lack
the interest and the spirit; who are
willing to stand by and see an organ
ization, which has done much for the
good of Stanford in the past, die, be
cause they are too selfish to sacrifice
the little time and effort on their part
necessary to keep it alive. They arc
the responsible parties and the blame
should fall upon them rather than
upon the leaders of the Club, who
are making every effort for its re
estaldishment. The proposed Easter
trip should not be permitted to share
the fate of the plans which were made
for a Christmas tour at the close of
last semester.
