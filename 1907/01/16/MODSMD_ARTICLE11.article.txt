utive Committee this semester will be

which will probably receive consider
ation are the filling of the vacancy
on the Guild Board caused by the
graduation of J. N. Stanford, '06, fenc
ing the baseball field, building the
track bleachers, and the action to be
taken by Stanford's members of the

to fence the baseball field, and ask for
bids for the construction of the
bleachers at the new track. The
fence around the old oval is to be
used around the baseball field and
steps for the furtherance of these two
building propositions will probably be
