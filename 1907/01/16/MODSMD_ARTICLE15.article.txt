# OFFER SIXTY DOLLAR PRIZE.
## Junior Committee Will Pay Big Sum for Best Opera Submitted in Competition. 
### 
The Junior Opera Committee met
yesterday afternoon and voted to ap
propriate $60 for the best score for
the class production, which will be
given during the last week of March.
Manuscripts and scores must be
handed to the chairman of the com
mittee, E. N. Smith, before the 15th
of February.
In offering a larger prize than has
been customary in the past, the com
mittee has further decided to throw
the competition open to any one con
nected with Stanford, whether under
graduates, graduates, or members of
the faculty. Furthermore the com
mittee reserves the right to reject
all manuscripts in favor of a standard
light opera if the material submitted
is not considered up to standard.
E. J. Swift was appointed a mem
ber of the committee at yesterday's
meeting.
