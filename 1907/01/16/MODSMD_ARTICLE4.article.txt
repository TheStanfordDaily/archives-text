# DR. JORDAN WILL SUPPORT RUGBY.
## English Game Will Continue to Be Played at Stanford. Professor Hempl Addresses Student Body Gathering. 
### 
Stanford will play Rugby next se
mester. President Jordan, at the
first Assembly of the semester this
morning, expressed his views on foot
ball in a way that could not be
doubted. He is unalterably opposed
to the American game, and will not
in any way sanction the reestablish
ment of the old style of play.
"All know what my views on the
subject of football are," said Dr. Jor
dan. "A year ago a choice was of
fered to a committee of selecting
Rugby, Association, or 110 game at
all. The committee chose to play the
English game. Rugby will be played
until the rules of the American game
are changed so that they will be ac
ceptable. The game in the East has
not yet reached a stable condition,
and it would not be fair to change
to the American at this time. We
are determined that Rugby will be
played at Stanford until it has been
given a fair trial."
Although Dr. Jordan's views on
Rugby have been well known, it was
not known definitely what position he
would take before the body of stu
dents in Assembly Hall this morning.
Close attention was given his re
marks, but there was no demonstra
tion when the announcement was
made. Most of those present took
it as a matter of course that such an
announcement would be forthcoming.
"It is the intention to have more
athletic fields on the campus," said
Dr. Jordan. "Next year it will be
Rugby or no game at all, unless the
game as played in the East has been
remodeled so that all the objection
able features, including interference
and rough play, are removed."
Dr. Jordan's purpose in addressing
the Assembly, besides introducing
Dr. George Hempl, the new head of
the German department, to the stu
dents, was, he said, "not to talk on
football matters but to address the
Seniors." Dr. Jordan spoke in part
as follows: "There are two classes of
men in America. One that tries to
make more than they earn, and the
other to earn more than they make.
It is our desire to educate our men
to earn more than they make. The
time demands efficiency. It demands
those who can work to the best ad
vantage. There are many things to
do in this century, and we must hurry
in these strenuous times.
"Life under present conditions,
should be democratic, and it is now
necessary to find men who can do
things. \\ e do not care what a man
is but what lie can do. The demand
now is, however, that men shall be

trained. It is as easy to do big
things as to do small ones, but it
needs training to do such things."
Here Dr. Jordan mentioned the im
pressions the engineering men made
in the world. He referred to the fact
that those who will succeed in life
will not, during these progressive
times, obtain their training outside
the university. "The best men and
the best women will save time by uni
versity work," said the President. "It
is the man who knows how to take
care of his time who will succeed."
In referring to the allegations of
graft that have become a scandal in
the country, Dr. Jordan gave an ex
planation that would cause anti-graft
editors to take heart, and a more op
timistic view of the subject.
He said, "The times now demand
character in a man. It is not that
men are now more corrupt than in
the past, but that they are found out
sooner. Other countries are prone to
legalize long standing wrongs. Such
is not the case in this country."
He referred to opinions of other
countries in regard to the graft ex
isting in the United States, but said
that as the country was now having
a house cleaning it would do no harm.
In closing his address to the Se
niors he impressed upon them the ne
cessity of maintaining cheerfulness,
humor, conscience, and sober mind
edness. He maintained that spurious
happiness was not real happiness, and
that if college men were to succeed
it would be only by observing rules
of life as strict as those maintained
during the seasons of training while
in the University.
Professor George Hempl was intro
duced in Assembly by President Jor
dan. Professor Hempl confined him
self to general remarks of life at the
University. Dr. HempPs address was
short, but it was well received. He
made a distinct impression on the
minds of those present as to his lit
erary ability. In his opening remarks
he paid a tribute to the membership
in the University, and explained the
way in which he decided to come to
Stanford.
Dr. Hempl said that he came to the
University entirely in sympathy with
the University and with his depart
ment. His impressions of the stu
dents of the University were good, lie
said. He gave a glowing description
of his impressions of California and
of Stanford in particular. His re
marks were received with applause.
Owing to inclement weather the
first Assembly was not as well at
tended as those of last semester.

dents, was, he said, "not to talk on
football matters but to address the
Seniors." Dr. Jordan spoke in part
as follows: "There are two classes of
men in America. One that tries to
make more than they earn, and the
other to earn more than they make.
It is our desire to educate our men
to earn more than they make. The
time demands efficiency. It demands
those who can work to the best ad
vantage. There are many things to
do in this century, and we must hurry
in these strenuous times.
"Life under present conditions,
should be democratic, and it is now
necessary to find men who can do
things. \\ e do not care what a man
is but what lie can do. The demand
now is, however, that men shall be

trained. It is as easy to do big
things as to do small ones, but it
needs training to do such things."
Here Dr. Jordan mentioned the im
pressions the engineering men made
in the world. He referred to the fact
that those who will succeed in life
will not, during these progressive
times, obtain their training outside
the university. "The best men and
the best women will save time by uni
versity work," said the President. "It
is the man who knows how to take
care of his time who will succeed."
In referring to the allegations of
graft that have become a scandal in
the country, Dr. Jordan gave an ex
planation that would cause anti-graft
editors to take heart, and a more op
timistic view of the subject.
He said, "The times now demand
character in a man. It is not that
men are now more corrupt than in
the past, but that they are found out
sooner. Other countries are prone to
legalize long standing wrongs. Such
is not the case in this country."
He referred to opinions of other
countries in regard to the graft ex
isting in the United States, but said
that as the country was now having
a house cleaning it would do no harm.
In closing his address to the Se
niors he impressed upon them the ne
cessity of maintaining cheerfulness,
humor, conscience, and sober mind
edness. He maintained that spurious
happiness was not real happiness, and
that if college men were to succeed
it would be only by observing rules
of life as strict as those maintained
during the seasons of training while
in the University.
Professor George Hempl was intro
duced in Assembly by President Jor
dan. Professor Hempl confined him
self to general remarks of life at the
University. Dr. HempPs address was
short, but it was well received. He
made a distinct impression on the
minds of those present as to his lit
erary ability. In his opening remarks
he paid a tribute to the membership
in the University, and explained the
way in which he decided to come to
Stanford.
Dr. Hempl said that he came to the
University entirely in sympathy with
the University and with his depart
ment. His impressions of the stu
dents of the University were good, lie
said. He gave a glowing description
of his impressions of California and
of Stanford in particular. His re
marks were received with applause.
Owing to inclement weather the
first Assembly was not as well at
tended as those of last semester.
Stanford will play Rugby next se
mester. President Jordan, at the
first Assembly of the semester this
morning, expressed his views on foot
ball in a way that could not be
doubted. He is unalterably opposed
to the American game, and will not
in any way sanction the reestablish
ment of the old style of play.
"All know what my views on the
subject of football are," said Dr. Jor
dan. "A year ago a choice was of
fered to a committee of selecting
Rugby, Association, or 110 game at
all. The committee chose to play the
English game. Rugby will be played
until the rules of the American game
are changed so that they will be ac
ceptable. The game in the East has
not yet reached a stable condition,
and it would not be fair to change
to the American at this time. We
are determined that Rugby will be
played at Stanford until it has been
given a fair trial."
Although Dr. Jordan's views on
Rugby have been well known, it was
not known definitely what position he
would take before the body of stu
dents in Assembly Hall this morning.
Close attention was given his re
marks, but there was no demonstra
tion when the announcement was
made. Most of those present took
it as a matter of course that such an
announcement would be forthcoming.
"It is the intention to have more
athletic fields on the campus," said
Dr. Jordan. "Next year it will be
Rugby or no game at all, unless the
game as played in the East has been
remodeled so that all the objection
able features, including interference
and rough play, are removed."
Dr. Jordan's purpose in addressing
the Assembly, besides introducing
Dr. George Hempl, the new head of
the German department, to the stu
dents, was, he said, "not to talk on
football matters but to address the
Seniors." Dr. Jordan spoke in part
as follows: "There are two classes of
