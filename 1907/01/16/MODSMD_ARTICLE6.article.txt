# OFFERS SUMMER TRIP
## NEW ZEALAND SUGGESTS RUGBY SERIES. Dr. Jordan Receives Letter Urging Stanford to Visit Island. No Financial Guarantee Made. 
### 
Following close on the Vancouver
trip comes an offer from far off New
Zealand for a series of match Rugby
games with the Stanford team. Presi
dent Jordan is in receipt of a letter
from a prominent New Zealander, of
fering the suggestion that the Cardi
nal fifteen visit the island during the
coming summer for a continued stay,
and while the writer makes no direct
reference to the details of financing
the trip, the tone of the letter justifies
the belief that it was written after
consultation with the leaders of the
sport in the island, and that they are
willing to guarantee expenses, or at
least to make a flattering financial
offer.
Games in Australia as well as in
New Zealand are suggested, and it is
ohvious from the tone of the writer,
that should Stanford undertake the
trip, they would be expected to stay
perhaps for several weeks or even a
month. A series with the all-star
New Zealanders is proposed and after
that several matches in Sydney, Aus
tralia, a four-day's steamer trip from
New Zealand.
As to climatic conditions the letter
makes mention of the fact that during
the California summer the winter sea
son is on in the Australasian group of
islands, and that as a consequence
Stanford would be but little handi
capped by any radical change in
weather. The winter season of the
South Pacific is far from severe and
compares, so it is said, very favorably
with that of California.
Of course at this time it would be
almost foolish to hazard a guess as to
whether anything will ever come of
the New Zealand proposal. The trip
would be probably the longest and
certainly one of the most expensive
ever undertaken by an American col
legiate athletic team. Further than
that the fact that in New Zealand
Stanford would be meeting the crack
Rugby players of the world, calls for
serious thought. This objection was
raised by Dr. Angell when told of the
proposition this morning.
"We must feel flattered indeed,"
said he, "at the receipt of such a
proposition, but we must not lose
sight of the fact that this is but our
firs* season in the English sport. It
would certainly be a grand trip for
the boys, and from my observation
of the games in the North I have 110
doubt they would make a showing
which would reflect credit on their
college and their coach."
Yet another factor would have to
be considered. To be fit to meet the
champions of the world in a scries of
games, the Stanford team would have
to practice many weeks, perhaps
months in advance. This would re
quire, it would seem, the maintenance
of team organization throughout the
spring scmesten and this would be
well nigh impossible, with Coach Lan
agan busy in the development of a
baseball team, and many of the Var
sity engaged in other athletics.
