Every man who intends to go out
on the truck this semester should at
tend the rally in the Encina club
room tomorrow night. Aside from
the fact that it will he the time for
the formal signing of training rules,
Stanford's track season should be
started with a rush. Our prospects
are growing brighter every day, and
from ante-season indications our
chances of winning the Intercollegiate
are excellent. All that Trainer Moul
ton and Captain Macfarland need is
the material with which to do the
work. Tomorrow's rally should be
made the index of the quality and
quantity of that material.
