The bill introduced into the Cali
fornia legislature by Senator Marshall
Black, asking that Stanford Univer
sity be permitted to charge tuition
in the Professional and Engineering
courses, marks the most radical
change in the policy of the Univer
sity trustees since the death of Mrs.
Stanford. Heretofore the lack of
money to accomplish a certain im
provement, has meant that such an
improvement would never be made.
Xo matter how necessary the change
might appear, it must be effected with
the funds provided by the deed of
gift. Xo extraneous ways and means
of raising money were even consid
ered. The departure from this policy
could not have been made in a better j
cause. Stanford has always suffered ;
from tlie lack of a Medical Depart- I
incut, which was the greatest draw- [
back to her becoming a university in j
fact as well as in name. Affiliation '
with Cooper or the establishment of i
a separate college of medicine, backed j
bv the present strong Department of
Physiology, will be a great benefit to j

her. It will keep on the Coast many
strong men who now go East to com
plete their education at Rush or Johns
Hopkins, and it will ultimately give
the University a body of strong al
umni, of whom she will have good
cause to be proud.
