# TENNIS OUTLOOK FAIR
## TWO VETERANS OF LAST YEAR IN COLLEGE. Gowan and Delano Will Be Stanford's Strongest Representatives on Courts This Season. 
### 
The prospects for a winning team
in the intercollegiate tennis matches
with the University of California next
April, are not as encouraging as was
hoped last semester. But \yith two
members of the 1906 trio still in col
lege and fairly good material to pick
from, should another be needed, Stan
ford will undoubtedly be represented
by a team which should compare very
favorably with those of former years.
It is almost certain that P. B. Del
ano, '08, and A. J. Gowan, '09, will
again be the singles men, and it is
not unlikely that these two will con
stitute the doubles team, as A. J. Cas
sell, ex-'o/, Gowan's partner last
spring, has left college. Gowan now
holds the University championship,
having defeated Delano in the finals
of the tournament held during the
fall semester.
Another man who should make a
strong bid for a place on the team
is T. C. Henry, '10, who represented
his class in the singles tournament
last October. L. Newland, '08, is *»
consistent player, whose chances
ought not be overlooked. It is not
known what material may be found
amongst the entering Freshmen.
The rather discouraging aspect of
the tennis season is not due to any
inferiority of Stanford's players, but
rather to the unusual excellence of
the material available at California.
Besides R. H. Variel, a veteran of two
seasons, the Blue and Gold will have
the services of H. Long, the cham
pion of the California Tennis Club,
of San Francisco.
