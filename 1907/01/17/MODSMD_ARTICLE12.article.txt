During the present rainy season a
journey from Encina or the Row to
the Quad is about as unpleasant an
experience as one would care to un
dergo. The trip involves wading
through the mazes of mud which
cover every crossing so thickly that
safe and comfortable walking is out
of the question. The condition of
these crossings is a disgrace to the
University. The amount of expense
necessary to remedy the evil is trifl
ing and there is no excuse for a con
tinuance of the present state of affairs.
Even a plebeian board walk would be
a great improvement over the present
two inches or more of slush and mud.
