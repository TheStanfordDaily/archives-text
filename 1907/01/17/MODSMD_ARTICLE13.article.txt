The Northern trip of the Rugby
team, the proposed invasion of Japan
by the baseball nine, and the chal
lenge from New Zealand for a series
of football games, form one of the
most important chapters in the his
tory of Stanford. We arc opening up
a new field in international athletics,
the future possibilities of which it is
now difficult to estimate. The per
sistent refusal of the Eastern univer
sities to recognize the existence of
the Coast institutions may be natural
and justifiable. We are young yet
and still lacking in traditions and at
mosphere, but nevertheless we are ex
lending the name and prestige of Am
erican universities into fields of which
N ale and Harvard have never
dreamed. Beside the proposed jour
ney of the Cardinal baseball team to
Japan, the famous trip of the Crimson
crew to row against Cambridge on
the Thames fades to comparative in
significance. Stanford is a pioneer in
the newest and most remarkable de
velopment of intenational, amateur
sport.
