The Executive Committee of the
Stanford Golf Club lias outlined im
portant plans for this semester. With
steady improvemnt of the course and
the increasing popularity of the sport,
the club has a promising season be
fore it. Ten men and fifteen women
have signified their intention of join
ing the club this semester, and when
these are added to the present club
list, the membership will number in
the neighborhood of seventy.
The tournament for the ladies'
championship of the club in which the
contestants will play for the J. J.
Morris silver cup, will take place as
soon as the weather permits. Close
upon this tournament will follow the
mixed foursome contest, for the
championship of which E. Wilson has
donated a handsome trophy. Trips
to the links of other golf clubs in the
vicinity of the University have been
suggested and it is not improbable
that matches can be arranged with
the clubs at Burlingame, San Rafael,
San Jose and Menlo Park.
The rainy season has developed a
growth of soft grass on the course
and the club now has sufficient funds
in the treasury to warrant regular
cutting of the grass and rolling the
course. With continued care the
links will develop an even surface of
turf which will make them among the
best in the State, as the natural lay
of the grounds is excellent. Plat
forms for teeing off have been placed
011 the links and have for the most
part been installed and filled with
earth which will afford a good oppor
tunity for beginning shots. The
bunker near the first hole has been
almost completed.
