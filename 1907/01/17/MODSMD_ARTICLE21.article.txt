# PLAN INTERSOCIETY DEBATE.
## Nestoria Challenges Euphronia to Meet Them on the Rostrum. Date Not Settled. 
### 
If the present plans of the two or
ganizations are carried to a success
ful conclusion there will be an inter
society debate between teams from
Nestoria and Euphronia literary soci
eties. A committee was appointed
last semester by the president of
Nestoria, to formulate a challenge to
the Euphronia Society. This commit
tee was unable to prepare the chall
enge during the Christmas vacation,
but in the meantime members of Eu
phronia heard rumors that they might
expect a challenge, and at Tuesday
night's meeting it was informally de
cided to accept the challenge when
ever it was forthcoming. So al
though no formal challenge has been
delivered it is mutually understood
by tlie two societies that the debate
is to be held. Although no definite
arrangements have been made it is
probable that this event will be held
under the auspices of the Tntersociety
Debating League sometime before
the Intercollegiate debate, and also
that men in either society who have
been on a Carnot or Intercollegiate
team will be debarred from entering
the contest.
