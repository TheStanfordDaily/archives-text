# TRACK MEETS PLANNED
## MANY COAST ATHLETES TO COMPETE ON CAMPUS. New Track Will Be in Readiness for All Big Contests By End of March. 
### 
Preliminary arrangements for seve
ral important track meets on the cam
pus, are being made by Manager
Sales. Indirect assurances have been
received by Sales that he will be suc
cessful in bringing here some of the
best athletes 011 the Coast to com
pete with the Cardinal. The most
important of these meets, from a local
standpoint, if arrangements can be
made, will be that with the Univer
sity of Oregon. Sales has written to
Manager Mac Arthur in regard to the
proposed meet, and will probably re
ceive an answer in several days.
Besides the proposed meet with Or
egon negotiations are under way for
meets with the Olympic Club of San
Francisco, the University of Southern
California, and Oakland High School.
Xo definite dates have yet been se
cured but as assurances of meets have
been given, Sales will be able to an
nounce his schedule within several
days.
1 hese meets will be held as prelim
inaries, to the Stanford-California
games. It is thought that by giving
the track candidates such competi
tion as is proposed, a record breaking
team will be turned out to meet the
Blue and Gold.
Some doubt was expressed a few
days ago about the completion of the
new track in time for any contests.
Work l , will be rushed on the new
grounds as rapidly as possible. This
afternoon bids for fencing the new
grounds will be submitted to Profes
sor C. B. \\ ing. This contract will be
awarded at once. Manager Sales ex
pects that the new track will be in
readiness for all meets by March 30.
All that is now retarding the work
is the condition of the weather. Be
cause of long-continued rains it was
found that the bed of the track had
sunk a few inches, but this defect will
be remedied at once.
