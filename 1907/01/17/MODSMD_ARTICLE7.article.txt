# SQUAD GROWS LARGER
## FIFTY MEN NOW SIGNED UP FOR BOATING. Squad Contains Much Good Material From Which to Develop Eight. Chalmers Out for Crew. 
### 
A large number of men have signed
up for rowing during the past two
days and the squad now numbers
over fifty. The majority of the can
didates are heavy men, and coach
Murphy will have plenty of good ma
terial to choose from.
The old men as well as the new
have begun work 011 the rowing ma
chines at the boat-house, and Murphy
is 011 hand from 8 a. 111. until after
dark so that the men can work any
time during the day.
While it is a little too early to make
any predictions, the indications are
that Murphy will have a fast heavy
crew. All the men of last year's
varsity four, consisting of R. H. Con
ant, 08, J. R. Pemberton, '08, F. Zim
merman, '07, and L. R. Gay, '08, arc
in college and in training, also some
of the substitutes. In addition to
this a number of men who have been
prominently identified in the past with
other branches of college athletics,
have turned their attention to row
ing, thus aiding materially in the pros
pects for this season.
Among the new men who have
signed up is A. J. Chalmers, '07, cap
tain of the '05 Varsity eleven, and well
known as a baseball and football
player. It was generally supposed
that Chalmers would be seen on the
diamond this semester, but he has de
cided to try for his varsity emblem
in another line of sport.
The prospects for a fast Freshman
crew were never better than this year.
Over thirty new men are out and the
majority of them are as heavy as the
varsity candidates.
No definite conclusion has as yet
been reached as to the advisability
of having an eight-oared Freshman
crew. Coach Murphy will turn out
a crew if it is possible to do so, but
much will depend upon the time of
arrival of the shell, which should
leave New York some time this
month.
In addition to the men who signed
up hist week, the following have
turned out: Seniors—A. J. Chalmers,
D. Slusher, C. A. Ferguson; Juniors —
