# MOULTON'S MEN SIGN UP
## WEALTH OF MATERIAL OUT FOR TRACK PLACES. Enthusiastic Rally Held at Encina Hall, Where Speeches Are Cheered By Students. 
### 
Second only in enthusiasm to the
monster football rally last semester
was the meeting of track men at En
cina 11 all last night, when 121 candi
dates signed up for the season.
Speeches and music raised the spirit
of the men to a high pitch, and when
Captain Macfarland closed his talk
there was a rush to procure blanks
from Trainer "Dad" Moulton. Fully
300 students were present at the rally.
They cheered at all remarks of the
speakers, to the echo.
Captain J. C. Macfarland outlined
to the candidates the method which
lie and Trainer Moulton will pur
sue this season. Macfarland said;
"Heretofore the track men have not
been supported as T believe they
should have been. We have struggled
under adverse conditions, and have
been hampered by a lack of spirit on
the part of those on the bleachers.
We expect something different this
season.
"I want to say to the men that
every one will be given a chance.
Rain 01* shine training will continue
without interruption. When the
weather is such that we cannot get
out on tlic track vvc will hold rallies
in the training house, where we will
develop spirit. But no matter who
the man is he will have a place on
the squad. We want every one to
come out, old men and new men. I
make an appeal especially for new
men.
"We will institute a system of han
dicaps whereby those who have not
received sufficient training will not
become discouraged. The handicaps
can be arranged as soon as we find
what the new men can do. The new
track is not at present in a condition
that will allow work upon it, hut we
can get out on the old track and do
good work.
"Training will begin Monday morn
ing. There is no need of saying any
thing about training rules. All know
what training means.
Meets will be held every Saturday
this season, thus giving all a chance
to compete. If competition will de
velop the men we will have plenty of
that."
Trainer "Dad" Moulton omitted his
usual stories and spoke seriously. He
said: "We want something new this
season. We will start out with a new
system, and we expect that the sys
tem will prove successful. Every
man will be given a tryout. and will
be allowed to enter any event. Tf
any man feels like going into any
contest he will be allowed to do so.
"I do not make an appeal to the
men here to go out for track alone.
Let every man get out for something.
I do not care whether a man has come
to Stanford with a record or not.
T would prefer that he came here
without previous training, so that
Stanford and T can have the benefit.
Our fall training was broken up last
semester. This could not be pre
vented. The Scholarship Committee

cost us 45 points, but this does not
mean that those points arc lost to
us. To overcome this loss T appeal
to the spirit of the old and new men
of Stanford to come out and try for
something, r do not especially care
for what they try. I call especially
on the new men.
Track events arc not like other
games. There is a lack of solidity,

and every man must depend, to a
certain extent, upon himself. If the
men will only come out and show a
willingness 1 will make something out
of them. Eight men can enter every
event, and if more could enter I
would give them the chance.
"Although we have lost some men,
and some good men at that, 1 believe
there will he others to take their

places."
Moulton closed with an appeal for
* reshmen and those who have not
tried before to get into athletics.
Dr. Frank Angell, the first speaker
at the rally, said that not enough in
terest had been taken in track. "A
spirit of criticism," he said, "existed
here as it did elsewhere." He de
