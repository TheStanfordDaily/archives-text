# Chinese Editor Scores Agitators.
## 
### 
One of the most interesting speak
ers who has appeared before a Stan
ford audience for some years, Dr. Ng
Poon Chew, editor of the Chinese
daily of San Francisco, addressed the
Social Service Club last evening, on
the subject of Oriental exclusion.
Dr. Chew gave briefly the Chinese
side of the question.
Speaking of the recent Japanese
agitation in San Francisco, Dr. Chew
said: "The foreigners in the city are
the ones who are responsible for the
ferment of public opinion. Put eight
men in prison and there would be no
more Japanese agitation. Two of
them are Mr. Tveitmoe, a Scandin
avian, and Walter Mac Arthur, who is
either an Irishman or a Scotchman.
The names of the others I do not
care to mention.
