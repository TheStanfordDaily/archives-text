# SEVENTY-SIX ANSWER FIRST CALL
## Coach Lanagan Outlines His Policy For Season Practice. Innovation In Conduct of Class Series. 
### 
The baseball season was formally
opened this afternoon, when Coach
J. F. Lanagan addressed all the pros
pective candidates for both the Var
sity and class teams, in room 50,
Quad. Seventy-six aspirants for dia
mond honors were assembled, and
from this large number the coach
should have ample material from
which to develop a winning team.
Particularly encouraging is the large
number of Freshmen 011 the roll.
Practice will he conducted on a
thoroughly revised basis this spring,
and Mr. Lanagan took pains to re
mind the squad the necessity for con
sistent and unrelenting practice.
The class series will be completely
subordinated to the development o
the Varsity nine, but more attention
will be paid to this feature of the
season than ever before. Batting,
not fielding, will decide the make-up
of the team which will meet Berkeley,
the coach declared, in emphatic
words. It was thoroughly evident
from the tone of his remarks that the
season would be one of work.
The scheme of class games for this
year differs from that of previous
years in that each class will meet
every other class in a preliminary
scries, matches between various class
teams and the Varsity and second
Varsity will be held. After a thor
ough tryout of all candidates in this
schedule from the record, which will
be kept throughout, those who have
shown the best form with the bat will
be segregated into various class
squads, and then some form of field
ing organization will be attempted.
Then will be played the regular se
ries as in the past, between the two
under and the two upper class teams,
the winner of each match playing the
final for the University championship.
The first practice will be held Mon
day afternoon, and from then on for
possibly six weeks the working out
of the class system will continue.
Contrary to the custom in the past,
even in the final series no varsity man
or member of the Varsity squad, will
be permitted to play. Out of a spirit
of fairness, and to give all an oppor
tunity to play this scheme will be em
ployed.
As will readily be seen, the object
of the whole system, as said before,
is to place the Varsity above inter
ference by the class teams, and at the
same time to give all who wish an
opportunity to take part in the sport.
The man who can hit the ball this
year will be on the Varsity rather
than the better fielder. The words of
Lanagan himself better explains his
plan, and the system whereby he will

determine both the Varsity and the
class nines.
"We will begin the season," said
he, "with the twelve men of last
year's Varsity squad, presuming that
they are better players than the other
candidates. The Varsity practice will,
in a way, be apart from the schedule
of the class squads, only in that occa
sional games will be played between
the first and second squads, and the
class players. Accurate record will
he kept of the hitting in all games,
and when a player, high or low, shows
a marked increase or decrease in his
hitting, he will be moved accordingly.
'Phe batteries will be chosen solely
according to their ability to fill their
positions. Work with the stick in
these places is not of prime import
ance."
Training has not commenced yet
and no date has been determined.
Lanagan is desirous of not making
the training season too long and, will
wait some time yet before setting a
day when rules shall be observed.
