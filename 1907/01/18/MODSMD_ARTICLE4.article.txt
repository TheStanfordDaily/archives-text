# Fence for Diamond Being Erected.
## 
### 
Portions of the fence surrounding
the old track have been removed and
are now being erectcd around the
baseball field. The fence will not en
tirely encircle the diamond, but will
extend about 300 feet along the first
and third base lines. Manager Sales
expects that this will be sufficient to
keep out all who do not pay admis
sion.
