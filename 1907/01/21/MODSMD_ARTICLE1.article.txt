# BASEBALL MEN OUT
## LANAGAN STARTS SQUAD ON LIGHT WORK. Veterans Form Separate Squad.â€”Class Series Under New System An Unknown Quantity. 
### 
The baseball season was opened 011
the old diamond this afternoon, when
a large squad of candidates was taken
in charge by Coach J. F. Lanagan, for
light hitting and fielding practice.
The first work-out, as usual, was not
at all hard, the practice for the first
few days being calculated to bring
the men into better physical shape,
and to get them accustomed once
more to the feel of glove and bat.
As he announced at the meeting
Friday as his policy, Lanagan took
the old men apart from the other
players at once, and the nucleus for
the first team was thus formed at
once. On this squad are Stott, Daily,
Theile, Goodell, Presley, Fenton,
Chalmers, Owen, Cadwalader, and
Dudley. .
The innovation in preparing for and
conducting the class series, bids fair
to upset the relative ability of the
class nines. Classes which formerly
were able to put strong aggregations
in the field v ' he addition of their
Varsity represent es, will now with
the new ruling a -h forbids the
playing of any Vars , man, have a
hard time to find material to form a
nine of any ability. However, it has
long been the declared wish of the
faculty, that more men be given the
opportunity to participate in student
athletics, and the coach had this in
mind as well as the furtherance of his
own scheme 'for developing the Var
sity, when lie outlined the new sys
tem.
