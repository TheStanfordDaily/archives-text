The January number of the "Se

Herron, '08, which will be put on sale
tomorrow, is to be the most sen
sational issue of the year.
The leading article, dealing with
the reconstruction of the University,
is written from an interview with
one of the Commission of Engineers,
and is illustrated by ten photographs
hitherto unpublished, taken by the
Commission.
The leading article takes up the
working system of the Business Of
fice, giving a thorough exposition of
the methods employed. Other inter
esting articles are "Some Needs of the
Palo Alto Students," by L. Newland,
'08, which describes some of the griev
ances and inconveniences under which
the Palo Alto students labor, and
grills the University authorities for
their refusal to put lights on the Ave
nue, and to establish an adequate sys
tem of transportation, and the second
article 011 the college woman, entitled
"Higher Education and Matrimony,"
in which statistics are given showing
the per cent, of college women who
marry.
The leading editorial attacks the
flunk-out system, in which the method
of dismissal from the University for
poor scholarship is characterized as
unjust, unnecessary and inexpedient.
Matrimony at Stanford, and the
grievances of Palo Alto students arc
also discussed.
