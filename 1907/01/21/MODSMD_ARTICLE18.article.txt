# MONEY OR ATTENDANCE.
## Sophomore Thespians Deposit Big Guarantee for Faithful Appearance at Rehearsals. 
### 
When tlie cast of Sophomores faces
the critical student body audience
early in March, in Bernard Shaw's
"You Never Can Tell," they will treat
the assemblage to a finished produc
tion or the class treasury will be fifty
dollars the wealthier. Money talks
with the 1909 play committee and
their energetic coach, Professor Gray,
and every time a member of the cast
fails to appear for rehearsal the sum
of fifty cents will be transferred from
his or her pocket-book onto the credit
side of the class treasurer's account.
And that is but half the story. The
star cannot delay putting in an ap
pearance until the critical moment for
the rendition of his lines. A quarter
of a dollar will change hands on such
a transaction.
Professor Gray is determined to
exact punctuality from his protegees,
and accordingly each has deposited
the sum of five dollars to guarantee
prompt and consistent attendance.
Fifty cents for a vacation; twenty
five only for tardiness!
