Editor '"Daily Palo Alto":
In answer to your editorial of Fri
day, I wish to say that the date for
the meeting of the Social Service
Club was fixed some time before it
was known that the rally would oc
cur the same night, and a conflict
could have been avoided only by a
postponement of the Club meeting.
A postponement had been considered,
but information came from official
sources that the rally would be ended
by about 8 o'clock. Neither a post
ponement nor a shifting of the hour
of the Club meeting were deemed
necessary, because, as a rule, the real
business of the evening meetings, like
those of the Social Service Club,
scheduled for 8 o'clock, docs not be
gin much before 8:30.
Relying upon the statement that the
rally would end by 8 o'clock, Dr. Ng
POOll Chew and 1 attended the rally
and heard the speeches, and so did
most of the men who attended the
Club meeting, and these include men
very prominent in athletics and in
student affairs.
With these facts before you now, I
think you will readily agree with me
in saying, that your criticism of the
Club was ill-timed.
