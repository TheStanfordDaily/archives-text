# CARNOT TEAM IS CHOSEN.
## Herron, McColloch and Shelton Will Meet California's Debaters In Annual Contest For Medal. 
### 
W. F. Herron, '08, C. C. McColloch,
'08, and W. C. Shelton, '08, will rep
resent Stanford in the annual Carnot
debate with the University of Cali
fornia, which will be held in Assem
bly Hall next month. L. M. Edwards,
'07, was chosen as alternate. Such,
in brief, was the result of the tryout
held in the chapel Saturday evening.
Seven candidates entered the con
test and the general excellence of the
debate rendered the task of selecting
the team far from an easy one. The
successful trio was picked by Profes
sor R. M. Alden, of the English de
partment, and Professors A. M. Cath
cart and W. N. Hohfeld, of the De
partment of Law. I. B. Cross, of the
Economics department, presided at
the meeting.
The question for debate, which Pro
fessors E. D. j .dams, of the History
department, and C. H. Huberich, of
the Department of Law, selected fron
the general Carnot subject, "Socialism
in the French Republic," was: "Re
solved, That the program of the So
cialist p'u y'Jn France tends toward
the political stability of the French
Republic." McColloch, Herron and
Shelton, upheld the affirmative side
of the question, while W. H. Tucker,
'07, F. A. Fisher, '07, L. Newland, '08,
and L. M. Edwards, '07, defended the
negative. Each speaker was allowed
fifteen minutes, divided into two
speeches as he chose.
The debate Saturday evening was a
real test of the ability of the speakers
for none of the candidates had ex
pected a question so general in its
nature, and they were compelled to
depend entirely on extemporaneous
argument. Herron impressed the
judges with his forceful delivery and
the conciseness and method of his

argument. McColloch possesses an
easy stage presence and an analytic
method of argument which coupled
witli his ability to weaken his oppon
ents' argument in rebuttal, easily won
a place on the team. Shelton was
chosen for his logical analysis of the
question and his convincing manner
of delivery. Edwards showed up well
in his rebuttal speech, which is his
strong point.
Herron has been prominent in de
bating and literary circles since his
i'reshman year. He was on the
Sophomore debating team last year
and also on both the Carnot and
Intercollegiate teams. He made the
"Sequoia" staff in his Freshman year
and is at present the editor of that
publication. He is a member of the
Euphronia Literary Society, and the
English and Press Clubs. He regis
ters from Telluride, Colorado, in the
History department.
McColloch was 011 his Freshman
team and an alternate on the Inter
collegiate last year. He is a member
of the Euphronia Literary Society,
and the Kappa Sigma fraternity, and
is, at present, the managing editor of
the"Daily Palo .Alto." He registers
from Portland, Oregon, in the De
partment of Law.
Shelton, who is also a member of
Euphronia, represented his class in
the interclass debate in his Sopho
more year. He is registered in the
Law department, from San Jose.

the Euphronia Literary Society, but
