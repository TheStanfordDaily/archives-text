# ATHLETES BEGIN WORK
## CANDIDATES FOR TRACK BEGIN LIGHT TRAINING. Warm Weather Starts Season Auspiciously.-Track Is Still a Trifle Hard. 
### 
The track athletes began their first
real work of the season yesterday and
today, over a hundred men taking
advantage of the warm weather to
loosen up their muscles with light
work. Old men and new crowded the
cinder path and the run-ways, and
under the supervision of Trainer
"Dad" Moulton, began the business
of developing a track team for the
season of 1907. All the candidates
did the lightest of training, confining
themselves to slow jogging on the
cinder path, a moment's practice over
a low bar, or a couple of turns in the
ring with the hammer.
Despite the recent heavy rains the
track appears a trifle hard, with the
exception of an inch or so upon the
surface, and this, especially for the
sprinters, wearing the longer spikes,
makes anything but the lightest of
preliminary working-out difficult. In
a day or so, however, which will be
in ample time for the first serious
work, the moisture, aided by the
warm sun, should soak down and put
the path in the finest possible condi
tion.
Both yesterday and today saw the
training house thronged with athletes,
an especially notable thing being the
number of varsity colors everywhere
visible. All of the old men are cau
tious in these first days of the sea
son. Nearly all are out, but so far
have contented themselves with little
light running to get their muscles fre<
again. None of the hurdlers hav
tried the sticks yet, and neither F.
R. Lanagan, '08, or R. A. Kocher, '08.
have had a vaulting pole in their
hands. E. J. Nash, '07, did consider
able training during the fall semester,
and is doing harder work at present
than any of the distance men. J. O.
Miller, '08, is out of the hospital and
is recovering rapidly from his opera
tion. He will begin training in about
two weeks.
Training rules are already in force
and the only stipulation which per
mits of any stretching at this end of
the season is the one which requires
the men to be in bed at it o'clock.
For the first two or three weeks the
men may stay up later than this hour
in case of examinations or other real
necessities.
