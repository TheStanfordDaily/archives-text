# WANT MEET AT BERKELEY.
## Edwards and Snedigar Hope to Hold Field Day at California. 
### 
Colonel G. C. Edwards, faculty ath
letic director of the University of Cal
ifornia. together with Graduate Man
ager O. F. Snedigar, visited the cam
pus yesterday afternoon. They are
desirous of holding the coming inter
collegiate track meet on the Berkeley
oval, instead of at Stanford, and it
was for the purpose of discussing this
that they were here yesterday. Dr.
.•Sngell, with whom they talked the
matter over, declined to say anything
as regards the proposed change, but
Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07, ex
pressed himself very forcefully, say
ing: "The track meet will be held
liCre or nowhere." This seems to be
the prevailing opinion 011 the cam
pus. It is difficult to see how it could
lie decided otherwise, as the Intercol
legiate agreement states that the meet
shall alternate between Stanford and
California, and the last meet was held
across the bay.
Of course, nothing was decided
yesterday, and it is thought that the
visit of the California representatives
was merely for the purpose of deter
mining how the Stanford delegates
felt about the matter, intending to act
accordingly at the meeting of the
Intercollegiate Agreement Committee
next Saturday night. Any plans they
may have entertained were shattered
jesterday, as the proposed change re
ceived the unqualified condemnation
of all the Stanford men concerned.
