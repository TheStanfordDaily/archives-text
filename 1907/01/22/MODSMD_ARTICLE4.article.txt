# FIRST PRACTICE FAST
## LANAGAN WORKS OUT MANY DIAMOND CANDIDATES. Owen and Cadwalader Played at Second and Short-stop In Varsity Infield. 
### 
No particular attempt to secure or
ganization was attempted by Coach
Lanagan at the opening baseball prac
tice last evening, more because of the
fact that the infield of the Varsity
squad is badly cut up owing to the
loss of Bell, '08, and Sampson, '09,
whose injured foot has not yet healed.
Stott and Daily took turns behind the
bat. Tlicile and Goodell alternated
in the box, Presley resumed his old
place at first, and Fenton covered the
third bag. Owen and Cadwalader
were substituted at second and short
stop to fill the vacancies there, and
Wirt and Dudley were the only ones
in the field.
While the first squad were occupy
ing the diamond the Freshman squad
of some 35 or 40, were put at the
west batting cage, and the other mem
bers of the large squad were put at
the other cage, where they alternated
at hitting and fielding.
Later in the afternoon Lanagan se
cured his first line on the first year
material when he brought several
teams into the infield and worked
them out for a short while. None
showed particular brilliancy, but sev
eral handled themselves well.
Sampson's foot is healing rapidly
and it is hoped that lie can get into
a suit in a week or so. Chalmers did
not appear last night, but the pre
vious report that lie would give up
baseball for rowing, seems to be with
out foundation as the veteran fielder
has declared his intention of again
denning a glove.
