# English Club Meets Wednesday.
## 
### 
At the meeting of the English Club,
to be held Wednesday evening, at the
Phi Gamma Delta house, Miss E. T.
Perley has consented to speak. Her
subject as announced, is "In the
Wordsworth Cottage." Miss Perley
was in England fourteen years ago,
and spent a number of months in the
Lake country, living a portion of the
time in the Wordsworth cottage,
which she restored as closely as poss
ible to its original appearance in the
days of the poet. Miss Perley is now
making her home on College Terrace,
where she moved late last autumn.
