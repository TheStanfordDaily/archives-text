# ADOPTS NEW SYSTEM
## MANDOLIN CLUB REORGANIZED LAST NIGHT. Endeavor Will Be Made to Develop Instead of Weeding Out Material. 
### 
Last evening the Mandolin Club
met and decided to continue work
this semester upon a different basis
than has heretofore been the custom.
Owing to the lack of good developed
material in college, it was deemed
best to dispense with the tryout sys
tem, by which the Club has usually
been recruited, rather than lower the
standard of the tryouts. This semes
ter, the Club will endeavor to remedy
the extraordinary state of affairs
which existed when out of nine hun
dred men in the University only about
seven or eight were able to qualify
in the second tryout last semester,
thus showing that they wefe up to the
standard of past Stanford clubs. The
organization will endeavor this se
mester to develop good material
rather than, as in the past, weed out
the poor. In this manner it is hoped,
that material may be developed for
a strong club next semester.
This plan was hit upon last week
and cards were sent out to all those
who made the preliminary tryout last
semester, asking them to come out
and help reorganize the club. As a
result twenty men attended the meet
ing last night. There a great
deal of interest displayed and the re
organization of the club was discussed
thoroughly. Eighteen men stated
definitely that they would come out
once a week for practice. This puts
the Club on a better basis even than
was hoped for, and there is every in
dication that some good work will
be done. , r
The Club will meet every Sunday
morning from ten to .twelve. ;\ pew
plan for procuring music for the Club
was discussed and will be carried out.
Formerly the music was picked and
ordered by one man. From now on
the selection of the music will be in
the hands of a committee of three.
The following men signified their
intention of coming out;
F. L. Coolidge, '07, C. A. Ferguson,
'07. R. B. Me Lain, '07, A. L. Taylor,
