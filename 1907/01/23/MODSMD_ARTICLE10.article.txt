The editorial in the January issue
of the "Sequoia," dealing with the
Scholarship Committee and the
"flunk-out" system, deals with a phase
of Stanford administration which has
too long been meekly accepted with
out comment or criticism by the stu
dent body. In general, Herron's ed
itorial is just and conservative, but
there is another phase of the Commit
tee's policy which works an injustice
fully as severe as any censured in the
"oequoia." The adoption of the final
examination system has led in man}
departments to the judgement of a
man's work solely on the basis of that
test. Class work and the preliminary
examinations stand for nothing be
side the paper which is turned in at
the conclusion of the two-hour final.
Thus it has become possible for a
man to pass all his mid-semester ex
aminations and still be sent out into
the cold, cold world at the end of the
semester. In several of the depart
ments—notably the Law department
—the classes are so large that indiv
idual work is impossible, and there
fore it is difficult for the student
form any very adequate idea of
his knowledge on the subject. He
goes into the final examination prac
tically ignorant of the extent of his
own knowledge. If he has done well
in the preliminary test he may feel
fairly confident, but in the final reck
oning this preliminary work plays no
part.
Again there are a hundred and one
external influences which may affect

a man's work in the final test. The
strain of the examination week is
no small thing. Yet upon the final
test depends that man's college ca
reer, and it may be to some extent,
his career in after life. It is small
wonder that the mortality in the Law
department, where the injustice <s
greatest, was heavier at Christmas,
among tlie upper classmen than 111
any other department. Furthermore
the Committee only makes use of a
man's past record, when that record
is bad. A Senior may go through
his three years with a clean account
to his credit, but let him fall down in
one-third of his work at the final test
of his seventh semester, and his good
record will avail him nothing.
