Two weeks after opening, the Inn
has 130 boarders, which looks very
promising for Shelton and his brother,
who is assisting him in the operation
of that institution. The general opin
ion seems to be that the food has
improved very much since the first
few days, and if this continues the
eating question is practically solved.
