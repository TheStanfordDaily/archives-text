# A
						MERRY QUAD FIGHT
## FIVE SOPHOMORES WOULD EDIT CLASS ANNUAL. Richardson, Telfer, Stafford, Griffith, and Miss Wells Are Candidates. 
### 
With five and possibly more candi
dates in tlie field, the contest for
editor of the 1909 "Quad" promises to
be one of the liveliest class political
fights seen on the campus in some
years. Electioneering has been in
progress for some time, and by the
time the polls are opened, presumably
early next month, the various candi
dates will have their following well
organized.
Those who have declared them
selves as ambitious to edit the annual
next year arc G. N. Richardson, of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity; W. J.
Telfer, Jr., of Encina Club; Miss L.
M. Wells, of the Alpha Phi sorority;
H. I. Stafford, of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity; and T. B. Griffiths, of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Competition for the position of
manager does not seem to be so keen,
D. W. Burbank, a member of the En
cina Club, being the only one whose
cause is being espoused openly at
present.
So many candidates in the race may
result in the interesting complication
of necessitating several elections, and
if the strength of the various con
testants is equally divided the elec
tion may develop into a sort of com
petitive tryout.
