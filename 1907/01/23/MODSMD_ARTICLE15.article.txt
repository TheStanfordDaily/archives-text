# WILL INSTRUCT DELEGATES
## Executive Committee Will Settle Stanford's Line of Procedure Tonight. 
### 
Tonight the Executive Committee
will meet to instruct Stanford's repre
sentatives on the Intercollegiate Ath
letic Committee â€”R. W Barrett, 04,
D. D. Sales, '06, and E. P. Stott, '07.
These three men will meet the rep
resentatives of the University of Cali
fornia at the Palace Hotel in San
I'rancisco, next Saturday, January 26
Jie conference will decide, if there is
110 deadlock between the men of tin
Cardinal and of the Blue and Gold,
the exact time and place of the Inter
collegiate track meet, the Intercol
legiate regatta, the game.-, of the base
hall series. The Intercollegiate agree
ment will be changed so as to make
provision for an eight-oared race be
tween the Varsity crews, and the size
of the Freshman crews will be settled.
The Intercollegiate agreement pro
vides that athletic and other contests
between the two universities are to
be held alternately 011 the college
campuses. As the last field meet was
in IQOS on the track at the University
of California, the coming event should
be here, but California has made and
is expected to continue to make ef
forts to have the meet run off this
spring 011 her own grounds. Track
captain Macfarland his expressed
himself as opposed to having any
meet at all if the California men in
sist on Berkeley as the place. The
argument of the California men is
based on the technicality that the
meets are to held on ihe respectivi
campuses in alternate years, and as
last year was Stanford's for the meet,
the contest should go to Berkeley this
year. But it is not expected that
Stanford will yield, and the probabil- j
it}- strong that the next Intercolle- 1
giate track meet will be held on the I
new Stanford cinder path.
