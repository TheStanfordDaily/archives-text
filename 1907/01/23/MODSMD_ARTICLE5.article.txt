# START ON NEW TRACK
## MOULTON HOPES TO CHANGE TRAINING QUARTERS. List of Candidates Reaches 144, Which Breaks All Records. Light Work Continues. 
### 
If the sun continues to shine the
rest of the week and the cinders for
the track arrive from the city, next
Monday will find men training on the
new track. Trainer Moulton is very
anxious to get his charges into the
new quarters. The present attaining
house is so overcrowded that only
with the greatest difficulty can the
men be accommodated, and no at
tempt can be made while there to
have regular rubbers provided for the
athletes. Besides this inconvenience
the old track and field is in rather
a run-down condition.
The track men continue rather light
work, although some of the old men
have varied the monotony of slow
jogging with a little fast work. P.
M. Davis, '08, in the first trial of the
year, finished a quarter in 54 seconds
flat, —fast time for preliminary work.
Nash, '07, who is training twice a day
for the present, swung several of the
distance candidates through a slow
mile yesterday, reaching out a little
in the last quarter.
The sprinters continue the lightest
of training, old men and new men
merely jogging to learn the feel of
the spikes or breaking slowly from
the mark. Holman, '09, and Vander
voort, '08, have both - begun work in
this event. On the field little is be
ing done, although a casual glaliee-at
several new men working out lightly
in the high-jump and hammer, shows
that several of the beginners handle
themselves cleanly and in good form.
"Dad" Moulton and Captain Mac
farland have decided on February
2, one week from Saturday, as the
date of the first field day. The meet
is to be a handicap affair and on ac
count of the short ti-me the men have
been in training the distances will
probably be shortened.
The list of candidates for track con
tinues to grow, 144 men now being
signed. This number is greater than
ever before in the history of track
at Stanford. The new signers are:
R. A. Kocher, '08, F. R. Lanagan, 08,
T. Vandervoort, '08, W. W. Behlow,
'07, G. E. Cheda, '10, J. O. Gossett,
'09, A. E. Hohl, '09, J. D. Mauser, 'io,
T. W. Halliday, '10, C. McGuire,
'10, A. M. Porter, '07, C. L. Roberts,
'10, L. Venatta, '10, and W. 11.
