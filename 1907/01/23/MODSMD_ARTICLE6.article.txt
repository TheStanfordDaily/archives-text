# New Shell Is On Its Way.
## 
### 
Word' lias been received from Bos
ton that the eight-oared shell has
been shipped to New York. There
was a delay owing to the fact that
the Metropolitan Steamship Co., after
having accepted the hoat as freight
at a rate of $25 to New York, after
wards refused to accept the shipment
for less than $65.00, which is consid
erably more than it will cost to ship
from New York to San Francisco.
The shell was forwarded however, by
Davey, the builder, and word is ex
pected at any time that the shell has
left New York. The Boat Club hopes
to land the shell here some time in
March.
