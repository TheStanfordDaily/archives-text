# PLAN JOINT CONCERT
## GIRLS' GLEE WILL APPEAR WITH ORCHESTRA. Womans' Organization Planning to Make Belmont Trip Which Is Scheduled for February. 
### 
The Girls' Glee Club, at a meeting
held last night, decided to accept the
invitation extended them, to take part
in the concert to be given by the Uni
versity Orchestra at Belmont, about
February 1.
Three years ago the club took an
active part in college musical enter
tainments, joining with the Men's
Glee and Mandolin Clubs in their
concerts given in Santa Cruz and
other neighboring towns. For the
last two years the interest has been
spasmodic, and the only chance the
University public had last year of
ascertaining the musical ability of the
Stanford women, was the concert
given February last by the combined
musical organizations.
Although the club has given no
public performances this year, prac
tice has been kept up, and with a few
rehearsals between now and the first
of February, the members feel con
fident that they can be fully prepared
for their numbers by then.
The members of the club are Miss
L. Ramsey, '07, Miss I. Zschokke, '07.
Miss S. Sankey, '07, Miss L. Millar,
'08, Miss H. Wilkins, '08, Miss H.
Gardner, '09, Miss M. Osgood, '09,
Miss L. R. Foster, '09, and Miss A.
Bradshaw, '10.
