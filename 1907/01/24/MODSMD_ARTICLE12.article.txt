The stand of Stanford's delegates
to the Intercollegiate Agreement Con
ference was defined by the instruc
tions of the Executive Committee
last night, in a way that seems to
fairly represent the wishes of the
Stanford Student Body. Of the
amendments submitted by the Uni
versity of California, three embody
radical changes in the Agreement.
The first advocates the barring of
I'reshmcn from participation in all
Varsity sports. This has lons bee:
a pet project of the wearers of the
Blue and Gold, and they have stead
ily fought for it at every meeting of
the Committee. There is absolutely
no good reason for the amendment,
and the instructions to the Stanford
representatives to throw out the
amendment by dead-locking 011 it, are
in conformance with the Cardinal pol
icy in past years. The second amend
ment, which aims to permit men, re
ceiving compensation from the Uni
versity for other than manual labor,
to compete, is too broad. There is
too much opportunity for proselyting
by the wholesale distribution of li
brary jobs and other similar sinecures.
On the other hand the present rule
bars men who have brains enough to
become instructors, from the privilege
of winning their Varsity emblems,
a he two committees should be able
to so revise this amendment as to
obviate both these difficulties. In the
form presented by California, how
ever, it should never be passed. The
creation of the proposed Football
Rules Board has been rendered a ne
cessity by the adoption of the Rugby
game. The personnel of the proposed
board could not he bettered, but it is
easy to imagine the result of an at
tempted rules revision when each
coach was fighting for an interpreta
tion of the rules to which his material

was best fitted. The presence of
strong alumni 011 the board will prob
ably tend to do away with any dead
lock and on the whole the change is
the best amendment submitted by the
California committee. Stanford will
propose but one important change in
the Agreement,â€”that advocating the
setting back one week of the Fresh
man and Varsity Football dates. It
is sufficient for the Stanford Student
Body that this change is sanctioned
and desired by Coach Lanagan and
the most influential football men.
Our training season has always been
some two or three weeks shorter than
California's, and we have consequently
been handicapped. As regards the
place for holding the track meet
there is not the slightest doubt. Cal
ifornia has not the shadow of a claim
to the meet 011 her track, and "Here
or Nowhere" may well become Stan
ford's watchword.
