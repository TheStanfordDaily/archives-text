# Tri-Delts Reported Chartered.
## 
### 
Persistent rumor has it that a char
ter of the Delta Delta Delta sorority,
better known as the "Tri-Delt," has
been granted to a group of women on
the campus, and while authorization
of the report cannot be had from any
one of the individuals supposed to be
involved, still the available facts
would seem to justify credence in the
rumor. Official announcement of the
granting of the charter has not been
made, and the supposed new initiates
into the fraternity world are peculi
arly uncommunicative, but it is con
sidered at least significant that they
will not enter a denial.
