# Miss Perley Talks to English Club.
## 
### 
The members of the English Club
listened last evening to a most inter
esting address by Miss Perley, 011 "A
Summer's Experience in the Words
worth Cottage near Ambleside."
Miss Perley's descriptions of her
life as a tenant of the little rude cot
tage which her favorite poet loved sc
well and which he mentions so feel
ingly in the early books of the "Pre
lude," gave her hearers a sense of
personal contact and interest in the
bard of the lovely Lake region, which
could have been obtained in no other
way.
