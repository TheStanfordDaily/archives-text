# NOMINATIONS ON TUESDAY.
## '09 Aspirants Find Strain Hard On Nerves.â€”Bruning Now in Field. 
### 
The Sophomore political pot will
be brought to the bubbling over
point next Tuesday afternoon when
President T. R. Cadwalader will call
a meeting of the class for the pur
pose of nominating candidates for
editor and manager of the 1909
"Quad."
11. F. Bruning, of the Sigma Alpha
Kpsilon fraternity, this morning took
the field as the sixth avowed candi
date for the position of editor.
The president of the class found the
importunities of six aspirants for a
nominating date too nerve racking
to permit of further delay and he de
cided to have the tension relieved as
early as possible.
The election will probably be held
as usual, a week from the day nomin
ations are made.
