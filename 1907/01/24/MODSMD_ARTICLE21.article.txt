# Golf Club Elects Officer.

### 
The University Golf Club met this
afternoon and elected R. Hornby, '07,
to the office of vice-president. The
report of the treasurer showed a cash
balance of about $40 at the beginning
of the semester. The growing inter
est in golf is evinced by the fact that
twenty new members have joined the
club in the last two weeks.
