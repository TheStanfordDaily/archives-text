# No Football Banquet This Year.
## 
### 
Owing to the heavy expense in
volved in sending the football team to
British Columbia, there will not be a
football banquet this year. The cus
tom of holding an annual banquet
after the Stanford-California game
bad become established, but the mem
bers of the team decided to forego
their "spread" in view of the fact of
the heavy expenses in the North. The
northern trip cost the Student Body
something more than $180, and Man
ager Sales, in whose decision the
team concurred, decided not to give
the banquet this year.
