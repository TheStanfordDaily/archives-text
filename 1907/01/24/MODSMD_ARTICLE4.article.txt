# INSTRUCTS STANFORD DELEGATES.
## Executive Committee Would Have Field Day Here.—Freshman Are to Remain Eligible.—Proposed Change In Football Dates. 
### 
The next Intercollegiate field day
between Stanford and the University
of California will he held on the new
cinder path 011 the Cardinal campus,
on Saturday, April 20. The Varsity
eights and sub-Varsity fours from the
two colleges will compete for the
rowing championship 011 Richardson's
Bay, near Sausalito, the size of the
Freshman crews and also the date
and exact time of day being left to
the discretion of the graduate man
agers. Freshmen will be allowed to
take part in intercollegiate athletics
and probably also undergraduates
who are departmental instructors or
assistants, and who have been in at
tendance at either California and
Stanford for two consecutive years.
The intercollegiate football events,
including the Varsity and Freshman
games, may be held a week later than
has been customary, and will be
played under rules decided on by a
committee from each university, com
posed of the captain of the football
team, the football coach, and an al
umnus. These arrangements are the
ideas of the Executive Committee as
expressed in meeting last night, when
Stanford's and California's proposed
amendments to the Intercollegiate
Agreement were considered and Stan
ford's delegates to the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee were in
structed.
In a letter dated Berkeley, January
tc>, the representatives of the Univer
sity of California to the Intercollegi
ate Agreement Committee, R. 11. Van
Sant, Jr., chairman, Everett Brown,
and O. F. Snedigar, gave notice of the
amendments to be proposed by them,
when the Committee meets next Sat
urday in San Francisco. The first
aemndment reads, "Beginning August
1, 1907. no Freshman shall be per

mitted to compete in any Varsity In
tercollegiate contest. (Freshman
standing to be defined)." This the
Executive Committee refused to
grant, it being the general opinion
that any bona fide student should be
allowed to compete in athletic events.
To balance the restriction which the
Blue and Gold wishes to put upon it
self, a motion is made to strike out
Section 10, Art. 11, of the Intercolle
giate agreement. This action would
have the effect of making any em
ployees of either University, excep
persons doing manual labor, eligible
for places on intercollegiate teams.
This the Executive Committee re
fused with a qualification which leaves
a. possible change to the discretion of
Stanford's representatives. The sec
ond amendment was accepted so that
the date and exact time of day for
the regatta will be left to the man
agers to settle.
The Executive Committee acqui
esced in the amendment concerning
the football situation. It gives a new
committee power over the rules of
the game, which is decided upon by
the University authorities and the
representatives of the student bodies.
This committee, whose members ari'
appointed, can change only the style
of play of the accepted kind of foot
ball. In the words of the amend
ment, it "shall have power to regulate
and interpret the rules governing foot
ball for the ensuing year. This com
mittee shall meet the first Saturday in
' March, beginning with March, 1907."
Stanford's only amendment was in
regard to the date of the Intercolle
j giate football games. The instruc
tions include the attitude on all
i amendments, on the time and place
of the track meet,, and on the size of
the Intercollegiate crews.
