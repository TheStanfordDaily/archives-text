When the class of 1906 established
the annual Sophomore comedy, they
intended that it should be the fir
dramatic event of the spring semes
ter, and they planned to have it oc
cur as soon after the opening o
college as was possible. To this end
most of the preliminary work of the
production was done before college
closed in December, and "David Gar
rick" was produced 011 the evening
of January 22.. Following the prec
edent thus established, 1907 gave
"The Rivals" on the 26tii of January.
Last spring 1908 was unable to carry
out the customary early production,
and did not stage "She Stoops to
Conquer" until the middle of Feb
ruary. 1 he results of this dangerott l
proceeding are apparent in the de
cision of the 1909 Play Committee
to produce its comedy during the firs
week in March. Their action will
work considerable injury to the Ju
nior farce, which is scheduled for the
customary date near the end of the
same month. With a Boat Club
show, and a German C'ub play both
under discussion for early production,
it scenic as though the March dram
atic calendar was sufficiently over
crowded without the addition of
1 on Never Can Tell." The commit
tee asserts in its own defense that
the number of those trying for the
cast, and the difficult play chosen for
production, have forced them into
setting so late a date. The commit

tee in question was appointed on Oc
tober 26. It has already had over
three months to attend to the pre
liminary details of production. In
this length of time all previous
Sophomore classes have managed to
choose, rehearse and finally stage
their plays. 1909 now asks for an
additional month in which to worl
up their comedy. Unless their ef
forts result in something far supe
rior to any class play that has ever
been produced at Stanford, their post
ponement has little justification. The
class of 1910 should profit by their
example, for a repetition of the post
ponement process will mean that the
Sophomore comedy will soon be pro
duced in commencement week.
