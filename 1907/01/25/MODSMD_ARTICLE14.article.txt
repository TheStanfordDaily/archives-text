# CINDERS STILL MISSING.
## Manager Sales Goes to City to Find Trace of Lost Car. 
### 
I he mystery surrounding the non- I
arrival of cinders for Stanford's new
running track is as yet not cleared
up. Efforts made to find the missing
carload which is to cover the track,
have proved unavailing. It was
thought that the cinders would he on
the campus about a month ago, but
up to a late hour this afternoon they
had not arrived.
Manager Sales left hurriedly for
the city yesterday with tracers to
find the missing goods. He is ex
pected to return to the campus to
night or tomorrow morning. Every
effort will be made by Sales to locate
the missing cinders. They are sup
posed to be stalled somewhere nc
the Pacific Mail dock.
