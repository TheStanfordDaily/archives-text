# SCORES FOR JUNIOR OPERA.
## Six or More Farce Manuscripts Are in the Course of Preparation. 
### 
i here are at least six scorcs being
prepared for submission to the Ju
nior Farce Committee on February
15. The offer of a substantial prize
has stirred an unusual number of au
thors and musicians into action, and
it is expected that from the manu
scripts submitted, the committee will
be able to select a suitable score for
production. The committee, how
ever, does not bind itself to accept
any of the compositions if they are
not deemed up to standard, and in
this case they will have a standard
light opera on hand so that there will
be 110 delay.
1 lie committee desires operas, but
farces will be acccptcd and examined.
Should an excellent farce be sub
mitted, it would probably be taken in
stead of using a standard opera, only,
however, in case the operas entered
in competition were not of good qual
ity.
