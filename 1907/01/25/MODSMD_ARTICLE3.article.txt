# NEW PLAN FOR TENNIS
## CLUB WILL REORGANIZE ON DIFFERENT LINES. Reform to Be Modelled After System Adopted By Boat Club Last Semester. 
### 
The first meeting of the semestei
of the University Tennis Club was
held last night, and the action taken
presages a great revival among the
racket wielders. It was the sense of
the gathering that the Club ought to
be reorganized, as the Boat Club was
a few months ago. In its present
shape the organization is extremely
weak and intangible. There is no
definite policy outlined, and power is
lacking to satisfactorily carry 011 thr
necessary business. If the proposed
change is ratified a new club will be
formed, having for a 'nucleus every
man who has made either a Varsity
or class team, and winners of the
Theile trophy, should the latter not
be included among the first. Besides
these the new organization will elect
to membership six or eight other
men, chosen from players who have
not made a team and from well
known, active men, who, though they
do not play, take a great interest in
the sport. In its new form the club
will have a well-developed policy and
would possess the power, which it
really ought to have. The whole
matter of reform will be fully dis
cussed and passed upon at the next
meeting of the tennis men, which will
be held 011 January 31.
It was dccided to amend the pres
ent constitution, so that the captain
of the Varsity team will hereafter be
elected by the men who participated
in the tryouts and not by the entire
membership of the club. The follow
ing committee was appointed to draw
up the amendment: C. G. Atwood.
'07, E. W. Borough, '08, and H. F.
Clark, '08.
C. G. Atwood, '07, P. B. Delano,
'08, J. E. Cushing, '08, H. F. Clark,
08, and A. J. Gowan, '09, composing
the tournament committee, will soon
announce the definite date for tin
beginning of the Varsity tryouts.
The first tournament will take place
about February 22.
'I he question of an interscholastic
tennis meet here, was informally dis
cussed. Tt would be impossible to
bold such a tournament this year, but
H. F. Brown, '08, R. B. Brackctt, '08.
and I'. B. Delano, 08, were appointed
a committee to inquire into the feas
ibility of the proposed innovation.
Active preparations are now being
made by the tennis men to provide
Stanford with a first-class court. Tt
is thought that the asphalt in front
of the gymnasium can be used, and
thus the expense would be greatly
reduced.
