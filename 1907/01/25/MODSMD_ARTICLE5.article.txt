# DATE SET FOR PLAY
## SOPHOMORES .AGREE. UPON MARCH 1. Rehearsals for Producing "You Never Can Tell" in Assembly Hall Well Under Way. 
### 
"You Never Can Tell," George
Bernard Shaw's subtle comedy of
modern English life, will be pre
sented by the Sophomore class in
Assembly Hall on Friday evening,
March 1. This matter and many de
tails were decided by the 1909 play
committee in a meeting held this af
ternoon. ihe only obf-tacle in th<
way of producing the play sooner is
that the difficulty of a Shaw play re
quires a great many rehearsals and
neither Professor Gray or the play
committee will allow the play to be
put on until they are confident that
it will be a decided success.
It was agreed this afternoon that
with the present number of rehears
als a week the cast can be sufficiently
trained by the first of March. P. C
Edwards, ex-'o6, was present at the
first practice held last Tuesday even
ing, and expressed his commendation
of the progress made by the cast un
der the coaching of Professor Gray.
J lie second act was repeated this af
ternoon. It was well done without
the aid pf books, the attempt to in
troduce action into the rendition of
the lines meeting the approval of the
coach and the members of the com
mittee.
