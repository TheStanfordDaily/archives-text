# ANGELL ON CHANGES
## CHAIRMAN OF FACULTY COMMITTEE GIVES VIEWS. Sees No Immediate Necessity Here for Proposed Rule Barring Freshmen. 
### 
Concerning the amendments to the
Intercollegiate agreement as pro
posed by California, Dr. Frank Ang
ell, chairman of the Faculty Athletic
Committee, said today: "In regard to
the Freshman eligibility proposition,
it seems to me the main reason for
bringing it forward is the academic
mortality at California. It is very
questionable if any such reason exists
at Stanford." This sentiment is prac
tically the same as that of the Exec
utive Committee, who instructed the
Stanford delegates to dead-lock any
motion in that direction.
Touching the question of the elegi
bility of instructors, Dr. Angell's
view coincided exactly with that of
the Executive Committee. "It is a
most desirable measure," he said,
"but it should be limited to those stu
dent assistants who are regular stu
dents and who are giving direct ac
ademic instruction. The present sys
tem of having those instructors re
sign just before the meet or game
takes place, is a farce."
Dr. Angell was inclined to look
with doubt upon the formation of
a Football Rules Committee. "What
I wish to see played is the pure, un
adulterated rules of the game we
select. A rules committee is much
inclined to jockey a game about until
only a remnant of the old style of
play is left. One of the advantages
of playing the pure English rules of
Rugby lies in the fact that we can
select All-California teams and play
international matches with the Can
adians or the Australians. This is
impossible if we have a Rules Com
mittee which manufactures a differ
ent game for Stanford and Californi
to play."
"The Canadian or, what is the
same thing, the English game," an
swered Dr. Angell, in response to th
question concerning what game he
wished to sec played at Stanford next
year. "The game the men played in
the North is the finest of games.
\\ hen wc started this season we did
not think that our players could
stand the grill of the game without
an occasional scrum in which to catch
their breath. But they played tin
fast game in British Columbia, and
with wonderful success. It is a much
faster and in every way a bettc
game, and will make the ideal inter
collegiate sport."
