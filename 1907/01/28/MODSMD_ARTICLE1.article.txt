# TRUSTEES TO BUILD NEW FIELDS.
## Appropriations for Athletics.—Dr. Jordan Granted Summer Leave.—Many Appointments Are Made. 
### 
An appropriation covering the cost of a new football field and a baseball
field, to be used in connection with the work of the gymnasium, was made
at the meeting of the Board of Trustees, held in San Francisco on Friday.
It was also arranged that Dr. Jordan should visit Australia and New Zea
land this summer and deliver a course of lectures at the University of Syd
ney. Further business included the granting of several leaves of absence,
the making of a number of appointments, and the granting of the request
of the Committee of the President's Conference of Young Women to plant
trees on the west side of Lasuen street.

The appropriation for the new ath
letic grounds is perhaps the most im
portant action in the matter of the
student body interests taken by the
Board. Such a field has been long
desired and advocated by the Faculty
Athletic Committee, in pursuance of
the policy to make athletics as gene
ral as possible at the University. If
will be used exclusively tor class and
inter-department games and for the
use of the college as a whole. "If
these fields are occupied to their full
est capacity," said Dr. Angell when
seen this afternoon, "others will be
constructed, and perhaps a basketball
and handball court will be added. It
is hoped to get the baseball field in
readiness for play in April unless rain
interferes, and to have the footbali
field ready by next semester." The
location of these new fields has not
yet been decided upon, but this is a
question which will probably be set
tled in the near future.
Summer Trip for Dr. Jordan.
Dr. Jordan's trip to Australia and
New Zealand is taken primarily in an
swer to an invitation to deliver a
course of lectures at the University
of Sydney, on the American Univers
ity System. Dr. Jordan will probably
leave in May, shortly after college
closes, and will be gone until the mid
dle of August, 'there is a possibility
that he will stop over in Honolulu and
at Samoa should time permit.
