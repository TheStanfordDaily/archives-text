## THIRTEEN HITS MADE OFF FRESHMAN PITCHERS. Teams Show Good Form In First Practice Game of the Season On Saturday. 
### 
The Varsity baseball squad crossed
bats with the Freshman squad Satur
day afternoon in a game of nine full
innings. The score was 11-0 in favor
of the Varsity, and while the fielding
was ragged 011 both sides, all the
players met the ball well and the
pitchers seemed in good trim for such
an early date.
Three pitchers and as many catch
ers were worked out in the first year
team, and the veterans had 110 diffi
culty in finding the curves of all.
Thirteen hits fell to the Varsity, and
while the Freshmen hit often and
hard they succeeded in placing but
two safe. A gratifying feature of the
practice in view of Coach Lanagan's
declared intention of developing a hit
ting team, was the tendency of the
Freshmen to stand up to the ball, and
had the diamond been faster no doubt
they would have succeeded in driving
more into safe territory.
A second game between the Seniors
and the Sophomores, was played late
in the afternoon, the final score stand
ing 7-5 in favor of the Seniors.
