# PLACE OF MEET NOT SETTLED.
## Each University Has Different Interpretation. — Rules Committees Authorized and Freshmen Are Still Eligible. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Athlctic Com
mittee met last Saturday night at the
Palace Hotel, in San Francisco, and
acted in accord with the ideas reeentl)
expressed by the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students, with
the exception that the place for the
track meet this spring is left to future
decision of the graduate managers,
owing to a difference of phrasing in
the copies of the intercollegiate agree
ment possessed by Stanford and the
University of California.
The agreement produced by the
California representatives was un
signed and read that the track meet
should be held annually and should
alternate as to years. It was the un
derstanding of the Stanford repre
sentatives that the intercollegiate
agreement read that the track meet
should alternate between the two uni
versities as to place, and rather than
go on record as having a deadlock
on the question of the place for the
track meet, the committee referrec
the matter of finding the correctly
worded agreement and interpreting its
clause in regard to the field day to
the two graduate managers.
Freshmen are still eligible to com
pete in intercollegiate contests, the
matter standing now as it did before
California's proposition to exclude
them from Varsity contests was ab
solutely refused by the Stanford del
egates, and no agreement was reached
beyond that provision, which now per
mits Freshmen to compete in inter
collegiate athletic events.
California wished to recoup herself
from the debarrment of Freshmen by
allowing all students who are in the
employ of either university, except
those doing manual labor, to compete
in athletic contests. Such a provi
sion in the intercollegiate agreement
would open the doors of amateurism
to a host of students working for pay
in either college. A great objection
to this concession to the Californi:
representatives is the fact that Cali
fornia has a large number of students
working for pay in her many labor
atories of the various department?
The proposed concession would allow
opportunity for California to support
a great number of athletes. The
Stanford representatives refused the
amendment.
A modification of the California
proposal was then put forward by
Stanford, to the effect that faculty as
sistants, who had been in attendance
as students at either university fo
two consecutive years, should be al
lowed to compete. This propositioi
received the sanction of the repre
sentatives of both univei sities.
It was decided that the intercolle
giate regatta should include a ract
between Varsity eights, and if the
graduate managers thought best, also
a race between Freshmen eights.
This matter will be brought before
Coach Murphy by Manager Sales, and
Stanford's attitude on the size of the
Freshman crew will probably depend
on whether the rowing coach can

conveniently develop two eights for
the intercollegiate regatta. The grad
uate managers will arrange the exact
time of day and the date when the
aquatic events are to be held. No
four-oared boats will compete unless
it is decided that the Freshman crew
be of such a size. The managers arc
to meet and make their decision by
March i. The committee decided
that after this year both Varsity and
x reshman crews shall consist of eight
men.
Stanford's proposition to hold the
Freshman and Varsity football games
a week later than has been customarj
was not accepted by the California
men These two contests will be held
at approximately the same time in
1907 as they were last year.
California succeeded in passing her
amendment for the establishment of a
football rules committee, which shall
have power to "regulate and interpret
the rules governing football for the
ensuing year." This committee will
not attempt to dictate whether Rugby
or Intercollegiate shall be played in
contests between California and Stan
ford. Its function will be to take the
rules of the game which has been
fixed 011 and make any "inprovemcni.
in their wording which seem gooci.
Incidentally the members of this com
mittee are to settle disouted meanings
of the rules. The committee will be
composed of the captain-elect of the
football team, the football coach and
an alumnus from each university.
The members are to appointed by the
presidents of the Associated Students
of the respective universities.
The men who participated in the
intercollegiate conference are: for
Stanford—R. W. Barrett, '04, D. D.
Sales, '06, E. P. Stott, '07; for Cali
fornia—O. F. Sncdigar, E. J. Brown,
R. H. Van Sant, Jr. Graduate Mana

conference and Manager Snedigar o
the University of California, secre

football rules committee, which shall
have power to "regulate and interpret
the rules governing football for the
ensuing year." This committee will
not attempt to dictate whether Rugby
or Intercollegiate shall be played in
contests between California and Stan
ford. Its function will be to take the
rules of the game which has been
fixed 011 and make any "inprovemcni.
in their wording which seem gooci.
Incidentally the members of this com
mittee are to settle disouted meanings
of the rules. The committee will be
composed of the captain-elect of the
football team, the football coach and
an alumnus from each university.
The members are to appointed by the
presidents of the Associated Students
of the respective universities.
The men who participated in the
intercollegiate conference are: for
Stanford—R. W. Barrett, '04, D. D.
Sales, '06, E. P. Stott, '07; for Cali
fornia—O. F. Sncdigar, E. J. Brown,
R. H. Van Sant, Jr. Graduate Mana
ger Sales was elected pres'dent of the
conference and Manager Snedigar o
the University of California, secre
tary. Snedigar will forward a copy
of the minutes of the conference to
Sales within a few days.
The Intercollegiate Athlctic Com
mittee met last Saturday night at the
Palace Hotel, in San Francisco, and
acted in accord with the ideas reeentl)
expressed by the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students, with
the exception that the place for the
track meet this spring is left to future
decision of the graduate managers,
owing to a difference of phrasing in
the copies of the intercollegiate agree
ment possessed by Stanford and the
University of California.
The agreement produced by the
California representatives was un
signed and read that the track meet
should be held annually and should
alternate as to years. It was the un
derstanding of the Stanford repre
sentatives that the intercollegiate
agreement read that the track meet
should alternate between the two uni
versities as to place, and rather than
go on record as having a deadlock
on the question of the place for the
track meet, the committee referrec
the matter of finding the correctly
worded agreement and interpreting its
clause in regard to the field day to
the two graduate managers.
Freshmen are still eligible to com
pete in intercollegiate contests, the
matter standing now as it did before
California's proposition to exclude
them from Varsity contests was ab
solutely refused by the Stanford del
egates, and no agreement was reached
beyond that provision, which now per
mits Freshmen to compete in inter
collegiate athletic events.
California wished to recoup herself
from the debarrment of Freshmen by
allowing all students who are in the
employ of either university, except
those doing manual labor, to compete
in athletic contests. Such a provi
sion in the intercollegiate agreement
would open the doors of amateurism
to a host of students working for pay
in either college. A great objection
to this concession to the Californi:
representatives is the fact that Cali
fornia has a large number of students
working for pay in her many labor
atories of the various department?
The proposed concession would allow
opportunity for California to support
a great number of athletes. The
Stanford representatives refused the
amendment.
A modification of the California
proposal was then put forward by
Stanford, to the effect that faculty as
sistants, who had been in attendance
as students at either university fo
two consecutive years, should be al
lowed to compete. This propositioi
received the sanction of the repre
sentatives of both univei sities.
It was decided that the intercolle
giate regatta should include a ract
between Varsity eights, and if the
graduate managers thought best, also
a race between Freshmen eights.
This matter will be brought before
Coach Murphy by Manager Sales, and
Stanford's attitude on the size of the
Freshman crew will probably depend
on whether the rowing coach can

conveniently develop two eights for
the intercollegiate regatta. The grad
uate managers will arrange the exact
time of day and the date when the
aquatic events are to be held. No
four-oared boats will compete unless
it is decided that the Freshman crew
be of such a size. The managers arc
to meet and make their decision by
March i. The committee decided
that after this year both Varsity and
x reshman crews shall consist of eight
men.
Stanford's proposition to hold the
Freshman and Varsity football games
a week later than has been customarj
was not accepted by the California
men These two contests will be held
at approximately the same time in
1907 as they were last year.
