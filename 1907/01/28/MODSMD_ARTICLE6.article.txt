The action of the Board of Trus
tees in appropriating funds for the
building of a new baseball and foot
ball field comes as a complete sur
prise to the Stanford student body.
Before the earthquake it was gener
ally understood that the Trustees
were planning to build a gigantic
play-ground for the use of the stu
dents at large, leaving the present
equipment for the Varsity teams.
After the catastrophe, however, then
seemed to be small hope for the real
ization of this plan in the immediate
future. The generous action of tlu
Trustees will therefore be doubly ap
preciated by the students. Due crcdi!
should be given to Dr. Frank Angell,
whose untiring efforts li. ve had much
to do with the success o< the plan.
