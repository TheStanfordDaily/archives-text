# TWO TRIPS FOR TEAM
## TRACK MEN PLAN MEET WITH OREGON. Macfarland Writes South Asking for Contest With All-Star Team.â€” Sprinters Try Starting. 
### 
If the present plans of Graduate-
Manager S;iles and Track-Captain
Macfarland are carried out, Stanford*
will hold meets this year with the
crack athletes of both the North and
the South. Oregon has written for
a post-season contest, and has guar
anteed $500 expenses if the Cardinal
track men will come North and com
pete any time after the annual inter
collegiate event with the University of
California. Some time ago Sales
wrote to Coach Holmes, of the Uni
versity of Southern California, asking
for a meet against an all-star South
ern team, to be held in L,os Angeles
about the sixth of April. No answer
has as yet been received, and a second
letter from Macfarland is now on its
way in furtherance of the same pian
"We could not go to Oregon during
the regular season," said Macfarland
today, "because as "Dad" Moulton
says, the trip is too long and hard on
the men, coming as it would have to,
right before the big event with Cali
fornia. But we can go there after the
intercollegiate contest; give the men 1
pleasant trip South, and a fine meet
with an All-Southern California team,
which will serve to break up the
monotony of the regular training.''
The back-stretch of the track has
dried out sufficiently to permit the
first pistol-practice of the season, and
for about two hours yesterday Moul
ton sent old and new men away from
the mark and allowed them about
twenty yards hard sprinting. The
experienced men were fairly steady
and got away in good style for such
early work. None of the new sprint
ers showed any great speed, and when
sent away with the older men the
Cardinal jerseys swung easily in front.
McNeil, Vandervoort, .Edwards, and
Macfarland, appeared to be the stead
iest and fastest in this first work-out
