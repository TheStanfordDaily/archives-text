# NOMINATE FOR "QUAD"
## SOPHOMORES HOLD AN EXCITING MEETING. Five Nominations for Editor of the Year Book Made, and Two for Manager. 
### 
Not a ripple disturbed the serenity
of the meeting of the Sophomores
this afternoon despite the fact that
some political jockeying unique ii
class gatherings was e cpected over
the point as to the manner in which
the election should he conducted
President T. R. Cadwalader took fo.
his slogan "the wishes of tlie candi
dates," and the class amiably chimed
in. Everything had apparently been
settled previous to the meeting by the
host of candidates themselves, and the
class members seemed to be totally
indifferent as to whether majority,
plurality or a landslide decided the
outcome of the vote, just so there was
an election. Interest was at a high
pitch, r ully 250 second year men
and women were present and the larg
est room on the Quad was far from
sufficient to accommoda' he-r
-ing.
Five nominations were made for
editor and two for manager, and as
usual, there was a notable scramble
for the first place 011 the ballot. D.
P. Crawford secured recognition first,
and he put the name of G. N. Richard
son before the class. A. L. Kocher
named W. J. Telfer. V. C. McCol
lough followed with tlie name of Miss
Laura Wells. E. E. Young did like
service for H. F. Bruning, and E. B.
Nelson announced the candidacy of
1. B. Griffiths. For manager of the
year book, S. C. Bias was named by A.
L. Johnson, and W. Burcham nomi
nated D. W. Burbank.
1 lien followed the disposition of the
method of .holding the election. Pres
ident Cadwalader announced that the
candidates had yesterday agreed that
a majority vote would be necessary
to elect in any event; that in case of
six contestants the two low ones drop
out until a majority be secured, with
five or less in the field that but one
drop out each time. Tr.e silence of
the class gave consent to this propo
sition and the formality of setting the
election for one week thence was
gone through with by motion. Ad
journment broke the spell.
But there was no excitement. The
campaign was too old for that.
