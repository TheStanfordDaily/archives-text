# California May Bar Freshmen.
## 
### 
There is strong evidence to support
the rumor, prevalent on the campus,
that the California faculty will bar
their Freshmen from intercollegiate
contests in the future. The situation
here is very uncertain, but as yet the
Faculty Athletic Committee has ta
ken no action in the matter, and it
cannot he found that they contem
plate the disbarment of first year men.
