The 1905 amendments to the Inter
collegiate Agreement, which state in
substance that the track meet shall
alternate annually between the two
universities, seem to be the basis for
California's claim to the meet this
year. Read strictly according to th"
letter they may appear to support
such a contention, although it is hard
to sec how the meets have alternated
annually when none was held last
year. The framers of the amend
ments evidently did not contemplate
the dropping of the 1906 meet from
the calendar of intercollegiate sports
Undoubtedly in spirit, the ruling was
never intended to allow one univer
sity to hold two meets in succession
upon its campus. Each was fo be
given its turn, and only the failure to
recognize the possibility of postpone
ment caused the framers to set forth
the amendment in such ambiguous
terms. The attempt to settle the con
troversy on the basis of any amend
ments now in existence seems foolish,
however, when it is considered that
the two universities are endeavorinj
to adjust the matter by interpreting
certain rulings which make absolutely
110 provision for what actually occur
red. The place of the 1907 meet
should be settled by a new amend
ment which will leave no cause fo
dispute and bitter feeling in years '
come.
