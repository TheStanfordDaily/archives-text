# TO BETTER CROSSINGS
## CONFERENCE WILL INVESTIGATE MUDDY STREETS. Nothing Definite Done at Last Night’s Meeting.—Scholarship System Thoroughly Discussed. 
### 
About the only important actioi
taken by the President's Conference
last night was to appoint a committee
to attend to improving the muddy
crossings on the campus. C. L.
Spaulding, '07, B. S. Morrow, '07, and
L. R. Gay, '08, are the men appointed
for this duty. B. S. Allen, 07, chair
man of the committee to investigate
the feasibility of turning the Inn into
a headquarters for student activities,
reported that an investigation had
been made, but that 011 account ol
the Inn being used as an eating place
this semester, a more thorough in
vestigation of the scheme had been
postponed.
The Conference decided that the
proposed men's organization in Palo
Alto should have a representative
from this time forward. President
Jordan announced that he had good
reason to believe that Dr. Abbott,
head of the Law department, now
absent in the East 011 leave, would re
turn next fall. The equipment of that
department will be greatly improved
and a new full professorship created.
A discussion of the present method
of suspension and expulsion from the
University for poor scholarship was
held, but nothing definite in the waj
of opinion or policy was decided upon.
