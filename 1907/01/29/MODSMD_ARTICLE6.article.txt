# Cost of Bleachers Almost Doubled.
## 
### 
From present indications the liigh
price of labor and lumber will raise
the cost of construction of the bleach
ers for the new track to a sum almost
the double proportionately of that
paid last fall for the building of the
Stanford Field scats. The estimated
price of the new structure per seat is
about one dollar and thirty cents, as
against seventy cents paid for the
Stanford Field work.
