At the meeting of the Intercollegi
ate Athletic Agreement Committee
last Saturday the Stanford delegates
insisted 011 holding the coming track
meet 011 the Stanford oval because of
the wording of the Intercollegiate
Agreement of 1900. The California
representatives were equally deter
mined that the meet should take place
011 their campus. They based their
contention on the amendments to the
1900 agreement, made in 1905.
The article in question, of the com
pact of 1900 is as follows: "The field
day in 1900 shall be held at Stanford
University 011 April 21st, and there
after alternate as to place between
the two universities." But the 1905
amendment runs thus: ' ihe Varsity
track and field contests in 1905 shall
be played on the California campus,
and shall annually alternate there
after between the two universities."
Another article, worded exactly the
same, provides the place of the Fresh
