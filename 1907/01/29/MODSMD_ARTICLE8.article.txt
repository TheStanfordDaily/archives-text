### 
Circumstances have forced the Ten
nis Club to schedule its next meeting
for Wednesday evening, instead of
'1 hursday, as previously announced.
At this time the matter of reorganiza
tion will be voted upon. It will be
impossible for the tournament com
mittee to take any action before the
coming meeting, so the date of the
tryouts will not be decided until the
early part of next week. The clu!
will meet in room n, at 7:15.
