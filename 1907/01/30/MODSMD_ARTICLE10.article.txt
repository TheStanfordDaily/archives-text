# History Building Being Repaired.
## 
### 
The work of reconstructing the
History and English building was
started this week. The hoisting en
gine was moved into the quadrangk
and the work of taking down the reai
walls and repairing them will begin
at once. The building was badly
damaged in places by the earthquake,
and since that time the rooms in the
rear of the building, including several
of the professors' offices have been
closed. Most of the buildings out
side of the quadrangle have either
been wrecked or arc nearitig com
pletion and considerable work will
now be done 011 the outer quad.
