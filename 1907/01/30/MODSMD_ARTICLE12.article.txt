The President's Conference is to
be congratulated on havr.g taken the
first step toward the betterment of
the campus street crossings. The ac
tual work of repairing and installing
the crossings will probably be com
pleted about the time that the rainy
season is over, but future generations
at least, will profit by the improve
ment. The Conference has also
wrought other notable internal im
provements for the benefit of the
present student body. Through it ,
efforts the necessity for lighting Uni
versity Avenue was called to the at
tention of the Trustees, and it is un
derstood that one side 01 the Avenue
will be equipped with lights as soon
as the Board is able to complete the
details of the scheme.
