The Executive Committee, at its
meeting tonight, will probably discuss
Stanford's attitude on the question o:
the place for holding the intercolle
giate track meet this year. From
the present status of the controversy,
each University has a good claim to
the meet, interpreting according to
the letter of the Agreement. Consid
ering only the spirit of the disputed
amendment, however, Stanford has
by far the strongest claim. The Car
dinal has yielded every point in dis
pute for many seasons past, until the
Blue and Gold has come to regard
every controversy settled in their fa
vor before it is begun. Stanford
should fight the holding of the track
meet on the California cinder path
to the last ditch. We have taken our
position and we must stand by it.
