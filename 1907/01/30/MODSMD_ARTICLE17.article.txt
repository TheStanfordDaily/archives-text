# WILL FIGHT FOR MEET HERE.
## Executive Committee to Take Decided Stand on Question at Its Meeting Tonight. 
### 
A majority of the members of the
Executive Committee have expressed
the opinion that tonight in its weekh
meeting, the committee will vote for
a light to a finish on the question of
the place for the next track meet.
Seven of the ten members of tlu
committee have been interviewed and
it is generally understood that tlu
remainder share their views.
Manager Sales, who, it was agreed
by the Intercollegiate Athletic Com
mittee, is to settle the question of the
meet with Manager Snedigar of the
University of California, said this af
ternoon that the Executive Commit
tee will take definite action this even
ing. "I will probably go to Berkeley
tomorrow and make final settlement
of the matter with Snedigar," tells
how Sales feels about it. The words
of the members of the Executive
Committee express their sentiment
that a decided stand is to be taken,
and quickly.
The matter of granting German S
sweaters to the substitutes for the
Varsity baseball team will be con
sidered this evening. This method
of rewarding the substitute baseball
men was suggested last week. The
executive Committee will probably
act favorably on granting these sweat
ers, with certain restrictions on the
number awarded.
All the amendments to the Intercol
legiate Agreement passed by the Ath
letic Conference will probably receive
the sanction of the Executive Com
mittee.
