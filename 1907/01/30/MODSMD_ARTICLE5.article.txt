# URGES MEN TO ENTER POLITICS.
## Existing Corruption Will Ruin the State Unless College Men Intervene. â€” Pardee Says Faculty Lacks Interest In State Affairs. 
### 
Ex-Governor George C. Pardee, in
a stirring speech before the students
in Assembly Hall this morning, not
only urged Stanford men to mingle
in politics in an effort to cleanse the
State of political mud and mire, but
incidentally criticised the entire fac
ulty for its lack of participation in the
affairs of state. Pardee did not in
elude the faculty alone iti his arraign
ment of representative men, but took
this incident as showing the lethargy
of men high up in business and edu
cational lines instate and national
politics.
"I believe the members of the fac
ulty are doing their duty better than
the average citizen," said Pardee, "yet
when it comes to politics the mem
bers of the faculty from Dr. Jordan
down, are neglecting their duty to the
State." In his speech he not only
condemned the action;, of those
elected to the Legislature, but others
in like responsible positions. The
blame for such corruption and will
ful disregard of the peo; le's interests
was due as much, he said to the lack
of interest of citizens in nominating
incorruptible men as it was to the
ring politicians, who put their satel
lites before the people for electron.
The gist of his entire speech, how
ever, was not the corrupt politics of
the state and nation but the urgent
need of university graduates of Cali
fornia and especially Stanford to take
an active interest in political affairs.
He told of the efforts of the state
in promoting higher education by
large appropriations ana exemption
from taxes of the large institutions,
and said that in return for the bene
fits secured by the students and grac l
uates it was their duty to repay in
part their debt by purifying the politi
cal horizon.
"I assume," he said, 'that we all
love our country. I assume also that
we are willing to fight our country's
battles. Most of us have as much
love for our country now as during
the time of the Revolution, the Civil
War, and the Spanish-American
War. Rut few love it well enough
to bear the burdens of si ate in times
of peace. Our duty in war is mani
fest, but more important is our duty
at the polls. The battles on the field
are greater than the battles at the
polls. There our very liberty is at
stake." With this as a prelude he ex
horted students of Stanford to enter
the field, not seeking offce themselves,
"God forbid this," lie said, but to put
acceptable candidates before the peo
ple. "But if you. do enter politics,"

lie continued, "go in with all your
might, clear up to the handle. Tlu
plea made by the business man an<
members of the professions is that
they cannot afford the time to devote
to politics. If 1 had my way I would
force, willy nilly, every preacher, pro
fessor, lawyer, doctor, and graduate
of a university, into the politics of
the country, the state, and the nation.
No man's private business is as im
portant to the individual as is the
business of the state upon which al
private business depends Your busi
ness is to have business in the conn
cils of the city, state and nation."
He said it was not necessary for
one to lose his self respect by enter
ing politics, and cited as an example
such men as Ex-Mayor Phelan, of
San Francisco. "My duty," he said,
"is to mix in politics by the eternal
gods, as long as blood in my
body or hair on my held. J have a
great deal at stake in the politics o
the state, as every one else should
have if he is interested in his coun
try.
"I hope the men of Stanford will
do their part to save the state anc'
nation, and will take as much activc
interest in these things in times of
peace as in times of war. 1 have a
kind of sneaking respect for such
traitors as Arnold, who betrayed hi
country in time of war, but I have no
respect whatever for the man who be
trays his country in time of peace.
But this is being done every day, for
the reason that the dear people are
willing to be robbed.
"If corruption continues to fastei
itself upon the vitals of the country
we arc doomed. If you love Stan
ford as I love California, you will do
your part to prevent the liberties of
the American people from being ta
ken from them."
Preceding the speech by Pardee,
the Glee Club gave a selection, am
it was followed by Dr. D. C. Gardner,
who made an appeal to the student
for donations to the Gerdes fund
The alumni and the faculty have
raised $800 towards paying off the
mortgage on the Gerdes home. The
mortgagees are willing to deduct $ioc
from the debt, if the bah nee to make
U P $ T 550 can be raised. There is
needed $650 to complete the fund.
Dr. Gardner made an appeal to the
men and women to raise this sum.
The Orchestra made its first ap
pearance in Assembly Hall for the
semester. Tt furnished an accom
paniment to "Hail Stanford Hail."
The assembly was well attended.
