It seems as though those who ar
range tlic program for the University
Assemblies should treat the musical
organizations who arc invited to par
ticipate, with more courtesy. At yes
terday's gathering the Orchestra and
Glee Club were requested to appear.
They were assigned to no definite
place on the program but it was un
derstood by them that they were to
play and sing in the intermissions
between the speeches. Evidently
neither Dr. Jordan nor the yell lead
ers had been apprised of this and as
a result, the Orchestra was allowed
to play only the accompaniment to

"Hail, Stanford, Hail," and to furnish
music for the crowd as it was leaving
Assembly Hall. Similarly the place
for the appearance of the Glee Club
was changed three times, and when
the Club was finally called for, it was
utterly unprepared for the summons.
The musical organizations have been
frequently criticised for their non
appearance at these gatherings, and
when they are asked to take part they
should be given some opportunity
to play or sing as the case may be.
