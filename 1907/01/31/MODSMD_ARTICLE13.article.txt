# LAKE NEARLY FILLED
## SEVENTY MEN NOW WORKING UNDER MURPHY. Boat Club Making Inquiries as to Whether Eight Has Left New York. 
### 
The recent rains have aided mater
ially in tilling the lake, and in a few
days the water will have reached the
depth desired by the boating men.
Coach Murphy now has about seventy
men at work and is beginning to get
a line 011 the Freshman material,
which is showing up unusually well.
The majority of the men are working
on the machines, but in a short time
the barge and shell will be in readi
ness for use.
The work for the season will then
be in full swing and Murphy will be
able to begin selecting the best men
of the squad and start them in 011
the hard work of the season. The
men will probably work 011 the lake
for six weeks or more, and if by that
time the eight has not arrived from
the East, the boats will be taken back
to Redwood in order to give the men
the long rows which it is impossible
to take on the lake.
Meanwhile the boat-house at Red
wood, which was damaged in the re
cent storm, will be repaired and
lengthened to accommodate the eight,
which is about 60 feet long.
No word has been received from the
East further than that the shell was
shipped from Boston nearly two
weeks ago. Inquiries are now being
made to ascertain whether or not the
shell has left New York.
