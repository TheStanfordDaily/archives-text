# "You Never Can Tell" for Sale.

### 
Twenty copies of "You Never Can
Tell," ordered from London by the
Sophomore Play Committee, arrive<
unexpectedly this morning. Inas
much as the committee made later
arrangements for play books, these
copies arc not needed. They are the
latest edition of Shaw's play, having
been published last year. The 1909
committee has placed them on sale at
the University Bookstore.
