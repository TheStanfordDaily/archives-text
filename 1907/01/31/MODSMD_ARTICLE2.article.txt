M. E. Harrison, '08, S. McNeil, '08,
and E. M. Peixotto, 07, are the men
who constitute the California team,
with F. L. Bordon, '09, as alternate.
Harrison was on California's Carnot
team in 1905. McNeil recently won
the prize in the Bonnheim discussion.
Peixotto, though a new man in de
bating, is well posted on the subject
of French Socialism. The California
rooters will attend the debate in a
body, coming down on a special train.
The trophy for which the debaters
will contest was offered by Baron dc
Coubertin in honor of Sadi Carnot,
president of France, with the provi
sion that the subject for debate should
always refer to some plan or policy
of the French government. The
award is made entirely on the work
of the individual speaker, each con
testant being allowed fifteen minutes,
to be divided into two speeches as
he chooses, provided neither speech
is shorter than four minutes.
The Stanford rooters will assemble
011 the right side of the Hall.
