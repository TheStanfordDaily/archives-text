# MEET MUST BE HERE
## COMMITTEE WILL NOT SANCTION ACTION. Intercollegiate Committee Expected to Meet Again.â€”Stanford in Favor of Arbitration. 
### 
"The track meet must be here" was
the unanimous action of the members
of the Executive Committee last
night. As the matter now stands,
another attempt will be made by the
representatives of Stanford on the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee to
secure the agreement of the Califor
nia delegates that the annual meet be
held on the Stanford track. The Ex
ecutive Committee refused to sanc
tion the action of the Intercollegiate
Athletic Committee as regards decid
ing the place of holding the meet.
This step takes the issue out of the
hands of the graduate managers.
Secretary C. R. Crider, '07, was in
structed to notify the secretary of the
Associated Students of the University
of California of the stand taken by
Stanford, and suggest February 9 as
the date for another meeting of the
Intercollegiate Conference.
At this conference a tentative plan
will probably be submitted by the
Stanford delegates, to refer the ques
tion to an arbitration board of un
biased university alumni in San Fran
cisco, such as decided the famous
case of the professionalism of Warren
Smith, the California half-back of
1902. Stanford will abide by the de
cision of such a board, but should
California refuse to submit the matter
to arbitration, the Executive Commit
tee will not let the meet go to Berk
eley on the. unsettled claim of the
Blue and Gold. Instructions will be
given the Stanford delegates by the
Executive Committee next week.
Manager Sales started the discus
sion by stating the legal point of view
of the merits of the case. Sales said
that a court of law would be com
pelled to interpret the wording of the
clause governing the field meet in
favor of a contest on the Berkeley
cinder path this year; but a court of
equity would undoubtedly render a
higher decision, awarding the field
day to the Stanford campus. The
advisability of placing the matter be
fore a board of arbitration was dis
cussed. and a motion was passed,
bringing the affair to its present stat
us.
Final action on granting German S
sweaters to substitutes on the Var
sity baseball team was deferred until
next meeting. Discussion of the pro
posed award of emblems brought out
the fact that the general opinion of
the Executive Committee is in favor
of granting a limited number of these
sweaters, approximately five, at the
end of the baseball season. It was
proposed that the substitutes should
1 be given their emblems 011 the rec
j ommendation of Coach Lanagan.
Bills aggregating over $1,000 were
presented by Manager Sales, and
approved. Sales reported that he
had turned over to Dr. Angell, chair
man of the Board of Control, $1,000
from the gross receipts of the Var
