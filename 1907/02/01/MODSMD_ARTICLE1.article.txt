# ATHLETES TO COMPETE
## FIRST MEET OF SEASON TOMORROW MORNING. Handicaps Will Make Finishes Close and Uncertain.â€”Distances Will be Shortened. 
### 
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
the athletes who have been working
011 cinder path and field will meet in
competition for the first time this
year. While the weather appears
threatening, "We shall have a meet if
it is at all feasible," is the sentiment
of both Track-Captain Macfarland
and ''Dad" Moulton, and if the track
is not a sea of mud the meet will be
run.
The short time the men have been
in training, together with the handi
cap of poor weather will undoubtedly
make this first clash of the candidates
an uncertain affair, but the handicaps
and shortened distances should meet
this in a way, by making the fin
ishes close and exciting, as well as
uncertain. Each event has a large
entry list, the season is yet so young
that no accurate line can be obtained
on the ability of the Freshmen, and
what sort of form and condition the
old men are in is a gamble, so the
winners in the various events tomor
row are as liable to be unheard of
as they are to be men wearing the
varsity emblem.
The sprints should provide close
finishes. In both the hundred and
the shortened two-twenty three heats
will be run with the final. Holman,
Gardner, and Roth, will be the scratch
men in each of these events. The
first heat especially, with Holman,
McNeil, and Vandervoort, should be
one of the best races of the day.
With twenty-four entries in the 300-
yard dash, and handicaps varying
from three to seven yards, the race
should be a pretty one. McNeil and
Davis, the scratch men, will have
their work cut out for them if they
are to fight their way through such a
large field.
With Severy in the 600 yards run,
even though at scratch and with sev
eral large handicaps against him, any
one of the field will have difficulty
in breaking the tape before him.
Maundrell, the Freshman miler, has
been placed at scratch in the three
lap event, and with the exception o'
Worthington and Bradford, the men
running against him arc unknown 011
the Stanford track. Nash is in fair
condition and should take the short
ened two-mile, although either Mor
rell or Fergusson may find his handi
cap sufficient to bring them home
before him.
The high and low hurdles will un
doubtedly bring out the prettiest
races of the day. The men will al 1
run from scratch, and from the work
done this season it is evident that
both contests will be fast and inter
esting.
The field events arc more than un
certain, as few have been working-out
to any extent with hammer or shot
and in the broad and high jumps, and
pole vault, very little has been done.
