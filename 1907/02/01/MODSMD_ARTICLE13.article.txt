The arrival of the long-delayed cin
ders means that at last there is some
chance for the completion of the new
track within the course of the next
six weeks. The prolonged search for
the cinders and the innumerable de
lays in their shipment after they had
been reported found, led the student
body to almost doubt their very ex
istence, and kept Trainer Moulton and
Captain Macfarland continually wor
ried as to the chances for the comple
tion of the new track. Now that they,
have really come, there is no excuse
I
for any further delay in the work, un- j
less a long-continued spell of bad j
weather intervenes. We want the
new track almost as badly for the ;
Tnterscholastic as we do for the Inter- j
collegiate. The old Training House j
Corporation demonstrated what it |
could do in the building of bleachers
when the seats around Stanford Field
were rushed to completion in record
time. There is, therefore, no cause
for apprehension that its successor,
the Board of Control, which is com
posed of the same men, will not have
the new track bleachers in shape by
March 23.
