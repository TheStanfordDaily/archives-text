\\ hilc the Tenuis Club is reforming
itself, it would be well for the men
who are directing it, to inquire into
the practicability of a change in the
present system of tryouts for th<;
Varsity team. Under the arrange
ment which has obtained in past year*,
the racket wiclders who meet Hie
Blue and Gold are selected by a series
of tournaments held in the spring
semester. The men who were mem
bers of the Varsity team of the pre
ceding year do not play through the
preliminary tournaments, but entet
only the round robin which is played

for the final selection of Cardinal rep
resentatives. It has been a Stanford
tradition almost amounting to an ur.
written law, that in the selection of a
Varsity team every man from the
captain down shall go through all ibe
preliminary work and shall have an
equal chance for his place on the
team. The present system of tennis
tryouts hardly seems to conform to
that law. The new aspirants 01* the
old aspirants who have failed to make
good the year before, are forced to
play through two long tournaments
while last year's team enters only
with the pick of the candidates i'l a
final round robin tryout. If there is
any good way of remedying this the
Club should undertake to do so, 111
order to place the selection of the
tennis team upon the same basis as?
that of the other teams to whom r !ic
Varsity emblem is awarded.
