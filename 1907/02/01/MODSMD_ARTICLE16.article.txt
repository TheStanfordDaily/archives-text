# CHESS TRYOUTS START SOON.
## Only Three Members of Last Year's Team are in College This Season. 
### 
The prospects for chess are not
very encouraging this year. Only
three of the men, who played on last
year's team, have returned to college.
These are T. T. Bennett, '08, L. New
land, '08, and S. B. Show, '09 (alter
nate), while the other four—H. W.
Strong, '06, F. E. Ulrich, '06, M. M.
Stearns, '06, and G. E. Dole, '07 —have
failed to return and their loss will be
keenly felt. The members of the
club last year, who are in the Univer
sity, are: C. I. Chandler, '08, T. R.
Figg-Hoblyn, '08, and C. E. Spauld
ing, '07.
Last semester the regular tourna
ment for deciding as to new members
was held and the following were
taken into the club: J. E. Carpenter,
'08, A. G. Mott, '08, W. F. Herron,
'08, I. H. Pratt, '09, W. P. Fuller, Jr.,
'10, F. L. Wilde, '10, and W. M.
Davidson, '10.
The first meeting of the club this
semester will be held on Monday,
February 4, at 1:15, in room 240, for
the purpose of making arrangements
for the tournament and fixing the
time for the meetings during the se
mester. By this tournament the team
will be selected. It consists of seven
men, and the winner receives the title
of University chess champion. Tt is
a matter of considerable speculation
this year as to who will receive this
title, and many interesting matches
are promised.
According to the custom in former
years, arrangements will probably be
made with the best chess players on
the Coast for exhibition games, to be
played under the auspices of the club.
