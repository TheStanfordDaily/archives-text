# SNEDIGAR CLAIMS THE MEET.
## California Manager Seems to Regard Controversy Settled in Favor of Blue and Gold. 
### 
From dispatches in the city papers,
it is evident that Manager Snedigar
of the University of California, re
gards the dispute over the place for
holding the track meet as already
settled in favor of the Blue and Gold.
Acting on the recommendation of the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee,
Snedigar announces that he ha.=
looked up the 1905 amendments to the
Intercollegiate Agreement and their
provision that the meet shall alternate
annually, settles the controversy in
favor of California beyond a doubt.
The possibility that the Stanford Ex
ecutive Committee might fail to rat
ify the action of its delegates at the
Intercollegiate Conference last Sat
urday does not seem to have occurred
to the California manager. No word
has been received here regarding the
effect of Stanford's latest action u.
the controversy upon the California
student body. Wednesday's issue oi
the"Daily Californian" comments
briefly on the dispute in an editorial
advocating student body mass meet
ings. The Blue and Gold organ
merely says that the "Here or No
where" attitude adopted by Stanford
is a more radical statement of the
case than the majority of the Califor
nia students body would care to take.
Before the second meeting of the
commitees 011 February 9, California
will undoubtedly take some definite
stand on the question.
