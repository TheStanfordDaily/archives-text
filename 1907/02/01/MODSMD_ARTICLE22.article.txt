# Glee Club Holds Tryout.
## 
### 
The University Glee Club held a
tryout, preliminary to the final one
to be held next Monday evening in
the chapel, last evening. This prelim
inary test was held in view of the
decision of the judges that one tryout
is extremely unsatisfactory in that the
nervousness of the men renders them
unable to make a fair showing.
G. D. Roberts, who has charge of the
tryouts thinks that a much better and
fairer decision can be made under
the present plan in that the men arc
heard twice and under more normal
conditions the second time.
