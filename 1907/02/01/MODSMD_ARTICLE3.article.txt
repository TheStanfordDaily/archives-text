# DELAYED CINDERS ARRIVE
## Athletes Will Train on New Track as Soon as Covering is Spread. 
### 
A car load of cinders for the new
track arrived on the campus this
morning. After long delay and many
trips to the city by Manager Sales,
the Pacific Mail Company, which fur
nished the cinders, shipped the con
signment Monday. Sales expected
the cinders on the day of shipment,
but owing to some delay along the
road they did not arrive until this
morning.
As soon as possible the new cover
ing for the track will be spread. The
cinders are welcomed by the track
men, who have been greatly disap
pointed because of their non-arrival,
and handicapped because they have
been compelled to work on the olc'
track.
Captain Macfarland was much
pleased by the arrival of the carload.
He will have the athletes on the new
track as soon as the cinders are
spread. This will be done, weather
permitting, at once. The cinders, it
is said, are not as good a grade as
was expected, but they are far su
perior to those which came to the
campus last fall.
