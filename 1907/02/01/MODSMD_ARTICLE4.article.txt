# TO BUY SOPHOMORE SCENERY
## Sword and Sandals Will Aid in the Production of "You Never Can Tell." 
### 
To insure the scenic perfection of
the Sophomore comedy, the play com
mittee has authorized Sword and San
dals to buy a new drop, to be used
in the production of "You Never Can
Tell." E. J. Swift, '08, stage mana
ger for Sword and Sandals, has or
dered the new scene to be painted
by a San Francisco firm, at a cost in
the neighborhood of $too. The scene
furnishes the stage setting for the
fourth act of the play, and represents
a hotel balcony and parapet overlook
ing the sea at an English watering
place, which George Bernard Shaw
has so cleverly used in the climax
of the comcdy.
All properties will be furnished by
Sword and Sandals, and also scenes
rented to the Sophomores for a
charge of ten dollars. This includes
the services of supplementary stage

direction and hire of labor behind the
scenes.
The dramatic society is anticipat
ing presenting a play next semester,
which will probably be a Shakespear
ean comedy. P. C. Edwards, '06, J.
M. Ward, '07, and R. S. Kellogg, '07,
are acting as a committee to choose
the most fitting play for presentation.
