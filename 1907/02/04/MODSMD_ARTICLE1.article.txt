# STORY OF THE CARNOT
## HERRON WON MEDAL BY BRILLIANT SPEECH. All Stanford Speakers Make Strong Showing.â€”McNeil, of California, Makes Clever Argument. 
### 
At six o'clock Friday evening, in the
club room of Encina, the contestants
for the Carnot medal first heard the
question 011 which they were to speak
two hours later: "Resolved, That the
success of French Socialism as de
fined in recent programs of the
Socialist party, would make for inter
national peace." W. C. Shelton, '08,
and C. C. McColloch, '08, of Stanford,
with M. E. Harrison, '08, and E. M.
Peixotto, '07, of California, chose tc
uphold the affirmative, while W. F.
Herron, '08, of Stanford, and S. Mc-
Neil, '08, of California, defended the
negative.
Assembly Hall was well filled when
President Jordan introduced the first
speaker, and the debaters held the at
tention of their audience throughout
the contest. The speeches were all
of a high order, and while the medal
was awarded to Herron by the unani
mous decision of the judges, they paid
a high tribute to the general excel
lency of the other speeches. McCol
loch and Shelton put up strong, vig
orous arguments, and had Herron not
won the coveted medal it might well
have been awarded to either of the
other Cardinal representatives. Mc-
Neil was undoubtedly the strongest
man on the visiting team.
Harrison, of California, opened the
debate for the affirmative, by request
ing his audience to cast aside all pre
judice against Socialism as a doctrine
and consider only whether or not it
would make for peace.
Shelton, of Stanford, followed, alsc
on the affirmative. He stated that in
ternational peace and uplifting of hu
manity was the basis of all Socialism,
especially of French Socialism, where
the great leader Clemenceau stood as
the exponent of international friend
ship.
McNeil, of California, in opening
for the negative said that the only way
to treat such a complex question was
by watching results of known tests,
not by outlining imaginary conditions.
He claimed that the idea of Socialism
was the brotherhood, not of nations,
but of the proletariat of all nations,
which would tend toward anything
but a peaceful state of society. His
argument was that the real basis of
international peace in France was in
ternational finance, and that Socialism
would ignore this great root of eco
nomic stability I) 3' doing away with
individual ownership.
McColloch, who spoke next on the
affirmative, held that the success of
the French program would prevent
any great international war as it for
bids a loan. His point was that the
communistic system of Socialism
would prevent wars which are at pres
ent waged by capital.
Peixotto, the last California man
speaking on the affirmative, had an
excellent argument, but was hesitating
and erratic in delivery. He said that
under Socialism in France competi-
tion would be eliminated and she
would not enter any foreign trade
for gain. The only possible war in
which she could become involved
would be defensive and there would
be no occasion for such a conflict.
Herron closed the debate for the
negative with the most forceful and
able speech of the evening. He said
that Socialism in France could only
be sccured by revolutionary mean;
and that, even if secured, its very pro
gram would cause war, as the other
nations would prevent repudiation of
the national debt and would not allow
France to prevent immigration of la
borers. "The inevitable result of the
Socialist policy is war and wide
spread war."
Each of the speakers reserved about
four minutes for. rebuttal, in which
they briefly summarized their previous
speeches. The Stanford team was
much stronger than their opponents
in this part of the contest, both in
the scope of their arguments, and
their skill in refuting their opponents.
Herron clinched the medal by deliver
ing an able rebuttal in which he not
only completely summarized the
points brought out by the negative but
made an able refutation of every sali
ent point advanced by the four speak
ers on the affirmative.

speeches. The Stanford team was
much stronger than their opponents
in this part of the contest, both in
the scope of their arguments, and
their skill in refuting their opponents.
Herron clinched the medal by deliver
ing an able rebuttal in which he not
only completely summarized the
points brought out by the negative but
made an able refutation of every sali
ent point advanced by the four speak
ers on the affirmative.
At six o'clock Friday evening, in the
club room of Encina, the contestants
for the Carnot medal first heard the
question 011 which they were to speak
two hours later: "Resolved, That the
success of French Socialism as de
fined in recent programs of the
Socialist party, would make for inter
national peace." W. C. Shelton, '08,
and C. C. McColloch, '08, of Stanford,
with M. E. Harrison, '08, and E. M.
Peixotto, '07, of California, chose tc
uphold the affirmative, while W. F.
Herron, '08, of Stanford, and S. Mc-
Neil, '08, of California, defended the
negative.
Assembly Hall was well filled when
President Jordan introduced the first
speaker, and the debaters held the at
tention of their audience throughout
the contest. The speeches were all
of a high order, and while the medal
was awarded to Herron by the unani
mous decision of the judges, they paid
a high tribute to the general excel
lency of the other speeches. McCol
loch and Shelton put up strong, vig
orous arguments, and had Herron not
won the coveted medal it might well
have been awarded to either of the
other Cardinal representatives. Mc-
Neil was undoubtedly the strongest
man on the visiting team.
Harrison, of California, opened the
debate for the affirmative, by request
ing his audience to cast aside all pre
judice against Socialism as a doctrine
and consider only whether or not it
would make for peace.
Shelton, of Stanford, followed, alsc
on the affirmative. He stated that in
ternational peace and uplifting of hu
manity was the basis of all Socialism,
especially of French Socialism, where
the great leader Clemenceau stood as
the exponent of international friend
ship.
McNeil, of California, in opening
for the negative said that the only way
to treat such a complex question was
by watching results of known tests,
not by outlining imaginary conditions.
He claimed that the idea of Socialism
was the brotherhood, not of nations,
but of the proletariat of all nations,
which would tend toward anything
but a peaceful state of society. His
argument was that the real basis of
international peace in France was in
ternational finance, and that Socialism
would ignore this great root of eco
nomic stability I) 3' doing away with
individual ownership.
McColloch, who spoke next on the
affirmative, held that the success of
the French program would prevent
any great international war as it for
bids a loan. His point was that the
communistic system of Socialism
would prevent wars which are at pres
ent waged by capital.
Peixotto, the last California man
speaking on the affirmative, had an
excellent argument, but was hesitating
and erratic in delivery. He said that
under Socialism in France competi-
tion would be eliminated and she
would not enter any foreign trade
for gain. The only possible war in
which she could become involved
would be defensive and there would
be no occasion for such a conflict.
Herron closed the debate for the
negative with the most forceful and
able speech of the evening. He said
that Socialism in France could only
be sccured by revolutionary mean;
and that, even if secured, its very pro
gram would cause war, as the other
nations would prevent repudiation of
the national debt and would not allow
France to prevent immigration of la
borers. "The inevitable result of the
Socialist policy is war and wide
spread war."
Each of the speakers reserved about
four minutes for. rebuttal, in which
they briefly summarized their previous
speeches. The Stanford team was
much stronger than their opponents
in this part of the contest, both in
the scope of their arguments, and
their skill in refuting their opponents.
Herron clinched the medal by deliver
ing an able rebuttal in which he not
only completely summarized the
points brought out by the negative but
made an able refutation of every sali
ent point advanced by the four speak
ers on the affirmative.
