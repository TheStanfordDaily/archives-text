The Carnot medal has come back to
Stanford. Our record of victories in
the contests for the de Coubertin tro
phy is so slender that any addition to
it means much to the Cardinal, bu
doubly important is a clean-cut and
convincing victory, such as was won
Friday night on the Assembly Hall
stage. The actual winning of tin
medal is sufficient reward for the
work and worry of preparation, but
the victor deserves to the utmost the
thanks and congratulations of the
Stanford student body. William Her
ron has won the right to stand upon
the roll of Stanford's great individual
debaters, Sandwick, Morris, Wagner,
and Sherriffs.
