Xo official utterance has come from
California regarding Stanford's sug
gestion that the track meet dispute
be settled by arbitration. The only
information which has reached the
campus is contained in a brief dis
patch in one of the San Francisco
papers which says that California will
not even consider such a proposition.
That any of the California officials
should make such a statement is un
believable, and it is hoped that the
story is the work of some campus cor
respondent, who took his own feelings
in the matter as being those of the
authorities at California. Arbitration
is certainly a fair solution of the diffi
culty, and a refusal to arbitrate on the
part of California would be a highly
unsportsmanlike act. Each side cer
tainly has good grounds upon which
to base its claim, and a refusal upon
California's part to submit her casi
to an impartial tribunal would be
good proof that she fears her side of
the controversy may not be as strong
as she has represented it.
