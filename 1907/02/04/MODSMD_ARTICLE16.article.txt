# BILL FAVORABLY REPORTED.
## Senate Committee is not Opposed to Measure Permitting Tuition at Stanford. 
### 
The State Senate Committee on
Revenue and Taxation has reported
favorably on the bill concerning the
charging of tuition in certain courses
at Stanford. This action of the com
mittee practically insures the passage
of the measure by the Senate. It is
thought that the Assembly also is
in favor of making the bill a law.
If this is done, Stanford will charge
tuition for advanced work in Law and
Engineering. Undergraduate courses
will not be affected, and no one now
registered will suffer because of the
new ruling. The fees would be
charged beginning with the fall se
mester.
Nothing further has been done re
garding affiliation with Cooper Medi
cal College or the establishing of a
medical department here. Tt is prob
able, however, that some definite in
formation can be obtained as soon as
the new law goes into effect.
