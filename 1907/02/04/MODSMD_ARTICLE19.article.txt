# QUAD ELECTION TOMORROW.
## Sophomores Will Ballot for Editor and Manager of 1909 Year Book. 
### 
The Sophomore class will ballot on
the names of five candidates for editor
and two for manager of their "Quad"
tomorrow, between the hours of 10:15
and 2:15 o'clock. This will be the cli
max of a month's political stir among
the second year men, and while the
general opinion is that there will be
110 majority choice for editor there
will at least be a decided element of
interest in the strength the candidates
show.
If a second election is necessary as
in all probability it will be, according
to mutual agreement among the can
didates, the one holding the lowest
vote tomorrow will withdraw from
the race. No little excitement has
been caused by the fight between S. C.
Bias and D. W. Burbank, for the
honor of managing the year book.
Those contesting for the editorial
position are Miss L. M. Wells, H. F.
Bruning, T. B. Griffiths, G. N. Rich
ardson, and W. J. Telfer.
The election board as named by
class President T. R. Cadwalader, con
sists of R. S. Worthington, chairman;
P. R. Johnson, D. G. Heinly, F. K.
Jackson, C. A. Prevost, J. B. Swick
ard, G. McGregor, and C. B. Brad
ford.
The first two named will open the
polls and superintend the balloting
till 11:15 o'clock, and the others will
follow in pairs for the succeeding
hours.
