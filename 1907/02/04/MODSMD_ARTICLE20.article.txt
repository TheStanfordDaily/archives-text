# Chess Tryouts Start at Once.
## 
### 
The Chess Club decided this after
noon to start the tryout tournament
at once so that it will be finished by
April I. Each man in the club is to
play against every other man, and
the seven men, having the highest per
centage will constitute the Stanford
team. The man making the highest
percentage of all will be declared the
University chess champion.
In past years, the match between
Stanford and California has generally
been held in the Mechanics' Pavilion,
San Francisco, but this year it is
hoped to hold it at one of the col
leges. Arrangements will be made
to have it held the night before the
track meet at either Stanford or Cali
fornia, depending upon the place of
the meet. This will enable all per
sons interested, to see the match wit'
less inconvenience than in former
years.
It was also decided to correspom
with some of the best players on the
Coast and get them to come here to
play against the whole club. P. W.
Merrill, '08, was admitted to member
ship.
