# MAY ACCEPT CHALLENGE.
## Freshmen Debaters of Blue and Gold Desire to Meet Cardinal.â€”No Final Decision. 
### 
Word has been received from Berk
eley that the 1910 debaters of Califor
nia have accepted the challenge of the
Stanford Freshman society, to an in
tercollegiate debate. There has as yet
been 110 format challenge delivered,
but negotiations between representa
tives of the two societies have been
carried on for some time. The action
of the California Freshmen in pro
visionally accepting the challenge
signifies their willingness to compete
and the Stanford contingent will prob
ably take some formal action at the
meeting of the Freshman League to
night. The consent of the faculty
Committees 011 Literary Contests of
both universities would be necessary
before such a debate could be defi
nitely arranged. The Californian
wish the debate to be set for the even
ing of the Freshman track meet, and
have petitioned the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students to
grant them that date.
