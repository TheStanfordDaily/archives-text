# RUGBY TEAM TO COME
## AUSTRALIAN TO PLAY STANFORD. William Unmack, Representing the Queensland Rugby Union Offers Series for Next Fall. 
### 
The chances arc very favorable for
a Rugby scries in California next fall
with a team of Australian experts, sent
by the Queensland Rugby Union,"
said Manager Sales this afternoon.
Sales is in receipt of a letter from
William Unmack, who refcrced the
intercollegiate games last season, in
which the referee says:"I have just
received a letter from Australia, con
firming my appointment here as the
representative of the Queensland Rug
by Union. They are anxious to help
Rugby here as much as they can at so
great a distance, and want to send a
team over for the coming season, or
would like to have a team from either
Stanford or California, or a combined
team from the two universities visi
Australia." Unmack continues that
the Australians favor a journey to this
country as doing more for Rugb;
than a visit to Australia by a Califor
nia team.
Manager Sales is of the opinion that
if the University of California and
Stanford each guarantee the Austra
lians $1,000, the Union will probably
be able to afford the remainder of
the amount necessary to cover the ex
penses of their team. Sales answered
Unmack's letter this afternoon, saying
that lie could do nothing definite unti
Unmack furnished figures as to how
large a guarantee would be asked by
a visiting Australian team.
If a series can be arranged, there
will probably be three games bctweei
Stanford and the Australians, and it
is not unlikely that the same number
will be played with the Blue and Gold.
October is the month that would fit
the Cardinal training season best, and
Sales will try to bring an Australian
team here at that time. Dr. Angel!
and President Jordan both favor the
proposed series of Rugby contests in
California.
