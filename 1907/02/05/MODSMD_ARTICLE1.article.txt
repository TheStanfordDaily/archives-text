# MAY ROW WASHINGTON
## NORTHERNERS MAKE A PARTIAL GUARANTEE. Want California Crews to Row at Seattle in Triangular Regatta This May. 
### 
The University of Washington is
endeavoring to make arrangements
with Stanford and the University of
California for an intercollegiate re
gatta, to be held on L?ke Washington
011 May 30, and if arrangements can
be perfected, it is possible that a Var
sity crew, and perhaps a Freshman
crew, will go North at the close of
college in May.
The University of Washington
management has been in correspond
ence with the Stanford Boat Club for
some time in an endeavor to arrange
a race. The proposal of the Northern
college is to have regattas here and
on Lake Washington in alternate
years. Their crews would come south
next year and in 1909 a large regatta
would be held in the North at the
time of the Alaska-Yukon Exposition.
\\ ashington offers to guarantee ex
penses, though it would be impossible
to pay the expenses of crews from
both Stanford and California. If the
crews from both universities cannot
go North, Washington is willing to
arrange a race with either Univer
sity, and in this case an agreement
might be reached with California
whereby the winning crew would race
Washington in the Xorth.
The decision concerning the North
ern trip of the crews rests entirely
with the Executive Committee, who
allowed a Varsity and Freshman crew
to go Xorth in May, 1905. This trip
was a successful one, but since that
time the universities have not met on
the water.
Rowing occupies the center of in
terest in the North, and at the tri
angular regatta in 1905 over 15,000
people viewed the races. If races are
held this year, the Varsity will prob
ably consist of an eight, as Washing
ton is ordering two Cornell shells
which will be brought to the Coast
with the two California is ordering
from the same place. Murphy's con
tract with Stanford does not expire
until June t, and as the race with Cal
ifornia does not come off until April,
it would be an easy matter for a crew
to keep light training until time to
go North at the close of college.
