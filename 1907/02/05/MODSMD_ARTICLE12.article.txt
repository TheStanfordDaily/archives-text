The confidence placed by the stu
dent body in the Committee 011 Stu
dent Affairs, which was appointed last
semester, has been amply justified by
the announcement that the new Com
mittee intends to make public its de
cisions in cases where infractions of
conduct and good order are involved.
This system obtains in many of the
larger Eastern universities, and it has
invariably resulted in an increased
confidence 011 the part of the students.
The star chamber sessions of the old
body were a constant source of
trouble and dissatisfaction, which has |
now been removed by the change in ;
policy made by Professor Durand and !
his associates.
