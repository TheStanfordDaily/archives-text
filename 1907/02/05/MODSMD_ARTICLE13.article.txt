A new form of electioneering lias
been introduced by tlie politicians of
the Sophomore class. At the "Quad''
election this morning, a few ballots
were distributed to certain of the vot
ers whose stand was doubtful, by a
member of the election board. These
ballots were so marked that they could
readily be identified while the board
was handling the ballots during the
count. The purpose of such a move
is easily recognizable. More than
one election was sure to he necessary
and the discovered electors can, in
the meantime, be brought into the
fold. The"Daily Palo Alto" has sel
dom touched editorially upon any
phase of student body politics, but the
present matter is so despicable that it
needs more than a passing mention.
Secrccy of the ballot is the great safe
guard of clean and honest elections,
and any attempt to break down this
secrccy is opposed to the interests
and ideals of the Stanford Student
Body. This paper is in possession of
the facts of the case, the names of
those implicated, and full and suffi

cient evidence to back up its asser
tion. A repetition of any such petty
trickery in the succeeding elections
will mean the immediate publication
of all the facts and names of those
connected with the episode.
