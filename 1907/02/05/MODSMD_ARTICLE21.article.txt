# RUMOR ABOUT ABBOTT
## REPORT THAT HE HAS JOINED COLUMBIA FACULTY. New York Dispatch in Morning Paper States That Professor Has Been Elected. 
### 
"Nathan Abbott, dean of the faculty
of law of Stanford University, was
chosen a member of the law faculty
of Columbia University, at a meeting
of the Columbia trustees today."
Such was the text of a despatch
printed in one of the San Francisco
papers this morning. Whether or not
Dr. Abbott accepted the offer was not
stated. The"Daily Palo Alto" wired
Dr. Abbott immediately but has re
ceived no reply as yet.
The Stanford authorities have not
heard from Dr. Abbott in regard to
the proposed offer and, consequently,
can say nothing about it. Dr. Jordan
is momentarily expecting a communi
cation from the professor, but so far
has received none. Evidently, the
President is greatly surprised by the
report, as only recently he told the
Men's Conference that Abbott's re
turn was a certainty. In his recent
letters Dr. Abbott acknowledged that
he had received many flattering offers
from Eastern universities. He stated,
however, that he did not intend to
accept any of them and would surely
be ready to resume work at Stanford
at the expiration of his leave of ab
sence.
The election of Dr. Abbott to the
Columbia faculty is only an offer and
docs not imply that he will accept
the position. For this reason it is
still hoped that he will be back at
Stanford next August.
