# FAIL OF A MAJORITY
## ANOTHER "QUAD" ELECTION IS NECESSARY. Burbank Wins Easily for Manager. Telfer and Griffiths are Out of Race. 
### 
Five more than three hundred mem
bers of the Sophomore class went to
the polls this afternoon to ballot 011
the names of five candidates for editor
of the 1909 "Quad.' The largest vote
in the history of "Quad" elections
was tallied, and as expected, no ma
jority was arrived at. For manager,
D. W. Burbank, of Encina Club, was
elected over his opponent S. C. Bias,
by the overwhelming pluralty of 155
votes.
The election was full of surprises,
particularly the strong run made by
Miss L. M. Wells, who rolled up a
total of 78, but seven short of the
leading candidate, G. N. Richardson.
W. J. Telfer, who was expected to
show strength on the first ballot, dis
appointed his followers, and secured
but 49 electors. Thirty-four votes
was the total polled by T. B. Griffiths,
and by the terms of the agreement
among the candidates lie now drops
out of the race. It was generally con
ceded that Griffiths would be the low
man.
The vote follows:
For Editor —
G. N. Richardson, 85.
Miss L. M. Wells, 78.
H. F. Bruning, 59.
W. J. Telfer, 49.
T. B. Griffiths, 34.
For Manager—
D. W. Burbank, 228.
S. C. Bias, 73.
A second election has been called
for by the board, of which R. S.
Worthington is chairman, 011 Thurs-*
day, and the interim, no doubt, will
be fraught with interesting develop
ments among the remaining candi
dates.
Telfer Withdraws from Fight.
At a late hour this afternoon W. J.
Telfer withdrew from the race for
editor, thus simplifying to some de
gree, the contest for that position.
