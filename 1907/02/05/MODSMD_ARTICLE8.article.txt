# NO BALL GAME TOMORROW.
## Santa Clara Objects to Date Arranged by Sales.â€”First Game Saturday. 
### 
Because of objections offered by
Santa Clara College tbere will not be
a game on the campus tomorrow as
scheduled. Santa Clara sent word to
Manager Sales this morning that their
faculty would not permit the team to
be absent twice in the week.
Sales is making an effort to bring
the Santa Clara team here Thursday
instead of Stanford playing on the
former's grounds on that date. Santa
Clara is not in favor of the change,
saying that the students desire the
scheduled game to be played there.
Tt is therefore probable that there
will not be a Varsity game here until
Saturday. A game is scheduled with
Santa Clara at that time. Tomorrow
will be the last practice for the Var
sity before the first regular game of
the season.
