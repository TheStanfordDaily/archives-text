# CHANGES ITS POLICY
## STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TAKES ACTION. Statement of Findings in Cases of Students Will be Given Out Hereafter. 
### 
"At a recent meeting of the Com
mittee of Student Affairs a student
was suspended from the University
for the remainder of the semester for
fraud in examination."
W. F. Durand, Chairman.
The above notice given out yester
day by Professor Durand, chairman
of the Student Affairs Committee,
marks a complete change in the pol
icy and ideals of that body. It is
the first time that any public an
nouncement has been made by the
Committee in taking such an action,
but the policy is in accordance with
that adopted by the similar commit
tees of larger Eastern colleges. It is
put into effect here for the first time,
and will undoubtedly be followed dur
ing the lite of the present committee
at least.
"The idea in publishing statements
of this kind,'' said Professor Durand
when seen today, "is to acquaint the
student body with the actions of the
Committee, and at the same time to
show the students what may be ex
pected in case of such infractions of
conduct and good order as may re
quire definite action by the Commit
tee. One excuse which has been fre
quently made, especially by Fresh
men, when called up under charge of
fraud in examinations was the fact
that they did not know that suspen
sion from college would follow an act
of this kind. It is therefore the policy
of the Committee to let the students
know upon what grounds it stands in
regard to matters of this kind."
"The Committee does not bind itself
to any single action when acts which
may require disciplinary measures are
brought to its attention, as much may
depend upon the special features of
the case, but when any action is taken
the findings of the Committee will be
made public in order that the student
body may know what is going on."
This is the first time that the Stu
dent Affairs Committee has made
public its findings, and as a departure
from previous years, the policy of the
present Committee is of considerable
importance, while at the same time
this recent action will serve to warn
new students of the penalties for what
is commonly termed "cribbing."
