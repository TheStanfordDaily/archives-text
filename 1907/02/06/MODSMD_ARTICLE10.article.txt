# SNEDIGAR ON DISPUTE
## CALIFORNIA'S MANAGER CITES AGREEMENT. Blue and Gold Angered by Stanford's Refusal to Postpone Rugby Last November. 
### 
"Why should we have an intercol
legiate agreement, if we are not to live
up to its stipulations?" said O. A.
Snedigar, California's graduate-man
ager today, when questioned as to the
reasons for the State University's
radical stand on the track meet dis
pute. "We feel as Stanford felt last
fall when that institution refused to
grant us a week's postponement of the
football game, making our students
work day and night to have our field
ready. In that controversy Stanford
had the legal right to have the game
on the date they insisted upon, and
when we asked for extra time in
which to prepare for it, our request
was flatly refused. Now you wish us
to waive the letter of the law as a
courtesy to you, and the California
student body is not in a mood to
make any such concession."
When questioned as to the prob
ability of no meet in case Stanford
insisted on having the annual event
here, Snedigar made a guarded state
ment. "I know the sentiment of the
California student body is strongly in
favor of a strict interpretation of the
agreement, and if the question were
put up to them there would be 110
doubt as to their decision, but on the
other hand our executive committee
is a more conservative body, having
both alumni and faculty members.
The final decision rests, I believe,
with that committee, and it is possible
that the older heads on the body
might dissuade the younger members
from hasty action."
In reply to the rumor that the main
reason for California's insistence that
the meet be held 011 her campus, was
a financial one, the visiting graduate
manager said, "I admit that the finan
cial side of the question is very im
portant to 11s. We are over $11,000
in debt, and holding tlie meet on our
campus means a difference of nearly
$1,000 in the gate receipts. The fin
ancial argument is one of our chief
contentions, but it is not our only one
by any means."
