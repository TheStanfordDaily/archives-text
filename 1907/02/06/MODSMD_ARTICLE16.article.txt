The accusation made against a
member of the 1909 "Quad" election
board was based upon the testimony
of a well-known member of the Soph
omore class, who produced two bal
lots marked as described, which he
claimed had been handed to him by a
member of the election board.
This man refuses to meet the elec
tion board with his evidence, as he
claims his interest ceased when he
displayed the ballots in question. An
examination by this paper, of the bal- i
lots cast, reveals the fact that none
bear any distinguishing marks and the j
testimony of the election board them* j
.-elves that certain upper classmen, in I
a spirit of fun, secured some of the j
ballots and marked them, may offer |
an explanation of the entire circum- j
stance. It would be well in the fu- j
ture, to avoid a repetition of the pres- ;
cut disgraceful affair, to abolish the
system of distributing ballots before
the electors appear at the ballot box.
Investigation exonerates the individ
uals of the election board from any
blame, and leaves their accuser in the
contemptible position of a man who
has slandered another and failed to
back up his assertions. For such a
man there is small place at Stanford.
