# WILL RENEW STAND.
## Executive Body to Try to Have Delegates Arrange Track Meet Here. 
### 
The Executive Committee will meet
this evening to instruct Stanford's
delegates 011 the attitude they will
take next Saturday night, when the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee
will probably meet again at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco. The general
opinion of the members of the Ex
ecutive Committee remains that al
though the letter of the Intercollegi
ate Agreement favors California as
the place for the track meet, the in
tent would bring the field day here.
If the University of California could
get a decision from a court of law
that the State institution was entitled
to have have the meet on its own
campus, a court of equity would re
verse the finding of the lower court
and construe the intent of the parties
as justly in favor of the Cardinal.
The delegates will be instructed to do
all in their power to bring the meet
to the Stanford campus, and may be
empowered to submit a proposition
of arbitration.
California's executive committee
will meet tonight and act upon Stan
ford's suggestion that the Intercol
legiate Conference meet again on
February 9. Should the Blue and
Gold decide to confer again, instruc
tions will probably be given their del
egates this evening.
