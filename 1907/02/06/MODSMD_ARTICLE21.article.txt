# BUSY MONTH FOR GUILD.
## Many Patents at Hospital.â€”Change of System in the Commissary Department Made. 
### 
At the regular monthly meeting of
the Guild Hospital Board it was de
cided to detail a staff nurse, 011 spe
cial duty, as commissary agent, the
purpose of this experiment being to
provide the management committee
with a purchasing representative and
facilities for making a careful study
of the housekeeping and maintenance
of hospital work. It is hoped that as
a result of the semi-weekly reports
to be made by the nurse, a more
economical administration of the com
missary department of the hospital
will be brought about.
An unusually heavy month's work
was done, as is evidenced by the Jan
uary report which follows:
Number of patients received dur
ing the month was 34, including 23
students, 1 faculty member, and 10
town patients. 384 days in hospital.

tients was 12.3; lowest number 10;
