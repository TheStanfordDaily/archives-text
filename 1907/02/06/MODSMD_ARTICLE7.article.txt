# MESSAGE FROM ABBOTT
## WIRES THAT HE HAS INFORMED DR. JORDAN. President Has Heard no Word from East and Telegram is Being Traced. 
### 
"See President Jordan for telegram
on Saturday." This was the message
received this morning from Dr. Ab
bott, by the"Daily Palo Alto." But
the mystery of it is that the Presi
dent has received no dispatch. At
present the Western Union Company
is looking for the lost message, but
as yet no trace of it has been found.
Dr. Jordan wired Professor Abbott
this morning and is momentarily ex
pecting an answer.
In the meantime there is much con
jecture as to the contents of the
lost telegram. Although Dr. Jordan
has felt all along that Abbott would
return, lie had to admit this afternoon
that his confidence was somewhat
shaken by the message to the"Daily
Palo Alto."
It seems that everything possible
has been done to insure Professor
Abbott's return. Not only has his
salary been raised one thousand dol
lars a year, but all the changes which
he advised in the Law department
here have been ratified by the Board
of Trustees. The most important of
these were the promotion to a pro
fessorship of C. IT. Huberich, the pro
motion of A. M. Cathcart and W. N.
Hohfeld to associate and assistant
professorships respectively, and the
establishment of another full profes
sorship. Who will fill this new chair
has not yet been decided. Dr. Jor
dan has several Eastern men in view,
but is waiting for Dr. Abbott's ad
vice in the matter before making a
final decision.
"The loss of Professor Abbott
would be a great blow to the Univer
sity," said President Jordan. "Dr.
Abbott's knowledge of law is not only
wonderful, but his ability as a teacher
in the classroom is remarkable. How
ever able Dr. Abbott's successor may
be, he would be a young man and
would need several years at best to
do what the former dean has already
done."
