# ARE FOR ARBITRATION
## COMMITTEE DIRECTS DELEGATES ON MEET. Gray Uniforms for Athletic Teams Herron, McColloch, Shelton, and Edwards Granted Pins. 
### 
Stanford will make another attempt
to bring the representatives of the
University of California to agree to
arbitration as to the place where the
next intercollegiate field meet will be
held. This was the tenor of the di
rections given to the Stanford dele
gates at last night's meeting of the
Executive Committee. If the Berk
eley men will not arbitrate, R. W.
Barrett, '04, D. D. Sales, '06, and E. P.
Stott, '07, will return to the Exec
utive Committee for further instruc
tions. Stanford athletes will hence
forth be protected from blood-poison
ing caused by red woolen socks and
jerseys, for the Executive Committee
decided that the major color for ath
lctic uniforms should hereafter be
gray. The members of the Carnot
debating team were granted pins.
Secretary Crider was directed to sum
mon the Tennis Club to present its
new constitution for ratification by
the Executive Committee as soon as
the document is drawn up. W. Y.
Wentz, '06, president of the Social
Service Club, made a full report of
the organization and work of the
club.
The plan for arbitration was not
definitely worked out, but the details
submitted will probably include a
tribunal composed of disinterested
university men living in San Fran
cisco. The only case similar to the
present controversy was that in con
nection with the professionalism of
Warren Smith, the California half
back of 1902. The matter was settled
by a board at whose head was Fairfax
Wheelan, then president of the Uni
versity Club of San Francisco. The
attitude which the California repre
sentatives to the Intercollegiate Com
mittee will take cannot be forecasted.
Indeed, the suggestion of the Exec
utive Committee that another confer
ence be held by the two universities
has not been answered by the Califor
nia authorities. If a sccond meeting
of the conference is held it will con
vene at the Palace Hotel in San Fran
cisco next Saturday evening. Febru
ary 9.
The new athletic uniform adopted
by the Executive Committee will be
used in all sports where practicable.
Last year's Rugby fifteen played in
red jerseys exclusively, with the re
sult that a number of them suffered
from boils. The baseball team has
tried the gray jerseys and found them
a success. The socks to be worn
bear a two-inch band of cardinal
around the calf. The sleeves of the
jerseys are circled with narrow stripes
of red.
\V. Herron, '08, C. C. McColloch,
'08. W. C. Shelton, '08, and L. M.
Edwards, '07, are the men to receive
the debating emblems. The three
members of the team will receive pins
bearing a block "S" and Edwards, the
alternate, one with the substitute Ger
man letter.
The Tennis Club has recently re

organized on new lines. The mem
bership lias been reduced, raising the
standard for entrance into the club.
The Executive Committee will revise
the constitution drawn up and see
that the new document conforms to
the student body requirements.
