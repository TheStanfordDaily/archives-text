In the issue of the ''Daily Calit'or
nian" for Monday, February 4, ap
pears the first editorial notice of the
track meet dispute. The caption on
the editorial reads "Stanford's Pecu
liar Position," and under the heading
the editor expatiates at length upon
the need for living up to agreements.
"Now California would just as soon
meet Stanford on Stanford's grounds
as anywhere else," says the editorial,
"It is not a mere question of the place
involved, however. It is a question
of living up to agreements that have
already been threshed out.'"
In answer to this talk of agree
ments, Stanford asks but one ques
tion. Can California honestly say
that when this agreement was
threshed out and framed, it was the
intention of the framers to have two
successive track meets upon the
campus of either institution? It is
â€¢far more probable that the Blue and
Gold student body is counting more
upon our so-called discourtesy last
November, than upon any agreement
which has already been threshed out.
They have the letter of the law upon
their side and in return for Stanford's
refusal to postpone the Rugby game
they intend to fight on every techni
cality. This attitude is easy to under
stand and appreciate but Stanford
would like to know why any post
ponement of the Varsity game last
semester was necessary. California
had only four or five months in which
to clean off and widen her field. She
attempted to make the unnecessary
delays in this work an excuse for a
postponement of the game when the
Stanford team was trained to the
minute and any delay would have se
riously injured the chances of the
Cardinal. The two cases hardly seem
analagous.
