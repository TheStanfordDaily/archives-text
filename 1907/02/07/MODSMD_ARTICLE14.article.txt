Editor "Daily Palo Alto" ;
In the issue of the"Daily Palo
Alto" for January 5, 1907, an editorial
accused a member of the '09 election
board of handing out marked ballots,
and stated further that the paper was
in possession of all the facts, names
and sufficient evidence to back up its
assertions. When called upon to do
so by the election board, the man
upon whose statement the editorial
was based would not come forward
to back up his statements.
On examining all the votes cast,
which had been placed in care of J.
H. McDowell immediately after the
election, no marked ballots could be
found.
It is the opinion of the board that
the accusations were maliciously false,
and that the paper should have ex
orcised greater care before giving
such publicity ro the false accusation.
