### 
Up to 4:30 no word has been re
ceived from Professor Xathan Abbott,
either at the President's Office or
by the"Daily Palo Alto." The mes
sage which Dr. Abbott wired that he
had sent last Saturday to President
Jordan was traced back to New York
by the Western Union Company, who
reported that no sucli message had
been delivered at their offices in that
city for the first three days in Feb
ruary.
