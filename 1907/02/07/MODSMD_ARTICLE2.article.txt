# TRACK FAST FOR MEET
## POSTPONED CONTEST WILL BE INTERESTING. Athletes are Beginning to Round Into Condition.—Two Handicaps are Changed. 
### 
The postponed track meet which
will be held tomorrow afternoon at
4:30, bids fair to be one of the most
interesting contests of the early sea
son.
"I never saw the track in better
condition than it is right now," said
"Dad" Moulton today, "and I expect
fast performances 011 both cinder path
and field. During this week the old
men have swung back into pretty fair
form, and 011 such a fast track the
finishes are bound to be close. We
have done our best to place the men
on a perfectly even footing by handi
capping and those who are present at
the meet tomorrow will see some
pretty races."
With a week's extra training all the
athletes have greatly improved their
condition, and despite the fact that
this is the first meet of the year, high
class performances may be expected
in the sprints and on the field. It is
yet too earl}' for the distance men
to be in shape to cut down time, al
though Xash, with a big field to run
through may have condition enough
to finish well.
Two of the handicaps have been
changed by Track Captain Macfar
land; Lanagan and Kocher going in
at scratch in the pole-avult and Mc-
Neil being moved back a foot in the
hundred, giving him but one foot
handicap over Holman.
The following are the officials for
tomorrow's meet: Starter—J. O. Mil
ler, '08; Clerk of the Course—G.
