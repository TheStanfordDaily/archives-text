# BRUNING IS HIGH MAN
## LEADS IN FIGHT FOR 1909 "QUAD" EDITOR. Richardson Drops Out. â€” Deciding Election Will be Held on Tuesday. 
### 
The second in the series of elec
tions necessary among the Sopho
mores to choose an editor for the
class "Quad" furnished a genuine sen
sation today when H. F. Bruning, pre
viously low, with 59 votes, forged
well to the front with 110 tallies; G.
N. Richardson, the leader at the last
count, picked up a single new elector
and Miss L. M. Wells increased her
vote from 78 to 102. By virtue of the
agreement among the candidates,
Richardson now retires from the con
test and the deciding battle will be
fought out next Tuesday, the date set
for the new election.
That the field of eligible voters was
thoroughly exploited at the first elec
tion was illustrated by the fact that
two less ballots were cast today than
011 Tuesday. The total at the count
this afternoon was but 298 as against
305 before, but the election board
threw out five ballots on the ground
that they were improperly marked.
The vote by candidates:
H. F. Bruning, 110.
Miss Laura Wells, 102.
G. X. Richardson, 86.
Outside of the fact that it is in
tensely exciting the present class con
test is unique in that the count today
reveals the fact that lines between
the various factions are more tautly
drawn than one would imagine poss
ible. With 83 votes loosed by the
withdrawal of Telfer and Griffiths
from the race, the two candidates,
with but a single exception, received
the whole between them.
