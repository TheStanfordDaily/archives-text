### 
Berkeley, Feb. 7, 1907.
Clay R. Crider,
Secretary A. S. S. U.
Dear Sir:
Your communication of Jan. 30 was handed to the Executive Committee
of A. S. U. C. at its regular meeting last night. As secretary I was in
structed to notify you that it is the sense of the committee, that as the
matter of the place of holding the Intercollegiate track-meet is fully
covered by Art. IV, Sec. 2, of the Intercollegiate Agreement of 1905,
to which no amendment was made by the Intercollegiate Agreement Com
mittee, at its meeting of Jan. 26, 1907, they having agreed to abide by the
original agreement, it is unnecessary to hold another meeting of the com
mittee.
Sincerely yours,
C. H. Ramsden,
Sec. A. S. U. C.
