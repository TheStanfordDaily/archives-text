The University of California has re
fused all proposals of Stanford, and
now stands on the ground that the
Intercollegiate meet shall be held on
their own campus or not at all. Over
tures by the Stanford committee have
been for naught, and to anticipate the
proposal of arbitration California to
day declared flat-footedly that they
would stand on their so-called rights,
apparently desiring to be relieved of
the burden of the next move.
The dispute with California as to
the proper place of holding the track
meet has now reached the crucial
point. Ultimatums have been ex
changed, taking the word at the
meaning our friends, the enemy, have
chosen to give it; Stanford has de
clared its willingness to put the mat
ter in the hands of an arbitration
board; the Blue and Gold today re
fused to hear any such proposal, and
the Executive Committee this after
noon, by motion, gave California one
more chance to accept or refuse the
conciliatory method. Further argu
ment of the merits of the dispute
seems entirely unnecessary. The
whole case has been threshed out on
both sides and while we find it hard
to understand the logic of the new
California contention that Stanford
should have proposed an amendment
to the Intercollegiate Agreement at
the meeting in January as if that
would have altered the situation, the
only advice which seems proper at
the present time is that we all stand
together. Our case is in the hands

of men whom we have by our own
votes chosen to act in all matters
affecting our interests, and loyalty to
our choice and to our University de
mands that we support them in what
ever measure seems to them expe
dient.
Xot abating one whit our conten
tion that by all the laws of justice
and sportsmanship the meet should
come to our own campus, still what
ever turn the wheel of fate has in
store let us accept it as gentlemen
and sportsmen.
