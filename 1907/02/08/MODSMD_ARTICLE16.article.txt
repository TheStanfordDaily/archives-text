# SHELL ON THE WAY
## NEW EIGHT-OARED BOAT IS NOW AT THE ISTHMUS. Boating Men are Elated at the Prospect of Securing the Shell by First of Next Month. 
### 
Unless some unavoidable delay oc
curs the eight-oared shell ordered
some time ago will reach the campus
about the first of March. Word was
received from the East today that the
shell was shipped 011 the S. S. "Ha
waiian'' which left New York on Jan
uary 24. According to this the shell
is being taken across the Isthmus of
Panama at the present time and
should begin its journey up the Coast
inside of a few days, reaching San
Francisco within a few weeks.
This is three weeks ahead of the
time that the Boat Club expected
the shell to arrive, and consequently
there is considerable satisfaction over
this fact for the unexpectedly early
arrival will give Coach Murphy nearly
two months in which to whip an
eight into shape, and will also give
him time to turn out a Freshman
eight in case California desires the
latter race.
Murphy has the majority of the
men working 011 the water now, and
the gig and barge are putin daily
use. The four-oared shell has been
renovated and is ready for service.
The old men will be putin this boat
and the new men will also be putin
at intervals in order to accustom them
to rowing in a shell. Murphy is well
satisfied with the progress that the
Freshmen are making, and the new
men who are out for the Varsity
crew are beginning to show form in
the boat. Several oars have been
broken but the nominal assessment
which each man who is rowing is
supposed to pay will cover the cost
of the oars.
The monthly assessments of money
promised by various men last semes
ter have been very slow in coming
in. It is imperative that this money
be paid at once as there is little money
in the treasury, and the freight must
be paid on the shell from New York
to San Francisco at the end of the
month.
