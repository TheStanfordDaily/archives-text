# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL NOT RECEDE.
## California Will be Given One More Chance to Refuse Arbitration Proposal. 
### 
As expected, the Executive Com
mittee took such a stand this after
noon in a special meeting that the
track meet will be held on the Stan
ford campus or not at all. It was
moved by Graduate-Manager Sales
and seconded by J. E. Cushing. '08,
that Secretary C. R. Crider, '07, be
instructed to notify the University
of California that Stanford considers
another meeting of the Intercollegi
ate Committee essential to the settle
ment of the controversy, and sug
gests Tuesday evening, February 12
as a suitable time for the conference.
The motion was passed without rlis
cussion by the members nf the com
mittee, all apparently being firm in
their original stand that concession
to California is out of the que tioii
The motion passed but re: f entes the
position the Executive Commit..'
took last Wednesday night. San ford
will do all in her power to bri':the
meet to her own campus r.rd no viore.
Secretary Crider receive 1 a reply
to the Stanford 1 of arbit
ration this morning from the Califor
nia executive body, which declares
that they will not argue the matter
before a board of disinterested par
ties.
This attitude leaves but one way
open to get the athletes of the two
universities together this spring. Cal
ifornia may either consent to a second
conference in which to reconsider her
stand, or an absolute deadlock will re
sult.
Certain it is that there will be 110
meet unless the athletic authorities
across the bay reconsider their posi
tion and meet Stanford's delegates
again in an attempt to adjust the
difficulty. If California will do none
of these things, Stanford is satisfied
with a deadlock. The Executive
Committee has spoken and has noth
ing further to say in regard to the
matter unless advances arc made by
the other side.
The members of the committee are
fully convinced that their stand is the
only just one to keep the track meets
alternating between the two colleges.
The last intercollegiate field day was

held on the Berkeley cinder path in
1905 and the next one will be run off
011 the cinder path here. Tf it does
not come this year it will come next.
For the Stanford conception of justice
in the matter is directly opposed to
having the intercollegiate meet held
twice in succession on the same cam
pus.
