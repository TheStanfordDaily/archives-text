# NEW TENNIS TRYOUTS
## VARSITY MEN NOT IN PRELIMINARIES. Three Tournaments to Precede Final in Which Five Players Will Compete. 
### 
The question of an improved sys
tem of tryouts was fully threshed out
at last night's meeting of the Univer
sity Tennis Club, and the result of a
rather long session was a compromise
between the old system and the radi
cal new one proposed. The club
finally decided by a practically unani
mous vote, that the tryouts for the
single's team should be carried out
upon the following lines: all men who
have made a Varsity singles team
shall be exempt from the three pre
liminary tournaments, meeting the
winners of these in the "round-robin"
final. The winners of each of these
preliminaries will qualify with P. B.
Delano, '08, and A. J. Gowan, '09, the
Varsity men of last year, for the de
ciding scries.
The plan that the Varsity men
should play through the preliminarv
tournaments was rejected on the
grounds that since a number of candi
dates are playing equally well at pres
ent. such a system would neither
prove thorough or satisfactory. Five
straight tournaments and a "round
robin," exempting 110 one, was sug
gested as a solution of the difficulty
but this was judged impractical be
cause of the lack of both time and
money. The old method of exempt
ing the Varsity players and holding
but two tournaments was abandoned
as being not thorough enough, and as
said before, the method adopted was
considered a fair compromise of all
the proposals.
It was argued that the Varsity play
ers having already proved their ability
were entitled to exemption from the
preliminary rounds and that an addi
tional advantage would be secured in
that more new men could qualify for
the deciding "round robin."
In the future 110 doubles team
which has played against California
will be exempt from the preliminary
competition. Owing to the few en
tries in the tryouts for this team,
two tournaments in the future will
be held instead of one. All the
matches will be five-set contests, the
winners of the first tournament being
chosen as the Varsity team and the
winners of the second the substitute
team.
