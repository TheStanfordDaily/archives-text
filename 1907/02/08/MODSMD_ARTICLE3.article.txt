# CALIFORNIA CHANGES FRONT
## Blue and Gold Now Declares Stanford Should Have Proposed an Amendment. 
### 
The communication to Secretary C.
R. Crider, '07, this morning came as
a genuine surprise. It was expected
at least that the question would be
submitted to arbitration, if no agree
ment between the committees could
be reached. California, however, will
not even consent to such a settlement,
saying that there can be but one con
struction, their's, placed 011 section 2,
article 4, of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment.
It would seem from the ultimatum,
as the morning papers please to call
it, issued by California today that the
r' 1 college takes a somewhat
c anged front in the di pute. Tr.e
phrasing of the letter would indicate
that Stanford should rather than at
tempt to settle the place of holding
the meet on the basis of the old agree
ment at the meeting last month, have
proposed an r momlment to the agree
ment. Such a conception of the
necessity of the care seems a bit 112 -
bed to the Stanford mind, but
no doubt this proposition appealed to
the California committee as being an
appropriate manner by which to
clinch their case.
