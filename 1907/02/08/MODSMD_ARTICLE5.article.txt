## "DAD" MOULTON PUTS SQUAD THROUGH PACES. Many Show Up Well In First Track Meet of the Season. 
### 
Close and fast finishes were the
feature of today's meet. The handi
capper waiting every event proved
judicious, and as a result the specta

man or McNeil.

scratch man, ran a game race, but
was set a triffle too far dack to win
through such a large field, although

in taking third place. Edwards, with
three yards handicap, was fast off
the mark and once in the stretch was
never headed. Coonan took second
place. Bradford ran a heady race in
the mile and won handily, although
hard pressed by Peterson. Maun
drell, the scratch man, has a slight
attack of tonsilitis and was unable to
compete.
Nash easily outclassed all the en
tries in the six lap event, and despite
(the heavy handicap imposed upon
him he won with ease, closing the
gap between himself and the leading
men in the fourth lap and finished
e sily.
