# VARSITY WINS AGAIN
## SANTA CLARA LOSES POORLY PLAYED GAME. Poor Base Running Mars Stanford Play.—Collegians Are Not Strong. 
### 
Santa Clara College fell a victim
Saturday for the second time this
season before the Varsity baseball
team. Outplayed consistently, still
the Catholic collegians were danger
our at every stage of the game, and it
was only by playing up to mettle till
the closing inning that the Cardinal
pulled out a certain victory.
The game was a poor exhibition
from a spectator's standpoint, both
sides bungling badly and failing to hi
consecutively or hard. It was evi
dent from their showing that Santa
Clara has not such teams as she de
veloped in seasons past.
As for the Varsity they are far
from up to form and while their
showing delighted the bleachers it is
evident that it will take a great deal
of consistent practice before they will
be at their best. Perhaps the most
noticeable feature of Saturday's game
was faulty work on bases. Had the
Santa Clarans been able to bunch
their hits at all it is doubtful if the
Varsity would have secured the long
end of the score as time and again
they failed to take advantage of
openings whereby runs might have
been brought over.
With two men down in the second
inning the visitors opened the run
getting. Twohy hit one at Theile too
fast to handle, went to second 011 a
balk called by Umpire Wolters while
Jimmy Byrnes, the college coach was
still 011 the diamond, was able to steal
third 011 a high throw by Siott and
scored a moment later on :i passed
ball. This was the poore.-t defensive
form the Varsity showed and there
after they pulled together, preventing
further tallying.
The fifth inning saw Stanford's first
score. With one out Cuenin, the
Freshman right fielder, v. is walked,
lie stole second base, we.it to third
while Daily was going out Twohy to
Broderick and scored when short-stop
Schaefer juggled a drive oft Fenton's
bat.
Captain Presley opened the next
inning with a two-base drive, lie
took third 011 a wild pitch and tallied
on a pretty piece of hit and run work.
Owen who had been sent in to bat
for \\ irt laid a high one of Brown's
curves safe well inside the third-base
line, enabling Presley to score with
out trouble.
Two more tallies in the seventh
closed the scoring. Scott singled and
Daily advanced him to third with a
smash to right field. Brown walked
Fenton purposely, filling the bags and
Presley cast a temporary gloom on
the Cardinal by striking out. Dennis,
however, hit a bad bounder to Twohy
who let it slip through and both Scott
and Daily crossed the home plate.
