# Elaborate Play Program.

### 
Pains will be taken to make the
program for the Sophomore play the
most attractive of its kind ever pub
lished on the campus. J. N. Alex
ander, '09, has been granted the priv
ilege of issuing the program on a
commission basis.
Several artists of the Sophomore
class arc working on cover designs
to be reproduced in color, and photo
graphs of scenes in the play will be
inserted. The booklet will contain
many details connectcd with this pro
duction of "You Never Can Tell."
