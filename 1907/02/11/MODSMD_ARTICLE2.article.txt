# 1909 WINS IN DEBATE
## SECOND YEAR MEN DEFEAT FRESHMAN TEAM. Takes Thirty Minutes for Judges to Reach Decision.â€”Ferrell Makes Forceful Speech. 
### 
The annual interclass debate held
Friday night was decided in favor of
the Sophomores, though the merits of
the two teams were so evenly bal
anced that the judges deliberated
nearly thirty minutes before rendering
a decision.
The subject for debate, "Resolved,
That Annexation is the Best Solution
of the Cuban Situation," was upheld
by the Freshman team, composed of
D. F. Conway, F. F. Munier, and J.
E. Slielton, while the negative was
defended by G. B. Bush, H. F. Brun
ing, and G. D. Ferrell for the Sopho
mores.
The affirmative held that annexa
tion was the best solution as a pro
tectorate had already proved inade
quate and the stable government nec
essary to the economic development
of the island could only be established
by annexation. The strategic posi
tion of Cuba was also a strong argu
ment for annexation. The negative
held that annexation meant a new
race and labor problem, increased
debt and competition of coolie labor
products with home produce. They
argued that revised laws and a wise
protectorate would be a better solu
tion than annexation.
Ferrell made the best argument of
the evening and showed a good grasp
of his subject and an ability to speak
extemporaneously. The first year
a outclassed the r opponents in de
livery, Slielton especially, proving
himself a forceful, fluent speaker both
in direct argument and rebuttal.
The decision, which was rendered
by Professors R. M. Alden, of the
English department, and 11. P. Earle,
of the Romanic Languages depart
ment, and E. A. Cunha, '07, was based
more upon the arguments advanced
than the delivery of the speakers.
G. Knupp, '07, presided.
