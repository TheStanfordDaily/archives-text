# To Name Women's Athletic Field.
## 
### 
Several matters were discussed at
the Women's Athletic Association
this afternoon. It was decided that
an informal meeting of all the mem
bers should be held next week at
Roble. Anyone who has paid the stu
dent body fee is a member. Sugges
tions were made for the name of the
women's athletic grounds, the one
meeting greatest favor being "The
Roble Field." Miss A. Elliott, '09,
was unanimously elected Sophomore
member of the Board of Directors.
