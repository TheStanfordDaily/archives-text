# TO WIDEN NEW FIELD
## BOARD OF CONTROL PLANNING. WORK. New Athletic Fields Provided for by Trustees Will be Graded at Once. 
### 
At a meeting of the Board of Con
trol last Friday evening provision was
made for the laying out and grading
of the supplementary athletic fields,
provided for at the recent meeting of
the University Trustees. Plans were
also made for widening Stanford
Field.
E. P. Stott, '07, and G. J. Presley,
'07, representing respectively the foot
ball and baseball interests, were pres
ent. It was decided to move the
bleachers on the east side of the foot
ball field. The gridiron will be wid
ened about 56 feet, and the training
quarters will be enlarged in the space
thus obtained. Professor C. B. Wing,
D. D. Sales, '06, and C. F. Laumeister,
'07, were appointed a committee to
attend to the moving of the bleachers.
Work will be begun at once. When
completed, Stanford Field will be
large enough to accommodate a base
ball diamond.
On the northeast side of the foot
ball field, the new supplementary
baseball held will be constructed.
The new gridiron will be located to
the east of this. A committee, con
sisting of J. E. McDowell, '00, D. D.
Sales, 06, and C. R. Crider, '07, was
appointed to supervise the grading
of the proposed fields.
'I wo avenues will be constructed,
whic'i will run along the north and
south ends of Stanford Field to the
new gridiron and diamond. It has
not yet been decided from where
these avenues will start.
Plie Board has determined to use
the old plans of the Stanford Field
bleachers for the bleachers around
tlie new track. These plans were
sent to the Trustees for ratification.
The Finance Committee of that body
l as rot yet reported 011 them so noth
ing ci!n lie done towards the erection
of the bleachers at present.
