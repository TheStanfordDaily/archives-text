# California Is Silent.
## 
### 
Xo word lias been received from
California regarding the communica
tion sent by the Executive Committee
on the track dispute. The Stanford
letter suggested tomorrow night as a
date for another meeting of tile Inter
collegiate Committees but California's
silence will probably prevent a meet
ing then.
