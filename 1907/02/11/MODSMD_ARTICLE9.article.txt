The spirit displayed by the Stan
ford bleachers at the baseball game
Saturday afternoon was far from
what it should have been. Organized
rooting has never marked the prelim
inary games of the baseball season,
but the bleachers have never with
held their applause for any brilliant
bit of playing. Last Saturday the
Stanford supporters sat silent on the
bleachers and watched their team per
form a hitherto impossible featâ€”the
winning of two straight games from
Santa Clara at the beginning of the
season. About twenty small boys
who accompanied the collegians gave
their team far better support than the
Stanford bleachers accorded to the
Cardinal nine. We have a team this
year which deserves the heartiest sup
port of the entire student body, es
pecially in the early preliminary
games.
