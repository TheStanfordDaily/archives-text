# PLANS ARE APPROVED
## TRUSTEES ACCEPT BLEACHERS FOR NEW TRACK. Plans Are Essentially the Same as Those of Stanford Field. Work to Begin Soon. 
### 
The University Trustees have at
last approved the plans for the new
bleachers, and the Board of Control
will award the contract for thei? build
ing at once. The plans were drawn
by Professor C. B. Wing, and are es
sentially the same as those drawn by
him for Stanford Field. The seating
capacity of the new bleachers will be
about 2,500, and all the seats will be
011 the west side of the track in one
large block.
For the last two weeks the Commis
sion of Engineers have had rubble
carted and spread to form the founda
tion for building, and this should
enable the contractor to rush the
work, finishing it in ample time for
both the interscholastic and intercol
legiate meets. The track itself is
practically finished and waits only for
the bleachers to make the field com
plete.
The Board of Control will formally
award the contract tomorrow. Its
members are practically decided as to
the successful bidder, but no an
nouncement will be made until the
articles of agreement are signed.
