# NO FRESHMAN DEBATE.
## Intercollegiate Contest Between First Year Men Is Killed By Debating Interests. 
### 
By postponing any further action
on the question, the Freshman De
bating Society last night practically
put an end to the negotiations for an
intercollegiate Freshman debate with
California.
The debating interests of the Uni
versity were opposed to such a con
test this semester and Professor C.
A. Duniway, chairman of the Faculty
Committee on Literary Contests, did
not favor a Freshman contest at any
time. He gave as his reason that
Freshman debating was little, if any
better than preparatory school de
bating and would not be represent
ative of Stanford. He said that there
was already too much crowded into
the second semester and that Fresh
en would need all their time for other
work. He emphasized the fact that
as there had been 110 formal challenge
sent there was 110 reason to push the
matter further.
