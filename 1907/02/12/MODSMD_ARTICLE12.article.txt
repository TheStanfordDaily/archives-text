Word has been received from W.
L. Greenbaum, in San Francisco, that
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra will
be on the Coast this spring, and there
are good prospects of persuading
them to give a concert here at Stan
ford.
In a letter to Professor C. C.
Searles, Mr. Greenbaum says: ''The
Chicago Symphony Orchestra of fifty
artists, with several soloists, and con
ducted by Alexander Von Fieletz, the
famous composer of "Elialand" and
a splendid orchestra conductor, will
visit us in April." A good house will
be necessary to pay expenses and Pro
fessor Searles desires those interested
to see him at once.
