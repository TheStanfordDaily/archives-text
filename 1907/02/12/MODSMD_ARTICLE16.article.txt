In an endeavor to make baseball
pay all its expenses this semester,
Graduate-Manager Sales is issuing a
score card similar to those sold oti
the grand-stands of professional
league circuits. The score cards will
be issued for every game and will be
sold 011 the bleachers for a nominal
sum. Aside from the usefulness of
the card itself, the innovation is one
which deserves the support of those
who attend the ball games. In past
years baseball has never suppported
itself, but has been kept alive by the
football surplus. This year, with the
renewed interest in the sport, it looks
a-, though the game would pay for
itself. The score card is published
by the student body and not by any
private enterprise, and as a student
body venture it is deserving of the
support of the bleacherites.
