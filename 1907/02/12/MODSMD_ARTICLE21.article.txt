# SECOND MEET FRIDAY
## CONTEST MAY BE HELD ON NEW TRACK. Classes of 1907 and 1909 Will Unite Against 1908 and 1910 in Handicap Meet. 
### 
The second preliminary meet of the
season will be held next Friday after
noon at 4:30. If the present streak
of good weather continues the contest
will be run off on the new track.
Both student volunteers and em
ployees have been busy sifting and
spreading cinders 011 the path and
run-ways, and if the sun only shines
for two or three days more, the re
mainder of the season will see the
new field used as the regular train
ing ground.
This week's meet will be another
handicap contest, the classes of 1907
and 1909 uniting against 1908 and 1910.
Such a combination generally results
in a close score and from the little
work done this year it looks as if the
coming contest would be 110 excep
tion to the rule. The present Junior
class is very strong in track material
and with the Freshmen to aid it,
should put up a strong fight against
the Seniors and Sophomores. With
the exception of the two-mile, which
will be shortened as before, the full
distances will be run Friday.
Last week's meet showed the mak
ings of a good lot of men to send
against California this spring. Once
the rough edges have been rubbed off
by Moulton's coaching and condition
ing, the aggregation should be ex
ceptionally well balanced, with classy
men in nearly every event. The old
men are swinging into form rapidly,
and by the end of this week will be
in shape to make creditable time.
