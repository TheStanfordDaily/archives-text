# Women's Hockey Practice.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Women's
Hockey Club this afternoon, it was
decided that blue sailor blouses
should be worn as a uniform by the
players during the coming season.
It is hoped that the grounds will be
ready for practice during the coming
week, when regular games will begin.
