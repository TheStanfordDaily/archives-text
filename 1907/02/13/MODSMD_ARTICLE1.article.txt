# EDWARDS AT SCRATCH
## SPRINTER MOVED BACK IN NEXT MEET. Captain Macfarland and Trainer Moulton Make Up Handicaps for Friday's Contest. 
### 
Track-Captain J. C. Macfarland and
Trainer Moulton have arranged the
handicaps for next Friday's meet.
The most radical change from last
week's handicapping is in the sprints.
Edwards, who recently finished a
time-trial in the hundred in but two
feet outside of 10 1-5, going back to
scratch, while Holman is moved for
ward a yard. Gardner and Roth are
the scratch men in the other heats.
Davis is again scratch in one heat of
the quarter, and Bennett will run
the full distance in the other. With a
smaller field to run through and a
longer distance to travel, Davis

Course, G. Knupp, '07.
Track-Captain J. C. Macfarland and
Trainer Moulton have arranged the
handicaps for next Friday's meet.
The most radical change from last
week's handicapping is in the sprints.
Edwards, who recently finished a
time-trial in the hundred in but two
feet outside of 10 1-5, going back to
scratch, while Holman is moved for
ward a yard. Gardner and Roth are
the scratch men in the other heats.
Davis is again scratch in one heat of
the quarter, and Bennett will run
the full distance in the other. With a
smaller field to run through and a
longer distance to travel, Davis
should make a close finish with either
Edwards or Elwell, who have four
yards each. The rest of the handi
caps are practically the same as those
of last week, which turned out pretty
races in nearly all events. The full
