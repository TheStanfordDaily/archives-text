# RACES AGAINST TIME
## INTERCLASS REGATTA MAY BE ON LAGUNITA. Each Crew Will Row Quarter Mile Against Timeâ€”Date Not Definitely Set. 
### 
An inter-class regatta will probably
be held on Lagunita in the course of
the next three weeks or so if ar
rangements can be completed. In
past years the inter-class races have
been rowed at Redwood, but owing
to the difficulty of reaching the course
and the consequent small number of
spectators, the Boat Club will prob
ably change the course to the lake,
in order that a larger part of the Uni
versity may see what the crews are
doing.
The races will be rowed against
time over a straight course laid out
011 the lake. This is necessary owing
to the smallness of the lake and the
fact that the club does not own two
similar boats. Heretofore a boat has
been borrowed from California. A
course a little over a quarter mile in
length can be obtained on the lake,
and each crew will be sent over this
course and timed. This kind of a
race will enable the spectators to note
the form showed by the older crews
and also the beginners.
It is possible that the races will be
delayed until the arrival of the eight,
so that the crew can be sent out
after the races for a trial spin.
The work 011 the lake is steadily
progressing, and Murphy is taking
out squads of new men in the barge
and gig and teaching them the rudi
ments of the stroke. The old men
arc being sent out in the shell, none
of the new men being allowed in this
boat for the present. A half dozen
new oars were ordered from Keenan
of Oakland, early this week, and these
will be delivered by the time the
eight arrives from the East.
