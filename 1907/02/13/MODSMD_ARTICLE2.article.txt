# DR. ABBOTT HAS LEFT STANFORD.
## Formal Resignation Is Received This Morning By President Jordan. â€” Plans of Law Department For the Future. 
### 
Professor Nathan Abbott has re
signed his position as dean of the Law
department of Stanford University.
In a letter received this morning by
the President's Office, Dr. Abbott an
nounced his intention to accept the
chair at Columbia to which he was re
cently elected. He stated further
that he had thoroughly considered
the change, and that he had decided
011 his present action only after long
and careful thought. He regrets
greatly leaving Stanford, but this last
offer was too flattering to allow of
further opposition on his part. Dr.
Abbott had already refused at least
three promising offers, one from Col
umbia, and the others from two lead
ing Eastern universities.
The news of Abbott's resignation
cannot be said to come as a complete
surprise. It has been feared ever
since the Dean went east last summer
on his sabbatical leave of one year.
But the announcement of Dr. Jordan
at the last meeting of the President's
Conference, that Dr. Abbott would
return to Stanford, was very encour
aging, and makes his letter of today
a source of all the more disappoint
ment.
Dr. Jordan said: "The resignation
of Professor Abbott is a matter of
the most sincere regret to every mem
ber of Stanford University.
He is one of the greatest of teach
ers, leaving the strongest sense of eth
ical duty in the mind of every law
student, and at the same time one of
the purest and most devoted of men.
We regret that lie should leave us
just now, when the University is pre
pared to strengthen the Law depart
ment on every side, and he would
have been in a position to reap the
fruits of a fifteen year's struggle
against difficult conditions.
At the same time, it is for him to
say where he can work most happily
and most effectively. We abate none
of our good will toward him now
that his field of work is to be in
Columbia instead of Stanford.
As for the Stanford Law School,
the two vacant professorships will be
filled with the two best men we can
find."
Professor Hubcrich, acting head of
the Law department, said in reference
to the resignation of Professor Ab
bott:
''The resignation of Professor Ab
bott is a great loss not alone to the
Law department but also to the Uni
versity at large. Professor Abbott
laid the foundations of the Stanford
Law School, and it is largely due to
his loyalty to the University and his
untiring efforts in behalf of the Law
department that the Stanford Law
department has become one of the
foremost law schools in the country.

Mr. Abbott added to his rare qualities
as a teacher and scholar a charming
personality and a true love and inter
est in the students who came in con
tact with him. Ile will be greatly
missed in the councils of the dqj mo
ment as well as of the University."
"It is especially to be regretted that
Dr. Abbott is leaving at a time when
the circumstances are such that the
Board of Trustees and other Univer
sity authorities have been placed in a
position to make liberal appropria
tions for the Law department, and
have shown by their recent actions a
marked liberality towards the depart
ment and have assured its future suc
cess."
"A large appropriation for the pur
chase of books for the Law Library
was made last fall, and we are assured
of similar liberal grants from year to
year hereafter. We have also the as
surance of the gift of a large and valu
able collection of British Colonial Re
ports and text-books. F'or the com
ing year the University has provided
for a permanent faculty of six men
in the department of Law. This fac
ulty is to consist of three full profes
sors and three associate and assistant
professors. Dr. Abbott's resignation
and Mr. Lewis' refusal to accept a re
appointment will leave two positions
of the rank of full professor to be
filled. Effort will be made to secure
the best men available. In addition,
it is confidently expected that other
lecturers on special topics will be se
cured. No changes in the curriculum
are contemplated, except the possible
addition of courses 011 California
Practice and 011 Mining and Irriga
tion Law."
Dr. Abbott left the campus last Au
gust on a year's leave of absence,
going directly to New York. Since
that time he has been a special lec
turer on Property at the Lavy depart
ment of Columbia University. Prop
erty is Abbott's specialty, and few
men have ever equalled him as an
authority on the subject. He gave
the course on that branch of the law
here and will presumably do the same
at Columbia.
Dr. Abbott received his degree of
A. B. from Yale University in 1877,
and his LL.B. in 1893 from Boston
University. He was professor of law
at Michigan during '91 and '92, and
professor of law at Northwestern
from '92 to '94. Since that time he
has held a professorship in the Law
department here.
As Abbott's advice is 110 longer
needed concerning the new Law pro
fessorship recently created by the
Board of Trustees, President Jordan
is actively engaged in looking over
the field of men possible for the chair.
Some definite announcement will be
made in the near future.
