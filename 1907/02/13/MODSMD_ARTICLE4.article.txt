# VARSITY LOSES GAME
## ST. MARY'S WINS BY SCORE OF 6 TO I. Consistent Hitting and Clever Base Running By Collegians Responsible for Varsity's Defeat. 
### 
The Phoenix team of St. Mary's
College downed the Varsity in the
opening game of the series this after
! 110011, by tlie score of 6-1. At hitting
' opportunely and on bases the visitors
outclassed the home team and to this
| was due their easy victory, added to
J the fact that the Varsity played very
loosely in the field.
Goodell and Daily worked through
| out the entire game. Goodell was
| not in his best form and although he
held St. Mary's down to but seven
bingles they were clean and at critical
periods of the match.
Southpaw Krause was too much for
I the Varsity. He struck out eleven
j and was invincible when hits meant
i runs.
The Varsity scored first in the third
j inning, Scott tallying on i\ long fly by
j Presley to right field.

Brilliant Game With Santa Clara.
For sustained interest and brilliant
I battery work the game yesterday sur
j passed anything seen on the campus
| diamond in some time. It is an un-
J usual thing for a Varsity game to go
I over nine innings, and added to this
! fact increased zest was given to the
| match with Santa Clara by the fact
j that as the innings lengthened out
J both pitchers seemed to be improv
! ing in form. The game was an out
and out battle between the twirlers
with occasional flashes of brilliancy
by the Cardinal infield. But one
error was made behind Witmer, a
poor throw by Fenton, and that was
excusable under the circumstances.
On the other hand the visitors bung
led three times, but this was offset
by the clever work of Captain Kil
bourn in the box, who was stronger
and steadier than ever when darkness
fell.
The Varsity took the initiative in
the run-getting, Scott crossing the
rubber. The Freshman second base
man was hit by the pitcher, stole sec
ond base and came home on a sting
ing drive by Fenton through the cen
ter of the diamond. In the fourth
Stott and Fenton drew bases on balls
in succession. On a hit and run play
with Presley at the bat Broderick was
was drawn off the first bag and when
Kilbourn threw to catch Presley the
ball went wild. On this play Stott
tallied. With two men then on the
j bases, Owen drove to Twohy who
I doubled the Varsity captain at second.
| Dennis ended the inning by flying out
jto left field. Often thereafter Stan-
I ford had men on bases but always
j failed of the necessary hit.
j Witmer was hammered hard in the
' seventh inning although faster work
| in the infield might have cut off one
,of the visitors' runs. Friene hit to
center field and on Owen's slow re
cover} - of the ball was able to make
