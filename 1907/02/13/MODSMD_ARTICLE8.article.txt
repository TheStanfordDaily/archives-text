Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
I have received from President
Jordan on three separate occasions,
three manuscript prayers. Why, I do
not know. They were sent to him
for his use, with the request that he
would not break the chain! Well, I
propose to break the chain, and ask
others to break it. The prayer chain
business is as superstitious a bit of
fake as the prayer wheel, and just as
effective. Moreover it is linked to a
lie. Bishop Lawrence has repeatedly
repudiated the authorship of this plan.
T therefore ask members of the Uni
versity to consign these documents
to the waste paper basket.
P. Charles Gardner.
