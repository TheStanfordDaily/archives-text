# KRAUSE IS AN ENIGMA
## ST. MARY'S PITCHER FANS ELEVEN MEN. Collegians Do Brilliant Work on Bases.â€”Goodell Pitches An Erratic Game. 
### 
The consistent, and clever work of
Krause, the speedy left-handed twirler
for St. Mary's, was the main cause
for the poor showing made by the
Varsity in yesterday's game. From
the opening inning he was an enigma
to the .local hitters and even though
they fell but one short of the number
made by the visitors, they could not
drive the ball out of the diamond at
the right time. For the rest Goodell
was erratic and his support was far
from good. However, perhaps the
greatest factor in deciding the game
was the pretty work of the collegians
on the bases. Time and again they
pushed runners around to the second
or third bags where they were within
striking distance when the man at
bat made a hit.
Fenton made a brilliant stop of a
hard drive in the first inning but later
hurt his record by loose handling of
a pop fly over third in the eight inn
ing. This error allowed Burns to
tally.
The master hand of Chase, the
American League star, on the bench
for St. Mary's, was evident through
out the game. He directed every
move of his proteges and called for
a hearty round of applause from the
bleachers when on a disputed point
he waved Captain Feeney back to his
position and volunteered the informa
tion that Coach Lanagan was right in
his contention.
