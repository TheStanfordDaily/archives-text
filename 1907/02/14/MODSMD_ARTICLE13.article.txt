The fencing of the baseball dia
mond has practically put an end io
the practice of viewing games for
nothing from the outfield, but it does
not seem to have checked the ob
jectionable crowding along the first
base line by spectators. In yester
day's game the first basemen of both
teams were hampered by men who
grouped themselves 011 the ground
near the base. On 011 c occasion the
Stanford baseman was Mocked while
going after a foul fly, by these spec
tators. Common courtesy to both
the home and visiting team should
put an end to this custom, but if that
if not sufficient the management
should take forcible means to keep
tlie spectators off the base line.
