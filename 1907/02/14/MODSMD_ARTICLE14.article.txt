The 1908 "Quad" manager has is
sued the customary statement of the
number of assessments collected for
the Junior annual. It shows that only
about one-half of the members of the
class have contributed their share to
ward making the year book a success.
The fact that the amount of the as
sessment has been materially in
creased, undoubtedly accounts for the
failure of many to pay it. The fire
in San Francisco has injured the field
from which "Quad" advertising is
usually gathered, and as 1908 is plan
ning a large annual, all the assess
ments possible will be needed. The
class elections are over, and it is too
late to deny those who have failed to
pay, their right of ballot. The only
appeal to the delinquent Juniors
which can be made, is that of class
patriotism.
