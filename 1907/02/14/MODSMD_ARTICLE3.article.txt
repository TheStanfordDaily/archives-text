# TRACK IS IN CONDITION
## GOOD PERFORMANCES MAY BE EXPECTED TOMORROW. Seniors and Sophomores Will Try Conclusions With Juniors and Freshmen. 
### 
A most interesting track meet is
promised for tomorrow afternoon.
At 4:30 o'clock the Senior and Sopho
more classes will clash with the Ju
niors and Freshmen in the second
handicap meet of the season. What
little prospect there might be of pre
dicting the outcome is destroyed by
the handicapping. Trainer Moulton's
judgement as to the ability of his men
was so ably demonstrated in last Fri
day's meet that it is safe to say the
result of not only the meet tomorrow,
but of every race, is very much in
doubt.
There have been slight delays in
the work 011 the new track, and this
accounts for the necessity of holding
tomorrow's meet on the old field.
The natural disappointment at not
being able to try the new field is
more than compensated for, however,
by the splendid condition of the old
cinder path and run-aways. Very sel
dom so early in the season has the
path had as much life in it as it will
have tomorrow, and spurred on by
the handicaps almost any of the men
wearing Varsity emblems may be ex
pected to clip a second or so from
their performances in the last meet.
Both Moulton and Macfarland state
that they have never seen men work
out so well in the early season as they
have this year. "It is not so sur
prising, though," said Moulton, today,
"the track is in the best condition 1
have ever seen it, and in combination
with this warm weather it is enough
to force anyone familiar with spikes
to make good time. With the ex
ception of the two-mile we will run
the full distances tomorrow, and we
shall see fast work even if it is early."
As in the last meet, the sprints and
hurdles will probably be the best
races. Edwards has run close to ten
one, with Moulton holding the watch,
and set a yard back of both Holman
and Vandervoort should find good
speed even if he does not break the
tape. ' The dividing of the quarter
into two heats will give all the con
testants a better chance, and the first
heat should provide some exception
ally pretty racing. Edwards and El
well have 4 yards the better of Davis,
and when these three men swing into
the stretch they should be close to
gether, and with a fight for the finish
left in each man.
Macfarland and Lanagan are step
ping the high hurdles in better form
every day. Lanagan is fast over the
sticks, finding the ground quicker than
Macfarland, but the Captain is speed
ier between them, and in all the work
outs this week they have taken the
final hurdle together. In the low
Macfarland will not be hard pressed.
