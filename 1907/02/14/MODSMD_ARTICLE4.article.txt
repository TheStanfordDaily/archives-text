# TO EQUALIZE TRYOUTS
## COMMITTEE AGAINST TENNIS SINGLES METHOD. Refuses to Sanction Constitution Submitted By New Club Until It Is Changed. 
### 
Through the action of the Exec
utive Committee last evening, Varsity
tennis men must compete for their
places on intercollegiate teams on the
same footing as all other aspirants
to represent the Cardinal. The Ten
nis Club submitted its new constitu
tion for approval by the Executive
Committee in last night's meeting,
with an appended description of the
method of tryouts. One clause was
objected to, as favoring men who
have qualified for past intercollegiate
singles teams. This section reads:
"In case any man who has made a
place on the Varsity singles team
in preceding years is in college at the
time of the tryouts, he shall be elig
ible for the round robin tournament
without playing in the three prelim
inary contests." The contests refer
red to are for men who have not
made former teams, the winner of
each qualifying for competition in the
round robin. On the reading of the
objectionable clause, the members of
the committee expressed their dis
approval and immediately took an un -
favorable vote. The whole document
was ordered returned, with the under
standing that the Tennis Club should
change its phrasing so that no as
pirant for the teams should be fa
vored.
The Executive Committee appointed
W. P. Fuller, Jr., 'io, official baseball
scorer. Fuller has been keeping the
score for the last two weeks and will
retain the position for the season.
