# DEBATE ON JAPANESE
## PRESIDENT JORDAN REPLIES TO MACARTHUR. Social Service Club Meeting Enlivened By Discussion of Coolie Exclusion not on Program. 
### 
A friendly debate 011 the Japanese
question between President D. S. Jor
dan and Walter Mac Arthur, editor of
the "Coast Seamen's Journal,'' was
the feature of the meeting of the So
cial Service Club, held at the Alpha
Phi house yesterday evening. The
debate was not on the program, but it
formed by far the most interesting
part of the proceedings. Mac Arthur
was scheduled to speak on the "Labor
Problem in the United States." He
started out with an interesting history
of the growth of the labor union
movement, and naturally enough
turned to a discussion of labor prob
lems in San Francisco. From this
phase of the subject the transition to
a discussion of Japanese exclusion
was easy.
"This is 110 question for statesmen
to decide," said Mac Arthur, "rather
it is one of races. Not the standard
of the San Francisco schools is the
issue before us, but whether or not
the Japanese or whites shall prevail
in San Francisco, whether twenty
years hence this fair State will be a
dependency of Japan, as Hawaii now
is. California must be a white man's
State, and we care not what measures
are necessary to maintain it so. If
we cannot preserve it in peace, then
trot out your war. A statesman may
wield the big stick, and send messages
to Congress but that will not decide
the question. The dominance of the
white race is questioned on this Coast
under present conditions and the yel
low man will be forced out by arms if
necessary.
"Now as for President Roosevelt,
he would give us a compromise, when
exclusion is the only possible remedy.
He is in a large measure responsible
for this critical situation. The Jap
anese and Corean Exclusion League
was proceeding with its work in a
calm and dispassionate manner, when
he submitted his famous message to
Congress. Then we were not so
calm. The President had switched us
off the moderate track.
"We of the laboring class have no
■objection to the Japanese gentleman.
He does not compete with us, and if
-the competition were between the
Japanese and American gentleman, I
would do what the American gentle
man is doing now, and run out and
•shout, 'Stop that agitation. Do you
want war?'"
Chaplain Gardner rose and pro
posed the usual vote of thanks for
Mac Arthur. In seconding this mo
tion, President Jordan made his re
ply to some of the speaker's remarks
on the Japanese situation.
"I am of the opinion that the much
-attacked message to Congress was
written by the President when he was
in somewhat of a temper," said Presi
dent Jordan. "He had just returned
from a long and tiresome trip to
Panama. He was fighting with sev
eral Senators, and the uncompromis
ing attitude of the Californians an
gered him. lam a hearty believer in

coolie exclusion, but I think the ar
rangements could best be made be
tween Tokio and Washington. We
should deal with the Japanese gentle
men with as much regard as they
show for us. They consider the
United States the greatest power on
earth. Great Britain tliey rank sec
ond and Germany third, with them
selves and France as the fourth
power.
"I believe now, that some treaty
will be negotiated whereby the Jap
anese will be prevented from coming
to the United States by way of Ha
waii. I have it autlioratitively that
Japan has been willing for some time
to make such a treaty, and that even
at the time the San Francisco school
question unfortunately arose, nego
tiations with such an end in view were
being carried on."
