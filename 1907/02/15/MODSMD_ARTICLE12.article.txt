The action of the Executive Com
mittee in refusing to sanction that
part of the new Tennis Club constitu
tion, which provides for the exemp
tion of Varsity men from preliminary
tryouts will probably force the Club
to do away with this objectionable
feature of the system by which Inter
collegiate teams are selected. The
Club was warned of the feelings of
the Committee on the matter, but ii
did not see its way clear to abolish
the old system. Just what reform it
will now attempt cannot be predicted.
The adding of another preliminary
tournament had no effect upon the
situation, and the tennis men will be
forced to some more radical step.
It is difficult to see why the Varsity
men should not enter these three
tournaments. The only objection
made by the Club to their doing so,
is that there is too much possibility
of the host men putting each other
out in the preliminary rounds. This
cor,id be easily prevented by an
arrangement of the drawings which
would keep the Varsity men separated
until the tournament had reached the'
finals. With this objection elimi
nated, it would seem that the Club
could arrange its tryouts so that they
would satisfy the requirements of the
Executive Committee.
