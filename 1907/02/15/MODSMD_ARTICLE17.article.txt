# Durand Designs Dynamometer.

### 
A paper by Professor W. L. Dur
and, of the Mechanical Engineering
department, on the design of a new
form of transmission Dynamometer
was read before the last meeting of
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers and elicited very favorable
comment. For the past three years
Professor Durand has been carrying
011 experiments for the purpose of ob
serving the actual results obtained
by the use of screw propellers of dif
ferent proportions and speeds, and
during the course of the experiments
he was led to design a new form of
transmission Dynamometer. This is
now being used for testing work in
the Mechanical Engineering Labora
tory, and a larger one, to transmit
40 horse power is being constructed.
Mechanical engineers are awaiting
with interest the results of the opera
tion of this larger model.
