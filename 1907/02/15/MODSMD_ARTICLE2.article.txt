first base; Scott, second base; Fenton,
third base; Cadwalader, short stop;

The Varsity will not play off the tie

out of the three scheduled games.
Seniors Win from Juniors.
The Seniors defeated the Juniors
yesterday afternoon on the Varsity
diamond by a score of 2 to 1 in a pre
liminary game of the interclass series.
Spaulding scored for the Seniors in
the first inning and Eby got home in
the seventh on a wild throw to third,
scoring what proved to be the win
ning run. In the last of the eighth
inning O. Lantz knocked a two-bag
ger and scored on a hit by Ellis, mak
ing the only run for the Juniors. On
■the whole the game was good consid
ering that it is the first played by
cither team this semester.
