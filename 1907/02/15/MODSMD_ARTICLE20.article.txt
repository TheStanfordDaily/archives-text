# THREE PRODUCTIONS NOW IN.
## Junior Farce Committee Receives Manuscripts From Well-known College Writers. 
### 
The last day for entering the Junior
Farce competition saw three clever
productions handed to the class com
mittee for their decision. The au
thors are D. H. Clift, '07, L. S. Levy,
'08, and P. C. Edwards, ex-'O6. While
at this date 110 information will be
given out as to the nature of the
respective plays it is known that all
are of exceptional merit and that the
committee is hopeful of being able
to present one of the best amateur
farces or operas ever seen on the
campus.
Clift's is a pure farce while the
other two are of the musical order,
the music also being original with
the authors. A decision on the man
uscripts will be made some time be
fore next Wednesday but no date for
the staging has been named.
