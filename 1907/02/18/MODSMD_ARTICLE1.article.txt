# WINS OUT IN TENTH
## VARSITY TAKES CLOSE GAME FROM PRESIDIO. Fast Fielding and Few Hits In Saturday's Contest.â€”Score 3 to I. 
### 
The Presidio team which lost to the
Varsity Saturday afternoon in a ten
inning game by a score of 3-1, proved
a great surprise to the bleacher fol
lowing, as it was generally supposed
the home nine would have no diffi
culty in winning. The soldiers have
one of the fastest infields which has
visited the campus in some time, and
Pizola proved to have no mean ability
as a twirler. He secured nine strike
outs and kept the hits well scattered
until the closing innings.
Opportune hitting by Gore, who
played center field, broke up the game.
In the eighth inning it was his safety
which helped to tie up the score and
again on a long drive in the tenth
inning which was good for three
bases, he was able to make the decid
ing tally when Owen singled to right
field. Cuenin also tallied on the hit.
Theile and Smith were each worked
five innings in the box, and had but
little difficulty in holding the visiting
batters safe.
A cold mist which later turned into
a rain, made the ground soft and
fielding difficult. Despite the unfa
vorable weather conditions there was
a fair crowd present.
