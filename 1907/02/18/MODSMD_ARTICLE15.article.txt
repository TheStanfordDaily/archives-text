California has partially consented
to another meeting of the Intercolle
giate Athletic Committee. It is to be
hoped that this is the first step to
ward the settling of the track dispute
either by mutual concession or by
arbitration if concession fails. The
difficulty which now stands in the way
of an attempted settlement, is the
qualification which California has put
upon her consent to another meeting.
She demands that the Stanford Exec
utive Committee will assure her of
its intention to abide by whatever
action the Intercollegiate body may
take. This raises another question of
interpretation of the agreement. It is
provided in that document that all
amendments passed by the Intercol
legiate Committees must be ratified
by the executive bodies of both uni
versities. Whether the word "Amend
ments" is intended to include such
actions as the submission of the track
dispute to the graduate managers re
mains to be seen. In any case the
situation has reached a point where
a meeting is a necessity and we
should be willing to concede a point
or two in order to gain such a meet
ing. The turn which the controversy
has taken is not reflecting any partic
ular credit upon either party in the
outside world, and the sooner and
more definitely it is settled the better.
