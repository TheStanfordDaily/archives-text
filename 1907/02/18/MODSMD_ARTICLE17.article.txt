# Stanford to Choose Question.
## 
### 
The question for the Intercollegiate
debate will be chosen tomorrow
morning by the University Debating
Club, with the advice of several fac
ulty members. This afternoon seve
ral hours were occupied in delibera
tion of a resolution suitable for argu
ment with the Uniersity of California,
but no satisfactory conclusion was ar
rived at and the subject was post
poned for decision till tomorrow.
Through an oversight the time spe
cified by the Intercollegiate Debating
Agreement was allowed to pass by
without submitting a question to Cali
fornia. This should liae been done by
last Friday.
