Trophy." There is a full-page base
ball drawing called "Out at First."

tures for the Children's Page, which
is a burlesque on children's pages.
Editorially the issue knocks se
verely the attitude of California on
the track question; comments upon
two incidents in the recent Sopho
more election; also what lias become
of the proposed "Interscholastic," and
boosts tlie coming Sophomore play.
