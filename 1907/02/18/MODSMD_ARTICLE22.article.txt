# WILL PLAY IN ALAMEDA.
## Stanford Tennis Men to Take Part in Washington's Birthday Tournament Across the Bay. 
### 
Four Stanford racket wielders will
journey to Alameda next Friday to
take part in the tournament of the
Alameda Tennis Club, which will be
played off Friday, Saturday and Sun
day. P. B. Delano, '08, and A. J.
Gowan, '09, last year's intercollegiate
doubles team, will play together in the
doubles tournament. L. Newland, '08,
and T. C. Henry, '10, together with
Delano and Gowan, will participate in
the singles. The foremost players of
San Francisco and vicinity will take
part, and it will be of the greatest in
terest to see how Stanford's repre
sentatives compare with them.
The action of California, debarring
Freshmen from intercollegiate con
tests, will prevent coast champion M.
Long from playing in the intercollegi
ate tennis matches. Long would have
made the team easily.
The dates of the tryouts for the in
tercollegiate team will be announced
in the course of the next few days.
The reorganization of the Tennis
Club and the change in the system of
tryouts have prevented an earlier an
nouncement of the dates of the pre
liminary tournaments.
