# CONSENTS TO MEETING
## U.C. WILLING TO DISCUSS SITUATION AGAIN. Sends Letter With Proposition to Waive Right of Revision By Executive Committee. 
### 
A letter from Berkeley was received
011 Saturday by Secretary C. R. Cri
der, '07, of the Associated Students,
in reply to the communication of the
Executive Committee requesting that
another meeting of the Intercollegiate
Athletic Committtee be held in an
attempt to settle the track meet con
troversy. It cafries the provisional
consent of the executive committee of
the University of California to an
other conference.
The letter follows:
"Berkeley, Cal., Feb. 14, 1907.
Mr. Clay R. Crider,
Sec. A. S. S. U.,
Dear sir: Your communication of
Feb. 9th was brought before the Ex
ecutive Committee at its regular meet
ing last night. The committee cannot
understand what object would be at
tained by another meeting of the In
tercollegiate Athletic Committee since
the matter of the Field Meet was fully
discussed and a conclusion arrived at
at the meeting of Jan. 26th, 1907.
Your Executive Committee refused
to sanction the action of your repre
sentatives at that meeting, and in case
of another meeting, we have no assur
ance that your Executive Committee
would not again refuse to abide by
their decision. Since your committee
insists on another meeting however,
we ;ire willing to comply with their
request providing they will assure us
that they will consider the decision
of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee final, and will agree to
abide by it.
Sincerely yours,
C. H. Ramsden,
Sec. A. S. U. C.
The stipulation of the California
letter is in effect to waive a portion
of the Intercollegiate Agreement, as
the Berkeley people want the execu
tive committee to "consider the deci
sion of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee final," and "to abide by
it." This would be to nulllify the
stated right of the governing body to
revise the action of its representatives
011 the Intercollegiate Committee
within thirty days after such action
is taken.
California evidently leaves to the
imagination what is to be done in case
the second meeting of the Intercolle
giate Committee should result in a
deadlock. Secretary Crider pointed
out this afternoon that California
might then fall back 011 the arrange
ment which she claims was made in
the first meeting, that the graduate
managers should interpret the merits
of the case for the two universities.
President C. F. Laumeistcr, 07, of
the Associated Students, said this af
ternoon that there would in all prob
ability be 110 special meeting of the
Executive Committee to consider the
Berkeley letter, as he "saw no neces
sity for it." It seems therefore, that
the Executive Committee will take up
the matter at its regular meeting next
Wednesday evening.
