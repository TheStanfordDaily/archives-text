# WORK ON NEW TRACK
## ATHLETES BEGIN TRAINING ON NEW FIELD. Cinders Are Not Yet Mixed With Earth and Only Light Work Is Possible. 
### 
Last Saturday morning saw the first
training 011 the new track, all the men
working out lightly because of the
soft condition of the cinder path.
The cinders are not thoroughly mixed
with the earth yet, and as a conse
quence the path shows a disposition
to cup-out under the long spikes of
the sprinters. The covering for the
new track is also unsatisfactory in
that it resembles moist ashes rather
than cinders, but it is an interesting
fact that while the old field was a sea
of mud last Saturday, the new cinder
path, although soft, had no water
standing 011 it, and could be used sat
isfactorily for jogging and other light
work.
Both "Dad" Moulton and Captain
Macfarland arc frankly surprised at
the showing made in the last meet,
and just about as pleased. "It's
rather startling, I admit," said Mac
farland today, "but I do not think that
such performances this time of the
year necessarily mean that the men
will be overtrained when the final test
comes. The way I look at it is that
every man is just that much better
than he was last year at this time.
"Dad" will see that no one works too
hard, and if there is any further im
provement we shall place a very fast
team 011 path and field to fight the
Blue and Gold."
From this time forward the candi
dates will train entirely at the new
field. The rubbing tables and all the
equipment were transferred to the
football training house today, and as
far as present plans are concerned the
old track will not be used again by
Cardinal athletes.
