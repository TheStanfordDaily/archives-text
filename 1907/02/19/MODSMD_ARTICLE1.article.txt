## SEMI â€“ PROFESSIONALS TO MEET VARSITY. Heitmuller Sends Line-up of His Team Which Plays Here Next Saturday. 
### 
A picked team from about the bay,
playing under the name of the Elk's
Club, of Oakland, will meet the Var
sity on the campus diamond tomor
row afternoon at 3:30 o'clock. While
no line-up has been received as yet
from the visitors, there will be many
of the same faces which have ap
peared under the Elk's colors for sev
eral seasons past. Hopkins, the two
Boettigers and many other well
known professional and semi-profes
sional players will appear and they
will 110 doubt give the Varsity a fast
game. Last year the home team took
two games from this aggregation, by
scores of 8-2 and 2-1.
For the Varsity the same infield
will hold which has played in all the
games to date. Coach Lanagan will
probably send Theile in to open the
pitching and Goodell and Witmer will
probably also take a turn. Daily will
begin the game at catcher and Stott
will also be played. The outfield po
sitions will be played by Owen in left,
Wirt, center, and Gore, right.
A list of those composing the
picked team which Heitmuller is lead
ing in practice games has been re
ceived, and from the class of players
their match with the Varsity on Sat
urday should without doubt prove
one of the best matches seen on the
local diamond this season. Nealon,
who created such a sensation in the
National League by his playing the
past season, will hold down first base.
The other infield positions will be
played by Spencer, of San Francisco,
Adams and Egan, the star of the
visiting Presidio team last Saturday.
Smith, the Oakland south paw will be
in the box, and the outfield will be
occupied by Hihlebrand, Heitmuller,
Williams and Devereaux.
