Quietly and with no particular
flourish of trumpets training on the
new track was begun last Saturday.
The second of the great athletic
fields which were planned by tlie
Training House Corporation has been
turned over for the use of the track
men. Saturday also marked the pass
ing of the old athletic field near En
cina. Its usefulness as a gridiron
ended when Stanford Field was chris
tened by the famous 12-5 victory, and
now its day as a track is over. One
of the Cardinal's two track victories
over California was won there, and
scores of preliminary games and
meets have been fought out on the
old field and cinder path. To the
present generation of undergraduates
and to those who have gone before
us there is much of sadness in the
passing of the old Encina Field.
