An interesting experiment in col
lege organization will be launched to
night when the men of Palo Alto will
meet to discuss plans for the forma
tion of an association. Approxi
mately three hundred men students
reside in Palo Alto, and for years
their cry has been that they had no
representation in the affairs or gov
ernment of the college. Thanks to
the energy and initiative of several
prominent upperclassmen, Palo Alto
is now to be given an opportunity to
show what she can do with an organ
ization. Representation in the Presi
dent's Conference has been granted,
and everything augurs well for the
success of the experiment. It re
mains now for the men of Palo Alto,
themselves, to demonstrate their in
terest in the plan by turning out and
backing up the proposed organiza
tion. Unlike Encina Hall, they arc
not bound together by the ties of

close association. If the new organi
zation is to be successful it must be
made so by the co-operation of every
man in Palo Alto.
