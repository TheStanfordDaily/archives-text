## Land Between Lasuen and Lagunita Is Being Surveyed.â€”No Official Action Yet. 
### 
It is possible that the land lying
between Lasuen street and Lagunita
will be opened up by the Board of
Trustees in the near future for a resi
dence site. No official action has
been taken in the matter as yet, but
it is known that the land in question
has been surveyed and platted and
estimates made as to the cost of grad
ing and putting in streets. This it is
presumed has been turned over to the
Board of Trustees, and their official
sanction must be given before the
land can be put on the market.
The addition to the campus would
be a large one and also an important
one, as the site includes some of the
most desirable land on the estate,
and it is known that one or two fra
ternities and a number of professors
are contemplating building there
should they be given the opportunity.
The land rises from Lasuen street to
the crest surrounding the lake, the
highest point being the knoll where
the old Spanish graveyard is situated.
It is rumored that this plot will be
taken by a fraternity if the section is
opened. The land is considerably
higher than the rest of the campus
and a fine view of the estate can be
obtained from that locality. The land
along the crest of the hill would be
especially desirable if the lake was
kept up by the authorities. If the en
tire addition is thrown open the cam
pus would almost double in size as
there is plenty of room for at least
three or four new streets.
