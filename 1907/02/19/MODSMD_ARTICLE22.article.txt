During the last semester the Ger
man Club read and presented, at
closed meetings, a number of modern
German dramas. Among these was

The entire play was produced, scene
following scene consecutively, during
several meetings of the Club. Act
ing on the suggestion of the German
faculty, it has been decided to present
the play in Assembly Hall, on the
evening of March 15. The cast of
characters is drawn entirely from un
dergraduate members of the Club,

ral of the people who aided in the

idly as possible, and with the amount
of experience already gained, the per
