# CREW MAY GO SOUTH
## LOS ANGELES WANTS REGATTA THIS SPRING. Boat Club Decides to Pay Back Money Borrowed From Student Body. 
### 
The Boat Club met last night and
decided to pay off the note held by
the Student Body, amounting to $60,
and also discussed the question of
getting a crew ready to send South
this spring to compete in the races
near Los Angeles. The money was
borrowed by the Club in order to get
Murphy out from the East in Janu
ary, and as the collections are gradu
ally coming in the Club is now in a
position to repay the money loaned.
The Boat Club received an offer to
go South some time this spring, be
fore the Intercollegiate Regatta and
where near Los Angeles. It was first
hoped that the race could be held in
eights but owing to the fact that the
Southern clubs have been unable to
get any eights it will be necessary to
hold the race in fours. The offer to
the Club was made by a land com
pany in Los Angeles, who offered to
pay the expenses of a crew to Los
Angeles and return and also put up
a silver cup as a trophy. There arc
several boat clubs near Los Angeles
who arc anxious to compete against
Northern crews and it is possible that
a crew from San Diego would also
enter, or else the San Diego clubs
would offer to pay the expenses of the
crew from Los Angeles to San Diego
and return. The trip, if it is taken,
would give the men good practice and
also make it possible to get some idea
of the form and speed of this year's
crew. The matter must first be
brought up before the Executive Com
mittee for approval, and if the latter
favor the proposition the Boat Club
will probably complete all arrange
ments in a short time. As the pro
posed trip would be without expense
to the Student Bady it is likely that
the matter will be approved, as it will
aid the Boat Club considerably and
also increase the interest in boating.
Arrangements will be made by the
Boat Club to rebuild the boat house
at Redwood, which was badly dam
aged by the recent storm. The ends
of the house were blown out and one
end of the building was blown off
its foundation. Considerable work
will have to be done and the house
will also have to be enlarged and
lengthened to hold the eight when it
arrives.
The eight should arrive here within
the next two weeks and in the mean
while arrangements will be made for
transporting it from the city to the
campus. The box in which the shell
is shipped is over 60 feet long, and
it will he a matter of some difficulty
to get it down here inasmuch as it
will cost more than the Boat Club
cares to pay to bring the boat down
on flat cars. The shell will be kept
at the lake for a month or so, after
which time it will be moved to Red
wood, where the crews will train dur
ing the last of the season.
