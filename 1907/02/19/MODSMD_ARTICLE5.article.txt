# DATE IS SET FORWARD
## JUNIOR DAY WILL BE HELD ON MARCH 22. Fact That Good Friday Falls on 29th Causes Change in Date of 1908 Festivities. 
### 
Junior Day will be held this year a
week earlier than has been customary
in years gone by. Friday, March 22,
is the date announced today by the
Junior Day Committee. President
Jordan is agreeable to the change, and
will grant the usual holiday on the
22cl instead of on the 29th, as has
usually been the case.
The change was necessitated by the
fact that March 29 is Good Friday,
and it was deemed hardly advisable
to hold the Junior Prom 011 the night
of the greatest religious fast observed
by the Christian Church. In conse
quence the Junior farce will be played
011 the evening of March 21 and the
22d will be devoted to the usual Ju
nior Day festivities, winding up with
the Prom in the evening.
The change will bring Junior fes
tivities on the day before the Inter
scholastic Track Meet, which is
scheduled for March 23, and will be
of additional value for that reason.
The preparatory school athletes usu
ally arrive on the campus the day
before the meet, and this will give
them an opportunity to witness the
Junior Day festivities. No definite
arrangements for the program of the
day have yet been announced by the
committee, but it is understood that
the program will contain many novel
events. Even at this early date a
great deal of interest is being taken
in the Prom and the demand for
tickets will probably break all rec
ords. The Farce Committee will
award the sixty-dollar farce prize to
morrow, and preparations will be
made at once for the staging of the
production.
The change in the date of Junior
Day will mean that the usual holiday
on the last Friday in March will be
omitted this year and that Easter
vacation will begin one day later than
usual.
