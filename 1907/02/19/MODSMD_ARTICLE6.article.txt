# NEXT MEET WILL BE SLOW
## New Track is Still Soft and Fast Time is Impossible .â€”Scratch Meet Friday. 
### 
The surface of the new track is
slowly hardening, but the path and
run-aways are still comparatively soft,
and the first meet, which is to held
next Friday morning, cannot be ex
pected to give rise to the fast races
which were the features of the first
two contests of the year. But the
dedication of the new athletic field
will be full of interest from another
standpoint, for Friday's meet is the
first scratch contest this season, and
a true line on the men can much more
easily be gained than where the fin
ishes arc tampered with by the handi
capping.
The coming field day is an inter
department affair. The full distances
will be run in all events except the
two-mile, which will probably be
shortened to seven laps, instead of
six as in the last competition.
