# QUESTION FOR DEBATE
## STANFORD SUBMITS INTERCOLLEGIATE SUBJECT. Roosevelt's Centralization of Power in Federal Government Will Be Discussed With California. 
### 
The question which will be debated
at the annual intercollegiate contest
with California this spring is, "Re
solved, That the Efforts of President
Roosevelt to Extend the Powers and
Functions of the Federal Govern
ment Should Not be Approved by the
American People." This question
was chosen after much deliberation
by the University Debating Club and
was finally agreed upon at a special
meeting this morning.
The subject for debate will be sub
mitted to California at once, and the
debaters there will have two weeks in
which to choose the side of the ques
tion which they wish to uphold.
While the question chosen is some
what general in nature, it is one of
immediate interest and one on which
present developments continue to
throw new light and awaken deeper
interest.
As yet no arrangements have been
made for the tryouts to select the
Intercollegiate Team. The Intersoci
cty Debating League will meet within
a few days to make arrangements for
the necessary preliminary debates
which will be on the subject chosen
for the intercollegiate discussion.
