The project of the Interscholastic
Company of Los Angeles, to publish
a quarterly magazine has been aban
doned as far as the present Board of
Editors is concerned. The abandon
ment of the plans for the publication
of a magazine on so elaborate a scale
was necessitated by the illness of S.
S. Smith, '07, business manager, two
weeks prior to the proposed date of
publication, and by the lack of proper
support on the part of the high
schools of the State. Plans are under
consideration for a less extensive
