# PALO ALTANS MEET
## TAKE FIRST STEPS TOWARD ORGANIZATION. Committee is Appointed to Draw up Constitution.â€”Herron Acting Chairman. 
### 
Responding to the call for a meet
ing recently issued, a large number of
representative Palo Alto men gath
ered in the Congregational Church
last night and took the first definite
steps toward the long-talked of or
ganization of the students who reside
in Palo Alto. In the absence of L.
Newland, '08, W. F. Herron, '08, acted
in the capacity of temporary chair
man.
In stating the purpose of the meet
ing, Herron reviewed briefly the well
known grievances of the Palo Alto
students, and the consequent need for
organization. He noted that under
the existing state of affairs, the Palo
Alto men were distinctly out of the
way as to being in the fullest sense
Stanford men. He deprecated the
meagre representation allowed a body
of their number and concluded by
summarizing the means whereby it
is hoped a change from these condi
tions will be brought about. In the
first place it is aimed to establish a
centralized meeting place, such, as
Eno ; .a ciub room, where the students
may become better acquainted, and
secondly, a more adequate representa
tion in student body activities will be
sought for.
The chairman appointed a commit
tee, composed of D. V. Marceau, '08,
L. H. Bennett, '08, C. Reining, '09,
F. W. Weymouth, '09, and R. W. Mc-
Elroy, '08, to draw up a constitution.
This committee will report at the next
meeting, for which no specific time
was set, but which will take place at
the call of the chairman. The elec
tion of officers, adoption of the con
stitution and the nomination of dele
gates to the President's Conference,
will occur at that time.
