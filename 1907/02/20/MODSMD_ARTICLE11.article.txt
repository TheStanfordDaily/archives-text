# ELKS WIN POOR GAME
## VARSITY LOSES BY SCORE OF 4 TO 1. Visitors Have no Team Work But Poor Playing by Cardinal Team Loses Game. 
### 
Four runs in the seventh inning 011
a combination of hits and poor work
by the Cardinal infield and battery
gave the Oakland Elks a victory over
the Varsity this afternoon in one of
the loosest and most poorly played
games seen on the campus diamond
this season. While a number of the
visitors were experienced players they
had no team work. Goslinski did but
inferior work in the box and there
was hardly any excuse for the loss
of the game.
The summary follows:
Runs Hits Erorrs
Varsity 1 3 4
Elks 4 7 5
C. E. Sampson, '09, appeared for the
first time in a game this season, being
played in right field. He is still
somewhat crippled from the accidcnt
to his foot last semester and it will
probably be some days yet before he
can go into the infield. Sampson was
practiced for a short time last night
at second base and there is some spec
ulation as to where'Coach Lanagan
will put the former short stop when
he gets into perfect condition.
