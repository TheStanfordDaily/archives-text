The tournament committee of the

and decided upon the date of the
tryouts for the intercollegiate team.
'Ihc initial matches of the first pre
liminary tournament will be held Fri
day afternoon, March i, 011 the En
cina courts. Play will continue from
this date every pleasant day with the
exception of Sundays. The commit
tee, which consists of S. M. Salisbury,
'07, M. C. Burr, '07, P. B. Delano, '08,
A. J. Gowan, '09, and T. C. Henry,
'10, has decided to make a strict rule
to the effcct that a man must play
according to schedule or default. A
conflict with University work and
temporary physical disability are the
only excuses which will be accepted
for non-appearance.
The drawings for the first tourna
ment will be made by the tournament
committee next Wednesday evening
in room 155, Encina. All those de
siring to enter must hand their names
to Delano or Gowan by 5 o'clock,
Wednesday afternoon. An entrance
fee of one dollar will be charged.
As yet the Tennis Club has done
nothing to change its system of try
outs so as to conform to the rules
laid down by the Executive Commit
tee. The matter will be taken up in
the near future.
