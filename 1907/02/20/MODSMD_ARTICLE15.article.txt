The action of the Junior Farcc
Committee in making the tryouts for
the principal parts in the opera invi
tational will probably raise the usual
storm of protest from those who
imagine that such an arrangement will
mean favoritism in the selection of
the cast. When the 1907 committee
took, a similar action in rcspect to the
production of "Stanford —the Life
Strenuous" last year, criticism was
free and bitter. It was urged that the
members of the committee had too
many friends with dramatic aspira
tions to justify what was termed a
private distribution of the parts in
the play. The critics of this year's
committee, would do well to stop and
reflect before beginning their attacks.
The change in the date of Junior Day
allows, only a month for the selection
of the cast and the staging of "La
Serena." In that length of time any
elaborate system of tryouts such as
preceded "You Never Can Tell,"
would be an obvious waste of time.
The committee has taken -the only
action possible under the circum
stances, and by combining a chorus
tryout with the invitational selection
of the principals, it has established a
precedent which might well he fol
lowed in the future. One of the lead
ing causes for the postponement of
productions in the past, has been the
time wasted in trying out aspirants
who stood no chance of selection and
who were forced upon the manage
ment of the production by the work
ings of the tryout system.
