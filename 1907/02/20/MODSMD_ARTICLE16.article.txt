The fact that there has not been a
University Assembly for three weeks
is causing some unfavorable comment
in view of the announcement that
assemblies would be held more often
this semester. In defense of the Fac
ulty Committee on Public Exercises

it needs only to be pointed out that
their task is at best a thankless one.
If they endeavor to have assemblies
every two weeks, they are attacked
because the speakers whom they pro
cure are uninteresting and not worth
listening to. Tf on the other hand
they wait until the best men can be
secured and sacrifice quantity to qual
ity, the cry is raised that we are drift
ing away from the custom of hold
ing assemblies, and again the commit
tee is assailed. In the present in
stance, the committee seems to be
adopting the latter policy. On the
whole this seems more reasonable and
justifiable. Too many poor assem
blies will lead the students to keep
away altogether, and speakers who
really have something to say are none
too frequent in California. It is bet
ter to risk drifting away from the
custom than to destroy it altogether
by lowering the standard of the
speakers secured.
