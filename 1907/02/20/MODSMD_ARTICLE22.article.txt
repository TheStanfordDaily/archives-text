### 
Tickets for "You Never Can Tell,"
to be presented by the Sophomore
Class in Assembly Hall on the even
ing of March i, will be placed on sale
next Monday morning. For respect
ively one dollar, seventy-five cents
and fifty cents, the seats of the house
will be placed at the disposal of the
public through the University Book
store on the campus and at the Uni
versity Drug Company's store in Palo
Alto. A week from Friday night the
curtain will rise on the first act of the
Sophomore comedy at 8 o'clock.
The cast rehearsed the four acts
of "You Never Can Tell" yesterday
afternoon in Assembly Hall. The
players wore the costumes to be used
in the final presentation, so that the
affair partook of the nature of a dress
rehearsal. The action was stopped
only a few times by Coaches Gray and
Cross, and showed that these two
members of the faculty are rounding
the production into such good shape
that the college public will be afforded
a modern dramatic presentation 011
the evening of March 1.
A clever plot, laid at an English
seaside resort and involving the ex
pose of the family skeletons of the
household of Mrs. Lanfrey Clandon,
formerly of the Island of Madeira,
furnishes the motif for Bernard
Shaw's trenchant and witty handling
of the lines. The part of Mrs. Clan
don, who has driven her husband
away from herself and her three chil
dren, is ably taken by Miss P. N.
Rosenthal. The daughter Gloria, who
has been trained to her mother's gen
eral attitude along lines of thought
that might be pursued by an extremist
of the clubwoman type, is portrayed by
Miss G. Fleming. Her worldly views
are sadly shattered when she meets
the young and amorous dentist Val
tine, played by G. N. Richardson.
Dolly and Phil, the twins, keep the
play brimming with amusing situa
tions. Miss R. A. Roberts as Dolly
promises to be a star ingenue. C. I.
Spangler is the young man, old for his
years, who has assumed the position
of head of the Clandon family since
the withdrawal of his father.
Complications continue in the
search of the children for their lost
parent and involve the irascible
Crampton, played by M. O. Adams,
and the tactful waiter, personated by
C. L. Roberts. In the development
of the love affair between Gloria and
Valentine and the repeated attempts
made to reconcile Mrs. Clandon with
her husband, McComas and Bohun
are brought in to straighten out the
tangle. R. B. Nelson takes the part
of the former, while P. R. Johnson is
the solicitor, Bohun. Miss J. L.
French aptly plays the part of the
maid.
