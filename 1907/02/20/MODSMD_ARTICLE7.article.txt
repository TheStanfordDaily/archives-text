# WILL FORMULATE REPLY.
## Executive Committee to Consider Communication from California at Meeting Tonight. 
### 
Stanford's reply to California's let
ter of Saturday last will be formulated
at the meeting of the Executive Com
mittee tonight. California desires to
know whether Stanford's committee
will abide by the decision of the In
tercollegiate Athletic Committees, on
the track- meet dispute, no matter
what that decision may be. Just what
action the Executive Committee will
take in the matter it is difficult to
prophesy. Stanford, however, is
strongly in favor of a meeting of the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee in
order that she may present her arbi
tration proposition and in all proba
bility the Executive Committee will
be willing to make reasonable con
cessions to the Blue and Gold to
bring about such a meeting.
Aside from the reply to California,
the Executive Committee will prob

ably discuss the method of holding
tennis tryouts. As yet the Tennis
Club has made no move to do away
with the features of the system, which
were not approved by the Committee
last week.
