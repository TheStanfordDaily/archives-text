# LEVY WINS CONTEST
## HIS OPERA SELECTED IN JUNIOR COMPETITION. "La Serena," With Scene Laid in Honduras, Will be Staged by 1908 Class. 
### 
The Junior Farce Committee met
last night and awarded the first prize
of sixty dollars to L. S. Levy, '08, for
his opera "La Serena." The commit
tee also made arrangements with P.
C. Edwards, '06, to train the cast
which will be selected in the near
future.
The opera which was selected by
the committee has three acts and the
scene is laid in the capital of Hon
duras. The first scene is laid in the
city, the second is a plaza in the city,
and the closing scene is laid in the
mountains back of the capital.
The play was selected owing to the
excellence of the book and the dra
matic situations which the author has
brought into his plot. Most of the
music is adapted and the selected
songs which will be interpolated will
be the very latest, having been re
cently received from the East.
The selection of Edwards as coach
practically insures a finished produc
tion from the artistic standpoint, as
lie has coached several Stanford pro
ductions in the past. Edwards will
begin rehearsals as soon as possible
as but little over a month remains
in which to get the opera ready for
production. It is more than likely
for this reason that the coach and
committee will have invitational try
outs for the principal parts, and a
general tryout for the chorus will be
held in the chapel 011 Saturday morn
ing at 9 o'clock. Sword and Sandals
will probably have chargc of the
scenic effects of the production, and
the committee may decide to have
some scenery painted especially for
this opera.
Levy, who wins the first prize of
$60, has taken a prominent part in col
lege literary activities. He was the
author of the 1908 ring Ugly and also
won second prize in the song contest
in 1906. Levy is on the "Chaparral"
staff, a member of the English Club,
and was formerly on the staff of the
"Daily Palo Alto." He is a Law
major and registers from Reno, Nev
ada.
