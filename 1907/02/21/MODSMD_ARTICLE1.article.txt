# MILLER OUT TOMORROW
## VETERAN MILER COMPETES FOR FIRST TIME. Scratch Meet Will be Held in Morning on New Track if Weather Permits. 
### 
Trainer Moulton's "We'll have the
meet if possible," is in force for to
morrow's contest and unless it rains
np to the last moment Stanford's new
track will be formally dedicated by
the first scratch meet of the present
season. The distances were surveyed
yesterday, the paths are lined, and
the slightly slow condition of the
path is the only drawback to the con
test. But the lack of life in the new
field cannot prevent some very pretty
races, even if the time does not ap
proach that made in the last compe
tition. All men will break from the
mark 011 even terms tomorrow, and
in all events except the two-mile, they
will travel the full distance before the
winner breaks the tape.
J. O. Miller, '08, Varsity miler and
quarter-miler, is slowly getting back
into condition, and will be seen in
competition tomorrow for the first
time this season. It is not yet de
cided which race the veteran distance
man will enter, but it will probably be
the half-mile. All the men who have
been running in the handicap meets
this season are considered entered in
this scratch meet. The half and the
quarter will be divided into two heats,
as before, on account of the large
number in these races.
The meet tomorrow is inter-depart
ment, and from the indications the
pluralty of points will be carried off
by the Law department, as it gener
ally has been in the past. Macfar
land, Edwards, Lanagan, Aynesworth,
Ball, and a host of minor stars, are
members of this department, and their
points alone will go a long way to
ward victory. The Engineering de
partments have a number of good
men, but they are separated into so
many sub-departments that their
strength is lost.
The first satisfactory chance to get
a line on the men will be welcomed
by all. The sprints should be es
pecially interesting with every one
breaking from the same mark. Ed
wards, McNeil, Holman, Reed, Van
dervoort, and Gardner, have been
running together all week, and the
one who is just 011 edge tomorrow
will win, but by inches. 111 the hun
dred Edwards looks a possible shade
better than the others; in the two
twenty, Holman, if in as good shape
as lie was last Friday, will win, but
he has 110 distance over McNeil this
time, and has a hard finish before
him
Edwards and Davis from scratch
in the quarter should make a great,
race. If Miller enters the half the
race will be a toss-up between Sev
ery, Shelton and Miller, although it is
very doubtful if the Varsity distance
man has condition enough at present
to win from the other two. Nash
should take the two-mile, with Mc-
Grcgor or Shelton a second. All the
hurdle races have been run from
scratch this year, and tomorrow's race
will be no change, Macfarland and

Lanagan settling the high between
them, and the track-captain taking
the low as usual. The weights can
easily be handled by Crawford, and
the high and broad jumps by Sterling
and Aynesworth respectively. The
pole will probably find Lanagan hard
pressed by Kocher, as the latter is
vaulting better all the time. The
meet will begin promptly at 10.
The officials will be as follows:
Starter—G. F. Zimmer, '08; Clerk
of the Course—C». Knupp, '07; Judges
of the Finish—B. S. Allen, '07, Pro
fessor C. C. Searles, and H. P. Bitt

Dr. F. Angell, and H. L. Horton, '08;
Field Judges—S. B. Thompson, '07,
C. G. Atwood, '07, and C. R. Crider,

yesterday, the paths are lined, and
the slightly slow condition of the
path is the only drawback to the con
test. But the lack of life in the new
field cannot prevent some very pretty
races, even if the time does not ap
proach that made in the last compe
tition. All men will break from the
mark 011 even terms tomorrow, and
in all events except the two-mile, they
will travel the full distance before the
winner breaks the tape.
J. O. Miller, '08, Varsity miler and
quarter-miler, is slowly getting back
into condition, and will be seen in
competition tomorrow for the first
time this season. It is not yet de
cided which race the veteran distance
man will enter, but it will probably be
the half-mile. All the men who have
been running in the handicap meets
this season are considered entered in
this scratch meet. The half and the
quarter will be divided into two heats,
as before, on account of the large
number in these races.
The meet tomorrow is inter-depart
ment, and from the indications the
pluralty of points will be carried off
by the Law department, as it gener
ally has been in the past. Macfar
land, Edwards, Lanagan, Aynesworth,
Ball, and a host of minor stars, are
members of this department, and their
points alone will go a long way to
ward victory. The Engineering de
partments have a number of good
men, but they are separated into so
many sub-departments that their
strength is lost.
The first satisfactory chance to get
a line on the men will be welcomed
by all. The sprints should be es
pecially interesting with every one
breaking from the same mark. Ed
wards, McNeil, Holman, Reed, Van
dervoort, and Gardner, have been
running together all week, and the
one who is just 011 edge tomorrow
will win, but by inches. 111 the hun
dred Edwards looks a possible shade
better than the others; in the two
twenty, Holman, if in as good shape
as lie was last Friday, will win, but
he has 110 distance over McNeil this
time, and has a hard finish before
him
Edwards and Davis from scratch
in the quarter should make a great,
race. If Miller enters the half the
race will be a toss-up between Sev
ery, Shelton and Miller, although it is
very doubtful if the Varsity distance
man has condition enough at present
to win from the other two. Nash
should take the two-mile, with Mc-
Grcgor or Shelton a second. All the
hurdle races have been run from
scratch this year, and tomorrow's race
will be no change, Macfarland and

Lanagan settling the high between
them, and the track-captain taking
the low as usual. The weights can
easily be handled by Crawford, and
the high and broad jumps by Sterling
and Aynesworth respectively. The
pole will probably find Lanagan hard
pressed by Kocher, as the latter is
vaulting better all the time. The
meet will begin promptly at 10.
The officials will be as follows:
Starter—G. F. Zimmer, '08; Clerk
of the Course—C». Knupp, '07; Judges
