On January 22 the Mandolin Club
met to consider the reorganization of
the club for the present semester.
The scarcity of material in college
spoiled any chances for a strong club,
and the leaders very wisely decided
to dispense with the usual tryouts
and endeavor only to get the men
out for practice once a week in order
to have a strong nucleus from which
to build a club next year. Eighteen
men pledged themselves to attend
practice every Sunday morning.
These men were all enthusiastic over
the scheme, and their pledges were
accepted in good faith by the leader
of the club. At last week's practice
three men reported, and the record
for the two weeks before showed a
steady falling off in attendance. It is
to be hoped that the absence of the
other fifteen men from last Sunday'.-
practice is backed by some good ex
cuse. Otherwise their conduct merits
a severe rebuke. By pledging them
selves to help in the rebuilding of the
club, they gave the collcge public the
impression that they had the interests
of that particular phase of Stanford
activities at heart. For a time they
posed as unselfishly devoting them
selves to the preservation of the
Mandolin Club and they were freely
praised for their self-sacrifice. Tn the
light of recent developments ■ they
seem to stand convicted either of
gross negligence or of a desire for a
little notoriety. Upon them now rests
the task of proving to the Student
Body the sincerity of their intentions
by regular attendance at the remain
ing practices of the semester.
