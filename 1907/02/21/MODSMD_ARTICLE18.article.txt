# NEXT ASSEMBLY SOON
## DR. FARRAND EXPLAINS PRESENT DELAY. Desire to Obtain Best Possible Speakers is Cause of Present Situation. 
### 
In view of the note in the"Daily
Palo Alto" last evening upon the sub
ject of the University Assemblies, and
because of your courteous editorial
in defense of the Committee, I should
like to make a brief statement in
further explanation.
Whatever blame may arise through
a failure to hold the Assemblies reg
ularly, it should not be laid at the
door of the Committee on Public Ex
ercises. The entire charge of the
Assemblies has been turned over to a
sub-committee consisting of Professor
buzzullo and myself. In the absence
of Professor Suzzalo, 1 desire to take
all responsibility for the present situ
ation.
As intimated in your editorial, the
sole reason for not holding an As
sembly during the last week has been
the desire to obtain the best speakers
possible. Early in the month we
were assured of the presence in the
near future of George Kennan,
Franklin Iv. Lane, Lincoln Steffens
and Henry George. No one of these
men was, however, able to give us
any more definite assurance than that
he would be able to come some time
within the next two months. In view
of those facts, and believing that the
University community would approve
such a decision, we have waived the
regularity of the Assemblies for these
few weeks in order to meet the con
venience of the speakers mentioned.
If the students will accept this policy
in the spirit which your editorial has
shown, the Committee will be grate
ful.
Mr. Henry George, of the George
Junior Republic, is coming to the
University under the auspices of the
Social Service Club, and he will ad
dress an Assembly during the first
week of March. Whether any As
sembly will be held next week de
pends solely upon the other men men
tioned above. If any one of them
finds it possible to come to the Uni
versity next week, an Assembly will
be held. If not, it will be postponed
until a later date.
Very truly yours,
Max Farrand.
