# GAMES FOR WEEK END
## VARSITY WILL PLAY TOMORROW AND SATURDAY. Stanford Will Cross Bats With St. Mary's and With Heitmuller's Stars. 
### 
Two hard games will close the week
in baseball. At Oakland tomorrow
afternoon the Varsity will meet St.
Mary's College for the second time
this season and to win they must play
fast ball, for the collegians demons
trated last week when they won
from the Cardinal 6-1, that they are
one of the fastest teams in the State
at present. ,
On Saturday, at 2:30 o'clock in the
afternoon, the pick of the professional
players wintering 011 the Coast, under
the leadership of Heitmuller, will play
on the campus diamond, and they are
expected to put up the best ball of the
season. A feature of this game will
be the appearance of "Mique" Fisher,
the well-known character in Coast
League ball, who will umpire. Fisher
has a wide reputation as a unique
figure in baseball and his presence is
expected to prove a drawing card.
Theile and Daily will compose the
battery against the college team to
morrow. The infield will remain the
same and Owen, Gore and Sampson,
will play the outfields. Against the
leaguers on the following afternoon
the only change will be the substitu
tion of Goodell in the box.
Twelve New Games on Schedule.
Twelve other games have been
added by Manager Sales, completing
the preliminary schedule. This in
cludes the last of the opening series
with St. Mary's, which will be played
on the 27th of the present month, and
a second series of three games each
with Santa Clara and the Phoenix
nine. Besides these Sales promises
matches with St. Vincent's college, of
Los Angeles, and Ireland's Inde
pendents.
There is yet some doubt it seems
concerning the date with St. Vincent's
college. The southern school is con
sidering a trip through this part of the
State and the Stanford game is pro
visional in case such a tour is made.
The new dates are: Independents,
March 6, campus; Santa Clara, March
7, Santa Clara; St. Vincent's, March
18, campus; St. Mary's, March 27,
campus.
