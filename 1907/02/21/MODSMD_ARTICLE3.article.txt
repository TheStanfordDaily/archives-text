# JUNIOR DAY PROGRAM
## CLASS LISTENS TO COMMITTEE REPORTS. Interclass Races and Aquatic Sports on Lagunita Will be Features of Festivities. 
### 
The Junior Class met this afternoon
to hear the reports of the various
Junior Day committees appointed
early this semester. Owing to the
fact that the end of the Lenten sea
son occurs at the time the Junior
festivities were scheduled, Junior Day
has been set forward a week, and will
consequently occur 011 March 22, in
stead of March 29.
C. C. Johnson, chairman of the
junior Day Committee, reported that
the baseball game which usually oc
cured on Junior Day, would not take
place this year, but that instead the
interclass boat races would be held
on the lake in the afternoon. In this
connection there will also be canoe
races, tilting contests, and a full af
ternoon of aquatic sports. The de
tails of the matter have not been
worked out as yet, but.the committee
is actively engaged in working up
the program for that afternoon.
Oy the same evening the Junioi
Prom will take place, and chairman
F. W. Turner reported that the work
of getting ready for the dance is well
under way. The music and the sup
per will be especially looked after by
the committee, and the class has been
given permission to have the supper
after the dance, so that the dancing
will last until midnight. W. C. Shel
ton, '08, was the lowest bidder for
the supper, and consequently was
awarded the contract. The commit
tee has also decided to have the sup
per, which will be served after mid
night, in the Stanford Inn, where
better accommodations and facilities
are to be found for handling a crowd
than in Encina Hall. The tickets for
the Prom will be placed on sale early
next month and will probably be the
same price as in the past. The num
ber will no doubt be limited.
E. J. Swift reported as chairman
of the Junior Opera Committee, and
outlined the work of the committee,
which has already been published.
The tryout for the chorus will occur
on Saturday morning at 9 o'clock, in
the chapel, and the invitational try
out for the principals will commence
on Monday. There is scarcely a
month left in which to get the opera
ready and things will be rushed as
much as possible.
The auditing committee of the
class reported that there was $88 in
the treasury at present. The only
other business of importance taken up
by the class was the decision reached
to let the matter of appropriating
funds for the permanent class secre
taryship lie over until next year, or
until after the Senior circus, at which
time the class should have ample
funds for the purpose.
