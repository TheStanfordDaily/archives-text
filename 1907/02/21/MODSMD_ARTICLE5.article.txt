# WANTS NO CONDITIONS
## COMMITTEE SENDS REPLY TO CALIFORNIA. Suggests February 28 as Date for Second Conference on Track Meet Controversy. 
### 
Measures looking to a second meet
ing of the intercollegiate represent
atives of Stanford and California were
taken by the Executive Committee
last evening. Secretary C. R. Crider,
'07, was instructed to write the sec
retary of the associated students of
the University of California and ex
plain Stanford's view of the present
situation in the track meet contro
versy in detail.
The Executive Committee states
that as another meeting of the Inter
collegiate representatives is necessary
to determine the relations of Califor
nia and Stanford on the track meet
question, California should be willing
to agree to another meeting without
conditions. The letter to California
recites the power of the student ex
ecutive committees, stated in the In
tercollegiate Agreement, to revise the
actions taken by their representatives
in the Intercollegiate Conference.
On these grounds the Executive
Committee holds out for a second
meeting of the delegates under the
provisions of the agreement.
Secretary Crider wrote to Califor
nia this morning, suggesting that a
second conference be held in San
Francisco on February 28. The next
regular meeting of California's exec
utive committee will be held Wednes
day evening, February 27. Unless a
special meeting of the California body
is held to consider the letter dis
patched this morning, no further ac
tion is likely to be taken by either
university until that date.
