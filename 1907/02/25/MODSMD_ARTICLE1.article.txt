# LANAGAN HAS RESIGNED.
## Coach Writes Letter to Executive Committee Asking to Be Relieved From Duty at Close of Baseball Season. 
### 
Like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky came the announcement this
afternoon that James F. Lanagan, '00, four year's coach of the Varsity
football and now in the third year of his coaching in baseball, would this
evening tender to the Executive Committee a resignation from his three
year contract, as head coach of the two sports, which he would abso
lutely refuse to reconsider. Since last September, the coach says, he has
had this move under consideration and having weighed the matter thus
thoroughly there is no possibility of a reconsideration. The resignation is
to take effect at the end of the present baseball season.

111 health and the possibility of a
complete break-down were the main
reasons given by Lanagan for this
action and in addition he said that
he had never been able to give proper
attention to the work of coaching.
Before a special meeting of the
Executive Committee this evening
Lanagan will explain fully the reasons
for his desire to withdraw from serv
ice as head coach a year before his
contract with the student body ex
pires. That he deeply regrets the
move is known and probably he will
tell the Executive Committee little
more than was expressed in the brief
words with which he gave his resig
nation to publication this afternoon.
"This act has become an absolute
necessity with me. I can never stand
to go through another football sea
son as the last and now when I hand
in my resignation to take effect at the
conclusion of the present semester,
I do it fully determined not to recon
sider. This has been in my mind
since last September and I have

weighed the whole question till I am
fully determined in my own mind."
"And there are certain other rea
sons which strengthen me in this
resolution that I do not care to dis
cuss. I feci somewhat that I am an
old story about here and I know that
I have never been able to devote suf
ficient time to my studies. My plans
are not to leave Stanford but to con
tinue my studies in law next year."
It is felt that the Executive Com
mittee under the circumstances, can
not but acccpt Lanagan's resignation,
and this was the general sentiment
among those members who could be
seen this afternoon. The letter of
resignation follows:
Executive Committee L. S. J. U.,
Gentlemen: I hereby request that
you release me from the contract to
coach next year. I do not believe
that I can stand the strain of another
football season.
Respectfully submitted,
James Lanagan.
The three-year contract from which

Mr. Lanagan has asked to be re
leased was signed in February, 1905.
It included an agreement to coach
baseball and football for three years
expiring in the spring of T9OB. Pre
vious to this Lanagan coached the
1903 Varsity which played California's
veteran eleven to a standstill in the
6 to 6 game, and the 1904 Varsity
which won the 18 to o game. After
signing the contract Lanagan lead the
12 to 5 team to a hard-fought victory,
and wound up his football career by
turning out a winning Rugby fifteen
this season, although he had no pre
vious acquaintance with the game.
In baseball Lanagan coached only
one season—that of 1906 —during
which he turned out a team which
won and lost to California, in the
undecided series. Lanagan graduated
from Stanford in 1900. He played
full-back in his Freshman football
team, but his physician's orders pre
vented him from participating any
further in that branch of athletics.
Later he won his Varsity emblem as
pitcher, in which position he made
a brilliant record.
After graduation Lanagan became
a teacher at Belmont School, where
lie coached the football and baseball
teams with great success. From there
he came to Stanford under the tliree
year contract, and registered in the
Law department in addition to coach
ing the teams
The effect on Stanford athletics of
this sudden resignation can hardly
be calculated. While it was expected

in the course of events next year, yet
it was hoped that another year with
the famous coach at the helm would
place Rugby on a firm footing and
would instill the never die fighting
I spirit into Varsity baseball which
! has been characteristic of the four
! football teams which Lanagan has
| developed. The necessity for the im
mediate casting about for a new in
structor in Rugby is apparent to ev
eryone and that it will be no easy
task to find a competent successor to
Lanagan as an instructor of any kind
of football is a fact which needs not
the saying.
From such as are acquainted with
the news of the resignation this after
noon came expressions of extreme re
gret that the University was to lose
Lanagan's services so unexpectedly.
"This is almost a calamity to Stan
ford athletics," said Dr. Angell.
"Mr. Lanagan's methods were emi
nently clean and decent and all must
be grieved to hear of his determina
tion to leave. The coach was held in
the highest esteem by the Faculty
Committee and I am inclined to some
hopes that he may yet be induced to
remain under the contract."
Football Captain Stott was em
phatic in the statement that Lanagan
must be retained under any circum
stances.
"We must have him, that is all
there is to it. If it is a question of
health, we must provide three or four
assistant coaches. He must stay if
only to he on the field."


James F. Lanagan
