# NEW ZEALANDERS MAY COME.
## Rugby Union Votes Five Thousand Dollars Toward a California Trip. 
### 
An Associated Press dispatch from
Wellington, New Zealand, states that
the executive committee of the New
Zealand Rugby Football Union has
offered to give $5,000 toward the ex
penses of a team to play in Califor
nia. It will be remembered that
President Jordan received, about the
middle of last January, a letter from
a prominent New Zealander, in which
the suggestion was made that Stan
ford should send a Rugby team to the
islands some time during the coming
summer. This communication was
followed a little later by a letter from
Referee Unmack, stating that he was
in receipt of a letter from Australia,
in which the Australians expressed
their desire to visit Stanford and Cali
fornia with a Rugby fifteen next fall.
The recent Associated Press dis
patch seems to indicate that New
Zealand has given up the plan of hav
ing a visiting team this summer, and
is thinking seriously of sending a
team to California instead. If both
the Australian and New Zealand
Rugby enthusiasts finally decide upon
sending teams Stanford and Califor
nia will be in a very good position for
interesting preliminary games.
