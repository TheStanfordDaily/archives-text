# NO HOLIDAY ON THURSDAY.
## Anniversary of Mrs. Stanford's Death Will be Marked by Simple Services. 
### 
Thursday, February 28, the second
anniversary of Mrs. Stanford's death
will not be observed as a University
holiday. Last year University exer
cises were suspended for the day but
this anniversary will be observed
more quietly. Reverend D. C. Gard
ner is arranging for the commemo
rative services, which will be held in
the afternoon at the Mausoleum.
The chaplain expects to have the
services as simple as possible, but he
is trying to arrange with the musical
clubs to assist in singing the hymns.
Further announcement of the pro
gram will be made later.
