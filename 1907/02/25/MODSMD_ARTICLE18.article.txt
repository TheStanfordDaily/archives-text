## 
### 
The German Club comcdy, "Minna
von Barnhelm," to be given in As
sembly Hall on Marcb 15, is being
costumed by Sword and Sandals.
The stage setting and the whole at
mosphere of the play will be made as
completely German as possible.
The comedy, if presented entirely
as in the original, would be too dis
tinctively German to appeal to an
audience with but an inadequate
knowledge of the language. It has
been thought best therefore, to cut
out all the unessential details, thus
shortening the time of stage action
from three to about two hours. Pio
fessor Rendtorff, of the German de
partment, has been greatly instru
mental in preparing the play for pro
duction. 'The cast is now almost
completed and will be announced
within the course of a few days.
