# CHANGE IN INTERCLASS
## FINALS WILL NOT BE PLAYED THIS WEEK. Varsity Schedule is Uncertain as St. Mary's Has Cancelled Wednesday's Game. 
### 
The interclass baseball series has
been set forward indefinitely because
of the fact that there yet remain four
preliminary games to be played. Ac
cording to the schedule prepared
early in the season the Sophomores
and Freshmen were to play tomorrow
in the first of the final games and on
Saturday next the upper classes were
to meet. The recent inclement
weather, however, has broken up the
schedule of preliminary matches so
that it will not be possible to fill these
dates as planned. As soon as the
four tryout matches can be played off
the final series will be held.
The Varsity schedule for this week
is also somewhat upset. Rain pre
vented holding the contests with St.
Mary's collcge and Heitmuller's team
on Friday and Saturday last, respect
ively, and the scheduled game with
St. Mary's for next Wednesday lias
been declared off because the col
legians will be playing in the southern
part of the State at that time. Grad-
anager Sales is now negotiat
ing to bring Heitmuller's team of pro
fessionals down on that afternoon but
the date has not yet been definitely
closed. The Gallagher-Marsh team
is booked to play on the campus next
Saturday afternoon.
