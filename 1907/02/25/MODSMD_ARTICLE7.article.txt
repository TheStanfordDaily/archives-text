Thursday is the second anniversary
of the death of Mrs. Jane Latlirop
Stanford. In her memory services
will be held at the Mausoleum in the
afternoon. It is to be hoped that the
student body attendance at those
services will far exceed that of last
year, when about twenty-five gathered
at the tomb to honor the memory of
the mother of the University. At
tendance at these services cannot be
made Compulsory, but the sense of
gratitude to Mrs. Stanford should be
deep enough in the heart of every
Stanford man and woman to make the '
journey to the Mausoleum on Thurs
day a privilege rather than a duty.
