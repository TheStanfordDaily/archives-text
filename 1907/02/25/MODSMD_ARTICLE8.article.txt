Editor "Daily Palo Alto";
Kindly permit me the use of your
columns to express my approval' of
the manner in which the Sophomore
play committee conducted the sale
of tickets for "You Never Can Tell."
Heretofore it has always been the
custom for a play committee to take
out a large block of choice seats for
itself and friends before the regular
advertised sale.
The 1909 play committee however
saw fit to give the University public
a square deal. When the sale of
seats commenced this morning those
who stood in line were agreeably sur
prised to discover that none of the
seats had been previously laid aside.
The 1909 play committee has insti
tuted a precedent that others will do
well to follow.
