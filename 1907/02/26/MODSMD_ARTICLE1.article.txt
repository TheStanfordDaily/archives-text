# ALL STARS TOMORROW
## HEITMULLER'S TEAM WILL PLAY VARSITY. Sampson Goes in at Second Base Tomorrow and Scott Will Play in Outfield. 
### 
The postponed game with the all
star team of professionals under the
leadership of Heitmuller, will be
played on the campus diamond to
morrow afternoon at 3:30. Nealon,
Hildebrand, Baum, Dashwood and
Schimpf are some of the well-known
leaguers who will play with the visit
ors.
On the Varsity a notable change
will be made in that Sampson will for
the first time this season take a reg
ular place in the infield, playing at
second base. Scott who has held
down the second bag thus far will
go into center field, and in all prob
ability this arrangement of the play
ers will hold for the time being.
Owing to the injury suffered by Daily
at practice last night, Stott will catch
the entire game.
The teams will lipe up in the fol
lowing order: Varsity—Theile and
Goodell, p.; Stott, c.; Presley, (c),
Ist; Sampson, 2d; Cadwalader, ss;
Fenton, 3d; Owen, If; Scott, cf; Gore,

Catcher Daily is Badly Injured.
H. P. Daily, '07, substitute catcher
on last year's Varsity, was hit by a
pitched ball yesterday afternoon on
the Varsity diamond, and his left
cheek bone was badly crushed. He
was operated on last night at the
Guild Hospital by Dr. Wilbur and
several assistants. He was resting
easily this morning and will probably
be out within a week and on the dia
mond in about ten days. Daily has
played in most of the games this sea
son, playing exceptionally good ball,
and his temporary loss will be greatly
felt by the team.
