Upon the unexpected resignation of
Mr. Lanagan, the Stanford Student
Body can be of but one opinion. We
must have the coach back next year if
it can possibly be accomplished. Be
fore accepting Mr. Lanagan's resigna
tion, the Executive Committee should
exhaust every possible means to se
cure a reconsideration on the part
of the coach. Mr. Lanagan has an
nounced definitely that he will not
reconsider and this will make the
task of retaining him doubly difficult,
but every effort should be made to
ensure the completion of his three
year term. If the nervous strain of
the football season wears too heavily
upon the head coach at present, he
must be aided next year by as many
competent assistants as are necessary.
Mr. Lanagan's presence on the field,
even in the capacity of consulting
coach, with no active part in the
working out of the men, means more
to Stanford teams than can readily be
estimated. No measures within rea
son should be overlooked to secure
his retention.
