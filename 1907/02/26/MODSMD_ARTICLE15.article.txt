# FORNCROOK IS QUALIFIED.
## Only Stanford Candidate Successfully Passes the Rhodes Scholarship Examinations 
### 
C. S. Forncrook, 'iv, registered in
the Greek department from Los An
geles, and the only candidate for the
Rhodes Scholarship from Stanford,
has passed the examinations and thus
qualified himself for the appointment
from the State of California. Presi
dent Wheeler, who is the chairman
of the Rhodes Scholarship Committer
in this State, received a cablegram
from the Oxford authorities stating
that five men had qualified in the ex
aminations. This list included Forn
crook, two men from the University
of California, one from Pomona Col
lege and one from Occidental College.
The successful candidates from the
two Southern institutions are resi
dents of Arizona. This fact qualifies
them from that State instead of from
California, leaving three successful
candidates from this State. The final
choice of one of these men is in the
hands of the Rhodes Scholarship
Committee for the-State of Califor
nia, which consists of President
Wheeler, for California, chairman;
President Jordan for Stanford and
Dean Norton for Pomona College.
President Jordan has been forced
through stress of work to leave to
the Stanford committee, which had
charge of the examinations, the ap
pointment of one of their number t.
act in his place. The choice of the
Rhodes scholar will be made accord
ing to the stipulations of the admin
istrators of the scholarships which are
for men who in addition to their in
tellectual fitness possess "a fondness
for and success in manly sports" and
general excellent qualities of char
acter.
In the near future it is expected that
President Wheeler will call a meeting
of the committee to pass upon the
three candidates.
