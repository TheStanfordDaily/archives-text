# CRUZAN WANTS REPLY
## LETTERS TO 1906 MEMBERS ARE UNANSWERED. Permanent Secretary Protests Against Lack of Co-operation by Members of Class. 
### 
Through your columns I want to
make a last frenzied appeal to the
now scattered members of the Class
of 1906, to kindly answer my requests
for information, as to their present
whereabouts, occupation, etc., as soon
as possible. During the last two
months I have sent out in the neigh
borhood of two hundred personal let
ters requesting immediate answers, so
that I would be able to complete my
class roll, and have received perhaps
forty replies. The Christmas grad
uates have' been particularly remiss
in failing to reply, and as I have seen
a number of them still around the
campus I feel reasonably sure that
my letters reached them. I know that
it has not been intentional with a
large number of the class members,
and so I am seizing this opportunity
of jogging up lagging memories.
There are two reasons why I am
particularly desirous of getting im
mediate returns from all the members
of the class. First, I am trying to
complete the class roll so as to be
able to tell exactly where all the (
members are. This knowledge is es
sential to the successs of the next re
union, as 1 am only delaying the ap
pointment of a reunion committee
until I hear from the not lost but
simply strayed, class members. Sec
ond, through the columns of the "Al
umnus." I want to make an annual
report, so that the class as a whole
can see what their various friends
are doing, and where they arc located.
This report, I had promised to the
"Alumnus" for the coming issue, but
owing to the negligence of the class,
I have been forced to delay a month.
All I ask is the hearty co-operation
of the class in the work, for without
that, the most energetic secretary is
as useless as a deaf and dumb man
suffering from paralysis.
Harold Ide Cruzan,
Permanent Class Secretary of 1906.
