## COMMITTEE STANDS PAT ON TRACK MEET. Intercollegiate Representatives and Track Men Discuss Controversy Last Night. 
### 
Stanford's position in the contro
versy over the place where the Inter
collegiate Track Meet is to be held
this spring was fully threshed out
last evening by the Executive Com
mittee in special session, and it was
decided to await a reply from the Uni
versity of California to the last letter
sent by the Executive Committee be
fore further action is taken. The de
cision of the committee was reached
after expressions of opinion by Stan
ford's Intercollegiate representatives
and leading track men from the three
upper classes. It is a practical reiter
ation of the policy already entered
upon by the Executive Committee.
The visitors present at last night's
meeting were R. W. Barrett, '04, D.
D. Sales, '06, and E. P. Stott, '07, who
constitute the trio of delegates to the
Intercollegiate Conference, and Track
Captain J. C. Macfarland, '07, E. J.
Nash, '07, F. R. Lanagan, '08, and D.
P. Crawford, '09, for the track in
terests.
The track meet question was fully
discussed from all sides, as it was the
purpose of the special meeting to
gain, as nearly as can be done, an
accurate knowledge of the opinions of
those who are most directly concerned
in the present controversy. The In
tercollegiate representatives were
fully agreed that Stanford was en
titled to hold the meet on her own
campus. They encouraged the com
mittee to maintain its stand already
taken and expressed themselves as
anxious to do all in their power to
bring the meet here should Califor
nia allow her delegates to confer with
them a second time.
The track men were all in favor
of holding the meet on the new track
but they want to see strenuous ef
forts made to effect a settlement as
soon as possible. They all faivor a
strong stand by Stanford, but they do
not wish the present dispute indef
initely prolonged. They will abide by
the decision made by the Executive
Committee.
Secretary C. R. Crider, '07, of the
Associated Students, has received no
word from Berkeley notifying him of
the action reported to have been taken
by the executive committee of the
University of California, in a special
meeting held last evening.
The San Francisco papers this
morning contain dispatches from
Berkeley to the effect that the senti
ment of the students at the State in
stitution is" in favor of placing the
matter of the settlement of the con
Â»
troversy in the hands of the faculty.
This attitude is taken by the student
daily at California and 110 official in
formation conccrning the present
status of the matter as it is regarded
by the Blue and Gold athletic author
ities has come to the campus.
