# Soft Track Prevents Meet.
## 
### 
The heavy rains of the latter part
of last week have made the new track
so soft that the meet which was plan
ned for this afternoon, had to be
postponed. Trials will probably be
run this week in order to give the
men practice in the harder and faster
work. From the present outlook the
Southern trip planned for the track
men will have to take place either
before the Interscholastic or not at
all. Southern California is planning
to send a team to meet Berkeley in
April, and this will take the Southern
athletes away from home at about the
only time that Stanford could send
men away unless they go before the
23d of March. The men arc in vcry
fair condition now, and Macfarland
is seriously considering taking the
team South at once.
