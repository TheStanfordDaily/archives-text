### 
The resignation of Head Coach J.
F. Lanagan, '00, was read before the
Executive Committee in a special
meeting called last evening to con
sider the track meet situation. After
the reading of the resignation, the
committee went into executive ses
sion and took the matter under ad
visement until the regular weeklj'
meeting of Wednesday evening. It is
probable that definite action of some
kind will be taken then.
Dr. Jordan made the following
statement about Lanagan's resigna
tion: "Everyone at the University re
grets very much that we should lose
the services of Mr. Lanagan. If by
any adjustment, it can be made pos
sible for him to remain with comfort
to himself, the adjustment should be
made. He has been of the greatest
service to athletics and to sound
sportsmanship at Stanford. He is
one of the very greatest of coaches,
not merely or chiefly in training men
to win games, but in leading them to
look on games and sports from the
standpoint of gentlemen. We realize
that Mr. Lanagan has the right to
give his full time and strength to his
chosen profession and that he has al
ready given the University far more
than he has been paid for. But with
all this, the athletic interests of Stan
ford still need him, and he cannot be
replaced."
"We can't let him go, and we will
do all we can to keep him from go
ing. That is as strong as I can put
it. We won't let him go." was "Dad"
Moulton's comment upon the resigna
tion of Lanagan.
