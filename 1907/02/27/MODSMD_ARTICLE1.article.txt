# TRIALS ON NEW TRACK
## MILLER AND SEVERY RUN FAST HALF MILE. Holman Shows Speed in the Hundred. Inter-Department Meet Next Friday. 
### 
"Dad'' Moulton held the watch 011
J. O. Miller, '08, for the first time this
season yesterday afternoon, and the
veteran distance man ran a dead heat
with Severy in the half-mile in the
good time of 2:06 3-5. Considering
that the track is still slow and that
yesterday was the first time Miller
has run his distance this year the
performance is high-class and pres
ages well for the Varsity man's speed
later in the season. The most notice
able thing about Miller's first race
was the lack of the fast finish which
used to be the great feature of hi>
running, but this was probably due
to lack of condition and he should
find his speed again later in the sea
son.
Probably the fastest time made in
the trials yesterday was the record of
under 10 2-5 seconds, made by Hol
man in the hundred. Holman showed
the same speed which he had in the
last meet when he finished a two
twenty in 22 2-5 seconds, and was fast
all the way to the tape in the shorter
distance. Edwards did not run in
these trials, owing to a stiff knee, but
Vandervoort was credited with 10 4-5
and Reed with 10 3-5 seconds.
Davis was unable to get under 51
2-5 seconds in the quarter, but the
soft track was partly responsible for
this rather slow time. Coonan fin
ished the same distance in 54 4-5.
Neither Macfarland nor Lanagan
tried fast work over the hurdles yes
terday, but I'easlec took the high in
17 flat. Nash tried a half-mile and
broke the tape in 2 minutes, 7 1-5
seconds, and Macready did the same
distance in 2 minutes, 11 seconds.
The inter-department meet, sched
uled for last Friday morning, will be
run next Friday afternoon at 4:30.
The new track is rapidly drying out
and should be in very fair condition
by that time. If the sun shines the
rest of the week the path should be
fast, and the men will doubtless begin
to cut down their time to compare
with the performances on the old
field.
