In another column will be found a
request from the Boat Club, that
those who row and sail on Lagunita
should take care not to interfere with
the workouts of the crew candidates.
The complaint is one which is made
every season, and usually with good
cause. Certain people who use Mi j
pleasure boats on the lake have a
habit of getting in the way of the
shell at every opportunity. Common
Courtesy to the oarsmen should make
repeated requests for a discontinuance
of this practice unnecessary. Lagun
ita is as much the training ground
for the crew as the new cinder path
or the diamond are for the track and
baseball men, and the Student Body
should recognize it as such.
