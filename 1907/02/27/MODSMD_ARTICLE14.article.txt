The communication from the Per
manent Secretary of the Class of
1906 is an interesting commentary
upon the usual fate of all schemes for
class organization after Commence
ment Week. When the scheme was
first proposed the members of the
Class of 1906 were lavish in their
praise and their promises of support.
The Secretary was assured that they
would co-operate with him to the best
of their ability in furnishing whatever
information he might desire for the
making up of the class roll. Since
then only nine months have elapsed,
and now the requests of the Secre
tary are answered by less than one
fifth of the class. Upon 1906 as the
originator of class reunions, rests the
success or failure of the whole plan,
and the entire system might as well
be abandoned at once, if the members
of that class cannot give their offi
cers the little personal assistance
which is required of them to keep
the reunion movement alive.
