# WILL REDUCE SQUAD
## MURPHY ELIMINATING POOR MATERIAL. Boat Club Expects That Eight Will Reach Campus Last of Next Week. 
### 
The Boat Club expects the eight to
reach the campus the latter part of
next week, and in the meantime the
boat house at Lagunita will be altered
to accommodate the shell, which is
sixty feet long. The S.S. "Arizonan,"
on which the shell is supposed to be,
left Salina Cruz last Thursday, and
should reach San Francisco next week.
Murphy is gradually eliminating
men from the squad who will not be
of use to him, and by the end of the
week will have the squad reduced still
more. The men then remaining will
probably be retained for the rest of
the season, and from them Murphy
will pick the Varsity and Freshman
crews.
All the boats and the men will be
kept at the lake for several weeks
longer. The eight will be kept at the
lake until the boat house at Redwood
is repaired and lengthened, after
which it will be transferred to the
latter place. The crews will then al
ternate between Redwood and the
lake until Murphy has selected the
men for the two crews with substi
tutes, after which the training will
be wholly confined to Redwood.
The lake is about filled and Murphy
is able to use all three boats to ad
vantage. There are at times a large
number of pleasure boats on the lake
during the time the crews practice
in the late afternoon. In the past
these boats have very often gotten in
the way of the shells and interfered
with the work to a large extent. Un
less the pleasure boats keep to the
middle of th® lake or else close to
the shore while the shells are on the
water, some restrictions as to the
hours for using pleasure boats may
have to be made.
