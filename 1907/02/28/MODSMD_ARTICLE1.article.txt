# GATHERING AT TOMB
## CHAPLAIN PREACHES MEMORIAL ADDRESS. Short and Simple Services Mark Second Anniversary of Mrs. Stanford's Death. 
### 
anniversary of the death
of Mrs. Jane Lathjrop Stanford was
celebrated this afternoon by simple
services at the Mausoleum. Chaplain
Gardner delivered the memorial add
ress, which was in part, as follows:
"My friends: It seems to me fitting
that we should assemble for this me
morial service 011 the anniversary of
Mrs. Stanford's death. It is fitting
that we thus assemble "lest we for
get." We are so busy about the af
fairs of life that we are too apt to for
get the things of love, the reverence
and respect which we owe to the
living and the dead. And so today
we remember.
In the death of Mrs. Stanford wi
realized that her life had been
crowned by an accomplishment with
out parallel in human history; an ac
complishment which means a larger
life for countless generations. Death
for our departed friend was but the
vestibule into another and a better
life.
Xo human soul ever believed more
firmly than did Mrs. Stanford in the
hope of immortality,
She talked familiarly of heaven.
She had the mystic vision of the shin
ing streets. For her the city beautiful
was real, because inhabited by the
loved ones gone before.
The passion behind her faith was
a mother's love, in tlie midst of her
grief for her boy.
For us remains the work. For
some, the restoration, the rebuilding,
and the completion of the University,
and the management of a great trust.
For others the academic task—to
make the University what .it was de
signed to be, a home of education,
of culture, and of faith; to make it
what it is destined to be—a visible
expression of our democracy and our
religion, a university dedicated to
humanity in the fear of God.
Let no little ends or low imagina
tions hinder that task. Let us be
large minded and large hearted i ;
carrying out a large-minded and
large-hearted trust.
Thus remembering, reverently n
calling the sorrows of Mrs. Stanford,
her sterling character, her zealous
labors,- her lofty aspirations; and in
the spirit of consecration to the work
yet to be done, we weave today a
wreath of love, and bind it with the
golden cord of onr devotion, and lay
it reverently at her tomb.
May she rest in peace."
