The track situation has been stil!
further complicated by the action of
California in placing their side of the
case in the hands of a faculty commit
tee. Just what effect this will have
upon Stanford's stand it is at present
difficult to prophesy. From the
statement given out tonight by Dr.
Angell it is evident that a similar
move on the part of Stanford would
be suicidal. The Student Body here
must settle this controversy for them
selves and from present indications
the sooner they settle it the better.
W r e must, however, await the action
of California's faculty before we can
discover exactly how the dispute
stands, and what line of procedure
we had better follow.
