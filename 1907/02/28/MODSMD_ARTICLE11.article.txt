Latlirop Stanford, tlie last surviving
founder of the University, died in
Honolulu. At the time of her death
the University stood at the end of the
long period of construction, which is
designated in Stanford annals as the
Age of Stone. The first dccade of
struggle was over and the University
was ready to turn to the enjoyment
of the prosperity which those years
of struggle had brought. Then, on
the very opening of the new era came
the earthquake, and with it-li return
to the Age of Stone. But thl' work
of rebuilding Stanford hai un
dertaken in the spirit of ifs MunHcrs.
The courage and which
marked the winning of the Stanford
suit and the dark days pre
ceded it, have remained w'itlrflic re
builders of the University. The wo.rk
which has been accomplished since
the great disaster, is splendid proof
that the spirit of its founders still
dominates the ideals of Stanford.
