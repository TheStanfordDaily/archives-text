# Safety Stairs for Assembly Hall.
## 
### 
The Commission of Engineers is
now constructing safety stairs at the
rear of Assembly Hall, on the east
and west corners, to lead from ihe
two sides of the gallery to the ground
exits. The Commission has been
contemplating the building of these
additional exits for some time as tin
old stairs would be inadequate in ease
of fire or panic.
