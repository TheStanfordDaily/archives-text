George Bernard Shaw's comedy of
modern English life, "You I\ever
Can Tell," will be seen for the first
time on the Pacific Coast tomorrow
evening when the curtain rises on the
Sophomore production in Assembly
Hall, at 8 o'clock. For the past four
months the energies of the 1909 play
committee and Professor H. D. Gray
of the English department, have been
devoted to working up the presenta
tion of this modern comcdy, which
marks a new departure in dramatics
at Stanford. Over one hundred Soph
omores signed up to try out for parts
in the cast, so that the players finally
selected represent the pick of the
histrionic ability of the class. Scen
ery has been specially painted in San
Francisco. New costumes will be
used by those players whose parts
demand them.
Coach Graj r has been engaged in
training the actors for the past seven
weeks. He is competent to bring tin
cast into proper shape for the pro
duction, not only from his studies
in literature and dramatics, but from
practical experience. For some years
prior to his coming to Stanford Ik
was a member of the faculty of the
New York Dramatic School where
he became well acquainted with the
works of Bernard Shaw. During the
past month Coach Gray has been as
sisted by. Instructor I. B. Cross, of
the department of Economics, who
appeared as William, the waiter, in
"You Never Can Tell" at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin last year.
The tangle of the plot is evolved
and unraveled at an English seaside
resort. The rise of the curtain dis
closes Dolly Clandon in the dentist's
chair in the office of Valentine. The
dialogue between Dolly and Valentine
sets the tone for the play. Dolly's
brother, Philip, soon appears upon
the scene and asks their new acquaint
ance, the dentist, to lunch. The Par
lourmaid then announces Mrs. Clan
don and her daughter Gloria. When
Valentine is called away by his iras

j cible landlord, Crampton, the children
I take occasion to ply their mother
with questions concerning their father,
whom she has driven away from their
home in Madeira. The curtain falls
on the first act with Crampton iii
the dentist's chair, after having ac
cepted the children's invitation to
join them at lunch.
The second act represents the
j luncheon 011 the terrace of the Ma-
I rine Hotel. The children press Mc
-1 Comas, Mrs. Clandon's old friend,
j with inquiries about their father and
! break up the luncheon while the per-
I sistent Valentine endeavors to press
| his attentions upon Gloria. The
| waiter temporarily smooths over all
! difficulties, but does not keep them
j from the danger of breaking out
afresh. Mrs. Clandon calls the arn-
I orous dentist Valentine to account
j in her own apartments in the third act
1 for trifling with her daughter, Gloria.
More complicated than before are the
love affairs of Gloria and the dentist
when the act closes. Act four is in
the evening in Mrs. Clandon's apart
j ments. Interruptions from the fancy
dress ball which is in progress vvith
-1 out, arc frequent. In the midst of
discussion of strictly private family
I matters, a mysterious stranger makes
! his way into the room from the car
nival against the will of the waiter
and takes command of the situation.
I This is the barrister, Bohun, who dis
poses of the characters with fatal
certainty, from Gloria to William.
, The question of whose father the
waiter really is, as he has been
j claimed by Phil, is settled, and the
merrymakers of the assembled com
pany dance away, leaving behind
them the conviction that "You Never
Can Tell."
The setting of the comedy has been
directed by E. J. Swift, '08, stage
manager for Sword and Sandals'.
'I his organization has had charge of
the staging and properties.. The
class committee in executive super
vision of the production is composed
of G. B. Bush, chairman, Miss R. G.
Sterne, E. E. Young, Miss P. B.
Botts and C. 13. Bradford. Consider
able time and expense has been put
upon issuing an artistic souvenir pro
gram.

ing the evening: Selection, "Seren
ade"; Waltz, "Amoureuse"; Inter
