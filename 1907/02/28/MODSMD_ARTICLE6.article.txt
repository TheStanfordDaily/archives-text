# WOULD CALL MEET OFF
## DR. ANGELL GIVES VIEWS ON CONTROVERSY. Stanford Faculty Will Not Interfere Unless It is Called Upon to Do So. 
### 
"If the students of these two great
universities cannot come to an agree
ment regarding the track controversy,
1 think that the meet ought to be
postponed for a term of years." Such
was the view expressed this afternoon
by Dr. Angell, relative to the track
dispute.
This statement from Dr. Angell
was brought about by the action of
the California executive committee.
That bod> last night gave the task
of settling the controversy to their
faculty athletic committee, consisting
of Colonel C. C. Edwards and Pro
lessors 11. B. Torrcy and B. Whitney.
1 his committee was given full power
to act, and its decision will be linal
with the Blue and Gold. What course
it will pursue is a matter of con
jecture.
Although Dr. Angell cannot speak
for the other members of the Stan
ford Faculty Athletic Committee,
personally he doubts whether the
committee would accept the burden
of settling the controversy, if by any
chance, they were requested to do so.
He is positive that he, at least, would
be opposed to the faculty taking over
the matter. Furthermore, he states
that if the settlement of the dispute
was passed to the faculty, the chances
of the track meet taking place this
year would be slight.
Oi course, if Stanford should ask
the aid of the faculty in settling the
discussion,'it would be a more radical
step than a-similar action on the part
of California. The Blue and Gold
faculty athletic committee is part of
California's executive committee.
The Cardinal's Executive Committee
however, is entirely free from faculty
influence.
When questioned further about the
track discussion, in general, Dr. An
gell said / VThfe track meet must take
place. U would prefer to see it at
Bcrkely} roller than not at all, al
though I consider it unjust."
D,f. AnVell that there was not
the .chance of the faculty in
terfering *una£ked. Even if the only
td the cancellation of the
meet is Acuity interference, nothing
will be done without a definite request
for action.
