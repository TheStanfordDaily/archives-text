### 
The Board of Governors of the
Interscholastic Association held t'eir
second meeting of the semester last
night and took the first steps toward
the arrangement of the details of the
meet to he held the 2.3d of this month.
President Macfarland appointed a
committee consisting of B. S. Allen,
'07, N. Fitch, ex-'O7, J. O. Miller, '08,
K. J. Nash, '07, and J. C. Macfarland,
'07, chairman, to investigate and ar
range for the entertainment of the
visiting athletes. F. li. Bernard, '07,
E. G. Sheibley, 'oS, F. Lanagan, '08,
D. N. Richards, '07, G. Knupp, '07.
and S. B. Thompson, '07, chairman,
were appointed a committee to take
charge of the smoker to he held in the
club room of Encina Hall the night
of the meet.
The board read a petition from
Lick School of San Francisco, asking
liiat the Interscholastic Association
institute as a regular event in the
annual meet, a five-mile cross-country
run. The board finally denied the
petition, considering that the pro
posed event was undesirable in that it
called for too much preparation, and
was also too hard on young athletes.
The directors voted to buy two new
lanes of hurdles on condition that the
Associated Students would bear half
the expense, and Graduate-Manager
Sales now has this proposition under
advisement. A tentative list of offi
cials for the meet was named, but the
personnel will not be made public
until definite assurances of acceptance
have been received from the men
whom the board will invite to take
charge o.f the meet.
