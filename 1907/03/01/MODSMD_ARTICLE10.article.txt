# MEET AGAIN POSTPONED.
## Inclemency of Weather Prevents First Contest on New Track This Afternoon 
### 
For the third time the inclemency
|of the weather forced a postpone
j ment of the first meet on Stanford's
; new track. The interdepartment con
test scheduled for this afternoon was
indefinitely postponed owing to the
soft condition of the cinder path.
Captain Macfarland and Trainer
Moulton believed up to late this after
noon that it would be possible to
pull off the meet, but the continued
showers made it impossible. If the
sun shines for the next few days the
meet will be pulled off early next
week. Macfarland announced tonight
that all track men would report to-
I morrow morning at 10:30 on the new
track for the usual work-outs, but 110
attempt will be made to hold the reg
ular competition at that time.
