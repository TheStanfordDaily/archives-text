# Delay in Lighting Avenue.
## 
### 
President Jordan explained today
that the reason why no steps have
! been taken in the construction of a
; lighting system for University Avenue
! lies in the fact that the bids sub
mitted by contractors were all so
high that the Trustees would not con
i sider them. Several bids were re
j ceived, but all of them were above any
i figures which could be considered, and
all were rejected. The Trustees are
willing to receive more bids, but un
less they arc materially lower than
those already received no action can
be taken toward a systematic lighting
of the avenue.
