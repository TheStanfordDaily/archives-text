# Glee Club to Sing at Fairmount.
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club has been
invited to sing in San Francisco at
the opening of the new Fairmount
hotel, on April the sixteenth. The
entertainment at the opening is in the
hands of several of San Francisco's
most prominent charity workers. All
the proceeds of the affair are to go
towards charity work in the city.
Several of the prominent musical
organizations of this part of the Stato
have been asked to contribute their
services, among them the De Koven
Club of Berkeley. The members of
the Glee Club met last evening and
decided to accept the invitation, and
the final arrangements will be made
as soon as possible.
