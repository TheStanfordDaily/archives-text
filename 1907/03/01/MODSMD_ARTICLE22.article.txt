# TENNIS CLUB REPLIES
## STATES REASONS FOR TRYOUT CHANGE. Club Believes Present System is Only One Practicable Under Prevailing Conditions. 
### 
In order to correct misconceptions
which have arisen concerning the
system of Varsity tennis tryouts
adopted by the Tennis Club this year,
may we have the privilege of an ex
planation through your columns?
The tryouts permitting the men who
have made a Varsity singles team
to enter the round robin without play
ing in the preliminaries were not in
tended to favor last year's Varsity
men as seems to he the current im
pression, but aimed rather at a thor
ough competition which would settle
with the least doubt the relative mer
its of the players.
As all the tennis men realize, the
preliminary tournaments are merely
elimination trials in order to select
the men for the round robin, where
the real test of relative playing ability
comes, in the round robin tourna
ment every player meets every other
player in a five-set match, and the
element of chance is as nearly eradi
cated as possible. For this reason it
is very desirable that as many of the
best men as possible should meet in
this final round; the more players in
tl.is tourney, the more satisfactory
and thorough the tryouts. This ap
plies with more than the usual force
here today, for a large number of men
are playing very close together,
a nree instead of five men in the round
robin means that two more of the |
best players in the University will be |
shut out of this tournament and either !
of these men may lose his place
through the uncertainties of three-set
matches played in straight tourna- I
ment.
The club realized that the ideal plan
would be to hold five preliminary
tournaments, exempting 110 one, but
experience renders it certain that
there is not time in which to car-y
out such a plan. So the only feasible
scheme remaining was adopted. In
past years the Varsity men have been
exempted, and but two preliminary
tournaments held, placing four men j
in the final round. The club resolved
to increase this number to five, mak
ing the tryouts that much more thor
ough. The Varsity men were the
only players who could logically be
passed into the round robin, so this
custom of former years was followed.
In accordance with the wishes of
the Executive Committee, the Tennis
Club has struck out of its constitu
tion the clause providing for the ex
emption of the Varsity men from the j
preliminary tryouts, and there will
be this year three preliminary tourna
ments, which all candidates for the
team must enter. This communica
tion aims only to explain the reasons
of the tennis men in adopting the
plan which was later censored by the
Executive Committee and which i:-
now set aside because of that censor
ship. Stanford Tennis Club.
