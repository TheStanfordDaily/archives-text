### 
California declines a second meet
ing of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee to settle the track meet
controversy on the grounds that no
new propositions for discussion have
been presented and suggests that the
matter be referred to the Faculty Ath
letic Committees of the two Univer
sities. Such action was taken by the
executive committee of the Associated
Students of the University of Cali
fornia in a regular meeting held last
Wednesday evening. Stanford's com
munication, arguing for another inter
collegiate conference, was read and
the following reply forwarded to the
Cardinal Executive Committee:
Berkeley, February 28, 1907.
Clay R. Crider, Sec'y A. S. S. U.
Dear sir: Your communication of
Feb. 20th was read at the regular
meeting of the executive committee
last night. I was instructed to notify
your committee that the executive
committee of the A. S. U. C. decline
a second meeting of the Intercollegi
ate Agreement Committee, on the
grounds that no new propositions for
discussion have been presented, and
suggest that the matter be referred
to the Faculty Athletic Committees
of the two Universities, in accordance
with Article 111, Section 2, of the
Intercollegiate Agreement. Our com
mittee stands ready to meet yours at
any date that can be arranged by the
committees.
Sincerely yours,
C. H. Ramsden,
Sec. A. S. U. C.
"The Faculty Athletic Committees
of the respective universities shall be
courts of appeal in all cases of dis
agreement between student managers,
captains, or other officials of athletic
teams." This is the clause, taken
from Art. 111, Sec. 2, under which
California presumably suggests that
the matter be placed in the hands of
faculty referees.
As far as could be learned today
a majority of the members of the
Executive Committee are not in favor
of submitting the question to the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee. Dr. Angel!,
chairman of the committee, is avow
edly opposed to taking up the matter.
Yesterday he stated that he was in
favor of calling the meet off in c.i*e
the student athletic authorities ?<f the
two universities could not settle the
dispute.
