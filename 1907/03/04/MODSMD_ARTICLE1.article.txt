# LOSES IN CLOSE GAME
## GALLAGHER-MARSH WINS IN THIRTEENTH. Goodell Pitches Through Thirteen-Inning Game, Which Goes to Visiting Nine. 
### 
The third extra inning game of the
season resulted in defeat for the Var
sity at the hands of the Gallagher-
Marsh team Saturday afternoon, by
the score of 6-5. Not until the thir
teenth inning was the winning run
put across and for two hours and a
half the largest crowd which has been
seen 011 the baseball bleachers this
year applauded play after play of a
sensational nature.
To the errors of the Cardinal in
field was due the defeat, for although
he was hit rather hard at times, Good
ell, who was in the box, pitched ef
fective and consistent ball. In the
early stages of the game the visitors
piled up five runs and although the
Varsity by a gritty uphill fight tied
the score before the ninth inning, they
could not make the other necessary
tally.
Two bad throws by Cadwalader, a
base through being hit by a pitched
ball, and a long single by Bloomfield,
gave the San Franciscans three runs
and the lead in the second inning.
Two more fell to them in the fourth
inning, through a single by Burke, a
three-base drive by Nell, a wild'throw
by Stott, and a second bingle by
Bloomfield. This inning also saw a
pretty piece of fielding by the Varsity.
Nell's drive rolled nearly to the Gym
nasium, and Garibaldi, who was run
ning for him turned third base in an
attempt to stretch the smash into a
home run. From the far outfield the
ball was whipped in, Owen to \\ irt
to Fenton to Ganong, and the base
runner was cut ofif at the plate by the
scantiest of margins. This, the long
est hit of the season, combined with
an unusual bit of fieJding, was easily
the feature of the game.
The Varsity scored once in the first
inning, twice in the fifth, and added
one each in the two following innings.
For six innings there followed score
less ball, with the home team leading
by a wide margin in hitting, but seem
ing to have but little luck. Halloran,
the clever short-stop for the visitors,
broke up the game in the thirteenth
inning, when he hit for two bases,
scoring flood, who had been given a
base on balls. With one down in the
Varsity's half of this inning a flicker
of hope was raised on the bleachers
when Gore, who was sent in to bat
for Goodell, drove out a safety and
stole second. However, Dennis and
Scott next up, were unable to make
the necessary hit.
In the sixth inning Stott retired
with a bad finger. Ganong, the Fresh
man catcher, who took his place,
played in good form, driving out a hit
and fielding cleverly.

The third extra inning game of the
season resulted in defeat for the Var
sity at the hands of the Gallagher-
Marsh team Saturday afternoon, by
the score of 6-5. Not until the thir
teenth inning was the winning run
put across and for two hours and a
half the largest crowd which has been
seen 011 the baseball bleachers this
year applauded play after play of a
sensational nature.
To the errors of the Cardinal in
field was due the defeat, for although
he was hit rather hard at times, Good
ell, who was in the box, pitched ef
fective and consistent ball. In the
early stages of the game the visitors
piled up five runs and although the
Varsity by a gritty uphill fight tied
the score before the ninth inning, they
could not make the other necessary
tally.
Two bad throws by Cadwalader, a
base through being hit by a pitched
ball, and a long single by Bloomfield,
gave the San Franciscans three runs
and the lead in the second inning.
Two more fell to them in the fourth
inning, through a single by Burke, a
three-base drive by Nell, a wild'throw
by Stott, and a second bingle by
Bloomfield. This inning also saw a
pretty piece of fielding by the Varsity.
Nell's drive rolled nearly to the Gym
nasium, and Garibaldi, who was run
ning for him turned third base in an
attempt to stretch the smash into a
home run. From the far outfield the
ball was whipped in, Owen to \\ irt
to Fenton to Ganong, and the base
runner was cut ofif at the plate by the
scantiest of margins. This, the long
est hit of the season, combined with
an unusual bit of fieJding, was easily
the feature of the game.
The Varsity scored once in the first
inning, twice in the fifth, and added
one each in the two following innings.
For six innings there followed score
less ball, with the home team leading
by a wide margin in hitting, but seem
ing to have but little luck. Halloran,
the clever short-stop for the visitors,
broke up the game in the thirteenth
inning, when he hit for two bases,
scoring flood, who had been given a
base on balls. With one down in the
Varsity's half of this inning a flicker
of hope was raised on the bleachers
when Gore, who was sent in to bat
for Goodell, drove out a safety and
stole second. However, Dennis and
Scott next up, were unable to make
the necessary hit.
In the sixth inning Stott retired
with a bad finger. Ganong, the Fresh
man catcher, who took his place,
played in good form, driving out a hit
and fielding cleverly.
