# DISPUTE ABOUT RACE
## CALIFORNIA WANTS FRESHMEN EIGHTS. Sales and Snedigar Confer on Matter. Murphy Prefers First Year Fours. 
### 
A dispute seems to have arisen be
tween Stanford and California over
the Freshman crew race for this
spring, and California has stated that
if their eights arrive before the 20th
of March they will insist on a Fresh
man eight race or else give up that
race altogether. Inasmuch as neither
University has received an eight as
yet the question will probably not be
settled for several weeks.
Manager Sales conferred with Man
ager Snedigar of California, on Sat
urday and the question of the Fresh
man race was discussed at length at
that meeting. The Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee had left the
entire matter to the graduate manag
ers owing to the fact that for a time it
was not certain that the eights would
arrive here in time to be used this
year. For that reason it was hoped
that some tentative arrangement for
the race could be made contingent
upon the arrival of the new boats.
Coach Murphy has expressed himself
as being against a Freshman eight
this year for the reason that it will be
almost impossible for him to turn out
two eights with the poor facilities at
his command, while he could turn out
a good Freshman four. Sales there
fore favored having a Freshman four
oared race and Snedigar seemed to be
of the same opinion at the meeting
Saturday.
After returning to the campus, how
ever, Sales received a message from
Snedigar to the effect that if Califor
nia's shells arrived before March 20th
California would insist on having a
Freshman eight-oared race or else
dropping the race altogether. Mur
phy is still opposed to this, and while
it is not likely that a deadlock will
result over the question, it may delay
the final arrangements for the regatta.
