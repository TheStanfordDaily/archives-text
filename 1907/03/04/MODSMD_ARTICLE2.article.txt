# 1909 SCORES SUCCESS
## "YOU NEVER CAN TELL" BRILLIANTLY PLAYED. Production of Shaw's Comedy In Assembly Hall, Friday Night, is Completely Successful. 
### 
A better satisfied audience has prob
ably never left Assembly Hall
than the one which dispersed after
the performance of "You Never Can
Tell," presented by the Class of 1909
last Friday evening. The substitution
of a modern society drama for the
customary Sophomore revivals of
eighteenth-century plays had been
fully justified, as well as the action of
the class in upholding the choice of
the committee. For several reasons
this choice was a good one, —much
general interest was insured from the
very start by the selection of a Ber
nard Shaw play; then, too, this par
ticular comedy is one of the cleverest
of his "Plays Pleasant," and probably
the best suited for amateur actors.
The audience was keenly attentive to
the lines and action, the interest being
held throughout by unexpected situa
tions and witty dialogue. The entire
performance showed thorough work
and competent management on the
part of the coach and committee,
while the cast was more uniformly
successful than in any previous Soph
omore comedy.
Of the ten persons who took part
in the play, the most praise is prob
ably due to G. N. Richardson, as Val
entine, and Miss P. N. Rosenthal, as
Mrs. Clandon. Richardson was es
sentially easy and natural in his inter
pretation of the part of the clever and
impecunious young dentist, and al
most invariably brought out the point
of his lines in a way that won him
much applause. As Mrs. Clandon,
Miss Rosenthal did a really finished
piece of acting, sustaining the part
throughout with the utmost consist
ency. She was the "Twentieth-Cen
tury Woman" to the life, her fine
voice, dignity and assurance combin
ing to mark a most convincing person
ality. Miss R. A. Roberts made a
thoroughly sprightly and charming
Dolly, and entertained the audience
every moment that she was on the
stage. She was well seconded by
C. 1. Spangler as Phil, the other irrep
ressible twin, who was, however,
neither so competent nor so spon
taneous as Miss Roberts.
Miss G. E. Fleming, as Gloria Clan
don, had a very effective stage pres
ence, but was less at case in her role
than the other members of the cast
The part is the most difficult in the
play, especially at first, before Gloria's
reserve breaks down, and the audience
was never brought sufficiently int<
sympathy with her to indicate a com
plete success
As the Waiter with the talent for
anticipating every wish of his pa
trons, and another gift for relieving
unbearably awkward situations, C. L.
Roberts did some Rood work. Hig
hest scene, was that in which the old
man is so pathetically confused by the
sudden appearance of his son. The
character as originally created is far
removed from the minor position
which such a part usually obtains in
a society drama; and except for its be

ing perhaps a shade too obsequious,
Roberts' interpretation of it was most
successful.
Three interesting character-parts,
those of Crampton, Bohun, and Mc-
Comas, were excellently done by M.
O. Adams, T. R. Johnson, and E. B.
Nelson, respectively. Each received
much appreciation from the audience.
Miss J. L. French was the maid.
Taken point by point, or as a whole,
there is little but praise to be heard
for the play, and the Class of tqo(
is generally commended for having
broken away from the precedent of
former Sophomore classes in choosing
and successfully staging such a play
as "You Never Can Tell."

as "You Never Can Tell."
