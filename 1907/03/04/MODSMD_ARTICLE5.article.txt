# WANT ENGLISH RULES
## JOINT FOOTBALL COMMITTEES MEET. Recommend that Rules Under Which Vancouver Played be Adopted With Minor Variations. 
### 
The Stanford-California Rugby-
Rules Committee has recommended
the English system of play for the
season of 1907, with but a few minor
exceptions. The committee for Stan
ford, consisting of J. F. Lanagan, '00,
Captain W. Koerner, '08, and Dr. T.
M. Williams, '97, met the California
committee, consisting of Captain Tul
ler, Coach Taylor, and P. Hall, '99,
Saturday night in San Francisco.
The committee was in favor without
exception, of adopting the English
rules. California, through its repre
sentatives, advocated a change in ex
isting rules whereby an umpire as
well as a referee would be on the
field. This rule was suggested by
California because it would lighten
the burden of one official and would
give better satisfaction to the players
Another rule suggested by the Blue
and Gold was the lessening of points
gained from a penalty kick. Under
the existing rules a goal secured be
cause of a penalty counts three points.
California pointed out that this
worked a hardship to either team
which could be remedied by changing
the penalty from three to two points.
One or two other changes were sug
gested, but were of minor consider
ation and will be taken up again at
future meeting. The two changes
proposed by California were not for
mally adopted. The Stanford com
mittee will take the proposals under
consideration, and make its report at
the next meeting, the date for which
has not been set.
Coach Lanagan was non-committal
as to his views on the proposed varia
tions.
"The proposed variations from the
English rules were suggestions on the
part of California," he said, "and will
be further discussed at a future meet
ing of the joint committees. Other
minor matters were discussed, but
were of no great importance and will
not be taken up again until another
meeting is held."
The English rules recommended
by the joint committees are those un
der which Vancouver played Stanford
on the campus and in the North last
year. The English rules provide in
substance that following a scrum the
ball shall continue in play, even after
the runner is downed. That is when
the runner is tackeled or falls he shall
be compelled to pass the ball under
penalty for not doing so. This prac
tically eliminates the scrum except as
a penalty, and keeps the ball in mo
tion all the time. The Intercollegiate
rules under which Stanford and Cali
fornia played, provide that when the
runner is downed with the ball the
play shall cease and a new scrum shall
lie formed.
No definite date has been set for
the next meeting of the Rules Com
mittee. Another meeting will be held,
however, before the end of the pres
ent semester.
