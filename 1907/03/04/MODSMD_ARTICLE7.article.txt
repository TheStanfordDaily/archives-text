The action of the joint Rugby Rules
Committee in recommending that the
English rules be played next year,
will undoubtedly meet with the com
mendation of the Student Body. Any
one who saw both the Vancouver and
Intercollegiate games last fall, could
entertain but one opinion. The prac
tical elimination of the monotonous
scrum will go a long way toward pop
ularizing the game and improving it
from the spectacular standpoint. The
minor changes urged by the Califor
nia committee are also worthy of ac
ceptance. Two officials on the field
will put an end to any hard feeling
about the infliction of penalties. The
other change is also fair and logical
since it reduces the points from a
penalty goal to less than those scored
by working across the line for a try.
Both of these variations would better
the game and it is to be hoped tha
the Rules Committee will amend the
English rules which they have rec
ommended, by adopting these two
changes.
