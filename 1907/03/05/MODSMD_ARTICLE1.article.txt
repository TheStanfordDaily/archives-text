# SAN JOSE WANTS PLAY
## ADVANCES MADE FOR "YOU NEVER CAN TELL." Opportunity Offered for Financial and Artistic Success by Sophomore Class. 
### 
That the Sophomore cast will pre
sent "You Never Can Tell' in San
Jose in the near future is made more
than likely by the favorable circum
stances connected with such a pro
posed outside production. C. L. Rob- '
erts, '09, who played the part of the
Waiter last Friday night, has been
making inquiries looking toward the
engagement of the Victory Theatre
for the presentation of the play within
the next few weeks.
None of the members of the cast
are opposed to taking the proposed
excursion into outside dramatics. In
fact, a majority of the players are
heartily in favor of putting the play
on in San Jose if the sanction of the
class and the University authorities
can be obtained. All the actors have
stated that they are willing to fur
ther the proposition as much as is
in their power to do so.
The fact that three members of the
cast, Miss R. A. Roberts, Miss P. N.
Rosenthal, and E. B. Nelson, have
their homes in San Jose, adds to the
chances of the success of the play
in that city, which is conceded to be
the strongest Stanford town in the
State. The father of Miss P. N. Ros
enthal, '09, is connected with the
management of the Victory Theatre
as their attorney, and is interesting
himself to make the Sophomore pro
duction in San Jose a success. C. L.
Roberts, '09, who has played in road
shows along the Pacific Coast, is in
close relations with Manager R. G.
Barton and E. Dimond, of the Vic
tory Theatre, and is in an excellent
position to forward the proposition.
Manager Barton stated to Roberts
in an interview last Saturday that he
was open to advances from the Stan
ford people who would be in charge
of the outside production. He stated
that the customary rate of division
of receipts would be allowed, the
Stanford management and the theatre
each taking fifty per cent. The San
Jose management would, by contract,
stand all expenses except the cost of
printing advertising matter and the
personal expenses of the company.
The receipts from such a production
would be turned over to the 1909
Class treasury.
