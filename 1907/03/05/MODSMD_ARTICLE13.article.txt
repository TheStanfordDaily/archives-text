When any man descends to the
level rcachcd by the author or authors
of the so-called "Bogey," which ap
peared this morning, he ceases to he
a fit companion for the society of de
cent people, and the sooner he is re
moved from the community the bet
ter. How any person who claims or
even pretends to be a Stanford man,
can be cowardly enough to attack the
Stanford women, masking behind the
cloak of anonymity, is difficult to un
derstand. In this case it is not suffi
cient that tjie author of the publica
tion should be publicly execrated and
condemned. The offense calls for
concerted action on the part of the
Faculty and the Student Body. Xo
stone should be left unturned in the
search for the guilty parties. In any
community—let alone a college com
munity, where every man is suppos
edly a gentleman—the author of such
a publication would be treated to a
coat of tar and feathers and a ride
out of town on a rail. In this case
if the identity of the cowardly author
can be discovered he should be es
corted to the railroad track and
started on his journey away from the
campus with forcible instructions
never to return. As the matter
now stands, Stanford University ap
pears to the outside world as a place
where women may be insulted with
impunity. If the Student Body stands
by indifferently and permits the mat
ter to pass without even an attempted
investigation, we are likely to retain
this reputation. Every Stanford man
and woman should make it his or her
duty to discover the offender if pos
sible, and to give his name to the
public as soon as that discovery is
made.
