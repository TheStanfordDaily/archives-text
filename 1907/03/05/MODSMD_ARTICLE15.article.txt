# Hedge and Wire Fence for Track
## 
### 
As the bids submitted for the fenc
ing of the new track were considered
too high, the Board of Control has
decided to erfcet a barbed-wire fence,
six feet in height. As soon as this is
done, a hedge will be planted. It will
probably take four years for this
hedtfe to mature.
