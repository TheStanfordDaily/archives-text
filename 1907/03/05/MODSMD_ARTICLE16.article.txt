# TRANSFER TRUST FORMED.
## Palo Alto Expressmen Raise Prices on Campus Trunks and Dress Suit Cases. 
### 
The transfer men of Palo Alto have
decided that the students owe them
a better living than they have been
enjoying in the past, and consequently
have announced a raise in prices for
transporting pieces to the campus.
No longer will the baggage smashers
carry trunks for the mere sum of
twenty-five cents. They will en
deavor to smash the trunks just as
much for fifty cents. No longer will
the transfer men carry dress suit
cases with trunks merely for the
chance to examine them. Hereafter
the students will pay ten cents extra.
The reason for this raise, accord
ing to the transfer companies is the
high price of feed and the cost of
labor. The baggage men claim that
they make practically no profit from
the transportation of trunks to the
campus, and that they can no longer
afford to maintain the old prices.
They also state that there has been
no systematic method used in hand
ling the trunks in the past and
neither themselves nor the students
have had any protection. Hereafter
each company will have one repre
sentative at the station to receive
checks and issue receipts. Trunks
will be taken anywhere in Encina Hall
for fifty cents, no extra charge being
made for carrying baggage to the
upper floors. The same prices will
prevail on the Row.
Those students who have heard of
the raise, which is already in effect,
do not take kindly to the new prices,
and talk is heard of an arrangement
which will be made with expressmen
from nearby towns to handle the rush
of trade at the end of the semester.
