# "Bogey" Makes Its Appearance.

### 
A "Bogey," modelled along the
lines of that issued in the fall semes
ter of 1905, was scattered broadcast
around the campus this morning.
The present production is notable
chiefly for its general poorness. The
prominent men and women of the
University are attacked with small
regard for common decency, and the
faculty is also knocked indiscrimin
ately.
