# GEORGE WILL ADDRESS ASSEMBLY.
## Social Reformer to Speak In Assembly Hall Tomorrow Morning. â€” Orchestra Will Play Regular Program. 
### 
William George, founder of "The
George Junior Republic," and a man
of international reputation, will give
an address before the students in As
sembly Hall tomorrow morning at
11:15, at which time he will speak on
the "Republic" and other topics of
interest. The Assembly tomorrow,
which is under the auspices of the
Social Service Club, will be the first
in some time, and will be the result
of a careful selection of a speaker of
note. George will not confine him
self to his hobby, but will also speak
about social life in Greater New York,
of which he has made considerable
study. Along this line the speaker
is almost as well known as J. A. Riis,
the famous reform worker.

George advanced his ideas of his
"Republic" in an effort to solve exist
ing social problems, and his works on
reform are widely read. His "Re
public" was organized in 1895 at Free
ville, N. Y. It is a self-supporting,
self-governing community of boys
and girls picked up from the slums of
New York and made to become use
ful citizens. The "Republic" has so
far proved so wonderfully successful
that other states have begun to adopt
the George system, with remarkable
results. George will arrive tomorrow
from Los Angeles where he has been
delivering a number of lectures.
During the Assembly tomorrow
morning the University Orchestra will
appear in Assembly Hall and render
a special program of several numbers.
