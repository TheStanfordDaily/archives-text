# SEATTLE TO SEND MEN
## FIVE MEN WILL REPRESENT NORTHERN SCHOOL. Strong Team Coming From Washington to Compete in Interscholastic Track Meet. 
### 
Seattle High School will send five
picked men to the Interscholastic
Track meet which is to be held 011
the new track March 23. The Board
of Governors received their second
communication from that school to
day and it states that the Northerners
have definitely decided to send a team
.
I to the big meet. Regular tryouts
I will be held at once in order to select
I the athletes who will make the trip.
The Northern school have an envi
| able record both 011 the track and
football field, and the five men who
come to Stanford should be fast and
clever athletes. The school is the
only preparatory institution in Seattle,
and has an attendance of over two
thousand. For the last three years
its athletes have won all the cham
pionships of the Northwest and with
the pick of them entered against the
best of the California schools the re
sult should be some pretty races fin
j ished in fast time.
It is reported that Seattle has an
| undefeated relay team, and that the
i five men sent here will be selected
j with a view to taking home the Bitt-
I ner trophy. The team will arrive in
1 San Francisco the morning of the
j 22(1.
I Harvard School will again send a
! strong and well-balanced team to rep
resent them, and Oakland will defend
their title to the Fowler cup. There
appears to be some question concern
ing the eligibility of Munn, who last
| year secured 18 points and the meet
for Oakland, but if that versatile ath
lete is allowed to enter, he will be a
dangerous competitior for individual
honors, and the school now holding
the first trophy will again run a strong
race for first place.
