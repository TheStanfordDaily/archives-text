# PLAY AT SANTA CLARA.
## VARSITY MEETS COLLEGIANS TOMORROW. First Game of Second Series Will be Played on Grounds of Catholic College. 
### 
Weather permitting, the Varsity Will
meet the Santa Clara College team
at Santa Clara tomorrow afternoon
in the first game of the second series.
Stanford won the first series by win
ning two games out of three, and gen
erally outplayed the collegians.
Heretofore it has been the custom
to play five games with Santa Clara,
the team winning three out of five
games getting the series, but it was
thought best to play six games in two
series, of three games each, this year.
These series are entirely separate and
in the event of each team winning a
series there will be no third game or
series of games played to decide the
championship.
The Varsity line-up has not yet
been decided upon by Coach Lana
gan, but will probably be the same
as that which played the Gallagher-
Marsh team last Saturday.
