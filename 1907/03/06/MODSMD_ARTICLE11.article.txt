The chances of the track men for
an outside trip this season seem to
be very slight. Negotiations with an
All-Southern California team have
failed and there is but little chance of
a meet with Pomona. The Oregon
contest is at best a remote possibility.
It seems hardly fair that the track
team should be deprived of a trip
away from home. Their preliminary
work is as hard if not harder than
in some other branch of spring ath
letics. The baseball men are to go
to Reno, and the crew may be able
to arrange a Southern trip. In all
fairness to the track men the Gradu
ate Manager should make every effort
to secure a trip for them if possible,
even at the risk of a slight financial
loss.
