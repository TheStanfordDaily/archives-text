The Interscholastic Association is
to be congratulated upon the entry of
the Seattle High School team in this
year's meet. When the meet was
first proposed, the men behind the
proposition hoped that it would
some day be entered by all the lead
ing secondary schools 011 the Coast.
They hardly expected, however, to
have this hope gratified in the sec
ond annual meet. Seattle's entry will
not only help to bring many good
men from the Northwest to Stanford,
but it will probably be the entering
wedge for the other big preparatory
schools in this territory, and in the
years to come a comparison of the
track athletes from Washington and
Oregon with those of California will
be made possible by the annual con
tests on the Stanford track.
