# TROUBLE ON GERMAN POSTER
## "Curtain Raises" Causes Consternation in Ranks of Managers of "Minna von Barnhelm." 
### 
Disaster threatened the German
Club this morning in their efforts to
further t lie production of "Minna
von Barnhelm." Disaster which was
only averted by the cool heads and
prompt action of several members of
the German faculty. The manage
ment had carefully distributed the
usual preliminary posters in the cus
tomary windows 011 the Quadrangle.
Two members of the German depart
ment faculty walking down the Quad
happened to glance at one of the
posters artistically disposed in a near
by window. Upon it their horrified
glances beheld "Curtain Raises at 8."
Immediately all was consternation.
For the honor of the German depart
ment, it should never be said that the
poster for "Minna von Barnhelm"
had appeared in anything but the
most irreproachable English. Mem
bers of the faculty and the Club were
hastily impressed into service, and
the offending posters were gathered
up as rapidly as possible to be re
turned to the printer for the elimina
tion of the superfluous "a."
