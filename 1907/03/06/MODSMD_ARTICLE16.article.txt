### 
Five hundred dollars is the sum
required for the reconstrutcion of two
first class tennis courts on the founda
tion of the old courts in front of En
cina Gymnasium. This was the opin
ion submitted by the Court Commit
tee at a meeting of the Tennis Club
last night. The tennis men will en
deavor to raise the money by every
means possible. Personal subscrip
tions will be requested, and an appeal
will be made to the merchants of Palo
Alto. If money cannot be raised for
two courts, one will be putin condi
tion.
If possible, the members of the
Tennis Club themselves will do the
work necessary for the reconstruc
tion of the old courts. The founda
tion of these is intact, and in all prob
ability no levelling will be needed.
The replacement of the asphalt will
doubtless be sufficient to give Stan
ford two first-class courts.
