# LITTLE CHANCE FOR MEET.
## Efforts to Arrange Southern Trip for Track Men Are Still Unsuccessful. 
### 
Prospects for a Southern trip are
poor. Track Captain Macfarland is
in receipt of a letter from Hempel
stating that it will be impossible to
have an All-Southern California team
meet the Cardinal, and Macfarland is
now trying to arrange a meet with
Pomona as the last resort. Noble,
the Pomona coach, appears to be un
enthusiastic over the idea, however,
and it is very doubtful if the Stanford
men will go South this year. The
16th of this month is about the only
possible date on which the trip could
be made, and Noble reports that he
already has a meet scheduled for that
day.
Should the Southern contest fail to
materialize there will be very few
meets with outside teams before the
Intercollegiate. With the exception
of the Olympic Club meet there is
as yet 110 arrangement for visiting
teams, before the big meet with Cali
fornia.
