# SPEAKS ABOUT JUNIOR REPUBLIC.
## William R. George Tells of His Work in New York State with Juvenile Government. â€” Its Ideals and Organization. 
### 
That a "Junior Republic,'' modeled
after the one founded in New York
will be established in Southern Cali
fornia and possibly one in the Santa
Clara valley, near Stanford, was the
prediction of William R. George, the
famous sociologist, at the close of his
remarks to the students at this morn
ing's Assembly.
In language, which he probably uses
in talking to his wards in the "Re
public," George spoke interestingly
to the University men and women this
morning for fully an hour, setting be
fore them the trials in founding the
famous colony, bringing out the se
riousness and humor in the make-up
of the citizens of the Junior Republic,
and showing the ultimate great suc
cess of his ideas. His address was
interesting from the beginning, and
his manner of delivery something dif
ferent from the usual formal and ora
torical efforts of former speakers.
He appeared not so much as a speaker
setting out cut and dried subjects, but
as a conversationalist, giving a
graphic description of an original idea
which he wishes one to grasp.
George commenced from the time
he first got the idea of forming his
Junior Republic and continued by a
synopsis of his work until the colony
was brought to a permanent establish
ment.
He said in part: "I took a special
interest in small boys and girls from
the time I went to New York as 1
boy. I organized boys and girls clubs
as a drill sergeant, and was brought
into touch with all manner of young
people. I formed the idea of taking
about fifty boys and girls to Free
ville, N. Y., for a summer outing.
The people in the vicinity were
greatly interested in the work, and the
following year I brought a large num
ber of children to the country. Out
siders became interested and thought
that a great work was being done.
"The boys and girls, however,
thought only of what they could take
home with them after the outing.
Parents of the boys and girls consid
ered the scheme established for char
itable purposes. The following year
I started the boys working on the
roads, giving as an inducement for
work a suit of clothes to those who
handled a pick and shovel." Here
George recited several interesting
and humorous stories of the trials en
countered in an effort to make his
charges labor. "By this method the
boys were taught self-control," he
said, "and soon every boy was anxious
to work, considering it a great joke
on Mr. George. Before this 1 had
made all the laws for the community.
When the workers discovered that
they were owners of property, they
suggested rules of their own. Thus
there was the beginning of govern
ment, and the germ of the Junior
Republic. Before the establishment
of government it was the custom to
hold a whipping bee every morning
to punish offenders. Then it was

suggested that culprits should be
judged by members of the Republic.
The number of offenders immediately
decreased. Instead of whippings, the
unruly boys were made to pile stone.
This was an even greater punishment.
"One of the toughest members of
the Republic, Banjo by name, who
before had always been a leader of
the tougher elements, was made
keeper. This was a success. Where
a regular keeper had been fooled it
was found impossible to trifle with
the young guardian of the workers.
Following this, a scheme of making
everyone pay for his food was insti
tuted, and also a system of payments
by check was formed. The formative
period of the Republic was by this
time at its height and immediately
afterwards a banking system was in
stituted, then a police system, a jail, a
court, both criminal and civil. The
members of the Republic constituted
a legislature and formed the judicial,
legislative, and administrative bran
ches of government. Thus the Ju
nior Republic was built up from an
idea to one of the greatest of modern
sociological experiments.
As an example of development of
members of the Republic, George told
of the five boys with whom he formed
the existing institution. Each of the
five has been made a useful citizen.
Two are college graduates, two are
prominent business men, and one is
a government employee at Washing
ton, D. C.
"Members of the Republic average
about 17 years of age," the speaker
said. "No one is barred citizenship
in the Republic. There have been
criminals of the worst kind taken in.
some of whom have committed
crimes from murder to petty thefts.
The colony is a republic accepting
present social and economic condi
tions as they exist in the real world.
All questions peculiar to the Republic
are solved by the community. Boys
are given suffrage at 14, and every
thing is done by them under munici
pal and state laws. They have
adopted the New York code as their
statutes.
George brought his address to
a close by relating an example of po
litical life in the Republic, showing
the minds of the young citizens to be
as acute and independent as could be
found in a much more settled and
older community of adults.
The University Orchestra rendered
music before and after the Assembly.
