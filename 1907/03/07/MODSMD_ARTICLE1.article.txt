# CAN CHARGE TUITION
## GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL FOR STANFORD. President Jordan Explains Reasons for Bill and Advantages Which Will Come From It. 
### 
Governor Gillett on Wednesday
signed the bill introduced by Senator
Marshall Black of Palo Alto, which
had already passed the legislature,
giving Stanford University the power
to charge fees in its technical and pro
fessional courses. The bill, so far as
the University is affected, is perhaps
the most important one passed in le
cent years. It leaves the University
free to evolve plans for making trie
technical and professional depart
ments of the University sec~>nd to
none in the United States.
Dr. Jordan when seen conccrning
the new bill gave out the following
statement. "The bill introduced by
Senator Black, to permit the Univer
sity to charge fees in its technical
and professional courses has passed
the legislature without opposition and
has been signed by the governor.
This bill makes it possible for 'he
University to assume instruction in
medicine when it is deemed best to
do so. It also permits a fee for in
struction in law, a matter necessary
to the full and proper development
of a first class law school. Tins the
Board of Trustees intends to accom
plish at once. Two new full profes
sors will-be appointed within the next
month, and the law library will be
made complete.
The bill also permits tuition fees
in Engineering and in Education,
though the Board has 110 present in
tention of charging such fees. The
statute provides that 110 tuition fees
shall be charged to students now en
rolled. It is within the discretion of
the Board to charge registration fees
to cover the service in the Registrar's
office, in the library, and the lighting,
heating and janitor's work. Such a
fee will perhaps be charged at some
time later, thus setting free the money
devoted to these purposes to be used
for library, athletic fields, and other
general purposes."
The act expressly prohibits the
charging of fees for tuition in any
other than the Professional and En
gineering courses, and under it no
fees for tuition can be charged to stu
dents now registered in any other
department. In bringing the bill be
fore the legislature the Board of
Trustees called attention to the fact
that in all first-class Professional and
Engineering courses given in Eastern
universities, and in Professional de
partments of the University of Cali
fornia, tuition fees are charged. Fur
ther than this, the cost of mainten
ance and equipment of Professional
and Engineering departments upon .1
basis of the highest efficiency is so
much greater per student than that
of Collegiate courses that the Trus
tees would not feel justified in mak
ing the necessary expenditures with
out some contribution toward their
maintenance by the students who are
being directly fitted to practice gain
ful pursuits.
