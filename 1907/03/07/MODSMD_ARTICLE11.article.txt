The liverymen have followed the
lead of the Palo Alto transfer men
and raised their usual prices for hacks
on the night of the Junior Prom. It
is only occasionally that the Student
Body has a chance to realize how
completely the transportation monop
oly controls the situation, but at pres
ent this fact seems to brought home
with double force. In the case of the
liverymen the raise is particularly
unjustifiable. In large cities the
charge for the best closed carriages
at evening functions hardly ever ex
ceeds six dollars, while under the new
schedule adopted by the Palo Alto
stables, an open carriage or surrey
only will be furnished for that price.
The extra time involved certainly
does not justify a two-dollar raise.
It is reported that there is a move
ment on foot among the women who
will attend the Prom, to do away with
carriages altogether, and walk to t'.-e
Hall. It is to be hoped that the prop
osition will go through. The present
arbitrary action of the liverymen is
in no way justifiable and the students
have a right to make a strenuous
protest against it. Too much of the
Palo Alto livery trade comes from
the Stanford students, to justify the
raising of prices by the liverymen
whenever they think they have found
a good opportunity.
