# George Addresses Social Service.
## 
### 
The Social Service Club met last
evening at the Kappa Alpha The f a
house. Contrary to expectation, Wil
liam R. George, who addressed the
Assembly yesterday morning, re
mained on the campus last evening
and was thus able to attend the meet
ing of the club. He spoke most in
terestingly on the subject "Phases of
Social Life in New York Ten Years
Ago." Owing to the unexpected
presence of the first speaker, the pro
gram of the evening was somewhat,
interfered with and I. B. Cross, of the
Economics department, the regular
speaker of the evening, was compelled
to curtail his talk on "Socialism."
