# LIVERY MEN RAISE RATES.
## Decide to Make an Extra Charge for Carriages on Night of Prom. 
### 
The proprietors of the several liv
eries of Palo Alto and May field have
signified their intention of making an
extra charge for carriages on the
night of the Junior Prom. This de
cision was made when it was de
cided to serve the Prom, supper in the
University Inn. The liverymen argue
that if they are compelled to call at
Encina for their passengers, carry
them to the Inn and wait for them
there that they are entitled to make
an extra charge. They claim that
they will be compelled to pay their
drivers extra for the overtime which
they will be forced to stay out.
The scale of charges has been an
nounced as follows: for surries, $4.00;
three-seaters, $5.00; closed carriages,
$5.00, $6.00 and $7.00. To these
charges $2.00 will be added if the
carriages are used for the supper at
the Inn.
The sentiment is strong among the
students that a charge of $6.00 for a
surry and from $7.00 to $9.00 for a
closed carriage is too much and there
has been talk among some of com
bining against this arbitrary decision
of the liverymen.
