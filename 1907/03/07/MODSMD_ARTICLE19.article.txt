# Plans Made for San Jose Production.
## 
### 
Nothing but final arrangements
with the management of the Victory
Theater in San Jose remain to clinch
the first production on the Pacific
Coast outside the University, of
George Bernard Shaw's "You Never
Can Tell." The Sophomore Class
meeting in room 68 today, voted to
the members of the cast which played
"You Never Can Tell," the power to
make such arrangements. Professor
W. P. Durand, chairman of the Stu
dent Affairs' Committee, has given
his sanction to the outside produc
tion. The class voted that the sum o'
$50 be presented to Assistant Coach
I. B. Cross for the valuable aid he
had voluntarily offered in coaching
the cast.
The question whether the office of
class treasurer should be filled by
election or appointment was left in
the hands of the president by the
tacit consent of the class. Presidert
T. R. Cadwalader, '09, will probably
appoint within the next few days a
successor to N. E. Doan, ex-'og, who
has taken out a leave of absence from
the yniversity.
