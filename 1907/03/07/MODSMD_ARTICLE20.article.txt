# Josh Competition is Extended.
## 
### 
The Josh prize competition for the !
1908 "Quad," which closed on March
1, has been opened again, and the
time limit has been extended to April
1. Editor Hadley has received a num
ber of good joshes, the majority of
which can be used, but inasmuch as
the josh department is one of the
last sections of the "Quad" to close,
it has been determined to let the com
petition run until the first of next
month.
The joshes may be either poems,
straight jokes, or illustrated joshes,
and the prize of $5 will be awarded
as soon after the competition closci
as possible.
