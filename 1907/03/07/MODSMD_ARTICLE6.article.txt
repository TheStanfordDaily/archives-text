# To Hunt Down Author of "Bogey."
## 
### 
A concerted effort will be made by
the Student Body to discover and
punish the authors of the "Bogey,''
which appeared on the campus Tues
day morning. Several prominent up
perclassmen and graduate students
have taken the matter up, and will
meet tomorrow to organize them
selves into a committee to consider
ways and means of going about the
work. It is understood that these
men will secure financial backing and
will set out in earnest to hunt down
the perpetrators of the outrage. It
was planned at first to call a general
student body meeting for the passing
of resolutions upon the subject, but
it is understood that this scheme has
been abandoned.
