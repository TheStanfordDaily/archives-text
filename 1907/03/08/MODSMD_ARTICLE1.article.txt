# 1910 MEETS OAKLAND
## MEET TOMORROW MORNING ON NEW TRACK. Munn Will Be Member of Visiting Team.—Contest Should Be Close. 
### 
The first track meet with an out
side team will be held on the new
track tomorrow morning at 10, the
Freshmen running against the ath
letes from Oakland High School.
The outcome of such a contest is very
doubtful because of the little known
of the ability of the visiting men, but
the name of Munn among the list of
the Oakland entries makes it certain
that some high class performances
may be expected. For the Freshmen,
Maundrell, Shelton, Poor, Reed, Brad
ley, and Helsley, will undoubtedly be
point winners.
With the exception of the quarter
mile, the weights, the jump, and the
pole-vault, the Freshmen will send
strong men into every event. Reed
and Stevenson in the sprints will be
forced to run against Oakland's cap
tain, McDonald, but judging from the
way Reed covered the distances yes
terday, the Oakland man will be
forced to fast time if he is to win.
The High School has three entries
in the quarter, and these three men
are very liable to take the nine points
in that event unless some of the 1910
quarter men show more speed than
they have as yet.
If Moulton runs Maundrell in the
half-mile, the five points for the first
man should come to Stanford with
little trouble. Oakland has Hartwell
in both this event and the mile, but
he should prove no match for the
more experienced Freshman runner.
Robinson is the only entry of the
visiting team in both the high and
low hurdles and nothing is known of
his ability, but Bradley and Helsley,
while they do not clear the sticks in
Varsity style, are good performers,
and either should make a strong fight
for the first places.
In the weights and jumps Oakland
will make a clean sweep of the first
places. The Stanford bleachers have
seen Munn in these events and there
is no athlete among the entering class
that can take the hammer, the shot,
the high-jump, or the pole-vault, away
from this versatile athlete.
The officials in charge of the meet
will be as follows:
Starter—J. C. Macfarland, '07;
Clerk of the Course—C. F. Laumei
