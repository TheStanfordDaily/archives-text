The unfortunate incident which took
place on the bleachers at the track
meet last night requires little com
ment. The men who were respon
sible for the laughing at the expense
of the two-milers received a richly
deserved rebuke from the track cap
tain and will probably never be guilty
of the offense again. If they arc ca
pable of finding their fun only by
laughing at the athletes, who are do
ing something for their University,
they had better be kept away from
the athletic fields altogether.
