The meeting of the class of 1907
on Monday will probably decide the
fate of the cap and gown for men j
graduates. The adoption of the for- j
mal costume by the class of 1906 was j
an experiment, the results of which
will appear on Monday. If it is sanc
tioned by this year's graduating class
it will probably become an established
custom which future classes will fear
to attack. If on the other hand 1907
refuses to follow the precedent es
tablished by last year's class the mat
ter will have to be fought out before
every Commencement. The custom
is one which is certainly worthy of
permanent adoption. Those who wit
nessed the 1906 ceremonies last se
mester, will recall the impressive dig
nity which the formal attire of the
graduates lent to the occasionâ€”a dig
nity which has too seldom been a
part of Stanford Commencements.
The awarding of degrees by a univer
sity as large and important as Stan
ford should certainly be made an im
pressive ceremony and not as in the
past, merely the distribut ; on of sheep
skins rushed through with as hur
riedly as possible.
