# NEXT ASSEMBLY WEDNESDAY.
## President Jordan Will Lecture to Student Body on Evolution. 
### 
President Jordan will speak at the
next Assembly, the date for which
has been set for March 13, at 10:15.
The President intended to present
to his class in Evolution the results
of a biological study of the effects of
war. The committee on University
Exercises requested that instead of
giving the lecture to' a single class,
it might be open to the entire Uni
versity. Accordingly an Assembly
will be held at the hour of meeting
of the class in Evolution, 10:13. Pres
ident Jordan's address is entitled "'1 he
Human Harvest." It is in substance
identical with the address presented
by him at the .200 th anniversary of
Franklin's birthday at Philadelphia.
