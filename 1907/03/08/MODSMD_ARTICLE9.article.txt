# SHELL COMES MONDAY
## NEW BOAT IS ON STEAMER "NEBRASKAN." Eight-Oar Fails to Arrive This Week On "Arizonan" as Originally Expected. 
### 
Word was received this afternoon
by the Boat Club from the American-
Hawaiian Steamship Company that
the new shell will arrive at San Fran
cisco on the S. S. "Nebraskan" on
Monday next, ft was expected that
the eight would arrive on the S. S.
"Arizonan" which arrived last Mon
day, but a congestion of freight at
Salina Cruz made it necessary to send
the shell on the later boat. The shell
is carried on deck so that it will be
a comparatively easy matter to get
it off as soon as the vessel docks.
It is probable that the Boat Club
will have the shell brought to the
campus from San Francisco on wag
ons. This is the most feasible plan
and the least expensive one. The box
in which the shell is placed is 60 feet
long and weighs over 800 pounds, so
that it will be 110 light task transport
ing the boat, but it is hoped to make
the trip down from the city in two
days. Some members of the club will
probably go to the city to assist in
the handling.
Coach Murphy has reduced his
squad to about twenty men, and is
beginning to get these into shape by
commencing the harder work of the
season. Practically all the men row
twice a day on the lake and also take
dumbbell exercises to get their mus
cles into shape. In case arrange
ments are completed this week for
the trip South during the Easter va
cation, Murphy will begin getting a,
four into shape. He may possibly
take a couple of substitutes along
with the crew. In case the consent
of the faculty is obtained to take the
trip the matter will be closed and the
contract signed this week.
