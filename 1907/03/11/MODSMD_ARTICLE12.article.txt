Tonight a conference practically un
precedented in the history of inter
collegiate relations will be held at the
University of California. Stanford's
Executive Committee, which is purely
an undergraduate body, will confer
with California's Faculty Athletic
Committee upon the track meet dis
pute. Whatever the outcome of the
conference may be, the Stanford Stu
dent Body should give crcdit to Col
onel Edwards of California, for his
consent to the conference. It is an
unusual thing for a faculty body to
discuss student affairs on equal terms
with an organization of students and
Colonel Edward's consent to the
meeting was certainly a sportsmanlike
act. Tonight's discussion should see
a final settlement of the dispute, or at
least a mutual understanding which
will lead to a settlement in the near
future. Even if the matter is not set
tled however, the meeting will go a
long way toward healing the breach
between the two universities growing
out of the dispute. Each will have a
chance to hear the true presentation
of the other's case, ungarbled by the
metropolitan press, and this alone will
greatly relieve the present situation
