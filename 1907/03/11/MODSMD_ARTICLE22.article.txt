# No Meet With Oakland High.
## 
### 
The Oakland High School track
team was on the campus last Satur
day but their meet with the Freshmei
was cancelled because of the rain.
Ihe visiting athletes made an inspec
tion of the new track and left for
Oakland early in the afternoon. Sat
urday's meet was definitely can
celled and not indefinitely postponed,
because of the lack of a suitable date
for the contest in the future. Next
Saturday the Oakland team is entered
in the Bay Counties meet, the week
following the Interscholastic is to In
held, and on the 30th, the Stanford'
Freshmen are to meet the first year
men from California.
