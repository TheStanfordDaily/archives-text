ter:
March 8, 1907.
Mr. Clay R. Crider,
Secretary of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University.
Dear sir: Your letter of yesterday
reached me here this afternoon. In
answer to the request of your Exec
utive Committee, I am glad to be
able to say that our Faculty Commit
tee on Athletics will have great pleas
ure in meeting your delegation 011
Monday evening next at 8 o'clock, in
room 207, California Hall, Berkeley.
Very truly yours,
Geo. C. Edwards,
Chairman Faculty Committee on Ath
letics.
The members of the Executive
Committee feel that a settlement of
the track meet controversy can be
readied tonight as the executive com
mittee of the California students has
placed the matter in the hands of the
faculty committee across the bay.
The long-continued attempts of the
Stanford Executive Committee to ef
fect a second meeting of the Inter
collegiate representatives may be con
strued to have resulted in the confer
ence which will take place this even
ing. Tonight the principals in the
controversy will be brought together.
The meeting will probably do away
with the succession of messages
which has been kept going between
Stanford and California for the past
six weeks and also with all the un â€¢
certainty of the controversy.
The Executive Committee has al
ready formed a concerted plan of ac
tion for this evening, but will make
110 further statements concerning
their intentions. An informal meet
ing of the Committee to discuss plans
was held this afternoon just after the
meeting of the Student Body in As
sembly Hall.
