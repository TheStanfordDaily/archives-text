# Assembly Comes at Third Hour.
## 
### 
When the weekly University calen
dars appeared this morning it was
noticed that 11:15 was the hour an
nounced for the Assembly Wednes
day, although last Friday the Presi
dent's office gave 10:15 as the time for
the meeting. The latter hour is cor
rect. Much confusion was caused bv
the mistake.
