# SHELL HAS ARRIVED
## EIGHT-OARED REACHES SAN FRANCISCO. Will be Hauled to Campus at Once.-Expected Here on Thursday. 
### 
A telegram was received from the
American-Hawaiian Steamship Com
pany yesterday afternoon notifying
the Boat Club that the S. S. "Nebras
kan" had arrived at San Francisco,
and that the shell would be ready for
delivery this morning. It will-be im
possible to obtain the eight today,
but the fclub is making arrangements
this afternoon to start a lumber teaiji
for the city. If arrangements can be
completed, a team will start early to
morrow morning, arriving in the city
the same evening. A start will be
made with the shell 011 Wednesday
morning, and it is hoped it will reach
the campus sometime Thursday. So
far as can be ascertained the shell
made the trip in good shape, and as
soon as the outriggers and necessary
equipment can be installed, it will be
ready for use.
The shell will be the first eight used
on the Coast, and the members of the
club are more than pleased that the
boat arrived so early in the season.
Negotiations looking toward the pur
chasing of a shell were started last
semester, and as soon as the Exec
utive Committee voted the club the
necessary money the boat was pur
chased. It is practically a new boat
having been used.but once, and Coach
Murphy having inspected it in the
East gave it as his opinion that it
was the best second-hand boat in the
East that could be obtained.
It was the first intention to bring
the shell out by train, but as no guar
antee of delivery or suitable rates
could be obtained from the railroad
it was decided to trust to the steam
ers. The American-Hawaiian liava
delivered the shell in San Francisco
in better time than the railroads
would guarantee to make delivery and
at far less expense.
