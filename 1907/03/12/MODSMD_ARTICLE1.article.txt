# CREWS WILL GO SOUTH
## COACH MURPHY WILL TAKE NINE MEN TO NAPLES. Varsity Four Will Row San Diego Crew.â€”New Shell to go to Redwood. 
### 
On the 28th of this month two
crews will go South from Stanford
to compete in the regatta to be held
011 March 30th at Naples, a resort
near Los Angeles. The Boat Club
has been in communication with sev
eral Southern clubs for some time
past but it was not until this week
that the consent of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee was obtained to make
the trip.
Murphy will take nine men 011 the
trip, composing a first and second
crew. The Varsity will row against
the San Diego Boat Club for a hand
some trophy which will be offered by
the Stanford Alumni of Los Angeles.
It was expected that the Los Alami
tos, San Pedro, and Los Angeles row
ing clubs would compete in this race,
but when a junior race was arranged
these clubs preferred to enter their
crews in the latter contest. This
leaves the Senior race between Stan
ford and San Diego. The latter con
fidently expects to win, having had
a crew in training for over a year.
The Stanford second crew will prob
ably compete in the Junior four races.
The men will leave the campus on
the evening of the 28th, taking the
four-oared shell with them. They
will have one day in which to practice,
the race taking place on Saturday.
Murphy has not yet selected the men
who will make the trip, but is now
busy trying the candidates out and
will announce the two crews within
the next few days.
The club set to work last evening
to raise enough money from the Stu
dent Body to bring the new eight
oared shell to Redwood by tug, and
before midnight had succeeded in
raising enough money to warrant the
undertaking. Accordingly F. W. Tur
ner, '08, will leave for the city this af
ternoon to charter a tug. If arrange
ments can be made immediately the
shell will be taken to Redwood late
this afternoon or early tomorrow
morning. Tt will take several days to
putin the fittings and get the boat in
shape after the long trip, after which
it will be put into immediate use, the
men alternating in their rowing be
tween Lagunita and Redwood. No
word has been received from Califor
nia concerning the arrival of their
shells, but Murphy will continue with
his work of getting a Varsity eight
and Freshman four in condition to
race.
