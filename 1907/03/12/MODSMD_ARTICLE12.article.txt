Lack of interest on the part of its
members seems likely to cause the
dissolution of the Band at a time when
its services are most necessary. The
organization should at least be held
together until after the Interschol
astic meet and the Intercollcgiate
events of the present semester.
The trouble which is behind tin
threatened dissolution is the same
which reduced the Mandolin Club to
its present statusâ€”lack of interest on
the part of its members. In the case
of the Band there can be no excuse of
lack of suitable material, for ther?
are now thiry men on the Band roll,
riie fact that only eight or nine of
these men have been turning out fo
practices certainly does not speak
well for the spirit and unselfishness
of the other twenty or more men who
signified their willingness to back u i
the organization. The Band has al
ways been noted for the unselfishness
of its members and lias always been
pointed to as one of the most deserv
ing of Student Body organizations,
but in its present condition it has for
feited all its claims to Student Body
respect.
