# CHOOSE CAP AND GOWN
## 1907 ADOPTS FORMAL ATTIRE FOR COMMENCEMENT. Usual Seal Pin is Adopted After Long Discussion.â€”Many Want Rings. 
### 
The Senior class at a meeting in
room 68, 011 the Quadrangle this after
noon, adopted caps and gowns and the
customary class pin. On motion by
J. C. Macfarland, it was unanimously
decided that caps and gowns be worn
011 Baccalaureate Sunday, Class Day,
and Commencement Day.
There was considerable discussion
over the adoption of a class emblem.
Some favored a class finger ring,
while many were in favor of a pin.
On a motion by W. A. Campbell,
which was only carried after a stand
ing vote, it was decided to adopt the
pin that the previous classes have
worn. The pin will be in the form of
the Stanford seal with the class nu
merals engraved on the emblem. A
considerable number of the class were
in favor of breaking away from cus
tom by adopting a ring. Their chief
argument was that many would wear
such an emblem after graduating
while they would not care to wear
the pin.
