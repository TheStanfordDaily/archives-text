# TWO MEETS THIS WEEK
## Palo Alto to Clash With Campus Athletes Thursday.â€”1910 Meets Bay Counties Saturday. 
### 
There will be two track meets this
week, the athletes living in Palo Alto
running against the campus represent
atives Thursday afternoon at 4:30,
and the Cardinal Freshmen meeting
a picked team from the Bay Counties
League next Saturday morning at 10.
The new track is well drained, and
by tomorrow will undoubtedly be
hard enough for the men to resume
their work. The bleachers are being
rapidly rushed to completion, and the
finishing touches will be put on the
field and cinder path at once.
The interruption to training caused
by the heavy rains, together with the
slightly soggy path and field, will
probably prevent any very fast per
formances next Thursday, but Satur
day's meet against the star men of
the Bay Counties League will be a
severe trial of the Freshman material,
and should force them to good time.
