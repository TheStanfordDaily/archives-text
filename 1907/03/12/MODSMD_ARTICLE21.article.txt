# University May be Represented.
## 
### 
An act of the Legislature designed
to give Stanford University a repre
sentative on the State Board of Edu
cation now awaits the signature of
Governor Gillett. The act provides
for the submission to the people of
a constitutional amendment changing
the membership of the Board as ap
pointed by the Governor. Should the
amendment pass when it is voted on
two years hence, a professor in the
department of Education will prob
ably receive the appointment.
