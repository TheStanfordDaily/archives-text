# ARBITRATION ALMOST ASSURED.
## Committees Agree That Outside Tribunal Should Settle Track Dispute. — No Official Action by California. 
### 
Arbitration of the track meet dis
pute by a disinterested tribunal is prac
tically assured. The executive com
mittees of Stanford and California
met in Berkeley last night and after
a conference lasting over three hours,
decided that a presentation of the
case to an unbiased court was the
only solution of the difficulty. The
Cardinal Executive Committee offi
cially voted at the conclusion of last
night's meeting to refer the matter
to a board of arbitration. The Califor
nia governing body took no official ac
tion last night, but all of their mem
bers who were present at the meeting
unofficially expressed themselves as
favoring that method of settlement.
The Stanford committee went to
California with the intention of meet
ing California's Faculty Committee to
whom it was understood the matter
had been referred for settlement. The
meeting was held in California Hall
with the members of the California
Faculty Committee and Student Body
President Merritt and Graduate Man
ager Snedigar representing the Blue
and Gold. A short discussion brought
out the fact that the California Fac
ulty Comm'ittee did not believe itself
competent to take any binding action
in the matter under the Intercollegiate
Agreement. Colonel Edwards and
Professor Torrcy of the State Uni
versity both expressed themselves to
the effect that under the agreement
they could take jurisdiction of the
dispute only when acting in conjunc
tion with the Stanford Faculty Com
mittee as a court of appeal.
Since a settlement was impossible
under such circumstances, President
Merritt summoned the remaining
members of the California Executive
Committee and the representatives of
the two student bodies settled down
to discuss the controversy. From the
beginning it was evident that each
university was determined to abide
by the stand which it had already
taken in the matter. Stanford ad
vanced her claim to the meet under
the spirit of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment and California replied by point
ing to the letter of the law. The
Blue and Gold also contended that
the holding of the meet 011 the Stan
ford track would have the practical

effect of nullifying the agreement
since a rearrangement of the Fresh
man Intercollegiate would also have
to be made.
For two hours the committees
argued every aspect of the case and
at length reached the conclusion that
arbitration was the only solution
practicable. Stanford's committee at
once went into executive session and
passed a resolution which places tin
settlement of the case in the hands
of a board of arbitration composed
of disinterested parties. California
took no official action but deferred
their decision until the regular meet
ing of their executive committee on
Wednesday night.
If California adopts the proposition
at that meeting, the arbitration board
will be appointed and will meet at
once in order that a settlement of the
difficulty may be made. No definite
provision was made last night for the
composition of the arbitration board,
but in all probability it will be com
posed of six college graduates who
are not alumni of either of the two
contesting universities. Three mem
bers will be appointed by each Uni
versity.
Stanford's representatives will be
appointed by the Executive Commit
tee. In the California student body
constitution it is provided that the
Blue and Gold arbitrators in such dis
putes shall be named by the Presi
dent of the University. In this case
President Wheeler will probably be
called upon by the executive commit
tee of the State University to exer
cise his prerogative. The next defi
nite step in the settlement of the
dispute will probably be taken next
Wednesday night when the executive
committees of both universities hold
their regular meetings.

vanced her claim to the meet under
the spirit of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment and California replied by point
ing to the letter of the law. The
Blue and Gold also contended that
the holding of the meet 011 the Stan
ford track would have the practical

effect of nullifying the agreement
since a rearrangement of the Fresh
man Intercollegiate would also have
to be made.
For two hours the committees
argued every aspect of the case and
at length reached the conclusion that
arbitration was the only solution
practicable. Stanford's committee at
once went into executive session and
passed a resolution which places tin
settlement of the case in the hands
of a board of arbitration composed
of disinterested parties. California
took no official action but deferred
their decision until the regular meet
ing of their executive committee on
Wednesday night.
If California adopts the proposition
at that meeting, the arbitration board
will be appointed and will meet at
once in order that a settlement of the
difficulty may be made. No definite
provision was made last night for the
composition of the arbitration board,
but in all probability it will be com
posed of six college graduates who
are not alumni of either of the two
contesting universities. Three mem
bers will be appointed by each Uni
versity.
Stanford's representatives will be
appointed by the Executive Commit
tee. In the California student body
constitution it is provided that the
Blue and Gold arbitrators in such dis
putes shall be named by the Presi
dent of the University. In this case
President Wheeler will probably be
called upon by the executive commit
tee of the State University to exer
cise his prerogative. The next defi
nite step in the settlement of the
dispute will probably be taken next
Wednesday night when the executive
committees of both universities hold
their regular meetings.

Arbitration of the track meet dis
pute by a disinterested tribunal is prac
tically assured. The executive com
mittees of Stanford and California
met in Berkeley last night and after
a conference lasting over three hours,
decided that a presentation of the
case to an unbiased court was the
only solution of the difficulty. The
Cardinal Executive Committee offi
cially voted at the conclusion of last
night's meeting to refer the matter
to a board of arbitration. The Califor
nia governing body took no official ac
tion last night, but all of their mem
bers who were present at the meeting
unofficially expressed themselves as
favoring that method of settlement.
The Stanford committee went to
California with the intention of meet
ing California's Faculty Committee to
whom it was understood the matter
had been referred for settlement. The
meeting was held in California Hall
with the members of the California
Faculty Committee and Student Body
President Merritt and Graduate Man
ager Snedigar representing the Blue
and Gold. A short discussion brought
out the fact that the California Fac
ulty Comm'ittee did not believe itself
competent to take any binding action
in the matter under the Intercollegiate
Agreement. Colonel Edwards and
Professor Torrcy of the State Uni
versity both expressed themselves to
the effect that under the agreement
they could take jurisdiction of the
dispute only when acting in conjunc
tion with the Stanford Faculty Com
mittee as a court of appeal.
Since a settlement was impossible
under such circumstances, President
Merritt summoned the remaining
members of the California Executive
Committee and the representatives of
the two student bodies settled down
to discuss the controversy. From the
beginning it was evident that each
university was determined to abide
by the stand which it had already
taken in the matter. Stanford ad
vanced her claim to the meet under
the spirit of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment and California replied by point
ing to the letter of the law. The
Blue and Gold also contended that
the holding of the meet 011 the Stan
ford track would have the practical

effect of nullifying the agreement
since a rearrangement of the Fresh
man Intercollegiate would also have
to be made.
