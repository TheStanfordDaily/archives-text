afternoon by a score of 6 to 4. The
Varsity outliit the collegians but were
unlucky, hive of Stanford's six errors
were made by Cadwalader who had an
off day. Presley was forced to go
behind the bat 011 account of the ill
ness of Ganong and Owen was played

lows :
R. H. E.
Santa Clara 656
Stanford 4 10 6
The Varsity is scheduled to meet
St. Mary's tomorrow afternoon, but
the place of the game has not been
settled. It was originally intended
that the game should be played in
Oakland, but Manager Sales wired
the collegians this afternoon asking
that the contest be transferred to the
campus. The Varsity will probably
play practically the same line-up as
that which faced Santa Clara today
with Presley behind the bat and Owen
011 first. St. Mary's will present their
usual line-up.
