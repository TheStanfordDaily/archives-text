# WANTS TRIANGULAR DEBATE.
## Washington Asks Adoption of Round-Robin System.â€”Stanford is Unfavorable. 
### 
A letter from the University of
Washington has been received by W.
F. Herron, '08, proposing the institu
tion of a system of triangular debates
between Stanford, Washington and
California.
According to the plan proposed by
the northern university the team from
each university would debate twice,
meeting each of the other teams, the
one winning the majority of these
contests holding the championship.
While this plan would give an add
ed impetus to debating here, it is
doubtful if it will be considered, ow
ing to the great distance separating
Stanford from the northern univer
sity.
Even if the student debating inter
ests should consider the adoption of
such a plan there is still a doubt that
it would receive the sanction of tlu
faculty committee of either university.
