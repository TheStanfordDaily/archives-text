# THE 						HUMAN HARVEST
## PRESIDENT JORDAN DELIVERS STRONG ADDRESS. Downfall of Nations Brought About By Loss of Strongest in Times of War. 
### 
Dr. Jordan, in an address before
the Student Body in Assembly this
morning, sketched a phase of histori
cal evolution of ancient and modern
nations. "The Human Harvest,"' was
the subject of the President's address.
The downfall and upbuilding of na
tions by variation, heredity, selection,
and segregation, was depicted in a
strong address which held the atten
tion of the audience for an hour.
From ancient to modern times the
great harvest of the finest of man
kind has gone on, and the effect of
this harvest in the deterioration of
Europe and America was clearly
brought out in the President's ad
dress. Dr. Jordan sketched the de
cline and fall of Rome and Greece
from the time of the ancient emperors,
and of modern nations to the time of
the Russian-Japanese war.
Starting with the growth of the
Stanford stock farm Dr. Jordan
showed by analogy how the great
race of mankind has been developed
or could be weakened or strengthened
by selection and segregation or by
heredity. In rapid succession he told
how Rome lost its manhood through
the wars of the republic and the em
pire, bow Greece suffered a like fate,
and how some of the modern nations
arc following in the footsteps of the
ancients, not so much by war as nat
ural deterioration by heredity.
"So great grew the power of the
emperors," said Dr. Jordan, "that the
finger of Constantine became stronger
than the loins of Caesar." From this
he told how nations had fallen from
positions of self rule to positions of
slavery under masters who would
have been but slaves under the former
sturdier citizens of the same country
01* empire.
The decline of France after the
downfall of Napoleon from the peer
of nations in Europe to the level of
other countries by the loss of her son
in war, was one of the most interest
ing parts of Dr. Jordan's address.
War the great harvester, with
Plague and Famine as close brothers,
was shown to have gleaned the
strongest and best of the great pow
ers, leaving behind only the weak and
unworthy to breed nations of in
feriors. The inferiors in turn gov
erned those inferior to themselves
and thus deterioration has continued.
"The man with the hoe is not ;
product of oppression," said the
speaker, "but is a product of heredity.
It is the men who allow themselves
to be oppressed and not the oppres
sors who are to blame for conditions.
Dr. Jordan believes that Engiand
is still mentally and physically the
most able nation on the globe. He
showed, however, how the British na
tion was weakened by the emigration
to America of the inhabitants of De
von and Somerset, and how Amcrica
has had its foundations built froti
this sturdy stock. He concluded by
showing how the survival of the fit
test is the great rule of mankind, not
withstanding its apparently brutal
principles.
