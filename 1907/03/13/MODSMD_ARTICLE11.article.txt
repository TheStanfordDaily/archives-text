### 
The Phoenix team, of St. Mary's
College, took the second game of the
series from the Varsity this afternoon
with ease. The score was 4to o, and
fairly illustrates the comparative mer
its of the two teams. Long hits and
pretty work on the bases by the visit
ors did the work and the Varsity
found it hard to offset the clever
fielding of the collegians when on
bases themselves. Several opportun
ities to score fell to the home team
but each time Krause pulled himself
out of the hole. The work of the St.
Mary's southpaw was the prettiest of
the season. Three scattered hits was
the total made off his delivery.
The summary follows:
R. H. E.
Varsity o 3 5
St. Mary's ..4 6 2
