# THIRD MEET TOMORROW.
## Athletes From Campus and Palo Alto Will Contest.—Miller Entered in Half. 
### 
Palo Alto athletes will run against
tlie campus men tomorrow afternoon
at 4:30, in the fourth track meet of
the season. The track is faster than
it has been so far this year, and the
outlook is good for some interesting
races. Miller will run in the half and
Maundrell will be seen again in the
mile. \\ hether Palo Alto represent
atives or those from the campus will
succeed in making the greatest num
ber of points is very much of an open
question. Macfarland, Miller, Davis,
Holman, Maundrell, Sterling, Severy,
and Shelton, arc all from the campus,
and will take their share of the score,
but on the other hand Nash, Edwards,
Lanagan, Peaslee, Kocher, and Poor
will compete for the Palo Alto team
and a good part of the points must be
credited to these men.
