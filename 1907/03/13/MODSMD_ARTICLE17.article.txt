The metropolitan newspapers have
in general treated Stanford fairly and
impartially in their news columns
This has been due chiefly to the fact
that the Stanford correspondents ar
students at the University and they
have generally safeguarded our in
terests as far as it lay in their power
to do so. In the present "Bogey"
agitation the "Examiner" evident!;
sees opportunities for a sensational
story. Last night there appeared o<
the campus a special representative
of that paper. This man visited the
sorority houses and interviewed sev
eral of the prominent men students to
gain an idea of Student Body senti
ment in the matter. These interviews
will probably be incorporated in to
morrow's ; ssue of the "Examiner." It
seems as though this were an in
stance where the city press should
keep its hands off. The students have
already officially expressed their opin
ion of the "Bogey" and there is no
need for a repetition of that opinion
to the outside world in the guise of a
sensational newspaper article. Pre
vention of publication in this case is
an impossibility, but it would be well
for those who may be interviewed in
the future, to remember that the only
way to check the publication of such
articles is by refusing to furnish the
material with which they are con
structed. The good name of Stan
ford is not worth endangering for the
fleeting notoriety which the inter
viewed man 01* woman obtains.
