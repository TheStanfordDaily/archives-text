This morning the man
agement found a number of the
March posters with the cover design
torn off. Specific instances of such
reprehensible mutilation were noticed
in the Physics and Zoology building
and in Encina Hall. These posters
arc paid advertisements. If any one
wishing a "Sequoia" poster will men
tion the fact to the manager, extra
copies will be furnished free of cost.
Furthermore, a student is at liberty
to remove the cards from the Quae 1
windows after the sale is over. But
the "Sequoia" will take such measures
as are necessary to mete out the pun
ishment deserved, if such mutilations
are continued before the sale of the
publication. H. C. Green,
