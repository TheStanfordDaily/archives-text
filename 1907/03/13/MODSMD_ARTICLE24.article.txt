# Shell in Redwood Tomorrow.
## 
### 
The eight-oared shell will arrive
in Redwood tomorrow morning on
the schooner "Nonpareil."
Concerning the safe arrival of the
shell, F. W. Turner, '08, manager of
the Boat Club said: "Too much credit
cannot he given the Hawaiian Steam
ship Company for the way in which
they have handled the boat and this
at but a fraction of the cost to which
we would have been subjected had
we shipped by land."
The crew will make their first ap
pearance in the boat at Redwood next
Monday, as the remainder of the week
will be repuired for rigging the shell.
