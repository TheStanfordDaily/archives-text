# FRESHMAN RACE NOT OFF.
## Sales Denies Rumor That Stanford Has Refused to Row First Year Contest. 
### 
A dispatch printed in this morn
ing's "Chronicle," and dated "Berke
ley, March 12," states that "a proposal
submitted by the university boating
authorities to Stanford University for
an Intfirconegiate Freshman race be
tween eight-oared crews has been re
fused by the Stanford students. J.
Tyssowski, president of the Univer
sity of California Boat Club, after
conference with the Stanford official;
announced today that the Freshman
boat races between the two colleges
would not be held."
When questioned this afternoon
regarding these statements, Manager
Sales said they were absolutely false.
In reference to the Freshman Inter
collegiate race Sales said that as the
matter now stood California would
insist upon a Freshman eight-oared
race if their shell arrived before the
20th of this month but that otherwise
lie had been given to understand that
the race would be between four-oared
crews.
