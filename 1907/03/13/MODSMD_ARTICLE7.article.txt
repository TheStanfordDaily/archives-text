The representatives of the Rhodes

of California, have decided upon Far
num P. Griffiths, of the State Univer
sity, as the appointee to the Rhodes
Scholarship for California, for 1907.
The members of the committee were
as follows: Professor Stephens, of the
University of California, representing
President Benjamin Tde Wheeler of
that institution; Professor A. T. Mur
ray, of Stanford University, represent
ing President David Starr Jordan and
Dr. David P. Barrows, head of the
Philippine School System, represent
ing Dean Morton, of Pomona College.
Griffiths was not one of those who
took the examinations last January
He qualified himself for appointment
three years ago at the time Crittenden
of California received the scholarship.
Griffiths is at present private secretary
to President Wheeler.
C. S. Forncrook, '10, of Stanford,
who passed the examinations this se
mester, was disqualified on a techni
cality. Concerning his disqualifica
tion, Professor Murray said: "With
reference to the selection of the
Rhodes Scholar for this year I desire
to state in justice to Forncrook, that
he was technically ineligible as he
will not have completed his Sopho
more year in a university next fall.
Forncrook will be eligible for selec
tion next year without further tests
or examinations."
The appointment specifies that the
holder shall take up residence at Ox
ford next September. The scholar
ship is worth fifteen hundred dollars
a year for three years.
