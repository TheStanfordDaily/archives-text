# Hall to Go to Alaska.
## 
### 
H. H. Hall, '04, instructor in the
Civil Engineering department has re
signed his position and will leave at
the end of the month to engage in
hydraulic engineering in Dawson City,
Alaska. His classes will probably be
conducted by his associates for the
remainder of the semester, as the ap
pointment of his successor will not
take effect until next semester.
