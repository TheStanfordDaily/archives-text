Tomorrow night at 8, in Assembly
Hall, the German Club will present
Lessing's "Minna von Barnhelm," the
first German play ever presented at
Stanford by German students. All
arrangements have been completed
for presenting and staging the play.
The scenery and special costumes,
which have been selected with a view
of giving a thoroughly German at
mosphere to the play, have all ar
rived.
Coach Gray put the finishing
touches to the cast at the dress re
hearsal held last night.
"Minna von Barnhelm," one of the
most popular German comedies, gives
a splendid picture of Germany in the
eighteenth century. The old German
code of honor furnishes the motif
for the plot. Major von Tellheim, a
Russian officer, is deeply in love with
Minna von Barnhelm but determines,
for her sake, never to marry her, as
he is under the shadow of a crime
which he did not commit. Although
guiltless, his sense of honor will not
permit him to bring dishonor upon
her, by marrying her.
Minna, who is very much in love
with him and is clever enough to un
derstand the circumstances, tries to
prevent him from sacrificing both
their lives to his exaggerated sense of
honor. Just as she succeeds in her
purpose, word comes that the Major
has been completely exonerated from
any connection with the crime. Aside
from the plot, the most interesting
things in the comedy arc the strong
character delineations and the many
clever scenes and situations.
The curtain rises at 8 sharp.
