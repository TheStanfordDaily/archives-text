The Gerdes Fund has received con
tributions to the amount of but eighty
dollars since Dr. Gardner made his
appeal to the Student Body last Janu
ary. It must be that this meagre
return is due to the carelessness 112
Stanford men and women and not to
any refusal 011 their part to contrib
ute to a worthy cause. It would be
hard to find a person more deserving
of help than the unfortunate mother
of Otto Gerdes, and both students
and faculty should go deep into their
pockets to assist in raising the sum
asked for by Dr. Gardner. About the
only practical way of handling a vol
untary subscription of this kind is to
take it up by organizations so that
all may be systematically approached.
It is to be hoped that the close of
this semester will see the necessary
funds collected and the mortgage
raised from the Gerdes home.
