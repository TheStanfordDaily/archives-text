At the conference between the ex
ecutive committees of Stanford and
California held in Berkeley last Mon
day night, the Blue and Gold officers
were profuse in their assertions that
they had kept the track dispute out
of the newspapers. In fact one of
their most aching grievances agains;
Stanford was the freedom and pub
licity with which the matter had been
treated on the Cardinal campus. Tn
view of tliis fact, the Student Body
should defer judgment on the refusal
of California to arbitrate, as reported
in the San Francisco papers. Official
notice from the State Universit.
should reach the campus by tomor
row and the exact status of Califor
nia's latest move can then be deter
mined.
