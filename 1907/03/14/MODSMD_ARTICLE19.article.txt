# TELLS OF LITERARY MYTHS.
## Mrs. Austin Addresses English Club at Alpha Phi House Last Night. 
### 
Mrs. Mary Austin entertained the
English Club last evening at the Al
pha Phi house with a short talk upon
the general subject of "Literary
Myths." Her address was full of
interest, and her stories of the rough
incidents of Western mining camps
abounded in humor which was greatly
appreciated by her audience. Under
her subject of "Literary Myths," Mr.->.
Austin told of the literary fallacies
characteristic of the various literary
epochs, and explained what effect
these fallacies had upon the work of
the great novelists. "In the days of
Stevenson," said the speaker, "the
myth of the buried treasure was so
popular that England's great novelist
treated the subject in one of his best
works. Today neither the Ladies'
Home Journal nor the Youth's Com
panion would print a story of buried
gold. So with many other popular
myths which followed; the myth of
the poor factory girl who marries her
employer, the myth of the kind gentle
man who gives the starving tramp a
quarter only to have his kindness re
paid a thousand fold when the tramp
has made his fortune, both had their
run of popular favor and both died
the same death."
