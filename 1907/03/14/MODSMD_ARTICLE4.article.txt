# U.C. CHANGES FRONT
## PASSES CONTROVERSY BACK TO FACULTY. Dr. Angell Says that Stanford Faculty Will not Interfere in the Matter. 
### 
That California's end of the track
meet dispute is again placed in the
hands of the Blue and Gold faculty
athletic committee is the trend of
dispatches from Berkeley appearing
in this morning's papers. This ac
tion is reported to have been taken in
the meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Associated Students of the
University of California, which wa
held last evening. It was understood
by the Stanford men present at the
conference in Berkeley Monday night,
that the California executive commit
tee favored arbitration, and that last
evening's meeting would give forma
sanction to the proposition. But, pre
sumably under the plea of living up to
the Intercollegiate Agreement, the
Blue and Gold committee has placed
the dispute in the hands of their fac
ulty. Official notification of Califor
nia's action should reach the campus
by tomorrow.
Regarding the stand of the Stan
ford faculty in the present turn of the
controversy, Dr. Angell said: "The
whole matter is fast assuming a petrj
and ridiculous aspect. That the Fac
ulty Athletic Committees of the two
Universities are not intended as
courts of appeal in cases of disagree
ment between the executive commit
tees is evident from the following
article of the Intercollegiate Athletic-
Agreement: 'The Faculty Athletic
Committees of the respective univer
sities shall be courts of appeal in ail
cases of disagreement between stu
dent managers, captains, or other offi
cials of athletic teams.' From this,"
continued Dr. Angell, "it can be read
ily seen that disagreements between
the executive committees arc not
expected to be referred to the faculty
committees. The framers of the
agreement expressly intended that the
student committee should be entirely
independent of the faculty. As chair
man of the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee, I am still opposed to the matter
being passed up to the committee.
Even if we are requested to take
charge of Stanford's side of the (lis
pute, I doubt very much, if we would
accept the invitation. Stanford's ath
letics have always been conducted on
a high plane, and I want this to con
tinue. But if the faculty should in
terfere in athletic matters, Stanford'*
reputation for clean and sportsman
like conduct would suffer consider
ably."
Dr. Angell stated further: "If the
track meet is cancelled, all other Tn
tcrcollegiate athletic contests should
be called off. It would be better to
have 110 sports at all, than to hold
them when such hard feeling exists
between the contestants.
