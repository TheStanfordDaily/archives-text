# FIRST OUTSIDE MEET
## 1910 MEETS BAY COUNTIES TOMORROW. Picked Team of High School Stars Should Give Freshman Athletes Good Contest. 
### 
The star athletes of the Bay Coun
ties League will compcte with the
Freshman track men m the first out
side meet of the year tomorrow morn
ing at 10 o'clock on the new track.
The visitors, picked from the track
athletes of ten high schools, are a
strong and well balanced team. Such
men as Golcher of Lick, Macaulay of
Alameda, Hartwell of Oakland, All
sopp of Lick, Bressi of Lowell, and
Munn of Oakland, are among tlios
who will meet with the first year
men, and their performances will be
watched with great interest.
The chances of 1910 to carry off
the honors of the contest will hi
greatly improved by the addition o
L. S. Scott, '10, to their list of entries.
Scott will broad jump and vault, and
while it is very doubtful if he will b'e
able to take the five points in the
latter event from Munn, he should
beat Oakland's star performer in the
broad by a safe margin.
Golcher of Lick and Read o.f Low
ell, are credited with fast time in the
sprints, but it will cause a big surprise
if cither of them breaks the tape in
front of Reed, the Freshman runner.
The 1910 man forced Holman all the
way in both the two-twenty and the
hundred yesterday, and lost by the
narrowest of margins in good time.
The quarter should take nine points
from Stanford's score, but Maundrell
and Shelton will more than balance
this loss by their places in the half
and mile. Bradley and Ilelsley
against Allsopp and Bressi in the
hurdles should make a pretty race,
with the result hard to forecast.
Munn will be a tower of strength
in the field events and with the excep
tion of the broad jump should take
all the first places. The relay is al
ways a doubtful event, but with the
lack of quarter-milers among the
Freshmen the chances seem to favor
the visitors, who will select their
team from Bntler, Macaulay, Holmes,
Thompson, Allsopp, Smith, Poore,
and Vilas.
The officials in charge of the meet
will be the same as those appointed
for the Freshman-Oakland meet last
Saturday.
