Stanford has waived her right to
the track meet and the teams will
meet on the California campus. The
Executive Committee, confronted
with the alternative of a meet at the
State University or no meet at all,
chose the former alternative. Cali
fornia was offered arbitration, which
is the only reasonable solution of a
dispute where the contention of each
party is a strong one, and she refused
the offer after having unofficially ac
cepted it. She made as the basis of
her contention, the argument that the
attitude of the Stanford partisans
throughout the discussion was offen
sive in the extreme, and that in the
face of such an attitude a fair de
cision of the case on its merits
was impossible. Stanford has
always contended and always will
contend that under the spirit and let
%
ter of the Agreement she was entitled
to the meet, and she has yielded this
contention only in the face of the
threatened abolishment of Intercolle
giate relations.
