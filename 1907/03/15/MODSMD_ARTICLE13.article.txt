# THE
						FACULTY ATTITUDE
## DR. ANGELL GIVES HIS VIEW OF TRACK DISPUTE. Says Faculty Committee is Opposed to "Bickering Or Contention."â€” Offers a Correction. 
### 
The"Daily Palo Alto" is in receipt
of the following communication from
Dr. Frank Angell, which is self-ex
planatory :
Editor of "Daily Palo Alto":
"In your last night's issue, the
writer is reported to having given ut
terance to the somewhat remarkable
statement that Stanford's reputation
for "clean and sportsmanlike conduct"
would suffer if the faculty interfered
in athletic matters. This is so obvi
ously a mistake that it would hardly
be worth while directing attention to
it were it not that, as it stands the
statement implies a criticism of the
action taken by California, which the
writer would be very far from mak
ing. The stand taken by the Faculty
Committee here is very simple. First
and foremost, sports should be con
ducted by those entering into them
in a spirit of kindliness and courtesy.
The position of college students in
sports as college students, makes con
duct dictated by such a spirit of
double importance, and where it gives
way to one of bickering or conten
tion, whether the fault lies with Stan
ford or the other side, the committee
1 feels it is better for both sides and
for the sport itself that intercollegiate
competition in the sport should
cease." Frank Angell.
