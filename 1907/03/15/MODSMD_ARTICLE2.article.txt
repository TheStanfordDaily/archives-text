# Plans for Southern Trip.
## 
### 
Captain Macfarland and Graduate
Manager Sales are negotiating for a
meet to be held in the South against
the University of Southern California
on the 30th of this month. The team
will be obliged to go without its 191 c
members if the contest is finally ar
ranged because of the Intercollegiate
Freshman meet on that date. At a
meeting of the track men last night
it was unanimously voted to make
the trip, and Sales will attempt tc
close the negotiations at once.
