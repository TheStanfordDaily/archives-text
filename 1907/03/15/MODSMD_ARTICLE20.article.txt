Tickets for "La Serena" will go on
sale Monday morning at 8, at the
Bookstore and the University Drug
Store, Palo Alto.
The production of "La Serena"
promises to be the most elaborate
opera produced on the Stanford stage.
The scene of the play, which is a
musical comedy in three acts, is laid
in South America and the story
abounds in exciting and amusing cir
cumstances.
The music for the opera has been
brought from the East and especially
adapted to ''La Serena" and much of
it will be heard for the first time on
the Pacific Coast. The committee
has spared no pains in making the
show scenically perfect. Twelve spe
cial pieces of scenery will be used in
staging the opera and new costumes
for both cast and chorus have been
made by Goldstein and Company, of
San Francisco.
Cast and chorus have been rehears
ing together for some days and Coach
Edwards expects to have the play
ready for production by Monday
evening though light rehearsals will
be held Tuesday and Wednesday.
