# STANFORD WAIVES RIGHT TO MEET.
## Executive Committee Ends Controversy at Special Meeting and Track Men Will Compete at California. 
### 
Whereas—A disagreement having arisen over the place of holding the
annual track meet between Stanford University and the University of Cal
ifornia, and ,
Whereas, the executive committee of the University of California having
acknowledged that their refusal to allow the track meet to be held at Stan
ford is based not upon inherent justice but upon the alleged offenses
committed by press representatives in reference to the present dispute, and
upon disagreements between the two universities long since settled, there
fore,
Be it Resolved that we, the Executive Committee of Stanford University
in meeting assembled, in the interests of true sport and in order to prevent
the cessation of intercollegiate relations, consent that the track meet be
held on the California campus, thus waiving our rights under the spirit and
letter of the Intercollegiate Agreement, and
Be it further resolved, That our waiver of our rights under the agree
ment is not based upon the belief that our stand in the matter is wrong
but is made in order that intercollegiate relations between the two univer
sities may continue.

The above resolutions granting the
track meet to California, were passed
by the Executive Committee in a
special meeting held this afternoon,
and forwarded to the executive com
mittee of the Associated Students of
the University of California.
This action came as a complete sur
prise to the Student Body at large,
after the prolonged tight the commit
tee has made to secure the track meet
here. In no way do the resolutions
admit that Stanford has been in the
wrong in the controversy, but they
rather maintain that the Cardinal has
acted only according to her rights.
These are waived, at present, in the
interests of sport and in order that
intercollegiate contests between Stan
ford and the University of California
may be continued.
The Executive Committee has been
convinced after repeated attempts to
bring the California athletic author
ities into reasonable conference on
the dispute, that the Blue and Gold
will not discuss the question on its
merits. The merits of the case lying
with Stanford, the committee has pur
sued the only course and yielded the
entire object for which they were con
tending.
The original difficulty of dispute
arose over the action taken by the
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee
last January. The committee left the
agreement to be interpreted by the
graduate managers, Stanford's repre
sentatives basing their action on a
copy of the agreement which would
give the meet to the Cardinal campus.
But the California men had previously
informed themselves of the technical
interpretation of the agreement as
amended, and felt secure in leaving
the matter to the managers for inter
pretation. When it was found out

that the technical wording of the
agreement would give the meet to
Berkeley, the Executive Committee
under its stated prerogative in the
agreement, refused to ratify the ac
tion of the Stanford representatives.
Then started the train of letters and
special meetings and, on the part of
California, an attempt to place the
dispute in the hands of the Faculty
Athletic Committee.
The special meeting of the Execu
tive Committee today was called on
the receipt of a letter from California,
stating reasons for refusing to sub
mit the matter to a board of arbitra
tion, which was unofficially agreed
upon in the conference of the two
executive committees last Monday
evening. The California letter fol
lows :
Berkeley, March 14, 1907.
Mr. Clay R. Crider,
Sec. A. S. S. U.
Dear Sir: At the regular meeting o r
the executive committee last evening
your communication of the 12th inst.,
notifying us of your action in the
track dispute, was read. I was in
structed to notify you that our exec
utive committee cannot see its way
clear to discredit its representatives at
the last meeting of the Intercolc'giate
Agreement Committee, and secondly,
that we cannot agree to submit the
matter to a board of arbitration, unti'
it has been acted upon by the Faculty
Athletic Committees of the two uni
versifies who, under Act 111, Sec. 2.
of the Agreement, constitute a com
of appeal. We have submitted th
matter to our Faculty Committee t<
treat with the Faculty Committee of
Stanford, and await your action in tin
matter.
Sincerely yours,
C. H. Ramsden,
Sec. A. S. U. C.
