# TO DECIDE ON RUGBY RULES.
## Intercollegiate Revision Committee Will Hold Final Meeting of the Year Tomorrow. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Rugby Rules
Committee will hold its second meet
ing tomorrow evening in San Fran
cisco. The committee, composed of
Coach James F. Lanagan, '00, Foot
ball Captain W. Koerner, '08, and Dr.
T. M. Williams, '97, for Stanford, and
Coach O. N. Taylor, Captain Tuller
and Percy Hall, for California, will
probably take definite action on the
proposed changes in the rules and ad
journ until next } r ear.
The changes in the English Rugby
rules, which were discussed at the
first meeting, will be considered.
These were proposed by the Califor
nia representatives. The Blue and
Gold men want to see a referee al
lowed on the field in addition to the
umpire, so that infringements of the
rules can be more fully observed and
penalized. The other important
change in the rules would make the
score after a penalty goal count two
points instead of three. The Califor
nia men advanced the argument that
at present a team which scores an
earned goal has no advantage over
the side which makes a goal on a pen
alty. A few changes of minor im
portance will be considered. A try
when a man is in possession of the
ball behind his opponents' goal-line,
will also probably be allowed. Coach
Lanagan is in favor of this change.
