# PLAY IS A SUCCESS
## "MINNA VON BARNHELM" IS WELL PLAYED. De Haas and Miss Stauff Score Marked Success.—Fifty Dollars Cleared for Guild. 
### 
The production of Lessing's "Minna
von Barnhelm," Friday night in As
sembly Hall by the German Club, was
an unqualified success. When the dif
ficulties under which the German Club
worked are considered, —the few stu
dents available for parts and the ex
tremely short time the cast had in
which to rehearse, and the fact that
the play was given in a foreign lan
guage, the success of the play seems
all the more remarkable. No small
credit is due to Coach Gray for the
success of the production. The acting
throughout was extremely good, each
member of the cast giving a thought
ful interpretation of his or her part.
'1 he unity of the play prevented any
one member of the cast from starring.
J. A. de Haas, '08, in the roles of Jus*:,
the faithful servant, and Riccault the
Frenchman, probably achieved the
greatest personal success. His rend
ering of his parts showed marked in
terpretative ability.
Miss Ida Stauff, '07, in the title role
of Minna, played her part with grace
and feeling. Her acting showed that
she fully appreciated the possibilities
and spirit of her part.
C. Reining, '09, as the host, gave a
clever and thoughtful interpretation
of his part. The other members of
the cast —J. W. Smith, '07, as Major
von Tellheim; H. P. Bittner, '07, as
the count; H. Peters, '07, as Paul
Werner; Miss E. A. Wright, '08, as
Franciska, the maid; and Miss A.
Meyer, *07, as the lady in mourning,
showed considerable dramatic ability
and much careful work in the acting
of their parts.
A feature of the performance was
the music rendered by the Stanford
Orchestra. Its rendition of the old
German operas added much to the
production. After paying the ex
penses incidental to the production
the German Club will have about fifty
dollars to donate to the Guild Hos
pital.
