The first definite steps in the or
ganization of the long discussed musi
cal club will be taken Wednesday
night at a meeting called for that pur
pose by Professor Searles. The new
organization is planned to include in
its membership all those in college
who are interested in music for its
own sake. It is to be hoped that the
musicians of the University will back
up Professor Searles in his efforts to
perfect this scheme. While the or
ganization may not take a direct part
in musical affairs, it is bound to cxer
cise a powerful influence upon them.
The lamentable condition of the Man
dolin Club and the Band is strong
evidence that something is wrong, ami
the centralization of all these organi
zations in the proposed club suggests
a possible remedy. At all events such
a club should bring the diverse musi
cal interests into closcr relationship,
and should prevent the present state
of affairs under which they often work
at cross purposes. Professor Searles'
experiment is a worthy one and the
musical organizations should co-oper
ate with him to insure its success.
