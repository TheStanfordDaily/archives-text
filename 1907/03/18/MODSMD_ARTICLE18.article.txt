### 
The meeting of musicians called for
next Wednesday evening in room 241
at 7 :30, is the first definite step toward
the formation of a Stanford music
club. This idea has for some time
been under consideration by those in
terested in music and is the result of
the efforts of Professor C. Searles, of
the Romanic Languages department,
to organize those who enjoy music
for its own sake.
It is not the intention of the pro
moters to organize a club for the pur
pose of giving trips or recitals, but
merely to furnish an opportunity for
those who are interested in music for
any reason whatever, to meet 011 mu
tual ground, and ultimately, to secure
quarters for a club room containing a
piano, good music and other musical
instruments for the use of the club
members.
