# ALLOW RUGBY UMPIRE
## RULES COMMITTEE HOLDS LAST MEETING. Score for a Penalty Goal Remains Three Points as Under the English Rules. 
### 
One change in the Rugby rules un
der which Stanford will play the Uni
versity of California next season was
made Saturday evening by the Inter
collegiate Rules Committee meeting
at the Palace Hotel, in San Francisco.
An umpire, in addition to the regular
referee, will be allowed on the field if
the captain of either team states such
a desire before the game commences.
The only other innovation, to reduce
the score for a penalty goal from
three to two points, was not passed.
The committee thought that such a
change would put a premium 011 un
fairness. If a team had scored thre"'
points 011 a try or an earned goal, and
then was reasonably certain that their
opponents were going to score on
them, the team which had scored first
could purposely make an offside play,
bringing about a penalty kick. A
goal from such a kick would net their
opponents but two points under the
proposed change.
With the change already adopted,
which allows a try when the ball is
carried over the opponent's goal line
without being touched down, the ac
tion taken Saturday includes the mod
ifications to the English rules which
will govern the next Intercollegiate
football games. In all probability the
committee will not meet again this
semester.
