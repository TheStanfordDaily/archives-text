# PLANS FOR JUNIOR PROM
## Committee Will Attempt to Avoid Confusion Before Dances.â€”Dance Begins at 7:30. 
### 
The Junior Prom. Committee has
arranged a plan by which they hope
to do away with a great deal of the
confusion which ordinarily results at
the beginning of each dance on the
program. In order to assist the men
in finding their partners the ladies will
be asked to select some part of the
hall and return there after each dance,
thus enabling the men to gain a def
inite idea of where to go for their
dance. The first number will be a
grand march, led by the President and
Vice-President of the class. No
tables will be reserved for special
parties in the dining-room, but those
wishing to sit together may do so by
going to supper in one party. The
dance will begin at 7:30 and tickets
must be presented at the door. The
programs will be mailed this week.
