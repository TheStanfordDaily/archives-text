## TWENTY-EIGHT SCHOOLS IN INTERSCHOLASTIC. No Foundation in Report from San Francisco on Lack of Scholarship Requirements. 
### 
Ihe statement which appeared in
one of the San Francisco papers this
morning to the effect that the prin
cipals of the Wilmcrding, Cogswell,
and Lick schools, are considering
withdrawing the track teams of their
respective schools from the Inter
scholastic meet is without foundation.
The article states that the two reasons
for the withdrawal of the entries are
that the teachers object to the admis
sion of Palo Alto High School ath
letes without their principal's permis
sion and also that they do not look
with favor upon the absence of a
scholarship requirement in the condi
tions of entry. The Palo Alto men
have been refused permission to com
pete without the signature of the
principal upon their blanks, and for
this reason will not be seen in the big
meet this year. The scholarship re
quirement has always been and still
is in force. The entry blanks are very
clear in this respect and the principal's
statement of the athlete's standing in
the school is necessary before any
man is allowed to compete.
The entries for the Interscholastic
meet have all been received by Sec
retary Laumeister, and a list of the
contestants will be sent tomorrow to
all the schools In oider to make pos
sible any protests which the track
captains may wish to make. The en
