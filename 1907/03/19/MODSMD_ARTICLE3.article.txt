there seems to be 110 serious danger
of an overflow of Lagunita. The
water rose two feet last night and the
continued rain brought it up ten
inches higher by this morning. The
fountain and the flume have been shut
off. and men arc watching the em
bankment to guard against a possible
break. Should the dam weaken, the
bank near the Stock Farm will be
lowered and the overflow turned tbat
way.
