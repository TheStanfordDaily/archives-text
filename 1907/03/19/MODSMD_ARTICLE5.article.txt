## ENTRIES IN FOR SPORTS ON LAGUNITA. Interclass Crews Selected for Friday's Regatta.—Many Interesting and Novel Events Planned. 
### 
Friday afternoon, Junior Day, will
be given over to aquatic sports and
contests of various kinds instead of

tom in past years. There will be tub
racing, short and distance swimming,
canoe racing, high and fancy diving
from a fifty-foot platform which is to
be erected for the purpose, and other
interesting events. There will also be
a water polo game. The Junior Day
committee has made a new departure
in inaugurating these games and is
sparing no pains or expense to make
them a complete success. All event
which will doubtless arouse a good
deal of interest will be the interclass
boat races. Each four will row once
around the lake against time.
The University Band will occupy a
stand upon the bank and play during
the afternoon. No spectators will be
