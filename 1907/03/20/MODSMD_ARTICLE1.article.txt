# RAINS CAUSE DELAYS
## PREP. SCHOOL TEAMS MAY BE LATE. Washouts Reported on Many Railroad Lines.—Los Angeles Trains are Still Running. 
### 
The protracted rains have caused
severe wash-outs in both the North
and South, and there is a distinct pos
sibility that the track teams travelling
over certain lines may be delayed so
long that their attendance at the In
tercollegiate meet will be an impos
sibility. There are two serious
breaks between here and the South,
a cave-in of tunnel number 6 011 the
Southern Pacific line near San Luis
Obispo, and a landslide near Pajaro,
which has covered the tracks of the
same company. Trains are running
to Los Angeles at present, the pass
engers being forced to walk around
the breaks, but the danger lies in the
probability of more serious damage if
the storm does not clear.
In the North the reports are even
more startling. Above Sacramento
the road-beds are practically washed
away by the mountain streams which
are heavily swollen by the great
masses of melted snow. The dis
patches state that between Wheat
land and Marysville, between Briggs
and Nelson, and between Vina and
Thelma, it is impossible for trains
to stay on the track.
The most serious problem is. faced
by the Ukiah team which will come
down by the Northwestern Pacific,
whose tracks are reported to be in a
serious condition. The Seattle team
should have no difficulty as the Over
land comes down on the other side
of the Sacramento river. Chico,
and Marysville will both be af
fected by the wash-outs at Wheat
land and Marysville, although they
will be able to get through if there
is no more damage to the transporta
tion facilities. All of the Southern
teams —Harvard, Los Angeles High,
and Los Angeles Polytechnic, will
have difficulty, and may be seriously
blockaded if it continues to rain.
The Interscholastic has made out
the final list of officials for the meet.
Changes have been made in two in
stances where it was found impos
sible for those first suggested to
serve. Dr. H. B. Reynolds, '96, will
officiate as referee in the place of D*.
F. Angell, who will serve as one of
the timers. H. L. Ilorton, ex-'oS,
who was to be a field judge, will noz
fill that position as he will not be
present at the meet.
