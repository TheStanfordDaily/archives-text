# JUNIOR DAY "CHAPPIE"
## Special Issue Will Appear Thursday Morning.â€”Social Service Club Investigated in This Number. 
### 
The special Junior Day number of
the "Chaparral" will be placed on sale
Thursday morning, and will be sold
for twenty-five ccnts. This issue is
a specially large one, and is devoted
wholly to the interests of the 1908
class.
There is much art work of a high
quality in the issue. E. E. Horowitz,
'06, contributes a beautiful girl's head,
called the "Queen of the Prom." W.
R. Davenport, ex-'oo, is represented by
a full-page drawing of a Junior man
and girl. Other clever drawings are
by M. J. Helmick, '09, called "The
Day After,"and "Scandal." D. H.
Ferry, '08, has drawn a clever repre
sentation of a college woman's idea
of the Junior Prom.
Among the literary features there
is the fourth exposure of Stanford
organizations, the Social Service Club.
L. S. Levy, '08, contributes some
"Nursery Lays for Junior Days," and
a column of Society Gossip. Some
humorous short verse is by F. A. Cur
tin, '08.
In the "Now Thats" the editor says
some funny things about Junior Day,
knocks the exorbitant livery rates of
the Palo Alto busmen, treats harshly
of the "Sequoia's" recent article on
Encina politics, and names the offi
cers of the "Chaparral" and the new
members for next year.
