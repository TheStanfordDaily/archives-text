## Irish Student Resents Advertising Methods of Junior Farce Committee. 
### 
Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
As you are no doubt aware the
parties in charge of the Junior Farce
have taken advantage of "St. Pat
rick's Day" to advertise "La Serena."
No fault could be found if the refer
ence were a proper one, but as an
Irish student of the University I wisli
to enter my protest against the ridicu
lous caricature sent out.
The attempt to typify the Irish
race by resort to overdrawn and
senseless caricature, as was done in
this case, has long since become bad
form. There was a time, it is true,
when so-called comic papers and
cheap variety shows made a point of
distorting their Irish characters as
boisterous, senseless monstrosities.
As fair-minded people have long
since ceased to be amused at thess
attempts to ridicule the Irish people,
it is certainly surprising to find such
an out of date "Bogey" emanating
from a University organization.
Every element in the University,
that has not rendered itself obnoxious,
has a right to demand respectful
treatment. There is no excuse for a
college organization outraging the
feelings of fellow students as a busi
ness getter.
