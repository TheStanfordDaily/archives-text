# MEET OREGON IN MAY
## CONTEST WITH POMONA ON APRIL 9. Committees Meet Sunday in San Francisco to Make Final Arrangements for Meet. 
### 
Dates for two important meets ami
the calling off of the meet with
Southern California were develop
ments in track affairs today. After
negotiations lasting over a consider
able period a meet has been arranged
with the University of Oregon and
the date set definitely for May 4.
Oregon is anxious to pit its fast men
against the Cardinal in order to more
firmly establish its prestige on the
Coast and in the East. Such men as
Kelly, the phenomenal 100-yard
sprinter, and others who are well
known in the Northwest, will com
pete against Stanford.
Stanford will take fifteen men on
the trip to Eugene, where the meet
is to be held. The Cardinal will have
the advantage of longer training, but
Oregon has several star individual
performers to offset this. As Oregon
is enthusiastic in all matters pertain
ing to track work, the trip should be
financially profitable. The northern
university has guaranteed to pay $500
for expenses.
Another important meet definitely
arranged is that with Pomona Col
lege. which has been set for April 9,
and will be held on Stanford's new
track. As the college men in the
South have some fast material the
meet should be well contested.
Because of the Southern trip of the
Varsity crew in April, the track meet
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia, scheduled for March 30, has
been called off. The Southerners ob
jected to having counter attractions
at Los Angeles at the same time, and
it was suggested by them that the
track meet be called off. Manager
Sales consented.
Arrangements for the 1910 Fresli
man meet will be made Sunday night
when committees representing Stan
ford and California meet in San Fran
cisco to determine eligibility of con
testants, arrange the heats and ap
point officials to act at the meet. The
delegates arc Manager Sales and
Track Captain J. C. Macfarland. '07,
for Stanford, and Manager Snedigar
of California, and Track Captain N.
E. Wilcox, for California.
