In the storm on Monday the drain
which runs under the crossing be
tween the Quad and the junction of
Lasuen and Alvarado, was broken in.
The University watchman covered
the hole in the crossing with a box
and placed a lantern over it as 1
danger signal to passers-by. About
an hour later lie returned and found
that someone had removed the lan
tern. This is not the first time that
warning lanterns placed around the
campus have been stolen. The pres
ent instance, however, is so flagrant
that it calls for some comment. Any
reasonable man can appreciate the
danger resulting from the removal oi
these lights, and tbere are few men
who would be willing to accept the
responsibility of the accidents con
sequent upon their removal. The
brainlessness of such actions is
doubly flagrant when they are done
by college men who are supposed to
be possessed of as much, if not more,
reason than the average mortal. If
the man who removed the lantern
011 Monday night can be apprehended,
his punishment should be swift and
severe.
