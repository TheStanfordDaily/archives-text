# Gore is Declared Eligible.
## 
### 
It was definitely decided today that
J. F. Gore, '10, outfielder on the Var
sit}' squad, is eligible to compete in
the Intercollegiate baseball games.
Gore is registered from the Agricultu
ral College of the University of Min
nesota, and because of this Dr. An
gell struck his name from the list of
eligibles. It seems, however, thai
the Freshman fielder really came from
the Minnesota Agricultural School
which has not collegiate standing.
On ascertaining this, Dr. Angell im
mediately sent Gore's name to Cali
fornia, and no protest is anticipated
from the l!lue and Gold.
