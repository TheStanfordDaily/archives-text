# RAIN STOPS BALL GAME.
## Santa Clara Contest Called Off in Third Inning With Score a Tie. 
### 
The baseball game between the
Varsity and Santa Clara on the lat
ter's diamond this afternoon, was
called in the first half of the third
inning, on account of rain, with the
score standing i-i. The collegians
put one run across the plate in the
first. In the second inning Stanford
tied the score. Dudley walked and
Goodcll's long three-bagger brought
him home. Owing to the fact that
the game did not last the required
five innings, it was declared no con
test. Goodell pitched for the Var
sity, Daily was behind the bat and
Dudley held down right field.
