paratory school athletes who are to
compcte in the Interscholastic meet

ternities and the Encina men have
responded to the requests of the As
sociation with a generosity exceeding
that of last year, and have more than
maintained Stanford's reputation for
hospitality. It is now incumbent
upon the Student Body to treat our
visitors as we would treat one of our
own teams the night before an im
portant meet. The Row and Hall
must be kept as quiet as possible to

must be given every chance to rest
before the big contest on Saturday.
