# MAKES REPLY TO CRITICISM.
## Irishman Who Does not Believe that Cartoon Was a Reflection on His Race. 
### 
Editor "Daily Palo Alto":
As a student of Stanford Univer
sity and one whose grandparents 011
both sides hailed from dear old Erin,
I wish to reply to the communication
appearing in your last issue, which at
tacked tlfe Irish cartoon advertise
ment recently issued by students in
charge of advertising the Junior
Farce. I should dislike very much
to have it generally understood that
said communication voices the senti
ments of the entire Irish element here
at Stanford. Some of us, I hope and
believe the majority of us, are not
so sorely "peeved."
The "Student" speaks of the car
toon as "an attempt." It was more
than that, it was attainment—a suc
cessful attainment in caricaturing .1
not very handsome Irish face. Now
I don't know what "Student" looks
like—let us hope he is a handsome
Apollo—but I do know from actual
personal observation that there are
some Irishmen who never need fear,
on retiring, that during their slumber
they will be mistaken for "Sleeping
Beauties."
Surely there was no danger of mis
taking the face on the cartoon for
that of a Persian or any other nation
ality except Irish, consequently it
must be considered a good caricature
of the typical, unhandsome Irish face.
And after all it was a good face —
bright, cheerful and honest.
I am positive it was not an attempt
to ridicule the Irish people, for the
chairman of the committee respon
sible for it, is an Irishman himself,
with a fine old Irish name, a thor
oughly Irish face, a healthy Irish
body, and genuine Irish patriotism
and loyalty.
The communication of "Student"
sounds very narrow and pessimistic
for the utterances of a real Irishman.
If he is really Irish he must be study
ing too hard.
