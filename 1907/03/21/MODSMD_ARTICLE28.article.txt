# DECIDE TO WALK TO PROM.
## Representatives from Hall and Row Will Back Up Resolutions of Woman's Conference. 
### 
To walk or not to walk to the
Prom. That is the question which
has been uppermost in the minds of
the Juniors for the past week. To
abide by the resolutions of the Wo
man's Conference or to follow the
custom of past years and attend the
class dance in carriages, seems to
have been an equally difficult point
for the women to decide.
It is all settled now, however. Ev
erybody will walk tonight and tomor
row night. The women are taken at
their word, and the livery trust seems
doomed at last. Such was the deci
sion arrived at, at a meeting of rep
resentatives from the Hall and the
Row this afternoon. All orders for
carriages will be cancelled and the
busmen are defied to do their worst.
The weather gives promise of clear
ing and even should the night be
stormy the Juniors have a trump card
which they have not yet played and
which they think will satisfy all par
ties concerned.
At the request of the Prom, com
mittee Treasurer Lathrop gladly came
to the rescue of the students in their
fight against the livery trust and
agreed to clear the cross-walks. Sev
eral loads of cinders were placed at
the disposal of the committee and by
tonight every approach to Assembly
Hall and Encina will be free of mud.
