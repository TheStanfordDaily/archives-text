# Will Report on Sophomore Play.
## 
### 
Over $400 will be turned into the
Sophomore treasury by G. B. Bush,
'09, chairman of the play committee,
when the accounts of the committee
are settled. The only bills which
have not yet been received are those
for the scenery and expressage on
properties. These will amount to
more than $200. They are now due,
and as soon as they are received Bush
will make out his final report to the
class.
