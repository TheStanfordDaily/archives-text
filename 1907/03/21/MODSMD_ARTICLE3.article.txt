# Interscholastic Teams Delayed.
## 
### 
Dispatches from the South state
that a freight wreck at Barstow has
caused a twelve-hours' delay of all
Southern trains. The Los Angeles
High and Harvard Schools are due
here tonight at 9:30, but because of
this delay it is very doubtful if they
arrive before tomorrow afternoon.
Nearly all the other teams arc due
tomorrow and the Interscholastic
entertainment committee has arranged
to meet every train with buses until
late in the evening. On the Row and
the Hall active preparations are go
ing forward for the reception of the
men, and it is now certain that the
205 visitors will be comfortably ac
commodated.
