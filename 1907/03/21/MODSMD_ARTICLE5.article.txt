dual exhibition with a picked team

communication from O. S. Lousley,
'05, Physical Director of the Los An
geles High Schools, challenging the
club to a contest with his picked team,
which at present holds the champion
ship lor Southern California.
As several members of the club
are assistants in the gymnasium, re
ceiving pay from the University, the
club decided that it could not hold
such a contest. In place of the con
test a dual exhibition was suggested.
This will take the place of the regu
lar annual exhibition given by the
Gym. Club. The club has been mak
ing extensive plans for the event-,
three practices being held each week,
and from present indications the ex
hibition this year will greatly surpass
