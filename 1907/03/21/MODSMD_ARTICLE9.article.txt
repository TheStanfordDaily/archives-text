# 1907 REPORT IS DELAYED.
## "Quad" Investigators Find New Evidence Which Will Delay Publishing of Findings. 
### 
The investigating committee ap
pointed to look into the accounts of
"Quad" Manager J. F. Brennan, '07,
will not report this week as was ex
pected. The committee has found
new evidence which will require some
time to work up. What the nature
of the evidence is the committee re
fuses to divulge. In the words of
one of the members of the commit
tee, "We thought we were standing
on both feet, but since new develop
ments have come to light, we find we
have only one leg to stand on." It
is probable that no report will be
made to the Senior class until after
Easter, when the entire proceedings
are expected to be made public.
