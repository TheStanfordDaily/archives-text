# MEET WILL BE CLOSE
## CLEVER PERFORMERS FOR ALL EVENTS. With Munn Entered Oakland High Stands Good Chance of Winning Another Victory. 
### 
It is very difficult to select either
individual or school winners in a meet, j
which has an entry list of over two
hundred men, representing thirty-one
schools. As was the case last yeas
the winning score cannot much ex
ceed twenty points. Among the en
tries are a great number of men un
known to California athletic circles, I

whose performances may change the
entire complexion of the meet, throw
ing the first honors to some quarter
not considered by the forecasters.
Oakland sends a one-man team, prac
tically the same as took home the tro
phy last year, but whose score de
pends almost entirely upon the form
of their great star, Munn. In form
Mlinn will sweep the field events
again, take for himself the Encitia cup,
and win the meet for Oakland, but if
he has an off day Oakland will score
few points. Harvard's chances seem
to depend upon the work of Kenyon
Lee in the quarter and half-mile, and
the performance of Cline in the
sprints. Los Angeles Polytechnic
sends a well balanced team which
may make enough points to take
home a trophy.
Mile "Run Has Many Entries.
Thirty-two men will he sent away
in the mile run, the first event of the
afternoon. With such a large field i f
is very difficult to predict with any

degree of certainty the winning con
testant, but unless badly boxed at the
start Hanford of Berkeley High,
Hartwell of Oakland, and Squire of
Belmont, may be expected to make
a strong fight for first place. Har
vard has entered Craig and Valleley,
but practically nothing is known of
their ability in the distance event.
Golcher Good In Hundred.
The hundred has an entry list of
nearly fifty runners. Unless the un
known men from the North upset
calculations Golcher , the speedy
sprinter from Lick will first cross the
line. Golcher is credited with a re
cord of 10 and 1-5 seconds, and if he
can make that time tomorrow its
'pretty safe to say that he will take
the first medal. The Lick man is
said to be a very unsteady runner,
however, and if the track is heavy or
soft he may not place. There are a
host of fast men from the South and
about the Bay who will give Golcher
a close run. Cline of Harvard, Gray
of Santa Rosa, Kerr of San Jose,
Read of Lowell, and McHenry of
Belmont, have all shown form and
any of them may find speed enough
to take the classic event. Gish of Se
attle, is the Northern entry and a re
cord holder in the Northwest.
Two-Twenty is Uncertain.
On Stanford's new straightaway the
220-yard dash will be a grand event.
Golcher will hardly have the finish
ing power to take this race from
either Cline of Harvard, or Macaulay
of Alameda, while Wallach of Ukiah,
and Loeb of Oakland, are each fast
men and will push the winner all the

way to the tape.
Macaulay Should Win the Quarter..
Macaulay of Alameda and Kenyon
Lee of Harvard should furnish a great
race in the 440-yard dash. Lee is h
wonderful distance man, but from
Macaulay's performance here last Sat
urday it looks as if the Alameda run
ner will take the Southerner's mea
sure. Crary of Harvard, Streeton of
Los Angeles Polytechnic, and Gish
of Seattle, are all possibilities.
Fast Performance in the Half.
Harvard's star, Kenyon Lee, will
win the half-mile. The Stanford
bleachers have seen this athlete run
the distance events, and the man who
takes the half away from him will
spring a big surprise. Thompson of
Lick, was unfortunately disqualified,
and this leaves Padilla of Lick, and
Thompson of Seattle about the only
men to be classed with the Southern
runner.
Hurdles Will Ee Pretty Races.
Raines comes from Santa Clara
with a very good record in the high
hurdles, but both Ruddick of Ukiah
and Robertson of Los Angeles Poly
technic arc capable of good perform
ances and should make a pretty rac?
with the Santa Claran. Hotaling of
Pasadena, Allsop of Lick, and Munn
of Oakland are all fast over the bigii
sticks, and it is very possible that they
may carry off the honors in this
event. In the low, Ruddick should
change places with Raines and tak
the live points. Lugo of Los Angeles
Polytechnic and Cline of Harvard
must be taken into consideration a
possible first place men.

Record May Go In The Relay.
Lick will defend her title to the
Bittner relay trophy with a fast and
clever team, but her runners must
be at their best if the handsome cup
is not to change hands. Seattle sends
down a relay team credited with hav
ing swept the Northwest with ease,
t'lid the Southerners place great hopes
in the speedy Harvard five. Certain
it is that the final race of the day is
to be a great struggle among twelve
fast teams.
Oakland Strong in Field.
On form Oakland High School
should sweep the field events, Munn
and Vail are two strong athletes who
have been consistent performers and
who should carry off the majority of
the points between them. The other
points in the field should be scattered
between Lick, Ukiah, Los Angeles,
Santa Rosa, Pasadena, and possibly
Seattle. Oakland's fight for the chal
lenge cup will be made in the field.
Mid she will place her faith in Munti,
her star performer, who carried off
j the honors last year. On his showing
i in the field will depend Munn's
chances of again winning the Encina
Club Cup.
Munn Should Win High.
Tn the high jump, Munn of Oakland,
should repeat his performance of last
year. The star athlete has been
jumping in fine form this season and
if pressed he should be able to do
5 feet to inches without much trou
ble. Hill of Belmont, who took third
place last year, is also entered, and
he should give the Oakland star a
good contest. Other men who may
figure in this event are Bressi of Low
ell. who has made a good showing in
the Academic Athletic League meet-,
and (-Totaling of Pasadena, who come
up from the South with a good re
cord. There are twenty-six entries
in this event and the result very
difficult to prophesy.
Good Performers in Broad.
With thirty-four entered in the
broad, this event should see somo
high-class jumping. Hupp of Lick,
will be a likely competitor in this
event. He won the broad jump in
the 1910 Bay Counties meet last Sat
urday and showed good form from
the takeoff on the new track. Munn

is also likely to figure in this event,
and Stock of Ukiah, Moore of Los
Angeles and Gish of Seattle are all
good for twenty feet or better.
Weights Should Go to Munn.
In both the weight -events, Munn
should again take the honors. The
Oakland athlete won the shot-put last
year with ease and lie should be ablo
to repeat the performance in that
event tomorrow. Cleland of Ukiah,
Bell of Lick, and Rheinschild of Los
Angeles Polytechnic are all good per
formers, who should give Munn a
close race. In the hammer throw,
Munn should stand the be>t chance
for first place. The Oakland man
threw second to Tomasini of Palo
Alto last year and with that athlete
out of the running, he should cap
turd this event. Cleland of Ukiah, is
credited with some good perform
ances with the twelve-pound hammer.
c.nd Walbridge of Los Angeles i- re
ported to be a strong man in this
event. Other good men are Bel! of
Lick, Wolley of Santa Rosa, and
Rheinschild of Los Angeles Polvtech
nic.
Record in Pole May Go.
With Vail of Oakland and hi- team
mate Munn in the pole vault, there is
a strong possibility that the Inter
scholastic record will be shattered to
morrow. Both men have been improv
ing steadily, and if the takeoff is in
good shape, they are liable to got
well above eleven feet. Vail ha- been
doing the better work of the two late
ly and on recent performances should
win tomorrow. The other entries in
this event are practically unknown
quantities, although Kline of W'ilmer
ding, and Mcllatton of Santa Rosa,
are credited with good performances.

urday and showed good form from
the takeoff on the new track. Munn

is also likely to figure in this event,
and Stock of Ukiah, Moore of Los
Angeles and Gish of Seattle are all
good for twenty feet or better.
Weights Should Go to Munn.
In both the weight -events, Munn
should again take the honors. The
Oakland athlete won the shot-put last
year with ease and lie should be ablo
to repeat the performance in that
event tomorrow. Cleland of Ukiah,
Bell of Lick, and Rheinschild of Los
Angeles Polytechnic are all good per
formers, who should give Munn a
close race. In the hammer throw,
Munn should stand the be>t chance
for first place. The Oakland man
threw second to Tomasini of Palo
Alto last year and with that athlete
out of the running, he should cap
turd this event. Cleland of Ukiah, is
credited with some good perform
ances with the twelve-pound hammer.
c.nd Walbridge of Los Angeles i- re
ported to be a strong man in this
event. Other good men are Bel! of
Lick, Wolley of Santa Rosa, and
Rheinschild of Los Angeles Polvtech
nic.
Record in Pole May Go.
With Vail of Oakland and hi- team
mate Munn in the pole vault, there is
a strong possibility that the Inter
scholastic record will be shattered to
morrow. Both men have been improv
ing steadily, and if the takeoff is in
good shape, they are liable to got
well above eleven feet. Vail ha- been
doing the better work of the two late
ly and on recent performances should
win tomorrow. The other entries in
this event are practically unknown
quantities, although Kline of W'ilmer
ding, and Mcllatton of Santa Rosa,
are credited with good performances.
It is very difficult to select either
individual or school winners in a meet, j
which has an entry list of over two
hundred men, representing thirty-one
schools. As was the case last yeas
the winning score cannot much ex
ceed twenty points. Among the en
tries are a great number of men un
known to California athletic circles, I

whose performances may change the
entire complexion of the meet, throw
ing the first honors to some quarter
not considered by the forecasters.
Oakland sends a one-man team, prac
tically the same as took home the tro
phy last year, but whose score de
pends almost entirely upon the form
of their great star, Munn. In form
Mlinn will sweep the field events
again, take for himself the Encitia cup,
and win the meet for Oakland, but if
he has an off day Oakland will score
few points. Harvard's chances seem
to depend upon the work of Kenyon
Lee in the quarter and half-mile, and
the performance of Cline in the
sprints. Los Angeles Polytechnic
sends a well balanced team which
may make enough points to take
home a trophy.
Mile "Run Has Many Entries.
Thirty-two men will he sent away
in the mile run, the first event of the
afternoon. With such a large field i f
is very difficult to predict with any

degree of certainty the winning con
testant, but unless badly boxed at the
start Hanford of Berkeley High,
Hartwell of Oakland, and Squire of
Belmont, may be expected to make
a strong fight for first place. Har
vard has entered Craig and Valleley,
but practically nothing is known of
their ability in the distance event.
Golcher Good In Hundred.
The hundred has an entry list of
nearly fifty runners. Unless the un
known men from the North upset
calculations Golcher , the speedy
sprinter from Lick will first cross the
line. Golcher is credited with a re
cord of 10 and 1-5 seconds, and if he
can make that time tomorrow its
'pretty safe to say that he will take
the first medal. The Lick man is
said to be a very unsteady runner,
however, and if the track is heavy or
soft he may not place. There are a
host of fast men from the South and
about the Bay who will give Golcher
a close run. Cline of Harvard, Gray
of Santa Rosa, Kerr of San Jose,
Read of Lowell, and McHenry of
Belmont, have all shown form and
any of them may find speed enough
to take the classic event. Gish of Se
attle, is the Northern entry and a re
cord holder in the Northwest.
Two-Twenty is Uncertain.
On Stanford's new straightaway the
220-yard dash will be a grand event.
Golcher will hardly have the finish
ing power to take this race from
either Cline of Harvard, or Macaulay
of Alameda, while Wallach of Ukiah,
and Loeb of Oakland, are each fast
men and will push the winner all the

way to the tape.
Macaulay Should Win the Quarter..
Macaulay of Alameda and Kenyon
Lee of Harvard should furnish a great
race in the 440-yard dash. Lee is h
wonderful distance man, but from
Macaulay's performance here last Sat
urday it looks as if the Alameda run
ner will take the Southerner's mea
sure. Crary of Harvard, Streeton of
Los Angeles Polytechnic, and Gish
of Seattle, are all possibilities.
Fast Performance in the Half.
Harvard's star, Kenyon Lee, will
win the half-mile. The Stanford
bleachers have seen this athlete run
the distance events, and the man who
takes the half away from him will
spring a big surprise. Thompson of
Lick, was unfortunately disqualified,
and this leaves Padilla of Lick, and
Thompson of Seattle about the only
men to be classed with the Southern
runner.
Hurdles Will Ee Pretty Races.
Raines comes from Santa Clara
with a very good record in the high
hurdles, but both Ruddick of Ukiah
and Robertson of Los Angeles Poly
technic arc capable of good perform
ances and should make a pretty rac?
with the Santa Claran. Hotaling of
Pasadena, Allsop of Lick, and Munn
of Oakland are all fast over the bigii
sticks, and it is very possible that they
may carry off the honors in this
event. In the low, Ruddick should
change places with Raines and tak
the live points. Lugo of Los Angeles
Polytechnic and Cline of Harvard
must be taken into consideration a
possible first place men.

Record May Go In The Relay.
Lick will defend her title to the
Bittner relay trophy with a fast and
clever team, but her runners must
be at their best if the handsome cup
is not to change hands. Seattle sends
down a relay team credited with hav
ing swept the Northwest with ease,
t'lid the Southerners place great hopes
in the speedy Harvard five. Certain
it is that the final race of the day is
to be a great struggle among twelve
fast teams.
Oakland Strong in Field.
On form Oakland High School
should sweep the field events, Munn
and Vail are two strong athletes who
have been consistent performers and
who should carry off the majority of
the points between them. The other
points in the field should be scattered
between Lick, Ukiah, Los Angeles,
Santa Rosa, Pasadena, and possibly
Seattle. Oakland's fight for the chal
lenge cup will be made in the field.
Mid she will place her faith in Munti,
her star performer, who carried off
j the honors last year. On his showing
i in the field will depend Munn's
chances of again winning the Encina
Club Cup.
Munn Should Win High.
Tn the high jump, Munn of Oakland,
should repeat his performance of last
year. The star athlete has been
jumping in fine form this season and
if pressed he should be able to do
5 feet to inches without much trou
ble. Hill of Belmont, who took third
place last year, is also entered, and
he should give the Oakland star a
good contest. Other men who may
figure in this event are Bressi of Low
ell. who has made a good showing in
the Academic Athletic League meet-,
and (-Totaling of Pasadena, who come
up from the South with a good re
cord. There are twenty-six entries
in this event and the result very
difficult to prophesy.
Good Performers in Broad.
With thirty-four entered in the
broad, this event should see somo
high-class jumping. Hupp of Lick,
will be a likely competitor in this
event. He won the broad jump in
the 1910 Bay Counties meet last Sat
urday and showed good form from
the takeoff on the new track. Munn

is also likely to figure in this event,
and Stock of Ukiah, Moore of Los

in the speedy Harvard five. Certain
it is that the final race of the day is
to be a great struggle among twelve
fast teams.
Oakland Strong in Field.
On form Oakland High School
should sweep the field events, Munn
and Vail are two strong athletes who
have been consistent performers and
who should carry off the majority of
the points between them. The other
points in the field should be scattered
between Lick, Ukiah, Los Angeles,
Santa Rosa, Pasadena, and possibly
Seattle. Oakland's fight for the chal
lenge cup will be made in the field.
Mid she will place her faith in Munti,
her star performer, who carried off
j the honors last year. On his showing
i in the field will depend Munn's
chances of again winning the Encina
Club Cup.
Munn Should Win High.
Tn the high jump, Munn of Oakland,
should repeat his performance of last
year. The star athlete has been
jumping in fine form this season and
if pressed he should be able to do
5 feet to inches without much trou
ble. Hill of Belmont, who took third
place last year, is also entered, and
he should give the Oakland star a
good contest. Other men who may
figure in this event are Bressi of Low
ell. who has made a good showing in
the Academic Athletic League meet-,
and (-Totaling of Pasadena, who come
up from the South with a good re
cord. There are twenty-six entries
in this event and the result very
difficult to prophesy.
Good Performers in Broad.
With thirty-four entered in the
broad, this event should see somo
high-class jumping. Hupp of Lick,
will be a likely competitor in this
event. He won the broad jump in
the 1910 Bay Counties meet last Sat
urday and showed good form from
the takeoff on the new track. Munn

is also likely to figure in this event,
and Stock of Ukiah, Moore of Los
Angeles and Gish of Seattle are all
good for twenty feet or better.
Weights Should Go to Munn.
In both the weight -events, Munn
should again take the honors. The
Oakland athlete won the shot-put last
year with ease and lie should be ablo
to repeat the performance in that
event tomorrow. Cleland of Ukiah,
Bell of Lick, and Rheinschild of Los
Angeles Polytechnic are all good per
formers, who should give Munn a
close race. In the hammer throw,
Munn should stand the be>t chance
for first place. The Oakland man
threw second to Tomasini of Palo
Alto last year and with that athlete
out of the running, he should cap
turd this event. Cleland of Ukiah, is
credited with some good perform
ances with the twelve-pound hammer.
c.nd Walbridge of Los Angeles i- re
ported to be a strong man in this
event. Other good men are Bel! of
Lick, Wolley of Santa Rosa, and
Rheinschild of Los Angeles Polvtech
nic.
Record in Pole May Go.
With Vail of Oakland and hi- team
mate Munn in the pole vault, there is
a strong possibility that the Inter
scholastic record will be shattered to
morrow. Both men have been improv
ing steadily, and if the takeoff is in
good shape, they are liable to got
well above eleven feet. Vail ha- been
doing the better work of the two late
ly and on recent performances should
win tomorrow. The other entries in
this event are practically unknown
quantities, although Kline of W'ilmer
ding, and Mcllatton of Santa Rosa,
are credited with good performances.
It is very difficult to select either
individual or school winners in a meet, j
which has an entry list of over two
hundred men, representing thirty-one
schools. As was the case last yeas
the winning score cannot much ex
ceed twenty points. Among the en
tries are a great number of men un
known to California athletic circles, I

whose performances may change the
entire complexion of the meet, throw
ing the first honors to some quarter
not considered by the forecasters.
Oakland sends a one-man team, prac
tically the same as took home the tro
phy last year, but whose score de
pends almost entirely upon the form
of their great star, Munn. In form
Mlinn will sweep the field events
again, take for himself the Encitia cup,
and win the meet for Oakland, but if
he has an off day Oakland will score
few points. Harvard's chances seem
to depend upon the work of Kenyon
Lee in the quarter and half-mile, and
the performance of Cline in the
sprints. Los Angeles Polytechnic
sends a well balanced team which
may make enough points to take
home a trophy.
Mile "Run Has Many Entries.
Thirty-two men will he sent away
in the mile run, the first event of the
afternoon. With such a large field i f
is very difficult to predict with any

degree of certainty the winning con
testant, but unless badly boxed at the
start Hanford of Berkeley High,
Hartwell of Oakland, and Squire of
Belmont, may be expected to make
a strong fight for first place. Har
vard has entered Craig and Valleley,
but practically nothing is known of
their ability in the distance event.
Golcher Good In Hundred.
The hundred has an entry list of
nearly fifty runners. Unless the un
known men from the North upset
calculations Golcher , the speedy
sprinter from Lick will first cross the
line. Golcher is credited with a re
cord of 10 and 1-5 seconds, and if he
can make that time tomorrow its
'pretty safe to say that he will take
the first medal. The Lick man is
said to be a very unsteady runner,
however, and if the track is heavy or
soft he may not place. There are a
host of fast men from the South and
about the Bay who will give Golcher
a close run. Cline of Harvard, Gray
of Santa Rosa, Kerr of San Jose,
Read of Lowell, and McHenry of
Belmont, have all shown form and
any of them may find speed enough
to take the classic event. Gish of Se
attle, is the Northern entry and a re
cord holder in the Northwest.
Two-Twenty is Uncertain.
On Stanford's new straightaway the
220-yard dash will be a grand event.
Golcher will hardly have the finish
ing power to take this race from
either Cline of Harvard, or Macaulay
of Alameda, while Wallach of Ukiah,
and Loeb of Oakland, are each fast
men and will push the winner all the

way to the tape.
Macaulay Should Win the Quarter..
Macaulay of Alameda and Kenyon
Lee of Harvard should furnish a great
race in the 440-yard dash. Lee is h
wonderful distance man, but from
Macaulay's performance here last Sat
urday it looks as if the Alameda run
ner will take the Southerner's mea
sure. Crary of Harvard, Streeton of
Los Angeles Polytechnic, and Gish
of Seattle, are all possibilities.
Fast Performance in the Half.
Harvard's star, Kenyon Lee, will
win the half-mile. The Stanford
bleachers have seen this athlete run
the distance events, and the man who
takes the half away from him will
spring a big surprise. Thompson of
Lick, was unfortunately disqualified,
and this leaves Padilla of Lick, and
Thompson of Seattle about the only
men to be classed with the Southern
runner.
Hurdles Will Ee Pretty Races.
Raines comes from Santa Clara
with a very good record in the high
hurdles, but both Ruddick of Ukiah
and Robertson of Los Angeles Poly
technic arc capable of good perform
ances and should make a pretty rac?
with the Santa Claran. Hotaling of
Pasadena, Allsop of Lick, and Munn
of Oakland are all fast over the bigii
sticks, and it is very possible that they
may carry off the honors in this
event. In the low, Ruddick should
change places with Raines and tak
the live points. Lugo of Los Angeles
Polytechnic and Cline of Harvard
must be taken into consideration a
possible first place men.

Record May Go In The Relay.
Lick will defend her title to the
Bittner relay trophy with a fast and
clever team, but her runners must
be at their best if the handsome cup
is not to change hands. Seattle sends
down a relay team credited with hav
ing swept the Northwest with ease,
t'lid the Southerners place great hopes
in the speedy Harvard five. Certain
it is that the final race of the day is
to be a great struggle among twelve
fast teams.
