# FOR NEW PROFESSORS
## PRESIDENT JORDAN LEAVES FOR EAST SOON. Will Endeavor to Secure Two Men to Fill Vacancies in the Law Department. 
### 
President Jordan will leave for the
East either 011 Monday or Tuesday
of next week. He goes primarily to
fill the two vacant law professorship*
in the Law department. While away
he will attend the meeting of the
Carnegie Simplified Spelling Board
in New York 011 April 3, and also the
meeting of the commission to con
sider the organization of agricultural
research in the colleges and experi
ment stations of the United States.
The latter meeting will be held in
Washington, D. C., on April 5. Pro
fessor George Hempl, of the German
department, also intends to be present
at the gathering of the Simplified
Spelling Board, of which he is a mem
ber.
Concerning the filling of the Law
professorships, Dr. Jordan said: "1
have some excellent men in mind, but
as I do hot know whether 01* not 1
will be able to procure them, I can
not give their names to the public."
The President will return as soon as
possible. He hopes to be able to
obtain the new members of the Law
faculty without going further than
Chicago and New York. If this can
be done, Dr. Jordan will probably re
turn to the campus before the middle
of next month.
The procuring of the new profess
ors was almost entirely in the hands
of Dr. Abbott, and his resignation
threw the whole task on the Presi
dent's shoulders. As there are many
details to be attended to in connec
tion with the matter, it is doubtful
if Jordan will make the trip as quickly
as he hopes.
Just what will be the action of the
Simplified Spelling Board at its com
ing meeting is not known. But its
importance is signified by the fact
that Professor Hempl will make the
long journey for the sole purpose of
being present at the meeting.
Dr. Jordan's recent appointment as
chairman of the Agricultural Re
search Commission was accepted by
him 011 the condition that the Com
mission would meet at such a time
as to allow him to also attend the
convention of the Spelling Board 011
the same trip. The members of the
Commission, besides Jordan, are Pres
ident Wright, of Clark University,
Prof. Jordan, of the New York Ex
periment Station at Geneva, Prof.
Armsby, of Pennsylvania State Col
lege, and G. Pinchot, chief of the
Forestry Bureau. The avowed pur
pose of the body is to "consider the
organization and policy oÂ£ Agricul
tural Research in the colleges and
experiment stations of the United
States."
