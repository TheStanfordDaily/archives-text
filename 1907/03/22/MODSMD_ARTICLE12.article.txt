# Juniors Make Good Sum.
## 
### 
As far as those in charge can tell
at this time, the Junior Opera will
net the 1908 class about one hund
red and fifty dollars. Something o/er
nine hundred dollars worth of tick
ets were sold, leaving only a few
seats in the balcony unsold. The cy
penses are estimated at nearly seven
hundred and fifty dollars thus leav
ing a little over one hundred and lif
ty dollars to be handed over to the
class treasurer.
