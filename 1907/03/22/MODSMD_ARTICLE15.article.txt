# SOLVES STRANGE MYSTERY.
## Assistant Registrar McDowell Elucidates the Causes of Harris' Reported Promotion. 
### 
From a graduate of the University
of California to the head of the Eng
lish department of Stanford is quite
a step, yet this seems to have
been accomplisched by Elmer B.
Harris, California, '01. In this
morning's issue of the San Fran
cisco "Call," a dispatch from
Milwaukee states that "Profes
sor E. B. Harris, head of the depart
ment of English literature at Leland
Stanford University, is filling minor
parts in Olga Nethersole's company,
while he prepares a new play based
on English life, to be brought our
next year."
For a time the mystery threatened
to baffle the wits of all but at last
one was found, who by his clever
logic and unfailing wisdom offered
a. thoroughly lucid explanation of the
entanglement. J. E. McDowell, '00,
assistant to the Registrar and well
known to everyone connected with
the University, was the perspicacious
individual who came to the rescue.
He summed up the situation in this
wise: "Evidently, the Eastern press
heard that Harris was a graduate of
a California university, and as Stan
ford is the only university in this
state, whicn is known throughout the
East, the journalists quickly surmised
that Harris graduated from here
Then, by a natural proccss of the im
agination he was appointed an in
structor in English and gradually he
woked his way up to the head of the
department."
