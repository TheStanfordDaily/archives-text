# INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET TOMORROW
## Preparatory School Athletes Will Compete On Track and Field. Heats Will Be Run In Morning. 
### 
Over two hundred athletes, wearing the colors of thirty-one preparatory
schools of the Pacific Coast, will co ntest for school and individual honors
on Stanford's magnificent new track tomorrow. The greatest of academic
track and field meets—the annual con test of the Stanford Interscholastic
Association—far excells this year any athletic event the lovers of sport
on this coast have ever seen. With an entry list of thirty-one teams, rep
resentative of a stretch of territory over eighteen hundred miles in length,
the school whose men take home the challenge cup tomorrow may well
claim the privilege of writing its na me high on the athletic records of
the West.

I
For the first time in the history
of coast athletics the far North will
[ meet Central and Southern California
i .
in one big meet, and fight out the
often-disputed question of territorial
supremacy. From all points between
Seattle and Los Angeles the flower
j of young athletes have journeyed to
Stanford to match their skill and en
durance. Northwestern record hold
ers are to be tried against the cham
pions of California.
The initial meet of the Association,
held last year, was credited with
breaking all records for interscholas
tic contests, but their second meet
takes a great stride in advance of its
predecessor. A broader representa
tion of territory, an entry list of
nearly forty more men and eight
more schools than competed last year,
in addition to the greatly increased
facilities for holding the meet, places
the second contest far ahead from
all points of view.
As was the case last year the large
number of contestants makes it nec
essary to continue the meet over the
whole day, the price of admission,
fifty cents, obtaining entrance to the
morning as well as the afternoon
games. Qualifying heats in the 220-
yard dash, the quarter-mile, the low
hurdles, and the field events will start
at 9:30 and continue until noon. Nine
beats will be run in the 220, the first
three in each race qualifying for the
semi-finals, which will be run in the
afternoon. The twenty-three entries
in the low hurdles will be divided
into three heats of six and one of five,
the first three men qualifying. The
quarter will be divided into three
races in the morning, the first four
men in each contest running the finals
in the afternoon. In the five field
events there will be elimination trial;
in the morning, the best seven men
in each event gaining the privilege
of competing for the medals in the
finals.
The meet proper begins at t 145
sharp. The events will be run off in
the Intercollegiate order, beginning
with the mile run. The heats, semi
finals, and finals in the hundred-yard
dash will nil be run in the afternoon.
There arc forty-eight entries in this
race, divided into six heats of seven
;md one of six men, the first three
qualifying. The twenty-one runners
in the semi-finals will be divided into
three more heats, the first two qual
ifying for the final race of six men.
The semi-finals of the 220-yard dash
will contain twenty-seven sprinters,
who will be divided into three heats
of seven and one of six, the four win
ners and the three fastest seconds to

run the finals. The morning com
petition will cut down the low hurd

afternoon, the iirst three in each heat
meeting in the last race. Four heats
in the high hurdles will cut down
the entries to twelve men in the semi
finals, where two more races will he
run. leaving six men in the final.
The winners of tlie half-mile, the
mile, and the relay, will he decided
hy one race, the width of the new
track making it possible to accom
modate these races in good style.

First placcs will count five points,
seconds three, and thirds one, in the
final score for the challenge cup. The
school whose team wins the relay
will not have the five points for that
race added to its score, the Associa
tion fearing to show favoritism to the
large teams by such action. To the
athletes who place, the Interschol
astic Association will give gold, silver,
and bronze medals, respectively.

been busy on the cinder path and
