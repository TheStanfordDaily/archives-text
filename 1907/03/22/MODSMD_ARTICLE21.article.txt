# OPERA IS A SUCCESS
## "LA SERENA" WELL PLAYED LAST NIGHT. Chorus Numbers are Great Success.— Miss Lyman and Kellogg do Clever Work. 
### 
It is the general verdict today that
"La Serena" was a more than usually
successful Junior production—the
plot, though strongly suggestive of
several well-known musical comedies,
being interesting, the principals clever
in their acting, and the choruses ex
ceptionally well drilled. It is to be
regretted that the music was not orig
inal, for the "Princess Enone," the
Junior opera of two years ago, proved
that Stanford could furnish successful
scores, l'or this reason, the audience
was scarcely satisfied to accept popu
lar songs with hardly a word changed
to adapt them to the needs of this
particular occasion.
As usual, the girls' chorus evoked
the heartiest applause of the evening;
and the combined choruses were very
effective. The costumes were attract
ive, the red, yellow and black forming
a brilliant contrast. The opening
chorus of Act I and "I'd L ; ke to be a
Soldier," the finale of Act 11, were
perhaps the most successful numbers
which the chorus gave.
Of the principals, R. S. Kellogg, '07,
as Falkland Corey, and Miss Georgina
Lyman, '07, as Dorothy Irwin, were
the favorites of the audience. The
part of Corey was played with much
humor and spontaneous action which
amused the audience whenever Kel
logg was 011 the stage. Miss Lyman
made a dainty and charming Dorothy,
and excelled her former successes in
class productions. Her solo, "Tell
Me Love's Story Again," and her duet
with Corey, "That is Love," were
among the best selections of the even
' iug. E. J. Swift, '08, as Burke Car
roll, kept the action moving vigor
ously. 11 is best song was "1 Like
Your Way," with Miss Lyman and
the chorus.
F. H. Bernard, as Juanita, the hu
man volcano, caused much laughter,
while the most appreciative response
of the evening greeted the clever top
ical verses sung by Bernard and Kel
logg as encores to their duet. As
Juan Cevera, captain of La Serena's
loyal legions, H. S. Ross, '08, was so
good that it made the audience regret
his not having a more important role.
The same was true of G. F. Zimmer,
'08, as the minister of war, and of F.
F. Munier, '10, who played the Hon.
L. P. Allerton with a finish seldom
seen in amateur acting.
Miss Mae Browne, '09, made a good
stage appearance, and should have
had more than the few lines given her
to say. H. C. Perry, '08, as Clue, the
detective, provoked much mirth by
his stealthy walk and deep-laid
schemes to circumvent Corey. The
other minor parts were acceptably
filled.
A feature of the occasion was the
Spanish dance which Miss Mercedes
de Luna, '07, had adapted, and which
she danced with much grace and pic
turesque effect.
The staging of "La Serena" was
one more achievement to the credit
of Sword and Sandals. The scenery
was pretty and suitable, and far better
than is generally used in college
plays; and the light effects were all
good.
