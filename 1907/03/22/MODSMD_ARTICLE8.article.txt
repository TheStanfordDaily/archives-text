The luterscin .lastic Association lias
determined to keep all the spectators
at tomorrow's meet, except the offi
cials, off the track. Last year the
runways and the finish were blocked
in almost every race by the specta
tors who crowded down on the track
from the â€¢ bleachers. To prevent a
repetition the Interscholastic has is
sued strict orders to the Marshal and
his assistants, to keep the spectators
off the track and field. It is to he
hoped that those who attend the meet
will heed this warning and keep the
track clear tomorrow.
