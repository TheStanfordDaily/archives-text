011 a track soaked with incessant 1
showers, Oakland High School again)
demonstrated her right to the Inter - j
scholastic Championship and the
Stanford University Cup. Munn, her
star performer, won for himself the
Encina Club Cup for the second time,
and practically placed his school in
first place in the meet. Hartwell of
Oakland also contributed largely to
her second victory by winning the
mile in which his team mate, Mills,
finished third. Los Angeles High
School demonstrated that she was
worthy to be ranked with the strong
est of the Northern institutions. Her
men showed up well in every event
in which they were entered and her
fast relay team captured the Bittner
Relay Trophy from Lick and Har
vard. The team from the latter school
again showed that they were a strong
and well balanced aggregation. Ken
yon Lee, their crack distance man,
took the half in fine style. Macaulay
of Alameda was another individual
star. The little sprinter won the quar
ter easily and followed this up
by breaking the tape first in the 220.
Hill of Belmont won the high jump
by a good margin. Nusbaumer of
Hoitt's was the surprise of the day
when he captured the hundred in a
brilliant finish. In spite of the in
clemency of the weather the track
was in fair condition but fast per
formances in any event were an im
possibility. About one thousand spec
tators viewed the meet. The con
duct of the contest was perfect. All
the heats were run off smoothly and
the events followed one another in
rapid succession. The mile run was
the first event and from then until
the conclusion of 'the pole vault, the
events followed each other without
interruption.
Hartwell Wins the Mile.
Sixteen men started in the mile,
which was run in a drizzling rain.
After a lap and a half,Hartwell of
Oakland, and Hanford of Berkeley,
fought their way through the field
and forged to the front. They raced
together into the finish stretch, where
Oakland's game miler managed to
pull away from his opponent and
breasted the tape first. Hanford ran
a gritty race but Hartwell's sprint
proved too much for him. Mills of
Oakland added another point for his
team by taking third place after .1
carefully run race. The time was
4 minutes 53 4-5 seconds.
Hill Takes the High Jump.
Hill of Belmont again demonstra
ted that he is a clever performer in
the high jump and surprised the
bleachers by taking Munn's measure.
Hill cleared the bar at 5 feet 7 inches
in fine form. The best that the Oak
land jumper could get was a tie with

\\ olfe of Vallejo at 5 feet 6 inches.
Robertson Wins High Hurdles.
After performing consistently in
the preliminary heats, Robertson of
Los Angeles Polytechnic, won the
high hurdles from Raines of Santa
Clara and Hotaling of Pasadena. In
spite of the soft track the winner
covered the distance in 17 2-5 seconds.
Robertson had beautiful form, cover
ing the ground between the hurdles
in tine style and taking each obstacle
smoothly. Raines ran a plucky race
but the Southerner was too strong for
him.
Macaulay Wins the Quarter.
Alameda's crack runner, Macauley,
did all that was expected of him in
the 440. On the first turn the little
sprinter broke through his field and
took the lead. After that he was
never headed although Goodwin of
Los Angeles High put up a game race
and pressed the Alamedan for a while.
In the stretch Macaulay opened up
and drew away from his opponent
with ease. Goodwin took second and
Streeton of Los Angeles Polytechnic
crossed the line third. The time,
54 4-5 seconds, stamps Macaulay as
one of the greatest quarter-milers on
the Coast, as the race was run after
one of the heaviest showers of the af
ternoon, and the track was covered
with little pools of water.
Munn Wins Shot Put.
As was expected, the shot put
went to Munn, who made 45 feet
10 1-2 inches. Cil.er of Santa Clara
carried off second honors with a put
of 43 feet 1-J inches, and Walbridge
ol" Los Angeles lligh took third place.
Walbridge did 41 feet 1 t inches.
Munn displayed his usual form in
this event and practically won ;is lie
pleased. The Santa Claran displayed
good form but lacked the strength of
the man from Oakland.
Nusbaumer Takes Hundred.
Xusbaumer. a dark horse from
I loin's School, captured the hundred
yard dash, after running clever race.-,
in the preliminaries and semi-final
events. Cline of Harvard took sec
ond, and Coover of Los Angeles
Polytechnic was third. The finish of
this race was very close and the men
were only inches apart at the tape.
The time was 10 4-5, which is very
creditable considering the condition
of the track and the cold wind which
was blowing at the time the race was
run. Golcher, the much-heralded
sprinter from Lick, did not enter in
the hundred.
Cline Wins Low Hurdles.
Cline of Harvard captured the low
hurdles in clever style, defeating
Fickert of Belmont, who took this
event last year. Bristol of Los Ang
eles High captured third place. The
time was 28 2-5 seconds. Cline showed

beautiful form all the way to the fin
ish, and outclassed Fickert although
the latter put up a game light.
Hupp Takes the Broad.
Hupp of Lick captured the broad in
rather easy fashion. The Tiger broad
jumper went 20 feet 8 inches from a
slippery takeoff. Bambaugh of Wil
merding took second place with a leap
of 20 feet t-2 inch, and Munn of Oak
'land was third with 19 feet 11 inches.
Hupp had been counted 011 to cap
ture this event for the yellow and
black and he did not disappoint his
supporters. Bambaugh made a good
showing but lacked form.
Lee Takes the Half Mile.
The 880-yard run was one of the
prettiest races of the day. Kenyon
Lee of Harvard demonstrated that he
could do as well at the middle dis
tance as he did last year in the mile.
He captured the race with Free of
Los Angeles High second and Koenig
of Santa Clara third. Lee covered the
distance in 2 minutes 6 1-5 seconds.
The Harvard man hung back in the
first lap, but in the second he passed
his opponents with ease and broke
the tape a good thirty yards ahead
of Free.
Macaulay Wins the Two-twenty.
Alameda's speedy sprinter took the
220-yard dash as easily as he captured
the quarter, lie took the lead from
Kerr of San Jose at the start and was
never headed to the tape. Kerr man
aged to take second place from Cole
man of Los Angeles High. The time
for the race was 25 seconds. Mac
au ley was hardly expected to win this
race and his speed in the shorter dis
tance was surprising. McHenry of
Belmont won a place in the finals but
was disqualified for cutting in.
Los Angeles High Wins Relay.
The Bittner trophy went to Los
Angeles High. Six teams were ".1
tered in the relay race—Los Angeles
High. Lick, Harvard, Lowell, Oak
land and Woodland. Lick took the
lead 011 the first relay, but the
Los \ngeles High runners cut down
the lead and went to the front in the
second. Harvard had a bad start but
made a game race arid ahi'Os: "-iic
( c*c!cd in taking second place from
the Tigers.
Tie in Hammer Throw.
Munn of Oakland and Wolley of
Santa Rosa tied for first honors in
the hammer throw on a throw of 133
ft., which is a good distance when the
