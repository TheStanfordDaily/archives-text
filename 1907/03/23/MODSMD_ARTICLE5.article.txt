The Student Body of Stanford Uni
versity congratulates both the victors
and the vanquished in this afternoon's
meet. The teams which won gained
their victories fairly and squarely and
deserve the trophies which these vic
tories will bring them. The teams
which lost fought like men, and lost
like gentlemen. To Oakland High
School, Harvard School, Los Angeles
High, and Munn, the individual cham
pion, Stanford gives her heartiest con
gratulations.
