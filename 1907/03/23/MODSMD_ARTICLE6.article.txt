At the Junior Prom, last night,
some small Japanese idols which dec
orated the joss house in one corner
of the Club room, were removed.
The Junior Prom. Committee had
borrowed these decorations and stood
personally responsible for their re
turn. They are valued by the owner
at twenty-five dollars and the Com
mittee must stand personally respon
sible if thej' are not returned. The
Committee knows that these idols
were taken by some one who was at
tending the Prom, as no outsiders
were admitted to that part of the
Club room. It is to be hoped that
the persons who were guilty of re
moving these articles will return
them to the Prom. Committee. It
is a poor return for the time and la
bor expended by the Committee to
place them in a position where they
are financially responsible for the

third; Hayes, Santa Clara, fourth,
loss of borrowed articles. If the
parties who took the idols did so by
way of a joke, they should return
them at once. If they took them in
tentionally, they are 110 better than
common sneak thieves and should be
hunted as such.
