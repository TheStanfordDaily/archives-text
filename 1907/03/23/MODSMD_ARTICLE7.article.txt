# STORM DELAYS TEAMS
## ATHLETES HAVE INTERESTING EXPERIENCES. Ukiah Men Walk Fifteen Miles To Make Train.â€”Seattle Stalled In Portland. 
### 
Some interesting experiences were
told by the men who were held by
the breaks in the railroads. The
Ukiah contingent led by 11. L. Ilor
ton, ex-'oB, the former varsity hurd
ler, walked fifteen miles from Hop
land to Cloverdale around the wash
outs in the tracks.
At Barstow, where the Los Angeles
and Harvard School athletes were
detained thirteen hours by a freight
wreck, impromptu training was insti
tuted on the county road nearby. The
young athletes donned their track
suits and sprinted along the muddy
stretches, much to the surprise of
their companions on the train and
the country people.
The Santa Maria High School
team, which arrived Friday, were cut
off by washouts and for fear of not
being able to arrive 011 time took the
stage over flooded roads into San
Luis Obispo, a distance of 16 miles,
where they reached the Southern Pa
cific tracks.
One of the most unfortunate fea
tures of the meet was the fact that
Seattle was stopped by broken tracks
and was not able to compete in the
meet. The Northwesterners wired
that they were stranded in Portland,
and that it would be impossible for
them to get through. Incidentally,
they challenged the winners of the
Bittner relay trophy to meet them in
a dual relay race on the track of the
Multonomah Club in Portland. They
name the twenty-seventh of March
as the date for the contest.
Los Angeles Polytechnic arrived 011
the Campus at three o'clock this
morning after a long and tiresome
trip from the South. A break in the
line to San Francisco at Baden tied
up the Southern Pacific trains this
morning and delayed many of the
officials who were due to participate
in the meet this afternoon.
