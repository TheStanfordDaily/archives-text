### 
A meeting of the Board of Gov
ernors of the Interscholastic Associa
tion and a representative from each
of the preparatory schools, that took
part in Saturday's meet, was held in
the reception room of Encina Hall
immediately after the presentation of
cups 011 Saturday evening. Numerous
changes were proposed by the repre
sentatives of the high schools. These
were thoroughly discussed and will
be acted upon at the next meeting
of the Board of Governors. Among
other things it was suggested that
hereafter the meet be held during the
first week in May instead of the last
week of March, owing to the uncer
tainty of the weather at the present
time of the year.
The question of whether a man
who has attended the preparatory de
partment of a college and later on
transferred to a high school, might
compete under the colors of the latter
was also brought to the attention of
the Board. That post graduates and
men who had competed at four Inter
scholastic meets should be barred
from entering future meets was the
opinion of many of the representa
tives of the secondary schools.
