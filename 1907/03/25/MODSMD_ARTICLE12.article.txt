# Successful "Jinks" in Encina.
## 
### 
Saturday evening a large number of
the visiting preparatory school ath
letes and college men assembled in
Encina Club room where they were
entertained with an informal "Jinks."
The Glee Club and the University
Orchestra each rendered several sel
ections which were well received. J.
R. Pemberton, '08, and R. B. Moran,
'07, sparred three rounds, refereed by
Douglass Erskine, the well-knowrt
sporting writer. A number of clever
songs by P. N. Hartzell, '07, and a
Japanese fencing bout between two
of the Japanese students completed
the program.
Following the "Jinks," Track-Cap
tain Macfarland presented the cups
to the captains of the track teams
which were successful in the meet.
