The Stanford chess interests should
adopt the California proposal to cut
down the membership of the Inter
collegiate chess teams from seven to
five. For the past three tournaments
the matches with California have re
sulted in tie scores â€”about as unsatis
factory a condition in Intercollegiate
contests as can be imagined. Califor
nia's proposed reform will not only
lessen the chances of a tie, but it will
practically insure the playing off of
the tournament in one night and will
prevent the numerous adjournments
which have heretofore marred the In
tercollegiate matches.
