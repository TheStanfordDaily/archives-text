The settlement of the track dispute
between Stanford and California,
while it has decided the place for
holding the meet this year, lias left
the principal cause of contention un
settled. Stanford's Executive Com
mittee, although it waived what it be
lieved to be the Cardinal's rights un
der the Intercollegiate Agreement,
distinctly stated that it considered ii >
interpretation of the Agreement to he
the only just and correct one. In so
doing it left the exnet meaning of the
words "alternate annually" as much
undecided as ever. Now it is con
ceivable that at some future date the
Intercollegiate meet -may again have
to be called off. Under such circum
stances a dispute similar to the one
which has just been settled would
probably arise. To prevent such a
condition of affairs the Intercollegiate
Athletic Committee should take up
this matter as soon as possible, and
either change the wording of the In
tercollegiate Agreement with regard
to the time and place of holding the
meet, or fix the interpretation of this

disputed clause so that there can be
110 possibility of future controversy.
