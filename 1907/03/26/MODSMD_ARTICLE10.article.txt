The reform started by the women
of the University in walking to the
Junior Prom, is worthy of being car
ried further. The movement was set
on foot to defeat the raise in price*
made by the Palo Alto busmen, and
it seems to have served that purpose.
The practice of walking to all Uni
versity functions on nights when the
weather is good should be continued,
not as an attack upon the busmen
but as a self-protective measure
against the growing tendency toward
extravagance. At California and at
many of the large Middle Western
universities the authorities have lim
ited the number of student body en
tertainments because of this same
tendency toward extravagance. As it
is now the cost of the Junior Prom,
and the Senior Ball is by no means
inconsiderable, and in past years the
tendency seems t<> have been toward
raising and not cutting down the ex
pense connected with these functions.
We have boasted the democracy of
life at Stanford so often and so
strongly, that this tendency to use
less extravagance should seem foolish
in itself. A carriage on a stormv
night is more or less of a neee.-sity
but the custom of hiring one to drive
some four blocks in ck-ar weather
is affectation, pure and simple.
