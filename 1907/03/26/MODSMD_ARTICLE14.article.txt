L. Newland, '08, is in receipt of a
letter from tlie chess committee of
the University of California, regard
ing the holding of the Intercollegi
ate chess tournament tliis ycar. Cal
ifornia asks that a meeting lie ar
ranged between the chess represent
atives of the two universities to de
cide 011 the time and place of holding
the tournament. Eligibility of con
testants and the number of players
011 each team will also be settled at
the same meeting.
In past years the chess matches
have been played in San Francisco
at the chess rooms in the Mechanics'
Institute. This building was de
stroyed in the lire of April 18, and it
will be necessary to lind another place
for holding the tournament. In all
probability the time for playing the
matches will be the same.
On March 2 California wrote down
asking that the number of men on
each team be changed from seven,
it is at present, to five, in order to
shorten the tournament and lessen
the chances of a tic. Xo match was
played last year 011 account of the
earthquake, but in the three preced
ing years the tournaments resulted in
ties. In all probability the Stanford
chess men will accede to the request
of the California committee and
change the number of men 011 the
team.
The tryouts for the selection of the
Stanford team are now in progress.
Under the system which has obtained
here in past years these tryouts are
exceedingly slow. The candidates for
positions on the team play a round
robin tournament, and the seven men
having the highest average in this
tournament are Stanford's represent
atives in the Intercollegiate event.
