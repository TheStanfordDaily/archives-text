## SOPHOMORES WILL ACT ON APRIL 5. Original Cast to Produce Shaw's "You Never Can Tell" at the Victory Theater. 
### 
1 he original cast of the Souhomorc
comedy will present George Bernard
Shaw's "You Never Can Tell" at the
Victory Theater in San Jose, on the
evening of Friday, April 5. The cast
held a meeting this afternoon to de
cide 011 the date and other matters
contained in contract blanks received
from I - .. Dimond, local manager for
R. G. Barton of the Barton circuit,
which owns the Victory. C. L. Rob
erts, '09, and P. R. Johnson, '09, left
the campus for San Jose this after
noon with the contract, with the ex
press purpose of seeing Manager
Barton or his agent and signing the
conditions under which the produc
tion will be given. Seats for the per
formance will sell as follows: box
seats, $2; orchestra, $1.50; first bal
cony. Si. 50 and $1; second balcony,
50 cents.
Speaking of the performance this
afternoon, C. L. Roberts, '09, said:
"What we want most of all is to have
it understood that the best possible
thing for the success of the show is to
have the full backing of the Univer
sity public here and in San Jose.''
By the terms of the contract, the cast,
which is designated as the "Stanford
Students Company," agrees to furnish
advertising matter, costumes, perish
able properties and the -pedal scen
ery used in the production 011 March
1 in Assembly Hall. The special
scenery to be taken is that used for
the second act of "You Never Can
Tell." Only the smallest properties
are included under the caption "per
ishable." It will be necessary to hire
the few costumes which were hired
for the University production. In ac
cordance with the. vote of the class,
the company will turn over the bal
ance of their receipts to the class
after expenses have been paid. From
estimates, it appears that these will
be in the neighborhood of $100. The
Victor}' Theater will hold, at the
rates set for the production, $1200
worth of seats. The arrangements
with the theater management give
one-half of the receipts to the com
pany, so all chances for a financial
success lie with the Sophomore cast.
Officials of the Southern Pacific
will be interviewed with a view to
getting a rate between San Jose and
the University 011 the night of the
performance. It is expected that .1
large number from the campus will
attend "You Never Can Tell" in San
Jose. As the first Intercollegiate
baseball game will be played in Berk
eley on the following day, negotia
tions will be made for a special train
to Berkeley after the performance, as
many will probably want to make the
trip to the State institution. The San
Jose production will be well adver
tised in San Jose, at the University,
at the University of California and
in the towns around the bay.
