# TRACK MEET IN SOUTH
## HOLMES WANTS CONTEST ON SATURDAY. Track Team May Leave Tomorrow to Meet University of Southern California. 
### 
There seems to be a strong prob
ability that tbe meet with the Univer
sity of Southern California, which
was once scheduled and later can
celled, will be held after all on next
Saturday, March 30. Late yesterday
afternoon Track-Captain Macfarland
received a telegram from Coach
Holmes of the Southern university,
asking that the Stanford team come
South and meet his university 011 the
Bovard track on next Saturday.
Holmes made a guarantee and asked
in his telegram that the relay count
ten points instead of the customary
live. Macfarland answered asking
that the relay lie counted as five, and
requiring further particulars regard
ing the guarantee. Holmes wants
Stanford to sign a contract that his
team will be brought North next year
and there may be some difficulty over
this point. Up to a late hour this
afternoon 110 word had been received
from Holmes and the meet was still
up in the air.
If a satisfactory reply is received
from Holmes this evening, the team
may leave tomorrow afternoon in or
der to make sure of reaching Los An
geles by Saturday. Fifteen men will
probably make the trip, accompanied
by Graduate-Manager Sales. If the
team leaves tomorrow the men who
make the trip will be picked by Cap
tain Macfarland and Trainer Moulton
tonight. None of the first year men
will lie taken on account of the Fresh
man Intercollegiate event which
comes on Saturday, and Trainer
Moulton will remain here for the
same reason.
If it should happen that Holmes'
reply is delayed, the team may wait
until Thursday before leaving for the
South and will take their chances on
getting through without delay. In
this latter case, the men who will go
South will be picked at a meet 011 the
new track tomorrow afternoon at
4:30. In any case the names of the
men who will compose the team will
be made known by tomorrow 11'ght.
On account of the first Intercollegi
ate baseball game, which will be
played at California, the interclass
track meet will be held on Friday,
April 5 instead of 011 Saturday the
6th as was lirst announced. It is also
probable that the Oregon meet will
be set forward one day, and will be
held fin May
