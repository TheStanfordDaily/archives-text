# DEBATERS ARE CHOSEN
## HERRON, McCOLLOCH AND FERRELL ON TEAM. Intercollegiate Trio Picked Last Night at Tryout in Chapel. Newland is Alternate. 
### 
W. F. Herron, '08, C. C. McColloch,
'08, G. D. Ferrell, '09, with L. New
land, '08, as alternate, will constitute
the Stanford debating team in the
Intercollegiate contest with Califor
nia next month.
This was the result of the tryout
held last evening in the Chapel, and
that there was a close contest for the
places on the team is evinced by the
fact that the judges spent thirty min
utes in deliberation before making
their final decision.
The general character of the work
last night was of a high order, and
though the selection made by the
judges was in concurrence with the
general opinion of the audience, F. A.
Fisher, '07, and J. W. Maloy, '07, both
made a strong bid for positions on
the team.
The debate was on the Intercollegi
ate question, "Resolved, That the Ef
forts of President Roosevelt to Ex
tend the Powers and Functions of
Federal Government Should not be
Approved by the American People."
An innovation in the method of try
out, largely due to the efforts of Pro
fessor C. A. Duniway, to improve the
conditions of debating, was intro
duced last night by which, in addition
to the regular ten-minute speech, each
contestant delivered a four-minute re
buttal. This tested the ability of the
speakers to do extemporaneous work
and brought out the fact that the
present team, is exceptionally strong
in that particular.
Herron's strong points are a force
ful, convincing delivery and the ability
to analyze the arguments of the op
posing side and focus his refutation
on those that are pertinent to the
question.
McColloch has an easy stage pres
ence and is a fluent speaker. His ar
guments are original, and his strength
lies in the ability to get down to real
concrete issues. In rebuttal he is
direct and vigorous and very analyti
cal in his argument.
Ferrell gives the impression of hav
ing thoroughly mastered his subject
and is especially strong in the logical
presentation of facts in direct debate.
Newland won his place by his com
prehensive analysis of the subject.
Herron is the winner of the Carnot
medal this year and was a member of
both the Carnot and Intercollegiate
teams last year. McColloch was al
termite on last year's Intercollegiate
and a member of the Carnot team
this year. Ferrell was on the win
ning Sophomore team this year.
Newland was on his class team in his
Sophomore year and also alternate
on his Freshman team. The team
was selected by Professors C. A. Dun â€¢
iway, of the History department, and
C. II. Huberich and W. N. Hohfeld.
of the department of Law. I. B.
Cross, of the Economics department,
presided.
