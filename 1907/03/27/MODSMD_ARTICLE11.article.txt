The President's Conference seems
to have died a natural death. One
meeting has been held this semester
and there seems to be no possibility
that another will be arranged before
the end of April. As far as actual
results go, the Conference which
started out so promisingly seems to
have accomplished nothing. For this
the student delegates are partly to
blame. At no meeting were affairs of
moment to the University discussed
as freely as they should have been.
The smaller matters of improvements
on and around the campus, which
were taken up, produced no visible
results and the committees appointed
by President Jordan neglected to do
their duty. As a result the members
of the Conference lost interest and
after the first meeting, its sessions
have accomplished absolutely nothing.
Under these circumstances, it is best
to let the body die rather than to
keep it alive, as a useless and power
less organization.
