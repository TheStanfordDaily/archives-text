# MAY ACT ON RESIGNATION.
## Executive Committee Will Discuss Coach Lanagan's Action at Regular Meeting Tonight. 
### 
The Executive Committee will in
all probability take some definite ac
tion tonight upon the resignation of
Coach Lanagan, which has been on
the table for some time. It is im
possible to learn today just what this
action will be, but it is understood
that the matter will be settled defin
itely tonight.
Funds to cover any deficit which
may have to be met for the Southern
trip of the track men, will probably be
voted tonight. The expenses of the
crew to Los Angeles and of the base
ball team to Reno are practically cov
ered by guarantees, but $350 may not
be sufficient to take fourteen track
men South.
No reply has been received from
California to the resolutions of the
Stanford Committee upon the track
dispute. So far as Stanford is con
cerned the matter has been settled.
