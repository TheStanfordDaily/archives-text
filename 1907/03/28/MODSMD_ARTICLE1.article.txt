# GOOD MEET IN SOUTH
## HIGH CLASS PERFORMANCES EXPECTED. Stanford's Picked Team Should Win. Parsons Will Run the Dashes for Southern California. 
### 
The team of fourteen picked track
men, accompanied by Manager Sales,
left for the South at 5:05 tonight.
The men went direct to San Fran
cisco, when they will take the Sun
set Limited, which leaves at 8. Ow
ing to breaks in the Coast Line all
trains are now running over the val
ley route and the team will go that
way, reaching Los Angeles about Fri
day noon. The men will go direct to
Bovard field, where they will do a
little light work to loosen their
muscles for the severe trial on Sat
urday.
Holmes' statements in the Southern
newspapers indicate that lie is con
fident of a victory, but the men who
will meet bis team are in splendid
condition, the trip should do them
very little harm, and if victory does
rest with Southern California it will
be by the closest of scores. Conced
ing Holmes about everything which
his team can win, the majority of
points should still come to Stanford.
To the peerless sprinter, Parsons, will
go both of the dashes without doubt,
but Holman, Vandervoort, and Mc-
Neil, arc just as certain of dividing
the second and third places between
them. Davis and Edwards should be
good for eight points in the quarter,
and Shelton and Severy should turn
the same trick in the half-mile. The
five points in the two-mile will come
to Nash, and eight in the mile should
be taken by Miller and Nash.
Holmes credits Comstock with run
ning under sixteen in the high hurd
les, and gives him first place over
Macfarland and Lanagan. If the
Southern hurdler does that time Sat
urday he will win, but both the Card
inal hurdlers are good for sixteen
flat by Moulton's watch, and Com
stock must do his 15 4-5 if he takes
first honors. In the low, Lennox,
says Holmes, will break the tape in
front of Macfarland, but those who
saw Stanford's captain run his racc
yesterday will be disposed to ques
tion that statement. Macfarland wi'l
take the low hurdles in 26 flat Satur
day, and Lennox must get under this
figure if be is to win.
The field events are more uncertain
than the results of the races. Rich
ardson of Southern California will
probably take the high jump from
Sterling, and he goes over eleven feet
consistently in the pole. Whether he
can win will depend upon what sort
of form Lanagan and Kocher show.
Both of these men have cleared
eleven feet, three inches, and this
event should be one of the best of
the day. Richardson throws the
hammer around 140 feet, and Craw
ford will have to be at his best to
bring home the five points. In the
shot the Stanford man should win by a
safe margin, with Richardson second.
The broad is another uncertain event
Vandervoort clears twenty-one a:
times, but is not consistent at that
figure, while both Chandler and Rich
ardson are dangerous. The reiay wii!
he a battle royal. With Davis, Mac

farland, Edwards, McNeil, and Hol
man, Stanford has a fast and clever
five. On the other hand Holmes' de
sire for a ten-point relay shows a
great deal of confidence in the last
race of the day. The Stanford men
will run in new suits Saturday. The
uniform consists of a white jersey
with a red stripe running from shoul
der to hip, and white running pants
with red belts and stripes.
