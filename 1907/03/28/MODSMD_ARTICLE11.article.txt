## PEABODY ADDRESSES STUDENT ASSEMBLY. Breaking Away from English University Ideals of Aristocracy.â€”Butler Fails to Arrive. 
### 
"A comparison of ideals 011 Univer
sity Life in America and in Ger
many," was the subject of an address
delivered in Assembly Hall this morn
ing by Francis G. Peabody, dean of
the divinity school of Harvard Uni
versity. Owing to the inability to
locate Nicholas Murray Butler, pres
ident of Columbia University, who
was thought to be in San Francisco,
there was only one address.
Dr. Peabody's speech was short,
lasting not more than fifteen min
utes, but was well received by the
audience. After giving an account of
the rapid development along com
mercial lines of cities in the German
Empire, likening the growth there to
that in the United States, he spoke
of the growth of American Univer
sity ideals.
"The universities of Germany, as in
this country, are the main check on
the spirit of commercialism and the
scramble for wealth that now mani
fests itself in the business world," he
said. "Our Eastern colleges nerpetu
ate the English university traditions
of culture. The English universities
are the centers of aristocracy. Super
imposed on the English ideal has
come the German ideal of freedom of
research and liberty. Our student
life has followed English traditions,
but there also lias come the German
ideal of liberty and learning. So we
now have the student life of England
and the German ideal of learning."
Dr. Peabody followed his compari
sons with the statement that we are
now breaking away from traditions
of the old world and are developing
along new lines. Combined with the
culture of England and the learning
of Germany there has come info
American universities tin: ideal of con
tributing to the common good. The
speaker closed his address with the
statement that education in modern
times must also "be toward effece
iveness in one's calling," and then to
finding a place in the world where
the knowledge gained during univer
sity life can be put to the best ad
vantage. "With such knowledge," l.e
said, "one can say, 'Here am I, send
me.' "
