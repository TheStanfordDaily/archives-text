# FINAL IN INTERCLASS
## SERIES WILL BEGIN TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Seniors and Juniors Clash in First Game.â€”Lower Classes Play Saturday Morning. 
### 
The first game in the final inter
class series will be played on the
Varsity diamond tomorrow afternoon
at 3:30, when the Juniors cross bats
with the 1907 nine. On Saturday
morning at 10, the first year men will
meet the Sophomores in the second
game of the series. The time and
place for the final game have not
yet been settled by Coach Lanagan
but it is probable that the final be
tween the winning teams will be
played after vacation.
It is impossible to announce the
teams which will meet tomorrow.
The batting of the men in the pre
liminary games has been so poor in
most cases that the task of picking
the teams is a difficult one. and Lan
agan will not be able to name them
until tomorrow. On form shown in
preliminary games the Seniors should
be able to defeat 1908 when they meet
tomorrow. Burtis and McClain have
both been doing fairly good work in
the box, while Menardi and Leach
have been h't hard. Moreover the
Seniors have a fast infield and should
be able to give their pitchers better
support than the third-vear men.
The Sophomore and the Fresh
man teams are evenly matched and
either one of them should give the
Seniors a fight, but on form 1907 look-,
to have a good chance of again carry
ing off the interclass championship.
The lineup for Saturday's game will
be announced tomorrow.
