# PRESLEY WILL BE FIELD COACH.
## This Year's Varsity Baseball Captain Will Coach Baseball and Football.â€”Lanagan May Return In Advisory Capacity. 
### 
George J. Presley, '07, of San Fran
cisco, will be head field coach in both
football and baseball next season,
and there is a strong possibility that
Head Coach Lanagan will return in
the capacity of advisory coach in both
these sports.
Such is the present status of the
negotiations carried 011 by the Stu
dent Executive Committee with Lan
agan since the coach's resignation
was received some weeks ago. It
was known then that Lanagan would
not return as active coach. The offer
of the position of advisory was then
made, with a field coach to take
charge of the active work of pre
paring the football and baseball
teams. Presley was suggested for
the position and it was offered to
him. lie has accepted and under
those conditions Lanagan has signi
fied bis probable intention of return
ing as advisor. No formal contracts
with Lanagan or Presley have yet
been signed and the question of sal
ary has not been definitely settled.
111 all probability there will be no
change in Lanagan's salary, and Pres
ley will receive somewhere in the
neighborhood of one thousand dollars
for his work during the two seasons.
The new field coach is a candidate
for graduation in the department of
Law, and he will probably take ad
vanced work in that department next

year. The contracts and the final de
cision of Coach Lanagan will prob
ably be announced immediately after
the close of the Easter vacation.
Presley's athletic record here has
been a brilliant one and he is em
inently qualified to take active charge
of the work of the football and base
ball squads. He made his Varsity
letter in baseball in bis Sophomore
year, playing first base. The follow
ing season he held down the same
position on the team which tied the
series with California, and was elected
captain for this year at the close of
the season. Last year Presley went
out for Rugby and won a position
on the Varsity fifteen, playing wing
forward. He played in the California
game and accompanied the team on
the trip to Vancouver. Presley has
a good knowledge of the Rugby
game, and his baseball record is well
known.
The new coach is prominently
identified with student activities. Lie
was president of 1907 in his Fresh
man year and has twice served on the
Executive Committee, of which he is
at present a member. He is captain of
this year's Varsity baseball team.
Presley is a member of Encina Club,
Quadrangle Club, Phi Delta Phi and
Skull and Snakes. He registers from
San Francisco in the department of
Law.
