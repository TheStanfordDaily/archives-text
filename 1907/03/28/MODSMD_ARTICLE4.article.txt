# ST. MARY'S FAILS TO COME.
## Phoenix Team Late Leaving Los Angeles.-Cancels Game Scheduled for This Afternoon. 
### 
The ball team from St. Mary's Col
lege failed to arrive this afternoon
as expected, and to the disappoint
ment of all no opportunity of seeing
the Varsity in action once more be
fore their trip to Reno was given.
The Phoenix nine was expected from
Los Angeles, where they have been
for some days past, 011 an early after
noon train, but Graduate-Manager
Sale's received word that the colle
gians did not leave the southern city
until this morning, thus making their
arrival on schedule time impossible.
An effort was made to reach Santa
Clara in time to bring them to the
campus but definite word from the
Phoenix team was received too late
to permit of other arrangements be
ing made. A practice game was sub
stituted between the Varsity and a
picked team.
The baseball squad of eleven play
ers with Coach Lanagan will leave
Palo Alto on the 6:36 train tomorrow
morning. Those who will go are
Stott, Daily, Goodell, Thcile, Presley,
Cadwalader, Sampson, Fenton, Owen,
Wirt, and Dudley. They will leave
San Francisco at 9 o'clock and are
scheduled to reach the Nevada cam
pus late tomorrow night. Since
Manager Sales will be in Los Angeles
with the track men, the management
of the trip will be in the hands of
Captain Presley.
