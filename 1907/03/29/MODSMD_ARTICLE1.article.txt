# FIRST GAME IN WEEK
## INTERCOLLEGIATE SERIES STARTS APRIL 6. Neither Team Has Been Finally Selected by Coaches.—Varsities are Evenly Matched. 
### 
The opening game of the Intercol
legiate baseball series will be played
on the University of California cam
pus the last Saturday of Easter vaca
tion week, April 6. The Varsity line
up may fairly be said to be even more
problematical than it was at the open
ing of the season. With the infield
positions determined, there remains
the selection of a battery and the fin
ish of a close race for the three gar
den positions among five men a'l
about evenly matched.
It might be said that the situation
in baseball at present is rather unsat
isfactory —a condition of affairs due
entirely to the continued spell of in
clement weather which for three
weeks interrupted effectually every
branch of athletics. Both teams will
come onto the field for the opening
game of the big series lacking a week
of practice at the vital part of the
season. A study of comparative
scores and the material composing
cach nine leads to the conclusion that
at present both Varsities are about
evenly matched and that victory will
rest next Saturday with the team
which draws the greatest advantage
Irom the week of prospective warm
weather between now and the call o 1
"Play."
At the present writing the batter}
which will wear the cardinal in the
opening match is far from settlen.
Since early in the season Daily has
been pushing Stott hard for the phuce
behind the bat which he has filled for
three seasons, and probably the show
ing each player makes in the games
scheduled for next week and at prac
tice will determine who will be at the
receiving end of the Varsity battery.
Just as evenly Theile and Goodeli
the leading candidates for the box
seem to be matched. Beginning the
season with a decided advantage
Theile has not done so well of late
while Goodeli has continued to im
prove.
Captain Presley at first base has
displayed the same consistent form
which has marked his work for two
seasons previous, and has further just
ified his right to lead the team b>
top notch work ai the bat. The prob
lem of filling Bell's place at second
base, which for a time presented so
many difficulties seems to have been
well settled with the shifting of Cad
walader to this position. Samps 01
will be at his old post in the short
held. Third base will be cared for a
for the past two seasons by Fenton
who has throughout the season played
u l> to his usual form.
Any attempt to pick the three play
er.- who will till the outfield in the
opening game, will probably go
wrong. It seems safe to say that
unless some unexpected form is shown
among the candidates for these places
that Owen and Scott will be in lef>
and right respectively. Wirt, Gore
and Dudley seem to be on even terms
in the race for the center field with
the honors at present in favor of Dud

ley, because of his better hitting and
previous experience.
Coach Bliss has apparently settled
upon his team at U. C. Jordan and
Schaeffer are settled for pitcher re
spectively with Ghirardelli running a
strong second for the box position.
Wulzen, first base; Reid, second; the
veteran Causlcy at short and I leister
at third. Miller, Myers, Butler and
Captain Sweesy are the available ma
terial for the outfield positions.
The Blue and Gold coach was
quoted in a recent interview as be
ing highly satisfied with the showing
made by his men. Bliss thinks well
of Ghirardelli as a twirler because of
his control and says lie will not make
the selection of pitcher until immedi
ately before the first game. In all
probability both will be given a
chance to win letters during the
series.
No umpire has yet been named for
the series. Several of the local squad
are desirous that the services of Doyle
be secured

prove.
Captain Presley at first base has
displayed the same consistent form
which has marked his work for two
seasons previous, and has further just
ified his right to lead the team b>
top notch work ai the bat. The prob
lem of filling Bell's place at second
base, which for a time presented so
many difficulties seems to have been
well settled with the shifting of Cad
walader to this position. Samps 01
will be at his old post in the short
held. Third base will be cared for a
for the past two seasons by Fenton
who has throughout the season played
u l> to his usual form.
Any attempt to pick the three play
er.- who will till the outfield in the
opening game, will probably go
wrong. It seems safe to say that
unless some unexpected form is shown
among the candidates for these places
that Owen and Scott will be in lef>
and right respectively. Wirt, Gore
and Dudley seem to be on even terms
in the race for the center field with
the honors at present in favor of Dud

ley, because of his better hitting and
previous experience.
Coach Bliss has apparently settled
upon his team at U. C. Jordan and
Schaeffer are settled for pitcher re
spectively with Ghirardelli running a
strong second for the box position.
Wulzen, first base; Reid, second; the
veteran Causlcy at short and I leister
at third. Miller, Myers, Butler and
Captain Sweesy are the available ma
terial for the outfield positions.
The Blue and Gold coach was
quoted in a recent interview as be
ing highly satisfied with the showing
made by his men. Bliss thinks well
of Ghirardelli as a twirler because of
his control and says lie will not make
the selection of pitcher until immedi
ately before the first game. In all
probability both will be given a
chance to win letters during the
series.
No umpire has yet been named for
the series. Several of the local squad
are desirous that the services of Doyle
be secured
