# STANFORD FRESHMEN MEET CALIFORNIA TOMORROW
## First Year Men Will Contest On Track. — Cardinal Has Fighting Chance of Victory.— Reed May Not Run. 
### 
First Freshman Meet.
California 731^
Stanford 48^2
Tomorrow will see the first Inter
collegiate track meet on Stanford's
new field. At 2:30 the Freshman mil
ers wearing the Cardinal and the Blue
and Gold will be sent away by Starter
James in the first race of the second
annual contest between the first-year
men. Stanford's chances have been
materially damaged by an accident to
the most promising of the Freshman
sprinters—Reed, who recently sus
tained a severe injury to his left foot.
Reed will not know until this even-'
ing whether it will be possible for
him to run or not, but even if he is
allowed to enter it is very doubtful
if he will be able to make any kind
of time. This practically leaves Stan
ford with but one man in the dashes—
Scott, who has had spikes on but once
or twice this season, and who can
hardly be expected to run Donnell a
close race.
California can hardly take the quar
ter, half, or mile, away from Stan
ford. Pemberton, although not run
ning in Varsity form, should take the
first and Maundrell the last two races.
Shelton, the Freshman two-miler, will
be unable to compete because of ill
ness and this will leave the Cardinal
with but one entry, Perry, who will
run against an unknown field. The
hurdles should give rise to the closest
iac«s of the day. Bradley in the high
and Helsley in the low, will be the
men 011 whom Stanford will depend
for points and they should both come
very near to winning their events.
Bradley took the high in the A. A. L.
meet last year, defeating Johns, who
will run for California tomorrow.
Johns is credited with r6 2-5 this sea
son however, and lie may have im-

proved enough to turn the tables onfornia.

the Stanford man.
It is in the field events that 1910
lacks material. With the exception
of Scott and Poor, Stanford has prac
tically no one to depend on in these
five events. Scott should win the
broad and has a good chance for the
pole vault; Poor may take second
place in the high jump. This means
but about thirteen points out of .1
possible forty-five, which will give the
visitors a lead hard to overcome on
the cinder path. The weights must
be conceded without question to Dig
nan and the other Blue and Gold en
tries. It is very doubtful if Stanford
will be able to take more than five
points in the broad although Upson
may .get out far enough to take third.
The pole presents the same difficulty.
Cook and Upson may take points as
well as Scott, but the chance is a long
one. The relay is always the most
doubtful of events. The makeup of
the Freshman teams will not be de
cided until the time comes for this
last event, and the outcome is as im
possible to predict as the personnel
of the fives.
