Fighting bravely in the face of over
whelming odds, Stanford's Freshman
track team went to defeat before the
Blue and Gold this afternoon. The fin
al score stood 67 1-2 to 54 I_2 - The
meet was full of surprises, most of
which were furnished by the Cardinal
first year men. Captain Maundrell ran
in his usual form and outclassed the
field in the mile and the 880. Scott
who was hardly counted on for a place
in the sprints, captured the 100 in 10 1-5
and the plucky Reed took second in the
220 and third in the 100 with a ban
daged foot. Helsley and Shelton, botfi
of whom rose from sick beds to com
pete, did splendid work. The former
captured second in the high hurdles,
and tied for first honors in the low with
Johns of California, besides running a
fine lap in the relay. The latter entered
the two mile and finished third in the
gruelling race, although he was weak
and sick.
In the field everything went to Cal
ifornia, and the Blue and Gold won its
victory there, making a clean sweep of
the weights and taking 8 1-2 points in
the high jump. Johns was California's
star, scoring 14 points. There were
several changes in the officials for the
meet.
Maundrell Wins the Mile.
Maundrell got a bad start in tin; mile
and hung back for two laps. He then
broke through and took the lead to
the finish, winning by a good thirty
yards. Wilson and Mitchell of Cali
fornia took second and third places re
spectively. Maundrell was the only
Stanford entry to finish. The time of
4:51 1-5 was excellent under the cir
cumstance?.
Scott Captures the Hundred.
Scott surprised all the Stanford sup
porters by winning a beautiful race in
the hundred. The best that had been
hoped for after Reed's injury was sec
ond place, but Scott ran magnificently
and captured the race in the magnifi
cent time of 10 1-5. Grundy, of Cali
fornia, was second, and Reed, in spite

of his injury, finished third. There
was some dispute as to the placing of
Reed and Grundy, but the judges fin
ally decided that the Blue and Gold run
ner finished second. Donnell, the much
advertised California sprinter, qualified
for the finals, but failed to take placc
in the fast final.
Johns Takes the High. Hurdles.
As was expected Johns, the Califor
nia hurdler, won all the way in the
high hurdles. Johns got away fast at
the start and ran a clever race. Hels
ley pushed the California man all the
way but lacked the form of his Blue
and Gold opponent. Bradley finished
a good third. Johns covered the dis
tance in 16 2-5.
Pemberton Wins Quarter.
The quarter was another surprise for
Stanford. Pemberton won his race all
the way. Cushman of California ran
second into the stretch, where he broke
and was passed by Zacharias of Stan
ford, who ran a splendid race. The time
was 54 3-5. Zacharias had not beer,
counted on to take second place and his
showing was remarkable.
Shelton Runs Gritty Two Mile.
Hobart of California took the two
mile in the slow time of 11 minutes
17 4-5 seconds. Stanford's entries and
the California winner were the only
men to finish in the race. Templeton
tan a plucky race for his first two mileo
and captured second place. Great credit
is due to Shelton who arose from a
sick bed to contest in the race and who
finished in third place. The gritty
youngster ran well in spite of his wea*
condition.
Helsley and Johns Run Tie,
The low hurdles was a beautiful racc
between Helsley and Johns of Califor
nia, the two fighting all the way and
crossing the line together. The Car
dinal entry ran a game race and showed
pretty form. Drew of Stanford finished
third. The time for the race was 26
flat. Helsley's showing in both the hur
dle events was remarkable as he has
been in the hospital most of this week.
Grundy Wins the 220 in Good Time
Reed's injury proved too much lor
him in the 220 and he lost to Grttrrly
after a plucky race. The event was
close, Reed finishing right hehi.nl ihe
California sprinter. The btst Donnell
could get in this race was third aid lie
was close pressed for this place by the
other Cardinal entries. The nine of
22 3-5 stamps this as one of the best
run races of the day. Stanford quali
fied four of the six men eligible lor
the finals in this raec.
Maundrell Takes the 880.
Maundrell duplicated his performance
in the mile by running the 880 in 2 min
utes, 3 4-5 seconds. He ran his usual
style of race opening up a big gap at
the start and finishing over fifty yards
ahead of Denton of California, who cap
tured second place. Macready ran Den
ton a close race and finished only a few
feet behind him for third place.
Stanford Wins Easy Relay.
The relay race was easy for Stanford.
The race was one mile with four man
teams. On the first lap Zacharias ran
about even with McConnell of Califor
nia. On the second Weaver -went out
to the lead, drawing away from Mc-
CTellan of California. TTelsley cinched
ilie race in the third, opening up a gap
ol almost thirty yards and running
away from Cushman, the California en
try. Solomon of California wa~ no
mnti h for Pemberton, wiio carried the
Cardinal in the last lap, and the Stan
ford man crossed the line an easy wi
ner.
California Wins the High Jump.
The high- jnm was practically a
clean sweep for the California entries.
Bull and Kant of the State University
tied for first at 5 feet 5 1-4 inches, and
the best Poor could get was a tie for
third place with Merrill of California.
The third placc distance was not mea
sured. The work in this event lacked
class, and none of the entries showed
anything like Varsity form.
Johns Takes the Broad Jump.
Johns of California carried off first
honors in the broad jump with a leap
of 21 feet, 3 inches. He was hard
pressed by Scott, who covered 21 feet
and 7-8 of an inch. Upson of Stanford
captured third place with a jump of a
little over 19 feet. The winner jumped
in good form and Scott also did good
work in this event.
Shot Put Goes to California.
California again demonstrated her su
periority in the weight events by clean
ing up all the points in the shot-put.
Gignon won with Freeman second and
Swim third. The winner's distance was
38 feet, 6 1-2 inches. The form shown
by the contestants in this event was su
perior to that displayed in the hammer
throw.
California Takes the Hammer Throw
Three of California's entries placed
in the hammer throw, Stanford failing
even to land third place. Swim, Free
man and Baker were the three repre
sentatives of the Blue and Gold. The
event was lacking in class, the winning
throw being only 106 feet 9 1-2 inches.
None of the Stanford men showed up

even to practice form, and the event
was an easy nine points for the State
University.
Tie for First in Pole Vault.
Scott of Stanford and Bull of
California tied for first honors in the
pole vault at 11 feet. Three California
men tied for third place at 10 feet, y
inches. Neither of the other Stanford
entries were able to clear the bar at
this height, and the Cardinal had to be
content with the four points won b\
Scott.
