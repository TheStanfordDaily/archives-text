Fighting bravely in the face of over
whelming odds, Stanford's Freshman
track team went to defeat before the
Blue and Gold this afternoon. The fin
al score stood 67 1-2 to 54 I_2 - The
meet was full of surprises, most of
which were furnished by the Cardinal
first year men. Captain Maundrell ran
in his usual form and outclassed the
field in the mile and the 880. Scott
who was hardly counted on for a place
in the sprints, captured the 100 in 10 1-5
and the plucky Reed took second in the
220 and third in the 100 with a ban
daged foot. Helsley and Shelton, botfi
of whom rose from sick beds to com
pete, did splendid work. The former
captured second in the high hurdles,
and tied for first honors in the low with
Johns of California, besides running a
fine lap in the relay. The latter entered
the two mile and finished third in the
gruelling race, although he was weak
and sick.
In the field everything went to Cal
ifornia, and the Blue and Gold won its
victory there, making a clean sweep of
the weights and taking 8 1-2 points in
the high jump. Johns was California's
star, scoring 14 points. There were
several changes in the officials for the
meet.
Maundrell Wins the Mile.
Maundrell got a bad start in tin; mile
and hung back for two laps. He then
broke through and took the lead to
the finish, winning by a good thirty
yards. Wilson and Mitchell of Cali
fornia took second and third places re
spectively. Maundrell was the only
Stanford entry to finish. The time of
4:51 1-5 was excellent under the cir
cumstance?.
Scott Captures the Hundred.
Scott surprised all the Stanford sup
porters by winning a beautiful race in
the hundred. The best that had been
hoped for after Reed's injury was sec
ond place, but Scott ran magnificently
and captured the race in the magnifi
cent time of 10 1-5. Grundy, of Cali
fornia, was second, and Reed, in spite

of his injury, finished third. There
was some dispute as to the placing of
Reed and Grundy, but the judges fin
ally decided that the Blue and Gold run
ner finished second. Donnell, the much
advertised California sprinter, qualified
for the finals, but failed to take placc
in the fast final.
Johns Takes the High. Hurdles.
As was expected Johns, the Califor
nia hurdler, won all the way in the
high hurdles. Johns got away fast at
the start and ran a clever race. Hels
ley pushed the California man all the
way but lacked the form of his Blue
and Gold opponent. Bradley finished
a good third. Johns covered the dis
tance in 16 2-5.
Pemberton Wins Quarter.
The quarter was another surprise for
Stanford. Pemberton won his race all
the way. Cushman of California ran
second into the stretch, where he broke
and was passed by Zacharias of Stan
ford, who ran a splendid race. The time
was 54 3-5. Zacharias had not beer,
counted on to take second place and his
showing was remarkable.
Shelton Runs Gritty Two Mile.
Hobart of California took the two
mile in the slow time of 11 minutes
17 4-5 seconds. Stanford's entries and
the California winner were the only
men to finish in the race. Templeton
tan a plucky race for his first two mileo
and captured second place. Great credit
is due to Shelton who arose from a
sick bed to contest in the race and who
finished in third place. The gritty
youngster ran well in spite of his wea*
condition.
Helsley and Johns Run Tie,
The low hurdles was a beautiful racc
between Helsley and Johns of Califor
nia, the two fighting all the way and
crossing the line together. The Car
dinal entry ran a game race and showed
pretty form. Drew of Stanford finished
third. The time for the race was 26
flat. Helsley's showing in both the hur
dle events was remarkable as he has
