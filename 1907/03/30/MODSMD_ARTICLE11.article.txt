# 1910 WINS GOOD GAME
## FIRST YEAR MEN DEFEAT THE SOPHOMORES. Final Score is 4 to 3.â€” Witmer and Little Pitch Good Game This Morning. 
### 
Contrary to all expectations the
Freshmen were victorious over the
Sophomores in the second game of the
interclass series by a score of 4 to 3.
This qualities the Freshmen to play
the Seniors in the final game for the
class championship. Although the
Freshmen had a lead from the open
ing of the first inning to the close of
the ninth, the game was hotly con
tested throughout. The pitching of Lit
tle and Witmer was about on a par.
The Sophomore twirler struck out
more men than the Freshman pitcher,
but was hammered for two more hits
The Freshmen showed better form
than they have at any time before, and
the Senior-Freshman game should be
hotly contested.
The summary follows:
R H E
Freshmen 4 7 2
Sophomores 3 5 5
The game broke up in the usual
fight for the possession of the ball in
the ninth. Smith, who was at the bat,
caught the ball and threw it into the
outfield, it was picked up by the Soph
omores, and relayed up past Madrono,
where it was lost. Later the ball was
recovered by the Freshmen and it is
now in their possession. The game was
followed by a rush on the Postoffice
steps in which about thirty of the un
derclassmen participated. Honors in
this rested with 1909 who succeeded
in driving the first year men from the
steps.
