# Trustees Transact Routine Business.
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees met in San
Francisco yesterday afternoon and trans

taken. A number of faculty promo

several professors. None of these ac
tions are official without the approval
of President Jordan, and they witf not
be made public until his return from
