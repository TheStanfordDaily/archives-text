The cardinal of Stanford flew tri
umphant over southern waters this af
ternoon. In a gruelling finish the Var
sity four-oared crew flashed across the
line ahead of the crack crew of the
San Diego Boat Club. The second
crew swept all before it in the junior
race and Coach Dan Murphy added a
fitting climax to the day of Stanford
victories by defeating all other entries
in the open single sculls.
In a brief dispatch sent by private
arrangement, the"Daily Palo Alto" re
ceived this information late this even
ing. No time was given in any of the

from the San Diego Boat Club lived
up to the reputation of being fast
oarsmen. It was generally known that
the Southerners had been preparing for
a year for a race against the Northern
varsities, and there were many familiar
with the work of the San Diegans who
did not hesitate to say that they would
prove too strong for Stanford.
The race was rowed before a great
crowd gathered at the course, Naples,
the pleasure resort near Los Angeles
From the crack of the gun the two
crews were bow and bow. Over the
mile and a half course of open water
the shells flew with the advantage nev
er decidedly in either's favor. Near
the finish Turner , who was "coxing,"
called upon his crew for their best ef
forts. The Varsity increased their
stroke and working together in beau
tiful style they Hashed between the
buoys clear of the opposing boat in d
magnificent burst of speed. Conant,
stroke; Gay, 3; Pcmberton, 2; Zim
merman, bow, and Turner, coxswain,
were in the Varsity boat.
Early in the Junior race the Stan
ford crew took the lead. They finished
well in the lead of the other boats.
Roberts, '10, steered the Junior boat,
which was composed of Schutts, stroke;
Huston, 3; Patrick, 2, and Cole, bow.
Dan Murphy had little difficulty in win
ning the single sculls.
