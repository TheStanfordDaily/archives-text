# Nevada Shut Out By Decisive Score
## 
### 
The Varsity baseball team over
whelmed the University of Nevada
balltossers at Reno this afternoon by
the score of eleven to nothing. A
dispatch from the Nevada metropolis
this afternoon in a few words told the
story of an easy victory for the Car
dinal. In all departments of the game
Stanford outplayed their opponents,
and after the fifth inning the contest
became a procession for Captain Pres
ley's men. At no time did the Ne
vadans near the plate and a single hit
was all they could get off Goodell,
who pitched the entire game. Westall,
in the box for Nevada, outshone his
teammates and in the language of the
message received, he was the "whole
team." For five innings he held the
Varsity safe, but after that they con
nected with his curves freely and with
the assistance of eight errors on the
part of the Sagebrushers, Stanford
piled up runs without difficulty.
During the entire contest the Var
sity team was on edge and snappy
work in the field, assisted Goodell in
scoring a shutout. But one error was
charged to the Cardinal fielders.
Stott caught the entire game.
The summary follows:
R. H. E.
Stanford ir 10 r
Nevada o I 8
Batteriesâ€”Goodell and Stott; West
