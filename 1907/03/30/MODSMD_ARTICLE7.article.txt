Stanford is proud of the Freshmen
who went down to glorious defeat on
the new track this afternoon. A gamer
team or one which battled more splen
didly against overwhelming odds would
be hard to name in the athletic history
of the Cardinal. Every man on the
Stanford team showed himself possessed
of the true, lighting spirit which stand
up and struggles on in the face of cer
tain defeat. The team as a whole and
individually deserve the praise of the
Student Body. If special honor should
go to anyone—and in the history of this
afternoon's meet it is hard to find any
who should be singled out among the
rest —it should be given to the three
members of the Stanford team who
rose from sick beds to compete for the
Cardinal on the track. The 1910 track
team will live in Stanford history, for
their splendid fight in the face of
a defeat which was due to no lack of
endeavor on their part.
