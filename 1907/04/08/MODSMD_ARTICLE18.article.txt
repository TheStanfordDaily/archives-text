# CREWS DO GOOD WORK
## STORY OF SOUTHERN REGATTA IN DETAIL. Varsity Won After Great Race.â€” Single Sculls are Easy for Coach Murphy. 
### 
The eleven members of the Boat
Club who journeyed South to repre
sent the Cardinal against the crack
crews of the San Diego Club, which
had completely outclassed everything
in that portion of the State, covered
themselves with glory. In every
event in which Stanford was repre
sented, the Cardinal was victorious.
The members of the crew have been
high in their praises of the manner
in which they were treated while
away. They were housed at Naples,
where the regatta was held, and were
thus afforded the opportunity of a
few days training over the course
where the races were rowed. At the
hotel they ware afforded a training
table and no pains were spared to
make their stay a pleasant one.
The boat in which they rowed was
one belonging to the San Diego Club
and unfortunately proved to be op
positely rigged from the Stanford
shell. This somewhat inconvenienced
the crews but they were able to train
in the boat sufficiently to largely over
come the difference.
The day of the regatta was an ideal
one and about one thousand people
saw the races. In the first event, the
Varsity four, both boats got beautiful
starts but San Diego, increasing their
stroke almost immediately, pulled into
the lead and led by about half a
length for half of the race, which was
rowed over a mile course. At about
half a mile from the finish the Stan
ford four increased its stroke and
slowly began to pull up, finally pass
ing the other boat and winning by
about three lengths in 5 ; 5~-
In the four-oared event, between
the Junior crews, the Cardinal led
from the start, having the race well
in hand throughout, and winning by
about six lengths in 5:58.
The single sculls race was in many
respects the best event of the day.
Coaches King of the Naples Club,
Courtney of the San Diego Club, and
Murphy of the Stanford Club, were
entered. Early in the race Courtney
dropped behind and the race was
fought out between Murphy and
King. The older man's steady long
stroke won th'e race for kim in easy
style. Owing to a defective watch
no tima was caught in tkis event.
The crews brought home two hand
some cups which will be placed upon
exhibition in the Registrar's office as
soon as they have been suitably en
graved.
