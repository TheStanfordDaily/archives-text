# CLASSES WILL MEET
## INTERCLASS CONTEST TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Juniors Have Best Chance for Victory.-Fast Time Looked for in Many Events. 
### 
The four classes of the University
will compete on the new track to
morrow afternoon at 3:30 in the an
nual interclass field day. The track
promises to be in good condition, so
that the meet will furnish the best
basis of estimating the merits of the
Varsity yet afforded by performances
on the new Stanford track.
The 100-yard dash is conceded by
the majority to J. R. Holman, '09.
L. S. Scott, '10, and T. Vandervoort,
'08, are the most likely candidates for
the other two places, which will be
contested by H. E. Reed, '10, and W.
T. McNeil, '07. Holman, Reed, and
McNeil are the strongest possibilities
in the 220.
L. M. Edwards, '07, P. M. Davis,
'08, and C. C. Coonan, '09, will make
the strongest bids for places in the
440-yard dash, in the order named. J.
O. Miller, '08, will probably not enter
this race, and hence is looked upon
to win both the half mile and the mile.
H. H. Maundrell, the Freshman cap
tain, seems to be the man to take sec
ond place in these events, and should
give Miller good races in both. In
the 880 W. C. Shelton, '08, and L,.
Severy, '08, will contest for the third
place. C. B. Bradford, '09, should
place in the mile.
E. J. Nash, 07, will have another
opportunity to clip the Stanford rec
ord in the two mile. E. A. McGreg
or, '08, should take second, and J. E.
Shelton, '10, or E. C. Templeton, '10,
will be the third man across the line.
Captain Macfarland, '07, will prob
ably take both hurdle events. W. D.
Peaslee, '09, and F. R. Lanagan, '08,
will probably take the other two
places in the high. B. Gregg, '09, U.
J. H els ley, 10, and P. F. Bradley, '10,
will be strong contestants in both
hurdle events, and will probably di
vide the remaining points.
In the high jump, E. C. Sterling,
'08, T. A. DuFlon, 'of, and H. V. Poor,
10, will probably carry away the
places. G. L. Aynesworth, 08, and
T. Vandervoort, '08, may take eight
points for the Juniors in the broad
jump. Scott should take third for the
Freshmen. 1909 will be the strong
est class in the weights. D. P. Craw
ford and W. K. Ford arc the two best
men in the s»hot, third place in which
will probably go to B. Ucher, '10.
W. W. Zacharias, 'to, and A. B. Cox,
07, will compete in both weights.
Crawford, Ford, and W. W. Edwards,
'07, will probably take the points in
the hammer. Lanagan and R. A.
Kocher, '08, are good for first and
second in the pole vault, in which
Scott or Cummins will probably take
third.
The relay will be close between 1907
and 1908, with a slight advantage in
favor of the Seniors, who have three
Varsity relay men among their num
ber.

The four classes of the University
will compete on the new track to
morrow afternoon at 3:30 in the an
nual interclass field day. The track
promises to be in good condition, so
that the meet will furnish the best
basis of estimating the merits of the
Varsity yet afforded by performances
on the new Stanford track.
The 100-yard dash is conceded by
the majority to J. R. Holman, '09.
L. S. Scott, '10, and T. Vandervoort,
'08, are the most likely candidates for
the other two places, which will be
contested by H. E. Reed, '10, and W.
T. McNeil, '07. Holman, Reed, and
McNeil are the strongest possibilities
in the 220.
L. M. Edwards, '07, P. M. Davis,
'08, and C. C. Coonan, '09, will make
the strongest bids for places in the
440-yard dash, in the order named. J.
O. Miller, '08, will probably not enter
this race, and hence is looked upon
to win both the half mile and the mile.
H. H. Maundrell, the Freshman cap
tain, seems to be the man to take sec
ond place in these events, and should
give Miller good races in both. In
the 880 W. C. Shelton, '08, and L,.
Severy, '08, will contest for the third
place. C. B. Bradford, '09, should
place in the mile.
E. J. Nash, 07, will have another
opportunity to clip the Stanford rec
ord in the two mile. E. A. McGreg
or, '08, should take second, and J. E.
Shelton, '10, or E. C. Templeton, '10,
will be the third man across the line.
Captain Macfarland, '07, will prob
ably take both hurdle events. W. D.
Peaslee, '09, and F. R. Lanagan, '08,
will probably take the other two
places in the high. B. Gregg, '09, U.
J. H els ley, 10, and P. F. Bradley, '10,
will be strong contestants in both
hurdle events, and will probably di
vide the remaining points.
In the high jump, E. C. Sterling,
'08, T. A. DuFlon, 'of, and H. V. Poor,
10, will probably carry away the
places. G. L. Aynesworth, 08, and
T. Vandervoort, '08, may take eight
points for the Juniors in the broad
jump. Scott should take third for the
Freshmen. 1909 will be the strong
est class in the weights. D. P. Craw
ford and W. K. Ford arc the two best
men in the s»hot, third place in which
will probably go to B. Ucher, '10.
W. W. Zacharias, 'to, and A. B. Cox,
07, will compete in both weights.
Crawford, Ford, and W. W. Edwards,
'07, will probably take the points in
the hammer. Lanagan and R. A.
Kocher, '08, are good for first and
second in the pole vault, in which
Scott or Cummins will probably take
third.
The relay will be close between 1907
and 1908, with a slight advantage in
favor of the Seniors, who have three
Varsity relay men among their num
ber.
