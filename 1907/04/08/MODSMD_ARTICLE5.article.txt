# GAME IS POSTPONED
## INTERCOLLEGIATE CONTEST NOT PLAYED. Condition of California Diamond Stops Game.â€”Will be Held on April 20. 
### 
The extremely slippery condition of
the California diamond, caused by the
moderate rainfall last Friday night,
resulted in the postponement of the
first Intercollegiate baseball game
which was scheduled for Saturday.
The condition of the field prevented
fast base running and made it im
possible for the fielders to cover any
amount of ground. So rather than
play a game in which luck would have
been the main element, the coaches
and captains decided on a' postpone
ment. The first game of the series
will be played on the Stanford campus
next Saturday afternoon, and the can
celled contest will be played off at
Berkeley on the morning of April 20,
the day of the Intercollegiate track
meet.
To avoid entirely disappointing the
three thousand people who had gath
ered to witness the Intercollegiate
game, an exhibition match was played
between two teams chosen from the
Varsity men of both colleges with
two alumni pitchers. Sales was in
the box for the nine captained by
Presley, while Goslinsky was on the
slab for Sweezy's team. The game
proved rather spiritless and uninter
esting. Onl}- seven innings were
played, Sweezy's aggregation winning
six to five. The Cardinal players hit
well, eleven of the fifteen singles be
ing credited to them.
The score:
Runs Hits Errors
Presley's team ....5 8 3
Sweezy's team ....6 7 1
Umpires: H. J. Edwards, '01; Wal
ter Christie, California.
The battery for the Stanford team
in the Intercollegiate contest was not
announced before the game and the
fight for these positions will probably
continue through the week.
