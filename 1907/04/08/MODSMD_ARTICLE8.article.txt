The condition of the California dia
mond undoubtedly justified the action
of the coaches and captains in calling
off the first Intercollegiate baseball
game last Saturday. The manner in
which that postponement was made
calls for the severest censure of the
management responsible. No deci
sion as to postponement was reached
until a few minutes before the time
for calling the game, although there
had been practically no rain all
morning and the diamond was in the
same condition at nine o'clock as it
was when the time came for the
game. Even after postponement had
been decided upon no announcement
was made to the crowd of spectators
of that fact and many people were
under the impression that the exhibi
tion game was really the Intercollegi
ate contest. A more lax and unbusi
nesslike method of running things
would be difficult to imagine, and the
responsible parties, whoever they may
be, will have no cause for complaint
if the attendance at the remaining
games of the series shows a marked
falling off.
