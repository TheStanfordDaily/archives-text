# WILL PLAY ST. MARY'S
## VARSITY MEETS COLLEGE TEAM TOMORROW. Game Will Give Good Line on Cardinal's Chances in Intercollegiate Series. 
### 
In the third game of the series the
Stanford Varsity will cross bats with
St. Mary's tomorrow afternoon at
3:30 on the Varsity diamond. Krause,
who has twice proved an enigma to
the Cardinal batters, will again be in
the box for the visitors. Stanford's
batting Saturday was very encourag
ing, and it is hoped that the Cardinal
will connect for more than the two or
three singles.
It now seems a certainty that Wirt
will fill center field in the Intercollegi
ate game Saturday. Although weak
at the bat, his wonderful fielding and
great knowledge of the fine points of
the game have won him a place on
the team. He will play tomorrow.
Theile, Goodell, and Witmer will all
pitch against St. Mary's, and Stott
and Daily will both catch.
The battery 011 Saturday is still 1
matter of conjecture. Lanagan had
made no announcement about this
previous to the cancellation of the
Intercollegiate match last week. Stotr
seems to have a slight lead over Daily
behind the bat, but the fight for slab
ster is too close to admit the forming
of an opinion. Both Goodell and
Theile are in fine shape and pitching
good ball. It is a toss up which one
will pitch Saturday.
Following is tomorrow's lineup:
Stanford—Stott and Daily, catch
ers; Theile, Goodell and Witmer,
pitchers; Presley, first base; Cadwal
ader, second base; Sampson, short
stop; Fcnton, third base; Owen, left
field; Wirt, center field; Scott, right
field.
St. Mary's—Burns, catcher; Krause,
P'tcher; Brady, first base; Feeney,
second base; Hamilton, third base;
Dugan, short stop; Hooper, left field;
Enright, center field; Thompson, right
field.
