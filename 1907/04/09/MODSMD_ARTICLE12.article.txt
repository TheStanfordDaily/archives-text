At the last meeting of the Exec
utive Committtee, a committee was
appointed to consider and frame
amendments to the Student Body
constitution. These amendments will
be submitted to the Executive Com
mittee for their approval this week
and will be printed in the"Daily Palo
Alto" as soon as they are approved
by that body. They will be passed
upon by the Student Body in the an
nual meeting next week. These
amendments should be studied by ev
i
ery member of the Student Body be- j
fore that meeting and everyone should j
form a definite opinion upon their j
value. The constitution is the basis j
upon which the organization of the j
Student Body is built and its amend- ;
ment is a matter which concerns every j
Stanford man and woman. In the j
past two years important amendments
have been submitted at the annual
meetings of the Student Body. At
the meeting in 1905 several important
amendments were lost because thr;
Student Body had absolutely no idea
of what they meant. Last September
many of the amendments were passed,
but the meeting at which this action
was taken was poorly attended and
there was a great deal of objection
to one of the most important of the
amendments 011 the part of the people
who had not attended the meeting
and who had failed to realize the
effect of the amendment until it had
passed and become a part of the con
stitution. Objections made in such
a manner should have little force, but
they arc apt nevertheless to create
hard feeling. This can be remedied
if every member of the Student Body

! will take enough interest in its gov
ernment to read whatever amend
merits may be proposed this year,
| form some opinion upon them, and
| vote for that opinion at the annual
j Student Body meeting.
