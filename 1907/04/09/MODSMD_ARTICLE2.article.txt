# Will Try to Lower Coast Record.
## 
### 
By special arrangement a match
half-mile will be run in the meet with
the Olympic Club next Saturday
morning, in which Glarner, wearing
the winged O will be pitted against
Miller and Maundrell and the remain
ing entries. There has been much
talk of late as to the comparative mer
its of these athletes and to settle the
question of their respective ability and
at the same time to furnish an excit
ing feature in the meet Saturday the
half-mile will be placed first on the
program so that the runners may
enter without any previous exertion.
Each of the men is in the best of
condition and it is . hoped that the
Coast record of i:56 3-5 will be re
duced when these three crack runners
meet.
