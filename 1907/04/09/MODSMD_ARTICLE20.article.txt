# CREWS WORK AT REDWOOD.
## Murphy is Busy Picking Freshman Four.â€”Eight is Now in Good Shape. 
### 
Fifteen men are daily training at
Redwood now and the work of pick
ing the Freshman four which is to
represent the Cardinal against the
Blue and Gold is in progress. Coach
Murphy has expressed himself as well
pleased with the prospects for a
strong crew from the first year class.
From the candidates who are eligible
to compete in this race he has said
that the crew will eventually weigh,
in condition, about 160 lbs. This
weight is about a medium one for a
four.
The Varsity candidates are daily
working out in the eight which was
in shape for them by the time they
returned from the Southern trip.
Murphy has stated that he was ex
tremely pleased with the boat and
with the condition in which it arrived
here. Of the boat itself he says:
"She is finely braced and just the
weight to carry the men as she
should. She is a fine stiff boat." In
reference to Varsity prospects the
Coach expressed himself as also well
satisfied. "Our Varsity eight will ap
proximate 170 lbs. as they sit in the
boat," he said.
In reference to the rumor regarding
the necessity for a four-oared race
between the Varsities this year in the
event of the late arrival of the Cali
fornia shells, which are coming by
rail, Murphy was apparently un
troubled and stated that the boating
men would not complain as long as
there was a race.
The Varsity and Freshman boating
men who row at Redwood will be put
011 the training table in that citj' to
night. Later a training table will be
established at the Inn.
