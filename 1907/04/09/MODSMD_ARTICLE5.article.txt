# Abe Will Make no Guarantee.

### 
Captain Presley has received an
other letter from Iso Abe, manager of
the Waseda University baseball team,
concerning the proposed summer trip
of the baseball team to Japan. Abe
makes no guarantee but states that
Waseda will give Stanford all the
gate receipts from the games played
outside of the necessary expenses of
the series. As baseball is very popu
lar in Japan, Abe believes that the
Varsity could make expenses on the
trip. He also suggests that Stanford
play a series with the Keo University,
which has a strong team.
In view of the fact that the Jap
anese manager will make no definite
financial proposition, it is as good as
settled that Stanford will not make
the trip.
