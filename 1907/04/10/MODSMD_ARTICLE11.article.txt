# EASY FOR COLLEGIANS
## ST. MARY'S WINS SLOW GAME, 8 TO 2. Three Pitchers Tried Out by Cardinal. Theile Makes Best Showing in Box. 
### 
In the last of the games preliminary
to the big series, the Varsity lost to
St. Mary's College this afternoon by
a score of 8 to 2. A complete de
moralization of the infield in several
innings and hard hitting by the fast
collegians tells the story of the Car
dinal's defeat.
Despite the fact that they got by
far the short end of the match the
Varsity players showed up strong at
the bat, finding the hitherto unsolv
able Krause in almost every inning.
Theile, Goodell and Witmer took
turns in the box. The former made
the best showing. Stott caught the
entire game.
The summary:
R. H. E.
Varsity 2 8 5
St. Mary's 8 6 2
