The whole controversy between the
Faculty Athletic Committee of Stan
ford and California seems to have
grown out of a misunderstanding as
to certain recommendations made by
the joint conference which adopted
Rugby football. As far as the contro
versy itself goes, the-Student Body
here has nothing to do with it. The
recommendations over which the
trouble has arisen were made at
faculty conference, by faculty mem
bers, and certainly it is not the part of
the Student Body to sit in judgment
on the dispute which has arisen. It
would be well if those critics who arc
continually pointing to Stanford's
unsportsmanlike action in contesting
with four classes against three, would
bear this point in mind. The inter
view with Dr. Angell printed in an
other column presents another view
of the case, which goes to show that
the so-called unfairness of the prcsen'
arrangement, does not work such an
injustice as was at first supposed.
