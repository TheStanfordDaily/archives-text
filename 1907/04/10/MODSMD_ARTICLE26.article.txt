# CALIFORNIA'S BOATS HERE.
## Long Expected Shells Arrive at Berkeley and Eight-Oared Race is Assured. 
### 
The long expected eights, which
the California Boat Club purchased
several months ago in the East, have
arrived. This should put the possibil
ity of the Varsity race this year being
an eight-oared event beyond a doubt.
Stanford has been in her eight for
only a few days and the two clubs
start practically even in this respect.
Owing to the extremely low tides
the men will be unable to train at
Redwood for a few days. This will
keep them out of the eight for that
time. The flume which the members
of the club repaired at the beginning
of the year was badly damaged in the
recent storms and it will take some
hard work to put it in shape again.
At present no water is flowing
through it and the lake itself is low.
The squad will probably do light werk
there for the rest of the week.
Coach Garnett and Captain McKilli
gan of California were on the campus
recently and had the opportunity of
seeing the Stanford crews in action.
