# "QUAD" COPY CLOSED
## 1908 BOOK NOW IN PRINTER'S HANDS. Will Contain Over Four Hundred Pages.â€”Many Interesting Special Articles Will Appear. 
### 
Copy on the 1908 "Quad'' was closed
this afternoon and within three weeks
at the most the editors hope to have
the year book on sale. The volume
will consist of something over 400
pages, the largest "Quad" yet pro
duced, and owing to the fact that it
covers practically two years in a pic
torial way it will probably have more
half tones and art work than any pre
ceding annual.
The features of the literary de
partment are a series of special art
icles by I. Russell, '04, and M. Oppen
heim, '05, former editors of the "Chap
arral," and Professor H. W. Suzzallo,
'99. Russell reconstructed for the '08
book an interesting article which had
been prepared for Bickel's book on
"Quads and Quad Making." Oppen
heim's contribution is entitled "The
Omnipotence of Chappie," and is ill
ustrated with the characteristic draw
ings which attracted considerable at
tention in the comic paper while under
his editorship. Professor Suzzallo
has an extremely able effort on "The
Welding of the Stanford Spirit," in
which he dwells eloquently on the
"Pioneer Days" and comments inter
estingly on present day relations be
tween faculty and student body.
Coach Lanagan is the author of an
article which is given a prominent
place in the book on college athletics.
He talks from the coach's standpoint
on the problem of conducting ath
letics so that the benefits may be
more widely distributed.
The dramatic review of the year i
done by Miss A. W. Kimball, '04, in a
unique manner. Miss Kimball's art
icle is by acts and scenes in the form
of the summary of a play.
Under the direction of D. H. Ferry,
'08, one of the best collections of art
work ever gathered in a Stanford
publication is distributed throughout
the "Quad." All the prominent ait
contributors in college have done
much work for the book and all the
departments are cleverly illustrated.
More space is devoted to athletics
and joshes than ever before. Approx
imately fifty pages are given over to
group and action pictures of all
branches of sports interspersed with
the reviews of the year's work in ath
letics. The Josh department also cov
ers about forty pages.
The book will probably be off the
press the first week of May.
