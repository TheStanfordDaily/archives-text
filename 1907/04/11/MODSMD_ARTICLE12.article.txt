The principal amendment to the
Student Body constitution which was
proposed by the Executive Commit
tee last night, provides for the rais
ing of the Student Body assessment
from one dollar a semester to two
dollars for the first semester and one
dollar for the second semester. The
proposed raise has become practically
a necessity and it should be adopted
by the Student Body. A raise of one
dollar for the year is certainly far
from excessive and there can be no
doubt but that it is needed. The con
struction of the new track and the
widening of the football field coupled
with the engagement of an additional
coach and the retention of Trainer
Moulton at an increased salary, are
all heavy expenses and the extra one
thousand dollars secured by the pro
posed assessment will help pay for
them and keep the Student Body out
of debt. In addition to this, the raise
in the assessment would make Stan
ford athletics more independent of
gate receipts, and this in itself is a
very desirable reform.
