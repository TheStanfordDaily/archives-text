# TRAINER MOULTON IS RETAINED.
## Executive Committee Authorizes Making of a Four-Year Contract at Salary of $1800 a Year. 
### 
Stanford athletic teams will be con
ditioned for the next four years by
"Dad" Moulton. The Executive Com
mittee's offer of a salary of $1800 a
year for four years, authorized at the
meeting last night, will be accepted
by the veteran Cardinal trainer as
soon as Sales has the formal contract
drawn up and presents it for his sig
nature.

"My place is at Stanford," said
Moulton today, "and although I could
go to the University of Minnesota
upon very advantageous terms I wish
to stay here. I like the spirit of the
men at Stanford; I have never seen
such clean athletes and good fellows
at any college, and I made up my
mind to stay here long ago, provided,
of course, that the boys wished to
retain me. I am very grateful to the
Stanford students for raising my sal

ary, and Stanford teams will get the
best 1 can give them as long as 1
am here."
Trainer "Dad" Moulton has an en
viable record as a trainer and condi
tioner of athletes. He has been at
Stanford seven years and under his
care Cardinal teams have always met
California ready for the hardest kind
of a struggle. He came to Stanford
from Notre Dame, which was the last
of a number of Middle West colleges
to employ Moulton as a trainer. In
his younger days Stanford's trainer
was a professional sprinter of note,
and his first efforts in the training
line were directed to preparing pro
fessionals for the cinder path. Later
he took charge of pugilists and bicycle
riders. For over ten years before he
came to Stanford Moulton had charge
of athletic teams at many different
Western universities, including Michi
gan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, lowa,
Vanderbilt, and Notre Dame.
Crum, the great sprinter, Kranzlein,
holder of the world's record in the
hurdles, Dole, the ex-champion pole
vaulter, and Hyde, the shot-putter,
were all developed under Moulton.
At Stanford, Moulton's training
opened a new era of athletics, and as
the fruits of his work came the two
Cardinal victories on track, the first in
the history of Intercollegiate rela
tions.
The new contract, which provides
for a salary of $1800 a year for four
years, a raise of $300 over the salary
Moulton is receiving now, will be
drawn up and signed by Moulton and
Sales within the next few days.
