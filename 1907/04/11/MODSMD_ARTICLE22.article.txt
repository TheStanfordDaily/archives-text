## POLITICAL WRITER TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY. Student Body Gathering on Monday Next.â€”President Jordan Will Speak on Eastern Trip. 
### 
The last Assembly at which Presi
dent Jordan will preside this semester
will be held Monday morning. Presi
dent Jordan is expected to return to
the University in a few days, but will
leave for the North about April 22,
and expects to leave for Australia
April 26.
The principal speaker Monday will
be J. Lincoln Steffens, the well-known
political writer who is now in San
Francisco investigating graft for an
Eastern magazine. Steffens has a na
tional reputation, and he will prob
ably lecture on some phase of local
or national political graft. If Stef
fens can reach Palo Alto in time the
Assembly will be held at 10:15, other
wise it will be held at the usual hour,
11 :iS-
President Jordan will address the
students, and possibly Professor
Hempl will speak. The President's
speech will probably be about his and
Professor Hempl's trip East to attend
a meeting of the Simplified Spelling
Board.
