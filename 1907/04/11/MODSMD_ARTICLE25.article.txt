# FINAL GAME TOMORROW
## SENIORS WILL MEET FRESHMEN IN FINALS. Game Should be Close With Chances in Favor of Upperclass Ball Players. 
### 
The final game of the interclass
.series will be played tomorrow after
noon 011 the Varsity diamond at 3 130,
between the Seniors and the Fresh
men. The Senior infield is very fast
for a class team and should give Mc-
Clain good support, while the Fresh
men on the bags have had less prac
tice together and Little will have to
pitch good ball to hold the upper
class team down to an even score.
"While the Seniors seem to have the
best chance, the game should be hotly
contested throughout if Little pitches
the good ball that he pitched in the
Sophomore-Freshman game.
The lineup will be as follows:
Seniors —McClain, pitcher; Spaul
ding, catcher; Salisbury, first base;
Topp, second base; Eby, third base;
Rliyne, short stop; Slusher, left field;
Moser, center field; Burtis, right field.
Freshman—Little and Elliott, pitch
ers ; Ganong, catcher; Mitchell, first
base; Cuenin, second base; Stanton,
third base; Adams, short stop; Jordan,
left field; Cochran, centcr field; Mc-
Fadden, right field.
