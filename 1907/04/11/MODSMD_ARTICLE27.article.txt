# Greetings for Stanford Alumni.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Alumni Re
union Committee last night a circular
letter was adopted and will be sent
out to members of former graduating
classes. The letter is in the form of
a greeting urging members of former
graduating classes to adopt the plan
of returning to the University at reg
ular periods, for the alumni reunions.
