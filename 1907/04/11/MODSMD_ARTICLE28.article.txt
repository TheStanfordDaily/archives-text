# Los Gatos Wants "La Serena."
## 
### 
Sword and Sandals has received a
communication from parties in Los
Gatos as to the possibility of staging
"La Serena," which was lately pro
duced by the Junior class on Assem
bly Hall stage, March 21. The pro
duction of the play at Los Gatos is
practically impossible as the time for
rehearsals could not be spared by the
players.
