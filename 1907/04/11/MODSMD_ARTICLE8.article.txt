# NO PRIZE IS AWARDED
## ALL FARCES REJECTED BY SENIORS. Committee Decides That 1907 Class Will Present a Standard Farce Instead of Original Production. 
### 
The Senior Farce Committee has
decided not to give the usual original
farce during commencement week, but
to stage instead some standard farce
comedy, the name of which lias not
yet been decided upon. This action
was due to the poor quality of the
farccs submitted in competition for
the $50 prize offered by the Senior
class. Five manuscripts were sub
mitted but none of them were up to
the standard of past years. This is
not the first time that farce commit
tees have departed from accepting
undergraduate productions. The Se
nior farce committee of 1904 decided
upon the same action and produced
Gilbert and Sullivan's opera "Pa
tience." This action brought forth
numerous communications in the col
umns of the"Daily Palo Alto," both
attacking and defending the commit
tee.
The entire management of the 1907
play will be in the hands of Mrs.
J. C. Powers, of San Francisco. Mrs.
Powers coached "The Rivals," which
was staged by the 1907 Sophomore
class. Final arrangements will be
completed in another week, when the
cast and play will be chosen and re
hearsals will begin.
The Senior Farce Committee is
composed of Miss C. L. Moise, Mis.-.
E. L. Officer, Miss C. C. Pedlar, R. S.
Kellogg, G. C. Mansfield, J. F. Stew
art and F. H. Bernard, chairman.
