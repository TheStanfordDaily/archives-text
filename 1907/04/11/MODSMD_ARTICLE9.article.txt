# OREGON MEET CANCELLED.
## Faculty Athletic Committee Decides That Proposed Date is too Near Examination Week. 
### 
The Faculty Athletic Committee
has refused to sanction the proposed
track meet between Stanford and the
University of Oregon. The meet
was scheduled to take place on the
latter's oval on May 4. If the Stan
ford men had made the trip they
would have missed three days of col
lege work during the week preced
ing the end-semester examinations.
The Faculty Committee feared that
serious results might come of such
an absence and accordingly cancelled
the meet.
The majority of the track men
seem rather relieved that they will
not be forced to go North. They feel
that the training season is long
enough and want it to terminate 011
April 20.
