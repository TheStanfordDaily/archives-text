# OLYMPIC CLUB MEET
## TRACK CONTEST TOMORROW WILL BE FAST. Records in Half-Mile and Low Hurdles in Danger.â€”Plaw Will Enter. 
### 
A picked team of star athletes,
wearing the colors of the Olympic
Club of San Francisco, will meet
Stanford on cinder path and field to
morrow morning in the last prelim
inary meet before the great contest
with California. Followers of sport
on the Pacific Coast will watch the
result of tomorrow's races with great
interest. The Olympic runners suc
ceeded in placing their colors above
the Blue and Gold last Saturday in
a hotly contested meet, and the final
figures tomorrow will furnish an in
teresting comparison of strength of
the Stanford and California teams.
The Olympic Club will probably be
strengthened by the addition to their
ranks of Plaw, the great hammer
thrower, who will add a sure five
points to the club score.
The meet should be full of brilliant
races. The match half-mile, placed
first to ensure fast time, will undoubt
edly be a battle royal between Glar
ner, Maundrell and Miller. Glarner,
who runs for the visitors, is a strong
and heady runner. Stanford men
know the performances Miller and
Maundrell are capable of and with
Glarner to draw them out the ra:e
should be finished close to the even
two minute mark. Maundrell's time
of 2 minutes and 3 4-5 seconds, which
he made in the Freshman meet makes
it look as if victory will come to him.
but the only safe prediction is that
all of the three men will be closely
bunched when they cross the line.
Sncdigar will wear the winged O
in the sprints. He should win the
hundred, but he must have all his old
form if he is to take the two-twenty
also. Holman has run the distance
in 23 seconds, which will be very fast
for Snedigar. It is very doubtful if
Glarner, after his gruelling half-mile,
will be able to finish strong in the
quarter, and both first and second
places in this event should come to
Stanford with Edwards and Davis.
Miller should defeat Kelley in the
mile with case. Moulton is as yet un
decided whether to allow Nash to run
the full two miles tomorrow or not.
Stanford's two-miler needs a rest to
give him strength for the Intercolle
giate. and it is possible that he will
run but five laps against Garcia and
Nelson. If he runs to win the race,
however, the Olympic men must go
very near ten minutes to cross the
line first.
The visitors have speedy hurdlers
in Powell and Check, men who have
often run on the old Stanford track.
Tn the high hurdles these men will
probably prove invincible. They arc
both capable of fifteen and four-fifths
and the best performance done by
Captain Macfarland this season is
sixteen flat. Tn the low Macfarland
should turn the tables on his rivals
and win. Tie is consistently running
under twenty-six and if the Olympic
men push him he will probably get
down to twenty-five and three-fifths.
Stanford should win three out of

the five field events. Vandervoort in
the broad, Sterling in the high, and
Lanagan and Kocher in the pole
vault, arc first place men. Sncdigar
will be a dangerous man in the broad
as will Powell in the high, but the
Stanford men should win. Plaw will
take the hammer with ease, and Gil
more should have no more trouble
with the shot. The relay should be
won by the Cardinal without difficulty,
the visitors being weak in this event.
