# TO FORM EXPRESS COMPANY.
## Students Will Fight Recent Raise in Prices by Palo Alto Transfer Men. 
### 
Following the recent announcement
of the Palo Alto expressmen that
hereafter the charges for hauling
trunks and suit cases would be doub
led, a number of students determined
to meet the raise. Several plans, one
of which proposed to import express
men from some neighboring town,
were rejected as being entirely un
feasible. Now, however, a solution
has been found in the shape of a
temporary student organization which
is to be known as the "Students'
Transfer Company." S. S. Smith, '07,
G. B. Bush, '09, and V. C. McCul
lough, '09, constitute the active board
of directors, whose business it will be
to superintend the work of the enter
prise. They are supported by a num
ber of leading college men who will
cooperate with them whenever possi
ble.
A liberal policy will be pursued by
the new concern and efforts will be
made at once to obtain the Campus
trade by means of a systematic house
to house canvass. Teams and wag
ons have already been arranged for.
Baggage will be handled on May 13-
17 inclusive and May 21-24 inclusive,
at the old rates. Because of the lim
ited duration of the company, pay
ments must be made promptly on the
call for the baggage. An office will
probably be established in the Book
store. Whatever profits the under
taking may yield will be donated to
some Student Body activity.
