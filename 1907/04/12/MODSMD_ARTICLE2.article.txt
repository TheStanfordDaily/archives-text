# FIRST BASEBALL GAME TOMORROW
## Cardinal Stands Good, Chance of Capturing First of Series. Stanford Battery Has Not Yet Been Named. 
### 
The Intercollegiate season of spring
Varsity events will be opened on the
campus diamond tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30, when the Cardinal and Blue
and Gold will try conclusions in the
opening game of the baseball series.
Had the California diamond been in
proper condition last Saturday this
game would have been played then
as scheduled. Due to neglect or some
other as yet unexplained cause, the
Blue and Gold field was not fit to play
on and therefore California forfeited
the privilege of opening the serie?.
on her own grounds.
The Varsity may be looked to meet
the ball hard and often tomorrow.
Their showing in the last ten days
justifies the expectation that the men
in Cardinal will break the hoodoo
which has hung over Stanford batters
in Intercollegiate series for a good
many seasons. If the nine men whotr.
Lanagan will send into the game to
morrow do not win by superior hit
ting there will be disappointment in
all 1 quarters.
This then, is practically a prophecy
that the Cardinal nine will win. Suck
is without doubt more than the gen
eral hope. The Blue and Gold ma>
outpoint the Varsity in the field—
they probably will—but unless Jordan
pitches superior ball neither Theile
or Goodell, whichever may be sent
into the box, will be hit as hard as the
visiting twirler.
A week ago today Coach Lanagan
announced that he had been unable
to decide on the make up of the bat
tery which he would send in for the
Cardinal in the game expected to oc
cur the following afternoon. Stott
and Daily were about on even terms
for the catcher's position and Theile
and Goodell were a toss-up for
pitcher. Although it was the general
opinion that the events of the past
week had altered the complexion of

the fight for these positions, when
seen this afternoon Coach Lanagan
said he could not yet name his bat
tery, and that he would adhere to his
determination of last week, of nam
ing them on the bench prior to the
calling of the game.
Daily has had the misfortune to
have been taken sick the early part
of the week and for that reason it
would seem that Stott is the logical
choice for backstop. In the >irule
game of the week, that with St.
Mary's College, Theile showed that
he was still capable of clever w jrk 111
the box.
There have been no changes in the;
field since last week. The same base
men and fielders who were named on
Friday last will be sent into the game
tomorrow. Captain Presley, Cad
walader, Sampson, and Fenton about
the diamond; Owen, Wirt, and Scott
in left, center and right fields re
spectively.
Coach Bliss has had his players se
lected for some time. The only par
ticular contest for positions has been
between Jordan and Ghirardelli for
the box honor, but the former has had
a lead from the outset.
Harry Edwards, '01, one of the best
known of the alumni baseball men
and Goslinski, a graduate of Califor
nia, will act as umpires.
The teams will face each other in
the following order: Stanford—Stott
or Daily, catcher; Theile or Goodell,
pitcher; Presley (c), first base; Cad
walader, second base; Sampson, short
stop; Fenton, third base; Owen, left
field; Wirt, center field; Scott, right
field.
California—Schaefer, catcher; Jor
dan, pitcher; Wulzen, first base; Reid,
second base; Causley, shortstop; lieis
ter, third base; Myers, left field.
Sweezy (c), center field; Miller, right
field.
