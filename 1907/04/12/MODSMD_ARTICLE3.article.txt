# Rental for Rehearsals not Removed.
## 
### 
Sword and Sandals were unsuccess
ful in their attempt to secure the use
of Assembly Hall stage, for rehearsals
free of charge. The Business Office
receives five dollars per night for ev
ery rehearsal held on the stage, and
the attempt of the dramatic society
to have this rental done away with,
was unsuccessful.
