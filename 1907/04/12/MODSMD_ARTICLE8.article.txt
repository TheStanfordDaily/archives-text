of the book by Editor H. F. Briming,

Dramatics and College Year—G. B.
Bush; Organizations—H. L. Rixford;
Literary—Miss L. Wells; Classes—R.
S. Worthington; Athletics—E. E.
Young.
Work will commence immediately,
as the record of the 1909 "Quad" will
begin with March 30, including the
second Freshman Intercollegiate
track meet and all the events which
have taken place since. The efforts
of the board this year will be directed
to enlivening the matter which will
make up the book. Ne,w ideas will
be welcomed wherever they can be
used. Statistics will be presented in
a novel way; illustrations will be pro
fuse.
The department called the College.
Year will be devoted to all affairs
which do not come strictly under the
other headings, and which are typical
of the Stanford life and atmosphere.
This department will be built up so
as to take rank with those of longer
establishment. The material in each
department of the "Quad" will be
worked up with a view to originality
and distinctiveness.
