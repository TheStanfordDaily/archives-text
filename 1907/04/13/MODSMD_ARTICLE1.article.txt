# STANFORD WINS GAME
## Cardinal Shuts Out California In First of Series By a Score of 1 to 0. 
### 
Centerfielder Wirt of the Cardinal
stepped to the plate the first man up
in the third inning of the opening
game of the intercollegiate series on
the campus this afternoon. He drove
the third ball pitched by Jordan, the
Blue and Gold twirler safe into right
field. A moment later Jordan threw
badly to first in an effort to catch the
Stanford man off his guard. Schaef
fer, the California catcher allowed a
curve to slip from his fingers and
Wirt was resting on third base.
Freshman Scott did what the great
crowd was calling on him to do and
smashed a stiff ground ball at Caus
ley, the opposing shortstop and while
the Blue and Gold fielder retrieved the
sphere, Wirt crossed the home plate
with the only run of the game.
In the last of the ninth inning Wul
zen of the visiting nine was safe on
first base by a fielder's choice. Two
men were out and the Stanford
bleachers had risen from their seals
in excitement. Theile cut the plate
with two strikes on Sweezy, the Cali
fornia captain, to whom had come the
opportunity of bringing victory out
of seeming defeat for his team, the
next ball pitched Sweezy bounced a
slow one at Fenton. The third base
man threw off his balance high, to
Presley and two Blue and Gold ball
players were on the bags. With two
strikes on him, Schaeffer the next to
the bat hit to the same place but this
time Fenton's throw was true and the
cardinal bleachers swept down onto
the field. The Varsity had won 1-0.
These were the two exciting mo
ments of the match. The first when
Stanford tallied the run which ulti
mately meant victory. The other
when California appeared dangerous
ly near to tying the score.
But one other instance and the sen
sational events of the game are told.
Heister for the visitors drove out .1
hit to open the fourth inning. Wul
zen, his teammate who followed laid
down a perfect sacrifice on the first
base line. Sweezy tore off a scorch
ing drive through the center of the
diamond and with the California
bleachers on their feet Heister start
ed for home. It was good baseball
but the Berkeley third baseman had
not reckoned with the arm of out
fielder Wirt. In came the ball per
fectly, to the third base line. Stot:
picked up the bounce neatly and
tagged the baserunner as he slid into
the plate. Only the perfect throw by
Wirt and the perfect catch by Stott
saved the Varsity at this juncture
from a tie game. This was easily the
fielding feature of the nine innings
and both players were given an ova
tion for their work.
To Theile should go the remainder
of the credit for the shut out. He was
in his best form and for the last
five innings the California batsmen

did not get the semblance of a hit.
He was at no time in a hole through
his own fault and to him is largely
due the honor for the victory.
From the Blue and Gold viewpoint
the same should be said of Jordan.
He too was touched for but three
hits and had the home players puz
zled at all times.
Both teams met the ball often but
there was almost always a fielder
waiting for it. Honors in the field
were evenly divided. Had they not
been, the result would have been dif
ferent. There is little to choose be
tween the nines in this respect and
the succeeding game or games will be
decided by stick work. Scott's smash
in the third inning brought victory
to Stanford. A drive by Sweezy or
Schaeffer in the last inning would
have probably changed the result of
the game. The home players re
sponded to the occasion at the criti
cal time. California was unable to do
so.
The work of Edwards and Gos
linsky, respectively alumni of Stan
ford and California was highly satis
factory as alternating umpires. Each
showed a commendable desire to act
fairly and there is no criticism of their
judgment due.
Long before the time scheduled for
the game the great crowd began to
gather on the bleachers. Both tiers
of seats were filled and the spectators
flowed down over the side lines and
out into the field making ground rule-:
necessary. The Stanford rooters had
the west bleachers as usual while a
handful of California partisans were
mingled with the overflow of the
Cardinal crowd on the other side of
the field.
Coach Lanagan announced his bat
tery at the bench but a short time be
fore the opening of the game. His
selection was generally anticipated,
still there was a lively interest as to
who would be delegated to occupy the
pivotal positions. The work of Theile
and Stott justified the choice and as
the outcome of the game shows thei*
playing was a determining factor in
the result.
