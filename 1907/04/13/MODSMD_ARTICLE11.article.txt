# DR. JORDAN IS BACK
## PRESIDENT RETURNS FROM EASTERN TRIP. Interviews Many Law Professors But Cannot Yet Tell Who Will Come Here. 
### 
After an absence extending over
a period of nearly three weeks,
President Jordan returned to the
University this morning. He ar
rived in San Francisco last night,
coming direct from Chicago.
Dr. Jordan would give out nothing
definite about the new Law profes
sors, whom he went East to procure.
Concerning this, the .President said:
"While away, I interviewed many
Law professors, and at present I
have an armful of available names.
I can say nothing more until the
next meeting of the Board of Trus
tees. There will be a special meet
ing of that board next Wednesday
to pass upon the matter."
The President seemed pleased
with the results of his trip, and two
high-class men have undoubtedly
been secured to fill the vacancies in
the Law department.
Speaking further about his trip,
Dr. Jordan said: "In New York I
attended the meeting of the Carne
gie Simplified Spelling Board on
April 3d. While in session the
board determined that hereafter any
proposed changes should be submit
ted to all the members. As the
board is composed of fifty represen
tative men, anything sanctioned by
the entire body will surely be praise
worthy. On April sth I attended the
meeting of the commission to con
sider the organization of agricul
tural research in the colleges and ex
periment stations of the United
States. This meeting was held in
Washington, D. C. I also visited
Chicago and Lincoln, Neb., where I
interviewed several Law professors."
While passing through Chicago
last Monday evening, Dr. Jordan
was given a dinner by thirty Stan
ford men. The banquet was held at
the Union League Club.
Dr. Hempl, of the German depart
ment, accompanied the President on
his trip East.
