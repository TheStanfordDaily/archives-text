# OLYMPIC CLUB WINS SENSATIONAL MEET
## 
### 
In the fastest track meet of the
season Stanford went down to de
feat before the team of stars wearing
the winged "O" of the Olympic Club
of San Francisco. The final score
stood 63 1-3 to 58 2-3. The cinder
path was fast and many of the per
formances there this morning would
have done credit to athletes meeting
in international competition. A
half-mile in 1 minute 58 3-5 sec
onds, a quarter in 50 3-5, the low
hurdles in 25 flat and the high in
15 4-5, and a two-mile nearly eight
seconds under 10 minutes—these
are performances well worthy of the
magnificent new field upon which
they were run. The field events
were not up to the class of those on
the cinder path, but they were above
the a\ *age. >'< 1 '
The half-mile furnished the great
race which was expected. Severy led
the men out for half of the first lap
when Glarner went to the front. The
Olympic Club man was very strong
and his last quarter was too fast for
the Stanford entries, who dropped
01 e by one. Maundrell was unfortun
ate in getting a bad start, but he
ran a game race and finished second
in 2 minutes 2 1-5 seconds. Shel
ton was a good third. Cheek and
Powell more than sustained their
reputations in the hurdles, Cheek
running the low in 25 seconds flat,
which is very close to a flew coast
record. Many claim that 25 sets a
new mark for this event, but the
coast record is at present such a
matter of doubt that it is impossi
ble to make a positive statement. In
both the low and high, Macfarland
ran his usual good races and showed
that his points may be relied upon
In the Intercollegiate meet.
Glarner was easily the star of the
meet. This versatile athlete, after
winning the half mile in wonderful
time, took Edwards measure in the
quarter mile in time which is but
two- fifths of a second away from
the Coast record. Nelson proved
the dangerous man he was said to
be in the two-mile, winning in 9
minutes 52 1-5 seconds. Nash was
taken out of the race by Moulton,
who was unwilling that Stanford's
two-mller should run a gruelling
race a week before the meet with
California. Holman defeated the
speedy Snedigar in the hundred and
took the two-twenty in 23 seconds
flat. In the broad Snedigar won from
Vandervoort by a jump of 22 feet
2 1-2 inches, with Vandervoort close
behind with 22 feet 1 inch.
Powell also upset calculations in
the high jump, defeating Sterling.
The shot went to Gilmore, but Craw

came very close to shattering the
Coast record in this event.
