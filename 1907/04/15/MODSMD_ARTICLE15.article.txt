# Two Starters at Saturday's Meet.
## 
### 
Two starters will he the unusual
feature of the Intercollegiate meet at
Berkeley next Saturday. At the
meeting of track captains and man
agers last Saturday it was decided to
try this plan in an endeavor to do
away with the protests which arc the
general rule where one official does
all the starting. The two starters
will he alumni of the competing uni
versities, either J. C. McCaughern or
C. F. Laumeistcr of Stanford and O.
F. Snedigar of California. The two
officials will alternate with the gun,
the one not engaged in starting hav
ing the privilege of recalling or penal
izing if such action is warranted.
