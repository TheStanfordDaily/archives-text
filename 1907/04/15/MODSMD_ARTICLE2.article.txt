# LINCOLN STEFFENS ON GRAFT.
## Political Writer Speaking in Assembly Hall, Says All Branches of Government are Corrupt.â€”Dr. Jordan Speaks. 
### 
Lincoln Steffens, exposer of graft
ers and magazine writer, introduced
himself to the students of Stanford in
Assembly Hall this morning as a
muck raker, but before the close of
his speech he made it clear that mor*
muck rakers of his kind are needed.
To those who believe in good gov
ernment and ideal conditions his re
marks were exceedingly pessimistic,
but in view of local conditions they
d : d not cause much surprise.
Ten years ago Steffens was a re
porter in New York, and there com
menced the study of graft which has
led him to place little confidence in
politicians or business men. From
police department graft, which he
says exists in every city in the coun
try, and for which there seems at
present to be no remedy, he pro
gressed to municipal, state, and na
tional graft. The preeminent cause
of graft according to Steffens, is not
so much the fault of the grafter as
that of business and business men.
"Business is more important in the
eyes of the business man than good
men or an honest police force," said
the speaker. "Not only is San Fran
cisco steeped in graft, but also every
city in the country, the peculiar thing
being that it is typical. The effect of
the briber is not to make a city coun
cil help the interests of democracy,
but to have the council represent al
ways the same kind -of men in the
same kind of business, such as gas,
franchises, and liquor. Granted priv
ileges which makes cities, also make
men corrupt. In conjunction with
graft there is always business and the
state government. The state is cor
rupted by the same men and the same
interests which corrupt the city gov
ernment."
Steffens was twelve weeks in Wash
ington, D. C., and as a result of his

investigations there, he said among
other things"The bribe does not
matter so much as the effect of the
bribe. \\ e should be indignant be
cause the legislative branch of the
government docs not represent us.
Jhe House and Senate represent
those who are seeking to get things
out of the government. Corrupt in
fluences rule in Washington as they
rule in other places. We no longer
rule ourselves but we are ruled by the
railroads.
"I thought for a time that the cure
for the graft evil was to put good
business men into office. This will
not remedy corruption. Since the lid
has been lifted from the insurance
companies we are able to see that
business men are as big grafters as
politicians. If one business of a kind
is bad others are like it.
"What is the matter?" the speaker
inquired. "I suggest that we restore
representative government. This
means a fight. Not a bloody fight
but the same kind that Theodore
Roosevelt is making in Washington.
We can never hurt the railroads as
the railroads have hurt us. We
should fight as lleney, Folk, and Col
by are fighting. We do not need
physical courage but moral courage.
Any of us can withstand bullets but
we want the courage also to be losers.
America is full of winners; what we
want is losers."
Preceding the address of Stef
fens, President Jordan spoke of his
attendance at the meeting of the
Simplified Spelling Board in New
York. He also said that he had inter
viewed men whom he had in mind
for the Law department next year.
President Jordan will probably an
nounce the names of the men Wed
nesday, after the meeting of the Trus
tees.
