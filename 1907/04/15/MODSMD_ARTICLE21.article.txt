# MEETING ON WEDNESDAY.
## Student Body Will Nominate Officers for Next Year.â€”Few Candidates Declare Themselves. 
### 
Wednesday afternoon at 1:15, the
annual Student Body meeting for the
nomination of next year's Student
Body officers, will be held in the
Chapel. The amendments to the Stu
dent Body constitution passed by the
Executive Committee at its meeting
last Wednesday night, will also be
presented for ratification at this time.
The fight for Student Body offices
has not developed into the bitter
competition which marked the post
poned election last September. It is
understood that there will be a con
test for the position of Graduate
Manager, but no candidates have an
nounced themselves for the presi
dency of the Student Body. The Ex
ecutive Committee positions will
probably bring the usual contest, es
pecially for the representatives from
the three classes.
It is understood that there will be
a fight for the editorship of the
"Daily Palo Alto" and the office of
Business Manager of that publication
will probably also be contested. Only
one candidate has so far appeared for
the editorial position 011 the "Se
quoia" and no aspirant for the man
agership has made public his inten
tions as yet. It is almost a certainty
that the money-making possibilities
of this publication which has been
developed during the past year will
bring out more than one aspirant for
that position.
