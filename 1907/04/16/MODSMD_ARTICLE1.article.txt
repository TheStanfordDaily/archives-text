# REPORT ON BRENNAN
## 1907 COMMITTEE SUBMITS FINDINGS. Class Lays Matter on Table.—"Quad" Manager is Practically Exonerated by Investigators. 
### 
The Senior class at a regular meet
ing this afternoon refused either to
exonerate or pass resolutions unfavor
able to J. F. Brennan, '07, who, as
manager of the 1907 "Quad," was un
der suspicion because of the financial
condition of the annual. Although j
the report submitted by the investi
gating committee practically free:-!
Brennan from any juggling of ac
counts the class refused to consider
the report as submitted, without fur- j
ther consideration. After consider-
able delay, during which President
Ward urged that some action be taken j
either in favor of or against Brennan
E. H. Pier moved that the report be
laid 011 the table until a subsequent
meeting of the class.
The report of the committee, which
is made up of H. P. Bittner, '07, G.
Knupp, '07, and Frank A. Fisher, '07,
shows that Brennan, so far as the
committee could discover, is blame
less of any wrong doing. Fisher,
who is chairman of the committee,
after reading the report to the class,
volunteered the statement that Bren
nan had told the committee that he
had actually disbursed a larger
amount from his personal account
than he had received for his work as
manager. The report follows:
"We, the undersigned committee ap
pointed to investigate the affairs of
the '07 "Quad," respecfully submit to
the class the following report of re
ceipts and disbursements as computed
by Mr. Brennan, from what data vva«
not burned in the fire of last April.
Receipts
Class assessments actually paid,
about $ 550
Organization and frat. assessm't 650
$1200
According to Brennan's report, and
so far as the committee can learn,
this was the amount received by the
management of the original "Quad. '
Disbursements
Paid to advertising solicitors....? 650
Editorial expenses 80
Stationery and incidentals 90
Material for business ad edito
rial staff, and incidentals 14,3
Personal expenses while acting
as manager of the "Quad".... 237
$1200
The above list of disbursements is
taken from the report given the com
mittee by Brennan. The committee
finds that payment for advertisements
upon a 30 per cent basis is a usual
and customary rate for work of this
character.
The committee finds that Mr. Bren
nan has secured a total of approxi
mately $3700 worth of advertising con
tracts, part of which were turned over
to H. S. Crocker & Co., upon the
printing contract. By the wording of
the contract with the printers, no lia
bility was incurred in the event that
the "Quad" was not actually delivered.
The committee further finds that
for a specified consideration Mr.
Brennan purchased from Messrs.

Smith & Salisbury, managers of the
final '07 "Quad," the exclusive right
to obtain and receive payment for all
advertisements from San Francisco
appearing in the final "Quad," and
that a majority of the firms so ad
vertising in the final "Quad" were
those which had previously contracted
to advertise in the original "Quad."
