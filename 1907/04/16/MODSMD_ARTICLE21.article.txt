# Invitational Tryouts for Senior Farce
## 
### 
An invitational tryout will be held
this evening for places on the cast of
"London Assurance'." Mrs. Powers,
the coach, will be present to assist
in the choosing of the cast. There
are twelve characters in the comedy,
nine being masculine parts. This
makes it impossible to limit the cas'
to members of the Senior class, and
the remainder of the characters will
be chosen from the members of
Sword and Sandals. Formal an
nouncement of the cast will be made
before the close of this week.
