# TO BOYCOTT "SEQUOIA"
## WOMEN WILL REFUSE TO BUY MAGAZINE. Herron's Policy of Sensationalism Rouses Concerted Opposition. All Women Resign. 
### 
The climax to long smouldering in
dignation among the women students l
of the University at the sensationa'
style of the "Sequoia" will come to
morrow morning when a boycott will
he declared hy them on the issue of
the magazine which is to appear then.
Not a girl will buy the "Sequoia" and
it is even the spirit of the indignation
sentiment that those who are regular
subscribers shall refuse to read Editor
Herrou's magazine.
For some days the word has been
going the rounds that now is the time
once and for all for the women to ex
press their disapprobation of the edi
torial tactics which have proved so
distasteful to them. The plan has
been a matter of common discussion
in the sorority houses and girls' dor
mitories, and so quietly and effect
ively has the boycott been planned
that not until today did the move
ment gain publicity. To add to tlv.
thoroughness of their disapproval of
the "Sequoia," the agitators have se
cured the resignation of the women
members of the magazine staff. Miss
L. M. Wells, '09, resigned some time
ago and Miss D. C. French, '07, and
Miss A. Crawford, '08, today asked
to be dropped from the list of editors.
As for Herrou's part rather than
being discomfited by the uprising
among the women of the University,
he declared his intention this after
noon of ordering an additional 100
copies printed and stated that while
his editorial policy had never been
consciously misrepresentative of the
women students, that it most cer
tainly had never been dictated by
them.
"As for the members of the staff
who are resigning," he added, "they
were about to be relieved from furthet
duty anyhow as it had come to my
cars some time previously that they
were criticising my policy."
Details of the "revolution" arc not
easy to secure but the impetus for
the outburst of indignation seems to
have been the advertisement in large
letters of the appearance of a poem
"Baths'neba" in tomorrow's issue,
which it had come to the ears ot
leaders of tl e bovcott movement was
r.ot all that should be expected of it.
In the words of a prominent woman,
"It was the last straw which broke
the camel's back." A house to house
canvass seems to have been the
method whereby sentiment was cry
stallized and unanimity of action se
cured in dealing with Herron's dis
tasteful policy.
The indignation of the women dates
from the closing days of Editor
Bickel's regime last semester, when
the much-discussed article on drink
ing by "A Stanford Woman" ap
peared. At that time, so it is said
Cap and Gown and the Woman's
Conference participated in somewhat
pointed discussions of the changcd pol
icy of the hitherto conservative
monthly. The article in question was
said to be misrepresentative of Uni
versity women and for that reason

deserving of censure. The appear
ance some time ago of the "Love
Letters of a Co-Ed," added fuel to
the flames. At this time, as it is un
derstood, the boycott method of vent
ing their displeasure was first pro
posed. President Jordan at this time,
so it is said, concurred at a meeting
of the Woman's Conference, in the
plan of refusing to purchase the of
fensive publication.
Herron's ideas of dealing with the
"Bogie" writers, whom he treated edi
torially, did not meet with the ap
proval of the women either and when
the context of the narrative poem
"Bathshcba" became circulated and
the fact that the "Sequoia" would also
in tomorrow's number refer to Cap
and Gown sarcastically, the long pent
up flood of indignation broke loose.
