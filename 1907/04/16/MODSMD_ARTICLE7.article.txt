The April number of the "Sequoia,"
which will go on sale tomorrow, is
devoted to spring athletics, the prin

track, accompanied by photographs of
prominent athletes. The issue also
contains a story by Miss A. Crawford,

page narrative poem, illustrated.
The editorials attack the new ath
letic system inaugurated by the fac
ulty, discuss Presley's appointment as
assistant coach and Lanagan's resig
nation, the attitude of some of the
women's organizations in regard to
the "Love Letters of a Co-ed," and
the lighting of the avenue.
