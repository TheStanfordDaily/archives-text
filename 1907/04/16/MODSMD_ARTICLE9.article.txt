With Stanford's new track com
pleted and in magnificent condition,
it seems as though some of the out- j
side meets which have heretofore I
been held 011 the California oval, j
might as reasonably be run off her;-. J
The Blue and Gold track is admit
tedly slower than Stanford's cinder
path, and undoubtedly better results j
could be obtained by races here !
Under these circumstances it would
certainly do no harm to extend an in
vitation to the P. A. A. and other ;
similar associations to hold their
championship meets on the new Stan
ford track.
