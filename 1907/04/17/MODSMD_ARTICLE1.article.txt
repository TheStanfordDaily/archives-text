### 
The Varsity will meet the St. Vin
cent team of Los Angeles tomorrow
afternoon at 3:30 on the Varsity dia
mond. The St. Vincent team holds
the Southern California amateur
championship and broke even with
California in their series with that
team, which speaks well for any team
of this class. The game tomorrow in
all probability will be very close but,
judging from comparative scores, the
representatives of the Cardinal should
lie victorious. Scott will play second
tomorrow and Gore goes into the
field.

Stanford—Theile and Goodell, pitch
ers; Stott, catcher; Presley, first base;
Scott, second base; Fenton, third

left field; Wirt, center field; Gore,
right field.
