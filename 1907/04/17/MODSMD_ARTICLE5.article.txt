by the two-thirds vote required by
the constitution. The first requires

that managers of the"Daily Palo
Alto" and "Sequoia" shall keep their
accounts of receipts and expend"'tires
after the form of those of the grad
uate manager. This means that the
form of the vouchers used by the
Uirted States government for ex

detailed statements of receipts, certi
fied by themselves, and whenever pos

The fourth amendment provides
that the constitution shall be changed

of the chairman of the Faculty Ath

chairman of the Board, a second fac
ulty member appointed by the Presi
dent of the University, the president
and secretary of the Associated Stu
dents, and two alumni members,
elected by the Executive Committee.
The fifth amendment changes the
amount of the regular Student Body
assessment in the first semester of
the college year from one to two dol
lars. The assessment for the second
semester remains one dollar. Con
siderable discussion was occasioned
when the proposed amendment was
read. After arguments for and
against the proposition had been
made, the question was called for.
A vote was had, but on a call for a
division the motion to adopt the
amendment was passed by an over
whelming majority.

All five amendments proposed by
the Executive Committee were passed
by the two-thirds vote required by
the constitution. The first requires

that managers of the"Daily Palo
Alto" and "Sequoia" shall keep their
accounts of receipts and expend"'tires
after the form of those of the grad
uate manager. This means that the
form of the vouchers used by the
Uirted States government for ex
penditures will be used by the man
agers of the two Student Body pub
lications. They are also to produce
detailed statements of receipts, certi
fied by themselves, and whenever pos
sible, by other persons also.
The second amendment provides
that candidates not nominated in reg
ular meetings shall publicly announce
their candidacy twenty-four hours be
fore the regular election.
The third amendment merely trans
fers the section which defines the
form of bonds from the article con
cerning elections to that headed "mis
cellaneous."
The fourth amendment provides
that the constitution shall be changed
so as to read consistently with the
organization of the Board of Control
as it now exists. The Board consists
of the chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, who is ex-ofiicio
chairman of the Board, a second fac
ulty member appointed by the Presi
dent of the University, the president
and secretary of the Associated Stu
dents, and two alumni members,
elected by the Executive Committee.
The fifth amendment changes the
amount of the regular Student Body
assessment in the first semester of
the college year from one to two dol
lars. The assessment for the second
semester remains one dollar. Con
siderable discussion was occasioned
when the proposed amendment was
read. After arguments for and
against the proposition had been
made, the question was called for.
A vote was had, but on a call for a
division the motion to adopt the
amendment was passed by an over
whelming majority.
