# BOATING MEN IMPROVE
## MURPHY IS PLEASED WITH WORK OF MEN. Two Handsome Trophies Won in Southern Races Are Received by Captain Zimmerman. 
### 
With barely a week left in which
to round the Varsity and Freshman
crcws into final shape, Coach Murphy
today stated that the men were "just
showing signs of getting into condi
tion." This does not appear to be
worrying the veteran oarsman how
ever, and he later said in conversa
tion, that by the 27th "We will give
California a hard race." Further
than this Murphy would not express
any views on the question of the In
tercollegiate contest.
The men are daily journeying to
Redwood about the middle of the af
ternoon and returning on a late train.
On account of classes and laboratory
work this is the only time when all
the men can row together. This is
not the best time to row as the bay
is quite rough late in the afternoon,
and Murphy expressed himself as dis
satisfied that he had no long stretch
over which the men could train, th't
rough water confining him to the ex
treme upper end of the slough.
The coach recently heard from an
Eastern oarsman who is now in the
North, that the Washington crew
were an extremely fast aggregation
and were rowing in splendid form.
All Murphy's spare time is being
spent in getting boats in shape and in
preparing for the coming races. It
is probable that the crews will leave
here next Wednesday with the boats
and spend the remainder of the week
in training over the course at Sausa
lito.
Captain Zimmerman received today
from Shreve & Co. of San Francisco,
the two cups which the Varsity and
second crews won- in the South. They
are handsome cups, each twelve inches
in height of heavy silver in handsome
designs, the bowls being gold lined,
and engraved with the names of the
Naples Rowing Club, and the date.
On the reverse are engraved the
names of the crews and their cox
swains with their positions and class
numerals.
