# Dual Gymnastic Exhibition Off.
## 
### 
The dual exhibition planned for
next month by the Stanford and Los
Angeles High School Gymnasium
Clubs will not take place as the Los
Angeles Club cannot come to Stan
ford before May 10, and that date
would be too late for the Stanford
Club. Instead of the dual event,
the Gymnasium Club will give its reg
ular annual exhibition in Encina Gym
nasium, Friday evening, May 3.
