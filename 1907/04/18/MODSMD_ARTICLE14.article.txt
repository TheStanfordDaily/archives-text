The first anniversary of the earth
quake of 1906 naturally calls for a
brief retrospect of the work accomp
lished during the past year. The final
effects of the catastrophe, and its
place in Stanford history cannot be
determined for many years to come.
It is undoubtedly true, however, that
what the University lost in buildings
and actual working equipment, was
fully compensated for by the growth
of good feeling and confidence be
tween the Faculty and the Student
Body and by the revival of the tradi
tional Stanford spirit. The year just
passed has seen only the beginning of
the work of reconstruction. The
Commission of Engineers in that
short space of time, although ham
pered by labor troubles and the diffi
culty of securing building materials,
has almost completed the most nec
essary repairs on the actual working
buildings of the University. The
restoration of the more ornamental
buildings will undoubtedly come in
time, but it will probably not be seen
by the present generation of under
graduates. In the face of the enor
mous expenditures necessitated by re
pairs, the Board of Trustees has
shown its faith in Stanford's future
by voting appropriations for the ath
letic fields and for the strengthening
of the Faculty. It is a significant co
incidence that the first anniversary of
the earthquake should see an impor
tant addition to the Faculty of the
Law department. If the progress of
the past year is to be taken as an in
dex to the progress of the years to
come, each succeeding anniversary of

the fateful 18th of April will see Stan
ford University strengthened and
welded into one of California's great
est institutions.
