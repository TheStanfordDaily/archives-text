# CUNHA YELL LEADER
## APPOINTED TO ACT WITH KELLOGG. Executive Committee Puts Former Yell Leader in His Old Position For Meet. 
### 
E. A. Cunha, '07, was last night ap
pointed yell leader by the Executive
Committee to act in conjunction with
R. S. Kellogg, '07, at the rally tonight
and at the Intercollegiate contests on
Saturday. The appointment was
made at the request of Kellogg, who
felt the need of an assistant, and the
Executive Committee considered that
Cunha was the only man in college
qualified to fill the position. The ap
pointee has had experience as a yel!
leader. Last year he led the bleach
ers for two semesters. In the year
previous he served as an assistant un
der M. H. Thorpe, '05.
At last night's meeting of the Ex
ecutive Committee, a committee of
three was chosen to superintend the
printing of a new Student Body con
stitution containing all the amend
ments passed since the adoption of
the old document which is now in use.
In the booklet containing the consti
tution, the revised copy of the Inter
collegiate Agreement will be printed.
The committee appointed by Presi
dent Thompson is composed of D. D.
Sales, '06, C. R. Cridcr, '07, and J. E.
Cushing, '08.
At the next meeting of the Commit
tee some action will probably be taken
looking to the revision and printing
of a complete list of Stanford records
as they now stand. The present lists
are inadequate and most of them are
so confused as to be practically use
less. The Committee will wait until
next week when the track season is
over and then compile a final and
official list.
Manager Sales reported that he had
made definite arrangements with Cal
ifornia and Washington for the Inter
collegiate regatta. The Northern
ers will receive a guarantee to help
pay their expenses and in return for
this they will bring the winning crew
North to row on Lake Washington.
