# Parade Commemorates Earthquake.
## 
### 
In decided contrast to the scenes
of exactly a year ago was the spec
tacle which aroused the Campus from
its slumbers shortly after five o'clock
this morning. A pajama parade rival
ling in size the one usually held in
the fall semester, was the unique
feature of the first annual commemo
ration of the great earthquake.
The procession organized in En
cina Hall and at exactly thirteen min
utes past five, the time of the first
shock last April, it took up its noisv
march across the Campus. Roble
was the first place visited and from
there the shouting crowd followed the
usual course onto the Row and back
again to the Hall.
