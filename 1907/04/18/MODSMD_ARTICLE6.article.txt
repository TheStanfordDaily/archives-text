# WOODWARD IS CHOSEN
## HEAD OF NORTHWESTERN LAW SCHOOL SECURED. One of the Two Existing Vacancies is Definitely Filled by President Jordan. 
### 
The appointment of Frederic Camp
bell Woodward to a professorship in
the Law department is the first step
toward the filling of the two vacancies
in that department. The lawyer for
the second place has not yet been
definitely secured, so no announce
ment can be made at the present time.
Professor Woodward graduated
from the Cornell School of Law with
the class of '94. He received his
LL. M.from that university in '95.
During the next three years he prac
ticed in New York, and from 1898 to
1902 he was Professor of Law at Cor
nell and at Dickinson College. From
the latter institution he received an
honorary degree of A. M. Since
1902 Woodward has filled the chair
of Professor of Law at Northwestern
University at Evanston, 111. During
his career he has written many note
worthy articles, among which are the
following: "Statutory Limitations of
Freedom of Contract," "The Doctrine
of Divisible Contracts," "Impossibil
ity of Performance as an Excuse for
Breach of Contract," and "Assignabil
ity of Contracts." At present Wood
ward is editor-in-chief of the Illinois
Law Review.
At Northwestern, Woodward has
had charge of the courses in Con
tracts, Trusts, Quasi-Contracts, Sales,
Code Pleading, and Bankruptcy. Al
though it has not been fully decided
he will probably give next year the
courses in Contracts, Sales, Partner
ship and Bankruptcy. The appoint
ment of Woodward is permanent and
he will come to Stanford at the begin
ning of the fall semester.
For the other vacancy in the Law
department President Jordan is try
ing to procure a distinguished Stan
ford alumnus, who formerly held a
professorship of Law at Columbia,
but is now practicing law in New
York. His name is withheld until he
has been definitely secured. It is pos
sible that the person in question may
not be able to give up bis business
immediately. In that case a tempo
rary appointment for next semester
may be made. Whoever fills this va
cancy during the coming year will
have charge of the Property courses.
