Stanford sends one of the strong
est track teams in her history to
wear her colors on California's cinder
path and field tomorrow. It is very
doubtful if any Cardinal team has
carried with it the confidence which
goes with Macfarland's men. The
last days of warm, bright weather
have served to round the runners into
their best form, the men 011 the sick
list have their strength back again,
and in the whole squad there is the
determination to wrest a victory from
California.
Captain and Trainer Satisfied.
Captain and Trainer are well satis
fied with the results of their work
and both look forward to Stanford's
third track victory. "I think we'll
win," says Moulton. "I am more
than pleased at the way the men have
worked in good and bad weather.
They deserve victory and I think they
will get it." Macfarland makes a con
servative statement: "A close, hard
meet is expected, but the team has
fight and determination and should
win."
Prospects Good on Track.
Stanford should start the meet
rigbt by taking two places in the
mile. Maundrell and Miller are
stronger than DeMamiel in this event,
and they ought to come to the tape
together with a safe lead. Bradford
has run a game race throughout the
season and DeMamiel will find the
third place disputed all the way by
this runner. Holman's races against
Parsons and Snedigar and his con
sistent improvement warrant the
statement that even if Stanton tries
the hundred lie may find defeat. Reed
and Vandervoort may be relied upon
to take the other point. In the two
twenty tlie outlook is fair. Wearied
by a hard run in the quarter Califor
nia's sprinter must have great reserve
strength if he is to better 23 seconds
and win from the Stanford man. The
quarter will be one of the great races
of tlic day. Roth Edwards and Davis
arc running under the even fifty-two
seconds, and their fight with Stanton
will be one of the spectacles of the
meet. Either Edwards or Stanton
should win with Davis at their heels.
Three Stanford men in the half-mile

should find their way across the finish
line in front of the California entries
Maundrell, Miller, Shelton and Scvery
are unusually high class runners in
the middle distances and their work
will be easy for them.
Nash Should Win Easily.
Stanford is confident of the live
points in the two-mile. Nash has
steadily cut down bis time until he is
dangerously near ten minutes flat and
his race against Dcßemer ought to I>j
won as he pleases. McGregor runs a
heady race and should take the third
place. Captain Macfarland may be
relied upon in the hurdles. The low
will be an easy race, and while Cowles
may run him in the high the result is
not in doubt. Lanagan and Peaslee
arc fast over the high and should
score. Tn the longer race Gregg
and ITclslcy will give their captain
good support.

Five Intercollegiate events will be decided at the University of Cali
fornia tomorrow. At 8 ;3o on thi Hearst Hall courts the women's tenn/s
teams will meet. The men's tennis matches will be played off on the
California courts beginning at 9. At 11 the second baseball game of the
Intercollegiate series will be called on California Field. The Intercollegi
ate track teams will meet on the California oval tomorrow at 2:30. The
day's events will be brought to a close with the Intercollegiate debate in
Harmon Gymnasium, tomorrow evening at 8.

Even Break in Field.
In the field the points will be more
evenly divided, but the advantage
>till rests with Stanford. Crawford is
consistent in both weights and he
should take the five points in each.
There is a possible place for Ford in
the shot. Vandervoort, Scott, Aynes
worth and Redman are good men in
the broad. Vandervoort's jump of 22
feet. 1 inch, last Saturday gives him
a good chance to take first place to
morrow. Scott is very close to that
mark and should place. Hall's injury
to his ankle may give Sterling the
high-jump, but if the California man
is strong this event must be conceded
to him and the other place should go
to the Blue and Gold. Lanagan is
better in competition than practice
and bis vault Saturday should be
higher than Zoph's. Kocher and
Scott have both done well in practice.

Stanford's relay team is an exception
ally speedy one. McNeil, Elwcll,
Davis and Edwards, will probably
run, and as a fitting climax to the
meet, Macfarland will travel the la>t
relay. Either Coonan or Holman
may be on tbe team. The team will
leave 011 tbe 9:31 train tomorrow, ar
riving in Berkeley about noon. The
men will not be allowed to attend
cither the Intercollegiate baseball or
tennis, but will rest as much as possi
ble during the morning. The meet
will start promptly at 2:30 on the
California track.

twenty tlie outlook is fair. Wearied
by a hard run in the quarter Califor
nia's sprinter must have great reserve
strength if he is to better 23 seconds
and win from the Stanford man. The
quarter will be one of the great races
of tlic day. Roth Edwards and Davis
arc running under the even fifty-two
seconds, and their fight with Stanton
will be one of the spectacles of the
meet. Either Edwards or Stanton
should win with Davis at their heels.
Three Stanford men in the half-mile

should find their way across the finish
line in front of the California entries
Maundrell, Miller, Shelton and Scvery
are unusually high class runners in
the middle distances and their work
will be easy for them.
Nash Should Win Easily.
Stanford is confident of the live
points in the two-mile. Nash has
steadily cut down bis time until he is
dangerously near ten minutes flat and
his race against Dcßemer ought to I>j
won as he pleases. McGregor runs a
heady race and should take the third
place. Captain Macfarland may be
relied upon in the hurdles. The low
will be an easy race, and while Cowles
may run him in the high the result is
not in doubt. Lanagan and Peaslee
arc fast over the high and should
score. Tn the longer race Gregg
and ITclslcy will give their captain
good support.

Five Intercollegiate events will be decided at the University of Cali
fornia tomorrow. At 8 ;3o on thi Hearst Hall courts the women's tenn/s
teams will meet. The men's tennis matches will be played off on the
California courts beginning at 9. At 11 the second baseball game of the
Intercollegiate series will be called on California Field. The Intercollegi
ate track teams will meet on the California oval tomorrow at 2:30. The
day's events will be brought to a close with the Intercollegiate debate in
Harmon Gymnasium, tomorrow evening at 8.

Even Break in Field.
In the field the points will be more
evenly divided, but the advantage
>till rests with Stanford. Crawford is
consistent in both weights and he
should take the five points in each.
There is a possible place for Ford in
the shot. Vandervoort, Scott, Aynes
worth and Redman are good men in
the broad. Vandervoort's jump of 22
feet. 1 inch, last Saturday gives him
a good chance to take first place to
morrow. Scott is very close to that
mark and should place. Hall's injury
to his ankle may give Sterling the
high-jump, but if the California man
is strong this event must be conceded
to him and the other place should go
to the Blue and Gold. Lanagan is
better in competition than practice
and bis vault Saturday should be
higher than Zoph's. Kocher and
Scott have both done well in practice.

Stanford's relay team is an exception
ally speedy one. McNeil, Elwcll,
Davis and Edwards, will probably
run, and as a fitting climax to the
meet, Macfarland will travel the la>t
relay. Either Coonan or Holman
may be on tbe team. The team will
leave 011 tbe 9:31 train tomorrow, ar
riving in Berkeley about noon. The
men will not be allowed to attend
cither the Intercollegiate baseball or
tennis, but will rest as much as possi
ble during the morning. The meet
will start promptly at 2:30 on the
California track.

Stanford sends one of the strong
est track teams in her history to
wear her colors on California's cinder
path and field tomorrow. It is very
doubtful if any Cardinal team has
carried with it the confidence which
goes with Macfarland's men. The
last days of warm, bright weather
have served to round the runners into
their best form, the men 011 the sick
list have their strength back again,
and in the whole squad there is the
determination to wrest a victory from
California.
Captain and Trainer Satisfied.
Captain and Trainer are well satis
fied with the results of their work
and both look forward to Stanford's
third track victory. "I think we'll
win," says Moulton. "I am more
than pleased at the way the men have
worked in good and bad weather.
They deserve victory and I think they
will get it." Macfarland makes a con
servative statement: "A close, hard
meet is expected, but the team has
fight and determination and should
win."
Prospects Good on Track.
Stanford should start the meet
rigbt by taking two places in the
mile. Maundrell and Miller are
stronger than DeMamiel in this event,
and they ought to come to the tape
together with a safe lead. Bradford
has run a game race throughout the
season and DeMamiel will find the
third place disputed all the way by
this runner. Holman's races against
Parsons and Snedigar and his con
sistent improvement warrant the
statement that even if Stanton tries
the hundred lie may find defeat. Reed
and Vandervoort may be relied upon
to take the other point. In the two
