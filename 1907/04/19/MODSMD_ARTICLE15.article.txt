# TENNIS TEAM STRONG
## STANFORD STANDS CHANCE ON COURTS. Blue and Gold Team is Not as Strong as in Past Years.â€”Both Longs Out 
### 
The Stanford tennis team has an
even chance for victory in the Inter
collegiate matches which will be
played on the California courts next
Saturday morning at 9 a. m. The
Cardinal team, composed of P. B.
Delano, '08, A. J. Gowan, '09, and T.
C. Henry, '10, may be relied on to
give their opponents a hard tight.
California's representatives are much
weaker than in the last fe\T years,
while the Stanford men compare very
favorably with those of recent sea
sons. In the early part of the semes
ter the Blue and Gold seemed sure
of a victory with both the Longs to
represent them on the courts. H.
Long, however, has left the Univer
sity, while M. Long is debarred, as he
is a freshman. This leaves Califor
nia with only one Varsity veteran,
C. Wayne, '07. The second place on
the team is being contested for by
R. Gorrill, '08, D. R. Powell, '09, and
C. R. Clinch, '09. The last-named is
the most available candidate.
In the first singles match Wayne
will have a slight lead over Gowan.
The latter is not playing his best
game at present, as only recently ho
had an attack of la grippe. Notwith
standing this, however, he will give
the California man a close fight and
stands a fair chance of winning. Hen
ry has a clear lead over the three can
d:dates for the other place on the
Blue and Gold team. The Freshman
is playing a strong game and should
capture his match with comparative
ease.
In all probability the result of the
doubles will decide the final outcom;
of the matches. The two teams are
very evenly matched and it is a toss
up as to which one will come out
victorious. Gowan and Delano al
ways play well together, and although
neither is in the best of condition
now, they will give a good account
of themselves Saturday.
