# Second Baseball Game In Morning
## 
### 
Owing to sickness and a change in
the rank of the hitters the Varsity
baseball team will present a some
what changed lineup tomorrow mor
ning when they face California in the
second game of the Intercollegiatc
series.
If centerlielder Wirt is able to go
into the game Scott will be put at
second base in place of Cadwalader
and Gore will be shifted to right
field. At any rate Gore will be given
a chance and Scott also retained in
the lineup. The object of the shift is
obvious—to strengthen the batting of
i the Cardinal. Gore has made good
with the stick during the late con
! tests and Scott long ago established
his worth at the bat and on the bases.
Yet another reason for the disposition
' of Cadwalader is the fact that his left
j injured hand is in bad shape and he
: is hampered thereby in hitting as well
' as in fielding.
The battery will remain the same —
i Theile and Stott, as in the opening
; match, with Goodel! and Daily sub
j stituting. Stott too has a bad throw
| ing hand and it was feared for a time
| that he might be unable to go in.
[ Theile has been rested the entire week
and lie should be in form to pitch the
j Varsity to victory once more. Samp
| son, Kenton and Owen will be in
j their old positions and Dudley will be
held in reserve as substitute out
| fielder.
There is nothing which would seem
to dispute the conclusion that the
; nine innings tomorrow morning will
jbe as hotly contested as the first
| game. Both teams have had an op
portunity to measure their opposing
! pitchers and more hitting may be
looked for. Tn stick work the show
ing of the Varsity yesterday was very
I encouraging. There were few strike
outs and the hits came at opportune
moments.
Edwards and Goslinsky will umpire
again tomorrow. The game will be
called at eleven o'clock on California
field.
