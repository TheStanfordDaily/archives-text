The purpose of rallies, editorials,
and the words of coaches arc all tin
sameâ€”to bring out the best in those
actually engaged in competition and
to bring onto the bleachers all those
who do not have a part on the ath
letic field. We have had all of the--.;
but best of all we are represented by
men in whom we have the utmost
confidence and by coache-. of whom
we are proud. It has always been the
pride of our University that her repre
sentatives need no advice or urgency
as to what is expected of them. M >
we have victory from morning till
night tomorrow, may we have the en
tire student body on the California
campus and may we have those evi
dences of sportsmanship in competi
tion and on the bleachers which wr
reflect with a sense of satisfaction
have marked our Intercollegiate rela
tions in the pas,t.
