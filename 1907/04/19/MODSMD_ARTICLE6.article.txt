# MONSTER RALLY HELD
## STUDENTS CHEER FOR SIX TEAMS. Assembly Hall billed By Supporters of Cardinal.â€”Serpentine on Quad. 
### 
As the forty-one members of the
Stanford Var ity track team tiled into
Assembly Hall last evening, members
of the Stanford Student Body sprang
to their feet, cheering and applauding
the men they took their seats.
The deafening noise continued foi
several minutes, ending only when
Yell Leaders Cunha and Kellogg held
up their hands for quiet. Then came
three ringing cheers for the team, fol
lowed by songs and yells of the Car
dinal. Kellogg then called upon Pro
fessor Suzzallo to give the first talk
of the evening at the combined track,
baseball, tennis, debating and chess
rally.
Professor Suzzallo praised the en
thusiasm of the Student Body, justi
fying it on tie grounds of the differ
ence between gymnastics and ath
letics. The human element of strug
gle, absent from gymnastics and pres
ent in athletics, was the attribute
which made the difference, in the
opinion of the peaker.
Captain Macfarland of the track
team made a few pithy remarks con
cerning his men and their trainer.
Said Macfarland: "Dad" Moulton has
got every man in as good condition
as it is possible to get any men. We
are going to Berkeley determined to
win." Six cheers were given for the
track team.
Baseball Captain Presley was called
on. Presley said: "I want to thank
the members of the Student Body for
the support they gave us last Satur
day, and Mr, Lanagan for the work
he has done in teaching the men the
game. If ever a man worked his
heart out for a team he has done so.
We're going up to Berkeley Satur
day determined to win. Tf fight and
determination will do it, we will win."
Tennis Captain Delano was the next
speaker. While not making any pre
dictions for victory, Delano said:
"Every man will do his best to bring
victory to Stanford."
A great demonstration was given
"Dad" Moulton when he was urged to
speak. Moulton's words were praise
for the grit of his men, who he said
had come out and worked hard no
matter what the weather had been.
W. F. TTerron, '08, told of the work
the debaters did. Tn a brilliant con
clusion TTerron characterized the
spirit of the athletic teams as the
fighting spirit which would do its ut
most to win. TTe received an ovation
from the men of the audience.
The Band played at the rally. After

Tnner Quad by the light of red fire.
