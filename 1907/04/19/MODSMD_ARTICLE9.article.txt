# DEBATE IN EVENING
## CARDINAL HAS STRONG TRIO OF SPEAKERS. McColloch, Herron and Ferrell Will Attack Roosevelt's Policy of Centralization. 
### 
The Stanford debating team will
meet the representatives of the Blue
and Gold in Harmon Gymnasium at
eight tomorrow evening to debate the
question, "Resolved, That the Efforts
of President Roosevelt to Extend the
Powers and Functions of the Federal
Government Should not Be Approved
by the American People."
The question is a live one, being
one of the issues between the two
big political parties, and will exceed
in public interest any previous sub
ject for debate. In supporting the
affirmative the Stanford representa
tives will be upholch'ng the unpopular
side of the question, but the Cardinal
team has worked hard and faithfully
in their preparation and the chances
for a victorj' are bright. Two of the
team have been in former Intercolle
giate contests and the third member
has already demonstrated by his work
in the tryouts that he has the quali
fications of a Varsity debater.
W. F. Herron, '08, the veteran of
the team, has been active in debating
since his Freshman year. He was on
the 1908 team in his Sophomore year.
He was a member of both the Inter
collegiate and Carnot teams last year
and won the Carnot medal this year.
He is at present the editor of the
"Sequoia." He registers from Tel
luride, Colorado, in the Law depart
ment. He is a fluent forcible speaker,
logical and analytical in his arguments
and possessing an unusually exten
sive vocabulary.
C. C. McColloch, '08, was a member
of the Carnot team this year and
alternate on last year's Intercollegi
ate. He is managing editor of the
"Daily Palo Alto," registering in Law
from Portland, Oregon. He is a fin
ished speaker, has an easy stage pres
ence and is especially strong in refu
tation.
G. B. Ferrell, '09, was on the win
ning Sophomore team in the inter
class debate this year. He is a Law
major from Decatur, Illinois. He is
a forceful speaker, but his strong
point is overwhelming his opponents
by the presentation of a mass of facts
arranged in a logical sequence of
argument.
California will be represented by S.
McNeil, '08, who was on the Carnot
team this year; N. A. Eisner, '07, the
winner of last year's Carnot medal,
and L. K. Underbill, '09, who like
Ferrell of Stanford, will make his
first appearance on the public plat
form.
The judges have not yet been
chosen, and it is probable that no
selection will be made until tomor
row.
Of the thirteen previous Intercolle
giate debates Stanford has won seven
and California six. On account of
the earthquake no contest was held
last year.
