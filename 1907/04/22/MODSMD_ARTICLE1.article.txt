Three hours of a great struggle,
with the teams still fighting for vic
tory, brought the Cardinal and Blue
and Gold bleachers to their feet for
the final and deciding race of the
meet. Five thousand spectators, a
record-breaking crowd, had seen Stan
ford and California fight on path and
field for the track championship of
Pacific Coast universities. They had
seen game races, the closest of fin
ishes, and the shattering of Intercol
legiate and Coast records. The start
er's gun which sent McNeil and Paul
away in the relay brought pande
monium. The first three runners gave
California an eight foot lead, but Ed
wards outgamed his man and when
his hand touched Macfarland's he was
a yard ahead. It was for the cap
tains to decide the meet and as they
swung off the turn into the back
stretch Wilcox suddenly faltered, hes
itated, and then fell into his stride
again. But his race was lost and
Stanford's captain swept past the si
lent California bleachers and to the
tape alone. Five men never ran a
mile as fast as the Car linal rela *
team ran this race. The time—
minutes 19 1-5 seconds—lowers the
former American record one second.
Lanagan's great vault was a fitting
climax to a great meet. Twelve feet
four inches is within seven-eighths of
an inch of the world's record, and it
breaks the Intercollegiate and Pacific
Coast records. The Cardinal vaulter
has never approached this perform
ance in practice and his work in both
the California and Southern meets
shows that he is most reliable when
points must be had. Beside the relay
and pole vault, four new Intercolle
giate records were created Saturday.
De Mamiel ran a gruelling mile, fin
ishing in the very fast time of 4 min

utes 33 and 2-5 seconds. Morgan's
time of 16 flat in the high hurdles was
bettered by both Cowles and Peaslee,
who ran a fifth of a second under
even time. Hall's ankle proved to be
in very fair condition and he was able
to clear the bar at 6 feet and 1-4 of an
inch, which is slightly better than any
jump 011 the Intercollegiate records.
Nash and De Remer fought out a
great two-mile. The Stanford man
passed his rival on the last lap and
won by nearly forty yards. His time
—10 minutes 10 and 3-5 seconds —is
his best and is 10 2-5 seconds unds.-
the old record.
Startling reversals of form account
for the close score—6s-57. The men
depended upon to take first places in
many cases failed to take any or fin
ished thirds. Predictions went wrong
from the beginning to the end of the
contest. Maundrell was run off his
feet in De MatniePs fast mile and in
the half was jockeyed out of a place.
Holman found 10 2-5 seconds too fast
in the hundred although he has run
inside 10 1-5 consistently. Stanton
took but three points. Defeated by
Davis in the quarter he was unable
to qualify in the two-twenty. Craw
ford found it impossible to stay within
the ring and took no points in the
hammer. Such reversals were no
ticeable in nearly all events and it had
the effect of making the meet de
cidedly uncertain and exciting.
Davis ran a wonderful race in the
quarter and his fast finish in that
event was one of the prettiest features
of the day. Bradford must be given
great credit for his game fight against
De Mamiel and if he had started his
sprint a little later he might have
taken the five points and the record.
In the half Miller found his old
stride. His run through the big field
was a heady piece of work and the
finish had all of his former speed.
Gregg and Helsley are fast low hur
dlers and they both will be valuable
men in the years to come. S"ott,
Vandervoort, and Aynesworth, who
shut out the. California entries in the
broad should repeat their performance
next year. Scott's jump is remark
able when the injury which he re
ceived in the ball game is considered,
and he will be remembered as one of
the gamest athletes in the meet.
Worthington ran his race in the two
mile, and Poor cleared the bar far
above any of his practice marks. Reed
pressed Johns all the way in the two
twenty and next year should beat his
record.
It was Track Captain Macfarland
who won his own meet. Not only did
he take the greatest numbe) of points,
but he won the relay whet the relay

points were necessary to bring home
the victory. The summary follows:
100-yard dash—Kleeburger (C) and
Crossfield (C) tied for first; Holman
(S), third. Time 10 2-5.
220-yard dash—Won by Johns (C),

Three hours of a great struggle,
with the teams still fighting for vic
tory, brought the Cardinal and Blue
and Gold bleachers to their feet for
the final and deciding race of the
meet. Five thousand spectators, a
record-breaking crowd, had seen Stan
ford and California fight on path and
field for the track championship of
Pacific Coast universities. They had
seen game races, the closest of fin
ishes, and the shattering of Intercol
legiate and Coast records. The start
er's gun which sent McNeil and Paul
away in the relay brought pande
monium. The first three runners gave
California an eight foot lead, but Ed
wards outgamed his man and when
his hand touched Macfarland's he was
a yard ahead. It was for the cap
tains to decide the meet and as they
swung off the turn into the back
stretch Wilcox suddenly faltered, hes
itated, and then fell into his stride
again. But his race was lost and
Stanford's captain swept past the si
lent California bleachers and to the
tape alone. Five men never ran a
mile as fast as the Car linal rela *
team ran this race. The time—
minutes 19 1-5 seconds—lowers the
former American record one second.
Lanagan's great vault was a fitting
climax to a great meet. Twelve feet
four inches is within seven-eighths of
an inch of the world's record, and it
breaks the Intercollegiate and Pacific
Coast records. The Cardinal vaulter
has never approached this perform
ance in practice and his work in both
the California and Southern meets
shows that he is most reliable when
points must be had. Beside the relay
and pole vault, four new Intercolle
giate records were created Saturday.
De Mamiel ran a gruelling mile, fin
ishing in the very fast time of 4 min

utes 33 and 2-5 seconds. Morgan's
time of 16 flat in the high hurdles was
bettered by both Cowles and Peaslee,
who ran a fifth of a second under
even time. Hall's ankle proved to be
in very fair condition and he was able
to clear the bar at 6 feet and 1-4 of an
inch, which is slightly better than any
jump 011 the Intercollegiate records.
Nash and De Remer fought out a
great two-mile. The Stanford man
passed his rival on the last lap and
won by nearly forty yards. His time
—10 minutes 10 and 3-5 seconds —is
his best and is 10 2-5 seconds unds.-
the old record.
Startling reversals of form account
for the close score—6s-57. The men
depended upon to take first places in
many cases failed to take any or fin
ished thirds. Predictions went wrong
from the beginning to the end of the
contest. Maundrell was run off his
feet in De MatniePs fast mile and in
the half was jockeyed out of a place.
Holman found 10 2-5 seconds too fast
in the hundred although he has run
inside 10 1-5 consistently. Stanton
took but three points. Defeated by
Davis in the quarter he was unable
to qualify in the two-twenty. Craw
ford found it impossible to stay within
the ring and took no points in the
hammer. Such reversals were no
ticeable in nearly all events and it had
the effect of making the meet de
cidedly uncertain and exciting.
Davis ran a wonderful race in the
quarter and his fast finish in that
event was one of the prettiest features
of the day. Bradford must be given
great credit for his game fight against
De Mamiel and if he had started his
sprint a little later he might have
taken the five points and the record.
In the half Miller found his old
stride. His run through the big field
was a heady piece of work and the
finish had all of his former speed.
Gregg and Helsley are fast low hur
dlers and they both will be valuable
men in the years to come. S"ott,
Vandervoort, and Aynesworth, who
shut out the. California entries in the
broad should repeat their performance
next year. Scott's jump is remark
able when the injury which he re
ceived in the ball game is considered,
and he will be remembered as one of
the gamest athletes in the meet.
Worthington ran his race in the two
mile, and Poor cleared the bar far
above any of his practice marks. Reed
pressed Johns all the way in the two
twenty and next year should beat his
record.
It was Track Captain Macfarland
who won his own meet. Not only did
he take the greatest numbe) of points,
but he won the relay whet the relay

points were necessary to bring home
the victory. The summary follows:
100-yard dash—Kleeburger (C) and
Crossfield (C) tied for first; Holman
(S), third. Time 10 2-5.
220-yard dash—Won by Johns (C),
Reed (S), second; Holman (S), third.
Time 22 4-5.

Three hours of a great struggle,
with the teams still fighting for vic
tory, brought the Cardinal and Blue
and Gold bleachers to their feet for
the final and deciding race of the
meet. Five thousand spectators, a
record-breaking crowd, had seen Stan
ford and California fight on path and
field for the track championship of
Pacific Coast universities. They had
seen game races, the closest of fin
ishes, and the shattering of Intercol
legiate and Coast records. The start
er's gun which sent McNeil and Paul
away in the relay brought pande
monium. The first three runners gave
California an eight foot lead, but Ed
wards outgamed his man and when
his hand touched Macfarland's he was
a yard ahead. It was for the cap
tains to decide the meet and as they
swung off the turn into the back
stretch Wilcox suddenly faltered, hes
itated, and then fell into his stride
again. But his race was lost and
Stanford's captain swept past the si
lent California bleachers and to the
tape alone. Five men never ran a
mile as fast as the Car linal rela *
team ran this race. The time—
minutes 19 1-5 seconds—lowers the
former American record one second.
Lanagan's great vault was a fitting
climax to a great meet. Twelve feet
four inches is within seven-eighths of
an inch of the world's record, and it
breaks the Intercollegiate and Pacific
Coast records. The Cardinal vaulter
has never approached this perform
ance in practice and his work in both
the California and Southern meets
shows that he is most reliable when
points must be had. Beside the relay
and pole vault, four new Intercolle
giate records were created Saturday.
De Mamiel ran a gruelling mile, fin
ishing in the very fast time of 4 min

utes 33 and 2-5 seconds. Morgan's
time of 16 flat in the high hurdles was
bettered by both Cowles and Peaslee,
who ran a fifth of a second under
even time. Hall's ankle proved to be
in very fair condition and he was able
to clear the bar at 6 feet and 1-4 of an
inch, which is slightly better than any
jump 011 the Intercollegiate records.
Nash and De Remer fought out a
great two-mile. The Stanford man
passed his rival on the last lap and
won by nearly forty yards. His time
—10 minutes 10 and 3-5 seconds —is
his best and is 10 2-5 seconds unds.-
the old record.
Startling reversals of form account
for the close score—6s-57. The men
depended upon to take first places in
many cases failed to take any or fin
ished thirds. Predictions went wrong
from the beginning to the end of the
contest. Maundrell was run off his
feet in De MatniePs fast mile and in
the half was jockeyed out of a place.
Holman found 10 2-5 seconds too fast
in the hundred although he has run
inside 10 1-5 consistently. Stanton
took but three points. Defeated by
Davis in the quarter he was unable
to qualify in the two-twenty. Craw
ford found it impossible to stay within
the ring and took no points in the
hammer. Such reversals were no
ticeable in nearly all events and it had
the effect of making the meet de
cidedly uncertain and exciting.
Davis ran a wonderful race in the
quarter and his fast finish in that
event was one of the prettiest features
of the day. Bradford must be given
great credit for his game fight against
De Mamiel and if he had started his
sprint a little later he might have
taken the five points and the record.
In the half Miller found his old
stride. His run through the big field
was a heady piece of work and the
finish had all of his former speed.
Gregg and Helsley are fast low hur
dlers and they both will be valuable
men in the years to come. S"ott,
Vandervoort, and Aynesworth, who
shut out the. California entries in the
broad should repeat their performance
next year. Scott's jump is remark
able when the injury which he re
ceived in the ball game is considered,
and he will be remembered as one of
the gamest athletes in the meet.
Worthington ran his race in the two
mile, and Poor cleared the bar far
above any of his practice marks. Reed
pressed Johns all the way in the two
twenty and next year should beat his
record.
It was Track Captain Macfarland
who won his own meet. Not only did
he take the greatest numbe) of points,
but he won the relay whet the relay

points were necessary to bring home
the victory. The summary follows:
