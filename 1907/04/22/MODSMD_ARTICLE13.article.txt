# DEBATING TEAM LOSES
## CALIFORNIA GIVEN UNANIMOUS DECISION. Failure to Argue on Question is Responsible for Defeat of Cardinal. 
### 
By unanimous vote of the judges
the decision was awarded to the Cali
fornia team in the annual Intercolle
giate debate held before a large audi
ence in Harmon Gymnasium Saturday
evening.
The winning team defended the
negative of the subject, "Resolved,
That the Efforts of President Roose
velt to Extend the Powers and Func
tions of the Federal Government
Should not be Approved by the Amer
ican People." They argued that what
Roosevelt sought in getting more
power for the executive branch was
merely a transferring of power within
the Federal government and not an
extension of power.
The strong points of the negative
were in their argument that extension
of Federal power does not necessarily
detract from the power of the state,
and the clever way in which they put
the affirmative on the defensive by an
analysis of the specific measures urged
by Roosevelt, showing that part were
not an extension of federal power and
that the others deserved the approval
of the American people 011 their merit.
The Stanford men argued that
Roosevelt's methods were unconstitu
tional, his measures unnecessary, un
wise and inexpedient. They pointed
out that an extension of Federal
power was a step toward paternalism
and would ultimately lead to the ob
literation of state lines. The Stan
ford team were individually superior
to their opponents in delivery, stage
presence and those qualities which go
to make a good speaker, but they
showed the lack of team-work and
careful preparation which was evinced
in tlie speeches of the Californians.
The Cardinal speakers gave the ad
vantage to their opponents by not
assuming the burden of proof and in
dealing in generalities without con
crete examples to prove their point.
In speaking of the debate this mor
ning, Professor C. A. Duniway, of the
History department, said, "Argument
atively speaking, it was the poorest
showing made by the Stanford Inter
collegiate Debating Team in the last
ten years."
The contest was judged by Judge*
Hall and Cooper of San Francisco,
and Professor McCurda. Professor
C. M. Gayley, of the University of
California, presided at the meeting.
Stanford was represented by C. C.
McColloch, '08, W. F. Herron, '08, and
G. D. Ferrell, '09, while N. A. Eisner,
'07, S. McNeil, '08, and L. K. Under- |
hill, '09, spoke for California.
