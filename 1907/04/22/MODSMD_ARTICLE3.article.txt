# LOSES SECOND GAME
## CARDINAL SHUT OUT BY CALIFORNIA. Jordan Pitches Great Ball and Blue and Gold Wins by a Score of 3 to 0. 
### 
The University of California sent
three men across the home base in
the second game of the Intercollegi
ate series on California field Saturday
morning while Stanford was unable
to tally. An opportune home run by
Schaeffer in the second inning gave
California two runs and three more
hits in a row in the fifth added the
other. The Cardinal had their op
portunity at the outset of the match
but with the bases filled neither Gore
or Sampson were able to hit safely.
The victor}' was a clean cut one
and there are no excuses to be offered.
Jordan pitched a magnificent game
for the Blue and Gold and was at his
best in the tight places. A single hi l
by Scott in the third inning was the
best that Stanford could do with his
delivery.
Sampson and Stott starred in the
infield and Gore's well judged whip
to the plate in the fifth inning cut off
a California tally. After being
knocked unconscious by a ball from
Jordan's hands, Scott who was played
at second in place of Cadwalader, grit
tily went back into the game and
covered his territory in perfect style
The final game will be played next
Saturday morning The place has
not yet been determined but probablv
some diamond in San Francisco will
be secured.
