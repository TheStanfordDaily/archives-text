The two victories won by the Car
dinal 011 Saturday give the greatest
possible satisfaction to the Studen*
Body. The track men did all tha'
was asked or expected of them, am!
their success more than removes the
sting of Stanford's yielding in the
track controversy. Trainer Moulton.
Captain Macfarland and every man
who carried the Cardinal on the Cali
fornia Oval Saturday deserves the
highest praise of the Student Body.
The breaking of the long series of
tennis defeats is another source of sat
isfaction. The baseball team has not
lost the confidence of the Studen.
Body because of its defeat, for the
Cardinal still stands even on the serie
witli another chance for victory. All
the teams which competed Saturday
won or lost, fairly and squarely an.l
Stanford has no cause to be ashamed
of the outcome of the day.
