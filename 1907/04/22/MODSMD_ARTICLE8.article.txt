# TENNIS PLAYERS WIN
## STANFORD BREAKS RECORD OF DEFEATS. Cardinal Wins One Singles Match and Doubles Contest.â€”Gowan Loses to Wayne. 
### 
As a fitting prelude to the track
and field victory in the afternoon
came Stanford's success in tennis Sat
urday morning. To P. B. Delano,
'oS, and T. C. Henry, '10, belongs the
credit for breaking California's long
winning streak on the courts. Each
team captured one of the singles
matches, while the doubles went to
the Cardinal. Wayne fought hard for
the Blue and Gold, but even his bril
liant work could not offset the medi
ocrity of the other California rackei
wielders. Captain Delano proved
himself wonderfully steady, and Hen
ry showed that lie could be relied on
to put up a strong game in a crisis.
A. J. Gowan, '09, was handicapped by
an injured ankle and could take part
only in the singles, forcing Delano
and Henry to play together in the
doubles. Although the tennis was
not as high class as usual, the close
ness of the sets rendered them ex
tremely interesting.
The matches began inauspiciously j
for the Cardinal when Wayne easily ]
took Gowan's measure in straight
sets, 6-4, 6-0. Gowan was still suffer
ing from his turned ankle which had
incapacitated him for the greater part
of the week. The loss of practice
caused by this made Gowan a far
less formidable opponent than he
would ordinarily have been.
Henry evened matters by beating
Powell in two hard-fought sets, 7-5.
8-6. As the score indicates the match
was very close. Every point was con
tested, and Henry's superior steadi
ness finally won out for him. Dur
ing the greater part of the match it
was a case of each man winning his
service. Henry smashed well at
times, but the excessive caution of
both players robbed the match of
much interest from the spectator's
point of view.
With the score standing one match
all, great interest was centered on the
doubles. Delano and Henry were
pitted against Wayne and Clinch.
The weakness of Clinch lost for Cali
fornia and won for the Cardinal. The
Stanford men soon discovered this
vulnerable spot, and accordingly
Clinch was called upon to do most of
the playing. His showing was
wretched. Delano and Henry played
a careful lobbing game and finally
won out, 0-7, 5-7, 6-2.
