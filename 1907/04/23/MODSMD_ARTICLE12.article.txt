The removal of the editor of the
"Sequoia" from his position by the
Student Affairs Committee should
give no cause for an hysterical out
burst on the part of the Student Body,
stirred up by the old cry that Faculty
interference is destroying our liberty.
The case at it.sue is not in any way
analagous to the expulsion of Allen
a year ago. Allen was expelled for
voicing what he believed to be the
opinion of the majority of the Stu
dent Body in regard to a certain, spe
cific policy inaugurated by the Stu
dent Affairs Committee. He fought
that policy and represented the oppo
sition to it. In the present instance
Herron is accused of no specific of
fense. The only charge made against
him is that his editorial policy has
not been for the best interests of the
University as a whole, and it is on
that charge that he was removed from
office. It is merely a case of Her
ron's individual ideas of his own ed
itorial policy as opposed to the ideas
of the Committee upon this subject.
Opinion is so divided even among
the Student Body upon this point that
any attempt to arouse an agitation
over Herron's removal would un
doubtedly result in failure. Much as
we may regret the necessity for Fac
ulty interference in affairs of this
kind, there are many in the Student
Body who will agree with the Com
mittee in their opinion of Herron's
policy. Those who support that pol
icy will regret the editor's removal
under the present circumstances.

Whatever Ilerron's shortcomings may
have been, his worst enemies cannot
but admit that he has made a strong
and in many ways an efficient editor.
He has not been afraid to express
what he thought and to stand by his
opinions when he expressed them.
He has made the "Sequoia" a vital
force in Stanford journalism and his
removal is a distinct loss in many
ways.
