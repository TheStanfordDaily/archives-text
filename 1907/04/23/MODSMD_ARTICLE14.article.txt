# AN ANTI-GRAFT MOVEMENT
## Professor Boke Calls Meeting of Law Men to Form League Interested in Civic Reform. 
### 
Professor George H. Boke, of the
department of Jurisprudence in the
University #of California, will en
deavor to organize an anti-graft
league at Stanford, at a meeting to
be held on Thursday at 1:15, in room
2, of the Law building.
Professor Boke has successfully
formed such an organization at Cali
fornia, and his object is to assist in
the stamping out of graft in the
United States. The movement was
first set on foot when Francis J.
Hency spoke at a university meeting
at California when he declared that
grafters flourished because only a few
voters interested themselves in the
business of the municipality, and the
vast majority was ignorant of what
was taking place.
Professor Boke, who lectures on
Property here, spent the last ten
minutes of his lecture this morning
in discussing the present graft in San
Francisco.
At Boke's suggestion, a number of
students in Eastern colleges are lay
ing the foundation for an intercolle
giate league, to be used as a weapon
against municipal graft and all other
sorts of graft.
All law students and others inter
ested in the movement are requested
to be present at the meeting.
