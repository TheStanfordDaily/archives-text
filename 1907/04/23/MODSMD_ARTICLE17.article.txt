of San Francisco, will speak. The
Assembly tomorrow morning will be
under the auspices of the Faculty
Committee.
Francis J. Heney, Assistant District
Attorney of San Francisco, the well
known graft prosecutor, will speak at
a special Assembly Thursday mor
ning at 11:15. Owing to pressing
business Heney was allowed to make
his own date to speak here. This
causes the two Assemblies to be held
so near each other. Heney will speak
011 graft as it exists in San Francisco,
and is expected to give the students
an array of facts that cannot be
gleaned from the public press. The
graft prosecutor will speak under the
auspices of the Social Service Club.
In the evening Heney will be given
a reception at the Sigma Alpha Ep
silon house, and will again give a
short address to those present. Heney
will be the last speaker whom the
Social Service Club has asked to
speak in Assembly.
