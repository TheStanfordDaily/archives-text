# HERRON REMOVED FROM OFFICE
## Student Affairs Committee Takes Action This Morning And Declares Editorship of "Sequoia" Vacant. 
### 
"At a special meeting of the Com
mittee on Student Affairs a student
editor of a University periodical, for
conduct of such periodical subversive,
in the opinion of the Committee, of
the best interests of the Student Body
and the University as a whole, was
removed from the editorship of such
periodical and his position declared
vacant.
W. F. Durand,
Chairman of the Committee on Stu
dent Affairs."
The Faculty Committee 011 Student
Affairs took summary action this mor
ning in the case of W. F. Herron, '08,
and removed him from his position
as editor of the "Sequoia." Announce
ment of the Committee's action was
made public in the brief from Profes
sor Durand quoted above.
Herron's removal came as the re
sult of a three-hour session of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
the deposed editor held yesterday af
ternoon. Herron was cross examined
closely as to his views on University
journalism and the condtict and pol
icy of student publications. At the.
conclusion of this meeting no an
nouncement was made to Herron re
garding the action of the Commit
tee but he was requested to appear
again this morning and at that time
was informed that the Committee had
declared the editorship of the "Se
quoia" vacant.
In the statement given out by Dr.
Durand no definite charges are made
against Herron and his whole edito
rial attitude is assigned as the cause
for his removal. The Committee
makes it plain that its action is not
the result of any specified editorial
or article written by Herron, but that
his removal is made solely because
the Committee believes that his whole
policy and attitude are opposed to the
best interests of the Student Bod>
and the University as a whole. It is
impossible to gather from the public
statement made in what way Herron's
policy is considered to have been pre
judicial.
The action of the Student Affairs
Committee comes as a climax to Her
ron's stormy tenure of office. When
Bickel resigned the editorship of tht;
"Sequoia" last January, Herron, who
had been a leading member of the
staff and a prominent contributor, was
appointed by the Executive Commit
tee as editor pro tem. Later a Stu
dent Body election was held and Her
ron was unanimously chosen to suc
ceed Bickel. The new editor followed
out the policy of his predecessor in
running more articles of timely in
terest and of a slightly sensational
tinge. His editorials were strong and
many of them criticised freely the ac
tions of the Faculty and of certain
Student Body organizations. Ab
bott's resignation, the question of
attitude of the Faculty on the ques

lighting University Avenue, and the
tion of Intercollegiate athletics, werÂ«
freely and caustically commented up
on.
In addition to his criticisms of the
Faculty, Herron roused the wrath of
the women of the University by ed
itorial attacks and by articles which
appeared in the columns of the "Se
quoia." The "Love Letters of a Cc
cd,'' which the women contended
were gross misrepresentations of the
character of the Stanford women
were the greatest grievances, and
when it was announced that a poem
entitled "Bathsheba," founded 011 the
Biblical narrative of the sin of David
would appear in the April "Sequoia,"
the women boycotted the magazine
and refused to buy it. The result was
the largest sale in the history of the
periodical, and a great deal of ex
ploiting of the incident in the metro
politan press. All this agitation
seems to have resulted in the action
which was taken by the Committee,
this morning.
Herron will hand in his resignation
to the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students at their regular
meeting on Wednesday evening, and
an editor pro tem. will probably be
appointed at that time to take charge
of the May issue of the periodical. E.
N. Smith, '08, who is the only nom
inee for the editorship next year, will
probably succeed Herron for the bal
ance of the semester.
Herron made no public statement
today concerning his removal. "I
prefer to make my defense of my
policy in the resignation which I shall
hand in to the Executive Committee
011 Wednesday night. I have nothing
to add to the statement made by the
Student Affairs Committee in regard
to my removal," was all the deposed
editor would say.
Professor Durand was in San Fran
cisco this afternoon and it was impos
sible to see him in regard to the case.
The other members of the Committee,
however, say that there is nothing to
add to the statement given out this
morning.
The members of the Student Af
fairs Committee are Professors W. F.
Durand, A. G. Newcomer, B. O. Fos
ter, E. D. Adams, and V. L. Kellogg.
