# Final Game in San Francisco.
## 
### 
The final game of the Intercolle
giate baseball series will be played
Saturday morning on the Coast
League grounds at Fourteenth and
Valencia Streets, San Francisco. The
game will be called shortly after 10
o'clock so that those who wish to go
to the regatta will be able to leave
San Francisco in time for the start.
Manager Sales was not able to ar
range a game with Santa Clara for
tomorrow but he will endeavor to get
a game with St. Mary's or Pensacola
for some day this week.
