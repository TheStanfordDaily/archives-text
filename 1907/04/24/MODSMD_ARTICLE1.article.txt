# ADDRESS ON OXFORD
## PROFESSOR STEPHENS TALKS OF ENGLISH UNIVERSITY. Rudolph J. Taussig Reads Interesting Paper on Trade Schools of San Francisco. 
### 
"Features of Oxford Life" and
"Trade Schools" were the subjects
chosen by two speakers of note in As
sembly this morning. J. Morse Step
hens of the University of California,
in speaking of life in Oxford, drew
interesting comparisons between
American universities, with their
bustle and aggressive methods, and
the classic life under the shades of the
old English university.
According to the speaker the less
interference with English universities
shown on the part of American col
lege men the better the Englishmen
would appreciate it."The attractions
at Oxford," said Professor Stephens,
"are of long standing and no influence
exerted on the part of Americans with
their new ideas can change the cus
toms of that institution."
In speaking of the classics as op
posed to the scientific work of univer
sities on each side of the Atlantic he
said that as far as Oxford was con
cerned it never did and never would
bother with scientific studies. "When
our undergraduates wish to enter en
gineering or professional courses they
leave the university," he said, "and
go to London where they enter
schools endowed for that purpose."
In speaking of the Rhodes scholar
ships the speaker said it was not for
the purpose of educating Americans
that the scholarships were instituted,
but because it was the idea of Cecil
Rhodes to educate Englishmen in the
spirit of federation of which America
is the world's exponent.
So opposite are the ideas and ideals
of English institutions of learning to
those of ours that Professor Stephens'
address was made highly interesting.
Rudolph J. Taussig, a leading figure
and trustee in trade schools of San
Francisco, read an interesting article
on the aims of such schools as thev
now exist, and the part they play in
the lives of mechanics. The speaker
spoke at considerable length on the
policy of trade unions toward such
schools, and the inconsistencies of
some labor organizations in their ar
guments against the establishment ot
such schools.
"Such schools," said Taussig, "do
not confine themselves to the mechan
ical studies but also pay some atten
tion to culture. In this way the stu
dents when they graduate are a power
in the trade which they enter."
