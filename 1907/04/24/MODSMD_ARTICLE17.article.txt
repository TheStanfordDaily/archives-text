# RESIGNS HIS OFFICE
## HERRON WRITES LETTER TO COMMITTEE. Supports His Policy and Believes That Time Will Vindicate His Attitude. 
### 
W. F. Herron, '08, presented his
resignation to the Executive Commit
tee tonight in the following letter:
To the Executive Committee of the
Stanford Student Body:
Acting under orders from the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, I respectfully
tender my resignation as editor of
the "Sequoia." In resigning this po
sition I wish to thank the Student
Body for the privilege which they con
ferred upon me of editing one of their
publications for the major portion
of a semester. While I regret the
necessity of relinquishing my duties
at the present time and before the
expiration of the term for which I was
elected, I quit the position without
the slightest ill will or animosity to
ward anyone. Even those who have
conducted the opposition to me in an
intemperate and vindictive manner,
have nothing but my very best wishes,
and I give them credit for the ut
most sincerity and good intentions, al
though I think that their opposition
was based on a misapprehension.
Toward the Student Affairs Com
mittee I have nothing but the very
best of feelings. I believe that they
earnestly endeavored to work for
what they thought the best interests
of the University demanded. But I
also think that they made the mistake
of taking their action at a time when
on account of the opposition to me
by various factions of the Student
Body, their action presented the ap
pearance of taking sides in a contro
versy between my antagonists and
myself. I believe in addition that
they were mistaken in their belief
that my policy was subversive of the
best interests of the University.
Throughout my term of office I have
endeavored to fulfill my duties to the
best of my ability, and to make the
magazine that I edited a publication
that represented the best thought and
sentiment among Stanford men and
women. If I have made mistakes, I
sincerely regret them, but I believe
that I have no cause to regret my
general policy. I have made the "Se
quoia" a live, progressive and fearless
publication, and I hand it down to my
successor, free from debt and on a
sound financial basis. The wisdom of
many of the measures which I have
advocated will, I think, become ap
parent when the angry contention
which they have aroused has subsided.
W. F. Herron.
