# Executive Committee to Meet.
## 
### 
Editor Herron's resignation will
probably be acted on at the regular
weekly meeting of the Executive
Committee tonight. The granting of
Varsity emblems to the men who won
points in the Intercollegiate track
meet last Saturday and to the men
who have won their S this season
in baseball will also probably be acted
upon.
