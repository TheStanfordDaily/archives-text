Since Stanford's v'ctory in the track
meet Saturday, there has been more
or less of the"three classes against
four" argument. The"Daily Califor
nian" says that "it would be nothing
short of a miracle to defeat the Stan
ford track team with three classes."
Aside from the fact that faculty re
strictions go far toward evening up
this seeming inequality, there is a
simple answer to California's conten
tion. The Blue and Gold has always
had almost three times as many men
in her student body as the Cardinal
and has drawn her teams from this
larger number. Before the number or
entries in each event was limited the
California runners invariably crowded
Stanford off the track by sheer weight
of numbers, and even in the meet this
year the State University entries out
numbered the wearers of the Cardinal
by almost twenty competitors. If
California seeks to explain her defea;
this year on a numerical basis, shc
cannot consistently have much cause
to boast of her long line of victories
in the past.
