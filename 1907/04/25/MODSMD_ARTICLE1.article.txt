# HENEY SCORES GRAFT
## ATTACKS PRESENT CONDITION IN THIS COUNTRY. Prosecutor of San Francisco Corruptionists Delivers Strong Address at Assembly This Morning. 
### 
I" rancis J. Heney delivered a blow
from the shoulder against all forms
of political graft in Assembly Hall
this morning, when he held the at
tention of the students for nearly an
hour while telling of corruption in
national and municipal affairs. Ac
cording to Heney the United States
has the best form of government in
the world, but as with other govern
ments, it is likely to fall unless a
stronger moral fiber than now exists
can be made to grow in the minds of
its citizens.
"The United States is now 011 trial
before the world as to this form of
government," he said, "and it rests
with you, young gentlemen, to main
tain such a form of government for
the benefit of mankind. You will find
advancement easier by falling in with
the powers that be, powers that are
debauching our country. But as
eternal vigilance is the price of lib
erty so you will need more moral
stubborness to uphold such liberty.
We seem to think that we are made
of better stuff than the rest of the
people in the world, but an English
man is far stronger in fighting for his
individual liberty than an American."
Heney then touched on the main
subject of his address and told how a
certain business firm in San Fran
cisco, because of interference from
the Board of Health, had been advised
by a lawyer of integrity to see the
"doctor" (Ruef) in order to obtain
protection.
The cause of graft emanates from
two sources according to Heney. The
first from the vicious and criminal
class, and the second from the class
that is met with in the best clubs.
He cited the Pacific Union and Bo
hemian Clubs as examples. From the
latter class are the directors and
presidents of corporations.
"We often hear that the director
of a corporation is justified in giv
ing a bribe to secure reasonable
rates," said he. "If we admit this it
is the end of the Republic, and we
may as well abandon what our fore
fathers worked so hard to establish."
ITcncy brought his address to an
end by giving a short synopsis of the
Oregon Land Fraud cases, and ex
horting the students of the University
to go info the world with a determin
ation to fight on the side of right
against the side of wrong.
After the address an impromptu
rally was .held for the Varsity crew
and the baseball team.
