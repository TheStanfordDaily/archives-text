The amendment to the Student
Body constitution which provides that
no one shall be allowed to vote whose
Student Body assessment has not
been paid, justified its adoption at the
general election yesterday. It is in
teresting to know that there are fifty
members of the Stanford Student
Body, who pay their dollar not be
cause they are Stanford men and wo
men who are doing something for
their University, but in order to pur
chase the right to vote. It L
more interesting to know the names
of those who value their franchise
more than the v lfare of Stanford.
Next year the will be
slightly higher, but it will take only
a glance at the poll list of yesterday's
election to rccognize the individuals
who will follow up the policy of non
payment.
