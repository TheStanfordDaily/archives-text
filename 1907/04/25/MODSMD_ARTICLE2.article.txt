Coach Murphy after taking his men
out for the last hard row yesterday
afternoon expressed himself as be
ing more than satisfied with the gen
eral condition of both the Varsity
and the Freshman crews. According
to the coach the men are now in per
fect condition to put up the hardest
kind of a fight and the crew which
expects to pass them will have to
cover the course in the fastest kind 01
time.
The Varsity crew picked by Mur
phy represents the very best of the
rowing material in college and thj
men have all trained consistently and
hard and have swung into the style
of Murphy's stroke, which has carried
many crews to victory in the past.
F. Zimmerman, '07, captain of the
Varsity is the most experienced man
in the boat. He has had the benefit
of two years training under Murphy
and is a strong representative of the
latter's style of rowing. Zimmerman
pulls number 4 in the boat where he
is in a good position to watch his men
and encourage them during the race.
He has succevded admirably in keep
ing his men together during the sea
son and the crew have every confi
dence in him.
W. H. Stark, '09, who will pull the
bow oar, was sub on the Freshman
crew last year and made a strong
fight for a place at that time. His
work this year has steadily improved
and he wins his place on the Varsity
through hard, consistent work dur
ing the entire season.
A. B. Shutts, '09, number 2, stroked
his Freshman crew last year, and was
perhaps the best man in the boat.
He is the lightest man in the Varsity
crew, but he is reliable owing to his
steadiness and good head work in a
race.
A. N. Cole, '08, who will pull num
ber 3, occupied the bow position and
was captain of the 1908 crew. He has
rowed for the last three years, and
this year has showed great improve
ment over his work of former years.
He is a faithful worker and a hard
fighter.
J. C. Huston, 'to, is the only Fresh
man 011 the crew. This is his first
year at rowing, but he shows good

form and in the position of number 5
will be a tower of strength as he is |
one of the largest men in the boat.
L. R. Gay, '08, who pulls number 6
is another member of the 1908 crew. I
He is one of the steadiest men in the
boat and is the hardest kind of a
worker, and is especially valuable in
a close race, where hard and fast work
is a necessity. He was a member of
last year's Varsity four.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, rowed for the
first time last year, but he has done
considerable work under Murphy and
in company with Zimmerman he
pulled in the Portland Rowing Club's
crew which defeated the best crews
in America last summer. He is the
heaviest man in the boat and one of
the most consistent workers. He will
pull number 7 on Saturday.
R. H. Conant, '08, who will stroke
the crew pulled number 2 in the 1908
crew and was a member of last year's
Varsity. He is one of the best stroke
men Murphy has ever trained, and
the coach and men have perfect con
fidence in his ability to follow or lead
any crew. He has all the essentials
of a good stroke and is able to raise
the stroke to any required number 1
providing be has the crew back of
him. There is no limit to his speed, !
but Murphy has seldom called on the j
crew to do better than 36 to the min
ute at which speed the men seem to j
do tlie best work.
P. W. Turner, '08, who will steer I
the Varsity, has been a coxswain
since his Freshman year, having held
the ropes for both the Freshman and
Varsity crews during the first year. :
Tt would be hard to get a more com- |
pctent man for the position he holds j
or one who knows more about the 1
rowing game. He can be absolutely
depended upon to maintain his rights 1
and steer a correct course in a race.
The Freshman crew is in perfect j
condition, and although a first year 1
crew is always more or less of .1
doubtful quantity in a race, the men
picked by Murphy should give a good
account of themselves.
C. IT. Vose, who will pull bow, was
one of the first men picked for the
crew, owing to his faithfulness and
the fact that he is not afraid of hard
work. R. S. Reynolds, number 2,
up to a few days ago was pulling
stroke, but at the last moment was
changed to his present position. He
has a tendency to shoot his slide but
offsets this slight fault in power and
endurance.
F. L. Wilde, who will pull num
ber 3 is the largest man in the boat,
being over six feet tall. His long
reach gives him a great advantage
and he is able to hold his stroke down
in good shape. J. W. Fitting, stroke,
has been training with the Varsity
during the season. He is a fighter
from the start and would probably
have made the other crew had it not
been necessary to putin a strong
stroke with the Freshmen to com
plete the crew. J. W. Roberts will
hold the tiller ropes and although this
will be his first experience he has
shown up dur'ng the season as being
a heady man.
The following officials will officiate
at the regatta:
Professor W. F. Durand, referee;
Vanderlyn Stow and Carlton Wall,
judges of the finish; Professor Magee
of the University of California, start
er; W. 0. Morrow of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, clerk of course, and
Colonel Edwards and Dr. F. Angell,
timers.

Coach Murphy after taking his men
out for the last hard row yesterday
afternoon expressed himself as be
ing more than satisfied with the gen
eral condition of both the Varsity
and the Freshman crews. According
to the coach the men are now in per
fect condition to put up the hardest
kind of a fight and the crew which
expects to pass them will have to
cover the course in the fastest kind 01
time.
The Varsity crew picked by Mur
phy represents the very best of the
rowing material in college and thj
men have all trained consistently and
hard and have swung into the style
of Murphy's stroke, which has carried
many crews to victory in the past.
F. Zimmerman, '07, captain of the
Varsity is the most experienced man
in the boat. He has had the benefit
of two years training under Murphy
and is a strong representative of the
latter's style of rowing. Zimmerman
pulls number 4 in the boat where he
is in a good position to watch his men
and encourage them during the race.
He has succevded admirably in keep
ing his men together during the sea
son and the crew have every confi
dence in him.
W. H. Stark, '09, who will pull the
bow oar, was sub on the Freshman
crew last year and made a strong
fight for a place at that time. His
work this year has steadily improved
and he wins his place on the Varsity
through hard, consistent work dur
ing the entire season.
A. B. Shutts, '09, number 2, stroked
his Freshman crew last year, and was
perhaps the best man in the boat.
He is the lightest man in the Varsity
crew, but he is reliable owing to his
steadiness and good head work in a
race.
A. N. Cole, '08, who will pull num
ber 3, occupied the bow position and
was captain of the 1908 crew. He has
rowed for the last three years, and
this year has showed great improve
ment over his work of former years.
He is a faithful worker and a hard
fighter.
J. C. Huston, 'to, is the only Fresh
man 011 the crew. This is his first
year at rowing, but he shows good

form and in the position of number 5
will be a tower of strength as he is |
one of the largest men in the boat.
L. R. Gay, '08, who pulls number 6
is another member of the 1908 crew. I
He is one of the steadiest men in the
boat and is the hardest kind of a
worker, and is especially valuable in
a close race, where hard and fast work
is a necessity. He was a member of
last year's Varsity four.
J. R. Pemberton, '08, rowed for the
first time last year, but he has done
considerable work under Murphy and
in company with Zimmerman he
pulled in the Portland Rowing Club's
crew which defeated the best crews
in America last summer. He is the
heaviest man in the boat and one of
the most consistent workers. He will
pull number 7 on Saturday.
R. H. Conant, '08, who will stroke
the crew pulled number 2 in the 1908
crew and was a member of last year's
Varsity. He is one of the best stroke
men Murphy has ever trained, and
the coach and men have perfect con
fidence in his ability to follow or lead
any crew. He has all the essentials
of a good stroke and is able to raise
the stroke to any required number 1
providing be has the crew back of
him. There is no limit to his speed, !
but Murphy has seldom called on the j
crew to do better than 36 to the min
ute at which speed the men seem to j
do tlie best work.
P. W. Turner, '08, who will steer I
the Varsity, has been a coxswain
since his Freshman year, having held
the ropes for both the Freshman and
Varsity crews during the first year. :
Tt would be hard to get a more com- |
pctent man for the position he holds j
or one who knows more about the 1
rowing game. He can be absolutely
depended upon to maintain his rights 1
and steer a correct course in a race.
The Freshman crew is in perfect j
condition, and although a first year 1
crew is always more or less of .1
doubtful quantity in a race, the men
picked by Murphy should give a good
account of themselves.
C. IT. Vose, who will pull bow, was
one of the first men picked for the
crew, owing to his faithfulness and
the fact that he is not afraid of hard
work. R. S. Reynolds, number 2,
up to a few days ago was pulling
stroke, but at the last moment was
changed to his present position. He
has a tendency to shoot his slide but
offsets this slight fault in power and
endurance.
F. L. Wilde, who will pull num
ber 3 is the largest man in the boat,
being over six feet tall. His long
reach gives him a great advantage
and he is able to hold his stroke down
in good shape. J. W. Fitting, stroke,
has been training with the Varsity
during the season. He is a fighter
from the start and would probably
have made the other crew had it not
been necessary to putin a strong
stroke with the Freshmen to com
plete the crew. J. W. Roberts will
hold the tiller ropes and although this
will be his first experience he has
shown up dur'ng the season as being
a heady man.
The following officials will officiate
at the regatta:
Professor W. F. Durand, referee;
Vanderlyn Stow and Carlton Wall,
judges of the finish; Professor Magee
of the University of California, start
er; W. 0. Morrow of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, clerk of course, and
Colonel Edwards and Dr. F. Angell,
timers.
A lecture will be Riven in the
Chapel on next Monday evening at

ated with Abner Pnhle Co. of San
Francisco. Whitney will speak on
"Hydro-Electric Power Plants in Cal
