# CREWS WILL CONTEST TOMORROW
## Three Cornered Race Between Eights on Richardson's Bay.â€” Freshman Fours Will Meet On Water. 
### 
All is now in read'ness for the first
eight-oared Intercollegiate regatta to
be held on the Pacific Coast, which
will be run off tomorrow afternoon
shortly after one o'clock on Richard
son's Bay. Washington, California
and the Stanford crews are now on
the course, Stanford having gone up
this morning, and taken up their quar
ters in Sausalito. All live crews were
out today for a trial spin and a
large delegation of sporting enthusi
asts were on hand to watch and com
pare the crews, as today was the
first time they were all together.
The exact time of the regatta has
not been fixed. Final arrangements
will be made tomorrow morning by
the coaches, the time of the start de
pending upon the tide, which should
be slack shortly after i o'clock.
Every crew on the course is trained
to the minute and the losers can offer
no excuses about lack of condition.
All the men have been in training
four months or longer, and under the
watchful eyes of competent coaches
have rounded into the very best form.
Stanford's style of rowing differs
very materially from the styles taught
by Coaches Garnett and Conibear
The stroke is not a long one and the
men do not lie back on their oars
as much as the other crews. Wash
ington and California may row a
faster stroke in the race than Stan
ford, but it must be remembered that
the Varsity does its best work af
about a 36 stroke, and pulls a hard,
steady stroke from the catch to the
finish. In case of a sprint Conant
can be depended upon to increase his
speed. He has practically no limit for
running up the stroke and if the
crew follows him, as they are in con
dition to do, their opponents will have
to make the fastest kind of time to
keep abreast.
It is doubtful whether any records
will be broken owing to the fact that
the crews will row part of the distance
in shallow water, the resulting drag
holding back the shells very materi
ally.
I here is an air of confidence 011 the
part of all three universities over the
outcome. It is interesting to note
that Washington picks themselves to
win with Stanford second and Califor
nia third in the Varsity race. While
Stanford lias 110 reason for undue
confidence, owing perhaps to the fact
that we have not a veteran Varsity
crew, there is a very general feeling
among those who have watched the
men work during the season that, bar
ring accidents, there are very few
crews 011 the Coast who can pass
them, and if they do some records
will have to be broken.
The races should start very nearly
011 time owing to the fact that the
Washington crew w'll leave for home
immediately after the race. The
steamer on which they are to sail is
due to leave San Francisco at n a.
m. Arrangements have been made
for the steamer to steam over near

the course and await the crew, who
will row over to the boat immediately
after the race and be hoisted on
board. For this reason the Varsity
race will probably be run off first, the
Freshman crew| getting under way
immediately afterwards.
The outcome of the Freshman race
is naturally a matter of conjecture.
Garnett has had his crew in training
since last fall, and the men are pull
ing well together. On the other hand
Murphy had the pick of a large bunch
of unusually strong Freshmen and
has whipped them into excellent
shape. Fitting as stroke, trained with
the Varsity men most of the season,
and as a consequence he has had con
siderable experience in practice work,
and should be able to cover the course
in fast time. The race will be two
miles, covering the same course as
that rowed by the Varsity crews.
The observation train which will
follow the race will be made up of
twelve coaches, Stanford occupying
six. Tickets have been sold allowing
but forty passengers in each coach,
so there will be little crowding, and a
fair view of the race can be obtained.
Manager Sales went to Sausalito yes
terday to make arrangements for run
ning a number of flat cars out on the
wharf near the finish. If this can be
done bleachers will be built on the
cars, and spectators from this point
can get an unobstructed view of the
last mile and the finish. There is
plenty of room on the hills near the
finish and those having field glasses
can obtain a good view of the en
tire race by occupying this vantage
point.
A large number of launches, yachts
and small boats will be on hand, and
it is more than likely that launches
will be 011 hand to carry people over
the course for both races. The
course, however, will be policed and
kept clear, and as all boats arc re
quired to keep in the rear of the
shells, and as the majority of the
launches will be unable to keep up
the high speed maintained by the
shells, this method of seeing the races
will not be the best. Those wishing
to see the race should plan to leave
San Francisco on the Sausalito ferry
not later than 12 ;30, and in order to
get good positions, many will prob
ably leave before that time.

to the minute and the losers can offer
no excuses about lack of condition.
All the men have been in training
four months or longer, and under the
watchful eyes of competent coaches
have rounded into the very best form.
Stanford's style of rowing differs
very materially from the styles taught
by Coaches Garnett and Conibear
The stroke is not a long one and the
men do not lie back on their oars
as much as the other crews. Wash
ington and California may row a
faster stroke in the race than Stan
ford, but it must be remembered that
the Varsity does its best work af
about a 36 stroke, and pulls a hard,
steady stroke from the catch to the
finish. In case of a sprint Conant
can be depended upon to increase his
speed. He has practically no limit for
running up the stroke and if the
crew follows him, as they are in con
dition to do, their opponents will have
to make the fastest kind of time to
keep abreast.
It is doubtful whether any records
will be broken owing to the fact that
the crews will row part of the distance
in shallow water, the resulting drag
holding back the shells very materi
ally.
I here is an air of confidence 011 the
part of all three universities over the
outcome. It is interesting to note
that Washington picks themselves to
win with Stanford second and Califor
nia third in the Varsity race. While
Stanford lias 110 reason for undue
confidence, owing perhaps to the fact
that we have not a veteran Varsity
crew, there is a very general feeling
among those who have watched the
men work during the season that, bar
ring accidents, there are very few
crews 011 the Coast who can pass
them, and if they do some records
will have to be broken.
The races should start very nearly
011 time owing to the fact that the
Washington crew w'll leave for home
immediately after the race. The
steamer on which they are to sail is
due to leave San Francisco at n a.
m. Arrangements have been made
for the steamer to steam over near

the course and await the crew, who
will row over to the boat immediately
after the race and be hoisted on
board. For this reason the Varsity
race will probably be run off first, the
Freshman crew| getting under way
immediately afterwards.
The outcome of the Freshman race
is naturally a matter of conjecture.
Garnett has had his crew in training
since last fall, and the men are pull
ing well together. On the other hand
Murphy had the pick of a large bunch
of unusually strong Freshmen and
has whipped them into excellent
shape. Fitting as stroke, trained with
the Varsity men most of the season,
and as a consequence he has had con
siderable experience in practice work,
and should be able to cover the course
in fast time. The race will be two
miles, covering the same course as
that rowed by the Varsity crews.
The observation train which will
follow the race will be made up of
twelve coaches, Stanford occupying
six. Tickets have been sold allowing
but forty passengers in each coach,
so there will be little crowding, and a
fair view of the race can be obtained.
Manager Sales went to Sausalito yes
terday to make arrangements for run
ning a number of flat cars out on the
wharf near the finish. If this can be
done bleachers will be built on the
cars, and spectators from this point
can get an unobstructed view of the
last mile and the finish. There is
plenty of room on the hills near the
finish and those having field glasses
can obtain a good view of the en
tire race by occupying this vantage
point.
A large number of launches, yachts
and small boats will be on hand, and
it is more than likely that launches
will be 011 hand to carry people over
the course for both races. The
course, however, will be policed and
kept clear, and as all boats arc re
quired to keep in the rear of the
shells, and as the majority of the
launches will be unable to keep up
the high speed maintained by the
shells, this method of seeing the races
will not be the best. Those wishing
to see the race should plan to leave
San Francisco on the Sausalito ferry
not later than 12 ;30, and in order to
get good positions, many will prob
ably leave before that time.
All is now in read'ness for the first
eight-oared Intercollegiate regatta to
be held on the Pacific Coast, which
will be run off tomorrow afternoon
shortly after one o'clock on Richard
son's Bay. Washington, California
and the Stanford crews are now on
the course, Stanford having gone up
this morning, and taken up their quar
ters in Sausalito. All live crews were
out today for a trial spin and a
large delegation of sporting enthusi
asts were on hand to watch and com
pare the crews, as today was the
first time they were all together.
The exact time of the regatta has
not been fixed. Final arrangements
will be made tomorrow morning by
the coaches, the time of the start de
pending upon the tide, which should
be slack shortly after i o'clock.
