# LAST GAME TOMORROW
## STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA WILL MEET IN MORNING. Chances for Victory are About Even. Cardinal Nine is in Good Condition. 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
on the Coast League diamond at
Fourteenth and Valencia Sts., San
Francisco, Stanford and California
will cross bats in the deciding game
of the 1907 series. Although neither
team is in the best possible condition,
the contest promises to be fast and
close, and there is every reason to be
lieve that the small score of the first
two games will be repeated. The
same uine men that represented Stan
ford last Saturday will fight for the
Cardinal again tomorrow, and it is
probable that the Blue and Gold line
up will remain unchanged.
The practices during the past week
have been fast and snappy. Scott has
been doing well at second, while Gore
has been handling everything in right
field. Stott's finger is almost entirely
healed, but Captain split
thumb is apt to bother him consider
ably. It was to prevent further in
jury to this that Coach Lanagan cov
ered the first bag against Pensacola.
Theile is in fine shape and will pitch
good ball. The other members of the
team, Fenton, Sampson, Wirt, and
Owen, are all in the best of condition.
The nine left for San Francisco
immediately after an early practice,
this afternoon. The lineup follows:
Stanford—Stott, catcher; Theile,
pitcher; Presley, first base; Scott,
second base; Fenton, third base;
Sampson, shortstop; Owen, left field;
Wirt, center field; Gore, right field.
California—SchaefFer, catcher; Jor
dan, pitcher; Wulzen, first base; Reid,
second base; Heister, third base;
Causley, shortstop; Myers, left field;
Sweesy, center field; Miller, right
field.
