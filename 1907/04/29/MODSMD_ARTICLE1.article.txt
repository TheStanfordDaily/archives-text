# STANFORD WINS FROM CALIFORNIA IN BASEBALL AND REGATTA
## Varsity Oarsmen Win Easily This Morning â€” Freshmen Successful On Saturday. 
### 
Rowing at a 40 stroke, keeping in
perfect form, with every man showing
up at his best, the Varsity eight
flashed over the line this morning a
winner by a full six lengths over Cal
ifornia. Stanford took the lead at the
start of the race and at 110 time was
the result in doubt. Stanford was not
breasted once during the race and
swept down the course keeping the
stroke at about 36 until the last halt
mile, when Conant raised the stroke
about four and went over the finish
ing line over one hundred yards ahead
of the Blue and Gold. That the race
was a hard one and well fought by
California is shown by the fact that
two men in the California boat, Witter
the stroke, and Bush, three, fainted at
the finish.
Full particulars concerning the race
were not received on the Campus in
time for publication, but telephone
messages received stated that the race
started very nearly on time. The
water was fairly smooth at 10:30 and
the race was started without any diffi
culty. The actual time of the start
was 10:35:20 a. m., and the finish
10:48:26, making the time of the race
for the two and a half miles, 13:6.
The course was not surveyed before
the race and therefore the .time can
not be considered as accurate for a
two and a half mile course, but such
time as was made while not remark
able, can be considered as fast for the
course.
The men have been at Sausalito
since they went up 011 Friday last.
The crew did not return to the
Campus after the fiasco on Saturday
but remained near the course and
spent the interval in keeping in light
training and taking one or two short
rows. By the time the race took
place they were thoroughly familiar
with the course, and this no doubt had
its effect in the race.
The California men had the appear
ance of being somewhat overtrained,
and this may have accounted for the
fainting of two of the men at the end
of the race. The Varsity on the other
hand seemed to be in splendid condi
tion, and their watermanship and con
trol of the boat in rough water,
showed that they had confidence in
themselves and were well able to hold
their own in any kind of a sea.
The crew will probably return to
the Campus this afternoon or even
ing. the shell being brought back to
Redwood by steamer. The shell was
slightly damaged on Saturday but was
repaired and putin good shape on
Sunday.
In this morning's race, K. A. BicVel,
ex-'o7, B. S. Hoffman, of California,
and W. T. Spencer, of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, acted as judges.
D. D. Sales, '06, and Walter Chri'ty
were the timers.

The results of Saturday's regatta
are already well known. The Varsity
crews were started about 3 ;30 after a
long delay, during which time the tide
turned and a strong breeze had
sprung up. When the start was fin
ally made the crews were swamped
after rowing over part of the course,
Stanford going down first, followed
by Washington and California. It
was found impossible to row the race,
and as the City of Puebla had been ly
ing in the stream nearly three hours
waiting to take the Washington crew
aboard, Coach Conibear decided to
start home as it was impossible to
hold his men over a week for another
race. It was the understanding how
ever that the winner of today's race
would row Washington in the North
the latter part of May.
It looked for a time as though it
would be impossible to race at all
during the day, but later in the after
noon the wind died down and it was
then decided to row off the Freshman
race. Accordingly at 6:30 p. m.the
first year crews were started. The
course was cut down to a mile near
the San Francisco Yacht Club's quar
ters where the water was especially
smooth. Stanford jumped ahead at
the start and was leading by a length
at the end of the fifty strokes when
No. 3 in the California boat unshipped
his oar. The crews were then recalled
and the race started again. This time
California got the better start and at
the end of the first quarter were lead
ing by about half a length. A sprint
brought Stanford even with Califor
nia at the half, and then the former
began to draw away. At this point
both crews struck a swell from a
passing ferry, and Coxswain Roberts
had to turn his boat off the course
and meet the swells bow on to pre
vent swamping. The ground swell
also interfered with the crews and the
rowing was very ragged. California
gained a quarter of a length but at
the quarter post, the men had steadied
down. Fitting now raised his stroke
to forty, and the crew without great
difficulty pulled up even and then
away from their opponents and went
over the line a winner by about three
quarters of a length.
The showing of the Freshmen was
especially gratifying when it is con
sidered that they were rowing against
a crew picked by Garnett last semes
ter. and one that has been in training
since then. The crew rowed well to
gether and handled their boat in fine
shape.
On Friday evening before the race
R. H. Reynolds, number 2, was elected
captain. Reynolds played football
last year and made the Freshman
team. He has done good work in
rowing all through the season, and
