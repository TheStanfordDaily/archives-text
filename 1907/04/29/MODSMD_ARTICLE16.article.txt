# TWO NEW PROFESSORS
## TRUSTEES APPOINT BINGHAM AND ATKIN. Vacancies in Law and Romanic Language Departments Are Filled at Meeting of Board. 
### 
The appointment of Joseph W.
Bingham to the faculty of the Law
department, and the election of Ern
est G. Atkin to a temporary instruct
orship in the department of Romanic
Languages constitutes the most im
portant business transacted at the
meeting of the Board of Trustees
Friday.
Professor Bingham received his A.
B. degree from the University of
Chicago in 1902, and took a J. D. two
years later at the same institution.
He was then appointed Acting Profes
sor of Law at Cornell, where, during
the first year he took charge of Pro
fessor Finch's courses in Property.
Since last fall he has been giving
Torts, Equity I, Trusts, Quasi-Con
tracts and Constitutional Law. At
Stanford he will give the courses in
Property I and 11, Mortgages and
Suretyship. Bingham's article on the
Law of Fixtures, which appeared in
the January nnmber of the Columbia
Law Review, is a valuable contribu
tion to this division of the law of real
property. The appointment of Bing
ham is only temporary and he will
remain here during the coming year
only. The newly appointed profes
sor is a member of Phi Gamma Delta
and of the Delta Chi legal fraternity.
Instructor Atkin's election is also
for one year only. He will fill the
vacancy caused by Professor Searles'
absence on sabbatical leave. Atkin is
a graduate of Cornell University, and
while here he will give first- and sec
ond-year courses in French and Span
ish. For the last two years he has
been traveling through Europe, spend
ing much of his time in the study of
these two languages.
