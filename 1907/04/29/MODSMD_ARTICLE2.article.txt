# Ninth Inning Rally Turns Certain Defeat Into Victory and gives Se[Illegible]es to Stanford.
## 
### 
In a thrilling ninth inning rally the
Stanford team brought victory from
seemingly certain defeat in the decid
ing game of the 1907 Intercollegiate
baseball series, played in San Fran
cisco last Saturday morning. Owen
was the hero of the day. With the
score 1 to o in favor of California,
with two men 011 the bases, and two
out in the last half of the ninth inning
the left fielder drove out a three
bagger to the center-field fence, scor
ing both runners, winning the gam?
for Stanford and breaking California'*
long string of victories 011 the dia
mond. The majority of the Cardinal
rooters had left the grounds to catch
the 12:45 boat for Sausalito, but the
few who were left went wild with ex
citement.
Fenton who came up first in the
last half of the ninth, was retired at
first and Captain Presley flew out to
short. Sampson hit safely to right
and Stott followed with a single
to short center. Owen was the
next batter. lie fouled the first two
balls and swung hard on the third,
meeting the ball squarely, and send
ing it soaring far over Sweesy's head.
Sampson and Stott raced across tin
plate, while Owen rounded third be
fore the ball was returned to the dia
mond. The game was over and Stan
ford had won 2 to 1. To Owen, Stot:
and Sampson the victory is directly
due.
As for the rest of the game, al
though fast and close, it suffers when
compared to its remarkable ending.
Both nines fielded well, but Stanford
was stronger at the bat. Inexcusably
poor base running kept the Cardinal
from scoring earlier in the game.
Wirt was caught twicc on the bases
pud Fenton once. Theile pitched the
best game of his career. He had
great speed and fine control and
proved much steadier and more ef
fective than Jordan. The Blue and
Gold batters connected safely only
four times. Sampson carried off the
fielding honors. In the eighth he
robbed Jordan of a single by a beauti
ful stop and throw. Cadwalader re
placed Gore in right.
California scored their lone run in
the third. Myers was safe 011 Pres
ley's error. A sacrifice and an our.
advanced him to third, and Causley's
single brought him home.
Stanford had several chances to
score before the ninth. With two out
in the fourth and Wirt, Sampson and
Stott on the bags, Owen fanned. Tho
ball got away from Schaeffer and hit
the backstop. Schaeffer quickly re
covered the sphere and retired the
runner at first.
In the following inning Owen and
Stott were on first and third respec
tively and nobody was out. Cadwal

ader, attempting to bunt, popped up
to Jordan who doubled Owen. While
the California iniielders were discuss
ing the play Stott attempted to steal
home but was caught by Jordan.
Sweesy's men came dangerously
I near scoring in the ninth, when the
1 bases were full with one out. But
Theile fanned Miller, and Myers flew
to Wirt.
Not more than 600 people were
present, and California's rooting sec
I tion was almost twice the size of the
Cardinal's. Edwards and Goslinsky
1 again umpired, but their work was
far from satisfactory.
