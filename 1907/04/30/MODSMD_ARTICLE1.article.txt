# THREATEN TO STRIKE
## STONE CUTTERS MAY GO OUT TOMORROW. Desire Raise in Present Wage Scale. Final Conference Will be This Evening. 
### 
The total tie-up of all the stone
work in the reconstruction of the
University is the situation threatened
by the present deadlock between the
Stone Workers' Union and the Colusa
Sandstone Company 011 the matter of
a raise in wages. Unless Contractor
Bradbury of the stone company, who
arrived 011 the Campus at 3:30 today,
reaches an agreement with the men
this afternoon, fifty-two stone masons
and stone-cutters, with thirty helpers,
will not return to work tomorrow
morning. The men will go out for an
indefinite period.
The demand of the union is that a
new wage scale of six dollars a day
shall be put into effect tomorrow mor
ning. At present, stone cutters and
stone masons receive here the union
wage of five dollars a day. The men
employed at the University are mem
bers of the stone cutters' union, which
belongs to the Building Trades Coun
cil of San Francisco. This organiza
tion controls the affairs of affiliated
unions in San Francisco and the terri
tory for one hundred miles around.
At a conference of the representatives
of the affiliated unions and the repre
sentatives of the largest stone com
panies engaged in fulfilling contracts
in San Francisco, of which the Colusa
Sandstone Company is one, the de
mand for the raise was finally de
cided upon.
"We have given the men our ulti
matum Saturday aÂ«d have not heard
from them since/' said Contractor
Bradbury this afternoon. "Three
propositions were made to the men.
First, we offered them arbitration.
Following this we offered to give
them five and a half a day. We
also offered them the six dollars asked
for, beginning at the end of four
months. They would not accept any
of these proposals so present indica
tions are that there will be a strike."
At the conference of the parties
concerned which was held Saturday
afternoon in San Francisco, Con
tractor Bradbury made a speech stat
ing the case for the Colusa Stone
Company. J. D. McGilvray did a like
service for the McGilvray Stone Com
pany, and Contractor McFee talked
for the McFee Company. But after
the propositions of the employers
were made and the union members
discussed their side of the question,
the advances of the stone companies
were not met by the stone workers,
who still held out for the increase in
pay.
Many of the men working on the
University buildings are sorry to see
the strike commence, but they say
that they are forced to go out on
account of the vote to do so taken
by the majority of the members of
the union. They claim that they were
outvoted in the union meeting by the
men who are working in San Fran
cisco. These workers may be justi
fied in their demands for higher

wages, on account of the high cost of
living in San Francisco. According
to some statements, five dollars and
a half a day received here would be
equivalent to six dollars in San Fran
cisco. For this reason a number of
the local employers would be willing
to return to work at the proposed rate
of five dollars and fifty cents. How
ever, they are compelled to maintain
their organization and stand in with
the other members, who are holding
out for six dollars.
The carpenters employed by the
Colusa Sandstone Company on the
work of the buildings of the Univer
sity have asked for a raise from five
dollars a day to five and a half. If
their demand is not granted by May
15, they will also strike.
The present controversy is not the
first which has delayed the work of
reconstructing the University. Hardly
had rehabilitation been commenced
last summer than all the union men
working here struck because they had
mates who were not members of the
unions. Last summer the work was
greatly retarded by this labor
trouble, and the outlook presents an
extremely strong probability that a
repetition of this delay will be ex
perienced this summer.
