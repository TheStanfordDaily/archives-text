Murphy. The success ot
Stanford's crews this season show
that Murphy is the equal if not the
superior of any rowing coach on the
Pacific Coast and steps looking to
ward his retention next year should
he taken at once. The terms under
which Murphy was signed this year
were very peculiar, with the Student
Body paying part of his salary and
the Boat Club making up the balance
by voluntary subscription. Xext year,
if it can possibly be arranged, Murphy
should be paid directly by the Student
Body and not be subjected to the in
convenient arrangement under which
he returned this year.
