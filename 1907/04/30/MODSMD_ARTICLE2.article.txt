# "QUAD" OUT NEXT WEEK
## 1908 ANNUAL IS NOW ON THE PRESS. Opportune Arrival of High Grade Paper Permits Stanley-Taylor Company to Fulfill Contract. 
### 
It is now certain that the 1908
"Quad" will be on sale before the
close of next week. The work of
printing the book was begun by the
Stanley-Taylor Company this mor
ning and the edition will be delivered
lo the management by the middle of
next week.
The printers have been severely
handicapped in their efforts to get the
book out on time by a delay in the
arrival of the paper which was spe
cially ordered for the work. The car
has been on the road since February
and arrived in San Francisco late yes
terday afternoon. If its arrival had
been fifteen minutes later the printers
would have been compelled to substi
tute an inferior grade of paper, but
the opportune appearance of the car
load of superior stock will enable the
publishers to turn out the annual on
the high grade of paper stipulated in
'he contract. As the work has al
ready been delayed over two weeks,
Stanley-Taylor Company will pul
their entire force at the work of turn
ing out the book 011 schedule time.
Manager Theile states that the
price of the 1908 "Quad" will be the
same as that charged for former
Junior annuals. The regular price
will be $2.50 but Juniors who have
paid their "Quad" asscjfclj'*may
obtain copies for $1.50.
