Editor "Daily Palo Alto" ;
The Stanford Musical Society which
has just been organized is now mak
ing arrangements for the coming year.
Especially is an endeavor being made
to secure quarters for club rooms.
There are several possibilities in view,
and the success of any one of these
as well as of the club as a whole de
pends to a large extent 011 the num
ber who will join the club. People
interested in this society will not be
asked to join this semester, that is,
will not be asked to pay the dues
which have been announced as $2
per semester for active and $3 for
associate members. But if all who in
tend to join next semester would give
their names to Professor Searles, to
E. G. Sheibley, or to Miss J. Dillon,
it would assist much in the arrange
ments to be made for next year. All
names should be handed in within the
next two weeks.
J. Dillon, Sec.
