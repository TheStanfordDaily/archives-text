# WINNING CREW BACK
## VARSITY OARSMEN TO TRAIN FOR WASHINGTON. University of Wisconsin Invites Cardinal to Send Crew to Big Poughkeepsie Regatta. 
### 
Stanford's victorious eight returned
to the Campus today from Sausalito.
The men are in magnificent condition
and do not show the effects of yester
days race at all. The crew brokf
training immediately after the race
but will start light work again this
week in preparation for the race with
Washington on May 30.
The crew will leave shortly after
the close uf allege and will probably
go North by steamC;- *0 Seattle, tak
ing the eight with them. I lie regatta
will be held over the splendid three
mile course on the waters of Lakr
Washington. Stanford goes North in
pccordance with an agreement made
between the three universities that
the winning crew 111 the Stanford-
California race should visit Seattle.
Captain Zimmerman received a let
ter from Wisconsin a short time ago,
inviting the Cardinal oarsmen to com
pete in a triangular regatta with Syra
cuse and Wisconsin at the latter uni
versity. As this regatta is to be held
on May 30, the date of the Stanford-
Washington race, the proposal was
out of the question. Wisconsin, how
ever, tendered a further invitation to
the Cardinal to participate in the big
Poughkeepsie regatta of which Wis
consin is a member. Zimmerman
stated that Murphy was willing to
take a four-oared crew to Poughkeep
sie if the necessary financial arrange
ments could be made. The trip of
the crew would have to be financed
by the Student Body as the Boat Club
has 110 funds and no expenses would
be paid from the East
