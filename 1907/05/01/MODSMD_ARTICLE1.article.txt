# YEAR BREAKS RECORD
## STANFORD WINS ALL VARSITY ATHLETICS. California Almost Equalled Record in 1901-1902.—No Varsity Defeated Since June, 1905. 
### 
Stanford's victories in the Intercol
legiate regatta and the baseball series
bring to a close the most fuccessful
year in the history of Stanford ath
letics. Every Intercollegiate event
for which the Varsity S is awarded
was taken by the Cardinal athletes
and in addition to this, a Stanford
debater won the Carnot medal. Cali
fornia won the Intercollegiate debate,
the chess tournament and women's
tennis and basketball. The Freshmen
of the Blue and Gold were more suc
cessful than her older athletes, win
ning two out of three first year events.
The Cardinal's record this year has
never been equalled before in the ath
letic history of the two universities,
as this is the first year in which the
• Intercollegiate regatta has been add
ed to an unbroken string of victories
by cither university. It is also worthy
of comment that Stanford has not lost
a Varsity athletic event since June,
1905, when the Blue and Gold crew
won the big race on Lake Washing
ton. Stanford won the '05 football
game and all the Intercollegiate events
of the spring of 1906 were cancelled
by the earthquake.
Neither university had a chance to
equal the record set by Stanford this
year, between 1892 and 1898. In that
period Stanford was not defeated up
on the gridiron and California was
uniformly successful 011 the track. In
the college year of IS9B-99 California
won football, track and baseball, but
lost tennis.
In 1899-1900 the Blue and Gold won
every athletic event but tennis. In
1901-02 California swept everything
before her and won football, baseball,
track and tennis. Only the fact that
this was before boating had been es
tablished, prevented the State Univer
sity from equalling Stanford's record
of this year. In 1902-03 California
captured football, baseball and tennis,
but Captain McCaughern's team broke
the long-standing track hoodoo and
downed California on her own oval.
Since then the Cardinal's record on
the gridiron has been a clean one and
the sports of the spring semester have
been almost evenly divided.
