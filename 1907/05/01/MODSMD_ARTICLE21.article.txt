# GUILD HAS A GOOD YEAR.
## Hospital Will be Kept Open During Vacation.â€”Fullaway Will be in Charge. 
### 
The Students' Guild Board held a
meeting this afternoon at 1 130 in Dr.
Snow's office. The choices of the
board for officers for the coming year
were decided upon and will be handed
in to the Executive Committee to be
acted upon at its meeting tonight.
Plans for the summer were also dis
cussed and it was decided that the
Guild Hospital would remain open
during the entire vacation period.
This is made possible by the very
successful year just past and a good
showing is expected when Treasurer
Macfarland turns in his report next
Monday.
During the summer months both
Dr. Snow and Professor Swain will
make extended trips on scientific re
search work and in their absence D.
T. Fullaway will be in charge. Pro
fessor Swain expects to return about
the first of July but Dr. Snow's stay
will probably be somewhat longer.
