# STONE MASONS STRIKE
## EIGHTY-TWO MEN WALK OUT THIS MORNING. Reconstruction of Masonry Will be Indefinitely Delayed by Labor Trouble. 
### 
up their tools this morning and re-
Eighty-two stone workers gathered
fused to work as a result of the strike
declared by the stone cutters and
stone masons' association. According
to the instructions of Contractor
Bradbury of the Colusa Stone Com
pany, Superintendent Reese last even
ing closed all the rooms of the outer
quadrangle which had been given over
to the work of reconstruction. As 110
settlement was reached between em
ployers and employees yesterday, the
rooms were not opened this morning.
Most important in the work which
will be retarded by the present strike
is the reconstruction of the new Geol
ogy building. This block, at the
southwest corner of the outer quad
rangle, had just been completed in
April of last year when it was badly
damaged by the severe shocks which
visited the University. Not a great
deal of time and labor has been ex
pended so far in refitting the stone
work on this part of the Quad, so that
the Geology department cannot enter
its new quarters for some months.
If the working force had been kept
busy until the building was finished,
it would have been possible to throw
open this corner of the Quad at the;
beginning of next semester. As the
matter now stands, the opening of the
new quarters for the Geology depart
ment may not take place until next
year.
Considerable reconstruction re
main to be done at the corners of
the Quad at which the Engineering
departments and the department of
Physics have their headquarters. How
ever, both buildings are occupied and
the work of none of the departments
concerned will be materially ob
structed. When the men went out,
the last stone had just been replace'l
in the east side of the quadrangle
which contains the English, History
and Economics departments. On the
Chemistry building there is little to
be done in order to complete the
reconstruction.
As the control of the unionist ac
tion is in the hands of the members
in San Francisco, 110 settlement can
he reached here until the controversy
is ended in the metropolis. J. E.
Stewart, '07, who has charge of the
office of the Engineering Commission,
stated today that the press of work
and contracts to be filled in San Fran
cisco would probably force a speedy
settlement of the labor difficulty.
"The men can't stay out very long
up there, because there is so much to
do,'' said Stewart. "It will not be
surprising if the strike is settled with
in a week."
