# DECLINE TO COMPETE
## STANFORD NOT TO TAKE PART IN CONFERENCE MEET. Strict Rules of Association and Lack of Funds Will Exclude Cardinal Team. 
### 
The Stanford track team has been
invited to participate in the annual
championship meet of the Western
Intercollegiate Conference Athletic
Association, which will be held in
Chicago on the ist day of June. The
Cardinal men will be unable to com
pete for various reasons. A large
number of strict rules govern the
Conference meet, and Stanford would
be barred by several of these. Fur
thermore, the treasury of the Student
Body is at present in no condition
to stand the extraordinarily heavy ex
pense of sending so many men to
Chicago.
The invitation came as a complete
surprise to those interested in Stan
ford athletics. Michigan, the usual
winner, will not compete this year,
and thus the meet will be robbed of
much interest. It is believed that the
Cardinal was asked to take part in an
endeavor to revive the enthusiasm in
the Conference sports. The invita
tion was also extended to the Univer
sity of California.
When Dr. Angell was asked for his
views 011 the subject, he said : "Stan
ford could not possibly compete under
the rules as they now exist. In the
first place, the Freshmen would be
excluded, and then the Cardinal ath
letes would be forced to abolish their
training table, if they took part in
the Conference meet. A great many
of the regulations would affect Stan
ford in one way or another. Further
more, if all these difficulties were sur
mounted, I would not favor the plan.
It would be a bad idea for the Car
dinal to go so far away to compete in
an} r contest."
Captain Macfarland admitted that
there was not the slightest chance ox
the men going East, but contrary to
Dr. Angell, he said that he favored
the trip greatly.
