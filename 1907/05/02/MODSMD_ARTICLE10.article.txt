# DAILY GETS EMBLEM
## COMMITTEE GRANTS SUBSTITUTE VARSITY LETTER. Catcher's Unselfish Action in Refusing to Enter Intercollegiate Series is Rewarded. 
### 
H. P. Daily, '07, substitute catcher
,on the Varsity baseball team was
| awarded the Varsity S at the regular
| meeting of the Executive Committee
j last night. Daily is the first man
i since the establishment of athletics
here, who has been given the right
to wear the Varsity emblem without
competing against California. The
reasons for the action of the Exec
utive Committee arc set forth in the
following resolutions which were
passed by that body:
"\\ hereas, By his action in declin
ing to enter the third game of the
, Intercollegiate series in the ninth inn
j ing, IT. P. Daily voluntarily sacrificed
| the opportunity to win his Varsity
, emblem for what he believed to be
' for the best interests of the Stanford
' team, therefore,
Be It Resolved, That in considera
tion of his unselfish spirit and of the
| fact that he is in every way worthy
to wear the emblem, the Executive
Committee hereby grants to him the
Varsity S, and,
Be It Further Resolved, That this
action is in no sense to be construed
i as a violation of the precedent that
the Varsity S shall he granted only to
those who have competed against Cal
ifornia in an Intercollegiate contest."
The incident referred to in the first
clause of the resolution, took place
in the ninth inning of the last game
of the Intercollegiate series. With
two men out in California's half of the
inning, Lanagan told Daily to go into
right field in order that he might win
his emblem. The latter refused, say
ing that he would probably weaken
the team. Under these circumstances
and because of his voluntary refusal
to accept the chance to win his em
blem, Coach Lanagan and Captain
1 Presley recommended to the Exec
| utive Committee that the emblem be
j granted.
Daily has been substitute catcher
on the Varsity for the past three sea
sons and has given Stott a close race
for his place behind the bat.
