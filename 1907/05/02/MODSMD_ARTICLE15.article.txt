The circumstances surrounding the
granting of the Varsity emblem to
substitute catcher Daily are so ex
ceptional that it hardly seems justi
fiable to claim that the action of the
Executive Committee has established
a new precedent. Daily was offered
an opportunity to make his Varsity
emblem in the regular manner. He
refused to take advantage of this op
portunity because he believed that by
so doing he was acting for the best
interests of the Stanford team. His
voluntary surrender of the opportun
ity of winning his emblem certainly
removes him from the company of
those men who arc occasionally
granted their emblems at other uni

versities for four years of hard and
consistent work without the possibil
ity or opportunity of competing in a
Varsity contest. The precedent that
the Varsity S shall only be awarded
to those who have competed against
California, still remains and it must
be maintained in the future as con
sistently as it has been in the past.
