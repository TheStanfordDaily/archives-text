College Cut Underwear
In the age when athletics are the mark of man, the undersuit claims much
thought. The shirt is without sleeves and has arm holes specially cut, so as to
give absolute freedom of movement. The drawers reach to the knee, are waist
clinging and may be adjusted and regulated at the side to the exact size of the
wearer's hip. Prices range form 50 cents to $1.50 a garment.
Also large shipment of Union Suits for summer wear just in. Prices range
from $1.25 to $3.00 a suit.
