If you want to make
money this summer
We have a proposition by which a
good man can, in three months, make
more than enough to defray his
college expenses for the next year.
There is no outfit to buy and no catechism
which you have to learn. All you need is
your own gray matter and a little help from
us from time to time.
If you will write us, wc will gladly
explain how we propose to make
your next college year free from
financial worry.
