# TO TAKE NO ACTION
## SENIOR CLASS WILL DROP BRENNAN AFFAIR. 1907 Passes Resolution Condemning Method of Handling Quad Finances.â€”Treasurer Reports. 
### 
The Senior Class brought up the
question of the Brennan investigation
again this afternoon and as a result of a
rather long discussion the class voted to
close the whole matter by a resolution
declaring the present system of controll
ing the accounts of the Junior annual to
be inefficient and inadequate and rec
ommending a reform in the handling of
' Quad'' finances. The resolution in
full is as follows:
Whereas, The present system of con
trolling the accounts of the managers of
the Junior annual is grossly inefficient
and inadequote and presents no satis
factory method of checking up such ac
counts, and,
Whereas, The profits accruing from
the publication of such year books are
exceedingly large, $3,000 or more, being
a possible profit from such transaction,
therefore,
Be It Resolved, That we, the mem
bers of the class of 1907, do hereby rec
ommend to future Stanford classes a re
form in the method of controlling the
"Quad" managers' accounts and in the
manner of fixing his compensation.
