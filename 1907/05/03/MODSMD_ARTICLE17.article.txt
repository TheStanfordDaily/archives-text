The resolution passed by the Senior
Class condemning the present unbusi
ness like method of controlling the fi
nances of the Junior annual is a blow at
a deep-rooted evil and should be vigor,
ously followed up by definite action on
the part of those classes whose "Quad"
is yet to appear. Whether there has
ever been any illegal practices on the part
of former "Quad" managers is not the
problem which is now to be worked out.
The very fact that it is impossible to
make any satisfactory investigation of
the accounts of the 1907 book is the

The Junior annual,
11 one sense a Stan
ts manager should
for this reason be placed under the same
direct supervision as the managers of the
'Sequoia" and the"Daily l'alo Alto."
The power to examine the "Quad" ac
counts may be reserved either by the
class or delegated to the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students.
Either plan should prove a successful
one and an efficient safeguard against
tlie unpleasant situation recently faced
by the class of 1907.
