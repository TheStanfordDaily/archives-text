# GOOD WORK BY GYM. CLUBS.
## Southern Gymnasts Join With Stanford Men In Very Successful Exhibition. 
### 
The dual exhibition given this even
ing by the Stanford Gym. Club and a
picked team representing Los Angeles
High and Polytechnic Schools was one of
the best which has been seen on the
campus. The work done by the South
ern men was exceptionally high class
and reflects great credit on their in
structor. The team showed good form
in all its work but was especially strong
on the mats, where their feats were both
clever and original.
While as a team the Stanford men
did not display the finished form of the
visitors, their work was kept up to a
high standard. Their best performan
ances were on the horizontal bar and
the rings. The pyramids of the Stan
ford team were unique and difficult
feats. Japanese wrestling was also in
cluded in the program.
