### 
A very enjoyable program was rend
ered at the final meeting of the Wo
men's League, held last night at Roble
Hall. The Girls' Glee Club sang, and
Dr. Campbell exhibited his collection of
Oriental water-colors.
As the University Trustees have de
clined to act upon the matter of the
compulsory club-house registration fee,
it will lie impossible to build the club
house according to the original plan.
The election of officers for the ensuing
year will take place during the coming
week.
