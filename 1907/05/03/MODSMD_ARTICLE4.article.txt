### 
The book to be published by the
Social Service Club 011 the relief work
in San Francisco after the fire, will
probably be ready by the first of nex*
semester. Professor A. B. Show, of
the History department, is planning
to devote his summer vacation to the
work of getting material together, and
if contributions are sent in immedi
ately, he can assure the publication by
September.
The book is to consist of a com
plete account of the relief work done
by Stanford and Palo Alto people in
connection with the disaster of April
18. Personal statements are wanted
from any one who had any share in
the work, and this applies not only to
students, but to the faculty as wel'.
The value of the story will lie in the
details of personal observation and
experience. Circulars, letters and
photographs dealing with the subject
are also wanted.
Anyone desiring to dictate his story
can do so without cost, by communi
cating with Mrs. F. M. Whitmer, 334
Homer Avenue, Palo Alto.
About twenty-four manuscripts have
been sent in and as many more are
expected. The contribution of photo
graphs has been above expectation-,
and there is every reason to expect
that the book will be a success.
