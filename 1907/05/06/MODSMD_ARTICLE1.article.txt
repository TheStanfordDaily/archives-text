# NEW SPORT POPULAR
## MUCH INTEREST IN CROSS COUNTRY RUNNING. Trainer and Track Captain Will Give the Movement Their Support Next Year. 
### 
The action of the Quadrangle Club
in offering two prize cups to stimulate
interest in cross country running, has
met with the hearty approval of those
interested in the sport. As yet no
definite details of the conditions
which will govern the contest have
been worked out, but it is assured
that the new sport will be popular
from the start.
The race will probably be over a
two-mile course and open to everyone,
whether or not they are in regular
training for track work. In speaking
of the event today, Captain Macfar
land said that he was heartily in favor
of the plan as it would bring out new
men in the track team. He favors a
two-mile race, to be held in the fall
semester after the football season, and
open to all except wearers of the S.
Both Macfarland and Captain-elect
Lanagan are of the opinion that such
a race may do more harm than good
if men attempt to run it without the
training necessary before entering
such a contest. Lanagan will give the
movement his support and the men
will have the same advice and assist
ance from Trainer Moulton as those
doing regular track work. Moulton
could not be seen today, but it is
und rstood that he does not have
much faith in cross-country work as
a means of developing track men but
does favor it as being an incentive for
the men to keep in training.
