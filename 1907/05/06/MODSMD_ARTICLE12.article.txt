The first edition of the 1908 "Quad"
will be placed 011 sale at 10 o'clock
Wednesday morning, at the usual
place on the Inner Quadrangle ad
joining the Pure Mathematics build
ing. The total output of f he pub
lishers will amount to about eight
hundred copies. Two hundred of
these will be needed by the manage
ment to supply the advertisers.
Two hundred more will be used to
supply those members of the class
who paid their assessment, thus leav
ing an edition of four hundred copies
for general distribution. This is a
slightly larger edition than is usually
run off, but on account of the com
plete history of the earthquake which
it contains, the management of the
1908 annual expects to find a more
active demand for this year's book
than has been shown in former years.
The late arrival of the paper for the
| book has delayed the printers two
weeks, and it was only by running
their plant to its full capacity that
the Stanley-Taylor Company was able
to turn out the book i ' time for man
ager Thcile to place it on sale before
the examinations began.
Editor Hadley left for San Fran
cisco today to make final arrange
ments for packing and shipping the
books.
The price of the volume will be two
dollars and fifty cents, but those
Juniors who have pa'V <he ; r assess
ment will receive their copies ai
reduced rate of one dollar and a half.
