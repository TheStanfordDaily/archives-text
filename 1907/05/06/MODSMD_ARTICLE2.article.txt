# Southern Pacific Makes Summer Rate.
## 
### 
The usual rate of a fare and a third
to points in California and return will
be offered by the Southern Pacific
Company for the benefit of Stanford
students wishing to spend the summer
vacation in this State. The rate will
be in force until the first of June at
least. Assistant Registrar McDowell
will not attend to the reserving of
berths as usual, but all reservations
should be made at once through the
Southern Pacific agent at Palo Alto.
