The last number of the "Chaparral" l

made a drawing of the next editor in
his characteristic style. Other car

and Miss L. M. Rible, '10.
Among the literary features is 1
page monologue, called "A Monologue
at Wilson's." "A Chat With Chap
pie" tells of the trials of this year's
editor and announces the editor for
next year. There is also a lesson
from Chappie's "Correspondence
School," and a column of advice to
graduates.
In the "Now That's" the editor calls
attention to the general "Chaparral"
policy during the past year; scores an
obnoxious feature of Stanford poli
tics; knocks the yellow tendencies of
Stanford journalists; and says a final
word regarding the Palo Alto transfer
men.
