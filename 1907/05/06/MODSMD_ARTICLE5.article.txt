# FENTON IS BASEBALL CAPTAIN.
## Crack Third Baseman Is Unanimously Chosen to Lead Cardinal On Diamond In Season of 1908. 
### 
K. L. Fenton, '08, of Portland, Ore.,
was yesterday chosen to lead the Car
dinal Varsity nine during the season
of 1908. Fenton was the logical can
didate for the position, and he re
ceived no opposition, his election be
ing unanimous. The newly chosen
captain entered college in the fall of
1904. By his great individual work
the Freshman football team which he
captained came out victorious in its
game with California. In the spring
of 1905 Fenton earned the position of
third base 011 the Varsity nine, and
lie has held down that bag ever since.
He is one of the surest fielders that
ever wore a Cardinal uniform, and he
is a very reliable hitter. During the
past season he stood at the top of the

batting list. In the first game of the
1905 Intercollegiate series Fenton
scored Stanford's only runs with a
homer in the ninth inning.
On account of his light weight
Fenton was unable to make the Var
sity eleven during his Freshman or
Sophomore years, but he proved .1
very capable Rugby full-back last
season, hor the past two years he
has held the punting trophy of the
Quadrangle Club, and he was recently
awarded the Skull and Snakes batting
cup.
Fenton belongs to the Kappa Sigma
fraternity, the Phi Delta Phi legal
fraternity and the Skull and Snakes
honor society. He majors in the de
partment of Law.
