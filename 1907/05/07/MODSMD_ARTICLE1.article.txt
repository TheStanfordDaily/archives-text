# WANTS YEAR CONTRACT
## MURPHY DESIRES LONGER TERM HERE. Will Probably Not Return Next Season Unless Signed For Full College Year. 
### 
Coach "Dan'' Murphy may not di
rect the interests of the Cardinal on
the water after the present Intercolle
giate season is closcd unless sufficient
inducements in the shape of a long
term contract can be offered him in
order to make it worth his while to
remain in the West. While Murphy
has the interests of the Stanford oars
men at heart and would like to coach
the crews again next year, several
considerations will undoubtedly influ- i
ence him in determining what he will
do after the race with the University
of Washington is concluded on May
30.
Murphy would probably have no
difficulty in signing a contract on good
terms to coach in the East which
would take his services for one year
at least. Necessary economy on the
part of the management of the Stu
dent Body finances makes it difficult
for the Executive Committee and !
the Boat Club to keep Murphy j
for a term longer than six months of
the year. Again, family ties bind
Coach Murphy to the East. He feels
that an engagement for a term longer
than six months would make it nec
essary for him to bring his family to
the Coast. If he cannot do this he
will be strongly influenced to return
to the East so that he can be near
his home. One of the greatest con
siderations which brought Murphy to
Stanford this year was his desire to
turn out a victorious Stanford eight.
Under the present short term con
tracts which Stanford has had with
Coach Murphy, he loses nearly half
of the year in arranging his interest-,
in the East and in the West, in mak
ing preparations to come to the Pa
cific Coast from the Atlantic and in
traveling. During the fall of last year
Murphy spent a great deal of time
nnd took much trouble in securing the
eight-oared shell, in order that the
Stanford oarsmen should have proper
equipment for the present season.
Coach Murphy would like to take
the members of the eight who com
posed last year's four to compete in
the East. If the Cardinal is victori
ous in the North, it is possible that
enthusiasm may he aroused to send
the men on an Eastern trip.
Murphy said this afternoon: "What
1 will do this summer depends largely
on the outcome of the race on Lake \
Washington. If I feel that it is worth
my while to remain on the Coast, 1
may accept an offer from the Portland
Rowing Club for the summer." If
Coach Murphy goes East this sum
mer, it will be extremely difficult to
bring him to Stanford next season
unless very favorable inducements can I
be offered.
