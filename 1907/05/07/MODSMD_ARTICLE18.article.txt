In another column will be found a
brief item concerning the afternoon
in Commencement Week which has
been set aside for Faculty "at homes."
As a means of bringing the Seniors,
Alumni and Faculty closer together,
these informal "at homes" have been
highly successful, and it be hoped
that they will be as much a feature
of this year's Commencement Week
as they were of that two years ago.
