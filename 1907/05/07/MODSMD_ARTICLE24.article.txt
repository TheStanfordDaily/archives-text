# PROBATION NOT ABOLISHED.
## Dr. Gilbert Denies Report That Athletes Can Compete Regardless of Scholarship. 
### 
In this morning's issue of a San
Francisco daily paper, it is stated that
hereafter no Stanford athletes will be
put on probation. The article says in
addition: "They will either be flunked
out or allowed to participate despite
the defects in their class work. - '
There seems to be no foundation for
either of the above statements.
When questioned concerning the
matter, Dr. Gilbert said: "I have
heard nothing about the alleged
changes. Furthermore, nothing has
even been proposed in regard to this.''
When interviewed this afternoon, As
sistant Registrar J. E. McDowell, '00,
said: "The only information that has
come to me concerning the abolish
ment of the probation list was that
published this morning in the San
Francisco paper. The Registrar's of
fice has heard nothing of this pro
posed change in the regulations."
