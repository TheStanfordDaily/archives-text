### 
The meeting of the new Students'
Guild Board was held last evening in
Palo Alto. The election of officers
for the new term, was held and re
ports of the various committees were
made. G. J. Presley, '07, was re
elected president and Miss M. L.
Squire, '07, vice-president. D. T. Full
away, '08, and G. C. Coe, '08, were
clectcd treasurer and secretary re
spectively.
President Presley appointed the fol
lowing committees : Cases—Dr. W. F.
Snow; Management—Miss M. L.
Squire, '07, G. C. Coe, '08, and Pro
fessor Swain ; Ways and Means—D.
T. Fullaway, '08, E. S. Dunbar, '08,
and Professor Griffin. These officers
go into effect on August Ist, 1907. A
committee will be appointed by the
president to take c "e of the Guild
during the summer hs and will
be announced at a later
The financial report of the retiring
treasurer, J. C. Macfarland, '07, was
submitted and showed a net surplus
of $1630.69 for the months from Au
gust, 1906 until April, 1907.
The reports of Dr. Snow as chair
man on cases and Miss E. R. Mirri
lees, '06, 011 management show that
the Guild Hospital is growing as a
general hospital and that the accom
modations for outside patients have
reached the maximum. Should more
outside patients desire admittance,
they will have to be refused unless
improvements in the way of enlarging
the institution are made. This will
necessitate the expenditure of at least
§5,000. As the income of the outside
patients has made the surplus in the
treasury of the hospital, the further
increase in the accommodations for
outside patients will probably warrant
the investment of $5,000 for another
building.
There were a total of 36 patients in
the hospital during the month of
April, 24 of whom were students, 3
professors and 9 outsiders.
