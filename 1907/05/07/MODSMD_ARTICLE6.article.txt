At a meeting at the boat-house this
afternoon of the Varsity crew men, L.
R. Gay, '08, was elected captain of
next year's Varsity. Gay has rowed
for three years. As a Freshman
he was a member of the famous '08
crew, rowing the No. 2 position. Last
year he rowed the same position on
the Varsity four which Coach Murphy
said he was willing to back against
any four in the country. This year
he rowed No. 6 on the splendid eight
which so decisively defeated the Blue
and Gold at Sausalito and which will
meet Washington on Lake Washing
on the 30th of this month.
The newly elected captain has been
one of the hardest working men on
the boating squad and is one of the
best oarsmen at Stanford. He regis
ters from Redlands in the department
of Mining Engineering and is a mem-
ber of Skull and Snakes and the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity.
