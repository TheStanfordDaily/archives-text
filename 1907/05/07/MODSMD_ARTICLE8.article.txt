# Planning to Form Art Club.
## 
### 
Several students of the Art depart
ment have been considering the es
tablishment of an art club here. Pro
fessor A. B. Clark is interested in the
matter and it is probable that the
club will be organized this year.
Plans have been made to arrange the
old studio into club and exhibition
rooms. Arrangements will be made
to have speakers from San Francisco
give lectures on art.
