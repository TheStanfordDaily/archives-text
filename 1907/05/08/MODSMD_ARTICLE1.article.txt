# WANT RACE IN FALL
## TRAINER AND CAPTAIN DISCUSS CROSS COUNTRY. Fear Strain of Training Would Harm Distance Runners in Spring Semester. 
### 
That the proposed cross country
run will be one of the events of the
fall semester has been definitely de
cided by Trainer Moulton and Track
Captain Lanagan. This decision
reached because it was the opinion
of both trainer and captain that if held
in the spring semester the ill efifect of
running over the hard roads in this
vicinity would more than offset any
advantage to be derived in the way
of developing distance men for the
track team. It is Lanagan's desire
that the men who go out for cross
country do regular work and keep the
same training rules that govern the
regular track men.
Whether or not wearers of the S
shall be debarred from the races is
still an open question, though Lana
gan and Moulton favor the debarring
of those who have won their emblem
on the track. The length of the
course is another matter which has
been up for discussion, some favor
ing a longer run than the two-mile
race proposed. Moulton advocates
the shorter distance as it would prob
ably bring out more men.
