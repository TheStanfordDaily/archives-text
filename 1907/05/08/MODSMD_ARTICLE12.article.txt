With the new track lying idle from
the day of the Intercollegiate meet
to the end of the semester there is
no reason why Stanford should not
have an opportunity to play the part
of host to more of the preparatory
school athletic teams. The Inter
scholastic meet is practically the only
chance we have to entertain the
>oung athletes of this coast, and the
inauguration of a custom of holding
more of the dual and league events
on the Stanford track would result in
a distinct advantage to all concerned.
Both as a step toward the introduc
tion of such a custom, and because
we owe such a duty as hosts, the
teams from the schools of the Pa
cific Athletic League which will con
test here next Saturday, should have
their stay made as pleasant as pos
sible.
