# TEAM MAY GO TO RENO.
## Manager Sales Receives Offer for Post Season Baseball Game With Sagebrushers. 
### 
Manager Sales is in receipt of an
offer from tlie University of Nevada
proposing to bring the Stanford base
ball team to Reno after college closes
here. If satisfactory terms can lie
made with Nevada, Sales will try to
arrange another game with the Un : -
sity of Utah at Salt Lake City. As
yet, the prospects are very indefinite
and no contract has been made con
cerning the terms of the trip.
Even if suitable arrangements can
be made, it is very probable thÂ«v the
team which met California, will pr
make the trip intact, for it is known
that some of the Varsity men will be
unable to go. Provided the contract
is closed, the team will leave imme
diately after Commencement Week.
