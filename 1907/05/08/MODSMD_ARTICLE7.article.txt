raid: "What the women of Stanford
need more than anything else, is a
club-house, and the Women's League
is the only organization that can eve:
succeed in building one. We will dr.
everything possible, next year, to ac
complish thij, but we must have the
hearty co-operation of every woman
of the University to insure success.'
The refusal of the Trustees to allow
the compulsory dollar extra registra
tion fee, which was unanimously ad
vocated by the women, makes it nec
essary for new plans to be brough<
forward, but the League hopes that
by the beginning of next semester
some practical means may have been
discovered.
