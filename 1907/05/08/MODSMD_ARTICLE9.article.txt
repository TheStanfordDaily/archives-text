# CREW TRAINING AGAIN
## VARSITY PREPARES FOR NORTHERN TRIP. Pemberton and Stark Will Probably be Unable to Row Against Washington on 30th. 
### 
The members of the Boat Club who
j are trying out for the crew which will
represent the Cardinal in the North
are training daily at Redwood. Ov
the Varsity crew which rowed against
California, two of the men will be un
able to make the trip. These men are
, Pemberton, who rowed No. 7, and
; Stark, who rowed how. Pemberton
! will be unable to go on account of the
' summer Geology trip, which comes
immediately after the close of the se
| mester and lasts for several weeks.
The men who are trying out for the
; positions left vacant by these men
arc J. W. Fitting, '10, who rowed Var
sity regularly the last few weeks pre
| viotis to the Intercollegiate but was
j finally taken out and put 011 the
' Freshman crew as stroke in order to
| strengthen it; 11. Woudries, '08, who
011 account of his having transferred
from Chicago last semester was inel
igible to row against California; H. B.
Patrick, '10, who was also declared in
eligible to row in the Intercollegiate
because of his having come from an-
I other college, and R. H. Reynolds, '10,
j who rowed on the Freshman four.
The other men who will probably
make the trip are R. H. Conant, '08,
| who has for two years stroked the
Varsity and in his Freshman year
rowed that position on the '08 crew;
F. Zimmerman, '07, captain, who
| rowed No. 4 and is probably the most
experienced man in the boat; L. R.
; Gay, ? 08, captain elect for next year,
I who rowed No. 6; A. N. Cole, '08, who
rowed 011 his Freshman crew and was
a prominent candidate for the Varsity
last year, and who rowed No. 3 this
year against the Blue and Gold; A.
B. Shutts, 'eg, who rowed on the last
year's Freshman and this year rowed
at No. 2 on the Varsity; J. A. Huston,
'ro, who this yea* rowed No. 5 on the
Cardinal eight, and F. W. Turner, '08
who has coxed the Varsity for two
j seasons.
Captain Zimmerman has not as yet
J heard from Poughkeepsie relative to
! the proposed trip there in August.
[ In the North there is the possibility
that the men will have several races
jto row. It is quite likely that Port
-1 land will be met and also Victoria.
Other races may possibly be arranged
before the crew starts North or even
after the men have arrived there.
