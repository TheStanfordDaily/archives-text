# TO CONFER WITH MURPHY.
## Executive Committee Authorizes Sales to Get Terms from Coach.—No Pins for Chess Team. 
### 
At its meeting last night the Exec
utive Committee authorized Manager
Sales to interview Coach Murphy, with
a view to determining under what
terms the rowing coach would return
next year. While Murphy has madi
no direct communication to the Com
mittee, it is understood that he does
not desire to return to Stanford under
a six months' contract, such as he has
had with the Student Body for the
past two seasons. Sales will inter
view the veteran coach and will re
port his desires at the last meeting
of the Committee, next Wednesday
night, when some definite decision re
garding the matter of a new contract
will be reached.
A motion to grant chess pins only
to teams which win or tie the Tnter
•collegiate match with California was
passed. This was worded to go into
effect at once, and will deprive the
members of this year's losing team
of pins.
The matter of granting gold em
blems to the track and crew was laid
on the table for one week. Bills pre
sented by Manager Sales, aggregating
over $3,000, were authorized paid.
