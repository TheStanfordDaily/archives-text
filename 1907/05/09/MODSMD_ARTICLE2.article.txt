The festivities of Senior Week will
be opened on the evening of May 16
by the presentation in Assembly Hall
of Boucicault's comedy "London As
surance.'' A strong cast insures a
good production, although the efforts
of the players have been handicapped
by a lack of time in which to perfecf
their parts. The play itself, although
lacking in the usual local hits, is one
of the most brilliant ever put upon 'i
professional stage, and should be a
distinct success.
The plot of the play is cannpar
atively simple. Sir Harcourt Courtly,
an English baronet who has devoted
most of his life to the sowing of wild
oats and who, according to his own
assertion, has not yet, at the age of
sixty-three, commenced to reap them,
is making preparations for his mar
riage with Miss Grace Harkaway, 3
niece of one of his old friends. The
uncle. Max Harkaway, comes to sec
Sir Harcourt, and while there meets
Dazzle, a smooth appearing young
fellow who has accompanied young
Charles Courtly home the night pre
vious. Harkaway takes a great fancy
to Dazzle and unbeknown to either
Sir Harcourt or his son, invites bun
to the wedding. Dazzle accepts with
much alacrity. Charles Courtly
comes in, in a less companionable
mood than he was the night previous,
and orders Dazzle out of the house.
Dazzle reminds him of their newly
formed friendship of the night before
and invites him to visit him at his
country place, meaning to take him
with him to Harkaway's villa. Court
ly, seeing a respite from his creditors,
is nothing loath.
The second act opens with the ar
rival of Dazzle and young Courtly at
(he Harkaway place, where they are
both struck by the beauty of Grace.
Shortly afterwards Max Harkway and
the elder Courtly arrive, the latter as
tounded at the sight of his son.
whom lie supposed had gone off to
college the day before. The latter
is equally surprised at seeing his
father and knowing nothing of the
occasion of his visit until then, puts
up a bold face and declares that he
never saw Sir Harcourt before, in
which assertion Dazzle bears him out.
The old gentleman is by no means
satisfied, but is finally convinced.
The remainder of the play, which
is prolonged rather more than the
action justifies, is concerned with the
developing of a love affair between

Grace and young Courtly masquerad
ing under an assumed name. This is
materially assisted by Lady Gay
Spanker, who succeeds in attracting
Sir Harcourt's attentions from his
affianced bride to herself, so that the
young people suffer little molestation
from that source. In the end Lady
Gay succeeds in getting Sir Har
court waiting with a carriage in which
he expects to elope with her, when
she exposes the whole business, to
the everlasting chagrin of the bar
onet. Grace and young Courtly re
ceive the paternal blessing in ap
proved fashion, and are the recipients
of congratulations, although it is diffi
cult to see from the reading of the
play, the occasion for them in either
case. The play is essentially one of
dialogue. It contains little dramatic
or artistic merit aside from that. But
the dialogue is sufficient to make it a
success and to justify the success
which it has always commanded
whenever it has been presented.
Pithy epigrams, witty passages at
repartee, clever turning of phrases
abound in every line, and serves to
keep the interest sustained through
out.
The choosing of the characters and
the coaching of the play has been en
tirely in the hands of Mrs. L. B.
Powers, who was responsible for the
successful production of "The Rivals"
by the 1907 Sophomore class.
F. H. Bernard, in the interpretation
of the part of Charles Courtly, has
probably the most difficult role he the
play. The action centers about this
character to a large extent, and at
times the proper carrying forward of
the plot is dependent upon the player
who impersonates this young gallant.
Miss C. C. Pedlar, '07, who takes
the part of Grace Harkaway, is well
known on the Stanford stage, having
interpreted important roles in "The
Rivals" and "Stanford—The Life
Strenuous." Dazzle, a brilliant young
"man about town" will be presented
by G. F. Zimmer, '08. who comes from
the University of Indiana with an ex
cellent record in dramatics and who
appeared here as Preto in "La Serena."
Miss C. L. Moise, '07, who will have
the part of Lady Gay Spanker, a high
spirited Amazon, was very successful
in "The Rivals" as Mrs. Malaprop.
The part of Pert, a frivolous young
maid, will be interpreted by Miss I.
L. Johnston, *07. F. F. Munier, '10,
has a very fitting part as Max Hark
away, a typical, bluff, Fnglisli squire.
Munier has taken but minor parts
heretofore but has cleverly demon
strated his ability.
J. M. Ward, '07, will fill the part
of Sir Harcourt Courtly, an elderly,
cynical, beau. Ward . has taken a
prominent part in Stanford dramatics
and his interpretation of the old
gentleman should be a strong one.
II. C. Perry, '08. will appear as Mr.
Spanker, better known as "Dolly," a
weak, handsome man, who is made
to appear in various foolish lights.

Perry was a member of "The Black
Friars," a dramatic organization of
Chicago University, before he c.Mtic
to Stanford last year.
Meddle is a strongly marked cari
cature of the conventional stage law
yer. D. M. Davis, '07, who appeared
in"The Rivals" and"The Life Stren
uous." will fill this part.
Cool, the imperturbable gentleman's
servant, will be presented by S. R.
Downing, '07, and H. W. Taft, '07.
will have the part of the conventional
London footman and of Simpson, the
butler.

The festivities of Senior Week will
be opened on the evening of May 16
by the presentation in Assembly Hall
of Boucicault's comedy "London As
surance.'' A strong cast insures a
good production, although the efforts
of the players have been handicapped
by a lack of time in which to perfecf
their parts. The play itself, although
lacking in the usual local hits, is one
of the most brilliant ever put upon 'i
professional stage, and should be a
distinct success.
The plot of the play is cannpar
atively simple. Sir Harcourt Courtly,
an English baronet who has devoted
most of his life to the sowing of wild
oats and who, according to his own
assertion, has not yet, at the age of
sixty-three, commenced to reap them,
is making preparations for his mar
riage with Miss Grace Harkaway, 3
niece of one of his old friends. The
uncle. Max Harkaway, comes to sec
Sir Harcourt, and while there meets
Dazzle, a smooth appearing young
fellow who has accompanied young
Charles Courtly home the night pre
vious. Harkaway takes a great fancy
to Dazzle and unbeknown to either
Sir Harcourt or his son, invites bun
to the wedding. Dazzle accepts with
much alacrity. Charles Courtly
comes in, in a less companionable
mood than he was the night previous,
and orders Dazzle out of the house.
Dazzle reminds him of their newly
formed friendship of the night before
and invites him to visit him at his
country place, meaning to take him
with him to Harkaway's villa. Court
ly, seeing a respite from his creditors,
is nothing loath.
The second act opens with the ar
rival of Dazzle and young Courtly at
(he Harkaway place, where they are
both struck by the beauty of Grace.
Shortly afterwards Max Harkway and
the elder Courtly arrive, the latter as
tounded at the sight of his son.
whom lie supposed had gone off to
college the day before. The latter
is equally surprised at seeing his
father and knowing nothing of the
occasion of his visit until then, puts
up a bold face and declares that he
never saw Sir Harcourt before, in
which assertion Dazzle bears him out.
The old gentleman is by no means
satisfied, but is finally convinced.
The remainder of the play, which
is prolonged rather more than the
action justifies, is concerned with the
developing of a love affair between

Grace and young Courtly masquerad
ing under an assumed name. This is
materially assisted by Lady Gay
Spanker, who succeeds in attracting
Sir Harcourt's attentions from his
affianced bride to herself, so that the
young people suffer little molestation
from that source. In the end Lady
Gay succeeds in getting Sir Har
court waiting with a carriage in which
he expects to elope with her, when
she exposes the whole business, to
the everlasting chagrin of the bar
onet. Grace and young Courtly re
ceive the paternal blessing in ap
proved fashion, and are the recipients
of congratulations, although it is diffi
cult to see from the reading of the
play, the occasion for them in either
case. The play is essentially one of
dialogue. It contains little dramatic
or artistic merit aside from that. But
the dialogue is sufficient to make it a
success and to justify the success
which it has always commanded
whenever it has been presented.
Pithy epigrams, witty passages at
repartee, clever turning of phrases
abound in every line, and serves to
keep the interest sustained through
out.
The choosing of the characters and
the coaching of the play has been en
tirely in the hands of Mrs. L. B.
Powers, who was responsible for the
successful production of "The Rivals"
by the 1907 Sophomore class.
