The idea of a Trophy Room, where
the cups, pennants, and footballs won
by Stanford teams may be collected,
seems to have been abandoned since
the destruction of the new Gymnasi
um by the earthquake. Although it is
not now possible to set apart a place
either as appropriate or as well fitted
for such a purpose as a room in the
Gymnasium would have been, yet the
idea is by far too good a one to be
thus hastily cast aside. It is very
improbable that the present genera
tion will sec a new Gymnasium here
and some action should be taken to
ward the finding of temporary quar
ters to serve the purposes of a Trophy

Room until a new building is com
pleted. The pennants in Encina Club
Room, the Hearst debating trophy,
and the cups recently won by the Car
dinal crews in the South, would form
a nucleus for a large collection, and
bringing these trophies together
would also serve to insure their safe
keeping.
