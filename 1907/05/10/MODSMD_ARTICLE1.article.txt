# "QUAD" IS A SUCCESS
## 1908 ANNUAL UP TO THE AVERAGE. Book Gives Complete Record of Events of Year but is Lacking in Originality. 
### 
rive 1908 'Quad'' was put on sale
this morning on the Inner Quad
rangle. As a record book the annual
is fully the equal of its predecessors,
but it is lacking in original features.
With the exception of the section
devoted to the earthquake the big
book docs n<_>l deviate from the beaten
path of former "Quads." Mechanic
ally the 1908 "Quad" is above the
average. The makeup is good and
typographical errors and misspelled
names are comparatively infrequent.
The earthquake section is splendidly
illustrated with photographs taken im
mediately after the disaster. The
article which accompanies the pictures
is by W. F. Herron, '08. It is a good
story, but bad history, and in a record
book it is history that is wanted.
Readers of "Quads" have grown to
expect little in the class histories
which appear in the annuals and in
the present annual they find no excep
tion to the general rule.
For the most part the special artic
les are clever and well written. J. F.
Lanagan, to whom the book is dedi
cated, contributes a strong appeal for
less men 011 the bleachers and more
011 the fields. Dr. A. H. Suzzallo
contributes a vigorous article on the
"Welding of the Stanford Spirit."
One of the most breezy and enter
taining special articles is supplied by
Ike Russell, '04, on the making of
"Quads." Morris Oppenheim's con
tribution is a humorous exploitation
of the recent history of "Chaparral."
One of the best features of the
book is the clever dramatic review
by Miss A. W. Kimball, '04. It is a
keenly critical, but kindly account of
the dramatic achievements of the past
year.
The athletic section is as good as
usual in spite of the fact that more
than one-half of the Intercollegiate
contests of the year were left incom
plete on account of the earthquake.
The individual pictures are not
above the average, but the team and
a tion pictures are good. The re
views are brief, but give a thor
ough resume of the season.
Artistically the book is on the
whole good. One of the best indi
vidual pictures is the title page for the
fra ernity section, by A. S. Macdon
ald. 'ro. D. H. Ferry, '08. had charge
of the art department and the result
shows his good taste and judgement.
The Josh section is a keen disap
pointment to those who had been led
to expect something unusual in this
department. The title page is good,
but as much cannot be said for the
contents. Where the jokes are not
too personal they are too weak.
On the whole the tqoB "Quad' is an
excellent production and Editor E. J.
Hadley and his staff arc to be con
gratulated on the culmination of their
efforts.
