With the exception of the usual
Commencement number, tonight's is
sue is the last appearance of the
"Daily Palo Alto" for the present
semester. At the close of his term
of office the editor has only words
of thanks for the support which he
has received from the staff and the
Student Body at large. The staff has
worked hard and faithfully and what
ever efficiency the paper may have
attained under the present regime, is
in no small measure due to their
efforts. The Student Body has co
operated with the"Daily Palo Alto"
in a way which leaves nothing to he
desired, and it has been both a privi
lege and pleasure to work for it.
During the past semester the paper
has appeared on an average earlier
than ever before and with the present
mechanical equipment and efficient
force of the University Press, there
is no reason why this desirable state
of affairs should not continue. The
innovation of Saturday evening edi
tions to cover important Campus
events has also succeeded, and these
extras should be made a regular fea
ture in years to come.
The other innovation of the year—
that of student managership—has
proved an unqualified success. Mr.
Cunha has brought the paper through
the year in good financial condition
and with the experience thus gained,
the"Daily Palo Alto'' should be ca
pably managed next semester.
Mr. Delano, who succeeds to tin 1
editorial position, is well qualified by

his three years' service 011 the staff,
and in his hands the"Daily Palo
Alto'' will undoubtedly be a credit
both to its staff and to Stanford Uni
versity.
