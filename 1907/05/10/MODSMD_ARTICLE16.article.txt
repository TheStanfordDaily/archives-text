# INN HAS A GOOD YEAR
## SHELTON BROTHERS WILL IMPROVE SERVICE. Success of Experiment Which Has Helped to Solve Eating Problem on Campus. 
### 
The Shelton brothers, who have
been running the University Inn for
the past semester, report that it has
been a successful semester in every
respect. They have had between 120
and 130 boarders. They have catered
for the '08 Prom., the Faculty and
Ncstoria, and have run the track and
crew training tables.
When the Sheltons took the Inn
it was merely as a speculation and
as such it has been necessary for them
to figure more closely this year than
they will in the future. Next se
mester the table and service will be
greatly improved as a result of the
experience which the Sheltons have
had this year. Individual service will
be substituted for the club service
which has been used heretofore and
ice cream will be served at different
times during each week.
Many places have already been re
served and others wishing to make
reservations can do so by speaking
to either of the Shelton brothers.
W. C. Shelton, '08, head of the firm,
will make a study of the commissary
departments of the large hotels of
Southern California this summer.
