# CREW READY FOR TRIP
## BOATING MEN WILL LEAVE ON 17TH. Sausalito Course Will Probably be Used Again Next Year for Intercollegiate Event. 
### 
With just one week of training be
fore leaving on their Northern trip
the Varsity crew is getting back into
the perfect shape which characterized
their condition just previous to the
Intercollegiate. With the exception
of Conant, who has been out for a
couple of days with a strained side,
the men are all in fine condition and
have not had to go through the pre
liminary gruelling work of taking
off superfluous weight. It is rumored
that in the North the Washington
supporters are extremely confident of
victory in the coming event.
The men who will probably make
the trip are as follows: F. Zimmer
man, '07, captain; R. H. Conant, '08,
stroke; L. R. Gay, '08; A. N. Cole, '08;
A. B. Shutts, '09; H. Wondries, '08;
J. A. Huston, '10; F. W. Turner, '08;
J. W. Fitting, '10; H. B. Patrick, '10;
R. H. Reynolds, '10; and Coach Mur
phy-
'l he men will leave 011 the morning
of the 17th, and will arrive in the
North in time for eight or nine days
training on the course on Lake Wash
ington. There will undoubtedly be
several opportunities for other races
with Northern crews and arrange
ments will probably be made even
after the crcw has arrived, in the
North.
How long the team will be gone
is a matter of doubt as the schedule
will not be definitely arranged until
the men are on the ground. The trip
will, however, not be a long one as
most of the members have definite
arrangements made for at least part
of the summer.
There has been much adverse criti
cism as to the success of boating
on the Coast here, it being claimed
that there are no suitable courses
over which regattas can be success
fully held. In this connection it is
interesting to note that the races
between Yale and West Point were
called off for the same reason which
made the postponement of the In
tercollegiate nccessary two Saturdays
ago, namely rough weather. Experts
have pronounced the course at Sau
salito an almost ideal one. The
only objection is that in the after
noon the wind is liable to roughen
the water too much for racing. In
the mornings, at which time the raccs
will be held after this, the bay is ex
ceedingly smooth.
