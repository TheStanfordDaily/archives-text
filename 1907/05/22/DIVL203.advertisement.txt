Inside Property at Suburban Prices
Clara Vista addition
One of the most sightly places in
Palo Alto, as the name will indicate.
There is now being built on this
beautiful tract a handsome building
for the Harker School. This prop
erty is being improved by way of
curbing, sidewalk and water. The
lots are 50x155 feet to a 15-foot alley,
and are to be sold for $12 per foot
â€”15 per cent down, and the balance
in thirty equal payments, with interest
at the rate of 7 per cent per annum. J
No taxes.
Blocks 47 and 48
Are now being subdivided and im
proved by way of sidewalks, curbing,
water and sewer. The location of
these blocks is on the north side of
Middlefield road, with a beautiful view
of the mountains. This property is
being put on the market as low as
$15 per foot.
Block 88
We have something like a dozen
lots unsold in this block that are be
ing offered for sale at $12 per foot,
including walk, curbing, sewer and
water. We also have eight lots in
block 98 at the same price per foot.
College Terrace
College Terrace is the nearest prop
erty to the Stanford University that
will ever be offered for sale. Lots are
being sold in this tract as low as $8
per foot. Any one who desires to be
so near to the University, there is
nothing cheaper to be offered in this
vicinity.
It will be found that the lots that
are offered for sale are better values
from $100 to $150 per lot, with the
same conditions as to walk, curbing,
sewer and water, than anything else
that can be bought in town.
Building restrictions go with the
above-mentioned property. Not less
than $1,500 cottages are to be built,
and to be put fifteen feet back of the
property line.
