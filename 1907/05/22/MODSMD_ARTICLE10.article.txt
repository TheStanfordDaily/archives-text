1907, one of the greatest classes
that ever entered Stanford, graduates
today, and it is with heartfelt regret
that the University bids the graduate
Godspeed. The members of that
class have lived through four of the
most interesting years of Stanford
history. Athletically, these years
have been golden, and the final year
of complete varsity victory was a fit
ting close to the career of a great
athletic class. The relations of the
Student Body with the Faculty have
not been all that could be desired
since 1907 entered the University, but
the members leave with an abiding
conviction that the period of misun
derstanding is over forever.
If the departing members of 1907
are as true to their trusts in the outer
world as they have been to their
Alma Mater, socicty has been en
riched by their graduation today.
