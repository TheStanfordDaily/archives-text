# Social Service Club Inaugurates New Movement
## 
### 
The first practical fruit of the
work of the Stanford Social Service
Club during the past year was offer
ed to the students of the University
and to friends of Stanford at large,
on Memorial Day. The establish
ment of a rural settlement in the
near vicinity of the University and
under the direction of the Stanford
Social Service Club, was the work
which the Club announced itself as
ready to institute as its fitting ob
servance of the twentieth anniver
sary of the laying of the University
cornerstone.
Stanford has been to all who have
looked to her as their Alma Mater,
a great literal favor-showering insti
tution amongst whose greatest gifts
to her children must ever be counted
the awakening in them of the reali
zation "noblese oblige." That the
work which the Stanford Social
Service has put its back to, there
fore, will find the loyalty of every
Stanford man and woman with it, is
not to be doubted. Not that this
undertaking is intended in any way
to become a further drain on the
already heavily taxed resources of
Stanford students, but that a gener
ous spirit, a willing hand and an un
selfish interest are looked for from
all who are interested in the work
and who cannot perhaps add very
materially to the financial status
of the settlement work.
The circular of announcement
which put the scheme of the Stan
ford Junior settlement before the
University on Memorial Day, sums
up the plea of the proposed insti
tution as follows:
"The settlement will be for the
care and education of unfortunate
children from twelve to fifteen years
of age, to be drawn from existing
settlements in San Francisco. The
home will be in charge of a Stan
ford graduate as matron, and she
will be assisted by undergraduate
students, resident in the home, or
giving help each day. It is proposed
to add to the public school teaching
manual and practical training, the
theory of settlement being to make
its wards useful and self-reliant
members of society.
We recommend this plan to Stan
ford men and women, and to friends
of Stanford the world over. In this
admirable project the Stanford Spir
it interprets itself in terms of social
service. To take unfortunate city
children out of their unhappy en
vironment. to shave with them this
lovely situation, and to give them
time and thought and attention is
worthy of the higher life and the
true spirit of the University.
The early work of the settlement
will be carried on a very modest
scale, the idea being to begin with
only a half dozen children and in

rented premises until the work has
proven itself practicable and suc
cessful, when it is expected that a
permanent home and grounds of its
own may be the inheritance of the
settlement, and that the care of per
haps ten or a dozen children may be
undertaken.
In order to secure the legal guar
dianship of children coming into the
rural setlement from existing set
tlements in the city or elsewhere, it
will be necessary to have the club
incorporate early next fall, at which
time the matter of supervision and
control will be more fully organized.
At present the club has set itself
the preliminary task of raising about
three thousand dollars to cover the
cost of original equipment for the
work and running expenses for a
year. Until this sum Is raised the
club will not feel itself justified in
starting the settlement. As was fit
ting with the spirit of the scheme,
the first few hundred dollars of this
sum was raised in the course of a
few days, among Stanford students
interested in the movement. The re
mainder is to be secured during the
summer, either through the special
committees appointed in different
parts of the state, or through the ef
forts of individual members, among
friends of social service everywhere.
Life membership in the Stanford
Junior Settlement is held at fifty
dollars —annual membership at five.
The club hoiies that donations in
kind may be secured from many mer
chants who would not care to give
in money and that much of the in
itial equipment, of the home may be
provided for in this way.
The Stanford Junior Settlement
will be the undergraduate end of
Stanford Social Service expression,
a fine and disinterested endeavor of
Stanford students for others. In
time it expects to see as its comple
ment, and as the special protege of
the Stanford city alumni, a working
city settlement in San Francisco.
Meanwhile through the members
of the district committees—P. R.
Faymonville, San Francisco; T. R.
Cadwalader, Southern Committee; J.
R. Holman, Northern Committee and
through Mr. L. S. Walbridge, chair
man of committees or Miss Davids,
French, secretary—any information
regarding the more detailed plan of
the work can be learned.
The project is commended to all
Stanford men and women as worthy
of their serious consideration and in
terest in the hope that they will all
plan their part in awakening interest
wherever they may be during the
summer, in this the most unselfish and
fine-spirited undertaking which Stan
ford students have ever set them
selves to realize.
