# London Assurance Produced.
## 
### 
Senior Week began Thursday night
with the production of "London As
surance." The acting was the best
seen on the Stanford stage in several
years, but as much cannot be said for
the play itself.
The general verdict was that the
committee had been unfortunate in
the choice of the production. The
plot is comparatively simple, the ac
tion slow and the dialogues tire
so mc 1 y prolonged and frequently

without any great pith or point. Tt
would possibly convulse a London
audience, but was scarcely calculated
to raise any great amount of mirth
among American university students.
Those taking part in the perfor
mance made the best possible show
ing which the opportunities of the
play permitted, but were engaged in
a rather hopeless task. The costum
ing and stage settings were well ar
ranged and several very pretty stage
effects were secured.
