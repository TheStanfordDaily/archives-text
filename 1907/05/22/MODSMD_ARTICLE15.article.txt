President David Starr Jordan's final
words of advice to the graduates were
read by Dr. J. M. Stillman, Acting
President of the University.

With No Mark or Brand.
David Starr Jordan.
In the sixteen years of the life of
Stanford University, I have done my
part on as many Commencement days,
I have passed through my hands
nearly twenty-live hundred diplomas,
greetings to as many men and women,
children of promise, who have gonj
forth from Stanford, into a world of
hope and joy, carrying with them, for
a time at least, the secret of perpetual
youth.
The class of 1907 is the latest, but
not the least, of this series. I shall
not take part in its graduation, fo.'
011 its hopeful Commencement day, I
am due to reach a far-away city, the
city of Brisbane, 011 my mission of
carrying Stanford ideals and Stanford
experiences to the universities of the
Antipodes.
But, while not with you in person
I shall be with you in spirit, and ]
shall not spare you the moral lesson
with which it has been the Stanford
custom to send forth its college
classes. And my text shall be drawn
from the experiences of a cattleman
and a circumstance connected with
his annual round-up.
It is said that in the early days in
Texas, Mr. Samuel Maverick owned
a ranch so rock-bound that his cattle
could not get out of it; so they were
never mixed up with the cattle be
longing to any one else. For this
reason Mr. Maverick put no mark o:
brand upon his calves. After this
whenever the cowboys found a steer
or a calf which had escaped the rodeo
at the round-up, they would say, "This
is one of Maverick's." And thus, by
the law of association, the name Mav
erick has come to be applied to the
ownerless steer wherever lie may be
found—the calf that hasn't any mas
ter. And to be a Maverick would be
a desirable condition if in our state
of society a steer were permitted to
own himself, to be his own steer with
110 other mark or brand on him. But
as even in the most favored lands a
steer has no rights except as property,
being a maverick has its disadvan
tages. But even in the most favored
lands, there are millions of men as
thoroughly owned by other men or
by other groups of men, as are any
Texas steers. Already the man who
merely owns himself is regarded in
some quarters as a maverick, and
names still worse sounding are often
applied to him. My plea this mor
ning is for the human maverick, —for
the man who is free born, with no
man's brand or tag upon him, —as the
hope of free institutions in America.
In this spirit, Abraham Lincoln
once described himself as a man of
such and such a height and weight,
a hater of slavery, and "with 110 other
mark or brand upon him." What he
did, he did because he was a man,
his own man, Abraham Lincoln's man,
not because he was a Republican, a
Presbyterian, a free mason, an odd
fellow, or a trade unionist, or any

other sort of "ist". Still less was his
impulse to action found in the will
of any man, politician or corporation
who owned him body and soul. And
so Lincoln stood as a fact in Ameri
can history, a reincarnation of the
spirit of the fathers, an individual
power making for equality before the
law; for equal justice and equal op
portunity, the equal right of each man
to make his own bargain with his own
fate; that sort of equality which for
ever creates inequality. The best
men make always the best bargains.
In a recent address I had occasion
to refer to a question once asked by
Guizot of James Russell Lowell, "How
long will this Republic endure?"
Lowell's reply was, "So long as the
ideals of the fathers are dominant in
the hearts of the people." These
ideals are found in the spirit of indi
vidual freedom, the freedom of the
man who looks down on 110 one as
his inferior in caste, and who looks
up to 110 one as his superior by birth;
the freedom of the man who is ade
quate to frame his own opinions and
to shape his own deeds; the freedom
of the man who fights 110 battles un
der the blind dictation of the bo<s or
of the mob. The creators of free
states were freemen who met on
equals to guarantee equal opportunity,
and the spirit of the fathers is still
with their frceborn sons.
Our next question is this: "How
long will the ideals of the fathers be
dominant in the hearts of the people
of the United States?" And this is
the plain answer: "So long as the
blood of the fathers flows in the veins
of our people; not alone the blood of
the pilgrims of Devon and Somerset,
the first builders of free states, but
the blood of freeborn men, of what
ever race, the blood of him that over
cometh, the religious, political, and
economic maverick of every type, who
goes Into the struggle of life with no
man's mark or brand upon him.
"America means opportunity." This
is Emerson's word. It means oppor
tunity for the man to find the work
he can do; for the work to be done
to find the man who can do it. Amer
ica means opportunity, not because of
its broad acres, its boundless forests
the generosity of its soil, its hazards
of mining and its chances for trade.
To seek out these natural sources of
wealth, and these alone, is merely e<
ploitation. The man who comes to
exploit remains to be exploited. The
veal opportunity of America is the
chance that was given by the rock
ribbed Massachusetts hills, the chance
to be a man, the chance to own one's
self, the chance to direct one's own
culture, to have the benefit of one's
own efficiency. The easy prosperity
of America has obscured the one real
ity in American life, the freedom of
the man to be his own man. We
have thrown off the burden of caste,
and we have been richly rewarded for
it; but the real reward is paid in term*:
of individual freedom, not with the
treasures of an exploited continent
These would have gone to the first
comer, whether bond or free.
And now, after a century and a
quarter of freedom, we discover that
there are millions among us who arc
not free, who never have been and

who never will be free. In our gen
erosity toward the downtrodden of
every nation, we have admitted with
the oppressed, the causes of their op
pression. We find that the quaran
tine has not been rigid enough to
shut out the problems of caste-ridden
and war-worn Europe. In a country
where, by the very nature of things,
there should be no proletariat at all,
where an unskilled or incompetenr
laborer should be an anomaly, we find
the man 011 the street discussing the
proletariat and the bourgeoise, just as
these are made in the institutions of
Europe. We find the man who has
the earnings of his strong arm ar
rayed in class struggle against the
man who lives 011 past accumulations,
or with the man between the tw >
who borrows capital, hires laborers,
and lives by his wits, while the right?
of the freeborn maverick, who is
neither employer nor employed, are
trampled in the dust by all three.
Meanwhile our city governments
grow corrupt. The systematic or
ganization of the promoters of dis
sipation and individual decay out
weighs all other single forces in our
municipal affairs. Our corporations
grow less careful of the interests of
the individual man, and our laborer*
arc more and more prone to steal
their own time and to fall back on
class aid and class feeling for ad
vancement rather than to rely on in
dividual duty.
And all this raises the question:
Arc we really ourselves? Our form
of government is fitted for freeborn
men. It is ill-adapted to exigencies
of the .saloon vote, the German vote,
the Negro vote, the Polish vote, the
labor vote, and the vote controlled by
the agents of the great corporations
Meanwhile our ports arc crowded
with the proletaria of Europe. The
"beaten men of the beaten races" find
no obstacle in their way to American
citizenship. Science assures us that
"like the seed is the harvest." In so
far as these men have failed because
they lacked in brains, courage, and
conscience, their successors in Amer
ica will show like characl er.-. Al
ready many of our people ate dis
posed to look forward to the ideal
of perfect slavery—of the subjection
of the individual anywhere and every
where to the mass —as the best es
cape from our present condition, half
slave, half free. The union of the
states could not exist on these terms
On these same terms we cannot hav?
a stable condition of society.
The masses of Europe arc soon
assimilated, we say. Our great conn
try soon digests all that comes. By
that we mean that the foreigner is
soon lost in the mass. The secon !
generation speaks our language, wears
our sweat-shop clothing, votes as wc
vote, and to the man on the street
looks like a procession of real Ameri
cans. But the breed does not change
in one generation, nor in a hundre I
Admitting that certain types of Eu
ropean immigrants arc inferior iii
stock to the original Anglo-Saxon,
their descendents will always be
equally inferior. Tf the parents at
home were content to be coolies, o<*
slaves, or weaklings of one sort or
another, their descendents will be of

the same class, despite the disguise of
language or clothing. Whole races of
men were born to be exploited, but
woe to the nation that exploits them.
The true moral of Sinclair's story
of the Jungle is not that Chicago
meats are foul, nor yet that the work
men could or should control the
packing houses; nor yet that these
houses should be the equal property
of all citizens of Illinois. The moral
is found in the danger to free institu
tions of the presence of hordes of
people who are not and cannot be
free, people who crowd the slums of
great cities, who cannot take care of
their own rights, and whose descend
ents, modified in some degree by
American education, are yet at bot
tom, the same defenseless stock.
We hear sometimes the argument
against Asiatic immigration, that these
Asiatic people cannot be assimilated.
I his is doubtless a valid reason for
not desiring their presence. But it
may be that far greater danger lie
in the presence of races which seem
to be assimilated but are not. The
hopeless feature of the negro problem
in the South lies in the fact that the
African is not a clearly defined entity,
it lies in the fact that more than half
of those called negro arc already as
similated to the social standards of
the whites; half white in blood, two
thirds white in character, and all
white in language and in aspirations.
The pure negro has no pressing negro
problem neither has the immigrant
Chinaman, so long as he remains Ch
nese. A quart of shot thrown into a
bucket of water does not soil the
water as much as a quart of sand;
for the sand is more readily assim
ilated, and a quart of clay still mor->
1 he problem of the European pro
letariat does not disappear with the
loss of the immigrant's language or
the change of his dress. If his stock
is bad, it stays bad; still worse, if it
mixes with the stock of freeborn
races, for it leaves upon this stock
a mulatto taint. The highest patriot
ism is that which looks to the welfare
of the future. The question is not,
"Do the industries of the United
States need a great accession of cheap
laborers?" Without a doubt they do
need it, and this need is felt every
where in every branch of industry.
The real question is, "How long will
our free institutions stand the flood
of weak immigrants?" We may freely
admit that the common laborers of
Europe arc not all of weak stock.
In some countries these furnish the
best of material. The badness is in
proportion to the strength of the
caste system, to the perfection of
the machinery which separates the
blood of the strong from that of the
weak. The strength of England anJ
Scotland is largely due to the impel*
fection of the machinery of caste.
The law of primogeniture casts back
with each generation a portion of the
nobility into the mass of commoners.
There is scarcely an English farmer
who has not the blood of the Planta
gencts flowing in his veins. There is
scarcely a Russian mowjik who ha
not been a mowjik since tribal life
began. The tragedy of the shems is
