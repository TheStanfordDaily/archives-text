# Eloquent Baccalaurate Sermon Preached by President G.C. Gates of Pomona College
## 
### 
Sunday morning the graduates lis
tened to the following eloquent Bac
calaureate sermon delivered by Pres
ident George C. Gates, of Pomona
College.
"No man hath seen God at any
time; the . . . Son . . . hath
declared Him."—John 1 :iB.
"He that hath seen Me hath seen
the Father." —John 14:9.
In the endeavor to speak a Gospel
word this morning, the preacher as
sumes that all men would see God;
at least for the intellectual satisfac
tion of konwing what He is like; at
most to yield Him worship and loy
alty.
Preliminary to all mature thinking
is a firm grasp of the fact of the lim
itations of the human mind. There is
perhaps no surer evidence of a rightly
growing mind, than the conviction,
deepening with every adding year, of
how littTe we know. Men of the true
student spirit always recognize this.
For those who try to do a bit of
honest thinking, there is no saner
exercise than patient dwelling amid
the infinite reaches of our ignorance.
The dogmatist in every realm has
ever less standing among thoughtful
people. In the realm of Physical
Science he not only has no influence:
he gets little hearing. It is not ex
traordinary that in the one realm
where modesty should most prevail,
viz., in philosophy, and above all the
philosophy of religion, precisely there
dogmatism should seem to have flour
ished. The man "who knows it all"
is an appearance sorry enough any
where; but it is a dreadful figure he
cuts in religion.
Take just a glance at limitations
easily evident to us, of our physical
senses. The dogmatist imagines that
when he rubs open his sleepy eyes,
lie sees what is going on! But, of the
vibrations of visual sort, we arc shut
up to those between four hundred mil
lions of millions per second and seven
or eight hundred millions of millions
per second. There are laboratory
means of picking up a few more
at either end of these bounds. But
the practically infinite number of
other vibrations arc as total darkness
to all our seeing or all our knowledge.
The telescope in one direction, the
microscope in the other reach out into
the two infinities of great and small
till the ability of the instruments and
of the mind that uses them, alike van
ish into helplessness to go further
into the universes that lie beyond.
There have been invented by pa
tient physicists methods of guessing
with fair certainty down beyond the
microscope, about molecules and ions
and atoms and corpuscles, and elec
trons and at last to centers of en
ergy; so far beyond the mind's com
prehension in minuteness that we
stagger in our ignorance of what is
there.
In our chemistry what goes 011?
We pour and weigh and mix, carcful
for our lives not to mix wrong,—and
watch what? To see "what goes on ?
Nay verily: not within measureless
reaches of it. Only the fumes and
smoke reach us rising from the far
distant battles of the cohorts of the

infinitely little. The real "goings on"
we may guess at, and test our guesses
till by and by we may guess fairly
right, perhaps! We "see" nothing!
So of all the other senses, hearing,
tasting, smelling, feeling.
We have only five chief senses any
how; and they pick up only a trilling
number of the vibrations appropriate
to each. How rich in vision and col
ors, in tone and harmonies might be
life, if we had senses attuned to catch
the other waves, —and yet others! So
we seem shut within narrow limits
when we seek footsteps of God with
physical senses, or in the realm of
what we have been calling "physical
nature."
So it is no wonder that at the be
ginning of the great evangel, the
Gospel of that thoughtful and rev
erent see-er of visions, whom we know
as the apostle John, we find him clear
ing the way by that desert wind of
negation: "No man hath seen God at
any time." It is like that word at
the heart of perhaps the greatest
poem of hope of modern times, In
Memoriam: "Behold, we know not
anything."
But there would be no light except
against darkness; so it is over against
the background of human limitations
and ignorance that the light of ration
al faith beams steadiest.
Nevertheless there are three main
trials up the range of thought, lead
ing toward the summit of spiritual
perception of God:
1. The study of the physical con
stitution of things; Nature.
2. The study of what men have
thought out and wrought out and
even fought out; History.
3. The path proclaimed and trodden
by the Son of God, who oftinies called
himself the Son of Man; Jesus.
1. The revelation through nature.
Nowadays the student of the Physical
Sciences is coming upon traces some
what new and strange among the
phenomena of the laboratories. They
are traces of that for which we have
no other name than "spirit."
Some of the greatest preaching
places of a spiritual philosophy of the
Universe today are not only the pul
pits and the philosophical lecture
rooms, but the chemical and physical
laboratories. Behold the change!
Forty years ago these places were
often counted the strongholds of athe
ism or at least physicism. Nowadays
the greatest scientists are preaching
in tones that command hearing, that
the bottom fact of all that is, is not
matter but spirit; not passivity but
action; not rest but motion; not force
but will; not inertia but purpose; not
death but life. From his reverent
study and work with plants that truly
great man Luther Burbank has
wrought out, not from books and the
schools, but from living touch, this
superb truth in his own phrase: "The
Universe is not half living and half
dead, but all alive." The heart of all
that is, is not dead stuff but living
spirit,—in the last analysis, the power
of intelligent will, the only power we
directly know. Physics has gone thus
way down, i. c., up, into Metaphysics.
Out of the laboratories of Chemistry,
Physics and Biology, are coming mod
ern theories of energy and life, quite

as metaphysical as physical. This is
as the words physics and metaphysics
would have long ago predicted, if
we had been shrewd enough to per
ceive it.
May be, if we can be brave and pa
tient to use with even a little wisdom
the senses we have, the Universe is
rich enough to open out to us, when
we shall have gone hence beyond the
limitations of this body, through other
senses, riches which we cannot re
motely imagine now. Why not? Do
we think the Universe has exhausted
itself in making poor little us? Could
anything be more stupidly conceited
than that? And the Universe has
plenty of room and plenty of time.
Maybe then we, as spirit, may travel
as freely and quickly to Saturn or
Orion as we all went thither in
thought just then, when the names
were spoken. Is our thought, that
actually traveled thus, less real than
our body? Why is it so hard for us
to believe that our spirit, i.e. we,
are more nearly after the analogy of
thought than like this evanescent
flesh?
So by and by we may rise along
this trail of nature to that mountain
top of vision when Paul spoke: "God
is all and in all." Such is the founda
tion that is builded in our day under
neath the feet of faith. But, is that
all we have for faith? It is much: It
is not enough.
2. The revelation through history.
There is another likely hunting
ground for appearances of God:
namely, in the hearts and lives of men
as history, meagerly indeed but some
what, discloses that life. That is a
great word that the great metaphysi
cian named Paul once used when he
said, "God hath not left himself with
out a witness." There is no time for
even a glance at the long climb of
human achievement. I will mention
one recent change of view-point which
is in the way of enlargement.
Within a month I have heard one
of the ablest missionaries I ever knew
refer to the idol worship that is in the
world as worthy in many of its as
pects, because it is the struggle among
the best of these peoples to express
the hunger of their souls for the very
best they know. It is the reaching
out of such measure of the divine as
is in them for the fuller vision of the
perfectly divine; it is groping in the
dim light of their little faith for that
light which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world. Poor and
superstitious and blind indeed is much
of the religion of the world, but that
kind of poverty and blindness arc
merely relative terms. Would any
one of us dare to say that his light
is as the full day? Certainly when it
comes to personal life and conduct
our boasted Christian civilization has
been taking 011 some modesty of
teachership. A great lesson came to
our proud civilization when Japan
taught the people of the West who
had studied and practiced the arts of
war for a thousand years, some of
the first principles of hygiene and
of all-round physical welfare of armies
in the field. There are, moreover,
few representatives of heathen and
savage nations that do not learn some
strange lessons in bad manners when

they come among us civilized people.
This new attitude of the Christian
world toward the rest of the world
bespeaks great gains not yet far won
for the Christion spirit. So that there
is coming about here, a new relation
of all peoples of earth with each
other, a saner and more restful view
of the unity of life of the race. This
change of attitude toward other peop
les is one more fact contributory to
ward that movement of our time look
ing to the doing away of the horridest
anachronism of modern times, —
human war.
As in the physical constitution of
the Universe, there is a new feeling
of patient continuity in all that is;
so in life and history the on-going
of affairs is less of administration,
more an orderly and clean-cut devel
opment ; all is less mechanical and
more vital; all is less a government,
more a home; it is more like the spirit
of man growing through the millen
iums into its own, realizing its divine
inheritance.
So from Nature and History, we
have been latterly learning much more
of God than we ever knew before.
Great visions have been coming to
men along these lines of what God
might be, if there only were any God
more than Nature and History. It
is not to be wondered at that a rev
erent Pantheism has strong hold on
many fine minds, for there is great
truth therein. Rather dull of per
ception is lie in the world of scholar
ship, who is blind to the truth. But
is all that enough? It is indeed
much; is it enough?
As over against the storm of life's
temptations, under the strain of which
men all around us are going down in
battalions, temptations carnal, tempo
ral, commercial, cheap;—over against
taint of will, clamor of flesh, pull of
convention, shadows of doubt, silence
of graves,—the human heart cries out,
if it be still human and not yet dead
ened, —for a word, a voice, an assur
ance, that can be spoken by 110 phil
osophy, or science, or poetry or
preaching, or creed, or institution or
organization or book.
Can this Universe hear me when I
call amid the press of life or dull
emptiness of death? Hath it earsf
Will it answer?
In the full flush of youthful health
and hope it may be easy to pass such
questions by. But, believe me, there
will come times when the soul de
mands reality or nothing! There are
experiences in life when 110 pretty
conceits, no analogies of flowers and
butterflies, no measurements of lab
oratories, no traditions out of the
past will suffice! All these can seem
to man in some moods but the mock
ery of his despairs, a painted picture
of bread to save from starvation.
3. The revelation in Jesus.
The message of the Christian pulpit
is that the Universe has spoken, in
one supreme Voice. In many Voices
indeed: in one above all others. The
eternal spirit has translated all words
into one human Word: when the
Word was made flesh and dwelt
among us in familiar form, called by
the name of Jesus. God has spoken
once in the Universal language—the
