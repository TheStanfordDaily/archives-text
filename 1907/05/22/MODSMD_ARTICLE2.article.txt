## 
### 
The class day exercises were for
mally opened by President J. M.
Ward in the following speech:
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me great pleasure to ex
tend to you, 011 behalf of the class of
1907, a hearty welcome to these fes
tivities celebrating the Sixteenth An
nual Commencement of this Univer
sity. We feel honored by your pres
ence, and hope that your participation
in the various affairs of the week may
be most pleasant.
This occasion is the goal toward
which the class of '07 has been striv
ing for four years, and naturally
brings with it a certain degree of
pleasure and satisfaction: pleasure in
being honored with the Stanford de
gree, its value increased by the asso
ciations with it; satisfaction in know
ing that the honor has been earned.
But the joyousness of such an occa
sion is always tinged with a feeling
also of regret, and so with us. We
feel a deep regret upon leaving the
scenes of the four years so pleasantly
spent within these walls.
The class of 1907 takes a pardon
able pride in what it has done for
the University, but seemingly in pro
portion to its achievements has it
been the recipient of favors at the
hands of our Alma Mater. A patient
and efficient faculty have given us
their best. We have had the good
fellowship and lasting friendship of
our fellow students. And so we can
express only gratitude to faculty and
student body alike, for after all it is
not merely study that equips the col- |
lege graduate, but rather studying
under men, and mingling with men. I
Let future additions to faculty and j
student body be men, strong and ac- .
tive, and the future of Stanford will
never be in doubt. A true Stanford
man must be a man to begin with.
The class of 1907 has witnessed a j
most severe test of the Stanford
spirit. Tt has seen that Stanford
spirit emerge from the test stronger !
than ever. And as its members go ,
forth to make the name of their Uni
versity they go forth strong in the
new Stanford spirit. The name of
our University is still in the making, j
Tt devolves upon the graduates of this
Commencement season, as it has de- j
volved upon graduates of former
years, and as it will devolve upon
graduates to come, to see to it that (
they do their share toward the mak- |
ing of the good name of their Alma j
Mater.
And just a word of appreciation. !
The festivities of this week are the !
result of the efforts, not of one indi- j
vidual, nor of the whole class, but of a |
few members who have spared neither ,
time nnr labor in making our Com- j
mencement a success. On behalf of 1
the class, T desire to thank them for I
their efficient work and invaluable '
service.

j The class history, a very accurate
and interesting account of the career
of 1907 was delivered as follows, by
L. M. Edwards:
The day is nearly done; in the dim
light of our waning sun we are
j gathered to rejoice in the memories
I of our achievements. The past rises
before us like a dream. We see the
eager freshman class as it enters the
domain of its new home, filled with
the enthusiasm of the new life, the
transformation of the untried youth
j into the seasoned athlete, the stu
-1 dent into the scholar, the boy into
the man. And it is the history of
this development that is so dear to
us, and to each single achievement
we point with pride, and through it
all the trace the motto of our cless,
"success."
It is impossible for us to measure
our success in the scholastic field.
There is no criterion by which we
may judge the benefits that we have
derived. For four years we have re
ceived the careful attention of a con
siderate faculty. We have had
opened to us the portals of learning
and only time will prove our worthi
ness, but if our future may be meas
ured by our achievements in other
activities in college, the final day of
reckoning will find us loyal to and
worthy of our Alma Mater.
In athletics our fame will long
linger in the memory of Stanford
men. Naught seven will stand out
as the class of the Lanagan epoch.
For four years we have been under
his regime, and well we have proven
worthy of his care, for no Lanagan
team, football or baseball, upon
which a '07 man played, has known
defeat. Entering in the fall of '03,
we became the first charge of a new
coach. Characteristic of freshmen
teams we inspired but little confi
dence in the Student Body, but when
we went into our first intercollegi
ate contest '07 proved to have the
strongest freshman team ever seen
at Stanford, and we won the first
victory for Jimmie Lanagan, 12-0.
Captain Stott, Weller, Dole, Molfino,
Kelly and Morrow made a lasting im
pression on Berkeley. Then came the
times before the big game. With a
victorious veteran team, flushed with
the victory of the previous year, Cal
ifornia met the first Lanagan team,
and although the game resulted in a
tie, it was a virtual victory for Stan
ford, and in this game Jim Weller
and Chalmers were powerful fac
tors. Tn our sophomore year we
journeyed to Berkeley to play on the
new field, and the grand victory of
1 R-0 lowered the banners of Califor
nia deep into the dust. And in this
game '07 furnished the quarterback
who generaled, the fullback who
smashed his way, and the halfback
who carried the ball over for all
three touchdowns. Stott, Weller and
Chalmers were the strongest eombi-

I nation that ever twisted the tail of
| the Berkeley bear. And then the
game in our Junior year when we
had the distinction of captaining a
Varsity team. Our new field was to
be open for dedication, but the trust
of the Student Body was well placed
in Captain Chalmers, who led his
team to a glorious victory over the
Blue and Gold. Dole, Molfino and
Slusher were added to our list of
veterans. This year saw the first
Rugby team under a '07 captain, and
although the game was new and
somewhta unpopular, Captain Stott
led his team to victory, winning the
last intercollegiate football game of
the Lanagan epoch. Laumeister and
Edwards gained their letter in this
game. And now that we fire depart
ing, we leave to the college a new
field coach, George Presley, a man
who by his sterling qualities as an
athlete insures our future success.
In track we have seen two victo
ries out of three meets. In our
Freshman year Stanford won and in
this meet Macfarland brought honor
to his class in the low hurdles. Our
Sophomore year saw defeat, but sev
eral members from our class gained
their Varsity letter. In our Junior
year we had the honor of a track
captain from our class. This, our
Senior year, saw the track team
again under the lead of Macfarland.
With seven men '07 won the intcr
class meet, and in the intercollegiate
Macfarland, Elwell, McNeil, Nash
and Edwards aided in the great vic
tory.
In baseball we have had signal
.•success as a class, winning the inter
class championship for three years,
Chalmers, Rhyne and Presley cap
taining the victorious teams, Burtis,
Topp, Davis, Stagner, Kelly, Salis
bury, Morrow and McLain furnish
ing the makeup of the teams. Tn
Varsity baseball we have had men
from our first year, and this year an
07 captain, Presley, broke the base-!
bill hoodoo and won the first vic
tory that Stanford has seen in base
ball for years.
A naught seven captain has never
known defeat in intercollegiate ath
letics and in this our senior year,
Stanford has won every intercolle
giate Varsity contest. Naught sev- J
en has broken the record, setting
a mark unsurpassed m the history I
of athletics between the two Uni-'
7ersities.
Miss Owen and Miss Gartzman
have taken prominent part in wo
men's athletes.
Boating, that new sport which
came into existence in our Fresh-1
man year, has had some of its most
enth iA»iastic supporters from our
class, and this year Captain Zimmer-:
man brought home the first victory
In intercollegiate eights.
Dramatics have felt the influence 1
of '07. 111 the Sophomore play we!

broke away from the traditions and
installed the tryout system for the
cast, which has proven to be a most
beneficial step in the development of
college dramatics. Ivellog, Ray,
Mansfield, Miss Pedlar and Miss
Moise brought great credit to their
class by their exceptional ability.
Our Junior Plug Ugly is of doubtful
standing. If the measure of a good
Plug Ugly is a rough house, ours was
a great success. The Junior Farce,
written by Bateman, received a well
merited reward, and brought out
new matertal from our class. Ward,
Bernard, Stewart, Miss Lyman and
Miss Officer have taken prominent
parts in the majority of college plays.
Journalism has received its share
of support from our class. To Karl
Bickel the class points with pride.
To his care was intrusted the editor
ship of the Quad and although the
the original Quad. TheD gz.Ws.
earthquake prevented the completion
of his labors, the subsequent record
book which was gotten out shows
the possibilities of the original Quad.
The Sequoia, under Bickel, was re
vived from the dusty shelves of ob
livion and changed from its petti
coat policy into a live and character
istic college publication, which ful
filled a long felt want of the student
body. In the words of Will Irwin,
editor of McClures magazine, "It is
the best college magazine published
today." The Daily Palo Alto receiv
ed its first '07 editor when Harvey
Peter Bittner received the editorial
quill from the hands of Allen, at a
time when the policy of the paper
was somewhat stormy.
Under Bittner's careful guidance, the
reign of peace was again established.
George Spurrier, our next editor,
conducted the paper with credit, and
during his editorship the paper be
came a product of the linotype, re
placing the old Ben Franklin meth
ods characteristic of its past.
Miss French, Miss Merrilies, Miss
Norvell and Miss Thoburn have con
tributed to college journalism.
Clift edited the Chaparral.
In debating we have had but lit
tle distinction. Tn our Sophomore
year, Fisher, Maloy and Everson won
the underclass debate. This year we
had an alternate on the Carnot team.
To the surprise of Phi Beta Kap
pa, we slipped a few members within
its sacred precincts, and one of them
was a varsity athlete. To Daily,
Rosenfeld, Hoagland, Holman, Roop,
and the Misses Phillipi, Stadmuller,
Hosford, Lumis, Polsom, Smith, Tho
burn, and McDowell, we are indebted
for this recognition of our scholastic
existence.
On the Glee Club, S. B. Thomp
son, as leader, A. B. Packard, presi
dent of combined clubs, with Crit
tenden, Macfarland and Bernard,
upheld the musical prestige of '07.
Our senior year has been a per
fect one, —success has met us on
every side, and all have conspired to
make our last year an auspicious
one. To the faculty we tender our
most sincere thanks for their unsel
fish devotion to our interests. They
have honored us by conferring upon
us the stamp of their approval, and
we in turn will strive to honor them.
Naught-eight we thank for their
friendship and good rivalry, and to
them we extend our most sincere
good wishes.
Members of the Class of '07, this
is the class of our class history. To
your individual efforts and enthusi
asms is due the high standard set
by our class. We are soon to part
from our Alma Mater and go our
ways into the world, but with you all
there should go this memory and in
spiration, that the class of Naught
seven stands for strong manhood,
true womanhood and success.

Varsity baseball we have had men

In intercollegiate eights.
Dramatics have felt the influence 1
of '07. 111 the Sophomore play we!

broke away from the traditions and
installed the tryout system for the
cast, which has proven to be a most
beneficial step in the development of
college dramatics. Ivellog, Ray,
Mansfield, Miss Pedlar and Miss
Moise brought great credit to their
class by their exceptional ability.
Our Junior Plug Ugly is of doubtful
standing. If the measure of a good
Plug Ugly is a rough house, ours was
a great success. The Junior Farce,
written by Bateman, received a well
merited reward, and brought out
new matertal from our class. Ward,

Our senior year has been a per
fect one, —success has met us on
every side, and all have conspired to
make our last year an auspicious
one. To the faculty we tender our
most sincere thanks for their unsel

have honored us by conferring upon
us the stamp of their approval, and
we in turn will strive to honor them.
Naught-eight we thank for their

Members of the Class of '07, this
is the class of our class history. To
your individual efforts and enthusi
asms is due the high standard set
by our class. We are soon to part
from our Alma Mater and go our
ways into the world, but with you all
there should go this memory and in
spiration, that the class of Naught
seven stands for strong manhood,
true womanhood and success.
The class day exercises were for
mally opened by President J. M.
Ward in the following speech:
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me great pleasure to ex
tend to you, 011 behalf of the class of
1907, a hearty welcome to these fes
tivities celebrating the Sixteenth An
nual Commencement of this Univer
sity. We feel honored by your pres
ence, and hope that your participation
in the various affairs of the week may
be most pleasant.
This occasion is the goal toward
which the class of '07 has been striv
ing for four years, and naturally
brings with it a certain degree of
pleasure and satisfaction: pleasure in
being honored with the Stanford de
gree, its value increased by the asso
ciations with it; satisfaction in know
ing that the honor has been earned.
But the joyousness of such an occa
sion is always tinged with a feeling
also of regret, and so with us. We
feel a deep regret upon leaving the
scenes of the four years so pleasantly
spent within these walls.
The class of 1907 takes a pardon
able pride in what it has done for
the University, but seemingly in pro
portion to its achievements has it
been the recipient of favors at the
hands of our Alma Mater. A patient
and efficient faculty have given us
their best. We have had the good
fellowship and lasting friendship of
our fellow students. And so we can
express only gratitude to faculty and
student body alike, for after all it is
not merely study that equips the col- |
lege graduate, but rather studying
under men, and mingling with men. I
Let future additions to faculty and j
student body be men, strong and ac- .
tive, and the future of Stanford will
never be in doubt. A true Stanford
man must be a man to begin with.
The class of 1907 has witnessed a j
most severe test of the Stanford
spirit. Tt has seen that Stanford
spirit emerge from the test stronger !
than ever. And as its members go ,
forth to make the name of their Uni
versity they go forth strong in the
new Stanford spirit. The name of
our University is still in the making, j
Tt devolves upon the graduates of this
Commencement season, as it has de- j
volved upon graduates of former
years, and as it will devolve upon
graduates to come, to see to it that (
they do their share toward the mak- |
ing of the good name of their Alma j
Mater.
And just a word of appreciation. !
The festivities of this week are the !
result of the efforts, not of one indi- j
vidual, nor of the whole class, but of a |
few members who have spared neither ,
time nnr labor in making our Com- j
mencement a success. On behalf of 1
the class, T desire to thank them for I
their efficient work and invaluable '
service.

j The class history, a very accurate
and interesting account of the career
of 1907 was delivered as follows, by
L. M. Edwards:
The day is nearly done; in the dim
light of our waning sun we are
j gathered to rejoice in the memories
I of our achievements. The past rises
before us like a dream. We see the
eager freshman class as it enters the
domain of its new home, filled with
the enthusiasm of the new life, the
transformation of the untried youth
j into the seasoned athlete, the stu
-1 dent into the scholar, the boy into
the man. And it is the history of
this development that is so dear to
us, and to each single achievement
we point with pride, and through it
all the trace the motto of our cless,
"success."
It is impossible for us to measure
our success in the scholastic field.
There is no criterion by which we
may judge the benefits that we have
derived. For four years we have re
ceived the careful attention of a con
siderate faculty. We have had
opened to us the portals of learning
and only time will prove our worthi
ness, but if our future may be meas
ured by our achievements in other
activities in college, the final day of
reckoning will find us loyal to and
worthy of our Alma Mater.
In athletics our fame will long
linger in the memory of Stanford
men. Naught seven will stand out
as the class of the Lanagan epoch.
For four years we have been under
his regime, and well we have proven
worthy of his care, for no Lanagan
team, football or baseball, upon
which a '07 man played, has known
defeat. Entering in the fall of '03,
we became the first charge of a new
coach. Characteristic of freshmen
teams we inspired but little confi
dence in the Student Body, but when
we went into our first intercollegi
ate contest '07 proved to have the
strongest freshman team ever seen
at Stanford, and we won the first
victory for Jimmie Lanagan, 12-0.
Captain Stott, Weller, Dole, Molfino,
Kelly and Morrow made a lasting im
pression on Berkeley. Then came the
times before the big game. With a
victorious veteran team, flushed with
the victory of the previous year, Cal
ifornia met the first Lanagan team,
and although the game resulted in a
tie, it was a virtual victory for Stan
ford, and in this game Jim Weller
and Chalmers were powerful fac
tors. Tn our sophomore year we
journeyed to Berkeley to play on the
new field, and the grand victory of
1 R-0 lowered the banners of Califor
nia deep into the dust. And in this
game '07 furnished the quarterback
who generaled, the fullback who
smashed his way, and the halfback
who carried the ball over for all
three touchdowns. Stott, Weller and
Chalmers were the strongest eombi-

I nation that ever twisted the tail of
| the Berkeley bear. And then the
game in our Junior year when we
had the distinction of captaining a
Varsity team. Our new field was to
be open for dedication, but the trust
of the Student Body was well placed
in Captain Chalmers, who led his
team to a glorious victory over the
Blue and Gold. Dole, Molfino and
Slusher were added to our list of
veterans. This year saw the first
Rugby team under a '07 captain, and
although the game was new and
somewhta unpopular, Captain Stott
led his team to victory, winning the
last intercollegiate football game of
the Lanagan epoch. Laumeister and
Edwards gained their letter in this
game. And now that we fire depart
ing, we leave to the college a new
field coach, George Presley, a man
who by his sterling qualities as an
athlete insures our future success.
In track we have seen two victo
ries out of three meets. In our
Freshman year Stanford won and in
this meet Macfarland brought honor
to his class in the low hurdles. Our
Sophomore year saw defeat, but sev
eral members from our class gained
their Varsity letter. In our Junior
year we had the honor of a track
captain from our class. This, our
Senior year, saw the track team
again under the lead of Macfarland.
With seven men '07 won the intcr
class meet, and in the intercollegiate
Macfarland, Elwell, McNeil, Nash
and Edwards aided in the great vic
tory.
In baseball we have had signal
.•success as a class, winning the inter
class championship for three years,
Chalmers, Rhyne and Presley cap
taining the victorious teams, Burtis,
Topp, Davis, Stagner, Kelly, Salis
bury, Morrow and McLain furnish

cast, which has proven to be a most
beneficial step in the development of
college dramatics. Ivellog, Ray,

Our Junior Plug Ugly is of doubtful

Plug Ugly is a rough house, ours was
a great success. The Junior Farce,
written by Bateman, received a well
merited reward, and brought out

years, and as it will devolve upon

j The class history, a very accurate
and interesting account of the career
of 1907 was delivered as follows, by
L. M. Edwards:
The day is nearly done; in the dim
light of our waning sun we are
j gathered to rejoice in the memories
I of our achievements. The past rises
before us like a dream. We see the
eager freshman class as it enters the
domain of its new home, filled with
the enthusiasm of the new life, the
transformation of the untried youth
j into the seasoned athlete, the stu
-1 dent into the scholar, the boy into
the man. And it is the history of
this development that is so dear to
us, and to each single achievement
we point with pride, and through it
all the trace the motto of our cless,
"success."
It is impossible for us to measure
our success in the scholastic field.
There is no criterion by which we
may judge the benefits that we have
derived. For four years we have re
ceived the careful attention of a con
siderate faculty. We have had
opened to us the portals of learning
and only time will prove our worthi
ness, but if our future may be meas
ured by our achievements in other
activities in college, the final day of
reckoning will find us loyal to and
worthy of our Alma Mater.
In athletics our fame will long
linger in the memory of Stanford
men. Naught seven will stand out
as the class of the Lanagan epoch.
For four years we have been under
his regime, and well we have proven
worthy of his care, for no Lanagan
team, football or baseball, upon
which a '07 man played, has known
defeat. Entering in the fall of '03,
we became the first charge of a new
coach. Characteristic of freshmen
teams we inspired but little confi
dence in the Student Body, but when
we went into our first intercollegi
ate contest '07 proved to have the
strongest freshman team ever seen
at Stanford, and we won the first
victory for Jimmie Lanagan, 12-0.
Captain Stott, Weller, Dole, Molfino,
Kelly and Morrow made a lasting im
pression on Berkeley. Then came the
times before the big game. With a
victorious veteran team, flushed with
the victory of the previous year, Cal
ifornia met the first Lanagan team,
and although the game resulted in a
tie, it was a virtual victory for Stan
ford, and in this game Jim Weller
and Chalmers were powerful fac
tors. Tn our sophomore year we
journeyed to Berkeley to play on the
new field, and the grand victory of
1 R-0 lowered the banners of Califor
nia deep into the dust. And in this
game '07 furnished the quarterback
who generaled, the fullback who
smashed his way, and the halfback
who carried the ball over for all
three touchdowns. Stott, Weller and
Chalmers were the strongest eombi-

I nation that ever twisted the tail of
| the Berkeley bear. And then the
game in our Junior year when we
had the distinction of captaining a
Varsity team. Our new field was to
be open for dedication, but the trust
of the Student Body was well placed
in Captain Chalmers, who led his
team to a glorious victory over the
Blue and Gold. Dole, Molfino and
Slusher were added to our list of
veterans. This year saw the first
Rugby team under a '07 captain, and
although the game was new and
somewhta unpopular, Captain Stott
led his team to victory, winning the
last intercollegiate football game of
the Lanagan epoch. Laumeister and
Edwards gained their letter in this
game. And now that we fire depart
ing, we leave to the college a new
field coach, George Presley, a man
who by his sterling qualities as an
athlete insures our future success.
In track we have seen two victo
ries out of three meets. In our
Freshman year Stanford won and in
this meet Macfarland brought honor
to his class in the low hurdles. Our
Sophomore year saw defeat, but sev
eral members from our class gained
their Varsity letter. In our Junior
year we had the honor of a track
captain from our class. This, our
Senior year, saw the track team
again under the lead of Macfarland.
With seven men '07 won the intcr
class meet, and in the intercollegiate
Macfarland, Elwell, McNeil, Nash
and Edwards aided in the great vic
tory.
In baseball we have had signal
.•success as a class, winning the inter
class championship for three years,
Chalmers, Rhyne and Presley cap
taining the victorious teams, Burtis,
Topp, Davis, Stagner, Kelly, Salis
bury, Morrow and McLain furnish
ing the makeup of the teams. Tn
Varsity baseball we have had men
from our first year, and this year an
07 captain, Presley, broke the base-!
bill hoodoo and won the first vic
tory that Stanford has seen in base
ball for years.
A naught seven captain has never
known defeat in intercollegiate ath
letics and in this our senior year,
Stanford has won every intercolle
giate Varsity contest. Naught sev- J
en has broken the record, setting
a mark unsurpassed m the history I
of athletics between the two Uni-'
7ersities.
Miss Owen and Miss Gartzman
have taken prominent part in wo
men's athletes.
Boating, that new sport which
came into existence in our Fresh-1
man year, has had some of its most
enth iA»iastic supporters from our
class, and this year Captain Zimmer-:
man brought home the first victory
In intercollegiate eights.
Dramatics have felt the influence 1
of '07. 111 the Sophomore play we!

broke away from the traditions and
installed the tryout system for the
cast, which has proven to be a most
beneficial step in the development of
college dramatics. Ivellog, Ray,
Mansfield, Miss Pedlar and Miss
Moise brought great credit to their
class by their exceptional ability.
Our Junior Plug Ugly is of doubtful
standing. If the measure of a good
Plug Ugly is a rough house, ours was
a great success. The Junior Farce,
written by Bateman, received a well
merited reward, and brought out
new matertal from our class. Ward,
Bernard, Stewart, Miss Lyman and
Miss Officer have taken prominent
parts in the majority of college plays.
Journalism has received its share
of support from our class. To Karl
Bickel the class points with pride.
To his care was intrusted the editor
ship of the Quad and although the
the original Quad. TheD gz.Ws.
earthquake prevented the completion
of his labors, the subsequent record
book which was gotten out shows
the possibilities of the original Quad.
The Sequoia, under Bickel, was re
vived from the dusty shelves of ob
livion and changed from its petti
coat policy into a live and character
istic college publication, which ful
filled a long felt want of the student
body. In the words of Will Irwin,
editor of McClures magazine, "It is
the best college magazine published
today." The Daily Palo Alto receiv
ed its first '07 editor when Harvey
Peter Bittner received the editorial
quill from the hands of Allen, at a
time when the policy of the paper
was somewhat stormy.
Under Bittner's careful guidance, the
reign of peace was again established.
George Spurrier, our next editor,
conducted the paper with credit, and
during his editorship the paper be
came a product of the linotype, re
placing the old Ben Franklin meth
ods characteristic of its past.
Miss French, Miss Merrilies, Miss
Norvell and Miss Thoburn have con
tributed to college journalism.
Clift edited the Chaparral.
In debating we have had but lit
tle distinction. Tn our Sophomore
year, Fisher, Maloy and Everson won
the underclass debate. This year we
had an alternate on the Carnot team.
To the surprise of Phi Beta Kap
pa, we slipped a few members within
its sacred precincts, and one of them
was a varsity athlete. To Daily,
Rosenfeld, Hoagland, Holman, Roop,
and the Misses Phillipi, Stadmuller,
Hosford, Lumis, Polsom, Smith, Tho
burn, and McDowell, we are indebted
for this recognition of our scholastic
existence.
On the Glee Club, S. B. Thomp
son, as leader, A. B. Packard, presi
dent of combined clubs, with Crit
tenden, Macfarland and Bernard,
upheld the musical prestige of '07.
Our senior year has been a per
fect one, —success has met us on
every side, and all have conspired to
make our last year an auspicious
one. To the faculty we tender our
most sincere thanks for their unsel
fish devotion to our interests. They
have honored us by conferring upon
us the stamp of their approval, and
we in turn will strive to honor them.
Naught-eight we thank for their
friendship and good rivalry, and to
them we extend our most sincere
good wishes.
Members of the Class of '07, this
is the class of our class history. To
your individual efforts and enthusi
asms is due the high standard set
by our class. We are soon to part
from our Alma Mater and go our
ways into the world, but with you all
there should go this memory and in
spiration, that the class of Naught
seven stands for strong manhood,
true womanhood and success.
The class day exercises were for
mally opened by President J. M.
Ward in the following speech:
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me great pleasure to ex
tend to you, 011 behalf of the class of
1907, a hearty welcome to these fes
tivities celebrating the Sixteenth An
nual Commencement of this Univer
sity. We feel honored by your pres
ence, and hope that your participation
in the various affairs of the week may
be most pleasant.
This occasion is the goal toward
which the class of '07 has been striv
ing for four years, and naturally
brings with it a certain degree of
pleasure and satisfaction: pleasure in
being honored with the Stanford de
gree, its value increased by the asso
ciations with it; satisfaction in know
ing that the honor has been earned.
But the joyousness of such an occa
sion is always tinged with a feeling
also of regret, and so with us. We
feel a deep regret upon leaving the
scenes of the four years so pleasantly
spent within these walls.
The class of 1907 takes a pardon
able pride in what it has done for
the University, but seemingly in pro
portion to its achievements has it
been the recipient of favors at the
hands of our Alma Mater. A patient
and efficient faculty have given us
their best. We have had the good
fellowship and lasting friendship of
our fellow students. And so we can
express only gratitude to faculty and
student body alike, for after all it is
not merely study that equips the col- |
lege graduate, but rather studying
under men, and mingling with men. I
Let future additions to faculty and j
student body be men, strong and ac- .
tive, and the future of Stanford will
never be in doubt. A true Stanford
man must be a man to begin with.
The class of 1907 has witnessed a j
most severe test of the Stanford
spirit. Tt has seen that Stanford
spirit emerge from the test stronger !
than ever. And as its members go ,
forth to make the name of their Uni
versity they go forth strong in the
new Stanford spirit. The name of
our University is still in the making, j
Tt devolves upon the graduates of this
Commencement season, as it has de- j
volved upon graduates of former
years, and as it will devolve upon
graduates to come, to see to it that (
they do their share toward the mak- |
ing of the good name of their Alma j
Mater.
And just a word of appreciation. !
The festivities of this week are the !

vidual, nor of the whole class, but of a |
few members who have spared neither ,
time nnr labor in making our Com- j
mencement a success. On behalf of 1
the class, T desire to thank them for I
their efficient work and invaluable '

The Sequoia, under Bickel, was re
vived from the dusty shelves of ob
livion and changed from its petti
coat policy into a live and character
istic college publication, which ful
filled a long felt want of the student
body. In the words of Will Irwin,
editor of McClures magazine, "It is
the best college magazine published
today." The Daily Palo Alto receiv
ed its first '07 editor when Harvey
Peter Bittner received the editorial
quill from the hands of Allen, at a
time when the policy of the paper
was somewhat stormy.
Under Bittner's careful guidance, the
reign of peace was again established.
George Spurrier, our next editor,

during his editorship the paper be
came a product of the linotype, re
placing the old Ben Franklin meth
ods characteristic of its past.
Miss French, Miss Merrilies, Miss

In debating we have had but lit
tle distinction. Tn our Sophomore
year, Fisher, Maloy and Everson won
the underclass debate. This year we
had an alternate on the Carnot team.
To the surprise of Phi Beta Kap
pa, we slipped a few members within
its sacred precincts, and one of them
was a varsity athlete. To Daily,
Rosenfeld, Hoagland, Holman, Roop,
and the Misses Phillipi, Stadmuller,
Hosford, Lumis, Polsom, Smith, Tho
burn, and McDowell, we are indebted
for this recognition of our scholastic
existence.
On the Glee Club, S. B. Thomp
son, as leader, A. B. Packard, presi
dent of combined clubs, with Crit
tenden, Macfarland and Bernard,
upheld the musical prestige of '07.
Our senior year has been a per
fect one, —success has met us on
every side, and all have conspired to
make our last year an auspicious
one. To the faculty we tender our
most sincere thanks for their unsel
fish devotion to our interests. They
have honored us by conferring upon
us the stamp of their approval, and
we in turn will strive to honor them.
Naught-eight we thank for their
friendship and good rivalry, and to
them we extend our most sincere
good wishes.
Members of the Class of '07, this
is the class of our class history. To
your individual efforts and enthusi
asms is due the high standard set
by our class. We are soon to part
from our Alma Mater and go our
ways into the world, but with you all
there should go this memory and in
spiration, that the class of Naught
seven stands for strong manhood,
true womanhood and success.
The class day exercises were for
mally opened by President J. M.
Ward in the following speech:
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It gives me great pleasure to ex
tend to you, 011 behalf of the class of
1907, a hearty welcome to these fes
tivities celebrating the Sixteenth An
nual Commencement of this Univer
sity. We feel honored by your pres
ence, and hope that your participation
in the various affairs of the week may
be most pleasant.
This occasion is the goal toward
which the class of '07 has been striv
ing for four years, and naturally
brings with it a certain degree of
pleasure and satisfaction: pleasure in
being honored with the Stanford de
gree, its value increased by the asso
ciations with it; satisfaction in know
ing that the honor has been earned.
But the joyousness of such an occa
sion is always tinged with a feeling
also of regret, and so with us. We
feel a deep regret upon leaving the
scenes of the four years so pleasantly
spent within these walls.
The class of 1907 takes a pardon
able pride in what it has done for
the University, but seemingly in pro
portion to its achievements has it
been the recipient of favors at the
hands of our Alma Mater. A patient
and efficient faculty have given us
their best. We have had the good
fellowship and lasting friendship of
our fellow students. And so we can
express only gratitude to faculty and
student body alike, for after all it is
not merely study that equips the col- |
lege graduate, but rather studying
under men, and mingling with men. I
Let future additions to faculty and j
student body be men, strong and ac- .
tive, and the future of Stanford will
never be in doubt. A true Stanford
man must be a man to begin with.
The class of 1907 has witnessed a j
most severe test of the Stanford
spirit. Tt has seen that Stanford
spirit emerge from the test stronger !
than ever. And as its members go ,
forth to make the name of their Uni
versity they go forth strong in the
new Stanford spirit. The name of
our University is still in the making, j
Tt devolves upon the graduates of this
Commencement season, as it has de- j
volved upon graduates of former
years, and as it will devolve upon
graduates to come, to see to it that (
they do their share toward the mak- |
ing of the good name of their Alma j
Mater.
And just a word of appreciation. !
The festivities of this week are the !
result of the efforts, not of one indi- j
vidual, nor of the whole class, but of a |
few members who have spared neither ,
time nnr labor in making our Com- j
mencement a success. On behalf of 1
the class, T desire to thank them for I
their efficient work and invaluable '
service.

j The class history, a very accurate
and interesting account of the career
of 1907 was delivered as follows, by
L. M. Edwards:
The day is nearly done; in the dim
light of our waning sun we are
j gathered to rejoice in the memories
I of our achievements. The past rises
before us like a dream. We see the
eager freshman class as it enters the
domain of its new home, filled with
the enthusiasm of the new life, the
transformation of the untried youth
j into the seasoned athlete, the stu
-1 dent into the scholar, the boy into
the man. And it is the history of
this development that is so dear to
us, and to each single achievement
we point with pride, and through it
all the trace the motto of our cless,
"success."
It is impossible for us to measure
our success in the scholastic field.
There is no criterion by which we
may judge the benefits that we have
derived. For four years we have re
ceived the careful attention of a con
siderate faculty. We have had
opened to us the portals of learning
and only time will prove our worthi
ness, but if our future may be meas
ured by our achievements in other
activities in college, the final day of
reckoning will find us loyal to and
worthy of our Alma Mater.
In athletics our fame will long
linger in the memory of Stanford
men. Naught seven will stand out
as the class of the Lanagan epoch.
For four years we have been under
his regime, and well we have proven
worthy of his care, for no Lanagan
team, football or baseball, upon
which a '07 man played, has known
defeat. Entering in the fall of '03,
we became the first charge of a new
coach. Characteristic of freshmen
teams we inspired but little confi
dence in the Student Body, but when
we went into our first intercollegi
ate contest '07 proved to have the
strongest freshman team ever seen
at Stanford, and we won the first
victory for Jimmie Lanagan, 12-0.
Captain Stott, Weller, Dole, Molfino,
Kelly and Morrow made a lasting im
pression on Berkeley. Then came the
times before the big game. With a
victorious veteran team, flushed with
the victory of the previous year, Cal
ifornia met the first Lanagan team,
and although the game resulted in a
tie, it was a virtual victory for Stan
ford, and in this game Jim Weller
and Chalmers were powerful fac
tors. Tn our sophomore year we
journeyed to Berkeley to play on the
new field, and the grand victory of
1 R-0 lowered the banners of Califor
nia deep into the dust. And in this
game '07 furnished the quarterback
who generaled, the fullback who
smashed his way, and the halfback
who carried the ball over for all
three touchdowns. Stott, Weller and
Chalmers were the strongest eombi-

I nation that ever twisted the tail of
| the Berkeley bear. And then the
game in our Junior year when we
had the distinction of captaining a
Varsity team. Our new field was to
be open for dedication, but the trust
of the Student Body was well placed
in Captain Chalmers, who led his
team to a glorious victory over the
Blue and Gold. Dole, Molfino and
Slusher were added to our list of
veterans. This year saw the first
Rugby team under a '07 captain, and
although the game was new and
somewhta unpopular, Captain Stott
led his team to victory, winning the
last intercollegiate football game of
the Lanagan epoch. Laumeister and
Edwards gained their letter in this
game. And now that we fire depart
ing, we leave to the college a new
field coach, George Presley, a man
who by his sterling qualities as an
athlete insures our future success.
In track we have seen two victo
ries out of three meets. In our
Freshman year Stanford won and in
this meet Macfarland brought honor
to his class in the low hurdles. Our
Sophomore year saw defeat, but sev
eral members from our class gained
their Varsity letter. In our Junior
year we had the honor of a track
captain from our class. This, our
Senior year, saw the track team
again under the lead of Macfarland.
With seven men '07 won the intcr
class meet, and in the intercollegiate
Macfarland, Elwell, McNeil, Nash
and Edwards aided in the great vic
tory.
In baseball we have had signal
.•success as a class, winning the inter
class championship for three years,
Chalmers, Rhyne and Presley cap
taining the victorious teams, Burtis,
Topp, Davis, Stagner, Kelly, Salis
bury, Morrow and McLain furnish
ing the makeup of the teams. Tn
Varsity baseball we have had men
from our first year, and this year an
07 captain, Presley, broke the base-!
bill hoodoo and won the first vic
tory that Stanford has seen in base
ball for years.
A naught seven captain has never
known defeat in intercollegiate ath
letics and in this our senior year,
Stanford has won every intercolle
giate Varsity contest. Naught sev- J
en has broken the record, setting
a mark unsurpassed m the history I
of athletics between the two Uni-'
7ersities.
Miss Owen and Miss Gartzman
have taken prominent part in wo
men's athletes.
Boating, that new sport which
came into existence in our Fresh-1
man year, has had some of its most
enth iA»iastic supporters from our
class, and this year Captain Zimmer-:
man brought home the first victory
In intercollegiate eights.
Dramatics have felt the influence 1
of '07. 111 the Sophomore play we!

broke away from the traditions and
installed the tryout system for the
cast, which has proven to be a most
beneficial step in the development of
college dramatics. Ivellog, Ray,
Mansfield, Miss Pedlar and Miss
Moise brought great credit to their
class by their exceptional ability.
Our Junior Plug Ugly is of doubtful
standing. If the measure of a good
Plug Ugly is a rough house, ours was
a great success. The Junior Farce,
written by Bateman, received a well
merited reward, and brought out
new matertal from our class. Ward,
Bernard, Stewart, Miss Lyman and
Miss Officer have taken prominent
parts in the majority of college plays.
Journalism has received its share
of support from our class. To Karl
Bickel the class points with pride.
To his care was intrusted the editor
ship of the Quad and although the
