The class will, read by L). H. Clift,
was as follows:
Fellow Classmates and Friends,
Greetings.
We, the members of the class of
1907, having spent four full years in
this University, more or less, do on
this 20th day of May, 1907, declare
this to be our last will and testament.
In drawing up this document, which
is to be our last public expression to
the collcge world, we wish it to be
comprehended and always borne in
mind that we are not acting under
menace, intimidation, fraud or cor
ruption, and that we are generally
conceded to be the sanest class that
ever entered Stanford—most of us.
And so in our saner moments we
have passed the last milestone of ex
aminations, we have successfully com
pleted the requirements laid down by
the iron rules of tyranny, and this day
we are preparing to go forth to meet
the onslaughts of the sad cruel world.
That they are many we believe. But
this much we know: nothing that we
have to combat will bother us more
than the final ex's, with their exacting
and excruciating torture, and those of
us here today who have lived through
the ordeal may some day be heard
from.
Our college days are over. Now
that the end has come we realize this
with regret. Our four happiest, care
free years are behind us. 1907 has
made for itself a record to be proud
of. In every field of college activity
we have maintained the lead we
gained as freshmen. And so to the
classes which will succeed us we here
by give and bequeath the experiences
which we have gone through, in a full
knowledge that our Alma Mater will
give them a richer inheritance, a more
splendid preparation and four finer
years than any other institution.
To you who are gathered here to
day to listen to these presents, we
relegate the privilege of keeping our
grave green. See that our grave is
given more attention than the burying
places of the busmen and the late
lamented livery trust. We desire that
we shall never be forgotten, and that
when future captains of the Cardinal
teams shall roll up victory upon vic
tory for Stanford the names of Chal
mers, Stott, Presley, Zimmerman and
MacFarland will be remembered.
To future Stanford classes we who
have successfully passed, hereby give
and bequeath the week of final ex's,
with the fond hope that tlr* next boy
cott be directed that way.
To the class of 1908 we leave the

annual holdovers, well knowing that
even our holdovers will transmit to
the several classes to come that se
cret of success and magnetic power
that has made 1907 the best class in
college.
We trust that the year to follow
will be another year of complete tri
umph in athletics. When we are out
in the world, the men struggling up
from errand boys, and the women
trimming hats in millinery stores, we
shall anxiously await dispatches tell
ing of Stanford's gala days.
To W. Koerner we leave the foot
ball captaincy, knowing that he is
thoroughly qualified to continue our
habit of winning the big game. To
Kenny Fenton, the boy wonder, we
leave the baseball captaincy, with the
knowledge that he is able to hold the
victory gained by Presley after nine
years of defeat. To Fred Lanagan
we leave the 1908 track meet.
To future senior classes we leave
the senior circus, established by 11s;
and to 1908 we bequeath the immedi
ate task of keeping that institution
alive. May there be many curiosities
and clowns—unconscious and other
wise—to create fun for the masses.
In leaving the senior circus to the
next senior class we leave also the
following three suggestions for mirth
ful side shows:
First, in a tent by themselves, es
tablish a temple and altar for the
sacred Press Club, with punk burn
ing before the altar.
Second, In the open field place a
man with a high power telescope,
charging live cents to see the English
Club.
Third, All alone, under a special
canvas, exhibit the Zete freshmen,
who will proceed to raise moustaches
while you wait.
To A. A. Murphy we bequeath the
tender care of the student body, of
which we were once an important
part. Our last word to Murphy is
that he attend classes occasionally
and maintain a moderate record of
scholarship that he may be able to
complete his term of office.
To W. F. Durand, chairman of the
Student Affairs' Committee, whom
some of us have come to know real
well, we leave another year of tran
quility. In leaving we desire to ex
press our sincere respect and appreci
ation for the fair attitude assumed by
Dr. Durand in the most trying posi
tion in the University.
To the queeners of the University
who will continue to queen long after
you and I are- gone we bequeath the
unlighted desks in the library, and
the still-unlighted avenue. To Fat
Coe, Ralph Marshall and Hal Doig
we especially bequeath the seats in
the arboretum, the cactus gardens
(which are universally avoided) and
the paths to Wilson's.
The pleasant and soothing admin
istrations of the beautiful nurses at
the Guild Hospital we leave to the
future generations of rugged Stanford
men who will at frequent intervals
become afflicted with such fatal dis
eases as headaches, earaches and
toothaches.
To Cap and Gown we leave an ex
purgated volume of this year's "Se
quoia" to adorn its library shelves.
Tn addition we bequeath a pious ed
itor for next year's magazine, with
assurances that we shall hear no more
about the lives and adventures of the
Bible kings.
To next year's seniors we hand
down the big sombrero which we have
