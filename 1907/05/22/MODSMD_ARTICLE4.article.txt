faithfully worn from August to May.
To the future Juniors we leave the
mystic plug, recommending the action
of the third year men in seeking to
procure their headgear by the first
of the next college semester. Our
hope is that each junior will wear his
plug at least three times during the
year. To the jolly, roughneck, irre
sponsible sophomore we bequeath the
little red hat which was first worn
and established by 1907.
To the future generations of Stan
ford men and women we give and be
queath Dr. Gardner's two funny sto
ries. During our sojourn here we
have come to know and love our
Chaplain. We have patiently listened
to the side-splitting story of the little
boy and the football game year in
and year out; to the next generation
we leave the story of the box of leak
ing books. "For verily, verily, the
father's have eaten sour grapes, and
the children's teeth are set on edge."
To the University community we
leave the Social Service Club, with
wonderful opportunities for slum
work down in Menlo. The Social
Service Club has been the liveliest,
most enterprising and profitable or
ganization in college this year. May
it continue so, and may the astral
body of its famed president drift in
011 an occasional meeting in the years
to come.
To Charley Lathrop, with his coff
ers of gold, we relegate the rare priv
ilege of paying our unsettled debts.
It is a favor to do even this for 1907.
Such favors are not given to many.
May the memory of our lavish patron
age never be forgotten by Wilson,
by Bracchi, by Baron Theile, and by
Charley Meyers.
To 1500 hungry students we leave
another stormy year at the campus
boarding houses. To the magnates
of the Eating Trust we bequeath
many profitable years, several trips to
Europe, automobile tours, and pleas
ant summers at Newport. We hope
they will never be reduced to the
point of eating the meals they pro
vide.
To the fun-loving college world we
give and bequeath another frothy year
in journalism. The past year was an
exciting one in this respect. We can
never forget the Bogies, the scraps
and the "Squalors."
To Earl Hadley we leave the "Chap
arral," trusting that "Chappie" will
continue to be no respector of per
sons. "Chappie" might spend a prof
itable summer sawing wood in the
back yard to toughen his muscle, for
he has come to need it in the business.
To P. B. Delano we bequeath the
"Daily Palo Alto," with the sugges
tion that a prize be offered to the
student solving the greatest number
of editorials during the year.
To H. F. Bruning we leave the '09
"Quad," with consolations to the
other 299 members of the class that
ran and were defeated. May the ap
pearance of the "Quad" create as
great an uproar as did the election.
And now we come to that subject
closest to Chappie's heart, the
"Squalor." To E. N. Smith, .alias
"The Stanford Woman," we hereby
bequeath the "Squalor," a live,
squirming magazine, with the recom
mendation that the new editor have
a firm hand 011 the throttle, and keep
the terrible thing well under control.
Exit "Bathsheba." Alas! poor Bill,
we knew him well!
Lastly, we bequeath to Stanford our
good will and our strongest affections.

We have spent four of the finest
years of our lives here beneath the
shelter of these red-tiled roofs, in
good fellowship with one another.
We have endeavored during these
years to absorb the best influences
that our Alma Mater could give us.
To some degree we feel that we
have succeeded. Our opinions and
our characters have been moulded and
shaped by men like Dr. Jordan, and
to these professors we leave our sin
cerest admiration and regrets at part
ing. They gave us the best that they
had; we have given them the best ef
forts of which we were capable.
One thing we wish to retain as we
go out to represent the institution
that has so kindly and so ably
equipped us. That is the Stanford
spirit as we have found it here. We
take that with us, and the memory of
the golden days spent here at Stan
ford, here beneath the arcades in this
sun-lit valley, where the skies are
bluest, and the air is freest, where the
rugged hills and the shimmering bay
are an inspiration and a delight. That
is the environment in which you and
I have dwelt.
