The class plate was eloquently dedi
cated by F. A. Fisher, and it was re
ceived on behalf of the University by
Acting President J. M. Stillman. The
oration follows:
Our purpose in gathering here to
day is to dedicate the plate of the
class of 1907; to perform that tradi
tional function which Stanford classes
have performed from the beginning
and which will be continued by Stan
ford classes to the end.
Just as the plate we today are lay
ing is of different form than other
class plates so is the occasion of the
plate laying of this year more than
of ordinary significance. As the plate
of our class is to be separated from
that of its predecessor by an abrupt
line in distinction from the regular
form of all preceding plates, so has
the class of 1907 seen an abrupt and
sudden event in the life of the Uni
versity—with all following peacefully
and regularly thereafter. The even
tenor of events in the life of the Uni
versity up to 1906 is typified by the
regular plates placed here before the
Chapel up to this point. The sudden
blow of a year ago is indicated by
this abrupt line between these two
class plates, and the plates of future
classes to go regularly on from this
spot represent the wonderful way in
which our glorious University has
faced one of the greatest of natural
calamities and has almly and unin
terruptedly continued its course. It
has but served to show that Stanford
is to last so long as human institu
tions exist; that, that future day when
a second row of plates shall be started
from this point is not problematical
but as sure to be as time itself.
Tt is not for me today as an under
graduate and one of your fellows to
talk to you of the battle of life to
come and of the strenuous days of
the future with their many problems.
That such days are to be, however,
and that we arc to drift from the free
and happy life spent bore is a thought
which you have all been thinking.
For me it is but to say that our four
years here have been four years of the
best possible preparation for what
ever the future may offer us—four
years of instruction, work, of con
tact with high-minded men, of ming-
ling with fellow-students and college
activities in general—four years in
which we have first learned to know
the Stanford spirit and then to work
constantly for it and now are about
to take away and cherish some part
of that great Stanford spirit. And
carrying away this Stanford spirit and
Stanford ideals and the inspiration
from these impressive arcades, we will
take with us something which can
guide and assist through our future
difficulties, be they what they may.
All that we may do in
the future, who of us who have signed
this class roll may some day bring
great honor upon his Alma Mater, is
for the future to decide, but even then
such accomplishments will appear
but transient and fragile records. So
also with all that our class may have
done while in college—its victories in
every branch of college struggles, its
traditions handed to other classes, the
organizations and associations, the
feeling of good will and equality be
tween all its members, —all these are
lastingly impressed on our minds and
are Stanford history but are never
theless incorporeal. The occasion to
day presents us with our sole oppor
tunity of physically adding something
to Stanford as a memorial of our life
here—something to be incorporated
into the very masonry of these build
ings—something to stay as long as
the University shall endure. Years
hence when we shall return to our
alumni reunions, this cold plate of
bronze, then a part of these arcades,
will be the one material emblem sym
bolizing all of the life of the class of
1907.
And just as this plate today is being
laid in its concrete bed to last
throughout the ages, we will trust, as
impervious to natural decay and de
structive forces as the very mountains
themselves, just so firmly set in our
hearts do we carry away that Stan
ford spirit which we have here learned
and cherished—those altruistic, noble
ideals—for life.
Thus far we have in no measure
been able to compensate our Alma
Mater for all that she has done for
11s, for all that we have gained from
her to carry away with us—for the
ideals which she has developed in us.
But in the days to come our loyalty
will not have waned, but aided by
recollection and ever greater appreci
ation of maturer years will be stronger
still. By signing the roll beneath this
plate we, each and every one of 11s,
has pledged himself to requite his
Alma Mater to the limit of his powers
for all that she has so bounteously
done for him. We have pledged our
selves to be true to Stanford—true to
the ideals which we have here learned;
to so act as men and women that we
shall always be an honor to our Uni
versity to the end that she and her
founders may see that we arc not
ungrateful. We will ever bear in
mind that as we honor ourselves, we
honor her, and with this as' our sole
means of showing our appreciation
and loyalty to our University, do we
leave her, promising faithfully to be
true to her ideals for all time.
With these thoughts in our hearts
and this pledge in our minds do we
hereby dedicate to the University, the

for all that she has so bounteously
done for him. We have pledged our
selves to be true to Stanford—true to
the ideals which we have here learned;
to so act as men and women that we
shall always be an honor to our Uni
versity to the end that she and her
founders may see that we arc not
ungrateful. We will ever bear in
mind that as we honor ourselves, we
honor her, and with this as' our sole
means of showing our appreciation
and loyalty to our University, do we
leave her, promising faithfully to be
true to her ideals for all time.
With these thoughts in our hearts
and this pledge in our minds do we
hereby dedicate to the University, the
plate of the class of 1907.
The class plate was eloquently dedi
cated by F. A. Fisher, and it was re
ceived on behalf of the University by
Acting President J. M. Stillman. The
oration follows:
Our purpose in gathering here to
day is to dedicate the plate of the
class of 1907; to perform that tradi
tional function which Stanford classes
have performed from the beginning
and which will be continued by Stan
ford classes to the end.
Just as the plate we today are lay
ing is of different form than other
class plates so is the occasion of the
plate laying of this year more than
of ordinary significance. As the plate
of our class is to be separated from
that of its predecessor by an abrupt
line in distinction from the regular
form of all preceding plates, so has
the class of 1907 seen an abrupt and
sudden event in the life of the Uni
versity—with all following peacefully
and regularly thereafter. The even
tenor of events in the life of the Uni
versity up to 1906 is typified by the
regular plates placed here before the
Chapel up to this point. The sudden
blow of a year ago is indicated by
this abrupt line between these two
class plates, and the plates of future
classes to go regularly on from this
spot represent the wonderful way in
which our glorious University has
faced one of the greatest of natural
calamities and has almly and unin
terruptedly continued its course. It
has but served to show that Stanford
is to last so long as human institu
tions exist; that, that future day when
a second row of plates shall be started
from this point is not problematical
but as sure to be as time itself.
Tt is not for me today as an under
graduate and one of your fellows to
talk to you of the battle of life to
come and of the strenuous days of
the future with their many problems.
That such days are to be, however,
and that we arc to drift from the free
and happy life spent bore is a thought
which you have all been thinking.
For me it is but to say that our four
years here have been four years of the
best possible preparation for what
ever the future may offer us—four
years of instruction, work, of con
tact with high-minded men, of ming-
ling with fellow-students and college
activities in general—four years in
which we have first learned to know
the Stanford spirit and then to work
constantly for it and now are about
to take away and cherish some part
of that great Stanford spirit. And
carrying away this Stanford spirit and
Stanford ideals and the inspiration
from these impressive arcades, we will
take with us something which can
guide and assist through our future
difficulties, be they what they may.
All that we may do in
the future, who of us who have signed
this class roll may some day bring
great honor upon his Alma Mater, is
for the future to decide, but even then
such accomplishments will appear
but transient and fragile records. So
also with all that our class may have
done while in college—its victories in
every branch of college struggles, its
traditions handed to other classes, the
organizations and associations, the
feeling of good will and equality be
tween all its members, —all these are
lastingly impressed on our minds and
are Stanford history but are never
theless incorporeal. The occasion to
day presents us with our sole oppor
tunity of physically adding something
to Stanford as a memorial of our life
here—something to be incorporated
into the very masonry of these build
ings—something to stay as long as
the University shall endure. Years
hence when we shall return to our
alumni reunions, this cold plate of
bronze, then a part of these arcades,
will be the one material emblem sym
bolizing all of the life of the class of
1907.
And just as this plate today is being
laid in its concrete bed to last
throughout the ages, we will trust, as
impervious to natural decay and de
structive forces as the very mountains
themselves, just so firmly set in our
hearts do we carry away that Stan
ford spirit which we have here learned
and cherished—those altruistic, noble
ideals—for life.
Thus far we have in no measure
been able to compensate our Alma
Mater for all that she has done for
11s, for all that we have gained from
her to carry away with us—for the
ideals which she has developed in us.
But in the days to come our loyalty
will not have waned, but aided by
recollection and ever greater appreci
ation of maturer years will be stronger
still. By signing the roll beneath this
plate we, each and every one of 11s,
has pledged himself to requite his
Alma Mater to the limit of his powers
for all that she has so bounteously
done for him. We have pledged our
selves to be true to Stanford—true to
the ideals which we have here learned;
