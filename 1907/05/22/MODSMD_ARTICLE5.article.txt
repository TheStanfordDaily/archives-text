The class plate was eloquently dedi
cated by F. A. Fisher, and it was re
ceived on behalf of the University by
Acting President J. M. Stillman. The
oration follows:
Our purpose in gathering here to
day is to dedicate the plate of the
class of 1907; to perform that tradi
tional function which Stanford classes
have performed from the beginning
and which will be continued by Stan
ford classes to the end.
Just as the plate we today are lay
ing is of different form than other
class plates so is the occasion of the
plate laying of this year more than
of ordinary significance. As the plate
of our class is to be separated from
that of its predecessor by an abrupt
line in distinction from the regular
form of all preceding plates, so has
the class of 1907 seen an abrupt and
sudden event in the life of the Uni
versity—with all following peacefully
and regularly thereafter. The even
tenor of events in the life of the Uni
versity up to 1906 is typified by the
regular plates placed here before the
Chapel up to this point. The sudden
blow of a year ago is indicated by
this abrupt line between these two
class plates, and the plates of future
classes to go regularly on from this
spot represent the wonderful way in
which our glorious University has
faced one of the greatest of natural
calamities and has almly and unin
terruptedly continued its course. It
has but served to show that Stanford
is to last so long as human institu
tions exist; that, that future day when
a second row of plates shall be started
from this point is not problematical
but as sure to be as time itself.
Tt is not for me today as an under
graduate and one of your fellows to
talk to you of the battle of life to
come and of the strenuous days of
the future with their many problems.
That such days are to be, however,
and that we arc to drift from the free
and happy life spent bore is a thought
which you have all been thinking.
For me it is but to say that our four
years here have been four years of the
best possible preparation for what
ever the future may offer us—four
years of instruction, work, of con
tact with high-minded men, of ming-
