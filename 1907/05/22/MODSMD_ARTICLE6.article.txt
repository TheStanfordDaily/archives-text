The annual Commencement address,
delivered by Colonel Harris Wein
stock, of Sacramento, is as follows:

THE NATION'S CHIEF NEED OF
THE HOUR.
What think you is the Nation's
chief need of the hour? I hear one
answer, "A greater navy"; another,
"A mightier navy"; yet another, "pub
lic ownership of the railroads"; still
another, "restriction of immigration";
yet another, "A solution of the war
between capital and labor," and so
on. These are all important needs,
but, to my mind, they are far from
the most crying want of the Nation.
What the republic most needs today
is men. Men who, in the words of
Holland, "Have strong hearts, true
faith and ready hands, men whom the
lust of office does not kill, men whom
the spoils of office cannot buy, men
who possess opinions and a will, men
who have honor, men who will not
lie."
Never in this land was there a time
when the demand for men was as
great as today. Not that men, good
and true are fewer than in the past, —
at no time in the history of the coun
try were there so many as now, but
because the demand has outrun the
supply. In every walk of life, private
and public, the cry is men! men! men!
Men who combine character with abil
ity, men who can think and act, men
who are safe and sound.
The captains of industry and of
trade are seeking them with search
lights. The churches, the universities
and the forums; the cities, the states
and the nation were never in such
dire need as now for high-souled,
clean-handed, strong-spirited, aggres
sive men, who see the need of the
hour and can fill it, who can assume
responsibilities, and discharge them,
who know their duties and fearlessly
perform them.
As our national responsibilities
widen, this demand for men must
grow. Unless the want can be met,
the nation, sooner or later, will find
itself straight-jacketed, and its
growth in every way seriously
checked.
Whence is to come this supply of
men? Surely not from the gutters,
not from the saloons, not from the
gambling hells, nor yet from the hot
houses of luxurious wealth. The men
needed to uplift and upbuild must
come largely from our institutions of
learning, where brain is developed and
mind is trained, where the power to
think is cultivated, and where all
forces tend to strengthen self control,
raise ideals, and build character. Our
schools, as before in the na
tion's history, must be our stay and
our hope. Tt is largely the school
that must prepare our youth for the
future citizenship. To our colleges
and universities we look to give their
fullest quota of high thinkers and able
leaders.
Tf you young men and women,
about to leave these college walls for
the great fields of activity stretching
out before you, have made the most
of your educational opportunities you
begin the struggle as possessors, in
a higher degree than you otherwise
would have been, of the world's four
most valuable assets: youth, health,
trained minds, and character. With

such an equipment the world should
be yours.
in ten, or at most in twenty, years
each one of you should be tilling posi
tions of trust and honor. Each one
of you within that time should have
become a potent factor for uplifting
and upbuilding men, as well as the
conditions around you. If you fail in
this, you will thereby demonstrate
that there are weak spots in you
which should have been nursed and
strengthened.
Let me for an example cite a case
in point. Some twenty-live years ago
two young men came out of the
University of California. Both were
born in modest circumstances; both
were regarded as young men of un
usual strength and power; both faced
important futures.
The profession of the law was
chosen by each as a life career, and
today these two men, in their very
prime, are residents of San Francisco.
One is reputed to be a millionaire,
and the other is said to be compar
atively a poor man. Measured by the
yardstick of dollars, the alleged mil
lionaire has been eminently success
ful, and the other practically a failure.
Judged by the standard of manhood,
the rich man has made of life a
wretched, miserable, dismal failure;
the other a glorious success. Today
the names of these two men are
known throughout the land, if not
throughout the world. The one as
one of the greatest living scoundrels,
who has been prosecuted by the other,
who ranks among the nations' great
est patriots and most useful citizens.
Abraham Ruef started out as a col
lege man on an even footing with
Francis J. Heney. With his talents
and his energy he might today pos
sess the same esteem and admiration
as are now enjoyed by his college
mate, Heney. Unfortunately for him
and for his state, there was a weak
spot in Abraham Reuf. Temptation
came to him and greed prostituted
his talent, his education and his char
acter. He was weak and he fell. To
day all his piles of gold cannot save
him from the well merited contempt
and contumely of his fellows, nor can
they keep him from a felon's cell.
The people of this State gave him,
without price, the benefit of the high
est education at the'r command.
They searched the world over to pro
vide him with the best and most
highly trained educators. They sur
rounded him, during the four years
of his University life, with every up
lifting influence to bring out the high
est and best within him and asked
of him in return nothing but decent
citizenship. He repaid all this gener
osity and kindness by becoming the
people's worst enemy, by seeking to
undermine the very foundations of
government, by using his influence to
elect to public office weak and vicious
men. He employed his keen mind
and his sharpened wits, trained at
public expense, to evade and circum
vent the law, to corrupt its officials,
and to loot the city. Thus, he has
branded himself a base ingrate, and
as great a traitor to the republic in
time of peace as was Benedict Arnold
in time of war. No better object les
son is needed to show that the mere
piling up of gold counts after all for
little. That wealth stacked up nioun

tain high, and wealth alone, does ntx
make for happiness or for success,
that a dry crust with a pure heart
and clean hands is by far the better
lot, and that talent and mental train
ing are dangerous qualities to the
state and to the individual when mis
used and misdirected.
The same temptations that came to
Abraham Reuf, perhaps in somewhat
different form, came to Heney—and
are going to come to you. It remains
to be seen whether, like Reuf, you
will be weak and fall, or like Heney
you will remain strong and stand.
Do not pray to be kept out of
temptations; pray for strength to re
sist them. He who was never tempt
ed may be innocent, but he is not
necessarily virtuous. Virtue lies not
in ignorancc of wrong doing, but in
the power to resist. He who was
never tempted to do wrong knoweth
not himself and may be filled with
criminal instincts that are simply
awaiting an opportunity for their ex
ercise.
Whatever may be your sphere of
life, whether you enter the professions
or become a part of the business
world, temptations will surround you
on all sides. As a lawyer you will be
tempted to seek victory rather than
justice. As a preacher you will be
tempted to say what your congrega
tion likes to hear rather than what it
should hear. As a physician you will
be tempted to exaggerate the ills of
your patients and prolong their sick
ness that your fees may be fattened.
As a business man you will be
tempted hourly to lie and deceive in
order to increase profits, as an em
ployer the temptations will be strong
to underpay and overwork your de
pendents. As a public official you will
find yourself struggling between the
conflicting claims of duty and self
interest. Go where you will, do what
you may, you will find no escape from
temptation.
All the years of your life to this
very hour have been simply prepara
tory. You have been laying in stores
that about to be drawn upon.
If your ideals have been low, your
ambitions base, your thoughts im
pure, God help you unless you quickly
change directions and start out in a
new way.
Possibilities are greater today than
ever before. A man in a given time
can now rise higher or sink lower
than hitherto in history. If you are
bent on going to Hell you can get
there quicker today than could your
father, or your father's father. At no
previous time were there so many
clever men and women as now lying
awake nights devising short cuts to
lead you to damnation, by making
vice more and more attractive. At no
previous time, on the other hand, so
great as now for character combined
with ability to reach higher rungs on
the ladder of achievement.
Society has paid its debt to you by
giving you everything that makes for
the highest type of citizenship and
manhood. It remains to be seen
whether you are made of the stuff
that appreciates blessings and is will
ing to repay them.
Tt has been pointed out that college
cannot furnish wits, it can simply
sharpen them. Your wits have been
sharpened. If you become rogues

you are likely to become more clever
rogues than if you had not been here.
If you are to become high-minded
men your training here should more
speedily push you upward. The
power has become yours to be used
for weal or woe.
Even in the past all men were not a
unit in favor of college training.
Some of the world's strongest and
ablest minds looked with disfavor
upon a university career. Listen to
some of them. Herbert Spencer said:
"Though academic training gives
certain fulness of information, and a
readiness to use it in ordinary ways,
it diminishes the ability to use in
formation in ways which are not or
dinary."
John Ericson, when a friend ex
pressed his regret that Ericson had
not been graduated from some tech
nical institute, the great engineer an
swered that the fact was very fortun
ate. If he had taken, he said, a
course at such an institution he would
have acquired such a belief in author
ities that he would never have been
able to develop originality and make
his own way in physics and mechan
ics.
Edison, probably the most mar
velous inventor who ever lived, is
quoted as having said that college
bred men were of no use in his es
tablishments, and that the men who
had not passed through the approved
curriculum were better. He is said
further to have pointed out that Sir
Benjamin Baker, who designed and
executed Furth Bridge, the greatest
and most remarkable bridge in the
world, received no regular engineer
ing training.
Ingersoll said: "You have 110 idea
how many men are spoiled by what
is called education. For the most
part college is where pebbles are pol
ished and diamonds dimmed. If
Shakespere had graduated at Oxford
he might have been a grubbing at
torney or a poor person."
All this was said of the college of
the past. Experience has brought
with it wisdom, and wisdom has led
to a change in college educational
methods. I think it can be truth
fully said that the modern college
earnestly strives to encourage original
research and the spirit of initiative.
It would be unfortunate if it were
true that the university of today
stunts and blunts originality. Pri
marily it should teach how to find in
formation when it is needed, and how
to get an adequate acquaintance with
facts. The student should be taught
to rely chiefly upon his reason, and
encouraged not to accept blindly the
statements of authorities. He should
be trained, as I believe he is trained,
to think, and to think for himself and
by himself, thus profiting by all the
advantages that an academic training
can give and escaping all its disad
vantages.
