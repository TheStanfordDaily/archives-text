From the number of applications
on file in the Registrar's office, the
Class of 1911, which comes into ex
istence tomorrow, should be one of
the largest in the history of Stanford.
There is little doubt but that these
new men and women will become a
strong and virile part of the under
graduate body. We hope to see
them imbrued with a great spirit of
loyalty to the University and active
in all branches of student life. To
ward tliis end their first step should
be the payment of the Student Body

which is levied upon all Stanford stu

and other activities. Without' the

may become a member of the Asso
ciated Students or cast a vote ; n the
Student Body elections.
