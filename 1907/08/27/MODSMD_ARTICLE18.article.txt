After the adjustment of the stone
cutters' strike, which lasted three
months, work was resumed on the
repairing of the University build
ings the fifth of the present month.
Almost one year ago the reconstruc
tion work on the Chemistry and His
tory buildings was commenced, and
these structures have now been prac
tically rebuilt. At present a large
force of workmen are engaged in re
pairing the Zoology building.
The Geology and Mining Depart
ments will receive attention as soon
as the work now under way is com
pleted.
It is uncertain just when work
will be begun upon the Memorial
Church, but the authorities hope to
put a force of men there in the near
future.
