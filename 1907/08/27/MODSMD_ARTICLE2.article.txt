# COACHES RETURN SOON
## LANAGAN AND PRESLEY EXPECTED NEXT WEEK. The 						Cardinal Will Have Eight Veterans For 1907 Teamâ€”Stanford Field Widened. 
### 
After an absence of over three
months, advisory Coach J. F. Lana
->an, 00, and Field Coach G. T. Frc : -
ley, '07, who have been to New Zeal
and Australia in the interests
of Rugby at Stanford, will return to
the University within the next
The Cardinal coaches are due to ar
rive in San .Francisco from Vancou
ver, B. C., about September 1.
Coach Lanagan was the guest of
the New Zealand Rugby Union while
in the Antipodes, leaving Coach Pres
ley in Australia, where he witnessed
the interstate games played in Bris
bane between the New South Wales
team and the New Zealand All-
Blacks. The Stanford men were not
only spectators of the big matches,
but also gained experience by partic
ipating in actual play with some of
the greatest experts of Austrfalia.
From the accounts of Americans who
met Lanagan and Presley this sum
mer, both coaches are much impress
ed with the game of Rugby as played
by the fast fifteens in the islands.
It is difficult to predict what foot
ball situation Lanagan and Presley
will face when they return. At pres
ent there are only eight veterans who
are sure to be on the field for this
season's Varsity. This number in
cludes, among the forwards, Captain
W. Koerner, '08, J. R. Pemberton, '08,
L. R. Minturn, '09, and C. Thorpe, '09.
The men behind the scrum who reg
istered today are L. M. Edwards, '07,
center; K. L. Fenton, '08, fullback;
C. C. Owen, '09, half; and J. R. Hol
man, '09, wing.
The loss of three of the Cardinal's
forwards, A. A. Molfino, ex-'o7, J. N.
Stanford, '07, and H. P. Cheda, '10,
leaves the scrum materially weakened.
Not only will these men be absent
from the University this semester,
but R. H. Conant, '08, substitute in
the scrum, and one of the strongest
men 011 the varsity squad last season
has also signified his intention of not
returning to college this year. W. 11.
Stark, '09, the other substitute for
ward of last season's fifteen, 'i ex
pected to appear on the field as a can
didate for the scrum.
E. P. Stott, ex-'o7, and A. J. Chalm
ers, ex-'o7, two of last season's backs,
will in all likelihood be among the ab
sent, although there is a possibility
that the latter may register. To fill
the positions back of the scrum there
will be more material among the old
students this year than will be avail
able for the scrum. G. D. Hussey, '09,
and C. Cook, '10, substitutes, are men
well qualified to do fast work there.
A trio of sprinters who will probably
don suits this fall are T. Vandervoort,
'08, M. E. Reed, '10, and L. S. Scott,
'10.
Stanford field has been widened
nearly a hundred feet in preparation
for this season's training. Grass has
been sown there, and the held is cov
ered with a soft turf which probably
cannot be played on for a month. In
this event cither the old football field
or the baseball diamond will be used
for the first practice.
