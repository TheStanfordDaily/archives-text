# MURPHY MAY NOT RETURN
## CARDINAL COACH HAS OFFERS FROM PORTLAND. Stanford Eight Loses Hard Race to University of Washington in .. the North. 
### 
The prospect of Dan Murphy's re
turn to Stanford to take charge of
the crews next spring is at the best
doubtful. The cardinal rowing coach
spent a couple of months during this
summer with the Portland Rowing
Club, and has been offered a contract
for a year by that organization. On
the other hand Murphy is anxious
to train the Cardinal for another year,
as lie is confident that he could turn
out a coast championship crew, and
is anxious to meet Washington again
with a Stanford eight.
Crippled by the absence of Pem
berton, Stark, and Shutts, Murphy's
crew went down to defeat in the four
mile race against the University of
Washington which was held the lat
ter part of May.
The northern crew got away much
faster than did the Stanford men,
and on account of both boats steer
ing a trifle off the course the Cardinal
eight was swung directly in the wake
of their opponents and in "dead wa
ter." They were unable to get out
of this position for over half the race.
At the two-mile mark the Stanford
crew dropped back in order to get a
clearance for an attempt to pass the
other boat, giving the Washington
men a lead of five lengths. From this
point to the stake boat was a stub
born race, Stanford always slowly
gaining, the northern crew crossing
the line two lengths ahead of the
Cardinal. The winning time was
twenty-three minutes and twenty
nine seconds.
