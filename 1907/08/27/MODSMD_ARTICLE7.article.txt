# Registration is Light.
## 
### 
Up to the hour of going to press
850 old students had registered in
the University. These figures show
a light registration when compared
with the number of undergraduates
entered on the first day of last year.
Of the students registered today,
between 775 and 800 paid the Student
Body assessment. The receipts of
the management, therefore, are at
least $1550. The Registrar's office will
be open from 7:30 this evening to 9.
New students will register tomorrow.
