The place of the Daily Palo Alto
in Stanford life has become so well
defined during the fifteen years of
its existence as the official organ of
the Student Body that an editorial an
nouncement at this time is hardly ne
cessary. From the date of the first
issue the staffs have worked to im
prove the tone of the paper and to
render more effective its news ser
vice, always striving to place it on a
j ane with the best of American col
ge dailies. Guided by editors of
bility the paper has had a steady
growth. The experiences of the pio
neer days pointed the way to reforms
in the various departments which
have gradually been adopted, improv
ing the service and approaching the
time when it will be possible to col
lect the maximum amount of news
and give it to the college public in
the minimum amount of time. To
guard against any retrogression in
the efficiency of the paper and to
make a strong effort toward progress
is the trust imposed upon the pres
ent staff.
The Daily Palo Alto has long been
pledged to a policy of conservatism,
and any departure from such an
excellent custom would be most un
welcome. During the present semes
ter, therefore, this paper will attempt
to give to Stanford students a clear
and straightforward account of the
daily news of the University. Its
aim will be to cover all fields of stu
dent and faculty activity and also
to collect in its columns news from
the outside college world which may
be of special interest to Stanford
men and women. Editorially the
Daily Palo Alto will follow the broad
general lines laid down by its prede
cessors, voicing what it considers to
be the best sentiment of the Student
Body upon questions of vital interest
to the University.
A departure will be made this sem

ester in taking the paper to Palo Al
to to be printed. Although such a
step will naturally result in making
the work of the staff more difficult,
it was forced on the management by
the lack of a linotype on the campus.
The news will be collected in the
same manner as in preceding semes
ters, and every effort will be made to
have t' t e change noticeable to no one
bit those directly connected with the
paper.
