ference held by Coach James F. Lana
gan, Captain W. Koerner, '08, and
Graduate Manager D. D. Sales, prior
to the departure of Lanagan and Pres
ley to the Antipodes, this date was
set and it was decided to hold the
big opening rally the evening of the

results of this consultation today and
stated the coaches would probably ar
rive upon the campus as late as Sep
tember 6.
During the summer vacation Man
ager Sales has been in communication
with outside teams which will play
Rugby this year and has arranged a
partial schedule of games. Among
the opponents of the Varsity this year,
will be the Vancouver players and the
University of Nevada fifteen, the on
ly aggregations which were seen last
year. Pomona college, after
giving both games a trial, has decided
definitely to abolish Rugby and play
only the old game. This will elimin
ate them from the list of opponents.
To take the place of the Pomona
players Manager Sales expects to ar
range for a series with the Rugby
players of San Francisco. Stanford
will itieet Nevada here on October 17,
and the Vancouver players will visit
the campus for a scries of two games

month.
