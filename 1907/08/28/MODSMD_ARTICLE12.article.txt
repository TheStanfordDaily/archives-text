Stanford faces once more the possi
bility of losing Coach Murphy. The
Student Body is well aware of what
this man has done for boating 011 the
Pacific Coast and the success he has
had in the building up of winning
crews. Murphy came here in the
spring of 1906, and, undismayed by a
green squad and the lack of adequate
facilities for training, developed a
crew which rowing men declare
would have made record time had not
the earthquake put an end to the
sport. Last year with the introduc
tion of varsity eights on the coast,
Murphy gave us a clean sweep of
victories in the preliminary races at
Venice, and both Varsity and Fresh
men won in the intercollegiate regat
ta with the University of California.
Later, in the North, a crippled Stan
ford eight went down to defeat after
a hard, close race with the University
of Washington. These facts speak
for themselves. Murphy should be
retained, and steps should be taken
in that direction before it is too late.
