In the announcement columns of
this issue of the Daily Palo Alto will
be found a few lines informing the
Class of iyri where they may pro
cure the Freshman cap. The custom
of wearing this headgear was inaugur
ated by the Freshmen last year, and
proved a most excellent idea. The
three upper classes have long had dis
tinctive hats and there is no reason
why the entering class should be
without them. The cap is in no sense
a mark of dishonor. It serves to in
form the new student who his class
mates are, and aids in developing a
healthy class spirit. For these reasons
we urge every man who registered
today to secure a cap at once and
wear it.
