# Fraternities Will Occupy New Houses
## 
### 
During the summer vacation work
has been rushed on the fraternity
houses in course of construction, and
by the close of the week three new
houses will be occupied. The Theta
Delta Chi house, outside the south
gate, has been completed some time,
but the scarcity of labor and material
has delayed the construction of the
other two. The new Gamma Phi
Beta house is already occupied, al
though the building is not yet com
pleted. The Delta Tau Delta house
will be ready for occupancy about the
llrst of the month. The Chi Psi
Lodge, which was damaged at the
time of the earthquake, has been re
paired and the members of that fra
ternity are again at home there.
