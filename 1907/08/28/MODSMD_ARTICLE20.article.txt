# CLIFT WILL EDIT ALUMNUS.
## Executive Committee Discuss Plans For a Club House. 
### 
At the last meeting of the execu
tive committee of the Stanford Alum
ni Association, D. H. Clift, '07, was
elected editor of the "Alumnus," to
succeed \Y. H. Thompson, '05. Clift,
who graduated last May, is promin
ently connected with journalism, lie
edited the "Chaparral" in his Senior
year at the University, and recently
assumed the editorship of the "Over
land" Magazine. Clift was a member
of Encina" Club.
The Alumni committee also brought
up for discussion the question of an
Alumni clubhouse to be built on the
Campus. It was decided that the
only possible plan at present would
be to construct a small building, not
to exceed a cost of $15,000. If suffi
cient support is pledged by the mem
bers of the Association, who are now
being consulted, the committee will
take further steps toward carrying out
the present plans.
