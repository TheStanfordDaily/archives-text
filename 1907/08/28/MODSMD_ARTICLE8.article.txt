### 
F. W. Turner, '08, is in receipt of a
letter from Dan Murphy, Stanford's
rowing coach for the past two years,
in which Murphy practically refuses
to further consider the salary for
which lie was engaged last year. The
Cardinal coach states that he lias re
ceived better offers from other insti
tutions and that much as lie would
like to return here he feels that lie
cannot afford to refuse the terms of
fered elsewhere. "I came to Stan
ford," Murphy writes, "for two years
on a six months' contracts in an en
deavor to establish myself. I must
have a year's contract if I am to re
turn."
