# APPROVE MAJOR SYSTEM
## SUB-COMMITTEE SUBMITS STATISTICAL REPORTS. Investigations Result in Retention of Old Methods.â€”Entrance Requirements Raised. 
### 
The sub-committee, which was ap
pointed four years ago by the ex
ecutive committee of the Academic
Council to conduct a thorough en
quiry into the advisability of retain
ing the major subject system, has
finally made its report. The com
mittee, composed of Registrar Elli
ott, Professors Gilbert, Adfims, Fair
clough, and Clark, has compiled a
statistical record of its researches
in support of its conclusions.
That the present system is more
efficient than one of entrance re
quirements and courses of study in
which a greater portion of the work
of the students is specifically pre
scribed, is the general conclusion of
the committee. Many suggestions
and some criticisms were received
from the heads of departments. The
general tone of these communica
tions indicates approval of the ex
isting system, but that a few alter
ations would greatly strengthen it.
While a few weak points in the pres
ent system have been brought to
light, on the whole it is deemed to
be the superior plan of instruction.
The judgment of the sub-committee
in brief is as follows:
1. The major subject system
should be retained.
2. The authority of the major
department should be more strictly
defined.
3. At least sixty units of the work
required for the Bachelor's Degree
should be taken outside of the ma
jor and closely related departments.
4. The arrangement of a so-caled
university group is undesirable.
5. Statistics, similar to those
compiled by the present sub-commit
tee, should be gathered at the end of
the next four year period for the
purpose of further ascertaining the
working of the major subject sys
tem.
In keeping with its policy of rais
ing the standard of scholarship, the
Committee on Admission and Ad
vanced Standing has this year made
the entrance requirements more
stringent than ever before. The
regulation which formerly admitted
students to the University on par
tial standing lias been abolished.
Hereafter all applicants for admis
sion must have fifteen full credits.
