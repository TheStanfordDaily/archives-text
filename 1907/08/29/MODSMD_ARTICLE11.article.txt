It is a source of satisfaction to know
that the so-called football rush be
tween the Freshman and Sophomore
Classes, which was substituted last
year for the good old-fashioned strug
gle in Encina Hall, is to be abolished.
The experiment of allowing three
hundred men from the lower classes
to fight aimlessly around over Stan
for field with a football lost some
where among them was a decided fail
ure. It failed to remove the Faculty
objection to the old rush, the danger
of serious injury to the participants,
and it failed from a student stand
point in that the contest was neither
football nor rush, but a very poor
combination of the two. At several
of the Eastern Universities, notably
Columbia, the rope-tying contest is in
vogue, and seems to be a success.
Little is known of it on this coast but
it promises to be a decided improve
ment over the poor exhibition given
last year.
