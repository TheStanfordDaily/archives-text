# University Inn is Crowded.
## 
### 
The University Inn has had the
most auspicious opening in its his
tory. About one hundred and sixty
eight men are being accommodated
and only a few more vacancies re
main. This large volume of business
has made necessary a much larger
working force than formerly, and the
small rooms, surrounding the main
dining hall, have been converted in
to dining rooms in order to meet the
demand.
A transient service, to accommodate
tourists, has been inaugurated, but
accommodations for this trade will
depend upon the size of the regular
business.
