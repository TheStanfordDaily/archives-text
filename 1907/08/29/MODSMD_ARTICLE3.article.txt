# BUSINESS IS WAITING
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO MEET SOON. Will Make Arrangements for Filling Vacancies in Student Body Positions. 
### 
At the first meeting of the Execu
tive Committee, which will probably
be called within a few days, two mat
ters of urgency will receive the con
sideration of the governing body of
the Associated Students. These will
be the choice of a Graduate Manager
to succeed D. D. Sales, '06, who will
tender his resignation preliminary to
leaving the University, and the selec
tion of a Senior to till the place on
the committee left vacant by the fail
ure of R. H. Conant, '08, to return
to college.
Two methods of filling Sales' posi
tion are open to the discretion of the
Executive Committee. That body may
appoint his successor or may call a
special election for the office. The
later method has been the one most
frequently employed under like con
ditions.
The representatives from the three
upper classes are named by the com
mittee when vacancies occur after the
regular annual election. President A.
A. Murphy, '08, is expected to arrive <
av the University in a day or two. Tf
he summons the committee to meet
next week at the time formerly in
vogue, the meeting will be held Wed
nesday evening.
