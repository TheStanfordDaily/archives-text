# SETTLEMENT WORK STARTED.
## Five Hundred Dollars Is Already Pledged and Many Persons Interested This Summer. 
### 
During the past summer the divis
ion Heads of the Stanford Junior Set
tlement have been engaged in spread
ing the Settlement idea in their re
spective districts and with the open
ing of the present semester those in
chargc of the work are satisfied at the
prospect of a settlement which the
summer's work has made possible.
The committee in charge now have
pledged sums aggregating nearly five
hundred dollars and as no attempt
whatever was made to obtain pledges
of money this summer but merely to
put the plan before the public, there
will undoubtedly be many contribu
tions made when subscriptions are so
licited.
The purpose of the Stanford Junior
Settlement will be, when incorporated,
to provide wholesome surroundings
under which children from the slum
districts and other undesirable local
ities may be enabled to receive edu
cation and, in return, will be expected
to provide partial support for the set
tlement.
