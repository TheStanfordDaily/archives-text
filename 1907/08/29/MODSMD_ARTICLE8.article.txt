# UNDER CLASSES TO MEET
## ROPE-TYING CONTEST TO BE HELD SEPTEMBER 14. Regulated Struggle To Be Substituted For Football Rush of Last Year. 
### 
The second organized rush between
the Sophomore and Freshman classes
will lie held 011 the old football field
Saturday, September 14. Last year
about three hundred representatives
of the Classes of 1909 and 1910 met on
the oval, and a football rush ensued
i 1 which the object was for one class
to carry a Rugby football through the
men of the opposing class to a touch
down.
The second rush is to be conducted
011 entirely new lines. A rope-tying
contest will be held in which twenty
live picked men of each class will par
ticipate. Each man will be supplied
with rope and at the end of thirty
minutes the class which has succeeded
in tying the greater number of their
opponents will be declared the victor.
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, and Pro
fessor W. F. Durand, chairman of
Student Affairs Committee, are in fa
vor of the plan. When consulted by
Piesident Cadwalader of the Class of
1909, who will take charge of the
Freshmen, Dr. Angell said: "Such an
organized rope-tying contest as sug
gested meets with Mr. Durand's and
my approval, provided the members
of the two classes who do not par
ticipate will agree to keep out of the
contest when the thirty minutes of
competition are over."
President Cadwalader will call the
Freshmen together 011 Tuesday, Sep
tember 3. at 1:10 in room 68. The
Sophomores will meet to-morrow at
1:10 in room 68.
