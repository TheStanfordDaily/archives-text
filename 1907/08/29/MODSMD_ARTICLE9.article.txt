# TRACK WORK BEGINS SOON.
## Big Rally Will Be Held on Captain Lanagan's Arrival.â€”"Dad" Moulton Returns. 
### 
"Dad" Moulton, Stanford's veteran
trainer, arrived on the Campus yes
terday and announced his intention
of instituting fall training for tliQ
track squad. This will consist of
light work and cross country runs.
Moulton expects in this way not only
to put the members of the squad in
good condition hut at the same time
to get a line on the new material.
Last year no fall training was par
ticipated in by the track men but
Moulton now considers such work es
sential to putting the men in the
best possible shape for the intercol
legiate meet. TTc said this afternoon:
"1 am goitig to start the track men
in fall training as soon as possible,
probably before Captain Lanagan's re
turn. Upon Lanagan's arrival a track
rally will be held at which all can
didates for the track team will sign
up. Of course the men who are out
for football will not be expected to
take part in the fall track work. Last
year's experience demonstrates the
necessity of fall training."
