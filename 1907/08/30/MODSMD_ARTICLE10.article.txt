The constitution of the Associated
Students leaves to the discretion of
the Executive Committee the man
ner of filling vacant offices in the
Student Body. While they may elect
Sales' successor in one of their
sessions and be well within their
legal rights as the governing
body, it would seem that by
far the safer and wiser plan would
be to declare an election and leave
this important decision to their con
stituents. In the way of precedent
the present generation of undergrad
uates remembers the action of last
year's Committee, who declared a
general election for the offices of edi
tor of the Daily Palo Alto and edi
tor of the "Sequoia." The position of
Graduate Manager is the most impor
tant in the Student Body and carries
with it a large salary. It calls for a
good man and Stanford undergradu
ates are vitaly interested in seeing
that a good man fills the office. It
is their right to make the decision,
and once the burden of that decision
i- thrown upon them the affair is
closed in a manner which admits of
no criticism.
