The effort made last semester by
the Student Body, acting through the
President's Conference, to secure
lights 011 University Avenue, seems
to have met the fate of all other at
tempts to secure this much needed
improvement. The Conference se
cured a promise of immediate action
from the Trustees, and the Finance
Committee of the Board even went
so far as to advertise for bids for
the erection of lights on one side of
the Avenue. The first lot of bids
were all rejected and although three
months have elapsed no further ac
tion has been taken. The need of

lights 011 the Avenue is so apparent j
and so imperative that it calls for 110
argument in its favor, but those who
use the Avenue at night are still com
pelled to run the risk of serious ac
cident in the darkness. Evidently it
will take such an accident and the re
sulting suit for damages to call the I
attention of the Trustees to the ab
solute necessity of an adequate light
ing system.
