# NEW PLANS FOR RUSH
## SOPHOMORES REJECT ROPETYING CONTEST. Adopt Resolutions Favoring a Cane-Rush to Decide Class Supremacy 
### 
The proposed rope-tying contest,
which was to he substituted for the
football rush of last year, was reject
ed by the Sophomore Class at a meet
ing this afternoon, and in its stead
the class expressed itself in favor of
a cane-rush similar to that in vogue
in several of the Eastern Universi
ties, where the whole class partici
pates in the event.
The chief objection to the plans
for the rope-tying contest was in the
fact that it prevents any but a small
proportion of the class from taking
p;irt, and that such a contest, won or
lost by a picked team, would in no
way decide class supremacy.
The form of rush which met with
the approval of the class is in some
respects similar to the football rush
of last year. Five or ten men of each
class will be in the center of the field
in possesion of the cme which is the
object of the rush, with the remain
der of each class grouped at either
end of the field. Upon a signal these
groups will rush forward and endea
vor to get possession of the cane. At
the end of the time allotted for the
struggle, the class having the greater
number of hands on the cane will win
it as a trophy, and hold the suprem
acy for the year.
The final decision as to the kind
ot rush instituted rests with the up
pcrclassmen and the Faculty commit
tee, so that the action of the class
today is in effect only a suggestion
expressing the sentiment of the Soph
omores on the subject. A commit
tee composed of C. F. Ganong, G. C.
Faulkner, H. H. Maundrell, E. K.
Meredith, and H. P. Cheda, chairman,
was appointed to bring the matter
before the Faculty and a committee
of five Juniors to he appointed by
President Cadwalader, and will en
deavor to secure the form of rush fav
orable to the majority of the class.
The only other form of contest con
sidered at the meeting today was the
solid-rank military rush of the Cor
nell underclassmen.
