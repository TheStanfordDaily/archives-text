# GOOD BASEBALL OUTLOOK
## MANY VETERANS RETURN FOR 1908 SEASON. Material Expected From Entering Class:â€”No Fall Training For Squad. 
### 
Stanford's prospects for a winning
baseball team in the season of 1008
look bright at the present time, owing
to the large number of veterans who
have returned this fall. The loss of
two catchers and a first baseman will
be keenly felt in the absence of Stott,
Difily and Presley from the squad, but
C. F. Ganong, '10. who showed up
well in the Tnterclass series, should
prove a valuable man behind the bat.
Owen, who took Presley's place sev
eral times last season, should be well
able to cover first base.
Thiele will be back this year and
Witmer will be eligible to contest in
the Varsity games, so the pitching
staff should he very strong. In addi
tion to the men who were on last
year's squad. Bell, who played on the
'06 Varsity will lie back to try for
his old position, and with Kenton on
third and Sampson and Cadwalader to
try for shortstop, the infield should
lie fast and strong.
In the outfield Scott and Wirt will
be candidates for position- besides
several men who showed up well dur
ing the Interclass series last year.
With the players who will un
doubtedly be brought out of the en
tering class, the team should have
good material uj on which to start the
season.
It is understood ;it present that
there will be no fall training for the
squad, but this will not be definitely
decided until after the return of
Coaches Lanagan and Presley.
