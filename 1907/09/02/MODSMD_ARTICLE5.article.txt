# JORDAN TALKS OF RUGBY
## SCRUMS SMALL FEATURE OF AUSTRALIAN GAME. Few Australian Teams are Comprised of College Men.â€”Punting Americans' Weakness.

President Jordan was in his office to
day for the first time since his re
turn from Boston. He is enthusias
tic over the Rugby football lie has
seen in Australia. Regarding the dif
ference in style of play he says:
"Our chief weakness in playing as
compared with the style of play which
T saw in Australia and New Zeal
and is kicking. Over there the play
ers kick over their heads, in this way
saving much valuable time. Our men
are generally lighter and faster, hav
ing better physical form. The strong
est single team which I saw engaged
in the game was the University of
Sydney, where eight hundred students
are registered. The All-Blacks, how
ever, composed the best aggregation.
The members of the latter team are
chosen from the Auckland, Welling
ton, Christ's Church and Dunedin
teams. Nine-tenths of the players
on Rugby teams are not members of
colleges. They grow up with Rugby
just as Americans do with baseball.
Few scrums are held. Line-outs I
replace them to a large extent. Ev- I
ery little town boasts a team. One i
Rugby league has a membership of
twelve teams. Games are played ev
ery Saturday. Australian workmen 1
receive a half-holiday on Saturday.
As a result the attendance at games
is large. Twenty thousand spectators j
witnessed one contest in Sydney.
"Lanagan and Presley were royally
treated wherever they went. In Syd

ney they were tendered ;i banquet
at which both of them made speeches.
Neither Lanagan nor Presley donned
suits during their trip, but they were
given every opportunity to study the
game as spectators. Lanagan favors
the use of the Australian rules with
no revision whatsoever. Both of our
coaches played a few games of base
hall. Lanagan taught the Australians
how to pitch curves, something en
tirely new to them and a source of
great astonishment.'
