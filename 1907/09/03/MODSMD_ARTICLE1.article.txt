# Fairbanks Speaks at Assembly Tomorrow.
## Coaches Reach Campus Lanagan and Presley Conclude Long Trip. 
### 
The two Stanford coaches, J. F.
Lanagan, '00, and G. J. Presley, '07,
returned to the Campus this afternoon
from Australia and New Zealand,
where they have spent the last few
months studying Rugby. The trip
proved most successful, and both the
travelers are confident that great re
sults will he obtained from the vast
knowledge of the finer points of the
game which they picked up during
the summer. For seven weeks Lana
gan and Presley were constantly with
the famous players of Australia, and
in talking with men they learned
fully as much as they did witnessing
the actual games. Rugby, as played
by the leading teams of the Antipodes,
opened the coaches' eyes to the possi
bilities of the game, and they are now
more enthusiastic than ever as to its
merits.
Lanagan and Presley left the Uni
versity on May to, sailing from Van
couver five days later. After a pleas
ant voyage they arrived in Sydney on

June 17. They were very cor
dially welcomed by the lead
ing members of the New
South Wales Rugby Union,
who did everything in their
power to make their stay
beneficial. Besides seeing the
Sydney Varsity in action sev
eral times, the pair also had
several chats with some of
the great exponents residing
there. After remaining a
week Lanagan sailed for
Welllington, and Presley left
soon afterwards for Brisbane
with the New South Wales
team.
On arriving in Wellington,
Lanagan immediately made
the acquaintance of the All-
Blacks, the representative
New Zealand fifteen. This
all-star aggregation, the peer
of all Rugby teams, had been
together only a few days, and
the men were practising hard
before leaving 011 their tour
of Australia. After spending
ten very profitable days in
Wellington, Lanagan sailed
with the All-Blacks for Syd
ney.
In the meantime, Presley
had been staying in Brisbane
with the New South Wales
fifteen, which defeated the
Queensland team in all of
their three matches. He re
turned to Sydney just before
the arrival of Lanagan and
the All-Blacks.
During the next four weeks
the two lived at the same
hotel with the New Zeal
anders, following them wher-

ever they went. Thus the coaches
saw six of the seven games which the
All-Blacks played in Australia, the
last occurring after they had left.
I'our of the contests took place in
Sydney and three in Brisbane, the All-
Blacks winnig five, tying one and los
ing one. They won the series with
Queensland and All-Australia, tying
with New South Wales.
The playing of the New Zealand
team was really marvelous. The
hacks possessed wonderful speed and
precision, while the forwards, al
though averaging over 185 pounds,
were also fast as well as very aggres
sive. They were always right 011 top
(if the ball, and their playing in the
loose was remarkable. But the work
of the backs easily ranks first from a
spectacular point of view. Their pass
ing rushes were a revelation. Only
those who have seen them speeding
down the field can realize that such
precision is possible in Rugby. The
playing of the New South Wales and
Queensland teams was of a high-class

order also, but cannot be compared
with the work of the All-Blacks.
The Rugby of Australia does not
differ in the least from the game
played here last year. But the play
ing of the teams in the Antipodes
makes the game highly interesting to
the spectator. The crowds are enor
mous and the enthusiasm great. All
the players are strictly amateurs, and
professionalism will not be counten
anced.
As for the scrum: New Zealand
u>es the seven-pack and the wing
forward, while New South Wales and
Queensland play the eight-pack with
no wing-forward. In the latter case
the half puts the ball into play and
then runs around to his position be
hind* the scrum. Each pack has its
advantages, and Lanagan intends to
test both thoroughly.
Lanagan and Presley were royally
entertained every place they went.
During their stay in Australia they
were the guests of the New South
Wnles Rugby Union. All the foot
ballers did everything possible for the
pair, and both the coaches returned
with large, handsomely framed pho
tographs of the New Zealand team,
presented to them by the All-Blacks
themselves.
Lanagan hopes that some games
may be arranged with an Australian
team during the season of 1908. The
New South Wales fifteen will pass
through Vancouver 011 its way to
England in September of that year,
and they can probably be induced to
come south and meet Stanford and
California. Furthermore, the Univer
sity of Sydney team is desirous of
making a trip to the Coast about a
year hence. Although Stanford would
not have much chance against New
South Wales, the coaches think that
the Cardinal would stand up fairly
well against the collegians.
Lanagan and Presley left Australia
on August 7, and arrived in Vancou
ver on August 30. There they were
assured by R. Woodward, manager
of the Vancouver fifteen, that his
team would make the trip to Califor
nia again this fall. Woodward was
also enthusiastic about playing the
New South Wales and Sydney fif
teens, if these matches could possibly
be arranged.
