According to the plans now being
outlined, the University Glee Club will
soon be holding regular practice.
Leader J. J. Hill, '08, is well pleased
with the prospects for the coming
year. Twenty-four veteran Varsity
glee men have already registered.
Moreover, it is understood that the
Class of 191 1 contains a large amount
of promising material.
Leader Hill desires to begin work
with as many men as possible, at
least sixty. Work will start the com
ing week, the preliminary tryout being
held next Monday evening. The same
system of selecting eligibles for the
Glee from the candidates will be em
ployed as was employed last year.
Professor Roland Roberts, the Palo
Alto vocal instructor, assisted by
members of the Glee Club Executive
Committee, will conduct the tryouts.
Besides the possibility of a trip for
the Combined Musical Clubs, a ser
ies of concerts are being planned by
Leader Hill. There are also plans 011
foot for a minstrel show to be given
early in October by the Glee Club, as
sisted by the other musical organi
zations.
