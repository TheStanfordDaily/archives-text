# Australians May Enter Stanford.
## 
### 
President Jordan is authority for
the statement that about a dozen
Australians have planned to enter
Stanford this year. Tf they come,
they will accompany Coaches Lan
agan and Presley to the campus. It
is probable that among their number
will be several Rugby players. In
structor Jordan, recently appointed
to a position in the Electrical En
gineering department, will probably
be among the party.
