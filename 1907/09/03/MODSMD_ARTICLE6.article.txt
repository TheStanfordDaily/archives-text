A glance back over the athletic his
tory of the past two years shows that
Stanford is already deeply interested
in International contests. In the
spring of 1905 the Varsity diamond
was the scene of the first baseball
game between Japanese and Ameri
can college students. The agitation
for a return trip, to be taken by the
Cardinal nine during the summer va
cation, finally came to nothing, but
this first invasion of American ath
letic circles by the team from across
the Pacific should be the entering
wedge for future athletic relations
with Japan. The series of Rugby
contests with the English teams of
Canada, which were played last year
at Stanford and in the North, are to
be continued this season and probably
in the future. As a result of the vis
it of Lanagan and Presley to the An
tipodes the season of 1908 should
see the Australian and New Zealand
teams meet the Cardinal here. This
growth of international courtesy
should be in every possible way en
couraged. Stanford's position 011 the
Pacific Coast makes it natural that
our athletic relations should extend
to the universities of the Far East
rather than those of England and the
Continent. We shall learn much from
a friendly rivalry with the teams of
the Antipodes and we look forward
to the time when the teams of British
Columbia, Australia, New Zealand,
and Japan will be placed on a per
manent schedule with those of Stan
ford.
