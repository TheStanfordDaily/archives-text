# ELECTION FOR MANAGER
## THREE UPPER CLASSES TO SELECT CANDIDATE. Executive Committee Will Make Formal Appointment After Students' Choice Is Known. 
### 
The manner of filling the vacancy
in the office of Graduate Manager,
caused by the resignation of D. D.
Sales, '06, was brought up and dis
posed of at the meeting of the Exec
utive Committee of the Student Body
held in the reception room of En
cina Hall yesterday evening.
The committee was unwilling to
assume the responsibility of naming
a successor to Sales, and it was there
fore decided to permit all members of
the three upper classes, who have al
ready paid their Student Body as
sessment, to register their choice in
favor of one of the two candidates,
the Executive Committee pledging it
self to formally elect after the stu
dents have signified their choice.
The polls will be open next Friday
between the hours of 10 and 2:30 for
this purpose. The committee did not
deem it desirable to call a general
election because of the fact that the
entering Freshmen are ignorant of
the qualifications of the two candi
dates. The sense of the committee is
expressed in the following resolu
tions
Whereas, It is the duty of the Ex
ecutive Committee, under the consti
tution of the Associated Students, to
fill all vacancies occurring in Student
Body offices,
And whereas, The Executive Com
mittee does not wish to assume the
responsibility of appointing a Grad
uate Manager to fill the vacancy in
that office, be it
Resolved, That it be submitted to
those of the three upper classes who
have paid their Student Body assess
ment to recommend which of the two
candidates, G. Knupp, '07, or L. M.
Edwards, '07, they would desire to
fill that office, the Executive Commit
tee pledging itself to adopt such re
commendation.
M. P. Davis, '08, was appointed to
succeed R. H. Conant, '08, as repre
sentative of the Senior Class on ihe
Committee. Davis registers in the
Mechanical Engineering department.
He is a prominent track athlete, win
ning the quarter-mile in last year's
