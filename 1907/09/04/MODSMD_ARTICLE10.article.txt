The Executive Committee faced a \
difficult problem in deciding upon
.
both a just and constitutional meth- j
od of filling the office of Graduate
Manager. The constitution of the 1
Associated Students gives power to I
this governing body to appoint Sales' 1
successor in a closed session, but the 1
responsibility of such an action the j
committee very naturally did not wish
to assume. On the other hand had a
general election been declared the
Class of 1911, having paid their Stu
dent Body assessment, could not le
gally have been debarred from the
!
polls. As it is manifestly impossible
that Freshmen who have been regis- 1
tered but a week, should know any
thing concerning the qualifications of 1
the respective candidates, the Com- j
mittee was forced to find a middle
course which would contain all the 1
merits of an election by the three up
per classes and yet not be open to the '
charge of unconstitutionality. They !
appear to have solved the problem
admirably. The ballots cast next Fri
day will be indisputable evidence of
the will of all those entitled to an
opinion and the formal appointment j
later by the Executive Committee will j
put the seal of constitutionality upon ,
their choice.
