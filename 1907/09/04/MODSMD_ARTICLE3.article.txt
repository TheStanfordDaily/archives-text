## Fairbanks Addresses Students At Assembly. 
### 
Vice-President Charles W. Fair
hanks, who is making a brief tour of
the Coast, in view of securing the
Republican nomination for the Presi
dency, was the principal speaker at
the first Student Body Assembly at
the last hour this morning. The dis
tinguished visitor from Indiana was
accompanied by the members of his
party, Governor Gillett of this State,
and United States Senator Flint.
The Assembly Hall was taxed to
it limit by the full attendance, many
visitors from Palo Alto and nearby
points gathering to hear the speaker
of the day. President David Stan-
Jordan made the opening address and
in turn introduced Governor Gillett,
Senator Frank P. Flint, and Hon.
Charles W. Fairbanks.
Dr. Jordan in the course of his in
troductory remarks spoke of the old
friendship existing between himself
and the speaker of the day, of their
associations while in Indianapolis,
and introduced Fairbanks as "My
friend, Charles W. Fairbanks, Vice-
President of the United States."
In his address the Vice-President
eliminated the issue which has
brought him to the Coast and dealt
with topics which would tend to bet
ter the minds of university under
graduates. Aside from several devia
tions the speaker dealt with purely
ethical questions. In opening he paid
a glowing tribute to Dr. Jordan. He
said: "It gives me great pleasure to
visit this great University. There is
110 university in this entire country
which is better known as an educa
tional center. There are about you
the ruins of your buildings, evidences
of a calamity. The only evidence of
this great calamity, however, is in the
physical structures. I visited the Uni
versity once before when it rose in
stately majesty, a monument to the
founder and to the great work it is
doing. When I heard of the great
disaster my heart went out to this
University and to Dr. Jordan."
The speaker then told of the oppor
tunities open at present to the young
men of the age and stated he did not
believe the cry of certain pessimists
who claim the chances for young
men arc not as great as in the days of
our forefathers.
"We are a fortunate people. 1 see
the same promising young men wher
ever 1 go. There never was an hour
that the future opened more splen
did opportunities. There is an illim
itable field for youth."
On speaking of the great opportuni
ties offered by the University he cau
tioned the students to try and real
ize the good to be obtained from the
course offered here. "I like the dem
ocracy of the University," said Fair
banks, but hastened to add, "I am not
speaking of partisan politics. I like
Democrats but I don't like too many.
1 like the difference of honest minds.
I- would be unfortunate were we all
of the same mind. It is out of the

clash of opinion that we get the jew
el of knowledge" In conclusion Vice-
President Fairbanks spoke of char
acter and classed the possession of
character as the paramount ambition
of all right-minded individuals.
Governor Gillett, who was called
upon for a few remarks, spoke of the
future of the University and its pre
sent rank. "Stanford will always
hold a foremost position in the ranks
of the universities of the world. 1
am proud as Governor of the State
of the showing made by this institu
tion."
Senator Flint said: "For the past
few days I have been engaged in wel
coming our Vice-President through
out the. State and I know of no great
er pleasure than welcoming him here
at this University. 1 want him to
see that the work is going on despite
the damage wrought by the earth
quake. He will do much toward cor
recting the wrong impressions which
have been circulated throughout the
East."
In addition to Dr. Jordan, Vice-
President Fairbanks, Governor Gil
lett and United States Senator Flint,
Fairbanks was accompanied by State
Senator Frank Short, of Fresno, E.
H. Tryon, and W. J. Martin, as a
committee from the Union League
Club of San Francisco. The entire
party took lunch at the Phi Gamma

character as the paramount ambition
of all right-minded individuals.
Governor Gillett, who was called
upon for a few remarks, spoke of the
future of the University and its pre
sent rank. "Stanford will always
hold a foremost position in the ranks
of the universities of the world. 1
am proud as Governor of the State
of the showing made by this institu
tion."
Senator Flint said: "For the past
few days I have been engaged in wel
coming our Vice-President through
out the. State and I know of no great
er pleasure than welcoming him here
at this University. 1 want him to
see that the work is going on despite
the damage wrought by the earth
quake. He will do much toward cor
recting the wrong impressions which
have been circulated throughout the
East."
In addition to Dr. Jordan, Vice-
President Fairbanks, Governor Gil

Vice-President Charles W. Fair
hanks, who is making a brief tour of
the Coast, in view of securing the
Republican nomination for the Presi
dency, was the principal speaker at
the first Student Body Assembly at
the last hour this morning. The dis
tinguished visitor from Indiana was
accompanied by the members of his
party, Governor Gillett of this State,
and United States Senator Flint.
The Assembly Hall was taxed to
it limit by the full attendance, many
visitors from Palo Alto and nearby
points gathering to hear the speaker
of the day. President David Stan-
Jordan made the opening address and
in turn introduced Governor Gillett,
Senator Frank P. Flint, and Hon.
Charles W. Fairbanks.
Dr. Jordan in the course of his in
troductory remarks spoke of the old
friendship existing between himself
and the speaker of the day, of their
associations while in Indianapolis,
and introduced Fairbanks as "My
friend, Charles W. Fairbanks, Vice-
President of the United States."
In his address the Vice-President
eliminated the issue which has
brought him to the Coast and dealt
with topics which would tend to bet
ter the minds of university under
graduates. Aside from several devia
tions the speaker dealt with purely
ethical questions. In opening he paid
a glowing tribute to Dr. Jordan. He
said: "It gives me great pleasure to
visit this great University. There is
110 university in this entire country
which is better known as an educa
tional center. There are about you
the ruins of your buildings, evidences
of a calamity. The only evidence of
this great calamity, however, is in the
physical structures. I visited the Uni
versity once before when it rose in
stately majesty, a monument to the
founder and to the great work it is
doing. When I heard of the great
disaster my heart went out to this
University and to Dr. Jordan."
The speaker then told of the oppor
tunities open at present to the young
men of the age and stated he did not
believe the cry of certain pessimists
who claim the chances for young
men arc not as great as in the days of
our forefathers.
"We are a fortunate people. 1 see
the same promising young men wher
ever 1 go. There never was an hour
that the future opened more splen
did opportunities. There is an illim
itable field for youth."
On speaking of the great opportuni
ties offered by the University he cau
tioned the students to try and real
ize the good to be obtained from the
course offered here. "I like the dem
ocracy of the University," said Fair
banks, but hastened to add, "I am not
speaking of partisan politics. I like
Democrats but I don't like too many.
1 like the difference of honest minds.
I- would be unfortunate were we all
of the same mind. It is out of the

clash of opinion that we get the jew
el of knowledge" In conclusion Vice-
President Fairbanks spoke of char
acter and classed the possession of
character as the paramount ambition
of all right-minded individuals.
Governor Gillett, who was called
