# CREW TRIP POSSIBLE.
## VARSITY EIGHT INVITED TO ROW AT VENICE. Plans are Indefinite and Executive Committee Will Consider the Matter Tonight. 
### 
The Stanford crew is in receipt of
an invitation to compete in the annual
regatta held at Venice on Thanks
giving day. This regatta is a contest
betwen the same crews which the
Varsity met last year during its races
in the South and, as these clubs have
been training the year round, the trip
will probably not be taken unless a
strong eight can be sent.
At present the prospects for the
trip are poor. A coach must be se
cursed and the whereabouts of Mur
phy not definitely known. Besides
this mact, there would be a great deal
of work to do in the way of fall train
ing and those of the crew who will
be members of the football squad
would be unable to give up enough
time from their other work.
The matter will be taken up at the
meeting of the Executive Commit
tee this evening, and if the proposi
tion appears favorable, terms will be
proposed to the Southern oarsmen.
