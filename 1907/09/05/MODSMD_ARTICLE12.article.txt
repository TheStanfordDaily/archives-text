There is a vague rumor to the ef
fect that the Freshmen and Sopho
mores are planning to settle their
differences after the rally tomorrow
night. Such an idea should be aban
doned at once. Stanford's strongest
and oldest traditions bar men in train
ing from hazing of any kind, and
it is inconceivable that a fracas be
tween underclassmen tomorrow night
would not draw in their football men,
the brawn of both classes. Sopho
mores should know this, and Fresh
men be careful not to start their col
lege career by a move directly in the
wrong direction.
