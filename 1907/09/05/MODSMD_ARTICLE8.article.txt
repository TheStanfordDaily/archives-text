# TO HOLD FALL TRAINING
## TRACK ATHLETES WILL BE SIGNED AT RALLY. Cross Country Running Planned as Feature of the Practice.â€”Good Prospects for Season. 
### 
Fall training on the track will be
gin within the next ten days. Train
e- Moulton and Captain F. R. Lana
gan, '08, have already formed their
plans for the fall work and the track
season will he formally opened with
a big rally on Friday night, Septem
ber 13. At this rally both the trainer
and captain will address the track
men and probably several of the vet
erans of last year's winning team.
In speaking of the outlook for track
material this year and the general
plans for the fall training, "Dad"
j Moulton said: "We are going to be
gin our track work this fall just as
1 scon as possible and try to get a
large number of men out for work.
Of course football will be the impor
| taut sport this semester and a good
; many track men will be 011 the Rug-
Iby field. But I want every man who
ii not out for football to sign for
fall track work as I believe that last
spring our men were slow in round
ing into shape becaues of the lack
of. enough fall training.
"There will be two new features in
our fall training this year. Cross
country running will be one of the
most important factors in our work
and I believe that this sort of train
ing will prove a great help to the
distance runners. There has been a
| cup offered for the cross-country ev-
I cut and I hope to see a large num
ber of men out for this trophy. At
present we have not determined the
distance to be run but it will probab
ly be about three miles. Another
change in the method of fall train
ing will be the appointment of sev
eral old men to supervise the work
of the beginners in the various events.
Captain Lanagan will be in general
charge. There will probably be five
or six veterans directing the work
in their special events under the su
pervision of Lanagan. This plan will
tend to give each man more individ
ual attention and will also help the
trainer and captain to become ac
quainted with their new material."
Trainer Moulton stated that he had
not yet been able to size up the
Freshmen track material, but that
there were several well-known pre
paratory school athletes registered
and he expected to develop some
good men from the new class.
The track is in fine condition at
present, although a trifle hard. But
Moulton says that after the first rain
it will be in excellent condition and
he predicts that next spring it will
be one of the fastest cinder paths in
the country.
