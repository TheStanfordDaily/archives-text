# WILL INSTALL LIGHTS
## BOARD OF TRUSTEES MAKES APPROPRIATION. Series of Fifteen Are Lights Will Be Placed On University Avenue And Campus. 
### 
An adequate lighting system for
University avenue has been planned
by the authorities and orders for the
necessary materials for its installa
tion are now in the hands of the man
ufacturers. The specifications call for
a system of fifteen arc lights, eight
of these being on University avenue,
two on either side of the Oval, one
at the corner of the English build
ing, one at the Engineering corner
and one near Encina Gymnasium.
The system on the avenue will be
underground, ornamental iron poles
of the latest design being used to sup
uort the lamps. A liberal appropria
tion, to cover the cost of materials
and installation, has been made by
the Board of Trustees, the estimates
being furnished by Professor H. J.
Ryan, of the Electrical Engineering
department who will have supervis
ion of the work.
Owing to the time necessary for
the manufacture of special appliance
and its shipment from the East be
fore actual construction can begin,
the system will probably not be in
operation before the close of the
semester.
