The Daily Palo Alto is in receipt of
several communications bearing upon j
the common subject of Assemblies j
The concensus of opinion among the i
writers seems to be that in cheering |
speakers as "Francis Heney" and I
"Fairbanks" the audience has been |
guilty of a breach of courtesy. One ■
student further complains that the j
last Assembly was not closed in a j
proper manner, the singing of "Hail, j
Stanford, Hail," being followed by ,
several rounds of yells which out- J
raged our traditions and robbed the 1
occasion of its usual solemnity. There ■
.
ij foundation for these complaints, j
The good fellowship which exists |
throughout university life has made i
us careless of the conventions, and 1
heedless of the courtesy which people
o. the world are accustomed to re- j
ceive. If we treat our speakers with 1
a greater respect, we shall not only |
be able to secure more of them, but 1
they will receive a better impression j
of Stanford men and women. In re- 1
gard to the singing of the college j
anthem there is no place more fit
ting than tlie close. It is a grand I
song and its effect should not be mar- !
red by even the best of Stanford
yells.
