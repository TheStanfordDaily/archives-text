# SOPHOMORES WIN RUSH
## FRESHMEN ARE BEATEN IN ROPE-TYING CONTEST. Many Spectators Witness Battle for Supremacy.â€”Final Score Stands 108 to 87. 
### 
The Sophomores won a decisive vic
tory over the Freshmen in the initial
rope-tying contest held 011 the base
ball diamond Saturday afternoon. Af
ter a struggle of thirty minutes, dur
ing which the fighting was fast and in
teresting, the 1910 forces succeeded
iii making prisoners of 108 Freshmen,
while the 1911 "morgue" held 87 Soph
omores.
The rush was interesting to both
the participants and the spectators
who filled the bleachers of the base
ball field. The contest started with
the crack of Referee Presley's
promptly at 2:30. The Freshmen were
lined up behind the third base line
facing the Sophomores who were ar
rayed in fours at the south of the
infield.
Following the signal for the combat,
both sides hesitated an instant and
then met in the center of the en
closure. General and individual fight
ing began throughout the field. Break
ing into small groups the opposing
forces commenced the task of bind
ing their opponents. The work of ty
ing was at first made difficult by the
rescuing parties of both sides but as
the affray progressed the combatants
confined themselves to securing pris
oners as fast as possible.
Due to the scarcity of bandages the
prisoners were unbandaged as soon
as they were placed in the respective
"morgues." This fact enabled a num
ber of the prisoners to escape from
their captors and to renew the fight.
The upperclass officials, however, took
account of this fact in reckoning the
final score, which was agreed upon
as 108 to 87.
