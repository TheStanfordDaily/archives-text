Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The editorial in the Daily Palo Al
to Friday evening, September 6, seems
to call for a few words of explanation.
The statement was made that Stan
ford tradition had been "outraged"
I by the following of "Hail, Stanford,
{ Hail," with a few yells. The person
j from whom this criticism came must
j be a humorist or else has not attend
j ed the assemblies and rallies for the
past few years. The weight of tradi
tion is on the other side for it always
has been the custom to close such
meetings with a few rousing yells.
It is difficult to see how a Stanford
yell should imply disrespect or lack
of reverence for the Stanford hymn.
The assemblies are not prayer meet
ings and the Stanford hymn is not
the doxology.
There has been but one assemby in
the last four years where it would
have been improper or in poor taste
t > close with yells and that instance
was on the occasion of Robert E.
Speer's address last year, and at that
time no yells were given.
One of the objects of the assem
blies is to give the students a chance
to "jolly up' and nothing will cause
them to go away with a better spirit
of good fellowship than to close the
meetings with a good Stanford yell.
Further complaint was made about
our lack of respect for the speakers.
We cheered for "Fairbanks' and did
not give his title. In the first place
it is impossible to prefix a long title
to a man's name and keep together so
that it sounds like anything more than
;i jumble of words. And furthermore,
it scarcely seems necessary to label a
noted man as though be" were a speci
men in a zoological museum.
I brought this matter up last year
with the men who have charge of the
â–  semblies, and they declared emphat
ically that no title was necessary in
cheering a man. It is more spontan
eous and a great deal more genuine
to cheer for the man rather than for
his office or title.
If a few of the students who have
taken it upon themselves to mould the
spirit and traditions of the Univer
sity would spend their time yelling
with the rest instead of planning
criticisms there would be a notice
able difference in the volume. A fav
orable criticism of anything around

the University to take the place, oc
casionally, of the customary phillipics
would lok remarkable in print
and might perchance be equally ef
fectual.
