# SPEAKS OF THE FAR NORTH.
## 
### 
The Reverend Hudson Stuck, Arch
deacon of the Yukon, was special
preacher at the Chapel yesterday
morning, and gave an interesting and
highly instructive talk on his work
among the aborigines of the far north,
that it was an encouraging position
the extreme cold, even by that hardy
race, and told of the great need of
hospitals. This last he particularly
impressed upon his auditors. He said
that ia was an encouraging position
to work in, and that excellent work
was being done by the missionaries
there.
