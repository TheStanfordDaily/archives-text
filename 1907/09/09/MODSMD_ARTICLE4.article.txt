# Enthusiastic Rally In Encina Opens Season
## One Hundred and Sixty Men Sign Up For Rugby-Speeches by Lanagan, Presley, Koerner and Moulton.

"Fellows, this is one of the most important football seasons that
Stanford has ever had. It is not often that a team remains unde
feated for five consecutive years. Some of you, I'm afraid, have come
to look upon a football victory as a matter of course. No player
has ever taken this view, however, and, furthermore, every man that
has ever played on the team will tell you that he had to work mighty
hard for a victory, and usually a mighty small one at that. I believe
that the trip to Australia gave us the necessary knowledge of the
game to meet California on equal terms. Last year Taylor knew
much more than he could possibly impart to his men in a single sea
son, while we knew so little that we could easily teach it all to the
squad. This fall we would have been badly handicapped if we had
not gone to Australia. I think that three things go to make up a
team: spirit, condition and, lastly and of the least importance,
knowledge of the game. We have a fine field and as good a captain
as ever was elected. I know him well, and I can say that we have
not had a better man in the last ten years. You have a field coach
who gave you the first baseball victory in eight years. And most of
the credit for that victory belongs to George Presley. It is now up
to you. California has three weeks start on us. If everyone does as
he is toi- and does it with the right .spirit, you can't lose.. But if
you don't do that, you can't win. You have a big advantage in playing
on your own field. We defended it once to the tune of 12 to 5. Do
it again, and send those fellows back to where they came from with
another beating."
COACH LANAGAN.

The football season of 1907 was in
augurated Friday night at one of the
most enthusiastic rallies ever held at
Stanford. The Encina Club room was
packed to the doors, when, promptly
at 8 o'clock, Yell Leader Kellogg call
ed for an "L. S. J. U." to start the
evening. Speeches were made by the
coaches, captain and trainer, and at
the conclusion one hundred and sixty
two men signed up, promising to
keep strict training rules. Of this
number over seventy are eligible for
the Freshman fifteen. Never before
has there been so large a roll of can
didates. Although the number of new
men is not above the average, the
list of old men breaks all records.
Assistant Coach Presley was the
first speaker of the evening, and he
said: "The training rules will start
on Monday and will be the same as
heretofore. For the benefit of the
I'reshmen 1 will say that neither
smoking nor drinking is countenanced,
and no one is allowed to stay up lat
er than eleven o'clock. The senti
ment at Stanford is such that the
breaking of any of these rules will not
be tolerated, and it is never thought
necessary even to speak of them."
As Dr. Angell was unable to be pre
sent. Captain Koerner was the next
speaker. He said, in part: "Whether
or not the schedule of class games
will be carried out depends on the

, number of men who sign up. At
first the practice games will be be
■ tween fifteens chosen from the squad,
and later will come the games with
outside teams. Suits will be distrib
uted tomorrow morning and slips will
be handed around after the rally."
"Dad" Moulton said, in part: "1
have noticed that many new men don't
i turn out until their second year here.
That's a great mistake. Everyone
ought to do something and do it
right away. There is no such thing
as not making good. Get up and try.
The training rules are to be kept;
there is no monkey business about
that. When on the field pay attention
j to the coaches and don't be gazing
lat the grandstand. Play the game
you are taught, keep training rules,
and as many sign up as possible. That
reminds me," and "Dad" concluded
his remarks with the usual story.
Coach Lanagan was the final speak
jor and he made a strong appeal. At
' the conclusion of the rally twelve
I hundred sacks of Bull Durham were
■ distributed by the Chaparral Board.
