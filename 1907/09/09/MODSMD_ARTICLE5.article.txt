# INTERSCHOLASTIC PLANS
## SUGGESTIONS BY DR. ANGELL AND J.C. MACFARLAND. Board of Governors Will Make a Change in the System of Entertainment. 
### 
The Board of Governors of the
Stanford University Interscholastic
Athletic Association held its first
meeting of the year on Friday night.
J. C. Macfarland, '07, who was presi
dent of the board for the past two
years, submitted a letter reviewing
the work of the past year and suggest
ed two important reforms that will
be adopted next spring. The most
important change will be in regard to
the entertainment of the visiting ath
letes. It is planned to have some
system of drawing lots, in order that
there may be no question as to the
fairness of the assignments made to
the different fraternities, clubs, or in
dividuals.' This change is necessary
because of the trouble encountered
last year when more than one invi
tation was extended to the same ath
lete.
Last spring the officials had difficul
ty with the trainers who were on the
field and next year no trainer will
be allowed on the field.
Dr. Frank Angell, treasurer of the
association, submitted a report on the
finances and offered a suggestion as
to the disposal of the surplus, which
is now over $250.00. This report will
be sent out in a circular letter to the
schools in the association. The
board of governors decided to take
no action upon the expenditure of the
surplus until after the meet next year,
when the question will be discussed
with the representatives of the schools
participating in the meet.
J. C. Macfarland, '07, was given a
vote of thanks by the board for his
valuable work as president during the
first two years of the association.
President Macfarland's letter is as
fc llows:
"In reviewing the work of the sec
ond year of the existence of the Stan
ford University Interscholastic Ath
letic Association several changes re
commend themselves.
The first among these is the enter
tainment of the visiting athletes by
the fraternities and other organiza
tions of the University. Under the
present system of invitation and as
signment by the Entertainment Com
mittee various abuses have sprung up
which threaten the continued pros
perity of the association. The worst
o: these is that the annual meet is
beginning to be looked upon by the
fraternities as the greatest rushing in
stitution of the year. Several frater
nities invite the most prominent ath
letes to stay with them, with the idea
of making fraternity material rather
thrui athletes of them. With several
fraternities seeking the same group
of men petty jealousies spring up and
ill feeling results. The fraternities
who do not receive the men they wish
feel that they have been slighted and
that the Entertainment Committee
has not dealt fairly with them. The
result is that the men who are assign
eo them are entertained only half
heartedly and the entertainment of
the sought-after men is interfered
with by the other fraternities.
The Board of Governors feels that
the continuance of the present sys
tem will result in the annual meet be
coming a rushing festival rather than
a track meet and that the true pur
pose of the association will be lost.
They have therefore decided that the
men will be assigned by a system of
drawing by lot and the assignments
will be made by teams as nearly as
possible, and that the old system of
invitation will be done away with.
The abuses of the old system may
be further corrected by the conduct
of the invited athletes. Last year
many of the men failed to appear at
the places to which they were as
signed, other men consequently found
their assignments filled and great con
fusion resulted.
The Board must insist that for the
good of the Association the men must
in the future go where they are as
signed.
* Another abuse which must be cor
rected was the interference of train
er.' with officials and contestants.
Hereafter no trainers will be allowed
on the field.
Moping that the above suggestions
\\ill be accepted in the spirit in which
they are made and which tends to
the best interests of the Association
pntf the University, we are
Very truly.

By J. C. Macfarland. Trest.
