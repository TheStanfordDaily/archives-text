Both spectators and participants
agree in saying that the initial rope
tying contest was a decided success.
It furnished plenty of opportunity for
the underclassmen to meet in a hard,
fast struggle without any great dan
ger of injury. The upperclassmen
found it far different from the foot
hall rush of last year. It was inter
esting to watch and there were no dull
moments during the entire half hour
of the combat. We hope to see the
idea perpetuated. When arrange
ments are made for the next contest,
however, those in charge should profit
by the experience gained this year
and find some secure place in which
to confine the tied contestants. Both
Sophomores and Freshmen escaped
from their respective "morgues" Sat
urday and engaged in the tight when
they were supposed to be awaiting
the count of the officials.
