# RUGBY SEASON BEGINS
## HARD WORK CHARACTERIZES FIRST PRACTICE. Three Upperclasses Have Good Available Material.â€”Freshmen Still an Unknown Quantity. 
### 
The first Rugby practice of the
season was held last evening on the
supplementary gridiron south of Stan
ford field. Soon after 4:30 the entire
squad of over 150 men, headed by
Coach Presley, trotted out 011 the
field and started punting and kicking.
Coach Lanagan appeared a little lat
er and kept the men at work for near
ly two hours. For the first practice
of the season it was very hard and
snappy.
It was impossible to get any line
on the Freshmen, but the old men
handled themselves exceptionally well.
As only three of the 1911 squad know
anything about Rugby, practically all
of the entering classmen will have to
be taught the rudiments of the game
before any teams can be chosen from
them. Tlie Freshmen showed good
spirit, however, and the coaches are
confident that the class contains plen
ty of available material.
After going through the setting-up
exercises, the squad was divided aC
| cording to classes, Lanagan taking
: charge of the Seniors, Koerner the
Juniors, Fenton, the Sophomores, and
Presley the Freshmen. Passing rushes
and dribbling were practiced. Later
fifteens were picked from the tliree
upper classes, and each team carried
the ball down the field several times
by dribbling and passing rushes.
After the rest of the squad had been
dismissed* the coaches devoted about
thirty minutes to the Freshmen, in
structing them in the rudimentary
points of the game.
011 the whole, the afternoon's prac
tice was very encouraging. --The Sen
iors showed up surprisingly well, es
pecially in the hack field. Neither
11. L. Horton, '08, nor J. R. Pember
ton, '08, have returned to college as
yet. and at present it is doubtful if
the former is coming back at all this
semester.
