In another column of tonight's is
sue of the Daily Palo Alto will be
found an anouncement of the subject
for the next Bonnheim Dissertation.
This annual award for the best papers
and the clearest discussion of the eth
ical side of the great questions of
the day was inaugurated by Mr. Bonn
heim two years ago and up to the
present time has elicited but a feeble
response from Stanford students. Ten
papers were handed in at the close
of the last competition, and two years
ago but half that number were writ
ten. It is hard to understand this
lack of interest. Mr. Bonnheim's
award is liberal in the extreme and
the submitting of a paper, even though
it brings no pecuniary reward, can
not fail to leave the student with a
comprehensive knowledge of the
question he has been studying.
