Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Last spring, after the bad weather I
was a thing of the past, a committee j
was appointed in the President's Con
ference which was to look after some j
sort of suitable crossings between the j
Bookstore and the Engineering build- I
ing and between the Inn and the
j Quad. The few hours of rain which
we had the other day ought, it seem
to me, to serve as a gentle reminder
to that committee that it only takes
.i very little rain to put the crossing
i'i a deplorable condition. Ry taking
the matter in hand now there would
be much discomfort saved when the
rr.iny season sets in.
