# SHEIBLEY WILL LEAD BAND
## Rigid System of Tryouts to be Inaugurated. â€”Bleacher Practice Every Week. 
### 
At a recent business meeting of the
University Band, E. G. Sheibley, '08,
was elected leader and H. J. Ivees
ling, '08, manager of that organiza
tion for the ensuing year. Ten mem
bers of the Freshman Class have sig
nfied their intention of trying for
places on the band this year. A rig
id system of tryouts will be instituted
and the membership limited. Mana
ger Keesling expects to introduce
several (innovations during the course
of the semester.
The band will have one football
practice a week on the bleachers in
order to work in harmony with the
rooters. Band arrangements of Stan
ford tunes, in eluding "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," have been ordered from the
East. A combined concert with the
Orchestra, of which Sheibley is also
leader, will probably be given some
time this semester.
