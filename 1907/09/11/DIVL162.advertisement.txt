C. E. Haskell & Company
Men's Furnishings
We do not claim to sell all the goods in town; that the qualities are
gifted with eternal endurance; that the styles are graced with divine
touch; that the bargains will occasion pleasant dreams and never be
forgotten. But we do hold that we offer you splendid goods—the best
and most stylish merchandise that can be purchased—reasonably
priced, and all "specials" are honestly reduced. We don't try to shove
anything off on you. We aim to give you full money's worth —and a
little more —when "specials" are advertised.
People tell us it is quite a triumph for any one store to gather in
one collection such a complete line of Men's Furnishings.
We desire to call your attention to our line of Golf Jackets for Ladies and
Men—colors Cardinal, Grey, White; also a variety of Fancy Trimmed. They
come with and without pockets. Sizes $4 to 46 inclusive. Prices $3 to $7.
Just Received

that has made our Shirt business famous as the best Shirt Store in town.
