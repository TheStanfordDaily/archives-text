The activity displayed by the Mu- j
sical Clubs. in their- plans for the j
coming semester are heartily to be j
commended. In the past these organ
izations have been severely criti
cized for their attitude toward the
Student Body and the infrequence
with which they have lent their aid
to Assemblies and other student gath
erings. The series of extra practices
called by the Glee Club this week
in preparation for the Assembly to
morrow, and the professed intention
of the clubs to be present at all the
gatherings this year are indications of
a change of policy which should en
dure. Bleacher practice by the Band
and Glee Club is another innovation
which will meet with the appreciation
of Stanford students and do much to
ward establishing a better understand
ing and a more friendly co-operation
between these organizations and the
undergraduates.
