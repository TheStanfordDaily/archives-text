# St. Marys May Play Rugby.
## 
### 
Plans are being formulated for the
introduction of Rugby as a sport at
St. Marys College and it is probable
that the Catholic school will turn out
a team this year. Joseph, who has
managed the baseball teams for St.
Marys for some years, is in favor of
the idea and is doing all in his power
to further the aims of the students
who are behind the movement.
The matter will be taken up at
a student meeting this week and if a
Rugby team is formed, there will be
an attempt made to get games with
the California and Stanford Freshmen.

styles in Hats, Haberdashery, etc.
Pennants carried in stock, and made
to order.
