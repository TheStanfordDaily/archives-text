# SECOND RUGBY PRACTICE
## LAST NIGHT'S WORK FAST AND SPIRITED. Freshmen Drilled in Fundamentals.â€” J.R. Pemberton, '08, Returns To College. 
### 
Rugby practice continued last ev
ening and was characterized by un
usual speed considering the early sea
son. The backs of all three upper
class teams worked well together in
the passing rushes. 1908 still appears
to have the surest backfield, although
the Juniors and Sophomores showed
improvements over the first practice.
The dribbling of the forwards in the
loose is as yet not what it should be.
The scrum men seem to have a
little difficulty in following directly
behind the ball in the loose rushes.
But on the whole, the practice was
encouraging. The spirit was fine, and
everyone seemed to be doing his best.
The squad was divided into four
sections, the upperclassmen forming
one and the Freshmen comprising the
other three. The afternoon was spent
in kicking and catching, picking up
the ball, dribbling and passing rushes.
Most of the time of the 1911 men
was devoted to dribbling. The Fresh
men seem to be getting 011 as well
as can be expected. They appear an
extremely strong squad and their fif
teen will surely be a comparatively
heavy one.
J. R. Pemberton, 'oS, arrived on the
Campus this morning and will prob
ably appear on the field at once. Sev
eral new candidates signed up yester
day.
