# LETTER OF THANKS SENT
## WORK OF WASHINGTON MEN IS RECOGNIZED. Appreciation For the Recovery of Bodies of the Two Stanford Men Drowned Last Summer. 
### 
On the day the Stanford crew ar
rived at Washington University last
May, two Stanford men, G. S. Jac
queth, '10, and J. F. Goshorn, '08,
were drowned while canoeing with a
young lady on Lake Washington. The
student body and Faculty of Wash
ington University immediately took
steps to recover the bodies. The
lake was dragged with the result
that the body of the young lady was
recovered. But it required five days
of constant dragging to recover the
bodies of the two Stanford men. Dur
ing one day of examination week
University work was suspended to al
low all the students to take part in
the search for the bodies of the un
fortunate Stanford men. In addition
to this heroic work, the Stanford crew
was elaborately entertained, and as a
token of appreciation the Executive
Committee has sent the following let
ter to the University of Washington:
Stanford University, Sept. 10, 1907.
Dr. Thomas F. Lane,
University of Washington,
Dear Sir:
The Student Body of Stanford Uni
versity wishes to express through you
to the student body of the Univer
sity its deep felt gratitude for the
self-sacrificing labors of the Washing
ton men in recovering the bodies of
Glen Jacqueth and Joseph F. Gos
horn, two loyal Stanford men, who
met an untimely death in Lake Wash
ington, May last. It seldom becomes
the necessity of one University to
render such assistance to a sister in
stitution, and voluntary assumption
of these labors is indeed appreciated.
This kindly act cannot fail to bring
about a closer friendship between
the Universities, and make us look
forward to nearer relations in the fu
ture.
Very sincerely yours,
The Student Body of Stanford Uni
versity,
Per A. A. Murphy, President,
C. L. Severy, Secretary.
