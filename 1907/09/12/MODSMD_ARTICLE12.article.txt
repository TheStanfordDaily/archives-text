### 
Spirit and willingness marked the
Rugby practice again yesterday af
ternoon. The work differed little
from that of the first two days, but
everyone seemed to be gradually get
ting a clearer idea of the game as
a whole. Coach Lanagan was again
on the field, taking charge of the
Sophomores and a picked Freshmen
fifteen. Captain Koerner and Fenton
looked after the rest of the 1911 can
didates, while Coach Presley supervis
ed the work of the upperclassmen.
The first Freshman team to be
chosen this season showed up sur
prisingly well. The dribbling and
passing of the new men was fine,
easily excelling the work of the sec
ond 1910 fifteen. As the limited time
for observation hindered the coaches
in their selection, the personnel of the j
Freshman line-up will be changed
from day to day.
All the squads were taught in de
tail the formation of the scrum, while
the Juniors and Seniors were drilled
in line-outs also. Except for these
two variations yesterday's practice
did not differ from the work of the
first two afternoons. There was the
usual passing and dribbling, the lat
ter claiming the most attention.
At present the tooB back-field is
the surest, while the Juniors have a
clear advantage in the scrum. The
Sophomores, however, appear to have
the best balanced fifteen.
There will be no game on Saturday,
but practice will be held at 3:30. J.
R. Pemberton, '08, appeared on the
field tonight.
