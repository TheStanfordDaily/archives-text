## Stanford's President Tells of Trip to Antipodes--Murphy Makes Plea For Student Loyalty. 
### 
An interesting and instructive lec
ture upon Australia by President Da
vid Starr Jordan with a few remarks
for the special benefit of the Fresh
men and upperclass students, a bril
liant and stirring address by Student
Body President A. A. Murphy, '08,
and excellent performances by the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs made the
second Assembly of the semester held
this morning one of the most success
ful gatherings held in some time.
Commencing with remarks to the
first year students, Dr. Jordan dwelt
upon instructive topics at some length
and then devoted the remainder of
his talk to the observations of his
trip to Australia and other important
places of interest in the Antipodes.
In speaking to the Freshmen he said
in part:
"I want to say a few words to the
Freshmen and then will tell you of
Australia. First, we want to make
real men and women of you of the
Freshman Class. We can't make any
ot them men and women. They must
make themselves, but we can help
them. They can use us all they can.
Then if we find we can not make real
men and women of you, we will turn
you over to the Faculty committee on
delinquent scholarship and they will
gently take you to the edge of the
Campus and drop you over. You will
be obliged to remain away and ma
ture for six months
"At Stanford we come from all
parts of the country. We arc all
alike when it comes to being Stan
ford men and women. We are not
alike as at Yale where every man at
tempts to be as near like his fellow
classmates and to do so go about
with an eye tooth missing or have a
bull dog or some other thing to make
them appear similar. Here you may
recognize men by their class spirit
or perhaps tell them by their adopt
ed hats, but not by missing eye teeth
and such similarities.
"While here do your work when it
is due. Don't do as some do, and do
it when there is nothing else to do.
I: is well for students to learn to
value their time or they will spend it
somewhere else in all probability.
Don't believe manliness comes from
doing anything you would be ashamed
to tell or have your parents or pro
fessors hear of. Know your profes
sors. At the head of each depart
ment you will find one placed there
for your especial benefit. A man pick
ed because of his success in just the
line in which you intend to make your
life work. Get interested in some
thing and then keep interested in ev
erything else.'
Dr. Jordan then told of his trip to
Australia. "As Robert Louis Steven-

Can we maintain the high
standard set by our last year's
teams? If we expect coaching
alone to winâ€”clearly not. Stan
ford possesses the best coaches
to be obtained anywhere but
their work must necessarily be
ineffectual unless the Stanford
men are willing, faithful work
ers. There devolves on each
Stanford man and woman a du
ty which cannot be shirked
without loss of University pres
tige

son used to say of his home,'lt is the
first place after leaving San Francis
co,' so is the University of Sydney the
first university to the right. During
my trip this summer I became a mis
sionary preaching on all American
universities at the universities of
Australia. The people of Australia are
very much the same as the people
of this country. They differ only he
cause they have had different exper
iences.
"The principal universities of Aus
tralia are the universities at Mel
bourne, Sydney and Adelaide. They
are all city universities and univer
sity buildings are upon the city
streets. There is very little of col
lege life as we have it here."
To illustrate the noisy character
of the undergraduates at the univer
sities of Australia and New Zealand,
Dr. Jordan read an extract from the
proceedings at the commencement of
one of the institutions. Hurrahs and
loud calls according to the speaker
were more in order than remarks
from the learned speakers at the col
lege exercises.
The extreme rivalry of Melbourne,
the "American city" and Sydney, the
"English city' of Australia was told
by President Jordan. The character
istics of the continent of Australia
were also expounded and industries
