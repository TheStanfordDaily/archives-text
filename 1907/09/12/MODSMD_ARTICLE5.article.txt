# Stunt Artists Needed By Glee Club.
## 
### 
The lack of "stunt' men is seriously
felt by the Glee Club. The success of
the trip South as well as the minstrel
show at the end of the month will
both depend to a certain extent upon
the cleverness of the men chosen.
As the plans for the minstrel show
are already well under way, J. J. Hill,
'08, is anxious to obtain the names of
any men who have talent in that di
rection. It is not probable that R. S.
Kellogg, 07, and F. H. Rernard, '07,
will appear together this year as
"stunt men" for the club.
