It is safe to say that no Stanford !
student reads of the magnificent ser- j
vice rendered us by Washington fac- j
ulty and students without an under
standing of the debt of gratitude :
which we owe that northern univer- j
sity. Individually and collectively, j
Stanford men and women appreciate (
and return thanks for the unselfish j
way in which work and pleasure were j
laid aside to perform a task which !
belonged to us but which we were un- j
able to undertake. The self-sacrifice j
of Washington men will be remem- \
bered after the passing of the present j
generation and will do much toward j
making Washington and Stanford sis- :
ter universities in fact as well as in j
name.
