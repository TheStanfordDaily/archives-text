Men s Furnishings
♦ We do not claim to sell all the goods in town; that the qualities are
♦
112 gifted with eternal endurance; that the styles are graced with divine
♦ touch; that the bargains will occasion pleasant dreams and never be
; forgotten. But we do hold that we offer you splendid goods —the best
t and most stylish merchandise that can be purchased—reasonably
t priced, and all "specials' me honestly reduced. We don't try to shove
I anything off on you. We aim to give you full money's worth —and a
I little more —when "specials" are advertised.
t People tell us it is quite a triumph for any one store to gather in
j one collection such a complete line of Men's Furnishings.
I We desire to call your attention to our line of Golf Jackets for Ladies and
♦ Men—colors Cardinal, Grey, White; also a variety of Fancy Trimmed. They
i come with and without pockets. Sizes to 46 inclusive. Prices $3 to $7.
♦ Just Received
I Three cases of the lastest novelties in Shirts. Every one of the Character
I that has made our Shirt business famous as the best Shirt Store in town.
