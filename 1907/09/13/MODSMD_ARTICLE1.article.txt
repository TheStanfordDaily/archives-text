# PLANS FOR CONFERENCE
## ORGANIZATIONS WILL ELECT REPRESENTATIVES. Plan To Select Executive Committee For Transaction of Ordinary Business. 
### 
Invitations were sent out from the
President's office this afternoon to all
the organizations which were mem
bers of the President's Conference
last semester to elect their represen
tatives at their earliest convenience.
Dr. Jordan said yesterday:"I ex
pect to convene both the Conference
of Young Men and the Conference
of Young Women within a week or
two, when the representatives of the
various organizations will probably be
chosen.
"Last year the Men's Conference
consisted of nearly thirty members.
We found this number too large to
make much progress. I have been
considering the advisability of the for
mation of an executive committee.
If the members of the Conference ap
prove of this plan they may elect a
committee to meet regularly and con-
duct the business to come before the
organization.
"On extraordinary occasions we call
the whole conference to meet. Such
meetings will probably be twice a
year.
Last year the Young Women's Con
ference succeeded much better. There
were about a dozen members and the
result was that they became better
acquainted and could accomplish
much more."
The organizations which have been
invited to elect representatives are:
Each fraternity and sorority, (1), Eti
cina Club (3), Roble Club (2), So
cial Service Club (1 man, 1 woman),
and one representative from each of
the following: Quadrangle Club,
