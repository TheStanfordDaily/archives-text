# BERKELEY CREW AT WORK.
## Thirty-Six Men Have Signed For Fall Training and Are Working On Machines. 
### 
All the oarsmen at Berkeley who
are not working on the Rugby squad
have signed up for the boating prac
tice, and are working every day on
the rowing machines under the direc
tion of Coach Oarnett. They con
sider the prospect dubious, however,
for only three members of last year's
ciew will be able to hold an oar
this year. Captain Witter will be
back at stroke, but F. Ashley and
Ball are the only other veterans who
will be in the boat. The rest of the
crew will be picked from the thir
ty-six men who are in regular train
ing now, and others who will join
them at the end of the Rugby sea
son.
