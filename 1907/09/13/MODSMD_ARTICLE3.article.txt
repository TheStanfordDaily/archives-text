# Reno Trip For Picked Team From Rugby Squad
## Negotiations With University of Nevada Opened By Graduate Manager Knupp--All Campus Games On Stanford Field. 
### 
A picked squad of the Varsity Rug
by candidates will make the trip to
Reno during the present season to
meet the players of the University
of Nevada if the present plans of Stu
dent Body Manager G. Knupp, '07,
meet with success. Negotiations
have been opened with the Reno men
for a game Saturday, October 19,
and if the expenses of the Stanford
squad are met by Nevada the game
will be held upon that date.
The proposed game will come one
week before the match already sche
duled with Nevada upon this Campus
and should insure a better game here
than under the first arrangement. The
trip meets with the approval of both
coaches and Trainer Moulton as it
has been the policy of the condition
ers of the Varsity to break the mon
otony of the training season by some
off-campus game. Last year the Var
sity men made a journey to Los An
geles to play Pomona and a similar
trip was scheduled for this year by
former Manager D. D. Sales, '06, but
due to the failure of the Southern
ccllegians to again take up Rugby,
all posibilities of a game were des
troyed. The date was thus left open
and since his election Knupp has been
ei deavoring to conclude negotiations
with Nevada.
In case the Nevada trip is not tak
en it is possible a game in addition
to the two already scheduled with
the Barbarian aggregation of San
F: ancisco will be held here. The Ne

vada players up to the present time
have not answered the proposition
broached by Manager Knupp but in
view of the fact that they will ap
pear upon this Campus one week later
as the guests of Stanford it is not
believed that any difficulty will be
encountered in the plans.
It is the intention of the coaches
to take fifteen candidates including
the old Varsity men together with
five or six of the most promising
second team men upon the trip. Both
Coaches J. F. Lanagan and G. P.
Presley as well as Trainer "Dad"
Moulton will accompany the players.
Manager Knupp at present has the
revision of the new schedule of games
compiled by Sales under considera
tion with a view of adding more con
tests with the Barbarians of San
Tiancisco if possible. It is his • plan
t« play all of the interclass games in
one week. If this idea is carried out
the Barbariaus will meet the Varsity
Saturday, September 21, and the Mon
day afternoon following the Fresh
men and Sophomores will play the
first interclass game. Wednesday,
September 25, the Juniors and Sen
iors, and Saturday, September 28. the
Pnal game.
The first game and all games fol
lowing will be held upon Stanford
Field. The turf has reached suffi
cient maturity to permit of light
usage but continued practice there
will not be attempted for at least two
weeks more.
