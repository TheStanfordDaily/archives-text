## ANNOUNCE THE PROVISIONAL CLASS FIFTEENS. Lanagan Supervises Practice of Underclassmen. —1911 Has Promising Material. 
### 
Rugby practice yesterday afternoon
was uneventful. The regular routine
was indulged in by the entire squad,
and very satisfactory progress was
evident in the various fundamentals
of the game. The first selection of
provisional class teams was made, but
frequent changes will constantly oc
cur. Lanagan again took charge of
the Sopohmores and a picked squad
of Freshmen, and he devoted a good
part of the afternoon in instructing
them in the theory of getting the ball
out of the scrum and starting the
passing rushes. Later, when prac
ticing this, both of the underclass fif
teens carried the ball down the field
in splendid style. The showing of
the Freshmen was especially encour
aging because of the short time they
have been together, while the 1910
team has ten veterans of last year.
The Seniors and Juniors, under the
direction of Coach Presley, were put
through an hour and a half of hard,
fast work.
Practice tomorrow will commence
at 3:30, and there may possibly be a
short line-up. This has not yet been
decided, however.
