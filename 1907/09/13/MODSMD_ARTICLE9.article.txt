It can hardly be claimed that the j
f.rst President's Conference accom- j
plished great results. When that body
was created last year Stanford un
dergraduates hoped and believed that
some good would come of the open j
discussions between the President of i
the University and the representa- !
tive men of the Student Body. The !
Conference met regularly, engaged in j
1< ngthy discussions, and passed many :
resolutions, but the practical results I
of its deliberations have not yet be- i
T i
come apparent. In an attempt to j
make the body less cumbersome and j
unwieldy it is planned to have the i
representatives who compose the Con
ference this year elect an executive
committee to do the active work. A
small body should both deliberate
and act while a large one is still lis- j
t< ning to arguments. The new idea j
he Ids out the hope of securing some j
definite action and can scarcely fail j
to be an improvement over the farce |
to which we were treated last year.
