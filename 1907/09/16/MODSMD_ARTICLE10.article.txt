# Rev. D.C. Gardner Delivers Sermon.
## 
### 
"Have a purpose in life with some
definite end," was the keynote of Rev.
D. Charles Gardner's sermon in the
Chapel yesterday morning. He went
011 to speak of the different purposes
people have in life, some aiming to
gain wealth, this being a bad aim. Dr.
Gardner emphasized the point that
life should not be frittered away, and
that students come to the Universi
ty to broaden their education and not
to be leaders of society.
