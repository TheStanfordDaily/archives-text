# FIRST YEAR TEAMS TO GO
## BERKELEY WANTS FRESHMAN RUGBY STOPPED. Movement Started to Bar Men From All Athletics in First Semester. 
### 
The movement at Berkeley to
abolish the rule which bars Freshmen
from all varsity teams is rapidly
gaining ground. Undergraduate opin
ion is practically unanimous on the
subject, and the faculty has agreed to
consider the matter next week. Ber
keley men are determined that their
Freshmen shall have the same rights
as those of Stanford.
Back of this, however, it is said
that the student body has determined
to place the Freshmen at both col
leges upon a new basis. Dr. Wheeler
has expressed his approval of the
plan to bar the Freshmen from foot
ball of any sort, thus doing away
with Freshman teams. The idea is
that during the first few months of
his college life the Freshman must
center all his attention upon his stu
dies. In the second semester he will
be well started, and can then parti
cipate in athletics. In his first sem
ester he will not be allowed any ath
letics at all. This provision will not
be put into effect at Berkeley unless
Stanford agrees to adopt it.
