# RUGBY TROPHY DONATED.
## Vancouver Man Gives Perpetual Cup For Rugby Union, Berkeley and Stanford Teams. 
### 
J. C. Keith, of Vancouver, has giv
Â«n to the Vancouver Rugby Union
a magnificent perpetual challenge cup,
to be competed for each year by the
winning team of the Union, and Stan
ford and California Universities
Vancouver expects to send a team
down here some time during the sea
son; but the donor of the cup desires
that the contest for it be held in Brit
ish Columbia. Both of the univer
sities would under this arrangement,
send teams up there, to play Van
couver, Victoria, or Nanaimo, which
make up the Rugby Union. The
rules to govern the contest have not
yet been drawn up, but a committee
for that purpose has been appointed
i'l Vancouver.
