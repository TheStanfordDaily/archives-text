## 
### 
Three concessions at the Palo Al
to street fair have been secured by
the Combined Musical Clubs. A vau
deville performance will be given in
place of a minstrel show under one
concession, a wheel of fortune and
some entertainment yet to be decided
upon under the other two. The Glee
and Mandolin Clubs will also appear
at an entertainment to be given at
the Skating Rink the Friday evening
of the Carnival.
