# Eighty-five Track Men Sign For Fall Training
## Season Is Opened By Rally In Training House-University Will Give Credit For Cross-country Running. 
### 
The fall train
ing season for
track men was
opened with an
enthusiastic rally
at the training
house on Friday
night. Trainer
Moulton and
Captain Lanagan
spoke to the men
in regard to the
necessity of do
ing fall track
work and several
of the veterans of
last year's team
made a few re
marks about the
prospects in
track this year.
There was a
large attendance
at the rally and
eighty-five men
signed for work,
although there
will probably be
many more out
when it is learned

that the men tak
ing gymnasium

work may substitute cross coun
try running. This concession lias
been granted through the efforts of
E. J. Nash, '07, varsity two-miler, who
will have charge of the cross country
runners. Nash will keep track of
their work and no man will get credit
who does not do the required amount
of running. Both Moulton and Lana
gan believe that this chance at sub
stitution will bring out a great many
men who might not otherwise try
distance running, and they expect to
develop some new Varsity distance
men. Some of the men were out on
ttack Saturday morning and this af
ternoon regular work will begin. Both
Trainer Moulton and Captain Lana
gan will be at the track this after
noon.
Track Captain F. R. Lanagan was
the first speaker at the rally Friday
night, and he said: "Probably the
most important reason for holding
this rally is that we want to know
whe the track men are and get you
together so that you will know each
other. Track is more individual work
than any other branch of athletics
but I believe the men should know
each other and get together as much
as possible. We need team work.
When you sign up for fall training
ir does not mean that you have to
get into fine shape, but make your
work this fall a basis to begin on
when the important work opens next
spring. Don't go out and try to do
your event the first day, take your
work gradually and just do enough
to keep in good physical condition

so that you will be ready to begin
liard training next January. We have
only lost a few of our last year's team
but you may be sure that it is a migh
ty hard proposition to beat California.
And we want all the men out for fall
work who can possibly come. You
do not have to come out every day
in the week, but come out two or
three times anyway. We will work
on Saturday mornings at 10:30 and
"Dad" will be out 011 the track every
afternoon at 4:30.
"Dad" Moulton followed Captain
Lanagan with a short speech in
which he said: "You fellows may
think that this is not as big a rally
as you expected, but just now foot
ball i- the most important sport; but
after tlie holidays we will have a big
meeting and start the spring season
with plenty of enthusiasm. But we
want you to sign up now and come
out for work. It don't make any
difference if you liave never done any
thing 011 the track. Come out and try.
And if you didn't make good in a cer
tain event last year, come out again
and we will try you in some other. We
will shift you around until we find the
event you arc fitted for. We have to
win from California and we have to
win 011 the square. Tf we can't win
that way we don't want to win at all.
And they have some good new men
and we will have to fight together
and fight with spirit to win. Come
out as often as you can and work.
You don't have to keep training rules
but we want you out for work as


Captain F. R. Lanagan.
