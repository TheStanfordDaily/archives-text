# FIRST SCRIMMAGE WORK
## JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES ARE VICTORIOUS. Teams Play Fast Rugby For First Work.—More Interclass Games Next Saturday. 
### 
The first scrimmage work of the
season occured Saturday afternoon,
when the Seniors lined up against the
Juniors and the Sophomores opposed
the Freshmen. 1909 won 3-0, while
1910 was victorious by a score of 9-0.
Both games were very spirited and
although several changes took place
i.i the personnel of the various teams,
they worked well together. The in
dividual playing was also very en
couraging. Besides the veterans of
the 1906 team, who put up their
usual good game. Vandervoort, Ter
rill, Rogers, Reynolds, A. B. Cook,
Cline and Reed were the bright stars
oi the afternoon.
On the whole, the Juniors did the
best work of the afternoon and at
present it looks as if they will be
the team to win in the interclass ser
ies. Besides a heavy, aggressive set
01" forwards, strengthened by three of
last year's Varsity, they have a re
markably speedy back field which
gave a good account of itself, even
without Holman who was unable to
play Saturday 011 account of a slight
attack of la grippe from which he is
suffering. The dribbling of the Sen
iors was good, and their two front
rank men, Koerner and Rhyne, were
constantly in the midst of the play.
As for the underclass fifteens, the
work of their Jjacks was the most con
spicuous. The Sophomore forwards
were poor at getting the ball out of
the scrum, while the Freshmen were
naturally lacking in general knowl
edge of the game.
After half an hour of general prac
tice the Seniors lined up for the kick
off. For several minutes the play was
entirely in the center of the field, and
then 1908 dribbled to the 10-yard line,
where Goodell secured and found
touch. From the line-out in midfield
the ball was passed to Rogers, from
him to Heinley, and then to Terrill
who crossed the line for a try. Craw
ford failed to kick the goal. After that
play continued near the center of the
field until the second teams were sub
stituted for the fifst fifteens, and then
the Seniors in the loose carried the
pigskin to the 12-yard line, where the
Juniors secured and rushed the ball
down the field to their opponents' goal
line, where 1908 touched down. Fen
ton dropped out, and the game ended
soon after with the play in midfield.
The Sophomores then lined up
against the Freshmen. The ball was
forced into the latter's territory im
mediately after the kick-off, and 1911
was forced to touch down twice.
Fierce rushing followed, and Green
finally found touch at the Freshmen's
20-yard line. On the line-out the ball
went from Little to Mitchell to Green
who scored the first try. which Faulk
ner failed to convert into a goal. Af
ter the drop-out playing continued
near the center of the field. 1910
finally secured on the Freshman's
35-yard line, and rushed the ball
across the line by dribbling, Reynolds
making the try. The substitutes were
then pnt in, and the Sophomores man
aged to obtain another three points,
the final score being 9-0. The teams
lined up as follows:

Pemberton, Gay, Myers, forwards;

who scored the first try. which Faulk
ner failed to convert into a goal. Af
ter the drop-out playing continued
near the center of the field. 1910

The usual routine work was done
a, practice Friday evening. Begin
ning this afternoon the coaches will
not attempt to devote their time to
the entire squad and the work will
gradually become more and more spe
cialized.
At four o'clock next Saturday the
Seniors will play the Sophomores, and
an hour later the Juniors will line up
against the Freshmen.
The first scrimmage work of the
season occured Saturday afternoon,
when the Seniors lined up against the
Juniors and the Sophomores opposed
the Freshmen. 1909 won 3-0, while
1910 was victorious by a score of 9-0.
Both games were very spirited and
although several changes took place
i.i the personnel of the various teams,
they worked well together. The in
dividual playing was also very en
couraging. Besides the veterans of
the 1906 team, who put up their
usual good game. Vandervoort, Ter
rill, Rogers, Reynolds, A. B. Cook,
Cline and Reed were the bright stars
oi the afternoon.
On the whole, the Juniors did the
best work of the afternoon and at
present it looks as if they will be
the team to win in the interclass ser
ies. Besides a heavy, aggressive set
01" forwards, strengthened by three of
last year's Varsity, they have a re
markably speedy back field which
gave a good account of itself, even
without Holman who was unable to
play Saturday 011 account of a slight
attack of la grippe from which he is
suffering. The dribbling of the Sen
iors was good, and their two front
rank men, Koerner and Rhyne, were
constantly in the midst of the play.
As for the underclass fifteens, the
work of their Jjacks was the most con
spicuous. The Sophomore forwards
were poor at getting the ball out of
the scrum, while the Freshmen were
naturally lacking in general knowl
edge of the game.
After half an hour of general prac
tice the Seniors lined up for the kick
off. For several minutes the play was
entirely in the center of the field, and
then 1908 dribbled to the 10-yard line,
where Goodell secured and found
touch. From the line-out in midfield
the ball was passed to Rogers, from
him to Heinley, and then to Terrill
who crossed the line for a try. Craw
ford failed to kick the goal. After that
play continued near the center of the
field until the second teams were sub
stituted for the fifst fifteens, and then
the Seniors in the loose carried the
pigskin to the 12-yard line, where the
Juniors secured and rushed the ball
down the field to their opponents' goal
line, where 1908 touched down. Fen
ton dropped out, and the game ended
soon after with the play in midfield.
The Sophomores then lined up
against the Freshmen. The ball was
forced into the latter's territory im
mediately after the kick-off, and 1911
was forced to touch down twice.
Fierce rushing followed, and Green
finally found touch at the Freshmen's
20-yard line. On the line-out the ball
went from Little to Mitchell to Green
who scored the first try. which Faulk
ner failed to convert into a goal. Af
