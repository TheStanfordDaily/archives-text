The offer of a Rugby trophy to be
played for by the fifteens of Briti>h
Columbia and California will do
much for the new sport on the Paci
fic Coast. It is of special interest to
Stanford and Califronia in that it pro
vides a stimulus for their teams to go
North and meet the Canadians on
strange fields and under new condi
tions. The Northern trip taken by
the Stanford men last year, in addi
tion to giving the players a valua
ble insight into the new game, estab
lished athletic relations with the Van
couver and Victoria teams which
should be strengthened in every pos
sible way. It is to be hoped that
Stanford will see her way clear to
take advanta e of the opportunity of
fered by Mr. Keith's generosity and
make a second invasion of the North
at the close of the present season.
