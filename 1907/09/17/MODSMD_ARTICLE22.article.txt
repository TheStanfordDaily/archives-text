# BURBANK SENDS APPLES
## Presents Remarkable Collection of Seventy-Three Varieties to Bionomics Department. 
### 
Lutlier Burbank, the great experi
mental agriculturalist of Santa Rosa,
has sent a box of apples to Dr. Jor
an for use in the Bionomics depart
ment. There are seventy-three dif
ferent varieties in the box and they
were all grown upon the same tree.
Many of them arc of entirely new spe
cies, never propagated before.
The apples, with the methods em
ployed in crossing and grafting, ne
cessary to grow them, are being made
the subject of lectures in the Depart
ment of Bionomics. Burbank will
probably visit Stanford the latter part
of next month for the purpose of de
livering lectures on this and kindred
subjects.
