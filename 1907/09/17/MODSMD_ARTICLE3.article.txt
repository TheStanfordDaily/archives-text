# GOLF LINKS SOON OPEN
## COURSE RAPIDLY BEING PUT IN CONDITION. Club Will Have Many New Members, and is Prepared for an Active Year. 
### 
The links of the Stanford Golf Clulr
on Reservoir Field are rapidly being
put into condition for play, under the
supervision of T. B. Griffith, '09, a
member of the executive committee.
The course was neglected during the
summer vacation and lapsed into bad
shape, but the club is prepared to
rush the work on it, and hopes that
within a week it will be in shape for
play.
The course on Reservoir Field is
a fairly good one, and last year some
excellent playing was done there, but
the members feel that with the ex
perience gained they can construct a
much better one. It is probable that
no change will be made this year, but
the plans provide for a removal to
a more convenient location before
another year, if it is possible.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner is the pres
ident of the club, and is very sanguine
about its future. There are at least
twenty new men who will go into the
club as soon as the links are in shape,
and with the faculty and student
membership of last year, the club will
be financially able to keep up its
course.
