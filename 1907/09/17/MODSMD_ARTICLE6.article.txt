The rubbing list for the football
squad was started at the conclusion
of practice yesterday afternoon, when
thirteen men, including eight veter
ans of last year, were put on the orig

time to time. The names of the thir
teen are as follows: Koerner, Pem
berton. Gay, Vail, Vandervoort, Fen
ton, Minturn, Crawford, Thorpe
Heinley, Owen, Holman and Cook.
Yesterday saw another encourag
ing practice. The squad was divided
into two sections, Coach Lanagan
taking charge of the backs and
Coach Presley looking after the for
wards. Lanagan's men first went
through some passing rushes and then
the art of dodging was illustrated to
them. Next they practiced securing
and finding touch, and, lastly, the dif
ferent class teams were sent down the
field, dribbling and passing. Line-outs,
112( rming and screwing the scrum, get
ting the ball out to half, and dribbling
formed the work of the forwards dur
ing the afternoon.
As a result of the scrum's work
Saturday night, Terrill and Little
have joined Holman 011 the sick list.
Several other changes also occurred
i*T the line up of the class teams yes
terday, principally in the 1910 and
1911 fifteens.
A short scrum took place tonight,
and the teams will again face each
other 011 Thursday afternoon. The
dates for the regular interclass games
have not yet been definitely set, but
it is probable that they will begin the
first of next week.
