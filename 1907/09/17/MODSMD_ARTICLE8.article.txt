Senator B. F. Tillman of South
Carolina, whose fiery speeches in the
Senate upon the negro question in
the Southern States has made his
name well known throughout the
country, may speak in Assembly Hall
during the present week. The affair
however, will not he under the aus
pices of the Faculty Committee on
Assemblies, but more in the form of a
lecture. Senator Tillman is traveling
throughout the United States under
a contract with a lecture syndicate
and his speeches are all scheduled for
him.
The members of the Faculty Com
mittee on Public Exercises will place
the matter before the noted states
man upon his visit here, and should
the manager of the syndicate choose
to allow Senator Tillman to speak
here the lecture will be arranged in
accordance with the plan followed in
all outside talent affairs. Seats will
be sold and the address conducted
upon business-like lines. The Faculty
(I'j not wish to undertake the respon
sibility of making the syndicate any
offer outside of the proposition that
the syndicate rent Assembly Hall and
speculate upon the sale of seats.
It is expected the speaker will pay
the Campus a visit whether he is
scheduled for a public appearance or
not. He will arrive in San Francis
co tomorrow and the lecture will not
in any case be held until the latter
part of the week.
