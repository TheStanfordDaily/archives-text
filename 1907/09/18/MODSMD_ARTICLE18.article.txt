# TWO PRACTICE LINE-UPS
## SENIORS AND JUNIORS WIN FAST RUGBY GAME. Discouraging Showing of Freshmen. â€”Several Players Sustain Temporary Injuries. 
### 
Seniors, 3; Sophomores, 0. Juniors,
19; Freshmen, 0. These were the re
sults of the two games yesterday af
ternoon, and they well describe the
comparative merits of the contesting
teams. 1908 and 1910 were very ev
enly matched, and the, Seniors had
to put forth everything that was in
them to pull out a victory. They
scored their only try in the first few
minutes of play. After that the game
resolved itself into a hard, fierce fight,
neither side having an appreciable ad
vantage. With the Juniors and Fresh
men it was entirely different. 1909
easily excelled their opponents and
made two trys before the 1911 men
realized they were in the game.
As far as the three upperclasses are
concerned, the afternoon's work was
very encouraging. The playing of the
Juniors was easily superior to that of
the Seniors and Sophomores, hut the
last two fifteens may he relied upon to
give 19CO a close iight in the interclass
series. As for the Freshmen, they
did not seem to have the slightest
idea what to do. Pitted against the
strongest team 011 the field, they were
kept constantly on the defensive, and
were absolutely unable to make any
progress with the ball'themselves. An
even larger score was prevented by
the brilliant playing of Reed, the
wing three-quarter, whose individual
work was undoubtedly the best of the
day. Among the other fifteens, Koer
ner, E. Cole, Rogers. Cadwalader, and
Reynolds showed up well. The ten
dency to hold onto the ball instead of
passing it, was very noticeable in the
playing of some of the men new to
Rugby. Several injuries were incur
red. the most serious being that of
Wheeler, the 1911 half, who had three
teeth knocked out.
Except in one or two instances the
line-up of the teams was the same as
at the preceding practices. In both
games two halves of ten minutes each
were played, and in the middle of the
second period the substitutes were
sent on the field.
The only try of the Senior-Sopho
more contest was made soon after the
kick-off. From a line-out Cole got
the ball on the second-year men's 25-
yard line, carrying it to within a few
feet of the goal, where he passed to
Koerner, who scored. For the Jun
iors, Crawford, Rogers, Parma and
Owen, in a sixty-yard passing rush,
made the first try, while Rogers and
Swickard carried the ball across the
line for the next three points. Two
more tries were secured by Owen and
Rogers, and the substitutes brought
the total up to 19. Goodell kicked
two of the five goals.
