# BEST SEATS FOR ROOTERS
## UNDERGRADUATES TO HAVE CENTRAL SECTIONS. Graduate Managers Hold Conference and Fix Price of Tickets at Two Dollars. 
### 
The rooting sections of the inter
collegiate Rugby game with the Uni
versity of California will be at the
center of the field this year for the
first time within the last half decade
of Varsity contests. At a conference
held with O. E. Snedigar at Berkeley
! ve.-terday, Graduate Manager Knupp.
I '07, made the preliminary arrange
ments for the -;ile of seats for the
I big game.
It was decided to reserve seats to
the number of 1.000 each for both
rooting sections. Of the two center
sections upon either -ide, one divi
| sion and a part of the other will be
-et aside. The price of these seats
J which have former!} >old for $J..=io.
will be reduced to $2.00.
The old rooter seats, which were
| originally regular $_\oo seats to out
sider-., will be placed on sale at this
iigure. By thi- arrangement Malta
| gers Knupp and Snedigar expect to
meet the demand of the undergradu
ates of both universities who have
clamored for a better situation on the
! field. Tilis plan also provides for
the same net gate receipts to the
J student bodies but means an increa.se
jof 50 cents per .-eat to the rooter-
J No objection to this advance, howe\
er, is anticipated by the manager-.,
J in view of the far improved position
o> the students.
It has not a- yet been decided upon
which side the respective rooters will
sit. Seats for the big game will be
sold at the gate by California sellers,
while Stanford men will occupy like
positions at the Freshman game. Ar
rangements for special trains to the
Varsity game have not been complet
ed. but with the opening of the Bay
Shore Cnt-off, crowds will be han
dled at the big game with far greater
expediency than was the rase two
years ago.
The matter of a satisfactory ref
eree is a question which is at pres
ent giving both managers and
coaches considerable difficulty. Wil
liam Unmack, the Rugby player who
officiated at both contests last year,
will not be considered by the repre
sentatives of California under any
conditions. Manager Knupp has
had a new tackling dummy apparatus
installed upon Stanford Field and the
ccaches wil linstruct the candidates
for both teams in this phase of the
game. ,
