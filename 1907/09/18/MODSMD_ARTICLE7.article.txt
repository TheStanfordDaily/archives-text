### 
In response to the call of Captain
K. L. Kenton, 08, forty-tlirec men
handed in their name> this afternoon
for baseball practice. On Mondays,
Wednesday's and Fridays at 4:45
these men will appear on the varsity
diamond. The practice will he under
the direction of the old men, the
Freshmen being divided into squads
of several players each. Games will
hi arranged among the members Â«>f
the full squad and with the Faculty
team.
Practice will commence next Fri
day afternoon, and will he continued
along strict lines. Captain Fenton
impressed upon the men at the melt
ing that the decision of whether there
should he fall practice lay with them,
and when they signed up it was with
the understanding that they were to
come out regularly for practice. If
they do not do this, their absence
will he taken as a sign that they do
not wish to continue playing. A list
of the men signed up will be in
charge of the old men and a record
of attendance at practice will be kept.
All the members of last year's Var
sity who are eligible to play and who
are not busy with Rugby or other
matters in the afternoon, have signed
up. The veterans who are 011 the
Rugby field are Captain K. L. Kenton,
'oK. T. K. Cadwalader, '00, and C. C.
Owen, 00. G. L. Ooodell, 'oq, and
L. F. Smith, '00, who were on the
baseball squad last year, arc also play-

ing Rugby.
I'lie Varsity men who
will enter tlie fall prac
tice are: W. C. Theile.'oS,
J. 11. Bell, '08, C. E.
Sampson, '09, and L. S.
Scott, '10. 11. Dennis, '09,
and J. S. Woodbury, '09,
substitutes 011 the 1907
and 1906 nines, respect
ively, have also signed up
for the fall work.
Under the plan for fall
baseball, all the men who
are out for the sport
will lie given a chance in
the line'-ups of the several
teams which will be
formed. Probably the
system of organization
adopted will not include
a rating of teams as first,
second, or third, but the
better players will be
-c i tiered among the dif
ferent teams so that the
competition between the
nines will not be one-sid
ed.
Games will probably be
played every day. In
stead of going through a
great deal of technical

work, the men will spend most of
their time in actual play. The Fac
n!ty baseball nine is playing severaf
games a week at the present time and
ii is possible that the scene of part
o, tlie fall practice will be shifted
to the Faculty diamond.
