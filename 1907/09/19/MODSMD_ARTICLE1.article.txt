# TILLMAN CALLED AWAY
## SENATOR UNABLE TO GIVE LECTURE TONIGHT. South Carolinan Unexpectedly Forced To Fill an Engagement at Grass Valley. 
### 
Senator Benjamin F. Tillman, of
South Carolina, who expected to de
liver a lecture at Assembly Hall to
night on the relation of the race
problem to the country, has unavoid
ably been forced to cancel his engage
ment. The change necessary to his
plans was not known to the Senator
himself until a very late hour, but
this morning he sent a telegram to the
University authorities saying that Ik
had unexpectedly been obliged to
change his schedule and omit Stan
ford from his itinerary. It is learned
from outside sources that he has been
called to Grass Valley to deliver a
lecture which his contract with the
Lyceum Syndicate demanded. It is
not probable that he will be able to
take up the engagement here on his
return from Grass Valley, as his time
011 the Coast is very limited.
