# LIGHT RUGBY PRACTICE
## CHANGES IN LINE-UP OF THE CLASS TEAMS. Injuries Keep Several Players off the Field.—Games Today and Saturday. 
### 
Football practice yesterday was the
easiest that has been indulged in thus
far this season. As there was a line
-111 Tuesday and another one this af
ternoon, the coaches deemed it ad
visable to confine the squad to a lit
tle light work. The forwards went
through tlie usual routine of scrum
ming and dribbling, while passing
ri shes constituted the chief work of
the backs. Finally the men were
brought together and the class teams
were drilled in getting posession of
the ball after a line-out. The for
wards were then excused, and the
hacks spent the rest of the afternoon
kicking and catching. In response to
the coaches' call for place-kickers,
fourteen men volunteered, and prac
tice was begun at once.
Several more changes were made
yesterday in the personnel of the
class fifteens. On the Senior team
Vail and Baldwin succeeded Strong
and Newland. The Juniors back
field received a severe .shake-up.
Coorran was putin at first five-eighth.
Cadwalader taking center in place of
Rogers, who was shifted to wing.
Hotman was back in the game, hav
ing recovered from his illness. Jor
dan supplanted Drew at wing on the
Sophomore fifteen, while among the
Freshmen Easter succeeded Arnold
who, in turn, succeeded Vesel. Blood
and Nolan were substituted for Grin
ci: and Righter respectively, while
li. Brown was ousted by Woodville.
Another addition was made to the
sick list yesterday. Thorpe develop
ed ;in abcess in his ear, which will
keep him out of the game for some
time. Just how serious it is will not
be known for a few days. Little,
who tore a muscle in his knee last
Saturday, hopes to be able to don a
suit again in ten days or a fortnight.
Notwithstanding the injuries which
they received Tuesday, Miller, Ga
iii ii£ and Wheeler were all on the
field yesterday.
