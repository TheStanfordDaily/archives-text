The recent controversy at Califor
nia over the disbarment of freshmen
athletes has brought to light some
interesting statistics bearing upon this
question. The figures produced by
Professor Magee are strong evidence
that participation in intercollegiate
contests does not injure the univer
sity standing of first year students.
Probably this conclusion will not he
commonly accepted owing to the fact
that it is drawn from the records of
one university alone, but at the least
it is an able argument in favor of
athletics for all undergraduates. With
these figures to fall back on it is
not remarkable that the demands of
the California students were granted
by the faculty of that institution. The
decision which permits the Blue and
Gold teams to be representative of
their entire student body instead of
the three upper classes can occasion
us nothing but satisfaction here. It
removes an uncomfortable feeling of
fighting with a handicap and it
makes impossible a repetition of those
arguments and explanations which
were so prevalent at the close of the
hist athletic season.
