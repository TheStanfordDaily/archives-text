A small brush lire, starting from
some unknown cause, brought the
University Fire Department, support
ed by a large number of students, to
the vacant field adjoining the north
end of Roble Hall this afternoon.
The blaze was quickly extinguished
and at no time threatened I niversi
ty property, although before the ar
rival of the student fire brigade, it
a| proached very close to Roble Gym
nasium.
