# RUGBY GAMES TOMORROW
## FOUR CLASSES TO COMPETE ON STANFORD FIELD. Seniors Will Meet Sophomores and 1909 Will Face 1911.â€”Freshman Eligible Lists. 
### 
Stanford Field will be played on
tomorrow afternoon for the first time
this semester. At four o'clock the
Seniors will line up against the Soph
omores, and at the conclusion of this
game the Juniors and Freshmen will
face each other. Neither of these
scrums will count in the regular in
terclass series which will not begin
until some time next week.
Although 1909 will probably not ex
perience much difficulty in disposing
o the Freshmen, the contest between
the 1908 and 1910 fifteens should be
close and interesting. At their first
line-up the Seniors were victorious by
a score of 3-0. A charge of twenty
five cents will admit to both games.
Forty-one first-year men are eligi
ble to compete in the Intercollegiate
