# LATHROP MAKES STATEMENT.
## Treasurer Says Grass Fire Was Not Started By University Workmen, As Reported. 
### 
Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop is
considerably annoyed over the re
ports sent out concerning the grass
fire, which threatened the Roble Gym
nasium yesterday afternoon, but was
promptly extinguished by the Campus
fire department. It appears that ac
cording to the report complained of
the fire was started by an employe of
the University. This is the state
ment to which Treasurer Lathrop
takes exception, and lie has requested
that the Daily Palo Alto refute this
report. The Treasurer states that the
fire was started by a workman who
is in the employment of President
Jordan as a personal servant, and
who has nothing whatever to do with
the University.
