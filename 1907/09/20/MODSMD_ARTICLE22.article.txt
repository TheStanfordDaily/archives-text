### 
Coach Stagg, of the University of
Chicago is planning to give his foot
ball team an outing in the shape of
a trip to Los Angeles. Negotiations
are under way for a Christmas game
with the University of Southern Cal
ifornia, and if the latter school will
guarantee expenses, the trip will be
a certainty. If Southern California
will not schedule a game, Stagg says
that he will try to get a game with
some other team 011 the Coast. There
is little doubt, however, but that the
University of Southern California will
accept the proposition.
