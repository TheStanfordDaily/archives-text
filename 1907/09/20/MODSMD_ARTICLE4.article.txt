# PLANS FOR SENIOR CIRCUS
## COMMITTEES APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TURNER. Senior Class Discusses Plans to Entertain California Seniors on Day of Big Game. 
### 
The manner in which the Senior
Circus should be managed was dus
cusscd ;it some length this afternoon
a 1 the meeting of the Senior Class and
a plan was finally adopted. Accord
ing to the decision made this after
noon, after many motions and amend
ments had been considered, the class
president, class treasurer, and the
chairman of any committee who wish
e ■ advice, will constitute the exec
utive committee in charge of the cir
cus. This committee is practically
the president and secretary of the
ciass as the other members will
change as different matters come up
lor decision. The class voted to
give President Turner power to ap
point sub-committees which will
have control of certain features.
These committees will be held re
sponsible for the success of their par
ticular department. President Turn
e< has appointed ten committees and
the total number of class members
who have been assigned to positions
i> forty-five. The executive commit
tee in charge of the circus will de
cide upon the date for the affair .but
i will probably be held a week after
the intercollegiate football match.
Another matter that was brought
up for discussion in the class meet
ing this afternoon was in regard to
the Seniors serving a luncheon on
the day of the intercollegiate foot
ball game to the visiting seniors from
the University of California. This
custom was inaugurated by the sen
iors at California last year, and the
present Senior Class intends to show
the same courtesy to their visitors
this year. A committee composed of
A. A. Murphy, chairman, C. L. Sev
ery and IT. F. Clark was appointed
to investigate the possibilities of en
tertaining the California men. At the
University of California the senior
ciass has a building devoted to its
own use, making it an easy matter
for them to entertain the Stanford
men. It will be a more difficult mat
ter here on account of finding a suit
able place.
The matter of securing class pins
was discussed and a committee con
sisting of K. L. Fenton, chairman,
J. O. Miller, and W. C. Theile was
appointed to investigate the propo
sition and find out whether it was
cvstomary to wear the pins before
graduation, and if so, to make ar
rangements for ordering them. The
committees appointed by President
Turner to have charge of the differ
ent branches of the Senior circus are
as follows: Parade: E- J- Hadley, P.
Stewart, and J. E. Cushing; lights and
lighting, E. C. Thompson, J. H. Rid
dell, and L. M. Klauber; advertising
and publicity, E. N. Smith, D- H. Fer
ry and P. B. Delano, chairman; side
shows and features, F. A. Curtin, J.
