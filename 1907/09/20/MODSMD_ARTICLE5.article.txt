# MORE INTERCLASS GAMES
## PRELIMINARY SCRUMS WON BY UPPERCLASSMEN. Fast and Accurate Work of Junior Backfield.—Cadwalader Injures Shoulder. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon was entirely
devoted.to the playing of preliminary
interclass games. There was none of
the usual practice work. The Jun
iors lined up against the Sophomores
for two halves of ten minutes each,
and the Seniors opposed the Fresh
men for the same length of time. Al
though iqio kept their opponents
from scoring during the initial period.
1909 then took a brace and won the
game easily by a score of 9-0. 1908
had no difficulty in defeating the en
tering classmen, running up a total
of 29 poinis. At the conclusion of
these two contests, the substitute fif
teens were sent on the field to strug
gle for ten minutes. Here the Sopho
mores won 8-0, while the Seniors and
Freshmen fought to a 0-0 tie.
The 1009-1910 game was easily the
most interesting of the afternoon.
Neither side was able to score until
the commencement of the second half,
when the Juniors began with a rush,
making two tries within as many min
utes of play. Soon afterwards, the
ball was again forced across the line
for three more points. The winning
fifteen's backfield worked very well
together, constantly making substan
tial gains by passing rushes. The in
dividual work of Rogers was a fea
ture.
The Freshmen were outclassed in
weight, experience and aggressiveness,
and consequently they never bad a
chance. The Seniors scored seven
tries, Fenton kicking four of the
goals. The work of the heavy 1908
forwards showed a great improve
ment over former practices. Although
they were pitted against a weak set
oi opponents, their playing neverthe
less is deserving of commendation.
Thorpe surprised everyone by ap
pearing on the field, having recovered
from his threatened illness. Cadwal
ader was forced to retire from the
game because of a slight injury to his
shoulder. Following is the way the
teams faced each other yesterday:
