# PLANS FOR NEXT SEASON
## BOAT CLUB WISHES MURPHY RETAINED AS COACH. Turner Chosen President To Fill Vacancy Caused by Resignation of Conant. 
### 
F. YV. Turner, '08, was elected pre
sident of the Boat Club at a meeting
of that organization last Friday ev
ening. Turner succeeds R. H. Con
ant, '08, who was elected last year
but failed to return to college this
fall.
The club discussed the advisability
of taking action toward the securing
o 1 " a coach, but it was the unanimous
opinion that nothing should be done
until definite word had been received
from Murphy as to his plans for next
year.
Three applications for the position
of coach have come to the club, and
all have been accompanied by very
good recommendations. Two oars
men from the New York Athletic
Club and the Station Island Boat
Club have applied, while the third ap
plication comes from Pope, of San
Francisco, who asked for the same
position last year. Since there will
probably be no coach here this fall,
there is no possibility of the crew
making the trip South to compete
in the Thanksgiving regatta.
Light training may be indulged in
after the football season, but this was
not definitely decided Friday evening.
The prospects for another winning
crew are bright, as five of last year's
Varsity have returned to college. If
Murphy's services can be obtained the
club is very confident of another vic
tory over California next spring.
Much interest was evinced concern
ing the filling of Lagunita. Trips to
Redwood for training purposes early
next semester will be very inconven
ient because of the large squad during
the first of the season, and the club
will exert its best efforts to have the
lake refilled again this year.
