As yet no steps have been taken
by the Executive Committee toward
the retention of Coach Murphy. It
is hardly necessary to reiterate the
arguments in favor of such action.
The work which this man has done
for Cardinal crews stands for itself
and the future of boating at Stan
ford could hardly be placed in safer
hands. The engaging of any coach
but Murphy to take charge of the
1908 crews means beside the introduc
tion of new methods of training, the
perfection of a new stroke in one sem
ester. It will be found that Murphy's
demands for a yearly contract are not
exorbitant, but oti the contrary rea
sonable, and that by far the safer
and wiser plan is to retain the coach
who gave 11s victory last year.
