The committee in charge of the
Glee Club tryouts for stunt men,
which were held in the chapel last
Friday evening, were not satisfied
with the showing made. Only a few
new candidates appeared and there
is still a decided need of good end
men. There will be another tryout
in the chapel at 7:30 tomorrow
evening for any who are interested
In the minstrel show. No stunts
need be prepared for these tryouts,
as the object is more to get a line
011 the new material and have men
sign up for work.
No definite date has been set for
the minstrel show, but it will be In
the latter part of October. The Mu
sical Clubs are now working for the
Carnival in Palo Alto, where they
will appear both Friday and Satur
day.
