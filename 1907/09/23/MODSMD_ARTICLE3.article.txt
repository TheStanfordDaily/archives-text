opposed the Juniors, while the under
class fifteens were lined up against
substitute teams chosen from the ex

Seniors, Sophomores and Freshmen
came out victorious. The playing of
the last two fifteens was excellent,
especially the work of the Sopho

dribbling were fine. Coach Lanagan
was greatly encouraged by the Rug

he was correspondingly discouraged
by the showing of the upperclassmen.

Sophomores would have had little
difficulty in disposing of either the
Seniors or the Juniors. The Fresh
men also did good work in both the
back and forward divisions, easily de
feating their opponents by a score of
15 to 0. For the first time this sea
son the first-year men seemed to
know what to do.
The game between the two upper
class teams was characterized by
slow and ragged playing and contin

but the 1009 fifteen was badly handi
capped by the absence of Cadwalader
and Owen from the backfield, while
soon after the game started they
were put to a further disadvantage,
Molman and Swickard being forced
to retire. The Juniors were the first
to score. After the kick-off the ball
was rushed several times from one
end of the field to the other, finally
going into touch on the Seniors' 40-
yard line. The 1909 forwards slow

In the latter line-up, the backfield
work of Green. Drew, Mitchell and
Cook was really brilliant. Time and
again they rushed the ball for twenty
01 thirty yards. They were ably
backed up by the forward division,
which played in perfect form. For
the Freshmen, Reed, as usual, Cline,
Sobey and Dole did the best work.
But the team, as a whole, showed up
