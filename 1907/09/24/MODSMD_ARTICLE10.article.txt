# BEGIN FALL TRACK WORK.
## Large Number of Athletes Start Light Training.â€”Cross-Country Squad Numbers Thirty. 
### 
The fall training on the track is
now well under way and there are a
large number of men out every after
noon. , Trainer Moulton and Captain
F. R. Lanagan, '08, have been out 011
the track supervising the work and
are both well pleased with the large
number of men who are now training.
Tt is too early for any of the men to
show their real ability as the work
has been light so far and the runners
are just beginning to get into fair
condition. B. W. Lee, the Freshman
half-miler from Harvard School, was
out 011 the track yesterday afternoon,,
but the foot which he injured in an
automobile accident last summer is
causing him considerable trouble and
he will have to work very lightly this,
fall.
There are a good many Freshmen
in training and also a large number
of men in the other classes who are
new to track work, from whom "Dad"
Moulton expects to develop some
Varsity material. H. L. Horton, '08,
who won nine points in the intercol
legiate field meet in 1005, is a most
valuable addition to the track mater
ial now in college and he may do
some light training this fall.
The cross-country men, under E.
J. Nas#i, '07, and W. C. Shelton, '08,
now form a squad of about thirty
runners and they are working regu
larly three times a week. The dis
tance covered by the cross-country
runners has been about a mile, but
this will be increased as the men get
into condition.
