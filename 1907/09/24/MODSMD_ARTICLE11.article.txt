# Debating Society Adopts Constitution
## 
### 
The tqio Debating Society last
evening adopted a constitution and
by-laws which provide for a system
of fines for non-attendance. These
are arranged on a sliding scale so that
the maximum fine is imposed upon
a member absent from a meeting at
which he is scheduled to take part
in the program. The by-laws also
provide that all new members must
be voted upon by the society.
