The Executive Committee will have
no little difficulty in convincing the
Student Body that good grounds ex
ist for the change in rooter's hats.
We are at a loss to understand just
what criticism can be directed against
the headgear which has been worn by
Stanford undergraduates at the var
sity games for over six years. If the
old bat did not give satisfaction any
knowledge of it was kept carefully in
the dark and provoked no open dis
cussion. The negative attitude of the
Student Body upon the question and
the absence of any general sentiment
in favor of the change made by the
Committee are strong indications that
no change is desired and that the
old hat is satisfactory to everyone
concerned. As the matter now stands
the great majority of undergraduates
are asked to purchase new hats which
will be of no more service than those
which they used last year.
