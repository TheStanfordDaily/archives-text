# DR. JORDAN AT BERKELEY.
## Discusses Problems of Australia.â€”Says Old American Spirit is Not Being Preserved 
### 
Dr. Jordan addressed the Berkeley |
Unitarian Club on the subject of
"Economic Problems in Australia"
last Sunday evening. He gave at
some length his impressions of var
ious problems which the southern
continent has to face. He expressed
no alarm over the fact that the Asiat
ics are over-running Australia, but
said that decay in our own race was
much more to be feared than compe
tition from the Orientals.
One of the most interesting points
he made was in regard to the habit
of tipping. In Australia this is an
accepted evil, made inevitable by the
existence of a caste feeling. In Amer
ica there is supposed to be no class
spirit, yet the tipping evil is constant
ly spreading. Dr. Jordan declared
this to be an evidence that the old
fashioned American spirit was decay
ing.
