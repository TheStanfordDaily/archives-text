A STYLISH HAT
Adds more to the appearance of a man than any
other part of his apparel. We have dozens of pat
terns in all colors, any of which are as nobby as the
accompanying cut, at $3.50.
We've noticed that the most popular priced GOLF JACKET
is 55.00, so have laid in an immense supply at this price.
Colors are cardinal gray, crimson and white, with collar and
cuff in pleasing contrast.

Hart, Schaffner <fe Marx clothes is hard to satisfy with anything
else. Come in and inspect them.
