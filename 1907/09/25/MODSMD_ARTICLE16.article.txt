Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The present Executive Committee
seems to have stepped beyond its
powers in the matter of changing the
rooters' hats for the big game this
year. The present headgear has done
service for six years on the Cardin
al bleachers and has come to be re
garded as much of a fixture as the
Varsity yell. It is easy to imagine
what a storm of protest would have
been aroused if the Committee had
attempted to replace the Varsity yell
with something of their own manu
facture, yet there is little difference in
the logic of their present position.
They have advanced the rather
lame defense that the present hat is
"unsatisfactory." It is not claimed for
the present rooters' hat that it is the
best obtainable, but then it may be
claimed that our Varsity is not as
effective as California's "Oski-Wow."
Has that ever been advanced as a rea
son for changing the yell?
Again how does the committee
know that the present hat is "unsatis
factory?" Did they make a systematic
canvass of the Student Body to ascer
tain the prevailing sentiment 011 the
present hat? No, the motion was
passed at a hastily called special meet
ing with 110 previous warning or an
nouncement. To say the least, such
tactics lead to the asking of embarass
ing questions.
The present rooters' hat may be
| "unsatisfactory" to the ten members
| of the Executive Committee, but it is
perfectly satisfactory to a large por
tion of the Student Body, who might
naturally be expected to have some
voice in the matter of changing it.
That this is not permitted them, is a
most arbitrary and unwarranted as
sumption of power by the Executive
Committee and one which should not
pass unchallenged. 1908.
