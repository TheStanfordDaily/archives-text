# NEVADA GAMES ARE OFF
## RENO MANAGER CANCELS FOOTBALL DATES. Football Men Believe Stanford Has Been Discriminated Against.—Athletic Relations May Be Severed. 
### 
Stanford football men are highly in
ccnsed at the attitude assumed by the
management of Rugby affairs at the
University of Nevada, and unless
some mitigating turn in the situation
takes place within the next few days
it is possible that athletic relations
with tire Sagebrushers will be declar
ed off by Graduate Manager Knupp,
'07. The games, which have been
tentatively scheduled with the out
side collegians, have been called off
by Manager Gallagher of Nevada, and
two impossible dates for the Cardinal
substituted with the curt information
that November 2 and 16 were the on
ly available days which the Universi
ty of Nevada football schedule would
permit for a match with Stanford.
This information, which upon the
surface appears difficult to understand
in view of the fact of the scarcity of
Rugby material on the Coast, has led
those in a position to understand the
situation on the Stanford squad to
strongly suspect that the Varsity ha>-
been discriminated against in the se
lecting of dates, and bitter feeling
has been caused.
The first inkling received here that
there would be any difficulty in se
curing games with the University of
Nevada was in the nature of a tele
gram received last week by Graduate
Manager G. Knupp, in which the
manager of the University of Nevada
stated the only available dates open,
ll was a surprise to all concerned
as it was generally understood that
former Graduate Manager D. D.
Sales, '06, had scheduled a game for
October 26. Stanford has, however,
no contract for this date and while
it is believed the Nevadans could ar
range to meet the Cardinal upon this
date, no further attempt will be made
to force the issue.
The players of Nevada will meet
the varsity of the University of Cali
fornia the week after the Freshman
intercollegiate game, and it has been
an open question as to what would
hinder a match with Stanford the fol
lowing Wednesday. This fact and
the evident impossibility of the two
dates suggested by Manager Gallag
her has widened the breach.
It is the attitude of those in control
at present that in the future no Car
dinal teams of any branch of athlet
ics will meet the outside institution
unless the present difficulty is set
tled. Manager Knupp will not make
any further attempt to arrange a
match and the reconciliation must
come from other quarters.
The dates suggested by Nevada are
impossible inasmuch as November 2
is reserved for the Vancouver match
and November 16 would fall as a post
season match which « c undesirable.
