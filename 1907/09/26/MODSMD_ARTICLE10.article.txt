# Emergency Nurse on Campus.
## 
### 
During the past week tlic Guild
Board lias been attempting to utilize
the recently appointed surgical nurse
at the Hospital for surgical emer
gencies on the campus. Tf the plan
proves practical the Board will prob
ably establish this as a permanent
feature of its work. This idea was
originally a part of the policy of the
< Â»uild. but owing to the great expense
conected with the Hospital, it had to
he given up until the present. The
nurse will hold office hours from 10
to 12 each morning in the Hygiene
department. Her duties are in the
nature of emergency dressings and
care for minor injuries and illnesses.
