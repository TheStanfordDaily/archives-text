Every semester it seems necessary
to call attention to the unwritten law
which forbids smoking on the Quad.
A number of students appear to re

and Romanic Languages departments
as exempt from this rule, but these
places are as much a part of the Quad

that they be respected as such. It is
but a few steps across the road and
it is much more satisfactory to take
this additional trouble in order to
avoid the risk of breaking one of
Stanford's oldest traditions.
