# California Freshmen Hard at Work.
## 
### 
The California coaches have an
nounced that from now until the
game on October 12, they will devote
most of their time to getting their
Freshman team in condition. Their
men have been training a little long
er than the Stanford candidates, and
they are also greatly encouraged over
the number of prospective stars in the
first-year squad, A. Munn, the former
Oakland High School man, in par
ticular, being looked upon as a cpm
ing Varsity man, although he has had
very little football experience. The
game la->t Saturday, when the univer
sity 1-reslunen defeated the Barbar
ians 15-0, is taken as an indication
that they are playing in good form.
