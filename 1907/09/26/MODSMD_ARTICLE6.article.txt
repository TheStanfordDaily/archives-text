# PLAN FOR TOURNAMENT
## INTERSCHOLASTIC TENNIS MAY BE HELD HERE. Junior Matches to Be Played Off Monday.â€”Freshman Tryouts Begin Saturday. 
### 
The plans for an interscholastic
tennis tournament to be held in con
nection with the interscholastic track
meet were discussed and partially
formulated by the Tennis Club at a
meeting held at the Delta Kappa Ep
silon house last night. The idea of
such a tournament was suggested to
the club by the Interscholastic Asso
ciation, which will co-operate with
the tennis men in an endeavor to
make it a success.
T. C. Henry, '10, A. J. Cowan, '09,
and M. O. Adams, '09, were delegated
as a committee to examine into the
matter and take the necessary steps
toward the carrying out of the plan.
The tournament will probably be in
vitational for the winners of the pre
paratory school tournaments through
out the state, and it is possible that
the matches will be played the day
before the interscholastic meet is
held.
To further the possibilities of such
a plan being carried out, the club ap
pointed a committee consisting of H.
I\ Clark, '08, and C. W. Borough, '08,
to look into the ways and means of
obtaining new courts to be used both
for interscholastic and intercollegiate
purposes.
The following officers were elected
for the ensuing year: President, A.
A. Mathewson, '08; vice-president, J.
K. Cassell, '08; secretary-treasurer, T.
C Henry, '10. P. B. Delano, '08, and
A. A. Gowan, '09, were elected mem
bers of the executive committee.
On account of the small number of
entries in the 1911 tryout the date for
the Freshman matches has been post
poned until Saturday morning at 8:30
in the hope that more entries will be
received. The Junior tryout will be
begun Monday afternoon at 1
o'clock and the Seniors will decide
their championship on Wednesday at
the same hour. All entries for the
1911 tournament must be handed in
before tomorrow noon and the upper
classmen must be entered before Sun
day night. L. B. Mackey and T. C.
Henry will receive all entries.
