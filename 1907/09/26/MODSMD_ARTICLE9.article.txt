# COACHES PICK FIFTEEN
## FIRST VARSITY TEAM OF SEASON IS CHOSEN. Sophomores Easily Defeat First-Year Men In Fast Game By a Score of 28 to 0. 
### 
The first Varsity team to be chosen
this season lined up this afternoon
for practice work, preparatory to
meeting the Barbarians on Saturday.
The team was composed of the fol
lowing men:
Koerner, Rhyne, Minturn, Craw
ford, Pemberton, L. Smith, Thorpe,,
forwards; Miller, wing forward;
Heinley, half; Vail, Owen, fives; Van
dervoort, center; Rogers, Cook,
wings; Kenton, full.
After the Seniors had so decidedly
beaten the Juniors yesterday, the two
underclass fifteens lined up for a
practice game. The Sophomores play
ed in whirlwind style and in a single
half of fifteen minutes made eight
tries 011 the Freshmen. Little's two
goals brought the final score to 28
to 0. The entire 1910 team worked
as a unit, rushing and dribbling most
accurately. It is difficult to say who
did the best work, but the splendid
playing of Faulkner as full and the
dodging and passing of Cook are de
serving of special commendation. At
present, the final interclass game, be
tween the Seniors and Sophomores,,
bids fair to be very close and excit
ing. The teams are evenly matched
in weight, and a battle royal should
result.
At the conclusion of the 1910-1911
scrum, the A and B substitute fifteens
faced each other for a few minutes,,
the latter winning by a score of 3 to
o.
S. M. Vail, of San Francisco, was
yesterday elected captain of the Sen
iors, while C. A. Thompson, of Los
Angeles, was chosen to lead the Jun
iors. In the interclass game Goodell
tore a ligament in his foot, and he
will be kept off the field for at least
ten days.
