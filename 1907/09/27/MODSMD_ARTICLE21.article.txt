# Old Rooter's Hat May Be Worn.
## 
### 
Through a mistake the Daily Palo
Alto misquoted the recent action of
the Executive Committee in regard
to the new rooter's hat. The Exec
utive Committee has adopted an offi
cial rooter's hat, and all those pur
chasing rooter's hats this year are
urged to secure the new hat. How
ever, the committee did not decide
that a man had to have the new hat
in order to sit in the rooting section.
The decision of the committee was:
"Absolutely no one who is not pro
vided with a roorter's hat will be per
mitted in the rooting section." This
may be considered to include the old
style rooter's hat as well as the new.
