# Cardinal Team to Play Barbarians Tomorrow
## Opposing Fifteens Will Line Up On Stanford Field In the First Varsity Game. 
### 
The first Varsity game of the pre
sent season will be played on Stan
ford Field tomorrow afternoon at
3:30, when the Cardinal team will
lu e up against the Barbarian fifteen,
of San Francisco. During the past
week the visitors have been materi
ally strengthened by the addition of
several high class phyers *0 their
ranks.
Although the Varsity has been to
gether only two days, they may be
relied on to put up a fast, stubborn
fight. In practice their work has
been uniformly good, considering the
limited time they have been together.
I ; the backtield they are noticeably
handicapped by the absence of Hol
man at wing, but Vail, Ganong, Ow
en, Vandervoort and Cook form a
sirong, heady combination. Fenton,
at full, is living up to his reputation,
by playing in his usual brilliant,
though accurate style. The five vet
eran forwards are a tower of strength
in the scrum, while there is active
competition for the other two places.
Miller and Heinley complete the fif
teen. The team as a whole is fast
and aggressive, besides being fairly
heavy.
The Barbarians have not yet de
cided upon the exact line-up which
they will present in tomorrow's
game, as it is doubtful what posi
tions the new men will fill. It is
probable that the personnel of the
Varsity will be substantially the same
as it was at this afternoon's practice,
when they lined up as follows-
Koerner, Rhyne, Minturn, Pember
ton, Crawford, Thorpe, Reynolds, for
wards; Miller, wing forward; Hein
ley, half; Vail Ganong. fives; Vander
voort, center; Owen, Cook wings;
Fenton, full.
For the second time this season the
turf field will be used tomorrow. It
sustained practically no damage fror
the scrums of last Saturday, and il
will again be played on at the time

of the final interclass match, which
v. ill probably take place next Tues
day. An admission of twenty-five cents
uill be charged for each game.
There was little change in the prac
tice of the squad yesterday afternoon.
The backs and forwards were separ
ated and put through the usual work.
To vary the monotony of the routine,
all the candidates spent several min
utes tackling the dummy. To con
clude the afternoon the different
teams were sent down the field in
passing rushes.
Practice Games Tomorrow.
At a late hour this afternoon the
coaches decided to have two practice
games previous to the varsity match
tomorrow. At 2:30 the Freshmen will
face the 1911 substitutes on the sup
plementary field, while the A and B
teams will line up on the turf.
