# FINAL INTERCLASS GAME
## SENIOR AND SOPHOMORE TEAMS TO MEET. Play Will Begin On Stanford Field Tomorrow Afternoon At 4:45. 
### 
The interclass Rugby championship
will be decided on Stanford Field to
morrow afternoon at 4:45, when the
Seniors will meet the Sophomores in
the final game of the series. The
opposing fifteens are very evenly
matched, and a close, exciting battle
should result. The teams are about
equal in weight, while 1910 excels in
the backfield and 1908 is superior in
the forward division.
The Sophomores have the best set
of backs of any of the classes. They
are fast, steady and accurate. But
this advantage is considerably coun
terbalanced by the superior work of
the Senior pack. With Koerner to
lead them the igoK scrum men will
take a lot of beating. They are al
ways 011 the aggressive and know the
game well. It is a toss-up as to
which team will be ahead at the final
pistol. Admission to the game will be
twenty-five cents.
The teams will line up as follows:
Seniors—Koerner, Rhyne, Shaner,
Femberton, Gay, Mathewson. Luhrs,
forwards; Miller, wing forward; Mc
intosh, half; Vail, Chandler, fives;
Vandervoort, center; Newland, Cole,
wings; Fenton, full.
Sophomores — Giesy, Batterson,
Mine, Fitting, Patrick, Reynolds,
Vose, forwards; Pemberton, wing for
ward; Little, half; Mitchell, Ganong,
fives; Green, center; Drew, Cook,
wings; Faulkner, full.
