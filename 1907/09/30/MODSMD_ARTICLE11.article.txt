# SERMON BY DR GARDNER.
## University Chaplain Pleads For Truth, Justice, and Purity at Regular Sunday Service. 
### 
"Paul's Exhortation to the Phillip
j pians" was the text of Dr. Gardner's
sermon Sunday morning. "Whatso-
I ever things are true, whatsoever
| things are honorable, whatsoever
; tilings are just, whatsoever things are
pure—think 011 these things." On this
topic the preacher said in part:
"Truth should be the natural atmos
j phere of our minds, the regular hah
'it nf our life. We ought always to
speak the truth. A lie may be a pre
sent help in time of trouble, but it has
a fearful potency in creating future
mischief." He quoted Kant, who re
garded falsehood as a forfeiture of
personal worth, a destruction of per
sonal integrity. He further added,
"To be truthful is to be on God's side,
to think the truth, to have the truth,
to search for truth is to be in har
mony with the best of things as they
are.
Finally the preacher made a plea
for justice and purity as elements of
sound character, stating that in the
things that are true and honorable
and just, and of good reports, lie the
secret of man's happiness and des
tiny.
