there will be one coach, Graduate
Manager Knupp, Trainer "Dad"
Moulton, and three substitutes. Ihe
men will leave for San Jose at 7'-35
and will return 011 the Owl train
which arrives here Sunday morning.
The "Castaways,' which will line up
against the Varsity at l'iesta Park.
Los Angeles, were organized by Hig
gins, a man whose name is promin
ently connected with Southern Cali
fornia athletics. The team is managed
by E. M. Carley, who is well-known
as a football player. These men have
only been together for a short time
and have had but little opportunity
for practice.
Graduate Manager Knupp is in re
ceipt of a communication from a San
Bernardino organization asking to
play the Varsity Friday afternoon,
the day before the Los Angeles game,
but the proposition has been reject
ed owing to the fact that Coaches
Lanagan and Presley are not willing
to play two games which so closely
fellow one another.
