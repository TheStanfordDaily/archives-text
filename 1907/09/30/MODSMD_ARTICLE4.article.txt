# Varsity Gains Victory In First Rugby Game
## Barbarian Team Defeated By a Score Of 10 to 6--Cardinal Fifteen Has Strong Backfield. 
### 
The varsity fifteen successfully ini
tiated the Rugby season of 1907 Sat
urday afternoon by defeating the Bar
barians by a score of 10 to 6 in a fast,
hard-fought game. The good-sized
crowd that assembled was treated to
a tine exhibition, marred only by an
excessive number of penalties for mi
nor infringements, which frequently
interrupted the play. Each team ex
celled in a different department, the
Barbarians having much the stronger
pack, and the Cardinal being fast and
accurate in the rear division. Time
and again the Stanford backs got
clear in a passing rush only to be
slopped by the referee's whistle an
nouncing some foul. But although the
forwards played aggressively, their
lack of knowledge of the game worked
against them in opposition to such
experienced* scrum men. Still Koer
ner and Miller showed up especially
well. In the backfield, Ganong, Van
dervoort, Cook and Owen brought oft
many brilliant plays besides scoring
both the tries. The opposing backs
seemed helpless against them.
The dodging and passing of Cook,
in particular, was fine, and with the
exception of Fenton, he was the star
ot the day. But the little fullback de
serves first place without a doubt.
Many a time the superior Barbarian
pack broke up in a fast dribbling rush
which was only stopped by Fenton
who repeatedly secured and found
touch, gaining all the distance possi
ble. The visitors were never able to
block him in punting, as lie always
managed to get the ball away clearly.
Stanford began the scoring in the
middle of the first half. From a line
out on the Barbarians' 40-yard line
the ball went to Vail and Ganong.
passing on to Vandervoort, who in
turn passed out to Cook. The latter
made a spectacular run to within ten
yards of the goal when he transferred
to Owen, who planted the oval
squarely between the posts. Fenton
converted. Immediately after the in
itial kick-off in the second half lleinly
secured from a line-out near the cen
ter, and in a pretty scattered field
rush reached the 15-yard line before
being forced by Brown to pass to
Vandervoort who had 110 trouble in
scoring and again Fenton kicked the
goal. Soon after this the Barbarians
dribbled down the field to the Car
dinal's xo-yard line, and from a line
out there Friedlander carried the ball
over, but the attempt to convert fail
ed. The forwards by dribbling also
scored the other try for the Barbar
ians, rushing the ball twenty-five

yards, Horsefall then taking it over.
The missing of a difficult goal left the
final score 10 to 6. Time was called
soon after with the pigskin near the
center of the field. The teams lined

Cook, Vandervoort, three-quarters;

scoring and again Fenton kicked the
goal. Soon after this the Barbarians
dribbled down the field to the Car
dinal's xo-yard line, and from a line
out there Friedlander carried the ball
over, but the attempt to convert fail
ed. The forwards by dribbling also
scored the other try for the Barbar
ians, rushing the ball twenty-five

yards, Horsefall then taking it over.

The varsity fifteen successfully ini
tiated the Rugby season of 1907 Sat
urday afternoon by defeating the Bar
barians by a score of 10 to 6 in a fast,
hard-fought game. The good-sized
crowd that assembled was treated to
a tine exhibition, marred only by an
excessive number of penalties for mi
nor infringements, which frequently
interrupted the play. Each team ex
celled in a different department, the
Barbarians having much the stronger
pack, and the Cardinal being fast and
accurate in the rear division. Time
and again the Stanford backs got
clear in a passing rush only to be
slopped by the referee's whistle an
nouncing some foul. But although the
forwards played aggressively, their
lack of knowledge of the game worked
against them in opposition to such
experienced* scrum men. Still Koer
ner and Miller showed up especially
well. In the backfield, Ganong, Van
dervoort, Cook and Owen brought oft
many brilliant plays besides scoring
both the tries. The opposing backs
seemed helpless against them.
The dodging and passing of Cook,
in particular, was fine, and with the
exception of Fenton, he was the star
ot the day. But the little fullback de
serves first place without a doubt.
Many a time the superior Barbarian
pack broke up in a fast dribbling rush
which was only stopped by Fenton
who repeatedly secured and found
touch, gaining all the distance possi
ble. The visitors were never able to
block him in punting, as lie always
managed to get the ball away clearly.
Stanford began the scoring in the
middle of the first half. From a line
out on the Barbarians' 40-yard line
the ball went to Vail and Ganong.
passing on to Vandervoort, who in
turn passed out to Cook. The latter
made a spectacular run to within ten
yards of the goal when he transferred
to Owen, who planted the oval
squarely between the posts. Fenton
converted. Immediately after the in
itial kick-off in the second half lleinly
secured from a line-out near the cen
ter, and in a pretty scattered field
rush reached the 15-yard line before
being forced by Brown to pass to
