# LAW STUDENT MISSING
## C. SILENT DISAPPEARS FROM CAMPUS. Departed For San Jose September 20. No Clue For Police To Work On. 
### 
C. Silent, '07, lias mysteriously dis
appeared and as yet no information
1 has been received as to his where
abouts. He left the Delta Tau Delta
house Friday, September 20, without
saying where he was going or when
he would return. Some days before,
he had announced that he was plan
ning to spend Saturday with his mo
ther, who was visiting in San Jose.
Understanding that he had gone there
his friends were not concerned when
he failed to return, thinking that he
had extended his visit. For this rea
son no effort was made to locate him
until he had been gone a week.
Telegrams addressed to his mother
in San Jose and to his father in Los
Angeles then brought out the fact
that neither knew where he was.
A search has been instituted, but
up to this time nothing whatever has
been learned of his fate. The police
of San Jose and all the bay cities are
1 working 011 the case, as well as sev
eral Pinkerton detectives.
Among the many theories advanced
to account for his disappearance, not
one seems to fit the circumstances.
His friends flout the idea that he
j wandered off while temporarily de
ranged, saying that his mind was en
tirely sound and normal. They are
entirely at a loss to account for his
actions and will advance no conjecture
at all.
Silent was a Law major register
ing from Los Angeles, and a mem
ber of the Detla Tau Delta frater
nity. He was doing advanced work
in the Law department this year.
