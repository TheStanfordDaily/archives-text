# TOWN GIVEN OVER TO FAIR.
## Stanford Students Contribute Much to Success of the Palo Alto Street Carnival. 
### 
Palo Alto had two gala days Fri
day and Saturday. Members of the
Student Body contributed much to the
success of the Carnival by conducting
nearly all the sideshows and games of
chance, which included concerts by
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, wheels
o: fortune, egg-throwing contests and
the exhibition of some of the historic
tables covered with the names of
Stanford men. "Dad" Moulton exhib
ited his trained dogs.
Stanford organizations holding con
cessions report that their ventures
were very successful. The Combined
Musical Clubs, holding three conces
sions. cleared about $75.00 and the En
cina Club profits amounted to nearly
$60.00. These figures represent the*
pioceeds after deducting the expenses
and twenty-live per cent of the
amount cleared, which was paid to
the carnival committee. The Musi
cal Clubs will use the profits of their
shows on the proposed trip during
the Christmas holidays and the fines
collected in the "Lemon Court" will
be turned over to the Encina Club
treasurer.
