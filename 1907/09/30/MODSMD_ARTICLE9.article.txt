It is to be hoped that Stanford will
be represented by a strong track team
i.' the fall meet of the Pacific Ath- I
letic Association. The Executive I
Committee has done its part by mak
ing provision for the trip and whether j
the invitation is accepted or not must |
now be settled by the athletes them- j
selves. Although a number of the
tiack men are playing Rugby yet
enough are at leisure to insure a rep
resentative team if they are willing to j
enter training. Care should be taken
however, that they do not go poor- J
ly conditioned, which is very possible 1
a« long as Trainer Moulton has the 1
football players on his hands. A i
112
team incapable of doing itself justice
would hurt the name of Stanford !
more than the absence of the Car-1
dinal colors from the meet, and if the |
men decide to compete it should be j
with the understanding that there
is to be hard and systematic work in ]
preparation.
