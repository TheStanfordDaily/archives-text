# FRESHMEN VS. SAN JOSE
## FIRST-YEAR MEN TO PLAY HIGH SCHOOL THURSDAY. Coaches Make Many Changes in Line-up of 1911 Fifteen.â€”Mitchell on Varsity. 
### 
The Freshmen will have their first
game with an outside fifteen next
Thursday afternoon, when they will
line up against a Rugby team from
the San Jose High School. The lat
ter fifteen has had a limited time for
practice, but they should be able to
give the 1911 men a good fight. Thus
far our first-year players have been
very weak, especially in their scrums
with opposing classes, and as the
game with California is now only ten
days away, their showing against Sail
Jose will be awaited with great inter
est. The kick-off will take place 011
the turf field at 4:30, and an admis
sion of twenty-five cents will be
charged.
As a result of the extremely poor
exhibition of the first Freshmen last
Saturday there was a general shake
up in their personnel yesterday.
Light changes were made, and they
lined up as follows: Cook, Woodville,
Dole, Evans, Woodcock, Arnold, Ves
ei, forwards; Towne, wing forward;
Turner, half; Garden, Sobey, fives.
Cline, centcr; St. John, Elliott, wings;
Fletcher, full.
Other than this practice continued
as usual. Holman and Cadwalader
were again on the field, having almosr
entirely recovered from their injur
ies. On the Varsity Owen was re
placed by Mitchell at five.
