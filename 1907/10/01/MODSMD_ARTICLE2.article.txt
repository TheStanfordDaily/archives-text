# TRACK MEET ON SATURDAY.
## Handicap Affair Will Be Held Saturday Morning.â€”Men Decide To Go To P.A.A. Meet. 
### 
The first track meet of the season
will be held next Saturday morning
and a track team of fourteen men will
be sent to the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation meet at Berkeley, October
26. These were the two important
results of the meeting of track men
held at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house last night. All the prominent
varsity track men attended the meet
ing and expresed their desire to com
pete in the P. A. A. meet and Cap
tain F. R. Lanagan, '08, hopes to take
a strong team up to Berkeley. The
men who expect to participate will
train regularly for the next four
weeks and should get into condition
before October 26. Among the men
who will probably enter this meet
are: Captain Lanagan. '08, pole-vault
er; H. L. Horton, '08, hurdler and
shot putter; E. J. Nash, '07, two
miler; P. M. Davis, '08, quarter-miler;
C. L. Severy. '08, half-miler; G. D.
Hussey, '09, quarter-miler; B. L.
Gregg, '09, hurdler; and H. H. Maun
drell, 'to niiler. There are several
other men who will probably be in
condition to take the trip but the ex
?ct personnel of the team cannot be
stated at present.
The track meet to be held next
Saturday will be a handicap affair and
the varsity men will give the new
men a handicap in the different
events. All the distances above the
quarter mile will be considerably
shortened and the principal idea of
the meet is to get a line on the new
men who are in training. The men
who are to enter the meet should sign
up at the training house and the en
tries will close on Thursday night.
Captain Lanagan wishes all the men
in training to enter the meet Satur
day.
