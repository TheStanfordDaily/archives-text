# SOPHOMORES WIN GAME
## SENIORS ARE DEFEATED IN INTERCLASS GAME. Victory Comes to Underclassmen After Two Halves of Fast, Hardfought Rugby. 
### 
Seniors 5
Sophomores 13
The interclass Rugby championship
of 1907 was won by the Sophomores
this afternoon, when they defeated the
Seniors in the' final game of the
series by a score of r3 to 5. As was
anticipated, it was a very evenly con
tested match, and the result was in
doubt throughout both halves. The
excellent work of the upperclass for
wards did not quite offset the fast,
accurate play of the opposing backs.
Ganong, Mitchell and Cook mad?
1,-irge gains repeatedly for their team,
ai d Faulkner, at full, broke up many
vigorous rushes of the Senior pack.
'I hough Koerner, Rhyne, Shaner, Pem
berton, and Gay, formed a strong
combination, greatly interfering with
the passing rushes of their opponents,
the Sophomore scrum proved to be
much stronger than was anticipated
and had a little the best of their op
ponents throughout the game. The
individual playing of Fenton and Van
e'ervoort should also be mentioned.
The teams lined up as follows:
Seniors—Koerner, Rhyne, Shaner,
Pemberton, Gay, Mathewson, Luhrs,
forwards; Miller, wing forward; Mc
intosh, half; Strong, Chandler, fives;
Vandervoort, center; Baldwin, Cole,
wings; Fenton, full.
Sophomores — Giesy, Batterson,
Hine, Fitting, Patrick, Reynolds,
Vose, forwards; Pemberton, wing for
ward; Little, half; Mitchell, Ganong,
fives; Green, center; Drew, Cook,
wings; Faulkner, full.
