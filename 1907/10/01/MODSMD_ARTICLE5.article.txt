# Searchers Find No Trace Of Missing Student
## Father of Chester Silent Arrives On Campus--Pinkerton Detectives Are Given Charge of Case. 
### 
Judge Charles Silent, of Los
Angeles, father of the missing Stan
ford'student, who arrived on the Cam
pus yesterday to assume active charge
of the search for his son, has offer
ed a reward of $250 for any informa
tion as to his whereabouts. The
Judge conferred with President Jor
dan late yesterday afternoon and it
was agreed that the Student Body
should be called out to assist in the
starch if all other means failed. Doc
tor Jorrftin will announce at the As
sembly tomorrow, whether it will be
necessary for the students to aid, and
if so, what plans have been formulat
ed for the organization of the search
ers.
A force of Pinkerton detective -
reached Palo Alto yesterday and have
t;.ken up the search from here, mak
ing Palo Alto their headquarters. The
Pacific Coast chief of the Pinkerton
agency is expected this afternoon to
take personal supervision of his men.
Many searching parties are now out
i: the hills and country side. Detec
tives are all over the county and
around the bay working on the case.
Four horsemen left this morning by
the Page Mill road, one to follow the
road and the others to scour the ad
jacent country and look through all
the farmhouses. Eight men on foot
and three automobile parties are seek
ing for him in the hills back of the
University and along the Coast. The
students of Belmont School, of which
h«- is an alumnus, are continuing the
en est in the country between there
and Pescadero. Besides these, the
members of the Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity at Berkeley and the police
forces of the bay citics are conduct
ing a careful search of the bay coun
ties.
Up to this time but two possible
clues have been discovered. The most
important one of these was obtained
from E. J. Upham, agent for the Sin
ger Sewing Machine Company, who
with his aunt, Mrs. Bcldan, was in
the hills back of the Campus last
Sunday. When about five miles from
the University, near the junction of
tl.e Page Mill and Mayfield roads,
he met a young man who correspond
ed to the description of Silent. The
person in question was dressed in
corduroys and a gray sweater, without
coat or hat. He was seated under a
tree, and had taken off his shoe for
the purpose of dressing a sore foot.
Upham talked to him, asking about
the Mayfield road, and from his con
versation he seemed to be perfectly
rational and sane. When shown a
picture of Silent, both Upham and
Mrs. Beldan positively identified it as
that of the man whom they had seen
in the hills. The fact that Silent had
been suffering for some time from a
sere foot seems to clinch the identi
fication. The only discrepancy in this

Campus for eleven days, and
for whom all search so far has
been in vain. Pinkerton detec

clue is that the man seen in the hills
wore gold-rimmed glasses, while Si
lent is not thought to have possess
ed glasses of that style.
Immediately upon learning these
facts, Judge Silent dispatched two
detectives with a team and wagon to
follow up the clue.
The second and less plausible clue
is that he went to San Francisco last
Wednesday. A lady, who knows him,
claims to have seen him on a train
going to San Francisco. Accord! gto
her he was dressed in corduroys and
snck coat with a gray sweater. She
does not know where he boarded the
train or where he left it but is posi
tive in her identification of him. These
two clues are all that his friends have
to work on. but both are being dili

Judge Charles Silent, of Los
Angeles, father of the missing Stan
ford'student, who arrived on the Cam
pus yesterday to assume active charge
of the search for his son, has offer
ed a reward of $250 for any informa
tion as to his whereabouts. The
Judge conferred with President Jor
dan late yesterday afternoon and it
was agreed that the Student Body
should be called out to assist in the
starch if all other means failed. Doc
tor Jorrftin will announce at the As
sembly tomorrow, whether it will be
necessary for the students to aid, and
if so, what plans have been formulat
ed for the organization of the search
ers.
A force of Pinkerton detective -
reached Palo Alto yesterday and have
t;.ken up the search from here, mak
ing Palo Alto their headquarters. The
Pacific Coast chief of the Pinkerton
agency is expected this afternoon to
take personal supervision of his men.
Many searching parties are now out
i: the hills and country side. Detec
tives are all over the county and
around the bay working on the case.
Four horsemen left this morning by
the Page Mill road, one to follow the
road and the others to scour the ad
jacent country and look through all
the farmhouses. Eight men on foot
and three automobile parties are seek
ing for him in the hills back of the
University and along the Coast. The
students of Belmont School, of which
h«- is an alumnus, are continuing the
en est in the country between there
and Pescadero. Besides these, the
members of the Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity at Berkeley and the police
forces of the bay citics are conduct
ing a careful search of the bay coun
ties.
Up to this time but two possible
clues have been discovered. The most
important one of these was obtained
from E. J. Upham, agent for the Sin
ger Sewing Machine Company, who
with his aunt, Mrs. Bcldan, was in
the hills back of the Campus last
Sunday. When about five miles from
the University, near the junction of
tl.e Page Mill and Mayfield roads,
he met a young man who correspond
ed to the description of Silent. The
person in question was dressed in
corduroys and a gray sweater, without
coat or hat. He was seated under a
tree, and had taken off his shoe for
the purpose of dressing a sore foot.
Upham talked to him, asking about
the Mayfield road, and from his con
versation he seemed to be perfectly
rational and sane. When shown a
picture of Silent, both Upham and
Mrs. Beldan positively identified it as
that of the man whom they had seen
in the hills. The fact that Silent had
been suffering for some time from a
sere foot seems to clinch the identi
fication. The only discrepancy in this
