# MAKE SPIRITED TALKS
## GREGORY AND MAGEE SPEAK IN ASSEMBLY. Prominent Business Men From San Francisco Deliver Addresses. Hawaiian Girls Sing. 
### 
The Student Body gathered at the
fourth hour this morning in Assembly
Hall to listen to what proved to be
two of the most interesting speakers
who have visited the Campus in
some time. Concise and entertaining
in their addresses. Warren Gregory
one of the best known of San Fran
cisco attorneys, and Thomas Magee.
president of the University Club of
San Francisco, and at present a mem
ber of the new board of supervisors,
won applause and favor from all pre
sent. The speeches of the occasion
were largely augmented by the pre
sence and singing of the group of
young Hawaiian ladies who are tour
ing the United States.
Warren Gregory was the first of
the visitors to address the Assembly,
and chose as his subject the experi
ence of a practical lawyer and the dif
ficulties attending the career of a
young attorney. That law was not an
exact science was the keynote of his
address, and in dealing with this top
ic he briefly outlined the cases of
paramount interest today to prove his
point. The San Francisco situation
and graft prosecution all over the
country was commented upon. The
"thirteenth juror" was how the speak
er spoke of public opinion, and in ad
dressing the students he cautioned
them to consider news as seen in
newspapers and to form their opinions
slowly as public opinion was a
mighty force.
In his address he said in part:
"Law is not an exact science. Any
judge or jury decision is at best un
certain. Therefore we must consider
wherein lies this uncertainty. Some
say it is in the judge, but I think it
is more due to the community and
the jury. This leads to the two ques
tions which enter into every case and
must lx reckoned with. First, the
facts which enter into the case. These
are the main questions and must be
considered first. Second, what is the
legal result? What has legal preced
ent prescribed? Public opinion is the
"thirteenth juror" and he sits on ev
ery jury. He is the foreman of every
jury and it is his vote which decides
every case. Even legal precedence
overruled by this, the "thirteenth
jrror." If the judge gives a decis
ion which is not right in the opinion
of the people, it bears 110 weight and
soon becomes a dead letter. I sup
pi se here at Palo Alto as in many
other places you have a bunch of or
dinances which make it a misdemean
or to do most anything which any
one would want to do. But these arc
dead letter ordinances.
Suppose for instance a farmer
should come to town and tie his
horse to a post so located that he
broke an ordinance. If he was ar
rested he would not be convicted and
this would be due to the "thirteenth
juror."
"Public opinion affects legal pro
cedure. thus we see this business of
law is after all not a technical busi
ness. Public opinion is the all im
portant factor. It affects every case.
It can override fixed traditions and
precedent of any sort. It can affect
fact because public opinion will fail
to find facts. In contracts it will
override black and white. In the
last ten years I do not recall a single
case in which a jury found in favor
ot an insurance company in which a
policy was in litigation. Public opin
ion sitting in the jury box overruled
the contracts. In damage and injury
suits it is the same. Here the widest
latitude is obtained.
"I wish you would not forget that
the only place to try a case is in the
court room. I take it that Schmitz"
would never have been convicted
and Ruef would never have been
forced to his ignominious confession
had it not been for public opinion.
The public came to such a place that
that they would and could no longer
stand for the actions of these men.
1 shall never forget the undercurrent
of deep feeling which arose when
Ruef attempted to overthrow the dis
trict attorney's office and replace Mr.
Langdon by himself. They are going
through the forms of law to right
things in an orderly way and people
should be proud."
The speaker wound up by scoring
the press for taking sides in law suits
and legal procedures and qualifying
the "thirteenth juror." He was fol
lowed by Thomas Magee. In a few
introductory words he made a strong
appeal to the students for enthusiasm
and paid a glowing tribute to the
Stanford spirit as he had seen it ex
hibited at the Assembly. It was this
spirit which he wanted to see mani
fested in San Francisco. The politi
cal situation was expounded in in
troducing his topic and better gov
ernment was advocated.
"1 came here to tell you of the val

ue of enthusiasm in University and
business life but from the exhibition
just given I see 1 might just as well
address you on "Food as a Cure of
Hunger." From your songs and spirit
1 have caught an inspiration which
i shall strive to introduce into the
civic life of San Francisco and into
the entire state.1 never heard quite
so good a yell. Such a oneness. This
is what San Francisco needs. She
needs a unity of purpose, a little col
lege spirit, a little Stanford spirit to
pull her out of her present predica
ment. We must have team work.
In San Francisco there has been too
much star playing, too much of ex
hibition work. What we must do i>
rush through the center as a unit and
not make runs around the ends. 1
wish in the coming campaign of de
cency we could have the support of
Stanford students. We are going
back to old fashioned honesty. The
whole city,â€”the state, demands it.
Word has been passed from Wash
ington and the whole country is cry
ing for honesty.
"The 'Get there no matter how, as
long as you get there' policy is a per
verted proverb which is doing more
harm in the civic community than
anything else. " He concluded with
calling for enthusiasm in university
life and business life which he sum
med up as "When you have learned
to vitalize instead of upholster you
will meet success."
