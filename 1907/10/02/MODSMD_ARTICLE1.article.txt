# MAKE SPIRITED TALKS
## GREGORY AND MAGEE SPEAK IN ASSEMBLY. Prominent Business Men From San Francisco Deliver Addresses. Hawaiian Girls Sing. 
### 
The Student Body gathered at the
fourth hour this morning in Assembly
Hall to listen to what proved to be
two of the most interesting speakers
who have visited the Campus in
some time. Concise and entertaining
in their addresses. Warren Gregory
one of the best known of San Fran
cisco attorneys, and Thomas Magee.
president of the University Club of
San Francisco, and at present a mem
ber of the new board of supervisors,
won applause and favor from all pre
sent. The speeches of the occasion
were largely augmented by the pre
sence and singing of the group of
young Hawaiian ladies who are tour
ing the United States.
Warren Gregory was the first of
the visitors to address the Assembly,
and chose as his subject the experi
ence of a practical lawyer and the dif
ficulties attending the career of a
young attorney. That law was not an
exact science was the keynote of his
address, and in dealing with this top
ic he briefly outlined the cases of
paramount interest today to prove his
point. The San Francisco situation
and graft prosecution all over the
country was commented upon. The
"thirteenth juror" was how the speak
er spoke of public opinion, and in ad
dressing the students he cautioned
them to consider news as seen in
newspapers and to form their opinions
slowly as public opinion was a
mighty force.
In his address he said in part:
"Law is not an exact science. Any
judge or jury decision is at best un
certain. Therefore we must consider
wherein lies this uncertainty. Some
say it is in the judge, but I think it
is more due to the community and
the jury. This leads to the two ques
tions which enter into every case and
must lx reckoned with. First, the
facts which enter into the case. These
are the main questions and must be
considered first. Second, what is the
legal result? What has legal preced
ent prescribed? Public opinion is the
"thirteenth juror" and he sits on ev
ery jury. He is the foreman of every
jury and it is his vote which decides
every case. Even legal precedence
overruled by this, the "thirteenth
jrror." If the judge gives a decis
ion which is not right in the opinion
of the people, it bears 110 weight and
soon becomes a dead letter. I sup
pi se here at Palo Alto as in many
other places you have a bunch of or
dinances which make it a misdemean
or to do most anything which any
one would want to do. But these arc
dead letter ordinances.
Suppose for instance a farmer
should come to town and tie his
horse to a post so located that he
broke an ordinance. If he was ar
rested he would not be convicted and
this would be due to the "thirteenth
juror."
"Public opinion affects legal pro
cedure. thus we see this business of
