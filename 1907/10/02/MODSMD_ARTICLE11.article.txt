The unfortunate end of the search
for Chester Silent comes as a shock
to the Student Body who had hoped
that the missing student might be
found alive and well. We can but
once more assure the bereaved par
ents of our sympathy, and add that
Stanford men and women, who knew
him well, join in their sorrow for the
loss of so promising a son and stu
dent. The ties of comradeship are
strong here and we shall feel the ab
sence of a good friend and loyal
Stanford man.
