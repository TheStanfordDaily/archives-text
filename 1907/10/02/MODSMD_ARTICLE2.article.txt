# Body of Chester Silent Is Found in Felt Lake
## Autopsy Physicians Find That Student Met Death By Shooting-Coroner's Jury Now Investigating. 
### 
Chester Silent, who mysteriously disappeared from the Cam
pus twelve days ago, was found dead in Felt Lake, about four
miles from the University, this morning. .The physicians who held
an autopsy over the body late this afternoon, found that Silent met
his death not by drowning but by shooting, the whole top of the
head being blown away by a discharge of number 6 shot. Powder
marks on the face show that the muzzle of the gun was held with
in a foot of deceased's head when discharged . Watch and money
were found upon the body, disproving the theory of robbery.. Si
lent's shotgun is missing from the Delta Tau Delta house and the
lake is being dragged for the weapon.

The body of Chester Silent was
found by R. W. Harbaugh, '08, and
W. H. Hill, '08, at 11:30 this morning,
floating face downward in Felt Lake,
about five miles from the University.
The body was in complete attire and
gave evidence of having been in the
water for considerable time. When
found it was near the south bank pf
the lake at the edge of the thick tules
which surround the whole lake. The
boat, which is kept at the lake was
found floating at the opposite side.
The searchers had taken a boat and
oars with them and the body was
placed. in this without examination,
though a hasty examination by the
undertaker prior to removing the re
mains to Palo Alto for the inquest,
revealed the fact that the skull was
fractured.
Silent was in the habit of going to
Felt Lake on short shooting trips
and the fact that his gun is missing
from his room in the Delta Tau Del
ta house seems to point to the theory
that he had gone out alone on one of

these trips. Neither the gun nor Si
lent's hat have been found though
a thorough search was made around
the lake.
A party of searchers were at the
lake yesterday but failed to see the
body, either because af the obstruct
ing tules or that the body was still
under the surface of the water.
The coroner held an inquest ovet
the body this afternoon. Doctors
Williams and Wilbur, the autopsy
surgeons, testified that Silent met his
death from a gunshot wound. The
shot entered the face below the left
temple and ranged upward and back
ward .blowing the top of the skull
entirely off. Dr. Wilbur stated that
in his opinion Silent was shot and
then fell from the boat into the wa
ter. All his valuables, such as watch
and money, were found on the body,
thus lessening the probability of his
having met with foul play. At the
time the Daily Palo Alto went to
Press the jury had not reached its
decision.
