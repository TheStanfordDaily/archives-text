# EXHIBITS FUSING PROCESS.
## Use of Thermit Demonstrated By Manager of Goldschmit Co This Afternoon. 
### 
L. Heynemann, Pacific Coast man
ager and con-ulting engineer of the
Goldschmit Thermit Company, dem
onstrated this afternoon the applica
tion of Thermit in the fusion of lead,
copper, steel, and other metals. The
heat created by the use of Thermit is
5400 degrees and it requires from 20
to 50 seconds to heat.
Its practical application is in the
welding of joints of railroad tracks,
welding frames of locomotives with
out dismantling the locomotive, and
in marine repair work. Thermit, Hey
nemann explained, was not explosive
or inflammable, and demonstrated
this point. To ignite Thermit an ig
nition powder with crcatesa is used.
