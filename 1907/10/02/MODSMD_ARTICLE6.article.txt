### 
After the Sophomores had decisive
ly defeated the Seniors yesterday af
ternoon, two Freshman teams lined
up against each other for a single
half of twenty minutes. Despite the
changes in the tifteens the substitutes
again had the advantage, although
the final score resulted in a 3 to 3
tie. The first Freshman, handicapped
by the absence of Reed, who is 011
the Varsity squad, were kept con
stantly on the defensive until the last
few minutes of play, when they rush
ed the ball to the five-yard line. Tur
ner scored the try just as time was
called. The first-year men showed
more fight and spirit than they hith
erto have, but they still have much
to learn concerning the fundamental
principles of the game. With a single
exception they are lacking in individ
ual stars, but the squad has an abun
dance of fair material. Very rapid
progress will have to be made during
the next ten days if an average team
is to represent Stanford in the inter
collegiate Freshman game.
The 1911 players will meet the San
Jose High School fifteen at 4:45 to
morrow. on Stanford Field, and on

against the St. Marys team. Admis
sion to each game will be twenty-five
