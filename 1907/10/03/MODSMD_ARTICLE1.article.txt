Treasurer Board of Control.
At the last meeting of the Board
of Control, the treasurer handed in
his report for the last semester. The
members of the board have personal
notes outstanding to the amount of
about $1500, of which $027.92 was
paid to the Parkinson Company for
the moving of the bleachers.
The widening of Stanford Field
was provided for by the Executive
Committee last year, but there was
not sufficient funds in the treasury to
pay for the work and it was neces
sary for personal notes to be signed
in order that the field might be put
in condition for the present football
season.
There are also a few outstanding
notes, incurred by the old Training
House Corporation and assumed by
the present Board. Following is the
report of the treasurer of the Board
from February 6, 1907, to August 30,
