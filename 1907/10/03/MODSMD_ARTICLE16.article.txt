# U.C. Freshmen Defeat Santa Clara.
## 
### 
The California freshmen defeated
Santa Clara College in Rugby yester
day by the score of 29 to 8. The
Santa Clara team put up a better
game than the score would indicate,
but there was nothing remarkable in
either side of the contest. Roy Hunt,
one of the best players on the fresh
men team, broke his leg and will be
unable to play again this season.
