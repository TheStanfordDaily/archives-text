A party of men under the direction
o f Sheriff Langford are today drain
ing Felt Lake in an effort to find
the gun with which it is supposed
Chester Silent was killed. The party
made a thorough examination of the
locality around the lake this morning
and were unable to find any tracks,
cither on the bank or any place near
the shore. The only additional evi
dence which may throw any light on
the case is the discovery of stains,
closely resembling blood stains, in the
bottom of the boat which was drift
ing on the lake at the time the body
was found. These have been turned
over to Doctor R. E. Wilbur, who
will make a chemical test to deter
mine whether or not the stain is hu
man blood. The test requires a day
for its completion, so the result will
not be known before the inquest to
morrow afternoon. The draining of
the lake will require several days and
r is possible that the gun will not
be located before tomorrow after
noon. Those who arc assisting Sher
iff Langford in his search are: Coro
ner Kell, Deputy Sheriffs Buffington
and Mathcwson and Constable Grider.
The inquest held over the body yes
terday afternoon failed to develop
any new clue as to the manner in
which he met his death. The final
verdict of the coroner's jury has been
postponed until Friday afternoon at
2:00, in order to hear additional tes
timony from those conducting the
examination of the locality and from
the watchman at the lake.
The testimony of Doctors Williams
and Wilbur showed that Silent met
instant death as an cffect of the gun
shot wound in the head and that he
had probably been in the water since
the day of his disappearance. Sher
iff Langford made a thorough ex
amination of the place where the
body was found and the surrounding
lake hank and he expresed his opin
ion that it would be impossible to'
tell whether Silent was shot while in'
the boat or 011 the bank until the gun
was discovered. Owing to the high
winds of the last week the body
might easily have drifted from any
point on the lake.
The remains were shipped to San
Jose last evening, en route to Los
Angeles, where the burial will take
place.
