The announcement that George Hor
ton, head of the Consular Service of
the United States, will give a lecture
here next Friday afternoon will be
received with satisfaction by the Stu
dent Body. Stanford occupies such an
isolated position in the world of
amusements that any attractions oth
er than class plays and farces are as
welcome as they are unusual. It
seems as if there has been even more
than the usual dearth of outside at
tractions this semester and the rea
son for this is not exactly clear. The
Faculty Committee on Public Enter
tainments must remember the packed
houses on the nights of outside per
formances and need have no fear for
the financial end of such ventures.
The question of Student Body inter
est should give the committee no un
easiness for that has been proven in
former years. They have a clear field
in which to act and we should be
g'ateful if they took advantage of it.
