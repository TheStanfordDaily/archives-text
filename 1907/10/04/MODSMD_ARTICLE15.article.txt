Last Sunday morning a Sophomore
and a Junior were seen playing bil
liards in the Encina clubroom. This
lias long been against the traditions
Encina to use the billiard tables
on Sunday. And it certainly looks
as if a second year man, and most
certainly one who wears corduroys,
should be aware of this custom. And
it is all the more palpable a fault in
these Encina men when it is consid
ered that they have been members of
Encina Club ever since they began
college work. The Junior "drums up"
members for the Y. M. C. A. bible
class, an extra reason why he should
be careful. One of the same men was
overheard by me criticising a poor
Freshman last year for playing on the
tables, and that Freshman didn't ev
1 en live in the Hall.
Now it seems to me that this cus
! torn, which has existed so long as to
j be converted into a tradition, should
j continue to be observed by loyal En
! cina men, be they Seniors or Fresh-
I men, Sophomores or Juniors.
