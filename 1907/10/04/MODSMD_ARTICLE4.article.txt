# REACH NO CONCLUSION
## MANNER OF SILENT'S DEATH A MYSTERY. Additional Evidence Only Complicates the Case, and Coroner's Jury Returns Non-Committal Verdict. 
### 
The coroner's jury which investi
gated the death of Chester Silent,
this afternoon returned a verdict of
"death from a gunshot wound, how
inflicted we are unable to determine
from the evidence submitted." One
dissenting juror returned a verdict of
accidental shooting.
The evidence introduced at today's
session tended to add to the mystery
of the case, rather than to clear it
up and the uncertainty as to the real
facts resulted in the non-committal
verdict of the jury.
In the trial today it was brought
to light that Silent's mother had re
ceived a long-distance telephone mes
sage from him, she thinks on the day
he disappeared, telling her he in
tended to go to Berkeley on Saturday.
No record of such a message can be
found on the books of the telephone
company and as the condition of his
effects show that he intended to go
to San Jose and not to Berkeley, it
gives room for the theory that the
message may have been sent by
some outside person.
Doctor Wilbur testified that the
stains in the boat were those of hu
man blood which had been exposed
to the air for at least ten days and
that imbedded in the blood was a
brown human hair which he believed
resembled that of Silent. Sheriff Lang
fcrd testified to the finding of a shot
gun shell a short distance from the
lake but in his opinion it had not been
there as long a time as it is believed
Silent's body has been in the water.
No shells were found in the deceased
man's clothes nor has the gun, as yet,
been located. The water in the lake is
receding very slowly, and even if the
gun is in the lake, it will probably be
some time before it is located. Lang
ford's theory is that the shooting was
accidental while trying to push the
boat away from the shore with the
butt of the gun. This theory is not
substantiated, however, by the state
ment of Silent's associates that he had
often refused to go out in the boat
as he considered it dangerous.
