Freshmen will line up against a fif
teen from St. Marys College. The
first-year men have shown consider
able improvement during the last few

will be much stronger than the San

result. The game will be played on

will be an admission of twenty-five
cents.

line-up of the Castaways: Ward, Mc-
Grew, Mitchell, Walton, Evans, Deu
