# TO DECIDE PLACE FOR SHOW.
## Plug Ugly Committee May Determine To Hold Extravaganza At New Track. 
### 
The Plug Ugly to be given by the
Junior Class will probably be held
on the new track. President C. B.
Bradford of the Junior Class brought
the matter of holding the extravagan
za on Stanford Field or the new track
to the attention of the Executive
Committee. That body gave its con
sent to holding the show on the new
track, but said that it would be ne
cessary to consult Coaches Lanagan
and Presley as to the use of the field,
as the function would involve some
scarring of the turf.
Chairman Macomber has called a
meeting of the Plug Ugly committee
for 2 o'clock tomorrow at the Del
ta Gamma house. The place for
giving the show will probably be de
cided, and a choice may be made be
tween October 25 and November 1,
as the date for the Plug Ugly.
