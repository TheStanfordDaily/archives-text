to express our deep and profound sor
row in the "sad calamity which has ;
t ;ken so abruptly from our mids r i
Chester Silent, a man so well honored
by all who knew him for his uniform
courtesy and brilliant attainments.
And we wish to extend to the be
reaved and heartbroken parents, in
110 spirit of mere formality, our heart
felt and sincere sympathy in their
great sorrow. As they mourn a loy
al and devoted son, in whose record
they can feel nothing but pride, so
do we feel keenly the loss of a bril
liant student, a thorough gentleman
and one who was, in the truest sense
o? the word, a good Stanford man

The funeral services were held in
Los Angeles Saturday morning, and
were attended by several members of
the Delta Tan Delta fraternity, who
acted as pall bearers.
There haVe been no new clues de
veloped which help to solve the mys
tery of Chester Silent's death, though
Sheriff Langford and his men arc
still working on the case. The water
is still running out of Felt Lake, but
the water level is receding very slow
ly. No trace of the missing shot
gun has been found, and those work
ing on the case have about given up
hope of finding it unless the lake is
entirely drained.
