# Stanford Wins in South And On Home Grounds
## Varsity Is Victorious Over "Castaways" By a Score of 15 to 11--Freshmen Defeat St. Mary's. 
### 
The score read 15 to 11 when the
call of time ended tlie game between
the Varsity and the Castaways in
Los Angeles last Saturday afternoon.
Speed and fierceness characterized
the play, and condition was a promin
ent factor in the last half. The wear- J
crs of the Cardinal did not come up
tc their usual form, and only the goal
kicking of Kenton brought them vic
tory. Each team made three trie-,
but Kenton was successful in con
verting every time, while the South
erners only sent the ball over the
posts once. The opposing fifteen had
many brilliant individual stars but
were noticeably deficient in combina
ti m. Their condition, however, wa>
good. The Stanford forwards seem
e ! to lack their usual aggressiveness.*
while the backfield did not work to
gether with great success. Bat the
game proved very interesting as the
result was always in doubt.
Soon after the initial kick-off P.
hiiggins scored the first try for the
Castaways, and neither goal was
crossed again until just before the
end of the half, when Captain Koer
ncr carried the ball over the line from
a line-out on the 10-yard line. Ken
ton converting made it 5 to 3.
The Cardinal scored twice during
ihe first ten minutes of the next pe
riod. After the scrum had force 1
the pigskin to within 20 yards of the
goal, Reed received the ball from .
passing rush .and was not stopped
until he had planted it squarely be
tween the posts. Kollowing the kick
ofi came a 40-yard run by Vander
v< ort. When tackled he transferred
t< Crawford, who scored the third

Cardinal Victorious at Home.
Stanford field was the scene of
two Rugby games Saturday afternoon
The Kreshman lined up against Sr.
Marys, and the second Varsity faced
a fifteen from the University of the
Pacific. Both Cardinal teams were
victorious. Tll the first instance eight
points were made to the collegians'

nothing, while 16 to o was the final
score in the later case.
The Freshmen still show a discour
aging ignorance of the game, but tliev
did exhibit good lighting .spirit, and
tram work was evident for the first
time. They had the advantage of
1 laying against a fifteen that knew
less than they did about Rugby and
was, furthermore, in very poor con
dition. The 1911 men ran the St.
Marys players off their feet in the
stcond half, securing both their tries
ii that period. The work of the
Freshman pack was encouraging, and
St. John and Fletcher showed up
well in the backfield. F. Brown, at
full, kicked accurately
The two tries were scored by pass
ing rushes. Toward the middle of
the second half Garden secured from
the loose on St. Marys 20-yard line,
carrying the ball over the goal, and
a little later Caddagan made three
more points after St. John and Flet
cher had rushed the pigskin almost
half way down the field. Brown fail
ed to convert the first try, -but was
successful in the second attempt. St.
Marys protested the last try, alleging
that a forward pass had occurred
just before the ball was carried over
ti e line. The teams lined up as fol -
ic ws:
Freshmen—Woodville, Nolan, Dole
F\ans, Woodcock, Arnold, Carraher,
forwards; Towne, wing forward; Tur
ner, Wheeler, Taylor, half; Fletcher,
Garden, fives; Cline, center; St. John
Caddagan, wings; F. Brown full
Si. Marys—Cowells, Kidston, Smith,
Hughes, Du Fore, Sheehy, Hurlburt,
forwards; Mchern, wing forward; De
avila, half; Dunn, live; Sterrett,
O'Connell, McNeil, Feeney, three
quarters; Collins, full.
The game between the second Var
sity and the University of the Paci
fic was marred by the facl that th-;
visitors knew very little Rugby and
had to be constantly instructed in
its elementary points by Coach Lan
agan, who refereed. Consequently, it
was almost a walkover for the Stan
ford men. Two tries were scored in
each half, Little converting the first
two. Chandler managed to carry the
ball over the line twice, and Gay and
Shaner each scored once. At the
commencement of the last half, Coach
Lanagan substituted thirteen men in
the line-up of the second, but this
made little difference, for the nev
team showed up fully as well as the
original one.

score in the later case.
The Freshmen still show a discour
aging ignorance of the game, but tliev
did exhibit good lighting .spirit, and
tram work was evident for the first
time. They had the advantage of
1 laying against a fifteen that knew
less than they did about Rugby and
was, furthermore, in very poor con
dition. The 1911 men ran the St.
Marys players off their feet in the
stcond half, securing both their tries
ii that period. The work of the
Freshman pack was encouraging, and
St. John and Fletcher showed up
well in the backfield. F. Brown, at
full, kicked accurately
The two tries were scored by pass
ing rushes. Toward the middle of
the second half Garden secured from
the loose on St. Marys 20-yard line,
carrying the ball over the goal, and
a little later Caddagan made three
more points after St. John and Flet
cher had rushed the pigskin almost
half way down the field. Brown fail
ed to convert the first try, -but was
successful in the second attempt. St.
Marys protested the last try, alleging
that a forward pass had occurred
just before the ball was carried over
ti e line. The teams lined up as fol -
ic ws:
Freshmen—Woodville, Nolan, Dole
F\ans, Woodcock, Arnold, Carraher,
forwards; Towne, wing forward; Tur
ner, Wheeler, Taylor, half; Fletcher,
Garden, fives; Cline, center; St. John
Caddagan, wings; F. Brown full

Hughes, Du Fore, Sheehy, Hurlburt,
forwards; Mchern, wing forward; De
avila, half; Dunn, live; Sterrett,
O'Connell, McNeil, Feeney, three
quarters; Collins, full.
The game between the second Var
sity and the University of the Paci
fic was marred by the facl that th-;
visitors knew very little Rugby and
had to be constantly instructed in
its elementary points by Coach Lan
agan, who refereed. Consequently, it
was almost a walkover for the Stan
ford men. Two tries were scored in
each half, Little converting the first
two. Chandler managed to carry the
ball over the line twice, and Gay and
Shaner each scored once. At the
commencement of the last half, Coach
Lanagan substituted thirteen men in
the line-up of the second, but this
made little difference, for the nev
team showed up fully as well as the
original one.
