The postponed meeting of the
Board of Trustees was held in San
Francisco last Friday afternoon. A
petition from the students, presented
personally by Dr. Jordan, was sub
mitted. asking that the Board appro
priate a sufficient sum to cover the
cost of materials necessary to re
build the flume to Lagunita, on condi
tion that the students should furnish
the labor. The Board referred the
matter to the Finance Committee
with power to act, and furthermore
; uthorized Professor C. 1). Marx,
head of the Civil Engineering depart
ment, to investigate the project and
report whether it would be practic
able and of permanent value.
If the matter is passed upon favor
ably, the University will appropriate
enough money to pay for the mater
ials actually needed to rebuild the
flume, which is now utterly useless.
Dr. Jordan has announced his will
ingness to decree a holiday, and the
students will be asked to turn out an 1
do the work needed. The
lake will then be insured for at "least
ten years.
The annual appropriations for the
various departments were made by
the Trustees. Besides the amounts
assigned to the purchase of appar
atus and supplies, twenty-four thou
sand dollars was set aside for the pur
chase of books and periodicals for
the library.
C. A. Huston, Instructor in the de
partment of Law, was promoted to
an Asisstant Professorship. A large
number of students were made as
sistants. ' '..I-.
