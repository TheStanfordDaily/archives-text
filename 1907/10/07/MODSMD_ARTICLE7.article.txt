It hardly seems necessary to urge
that the Finance Committee act fav
orably in regard to the matter of
rebuilding Lagunita flume The ad
vantages which will accrue both to
the University authorities and the
students from such action are obvious
and need little explanation. Lake La
gunita, through long association, has
its own distinct place in Stanford life,
and what its loss would mean here
cannot be appreciated by anyone who
is not directly connected with the
University. The providing of both
labor and materials for the construc
tion work we recognize as too large
an undertaking for the authorities to
consider at present, but the "Labor
Day" idea appears to solve the dif
ficulty very satisfactorily. To the au
thorities it means that the flume may
be rebuilt with the expense of mater
ials alone; to the students it holds
out the possibility of filling the lake
again next semester. We feel safe in
assuring the members of the Finance
Committee that if the suggestion finds
favor with them, their efforts will re
ceive the hearty co-operation of the
Student Body.
