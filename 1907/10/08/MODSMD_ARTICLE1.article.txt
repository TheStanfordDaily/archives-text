# LAST PRELIMINARY GAME
## FRESHMEN WILL PLAY SANTA CLARA WEDNESDAY. First-Year Fifteen Shows Rapid Improvement in Team Work and Individual Playing. 
### 
On Stanford Field tomorrow after
noon the Freshmen will meet the fif
teen from Santa Clara College in
the final line-up preparatory to the
intercollegiate game with California
next Saturday. This should furnish
a good line on the comparative mer
its of the two Freshman teams, as
the Blue and Gold first-year men de
feated the collegians by a score of
29 to 8. The kick-off will take place
at 4:45, and an admission of twenty
five cents will be charged .
During the last few days the Car
dinal Freshmen have been showing
encouraging improvement in their
work. They are playing with more
sprit, and seem to be getting a clear
idea of many of the finer points of
Rugby. In a line-up yesterday the
second team was defeated in a hard
fought game, in which Reed and Flet
cher were easily the stars. Time was
colled when the ball was on the sub
stitutes' five-yard line, but Coach
Presley allowed the game to continue
for a few seconds, and the first fif
teen carried the pigskin over the goal,
making the final score 8 to 3. The
team lined up as follows: —Wood-
ville, Nolan, Dole, Evans, Woodcock,
Arnold, Vesel, forwards; Towne, wing
forward; Elliott, half; Carden, Flet
cher, fives; Cline, center; St. John,
Reed, wings; F. Brown, full.
Although nothing definite has been
settled as to the fifteen men who will
face California Saturday, it is prob
able that few changes will be mad:
during the week. The only notice
ably weak spot in the line-up yester
day was at half. Otherwise, the in
dividual and team play was of a high
o-der.
On Thursday the second 1011 fif
teen will meet the Palo Alto High
School.
