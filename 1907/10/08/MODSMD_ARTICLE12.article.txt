With the Freshman game four days
away Stanford undergraduates appear
to have but a feeble interest in the
outcome of their first clash with Cal
ifornia. The support afforded the 1911
fifteen throughout the season has
lacked the strength and enthusiasm
of former years, and has been charac
terized by an indifference which is
hard to understand. If the first year
men are to win Saturday they must
have the old sturdy and unwavering
spirit behind them, and the men on
the bleachers are as responsible as the
players themselves if that spirit is
lacking. It has always been our boast
that every man in the University is
behind the Cardinal teams. Wc need
all of this loyalty, so we ask that
every member of the Student Body
who can possibly make the trip, be
at the game Saturday, and be there
with the idea that the Stanford team
is to win.
