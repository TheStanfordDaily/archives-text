# NEW SYSTEM IS ADOPTED
## Method of Computing Student's Standing in Directory Is Changed.-Home Address Given. 
### 
To correct a wrong impression in
regard to the new Directory, the Reg
istrar's Office wishes to announce that
the change in the method of count
ing University hours was made mere
ly for convenience in printing. In
order to give the full name and the
home address of each student, it was
found impossible to print conditioned
hours. The new book indicates only
the number of hours actually count
ing toward the hundred and twenty
required for graduation.
Law majors who have made fifty
units in the University will be per
mitted to take up the professional
study of Law, regardless of any en
trance deficiencies which might re
duce the nominal number of hours
to their credit.
