## 
### 
The faculty committee on athletics
Dartmouth has declared ten mem
bers of last year's baseball team, in
cluding the captain, forever ineligible
to represent the college in a contest
of any kind. The reason given is that
:he men played on a semi-professional
team during the summer just past.
