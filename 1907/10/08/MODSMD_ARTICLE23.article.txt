# SILENT MYSTERY UNSOLVED
## Water in Felt Lake is Receding Very Slowly.â€”Missing Gun Not Yet Found. 
### 
As yet, no clue has been found that
would in any way clear up the mys
tery of Chester Silent's death. The
draining of Felt Lake by means of
iie outlet is proceeding so slowly that
at the present rate, it will be many
weeks before the water has receded
sufficiently to enable the Sheriff to
make a search of the bottom for the
missing gun.
Treasurer Lathrop has been asked
for permission to dynamite the dam
which would quickly empty the lake,
but stated that he had no authority
t' grant the necessary permit, such
iratters being under the control of
the Board of Trustees. Deputy Sher
iff Mulhall of San Jose was here to
day to investigate the feasibility of
using a syphon to drain the lake. He
left, however, without making any
definite plans to carry out his projcct.
Until some means is devised to re
move the water, the inquiry into the
i lystery must* necessarily remain at
a standstill.
