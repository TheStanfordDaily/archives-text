The iyoB men in the Engineering
departments made a good move when
they formulated plans for the build
ing of a Senior bench. Stanford has
but few of the customs and traditions
vhich mean so much in university
life, and any addition, provided it be
of the right kind, is most welcome.
It would seem that the example set
by the Engineers might be followed to
advantage by the Seniors in other de
partments.
