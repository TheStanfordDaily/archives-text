# No Trips For California Team.
## 
### 
The faculty of the University of
California has decided that the foot
bell team will not be allowed to take
any trips which will keep them away
from the university more than 24
hours. This prevents the team from
taking the trip which they usually
plan for the week previous to the
big game. It will also prevent the
California team from going to Van
couver to compete for the cup which
a Rugby enthusiast there has offered.
