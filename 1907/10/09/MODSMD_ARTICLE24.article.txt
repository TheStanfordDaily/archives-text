# TWO FAST RUGBY GAMES
## ENCOURAGING SHOWING OF FRESHMAN FIFTEEN. First-Year Players Defeat Substitutes, and Varsity Wins From Second Team. 
### 
At practice yesterday afternoon the
Varsity lined up against the second
team, winning by a score of 11 to o,
and the Freshmen defeated the 1911
substitutes 9 to o. The first was a
regular game of two halves, while
the second continued for only ten
minutes. The first-year line-up was
fast and very hard-fought, the play
ers showing to better advantage than
;my time heretofore this season. The
work of the forwards, as a whole, was
especially good, and the backfield
play of Reed and St. John was fine.
The personnel of the team was the
same as on the preceding day with
the exception that Turner was sub
stituted for Elliott at half. Minor in
juries kept Nolan and Fletcher out of
the scrum. The former's place was
acceptably filled by Rail.
The varsity game was noteworthy
because of the lack of scrums, not
more than half a dozen occurring
throughout the play. This made the
contest very fast and taxed the condi
tion of the men to the utmost. The
second team put up an exceptionally
good game and kept their opponents
from scoring in the first half, hut the
Varsity was much stronger in the sec
ond period, especially during the last
f< w minutes of play. The three tries
were secured by Fenton, Vandervoort
and Reynolds. Fenton converted one
of them, making the final score 1 r to
o.
