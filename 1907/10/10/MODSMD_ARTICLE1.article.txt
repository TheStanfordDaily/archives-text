to the high school men for a game
to be played 011 the Campus next
Thursday, October 17. This is the
only outside game so far scheduled,

several outside teams. Expenses ot

the Stanford aggregation may con
tribute a small amount toward a guar
antee, hut expenses can probably be
covered by the charge of a nominal
admission fee to the game.

received a letter from J. R. Ilickey,
ex-'OB, in which Mickey offers to use
his good offices to secure the admis
sion of the Stanford squad into the

San Francisco. The admission of the
Stanford nine into the league can be
accomplished by Mickey if the Car
