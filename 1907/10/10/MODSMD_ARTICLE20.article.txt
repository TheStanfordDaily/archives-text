# California Oarsmen Work in Tank
## 
### 
The new rowing tank at California
is now ready for use, and the men
who have signed up for fall training
are working in it regularly. The tank
is circular, and about 60 feet in diam
eter, with two pontoons about the
size of shells tied in it opposite each
other.
