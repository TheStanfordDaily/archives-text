# INTERCOLLEGIATE FRESHMAN GAME TOMORROW
## Contest With California Will Be Hard Fought Struggle. Coaches Are Not Optimistic. 
### 
The fourteenth annual Intercolleg
iate Freshman game between the
Cardinal and the Blue and Gold will
he played tomorrow afternoon on Cal
ifornia Field. Promptly at 2:30 the
shrill sound of Referee Jenkinson's
whistle will announce the initial kick
off in the battle which will decide

the Rugby supremacy of the 1911
classes of the two universities. By
winning from the California Fresh
men, the Stanford team will achievc
the first victory since Kenton cap
tained the 1908 eleven to success
three years ago. The men who will
fight for the Cardinal will go into the
game thoroughly coached and well
conditioned. The backs have been
trained by Lanagan, and Presley has
carefully supervised the work of the

forwards, while Trainer Moulton has
kept a watchful eye on their physical
condition. During the past ten days
the team, as a whole, has been whip
ped into shape by Presley, who has
succeeded in developing good combin
ation in their play and in instilling
in the men a spirit of continual fight.
The only comparative scores that
furnish a line 011 the respective merits
of the contesting teams are discour
aging to the Cardinal. The Califor
nia freshmen triumphed over Santa
Clara 29 to 8, while ten days after
wards the latter fifteen defeated Stan
ford's first-year men 11 to 6. It must
be remembered, however, that the
Santa Clara team rapidly improved
between the two games. The chances
of the Cardinal were tersely summed
up by Coach Presley, who said: "The
team is up against a mighty hard pro
position and the men will have to
tight as hard as they possibly can to
win."
Dad Moulton anticipates a close,
h.'.rd-fought contest. In speaking of
the team, he said: "The Freshmen
arc in as good condition as can be
expected when it is considered that
they haven't had the advantage of a
training table. The team stands a
good chance of winning from the
California freshmen and will put up
a hard fight. It's a better team than
i is given credit for being."
Arrangements for Team and Rooters.
The Freshman team will leave Palo
Alto 011 the 9:31 train tomorrow
morning and will go direct to Berk
eley, where thej r will take lunch. The
fifteen will be accompanied by Coach
es Lanagan and Presley, Trainer
Moulton, Manager Knupp, and
the University Band.
The Stanford rooters will be locat
ed on the western side of the field,
which is by far the most desirable.
The Southern Pacific has made a
rc-tind trip rate of $i.to, and tickets
sold at this rate will be good up to
and including Monday. No special
trains will be run.
Officials—Referee, T. Jenkinson, of
