### 
Before a large and enthusiastic au

Consul-General George Horton deliv

the "Greeks of Today." His lecturc
was illustrated with one hundred ster
eopticon views of Greece, many of
them being photographs of the build
ings and people of modern Athens.
General Horton spoke of the pres
ent condition of the Greek race and
said that Greece was now undergo
ing a political and commercial Ren
aissance. New schools and colleges
are being founded, commerce is grow
ing and the whole aspect of the conn
try is that of a flourishing nation.
