# CARDINAL IS REPRESENTED BY AGGRESSIVE PLAYERS
## 
### 
W. D. Fletcher, the captain and
i five-eighths, is one of the few players
| that has been assured of a place on
the team since the season commenc
ed. lie is fast and aggressive, as well
as a good passer. He is very cool
and may he relied on to get a back
litld rush started, once the hall is
transferred from the half. He is a sure
i tackier and will be a hard man to
[ pass on defense. Fletchcr has the
j entire confidence of his men and will
undoubtedly prove a fine captain. He
j registers from Palo Alto in the dc
i pnrtment of Geology and Mining.
The full, F. C. Brown, earned his
position principally through his ac
curate kicking. He is reliable at find
ing touch, usually getting good dis
tance in his punts for the side lines.
During the first few weeks of prac
tice Brown was weak on the defense,
but he rapidly overcame this deficien
cy and has developed into a first
class tackier. He is an Electrical En
gineering major from Sclma.
II. E. Reed, of Portland, is easily
the best all-round player on the fif
teen. Coupled with speed and abil
ity to dodge cleverly, he has learned
the game thoroughly and always uses
liis head. Tf once he succeeds in get
! ting way, he will be almost impossi
ble to stop. Reed is also a relia
ble defense player. He also majors
in the department of Electrical Engi
neering.
The other wing is ably cared for
by R. U. St. John, a Civil Engineer
ing major from Bcnicia. Although
small and light, he is speedy and al
ways fighting. He is an accurate
passer and a good tackier.
W. IT. Cline, J., of Los Angeles,
will be the center three-quarter. lie
is very fast and knows the game well,
making with Reed a dangerous pair.
Cline is weak on the defense and
has a tendency not to fight at times.
He registers in Economics.
L. L. Carden, at five, is an aggres
sive player and fairly speedy. His
head work is not of the best, however,
and he is a poor tackier. He passes
well. Carden registers from Santa
Ana in the department of Economics.
At half will be T. N. Turner, a
Geology and Mining major from
I Needles. Turner is sure in getting the
ball out of the scrum and a quick,
accurate passer. I lis worst fault is
a tendency to lose liis head at cru
cial points.
G. li. Towne, at wing forward, far
surpasses any of the other contest
; ;mts for the place. He is especially
; well suited to the position. Me is very
j heady and follows the pack well.
J Towne is an Economics major from
i Palo Alto.
The front rank men, R, \\ oodville
and E. D Nolan, are a pair of scrap
py players They are line hookers and
work well together. They both lack
in weight, but make up for this in
the matter of aggressiveness. No
lan is a Geology and Mining major
i from San Luis Obispo, while Wood
; ville registers from Bay City in the
j Law department.
K. L. Dole, of Riverside, has long
been considered a surety at lock. Mc
j is heavy and powerful, and always in
' t:hc game. He is deficient in speed
1 only. Dole majors in Botany.
The most reliable man in the scrum
i:; C. B. Evans ,a Civil Engineering
major from Palo Alto. Me has weight
and aggressiveness and follows the
ball well. He has a good under
standing of the requirements of a
forward, and this is somewhat lack
ing in the scrum as a whole.
E. C. Woodcock, of Portland, will
play the other side rank position.
At the beginning of the season his
work was rather unsatisfactory, but
he has developed into a good, steady
man and will put up a hard fight on
Saturday. He registers in Electrical
Engineering.
J. A. Visel, of Santa Ana. will be
the sixth man in the scrum. He is
a heavy, aggressive player, and a
hard lighter. Arnold and lie make
a strong pair in the rear rank. Visel
is an Economics major.
M. R. Arnold registers from Susan
ville in Law. He is a valuable addi
tion to the pack, possessing both

weight and speed. A v nold never stops
fighting from the first kick-off until
the call of time.
There will be five substitutes 011
the field tomorrow, three forwards
and two backs. B. L. Ball, of Los
Angeles, J. N. Blood, of San Francis
co, and M. IV Carraher, of Seattle,
will replace any of the scrum men
who may be injured, while J. E. El
liott, of Pacific Grove, and R. B.
W heeler, of Pasadena, will substitute
for the backs.
