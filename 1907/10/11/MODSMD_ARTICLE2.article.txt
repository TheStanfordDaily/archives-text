# CARDINAL IS REPRESENTED BY AGGRESSIVE PLAYERS
## 
### 
W. D. Fletcher, the captain and
i five-eighths, is one of the few players
| that has been assured of a place on
the team since the season commenc
ed. lie is fast and aggressive, as well
as a good passer. He is very cool
and may he relied on to get a back
litld rush started, once the hall is
transferred from the half. He is a sure
i tackier and will be a hard man to
[ pass on defense. Fletchcr has the
j entire confidence of his men and will
undoubtedly prove a fine captain. He
j registers from Palo Alto in the dc
i pnrtment of Geology and Mining.
The full, F. C. Brown, earned his
position principally through his ac
curate kicking. He is reliable at find
ing touch, usually getting good dis
tance in his punts for the side lines.
During the first few weeks of prac

but he rapidly overcame this deficien

class tackier. He is an Electrical En

II. E. Reed, of Portland, is easily
the best all-round player on the fif
teen. Coupled with speed and abil

in the department of Electrical Engi
neering.
The other wing is ably cared for
by R. U. St. John, a Civil Engineer
ing major from Bcnicia. Although
small and light, he is speedy and al
ways fighting. He is an accurate
passer and a good tackier.
W. IT. Cline, J., of Los Angeles,
will be the center three-quarter. lie
is very fast and knows the game well,
making with Reed a dangerous pair.
Cline is weak on the defense and
has a tendency not to fight at times.
He registers in Economics.
L. L. Carden, at five, is an aggres
sive player and fairly speedy. His
head work is not of the best, however,
and he is a poor tackier. He passes
well. Carden registers from Santa
Ana in the department of Economics.
At half will be T. N. Turner, a
Geology and Mining major from
I Needles. Turner is sure in getting the
