# STUDENTS HEAR DR. LEAVITT.
## Interesting Sermon Delivered In the Chapel.â€”Mrs. Blanchard Renders Solos. 
### 
Reverend Bradford Leavitt, of the
First Unitarian Church of San Fran
cisco, spoke on "The Law and the
Prophets" at the morning service in
the Chapel yesterday. He traced the
Mosaic laws from the time of Exo
dus to the time of Christ, and said
that today lawyers recognized the
laws of the Bible as superior to those
of the codes.
For the most part Dr. Leavitt's
sermon was academic, but San Fran
cisco was mentioned in regard to po
litical parties which he alluded to as
effeminate.
Mrs. Blanchard, the famous contral
to of San Francisco, was the soloist,
and rendered two numbers, "But the
Lord is Mindful of His Own," ora
torio, St. Paul and Mendelssohn.
