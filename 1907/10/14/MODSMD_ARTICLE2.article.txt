## Freshmen Receive Strong Support From Bleachers.â€”The Band Plays Well. 
### 
The rooting at the Freshman game
on Saturday was generally regarded
as superior to that of any previous
Freshman contest, and although con
siderably outnumbered by the wearers
of the Blue and Gold, the Stanford
rooters were easily equal to their ri
vals. A most notable feature of the
Stanford rooting was the determined
manner in which the players were
cheered and encouraged right up to
the time the final whistle blew. Af
ter the game was over and the Cal
itornians had taken possession of the
field for the victorious serpentine, the
Stanford rooters stood up and cheer
ed fully fifteen minutes for the plucky
team that had . put up a great fight
against heavy odds.
The demonstration given the team
when it appeared on the field to start
the game was one of the greatest
ever heard. In addition to the unu
sually good singing and rooting the
band was of great value in adding
to the effectiveness of the Stanford
rooting section. Throughout the
game the rooters supported the team
well and the yell-leaders were par
ticularly efficient. The spirit of fair
ness and sportsmanlike conduct that
was a feature of the game was re
flected by both rooting sections in
the frequent cheering for rival players.
