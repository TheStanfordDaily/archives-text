### 
From the Coaches.
We were outclassed at every point. Our Freshmen fcut up a game
fight and far exceeded all expectations, but they were simply up
against a much better team and stood absolutely no chance.—Coach
Lanagan. » . v v j
The Cardinal Freshmen were outclassed. The Stanford men play
ed absolutely the best game they were capable of, and they fought
all the way.. They were up against a much better team and conse
quently have nothing to be ashamed of.—Coach Presley.

Outclassed and outplayed, but fight
ing gamely from start to finish, the
Stanford Freshman team went down
to defeat at the hands of California's
first-year fifteen in the Intercolleg
iate Rugby game at Berkeley lasi
Saturday. Four tries, two of which
were converted, and a goal from
placement gave the Blue and Gold
'i total of nineteen points, while the
Cardinal was unable to score. The
result was not a source of any great
surprise. The playing of the losers
far exceeded all expectations, but
they had no chance against the com
bination and individual work of the
heavy Californians, whose superior
knowledge of Rugby gave them a de
cided advantage over their opponents.
Material was lacking for the Stanford
team, and no amount of practice could
have turned out a victorious fifteen.
During the first few minutes of
play the Blue and Gold rushed the
ball at will, but the players soon re
covered from their attack of stage
flight, and from then until the final
call of time, although hopelessly beat
en, they never stopped fighting. Six
teen of California's nineteen points
were scored in the first half, the stub
born resistance of the defeated men
holding their opponents down to a
single tr>' in the second period.
The playing of Brown, at full,
stands out as particularly brilliant.
Time and again he stopped the fierce
onslaughts of the Blue and Gold pack,
finding touch with unfailing accuracy.
St. John and Cline proved invaluable
to the Cardinal on the defensive,
tackling hard and fearlessly. Togetli
er with Reed, they had little chancc
in offensive work, as the ball seldom
ri ached them before the rush wa-;
interfered with by the opposing three
quarters. The five-eighths were also
unsuccessful in advancing the pigskin,
but in the second half Captain Flet
cher effectually checked much of the
ground gaining of the California
backs.
Although outplayed and constantly
Ir'ndercd by Hatch, captain and half
of the Blue and Gold team, Turner
fought hard and successfully blocked
many dribbling rushes. Towne, at
wing forward, and Dole, were always
in the midst of the play. The front
rank men hooked almost as well as
their opponents, but the pack, as i
whole, was weak in folowing the ball.
The forwards had a difficult time

standing up against the superior
weight of the California scrum. In
the Stanford line-up Ball replaced No
lan at half time.
I 4 or the Blue and Gold the playing
or Dvviggins, Hatch, Renouf and Jor
dan stands out prominently. Dvvig
gins possesses great speed, and his
dodging runs were a feature of the
day. Captain Hatch played an ex
tremely heady game, while the kick
ing of Renouf gained many yards.
T'is goal from placement netted his
team three • points. The weight ani
aggressiveness of Jordan made him a
dangerous man in the scrum.
From a spectacular point of view
the game was one of the hest ever
seen on the Coast. The many success
ful passing rushes of the California
l.ackfield roused the enthusiasm of
the assemblage to a high pitch, while
the few dribbling rushes added to the
e> citement. There was plenty of kick
ing, and the game was not marred
by an excessive number of scrums.
'I he work of Referee Jenkinson gave
emihent satisfaction to all.
Detail of the Play.
Stanford won the toss and chose to
dciend the southern goal. Renouf
kicked off for California, and Dwig
gins, Hatch and Solinsky soon rush
ed to the Cardinal s*yard line, where
Brown secured and punted out of
danger. Cline carried the ball to
touch in the center of the field. From
the line-out Dwiggins made a spec
t: cular run of thirty yards, and when
tackled he transferred to Swartz who
c; sily registered the first try of the
game. Renouf converted, and the
s;ore was 5 to o.
Several uninteresting scrums fol
lowed the kick-off. and finally a ruck
was formed on the .Cardinal's twenty
y.ird line. Hatch securing passed to
Stetson, who in turn handed to Jor
dan, and he crossed the line for the
second try, Renouf again converting.
Then came Stanford's best chance
to score. Play settled near Califor
nia's goal, and here an offside play
gave Reed an opportunity for a free
place-kick at a difficult angle from the
tventy-five-yard line. The ball fell
short. Several good punts brought
the pigskin rapidly down the field
and soon Solinsky dashed over the
line for another try, which Renouf
failed to convert into a goal.
After the drop-out the play was
near the Stanford line, and California
was given a free kick because a Car
dinal player held the ball. Renouf
made an easy goal, and the score
was 16 to o. From then until the call
of time the pigskin remained near the
center of the field.
Brown's kick-off started the second
half, and a punting duel followed. The
Stanford full-back finally found touch
c: the Blue and Gold's twenty-five
\ trd line, and then came the most
spectacular run of the day. From
the line-out Dwiggins secured and
covered half the length of the field
before he was forced to pass to Hatch
who was tackled just before crossing
the line. Brown kicked out of dan
ger, and then came a succession of
punts. Finally a line-out resulted on
California's forty-five-yard line, but t
diibbling rush quickly carried the bah
close to the Cardinal's goal, an.l
Montgomery carried over. Renout
failed to convert.
During the remaining minutes of
play Stanford's goal was continually
threatened. On several occasions on
1/ the remarkable playing of Brown
saved another score, and three times
In was forced to touch down. The
call of time found the ball near the
center of the field. Final score —10
to o.

or Dvviggins, Hatch, Renouf and Jor

gins possesses great speed, and his
dodging runs were a feature of the
day. Captain Hatch played an ex

ing of Renouf gained many yards.
T'is goal from placement netted his
team three • points. The weight ani
aggressiveness of Jordan made him a
dangerous man in the scrum.
From a spectacular point of view
the game was one of the hest ever

ful passing rushes of the California
l.ackfield roused the enthusiasm of
the assemblage to a high pitch, while

e> citement. There was plenty of kick
ing, and the game was not marred
by an excessive number of scrums.
'I he work of Referee Jenkinson gave
emihent satisfaction to all.
Detail of the Play.
Stanford won the toss and chose to
dciend the southern goal. Renouf
kicked off for California, and Dwig
gins, Hatch and Solinsky soon rush
ed to the Cardinal s*yard line, where
Brown secured and punted out of
danger. Cline carried the ball to
touch in the center of the field. From
the line-out Dwiggins made a spec
t: cular run of thirty yards, and when
tackled he transferred to Swartz who
c; sily registered the first try of the
game. Renouf converted, and the
s;ore was 5 to o.
Several uninteresting scrums fol
lowed the kick-off. and finally a ruck
was formed on the .Cardinal's twenty
y.ird line. Hatch securing passed to
Stetson, who in turn handed to Jor
dan, and he crossed the line for the
second try, Renouf again converting.
Then came Stanford's best chance
to score. Play settled near Califor
nia's goal, and here an offside play
gave Reed an opportunity for a free
place-kick at a difficult angle from the
tventy-five-yard line. The ball fell
short. Several good punts brought
the pigskin rapidly down the field
and soon Solinsky dashed over the
line for another try, which Renouf
failed to convert into a goal.
After the drop-out the play was
near the Stanford line, and California
was given a free kick because a Car
dinal player held the ball. Renouf
made an easy goal, and the score
was 16 to o. From then until the call
of time the pigskin remained near the
center of the field.
Brown's kick-off started the second
half, and a punting duel followed. The
Stanford full-back finally found touch
c: the Blue and Gold's twenty-five
\ trd line, and then came the most
spectacular run of the day. From
the line-out Dwiggins secured and
covered half the length of the field
before he was forced to pass to Hatch
who was tackled just before crossing
the line. Brown kicked out of dan
ger, and then came a succession of
punts. Finally a line-out resulted on
California's forty-five-yard line, but t
diibbling rush quickly carried the bah
close to the Cardinal's goal, an.l
Montgomery carried over. Renout
failed to convert.
During the remaining minutes of
play Stanford's goal was continually
threatened. On several occasions on
1/ the remarkable playing of Brown
saved another score, and three times
In was forced to touch down. The
call of time found the ball near the
center of the field. Final score —10

From the Coaches.
We were outclassed at every point. Our Freshmen fcut up a game
fight and far exceeded all expectations, but they were simply up
against a much better team and stood absolutely no chance.—Coach
Lanagan. » . v v j
The Cardinal Freshmen were outclassed. The Stanford men play
ed absolutely the best game they were capable of, and they fought
all the way.. They were up against a much better team and conse
quently have nothing to be ashamed of.—Coach Presley.

Outclassed and outplayed, but fight
ing gamely from start to finish, the
Stanford Freshman team went down
to defeat at the hands of California's
first-year fifteen in the Intercolleg
iate Rugby game at Berkeley lasi
Saturday. Four tries, two of which
were converted, and a goal from
placement gave the Blue and Gold
'i total of nineteen points, while the
Cardinal was unable to score. The
result was not a source of any great
surprise. The playing of the losers
far exceeded all expectations, but
they had no chance against the com
bination and individual work of the
heavy Californians, whose superior
knowledge of Rugby gave them a de
cided advantage over their opponents.
Material was lacking for the Stanford
team, and no amount of practice could
have turned out a victorious fifteen.
During the first few minutes of
play the Blue and Gold rushed the
ball at will, but the players soon re
covered from their attack of stage
flight, and from then until the final
call of time, although hopelessly beat
en, they never stopped fighting. Six
teen of California's nineteen points
were scored in the first half, the stub
born resistance of the defeated men
holding their opponents down to a
single tr>' in the second period.
The playing of Brown, at full,
stands out as particularly brilliant.
Time and again he stopped the fierce
onslaughts of the Blue and Gold pack,
finding touch with unfailing accuracy.
St. John and Cline proved invaluable
to the Cardinal on the defensive,
tackling hard and fearlessly. Togetli
er with Reed, they had little chancc
in offensive work, as the ball seldom
ri ached them before the rush wa-;
interfered with by the opposing three
quarters. The five-eighths were also
unsuccessful in advancing the pigskin,
but in the second half Captain Flet
cher effectually checked much of the
ground gaining of the California
backs.
Although outplayed and constantly
Ir'ndercd by Hatch, captain and half
of the Blue and Gold team, Turner
fought hard and successfully blocked
many dribbling rushes. Towne, at
wing forward, and Dole, were always
in the midst of the play. The front
rank men hooked almost as well as
their opponents, but the pack, as i
whole, was weak in folowing the ball.
The forwards had a difficult time

standing up against the superior
weight of the California scrum. In
