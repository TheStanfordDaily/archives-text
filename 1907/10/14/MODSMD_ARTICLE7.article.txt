Stanford has nothing but praise for |
the gritty little team which went down j
to defeat on California Field last Sat
urday. Handicapped by the short time ■
in which they have played an entire- ;
\y- new game, and outweighed in all '
positions, the Freshmen disputed cv- j
ery.inch.of ground and never stop
ped lighting until the final whistle j
announced the end of the battle. Es- •
pecially during the second half was j
the, defense of the most desperate
kind and the fact that but three points
were added to the score in that per- I
iod speaks well for the way the 1911 !
team fought their heavier and more I
experienced opponents in the face !

Taken in another light Saturday's 1
game may well act as a damper up
on y feeling, of overconlidence in |
regard to the v.arsity game. With a
10 0. score fresh in our. minds we I
should'begin to realize what Stanford j
players 'and coaches ' have always!
known—that California plays a fa.sU
heady game of Rugby and that victory
can only come as "the result
hardest kind of work and the best j
support.'
