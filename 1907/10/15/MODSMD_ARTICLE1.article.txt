# CONFERENCE IS HELD
## PROFESSOR DURAND MEETS FRATERNITY MEN. Important Matters Relating To College Community Are Discussed And Action Taken. 
### 
A meeting of the representatives
of the fraternities was held at the
residence of Professor W. F. Durand
last evening in which matters per
taining to the general welfare of the
college community were discussed.
Regarding the observance of the
1 - o'clock rule for the closing of fra
ternity dances, it was the unanimous
opinion that such rule might be eas
ily carried out. provided the dance
could begin more promptly than has
come to be the custom in recent
years. Furthermore, in order to make
such .purpose effective it was unan
imously voted that the understanding
in the future should be that the
hour mentioned on invitations to
such events should refer to the time
at which the guest is expected to be
ready to leave her house, and that
the chairman of the Committee on
Student Affairs should undertake to
bring this understanding to the at
tention of the women of the Uni
versity and to invoke their co-opera
tion in the matter. In furtherance
of this purpose the Chairman of the
Committee will communicate with
the sororities and women's clubs of
the University.
Professor Durand expressed him
self as being very much pleased at
the noticeable decrease in the num
ber of complaints received during
the past year.
Conferences will be held each year,
and will continue until the matters
decided upon are so impressed upon
the community that, they will become
traditional and will be obeyed ac
cordingly.
The meeting was attended by good
feeling in every respect and all mat
ters were discussed in a very open
light. Professor V. L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department and Assist
ant Professor B. O. Foster of the
Latin department were present as
members of the Student Affairs Com
mittee.
In closing the Conference, Profes
sor Durand assured the members of
the high appreciation in which he
held the frank and generous man
ner in which the students had en
tered into the spirit and purposes of
the Committee in its endeavor to
maintain and improve Ihe existing
high level of community welfare.
