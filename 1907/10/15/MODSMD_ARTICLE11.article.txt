# Daily Californian Facing Crisis.
## 
### 
The Daily Californian, which is pub
-1 bed hv the students of the State
University, is facing a financial cri
sis. Some years ago the mismanage
ment or dishonesty of a manager put
debt of $800 on the paper, which
succeeding managers have never been
able to lift. Not long ago an appeal
was made to the students, but only
$45 was raised. Tt is announced that
unless the deficit is made up at once,
publication will be suspended.
