One of the encouraging features
of the Intercollegiate game with Cal
ifornia last Saturday was the strong
support given the Cardinal fifteen by
the Stanford bleachers. The rooters
were behind the team every minute
and stayed with them until the last
play was made. The yelling and sing
ing were of unusual volume and
although outnumbered, the Stanford
men easily held their own with the
Blue and Gold supporters. There
should also be a special word of com
mendation for the University Band,
whose playing at the game added
a great deal to the efforts of the
Cardinal rooters.
