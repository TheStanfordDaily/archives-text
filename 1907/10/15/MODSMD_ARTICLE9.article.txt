# Prof. Whitaker Dismisses Student.
## 
### 
A. L. Johnson. '09, was dismissed
from the class in Corporations and
Trusts this morning by Professor A.
C Whitaker, for quoting in the San
Francisco Examfner statements
made by Professor Whitaker in class.
Professor Whitaker takes the stand
that his statements were not for pub
lication. He did not approve of the
first, report sent by Johnson, stating
that if the act was repeated John
son would be dismissed. The of
fense was repeated Friday and as a
result Johnson was dropped from the
class roll.
