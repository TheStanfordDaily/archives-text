# MAY SEND REPRESENTATIVE.
## Pacific Athletic Association Asks That Member of Stanford Faculty Be Appointed. 
### 
President Sidney Peixotto of the
Pacific Athletic Association has asked
Stanford to appoint a member
ber of the Faculty to membership on
the board of governors of the associ
ation. The advisability of complying
with the request is now being con
sidered by the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee which disposes of all such
matters.
The University of California is al
ready represented on the board by
Professor Crawford. In speaking of
the possibility of Stanford sending
a representative to the board, Dr.
Angell, chairman of the Faculty
Committee, said today: "The diffi
culty of having a Stanford represen
tative on the P. A. A. Board of Gov
ernors lies in the time and place of
the meetings. It would also be hard
to keep in touch with all the affairs
of the Association."
