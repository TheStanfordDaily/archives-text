# Communication.

### 
The statement was made in last
night's '"Daily" that "Professor
Whitaker did not approve of the first
report sent by Johnson, stating that
if the act was repeated Johnson
would be dismissed." I wish to say
on my own behalf that such state
ment was not made to me nor was
this statement ever communicated to
me.
A. LAURENCE JOHNSON, '09.
