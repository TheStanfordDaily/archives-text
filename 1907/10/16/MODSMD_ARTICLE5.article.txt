# TRIBUTE TO SCIENTISTS
## AGASSIZ AND LINNAEUS ARE PRAISED BY JORDAN. Anniversary of Academicians Observed by Interesting Student Body Assembly. 
### 
The anniversaries of the great sci
entists Linnaeus and Agassiz were
observed today at the Assembly held
at the third hour. Dr. Jordan was
the speaker and dealt exclusively
with the life and works of the two
i men whose birthdays were the oc
| casiou for the gathering. The As
| sembly was academic in nature but
j was replete with interest as Dr. Jor
dan was personally acquainted with
Dr. Agassiz, having studied under
the scientist in this country and
visited his laboratories and work
shops while in Europe.
The details of the life of Agassiz
were very interestingly narrated.
He first spoke of the prominence
Linnaeus occupied in the field of
scientific research. According to
the speaker Linnaeus was one of the
first of natural scientists audit was
directly due to him that the pres
ent method of classifying plants and
animals was established.
"This is as far as anniversaries
art* concerned a red letter year
among the great scientists. This
year is the 100 th anniversary of the
birth of Agassiz and the 200 th
anniversay of Archedi and Lin
naeus," said Dr. Jordan. "Lin
naeus was the first to take up the
study of botany on a large scale.
He was the first to discover that
every region has different plants
and to classify them. He traveled
extensively in Sweden, Norway and
Finland. By his classification and
method of naming plants he made
scientific bookkeeping possible."
Of the life of Archedi Dr. Jordan
spoke briefly. In his short, life this
scientist succeeded in gathering such
valuable information that the sci
ence of Archaeology has borne his
name ever since.
In speaking of Agassiz Dr. Jordan
said, "I loved this teacher of mine
as much as it is given a little man to
lr.ve a great, man." The life of the
scientist up to the time he entered
into the sphere of individual search
and teaching was treated but lightly
by Dr. Jordan. His career at the
University of Munich was referred
to as noteworthy inasmuch as many
important theories were advanced
while Agassiz was yet a student.
His greatest work was, in the opin
ion of Dr. Jordan, his determination
01' the extent and movement of gla
ciers.
The teachings of Agassiz at his
summer school at Penikese Island
were dwelt upon at length by Dr.
Jordan, who was a pupil at this fa
mous school. The main feature of
fthis school was that Agjassiz ap
pealed to his students to act as dis
ciples and taught that the true
way to study nature was not by
book lore but by personal observa
tion.
