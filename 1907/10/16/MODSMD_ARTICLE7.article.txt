# CHANGE IN DANCE PLANS.
## Sophomores Decide To Dispense With Supper and Reduce the Price of Tickets. 
### 
At a special meeting this noon,
tlie Sophomore Class reconsidered
its action of yesterday in regard to
plans tor the class dance and decid
erl to dispense with the supper and
reduce the price of the tickets to
two dollars and fifty cents. This
course was necessitated by the ac
tion of Encina Club last night, when
it was decided to withhold the per
mission to use an Encina dance date
until the class had reconsidered the
decision of yesterday.
The action 01 the club came as tae
result of a sentiment among upper
classmen in Encina against the
Sophomore dance being an attempt
to rival the elaborate upperclass
functions. The men feel that the
affair should not be so expensive
that any one who would go to the
Encina dance could not afford to
attend.
After considerable discussion as
to the advisability of giving a for
mal or informal dance, it was de
cided by a considerable majority to
give the cotillion as originally plan
ned.
