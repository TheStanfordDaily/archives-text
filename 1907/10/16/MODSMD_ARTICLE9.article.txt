One of the greatest privileges
Stanford men and women formerly
enjoyed was that of attending the
daily organ recitals given in Mem
orial Church. After the earthquake
the services of the organist were dis
pensed with and no move has been
made since that time toward the
re-establishment of the old custom.
Yet the organ itself is uninjured and
as fine an instrument as it was be
fore the calamity. The Memorial
Church is severely wrecked, but it
would be very possible to arrange
temporary quarters inside for the
accommodation' of a small audience.
The construction of such quarters
would mean a slight expenditure
well made. As the situation now
stands the University occupies a po
sition of absolute indifference in re
gard to such matters and appears
to be solicitous only that we have
drilled into us a specific amount of
technical or academic training.
