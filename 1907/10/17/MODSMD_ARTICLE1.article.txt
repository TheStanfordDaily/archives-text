# WILL DISCUSS BASEBALL
## INTERFRATERNITY LEAGUE TO MEET. Representatives To Consider Whether Series Should Be Played This Fall or Next Spring. 
### 
Whether the interfraternity base
ball series will be played this semes
ter or not will be the most important
subject for discussion at the meet
ing- of the Interfraternity Baseball
League, which has been called by
President R. Topp, '08, for tomorrow
evening at the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon house. Each of the sixteen fra
ternities is entitled to send one rep
resentative to the meeting, which will
be called to order at 8 o'clock.
Last semester, it was decided to
commence play in the interfraternity
series shortly after the Intercolleg
iate football match. This decision
was made on account of the short
time left in the spring semester af
ter the termination of the regular
Intercollegiate baseball season. The
Varsity is using the diamond during
nearly all of the semester, and would
take from the, fraternity games a
number of good men if the series
was held during that time. For
these reasons it was thought better
to hold the fraternity baseball in
the fall.
On the other hand, a number of
men directly interested in the frater
nity games wish to have them played
off in the spring. They advance as
arguments against playing in the fall
that rainy weather and darkness will
hinder baseball if played this semes
ter. Those who would rather see the
games in the spring claim also that
the players will be in better train
ing and will put up a much better
quality of baseball.
