# AWARD PLUG UGLY PRIZE
## COMMITTEE ARRANGES FOR "THE DOOMED DOUMA" C.P. Happy, '10, and J.W. Mott, '08, Will Receive Reward For Work On Manuscript. 
### 
"The Doomed Douma" is the name
of the Plug Ugly to be presented by
the Junior Class 011 October 25. The
extravaganza as it now stands is an
augmentation of a manuscript sub
mitted by C. P. Happy, '10. The
committee did a considerable amount
of work and incorporated in the re
vised draft a number of songs from
a manuscript by W. J. Mott, '08. The
committee yesterday awarded the
prize of twenty-five dollars to these
two men, to be divided equally be
tween them.
C. P. Happy, the author of the ac
cepted manuscript, is a Law major
from Spokane, Wash. He is a mem
ber of the Glee Club and is to be a
stunt man in the minstrel show
which the Combined Musical Clubs
will present in the near future. He
is a member of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity.
J. W. Mott, who will share the
prize, is an English major. He is
a member of the Sigma Chi frater
nity and registers from Salem, Ore.
As usual, the plot is concerned
with local persons and is laid in and
around the college community. The
details of the action have not been
published by the committee. The
cast is not yet fully chosen and will
be announced in a few days, when
all the persons to take part will have
been determined. The new scenery
to be used in the show has already
been ordered by the committee. All
preparations will be rushed for the
presentation of "The Doomed Dou
ma," so that by a week from Friday
everything will be in readiness for
the production on the varsity base
ball diamond.
