With the Freshman game out of
the way, Stanford enters into the
final weeks of the Rugby campaign.
Less than a month of practice re
mains before the Intercollegiate con
test with California, and there is
scheduled during that time five pre
liminary games on Stanford Field.
The coaches, the trainer, and the
players may be depended upon to do
their part in the final work of pre
paration. We feel confident that the
team will know the game, that the
men will go on the field in the best
of condition, and that they will
fight. It now rests with the under
graduates whether the big game is
to be won or lost. The Stanford
bleachers were behind the Freshmen
at the game last Saturday, and they
have supported the Varsity thus far
this season in excellent style. Dur
ing the next three weeks the final
call will be made upon our loyalty
and the response must be both
prompt and generous.
