# WORD FROM WASHINGTON
## STANFORD COMMUNICATION IS ACKNOWLEDGED. President Kane of the Northern University Expresses Appreciation of Spirit Shown. 
### 
Secretary C. L. Severy, 'OS, of the j
| Associated Students, has received a !
; letter from President Thomas F.
Kane of the University of Washing-!
ton, acknowledging the receipt of a
communication from the Executive
Committee thanking the students of
the University of Washington for
their work in recovering the bodies
of J. F. Goshorn, '08, and G. S. .la- j
1 queth, '10, who were drowned in i
Lake Washigton last summer.
The letter from President. Kane
follows:
University Station,
Seattle, Washington,
October 1 1,1 907.
i
Mr. C. L. Severy, Sec'y,
Student oBdy of Stanford Univer
sity,
Stanford University, California. !
My dear Mr. Severy: â€”
The communication from your Stu- '
dent Body sent by you to our tTni- 1
I versity was duly received. My best
J means of communicating your mes
sage to our students was through
i the University paper, The Pacific j
| Wave. A copy of your letter appear- i
ed in the Wave, October 4th; a copy
of that issue will be sent you if it
! has not already been sent. The stu
dents will also, doubtless, at their
first general meeting, acknowledge
I this fine communication.
T wish also to send to your stu
dents through you an acknowledg
ment of their communication and the
fine spirit which it represents. A
letter breathing such a spirit will go
far toward making ideal relations
! betwen the two Universities, and
I make negotiations and understand-
I
ings easy and simple whenever there
may be occasion for games or con
tests of any kind between the two
universities.
The expression in your letter of the
appreciation of the work done in the
University affected deeply the per
sons who took the most active part
at. that time. Such a letter would
repay any sacrifices or efforts that
were made at that time. It is still
more that every person taking part
in the recovery of Ihe bodies at that
time knows well that if the circum
stances had been reversed the same
service would have ben rendered at
Stanford University.
The accident was a sad, sad dis
aster. It is fortunate that out of so
great a loss some Rood may come to
the two universities involved.
Sincerely yours,
THOMAS F. KANE.
