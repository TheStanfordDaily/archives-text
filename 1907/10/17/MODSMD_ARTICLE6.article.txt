protest against hazing to all colleges
and universities in the United States. '
Parts of the letter read as follows:
"We believe that, hazing can only be !
done away with by the voluntary act
of the students, and we appeal to
the Senior Class for their assistance, ;
We suggest that the Faculty make a
college law that hazing in any shape
or form be abolished, under penalty
ol dismissal from college. We hope |
that this protest will meet with the
approval of everyone and that leg-1
islation and the passing of laws pro
hibiting hazing will not be neces
sary."
"We believe that you do not coun- 1
tenance hazing and we earnestly beg j
that your best efforts will be given
to the abolishing of a custom that, !
when carried to the excess that has
been committed, is not only a dis- ;
grace to our country, but a source '
of great sorrow and suffering to the :
mothers who, in sending their child
ren where they may receive the high
est intellectual training, know that
they may be subjected to this
wrong."
