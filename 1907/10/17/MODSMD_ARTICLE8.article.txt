# No Scholarship Award This Semester.
## 
### 
Owing to ihe lateness of the pres- j
ent, semester and a desire to grant
the "behind Stanford Junior Memor
ial Scholarship" to Ihe worthiest ap- j
plicant, il is not probable that the
appointment will be made by Trea
surer Charles G. Latlirop before the
01 ening of college in January. A
large number of candidates for the
scholarship have entered applications.
