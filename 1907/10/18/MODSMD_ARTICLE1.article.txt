# HENRY TO MEET GOWAN
## FINAL TENNIS MATCH .TO BE PLAYED TOMORROW. Doubles Tryouts Will Begin Monday. Freshman Entries Must Be In Tomorrow. 
### 
The final match of the interclass
tenis singles will take place on En
cina Courts tomorrow morning at 9
o'clock when T. C. Henry,'lo,will
meet, A. .1. Gowau, '09, to compete
for the University championship.
Gowan defeated J. F. Cassell, '08,
in the second match of the series by
a score of 6-4, 7-5, and played a
good game in a closely contested
match. His play, although not up to
its usual standard, is of a high class,
and Henry will find a dangerous op
ponent facing him tomorrow.
It is more difficult to judge what
sort of a game Henry is playing at
present as he has had no opportun
ity thus far to meet a man of his
own class. The matches he has won
in the present tournament have been
taken from men who were not his
equals at the game. With both of
these men playing up to form, how
ever, tomorrow's match will un
doubtedly prove interesting.
The doubles tryouts for represen
tative teams to compete for the
championship of the University in
the interclass tournament will begin
on Monday next. The first tryout
will be for the Freshman champion
ship and this will be followed by the
Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors in
the order named. All entries for the
Freshman tryout must be handed in
either to T. C. Henry, '10, or L. B.
Mackey, '10, before tomorrow night.
Entries for the other tryouts will
close some time next week.
