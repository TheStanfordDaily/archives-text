# MAKES REPORT ON FLUME.
## Professor Marx Presents Report To Finance Committee.â€”Urges That Work Be Done. 
### 
Professor C. D. Marx has had a
survey made of the flume which sup
plies the water to Lagunita. He es
timates the cost of repairing the
same in three different ways. He
will present these reports, with a
recommendation that the work be
done, to the Finance Committee of
the Board of Trustees today. Ac- ]
cording to one plan much of the old I
flume will be discarded and ditches J
substituted. This plan will, if de- j
cided on, do away with all but about ;
1600 feet of the flume. The other j
plans involve the rebuilding and re
pairing of much of the present
flume.
