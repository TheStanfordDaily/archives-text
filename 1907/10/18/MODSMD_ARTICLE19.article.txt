I regret that in the discharge of
ray duties as correspondent an un
written rule of the University was
violated by the report of classroom
lectures. I am loyal to Stanford
spirit and have always been careful
not to send out reports reflecting on
the Student Body or the University.
Therefore, I do not assume responsi
bility for yesterday's account of my
expulsion and regret the publication
of same in the varied form in which
they have been printed in the met
ropolitan dailies.
