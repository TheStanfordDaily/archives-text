# OPERA WILL BE STAGED
## PLAY IS SELECTED BY SWORD AND SANDALS. "Princess Of Leeland" By Erb and Bradley, â€™01, Will Be Produced By Dramatic Society. 
### 
At a meeting of Sword and San
dals, held last evening at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house, the organiza
tion decided definitely to produce a
play this year, and unless something
unforeseen occurs, it will take place
the latter part of this semester.
The play which the members had
in mind originally was found to he
unavailable, owing to the high roy
alty which would have to be paid,
and it was decided to revive the
"Princess of Leeland," a musical
comedy in three acts produced as a
Junior opera eight or nine years ago.
The play in question was written
by W. M. Erb, '01, and C. M. Brad
ley, '01, and those who saw it at
that time declare that it is by far
the best production of the kind that
lias ever been put on the Stanford
stage.
Arrangements will be made to se
cure the manuscript from Erb as
soon as possible, and it seems fairly
probable that the play will be staged
this semester. The play is an extrav
aganza, of an unusually clever sort,
and has a considerable element, of
local interest. The cast includes
seventeen speaking characters and a
full chorus of men and women.
R. S. Kellog, 'OS, was appointed
a committee to secure the manu
script. F. H. Bernard, '08, the presi
dent of the organization, was chosen
to represent the society in the Pres
ident's Conference.
