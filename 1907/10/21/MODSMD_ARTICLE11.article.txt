# DR. GARDNER ON POLITICS.
## Delivers Interesting Sermon on Importance of Honest Men Holding Government Positions. 
### 
Reverend D. Charles Gardner used
a.s his text at the Sunday morning
service "Give unto Caesar what is
Caesar's, and unto God what is
God's. In explaining the thought of
his text, the preacher used examples
of present day interest and touched
lightly on the subject of politics.
On this topic he said in part: "Deal
fearlessly with the ethical side of
politics and in no wise let an edu
cated person slur this important
branch of our government. Voters
are the kings that rule this nation."
Dr. Gardner said that President
Roosevelt in the fulfilling of his
duties as presiding officer of this
nation was guided in his work by
the hand of God. He compared the
manner in which Mayor Taylor of
San Francisco has handled the graft
situation since taking office, to the
temple of Jerusalem of thieves and
dishonest priests. Mrs. Blanchard,
contralto, was the soloist.
