# MARX REPORTS ON FLUME
## STUDENTS MAY NOT ASSIST IN REPAIR WORK. Three Estimates Submitted For The Consideration of The Finance Committee. 
### 
Professor C. D. Marx, who was
asked by the Trustees to make a re
port on the condition of the Lagun
ita flume, and ways of repairing it,
has handed his statement to the Fi
nance Committee. In it he advises
that the work of repairing the flume
be done by contract instead of by
student labor on a University holi
day, for the reason that much of the
undertaking will require skilled la
bor, and furthermore the Univer
sity has no tools for the students to
work with.
Professor Marx states that the
dam will have to be repaired, whe
ther the flume is rebuilt or not, as
the lower end has been undermined
by scour.
The first solution for filling the
lake provides for its being putin
serviceable condition in its present
position and will, with the repairing
of the dam and building a concrete
culvert under the road, necessitate
an expenditure of approximately
$2705.
The second plan is to replace the
old flume by an entirely new one of
the same size and in the same posi
tion. This, with the repairing of the
dam and building of the culvert, will
cost approximately $4 90 7.
The third solution, which is re
commended as the most feasible, is
to relocate the line and replace prac
tically all the flume by a ditch. With
the repairs on the dam and the
building of the culvert this work
would cost approximately $3943.
