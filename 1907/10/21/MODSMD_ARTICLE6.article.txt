## Exciting- Game Ends With 86 to 13 Score In Cardinal's Favor--Several Injuries Incurred. 
### 
In the most evenly contested game
of Rugby ever witnessed on Stanford
Field the Cardinal triumphed over
the Barbarians by a score of lti to
1 o Saturday afternoon. Great ex-

citement prevailed throughout the
two halves of fast football, and the
result was in doubt until the finil
tall of time. The visitors present
ed a much stronger line-up than on
their first appearance here, while
the personnel of the Stanford fifteen
was complete with the exception of
Vandervoort, who is still out of the
gnme because of an injured leg.
The Cardinal backs were speedy
and accurate and far excelled the
backfield of the visiting team, while
in the forward division the Barbar
ians were easily superior. Stanford
was exceedingly weak on defense,
but carried all before it on offen

sive play, while just tlie opposite was
true of the opposing fifteen. Ganong,
Ueed and Owen gained many yards
for the Cardinal, and Brown, at full,
filled his position perfectly. Elliott

and Buckingham were the stars of
the Barbarians. The latter met with
a painful accident during a loose
rush during the second half, break
ing his leg just above the ankle. This
was the first game in which he had
taken part since he broke his col
lar bone at Berkeley several weeks
ago. Giesy tore a ligament in his
knee, which will keep him on the
side-lines for a few days, and Thorpe
gave his shoulder a slight wrench.
After the initial kick-off the ball
see-sawed near center of the
field, and finally, after fifteen min
utes of play it was kicked to touch

jon the visitors' forty-five-yard line.
! tranong, securing from the line-out,
! passed to Holman, who transferred
to Miller, who registered the first
try, and Fenton converted. On the
resumption of play, Elliott twice at-
S tempted a goal from free placement
! kicks, but both times the ball fell
I short. A third opportunity, from the
thirty-five-yard line, was successful,
and the half ended with the score
5 to 3 in Stanford's favor.
Soon after the beginning of the
j last period, Fenton scored a goal
from a free kick on the twenty-flve
-1 yard line. Next, on a magnificent
I passing rush Buckingham and Elliot!.
I covered half the field, crossing the
i line for a try. Elliott converting
j made it 8 to S. A beautiful dodg
! ing run by Reed soon gave the Car
dinal three more points, and another
i try was secured for the Barbarians
by Elliott, who kicked the goal, and
the score was 13 to 11 in favor of
the visitors. During the last few
minutes of ithe game, Pemberton,
