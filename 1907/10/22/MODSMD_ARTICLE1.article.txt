## PLAY COMMITTEE DECIDES ON A MODERN COMEDY. “The Manoeuvers of Jane,” by Henry Arthur Jones Will Be Staged Next Semester. 
### 
The "Manoeuvers of Jane," by
Henry Arthur Jones, has been se
lected by the Sophomore Play Com
mittee as the production to be staged
by the class early in the spring sem
ester. The play is a modern come
dy, in four acts, dealing with the
vagaries and exploits of "Jane," a
vivacious and irrepressible girl of
nineteen. There are nine male and
eleven female parts in the cast as
written, but it it the intention of
the committee and coaches to lessen
this number somewhat. The play
was first put on in London in 18OS.
Henry Jones is well known as a
writer of successful comedies and
the "Manoeuvers of Jane" is con
sidered one of his best, productions.
Among other plays he lias written
are: "The Middleman," "Mrs.
Dane's Defence," "The Liars,"
"The Dancing Girl," "The Masquer
aders" and "Judah."
Ten coiiies of the play have been
ordered from the publishers in the
east and the tryouts will begin as
soon as these arrive and the parts
can be typewritten.
