The return of "Dan" Murphy
means that Stanford's boating in
terests will be in safe hands for the
season of 190 S. It is a decided re
lief to know that the Cardinal crews
are to be turned out next semester
by the same veteran oarsman who
had charge of them in 1906 and
1907.The innovation of fall training,
the retention of last year's coach,
and the certainty of practically a
veteran boat, should make the sea
son of 1908 an unusually successful
one for the Cardinal.
