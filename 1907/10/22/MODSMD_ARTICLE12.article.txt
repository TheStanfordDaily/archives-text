The Daily Palo Alto is in receipt
oi a communication stating that
there is no little doubt in the writ
er's mind just where the line should
he drawn in the matter ot' wearing
the S on watch-fobs and buttons. As
we understand the action of the Ex
ecutive Committee that body requests
that students who have no right to
wear the varsity emblem refrain
from placing the block S on their
personal property. The block S is
any S which is drawn on the same
lines as those on the athletic sweat
ers. A material difference from this
regular emblem is all that the com
mittee asks of anyone who desires
to p v \ce the initial on bis property.
