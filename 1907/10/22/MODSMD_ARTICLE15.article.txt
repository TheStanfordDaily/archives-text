Fired with the zeal of establishing
a brand-new college tradition, the
Senior engineers announced some
two weeks ago that they were to
found a gathering place for the
fourth-year men of the University.
The oak opposite the Engineering
corner of the Quad was set aside as
tlie hallowed spot, and a committee
was appointed to provide a suitable
resting place for weary students.
Forthwith came blue prints of front
elevations, side elevations, and plans
and specification enough to build a
fifteen-story skyscraper all accord
ing to Hoyle and Hosklns.
The brain work done, the commit
tee refused to condescend to the pie
bean work of actual construction
and accordingly a four-dollar-a-day
carpenter was hired for the task.
Anxious (o test the efficacy of the
work, one of the committee sat him
firmly upon the half-completed
bench. There was a trembling and
a crash. The committeeman arose
from a ruin that bore close resem
blance to the pictures of the famous
Quebec bridge.
And now the committee are alleg
ing that the plans and specifications
were correct and the fault lies with
the four-dollar-a-day carpenter.
