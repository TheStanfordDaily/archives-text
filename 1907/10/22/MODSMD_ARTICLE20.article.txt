## Rapid Improvement In Condition of Varsity Candidates.â€”Vandervoort Reappears. 
### 
As is customary on Monday after
noon, only light practice took place
yesterday. The coaches put the men
through the usual routine, devoting
the last few minutes to sprinting up
and down the field. It was very evi
dent that the men are fast rounding
into excellent condition, and that the
speed of the squad, as a whole, is
increasing. Much attention was
paid to the playing of the forwards
on the defense, as it was in this de
partment of the game that the weak
ness of the Cardinal was apparent
in the game with the Barbarians
Saturday.
The Varsity was strengthened by
the reappearance of Vandervoort on
the field after an absence of two
weeks. He was placed at his usual
position at center, Owen supplanting
Holman at wing. L. Smith was placed
on the training table at noon to
day.
