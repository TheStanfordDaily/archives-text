The fifteen from the University of
Nevada will line up against the Var
sity on Stanford Field tomorrow at
4 o'clock for the ninth annual foot
hall contest between the two insti
tutions. Nevada has a light, speedy
team this season and should give
the Cardinal an interesting game.
The Sagebrushers were greatly out
weighed at Berkeley last Saturday,
when they were defeated by the Bine
and Cold 25 to 0, and consequently
they did not have an opportunity to
exhibit their real capabilities. But
against the lighter Stanford men
Nevada should play far better
Rugby.
The visitors have had three games
this year. They bested an alumni
! fifteen 6 to 5, and were in turn de
i feated by the Barbarians by a 5 to
I 0 score, but only after two halves
lof hard, fierce playing. Their third
contest was that with California.
Nevada will present almost the
same lineup as was played last Sat
urday. The pack, as a whole, is
fast and aggressive both on offense
and defense, while the backs are
| comparatively weak. Their team
' work is very good, considering the

I limited opportunity which they have
I had for practice. Captain Freeman,
I who plays at lock, does not expect a

victory, but he promises that his
men will fight hard from start to fin
ish, winning or losing.
Admission to the game will be 50
cents. The teams will line up as
follows:
Nevada —Leavitt, Keup, Freeman,
Miller, Bennett, Tillotson, Westal,
forwards; Ross, wing forward; Ken
nedy, half; Folsom, Selby, fives;
Arntz, center; Rossi, Porter, Wings;
Roeder, full.
Stanford —Koerner, Rhyne, Min
i turn, Pemberton, Crawford, Miller,
Smith, forwards; Mayers, wing for
ward; Fenton, half; Mitchell, Gan
ong, fives; Vandervoort, center;
i Reed, Owen, wings; Brown, full.
