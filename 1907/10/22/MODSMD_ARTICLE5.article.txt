# Vancouver Team in San Francisco.
## 
### 
The twenty-one members and
substitutes of the Vancouver Rugby
team arrived in San Francisco yes
terday, and will play California to
morrow and Saturday. Reggie Wood
ward, the well known football player :
who accompanies them as manager, j
states that it is the strongest team |
1 ever sqnt from British Columbia. I
■
There are only three men on it
who played here last year—Bajus, !
Harris, and Newcomb. Five of the
members learned the game in Eng
land, three in Australia, and two in
New Zealand. The team as a whole,
however, has never played any other,
although the men have been practic
ing together for about three weeks.
The team is said to be very well bal
janced, but especially strong in the
back division.
