## COACH AWAITING CONTRACT FROM STANFORD. Much Work To Re Bone On Shells Before Fall Training For Crew Begins. 
### 
"Dan" Murphy, Stanford's rowing
coach last year, has sent an accept
ance to the offer of $150 per month
lor the boating season of 1908. This
offer was recently made to him by
Manager Knupp under the authority
of the Executive Committee. Mur
phy is now in the central part of the
slate and awaits only the receipt
of a formal contract from the Stu
dent Body to close negotiations.
In a letter received from Murphy
by Crew Captain L. R. Gay, 'OS,
the Cardinal coach states that he will
arrive here on or before the first of
December in order to complete, as
soon as possible, the work of repair
ing the shells and barges and ar
ranging of quarters for the use of
the crew during the fall training
season.
The eight-oared shell has been
stored in the warehouse of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company since
the return of the crew from their
regatta on Lake Washington. The
lshel| will have to be thoroughly
cleaned and revarnished before being
placed in the water for the coming
season.
The four is at present in storage
at Redwood City together with both
of the barges and all of these boats
must have the same treatment this
fall. Murphy states in his letter
that he desires to obtain a place in
Redwood where he will be able to
do this work since the boathouse
will not be satisfactory for this pur
pose.
