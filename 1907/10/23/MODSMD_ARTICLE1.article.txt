## SENIORS WILL HAVE MANY NOVEL CONCESSIONS. Free Show Will Include Balloon Ascension, Broncho Busting Hasting Acrobatic and Tight-Rope Stunts. 
### 
The committee in charge of the Se
nior Circus is maturing plans which
will set a high standard for all per
formances of the future. The big
parade will be held in the afternoon,
and in the evening another grand
parade lie held inside the
grounds. For both of these, prizes
will be given a;s previously announc
ed. The free show in the evening will
include novel acrobatic stunts, skill
ed tight-rope walking, broncho bust
ing, a balloon ascension, and many
other features of similar worth.
The whole enclosure will be bril
liantly illuminated in a manner
which has never before been seen
here; but the committee refuses to
divulge the exact details at present.
The eating facilities will be exten
sive and of the highest order.
A large number of the conces
sions have already been arranged for.
One of the biggest sideshows will
be in charge of F. A. Curtin, who is
to have a large enclosure filled with
expensive importations never before
exhibited here. Another will be real
moving pictures and illustrated
songs. W. W. Wilson, '07, has se
cured a large and novel electrical
display from the East, and will weigh
thoughts, show the results of electri
(al impressions, and perform other
feats of unusual scientific inter
est. A concession of more than usual
merit will be a Typical Mining Camp,
imported directly from Tonopah, Ne
vada, and reproduced down to the
most minute details.
The committee is especially .ju
bilant, over the fact that it has been
able to secure Tixe. The expense of
bringing this feature here was at
first thought to be absolutely prohib
itive, but the courtesy of the Chief
Customs Officer of the Port of San
Francisco removed the last obstacle.
