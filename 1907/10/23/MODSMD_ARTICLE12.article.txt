A suggestion might be offered the
Faculty Committee on Public En
tertainments in regard to the at
tractions which they intend to stage
this semester. Sousa's Band is now
on the Pacific Coast and has already
been engaged to play at the Univer
sity of California. These musicians
have a national reputation and if
the matter could be arranged their
appearance in Assembly Hall would
be greatly appreciated by the Stu
dent, Body here.
