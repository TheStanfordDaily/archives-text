# CONSIDERING NEW SYSTEM.
## Princeton Students May Live in Separate Colleges, as at English Universities. 
### 
Nothing has so aroused Princeton
men, both alumni and undergradu
ates, as the proposal that the uni
versity should adopt the so-called
"quad" system, which is practically
the plan of having all the students
reside in a number of small colleges,
as is done at the English universi
ties. President Woodrow Wilson is
the strongest advocate of the new
system, on which undergraduates
seem to bo divided.
No fraternities are allowed at
Princeton, but their place is taken
by rooming and boarding clubs which
are practically the same as ordin
ary fraternity chapters. Lately the
university authorities have decided
that the exclusive clubs are objection
able and must be abolished. The
president hopes that by introducing
the English system of residence in
colleges, the clubs may be driven out,
and many advantages gained.
