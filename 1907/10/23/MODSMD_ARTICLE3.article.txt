### 
The University of Nevada fifteen
was easily defeated by the Varsity
this afternoon in a spectacular ex
hibition of Rugby. The final score
was 31 to 0. The visitors fouglit
gamely but were outclassed in every
department. The Stanford backs
played in their usual speedy style,
and the forwards showed to better
advantage than formerly Fenton
was the brilliant star of the day.
He successfully converted all of the
live tries and also stored two goals
from placement kicks.
Folsom started the game by kick
ing off for Nevada. Neither side was
able at lirst to obtain any distinct
advantage. Stanford was weak on de
j l'ense while the Cardinal backs could
not start any successful' rushes. An
off-side play of the visitors finally
gave the Cardinal a free kick on
, Nevada's '58-yard line. The ball fell
short but Pemberton secured. He
was forced to pass, the ball rolling
over the line and Mayers falling on
it, making the first try. A goal
from a difficult angle was kicked by
| Fenton. Score, 5 to 0.
Play remained near the center of
the field for some moments after the
kick-off. Frequent penalties were
' given to both teams. A dribbling
rash by Nevada brought the ball to
l Stanford's 18-yard line, but Brown
relieved by finding touch at mid-field.
Soon after Miller marked a Neva
dan's punt on the 38-yard line and
Fenton succeeded in sending the ball
squarely between the posts, making
the score 8 to 0.

Just before time was called Van
| dervoort scored a try on a pretty 50-
j yard run, Fentou converting, making
! tire score 13 to 0.
From tiie sound of the whistle at
!
! the kick-off of the second half the
' Cardinal team played much speed
ier Rugby. The third try of the
; game was soon scored by Pember
ton from the loose within a few
yards of the goal line. Kenton con
verted. The next three points were
secured by Cook and Reynolds in a
short passing rush, and the reliable
half-back once more kicked the goal.
Nevada then rallied and worked the
ball down into the Cardinal's terri
, lory. But the change was only mo
mentary. Miller soon got possession
of the pigskin on a poor punt by Sel
. by and planted the oval behind the
i goal posts after a spectacular run
of forty-five yards. Fenton once
again converted.
Just before the cali of time Stan
, ford was given a free kick, and Fen
i ton made a beautiful goal from
placement on the 3s>-yard line. Fin
