The Seniors will confer a favor
on the audience as well as the ac
tors at the Plug Ugly performance
tomorrow night if they will refrain
from carrying the joshing of the
performance too far. It is no credit
to anyone to prevent the play from
being finished, for that can he easily
accomplished and requires no great
ingenuity. It is difficult to say just
when the senseless custom of inter
fering with the actors was started
but it was carried to such a length
last year that it practically made the
performance an exchange of missiles
between the assembled Seniors and
the cast. Such an exhibition is not
what the audience pays its money to
see, and it can readily be seen that
if the practice is carried far enough
U will result in the whole idea of the
Plug Ugly being lost. There is plen
ty of time and opportunity for the
two upper classes to settle their dif
ferences after the show and we
strongly advise that the fight be kept
in its proper place tomorrow even
ing.
