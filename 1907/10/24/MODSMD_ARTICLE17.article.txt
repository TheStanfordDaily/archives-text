t". S. May Organize Rugby Team.
Owing to the fact that it has quar
reled with all the other insti
tutions near it, and finds it impos
sible to get, enough football dates to
make a schedule, the University of
Southern California is considering
the adoption of Rugby, in order to
enter into athletic relations with
Stanford and California.
Since Pomona gave up Rugby
there has been 110 team in the South
playing it continually. At the pre
sent time, however, Pomona refuses
to play football with U. S. C., and
Occidental may take the same action
before next season at least. So, in
self defense, U. S. C. will be forced
to adopt the new game, and furnish
another opponent for California and
Stanford.
