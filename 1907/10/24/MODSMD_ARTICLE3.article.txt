# Break In Siphon At Felt Lake.
## 
### 
The installation of the siphon at
Felt Lake has been delayed by a
serious break in the pipe which will
necessitate the substitution of heavy
pipe for that now in use. Water
was running through the siphon yes
terday for a few minutes but the
light pipe would not stand the strain.
Plumbers are now at work repairing
the break and the siphon will be in
operation again some time next
week. The level of the lake has re
ceded about three feet to date.
