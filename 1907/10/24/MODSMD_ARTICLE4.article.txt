# ADOPTS CONSTITUTION
## ENGLISH CLUB PLANS ACTIVE YEARS' WORK. Membership Requirements Will Be Stringent.â€”Candidates Must Be Recommended By Faculty. 
### 
The English Club last night adopt
ed a new constitution which is in
some respects a radical departure
from the rules which formerly gov
erned that body.
The tone of the new constitution
is shown in the preamble which
reads, "We, the members of the Eng
lish Club of Stanford University,
realizing the need of fostering in the
University community the aims and
ideals for which this club is intend
ed to stand, and believing this can
best be accomplished by thorough or
ganization, do adopt for our govern
ment the following constitution."
The aims of the club as set forth
are: to secure distinguished men to
address the club, to present to the
University audience some standard
literary drama of educational inter
est, and to increase appreciation of
certain fields of literary study by
definite programs of investigation.
The constitution, as adopted, pro
vides that membership shall be giv
en on recommendation of the exec
utive committee who shall first sub
mit the names of all the candidates
to all the members of the Faculty
ot' the English department under
whom the person under discussion
has taken work, for recommendation
as to abilty and general culture.
Associated membership is open to
interested persons not connected
with the University. Honorary
membership may be given to those
who have contributed something
really worth while to literature.
There is no new departure in the
matter of officers, committees or
dues.
Hereafter the regular meetings will
be closed meetings and will be at
tended only by those interested in
the pursuit of some line of special
study taken up by the club. There
will be two open meetings a sem
ester.
Professor Gray withdrew his offer
of allowing the club to produce his
version of "The Merchant of Venice,'
but the production of some Shake
spearian or Elizabethan drama dur
ing the current year is under consid
eration.
The plan for the year's work will
be formulated by the executive com
mittee and presented at the next
meeting.
