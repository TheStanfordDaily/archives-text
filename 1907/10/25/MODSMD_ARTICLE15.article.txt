Several weeks ago the Daily Palo
Alto printed a communication rela
tive to the muddy crossings and gen
eral poor condition of the sidewalks
about the University. The first hea
vy rains have made it very apparent
that the complaint was well founded.
The condition of both walks and
crossings is disgraceful, and not only
puts students and Faculty to ser
ious inconvenience, but also acts as
a serious menace to health. In view
of the fact that the judicious ex
penditure of a few dollars would
easily remedy the evil it is difficult
to understand the reason for such
palpable negligence on the part of
the authorities.
