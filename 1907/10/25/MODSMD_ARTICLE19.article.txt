Men .May .Manage Their Own Affairs.
The Associated Women Students
of California have voted that they
desire their interests to be kept sep
arate from those of the men of the s
i university, and have proposed a
| number of amendments to the con
stitution to that effect. It is intend-j
ed that hereafter there shall be two
distinct bodies —one of the men, and !
j one of the women, and that their
business affairs shall be kept en-
J tirely apart.
The most important effect of this j
change would be to prevent the wo
men from having any voice in the |
j control of the men's athletics, or |
any vote in electing the man presi- j
dent. The executive committee of
the student body has passed favor
ably upon the matter, and it will be !
put to a general vote of the stu-j
j dents very soon.
