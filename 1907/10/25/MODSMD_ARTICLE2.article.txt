# U.C. TEAM TO TAKE TRIP.
## Will Spend Week at Monterey in Training on Del Monte Polo Field For Big Game. 
### 
The rule at California which for
bids a football team to leave the
campus for more than twenty-four
hours at a time has been with
drawn, and twenty-one members of
the Blue and Gold squad will go to
.Monterey ou Saturday, November 2,
to spend the next week there in pre
paration for the game with Stanford.
The reason for this trip is not
only to give the men a quiet week,
but to allow them practice on a turf
field. The coaches feel that their
team might be at a disadvantage if
I laying on the grass here for the
first time, so secured the use of tho
Del Monte Polo Field. A regular
training table will be maintained at
Monterey.
