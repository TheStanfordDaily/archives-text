# Columbia Interprets Liberally.
## 
### 
The Columbia faculty has decided
that the rules which bar students
from participation in athletics when
they are delinquent in classes shall
not be enforced until 1910, but that
all cases shall be considered indi
vidually. It was found that if the
rule were enforced, 70 per cent of
the university's athletes would be
ruled out, for insufficient entrance
preparation.
