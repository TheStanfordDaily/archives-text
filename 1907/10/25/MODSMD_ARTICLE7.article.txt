# FINAL BARBARIAN GAME
## SAN FRANCISCO TEAM PLAYS CARDINAL TOMORROW. Several Changes In Personnel of Varsity Fifteen.—Fenton Retained At Half. 
### 
The third and last game of the
Rugby series between the Varsity
&nd the Barbarian team, of San
Francisco, will be played on Stan
ford Field tomorrow afternoon, com
mencing at 4 o'clock. As the vis
itors will in all probability present
the same strong line-up as they did
last Saturday, with the exception of
Buckingham, who suffered a frac
ture of the leg, a fast, close game
should result, and the fact that it
is the last contest between the two
fifteens will add to the interest.
Changes are being constantly made
in the personnel of the Varsity. Ter
rili has been doing excellently of
late and will be with Captain Koer
ner in the front rank tomorrow.
The lock position will be filled by
Shaner, and Reynolds will take the
place of Thorpe, whose injured
shoulder is still keeping him on the
side-lines. Mayers will play wing
forward, and Fenton and Brown will
be i«t half and full respectively.
Vandervoort is again in the game
and is putting up a speedy and ac
curate exhibition of Rugby. He, to
gether with Reed and Holman, the
wings, are responsible for many
spectacular passing rushes. No
changes have occurred in respect to
any of the other positions.
An admission of twenty-five cents
will be charged. The announcement
on the posters that tickets would
cost fifty cents was entirely errone
ous. The teams will line up as fol
lows:
Stanford —Koerner, Terrill, Shan
er, Pemberton, Crawford, Miller,
Reynolds, forwards; Mayers, wing
forward; Fenton, half; Mitchell, Ga
in ng, fives; Vandervoort, center;
