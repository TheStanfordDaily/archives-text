A Vita! Question
That Concerns Every
Girl Student
With the approach of winter the
cold unsettled weather conditions is
a subject that should arrest the
attention of every girl student—a sub
ject upon whose proper consideration
depends the assurance of her success
—is that of Health and Warmth.
And surely there is nothing more con
ducive to health and bodily warmth
than the proper selection of winter
underwear.
In this, procure the best. "Mun
sing" and "Forest Mills" underwear
(union suits and separate garments)
are without peers. They are con
structed of especially soft non-irritant
wools, so as to conform to every
curve of the body; perfect fitting in
every respect, non-shrinkable and very
elastic. When in San Jose ask to sec
our extensive showing at per garment
from
50c to $.3.50
