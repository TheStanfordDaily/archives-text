The decision made by . the Fi
nance Committee of the Board of
Trustees in regard to the filling of
Lake Lagunita next spring will be
received with no little satisfaction
here, it is especially gratifying to
learn that the improvements made
in the flume line will be of such a
permanent nature that the lake will
be insured for several years to
come. In regard to the opening of
the Memorial Church, it. is a great
disappointment that shortage of
funds makes it impossible for the
Trustees to have the necessary work
done. The appointment of an organ
ist had given us occasion to believe
that the custom of daily organ re
citals was to be revived again, and
it is particularly unfortunate tnat
the condition of the Church makes
this impossible. it. might be sug
gested that those who are interested
in the organ recitals do not demand
that the Church shall be restored
to its former completeness but only
ask that space enough be set aside
to accommouate a very small audi
ence. Experts declare that to pre
serve the tone of the organ it should
be constantly played upon and this
consideration, when taken with that
of the student and Faculty interest
in the recitals, should make out a
case worthy of more serious discus
sion than was evidently granted it
at the last meeting.
