Reverend H. H. Bell, of the Uni

Francisco preached in the Chapel
yesterday morning. He took as his
scripture lesson the first chapter of
the book of John. His text was tak
eu from the first chapter of Collos
iuns, the eighteenth verse: "that
ir. all things he might have pre
eminence."
Attention was called to four of
the ways in which pre-eminence was
displayed by Jesus Christ. The first
of the four ways Reverend Bell ex
ond, "a God of Purpose," the third
ond, "a God of purpose,' the third
as "a God of wisdom and character,"
and the last way that pre-eminence
was displayed as "the greatest re
constructive power in the world's
history." He compared the ways in
which Napoleon and other leaders of
men founded empires to the way in
which God has established his do
minion here 011 earth.
The sermon ended in an appeal
for everyone to make Jesus Christ
pie-eminent in their own heart, in
student life, and in every affair of
importance in this life. After the
strmon Dr. Gardner announced that
a choir was to be organized next Sat
