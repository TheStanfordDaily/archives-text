# 1909 STAGES PLUG UGLY
## ANNUAL SHOW PRESENTED BY JUNIORS FRIDAY EVENING. Fight on Quad and at Post Office Close and Interesting.â€” Large Audience in Attendance. 
### 
Owing to the rain, the Junior Plug
l T gly, "The Doomed Duma," was pro
duced in Assembly Hall Friday night
instead of on the baseball field as
had been planned. The house was
well filled, and the change was a
profitable one to the Class of li) 09.
netting them $125.70 on the per
formance.
The production might have escap
ed censure if it had been given
on the field as originally intended,
where the half light would have hid
den some of its defects, but in the
glare of the footlights it presented
a different aspect. The vigorous
joshing of the actors, indulged in by
the Seniors, prevented the audience
from hearing much that was said on
the stage, but the second act was car
ried altogether too far by the players.
Immediately at the close of the
second act the Juniors left the hall
in a body, hastily followed by the
members of 190,5. The Juniors don
ned their plugs and formed ranks
in front of the steps by the French
building, waiting there until the
Seniors had gathered their forces ;it
the top of the steps.
The fight here was evenly matched
and hotly contested; easily the best
exhibition of the evening. Time af
ter time the solid rank of plugs
rushed up the steps only to be hurl
ed back again when met by the mass
of 190S men at the top.
Finally, by concentrating their
force at one corner of the steps, the
Juniors succeeded in securing a foot
hold, and forced their way onto the
Quad. Their progress around the in
ner Quad was practically unchecked,
except for a brief halt in front of the
Chapel, but a fierce running fight
was kept, up the entire distance.
The roughest part of the contest oc
curred at the post office steps, where
the slippery condition of the pave
ment rendered secure footing impos
sible. The fight here was a badly
mixed affair, and men from both
classes were on the steps practically
all the time. When the struggle
finally, came to an end. however, the
Juniors appeared to have the advan
tage.

front of the post office, and several
others were ill from the over-exer
tion.
