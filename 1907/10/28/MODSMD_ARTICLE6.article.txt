# VARSITY FIFTEEN LOSES
## BARBARIANS WIN DECISIVELY BY 13 TO 6 SCORE. Discouraging Slump Possesses Entire Cardinal Team and Erratic Playing Results. 
### 
The Varsity fifteen suffered a de
cisive defeat at the hands of the
far superior Barbarians on Stanford
Field last Saturday afternoon. The
final score read 1:> to G. The Cardin
al wns outplayed from the start, and
was especially outclassed in the for
ward division. The visiting pack
followed the ball perfectly, gaining
many yards by short dribbling rush
es. The usually brilliant Varsity
backs put up an extremely poor ex
hibition of Rugby and failed to do
any spectacular offensive work, the
majority of their passing rushes be
ing interrupted by forward passes
or knock-ons. The entire team
seemed in the throes of a most dis
couraging slump.
The game started with the spirit
and dash that characterized the con
test of the previous week between
the two fifteens, but the play soon
became much slower and correspond
ingly uninteresting. There were few
long runs, and fast loose rushes were
responsible for most of the ground
gaining.
The first half began with Crawford
kicking off, and the ball was rushed
back and forth in the Barbarian's
territory. An off-side play gave
Fenton a free kick at a difficult an
gle on the 25-yard line, but the pig
skin fell short. A moment later
Vandervoort. secured from the loose,
passing to Holman, who scored. Fen
ton failed to convert the hard goal.
After the drop-out the Cardinal's line
was continually threatened, only the
effective defense of the pack on the
many line-outs preventing a try. Fi
nally the speedy Elliott received the
ball twenty yards from the goal and
succeeded in scoring before being
tackled, but he failed to convert.
The half ended soon afterwards,
when the ball had been carried to
Stanford's 10-yard line by a bril
liant rush of the Barbarians. Score,
:> to :i.
The visitors secured another try
within a few minutes after the ini
tial kick-off in the second period,
Sands crossing the line in a dribbling
rush. Elliott missed the goal, and
on the resumption of play Stanford
was awarded a free kick near the
Barbarian's goal. Shanks caught the
ball and dropped it squarely between
the posts from the 28-yard line. The
next score came from a placement
kick by Elliott thirty yards from the
goal, and the last try of the after
noon was made by the Cardinal on a
forty-five yard passing rush. Cook
centered to Cadwalader, who trans
ferred to Vandervoort, and the fast
three-quarter crossed the line be
fore he was stopped. Crawford was
unsuccessful in converting. Final
score, 13 to 6.
During the last half Captain Koer
ner received a severe kick in the
head which rendered him uncon
\scious and he was forced to re
tire from tlie game. His an
kle was also slightly hurt. Mc,
uregor took his place at front rank.
Towards the end of the first, pe
riod Faulkner replaced Brown, at
full, who had an off day, and during
the second half several other changes
were made in the line-up. C. Pem
berton substituted for Mayers, Hein
ly took the place of Fenton, and
Ganong was replaced by Cook. The
wing positions were filled by Owen
and Cadwalader, lieed and Holman
l etiring.
At half-time a collection was taken
ui- on the bleachers for the aid of
Buckingham, who broke his leg in
the game with the Varsity on Octo
ber. 19. $1:10.35 was realized.

The Varsity fifteen suffered a de
cisive defeat at the hands of the
far superior Barbarians on Stanford
Field last Saturday afternoon. The
final score read 1:> to G. The Cardin
al wns outplayed from the start, and
was especially outclassed in the for
ward division. The visiting pack
followed the ball perfectly, gaining
many yards by short dribbling rush
es. The usually brilliant Varsity
backs put up an extremely poor ex
hibition of Rugby and failed to do
any spectacular offensive work, the
majority of their passing rushes be
ing interrupted by forward passes
or knock-ons. The entire team
seemed in the throes of a most dis
couraging slump.
The game started with the spirit
and dash that characterized the con
test of the previous week between
the two fifteens, but the play soon
became much slower and correspond
ingly uninteresting. There were few
long runs, and fast loose rushes were
responsible for most of the ground
gaining.
The first half began with Crawford
kicking off, and the ball was rushed
back and forth in the Barbarian's
territory. An off-side play gave
Fenton a free kick at a difficult an
gle on the 25-yard line, but the pig
skin fell short. A moment later
Vandervoort. secured from the loose,
passing to Holman, who scored. Fen
ton failed to convert the hard goal.
After the drop-out the Cardinal's line
was continually threatened, only the
effective defense of the pack on the
many line-outs preventing a try. Fi
nally the speedy Elliott received the
ball twenty yards from the goal and
succeeded in scoring before being
tackled, but he failed to convert.
The half ended soon afterwards,
when the ball had been carried to
Stanford's 10-yard line by a bril
liant rush of the Barbarians. Score,
:> to :i.
The visitors secured another try
within a few minutes after the ini
tial kick-off in the second period,
Sands crossing the line in a dribbling
rush. Elliott missed the goal, and
on the resumption of play Stanford
was awarded a free kick near the
Barbarian's goal. Shanks caught the
ball and dropped it squarely between
the posts from the 28-yard line. The
next score came from a placement
kick by Elliott thirty yards from the
goal, and the last try of the after
noon was made by the Cardinal on a
forty-five yard passing rush. Cook
centered to Cadwalader, who trans
ferred to Vandervoort, and the fast
three-quarter crossed the line be
fore he was stopped. Crawford was
unsuccessful in converting. Final
score, 13 to 6.
During the last half Captain Koer
ner received a severe kick in the
head which rendered him uncon
\scious and he was forced to re
tire from tlie game. His an
kle was also slightly hurt. Mc,
uregor took his place at front rank.
