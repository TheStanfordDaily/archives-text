In the news columns of this issue
the Daily Palo Alto reprints an edi
torial from "Collier's Weekly" in
which certain absurd statements in
regard to Rugby are credited to
Advisory Coach Lanagan. The as
surance from Stanford's coach that
he has said nothing which even the
most ingenious of writers could have
twisted into the story published
by Collier's makes it diffi
cult to understand what founda
tion that weekly has for its asser
tions. To deliberately misquote a
man and to give the misquotation
added weight by placing it in the
editorial columns is a practice which
should be far beneath even the most
unscrupulous of papers.
