## Sweeping Statements On Benefits of Rugby Wrongly Imputed to Lanagan. 
### 
An editorial on football in the cur
rent number of "Collier's" quotes
Coach Lanagan as the author of sev
eral sweeping assertions concerning
the beneficial results of tlie introduc
tion of Rugby on the Pacific Coast.
Lanagan denies all responsibility for
the statement and says he knows ab
solutely nothing about it.
Following are the words imputed
to the Stanford Coach:
"We have clone away with foot
ball as an academic nuisance and
restored it as a sport. Rugby takes
only half the time of the old game.
We don't have to teach elaborate
strategy; there the saving lies. We
don't need heavy armor. Our men
play in light padded trousers, any
kind of jerseys, and light, cleated
shoes. If we had turf fields we would
play bare-kneed like the English.
These clothes cost about six dollars
a man and the players get them for
themselves; so they're no longer pen
sioners on the student body. Elab
orate gear is not needed. In fact,
it would be in the way. During the
last year of the American game we
had thirteen injuries in our squad—
from a broken collar bone down. In
our first Rugby season we had one—
a twisted ankle. For myself, I think
we've solved the football problem."
