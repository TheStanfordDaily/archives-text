# Varsity and Vancouver Will Play Tomorrow
## British Columbian Fifteen Composed Of Many Individual Stars--Stanford Team Crippled. 
### 
The first game between the Var
sity and the Vancouver Rugby team
» will be played on Stanford Field
| tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock. This
j contest should furnish the first reli
able comparison of the relative mer-
I its of the Cardinal and California
fifteens. It will undoubtedly be an
exciting exhibition of high class Hug
hs. The visitors are a strong com
bination and far more formidable
i than the aggregation which came
[south last year. A very valuable ad
j dition to their ranks is C. Simpson,
jof Queensland, who plays wing
three-quarter.
The Vancouver men arrived in Pa
lo Alto at 12:50 today and are quar
tered on the Campus at the various
I fraternity houses. Manager R. P.
j Woodward expressed himself as con
siderably surprised at. the exception
; ally good playing of the Blue and
Gold varsity. He stated further,
| "The California men put up a much
better game this year than they did
last. In the mud yesterday, how
ever, they were noticeably weak, and
could not do justice to themselves.
Of course, I can form no opinion of
the Intercollegiate contest until I see j
Stanford in action tomorrow. We
have a strong, reliable team, and
I am satisfied that we will give a
good account of ourselves in the two
j coming games with the Varsity."

The line-up of the Cardinal fifteen
will be considerably different from
that of Saturday. Captain Koer.
ner will not be able to play because
of a torn ligament in his ankle,
while an injured knee will keep
Reed on the side-lines. Thorpe al
so is still incapacitated. Rhyne and
Terrill will be in the front rank,
while Cook will fill Reed's position,
and Reynolds will substitute for
Thorpe. The most unexpected change
i-s the placing of Cadwalader at full.
He has been tried at this difficult
post during the last two afternoons
of practice, and has done so well
that he will be there in the game
tomorrow. Cadwalader has been
placed on the training table.
Tickets to the game tomorrow will
be fifty cents, and the same admis
sion will be charged next Saturday.
The line-ups follow:
Stanford—Rhyne, Terrill, Minturn,
•J. R. Pemberton, Crawford, Miller,
Reynolds, forwards; Mayers, wing
forward; Fenton, half; Mitchell, Ga
nong, fives; Vandervoort, center;
Hoi man, Cook, wings; Cadwalader,
full.
Vancouver—Stafford, Jewett, Lof
tus, Dunn, McConaghy, Springer,
Brenton, forwards; Bajus, wing for
ward; Newcombe, half; Bull, John
ston, fives; Flood, center; Holmes,
Simpson, wings; Lusk, full.
