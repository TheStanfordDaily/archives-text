# VANCOUVER WINS FROM U.C.
## California Goes Down To Defeat By Score of 3 to O.â€”Mud Prevents Fast Play. 
### 
Vancouver won an uninteresting
game of Rugby from California at
Berkeley yesterday by the score of
8 to 0. The mud on the field was so
deep as to almost prohibit any spec
tacular work, and the players found
it very difficult even to hold onto the
ball. The Vancouver men showed
good judgment in not attempting to
make gains by passing, and when the
California men also realized that this
was the best policy, the game was
resolved into a series of scrums very
similar to the old-fashioned mass
plays.
In the second half the players
had stamped the field down enough
to make the footing a little better,
and the Californians exerted their
best efforts to score, but were not
quite able to attain the line, al
though when time was called they
were within five yards of it.
The weight and condition of the
university men helped them greatly,
especially during the last part of the
play: but the Vancouver team show
ed in general a much better knowl

edge of the game. They would have
piled up a much greater score, ex
cept for the excellent defense of the
California men. The back fields had
very little work to do yesterday, all
the activity being confined to the
forwards.
