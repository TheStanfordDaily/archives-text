## REFUSE TO CASH CHECKS LOCAL HANKS WILL NOT HONOR OUTSIDE DRAFTS. Action Caused By Present Stringency In Money Market.—Bankers Hope to Restore Normal Conditions Soon. 
### 
Acting upon advices from San
I-rancisco, the local I'alo Alto and
Ma.vlield banks today refused to cash
any checks or drafts drawn on out
side institutions and will accept no
paper except for collection. This ac
tion is due to tin* present stringency
of 111«» New York money market and
to the fact that throughout the en
tire country the hanks are doing
business on a clearing house basis.
This action of the local banks was
taken as a measure of self-protection.
The demand for currency is so great
iu tlie large commercial centers and
the interest offered is so high, that
the tendency is for money to be with
drawn from the smaller banks and
sent to the large cities. In order
to prevent this and to keep sufficient
currency on hand for their own
needs, the local institutions have
been compelled to refuse to honor
any checks or drafts except their
own.
In some cases, where the holder
of a draft has an account with the
bank and is in immediate need of
cash, the bank will accept the pa
per for collection and will advance
a small percentage of its face value.
The bankers will make no definite
statement as to how long this state
o' affairs will last hut are hopeful
that normal conditions will he re
stored in a, few days.
