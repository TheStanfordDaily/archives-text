replete with the brilliant work
of both teams and the rushes

easily the most spectacular ex
hibition seen on the home
grounds this season. Five tries
were driven across the Vancou
ver line, four of which were
converted. The men from Brit
ish Columbia scored three tries
and a goal from placement.

The work of the Cardinal backs
was very spectacular, completely out
classing the Vancouver back field. Ac
curacy and speed were features of
their play. Honors were more even
1. divided among the forwards, the
visitors having a slight advantage.
Still the Cardinal scrum men put up
■\ more aggressive and reliable game
than they have hitherto this season.
They followed the ball well, and
their dribbling was uniformly good.
A slight injury kept Vandervoort
out of the line-up, and his place was
brilliantly filled by Owen. Cadwal
nder acquitted himself creditably at
lull, and Cook played well at wing.
Miller was a tower of strength in
the pack. During the second half
Heinly and Brown substituted for
Kenton and Cadwalader, the latter
i > placing Holnian at wing.

was followed by fast playing near
j mid-field, and neither team had any
noticeable advantage. The work of
