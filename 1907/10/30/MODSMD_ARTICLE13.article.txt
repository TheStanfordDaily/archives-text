It is hardly necessary to point out
again the important part which the
rooting section plays in the annual
Irtercollegiate game. Fiat the sup
port given the team will of necessi
ty be ineffectual unless the men on
the bleachers know the songs and
yells and can l<eep together when
they are called for by the yell lead
ers. The song practice in the Chap
el tomorrow evening is for the pur
pose of making an organized sup
port possible and every student who
plans to be in the rooting section
November 9 should be on hand in
order that he may be able to do his
part when called upon.
