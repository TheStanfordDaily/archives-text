President Turner's request that the
task of entertaining the California
seniors at luncheon on the day of
the big game be not. left entirely to
the committee in charge brings up
a point which the Seniors here can
not well afford to disregard. Every
member of the Class of 1908 is re
sponsible for the entertainment of
the California men 011 that day and
a.; hosts should personally take pains
to make the stay of the visiting sen
iors a pleasant one. For this rea
son we urge every Stanford Senior

help to make it a success.
