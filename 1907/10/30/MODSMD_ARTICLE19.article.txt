# WILL DANCE WITH LIGHTS.
## Worsley to Present Original Stunt in Minstrel Show.—Opera and Rugby To Be Burlesqued. 
### 
Several original features will en
liven the minstrel show which will
be seen in Assembly Hall Friday
evening. In the second part of the
performance, R. H. Worsley, '11, will
appear in an electrical dance. Two
original songs, entitled respectively
"Spoon" and "nine," which were ac
cepted by the Orpheum circuit when
Worsley contemplated entering vau
deville, will be rendered by the com
poser.
Burlesques will make many of the
features of the show. "The Col
legians' Busy Day" is the name of
a skit in which S. C. Bias, '09, E.
O. Billwiller, '09, and N. Taylor, '10,
will appear. Another burlesque,
called "Op'ra," will be put on by
A. D. Hughes, 'OS, C. Rand, '10, H.
E. Reed, '10, and T. A. Deßolt, '10.
P. X. Hartzell, ex-'O7, will give a
German dialect song accompanied by
a clog.
The minstrel show proper will
have forty men in the semi-circle,
arranged in three tiers. The orches
tra will be seated in the pit owing
to the fact that, the sound will not
carry so well from the stage. The
jokes and local hits have been se
leeted and care taken that no ad
verse criticism can be aroused by
any part, of the show. Tickets have
been selling rapidly.
