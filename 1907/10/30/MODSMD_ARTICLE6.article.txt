# Plans For Golf Tournament.
## 
### 
Negotiations are now under way
between the University Golf Club
and the Menlo Golf and Country
Club for the use of the latter's links
at Fair Oaks. Owing to the poor
condition of Reservoir Field it is
deemed impossible to use the campus
course for the men's scratch cham
pionship tournament which will be
gin next Monday.
