# UNIVERSITY NEEDS CASH
## Money necessary to pay EMPLOYEES On Campus. Encina Men Are Asked To Pay Roomrent in Coin.—Rule Is Not Absolute. 
### 
• "On account of bank conditions,
students are requested to pay their
rents in casli only."
In explanation of this notice, which
was posted in Enciiia Hall this morn
ing, Treasurei' Charles G. Lathrop
states that in case students are un
able to obtain currency from the
banks, personal checks, drawn on lo
cal institutions for the amount due
for rent, will be accepted.
The request for money payments
was made with the purpose of se
curing- cash with which to pay the
University employees to whom, un
der the present circumstances, checks
would be of little value.
The local financial situation re
mains practically unchanged except
that the banks are doing business un
der the legal holiday privilege which
permits them to refuse to honor de
positors' checks. In general the
slate of affairs points to an early re
turn to normal conditions. The May
field bank and the Bank of Palo Al
to are cashing depositors' checks for
ordinary amounts, but the First Na
tional of Palo Alto is paying its cus
tomers only small amounts of cash.
The situation is clearly summar
ized in a statement issued by the
Bank of Palo Alto this afternoon.
It is as follows:
The financial horizon is very much
clearer today than it has been dur
ing the past week. The proclama
tion of a series of holidays by our
Governor has already had the effect,
of allaying the feeling of anxiety
and people generally have resolved
to make the best of the situation
by awaiting patiently until the East
ern situation, which is directly and
wholly the cause of our Western
predicament, has assumed a normal
state.
Western banks, in their concerted
action in paying in clearing house
certificates, are simply following in
the footsteps of all Eastern banks
where the system has been in force
since the beginning >of the stock
market excitement. The whole idea
in this action is for the purpose of
encouraging among individuals the
meeting of all legitimate obligations
with checks and drafts rather than
coin, thereby avoiding the hoarding
up and withdrawal from circulation
of the actual cash, the general sup
ply of which is temporarily low.
It. is in this respect only, of being
unable to secure cash on outside
checks and drafts handled that local
banks are affected. As soon as the
situation generally begins to clear
up, and the East is already assuming
the normal, and we are able to ob
tain cash from our Eastern and Wes
tern correspondents, business will
again drop into Its natural channels.
In the meantime we are taldng care
of our customers and their business.
C. S. DOWNING,
Cashier of the Bank of Palo Alto.
