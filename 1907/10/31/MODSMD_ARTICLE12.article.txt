# New Rules For Columbia Engineers.
## 
### 
Columbia has introduced into its
engineering department a system
known as the "identical first year,"
by which all engineering freshmen
take exactly the same elementary
courses. After that the student may
choose the branch of engineering in
which he desires to specialize. This
plan gives the student a chance to
become acquainted with all branches
oL engineering before he chooses his
specialty. It also tends to prevent
the second and third year students
from changing their major depart
ments.
Columbia has also ruled that no
student can obtain a diploma who
has not taken a six-weeks' course
in the summer school.
