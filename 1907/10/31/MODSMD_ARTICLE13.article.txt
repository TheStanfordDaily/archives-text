# California Trip To Del Monte Lost.
## 
### 
The trip of the California football
team to Del Monte has been given
up on account of the opposition of
a faculty committee, which invoked
against it the old rule that no team
should be off the campus for more
than 24 hours at a time. President
Wheeler had given his consent to
the breaking of this rule, as has
been done many times before, but
the faculty felt that >the players'
studies would suffer from the pro
posed trip.
