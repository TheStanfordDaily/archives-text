### 
At a meeting of the Freshman
Class this afternoon a committee of
five, consisting of R. Woodworth, B.
W. Lee, F. H. Hilton, C. K. Bad
ger and L. L. Hill, was appointed
to look into the advisability of a
Freshman smoker or jolly-up. The
matter was looked upon with favor
by a majority of the class.
Acting upon the advice of "Dad"
Moulton, President Wheeler urged
every man of the class who can pos
sibly do so, to get out for fall track
work in anticipation of the Inter
collegiate Freshman meet which will
be held next spring. The sentiment
was generally expressed that a
stronger representation of girls
should be present at the class meet
ings.
