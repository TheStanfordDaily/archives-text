Captain Hagood of the Coast Ar
tillery has made a report to the War
Department which shows that stu
dents are not attracted by a fighting
life. He wrote to 125 of the princi
pal colleges, asking for the names of
graduates who desired appointments
as second lieutenants, and did not
get a single reply. In consequence,
the number of commissioned officers
i.s now alarmingly below its proper
strength.
