# HICKEY WRITES OF MEET
## P. A. A. OFFICIAL EXPECTS STANFORD TO DO WELL. Handicaps Will be Announced Tomorrow and Great Contest Is Assured. 
### 
There is no doubt that the Pacific
Athletic Association track meet, to
be held on the Berkeley track on
Saturday afternoon, will be a great.
I contest and the Stanford men who
j compete will have to perform up to
their best ability to be among the
! point winners. J. It. Hickey, ex
| '08, and Douglas Erskine have done
the handicapping which will be an
nounced tomorrow. Hickey will be
clerk of the course, and in writing
of the prospects for the meet on Sat-
I urday makes the following state
] ment:
"One hundred and thirty athletes
i not including the relay runners make
Jup the aggregation of competitors
1 who will try for honors in the annu
al fall handicap meet under the aus
pices of the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation to be held on the University
o! California cinder path on Satur-
I day afternoon. California will be
i represented by a total of fifty en
j tries including many varsity men
! and most of the freshmen with the
| exception of those on the football
J team.
Forrest Stanton, captain of the
Blue and Gold team, has just return
ed to Berkeley and although not.
registered in college will run for the
state university. Stanton has enter
j ed in the sprints and the low hurdles
|—a new event for him. The Olym
j pic Club team will be strong, includ
; ing Powell, Cheek and Vogelman.
: GJarner, Gilmore and Gerhardt will
I make their first appearance since
the Jamestown championships, the
last two now being junior American
champions. O. F. Snedigar will not
j rt'ii owing to the injury he received
in the football game while playing
with the Barbarians against Stan
ford.
In awarding the handicaps the
committee has acted entirely on the
best performance made by the dif
ferent athletes and has placed the
novices to good advantage, as the
prime object of a handicap meet is
to give the less experienced and
younger athletes a chance in the
company of the champions. Stanford
seems to have a good hold on the
pole-vault honors with the four en
j tries, Lanagan, Bellah, Scott and Ko
cher, although Bull and Sheridan
are taking to the event with consid
erable improvement. Zoph and
Schultz, point winners in the last,
varsity meet are no longer in col
lege.
In the hurdles Horton will be in the
company of Powell and Cheek, and
will have a good chance to show
what, he can do after his long lay
off. Bradford will start with Kel
ly, the Webster Club miler, who ran
at Stanford in the Olympic-Stanford
meet last year. Glarner is entered
in this event, and will probably start
i at scratch as he believes he can win
from either of these runners.
In the sprints Scott should show
well with Vogelman, Stanton, and
Gerhardt. He has been handicapped
accordingly. Gilmore will be Mor
ton's most dangerous rival in the
shot-put although Harrold, the Ber
keley High shot-putter, is doing well
with the sixteen-pound weight.
The Columbia Park Boys' Club
Band, composed of thirty pieces, will
give a concert on the bleachers dur
ing the field-day. A. G. Spaulding
& Co. has donated a valuable tro
phy for the relay race and the Re
liance Club of Oakland lias donated
a magnificent silver cup to be award
ed to the team making the largest
number of points.
Gold, silver and bronze medals
will be given by the association to
the men taking first, second and
third, respectively. The Berkeley
High relay team, which is without
doubt one of the fastest seen in high
school athletics in recent years, will
run against the university and club
teams. This team won the Bay
Counties and Academic field-days,
breaking the record for a six-man re
lay in the last A. A. L. meet.
Entries have been received from
both the universities, Berkeley, Lick,
Lowell, Wilmerding, and Oakland
high schools, the Olympic Club,
Stockton Athletic Club, Webster
Club, Siaplamat Indians and St. Ig
natius College.

shot-put although Harrold, the Ber
keley High shot-putter, is doing well
with the sixteen-pound weight.
The Columbia Park Boys' Club
Band, composed of thirty pieces, will
give a concert on the bleachers dur
ing the field-day. A. G. Spaulding
& Co. has donated a valuable tro
phy for the relay race and the Re
liance Club of Oakland lias donated
a magnificent silver cup to be award
ed to the team making the largest
number of points.
Gold, silver and bronze medals
will be given by the association to
the men taking first, second and
third, respectively. The Berkeley
High relay team, which is without
doubt one of the fastest seen in high
school athletics in recent years, will
run against the university and club
teams. This team won the Bay
Counties and Academic field-days,
breaking the record for a six-man re
lay in the last A. A. L. meet.
Entries have been received from
both the universities, Berkeley, Lick,
Lowell, Wilmerding, and Oakland
high schools, the Olympic Club,
Stockton Athletic Club, Webster
Club, Siaplamat Indians and St. Ig
natius College.
There is no doubt that the Pacific
Athletic Association track meet, to
be held on the Berkeley track on
Saturday afternoon, will be a great.
I contest and the Stanford men who
j compete will have to perform up to
their best ability to be among the
! point winners. J. It. Hickey, ex
| '08, and Douglas Erskine have done
the handicapping which will be an
nounced tomorrow. Hickey will be
clerk of the course, and in writing
of the prospects for the meet on Sat-
I urday makes the following state
] ment:
"One hundred and thirty athletes
i not including the relay runners make
Jup the aggregation of competitors
1 who will try for honors in the annu
al fall handicap meet under the aus
pices of the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation to be held on the University
o! California cinder path on Satur-
I day afternoon. California will be
i represented by a total of fifty en
j tries including many varsity men
! and most of the freshmen with the
| exception of those on the football
J team.
Forrest Stanton, captain of the
Blue and Gold team, has just return
ed to Berkeley and although not.
registered in college will run for the
state university. Stanton has enter
j ed in the sprints and the low hurdles
|—a new event for him. The Olym
j pic Club team will be strong, includ
; ing Powell, Cheek and Vogelman.
: GJarner, Gilmore and Gerhardt will
I make their first appearance since
the Jamestown championships, the
last two now being junior American
champions. O. F. Snedigar will not
j rt'ii owing to the injury he received
in the football game while playing
with the Barbarians against Stan
ford.
In awarding the handicaps the
committee has acted entirely on the
best performance made by the dif
ferent athletes and has placed the
novices to good advantage, as the
prime object of a handicap meet is
to give the less experienced and
younger athletes a chance in the
company of the champions. Stanford
seems to have a good hold on the
pole-vault honors with the four en
j tries, Lanagan, Bellah, Scott and Ko
cher, although Bull and Sheridan
are taking to the event with consid
erable improvement. Zoph and
Schultz, point winners in the last,
varsity meet are no longer in col
lege.
In the hurdles Horton will be in the
company of Powell and Cheek, and
will have a good chance to show
what, he can do after his long lay
off. Bradford will start with Kel
ly, the Webster Club miler, who ran
at Stanford in the Olympic-Stanford
meet last year. Glarner is entered
in this event, and will probably start
i at scratch as he believes he can win
from either of these runners.
In the sprints Scott should show
well with Vogelman, Stanton, and
Gerhardt. He has been handicapped
accordingly. Gilmore will be Mor
ton's most dangerous rival in the
shot-put although Harrold, the Ber
keley High shot-putter, is doing well
with the sixteen-pound weight.
