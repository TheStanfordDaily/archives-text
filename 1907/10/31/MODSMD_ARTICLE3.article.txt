# BIG GAME TO BE CLOSE
## "BLUE AND GOLD SHOULD LOSE," SAY VANCOUVER MEN. Cardinal Backfield Far Superior To California's.â€” Forwards Evenly Matched. 
### 
That the Intercollegiate game 011
the ninth of November will be an ex
citing and closely contested match
is the general opinion of the various
members of the Vancouver team.
The Northerners are in excellent po
sition to judge of the relative merits
of the Cardinal and the Blue and
Gold, and they seem to agree that
at present, honors are almost even,
and that any slight advantage that
does exist rests with Stanford.
Coach R. P. Woodward, who is a
noted Rugby expert, had the follow
ing to say concerning the two fif
teens: "Before* forming a decided
opinion on the outcome of the In
tercollegiate game I would like to
see the Cardinal team in action once
again. Now, however, it seems to
me like a stand-off. The Califor
nia backs will be outplayed, but her
forwards will surely cause great
damage. The result depends entire
ly on the ability of the Stanford
scrum men to hold their own
against such heavy and aggressive
opponents."
Following is a. statement made by
Captain Springer: "I think that the
men from across the bay will be de
feated, but only after a hard, fierce
struggle. The playing of the Car
dinal backs is very fine, while the
opposing packs will be about, even.
California has great weight in the
forward division, but Stanford's
scrum is faster. It, will be a wonder
ful battle."
C. Simpson, the Queensland ex
pert, said: "Honors are almost even,
but I think Lanagan and Presley's
team will come out. ahead. The Blue
and Gold forwards are a dangerous
lot, hut their advantage will be more
than offset, by the Cardinal backs,
who put up a remarkable game. I
was very much surprised at their
extremely high-class work."
The words of Five-eighth John
ston follow: "The game is going to
be very close, but T expect to hear
that Stanford won. All the Cardinal
forwards have to do is to break even
with the California pack, and then
that, fast and spectacular set of
backs will do the rest. They will
cause no end of trouble to the Blue
and Gold."
