The authorities wish it generally
understood that Ihe statement post
ed in Encina Hall in regard to the
payment oi' room-rent in cash was
not aimed to work a hardship on
the men living in the dormitory and
is not a rigid rule which will be en
forced against those who are unable
to obtain coin. The action was ren
dered necessary, as is stated in ano
ther column of tonight's issue, by
a lack of ready money with which
to pay the University employees. In
case cash cannot be secured by any
resident of the Hall checks on bona
fide deposits will be accepted at the
office. Such checks must be made
out only for the amount due the
office.
During this period of money strin
gency a co-operation between stu
dents and authorities is absolutely
necessary. Those men who have the
available cash should be willing
to assist the University by paying
their rent with it. In return, the men
who are unable, while the present
financial crisis lasts, to cash or draw
on outside drafts, have the right to
expect that they will be dealt with
leniently. To fine or cancel the reg
istration of any man in such circum
stances for non-payment of rent
would be as absurd as it would be
unjust.
