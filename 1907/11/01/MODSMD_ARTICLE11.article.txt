The students who are attempting
to obtain cash from the banks un
der false representations and when
they do not absolutely need it may
take warning from the statements
made by the local institutions today.
Unless this practice is stopped the
banks will be forced to return to a
percentage basis of payment. If this
action is taken it will work no end
of hardship on those who actually
need cash and a little thought in the
matter should convince the offenders
that it is to their own advantage
as well as that of others to withdraw
as little ns is possible under the cir
cumstances.
