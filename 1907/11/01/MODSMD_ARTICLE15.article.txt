# Michigan Students Organize Courts.
## 
### 
The associated students of Michi-
J gan University have made an agree
ment with the chief of police of Ann
Arbor, whereby they will organize a
court, and all students charged with
minor offenses will be turned over
| to them for trial and punishment.
: President Angell will guarantee the
i enforcement of the court's decisions,
! and it is expected that the students
i will be more in fear of their own tri
j bunal than of the town's authori
j ties.
