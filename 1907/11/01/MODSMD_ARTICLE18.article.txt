# Drainage of Felt Lake To Begin.
## 
### 
The siphon that has been built to
drain Felt Lake is now in running
order and the first water went
through it yesterday morning. Four
pipes, four inches in diameter, were
built over the northern embankment
ol' the lake and these will be sup
plemented by five more of the same
size, so that, by Wednesday next, it
i' ; hoped to have the equivalent of a
thirty-six-inch continuous stream
running out of the reservoir.
No statement has been made as
to when the lake will be dry, but
with the original depth of twenty
eight feet of water taken into con
sideration, the siphon will have to
be used for several weeks before the
drainage can be completed.
