# TO REGULATE VEHICLES
## CARRIAGES MAY NOT DRIVE TO FIELD NOVEMBER 9. Making Grounds Ready For Game. Hooters Will Be Seated In Aisles Of Stanford Section. 
### 
Stringent regulations will be en
forced the day of the big game to
avoid a. congestion of vehicles upon
the approaches to Stanford Field.
No automobiles or carriages of any
description will be allowed to pro
ceed past the intersection of the au
t tomobile road and main drive lead
, ing to the field. At this point all
I vehicles will be stopped and passen
gers discharged. The automobiles of
visitors will be allowed to enter the
Campus from the county road via
the automobile highway, but will be
turned off at the upper end of the
roadway by a fence which will be
I
| erected.
The Faculty club house grounds
are to be converted into an open
air garage and a competent man en
gaged to take care of all machines.
1 All automobiles must be left there.
When leaving the Campus the mot
oring parties must use the Embarca
! dero road to avoid conflict with the
crowds of pedestrians and carriages
which will be centered about the
! regular exit.
The remaining seats for the big
game will be placed on sale for $2.50
and any rooters desiring to purchase
tickets now will be given an admis
| sion ticket and seated in the aisles
1 oT the rooting section. This plan
' has been adopted to do away with
i the break in the appearance of the
section which would otherwise re
sult if the aisles were not filled.
Some provision will be made to raise
the level of the aisles to that of the
; tiers of seats.
A corps oL* workmen employed by
the University are engaged today in
clearing up the grounds in the vic
inity of the field and will trim the
trees and have everything in order
before Saturday next. A new press
box for the use of all newspaper men
is being built on the shady side of
| the field.
