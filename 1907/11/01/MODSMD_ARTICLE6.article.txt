; Stanford athletes will leave on the
9:31 train tomorrow morning for
Berkeley, where (hey are to com
i pete in the Pacific Athletic Associa
1 tion handicap track meet. The fol
lowing men will make the trip and
are entered in the meet: Captain
| Lanagan, (jÂ»8, R. A. Kocher, '08,
; E. C. Sterling, 'OS, H. L. Horton, "OS,
E. A. McGregor, '08, A. E. Roth, '09,
C. B. Bradford, '09, B. L. Gregg,
'09, E. O. Billwiller, '09, D. G. Mar
tin, '10, S. H. Bellah, '10, L. Scott,
'10, M. P. Youker, '10, E. C. Temple
1 ton, '10, W. M. Wvman, '11, and

There are more than one hundred
land thirty entries and all the best
athletes around the bay will be seen
in competition tomorrow afternoon.
! The handicaps have been announced
and the only scratch man from Stan
ford is Captain Lanagan in the pole
j vault.
In this event the other Stanford
entries have the following handi
' cpps: Kocher 6 inches, Bellah 7
j inches, and Scott 10 inches. This
' should prove the best event of the
day for the Stanford team as all
these men figure very well with oth
i er men entered.
H. L. Horton, '08, is entered in
I both hurdles and the shot-put, and
j should certainly be a point-winner in
| these events. In the shot-put Gil
| more, of California, is the scratch
man and Horton has a handicap of
two feet which promises to make
him a serious rival for the Califor
nian, although Balzari, another Blue
i and Gold entry, with a handicap of
seven feet, may prove a dangerous
competitor.
In the high hurdles, Cheek and
Powell, former California stars, are
the scratch men and Horton has re
ceived a handicap of two yards.
Cheek is the scratch man in the low
hurdles and Horton has a handicap
oi two and a half yards, while Pow
ell is given one yard on Cheek. This
event, on account of the small han
dicap, is practically an even break
between these three hurdlers and
Horton will have to be at his best
to get a place.
Stanton, th" star sprinter at Cali
fornia, is entered in the hurdles for
the first time, and has received a
handicap of seven yards in the low
and eight yards in the high. B. L.
Gregg, '09, has a handicap of four
yards in the low hurdles.
Gerliardt, of the Olympic Club, is
the scratch man in the 100-yard
dash in which Scott has a handicap
of three and a half yards and E. O.
Billwiller, '09, receives four yards.
A. E. Roth, '09, is the only Stan
ford entry in the 220-yard dash, and
he has a handicap of six yards. How
ever, in his heat he meets Glarner,
who has a nine-yard handicap, which
will make Roth extend himself. In
the 440-yard dash Stanford is repre-
I sen ted by \V. M. Wyman, '11, with i
a fourteen-yard handicap, and Roth,
with seventeen yards over Glarner,
(he scratch man.
Gilmore is at scratch in ihe ham
liner throw, and M. P. Youker, *10, i
| lias a handicap of twenty feet. In j
the high jump Powell is scratch
man and Sterling has a handicap of !
j two inches, while D. G. Martin, '10,
and G. A. Waring, '11, are given
j four inches. Martin, should prove a
point winner with this handicap if i
he jumps up to his recent form.
Cheek is scratch man in the broad i
| jump and Scott has a handicap of
four inches, while Bellah is given
fifteen inches on Cheek. In the
mile Stanford will be represented
by three men, Bradford, who has ten
yards, E. A. McGregor, fifty yards,
and E. C. Templeton, eighty yards.
The scratch men are Kelly, of the
Webster Athletic Club, and Glarner,
of the Olympic Club.
Although the Stanford team is not
in the best possible condition, it is
a strong aggregation and they may
be expected to win points in several
events.
