# SECOND VANCOUVER GAME
## VARSITY PLAYS NORTHERNERS TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Visitors Will Have Stronger Fifteen in the Field.—Change In Cardinal Line-up. 
### 
The second and last game of the
International series between the
Vancouver and Varsity fifteens will
be played on Stanford Field tomor
row afternoon, commencing at 3:30
j o'clock. The visitors will be repre
\ stilted by a stronger team than that
j of Wednesday, and consequently the
contest should be much closer. An
| effort is being made to secure the
; services of H. R. Elliott, of the Bar
barians, as referee, and this will in
: sure a fast game. The admission
will be fifty cents.
In regard to Saturday's match,
| Captain Springer, of the British Col
umbia team, said: "Our line-up will
be far more formidable tomorrow,
and although we are not over con
j fident of victory, we expect to make
a better showing than we did Wed
nesday. Stanford will have a hard
; fight to win, at least."
The Vancouver players indulged
in light practice this morning, and
Manager Knupp arranged for them
J to take a drive during the early part
:of the afternoon. At four o'clock
j they attended a reception tendered
| them by Dr. Gardner.
Only light work was held for the
Varsity squad yesterday afternoon,
and the forwards who played in
Wednesday's game were excused
J from all practice.
The line-up of the Cardinal
fifteen has been changed but
i little. Thorpe will be able to
J participate in the contest, as his
| shoulder is in good condition once
! again. Cadwalader will be given a
' chance at second five-eighth in place
of Gnnong, and Brown will be seen
at full. Owen, who made such a
creditable showing in the first game
| with Vancouver will be played at
wing, and Vandervoort will be at
center. Captain Koerner and Reed
are still on the injury list and will
be forced to remain on the side lines.
Koerner's ankle, however, is not
causing him much trouble, and he
will probably be able to fill bis old
position in the front rank by the
beginning of the coming week. Reed
also should be able to play again in
the course of the next few days.
The line-up follows:
Stanford—Rhyne, Terrill, Min
turn, Pemberton, Crawford, Thorpe,
Miller, forwards; Mayers, wing for
ward; Fenton, half; Mitchell, Cad
walader, fives; Vandervoort, center;
Owen, Holman, wings; Brown, full.
Vancouver —• Stafford, .lewett,
Dunn, Metcalfe, Loftus, Springer,
Maconaghy, forwards; Bajus, wing
forward; Newcombe, half; Lawson,
Johnston, fives; Simpson, center;
Flood, Murray, wings; Bull, full.
