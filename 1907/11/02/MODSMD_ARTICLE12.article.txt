# MINSTRELS A SUCCESS
## LARGE AUDIENCE ENJOYS SHOW IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Production Staged By Musical clubs a Creditable Performance. Hartzell Makes Hit. 
### 
The Stanford Minstrels, as pre
sented by the Combined Musical
Clubs, were given last night in As
sembly Hall before a large and ap
preciative audience of undergradu
ates and Palo Alto residents. Open
ing with the"House of Mirth," the
"Grouch Dispellers" and individual
performers, supplemented by chorus
work upon the part of the entire
Glee Club, drew rounds of applause
from the audience. The jokes and
joshes had plenty of snap and had
enough colloquialism to add interest.
"My Jacqueminot," by Maxwell Ves
tal, '08,"Who, Me?" by "Brad" Brad
ford, '09, "My Dear," by Leader J.
J. Hill. '08, "All I Get Is Much
Obliged," by "Cy" Happy, '10. "I
Would Live or I Would Die For
"Sou," by E. L. Coffin. '11, "Dat's
Music to Me," by P. N. Hartzell, ex
'o7. and the "Sweetest Story Ever
Told," by the Cardinal Four, were
the song hits of the first part of the
program.
The"House of Mirth" showed
more finished work than the rest of
the program. The ragged edges
common to amateur performances
were noticeably lacking and the act
ing of the men behind the footlights
would have done credit to any ama
teur troupe.
In the second division of the pro
gram the parts fell more to individ
uals than to any organization as a
body. "The Man Who Makes YOu
Laugh," by Phil Hartzell, was a dis
tinct hit and drew several encores.
"The Musical Tramp," as taken by
R. F. Worsley, '11, together with a
clever electric dance, "Wedding of
the Winds," by the Mandolin Club,
and "Op'ra," a musical burlesque,
were well received and in keeping
with the tone of the performance.
