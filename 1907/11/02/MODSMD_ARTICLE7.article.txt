# CLOSE, FIERCE STRUGGLE
## FINAL PRELIMINARY CONTEST ENDS WITH SCORE. Result of Match Always In Doubt. Hardest Work Devolves Upon Opposing Forwards. 
### 
Stanford took the second
gaino from Vancouver today
after a battle royal on the
home grounds. The tinai score
stood 3 to and represents
one of the hardest fought Rug
by battles ever seen on the
Coast. Vancouver scored on
Simpson's pretty kick early in
the lirst half, and Stanford's
points came from Pembertoii's
try and Fenton's goal toward
the* end of the second period.

The final preliminary contest be
fore the Intercollegiate match with
the Blue and Gold was hard-fought
and exciting throughout. The super
ior forward work of the Northern
ers kept the ball in the loose dur
ing most of the play, the backs hav
ing little to do. This deprived the
game of much of the spectacular ele
ment, but this was more than off
set by the extreme closeness of the
contest. The result was in doubt
until the pistol cracked.
Fenton and Brown played admir
ably after the first few minutes had
elapsed. Their accurate kicking
many times put an end to the fierce
onslaughts of the Vancouver pack.
Miller, Thorpe and Crawford showed
up well in the scrum both on the
offense and defense. The entire for
ward division did commendable
work against their strong opponents.
Detail Play.
Crawford kicked off. The ball
was returned to the center of the
field where the play was character
ised by hard rushes and punting
duels. Brown was forced to toucn
down. After the drop-out a pass
ing rush of 50 yards was made by
Y'andervoort, Mayers, Mitchell and
Owen, the latter only being stopped
by Simpson on Vancouver's 5-yard
line. A free kick to the visitors
sent the ball out of danger. Ex
ceedingly fierce dribbling followed
it, which the Cardinal forwards
showed up to better advantage than
at any time heretofore this sea
son. The work of Crawford and Mil
ler was especially conspicuous.
The Northerners were kept on the
defensive constantly. The Stanford
scrum, however, was unable to get
the ball out to the backs. The Car
dinal pack finally forced the ball on
their opponents' 15-yard line but the
advantage was only temporary. Van
couver rushed swiftly down the
field and the play settled around
the Cardinal 30-yard line. Here an
< Aside play gave the visitors a free
kick on the 45-yard line and Simp
son scored a beautiful goal, net
ting his team the first three points
o' the game. Score, Vancouver
Stanford 0.
At this period of the game th-*
off-side plays and knock-ons of th
Cardinal team were all too frequeni
&ud many penalty scrums and Ire :
kicks resulted. For several raiantes
the ball remained near I\e center
of the field, but the visitors soon
! ushed the pigskin into Stanford's
territory. Fenton touched down an J
several line-outs, dangerously near
the Cardinal goal, followed. Fen
ton relieved with a brilliant kick to
touch at mid-field. A fast passing
rush by Mitchell and Owen, which
threatened to score, was interrupted
by an off-side play. Stanford's for
wards dribbled accurately down the
field only to be stopped within a
few yards of the goal line. A free
kick was given to Vancouver and
time was called as the ball went into
tor.ch. Score at end of first halt,
Vancouver 3, Stanford 0.
No changes were made in the line
up of the Stanford team at half
time, as it was agreed before the
game that substitutes would he al
lowed to replace only injured men.
The second period of the game
was begun by Simpson kicking off
for Vancouver. An exciting drib
bling play kept the ball in Vancou
ver's territory. The aggressive play
of the British Columbia pack was
interrupted by Fenton kicking into
touch on Vancouver's 4 8-yard line.
The Stanford backs were prevented
from executing any spectacular play
by the extreme cleverness and su
periority of the visiting squad. A
slight injury to Miller delayed the
game for a few minutes.
On the resumption of play an at
tempt fit goal from a free placement
kick was unsuccessful. At. this point
tlie match was robbed of no lit
tle interest by the frequent penalties
inflicted by Referee Elliott. The ball
r< mained in Vancouver's territory.
Two spectacular runs bv Vander
voort and Fenton which would

have undoubtedly resulted iu scores
were interrupted by forward passes.
Again a forward pass interrupted
the excitement. Twice the Cardinal
succeeded in rushing the ball into
their opponents' territory, but each
time free kicks brought the pigskin
near mid-field. A short kick took
I I lie ball close to Vancouver's goal.
A five-yard scrum was followed by
Pemberton carrying the ball over
the line for the first try. Fenton
converted. Score, Stanford 5, Van
couver 3.
After the kick-off tlie visitors rap
idly rushed to Stanford's 12-yard
line hut Fenton's kick to touch re
lieved . A brilliant rush by the Car
dinal threatened the Northerners'
goal but the Vancouver backs got
the ball out of danger and steadily
rushed the whole length of the
field. A try was averted only by
Brown's clever work in falling on
the pigskin when it rolled over the
line. A few minutes later the Var
sity's goal was again threatened by
the Vancouver forwards. Bull's at
tempt to drop-kick from the 37-yard
line failed by a narrow margin.
A drop-out resulted and the ball
remained near the center of the
field from then until the end of the
game. Final score, Stanford 5, Van
couver 3.
Towards the end of the last half
Cadwalader received a painful hurt
to his already injured shoulder, and
he will probably be unable to play
again this season. Cadwalader was
replaced by Ganong.

Stanford took the second
gaino from Vancouver today
after a battle royal on the
home grounds. The tinai score
stood 3 to and represents
one of the hardest fought Rug
by battles ever seen on the
Coast. Vancouver scored on
Simpson's pretty kick early in
the lirst half, and Stanford's
points came from Pembertoii's
try and Fenton's goal toward
the* end of the second period.

The final preliminary contest be
fore the Intercollegiate match with
the Blue and Gold was hard-fought
and exciting throughout. The super
ior forward work of the Northern
ers kept the ball in the loose dur
ing most of the play, the backs hav
ing little to do. This deprived the
game of much of the spectacular ele
ment, but this was more than off
set by the extreme closeness of the
contest. The result was in doubt
until the pistol cracked.
Fenton and Brown played admir
ably after the first few minutes had
elapsed. Their accurate kicking
many times put an end to the fierce
onslaughts of the Vancouver pack.
Miller, Thorpe and Crawford showed
up well in the scrum both on the
offense and defense. The entire for
ward division did commendable
work against their strong opponents.
Detail Play.
Crawford kicked off. The ball
was returned to the center of the
field where the play was character
ised by hard rushes and punting
duels. Brown was forced to toucn
down. After the drop-out a pass
ing rush of 50 yards was made by
Y'andervoort, Mayers, Mitchell and
Owen, the latter only being stopped
by Simpson on Vancouver's 5-yard
line. A free kick to the visitors
sent the ball out of danger. Ex
ceedingly fierce dribbling followed
it, which the Cardinal forwards
showed up to better advantage than
at any time heretofore this sea
son. The work of Crawford and Mil
ler was especially conspicuous.
The Northerners were kept on the
defensive constantly. The Stanford
scrum, however, was unable to get
the ball out to the backs. The Car
dinal pack finally forced the ball on
their opponents' 15-yard line but the
advantage was only temporary. Van
couver rushed swiftly down the
field and the play settled around
the Cardinal 30-yard line. Here an
< Aside play gave the visitors a free
kick on the 45-yard line and Simp
son scored a beautiful goal, net
ting his team the first three points
o' the game. Score, Vancouver
Stanford 0.
At this period of the game th-*
off-side plays and knock-ons of th
Cardinal team were all too frequeni
&ud many penalty scrums and Ire :
kicks resulted. For several raiantes
the ball remained near I\e center
of the field, but the visitors soon
! ushed the pigskin into Stanford's
territory. Fenton touched down an J
several line-outs, dangerously near
the Cardinal goal, followed. Fen
ton relieved with a brilliant kick to
touch at mid-field. A fast passing
rush by Mitchell and Owen, which
threatened to score, was interrupted
by an off-side play. Stanford's for
wards dribbled accurately down the
field only to be stopped within a
few yards of the goal line. A free
kick was given to Vancouver and
time was called as the ball went into
tor.ch. Score at end of first halt,
Vancouver 3, Stanford 0.
No changes were made in the line
up of the Stanford team at half
time, as it was agreed before the
game that substitutes would he al
lowed to replace only injured men.
The second period of the game
was begun by Simpson kicking off
for Vancouver. An exciting drib
bling play kept the ball in Vancou
ver's territory. The aggressive play
of the British Columbia pack was
interrupted by Fenton kicking into
touch on Vancouver's 4 8-yard line.
The Stanford backs were prevented
from executing any spectacular play
by the extreme cleverness and su
periority of the visiting squad. A
slight injury to Miller delayed the
game for a few minutes.
On the resumption of play an at
tempt fit goal from a free placement
kick was unsuccessful. At. this point
tlie match was robbed of no lit
tle interest by the frequent penalties
inflicted by Referee Elliott. The ball
r< mained in Vancouver's territory.
Two spectacular runs bv Vander
voort and Fenton which would

have undoubtedly resulted iu scores
were interrupted by forward passes.
Again a forward pass interrupted
the excitement. Twice the Cardinal
succeeded in rushing the ball into
their opponents' territory, but each
time free kicks brought the pigskin
near mid-field. A short kick took
I I lie ball close to Vancouver's goal.
A five-yard scrum was followed by
Pemberton carrying the ball over
the line for the first try. Fenton
converted. Score, Stanford 5, Van
couver 3.
After the kick-off tlie visitors rap
idly rushed to Stanford's 12-yard
line hut Fenton's kick to touch re
lieved . A brilliant rush by the Car
dinal threatened the Northerners'
goal but the Vancouver backs got
the ball out of danger and steadily
rushed the whole length of the
field. A try was averted only by
Brown's clever work in falling on
the pigskin when it rolled over the
line. A few minutes later the Var
sity's goal was again threatened by
the Vancouver forwards. Bull's at
tempt to drop-kick from the 37-yard
line failed by a narrow margin.
A drop-out resulted and the ball
remained near the center of the
field from then until the end of the
game. Final score, Stanford 5, Van
couver 3.
Towards the end of the last half
Cadwalader received a painful hurt
to his already injured shoulder, and
he will probably be unable to play
again this season. Cadwalader was
replaced by Ganong.
