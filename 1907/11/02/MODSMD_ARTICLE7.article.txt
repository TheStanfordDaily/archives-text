# CLOSE, FIERCE STRUGGLE
## FINAL PRELIMINARY CONTEST ENDS WITH SCORE. Result of Match Always In Doubt. Hardest Work Devolves Upon Opposing Forwards. 
### 
Stanford took the second
gaino from Vancouver today
after a battle royal on the
home grounds. The tinai score
stood 3 to and represents
one of the hardest fought Rug
by battles ever seen on the
Coast. Vancouver scored on
Simpson's pretty kick early in
the lirst half, and Stanford's
points came from Pembertoii's
try and Fenton's goal toward
the* end of the second period.

The final preliminary contest be
fore the Intercollegiate match with
the Blue and Gold was hard-fought
and exciting throughout. The super
ior forward work of the Northern
ers kept the ball in the loose dur
ing most of the play, the backs hav
ing little to do. This deprived the
game of much of the spectacular ele
ment, but this was more than off
set by the extreme closeness of the
contest. The result was in doubt
until the pistol cracked.
Fenton and Brown played admir
ably after the first few minutes had
elapsed. Their accurate kicking
many times put an end to the fierce
onslaughts of the Vancouver pack.
Miller, Thorpe and Crawford showed
up well in the scrum both on the
offense and defense. The entire for
ward division did commendable
work against their strong opponents.
Detail Play.
Crawford kicked off. The ball
was returned to the center of the
field where the play was character
ised by hard rushes and punting
duels. Brown was forced to toucn
down. After the drop-out a pass
ing rush of 50 yards was made by
Y'andervoort, Mayers, Mitchell and
Owen, the latter only being stopped
by Simpson on Vancouver's 5-yard
line. A free kick to the visitors
sent the ball out of danger. Ex
ceedingly fierce dribbling followed
it, which the Cardinal forwards
showed up to better advantage than
at any time heretofore this sea
son. The work of Crawford and Mil
ler was especially conspicuous.
The Northerners were kept on the
defensive constantly. The Stanford
scrum, however, was unable to get
the ball out to the backs. The Car
dinal pack finally forced the ball on
their opponents' 15-yard line but the
advantage was only temporary. Van
couver rushed swiftly down the
field and the play settled around
the Cardinal 30-yard line. Here an
< Aside play gave the visitors a free
kick on the 45-yard line and Simp
son scored a beautiful goal, net
ting his team the first three points
