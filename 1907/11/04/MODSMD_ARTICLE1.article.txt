# SCRATCH MEN DO NOT WIN
## HANDICAPS TOO LARGE FOR BEST ATHLETES. P.A.A. Meet at Berkeley Gives Rise To Many Good Performances. 
### 
The Pacific Athletic Association
handicap track meet held last Sat
urday was won by the University of
California team, which had by far
the largest number of entries, with
:».*» I-:; points, while Stanford with
a team of fifteen men, took second
place with 25 points. Captain F. R.
Lanagan, of the Stanford team, was
very well pleased with the showing
of the Stanford entries and in speak
ing of the meet said: "The men all
did fine work and I was perfectly
satisfied. Our four first-place win
ners Horton, McGregor, Martin and
You kef —all cjaptured their events
without the aid of their handicaps
and would have won had they been
at scratch. Several of the handi
caps were too large and this is shown
by the fact that not a single scratch
man took a first place, in the hur
dles Stanton, the California captain,
received a liberal handicap and won
both these events from more exper
ienced hurdlers. This is Stanton's
first appearance in the hurdles and
although he did not have particular
ly good form his speed and the han
dicap he received made him an easy
winner."
The pole-vault and broad jump
were both captured by men who had
received liberal handicaps and nei
ther Lanagan, Kocher nor Scott fig
ured. S. H. Bellah, however, was at
his best and cleared 11 feet, G inches,
but the event was taken by a Cali
fornia man who had a handicap of
16 inches and Bellah was forced to
be content with second place. Scott,
did well in the broad jump but the
handicaps were too' large and the ev
ent.was won "by a Berkeley high
school athlete. In the sprints the
handicaps were too much for Roth
and Scott, although they ran in good
form. The same applies to Wyman
in the quarter and this event was
won by a California runner who had
a 25-yard handicap. That, the handi
caps were a bit too liberal seems ev
ident from the fact that neither Olar
ner nor Gerhardt, the Olympic Club
crack runners, who have recently re
turned from Jamestown, took a first
place.

The Pacific Athletic Association
handicap track meet held last Sat
urday was won by the University of
California team, which had by far
the largest number of entries, with
:».*» I-:; points, while Stanford with
a team of fifteen men, took second
place with 25 points. Captain F. R.
Lanagan, of the Stanford team, was
very well pleased with the showing
of the Stanford entries and in speak
ing of the meet said: "The men all
did fine work and I was perfectly
satisfied. Our four first-place win
ners Horton, McGregor, Martin and
You kef —all cjaptured their events
without the aid of their handicaps
and would have won had they been
at scratch. Several of the handi
caps were too large and this is shown
by the fact that not a single scratch
man took a first place, in the hur
dles Stanton, the California captain,
received a liberal handicap and won
both these events from more exper
ienced hurdlers. This is Stanton's
first appearance in the hurdles and
although he did not have particular
ly good form his speed and the han
dicap he received made him an easy
winner."
The pole-vault and broad jump
were both captured by men who had
received liberal handicaps and nei
ther Lanagan, Kocher nor Scott fig
ured. S. H. Bellah, however, was at
his best and cleared 11 feet, G inches,
but the event was taken by a Cali
fornia man who had a handicap of
16 inches and Bellah was forced to
be content with second place. Scott,
did well in the broad jump but the
handicaps were too' large and the ev
ent.was won "by a Berkeley high
school athlete. In the sprints the
handicaps were too much for Roth
and Scott, although they ran in good
form. The same applies to Wyman
in the quarter and this event was
won by a California runner who had
a 25-yard handicap. That, the handi
caps were a bit too liberal seems ev
ident from the fact that neither Olar
ner nor Gerhardt, the Olympic Club
crack runners, who have recently re
turned from Jamestown, took a first
place.
