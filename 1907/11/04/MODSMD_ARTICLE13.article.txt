### 
Dr. Gardner preached on "The
I'se and Abuse ot' the Gift of Speech"
at the regular Sunday morning ser
\ ice in the Chapel. On this subject
he said in part:
"How dare any man bawl the
name of God in the chorus of the
chinking house? Why do gentlemen
use the name of the Saviour as a
term of exclamation? The name of
God is sacred because he is our cre
ator, our God and our Father. The
name of Christ is as dear to Christ
ians as the name of God.
"The most hardened skeptic bows
in reverence as he thinks of the
moral majesty, the tender pity, and
the loving kindness of the Christ of
Galilee. The good influences of the
University are not confined to the
Chapel or curriculum. I want to see
grow up in our fine little commun
ity an intelligent and consistent pub
lic opinion. I want to see the Stan
lord spirit express itself, not only
in assemblies and at rallies, but in
the refinement of whatever is wrong
ia manners and morals."
