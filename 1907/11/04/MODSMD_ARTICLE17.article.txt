# Minstrels Make Much Money for Trip
## 
### 
The gross receipts of the minstrel
show last Friday night amounted to
a little over $600. The expenses
are estimated at approximately $250
so that the Combined Musical Club-Â»
would net about $350 from the per
formance. There is already about
$75 in the treasury which the Com
bined Clubs received as their share
from the Palo Alto street carnival
lust September. The approximate
total of $425 goes toward defraying
the expenses of the northern tour
which the Combined Clubs will take
during the holidays.
