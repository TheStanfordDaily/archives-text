# EASTERN TRIP FOR CREW
## CHANCES ARE GOOD FOR EXTENDED TOUR. Multnomah Club Will Send a Four. Murphy Writes of Favorable Boating Outlook. 
### 
Prospects for an extended eastern
trip to be taken at the close of next,
semester by the Stanford crew look
e>ceedingly bright at the present
time. In a letter received from Dan
Murphy by F. W. Turner, '08, the
Stanford coach expresses himself as
being confident that such a trip
would be not only a very probable
but. a very successful venture, he
financial side of this trip will be
greatly aided by the Associated Mer
chants of the northern part of the
coast who believe that a successful
crew in the Poughkeepsie regatta
from this part of the country would
bo a strong advertisement for the
coming exposition to be held at Se
attle. In addition to this, the Boat
Club will be placed on a much firm
er footing by the proceeds that will
be devoted to it from the Senior
circus.
The Stanford eight will probably
be accompanied by tne Portland four,
representing the Multnomah Ath
letic Club. This four made a success
ful tour of the east, two years ago
and with the personnel intact hopes
to repeat the performance next
spring. The crews will try to ar
range a regatta with the University
of Wisconsin on their way to the
Atlantic Coast. A atop at this place
will break into the otherwise long
and tiresome journey across the con
tinent.
Murphy expresses himself us be
ing very confident of a championship
( lew for the coming season. He be
lieves that with the amount, of train
ing that, can be done after the first
of December, together with the num.
her of veteran oarsmen who will
take part in the work the Cardinal
men can easily offset the amount ol
work that Coach Garnett of Cali
fornia has been drilling injto bis
men during the past few weeks
