# LUTHER BURBANK HERE
## ADDRESSES CLASS IN BIONOMICS 8 THIS MORNING. Will Give Public Lecture in Chapel This Evening.—Has Many Lantern Slides. 
### 
Luther Burbank arrived on the
Campus last nighf, and lectured to
the class in Bionomics 8, at 10:15
this morning. It was expected that
h© would stay here for two or three
days but on account of the great
amount of work which he has on
hand at present he found that he
could only spare one day. He gave
a second lecture at 2:30 this after
noon, and will speak again at 8 this
evening in the Chapel. All of his
lectures are illustrated by lantern
slides which the University has pre
pared.
In his lecture before the Bionom
ics class this morning, Burbank went
over the main features of his work
in a rapid way. He showed a large
number of illustrations of his horti
cultural creations, and told how each
one was produced. He keeps up
many lines of work at the same time,
and now has about 3600 separate
species under cultivation at. his dif
ferent farms. Each of these species
contains many varities—sometimes
as many as half a million—and each
plant has to be watched carefully.
Those which show the traits which
he wishes to produce are isolated,
and the rest, forming a large major
ity of all specimens, are destroyed.
Most of his creations are formed
by crossing more or less closely re
lated species. One of the most in
teresting of these is what he calls
the "sunberry," formed by crossing
two kinds of solanum, one of which
is poisonous, and the other eaten
only by rabbits. The result is a ber
ry similar to the blueberry, but much
finer.
A number of the slides showed
his method of evolving the spineless
cactus, which he considers by far the
most important part of his work.
He has been engaged on this for a
number of years, and raised hun
dreds of specimens, destroying all ex
cepl a few that showed a tendency
to lose their thorns. The perfect
plant is not yet absolutely fixed, but
lie has advanced far enough to sell
a few specimens at approximately
$1,000 each.
At his lecture this afternoon Lu
ther Burbank spoke on similar lines
of his work. This evening he will
show forty more new slides illustrat
ing his creations. This lecture will
be open to all.
