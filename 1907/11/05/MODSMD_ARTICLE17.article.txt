The latest idea for making the
President's Conference something be
sides a joke will be launched tomor
row afternoon when the executive
board of that body will hold its ini
tial meeting. The election of this
committee to take upon itself the
routine business which formerly
came before the whole conference is
an interesting attempt to bring to
life an organization which was re
garded as quite dead and useless at j
the opening of the semester. It is
undoubtedly true that the old un
weildy body has been superceded by
a smaller and therefore more infor
mal organization. It now remains |
to be seen whether it will be possible j
for a few men in the place ot' many
to really secure the reforms which
the Student Body are vitally inter
ested in. If these results are not
forthcoming it will be possible to
draw but one conclusion—that the |
reasons for failure are fundamental '
and may not be reached by a correc- ■
tion of superficial faults.
