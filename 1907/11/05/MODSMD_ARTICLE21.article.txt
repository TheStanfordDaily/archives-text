## Mendelssohn Celebration Given In Palo Alto Under Direction of Dr. Blodgett. 
### 
AI the Congregational Church in ]
Halo Alto last evening a Mendelssohn |
memorial celebration was held under
ihe direction of Dr. Blodgett, former
University organist. The entire pro
gramme was an interesting one and
was enjoyed by an appreciative audi
ence.
The symphony in A minor and
overture, "Midsummer Night's
Dream," were splendidly rendered
by an orchestra of twenty-five pieces
under the direction of Dr. Blodgett.
The arias and "Elijah's Prayer"
were exceptionally well done and
the Andante movement from the
Violin Concerto, with Mr. Savannah
as violinist, was a most exquisite
number.
Dr. Blodgett's commemorative
words were interesting, giving a
clear insight into the temperament
and character of Mendelssohn. The
great composer was a man of much
learning, having studied the life of
Elijah in the original Hebrew for
two years before composing the Ora
torio. He was a man of sincere but
not narrow piety and was above all
distinguished for his absolute sani
ty. All Leipsic mourned his death
which was announced by the play
ing of a choral on trombones at the
street corner. This choral was
played by Miss Ray Stuart on the
pipe organ.
