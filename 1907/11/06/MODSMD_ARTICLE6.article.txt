of the fifteen men who will be in
the original line-up on Saturday will
be announced at practice tomorrow
afternoon.
The coaches decided to forego any
j scrums this week between the Var
sity and the substitutes, as they con
sidered that the two fierce games
with Vancouver gave the team the
necessary amount of hard work. Ac
cordingly, the second fifteen was dis
banded at the conclusion of yester
day's practice.
The Varsity is now in the best of
{condition. Captain Koerner's injury
i-; giving him no trouble at all, and
he is playing in his old time form
1 while Reed has also entirely recover
ed and will be as strong as ever by
j the end of the week, it was feared
that he might not be able to parti
cipate in the Intercollegiate game,
but nil such doubts have been en
tirely removed by his surprisingly
rapid convalescence. Thorpe's shoul
der is in perfect shape, as is Hol
man's ankle, which was injured ear
jly in the season.
Several positions on the Varsity
fifteen are still in doubt. The hard
est tight for places are at front rank,
wing forward and five-eighth, and
result will not be known un
til the decision of the coaches to-
I morrow afternoon.
