# Draining of Lake Almost Finished.
## 
### 
The water in Felt Lake has re :
ceded to within five feet of the bot
tom. Owing to the mud flogging the
siphon, it will probably take another
day or two to complete the draining
of the reservoir. It. will then lie pos
sible to search for the shotgun which
Chester Silent, is supposed to have
dropped into the lake. It is feared,
however, that by this time the gun
lias sunk in the soft mud which cov
ers the bottom of the lake to a con
siderable depth. If such is the case
ii will be necessary to dredge the
floor of the reservoir.
