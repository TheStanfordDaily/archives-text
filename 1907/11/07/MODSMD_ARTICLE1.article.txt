# TALK ABOUT FOOTBALL
## AMERICAN AND ENGLISH GAMES DISCUSSED IN ASSEMBLY. W. T. Reid, Jr., and Dr. T. M. Williams Hold Interest of Students With Strong Addresses. 
### 
A rousing football Assembly was
held <tt. the third hour this morning

in the Assembly Hall. W. T. Reid,
Jr., the well known Harvard coach
and Dr. Thomas M. Williams of Pa
lo Alto, a former Stanford center,
were the speakers and both dealt
with football subjects. Keid was the
first speaker and was introduced by
Dr. Jordan as "The man who was
loaned to Harvard to raise the stan
dard of athletics in the East."
Reid devoted almost the entire
space of time allotted him to an ear
nest and convincing plan for the con
tinuance of the graduate coach sys
t( m and stated it was pertinent that
the students here should consider
carefully the question, as this was
the last year that Coach James F.
Lanagan will coach a, Stanford team
as the regular coach.
"I wondered," said Reid, "when
first I was asked to speak, if 1 would
be able to speak upon anything that
would be fitting, as T do not know
anything about Rugby, but 1 have
made up my mind to tell you of my
experience with graduate coaches
and paid outsiders. 1 have seen both
systems tried out in the East and I
believe in the graduate system. There
are two alternatives in the coaching
of a university. Either a paid out
sider must be secured or a paid grad
uate coach or a graduate coach who
will give his services gratuitously.
"The paid outsider comes to a uni
versity in a business way. He is
not a college graduate. He comes to
win because he is paid to win; if he


.1. F. lianagaii.
don't win he will lose his position.
He is under greater pressure to win
than the college graduate and will go
to further extremes. He will do
things that a graduate coach would
not do. He will do on the field as
much as the university will stand,
not always what the university stan
dard is.
"The paid coach makes no founda
tion for the future. When he leaves
a dependent university worse off
than before he takes away all that
he has learned. This is not so with
a graduate coach, who works for the
good of the university."
The speaker paid a glowing tribute
to Coach Lanagan: "Since Lanagan
took charge of affairs here Stanford
has experienced an almost continu
ous line of victories. Last year I
believe the Cardinal won every ath
letic event. This is a great record
and speaks much for Lanagan. It
will be a dozen decades before anoth
er coach like Lanagan will be found.
His command of athletics, his high
ideals and his ability to put through
his ideas are exceptional. You must
not expect too much of the coach
who takes his place. I want to say
at, this time that I believe you should
allow Coach Lanagan to choose his
successor. He is best able to choose
wisely. The next man must be a
man of Lanagan methods."
Dr. Williams followed Reid and
iu a light manner told of his idea
of Rugby and wound up by stating:
"Rugby football is good enough for
me, and henceforth when I say foot
ball I mean Rugby football."
