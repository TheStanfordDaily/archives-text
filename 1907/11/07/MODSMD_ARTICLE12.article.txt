# ATTEMPT TO ENTER MADRONO.
## Burglars Pry Open Windows of the Hall Early This Morning.â€”No Clue To Identity. 
### 
An unsuccessful attempt was made
to enter Madrono Hall between the
hours of one and one-thirty this
morning. The would-be burglars
first tried to break into a room on
the south end of the porch and later
attempted to pry off a screen on one
of the parlor windows. It was then
that they were interrupted by a
young lady who had heard a strange
noise on the porch and came down
stairs to investigate. She saw the
men working with a light through
the parlor window, but they fled the
moment they heard her approaching.
It is evident that the work was done
by amateurs because of its bung
ling nature. Miss Gardiner applied
to the Business Office this morning
for a watchman to guard her prem
ises tonight and tomorrow night.
There are no clues to the identity of
the miscreants.
