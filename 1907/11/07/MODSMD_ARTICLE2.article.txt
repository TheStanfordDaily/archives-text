The Stanford Rugby fifteen for
1907 was announced late this af
ternoon by Lanagan and Presley. The
closeness of the fight between Reed
and Owen for left wing led the
: coaches to defer the final decision on
! this point to the last possible mo
' ment, so that position will be in
doubt until perhaps Saturday morn
ing. The line-up of the team is
much the same as was generally ex-
I pected. Rhyne will be in the front
! rank, Mayers at wing forward, Ga
( nong at five and Cadwalader at full.
These were the four uncertain places.
The personnel follows:
Ivoerner.
W. Koerner, '08, captain and front
rank, is the most reliable man in
the scrum. He is an aggressive and
heady player and an excellent hook
er and dribbler. He was left, end on
the victorious 12-5 team, but he
quickly adapted himself to Rugby,
and from the beginning of last sea
son he was a certainty for a front
I rank position on the Varsity. Koer
ner has made an admirable captain
and has the entire confidence of the
whole squad. He is 21 years of age
and weighs 165 pounds. He regis
ters from Oregon City in the De
partment, of Geology and Mining.
Koerner belongs to the Kappa Sigma
fraternity, the Quadrangle Club, and
Skull and Snakes.
Rhyne.
H. Rhyne, '08, of Paso Robles, will
J be Captain Koerner's partner in the
front rank. Ever since his Fresh
man year Rhyne has struggled faith
fully and consistently for a position
on the Varsity, but until this sea
son he has been a member of the
second team. He has more than
made good at Rugby, however, and
proved himself a steady and reliable
fighter. He knows the game well
and always uses his head. Rhyne is

23 years old, weighs 165 pounds and
registers in the Geology and Mining
department. lie is a member of En
cina Club.
Minturn.
L. R. Minturn, '09, will be the
lock man of the scrum, the position
which he filled on the 1906 Varsity.
He is built perfectly for lock and
plays a steady and well-judged game.
He understands the needs of his po
sition and would be a difficult man
to replace. Minturn is 20 years of
age, weighing 190 pounds. He re
ceived his football training under
Lanagan at Belmont School, and
he was a guard on the 1909
Freshman eleven. Minturn is a
member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, re
gistering from San Francisco in Elec
trical Engineering.
Crawford.
I). P. Crawford, '09 will be in the
side rank of the pack. He is one
of the most aggressive of the for
wards and always puts up a strong
game. His 200 pounds together
with his natural football ability
make him an extremely valuable
man. He was ineligible for the fif
teen last, year, but he played right
tackle on the 1905 eleven and on
the 1909 Freshman team. He was
a point-winner in the Intercollegiate
track meet last, spring, taking first
place in the shot-put. Crawford is
20 years of age and majors in Civil
Engineering from Cupertino. He is
a member of Encina Club.
J". li. Peniberton.
The second side rank position will
be filled by J. R. Pemberton, '08,
of Palo Alto. He is a strong, clev
er player, follows the ball well and
is altogether a dangerous man in
the scrum. He was a forward on
last year's fifteen, but an injured
knee kept him out of the 1908 In
tercollegiate Freshman game. Pem-

ters from Oregon City in the De
partment, of Geology and Mining.
Koerner belongs to the Kappa Sigma
fraternity, the Quadrangle Club, and

Rhyne.
H. Rhyne, '08, of Paso Robles, will
J be Captain Koerner's partner in the
front rank. Ever since his Fresh
man year Rhyne has struggled faith
fully and consistently for a position
on the Varsity, but until this sea
son he has been a member of the
second team. He has more than
made good at Rugby, however, and
proved himself a steady and reliable
fighter. He knows the game well
and always uses his head. Rhyne is

23 years old, weighs 165 pounds and
registers in the Geology and Mining
department. lie is a member of En
cina Club.
Minturn.

lock man of the scrum, the position
which he filled on the 1906 Varsity.
He is built perfectly for lock and
plays a steady and well-judged game.
He understands the needs of his po
sition and would be a difficult man
to replace. Minturn is 20 years of
age, weighing 190 pounds. He re
ceived his football training under
Lanagan at Belmont School, and
he was a guard on the 1909
Freshman eleven. Minturn is a
member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, re
gistering from San Francisco in Elec
trical Engineering.
Crawford.
I). P. Crawford, '09 will be in the
side rank of the pack. He is one
of the most aggressive of the for
wards and always puts up a strong
game. His 200 pounds together
with his natural football ability
make him an extremely valuable
man. He was ineligible for the fif
teen last, year, but he played right
tackle on the 1905 eleven and on
the 1909 Freshman team. He was
a point-winner in the Intercollegiate
track meet last, spring, taking first
place in the shot-put. Crawford is
20 years of age and majors in Civil
Engineering from Cupertino. He is
a member of Encina Club.
J". li. Peniberton.
The second side rank position will
be filled by J. R. Pemberton, '08,
of Palo Alto. He is a strong, clev
er player, follows the ball well and
is altogether a dangerous man in
the scrum. He was a forward on
last year's fifteen, but an injured
knee kept him out of the 1908 In
tercollegiate Freshman game. Pem-

The Stanford Rugby fifteen for
1907 was announced late this af
ternoon by Lanagan and Presley. The
closeness of the fight between Reed
and Owen for left wing led the
: coaches to defer the final decision on
! this point to the last possible mo
' ment, so that position will be in
doubt until perhaps Saturday morn
ing. The line-up of the team is
much the same as was generally ex-
I pected. Rhyne will be in the front
! rank, Mayers at wing forward, Ga
( nong at five and Cadwalader at full.
These were the four uncertain places.
The personnel follows:
Ivoerner.
W. Koerner, '08, captain and front
rank, is the most reliable man in
the scrum. He is an aggressive and
heady player and an excellent hook
er and dribbler. He was left, end on
the victorious 12-5 team, but he
quickly adapted himself to Rugby,
and from the beginning of last sea
son he was a certainty for a front
I rank position on the Varsity. Koer
ner has made an admirable captain
and has the entire confidence of the
whole squad. He is 21 years of age
