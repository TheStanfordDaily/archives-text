# LAKE ALMOST DRAINED
## WATER IS RECEDING RAPIDLY IN RESERVOIR BASIN. Sheriff Landlord Is Unable To Locate the Missing Shotgun.—Will Search Among Weeds. 
### 
The water is almost out of Felt
Lake and it is expected that the
basin will be entirely drained within
three days. The depth has been low
ered about eighteen feet since the
siphons were installed.
Sheriff Langford and Constable
Grider made a search this afternoon
for the shotgun which Silent is sup
posed to have dropped at the time of
his death, but failed to locate it or
obtain any new clue to its where
abouts.
The heavy growth of weeds which
was floating on the water sinks to
the bottom as the water leel recedes,
so that if tne gun is in the lake it
H probably beneath the foot or more
of this growth. As a last resort
Langford is considering the advisa
bility of turning over all this layer
of weeds with pitchforks to search
for the missing gun on the mud. If
this is done, he contemplates bring
ing prisoners from the county jail
to do the work.
