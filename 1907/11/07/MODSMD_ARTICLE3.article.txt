# LAKE ALMOST DRAINED
## WATER IS RECEDING RAPIDLY IN RESERVOIR BASIN. Sheriff Landlord Is Unable To Locate the Missing Shotgun.—Will Search Among Weeds. 
### 
The water is almost out of Felt
Lake and it is expected that the
basin will be entirely drained within
three days. The depth has been low
ered about eighteen feet since the
siphons were installed.
Sheriff Langford and Constable
Grider made a search this afternoon
for the shotgun which Silent is sup
posed to have dropped at the time of
his death, but failed to locate it or
obtain any new clue to its where
abouts.
The heavy growth of weeds which
was floating on the water sinks to
the bottom as the water leel recedes,
so that if tne gun is in the lake it
H probably beneath the foot or more
of this growth. As a last resort
Langford is considering the advisa
bility of turning over all this layer
of weeds with pitchforks to search
for the missing gun on the mud. If
this is done, he contemplates bring
ing prisoners from the county jail
to do the work.

be the other rear rank man. He is
a heady, reliable, aggressive player,
whose work is seldom brilliant but
always steady and sure. He is a
clever dribbler, follows the play
closely and understands the game
thoroughly. He filled the same posi
tion on the Varsity last November

dribbler and a good man on line
outs. Miller is famous in track ath

Mayers.
F. B. Mayers, '09, wing forward,
won his position after one of the
hardest fights of the season. The
place has been given him because of
superior steadiness, rather than for
any great brilliancy. Besides being
thoroughly reliable, he is aggressive
and an excellent and accurate drib
bler. Furthermore, he invariably
exercises good judgment on the
throw-ins from line-outs. Mayers
did not play American football dur
ing his Freshman year, but last sea

the Rugby squad. He weighs 160
pounds and is 21 years of age. May
ers belongs to Kappa Alpha and re

Iv. L. Fenton, 'OS, who will play

eleven, and he alone was practically
responsible for the victory over Cal

1906 fifteen and was a substitute on
the 12 to 5 Varsity. For two years
he has held the punting trophy of
the Quadrangle Club, and he was
the first man to be given the Skull
and Snakes batting cup. As the
coaches were not able to find a suit
able half, they brought Fenton in
from full, and he has proved a great
success at the new position. He is
heady, quick and cool, three neces
sary attributes to a first-class half.
Furthermore, his wonderful kicking
ability stands him in good stead. He

tackling hard and sure. An injured

for several weeks, but his excellent
work has made him certain of a
place on the fifteen. He lacks ex
perience at full, but Saturday will
undoubtedly see him justify the
coaches' decision in putting him
there. Cadwalader has played a
field position on the varsity nine for
the past two seasons. He is 21

whose work is seldom brilliant but
always steady and sure. He is a
clever dribbler, follows the play

Mayers.
F. B. Mayers, '09, wing forward,
won his position after one of the
hardest fights of the season. The
place has been given him because of
superior steadiness, rather than for
any great brilliancy. Besides being
thoroughly reliable, he is aggressive
and an excellent and accurate drib
bler. Furthermore, he invariably
exercises good judgment on the
throw-ins from line-outs. Mayers
did not play American football dur
ing his Freshman year, but last sea
son he was a promising candidate on
the Rugby squad. He weighs 160
pounds and is 21 years of age. May
ers belongs to Kappa Alpha and re

Fenton.
Iv. L. Fenton, 'OS, who will play

the past three seasons. He was cap
tain and quarter of his Freshman
eleven, and he alone was practically
responsible for the victory over Cal

1906 fifteen and was a substitute on
the 12 to 5 Varsity. For two years
he has held the punting trophy of
the Quadrangle Club, and he was
the first man to be given the Skull

coaches were not able to find a suit
able half, they brought Fenton in
from full, and he has proved a great
success at the new position. He is
heady, quick and cool, three neces
sary attributes to a first-class half.
Furthermore, his wonderful kicking
ability stands him in good stead. He
weighs 135 pounds and is 20 years

tered field and probably the surest
man on the fifteen at passing and re
ceiving the pigskin. He works well
with the wings and works well with
the backfield. Vandervoort was right
half on his Freshman eleven and left
[ half on the 12-5 Varsity. This is

Heed.
If H. E. Reed. 10, is at left wing

squad. Reed is a strong runner,
very hard to stop, and extremely
dangerous in a scattered field. He
played wing on the 1911 fifteen, took
second in the 220 in the 1907 Inter

Cadwalader.
The difficult position of full-back
will be filled by T. R. Cadwalader,
'09, of Los Angeles. His judgment
is perfect, his kicking good, and his
tackling hard and sure. An injured
shoulder kept him out of the game
for several weeks, but his excellent
work has made him certain of a
place on the fifteen. He lacks ex
perience at full, but Saturday will
undoubtedly see him justify the
coaches' decision in putting him
there. Cadwalader has played a
field position on the varsity nine for
the past two seasons. He is 21

Cadwalader.
The difficult position of full-back
will be filled by T. R. Cadwalader,
'09, of Los Angeles. His judgment
is perfect, his kicking good, and his
tackling hard and sure. An injured
shoulder kept him out of the game
for several weeks, but his excellent
work has made him certain of a
place on the fifteen. He lacks ex
perience at full, but Saturday will
undoubtedly see him justify the
coaches' decision in putting him
there. Cadwalader has played a
field position on the varsity nine for
the past two seasons. He is 21
years old and weighs 148 pounds. He
belongs to Beta Theta Pi, was pres
