The attention of all residents of
the Campus is called to the fact that
tomorrow night is the night before
the big game and should be one of
quiet in order that none of the foot
ball men may be kept awake. The
strongest of unwritten laws forbids
noise of any kind at such a time,
and every one should take it upon
himself to see that Stanford's
chances Saturday are not damaged
by the thoughtlessness of any mem
ber of the undergraduate body.
