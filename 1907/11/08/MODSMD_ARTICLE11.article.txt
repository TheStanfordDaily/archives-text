# EXPECT VICTORY HERE.
## UNDERGRADUATES CONFIDENT OF STANFORD TRIUMPH. Superiority of Cardinal Backfield and Advantage of Home Grounds Will Determine Result. 
### HAROLD FITCH 
The team that will represent Stan
ford in the great Intercollegiate con
test tomorrow afternoon is one in
which the undergraduates have the
i ill<-si confidence and there is a gen
eral feeling that the Cardinal will be
victorious. There are several good
reasons for this confidence in the
Student Body and the one that prob
ably comes first is the fact that the
t< am has been trained by Coach
.lames F. Lanagan, who lias turned
out four varsity football teams at
Stanford and lias not yet been de
feated. When Lanagan came to
Stanford in 1901! he faced a difficult
problem, as California had won the
two previous years and he was com
pelled to develop a team that could
successfully meet the Blue and Gold
\eterans. This he did and the re
sult was a (i-ti game in which Stan
ford had an advantage. The next

three years Lanagan's
teams were victorious,
and this year, after his
Australian trip and with
tho assistance of Field
Coach G. J. Presley, he
has developed a team
that will surely play a
splendid game and one
which is in every respect
equal to the California
fifteen.
In addition to the con
fidence placed in the
team because of Lana
gan's coaching, there is a
feeling that the playing
of the big game upon the
home field will prove a
distinct advantage to the
Cardinal players. This is
a fact that is of no small
importance and it is al
ways conceded that the
home team lias an advan
tage, both on account of
familiarity with the field
and the avoiding of the
excitement of a trip to
the scene of the contest.
Besides these two causes

ol Stanford confidence there has
been a steady improvement in
the playing of the Varsity during
the past two weeks and the results
of the Vancouver games clearl/
demonstrated that the Stanford team
I.as strong scoring ability. In the
game tomorrow the team will be in
fine condition and the men can be
expected to play their best game,
which on form is fully equal to any
iiing shown by the California fif
teen this season. In fact, Stanford
has shown to better advantage in the
I reliininary games than Coach Tay
lor's men and it is well known that
the Stanford teams since Lanagan'-
time, have always played their best
game on the day of the Intercolleg
iate contest. These facts all cause
the undergraduates to expect a Stan
ford victory, although a close game
h generally expected as the teams
are evenly matched and preliminary
stores are liable to prove mislead
ing.
The California team is heavier
than Stanford's fifteen, especially in

the scrum, but this advantage in
weight is expected to be off-set by
the speed of the Cardinal back-field
and the general aggressiveness of
the team. In general knowledge of
the game the Stanford team is cer
tainly equal to California, and be
cause of Lanagan's coaching, the ad
vantage of playing on the home
field, and the speed and fighting spir
i' ot the team, the Student Body con
fidently expects a victory in tomor
row's contest.
