# CARDINAL BACKS FAST
## STANFORD SHOULD WIN AFTER HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE. California Stronger on Defence But Lacks in Scoring Ability.â€”Brilliant Play Not Expected. 
### "BOBS 
The Rugby enthusiasts of San
Francisco are eagerly awaiting the

second meeting of the riv.'l varsity
teams under Rugby rules and it is
mfe to say that the future destinies
of the game in California lie in the
contest on Saturday. Last year's
( vhibition could hardly, by a great
stretch of imagination, be described
as Rugby and though a record crowd
v. as present to witness the innova
tion of this style of play, the impres
sion created was mainly one of
opinion deferred, and the battle this
week will give the spectators an
opportunity of sizing up the game
on its merits.
That the teams have been and will
play "real" Rugby is now beyond
question as the preliminary games
have served to show, but it does not
follow that the play between the
two colleges will be a spectacular
exhibition. In fact, the history of
Rugby in the old world points to
hard fought but interesting contests
wherever two rival clubs have come
together, the feature of this game
I eing the excess of scrummage work.
Take for example the annual
games between Salford and Swinton,
Munslet and Huddersfleld, or Rich
mond and Blackheath, two decades
ago when Rugby was at its height
in England. These contests were
always fiercely waged without a
sparkle of brilliance to offset the
monotonous series of scrums. And
yet any of these teams were noted
for the wonderful display of their
backs behind the scrum when op
posed to other fifteens.
I do not wish to convey the idea
