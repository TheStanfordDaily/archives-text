# CARDINAL BACKS FAST
## STANFORD SHOULD WIN AFTER HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE. California Stronger on Defence But Lacks in Scoring Ability.—Brilliant Play Not Expected. 
### "BOBS 
The Rugby enthusiasts of San
Francisco are eagerly awaiting the

second meeting of the riv.'l varsity
teams under Rugby rules and it is
mfe to say that the future destinies
of the game in California lie in the
contest on Saturday. Last year's
( vhibition could hardly, by a great
stretch of imagination, be described
as Rugby and though a record crowd
v. as present to witness the innova
tion of this style of play, the impres
sion created was mainly one of
opinion deferred, and the battle this
week will give the spectators an
opportunity of sizing up the game
on its merits.
That the teams have been and will
play "real" Rugby is now beyond
question as the preliminary games
have served to show, but it does not
follow that the play between the
two colleges will be a spectacular
exhibition. In fact, the history of
Rugby in the old world points to
hard fought but interesting contests
wherever two rival clubs have come
together, the feature of this game
I eing the excess of scrummage work.
Take for example the annual
games between Salford and Swinton,
Munslet and Huddersfleld, or Rich
mond and Blackheath, two decades
ago when Rugby was at its height
in England. These contests were
always fiercely waged without a
sparkle of brilliance to offset the
monotonous series of scrums. And
yet any of these teams were noted
for the wonderful display of their
backs behind the scrum when op
posed to other fifteens.
I do not wish to convey the idea


W. K TULLSJZ
that the Varsity teams will not give j
an open exhibition on Saturday,
but merely to show that bril
liance is often sacrificed where
keenness of rivalry is present, espec
ially under Rugby rules. In the pre
liminary games both fifteens have
! given some wonderful displays of pas
sing and have amassed quite a re
spectable average of points per game
in the scoring column, and thebal
ance is in favor of the Cardinal,
whose backs are the more aggressive
of the two.
In defense, however, the Blue and
Gold backs have been seen to bet- i
tor advantage in games against iden
tical teams, as may be seen from the
few occasions on which I heir line
has been crossed.
Forward, the Berkeley team holds
an advantage in weight, published
figures notwithstanding, and they
are strong in "push," in following
up and dribble well in the loose.
To offset this the Stanford front
rankers have exhibited plenty of gin
ger, especially in the last Vancou
ver game when they were pounds
behind in the matter of weight and
| yet held their own in the scrums,
and are also strong in feeding the
backs from the touch line-outs.
Taller of Berkeley appears to be
the better of the two wing-forwards,
and this advantage would be quite
j an asset for the California team in
the break-up of the scrum were it
not for the fact that Fenton plays
close up and renders assistance to
the Cardinal wing.
At five-eighths and three-quarters
I look to see the Cardinal shine in
aggressive work as their passing ral
lies have been features of all the
games. Not knowing the exact com
; position of the two lines, I refrain
from commenting on their individual
merits, but there will be no trouble
in selecting five clever men who can
work harmoniously in these posi
tions, a'hd the possible candidates
may be considered unfortunate in
having such a team of talents to
choose from.
The California fives and threes are
all hard working, speedy players,
good tacklers, though not so clever
in handling the ball as their rivals.
At full-back both possess strong
men in Butler and Cadwalader, the
latter having an exceptionally cool
head. Butler lias been playing in
great form all the season and will
be called upon to do the goal-kick
ing should an occasion arise.
To sum up—l think that the Car
dinal will just about win though
! the margin at the finish will not be
a big one, nor will a large total of
; points be gained by either side.
Stanford has the advantage of play
ing on their own ground, which
| counts for something between teams
' otherwise equally strong, having be
come used to the surface and envir
onments.
In looking over the preliminary
! games, it may be noticed that Stan
ford has always finished strong and
has scored most of their victories af
ter being behind in the first half,
wheras California has usually been
fighting to retain her lead at the end.
; Should there be little scoring, and
it looks that way now, I expect to see
one of those neat passing rallies of
the Cardinal backs be converted in
to the winning score.
The managers exhibited good judg
ment when they selected George .Ten
i kinson to referee the contest as all

who saw him officiate in the Fresh
man game will testify. His decis
ions are given promptly and fairly
and what, is more exact respect from
the contesting players.
May the best team win.

sing and have amassed quite a re
spectable average of points per game
in the scoring column, and thebal
ance is in favor of the Cardinal,
whose backs are the more aggressive
of the two.
In defense, however, the Blue and
Gold backs have been seen to bet- i
tor advantage in games against iden
tical teams, as may be seen from the
few occasions on which I heir line
has been crossed.
Forward, the Berkeley team holds
an advantage in weight, published
figures notwithstanding, and they
are strong in "push," in following
up and dribble well in the loose.
To offset this the Stanford front
rankers have exhibited plenty of gin
ger, especially in the last Vancou
ver game when they were pounds
behind in the matter of weight and
| yet held their own in the scrums,
and are also strong in feeding the
backs from the touch line-outs.
Taller of Berkeley appears to be
the better of the two wing-forwards,
and this advantage would be quite
j an asset for the California team in
the break-up of the scrum were it
not for the fact that Fenton plays
close up and renders assistance to
the Cardinal wing.
At five-eighths and three-quarters
I look to see the Cardinal shine in
aggressive work as their passing ral
lies have been features of all the
games. Not knowing the exact com
; position of the two lines, I refrain
from commenting on their individual
merits, but there will be no trouble
in selecting five clever men who can
work harmoniously in these posi
tions, a'hd the possible candidates
may be considered unfortunate in
having such a team of talents to
choose from.
The California fives and threes are
all hard working, speedy players,
good tacklers, though not so clever
in handling the ball as their rivals.
At full-back both possess strong
men in Butler and Cadwalader, the
latter having an exceptionally cool
head. Butler lias been playing in
great form all the season and will
be called upon to do the goal-kick
ing should an occasion arise.
To sum up—l think that the Car
dinal will just about win though
! the margin at the finish will not be
a big one, nor will a large total of
; points be gained by either side.
Stanford has the advantage of play
ing on their own ground, which
| counts for something between teams
' otherwise equally strong, having be
come used to the surface and envir
onments.
In looking over the preliminary
! games, it may be noticed that Stan
ford has always finished strong and
has scored most of their victories af
ter being behind in the first half,
wheras California has usually been
fighting to retain her lead at the end.
; Should there be little scoring, and
it looks that way now, I expect to see
one of those neat passing rallies of
the Cardinal backs be converted in
to the winning score.
The managers exhibited good judg
ment when they selected George .Ten
i kinson to referee the contest as all

who saw him officiate in the Fresh
man game will testify. His decis
ions are given promptly and fairly
and what, is more exact respect from
the contesting players.
May the best team win.
The Rugby enthusiasts of San
Francisco are eagerly awaiting the

second meeting of the riv.'l varsity
teams under Rugby rules and it is
mfe to say that the future destinies
of the game in California lie in the
contest on Saturday. Last year's
( vhibition could hardly, by a great
stretch of imagination, be described
as Rugby and though a record crowd
v. as present to witness the innova
tion of this style of play, the impres
sion created was mainly one of
opinion deferred, and the battle this
week will give the spectators an
opportunity of sizing up the game
on its merits.
That the teams have been and will
play "real" Rugby is now beyond
question as the preliminary games
have served to show, but it does not
follow that the play between the
two colleges will be a spectacular
exhibition. In fact, the history of
Rugby in the old world points to
hard fought but interesting contests
wherever two rival clubs have come
together, the feature of this game
I eing the excess of scrummage work.
Take for example the annual
games between Salford and Swinton,
Munslet and Huddersfleld, or Rich
mond and Blackheath, two decades
ago when Rugby was at its height
in England. These contests were
always fiercely waged without a
sparkle of brilliance to offset the
monotonous series of scrums. And
yet any of these teams were noted
for the wonderful display of their
backs behind the scrum when op
posed to other fifteens.
I do not wish to convey the idea
