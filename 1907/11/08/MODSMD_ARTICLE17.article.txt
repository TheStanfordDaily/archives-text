# HAS SCORING ABILITY.
## STANFORD ROLLS UP 91 POINTS IN PRELIMINARY REASON. Games Played by Cardinal and Blue and Gold Give Indications of Result. 
### ARCHIE RICE, '95 
I could not readily resist the path
os of \V. H. B. Fowler when he came
to me and said: "The fellows down
there want you to please write some
thing about the preliminary games.
They'll print it for nothing in the
Daily Palo Alto Thursday night."
The preliminary games, if you can
forget the plight of poor Fowler and
care to read on, consisted of matches
b\ both varsities in turn with the
University of Nevada, the Barbarians
from San Francisco, and the Vancou
ver team from British Columbia. The
Barbarians, with their best men in
the game, consisted of six English
men, three New Zealanders, three
Australians, one Irishman, one Cana
dian, and two Americans, one a Cal
ifornian and the other a Washing
tonian, but all residents of San Fran
cisco, where they were working ev
ery day at their various vocations
and had no training season, no train
ing table, and no restrictions other
than those self-imposed by men who
have to earn their own living and
have got beyond the thoughtless
spending and spreeing stage general
ly associated with adolescence draw
ing regular remittances from "dear
father" and "dear mother" in re
sponse to the only letters for which
the busy college student always has
time!
The Vancouver team, or rather the
squad of nineteen from which the
fifteen formed for the games down
here was drawn, consisted of two
New Zealanders, four Australians,
five Englishmen, and eight Canad
ians, and the Canadians were mainly
the substitutes, which would indi
cate that even in Canada the best
Rugby players are imported.
Now the Nevada team weighed,
stripped, an average of 152 pounds
to the man; the Barbarians 15 5,
Stanford 161, California 164, and
Vancouver 165, for I took the trou
ble to collect the data myself, af
ter hearing so much talk about "Cal
ifornia's heavier forwards" and
' Vancouver weighs 185 pounds to
the man."
Both universities played these
three outside teams the same num
ber of games. And here are the re
sults in sequence:
California ... 0 Barbarians . . 6
California ... 9 Barbarians . . 0
California . . .25 Nevada ..... 0
California ... CÂ» Barbarians . . 0
California ... 16 Vancouver ..12
California ... 0 Vancouver . . 3
Total 56 Opponents ..21
Stanford ....10 Barbarians .. 6
Stanford ....31 Nevada 0
Stanford ....16 Barbarians ..13
Stanford .... 6 Barbarians ..13
Stanford ....2'! Vancouver ..12
Stanford .... 5 Vancouver . . 3
Total 91 Opponents ...47
These scores roughly indicate that
California, in her six games won four
and lost two, making an average of
it points to opponents' 4, while
Stanford in her six games won five
and lost one, making an average of
15 to each opponent's 8. Tn them

selves these bald results indicate that
California is not such a big scoring
team as Stanford, but on the other
hand does not permit an opponent
to score so easily as Stanford does
And the actual playing happens to
support this deduction. Other things
being equal, Stanford would score
more heavily than California purely
011 Fenton's accurate placement kick
ing. Stanford has two advantages to
be reckoned aside from the season's
scores. That fighting spirit that
flashed in the last, Vancouver game
for an irresistible score was like the
spirit of two years ago when three
of Stanford's present team helped de
fend Stanford Field and christen it
with a fighting force that in all ex
cept. that, wonderful frenzy for the
home field was logically overmatched
by California's dangerous veterans.
That spirit fired again and Fenton's
kicking are two things which Cali
fornia has not shown this season
that she can offset by similar advan
tages. I believe that Kenneth Fen
ton is not. only the most valuable
Rugby player in the West, but T
think that in bis value to a team he
i the greatest Rugby player in all
America today.
Go to it, you fine red devils; be
gentlemen, hut play like fiends.
