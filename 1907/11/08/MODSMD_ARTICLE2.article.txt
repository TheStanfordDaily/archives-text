# BURLESQUE AFTER GAME
## CLEVER PLAY TO BE PRESENTED IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Strong Cast to Produce "The College Widower" With Many Local Features. 
### 
"The College Widower," a two
act burlesque, by Harry Smith, of
George Ado's famous "College Wid
ow," is the basis of the football show
that will be given in Assembly Hall
tomorrow night. The burlesque it
self is one that has had long runs,
both in New York and San Francis
co, having been put on by Weber, of
Weber and Field, in the East, and
by Kolb and Dill 011 the Coast. It
has been plentifully localized for a
Stanford audience, and in every re
spect will be a fitting vehicle for
the presentation of the peculiar sort
of theatricals most appreciated in a
football show.
In its original form the "College
Widower" follows the outlines of
H e "College Widow" almost exactly,
(he burlesque relying largely 011 a
complete inversion of the male and
female roles. As it has been local
ized for its present use, the plot
runs as follows:
It appears that a wealthy lover
of sport, desirng to stimulate inter
est, in athletics at the Berkeley Theo
logical Seminary, has offered the
sum of $50,000 to the young gen
tlemen of the institution, upon the
condition that they take up the game
of football and win a game from
some other college. In order to
make sure of fulfilling the latter
0 ndition, the Theologians*, send a
challenge to Stanf, a nearby girls'
(ollege.
The first act opens with a sceno
011 the Stanf campus, where the girls
are discussing the receipt of the
challenge. After some difficulty they
secure the consent of "Prexie" and
of the Palo Alto town constable for
| the proposed game, and the difficul
ty of securing a coach then arises.
This is happily settled by the appear
| ance of "Ratty" McGowan, a one
time collegian, who has been reduced
: te the condition of a tramp, and who
upon being urged consents to un-
I dertake the job. While the means
of carrying on the campaign are be
ing discussed, Tilly Buttin, an ath
letic young woman whose mother is
an old Stanf graduate but who at
l iesent is engaged in conducting a
boarding house at Berkeley, arrives
upon the scene. An effort, is at
once started to induce her to regis
ter at Stanf for the purpose of
i strengthening the team, and this is
finally accomplished by Jim Wither
bloom, the "College Widower," who
proposes to and is accepted by Tilly.
The second act presents the scene
jist outside of the grounds in which
tne big game is about to be played
: The Berkeley team appears and ex
hausts itself in three lusty college
veils. The Stanf team, with Tilly
at the head and wearing the "Col
i lege Widower's" fraternity pin, next j
I appears, and "Ratty" McGowan, who
has been treated with great rough
ness whenever he tried to get into
training quarters, sends them onto
the field. The game proceeds with
great evenness until Tilly is angei
-1 ect by a red-headed member of the j
Berkeley team, whereupon she se
cures an axe and chases the entire
i team off the field.
Two songs have been inserted into
tne play but the book is not a long j
one and will not fill any more of the
Ie vening than is desirable. The songs
will be "Art," from Fantana; and
| "If We Only Knew What the Milk
| man Sees."
,
The show has been prepared under j
the direction of Harry James, of San ;
; Francisco.
