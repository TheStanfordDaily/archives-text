# OTHER GAMES TOMORROW
## HARVARD WILL MEET CARLISLE INDIANS AT CAMBRIDGE. Yale and Brown Play.â€” Kansas and Nebraska to Settle Missouri Valley Championship. 
### 
The most important Eastern foot
ball game scheduled for tomorrow is
that between Harvard and Carlisle
at Cambridge. The Indians have
shown by defeating Pennsylvania 26-
6 that they are a dangerous compet
itor for any team, and although they
had an off day last Saturday and
were defeated by Princeton 16-0,
they will almost certainly give a
good account of themselves tomor
row. Judging from Harvard's rec
ti! d so far this year, she will have
to exert herself to hold her own.
She only defeated Brown by the score
lof 6-5, and thq little Springfield
Training School made five points
against her nine.
At New Haven Yale meets Brown.
Yale has been fortunate so far this
season in not having a single game
which amounted to more than prac
tice, and although she easily beat
Washington and Jefferson by the
score of 11-0 and Villa Nova by 44-0,
those games of course give no evi
dence of her form this year. On
the other hand, Brown has been
making a creditable showing from
ihe time when she defeated the Har
vard second team 20-6, and her team
ii probably trained more to the pre
sent minute than that of Yale.
Princeton has her usual excellent
team this year, and is confidently
looking forward to defeating Yale on
November 16. Tomorrow she plays
Amherst, which was beaten by Dart
mouth 15-10 and can hardly be ex
pected to put up an exciting game.
While Princeton lost to Cornell by
a close score, she defeated the In
dians rather decisively, and has ov
erwhelmed all the small college
teams in her neighborhood.
Perhaps the hardest fought con
test tomorrow will be that at West
Point between Cornell and the Army.
In addition to defeating Princeton
for the first time in many years, Cor
nell beat Western Pennsylvania Uni
verslty 18-0 last Saturday, while the
Soldiers have won from Colgate 6-0
and Rochester 30-0.
The Navy plays Swarthmore at
Annapolis, and probably will exper
ience little trouble in securing a vic
tory. The sailors have not ]klayed
many games this year, but their
team is reported in excellent condi
tion.
The most evenly matched battle
in the Central West will be that be
tween Wisconsin and Indiana at Ma
dison, Wis. At Ann Arbor, Michi
gan meets Wabash, but as the same
teams met. a few weeks ago, with a
score of 22-0 in favor of Michigan,
the contest is not likely to be inter
esting. lowa meets Illinois at lowa
City. The latter team is somewhat
of an unknown quantity, while lowa
has won from Drake, 16-4, and from
Missouri, 21-6.
A little farther west will be the
big game between Kansas and Ne
braska. The latter has claimed the
championship of the Missouri Valley
for many years, but last fall was de
feated by Kansas. Minnesota has ;il
ready beaten the Cornhuskers 8-5
lhis year, while the Jayhawkers won
fiom St. Louis University 6-4 and
list, to Washburn last Saturday 12-
&; but it looks on the whole as i!

i Nebraska would regain the title to
j morrow.
The only other game of interest
is- that at Chicago, between Chica
go and Purdue. There can be only
one result to this since Chicago has
defeated the fast Minnesota team I 8-
12.
