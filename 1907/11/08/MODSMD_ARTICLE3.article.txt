# Cardinal Stadium Will Be the Scene of the Seventeenth Annual Intercollegiate Football Struggle.
## 
### 
On Stanford Field tomorrow af
ternoon the rival fifteens of the
( ardinal and the Blue and Gold will
battle for supremacy in the most
important event of the year in the i
athletic relations of the two univer
sities. Promptly at 2 o'clock Ref- !
eree Jenkinson will sound his whis
tle to announce the initial kick-off i
o:' the seventeenth annual football
contest and the second annual Rug
by match between the Varsities of
Stanford and California. During the j
following two hours, thirty sturdy
human beings, every one of them
trained to the minute and every one
of them imbued with a stubborn de
termination, will fight the struggle
of their lives.
Encouraging them both in the mo
ments of victory and defeat will be
the solid mass of rooters gathered on
either side of the battle ground. One
Cardinal team, captained by A. J.
Chalmers, has already successfully 1
defended the soil of Stanford Field I
against the onslaughts of the Blue
and Gold. On Saturday, Koerner's
men will fight with all there is in
them to emulate the worthy veterans
of 1905.
In the Intercollegiate contest to
morrow Rugby will receive even
a more thorough and decisive test
than was given it.in the final match
of the season of 1 906, for then it
was not. real Rugby that was 011
ttial, only an imitation, which belled
the efficacy of the genuine game.
This fall, however, the rules that
nre universal the world over have
been brought into vogue in Cali
fornia, and Saturday will furnish the
supreme test of Rugby at its best.

Jenkinson, the referee, will interpret
the rules in such a way as to exhib
it their true meaning and show the
real, innate worth of the English
game.
Tomorrow will also see the success
or failure of the new system of train
ing which was introduced this sea
son at the University of California
I>\ Professor Ma gee, the successor of
Walter Christie. The Cardinal Stu
dent Body is awaiting with apparent
interest, but without the slightest
anxiety, the day when there comes
into conflict the precise, accurate
and scientific plan of Magee with the
extremely simple and thoroughly
practical methods of "Dad" Moulton;
those methods which have so suc
cessfully endnred for so many fierce
seasons and have yet to fail.
The Stanford varsity fifteen,
coached under a well-tried system of
four years' growth, and trained un
der a reliable and thoroughly tested
system of several decades' growth,
will go on the field tomorrow with,
as Lanagan says, a fighting chance
to win, and not only the coaches but
every undergraduate believes that
that fighting chance will be sufficient
for those fifteen men, every one of
whom has, during the past nine
weeks, proved himself the best-fitted
for his position and (he most worthy
to wear the Cardinal on the mem
orable ninth day of November. They
have been continually drilled in ev
ery phase of the game by Lanagan
and Presley, who have sought to in
stil in their charges a knowledge of
the many points of Rugby which
they themselves secured on their re
cent trip to Australia.
The comparative scores of the past
season indicate a Stanford victory,
but comparative scores are, at best,
most unsatisfactory. The contesting
teams have played the same oppon
ents, and the relative results have
been such as to lessen the hopes of
I he supporters of the Blue and Gold.
It is generally admitted by even
the most partisan ot' the California
adherents that the Cardinal backs,
with a nucleus of four veterans, eas
ily surpass their rivals in every point
of the game. It would be a diffi
cult task to find a. trio of three-quar
ters faster than Vandervoort, Hol
man and Reed. Joined to their re
markable sprinting ability is a nat
ural aptitude for Rugby that would
make them a valuable acquisition
to any fifteen.
Second only to them in speed
come Owen and Mitchell who coun
teract this negative handicap by their
spectacular and effective scattered
field running.
Although lacking in the brilliancy
of the foregoing stars, Ganong has
tlie advantage of noteworthy stead
iness and a marked ability to pass
with the greatest precision, however
hard pressed lie may be. There is
no more reliable back on the field
than Ganong.
Cadwalader wants experience at
full, but his accurate kicking, clever

head work, cool judgment and hard
tackling nuike him the equal, if not
the superior of Butler, of California.
Lastly, among the backs comes
Fenton. It is needless to discuss
his worth to the team. At every
point he outclasses his opponent,
nor does this minimize the ability
of the latter, for two Fentons are not
possible.
The Cardinal forwards are out
weighed by tne Blue and Gold pack,
but the superior speed of the Stan
ford scrum should offset the advan
tage in weight. Furthermore, in
I dribbling it is probable that the hon
| ors are slightly with the Cardinal.
The hookers, Koerner and Rhyne,
will be difficult to beat while the ag
gressiveness of Pemberton and Craw
ford and the fast work of Thorpe
and Miller will stand out prominent
i
i ly in the game tomorrow. Minturn
| is a reliable lock, and Mayers is like
ly to surprise the on-lookers by the
way in which he will take care of
Captain Tuller.
Stanford has now been undefeated
i on the gridiron for four successive
years, an enviable record and one
, never equalled by California. At pre
sent, the momentous question is.
j Will Lanagan, Presley and Koerner's
; team make it five successive years?
