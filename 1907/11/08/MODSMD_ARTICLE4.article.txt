# BIG RALLY LAST NIGHT
## ENTHUSIASM SHOWN HAS NEVER BEEN SURPASSED. Assembly Hall Packed.—Serpentine and Immense Bonfire End the Program. 
### 
The varsity Rugby fifteen which
will represent Stanford in the big
struggle against the Blue and Gold
tomorrow was given a magnificent
send-off last night in the Assembly
Hall and upon the baseball diamond
0\er 2,000 undergraduates and in
terested spectators from Palo Alto
crowded the balcony, aisles and main
floor of the Hall to its utmost ca
pacity. Enthusiasm was everywhere
and when the yell leaders called for
the first yell the volume of sound
was an able criterion of the spirit
which will be back of the team to
morrow.
Beginning with the first appear
ance of Encina Club with the band
at its head until the singing of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" upon the field as the
embers of the big bonfire died out
the riot of the undergraduates was
continued with unceasing spirit. The
appearance of the team in Assembly
Hall was hailed with great applause
and the showering of cardinal con
fetti by the women in the gallery.
Professor A. C. Whitaker of the
Economics department was the first
speaker called upon by yell-leader
Swift and he gave encouragement to
the team and told several appropri
ate stories to illustrate his points.
"As a member of the Class of '99."
siiirl Professor Whitaker. "I wish to
repeat what "Hef Williams" said
this morning, 'Play hard and
play fair for the sake of us
all and the has beens,' and
a:- a member of the Faculty I
say exactly the same thing."
J. F. Reilly, '08, one of the speak
ers chosen to represent the Student
Body, was next, called 1o the plat
form. He said: ' Next Saturday
cv-mes our annual spanking time. The
Golden Bear and his cohorts will
swarm upon our Campus for a time
and then they will drag the bear to
l lie bleachers where he will be made
te roar. He is a pathetic sight, that
old bear, with all his blisters and
scars of defeat, but he is brought
cut each year, just the same, by
Berkeley. He roars loud but always
gees home with his stubby tail be
hind him.
The speaker then addressed his at
tention to the team and coaches.
"Gentlemen of the team," said Reil
ly, "on Saturday you are going into
«i battle which is to be a fight against
no mean foe. When you go you will
know that we of the bleachers are
with you. We love you, we respect
you and we honor you. Upon Satur
day you enter tradition as Stanford
heroes. You will go down in history
and shoulder to shoulder with our
Wellers, our Chalmers, and our
Stotts. When you play think of our
coaches, think of our new turf which
awaits to be fittingly christened and
think of us throbbing with life and
spirit on the bleachers hoping that
you will win."
Dad Moulton next spoke of the
condition of the men and as usual
gave several stories which carried
the house."I suppose I am expect
ed to tell you all about the con
dition of the men," said Dad. "Well,
1 think it is good, but 1 don't know;
from all I have read in the papers I
may be wrong. They tell me that
Professor Magee has placed his men
on a scientific diet and they are the
most wonderful athletes. I don't
know much about that and I guess
it will be a case of ignorance against
science, but I think our men will be
going some at the finish. It does us
no good, however, to try and tell
Berkeley anything. They think al
ready that they have won. It is al
ways hard to tell a Berkeley man
anything, and that reminds me of a
story—"
Captain Koerner spoke in behalf
of the team. He said: "On behalf
of the fotoball team. 1 return thanks
for the support of the undergraduates
and the coaches. As to Ihe game Sat
urday, we have a chance to win and
that's all we want."
Coach Lanagan said:"l want to
thank the Student Body for the
splendid support which has been giv
en the team this year. It is the best
1 have heard in ten years. There
has been more real enthusiasm. In
the last four years we have had to
fight for every victory and with one
exception the result has been in the
balance the night before. In the '04
| game the only question was that of
the size of the score. We know the
looters will be behind the team and
the team will feel encouraged to do
| their best."
Coach G. J. Presley, '08, was con
cise in his remarks. "We're up
against a hard fight Saturday," said
Presley, "and we're prepared for it."
E. A. Cunha, '07, followed, and
called upon the rooters for their
s. pport in the coming battle. He
made a strong plea, which was re
ceived with enthusiasm.
After the rally the rooters serpen

tined to the baseball field, where
the huge bonfire gathered by the
men of '11 was burned. A straw ef
figy of a Berkeley football playei
was burned at the top of the pile.
