# CIRCUS IS READY FOR WORK.
## Grounds Will Be Prepared Monday for Concessions.—More New Shows Announced. 
### 
The work of putting the grounds
in shape for the Senior Circus will
he actively commenced next Monday.
There will he a number of tents put
up, one of the largest of which will
house the Inside Inn, under the man
agement, of A. A. Murphy, 'OS. This
tent will be warmed and brilliantly
lighted, and all of the eating conces
sions will probably be centered here,
instead of being scattered all over
the grounds.
The evening performance will com
mence promptly at 7:30 with the
open-air show inside the grounds—
the aerial ballet, broncho-busters,
troupe of tumbling clowns, balloon
ascension, etc. Two volunteers have
already presented themselves for this
last act, so its success is assured.
The sideshows and concessions are
not yet in course of construction, but
for the most part are all ready. F.
A. Curtin, '08, who is to have a very
extensive sideshow, lias arranged for
most of his exhibits. He thinks that
he has discovered the real Missing
Link in the University and is en
deavoring to secure him at present.
The Y. M. C. A. will have a "lump
the lumps," and the Glee and Man
dolin Clubs are arranging to present
a musical entertainment, in which
the personnel will appear for the
first time as it is to go on the Nor
thern trip.
