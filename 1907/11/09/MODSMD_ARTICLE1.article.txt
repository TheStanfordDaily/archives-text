\\;»s a splendid victory and a lining
clinniv to the last season under Coach
liUiiauaii. who lias coached four win

When the teams trotted out on the
turf nl 2:15 before a crowd of 13,-
000 enthusiastic spectators they were
greeted with deafening cheers and
the Stanford rooting section rose to
their feet and shouted for fully ten
minutes, while the entire Cardinal

rooting section was showered with
red confetti and at the same time
hundreds of red balloons were re
leased by the Stanford women who
occupied sections adjoining the root
ers.
At 2:30 Butler kicked off for Cali
fornia and the great annual football
struggle was on. And then began a
series of rushes by the Stanford
backs which proved to be the fea
ture of the game throughout, and
foretold the result. The work of these
men was sensational and the feature
run of the day was made by Holman
when he picked Hie ball out of the
scrum on the 45-vard line and dashed

past the California players,
dodged Butler, and landed the
ball squarely behind tlie goal
posts for Stanford's second try.
It was a beautiful run. Hut.
(he star of the backfleld was
Vandervoort, who made two of
the Stanford tries and did
some of the most brilliant
work of the day. He was in
every play and his defensive
work was splendid. At half
back Fenton played the same
cool, heady game that he al
ways plays and his work in
getting away punts when
closely pressed was wonderful.
His goal -kicking was up to his
usual form and in getting the
men together when the game
was going against them lie was
invaluable.
On the wings Holman and
Owen both did great, work and
llolman's speed was an import
ant factor in gaining many
yards for the Cardinal. Ga
ming and Mitchell worked well
together and it was Ganong
who started many of the pass
ing rushes which allowed the
men on the wings to get loose.
The Stanford forwards proved
stronger than expected, al
though their play was erratic

;ind ;it times ihe California scrum
had an advantage. In the last fif
teen minutes of the play, however,
the Cardinal forwards became won
derfully aggressive and ran their op
ponents off the field. Captain Koer
ner certainly deserves the honor of
leading a victorious team, and
his work in today's game was
conspicuous. He followed the
hall continually and when the
team was near the California line
in the early part of the second half
it was Koerner who carried it over
the line for a try. Pemberton.
Rhyne. Miller and Crawford were
always aggressive and every man in
the Stanford scrum did his work
well. Tt was a victory earned by
team-work, condition, and a fight
ing spirit which could not be
downed.
For California the man who stood
out most conspicuously was Johns,

and he has the remarkable distinc
tion of making all three of Califor
nia's tries. He was a speedy man
and showed rare ability to run
through a scattered field. Cert' and

Dwiggins were both in their best
form and were dangerous every
time they had possession of the ball.
Butler's back-field work was not aa
brilliant as in the game last year,
but his punting was fine and he was
remarkably cool at all times.
Among the California forwards
Stow was particularly strong and
the Blue and Gold scrum men did
great work in getting the ball out to
their backs on the line-outs. Alto
gether the California team put up a
hard fight and it was superiority of
the Stanford back-field and their
great condition that won the game
for the Cardinal.
The contest on Stanford Field this
afternoon was certainly one that will
go down in the annals of Intercol
legiate football as the most thrill
ing struggle that has ever been
seen on this coast. There was not an
unsportsmanlike incident to mar
the day and when the final whistle
blew and the Cardinal rooters
swarmed over the field in the dizzy
serpentine, it was a spectacle that
will never be forgotten.
"Dad" Moulton had the following
to say concerning the result: "The
Stanford team deserved to win. The
men were in the best condition I
have ever seen, and their fighting
spirit was fine."
Professor Magee, California's
trainer, was extremely reticent on
the subject. "California lost; that's
all there is to it,"was the extent of
his remarks.
When interviewed after the game.
Captain Koerner said: "The best
team won. The victory was directly
due to the splendid condition and
fighting spirit of the Stanford play
ers."
Captain Tuller, of California,
said: "It was a great game be
tween great teams and the best team
won."
