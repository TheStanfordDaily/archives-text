# INDIANS BEAT HARVARD
## OUTLOOK FOR CRIMSON DURING REST OF SEASON IS BAD. Brown Loses to Yale—Cornell Defeats Army 14-10.—Princeton 14, Amherst 0. 
### 
Harvard received a crushing blow
(his afternoon when the Indians de
feated her at Cambridge by the
score of 18-15. The Crimson has
been having a bad slump during the
last two weeks, and the victory of
Carlisle, after Princeton had beaten
them 16-0, looks very serious for
any Harvard successes later. At
the end of the lirst half the score
stood 12-10, and at the close 18-15,
which shows that Harvard would
have prevented the disaster by bet
ter goal-kicking.
As was expected, Yale defeated
Brown at New Haven, and the score
of 22-0 shows that their team is In
admirable shape, because Brown
has the best team of any small col
lege this year.
Princeton won from Amherst
14-0, while Swarthmore gained an
unexpected victory over the Navy,
1 S-0, at Annapolis. The game at
West Point between Cornell and the
; Army was very close throughout,
but Cornell finally won, 14-10.
The big game in the Middle West,
i between Wisconsin and Indiana at
Madison, was won by the former,
11-8. Chicago overwhelmed Pur
due by 56-0. while St. Louis Univer
-1 sity won a creditable victory from
Wabash, 11-0. The summary is:
Carlisle 18, Harvard 15.
Yale 22, Brown 0.
Princeton 14, Amherst 0.
Swarthmore 18, Navy o.
Cornell 14, Army in.
Wisconsin 11. Indiana S.
