This is Stanford's day again and
with the fourth straight football vic
tory a matter of intercollegiate his
tory, we may well turn to the men
who have made such a record possi
ble and offer them our sincere con
gratulations. The fifteen which de
fended Stanford Field today has
proven its right, to stand be
side the greatest of Cardinal
teams and will not be soon
forgotten here. We naturally turn
to coaches, trainer and captain with
a first word of praise. Without
their efforts there could have been
no victory and the Cardinal stadium
would have seen a Blue and Gold
serpentine. Even a greater debt,
however, the Student Body owes to
those men of the second team whose
playing without hope of reward dur
ing a long season has been a magnifi
cent exemplification of the true Stan
ford spirit. It is the work of these
men, whom we did not. see today,
which makes possible the perfecting
of a varsity fifteen and to them
should go a major part of the credit
for a great victory.
