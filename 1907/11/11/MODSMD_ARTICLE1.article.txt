# CIRCUS NOW UNDER WAY
## 1800 YARDS OF CANVAS HERE AND SENIORS AT WORK. No Lemon Court To Be Maintained. Football Rally Will Be Held at Performance. 
### 
The work of putting the football
field in readiness for the Senior Cir
cus was begun this afternoon. 1800
yards of sewed canvas have already
arrived and will be used to enclose
the concessions which are operated
by the class. The electric fixtures
which will illuminate the entire
field, are being installed under the
direction of L. M. Klauber, 'os.
As the yell-leaders have announ
ced that there will be no post-season
rally this year, such as was held af
ter the first Cardinal victory on
Stanford Field, in 1905, the Class
of 1908 has decided to incorporate
into the circus a rousing rally and
jubilation, with which to close the
season. It seems that the circus will
be a N more auspicious time for a
celebration of this kind than a spe
cial meeting would be, especially in
view of the large number of meetings
which have been held lately.
The grounds will be thoroughly
policed in the interest of order, and
nc rowdyism of any kind will be
tolerated, but the committee an
nounces that there will positively be
no court of any kind maintained.
The Tonopah Bar has made ar
rangements to sell liquid refresh
ments of all kinds. Two new conces
sions secured are Dido, as announced
on posters this morning, and Bikiki.
