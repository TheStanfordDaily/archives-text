"Love all men," was the topic

sermon on Sunday morning in the
Chapel. He took his text from the
words of Christ and dwelt upon the
simplicity of this rule of life. Dr.
Howard said that the fault of mod
ern religion was that the different
creeds and forms of worship were
unnecessarily elaborate and that we
should return to the simple teach
ings of Christ and that brotherly
love was the true secret of Christ
ianity. He said that no creed was
necessary and that all we needed to
lead a true Christian life was the
simple instructions of Christ as giv
er to His disciples.
The sermon opened with a des
cription of the character of the Sa
viour and of how He taught a sim
ple lesson of true brotherly love.
Dr. Howard then went on to say that
the creeds and various interpreta
tions of Christianity were the re
sult. of the Council of Nicea. The
entire sermon was an appeal to his
audience to live in the spirit of bro
therly love.
Rev. Howard was formerly a mem
ber of the Stanford Faculty in the
Department of Economics and is at
present a well known Unitarian min
ister of Los Angeles. Mrs. Blanch
