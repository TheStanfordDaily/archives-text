I'.ditor Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:â€”Allow me to enter a
protest in your columns against the
practice, indulged in by a large por
tion of the Student Body, of throw
ing paper wrappers and envelopes
along the pathway leading from the
Post Office to the Quad. It certain
ly does not add to the appearance
(this section of the Campus and
casts no uncertain reflection upon
the habits of those who are guilty
of this carelessness.
