# CROSS-COUNTRY PLANS
## TROPHIES FOR EVENT WILL SOON BE HERE. Distance Men Will Probably Run November 30thâ€”Many Entries Are Expected. 
### 
Two silver cups that are offered
by the Quadrangle Club for the
winner and second man in the
cross-country run have been ordered
from a Philadelphia firm and are ex
pected to reach the campus within
the next few days. These are hand
some trophies and will be offered
each year to encourage cross-country
running which is now fairly well es
tablished. The cross-country run
this fall, in which the men will com
pete for these cups, is to be held
two or three weeks from last Sat
urday and t.he details will prob
ably be arranged by Trainer Moul
ton and Captain Lanagan, of the
track team, within the next few days.
E. J. Nash, '08, and W. C. Shelton,
'08, are the two men who have had
charge of the cross-country runners
this fall and they will be consulted
in ararnging for this first event.
In speaking of the chances for a
large number of entries and spirited
com petitions for the cups, E. J.
Nash, varsity two-miler, said: "1
believe we will have a good many
men entered in this first cross
country run for the Quadrangle
Club trophies. The distance has
not been determined, but it will
proably be three or three and a half
miles. There are quite a number of
men out for cross-country running
who have never done any track work
and it would not surprise me to see
some unknown runner capture this
cup." Although Nash believes that
there will be plenty of interest in
the event this year he thinks that it
would be wise to make this cross
country event a handicap affair, as
be fears that some one man may
come here who is exceptionally
good in this line of running and he
will be certain of winning the cup
as long as lie is in college, which
will tend to kill the interest among
great many others who would cer
tainly try for the cups if it was a
') and leap event. Should the affair
made a handicap event one cup
ould be offered to the winner and
> if) the man who makes the best
vtual time over the route. This
lan will doubtless be considered by
those in charge of the arrangements,
but it is undecided at present wheth
er there will be any handicaps in
the contest this month.
Both "Dad" Moulton and Cap
tain Lanagan are pleased over the
interest in cross-country and hope
to see a keen competition in the
events this year.
