# TO PLAY OLD GAME HERE
## BELMONT AND HARVARD TEAMS CLASH NEXT SATURDAY. Interesting Exhibition of American Football Soon To Be Seen on Stanford Field. 
### 
On Stanford Field next Saturday
afternoon the lovers of American foot
ball will be given an opportunity to
display their enthusiasm, when the
elevens of Belmont Academy and
Harvard School, of Los Angeles, face
each other to fight for the champion
ship. The game should be fraught
•villi spectacular and exciting plays,
as both the contesting teams are
light, fast and thoroughly trained in
the more open points of revised Am
erican football.
The Belmont eleven has the ad
vantage of being coached by W. T.
Held, Jr., of Harvard fame, who him
self has been one of the leaders and
authorities in the radical changes
which have lately been made in the
old game. Accordingly, in the play
of his charges there will doubtless
be exhibited the many intricacies and
different phases of football, as it now
is.
Against the speedy Harvard team
Belmont will have to put up a
strong fight to make a successful
showing; The Southerners are said
to have one of the best all-round
teams they have possessed in years,
| and although relatively handicapped
in the lack of a world-renowned
I coach, they will give their opponents
j a. close match.
Last fall the Belmont eleven met
I the Harvard players on the latters*
campus and had 110 difficulty in de
feating them by a score of 30 to 0.
At that time the Academy team was
coached by W. E. Lyons, '07. This
season, however, there is 110 reason
to expect such a one-sided result, as
1 all indications point to the evenness
of the rival elevens.
