# RECEIPTS ANNOUNCED
## PROCEEDS OF GAME SATURDAY LESS THAN AVERAGE. Stanford To Receive $10,700. Crowd About 11,000 in Number. Expenses $600. 
### 
The receipts for the game have
been given out by Graduate Manager
Guy Knupp of the Student Body as
being $22,000. These are the gross
receipts and the expenses will
amount to $600, $200 paid to the
referee for his services, $200 for
printing, and approximately $200
for incidental expenses.
The net receipts of Stanford will
be about $1 0,700. The estimated at
tendance is slightly above 11,000,
which is about 1,000 less than that
o!" the 12-5 game two years ago. Last
year the gross receipts were $27,186
or some $5,000 greater than this
year. Two years ago the gross pro
cees were $24,000.
The difference in the figures of
this year and last is attributed to the
larger average attendance at the
Berkeley stadium, while the differ
ence of two years ago may be the
difference in interest between the
American and Rugby games.
