# Glee Club Postpones Tryout.
## 
### 
A tryout for the Glee Club was
held last evening in the Chapel but
as very few of the men's voices were
in condition, it was decided by the
Executive Committee to postpone the
final test until tomorrow evening at
7:30.
At present there are forty-seven
members of the club, but this num
ber will be reduced to twenty-four
for the Christmas trip.
