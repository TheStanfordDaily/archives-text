# VARSITY WILL GO NORTH
## RUGBY MEN ARE PRACTICALLY ASSURED OF TRIP. Will Engage Vancouver Champions In Series For Possession of Cooper-Keith Trophy. 
### 
It is now practically an assured
fact that the Varsity Rugby fifteen
will make the trip North to Van
couver during the mid-winter vaca
tion to meet the cracks of British
Columbia in a championship set of
games. Prior to the Intercollegiate
game with the University of Califor
nia, Student Body Manager Guy
lvnupp was in communication with
the managers of the northern players
and learned that it had been decided
to invite the winner of the Stanford-
California game to engage in a ser
ies of games. It. now falls to the lot
oi Stanford to meet the players of
Canada.
Added interest has been given the
match by the donation of a hand
some and elaborate trophy cup which
is being made in Hong Kong and
will be known as the Cooper-Keith
cup in honor of the donor, J. Coop
er-Keitli, a wealthy Rugby enthusi
ast of Vancouver. The cup is to cost
in the neighborhood of $2,000. It
is a perpetual challenge trophy, to
be competed for, according to Keith,
by the winning team of the Vancou
ver Rugby Union and the winner of
ihe Intercollegiate game here.
All financial arrangements have
been satisfactorily arranged by Man
ager Knupp and it appears that all
that remains is to secure the official
sanction of the Faculty Committee
on Athletics and the Executive Com
mittee. Any objection from this quar
ter is not expected as several are
known to favor the idea.
The Stanford Varsity made much
the same trip last year after defeat
ii g (he Blue and Gold. Four games
were played last season. Stanford
was defeated twice by the Vancou
ver team by the scores of 9 to 11
and 3 to 0 and one tie at 3 to 3.
The Cardinal was victorious in the
hist game with the Victoria team by
the score of 11 to 0.
It is understood the championship
siries for the cup offered will be the
best two out of three games. Ref
eree George .Tenldnson who officia
ted at the two matches this year
will probably be retained in a like
capacity for the championship games.
The eighteen men who entered the
game Saturday together with one or
both the coaches and Manager Knupp
will make the trip. The Glee and
Mandolin Clubs will probably make
the trip in company with the foot
ball players.
