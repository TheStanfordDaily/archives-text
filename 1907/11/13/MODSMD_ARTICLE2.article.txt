# BANKS USE CERTIFICATES
## DEPOSITORS ARE BEING PAID IN CLEARING HOUSE PAPER. Local Institutions Co-operating To Relieve Money Stringency. Draft Deposits Accepted. 
### 
In an article which appeared in
last night's issue of the Daily Palo
Alto dealing with the local bank
ing situation, an injustice was done
to the First National Bank. When
seen today Cashier E. King said:
' The banks of this community are
on an equal footing and doing busi
ness in the sainG way. Our policy is
to accommodate, as far as possible,
ali our regular customers. We are
accepting outside checks and drafts
for deposit and are paying deposit
ors in clearing house certificates.
"We are paying cash to those de
positors, however, who are in abso
lute need of it and to whom, through
force of circumstances, the clearing
house certificates would not be of any
vi lue. If everyone would open an
account with one of the banks and
pay their bills by check, the need
for currency would be lessened and
the local situation much improved.
Checks drawn on any of the banks
here are honored by all the business
men and by the other banks."
Cashier C. S. Downing of the Bank
of Palo Alto corroborated Cashier
King's statement and said: "All the
banks are working under the same
general conditions and are co-oper
ating with each other to allay, as
far as possible, the money stringency.
Drafts are being accepted for deposit
and customers are being paid in
clearing house certificates."
