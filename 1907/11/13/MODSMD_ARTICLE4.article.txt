# PREPARING THE GROUNDS
## SENIOR MEN ARE PUTTING UP STRUCTURES FOR CIRCUS. New Concessions Constantly Coming In, and Enclosure Will Be Filled Friday Night. 
### 
All the men of the Senior Class
turned out on the football field this
afternoon to assist in rushing the
work of the Circus. A large part ot
the lighting apparatus is now up,
;iihl the installation of the trans
formers will complete the arrange
ments.
The Y. M. C. A. "shoot the
chutes," on the south side of the
field, is nearing completion. It
starts high up on the bleachers and
extends for some distance onto the
field, but will he entirely safe for
women and children.
Care is being taken to have all the
fixtures of the circus in such con
dition that they can be removed
very rapidly on Saturday morning,
so as not to interfere with the foot
ball game in the afternoon. It is
also designed to keep the travel as
much as possible around the side
lines, in order to spare the turf.
The center of the field will be oc
cupied by F. A. Curtin's sideshow,
exhibiting five remarkable freaks.
Next to the Inside Inn the frame for
housing Wilson's electrical display
is up. The exhibition was given a
trial last night, and proved very al
tiactive and successful. Next to Wil
son's building three other very largo
structures for different concessions
1 ave been commenced.
New concessions have been com
ing in rapidly. E. W. Sawyer, '08,
has arranged for an exhibition and
has begun bis structure. The Me
chanical Engineering Society has se
cured another mysterious conces
sion. African Dodgers, a Country
Store, a Shooting Gallery, and the
Half-Woman have all been provid
ed for, while one of the students
will act as a lightning sketch artist.
There will be several varieties of
games of chance, and also an elab
orate weighing machine with weigh!
gi essers.
The committee has made arrange
ments to have plenty of pure water
hauled to the Inside Inn for the pub
lic, and also announces that Chef
i ierre Savignon of the St. Francis
will officiate there, and introduce
bis famous dish, Salchicha Bizcocho.
The evening performance will be
commenced by the open-air show,
which is free; but after that the
bleachers will be cleared.
