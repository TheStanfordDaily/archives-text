The Academic Council of the Uni

scholarship requirements and here

have to make eight units of required
work each semester.
No examinations will be given at
ilie end of the semester to enable
students, who have failed, to regain
their status, except by special per
mission from the committee of deans
and on recommendation by the in
structor.
This action on the part of the
university authorities indicates that
only those who have failed in their

be permitted to take any tests to re
gain their standing.
