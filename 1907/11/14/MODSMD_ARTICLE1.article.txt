# LAUDS STANFORD SPIRIT
## DOUGLAS ERSKINE TELLS WHY CARDINAL IS VICTORIOUS. Says Close Association of Men on the Campus Makes Them Better Fighters. 
### 
The continued successes of the
Cardinal Varsity teams since J. F.
Lanagan was appointed coach, have
been the subject of much comment
by newspapers and magazines. This
ii especially true since Stanford won
her fourth successive football vic
tory from California. Perhaps the
best of these comments is an arti
cle by Douglas Erskine, a promin
ent newspaper and sporting writer
of Snn Francisco. Erskine has played
both American football and Rugby
and is an authority on the subject.
His article, as it appeared in the San
Francisco Examiner, follows:
For the fourth time in succession
the football players of the Univer
sity of California have gone down
to defeat before the men of Stanford
University, and again the question is
being asked, Why does Stanford win
so regularly? Those who wear the
ribbons of Blue and Gold when the
colleges meet on the football field
are wondering what it is that makes
their representatives losers every
time, and the question is still un
answered.
When the teams trot on the field
there is nothing to show that Cali
fornia is not as good as Stanford.
On Saturday last the man who had
dropped in from Mars or New Zeal
and or any other place except Ber
keley or Palo Alto, would have had
a difficult task if he had set himself
to pick the winning team from its
looks. A majority of those who knew
nothing of the players would have
selected the California fifteen. In
their blue jerseys with the golden
stripes on the sleeves the fifteen
from the Stat*> University looked
strong and well trained. They ap
peared to be a litle bigger than their
opponents, and when the game com
menced the first part showed that
they had something on Stanford
when it came to shoving in scrums
and taking the ball along with drib
bling rushes and footwork. But ev
er after the first half was ended and
the score stood 8 to 5 in favor of
the California team, there were few
on the field who were willing to
claim that. California was superior
and would prove a winner.
The Lanagan Spirit.
The second half brought out the
same latent fighting spiril which won
for Stanford two years ago and
which has now become a part, of the
game which the students of the uni
versity down in Santa Clara County
look for. Stanford calls it "Lana
gan spirit"; Lanagan calls it "Stan
ford spirit," and probably both are
right.
Since Lanagan has taken charge
of the coaching at. Palo Alto each of
the five teams which he has prepared
for the games with California has
shown a wonderful determination,
which pervades their playing all
through, and is especially in evi

(•once when things are going against
the Cardinal. Lanagan's first team
■was not conceded a chance against
the array of veterans which Califor
nia putin the field in 190:}. The
Cardinal electrified the audience by
scoring in the first half and holding
down their formidable opponents un
til close to the end of the game when
the California team succeeded in ty
ing the score, through the clever
work of "Heine" Heitmuller, who
blocked a kick and enabled his side
to get even. The following year was
a, triupmh for Lanagan. His team,
playing a game in which a bewilder
ing series of "split, bucks" was mix
ed up with fast, straight football,
smothered the California team by 18
to 0. Then came the game which in
augurated the new Stanford Field.
California was considered a sure
winner. Coached by two of Dart
mouth's best exponents of all that
was up to date in football, the Cal
ifornia team was conceded the vic
tory by everyone but the faithful
Stanford students, who could only
say, "We have the men and we have
Lanagan," and Stanford won.
Stanford's victory in the first Rug-
In game, which was won on two pen
ally goals against one try, gave Cal
ifornia the impression that even
with the final score against them the
players had done better than their
opponents, inasmuch as they had
crossed the Stanford line while Stan
ford had not been able to score a
try on California, and with almost
the same team in Saturday's game
it was reasonable to suppose that
the Blue and Gold would do as well
if not better, but that intangible
"spirit" was again in evidence. Stan
ford took the upper hand and in the !
last fifteen minutes of the game sim
ply ran over their opponents and !
made a victory, already won, doub
ly sure by scoring twice in the last
few minutes of the game.
Condition Not the Trouble.
Some say it was the condition of
the men. I don't think so. Cali- j
fornia did not play like a tired team
in the last stages of the game on
Saturday. There may have been a
sinking of the heart as the players
realized that victory was not for
them, but to my mind it was simply
the superior skill of the Stanford
players, held down for a while by
California's aggressive work, assert
ing itself.
The Stanford spirit, to my mind,
i ; simply the result of the "brother
hood" which prevails on the Palo Al
| to Campus. There the students, liv
, ing in the same environment, see
I each other day after day and become
like one family. Two strangers fight
ing side by side cannot do so well as
; two friends, and two friends cannot
do as much as two brothers, and the
| fraternal spirit developed on the
I Stanford Campus is an asset which
helps considerably when the men go
on the field against a combination
I of players, most of whom see each
j other only during class hours, and
have not the feeling of comrade
1 ship which prevails among those who
i eat and sleep, work and play and
fight and fraternize within the coni
! piiss of the Stanford University Cam
| pus.
All credit is due to "Jimmy" Lan-

for bringing this spirit to its
highest point, and for his great work
with Stanford football and baseball
teams, but it must not be forgotten
that the coaches who have directed
the destinies of California's teams
have Ixien laboring under a handi
cap, and that some of the players
on the Rugby teams which have
played for California during the last,
two years have not been able to
bear in mind that they were play
ing not for themselves, but for their
college.
While it is every man's privilege
to express his dissatisfaction with
the style of game that is being play
ed, when he once dons a Rugby suit
he should make it his business to do
everything in his power to bring vic
tory to his university and think on
ly of that instead of harboring a
feeling of resentment which must of
necessity make his playing less val
uable to his side than that of a
cheerful worker.
California has lots of material and
a first-class coach. There must be
something the matter with the
men or Stanford could not con
i tinue its victorious career. Let
some of the philosophers at Ber
keley discover the cause of the trou
ble and then let the authorities
quickly remove it.

ifornia team was conceded the vic
tory by everyone but the faithful
Stanford students, who could only
say, "We have the men and we have
Lanagan," and Stanford won.
Stanford's victory in the first Rug-
In game, which was won on two pen
ally goals against one try, gave Cal
ifornia the impression that even
with the final score against them the
players had done better than their
opponents, inasmuch as they had
crossed the Stanford line while Stan
ford had not been able to score a
try on California, and with almost
the same team in Saturday's game
it was reasonable to suppose that
the Blue and Gold would do as well
if not better, but that intangible
"spirit" was again in evidence. Stan
ford took the upper hand and in the !
last fifteen minutes of the game sim
ply ran over their opponents and !
made a victory, already won, doub
ly sure by scoring twice in the last
few minutes of the game.
Condition Not the Trouble.
Some say it was the condition of
the men. I don't think so. Cali- j
fornia did not play like a tired team
in the last stages of the game on
Saturday. There may have been a
sinking of the heart as the players
realized that victory was not for
them, but to my mind it was simply
the superior skill of the Stanford
players, held down for a while by
California's aggressive work, assert
ing itself.
The Stanford spirit, to my mind,
i ; simply the result of the "brother
hood" which prevails on the Palo Al
| to Campus. There the students, liv
, ing in the same environment, see
I each other day after day and become
like one family. Two strangers fight
ing side by side cannot do so well as
; two friends, and two friends cannot
do as much as two brothers, and the
| fraternal spirit developed on the
I Stanford Campus is an asset which
helps considerably when the men go
on the field against a combination
I of players, most of whom see each
j other only during class hours, and
have not the feeling of comrade
1 ship which prevails among those who
i eat and sleep, work and play and
fight and fraternize within the coni
! piiss of the Stanford University Cam
| pus.
All credit is due to "Jimmy" Lan-

for bringing this spirit to its
highest point, and for his great work
with Stanford football and baseball
teams, but it must not be forgotten
that the coaches who have directed
the destinies of California's teams
have Ixien laboring under a handi
cap, and that some of the players
on the Rugby teams which have
played for California during the last,
two years have not been able to
bear in mind that they were play
ing not for themselves, but for their
college.
While it is every man's privilege
to express his dissatisfaction with
the style of game that is being play
ed, when he once dons a Rugby suit
he should make it his business to do
everything in his power to bring vic
tory to his university and think on
ly of that instead of harboring a
feeling of resentment which must of
necessity make his playing less val
uable to his side than that of a
cheerful worker.
California has lots of material and
a first-class coach. There must be
something the matter with the
men or Stanford could not con
i tinue its victorious career. Let
some of the philosophers at Ber
keley discover the cause of the trou
ble and then let the authorities
quickly remove it.
The continued successes of the
Cardinal Varsity teams since J. F.
Lanagan was appointed coach, have
been the subject of much comment
by newspapers and magazines. This
ii especially true since Stanford won
her fourth successive football vic
tory from California. Perhaps the
best of these comments is an arti
cle by Douglas Erskine, a promin
ent newspaper and sporting writer
of Snn Francisco. Erskine has played
both American football and Rugby
and is an authority on the subject.
His article, as it appeared in the San
Francisco Examiner, follows:
For the fourth time in succession
the football players of the Univer
sity of California have gone down
to defeat before the men of Stanford
University, and again the question is
being asked, Why does Stanford win
so regularly? Those who wear the
ribbons of Blue and Gold when the
colleges meet on the football field
are wondering what it is that makes
their representatives losers every
time, and the question is still un
answered.
When the teams trot on the field
there is nothing to show that Cali
fornia is not as good as Stanford.
On Saturday last the man who had
dropped in from Mars or New Zeal
and or any other place except Ber
keley or Palo Alto, would have had
a difficult task if he had set himself
to pick the winning team from its
looks. A majority of those who knew
nothing of the players would have
selected the California fifteen. In
their blue jerseys with the golden
stripes on the sleeves the fifteen
from the Stat*> University looked
strong and well trained. They ap
peared to be a litle bigger than their
opponents, and when the game com
menced the first part showed that
they had something on Stanford
when it came to shoving in scrums
and taking the ball along with drib
bling rushes and footwork. But ev
er after the first half was ended and
the score stood 8 to 5 in favor of
the California team, there were few
on the field who were willing to
claim that. California was superior
and would prove a winner.
The Lanagan Spirit.
The second half brought out the
same latent fighting spiril which won
for Stanford two years ago and
which has now become a part, of the
game which the students of the uni
versity down in Santa Clara County
look for. Stanford calls it "Lana
gan spirit"; Lanagan calls it "Stan
ford spirit," and probably both are
right.
Since Lanagan has taken charge
of the coaching at. Palo Alto each of
the five teams which he has prepared
for the games with California has
shown a wonderful determination,
which pervades their playing all
through, and is especially in evi

(•once when things are going against
the Cardinal. Lanagan's first team
■was not conceded a chance against
the array of veterans which Califor
nia putin the field in 190:}. The
Cardinal electrified the audience by
scoring in the first half and holding
down their formidable opponents un
til close to the end of the game when
the California team succeeded in ty
ing the score, through the clever
work of "Heine" Heitmuller, who
blocked a kick and enabled his side
to get even. The following year was
a, triupmh for Lanagan. His team,
playing a game in which a bewilder
ing series of "split, bucks" was mix
ed up with fast, straight football,
smothered the California team by 18
to 0. Then came the game which in
augurated the new Stanford Field.
California was considered a sure
winner. Coached by two of Dart
mouth's best exponents of all that
was up to date in football, the Cal
ifornia team was conceded the vic
tory by everyone but the faithful
Stanford students, who could only
say, "We have the men and we have
