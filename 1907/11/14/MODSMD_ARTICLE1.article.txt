# LAUDS STANFORD SPIRIT
## DOUGLAS ERSKINE TELLS WHY CARDINAL IS VICTORIOUS. Says Close Association of Men on the Campus Makes Them Better Fighters. 
### 
The continued successes of the
Cardinal Varsity teams since J. F.
Lanagan was appointed coach, have
been the subject of much comment
by newspapers and magazines. This
ii especially true since Stanford won
her fourth successive football vic
tory from California. Perhaps the
best of these comments is an arti
cle by Douglas Erskine, a promin
ent newspaper and sporting writer
of Snn Francisco. Erskine has played
both American football and Rugby
and is an authority on the subject.
His article, as it appeared in the San
Francisco Examiner, follows:
For the fourth time in succession
the football players of the Univer
sity of California have gone down
to defeat before the men of Stanford
University, and again the question is
being asked, Why does Stanford win
so regularly? Those who wear the
ribbons of Blue and Gold when the
colleges meet on the football field
are wondering what it is that makes
their representatives losers every
time, and the question is still un
answered.
When the teams trot on the field
there is nothing to show that Cali
fornia is not as good as Stanford.
On Saturday last the man who had
dropped in from Mars or New Zeal
and or any other place except Ber
keley or Palo Alto, would have had
a difficult task if he had set himself
to pick the winning team from its
looks. A majority of those who knew
nothing of the players would have
selected the California fifteen. In
their blue jerseys with the golden
stripes on the sleeves the fifteen
from the Stat*> University looked
strong and well trained. They ap
peared to be a litle bigger than their
opponents, and when the game com
menced the first part showed that
they had something on Stanford
when it came to shoving in scrums
and taking the ball along with drib
bling rushes and footwork. But ev
er after the first half was ended and
the score stood 8 to 5 in favor of
the California team, there were few
on the field who were willing to
claim that. California was superior
and would prove a winner.
The Lanagan Spirit.
The second half brought out the
same latent fighting spiril which won
for Stanford two years ago and
which has now become a part, of the
game which the students of the uni
versity down in Santa Clara County
look for. Stanford calls it "Lana
gan spirit"; Lanagan calls it "Stan
ford spirit," and probably both are
right.
Since Lanagan has taken charge
of the coaching at. Palo Alto each of
the five teams which he has prepared
for the games with California has
shown a wonderful determination,
which pervades their playing all
through, and is especially in evi

(•once when things are going against
the Cardinal. Lanagan's first team
■was not conceded a chance against
the array of veterans which Califor
nia putin the field in 190:}. The
Cardinal electrified the audience by
scoring in the first half and holding
down their formidable opponents un
til close to the end of the game when
the California team succeeded in ty
ing the score, through the clever
work of "Heine" Heitmuller, who
blocked a kick and enabled his side
to get even. The following year was
a, triupmh for Lanagan. His team,
playing a game in which a bewilder
ing series of "split, bucks" was mix
ed up with fast, straight football,
smothered the California team by 18
to 0. Then came the game which in
augurated the new Stanford Field.
California was considered a sure
winner. Coached by two of Dart
mouth's best exponents of all that
