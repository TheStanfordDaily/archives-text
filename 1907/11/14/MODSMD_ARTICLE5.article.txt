# MYSTERY YET UNSOLVED
## FINDING OF SILENT'S SHOTGUN SHEDS NO LIGHT ON CASE. One Barrel of Gun Discharge.-Sheriff To Take No Further Action In the Matter. 
### 
"The examination of Silont's shot,
sun has had no other result than to
confirm the theory that his death was
. accidental. Under the circumstances
no further action will be taken in
the matter l>y the Sheriff's otlice."
The above statement was made by
Sheriff Langford this morning after
he had completed his examination
of the shotgun found in Felt Lake
yesterday afternoon. The gun is a
twelve-guage Parker hammerless of
! a late pattern and is badly rusted.
| It has been identified by members,
of the Delta Tan Delta fraternity.
The left barrel has been discharged
| and the cartridge found in the right
! barrel showed that an attempt had
i been made to explode it but for
! some reason it had missed fire. The
i shot which were found imbedded in
| Silent's skull correspond with those
! in the shells with which the gun
was loaded, The finding of the gun
has shed practically no light on the
manner in which Chester Silent met
his death and the status of the case
is the same as when the body was
found.
The gun was discovered by a Slav
onian laborer in the employ of the
University. It was imbedded in the
weeds about two hundred yards from
the dam and midway between the
northwest and southeast banks.
The expense incident to the drain
ing of the lake has been borne by
the University. The final disposi
! tion of the reservoir has not yet
been decided upon by the University
authorities, but it will probably be
thoroughly cleaned out and refilled.
