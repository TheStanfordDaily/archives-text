It is said in the San Francisco
papers that plans are on foot for a
game of American football to be
played at Berkeley on Thanksgiving
day between Alumni teams of Stan
ford and California. We are very
much of the opinion that the so-call
ed Stanford Alumni team will have
in its ranks very few players who
have the right to the name of Stan
ford men. The history of the Alum
ni teams of any university pretty
clearly shows that the college men
are very hard to find in the line-up
on the day of the game, and that the
only reason for placing the univer
sity names in front of the teams
is to delude the public and play up
on a traditional college rivalry in
order to sweii the gate receipts. The
few bona fide graduates who lend
themselves to such a transaction for
get that they injure the name of
their university and often bring their
own organization into disrepute. It
is time that this practice of using
the alumni name with impunity was
plopped and the Association should
take the matter into its hands and
have it. understood that the name
of Stanford Alumni shall apply to
110 team which has not received the
official sanction of that body.
