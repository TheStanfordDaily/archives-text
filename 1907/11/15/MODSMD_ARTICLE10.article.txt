With but a few hours intervening
between the Senior circus and the
Harvard-Belmont game on Stanford
Field there must of necessity be a
large force on hand tomorrow morn
ing to make sure that the work of
clearing away the many booths and
tents be finished at the hour schedul
ed for the contest. The task of remov
ing all the paraphernalia which it
has taken two or three days to put
in place is no light one, and cannot
be accomplished in a short time un
less everyone plans to help. As hosts
of the Belmont and Harvard teams,
we owe it to them to have the field
in condition for their match. To
make this possible every Senior and
Freshman should report promptly
tomorrow and come prepared to do
bis share of the work.
