### 
At a meeting held yesterday af
ternoon in Eneiiui Gymnasium for
the discussion of whether wrestling
could be launched at Stanford us an
interclass sport, B. S. Chaffee, 'OS,
was elected temporary chairman of
the meeting. Action was put off un
til Tuesday afternoon when another
meeting will be held and probably
definite organization will take place.
The idea of this new indoor athletic
activity is not that it shall ever be
come an intercollegiate sport, but
merely an interclass contest.
