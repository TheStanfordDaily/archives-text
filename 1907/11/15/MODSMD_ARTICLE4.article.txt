# Elevens of Belmont and Harvard Meet Tomorrow
## Weill Coached Teams of Rival Academies Will Clash On Stanford Field In American Football Contest. 
### 
The elevens of Harvard and Bel
mont. schools will clash tomorrow
afternoon in the only American
game of football to be played on
Stanford Field this season. At :!
o'clock promptly the initial kick
off will take place and during the
following hour and a half the spec
tutors will undoubtedly be treated to
;> brilliant and spectacular exhibi
tion. The more open formations of
the revised style of football will be
worked to the utmost by both teams
and an exciting struggle must result.
This is the second annual contest
between Harvard and Belmont, and
the rival institutions propose to es
tablish a regular precedent. The
elevens have been drilled from the
beginning with a view of reaching
the pink of condition for the battle
tomorrow. Every one of the twenty
two men is ready to put forth his
best efforts, and on the result de
pends the success or failure of the
season. In Los Angeles last Novem- I
ber, Belmont was victorious by a
score of 30 to 0, but it is the gen
eral impression that. Saturday's strug
gle will be far more evenly con- i
tested.
Harvard's coach is F. H. Boren,
'02, a once prominent Cardinal foot
ball man and a strong, reliable full- i
back. Boren has held the position of
head coach at Harvard School for
several seasons, and he has invaria
bly turned out consistent, hard-work- |
ing teams. His material this fall is
said to have been exceptionally pro
mising.

W. T. Reid, Jr., of Harvard Uni
versity, lias supervised the practice
of the Belmont squad, and this alone
j insures an eleven of speed and clev
erness. Reid has sought to teach
his charges the many advantages to
! bo derived from the new plays offer
| ed, since the revision of the Amer
; lean game. The work of his men
should afford a clear idea of foot
ball of the present day. This will
| be the first chance of the Stanford
undergraduates.to compare the new
I and old styles of the collegiate game.
Belmont has a considerable ad
\ vantage over her opponents in
weight. The Northerners average
1 r>7 pounds to the man. while the
average of the Southerners is seven
pounds less.
IÂ£. Drown, of Los Angeles, cap
tains the Harvard eleven. His po
sition is at. full. The Belmont team
is headed by G. P. Morgan, of Wil
cox, Ariz., who has held this honor
for two successive years. Morgan
plays left end.
The Seniors promise that the field
will be entirely cleared long before
the time scheduled for the game to

begin. To assure this, the Fresh
men have been requested to assist
the fourth-year men tomorrow morn
ing in removing the circus fixtures.
The University Band will assemble
01. the bleachers tomorrow and will
render selections before the contest
and during the intermission.
Admission to the match will be
fifty cents. The elevens will line up
