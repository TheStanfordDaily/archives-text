# BELMONT BESTS HARVARD
## 14 TO O IS FINAL SCORE OF SATURDAY'S STRUGGLE. American Football As Played By Academy Elevens Is Slow and Uninteresting. 
### 
On Stanford Field last Saturday
afternoon, before a crowd of 1200
people, the Belmont School football
team decisively bested the eleven
from Harvard in a poor exhibition of
the revised American game. The fi
nal score stood 14 to 0. The match
lacked every element ol' speed and
interest and was subject to frequent
long delays for injuries. Coach Pres
ley expressed the general opinion of
the assemblage, when he character
ized the struggle as "an entirely in
adequate substitute for the old style
ot football."
During the first half Belmont was
unable to get her plays properly
started, and this, together with the
miserable handling of punts in the
backfield, kept the score down to
2 to 0 before the intermission. But
in the second half Reid's team clear
ly demonstrated its superiority, twice
forcing the ball over the opposing
goal line in a succession of cleverly
executed plays. Harvard's backs
could do nothing against Belmont's
strong and well trained defence, and
not once were the Southerners able
to gain their yards. Harvard did
excel her opponents, however, in
kicking, in handling kicks, and in
getting down under punts.
Captain Morgan, Sbarboro and
Tuttle were the stars of the Belmont
eleven, while the playing of Captain
Brown, the Harvard full, was con
spicuous throughout the battle.
The game had only started when
the Southerners were forced to punt
on their own 13-yard line. Me
serve's pass was wild, and Morgan
fell on the ball, after it had rolled
across the goal, scoring two points
on the safety.
During the remainder of the half
the play was almost wholly in Har
vard's territory, although her line
was never seriously threatened. Bel
i lout lost many yards through the
inefficiency of Dorr in the backfield.
Shortly before the call of time
Brown, of Harvard, attempted a
placement kick from the 30-yard
line, but the ball was effectively
blocked.
The second half was still young,
when Reid received Dorr's forward
pass and ran forty-four yards for the
first touch-down of the game. Hill
kicked an easy goal. Towards the
end of the period Belmont again
rushed the pigskin within striking
distance, and first down was declared
cn the 9-yard line. Two bucks gained
six yards, and then Morgan was sent
through for a touch-down just ten
seconds before the call of time. Again
Hill converted, and the final score |
was 14 to 0.
