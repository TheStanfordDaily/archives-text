Trainer Moulton has issued a call
tor the Freshmen track men to meet
him tomorrow evening to discuss in
an informal way plans for the coming
track season and the annual Inter
collegiate Freshman meet. It is hard
ly necessary to urge the men who
have already had experience on tin
der path and field to be present, but
we wish to bring to the attention of
those who have done no track work
as yet that Moulton's invitation in
cludes them and in fact is intended
primarily for them. Track is prac
tically the only branch of college
athletics which a Freshman without
experience may take up with a goo.l
chance of success. It means plen
ty of hard work, and a faithful ad
herence to the unit teresting grind
of training, but a point in the var
sity meet is well worth a sacrifice,
and in addition no man goes through
a season's training without becoming
lietter physically for it. The Cardinal
has an unfortunate record in the
Freshman meets which we hope to
see broken next spring. Toward that
end the first essential is to give Stan
ford's veteran trainer plenty of ma
terial from which to develop a team.
We ask every Freshman, whether he
has ever worn a spiked shoe or not,
to attend the meeting tomorrow ev
ening and put his name on "Dad
Moulton's list.
