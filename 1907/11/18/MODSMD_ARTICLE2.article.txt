# SENIORS PRESENT CIRCUS
## 1908 PRODUCTION IS A DECIDED SUCCESS. Large Crowd Attends, But Profits Will Not Be as Large as Last Year. 
### 
On Friday evening Stanford Field
was covered with a crowd of stu
dents and Palo Alto residents who
i furnished patronage for the Senior
circus until a late hour. There were
about 1500 paid admissions, a hun
dred more than attended the 1907
performance last year. During the
fiee performance the entire central
part of the south bleachers was fill
ed, and when the- throng poured
| down onto the turf the scene was
I decidedly brilliant.
The most amusing feature of the
j open show was the broncho-busting
performance, when two mounted
cowboys dashed up and began to be
labor a saw-horse. Members of the
Gymnasium Club furnished a high
class exhibition of tumbling and pyr
| amid-forming. Two bands, with a
large number of the circus perform
ers, paraded around the grounds and
jin front of the bleachers for some
| time.
At the conclusion of the free ex-
I hibition the spielers began to an
| nounee the attractions of the dif
ferent concessions, and the crowd
| thronged down upon the turf. All
jof the sideshows were well adver-
I Used, but Dido, presented by the Be
ta Theta Pi fraternity, seemed to
have a little the advantage in repre
sentation. The games of chance at
Tonopah, however, drew a large
crowd.
Confetti, sold by the Senior wo
! men, added to the carnival aspect of
the grounds, while one of the bands
kept \i)) its production of music dur
ing most of the evening.
A cash prize of fifteen dollars for
the best feature in the street par
ade was awarded to E. E. Haskell,
'08, who represented a charioteer in
a Roman chariot. The long "Kiss
ing Bug" of the Delta Upsilon frater
nity was judged the best exhibit in
(he inside parade, and was awarded
an ornamental stein. Honorable men
lion was given to the Sigma Nu fra
ternity's representation of "How Our
Founder Got His Start," in the out
side parade and to the elephant en
tered by the Theta Delta,Chi frater
nity in the inside parade.
The total amount taken in was
near $1400. A good many items of
expense have still to be taken into
account, and the net profit, to the
class will not he known for some
time, but it will probably be in the
neighborhood of $sfln Twenty per
cent of the profits will be used by the
Seniors to further the interests of
boating at the University. The pre
sent stringency of the financial sit
uation undoubtedly lessened the re
ceipts, and the unusual expense the
class incurred for lighting and other
features also helped to reduce the
profits, as the Class of 1 907 cleared
nearly $700 from their performance.
