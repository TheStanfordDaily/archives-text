Tomorrow night at 7:30, at the
Training House, "Dad" Moulton will
speak to the Freshmen upon the
necessity of coming out for track
work. Since the Intercollegiate
Freshman track meet was inaugur
ated two years ago, California has
won both these contests and Trainer
Moulton wants to develop as strong
a 191.1 team as possible, so that he
can break this string of defeats.
