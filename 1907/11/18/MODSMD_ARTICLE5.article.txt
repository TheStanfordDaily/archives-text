## 
### 
The Freshman debating team has
decided to nphold the negative of the
question, "Resolved, That Japan
ese laborers should be excluded from
continental America." which was sub
mitted by the Sophomore team last
v/eek. The date for the debate has
not as yet been definitely settled as
the Bonnheim discussion takes place
on December 6, the evening for
which the interclass debate was sche
duled. The committee in charge will
endeavor to avoid any conflict be
tween the two events.
