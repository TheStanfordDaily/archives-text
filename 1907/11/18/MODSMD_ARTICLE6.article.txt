# PAPER MONEY PLENTIFUL
## CLEARING HOUSE CERTIFICATES ARE ON SOUND BASIS. All Merchants of Palo Alto Accept Paper Money as Means of Payment. 
### 
The banks of Palo Alto, namely,
the First National and the Bank of
Palo Alto, are carrying on their bus
iness the same as last week. Clear
ing house certificates are still arriv
ing from San Francisco as a means
ol' payment, and these certificates are
perfectly sound. For every seventy
five dollars of certificates issued the
clearing house of San Francisco is
depositing one hundred dollars,
thereby insuring an immediate re
demption when the money stringen
cy eases up.
When interviewed this afternoon
in regard to the payments made by
the Bank of Palo Alto, C. S. Down
ing, cashier of that bank, said:
"Checks on our bank are payable in
their full amount, the medium of
payment being clearing house certi
ficates in the denominations of twen
ties, tens, fives twos and ones. The
merchants of Palo Alto are accept
ing this paper the same as cash, as
the merchants know of its soundness.
As to deposits of outside checks, we
accept them for deposit and then
make the depositors small payments.
We are not cashing checks on out
side banks."
E. King of the First National Bank
made practically the same statement
concerning that institution. Both
banks will pay out a small amount of
cash if they are convinced that it is
absolutely necessary.
The Mayfield Bank and Trust Com
pany, with a branch at the Stanford
Bookstore, are doing business as be
fore the money stringency, except
that payment on checks from outside
are held until exchanges from said
outside banks are received. They are
cashing checks on their own bank
up to ten dollars and are issuing very
little paper. However, they accept
the certificates on deposit.
