### 
At the banquet to the Rugby fif
teen at the University Restaurant
last night il was definitely decided
that the team would go north during
the Christmas holidays. The tour
was discussed, and tentative plans
adopted. The men will go into light
training and begin easy practice
about the first of December.
Immediately after the close of the
semester the team will leave the Uni
versity, going direct to Vancouver,
where a series of three games will be
played with the fifteen of that city
for the possession of the J. Cooper-

two of these matches will take place
on Christmas and New Years Day,
and the third on the twenty-ninth
of December. A fourth contest, with
the Victorian team at Victoria, will
be played, according to the present
plans, after the games with Vancou
ver, probably on the fourth of Janu
ary. The Stanford fifteen will return
to the University immediately there
after.
The number of men who will make
the trip is as yet undecided. If suit
able financial arrangements can be
secured, five substitutes will accom
pany the team, but otherwise only
four will be taken. With the fifteen
will go Manager Knupp and one or
both of the coaches.
The annual banquet tendered to
