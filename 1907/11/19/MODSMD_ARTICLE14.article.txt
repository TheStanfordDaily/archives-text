Four weeks ago a canvass of the
Student Body with the object of de
termining the sentiment in favor of
or against Rugby would undoubtedly
have resulted in a decision for the
American style of play. Today, with
the object lessons of last Saturday
and the week before fresh in our
minds, we believe a vote upon this
subject would swing far the other
way and show a good-sized majority
of undergraduates who are not only
satisfied but enthusiastic over the
English game, and convinced that
its possibilities are just beginning
to be realized. The death of the
old game here brought with it, as
was natural, a great regret for the
passing of the only Intercollegiate
gridiron struggle we knew and one
which had become firmly fixed its ;i
part of our undergraduate life. The
first season under Rugby rules did
not tend to change this sentiment
but rather to increase it, for in both
preliminary and Intercollegiate con
tests the bleachers saw a confusing
tangle of penalties and plays which,
they did not understand, occasionally
enlivened by a brilliant bit of open
work or some pretty kicking. This
fall has seen a change. With the
return of those veterans who played
in Vancouver last Christinas, and
with the experience gained by Lana-j
gan and Presley in New Zealand and
Australia as a basis to work upon, a
fifteen was finally developed which
knew the game and began to edu
cate us up to it. The Vancouver and
Varsity matches raised Rugby in the
estimation of everyone, but the one
thing necessary to make a final de
cision inevitable was the sharp con
trast made possible by the Harvard-
Belmont game last Saturday. A cer
tain allowance must be made for
our lack of interest in a preparatory

school contest and also for the fact
that we did not see the revised game
as played by the great elevens, but,
nevertheless, we saw a fair example
of American football and realized
what a fallen idol we have been wor
shiping. With its lack of speed and
brilliance and its tendency to ser
ious injuries, but one conclusion is
possibleâ€”that Rugby is a superior
game and a better intercollegiate
sport.
What agitation there is today for
a return to the old game is purely an
agitation of sentiment.. The only
valid argument for a change is that
playing Rugby we occupy an isolat
ed position in the Intercollegiate ath
letic world and that our relations,
particularly with the middle West,
are severed. To counterbalance this
siate of affairs, we have before 11s
the possibility of annual internation
al matches with the Canadian teams
and the great fifteens of Australia
and New Zealand. Men who follow
collegiate athletics in the East unite
in saying that the American game of
football is doomed and cannot last
live years. California may expect no
move toward the adoption of the re
vised game from us. We believe in
the new sport and we expect it to
stay.
