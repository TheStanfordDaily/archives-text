The election of D. P. Crawford to
lead the varsity fifteen next fall
comes as a well-merited reward for
the many services which this ath
lete has given upon the
football field. The captain-elect has
the confidence of the Student Body
as well as that of his team-mates
and we look for a continuance of
the varsity victories in the season of
1 90S.
