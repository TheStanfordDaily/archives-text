# Coach Taylor Defends Harris.
## 
### 
Through the medium of the press,
Coach Taylor, of California, has re
cently criticized in decisive terms a
San Francisco morning paper for an
article which appeared on the day
following the Intercollegiate Rugby
match. It seems that this article
characterizes Harris, a forward on
the Blue and Gold fifteen, as a shirk
er.
Taylor has several times taken ex
ception to this statement. He de
clares that Harris was knocked in
the head early in the first half and
was in a dazed condition during the
remainder of the game.
