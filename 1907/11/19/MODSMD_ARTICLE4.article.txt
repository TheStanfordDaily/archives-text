### 
Work on the reconstruction of the
University buildings has been pro
gressing rapidly since last semester
under the direction of the Commis
| sion of Engineers. With a few ex
; captions most of the buildings neces
sary for laboratories and recitations
I have been completed.
The stone work along the east
| side of the quadrangle is entirely
i finished including the building that
1 contains the English, History and
Economics departments. The Phy
j sics building, and the Arch between
the Law building and the President's
Office have been finished since last
1 semester. All that is now lacking to
i the completion of the * Chemistry
building is the tiling of a portion of
j the roof, ttie inside repairs having
| been made early in the semester.
A large force of men is at pres
ent at work upon the new Geology
and Metallurgy buildings on the
south side of the quad. The Geolo
gy building is rapidly nearing com
pletion and should be ready for oc
j cupancy in a short time. Work will
| soon be commenced on the corner
iwhere the Engineering department
j has its headquarters. The students
! in this department, however, will not
i be interrupted in their classes.
Nothing as yet has been done in
; the way of rebuilding the Memorial
j cuurch or Museum, as that work will
be postponed until the class-rooms
and laboratories necessary for actual
college work are completed.
