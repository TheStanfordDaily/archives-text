# SELECT COURSE FOR RUN
## FOUR-MILE ROUTE CHOSEN FOR DISTANCE MEN. Many Good Entries To Compete For Cross-country Trophies On Friday. 
### 
Captain Lanagan of the track team
has selected the route to be followed
by the cross-country runners in the
competition for the Quadrangle Club
trophies, which will be held on Fri
day afternoon at 4::>0. The men will
run over a course about four miles
long and the start and finish will be
at the track. The men will run from
the track along the road leading past
the Mausoleum, then on past the
winery, skirting along the edge of
the Stanford residence, joining the
county road near San Francisquito
Creek, then along the county road to
University Avenue and back to the
track. When the men reach there
they will run two laps around the
oval, giving the people on the
bleachers a good chance to see the
finish. Altogether this course, in
cluding one lap around the track be
fore the men take to the road and
the two laps the track at the
finish, will be about four miles.
The cross-country men have been
training faithfully and a large num
ber of entries are expected, includ
ing such well-known distance run
ners as C. 15. Bradford, '09, H. H.
Maundrell, '10, J. E. Shelton, '10,
and.1. P. Hemphill, '09. Besides
these men there are several others
who have not made previous records
on the track, but who have shown
up well in the cross-country practice
and ure expected to prove surprises
i;i the event Friday afternoon.
In speaking of the cross-country
run. Captain Lanagan said: "There
has been a suggestion made that this
cross-country event be made an in
terclass affair and each class enter a
team of four or live men. It. is said
that this would increase the interest
in the event. However, Ido not be
lieve it is necessary to adopt this pol
icy as the handsome trophies which
are offered by the Quadrangle Chib
have aroused interest and the prac
tice this fall shows that, cross-coun
try running is popular at present..
There are probably few men who
would enter this event merely be
cause of the interclass element and it
would be unfair to make it an inter
class event at this late date, because
one class would be apt to have an
advantage."
"The course has been selected af
ter careful consideration and 1 think
by making the men run two laps at
the end of the race it will afford the
crowd on the bleachers a good op
portunity to see the finish."
