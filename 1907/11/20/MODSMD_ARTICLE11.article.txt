If those students who bring their
lunches with them to the University
will refrain from leaving empty
boxes and loose papers scattered

of discredit on both the University
and its undergraduates and anyone
who is repeatedly guilty of this of
fense very evidently cares little for
the opinions of his fellow-students.
