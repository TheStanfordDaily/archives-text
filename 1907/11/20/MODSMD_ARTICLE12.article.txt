Acknowledgement should be made
of the services which the University
Band has so freely given to the Stu
dent Body this semester. This or
ganization is one which voluntarily
takes upon itself a great deal of
work and generally receives but lit
tle credit from anyone for it. The
unusually high standard which has
been maintained this fall lias re
flected a great deal of credit upon
Stanford and is in itself a fine tri
bute to the ability of the musicians
and their leader.
