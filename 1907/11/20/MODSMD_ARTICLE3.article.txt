# APPEALS TO FRESHMEN
## "DAD" MOULTON MAKES PLEA FOR TRACK MATERIAL. More Than Fifty 1911 Men Attend Track Rally and Hear Strong Speeches 
### 
There were more than fifty Fresh
men at the Training House last night
to listen to "Dad" Moulton's appeal
for a large 1911 track squad this year,
and from the reception accorded the
veteran trainer, it appears that there
is plenty of interest in track work
among tlie entering class. The meet
ing was opened by R. B. Wheeler, the 1
class president, who stated that it was j
up to the Freshman Class this year tc>
break the string of victories that
California has scored in the past two ,
years and that he hoped to see every
one come out on the track.
lie then introduced "Dad" Moulton.
who spoke as follows: "The object of !
this meeting is to urge upon you fel
lows the necessity of coming out for
track work. No man knows what lie I
can do until he comes out and tries, j
I never have seen 011c yet who knew
what he could do, and I know you
are just the same as the rest, so j
come out and try. It was only this
afternoon that I noticed a man run
ning 011 the track who showed fine ,
form, and I picked him out to be one j
of the Freshman stars. But when I j
inquired I found he was a Senior and
that this was only the third time that
he had been on the track. Just think
of the chances that man has missed.
He may make good this year, but it
is his last year, and think of three
years that he has absolutely wasted.
So don't wait two or three years, but
come out right now.
"I want to especially urge the men
to come out who have not had pre- !
vious experience because there is a
chance for everybody. W hen the foot
ball season opened you all came out
and tried, even though you didn't i
know the game of Rugby before com
ing here, and you made a good, hard
light and the class and college were
proud of you. Now come out tin
same way for track and work hard
and every man will have even a bet-
ter chance than he did in football, as
there only fifteen men could play
against California, while in track we
i-:; 11 enter a hundred and eight men.
1 know that if the men come out I I
can produce a winning team and we |
will be able to break this string of
California Freshman victories. And I
you men are not only coming out for !
the Freshman team but also the Var
sity. There are plenty of places to be
tilled o! the varsity team and I need i
the men. You don't have to try any
one event, but 1 will watch you, and
if you are not making good in one
we will try you in another until we j
find just the right place for you.
"Come out now and get started, be- j
cause you need the development and |
we want to get a line on the new men |
before next spring. 1 will be at the
track every day, and do not stay away
if it is raining. Our track is in just as
