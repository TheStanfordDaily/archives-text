# THE 						KILTIES ARE COMING.
## Organization of Artists Will Give Grand Concert in Assembly Hall in December. 
### 
On the evening of Wednesday, De
cember 4, the Kilties Band will give
a grand concert in Assembly Hall.
This organization is composed of a
large number of solo and concert ar
tists, and their selections are such as
should appeal particularly to a col
lege audience. The Kilties appeared
here several years ago, when an ex
ceptionally varied and interesting
program was rendered.
The Faculty Committee on Enter
tainments announces that tickets
will go on sale on Monday, December
2, at the Bookstore and the Stan
ford Pharmacy. The prices will be
seventy-five and fifty cents.
