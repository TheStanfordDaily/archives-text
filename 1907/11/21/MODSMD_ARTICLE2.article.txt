# TWO ADDRESSES TODAY
## HALE AND SNOW SPEAK AT FIFTH ASSEMBLY. Students Hear Talks On Business Opportunity and the Fallacy of Bluff In Commercial Life. 
### 
The Assembly this morning was
presided over by Professor Stillrnan
in the absence of President Jordan
and was addressed by two speakers,
Doctor S. B. Snow, of Palo Alto,
and R. B. Hale of San Francisco.
Dr. Snow spoke upon the fallacy
ot "bluff" and urged a more frank
and straightforward attitude toward
life. He said, in part, "Each col
lege has its own peculiar slang, but
there is one slang phrase that is
heard and understood the country
over; I refer to the word 'bluff.'
This word is a good commentary on
the character of its users. We Am
ericans are great bluffers, and enjoy
bluffing people. We find bluffers
in college as well as in the general
public.
"In business, In politics, in the
University, in society, we see ex
amples of apparent success in this
great. American game of bluff and we
should go forth resolved to call it
wherever we meet it.
"We must first make ourselves
frank and straightforward and we
will be taking the first step in form
ing a higher standard of righteous
ness in this nation which is suffer
ing from too low a standard."
Hale spoke on business opportun
ities and emphasized the fact that
although chances open to young men
of today are of a different charac
ter than of a generation ago, they
are none the less numerous. His
talk was marked by clever anecdotes
and telling Illustrations. He said, in
part:
"The statement that business op
portunities are growing less is, per
haps, true if we consider only (he
particular opportunities of the past,
but there are now many new things
to Ire done. Commonplace things
are multudinous and there are many
avenues of business constantly open
ing up.
"The world has no sympathy for
the quitter or the man who makes
excuses for his own inefficiency. The
world wants men who accomplish
things. Employers want men who
learn by doing things understanding
ly, as they know that such men will
some day be of assistance in solv
ing the great business problems.
"Business offers a great field to
college men but expects them to be
trained to think and act intelligent
ly and to do their part in raising
the standard of civic decency. Those
who enter the public service should
serve for the sense of work well done,
not for personal glory, salary, or
the approbation of the people. Men
should be willing to sacrifice person
al comfort, for the public good. The
individual must be willing to lose
his identity in the public welfare. The
worthiest men should be judged by
what they do."
The Orchestra rendered several se
lections during the Assembly.
