The regular fall track meet

afternoon at 4 o'clock and the cross
country run will start from the
track at 4:30. All the men who

performances. In the hurdles H. L.
Horton, '08, B. L. Gregg, '09, S. M.
Bellah, MO, and P. F. Bradley, '10,
will be among the entries and
should furnish good contests. On
account of the cross-country run the
two-mile event will not be on the
program and there will probably be
no mile race. Otherwise there will
be a complete card and there are
several Freshmen entered" whom
"Dad" Moulton expects to do well.
This meet is primarily for the new
men and both Moulton and Captain
Lanagan are anxious to see a large
number of them in competition.
In the field events there are good
entries and in the hammer-throw
M. P. Youker, '10, has been show
ing constant improvement and may
be expected to make a good show
ing tomorrow. Horton will put the
shot and should win this event easily
if he comes anywhere near his form
shown in the past P. A. A. meet.
Captain Lanagan will not take part
in the meet but will act as clerk
of the course.
The cross-country run will start
from the track at 4:30 and the fin
ish will consist of several laps
around the oval when the men re
turn from the four mile course. In
this event there are some excellent
runners entered and the competition
for the Quadrangle trophies promises
to be keen. H. H. Maundrell, '10,
the well-known miler, is one of the
most experienced men entered and
should prove a strong'contender for
first place. ,T. E. Shelton, '10, C.
B. Bradford, '09, and .T. P. Hemp
hill, '09, are three of the entries
