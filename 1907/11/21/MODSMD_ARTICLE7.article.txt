Coach Holmes' proposal that an
athletic contract be drawn up be
tween the student bodies of Stan
ford and the University of Southern
California appears to hold out ad
vantages to both institutions which
it would be unwise to disregard.
We should welcome here any com
pact which will broaden our athletic
relations and insure our teams
matches with representative athletes
from the various portions of the
Coast.
This, appears the natural result
of the proposed agreement and as
the financial end of the undertaking
will not entail any large expendl-;
ture on our part it hardly seems j
that any objection may be raised to
the plan. Our relations with South
ern athletes have always been of the
most pleasant kind and their plac- !
ing on a definite basis for the next
three years should be very welcome, j
We recommend Mr. Holmes pro
posal to the serious consideration of
the Executive Committee.
