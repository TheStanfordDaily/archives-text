# BANKERS MORE CONFIDENT.
## Government Bonds Offer Relief In Money Stringency.â€”Cash Is More Plentiful. 
### 
A marked easing up in the local
financial situation has been notice
able this week, clue to the attitude
the merchants have taken regarding
the Clearing House certificates. At
present, with the $100,000,000 of
government bonds on the market and
the subsiding of public sentiment,
which became so aroused when the
California Safe Deposit Rank closed
its doors last week, the strain of the
situation is about over and cash will
probably be again in circulation by
the end of next week.
