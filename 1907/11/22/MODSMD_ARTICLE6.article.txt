### 
Tennis play in the interclass dou
bles tournament was commenced yes
terday afternoon on the Encina
Courts when T. C. Henry, '10, and
L. B. Mackey, '10, the Sophomore
champions, met. defeat, at. the hands
of D. Caddagan, '11, and E. Kobbe,
'11, by a score of 8-0, 4-6, 6-4.
Kobbe and Caddagan were playing
in -very good form, while Henry and
Mackey seined to have no control ov
er their strokes at all. Throughout
all three of the sets, neither of the
Sophomores played their usual game
of tennis and this ragged work was
the chief feature of the match.
Immediately before the playing of
this match, It. A. Gott, '09, and A.
J. Gowan, '09, won the title of Jun
ior doubles champions by defeating
A. C. Stelle, "09, and C. C. Owen, '09,
by a score of 7-5, 7-5. This team
will play the winner of the Senior
tryout during the early part of next
week.
Plans are now well under way for
the handicap tournament to be held
on the Encina Courts on Thanksgiv
ing Day. This tournament will be
open to all undergraduate or grade
students, and to members of the
Faculty or Alumni. The prize that
will go to the winner of the tourna
ment will lie the loving cup, donat
ed by F. C. Thiele three years ago,
and the winner will be entitled to
bold it for one year. The cup will
come into the permanent, possession
of anyone who wins it three years
in succession. All entries must be
handed to T. C. Henry, '10, or L. B.
Mackey, '10, before Tuesday evening
and the drawings will be published
