# FEW COMPETE ON TRACK
## LITTLE INTEREST IN THE TRYOUT SATURDAY. Performances Are Only Ordinary Over Shortened Distances.â€”Field Events Better. 
### 
The track meet Saturday did not
come up to expectations and failed
to develop any unusual performances.
There were very few entries and all
the distances were considerably shor
tened so that the time does not fur
nish grounds for comparisons. In the
field the work was much better and
there were some fairly creditable
performances, though the lack of en
tries diminished the interest. H. L.
Horton, '08, won the shot-put with
a throw of 4 4 feet 1 inch, and M. P.
Youker, '10, took first in the ham
mer throw. S. N. Bellah, '10, took
first place in the broad jump at 20
feet 10 inches, and Mettuck, '11,
won second with a jump of 20 feet
3 inches. The high jump went to
D. (J. Martin, '10, at 5 feet 8 inches,
and C. A. Waring, '11, took second
place at 5 feet 7 inches.
Horton won the high hurdles, and
P. F. Bradley, '10, took second. The
mile run, shortened to three laps,
was won by G. B. Bush, '09, in 3
minutes 59 seconds. The 880-yard
run, shortened to tiGO yards, went to
J. E. Thompson, '11. The 440-yard
dash, shortened to 352 yards, was
won by R. B. Wheeler, '11, in 43
seconds. Owing, to the lack of suffi
cient. entries, the 100-yard dash, 220-
yard dash, low hurdles and pole
vault were omitted.
