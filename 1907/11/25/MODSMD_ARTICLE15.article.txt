# CALIFORNIA DISSATISFIED.
## Students in Mass Meeting Express Sentiment that American Football Should Replace Rugby. 
### 
The last assembly of the Califor
nia men students was devoted to a
discussion of the relative merits of
Rugby and American football. The
first speaker, a senior, expressed the
opinion that Rugby had failed to
meet expectations. An old English
Rugby player spoke in support of
the new game, and then W. T. Reid,
Jr., of Belmont, was introduced.
Reid dwelt at some length on the
improvements which have been made
in the old style game, and urged the
universities to try it for a year be
fore finally discarding it.
Captain-elect Bell stated that at
the recent football banquet the men
voted on the subject, three favoring
Rugby, and twenty-seven wishing a
return to the old game.
C. S. Cerf, '09, was the last speak
er. He admitted that from the
standpoint of pure sport Rugby was
the better game, but said that Am
erican football was better for a con
test, and that the public appreciated
the fact.
