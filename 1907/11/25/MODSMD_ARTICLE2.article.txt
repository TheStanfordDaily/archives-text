# DR. GUTHRIE PREACHES.
## Alameda Minister Delivers Strong Sermon in Chapel on Sunday Morning. 
### 
"The Price of Ideals" was the top
ic of Reverend W. N. Guthrie's ser
mon in the Chapel on Sunday morn
ing. Dr. Guthrie is a very eloquent
speaker and clearly impressed his ar
guments upon the congregation. "Ev
ery tiling costs," said Dr. Guthrie,
"and we all pay the price for what
we do. However, we should not do
things with the end in view or with
the idea of getting a reward, hut
with the contemplation of an immed
iate sacrifice. There is no reward on
earth such as happiness, but our aim
should be to accomplish something
and by so doing make a sacrifice."
Mrs. Blanchard, contralto soloist,
rendered two selections, "But the
Lord is mindful of His own," and
"Eye hath not seen." The choir
sang, "Oh, Lord, how manifold are
Thy works."
