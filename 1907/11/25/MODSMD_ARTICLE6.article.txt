# HOGARTH GIVES LECTURE
## TALKS ON "IONIA AND EPHESUS" IN CHAPEL FRIDAY. Topic Deals With Explorations In Western Asia Minor and Southern Europe. 
### 
Professor D. G. Hogarth lectured
Friday evening in the Chapel on
"lonia and Ephesus." Hogarth is the
most eminent living authority on
pre-historic investigations in West
ern Asia Minor and Southern Eu
rope, and one of the most foremost
in clearing up problems of early civil
ization. Previous to his lecture pro
per, Hogarth stated that one of his
aims in lecturing and pointing out
the importance of these investiga
tions was to aid in turning the finan
cial support of the millionaires of
the country in the direction of this
work, which is being carried on by
the American Institute of Archaeol
ogy. He then proceeded with his
lecture and said, in part:
"There is no part of the classical
world already explored on so mag
nificent a scale as Western Asia Min
or, but. nevertheless its earliest his
tory remains quite nnknown. This
lack of knowledge results from the
choice made of sites for exploration
and the method in which the exca
vations have been carried out. Al
though the Miletus and Diana tem
ples at Ephesus have been dug to
the bottom, they have not thrown the
desired light upon the question. None
the less it is certain that there was
a high state of civilization in Asia
Minor long before this."
The lecturer then went on to say
that when searching thus for ancient
civilization investigators are brought
up against the yet unknown art of
Lydia. He exemplified the remark
able ignorance of its products, and
indicated that in a further knowl
edge of Lydia would be found the
key to many Western Asi;in and Hel
lenic problems. To this end, excava
tion of Lydian sites on a large scale
was urgently needed, and needed the
help of American enterprise. He be
lieved it the biggest thing left to do
in the classic world, and would of
fer a task eminently worthy of a
great nation.
