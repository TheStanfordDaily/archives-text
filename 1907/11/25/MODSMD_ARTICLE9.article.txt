ment. which has now become national
in its scope. In 1903 three mem
bers of the Socialist Club of Wiscon
sin, one German, one Japanese, and
one Armenian, organized a society

leading undergraduate representa

club was to foster a spirit of good
fellowship among the men of the
different nations.

tations sent out to other colleges to
establish local chapters.
