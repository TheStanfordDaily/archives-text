# MAY PLAY IN PORTLAND
## STOTT DESIRES GAME WITH CARDINAL VARSITY. Ex-Football Captain Will Raise Team To Face Stanford.â€”Further Plans For Trip. 
### 
Plans for the northern tour of the
varsity fifteen are maturing, and it
is now definitely settled that the
squad will leave the University on
December 20, going direct to Van
couver. During the past few days
Manager Knupp has been in commu
nication with E. P. Stott, ex-'O7, re
garding a game which may be played
in Portland on the return of the
Stanford men. Stott, who captained
the 1906 Varsity, is endeavoring to
get together a fifteen for the pur
pose of giving an exhibition match
with the Cardinal. It is probable
that several old Stanford men will
be seen on Stott's team, and if found
necessary, some of the varsity substi
tutes will be used. Great interest
is at present being manifested in
Rugby by the Portland football en
thusiasts, and it is certain that the
proposed contest would draw an im
mense crowd. The probable date for
the game is January 4, three days
after the third and final battle with
Vancouver.
Every effort will be made to make
the contest with Stott's team possi
ble. The coaches feel, however, that
the Varsity should not play more
than four games during their short
absence, so Manager Knupp will en
deavor to cancel the game with Vic
toria, which is now tentatively sche
duled for the first week in January.
The number of players to go on
the trip is as yet undecided, but it
i.s almost a certainty that five substi
tutes will be taken. All of the fif
teen varsity men have signified their
willingness to make the trip, and
consequently Stanford will be repre
sented by her strongest team.
Light practice will begin next Mon
day afternoon and will continue ev
ery evening until the departure of
the fifteen on the fifteenth or twen
tieth of the month.
