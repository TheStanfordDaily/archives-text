The Kilties Band will give a grand
concert in the Assembly Hall on the
evening of Wednesday, December 4.
It is one of the most unique among
American military bands and is com
posed entirely of Scotch Canadians.
The repertoire is very large and be
sides playing the most popular mod
ern music the Kilties will render
some old Scotch compositions includ
ing many of the stirring Highland
war songs,- which have met with
great success.
Apart from the band itself, there
is a choir of sixteen voices, which
will sing some of the old ballads, a
troupe of pipers, and several clever
dancers. Most notable among the
latter is A. McMillan Fraser, who has
gained a world-wide reputation for
his Scotch dancing, having won the
Canadian cup several times for his
graceful and accomplished interpre
tation of the celebrated Scotch Sword
Dance, the Sailors Hornpipe and the
Highland Fling, all of which he will
dance here.
On the arrival of the band in Palo
Alto on Wednesday afternoon, there
will be a big street parade. Fur

will be given later.
The Committee on Entertainment
announces that tickets will go on
sale Monday, December 2, at the
Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto and
