# MURPHY EXPECTED SOON
## CARDINAL COACH NOW IN SAN FRANCISCO. Will Make Preparations for Fall Training Immediately Upon His Arrival. 
### 
Dan Murphy, the Cardinal boating
coach, has arrived in San Francisco,
and will probably putin an appear-

ance on the Campus inside of a very
few days. A telegram to this effect
was received by F. W. Turner, '08.
president of the Boat. Club, last ev
ening, in which Murphy stated that
lie was then slightly indisposed, but
would come to the Campus as soon
as he was able to take up the work
of the fall training of the crew squad.
Murphy also desires to make ar
rangements for the purchase of
equipment that will facilitate the
work of the crew when the men are
finally putin the shells.
Murphy's plans are to get the men
singled out. as much as possible be
fore the first of the year, so that
when the squad works on the water
next semester, only the more promis
ing material will be left in the try
out. This will be the only way in
which he can devote the attention
to his men that will be necessary to
offset the great preparations that,
are being made by the University of
California to turn out, a winning
crew.
In view of the fact that the Fresh
man Intercollegiate race will be row
ed in eight-oared shells this season,


"Dan" Murphy.
Murphy is very anxious to have an
other eight to work with. In case
this is not received the crew will be
put under a great handicap, since
California has an extra eight for the
use of the first-year crew.
