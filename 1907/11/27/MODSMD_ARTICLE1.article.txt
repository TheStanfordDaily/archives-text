# PREPARING FOR COMEDY
## CAST WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED THIS SEMESTER. Rehearsals Will Be Devoted To Work on First Act.â€”Will Purchase Scenery. 
### 
The work of preparation for stag
ing the Sophomore comedy next se
mester is progressing satisfactorily to
the coach, but the cast will not be
announced until after college opens
in January. At present there are
two or three persons trying for each
part and these will be retained un
til after the holiday vacation in or
der that the coach may have all the
available material from which to
make the final selection.
This arrangement will not only give
those trying out an opportunity to
work on their parts during the
Christmas recess, but will also elim
inate a change in the final cast
through scholarship difficulties.
At present, the time is being spent
on the first act and all the rehear
sals during the remainder of the
semester will be on this part of the
play, as it is the desire of the coach
and committee to practically com
plete the work on Ibis act before the
holidays. In the remaining rehear
sals the time will be largely given
up to floor action, as the lines for
this act are already learned.
It will be necessary to purchase
special scenery for two acts of the
play and Chairman Avery will go to
San Francisco Friday to arrange for
securing the necessary property.
Scenery belonging to Sword and San
dals will be utilized for the other
two acts.
