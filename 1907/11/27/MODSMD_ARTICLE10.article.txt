The Daily Palo Alto is in receipt
of a rather caustic communication
asking why the debris from the bon
fire burned the night of the rally
has not yet been removed. The an
swer appears to be that no one has
given the matter much thought or
decided upon whom the responsi
bility for the removal rests. We
agree with the writer, however,
that the charred remains of the fire
do not add to the beauty of the
baseball diamond and that the rub
bish should be carried away. We
suggest to the Freshmen that hav
ing succeeded unusually well in the
building of the bonfire they would
earn additional credit by taking
away what now remains of it.
