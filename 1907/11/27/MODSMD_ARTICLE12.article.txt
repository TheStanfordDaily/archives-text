Scholarship Delinquencies.â€”Stu
dents whose University work has
been interfered with during thy
current semester by illness or other
unavoidable causes, should report
j the facts at once to the Scholarship
Committee. Oflice hours from 2:30

C. H. Gilbert, Chairman.
In explanation of the above notice
Professor Gilbert, chairman of the
Faculty Committee on Delinquent
Scholarship, stated today that the
idea was to give students who have
been unable to keep up their work
on account of some outside inter
ference an opportunity to explain
their difficulty before the examina
tions and before they leave for the
Christmas vacation.
This step is rendered necessary
by the fact that the next meeting
of the Scholarship Committee comes
during the holiday recess, when the
students are absent from the Cam
pus and their standing has to be
judged on the reports of the In
structors, without reference to ex
planatory situations.
