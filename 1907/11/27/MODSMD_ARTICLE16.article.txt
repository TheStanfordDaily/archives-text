# FAVOR NATIONAL SCHOOL
## NOTED EDUCATORS ADVOCATE FEDERAL COLLEGE. Association of State Universities Recommends Establishment of Center of Learning. 
### 
The National Association of State
Universities, in session in Washing
ton, D. C., has adopted the recom
mendation, made by a joint commit
tee of the Association and the Nation
al Educational Association, that a na
tional university be established by
act of Congress. It is expected that
such an institution if built will be
supported by the government and
situated in the District of Columbia.
According to present plans it would
be a post-graduate school of the col
leges, maintained by the state. This
recommendation will be embodied in
a bill, which will be introduced in
the next congress. The idea of a
national university has been agitat
ed by prominent educators but thus
far has made little headway owing
to the vigorous opposition of the
presidents of the private colleges.
President Jordan, President Angell
of Michigan and Andrew D. White
are among the most enthusiastic sup
porters of the scheme. Dr. Jordan
urges the need of the national uni
versity in the following words: "A
great university in America would
be a school for the study of civic
freedom. A national university at
the capital of the republic would at
tract the free-minded of all the earth.
It would draw all men of all lands
to the study of democracy. It is
the need of the nation and not of
the nation alone, but of the world.
It is the duty of the people of the
United States to meet this neecx.
There is no instrument of political,
social or administrative reform to
be compared with the influence of a
national university." Dr. White be
lieves that a national university
would tend to unite all parts of the
United Suites and that it, would in
every way strengthen the existing
university system. Added to these
arguments is the advantage of hav
ing an institution to co-ordinate the
scientific work now being done by
the several governmental depart
ments at Washington, and to put that
work at the disposal of advanced stu
dents.
