# DISPENSES WITH PRIZES
## QUAD WANTS NO PRIZE STORY OR PRIZE POEM. Money Will Be Offered For Cartoons. Athletic Successes To Cover Additional Pages. 
### 
The Board of Editors in charge of
the 1909 Quad has decided to dis
pense with the usual prize story. In
former years it has been the custom
to offer a prize for the best prose
composition in story form, but this
practice will not be followed this
year. The Quad board feels that all
the space possible is needed for the
records of the present college year.
Consequently, economy of matter will
be practiced wherever it is feasible,
and with the idea of having half a
dozen pages more than usual avail
able for matters of direct concern
to the University public, the editors
of the Junior annual will not call
for prose narratives.
With the same end in view, the
prize poem which has been one of
the features in past Quads, will be
omitted from the book to be pub
lished next May. In accordance with
a custom which has been establish
ed in past Quads, however, a prize
will probably be offered for the best
cartoon which can be turned out for
the josh department. No amount of
money has been fixed for such a bo
nus, but it will in all likelihood be
larger than the prizes offered in for
mer years.
In this year's book the department
of athletics will be larger than ever
before. As the seasons to be record
ed have never been surpassed in
Cardinal successes, a greater num
ber of pages can reasonably be de
voted to University sports than have
previously been covered. The ser
vices of A. C. Stelle, '09, have
been secured for taking pictures for
the Quad.
