' a scholar. "My desire being that
j students who shall be elected to the
i scholarships shall not be merely
I bookworms, T direct that in the elec
tion of a student to a scholarship re
gard shall be had to (1) his literary
and scholastic attainments, (2) his
fondness of and success in many out
door sports, such as cricket, football
and the like, (3) his qualities of
manhood, truth, courage, devotion to
duty, sympathy for the protection of
the weak, kindliness, unselfishness
and fellowship, and (4) his exhibi
tion during school days of moral
force of character and of instincts
to lead and to take an interest in
his schoolmates, for those latter at
tributes will be likely in after life
to guide him to esteem the perform
ance of public duties as his highest
aim."
