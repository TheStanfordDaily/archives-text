# CASSELL WINS TROPHY
## DEFEATS GAY IN DECIDING MATCH OF THANKSGIVING PLAY. Tennis Handicaps Well Chosen, and Conditions are Favorable for Successful Tournament. 
### 
The Thanksgiving handicap tennis
tournament for the F. C. Thiele tro
phy was won by J. F. Cassell, '07.
The committee in charge was fortu
nate in their choice of handicaps as
is shown by the fact that practically
every match was closely contested
and very few of the scores were at
all one-sided. Play became more in
teresting as the matches progressed
and the semi-final and final matches
were a fitting climax to the tourna
ment.
The semi-final match between L.
R. Gay, 'OS, and H. Mann, '09, was
a hard-fought and long drawn out
affair, but Gay demonstrated his su
periority over his opponent by a
score of 6-4, 8-6. The other semi
final match was won by J. F. Cas
sell over T. C. Henry, 6-3, 6-2, and
although the score would seem to
indicate a rather easy victory for
Cassell, the games were replete with
brilliant plays executed by both con
testants.
The final match, in which Cassell
defeated Gay, was not especially bril
liant from the onlooker's point of
view, since both men were so careful
with their strokes that brilliancy and
dash were taken out of the play.
Cassell's lob was very effective and
he used it with good results through
out the contest.
