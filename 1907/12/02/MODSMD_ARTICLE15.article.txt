# Columbia Modifies Eligibility Rules.
## 
### 
The stringent scholarship rules
which have obtained at Columbia
University for several years past, and
as a result of which the athletic
teams have been greatly weakened,
were recently modified to a consider
able extent. As a result a number
of athletic stars, who have been bar
red from competing in intercolleg
iate contests because of minor schol
arship deficiencies, will become eli
gible.
