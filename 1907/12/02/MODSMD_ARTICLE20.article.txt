# NAVY OVERCOMES ARMY
## PENNSYLVANIA RESTS CORNELL THANKSGIVING DAY. Eastern Football Season Closes. Yale Stands as Undisputed Champion Again. 
### 
The Eastern football season came
to an end Saturday, when the Navy
won from the Army by the score of
6-0. The game was rather unex
citing, and after the long run in the
first half which gave the Navy her
points, the contest became close and
hard-fought.
The feature of Thanksgiving day
was the game between Pennsylvania
and Cornell, in which the former won
12-4. The principal factor in the
result was the forward pass, which
the Quakers worked to perfection.
The game was very evenly contested,
though a large part of Cornell's
play was defensive.
The important Eastern results for
Thanksgiving day, which always
closes the season except for the one
contest between the Army and Navy,
are as follows:
Pennsylvania 12, Cornell 4.
St. Louis U. 34, Nebraska 0.
Kansas 4, Missouri 0.
Ames 13, Drake 0.
Yale clearly holds the football su
premacy this year, not having lost
a game. The other teams stand
about as follows: Princeton, Car
lisle, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Dart
mouth, Harvard.
