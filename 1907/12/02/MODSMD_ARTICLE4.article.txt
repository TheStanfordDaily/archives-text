# Carlisle May Come to the Coast.
## 
### 
An attempt to bring the Carlisle
Indian football team to San Francis
co for a game with a picked team
from Stanford and California on
New Years day, is now being made.
The Indians came out here in 1899,
defeating California, and again in
1903, when they won from an all
star team. They have made an ex
cellent record this season in the
East.
