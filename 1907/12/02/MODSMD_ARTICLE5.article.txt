tice again this afternoon after a rest

! routine of work was indulged in for
J the final preparation of the team be
| fore their departure for the North.

I the nine substitutes. Regular prac
i tice will continue every afternoon

Word has been received from Van-
I couver that Woodward, a brother of
i "Reggie Woodward, the Vancouver
manager, had his leg broken in a
game of Rugby in the North a few
days ago. He was to have played
■ against Stanford during the Christ
| mas vacation, but this injury will
keep him out of the game for some
time. The report also states that
this is the first serious injury result
ing from a Rugby game in British
■ Columbia in twenty years.
Next Saturday afternoon at 3:30,
on Stanford Field, the Varsity will
line up against the Barbarians in a
post-season game. Their team will
present a stronger line-up than at
any time previous during this sea
son. Simpson, the star five-eighths
of the Vancouver team, did not go
North with his team-mates, but has
joined the ranks of the Barbarians
in San Francisco, and his playing will
add a great deal to the efficiency of
j their backfield.
