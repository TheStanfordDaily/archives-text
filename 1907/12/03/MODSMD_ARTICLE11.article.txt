The best sentiment of the Stu
dent Body is heartily behind Profes
sor Durand in his attempt to put an
end to the vicious disturbances
which have the rule rather
than the exception during the pre
sent semester. The mere fact that
the older residents of the Campus
have found it necessary to form an
organization to protest against the
conduct of students during the late
hours of the night is quite sufficient
evidence that good grounds exist for
the reform movement. Evidently
the offenders have forgotten that the
rights of others are entitled to re
spect, and that the Campus is not
the place for noisy demonstrations
in the middle of the night. The
government here is practically in
the hands of the men themselves.
We hope to see it kept clean. There
can be no doubt but that if the pre
sent system is a failure it will be
superseded by one which will be ef
fective but will find but. small fav
or. in our eyes.
