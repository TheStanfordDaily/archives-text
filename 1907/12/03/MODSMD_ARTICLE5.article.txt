# TEAM PREPARES FOR TRIP.
## Varsity Fifteen Resumes Practice. Coaches Will Soon Announce Men To Go North. 
### 
Twenty men appeared on Stanford
Field yesterday afternoon for the
first practice in preparation for the
approaching northern trip of the
Cardinal fifteen. The nine substi
tutes were called out by Captain
Koerner, and it. is probable that they
will all be seen in suits during the
course of the next few days, with
the exception of H. E. Reed, '10,
who will be prevented from playing
because of an injured ankle. The
squad went through light practice
only, and no fifteen was lined up.
The twenty men who will make the
trij) to Vancouver will be chosen by
the end of the week.
