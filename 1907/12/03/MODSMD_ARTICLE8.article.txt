# DESIRE BETTER ORDER
## CAMPUS RESIDENTS PROTEST AGAINST DISTURBANCES Student Affairs Committee Seeks Co-operation of Students In Stopping Indecency. 
### 
Professor W. F. Durand, chairman j
of the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, is in the midst of a series
of calls 011 the sixteen fraternities,
the men's boarding houses and En-1
cina Hall. The purpose of Profes
sor Durand's visits is to effect bet
ter order on the Campus than has
prevailed during the past six weeks,
and is expressed in a letter which he
is now personally presenting to
these various groups of men stu
dents.
Indignant protest has been made
to the Student Affairs Committee by
residents here against disturbances
at unreasonable hours. At a recent
meeting of,the older members of the
community, a Civic League was
formed for the purpose of improv
ing the conditions existing on the
Campus.
At this meeting, obscene disturb
ances of the kind named received
the heartiest condemnation. So in
censed were some of the Campus res
idents present at the meeting, that
there was talk of bringing their)
grievances directly before the Board
of Trustees. The objections of some
of the residents of the Campus are
backed up by assertions to the effect
that they must remove their famil
ies from the obnoxious influences to
which they have recently been sub
jected if these influences do not J
cease.
The problem of maintaining good
order, as Professor Durand sees it,
includes the retention of the control
of student conduct in the hands of j
a Faculty committee acting with the
co-operation of the students. Part
of his letter in regard to the prac
tices which have provoked protest
follows:
"The Committee feels that the
time has come when it must insist
upon the fulfillment of the under
standing which it has had with the'
fraternities regarding these matters, 1
and this letter is intended as a for
mal notice that future infractions
where responsibility is brought
either to an individual or to an or
ganization as a whole must necessar
ily be followed by summary and ser
ious results.
"You are further informed that
'the general community has been so
deeply aroused by recent acts of ob
jectionable disorder that unless 1
'such acts are discontinued it is
more than likely that drastic action
will follow on the part of the com
mittee as such and quite independ
ent. of the Faculty or the Committee
on Student Affairs."
Professor Durand is desirous that
the present friendly relations be
tween the Student Affairs Commit
tee and the students shall prevail.
Tie hopes that 110 drastic measures j
will be needed to maintain good or
der. But, on the other hand, he Is
convinced that good order must be
maintained in order that a higher
authority than his committee will
not take charge of student affairs.
