Archie Rice, '95, in writing of the
plans for a reorganized Stanford
I Club in San Francisco, says:
"The San Francisco committee
now at work compiling the names,
professions, business and residence
addresses, and telephone numbers of
all the Stanford men residing with
in the limits of Ihe proposed greater
I city has already a list of 375 pros
pective members for the proposed
reorganized Stanford Club of San
Francisco.
"By classes they are: trustees, 7:
former members of the Faculty, 3;
) '92, 8; '93, 5; '94, 13; '95, 52: '96,
24; '97, 26; '98, 17; '99, 22; '00, IS;
'01, 26; '02, 19; '03, 20; '04, 29;
'05, 22; '06, 22; '07, 19; '08, 16;
, '((9, 10. These figures include 138
collegians who did not graduate.
"By fraternities the representa
tion is: Sigma Rho Eta (afterward
I). K. E.), 16: Sigma Nu, 15; Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, 14; Delta Kappa
Epsilon, 12; Kappa Alpha, 11: Phi
Kappa Psi, 1L; Zeta Psi, 9; Sigma
Chi, Chi Psi, Delta Tan Delta, Phi
Delta Tlieta, each 7; Beta Theta Hi
and Delta Upsilon, each 6; Alpha
Tan Omega and Phi Gamma Delta,
each 4; Kappa Sigma, 1; total, 134.
"In the crowd generally there are
4 varsity football captains and 17
other varsity football men, 4 var
sity baseball captains and 14 other
varsity base ball men, 3 varsity
track captains and 16 other varsity
track men, 3 intercollegiate tennis
players, 8 varsity debaters, 2 stu
dent body presidents, 4 treasurers of
the student body, 25 members of the
| varsity musical clubs, 6 editors-in
i chief of the"Daily Palo Alto, 1
| Sequoia editor, 5 head editors of the
"Alumnus," and 2 "Chaparral" edit
i ors.
"By professions, so far as ascer
tained, there are 64 lawyers, 26
doctors, 19 engineers, 18 teachers,
16 journalists, 11 realty agents, 9
insurance agents, 6 law and medical
| students, 5 capitalists, 4 dentists, 3
ministers, 3 agents, 3 mining men,
2 architects, and just 57 other var
ieties of business men.
"And as a final tone of intellectual
ity, (he 375 are sprinkled with the
! classic and studious examples of 9
members of Phi Beta Kappa.
"Such, iu brief, is the general ma
j terial out. of which it is hoped may
be formed the largest and most im
portant of all (lie Stanford Clubs of
the country.
"The first prospective move, pend
! ing the completion of the compre
hensive registration of alumni and
those who were left at the post, is
to be a big Stanford theatre party
some night during the presentation
soon of the college play, "Strong
heart," at. the Van Ness Theatre. It
is intended to get a great block of
seats in the gallery and be rooters
for a night.
. As soon as the directory lists,
segregated by classes, can be pub
lished in the "Alumnus" and got be
fore the individuals so each may
know the extent of the numerical
prospects, steps will lie taken toward
securing a convenient suite of unfur
nished rooms at the top of some
easily accessible downtown building.
Then will begin the pleasant task of
gradually furnishing them with in
dividual contributions of college pic
tures, sofa cushions, contributed
books, chairs, rugs, and tables, till
the place will grow to be an in
teresting den and regular Stanford
rendezvous, with a key always avail
able at the nearest hotel. The pre
sent prospective members contain all
the personal elements necessary to
make of the place a typical Stan
ford colony where a bulletin board
maybe used to secure volunteers for
various little trips, theatre parties,
luncheons, and tramps, all on a ba
sis of Dutch treat, so that none may
hesitate for financial reasons."

collegians who did not graduate.
"By fraternities the representa

"In the crowd generally there are
4 varsity football captains and 17
other varsity football men, 4 var

varsity base ball men, 3 varsity
track captains and 16 other varsity
track men, 3 intercollegiate tennis

to be a big Stanford theatre party
some night during the presentation

heart," at. the Van Ness Theatre. It
is intended to get a great block of
seats in the gallery and be rooters
for a night.

segregated by classes, can be pub

fore the individuals so each may
know the extent of the numerical
prospects, steps will lie taken toward
securing a convenient suite of unfur
nished rooms at the top of some
easily accessible downtown building.

gradually furnishing them with in
dividual contributions of college pic
tures, sofa cushions, contributed
books, chairs, rugs, and tables, till
the place will grow to be an in
teresting den and regular Stanford
rendezvous, with a key always avail
able at the nearest hotel. The pre
sent prospective members contain all
the personal elements necessary to
make of the place a typical Stan
ford colony where a bulletin board
maybe used to secure volunteers for
