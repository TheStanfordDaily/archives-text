## Eminent Scholar Who Has Entered Politics Gives Interesting Address and Is Well Received by Students. 
### 
Dr. Edward Robeson Taylor, may
j or of San Francisco, was given an
| enthusiastic reception at the last As-
I sembly of the semester held this
j morning at the fourth hour in As
sembly Hall. Using the words of
the speaker, his "was a homely talk
j to fellow students" and the person
ality which has proved so magnetic
in San Francisco where the vener-
I able scholar has just finished a
whirlwind campaign for good gov
ernment, caught hold of the local
community from the start and
brought cheers and applause with
j out. stint.
Mayor Taylor is well known here
I by reputation, and the number of
' undergraduates who gathered this
morning bespoke great interest in
the speaker. Dr. Taylor was the
j guest of the Social Service Club, un
! der whose auspices the Assembly
1 was held. Dr. J. M. Stlllman, as
acting executive of the University,
introduced the speaker as "a fair
sample of the scholar in politics."
| Dr. Taylor was expected to speak
along this line, but devoted his time
to an interesting talk to the under
graduates upon college subjects, pri
marily what a university education
j should accomplish and what a uni
, versity is. Dr. Taylor said in part:
"The university is the means to

an end. If you consider knowledge
gained here as the end, then it is
all wrong. The vanity of knowl
edge is just as bad as other kinds
ol vanity. If your knowledge dojs
not make you a better man or a
better woman, it is all rubbish. You
do not come here to pick up scraps
of knowledge. You come because
the university creates the environ
ment which should draw out the
best which is in you. You must
build upon a moral foundation.
That man is not so much flesh and
bone, muscle and tissue but a spirit,
is a fundamental principle and you
who have not grasped this have
failed to grasp the fundamental
idea.
"Everything must be cared for. I
know of nothing in this world which
will take care of itself. In San Fran
cisco that is much the way we have
been doing. At least, so it has been
in the past, but. we hope we may do
better in the future. For instance,
the streets should be inspected. It'
not daily, then weekly or even
monthly. We have been making a
street and when it is done, have loft
it. When a hole comes, the hole
has been left until it has become
an ulcer and spread over a large
extent. Then we must either make

a new pavement or fill in the hole.
In the same way you must take care
of yourself. If you don't, why you
will go to the devil.
"Now is the age of the common
people. We find the common peo
ple coming forward as never before.
You must reckon with these men.
You must measure men by their
dealings and not by their educa
tion. I care not whether a man
has a university education or even
if be knows his alphabet. If a
man is true to himself, true to his
city and his state, kind and consid
erate to his family, the# he is a
real man. xYnd that is the way to
measure a man.
"We will always have labor trou
bles until the employer shall look
upon the man as a spirit and not
so much muscle and skill only capa
ble of doing so much work. If he
could impress upon his employees
that the quality of work counted
and instill in him a love for his
work, then you can come to the
right relation between employer and
employee and the big cavity will be
bridged."

employee and the big cavity will be
bridged."
