There has long been need for a
Stanford Club in San Francisco. How
the Alumni are going about the or
ganization of one which will com
bine the features of other clubs and
yet have something distinctive of
its own is very interestingly told
by Mr. Rice in another column of
this issue of the"Daily Palo Alto."
It appears strange that with the
large number of Stanford men who
are in the city definite steps in this
direction were not taken long ago.
An organization of former Stanford
men in San Francisco will not only
serve the purposes of those in the
other cities of the United States but
should also provide a rendezvous for
undergraduates, thus making possi
ble closer relations and a better un
derstanding between the graduate
and undergraduate bodies. The dem
ocratic lines upon which the club will
be conducted is a carrying further
of one ol' the best features of life on
the Campus and is well in accord
with Stanford ideals.
