# SCOTCH BAND PLEASES
## "KILTIES" RENDER SPLENDID CONCERT PROGRAM. Audits Fraser and Highlanders Score Hit With Bagpipes and National Dances. 
### 
The Kilties made good their repu
tation of being a great concert band
by their performance last night in
Assembly Hall. Led by Bandmaster
Cook the numbers of the big corps
ol' musicians were excellent and the
specialties by the members of the
troup proved popular. Angus Eraser
in the dances won much applause
and his pipers came in for several
recalls.
Beginning with Sousa's popular
march, "Free Lance," which was
rendered with plenty of snap and
go, the band clearly demonstrated
their ability. It remained, however,
for the soul-stirring strains of Wag
ner's great overture, "Tannhauser,"
to bring out the real texture of the
musicians. Bandmaster Cook de
veloped all his band and led up to
the climax with chorus of heavy
brass with great effectiveness. The
wood wind also in turn proved their
caliber, being in fact uniformly good
while the heavy brasses were not
effective at the outset, but amply
held their own in the closing bars.
The first two numbers played by the
entire organization and the encore
which followed gave evidence of a
perfectly balanced band.
Among the instrumental solos,
Murray F. Cady rendered several se
lections on the euphonium which
were well received. The "Concert
Polka," by Bryant, was the program
number, but he rendered two en
cores which were equally popular.
The bagpipers, listed as Eraser's
Highlanders, proved a hit and were
repeatedly called. Eraser himself, in
the sword dance and Sailor's Horn
pipe, was very clever. The Scotch
Reel was an excellent exhibition of
the dances peculiar to Scotland.
"Gems from Scottish Song," ren
dered by the band, drew applause
and showed the hold the familiar
melodies have upon the public. These
songs of the Highlands were played
with delicacy where required and
plenty of strength in the choruses.
"Grand Selections from Gioconda,"
by Ponchielli, "Scenes from the Red
Mill," and the closing march, "The
Second Connecticut National Guard,"
were several other selections render
ed by the band. These numbers did
not, however, equal the overture of
"Tannhauser."
The Kilties Choir sang the ballads
of Scotland and were up to the
standard of the other performers.
An effective rendering of "God Save
the King," by the band, terminated
the concert.
