# STOLEN MONEY RETURNED
## THIEF SECRETLY BRINGS BACK ARTICLES TAKEN FROM INN. Leaves Note Saying Theft Was Result of Wager.â€”Affair Will Be Dropped. 
### 
In the same mysterious manner in
which it was taken, the money sfcol
j en from the Stanford Inn Monday
, night was returned some time (luring
| the day yesterday. The money was
found in the desk downstairs, tied
up in an old sock; the stolen wal
lets were in the same place.
The amount returned was practic
ally the same as that taken. A few
papers and a stamp-book were miss
j ing and the cash was in different
[ denominations from that stolen.
A note was left, purporting to have
! been written in the night, saying that
! the theft was committed as the re
| suit of a wager and that the en
try to the building was gained
through a basement window. In
view of the facts which have come
to light, this explanation is con
sidered to be merely a subterfuge to
j prevent any further steps being tak
!en in the matter. It is apparent that
| the thief became frightened, and,
| thinking to clear himself, took the
above action. Although there is
' strong evidence to show that the
: thief might be discovered if the af
\ fair was thoroughly investigated,
it is probable that no further ac
tion will be taken in the matter.
