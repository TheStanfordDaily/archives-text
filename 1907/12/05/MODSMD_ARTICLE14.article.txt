A number of complaints in regard
to the lack of desk room in the Uni
versity Library have been made by
students who find themselves handi
capped in their work. Practically
whole rows of desks are rendered
useless in the evenings by their lacit
of lights. With the week of final ex
aminations but nine days away it
can readily be understood that this
apparently trivial inconvenience may
work no little hardship. The fail
ure to replace Uie burnt-out lights
and thus increase the seating capaci
ty must arise either from negligence
011 the part of the library attend
ants or a very poor idea of economy
on the part of the authorities. It
is little more than absurd to say that
the latter reason is the correct one
and we trust that the matter will be
invesigated and corrected before such
an assertion has time to gain ground.
