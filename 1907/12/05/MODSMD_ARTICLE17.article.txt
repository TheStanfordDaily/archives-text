# California Student Body Meets.
## 
### 
At the semi-annual meeting of the
California Student Body yesterday a
motion to exclude all women from
membership in the Associated Stu
dents was passed. No women were
present at the meeting, so there was
little opposition. The president an
nounced that the matter would not
be put to a vote until the commence
ment of next semester.
Manager Snedigar reported that
the indebtedness of the student body
was $15,304.87, about $4000 above
the figures of last year.
