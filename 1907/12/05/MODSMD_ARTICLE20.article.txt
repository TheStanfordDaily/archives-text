# HARVARD DISCUSSES METHODS
## "Crimson" Publishes Criticism of Existing Athletic System and Advocates Permanency. 
### 
Since the recent defeat of the Har
vard football team in the annual
game with Yale, the undergraduates
at Harvard have been discussing ways
and means of bringing future success
to the Crimson. The "Harvard Crim
son" is daily publishing criticisms of
the existing system.
In discussing the issue editorially,
that paper recently said in part,
"Football is not an interest which
influences players alone, but one
which fires the whole University.
The weight of opinion is that we
are out to win, and that we should
make the most of all fair methods
to attain that end.
"Permanency is the essential of
football; all other considerations are
mere details. But, in order to se
cure permanency there must be some
change in methods. In order to put
before the men who have the final
decision in such matters the consen
sus of opinion, we solicit communica
tions from all who have well consid
ered opinions on the subject, espec
ially from the graduates and under
graduates who have played football
and who have the most intimate
knowledge of actual conditions."
The "permanency" which is advo
cated by the "Crimson" is the theme
of all the communications published
up to date, though the methods of
securing it are greatly varied. One
method proposed is to have a per
permanent board of five football men
and the captain select the coach and
lay down the policy of the univer
sity, thus preventing the yearly I
change which is occasioned by the 1
present system of allowing the cap
train to choose the coach.
