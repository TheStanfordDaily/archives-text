# FLUME NEARING COMPLETION.
## With No Delays Work Will Be Finished By January 1.-Last Cement Work Begun Yesterday. 
### 
â€¢The work on the Lagunita Flume
is progressing with a fair degree of
rapidity. The dam on San Francis
quito Creek is complete and the con
crete work on the culvert at the
Stock Farm was begun yesterday.
Outside of this the only remaining
construction to be done is the finish
ing of the flume proper, which will
only require a short time.
According to Professor Marx, the
work should be completed by the end
of the year, provided the weather
conditions are favorable. This will
insure the lake being filled by the
rains of January and February, and
ready for the boatmen at an early
date.
