# Report of Swimming Contest False.
## 
### 
The report that appeared in the
Sun Francisco papers announcing
that K. L. Fenton, '08, and J. R.
Pemberton, '08, would take part in
the coming swimming races at the
Olympic Club is absolutely false.
The article stated that these men
would compete against two swim
mers from the University of Califor
nia, but when questioned in regard
to the matter today it was found
that no one had notified them of
the affair.
