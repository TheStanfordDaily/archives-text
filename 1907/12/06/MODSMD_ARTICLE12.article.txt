The Executive Committee took a
long step in the right direction when
they made provision for an expert
accountant to audit the books of the
men who handle the Student Body
money. The lax financial methods
which have been so characteristic of
the Associated Students in the past
not only reflects discredit upon the
undergraduate body but places the
men in charge of the finances in po
sition to be unnecessarily extrava
gant. The auditing committees of
students which are regularly appoint
ed generally go through a farcial per
formance in their examination of
books and accomplish practically no
thing of value. Stanford is fortu
nate in having managers of unques
tionable honesty, but it is very possi
ble to conceive of a time when this
would not be the case. The new sys
tem will not only make impossible
any loss of Student Body funds, but
will also do much to make the posi
tions involving care of money more
tenable.
