# ADOPTS REVISED SPELLING.
## University of Columbia Orders Manuscript To Be Written In New Orthography. 
### 
The University of Columbia has
adopted reformed spelling in all
manuscripts written in the univer
sity. This order embodies almost
two hundred words of the revised
orthography, recommended by Pres-1
ident. Roosevelt, and consists of the
words whose spelling has been al-:
tered in the latest edition of the
Century Dictionary.
Professor Brander Mathews, of
the English department of Colum
bia, is the leading instrument affect
ing this change, as lie is chairman !
of the simplified spelling board, re
cently appointed by the President.
Although the order to adopt the new
spelling applies more especially to
the business departments of the uni
versity, it is expected that the stu
dents will follow the example, as
Professor Mathews has great, influ
ence among the undergraduates.
