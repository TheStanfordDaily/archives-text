# Harvard Alumni Demand Success.
## 
### 
The last issue of the Harvard Bul
letin, the organ of the alumni, takes
a very serious view of the football
coaching situation there. The ath
letic committee is called upon to de
cide "whether football can be so con
ducted that Harvard teams can com
pete on approximately equal terms
with the elevens of other colleges,
or whether intercollegiate football
shall be abandoned."
