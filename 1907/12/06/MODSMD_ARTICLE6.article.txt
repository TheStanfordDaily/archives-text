# NO DEBATE WITH U.S.C.
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE REJECTS OFFER FROM SOUTH. New Auditing System To Be Adopted. Final Meeting To Select Football Coach Next Wednesday. 
### 
The only matter in connection
with an outside university that came
before the Executive Committee last
night was the request from the Uni
! versity of Southern California for
an Intercollegiate debate next spring.
1 In the communication from the sou
thern institution it was stated that
the law school there would be able
to send a strong team to meet the
Stanford debaters. The Executive
Committee, however, decided that
the debaters here have enough Inter
collegiate contests and Manager
Knupp was instructed to decline the
offer.
The Committee considered the pre
sent method of auditing the accounts
of the Student Body treasurer and
the business managers of the Student
Body publications, and decided that
a change should be made. At pres
ent a committee of three from the
Executive Committee attend to the
auditing, but last night it was decid
ed to appoint an expert accountant
to examine the accounts of the three
managers who handle Student Body
money. This acountant will work
in conjunction with the present audit
ing committee. The three managers
will be required to make a report
on or before December 20, as to
their finances for the semester, the j
report to be arranged by months, j
A new design for a debating pin j
which is granted to members of the
j Intercollegiate team, was accepted j
by the Committee and a die will be !
I made.
The final meeting of the Executive J
j Committee for this semester will be
held next Wednesday night, and at '
this time the question of selecting
a football coach for next, season will
be considered.
