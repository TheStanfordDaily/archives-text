###

ent month will be broken temporar
ily tomorrow afternoon, when the
Cardinal Varsity and the Barbarian
fifteen, of San Francisco, will face
each other in the only post-season
game which will be played on Stan
ford Field this season. It is some
what unusual for such a match to
take place on the Campus at this
time of year, and a large crowd will
undoubtedly be on the bleachers, es
pecially if the weather clears. The
contest will, however, be played rain
or shine. Admission to the grounds
| will be twenty-five cents.
The Varsity has been practicing
j faithfully during the past week, and
the men will be in fairly good con
dition for Saturday's struggle. The
members of the squad are working
with a zest and willingness, which
is extremely surprising, considering
the short time they have had since
the end of the regular season. Only
the twenty men who are to make
\ Vancouver trip are appearing for
J practice, and consequently they are
confined to work of a light charac
ter, as no scrums are possible. Nev
; ertheless, the team tomorrow is cer
| tain to give a good account of it
; self, even against the excellent fif
! teen which the Barbarians promise
ito have on the field. The exact
line-up of the visitors has not as
yet been definitely determined, but
will undoubtedly prove as strong or
stlonger than any of their previous
teams.
Ihe Varsity will be composed of
| the fifteen men who will represent
!the Cardinal in the North. Follow
ing is the line-up: Koerner, Rhvne,
Mintui n, ( rawford, J. R. Pember
ton, Thorpe, Miller, forwards; C.
J Pemberton, wing forward; Fenton,
