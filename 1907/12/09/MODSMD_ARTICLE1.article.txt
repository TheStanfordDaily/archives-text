# VARSITY WINS ON SPEED
## BARBARIAN FIFTEEN DEFEATED IN POST-SEASON BATTLE. Exciting Game Ends In Score of 14 to 3.—Cardinal Team Plays Fast Rugby. 
### 
By superior speed and aggressive
ness the Cardinal fifteen overcame i
the Barbarians last Saturday in the
final Rugby game that will be seen
on Stanford Field this year. The
score was 1 4 to The contest w;is
exceedingly fast and exciting, when
ihe fact is considered that the Varsi
ty has been practicing but a few
days. As the result was never in
doubt after the first few minutes of
play, interest centered around the
cleverness of the Stanford backfield.
The visitors were lacking in com
bination, but possessed several good
individual men.
About the middle of the first half
;i try was scored by the Cardinal
on a pretty passing rush, in which
Ganong, Miller, and Holman figured
conspicuously, the last-named carry
ing the ball over the line. Fenton
narrowly missed the goal.
During the remainder of the per
iod the play continued in the Bar
barians' territory, and the visitors
were once forced to touch down.
After the intermission Cook and
Terrill were substituted for Holman
and Koerner respectively. The half
had only begun, when Vandervoort
received the pigskin near the San
Franciscans' goal and dashed across
for a second score, which Fenton
again failed to convert.
Time and again the Cardinal
forced its way well down into Bar
barian territory, but could not
score. Finally, Mitchell got loose
from a ruck, and three more points
were added to Stanford's score. A
hard goal was missed.
After the Varsity had worked the
ball to the visitors' 5-yard line, the
Barbarians braced and rapidly car
ried the pigskin down the field,
Smith going over the line for a try,
which was not converted. Following
immediately on the drop-out, Van
dervoort secured on the !'O-yard line
and scored by a brilliant run. Fen
ton kicked the only goal of the
game, and the final score was 14 to
