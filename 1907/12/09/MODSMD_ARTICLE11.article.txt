# New Entomology Course Announced.
## 
### 
Professor V. L. Kellogg, of the En
tomology department, announces
a new two-hour course, consisting of
one laboratory and one lecture per
iod a week, for next semester. The
new course will be known as Ento
mology 6a, and will deal with the
relation of insects to human dis
eases. Entomology 6 will be a one
hour course instead of a two-hour
course and will consist of one lec
ture a week.
Some work done in biology is the
only prerequisite to either of these
courses.
