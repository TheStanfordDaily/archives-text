# PLEADS FOR CONFESSION.
## Dr. William Horace Day, of Los Angeles, Preaches Interesting Sermon In Chapel Sunday. 
### 
"I acknowledge my sin unto tliee,
; and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
j said, 1 will confess my transgres
sions unto the Lord; and thou for
gavest the iniquity of my sin." This
verse, taken from the thirty-second
Psalm, was used by Dr. William
Horace Day as the topic of his ser
mon in the Chapel yesterday morn
ing.
"The thought of the sermon was
along the lines of the sin of David.
He took for example the man of to
day and made an able plea for con
fession of sins, summing up by say
ing: "There must be confession be
fore there is absolute peace in the
mind of he who has gone wrong."
"Our lives," the speaker said, "are
closely connected with the Al
mighty." He compared this relation
ship with a lagoon connected with
the ocean by a small channel. Should
this channel be severed from the la
goon, the latter becomes stagnant.
