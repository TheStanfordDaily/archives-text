# TO PROBE CORRUPT ATHLETICS.
## Michigan Students Investigate Cause of Alleged Discrimination in Selection of Teams. 
### 
The "rottenness" of athletics at
the University of Michigan is the
cause for an active campaign being
waged by the undergraduates of
that university to eliminate the evil.
The charge has been made at the
institution that the selection of the
teams lias been unfair and that cam
paign politics have entered into ath
letic affairs. The fight is being led
by the "Michigan Daily," which
prints several communications which
explain the situation. Extracts fol
low:
"With the last two issues of the.
"Daily"it becomes apparent that
there is under way in our midst a
more or less general movement to
ward a cleaning up of a situation
in the Athletic Association that
many conservative students have for
a long time dubbed with the one
word, 'Rotten.'
"Let anyone talk with students on
the campus about the Athletic Asso
ciation and its affairs and he will
soon be asked some very pertinent
questions which will be hard to an
swer. A great majority of students
don't know very much about the sit
uation. but many of them see enough
to lead them to some strong conclu
sions. For instance, the captains of
athletic teams practically choose the
managers; the managers, with others,
make up the board of directors. The
boards, in the first place, are not rep
.esentative of the student body, but,
more than that, they appear to abso
lutely under the control of the grad
uate director and his friends. Add
to this the fact that there is mixed
up in all the deals the worst sort of
campus politics, and you begin to
get an idea of a few of the existing
evils.
"The needed reformation is a big
task and needs a great deal more
than lias yet, been definitely stated
in any of the articles that have ap
peared thus far, but it seems to me
that the wedge that should be insert
ed at this time is to take away from
the graduate director his power to
vote on the board of directors. An
amendment to the constitution to
this effect should have the loyal sup
port of all who are sincere in their
desire for reform."
