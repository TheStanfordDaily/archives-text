# CREW WILL NOT TRAIN
## NOT SUFFICIENT TIME FOR FALL BOATING WORK. Murphy's Condition Is Improving and His Early Return to Campus Is Expected. 
### 
The fall training for the crews,
planned to begin the first of this
month, has been abandoned, and the
work of the boating men will not
be started until the beginning of the
coming semester. This step has
been necessitated by the fact that
the final examinations are but a few
diiys away and because the non
completion of the flume will leave
the lake dry for some time to come.
The condition of Coach Murphy is
much improved and when seen by
members of the Boat Club at the past
week-end, he seemed to be greatly
encouraged. This change of mind is
considered by the doctors to be the
principal element needed for his re
covery, and they state that with pro
per surroundings his convalescense
should be very rapid.
Work on the flume has progressed
to such an extent that with a little
more rain the filling of the lake will
be completed by the early part of
next semester, and the crew will not
be retarded in its work from lack of
water.
In view of the tardy date of the
beginning of training, the Boat Club
is anticipating several changes in
the equipment of the boathouse,
which will help to offset any handi
cap which may have been obtained
by California's fall training.
