## 
### 
The appearance of a negro Rhodes
scholar at Oxford has aroused con
siderable opposition among the col
ony of American students at the Eng
lish university. A. L. Locke, a ne
gro student of Harvard, was the suc
cessful candidate for the scholarship
from Pennsylvania, and was received
at Oxford in the same manner as the
other scholarship holders. The pre
judices of a large part of the other
scholars, among whom were a great
many southerners, were aroused by
this, and they joined in a petition of
protest addressed to the secretary of
the Rhodes fund.
Locke is a Harvard graduate, and
made a good record as a student.
He intends to engage in the work of
educating the negro race on his re
turn to America. As he was elected
to the scholarship in the usual way,
it is thought that no concession can
be made to the prejudices of the
A m eri cans.
