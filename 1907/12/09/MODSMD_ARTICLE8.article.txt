The San Francisco Chronicle this
morning publishes a dispatch from
Melbourne, Australia, which quotes
the "Age" as saying that Thomas
Welton Stanford intends to bequeath
the sum of $250,000 for scholarships
at Stanford University. Eight will
be granted each year, on the condi
tion that the appointees shall return
i to Australia, to there employ the
| knowledge they gain here.
Treasurer C. G. Lathrop states that
he has received no information on
the subject lately.
