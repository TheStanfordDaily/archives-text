What the Harvard "Crimson" la
ments as a lack of permanency in
their athletic system lias never been
felt here because that unfortunate
state of affairs has long been kept
in the background by an efficient
safeguard—the graduate coach sys
tem. As was pointed out by Mr.
Reid in his able address before the
Student Body, graduate coaches
mean practically one system, sup
ported by similar methods. Men
who are personally acquainted, with
the best interests of Stanford at
heart, cannot fail to build up in time
a continuity of system and methods
which place the sport at its best.
But probably the greatest argument
in favor of the system is that it
stands for clean sport. Stanford
men, coached by a Stanford gradu
ate with Stanford ideals, play
square ball, fight gamely, and win
or lose like gentlemen; which is
i lie expression of the Stanford Spirit
in athletics. In its session tomor
row evening we urge the Executive
Committee to make one more step
toward perpetuating a system al
ready firmly established here and
which has thus far been uniformly
successful.
