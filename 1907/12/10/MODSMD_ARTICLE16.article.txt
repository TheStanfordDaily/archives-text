# California Players Favor Old Game.
## 
### 
The last number of the California
Occident magazine prints articles by
eight members of the football team,
giving their opinions on the Rugby
game. Each one of them favors a
return to the old game. Captain
elect Bell says, "Rugby is a good
game for sport, but not for an In
tercollegiate contest. The element
of chance is too great to make it
suitable for the American disposi
tion."
An editorial in the same issue la
ments the fact that any move for a
return to the American game must
come from Stanford, as the victor
iix the last contest.
