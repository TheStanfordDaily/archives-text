The last regular meeting of the
Guild Board for the semester was
held at the Guild Hospital yester
day evening. Professor 11. E. Swain,
chairman of the auditing committee
appointed to examine former treas
urer Fullaway's books, tiled a report,
which showed the accounts to be cor
rect.
The report of the management
committee disclosed a number of
heavy expenditures for the month
ending November 30. The sum of
$1598 was appropriated to meet
these outstanding obligations.
The committee, in charge of the
purchase of the Hilsen property, re
ported that the deal had been con
summated and the property trans
ferred, thereby making the Hospital
the owner of the whole frontage on
Lytton Avenue. Four hundred dol
lars was voted to buy the necessary
equipment for the newly acquired
emergency cottage.
The staff nurse, who has been sta
tioned on the Campus for the pur
pose of quickly responding to emer
gency calls, resigned her position.
The board decided not to till the va
cancy for the present.
