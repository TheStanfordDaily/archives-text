# HEMPEL DESIRES GAMES
## ST. VINCENT COACH WANTS BASEBALL SERIES HERE. Will Take Cardinal Team South and Wishes Return Games With Northern Colleges. 
### 
Coach Hempel, of St. Vincent's Col
lege, of Los Angeles, arrived on the
Campus yesterday to arrange for a
series of baseball games between the
teams of Stanford and the southern
college. Hempel has not arranged
definite dates for these games as yet,
but he proposes to bring the Cardin
al team south on the twenty-seventh
and twenty-eighth of February and
asks for a return trip for his own ag
gregation about the middle of March.
The exact dates will be arranged
as soon as Hempel has conferred
| with Manager Snedigar, of the Uni-
I versity of California. For this pur
! pose Hempel, in company with Grad
uate Manager Knupp, went, to Ber
keley today. The same trip as is
now being negotiated for was taken
by the St. Vincent team last season,
i but owing to the great number of
games that were crowded into the
schedule, the players were unable to
play up to their customary good
form.
Hempel considers that his team
J will be stronger this year than ever
i before, as he will have a majority
i of the veterans of last year's nine in
; the line up, besides some good addi
' tions. In order to develop any new
; material, practice will begin early
I in flie next semester and hard train
ing will continue from then until
! the end of the season.
If the coach succeeds in arrang
j ing the dates for games as he has
planned them at the present time,
i the team will have ample opportun
ity to rest before each game, and
should play high class baseball
throughout their northern tour, as
they usually have the championship
aggregation of Southern California.
In all probability, games will also
be arranged with the teams of St.
i Mary's and Santa Clara Colleges.
