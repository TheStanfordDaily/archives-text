The appointment of Mr. Presley
to the position of head Coach comes
as no surprise to the Student Body.
The services which this man has ren
dered Stanford athletics on the base
ball and football fields and the man
ner in which he fulfilled the duties
of field coach during the past foot
ball season combine to make him the
logical successor to Mr. Lanagan. We
congratulate the Student Body upon
their good fortune in securing one
who is well qualified to carry forward
Lanagan ideas and Lanagan successes.
Mr. Fenton, as assistant coach, will have
the full confidence of the Student Body.
His selection is a wise one, and a fitting
tribute to a man who has played a Lad
ing part in Stanford's late athletic vic
tories. As a continuation of the gradu
ate coach system, tonight's action of the
.Executive Committee is also to be heart
ily commended. The outlook for a fifth
Intercollegiate football victory is a bright
one.
