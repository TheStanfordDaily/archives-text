# OXFORD ASKS FOR MONEY
## WANTS TWO AND ONE-HALF MILLIONS MORE ENDOWMENT. Student Expenses High.â€”English Fear that Authorities are Extravagant. 
### 
Oxford University has sent out an
appeal for $2,500,000 endowment,
which leads an English financial
writer to ask what it is doing with
its present large income. In 1903
the income of the university and its
colleges was $4,195,000. Only
$265,000 of this was spent upon the
teaching staff of the university. A
large part of the income, however,
is not clear, but paid by students for
board, lodging, etc., on which little
profit is made.
The university spends approximate
ly $725 per year on each student,
for tuition, administration, etc. Col
umbia, the most, expensive of the
American colleges, spends but $515
in this way, while Michigan expends
only $180, and the University of
Berlin $195.
Furthermore, each Oxford student
spends about $750 for his living ex
penses and fees, during the six
months' residence. The average to
tal expense of each is unobtainable,
but probably is in excess of the
$1500 with which the Rhodes schol
ars are provided. At Columbia,
however, each student's total ex
pense during the year is estimated
at from $7SO to $990: at Michigan,
from to $570, while at Berlin,
Bonn, and the Scottish universities,
$300 is reckoned as the average, ex
cluding tuition.
Mr. Lawson, the writer of the ar
ticle, concludes that the university
is not managed properly, and that
too much of the income is spent in
supporting "dons" who live at Ox
ford, but do no teaching.
