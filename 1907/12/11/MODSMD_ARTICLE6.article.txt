# SOPHOMORES WIN DEBATE
## INTERCLASS CONTEST GOES TO SECOND-YEAR TEAM. Good Arguments Advanced By Speakers on Both Sides in Discussion of Exclusion Problem. 
### 
The Sophomores won the annual
interclass debate last night after a
forensic battle which was far above
the average in the quality of argu
ment, advanced.
The winning team upheld the af
firmative of the subject, "Resolved,
That Japanese laborers should be
excluded from continental United
States," arguing that the Orientals
were unassimilable on accountoftheir
different views in regard to religion,
morals, government and standards of
living and their loyalty to their na
tive country; that they rapidly su
perseded Americans in skilled trades;
that the continued immigration of
.Japanese tended to increase the dif
ficulty of an already aggravated race
problem: and that the Japanese gov
ernment, already recognized that the
future welfare of both nations neces
sitated the absolute discontinuance
of further emigration.
The Freshman team, consisting of
\V. S. Porter, F. H. Hilton, and F.
E. Hill, advanced a much better ar
gument than is usually advanced by
lirst-vear debaters, and it.was no
: easy matter for the judges to decide
ion the winning team.
The best individual speaker of
the evening was J. E. Shelton, who,
by his forcible rebuttal practically
j decided the debate. S. A. Lindauer's
arguments were arranged in careful,
logical sequence, and his delivery
1 was convincing. P. J. Hat kin did
! some good extemporaneous work.
Shelton was a member of the
Freshman Team last year and is a
member of Euphronia Literary Socie
ty and the Executive Committee. Lin
da ner is a member of Nestoria and
an assistant on the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto. Matkin is a member of
Euphronia. and Encina Club.
The debate was judged by Profes
sors 11. A. Millis and J. M. Motley,
of the Economies department, and
Professor H. W. Stuart, of the Phil
; osophy department.
