# Camp Wants Forward Pass Limited.
## 
### 
Walter Camp, of Yale, the lead
ing authority upon the revised game,
says that the new football rules have
entirely justified themselves, with
the exception of the forward pass.
This he thinks should he restricted,
in order to lake the element of
chance out of the game as much as
possible.
