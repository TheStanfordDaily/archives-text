# Strong Stanford Teams Next Semester.
## Outlook For Cardinal Victories In All Branches of Intercollegiate Sport Next Spring- Is Bright. Murphy Will Coach Crews Again. 
### 
Stanford's prospects for a victor
ious spring- in the athletic world are
ol' the best. On the track fourteen
of the point winners of last year
will again compete and many veter
ans of previous years will return. In
baseball Stanford will be represent
ed by practically a veteran team.
Five of the 15)07 varsity crew will re
spond to the call of Coach .Murphy,
and there will he an abundance of
material from which to till the three
remaining seats in the boat. There
are four veteran tennis men from
whom to select a team to meet Cal
ifornia.
Many Veterans on Track and Field.
With the close of fall training the
outlook for a successful track sea
son at Stanford next year may be
considered good, although Trainer
"Dad" Moulton says it will require
plenty of hard work to develop i
winning team and he cannot afford
to lose a single man that he is now
counting upon. At present there are
fourteen athletes in college who
took points in the Intercollegiate
meet which Stanford won last spring
with a total of 65. These men made

4f» points and the eight point-win
ners of last year's team who have
left college were responsible for but
Ifi, which shows that in actual point
winning th« loss has not been heavy.
J. C. MacFarland, '07, captain of the
team last, year, is by far the most se
vere loss, as he made nine points
last spring against. California. The
other varsity men who will not be
here next spring are L. M. Edwards,

'07, C. F. El well, *07,
W. T. McNeil, '07, W.
W. Edwards, '07, G. L.
Aynesworth, 'OS, and R.
S. Worthington, '09. E.
J. Helsley, '10, who took
third in the low hurdles,
is not in college at pre
sent, but is expected to
return in January. The
losses from last year will
be felt most keenly in
the relay and it will be
necessary to develop prac
tically an entire team for
this event next spring.
In the return of H. L.
Horton, '08, the track
'earn will be greatly
strengthened, and he is
looked upon to take the
place of Macfarland in
the hurdles and in addi
tion is a valuable man in
the shot-put. Horton
has not competed in an
Intercollegiate track con
test since his freshman
year, but in that meet
he was a big point-win-

ner and has shown his old-time form
in the fall training. Of the team
last year Captain Lanagan, J. O. Mil-

ler, E. J. Nash, P. M. Da
vis, T. Vandervoort, and
D. P. Crawford are first
place winners who may
be counted upon to help
materially in the contest
next spring. Besides
these first-phice men,
there are such men as C.
P. Bradford, "09, B. L.
Gregg, '09, .T. R. Holman.
'09, C, Coonan, '09, W.
D. Peaslee, '09, 11. E.
Reed, '10. L. Scott, '10,
and H. V. Poor. '10, who
made points in the Inter
collegiate contest last
year and are looked upon
as men who will show
improvement during the
coming season.
There are also several
athletes who competed in
the meet last year and,
although they did not
place then, they are ex
pected to do so in the
next Intercollegiate meet.
Among these are R. A.
Kocher, '08, in the pole-

vault, who made his "S" in 1905, H.
H. Maundrell, '10, P. F. Bradley, '10,
C L. Severy, '08, E. A. McGregor,
'OS, and W. C. Shelton, '08. Another
track man who lias returned to col
lege is S. N. Bellah, '10, and he
will no doubt prove a valuable man
in the pole-vault and hurdles. GS. D.
Hussey, '09, is a fast quarter-miler
who has returned and will run again
next spring.

There has been little opportunity
to judge the 1911 athletes. In the
! two meets that have been held sev
eral Freshmen have shown up well,
particularly W. M. Wyman, in the
j quarter; R. B. Wheeler in the
■ quarter; J. E. Thompson, in the half
| mile; and Herbert. Raines, in the
hurdles and high jump. In addition
to these men there are some other
Freshmen with good preparatory
school records who should develop in
j to varsity material.
Briefly, it may be said that Trainer
, Moulton and Captain Lanagan have
the nucleus of a winning track team
with which to begin the season and
i with the men who will develop, it
seems probable that next year's track
tea mwill be as strong as the winning
aggregation of 1907.
Baseball Outlook Is Bright.
Of the ten men who played on the
varsity baseball team during the
1907 series with California, probab
ly eight will be in college and eli
gible to compete on the 190S nine.
Of the eight, Captain Fenton, Theile,
Scott, Cadwalader, Sampson, Owen
and Wirt are now registered, and
l ight fielder Gore has assured Coach
Presley of his return at the opening
of the spring semester. Further
j more, J. H. Bell, 'OS, u veteran of
| two seasons, will appear on the dia
i mond once again. With such a nu
' cleus of stars to begin with, the
! coining baseball season presages the
! greatest of success.
The mainstay of the pitching de
! partment will again be Theile, who
I was in the box during all the three
