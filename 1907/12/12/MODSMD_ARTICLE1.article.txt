# Strong Stanford Teams Next Semester.
## Outlook For Cardinal Victories In All Branches of Intercollegiate Sport Next Spring- Is Bright. Murphy Will Coach Crews Again. 
### 
Stanford's prospects for a victor
ious spring- in the athletic world are
ol' the best. On the track fourteen
of the point winners of last year
will again compete and many veter
ans of previous years will return. In
baseball Stanford will be represent
ed by practically a veteran team.
Five of the 15)07 varsity crew will re
spond to the call of Coach .Murphy,
and there will he an abundance of
material from which to till the three
remaining seats in the boat. There
are four veteran tennis men from
whom to select a team to meet Cal
ifornia.
Many Veterans on Track and Field.
With the close of fall training the
outlook for a successful track sea
son at Stanford next year may be
considered good, although Trainer
"Dad" Moulton says it will require
plenty of hard work to develop i
winning team and he cannot afford
to lose a single man that he is now
counting upon. At present there are
fourteen athletes in college who
took points in the Intercollegiate
meet which Stanford won last spring
with a total of 65. These men made

4f» points and the eight point-win
ners of last year's team who have
left college were responsible for but
Ifi, which shows that in actual point
winning th« loss has not been heavy.
J. C. MacFarland, '07, captain of the
team last, year, is by far the most se
vere loss, as he made nine points
last spring against. California. The
other varsity men who will not be
here next spring are L. M. Edwards,

'07, C. F. El well, *07,
W. T. McNeil, '07, W.
W. Edwards, '07, G. L.
Aynesworth, 'OS, and R.
S. Worthington, '09. E.
J. Helsley, '10, who took
third in the low hurdles,
is not in college at pre
sent, but is expected to
return in January. The
losses from last year will
be felt most keenly in
the relay and it will be
necessary to develop prac
tically an entire team for
this event next spring.
In the return of H. L.
Horton, '08, the track
'earn will be greatly
strengthened, and he is
looked upon to take the
place of Macfarland in
the hurdles and in addi
tion is a valuable man in
the shot-put. Horton
has not competed in an
Intercollegiate track con
test since his freshman
year, but in that meet
he was a big point-win-

ner and has shown his old-time form
in the fall training. Of the team
last year Captain Lanagan, J. O. Mil-

ler, E. J. Nash, P. M. Da
vis, T. Vandervoort, and
D. P. Crawford are first
place winners who may
be counted upon to help
materially in the contest
next spring. Besides
these first-phice men,
there are such men as C.
P. Bradford, "09, B. L.
Gregg, '09, .T. R. Holman.
'09, C, Coonan, '09, W.
D. Peaslee, '09, 11. E.
Reed, '10. L. Scott, '10,
and H. V. Poor. '10, who
made points in the Inter
collegiate contest last
year and are looked upon
as men who will show
improvement during the
coming season.
There are also several
athletes who competed in
the meet last year and,
although they did not
place then, they are ex
pected to do so in the
next Intercollegiate meet.
Among these are R. A.
Kocher, '08, in the pole-

vault, who made his "S" in 1905, H.
H. Maundrell, '10, P. F. Bradley, '10,
C L. Severy, '08, E. A. McGregor,
'OS, and W. C. Shelton, '08. Another
track man who lias returned to col
lege is S. N. Bellah, '10, and he
will no doubt prove a valuable man
in the pole-vault and hurdles. GS. D.
Hussey, '09, is a fast quarter-miler
who has returned and will run again
next spring.

There has been little opportunity
to judge the 1911 athletes. In the
! two meets that have been held sev
eral Freshmen have shown up well,
particularly W. M. Wyman, in the
j quarter; R. B. Wheeler in the
■ quarter; J. E. Thompson, in the half
| mile; and Herbert. Raines, in the
hurdles and high jump. In addition
to these men there are some other
Freshmen with good preparatory
school records who should develop in
j to varsity material.
Briefly, it may be said that Trainer
, Moulton and Captain Lanagan have
the nucleus of a winning track team
with which to begin the season and
i with the men who will develop, it
seems probable that next year's track
tea mwill be as strong as the winning
aggregation of 1907.
Baseball Outlook Is Bright.
Of the ten men who played on the
varsity baseball team during the
1907 series with California, probab
ly eight will be in college and eli
gible to compete on the 190S nine.
Of the eight, Captain Fenton, Theile,
Scott, Cadwalader, Sampson, Owen
and Wirt are now registered, and
l ight fielder Gore has assured Coach
Presley of his return at the opening
of the spring semester. Further
j more, J. H. Bell, 'OS, u veteran of
| two seasons, will appear on the dia
i mond once again. With such a nu
' cleus of stars to begin with, the
! coining baseball season presages the
! greatest of success.
The mainstay of the pitching de
! partment will again be Theile, who
I was in the box during all the three


!<!. Sampson, Shortstop on 13)07 Varsity.


J. O. Miller, Stanford's Veteran Distance Man
; samt'S with California last spring.
He will have a trio of efficient as
sistants in Goodell, who threw his
' arr out just before the opening
match of the Intercollegiate series;
and in Witrner, who was ineligible
during the season of 1907; and in
L. F. Smith.
Nothing definite can be said as
i to who will be behind the bat, but
| it is probable that the burden of the
work will fall upon Ganong, who
j caught two games last March, when
I Stott, Daily, and Presley were all on
the injured list. He proved an ac
ceptable substitute and is sure to
improve with a little more experi
eace. Mitchell, who played on the
1910 nine, may be found available
as a backstop.
A fast and sure infield is a certain
ty. For the fourth successive year,
Fenton will hold down the third
bag. Sampson will again be seen
ai shortstop, while jthere will be
three first-class candidates for sec
ond base: Bell, Scott, and Cadwal
ader, all of whom are varsity veter
ans. li. is not unlikely that the
fghL for this position will center
between Scott and Cadwalader, Bell
being shifted to first. No suitable
successor to Presley has as yet been
found, and as Bel! is a good all
round man, he would undoubtedly
fill the place satisfactorily.
Owen, Wirt, and Gore, the fielders
of last season, seem to have a good
hold on those positions for next
spring. Wirt may leave the Univer
sity at Christmas, however, and it is
possible that Gore may not return.
In this case, Dennis and either Cad
walader or Scott appear as Candi
da tes for the vacancy,
Tiius it is safe to rssume that tin
St nine will once again n« , ;
almost perfect field machine,
it is piobable that t! trc will bo •ho
u-iiul weakness in the batting dt
rirtment, although pi.-sibly nol so
p-otiounced as in former years, ire
loss of Presley, Stott, and Daily is
sure to be felt, but the material
available at present, together with
any that may be developed from the
Freshman Class, will do much to off
set the absence of three such re
liable men.

When Coach Murphy issues his
call, early in the spring semester,
for candidates for the Varsity and
Freshman eights, there will be a
large amount of good crew material
to respond. From the members of
last year's victorious eight, there will
be only two men who will not be in
I college to compete in the Intercolle
j giate regatta—.l. R. Pemberton, '08,
j and H. E. Stark, '09. Pemberton
i will leave college at the end of the
| present semester on a scientific expe-
I dition, and Stark is no longer in at
| tendance at the University. It is
very probably that R. H. Conant,
'OS, will return to college to com
plete his course and in this event he
will probably take his old position
at stroke.
In addition to these veterans there
will be several others who were in
training last year but did not com
pete against California. Of these,
C. H. Wondries, '09, H. B. Patrick,
'10, R. H. Reynolds, '10, J. W. Fit
ting, '10, and C. H. Vose, '10, by
liard and competent work through
out the period of training, showed
their ability to pull an oar in a Var
sity crew. Patrick showed up es-
I pecially well in competition against
; the University of Washington. The
! position of coxswain will, without
doubt, be filled by F. W. Turner, '08,
j who acquitted himself well as direct
! or of his Freshman crew and the '07
I Varsity.
Probably the greatest element that
| will lend success to the Cardinal
| eight next season will be there-
I turn of "Dan" Murphy to the posi
j tion of coach. Last year Mur
phy developed in his men a stroke
that, though criticized as to correct
form, showed its effectiveness with
out the shadow of a doubt on the
two occasions of competition against
the University of California and the
well-trained oarsmen of Washington.
With a full crew of men to take this
I stroke up again, the development of
the eight should be rapid. Murphy
has the entire confidence and respect
of every man who has worked mith
him, and has much more command
than would be expected from a pro
| fessional coach.
With the appropriation of a suf
| ficient, fund for the permanent re-
I building of the flume, the lake that
has caused so much trouble in the
past can be easily filled in a short j
time, and the shells and barges can
be putin the water for use early i
next semester. This forming of a
good place for practice for the crew :
candidates means much to the sue- :
cess of Stanford this year, for with j
the natural boating facilities possess
ed by the University of Washing
ton, and the new, expensive equip- 1
ment lately installed at. Berkeley,
there is a great handicap to be ov
ercome.
A Tennis Victory Is Uncertain.
The outlook for a victory in tennis
next year is not as bright, perhaps,
as it is in the other three branches
of spring sports. A. J. Gowan,'o9,
T. C. Henry, 10. and P. B. Delano. |
'08, who composed last year's win
ning team, will be on the courts next
semester, and this trio of players will
he strengthened by the addition of
J. F. Cassell, 'OS, a member of the
'O.j, Varsity, and the present holder
of the Thiele trophy.
This advantage, however, will be
more than counterbalanced by the
presence of the Long brothers at
California. Melville Long is ex
champion of the Pacific Coast, and
his brother, Herbert, was at one !

time the holder of the San Francisco
championship. Against these exper
ienced players the Stanford team
could hope for little more than close
matches, with a possible victory in
the doubles.
There is a possibility that Herbert
Long will not return to California.
Should this be the case, the Stanford
men will be confronted by the same
problem which they solved last sem
ester, that of defeating a team of
three, one member of which is a
player of unusual brilliance.
Stanford's prospects for a victor
ious spring- in the athletic world are
ol' the best. On the track fourteen
of the point winners of last year
will again compete and many veter
ans of previous years will return. In

J. O. Miller, Stanford's Veteran Distance Man
; samt'S with California last spring.
He will have a trio of efficient as
sistants in Goodell, who threw his
' arr out just before the opening
match of the Intercollegiate series;
and in Witrner, who was ineligible
during the season of 1907; and in
L. F. Smith.
Nothing definite can be said as
i to who will be behind the bat, but
| it is probable that the burden of the
work will fall upon Ganong, who
j caught two games last March, when
I Stott, Daily, and Presley were all on
the injured list. He proved an ac
ceptable substitute and is sure to
improve with a little more experi
eace. Mitchell, who played on the
1910 nine, may be found available
as a backstop.
A fast and sure infield is a certain
ty. For the fourth successive year,
Fenton will hold down the third
bag. Sampson will again be seen
ai shortstop, while jthere will be
three first-class candidates for sec
ond base: Bell, Scott, and Cadwal
ader, all of whom are varsity veter
ans. li. is not unlikely that the
fghL for this position will center
between Scott and Cadwalader, Bell
being shifted to first. No suitable
successor to Presley has as yet been
found, and as Bel! is a good all
round man, he would undoubtedly
fill the place satisfactorily.
Owen, Wirt, and Gore, the fielders
of last season, seem to have a good
hold on those positions for next
spring. Wirt may leave the Univer
sity at Christmas, however, and it is
possible that Gore may not return.
In this case, Dennis and either Cad
walader or Scott appear as Candi
da tes for the vacancy,
Tiius it is safe to rssume that tin
St nine will once again n« , ;
almost perfect field machine,
it is piobable that t! trc will bo •ho
u-iiul weakness in the batting dt
rirtment, although pi.-sibly nol so
p-otiounced as in former years, ire
loss of Presley, Stott, and Daily is
sure to be felt, but the material
available at present, together with
any that may be developed from the
Freshman Class, will do much to off
set the absence of three such re
liable men.

When Coach Murphy issues his
call, early in the spring semester,
for candidates for the Varsity and
Freshman eights, there will be a
large amount of good crew material
to respond. From the members of
last year's victorious eight, there will
be only two men who will not be in
I college to compete in the Intercolle
j giate regatta—.l. R. Pemberton, '08,
j and H. E. Stark, '09. Pemberton
i will leave college at the end of the
| present semester on a scientific expe-
I dition, and Stark is no longer in at
| tendance at the University. It is
very probably that R. H. Conant,
'OS, will return to college to com
plete his course and in this event he
will probably take his old position
at stroke.
In addition to these veterans there
will be several others who were in
training last year but did not com
pete against California. Of these,
C. H. Wondries, '09, H. B. Patrick,
'10, R. H. Reynolds, '10, J. W. Fit
ting, '10, and C. H. Vose, '10, by
liard and competent work through
out the period of training, showed
their ability to pull an oar in a Var
sity crew. Patrick showed up es-
I pecially well in competition against
; the University of Washington. The
! position of coxswain will, without
doubt, be filled by F. W. Turner, '08,
j who acquitted himself well as direct
! or of his Freshman crew and the '07
I Varsity.
Probably the greatest element that
| will lend success to the Cardinal
| eight next season will be there-
I turn of "Dan" Murphy to the posi
j tion of coach. Last year Mur
phy developed in his men a stroke
that, though criticized as to correct
form, showed its effectiveness with
out the shadow of a doubt on the
two occasions of competition against
the University of California and the
well-trained oarsmen of Washington.
With a full crew of men to take this
I stroke up again, the development of
the eight should be rapid. Murphy
has the entire confidence and respect
of every man who has worked mith
him, and has much more command
than would be expected from a pro
| fessional coach.
With the appropriation of a suf
| ficient, fund for the permanent re-
I building of the flume, the lake that
has caused so much trouble in the
past can be easily filled in a short j
time, and the shells and barges can
be putin the water for use early i
next semester. This forming of a
good place for practice for the crew :
candidates means much to the sue- :
cess of Stanford this year, for with j
the natural boating facilities possess
ed by the University of Washing
ton, and the new, expensive equip- 1
ment lately installed at. Berkeley,
there is a great handicap to be ov
ercome.
A Tennis Victory Is Uncertain.
The outlook for a victory in tennis
next year is not as bright, perhaps,
as it is in the other three branches
of spring sports. A. J. Gowan,'o9,
T. C. Henry, 10. and P. B. Delano. |
'08, who composed last year's win
ning team, will be on the courts next
semester, and this trio of players will
he strengthened by the addition of
J. F. Cassell, 'OS, a member of the
'O.j, Varsity, and the present holder
of the Thiele trophy.
This advantage, however, will be
more than counterbalanced by the
presence of the Long brothers at
California. Melville Long is ex
champion of the Pacific Coast, and
his brother, Herbert, was at one !

time the holder of the San Francisco
championship. Against these exper
ienced players the Stanford team
could hope for little more than close
matches, with a possible victory in
the doubles.
There is a possibility that Herbert
Long will not return to California.
Should this be the case, the Stanford
men will be confronted by the same
problem which they solved last sem
ester, that of defeating a team of
three, one member of which is a
player of unusual brilliance.
Stanford's prospects for a victor
ious spring- in the athletic world are
ol' the best. On the track fourteen
of the point winners of last year
will again compete and many veter
ans of previous years will return. In
baseball Stanford will be represent
ed by practically a veteran team.
Five of the 15)07 varsity crew will re
spond to the call of Coach .Murphy,
and there will he an abundance of
material from which to till the three
remaining seats in the boat. There
are four veteran tennis men from
whom to select a team to meet Cal
ifornia.
Many Veterans on Track and Field.
With the close of fall training the
outlook for a successful track sea
son at Stanford next year may be
considered good, although Trainer
"Dad" Moulton says it will require
plenty of hard work to develop i
winning team and he cannot afford
to lose a single man that he is now
counting upon. At present there are
fourteen athletes in college who
took points in the Intercollegiate
meet which Stanford won last spring
with a total of 65. These men made

4f» points and the eight point-win
ners of last year's team who have
left college were responsible for but
Ifi, which shows that in actual point
winning th« loss has not been heavy.
J. C. MacFarland, '07, captain of the
team last, year, is by far the most se
vere loss, as he made nine points
last spring against. California. The
other varsity men who will not be
here next spring are L. M. Edwards,

'07, C. F. El well, *07,
W. T. McNeil, '07, W.
W. Edwards, '07, G. L.
Aynesworth, 'OS, and R.
S. Worthington, '09. E.
J. Helsley, '10, who took
third in the low hurdles,
is not in college at pre
sent, but is expected to
return in January. The
losses from last year will
be felt most keenly in
the relay and it will be
necessary to develop prac
tically an entire team for
this event next spring.
In the return of H. L.
Horton, '08, the track
'earn will be greatly
strengthened, and he is
looked upon to take the
place of Macfarland in
the hurdles and in addi
tion is a valuable man in
the shot-put. Horton
has not competed in an
Intercollegiate track con
test since his freshman
year, but in that meet
he was a big point-win-

ner and has shown his old-time form
in the fall training. Of the team
last year Captain Lanagan, J. O. Mil-

ler, E. J. Nash, P. M. Da
vis, T. Vandervoort, and
D. P. Crawford are first
place winners who may
be counted upon to help
materially in the contest
next spring. Besides
these first-phice men,
there are such men as C.
P. Bradford, "09, B. L.
Gregg, '09, .T. R. Holman.
'09, C, Coonan, '09, W.
D. Peaslee, '09, 11. E.
Reed, '10. L. Scott, '10,
and H. V. Poor. '10, who
made points in the Inter
collegiate contest last
year and are looked upon
as men who will show
improvement during the
coming season.
There are also several
athletes who competed in
the meet last year and,
although they did not
place then, they are ex
pected to do so in the
next Intercollegiate meet.
Among these are R. A.
Kocher, '08, in the pole-

vault, who made his "S" in 1905, H.
H. Maundrell, '10, P. F. Bradley, '10,
C L. Severy, '08, E. A. McGregor,
'OS, and W. C. Shelton, '08. Another
track man who lias returned to col
lege is S. N. Bellah, '10, and he
will no doubt prove a valuable man
in the pole-vault and hurdles. GS. D.
Hussey, '09, is a fast quarter-miler
who has returned and will run again
next spring.

There has been little opportunity
to judge the 1911 athletes. In the
! two meets that have been held sev
eral Freshmen have shown up well,
particularly W. M. Wyman, in the
j quarter; R. B. Wheeler in the
■ quarter; J. E. Thompson, in the half
| mile; and Herbert. Raines, in the
hurdles and high jump. In addition
to these men there are some other
Freshmen with good preparatory
school records who should develop in
j to varsity material.
Briefly, it may be said that Trainer
, Moulton and Captain Lanagan have
the nucleus of a winning track team
with which to begin the season and
i with the men who will develop, it
seems probable that next year's track
tea mwill be as strong as the winning
aggregation of 1907.
Baseball Outlook Is Bright.
Of the ten men who played on the
varsity baseball team during the
1907 series with California, probab
ly eight will be in college and eli
gible to compete on the 190S nine.
Of the eight, Captain Fenton, Theile,
Scott, Cadwalader, Sampson, Owen
and Wirt are now registered, and
l ight fielder Gore has assured Coach
Presley of his return at the opening
of the spring semester. Further
j more, J. H. Bell, 'OS, u veteran of
| two seasons, will appear on the dia
i mond once again. With such a nu
' cleus of stars to begin with, the
! coining baseball season presages the
! greatest of success.
The mainstay of the pitching de
! partment will again be Theile, who

could hope for little more than close
matches, with a possible victory in
the doubles.
There is a possibility that Herbert
Long will not return to California.
Should this be the case, the Stanford
men will be confronted by the same
problem which they solved last sem
ester, that of defeating a team of
three, one member of which is a
player of unusual brilliance.
Stanford's prospects for a victor
ious spring- in the athletic world are
ol' the best. On the track fourteen
of the point winners of last year
will again compete and many veter
ans of previous years will return. In
baseball Stanford will be represent
ed by practically a veteran team.
Five of the 15)07 varsity crew will re
spond to the call of Coach .Murphy,
and there will he an abundance of
material from which to till the three
remaining seats in the boat. There
are four veteran tennis men from
whom to select a team to meet Cal
ifornia.
Many Veterans on Track and Field.
With the close of fall training the
outlook for a successful track sea
son at Stanford next year may be
considered good, although Trainer
"Dad" Moulton says it will require
plenty of hard work to develop i
winning team and he cannot afford
to lose a single man that he is now
counting upon. At present there are
fourteen athletes in college who
took points in the Intercollegiate
meet which Stanford won last spring
with a total of 65. These men made

4f» points and the eight point-win
ners of last year's team who have
left college were responsible for but
Ifi, which shows that in actual point
winning th« loss has not been heavy.
J. C. MacFarland, '07, captain of the
team last, year, is by far the most se
vere loss, as he made nine points
last spring against. California. The
other varsity men who will not be
here next spring are L. M. Edwards,

'07, C. F. El well, *07,
W. T. McNeil, '07, W.
W. Edwards, '07, G. L.
Aynesworth, 'OS, and R.
S. Worthington, '09. E.
J. Helsley, '10, who took
third in the low hurdles,
is not in college at pre
sent, but is expected to
return in January. The
losses from last year will
be felt most keenly in
the relay and it will be
necessary to develop prac
tically an entire team for
this event next spring.
In the return of H. L.
Horton, '08, the track
'earn will be greatly
strengthened, and he is
looked upon to take the
place of Macfarland in
the hurdles and in addi
tion is a valuable man in
the shot-put. Horton
has not competed in an
Intercollegiate track con
test since his freshman
year, but in that meet
he was a big point-win-

ner and has shown his old-time form
in the fall training. Of the team
last year Captain Lanagan, J. O. Mil-

ler, E. J. Nash, P. M. Da
vis, T. Vandervoort, and
D. P. Crawford are first
place winners who may
be counted upon to help
materially in the contest
next spring. Besides
these first-phice men,
there are such men as C.
P. Bradford, "09, B. L.
Gregg, '09, .T. R. Holman.
'09, C, Coonan, '09, W.
D. Peaslee, '09, 11. E.
Reed, '10. L. Scott, '10,
and H. V. Poor. '10, who
made points in the Inter
collegiate contest last
year and are looked upon
as men who will show
improvement during the
coming season.
There are also several
athletes who competed in
the meet last year and,
although they did not
place then, they are ex
pected to do so in the
next Intercollegiate meet.
Among these are R. A.
Kocher, '08, in the pole-

vault, who made his "S" in 1905, H.
H. Maundrell, '10, P. F. Bradley, '10,
C L. Severy, '08, E. A. McGregor,
'OS, and W. C. Shelton, '08. Another
track man who lias returned to col
lege is S. N. Bellah, '10, and he
will no doubt prove a valuable man
in the pole-vault and hurdles. GS. D.
Hussey, '09, is a fast quarter-miler
who has returned and will run again
next spring.

There has been little opportunity
to judge the 1911 athletes. In the
! two meets that have been held sev
eral Freshmen have shown up well,
particularly W. M. Wyman, in the
j quarter; R. B. Wheeler in the
■ quarter; J. E. Thompson, in the half
| mile; and Herbert. Raines, in the
hurdles and high jump. In addition
to these men there are some other
Freshmen with good preparatory
school records who should develop in
j to varsity material.
Briefly, it may be said that Trainer
, Moulton and Captain Lanagan have
the nucleus of a winning track team
with which to begin the season and
i with the men who will develop, it
seems probable that next year's track
tea mwill be as strong as the winning
aggregation of 1907.
Baseball Outlook Is Bright.
Of the ten men who played on the
varsity baseball team during the
1907 series with California, probab
ly eight will be in college and eli
gible to compete on the 190S nine.
Of the eight, Captain Fenton, Theile,
Scott, Cadwalader, Sampson, Owen
and Wirt are now registered, and
l ight fielder Gore has assured Coach
Presley of his return at the opening
of the spring semester. Further
j more, J. H. Bell, 'OS, u veteran of
| two seasons, will appear on the dia
i mond once again. With such a nu
' cleus of stars to begin with, the
! coining baseball season presages the
! greatest of success.
The mainstay of the pitching de
! partment will again be Theile, who
I was in the box during all the three


!<!. Sampson, Shortstop on 13)07 Varsity.


J. O. Miller, Stanford's Veteran Distance Man
; samt'S with California last spring.
He will have a trio of efficient as
sistants in Goodell, who threw his
' arr out just before the opening
match of the Intercollegiate series;
and in Witrner, who was ineligible
during the season of 1907; and in
L. F. Smith.
Nothing definite can be said as
i to who will be behind the bat, but
| it is probable that the burden of the
work will fall upon Ganong, who
j caught two games last March, when
I Stott, Daily, and Presley were all on
the injured list. He proved an ac
ceptable substitute and is sure to
improve with a little more experi
eace. Mitchell, who played on the
1910 nine, may be found available
as a backstop.
A fast and sure infield is a certain
ty. For the fourth successive year,
Fenton will hold down the third
bag. Sampson will again be seen
ai shortstop, while jthere will be
three first-class candidates for sec
ond base: Bell, Scott, and Cadwal
ader, all of whom are varsity veter
ans. li. is not unlikely that the
fghL for this position will center
between Scott and Cadwalader, Bell
being shifted to first. No suitable
successor to Presley has as yet been
found, and as Bel! is a good all
round man, he would undoubtedly
fill the place satisfactorily.
Owen, Wirt, and Gore, the fielders
of last season, seem to have a good
hold on those positions for next
spring. Wirt may leave the Univer
sity at Christmas, however, and it is
possible that Gore may not return.
In this case, Dennis and either Cad
walader or Scott appear as Candi
da tes for the vacancy,
Tiius it is safe to rssume that tin
St nine will once again n« , ;
almost perfect field machine,
it is piobable that t! trc will bo •ho
u-iiul weakness in the batting dt
rirtment, although pi.-sibly nol so
p-otiounced as in former years, ire
loss of Presley, Stott, and Daily is
sure to be felt, but the material
available at present, together with
any that may be developed from the
Freshman Class, will do much to off
set the absence of three such re
liable men.

When Coach Murphy issues his
call, early in the spring semester,
for candidates for the Varsity and
Freshman eights, there will be a
large amount of good crew material
to respond. From the members of
last year's victorious eight, there will
be only two men who will not be in
I college to compete in the Intercolle
j giate regatta—.l. R. Pemberton, '08,
j and H. E. Stark, '09. Pemberton
i will leave college at the end of the
| present semester on a scientific expe-
I dition, and Stark is no longer in at
| tendance at the University. It is
very probably that R. H. Conant,
'OS, will return to college to com
plete his course and in this event he
will probably take his old position
at stroke.
In addition to these veterans there
will be several others who were in
training last year but did not com
pete against California. Of these,
C. H. Wondries, '09, H. B. Patrick,
'10, R. H. Reynolds, '10, J. W. Fit
ting, '10, and C. H. Vose, '10, by
liard and competent work through
out the period of training, showed
their ability to pull an oar in a Var
sity crew. Patrick showed up es-
I pecially well in competition against
; the University of Washington. The
! position of coxswain will, without
doubt, be filled by F. W. Turner, '08,
j who acquitted himself well as direct
! or of his Freshman crew and the '07
I Varsity.
Probably the greatest element that
| will lend success to the Cardinal
| eight next season will be there-
I turn of "Dan" Murphy to the posi
j tion of coach. Last year Mur
phy developed in his men a stroke
that, though criticized as to correct
form, showed its effectiveness with
out the shadow of a doubt on the
two occasions of competition against
the University of California and the
well-trained oarsmen of Washington.
With a full crew of men to take this
I stroke up again, the development of
the eight should be rapid. Murphy
has the entire confidence and respect
of every man who has worked mith
him, and has much more command
than would be expected from a pro
| fessional coach.
With the appropriation of a suf
| ficient, fund for the permanent re-
I building of the flume, the lake that
has caused so much trouble in the
past can be easily filled in a short j
time, and the shells and barges can
be putin the water for use early i
next semester. This forming of a
good place for practice for the crew :
candidates means much to the sue- :
cess of Stanford this year, for with j
the natural boating facilities possess
ed by the University of Washing
ton, and the new, expensive equip- 1
ment lately installed at. Berkeley,
there is a great handicap to be ov
ercome.
A Tennis Victory Is Uncertain.
The outlook for a victory in tennis
next year is not as bright, perhaps,
as it is in the other three branches
of spring sports. A. J. Gowan,'o9,
T. C. Henry, 10. and P. B. Delano. |
'08, who composed last year's win
ning team, will be on the courts next
semester, and this trio of players will
he strengthened by the addition of
J. F. Cassell, 'OS, a member of the
'O.j, Varsity, and the present holder
of the Thiele trophy.
This advantage, however, will be
more than counterbalanced by the
presence of the Long brothers at
California. Melville Long is ex
champion of the Pacific Coast, and
his brother, Herbert, was at one !

time the holder of the San Francisco
championship. Against these exper
ienced players the Stanford team
could hope for little more than close
matches, with a possible victory in
the doubles.
There is a possibility that Herbert
Long will not return to California.
Should this be the case, the Stanford
men will be confronted by the same
problem which they solved last sem

!<!. Sampson, Shortstop on 13)07 Varsity.


J. O. Miller, Stanford's Veteran Distance Man
; samt'S with California last spring.
He will have a trio of efficient as
sistants in Goodell, who threw his
' arr out just before the opening
match of the Intercollegiate series;
and in Witrner, who was ineligible
during the season of 1907; and in
L. F. Smith.
Nothing definite can be said as
i to who will be behind the bat, but
| it is probable that the burden of the
work will fall upon Ganong, who
j caught two games last March, when
I Stott, Daily, and Presley were all on
the injured list. He proved an ac
ceptable substitute and is sure to
improve with a little more experi
eace. Mitchell, who played on the
1910 nine, may be found available
as a backstop.
A fast and sure infield is a certain
ty. For the fourth successive year,
Fenton will hold down the third
bag. Sampson will again be seen
ai shortstop, while jthere will be
three first-class candidates for sec
ond base: Bell, Scott, and Cadwal
ader, all of whom are varsity veter
ans. li. is not unlikely that the
fghL for this position will center
between Scott and Cadwalader, Bell
being shifted to first. No suitable
successor to Presley has as yet been
found, and as Bel! is a good all
round man, he would undoubtedly
fill the place satisfactorily.
Owen, Wirt, and Gore, the fielders
of last season, seem to have a good
hold on those positions for next
spring. Wirt may leave the Univer
sity at Christmas, however, and it is
possible that Gore may not return.
In this case, Dennis and either Cad
walader or Scott appear as Candi
da tes for the vacancy,
Tiius it is safe to rssume that tin
St nine will once again n« , ;
almost perfect field machine,
it is piobable that t! trc will bo •ho
u-iiul weakness in the batting dt
rirtment, although pi.-sibly nol so
p-otiounced as in former years, ire
loss of Presley, Stott, and Daily is
sure to be felt, but the material
available at present, together with
any that may be developed from the
Freshman Class, will do much to off
set the absence of three such re
liable men.

When Coach Murphy issues his
call, early in the spring semester,
for candidates for the Varsity and
Freshman eights, there will be a
large amount of good crew material
to respond. From the members of
last year's victorious eight, there will
be only two men who will not be in
I college to compete in the Intercolle
j giate regatta—.l. R. Pemberton, '08,
j and H. E. Stark, '09. Pemberton
i will leave college at the end of the
| present semester on a scientific expe-
I dition, and Stark is no longer in at
| tendance at the University. It is
very probably that R. H. Conant,
'OS, will return to college to com
plete his course and in this event he
will probably take his old position
at stroke.
In addition to these veterans there
will be several others who were in
training last year but did not com
pete against California. Of these,
C. H. Wondries, '09, H. B. Patrick,
'10, R. H. Reynolds, '10, J. W. Fit
ting, '10, and C. H. Vose, '10, by
liard and competent work through
out the period of training, showed
their ability to pull an oar in a Var
sity crew. Patrick showed up es-
I pecially well in competition against
; the University of Washington. The
! position of coxswain will, without
doubt, be filled by F. W. Turner, '08,
j who acquitted himself well as direct
! or of his Freshman crew and the '07
I Varsity.
Probably the greatest element that
| will lend success to the Cardinal
| eight next season will be there-
I turn of "Dan" Murphy to the posi
j tion of coach. Last year Mur
phy developed in his men a stroke
that, though criticized as to correct
form, showed its effectiveness with
out the shadow of a doubt on the
two occasions of competition against
the University of California and the
well-trained oarsmen of Washington.
With a full crew of men to take this
I stroke up again, the development of
the eight should be rapid. Murphy
has the entire confidence and respect
of every man who has worked mith
him, and has much more command
than would be expected from a pro
| fessional coach.
With the appropriation of a suf
| ficient, fund for the permanent re-
I building of the flume, the lake that
has caused so much trouble in the
past can be easily filled in a short j
time, and the shells and barges can
be putin the water for use early i
next semester. This forming of a
good place for practice for the crew :
candidates means much to the sue- :
cess of Stanford this year, for with j
the natural boating facilities possess
ed by the University of Washing
ton, and the new, expensive equip- 1
ment lately installed at. Berkeley,
there is a great handicap to be ov
ercome.
A Tennis Victory Is Uncertain.
The outlook for a victory in tennis
next year is not as bright, perhaps,
as it is in the other three branches
of spring sports. A. J. Gowan,'o9,
T. C. Henry, 10. and P. B. Delano. |
'08, who composed last year's win
ning team, will be on the courts next
semester, and this trio of players will
he strengthened by the addition of
J. F. Cassell, 'OS, a member of the
'O.j, Varsity, and the present holder
of the Thiele trophy.
This advantage, however, will be
more than counterbalanced by the
presence of the Long brothers at
California. Melville Long is ex
champion of the Pacific Coast, and
his brother, Herbert, was at one !

time the holder of the San Francisco
championship. Against these exper
ienced players the Stanford team
could hope for little more than close
matches, with a possible victory in
the doubles.
There is a possibility that Herbert
Long will not return to California.
Should this be the case, the Stanford
men will be confronted by the same
problem which they solved last sem
ester, that of defeating a team of
three, one member of which is a
player of unusual brilliance.
Stanford's prospects for a victor
ious spring- in the athletic world are
ol' the best. On the track fourteen
of the point winners of last year
will again compete and many veter
ans of previous years will return. In
baseball Stanford will be represent
ed by practically a veteran team.
Five of the 15)07 varsity crew will re
spond to the call of Coach .Murphy,
and there will he an abundance of
material from which to till the three
remaining seats in the boat. There
are four veteran tennis men from
whom to select a team to meet Cal
ifornia.
Many Veterans on Track and Field.
With the close of fall training the
outlook for a successful track sea
son at Stanford next year may be
considered good, although Trainer
"Dad" Moulton says it will require
plenty of hard work to develop i
winning team and he cannot afford
to lose a single man that he is now
counting upon. At present there are
fourteen athletes in college who
took points in the Intercollegiate
meet which Stanford won last spring
with a total of 65. These men made

4f» points and the eight point-win
ners of last year's team who have
left college were responsible for but
Ifi, which shows that in actual point
winning th« loss has not been heavy.
J. C. MacFarland, '07, captain of the
team last, year, is by far the most se
vere loss, as he made nine points
last spring against. California. The
other varsity men who will not be
here next spring are L. M. Edwards,

'07, C. F. El well, *07,
W. T. McNeil, '07, W.
W. Edwards, '07, G. L.
Aynesworth, 'OS, and R.
S. Worthington, '09. E.
J. Helsley, '10, who took
third in the low hurdles,
is not in college at pre
sent, but is expected to
return in January. The
losses from last year will
be felt most keenly in
the relay and it will be
necessary to develop prac
tically an entire team for
this event next spring.
In the return of H. L.
Horton, '08, the track
'earn will be greatly
strengthened, and he is
looked upon to take the
place of Macfarland in
the hurdles and in addi
tion is a valuable man in
the shot-put. Horton
has not competed in an
Intercollegiate track con
test since his freshman
year, but in that meet
he was a big point-win-

ner and has shown his old-time form
in the fall training. Of the team
last year Captain Lanagan, J. O. Mil-

ler, E. J. Nash, P. M. Da
vis, T. Vandervoort, and
D. P. Crawford are first
place winners who may
be counted upon to help
materially in the contest
next spring. Besides
these first-phice men,
there are such men as C.
P. Bradford, "09, B. L.
Gregg, '09, .T. R. Holman.
'09, C, Coonan, '09, W.
D. Peaslee, '09, 11. E.
Reed, '10. L. Scott, '10,
and H. V. Poor. '10, who
made points in the Inter
collegiate contest last
year and are looked upon
as men who will show
improvement during the
coming season.
There are also several
athletes who competed in
the meet last year and,
although they did not
place then, they are ex
pected to do so in the
next Intercollegiate meet.
Among these are R. A.
Kocher, '08, in the pole-

vault, who made his "S" in 1905, H.
H. Maundrell, '10, P. F. Bradley, '10,
C L. Severy, '08, E. A. McGregor,
'OS, and W. C. Shelton, '08. Another
track man who lias returned to col
lege is S. N. Bellah, '10, and he
will no doubt prove a valuable man
in the pole-vault and hurdles. GS. D.
Hussey, '09, is a fast quarter-miler
who has returned and will run again
next spring.

There has been little opportunity
to judge the 1911 athletes. In the
! two meets that have been held sev
eral Freshmen have shown up well,
particularly W. M. Wyman, in the
j quarter; R. B. Wheeler in the
■ quarter; J. E. Thompson, in the half
| mile; and Herbert. Raines, in the
hurdles and high jump. In addition
to these men there are some other
Freshmen with good preparatory
school records who should develop in
j to varsity material.
Briefly, it may be said that Trainer
, Moulton and Captain Lanagan have
the nucleus of a winning track team
with which to begin the season and
i with the men who will develop, it
seems probable that next year's track
tea mwill be as strong as the winning
aggregation of 1907.
Baseball Outlook Is Bright.
Of the ten men who played on the
varsity baseball team during the
1907 series with California, probab
ly eight will be in college and eli
gible to compete on the 190S nine.
Of the eight, Captain Fenton, Theile,
Scott, Cadwalader, Sampson, Owen
and Wirt are now registered, and
l ight fielder Gore has assured Coach
Presley of his return at the opening
of the spring semester. Further
j more, J. H. Bell, 'OS, u veteran of
| two seasons, will appear on the dia
i mond once again. With such a nu
' cleus of stars to begin with, the
! coining baseball season presages the
! greatest of success.
