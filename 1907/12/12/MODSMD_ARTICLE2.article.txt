## FOOTBALL SUITS TO BE SOLD RUGBY CANDIDATES. Executive Committee to Watch Expenditures.â€”Yearly Contracts for Coaches Will Be Drawn. 
### 
Steps were taken last night by the
Executive Committee of the Associ
ated Students in special session to
curtail wasteful expenditures con
nected with the football season.
The drain on the Student Body re
sources due to the annual loss of
valuable football equipment and the
seemingly exorbitant amount ex
pended for medical treatment were
the objective points of the legisla
tion of the committee.
Hereafter it will be necessary for
every candidate for the Varsity or
Freshman teams other than old var
sity men to provide their own suits.
The entire outfits will be given out
by the Graduate Manager as form
erly, but will be sold to the candi
dates for half their value. Shoes
and other articles will be sold at
the same rate to candidates. It is
estimated this will mean a saving
of some $.")0 0 yearly.
Doctor bills will only be paid
when accompanied by a written or
der from Trainer Moulton. This will
eliminate the expenses consider
ably.
The contracts for Coaches Presley
and Fenton will be drawn up by
Graduate Manager Knupp. Presley
is to receive $1,500 for the season,
and Fenton $1,000. Knupp is also
intrusted with the negotiations rela
tive to securing the services of
Coach Lanagan in an advisory ca
pacity.
