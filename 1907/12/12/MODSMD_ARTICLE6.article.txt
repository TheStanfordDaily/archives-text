The action taken by the Executive
Committee last night providing that
in the future all football men ex
cept those who have played on Var
sity teams shall be required to buy
their suits at the beginning of every
season will putin force a rule
which should have been enacted
long ago, but.is none the less wel
come because it is late. At the
close of every season the Graduate
Manager finds himself some hund
reds of dollars out for suits and all
he has to show for this expenditure
is a miscellaneous collection of foot
ball apparel which was not consid
ered of enough value to be appro
priated along with the rest. A large
proportion of the men who report
for football leave the squad before
the end of the season and the turn- !
ing in of suits is no longer the cus- |
torn. The protests of the manager j
are generally met with the state- j
ment that the articles have been j
worn out or returned while he was |
away. The new rule is a just one, i
and will stop one of the many leaks J
which aid so materially in deplet- j
ing the treasury.
