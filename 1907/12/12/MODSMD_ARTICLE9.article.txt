### 
At the final meeting ot' the Social
Service Club for the semester, held
in the Chapel yesterday evening,
Professor A. C. Whitaker, of the
Economics department, explained the
tightness 111 the money market in a
forceful address, taking as his sub- â– 
ject. "The Banks, the Stock Market, i
and the Present Financial Stringen
cy." He showed at length how the
deplorable conditions existing in
Wall Street necessarily lead to tem
porary disturbances in the business j
world. Professor Whitaker traced
the present uneasiness to the inti
mate relations of the banks to the i
stock market in New York City, as
a result of which the national banks
throughout the country have been
unable to withdraw their currency
deposits. The requirements of the Na- (
lional Banking Act tend to mass these j
deposits in Wall Street, thus making
financial conditions unduly depend
net on the stock market. The speak
er characterized the present lapse in
our prosperity as a mere stock mar
ket flurry and prophesied that it
would be of short duration.
