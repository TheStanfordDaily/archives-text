# PLAN SUCCESSFUL TOUR
## COMBINED CLUBS LEAVE CAMPUS ON THURSDAY NEXT. Many Entertainments Planned for the Visitors by Stanford Clubs of Northern Cities. 
### 
On December the twentieth, the
Stanford Combined Musical Clubs
will start on the longest trip ever
taken bv these organizations. Their
tour covers practically the entire ter
ritory from San Francisco to Van
couver and in all of the principal
towns along the route, concerts will
be given. Although the last part
of the trip will cover the towns of
British Columbia where the varsity
football team will be playing at that
time, the itinerary of the two or
ganizations are unfortunately so ar
ranged that, they will not meet on
the entire trip.
According to reports from the
northern cities, great preparations
are being made by the Stanford clubs
in that region for the entertainment
of the visitors and a very enjoyable
trip will probably be the result. Ad
vance agent, C. L. Roberts, left the
Campus on Wednesday to bill all the
towns as far as Chico, so that, their
coming will be well advertised in
advance. When the clubs leave the
Campus, Roberts will start, directly
for Chico, and thus will travel the
entire route several days "ahead of
them.
A very attractive program has
been arranged for the concerts and
although the principal features are
made up of many selections of the
more classical variety, the clubs are
prepared to give popular medleys for
encores and thus vary the nature of
their repertoire. A new feature will
be introduced this year that should
prove quite a success. Beginning
with the Chico concert, the club will
appear in the first part of their pro
gram in a scene representing a typi
cal college room and the costumes
will represent the daily dress of a
crowd of college students. A few
lines will lie interpolated into the
scene and the entire effect, will be
that of a short sketch, rather than
a concert. The second part of the
program will not be altered and the
clubs will appear in full dress as has
formerly been the custom.
The entire number of men who
will make the trip will be thirty,
aiul Hie personnel of the clubs will
be as follows: Mandolin Club:
