# Prize Offered For Play Manuscript.
## 
### 
At the Junior Class meeting this
afternoon it was voted that $75
should be offered as a prize to the
author of the best manuscript for
the Junior Play to be given next
spring. The committee in charge,
however, retains the privilege of re
jecting all manuscripts, and, in case
it so desires, will present some stan
dard light comedy. The prize .was
offered this semester in order to aid
the committee in getting an early
start on the play. The manuscript
will be due the first part of next
semester.
The committee appointed to con
fer with the Senior Class in regard
to the purchase of the Senior Circus
equipment has as yet been unable
to make the necessary arrangements.
