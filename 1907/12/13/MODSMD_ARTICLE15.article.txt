# NEW STANFORD FICTION
## CLEVER STORIES OF COLLEGE LIFE APPEAR WEDNESDAY. "Not Included In a Sheepskin" Is Title of Book By Three Stanford Women. 
### 
"Not Included in a Sheepskin" is
the title of a new book of Stanford
stories that will be published dur
ing the coming week. The final work
is now being done by the printers
in San Francisco, and the volume
will be in the hands of the Stanford
Book Store next Wednesday. The au
thors of the bobk are Miss D. C.
French, '08, Miss Esther Stevens,'o9,
and Miss L. Wells, ex-'O9. Though
Stanford is now in its seventeenth
year, this is but the second book
of fiction, dealing directly with
the life of the college, that
has been written by Stanford stu
dents or graduates. The first was
the "Stanford Stories" of Charles
K. Field, '95, and William H. Ir
win, '99, which is now a Stanford
classic. The newest effort, "Not. In
cluded in a Sheepskin," while writ
ten probably from a somewhat dif
ferent viewpoint, has elements of
novelty that promise for it a large
measure of success.
In a brief foreword the authors
make this explanation of their work:
"This book does not aspire to por
tray Stanford life in its entirety, nor
does it seek to justify many phases
of undergraduate activity. It de
fends itself only in the light of a
personal interpretation of several
years' connection with things."
And that tells the idea of the book.
The authors have had no theories to
work out and no sharpened hatchets
to use. Taking three girls at the
beginning of their college careers,
they have used them in the creation
of stories that deal with almost ev
ery phase of college life. There is
a sorority rushing story that, beyond
the amusing features, has in it a
deal of pathos. The summer school
furnishes a basis for another tale,
and in a third an interesting yarn
is spun about the handling of the
"preps" at the interscholastic meet.
Politics, of course—ever an interest
ing subject for the collegian—are
not forgotten. Roble, too, the cen
ter of so many good stories, most
of them unpublished, does not es
cape this time, and to the uninitiated
a liberal education is offered anent
life in the hall that lies on the side
lines of the University. The pelican
and the dig, and the Senior Prom,
each find their department in the
volume. There is a football story:
not the usual kind there no bleach*
ers, jammed with yelling collegians

and hysterical maids, for the au
thors have not seen tit to play the
game before the reader's eyes. And,
finally, there is a story developing
out of the earthquake, the great dis
aster that bore so heavily on the
red-tiled principality, and yet left its
citizens more firmly welded, and
pulling stronger than ever. In ail,
.'there are nine stories, making a
volume of some 250 pages.
The three co-editors of the book
are well known at Stanford for their
literary work and other activities.
All have been frequent contributors
to the Sequoia, and Miss French and
Miss Wells were formerly associate
editors of that journal. Both were
also members of the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto. Miss Wells is pres
ident of the English Club, in which
position she succeeded Miss French.
Miss Stevens' activities have been
purely confined to writing. All are
members of the Alpha Phi sorority.
