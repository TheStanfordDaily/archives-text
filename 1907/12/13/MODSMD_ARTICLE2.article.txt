# Varsity and Vancouver To Battle In the North
## Cardinal Fifteen Will Play Series of Games For Possession of Cooper-Keith Championship Trophy. 
### 
On the twentieth ul' this month the
varsity fifteen will leave the Uni
versity on the second annual Christ
mas trip to Vancouver. The team
j will be away during the entire vaca
tion, and during that time will play
four games, all with the Rugby fif
teen of Vancouver. The series will
carry with it the championship of
the Pacific Coast, and the winners
will receive the handsome J. Cooper-
I Keith trophy.
Although the Cardinal will battle
four limes with the Canadians, the
possession of the valuable cup will
be decided by the result of the first
three games, which will be played
in Vancouver on December 25 and
29, and January 1. The fourth, in
Victoria, will be merely an exhibi
tion contest and will take place on
January 4. The proposed game with
a picked Portland fifteen, which E.
P. Stott, ex-'O7, intended to raise and
captain, has been cancelled by Mana
ger K nu pp.
The Varsity will be in excellent
condition for the matches in the
North. The men have been working
hard and faithfully since Thanksgiv
ing, and the game with the Barbar
ians demonstrated that they were
fast regaining their usual speed and
brilliancy. Although they look for
ward to four gruelling contests with
the British Columbia champions,
they thoroughly expect to be return
ed the victors.
The Cardinal will be represented
by a strong aggregation. Only one
possible change may occur in the
line-up, as announced several days
ago. A .sudden illness may prevent
Owen from accompanying the team,
and in this event Cook would take
| bis place ;it wing 1 hree-quarter. Who
would then be the fifth substitute
| is a. matter of doubt. It is possi
j ble that the coaches would not fill
J the vacancy, but would send only
i nineteen players on the journey.
Otherwise, the fifteen will be the
| some as that which met. the Barbar
ians last Saturday. Thus, the team
will include the seven forwards who
j played against California, and this
unity in the scrum should be a
powerful factor against the excep
tionally heavy and aggressive north
j ern pack. As Cook, through his
steady fighting, pressed the Cardinal
wings hard for a position on the
j Varsity, his presence in the three-
I quarter line will not in the least les
! sen the efficient combination of the
backfield. Brown and C. Pemberton
| are also first-class substitutes for the
j varsity full and wing forward, res-
I pectively.
The fifteen, as it will face Van
couver, follows—Koerner, Rhyne,
Minturn, Crawford, J. R. Pemberton,
Thorpe, Miller, forwards; C. Pem
berton, wing forward; Fenton, half;

Mitchell, Ganong, fives, Vandervoort,
center; Holman, and Owen or Cook,
wings; Brown, full. Substitutes—
Terrill, Reynolds, Heinly, Vail.
Manager R. P. Woodward, of the
British Columbia team, writes that
great interest is being manifested in
the coming series and that upon
reaching Vancouver, the Cardinal
representatives will find a much wor
thier foe than they twice defeated
on Stanford Field about six weeks
ago. Woodward states further that
the Northerners are determined not
to allow the Cooper-Keith trophy to
be brought south, and that they are
putting forth every effort to retain
possession of the handsome gift.
The only loss suffered by the Can
adians since the games on the Cam
pus is through the return to Aus
tralia of C. Simpson, the clever
wing.
The varsity squad, accompanied
by Coach Presley, and Manager
Knupp, will leave Palo Alto late
in the afternoon of next. Friday, tak
ing the S:2O boat that evening from
San Francisco. Sunday morning will
find them in Portland, where they
intend to remain all of that day, de
parting at. midnight for Seattle. The
next, evening the Stanford men will
leave on the "Princess Victoria," ar
riving at their final destination by
noon of the twenty-fourth. While
in Vancouver, their headquarters
will be the Hotel St. Francis. The
Rugby enthusiasts in Vancouver
have planned to entertain the visit
ors royally during their ten days'
stay, even to outdo the exceptional
hospitality accorded to the Cardinal
team a year ago.
On January :!, the opposing fif
teens will go to Victoria to play
their exhibition game. Immediate
ly after this final battle, the Varsity
will leave for the University. It. is
expected that, the Campus will be
reached on Registration day, Janu
ary 7.
