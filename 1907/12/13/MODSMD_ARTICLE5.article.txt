Friday evening, December 20, at 8,
and will be upon the same subject
as the dissertations, "The Ethics of
Racial and National Exclusiveness."
The delay in announcing the suc
cessful contestants was due to the
fact that one of the judges was com
pelled to act. as an election official
in San Francisco and was for that
reason unable to review the disserta-
I tions and decide upon their relative
merits until a few days ago. The
judges who made the award are:
Reverend W. E. Guthrie, pastor of
the first Presbyterian Church of San
Francisco; Professor H. W. Stuart,
of the Philosophy department, and
( harles Murdock, of San Francisco.
The judges for the discussion have
not. yet been appointed.
