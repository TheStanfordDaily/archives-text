Following the custom of previous
years, the Daily Palo Alto will not
be published during examination
week. In this, the last issue for the
present semester, the editor desires
to make acknowledgement of the
faithful and efficient service which
has been so freely given by the as
sociate and assistant staffs and which
is responsible for any success which
the paper may have attained. The
innovation of printing in Palo Alto
has done much to increase the dif
ficulties of the men who collect the
news and the unselfish manner in
which they have stood by the paper
is worthy of a greater recognition
than ordinarily falls to their lot. The
relations of the editorial depart
ment with the Student Body and
Stanford organizations have without
exception been most cordial and the
present editor steps from bis posi
tion with sincere regret.
Mr. Fitch, who succeeds to the
editorial position, needs no intro
duction to Stanford journalists or
the Student. Body at large. His
long connection with the Daily Palo
Alto and his wide experience in met
ropolitan newspaper work insures a
Daily next semester which will be
strong in influence and broad in
scope.
