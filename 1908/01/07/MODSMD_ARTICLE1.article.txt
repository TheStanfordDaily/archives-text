# MURPHY SERIOUSLY ILL
## ROWING COACH IS NOT ABLE TO ASSUME HIS DUTIES. Several Crew Men Will Be Unable To Compete, and Prospects Are Not Bright. 
### 
From the manner in which cir
cumstances governing the boating
prospects have developed lately, it
would appear that the Stanford oars
men will have to put forth their
strongest, efforts this semester to suc
cessfully compete with California
and Washington.
The greatest set-hack is the ex
tended illness of Coach "Dan" Mur
phy, who was considered well on the
road to recovery at the close of last
semester. The coach had successful
ly passed through a very trying op
eration but in a stage of convales
ence was attacked by typhoid fever
and is only now regaining his
strength for the second time. A
movement is now on foot to remove
him from the San Francisco hospi
tal to the Guild Hospital in Palo
Alto, where he might lie more in
touch with the crew during the early
part of the training season. Under
the most favorable circumstances, his
convalescence will probably be very
slow, and the physicians now in
charge state that it will be a matter
of weeks before Murphy will be
strong enough to take charge of the
men at the boat house.
On account of scholarship deficien
cies three of the most promising can
didates will be unable to appear in
their rowing suits this season. In ad
dition to these, it is understood that
R. H. Conant, '08, who was expect
ed to return to college this semester,
has changed his plans and will not be
present.
Captain L. R. Gay, '08, will not
register until the middle of January
and during his absence the prelimin
ary work of the crew will probably
be carried on under the direction of
F. W. Turner, 'OS, who will return
with the Glee and Mandolin Clubs
from their northern tour in a few
days. G. E. Dole, formerly of the
class of 1907, and a member of his
class crew, has returned to college
and will probably come out for the
varsity crew.
