# LARGE NUMBER DROPPED
## NINETY-EIGHT STUDENTS DISMISSED FROM UNIVERSITY. Prominent Men Fall Under Ban of Committee.â€”Few Women Among Number. 
### 
The Scholarship Committee, after
receiving all reports for last semes
ter, has suspended or dropped nine
ty-eight students from the University
as compared with eighty-eight one
year ago. Of this number ninety
five were men, while only three were
women, showing a decrease of seven
among the latter over the figures
of 190G. The number of dismissed
students is the largest in many years.
Aside from those dropped, forty-five
students were permitted to pursue
their studies on strict probation, only
seven of these being women.
The statistics for the various de
partments have not been compiled
and none will be available for sever
al days. In dropping such a large
number of students, the Committee
is pursuing the settled policy of rais
ing the standard of scholarship.
The action of the Committee in
thus stringently enforcing scholar
ship requirements will be far-reach
ing in its effects, as many men prom
inently identified with college affairs
were forced to retire from college.
The Committee met yesterday to
consider petitions and special cases
brought to its attention. However,
it is unlikely that many of the for
mer decisions will be reversed.
