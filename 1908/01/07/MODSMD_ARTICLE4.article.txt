# Varsity Team Loses to Vancouver and Victoria
## Cardinal Defeated in Three of the Four Rugby Battles--the Northerners Capture Cooper-Keith Trophy. 
### 
Of jthe four Rugby games played
by the Stanford varsity fifteen in the
Xorih during the holidays, three
were captured by the opposing teams.
By reason of their victory in the
hard-fought series the Vancouver
players gained possession of the
beautiful trophy offered to the win-
Tier by J. Cooper-Keith. Although
defeated, the Cardinal battled game
ly and struggled in every match
against discouraging odds. The wet
and slippery field which character
ized all four of the contests worked
great hardships on the Stanford
backs and prevented any display ot
their wonderful scoring ability. Nev
ertheless, what would have resulted
on a fast, dry gridiron is merely a
matter of conjecture. The Northern
ers fully earned their three victories.
Vancouver won the first game,
which was played on Christmas day,
by a tally of 3 to 0, and Stanford
captured the second contest, which
canie three days later, by the sam<
score. The final match of the ser
ies on New Year's Day, was lost by
the Cardinal 9 to 5. The result of
the only game with Victoria, which
took place on January 4, was a 12
to 3 defeat.
The initial battle with Vancouver,
although played on an extremely
sloppy field, was, to quote a north
| ern paper, an exhibition of "Rugby
1 quite up to the standard of an av
| erage Welsh or New Zealand club."
The Vancouver team succeeded in
scoring the only points of the game
only after seventy-five minutes of
fierce fighting. Then Fyson, the
five-eighth, covered the last fifteen
yards for a try.
Stanford threatened the opposing
goal several times during the game,
but lost many excellent chances to
score by a tendency to bold the ball
too long. The closeness of (ho strug
gle is evidenced by a remark of a
Northern Rugby enthusiast thai
there was so little to choose between
the two teams that a draw would
have been far more satisfactory. For
the Cardinal, Vandervoort, Holman,
Kenton, and Crawford showed up
prominently.
Three days afterward on the same
mud-covered field the Cardinal turn
ed the tables on Vancouver. This
game was just as even and desper
ately contested as the first, had been,
and the extremely clever work of
the varsity scrum decided the result
in favor of Stanford. During the
latter part of the first, half the for
wards rushed the pigskin dangerous
ly near the goal-line, where Vander
voort secured and scored. Fenton's
successful conversion was disquali
fied because the ball had not touched
the ground. Throughout the remain
der of the match Vancouver contin
ued to force the play near the Car

dinal line, and tlie Varsity had to
touch down three times during the
last, few minutes of the game. The
Northerners, however, failed to score,
and the final pistol found the score
3 to 0.
This was the most terrific and bit
terly contested encounter of the ser
ies, and kept the huge crowd in a
state of constant enthusiasm from
start to finish. Churton, the Van
couver half, Vandervoort, and Brown
played brilliant Rugby, earning con
tinued applause.
The final game, upon which de
pended the possession of the Cooper-
Keith trophy, was played in a down
pour of rain, and the Northerners
had comparatively little difficulty in
winning. The score of 9 to 3 is some
what, misleading as to the relative
merits of the playing of the two con
testing teams, as Vancouver crossed
the Cardinal line three times, while
the Varsity tallied but a single try.
The forwards of the British Colum
bia fifteen were in a large measure
responsible for the victory of their
team, displaying magnificent foot
work and following up abilities.
Stanford's try was made on a spec
tacular passing rush by Vandervoort
and Reed, who had replaced Cook
at wing. Fenton successfully con
verted.
Although the result was not long
in doubt, it was a whirl-wind battle
throughout, and the Cardinal fifteen
fought hard until the final call of
time. The match was distinctly a
forwards' struggle, and the North
erners easily excelled.
The scene of the game was
changed from Recreation Park to
Brockton Point, where the rain had
made relatively little impressio" on
the turf field. This was done in or
der to give the Stanford backs "
opportunity to display their wtil
known form. The ball, howev< \ sel
dom reached the backfield, which
was able to accomplish little.
With the exception of the substi
tution of Heed for Cook in the third
game, no changes were made in the
Cardinal fifteen during the series.
The line-up follows: Koerner, Rhyne,
Minturn, Pemberton, Miller, Thorpe,
Crawford, forwards: Fenton, half:,
Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Vandervoort,
center; Holman, Cook, Reed, wings;
Brown, full.
Following are the players who
were in the line-up of the Vancouver
fifteen during the series: Bryant,
Shearer, Loftus, Dunn, Springer,
Burke, Thomas, Ellis, Smith, Harris,
Scott, Davis, forwards; Churton.
half; Fyson, Ellis, Bell-Irving, fives;
Marpole, center; Young, Brydone-
Jack, Flood, Bull, wings; Spencer,
full.
J. Jenkinson, who refereed the
r resnman ana varsity Intercollegi
ate games during the past season,
officiated in that capacity through
out the series, and gave eminent sat
istaction.
The match with Victoria was play
ed in a heavy wind which rendered
good Rugby an impossibility. The
Varsity was outplayed both forward
and back, and made a weak show
ing. It was evident that the three
hard games with Vancouver during
the previous ten days had deprived
the Cardinal players of much of their
vim and dash. The first half, dur
ing which Stanford worked hard
against the wind, ended with the
score 9 to 0 in favor of the oppon
ents. Each fifteen tallied a try in
the second period, but the driving
wind made goal-kicking very uncer
tain.
Despite the inclemency of the
weather, large and enthusiastic
crowds attended all the games. Tho
third contest with Vancouver was
witnessed by SOOO people, the largest
number in the history of British Col- I
umbia.
Throughout their stay in the north
the Stanford men were generously
entertained and treated with the
greatest hospitality. Every moment
of their time was provided for, and
many receptions and banquets were
tendered the visitors.
