# PLAY CAST IS SELECTED
## CHARACTERS FOR SOPHOMORE COMEDY ARE CHOSEN. Coach Cross Will Have Entire Charge of the Production.—Munier Not to Return. 
### 
The cast of characters who will
take part in the Sophomore Comedy,
"The Manoeuvers of Jane," has been
announced by Coach Cross and work
will begin at once. The first rehear
sal will be held tomorrow and pre
parations for the staging of the play
will be hastened as much as possible.
The first act was worked over sev
eral times before the vacation so that
the time this semester will be devot
ed to the latter part of the comedy.
It is the intention of the committee
to stage the production about the
middle of February, but no .definite
date has been set and the time will
depend entirely upon the progress
made in training the cast.
F. F. Munier, '10, who was en
gaged as assistant coach and later
left college after undergoing an op
eration for appendicitis, will not re
turn to the University this semester,
so that the work of cozening the cast
will devolve entirely upon 1. B. Cross,
of the Economies department.

the play committee is as follows:
