Although the Stanford team was
defeated in the championship series
with Vancouver, winning one game
and losing two, the team made a
good showing under the circum
stances. The Northerners had a par
ticularly strong aggregation and
Stanford did well to make the con
tests as close as t.hey were. It i* a
marked disadvantage for a team to
play on a strange field after a long
flip and the weather conditions were
hard on the Cardinal's fast backs.
However, the series no doubt did

much to increase the knowledge of
the Rugby same and this is a most
important result. The team was roy
ally entertained by the Vancouver
players and the good feeling that al
ready exists between Stanford and
Vancouver has been materially
strengthened.
The unfortunate illness of Coach
Presley is the one incident that mars
a successful trip. He is being well
taken care of in Vancouver and has
the hearty wish of the Student Body
for a speedy recovery.
