# TO BEGIN TRACK WORK
## RALLY WILL BE HELD AT END OF NEXT WEEK. "Dad" Moulton Has Severe Cold But Hopes To Take Charge Before Friday. 
### 
The track season, will be formally
opened by a big rally some time
within the next two weeks, probab
ly a week from Saturday. Several
men are already doing light work
and many others are planning
to begin regular work next week.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton is at pre
sent confined to his bed with a se
vere cold which for a time threaten
ed pneumonia. But he is now rap
idly recovering and expects to be able
to get out before the end of the week.
He will be at the track Saturday and
! every day next week and is desirous
of having as many men as possible
get out for work before the regular
training season begins.
In speaking of the outlook for the
coming season "Dad" was neither
discouraged nor especially optimistic,
when he said: "Our prospects this
year are not especially brilliant, but
they might be much worse. We have
only a few men to start with, but
they are good ones who have been
| tried and we know that they can be
relied upon. But then, we have to
win that meet, and we are going to
dt it, too."
Y>n account of the fact that much
of Trainer ivxoulton's time will have
to be devoted to the development of
new material, he has arranged to
have some of the older men assist
iii the regular work. Crawford, Hor
ton, Davis, and Captain Lanagan will
spend considerable time on the tracl:
i:i an attempt to relieve "Dad" from
some of the routine tasks of coach
ing.
