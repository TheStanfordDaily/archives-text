# BUILDINGS UNDER WAY
## METALLURGY FURNACE ROOM NEARLY COMPLETED. A 						Reinforced Concrete Building Is Being Constructed For Machine Shop. 
### 
Two new structures on the Cam
pus are now in course of construction
and will probably be completed and
ready for use some time this semes
te™. Construction on the new metal
lurgy furnace room, which is now
being built as an addition to the Me
chanical Engineering building, is ra
pidly nearing completion. The fur
nace room is at the present time in
the regular metallurgy building on
the inner quadrangle and it has been
for some time the desire of the
Board of Trustees to have this de
partment change its location. The
purpose of this change is to do away
with the use,of fire on the Quadran
gle. On this account the Metallur
gy department will be moved some
time in the near future.
The new structure will be tire
proof and well equipped. In addi
tion to this, a new one-story rein
forced concrete building is being
added to the old machine shop. This
addition will make the capacity of
the machine shop much larger, and
it should be completed near the close
of this semester.
