# PLAN TRACK BLEACHERS
## LACK FUNDS PREVENT ST OF WORK. Hoard of Control Is Awaiting Financial Support From the Student Body. 
### 
In preparation for the'first varsity
intercollegiate track be held
on the Stanford spring,
the Board of Control is considering
ways and means for increasing the
I seating facilities at the new track.
At present the bleachers at the track
would not accommodate the large
crowd that is expected on April 18.
Dr. Frank Angel 1, of the Board of
Control, states that work on the new
! bleachers cannot begin until money
is secured from the Student Body
treasury. And as yet no definite plan
has been arranged for the construc
tion of the additional track bleachers.
The seating capacity of the bleach
ers now built is 2500, and it. is the
intention of the Board to double this
by erecting duplicate bleachers di
rectly across the oval from the pres
ent stand. The plans for this work
nre completed but the lack of funds
prevents the Board from taking steps
toward actual construction. This fi
nancial embarrassment, is increased
by the present stringency in the mon
ey market, which makfes it impossi
ble to borrow money for the work.
The Board of Control is now car
rying a debt of over one thousand
dollars, secured by personal notes of
certain members, and will be unable
to proceed with the matter, unless
funds are secured from the Student
Body in some manner.
The cost of the bleachers already
j constructed was in the neighbor
hood of $2700, but as the price of
i lumber is steadily decreasing, it is
j probable that the proposed work
â€¢would cost, about $2500.
