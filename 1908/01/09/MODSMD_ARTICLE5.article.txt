# MUSICAL CLUBS ARRIVE
## STEAMER UMATILLA BRINGS MEN FROM VANCOUVER. Stanford Alumni Entertain Clubs at Many Places During the Journey. 
### 
At noon today the Combined Mu
sical Clubs arrived on the Campus [
after an eventful voyage from Van
couver on the steamer Umatilla.
The Clubs left the Campus on the
last day of the semester and gave
their first concert at Alameda, where
they were given a dinner and dance
by a friend of the University. While
making their tour in the North, the.
Clubs were given much attention and
highly entertained by former Stan- j
ford people.
At Eugene, Ore., the members of
the Clubs were received by the stu- |
dents of the University of Oregon,
who were very hospitable, entertain
ing them at the different fraternity
houses and giving them a dinner.
From this point, Manager Turner
found the Oregon Glee Club preced
ing him with concerts, and this
greatly reduced the size of the
houses that attended the concerts of
the Stanford Clubs.
"diet" Murphy, '00, a well-known
' varsity football player, met the men
jat Salem, and entertained them in
company with the other Stanford re-
I sidents.
At Portland the entertainment giv
]en the Combined Clubs surpassed
anything on the trip. The men were
! royally entertained by the parents
of Stanford men residing there. The
I Multonomah Club extended all privi-
I leges to those on the trip, and the
| University Club gave them a smoker.
Seattle was the next stop, and
while there the Clubs were the
j guests of the University ol' Washing
ton. They were given a dance after
the concert. A smoker and jinks
were given on Xew Year's Eve. On
the first they proceeded to Tacoma,
Victoria, and Vancouver. At Van
couver they were given box seats to
j "Strong Heart," by Ralph Stewart,
, the leading man.
Sunday, January r>. the Clubs left
j Vancouver on the steamer Umatilla
for San Francisco, which met with
j much trouble, arriving a day late.
('. L. Roberts, '09, is at present in
San Francisco, making arrangements
for a performance on January 17,
|to l><> followed by an appearance
here the next night.
Financially the trip of the Com
bined Musical Clubs was not a suc
cess. At the present time
figures cannot ho i
: the management states that
cert in San Francisco and that in
j Assembly Hall should net enough to
I remove the deficit.
