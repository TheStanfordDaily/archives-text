In another column of this paper
there appears a preliminary schedule
of baseball games and track meets
which luvve been arranged by the
Graduate Manager. As the list now
appears it is one of the most com
plete schedules that has been pro
vided for any spring semester, and
Manager Knupp is to be congratu
lated. The lack of track meets with,
strong teams from other universi
ties or clubs has been a source of
complaint at various times in the
past. This season there is no danger
of such criticism and there is every
prospect for a most successful track
season. Since the management has
secured the meets, it is the duty of
the Student Body to show its appre
ciation by supporting the team and
attending the contests.
