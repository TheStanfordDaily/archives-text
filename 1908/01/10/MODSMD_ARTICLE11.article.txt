The fact that the number of men
who have signified their intention of
entering the Carnot tryouts is al
most double that of last year, indi
cates that there is a strong interest
in debating among the men now in
college. This situation should be
gratifying to the entire Student
Body, as the Carnot debate is a
contest of importance and the medal
cannot be won by a Stanford man
unless there is a severe preliminary
competition for places on the Cardi
nal team. It is in this tryout, where
different phases of the general topic
are discussed, that the men are thor
oughly prepared for the important
contest with the California debaters.
As there are few veteran debat
ers in college this semester, it is
to be hoped that the present good
start in preparation for the Carnot
contest will be maintained. If a
large number of men enter the try
outs, and competition for the team
is spirited, there is no reason why a
Stanford man should not again bring
the Carnot medal to our Campus.
