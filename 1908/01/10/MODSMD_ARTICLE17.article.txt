# EXAMINATION DATE SET
## RHODES CANDIDATES MEET ON JANUARY 21 AND 22. Holder of Scholarship from California Will Be Chosen by the Last of March. 
### 
The Rhodes scholarship examin
ation will be held simultaneously at
the University of California, Stan
ford, and Occidental College, on Jan
uary 21 and 22. The examination
here will be held in the office of the
Greek department, room 25, and will
probably be under the supervision of
Professor A. T. Murray.
At present only two students have
signified their intention of taking the
examination, but it is probable that
there are others who will desire to
do so.
The schedule of examinations is as
follows: Tuesday, January 21, 9
to 11 a. m., translation from Latin
into English; 112 to 3 p. m., Latin
prose composition; 4 to 6 p. m., ar
ithmetic. Wednesday, January 22,
9 to 11 a. m., translation from Greek
to English; 1 to 2 p. m., Latin gram-j
mar; 2:10 to 3:10 p. m., Greek prose '
composition; 4 to 6 p. m., either al
gebra or geometry, as the candi
date may desire.
Immediately after the examination, !
papers will be sent to Oxford, and
the university authorities there will
notify the California committee as
to those who passed. The commit
tee, consisting of President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, President Jordan, and
Dean Norton, of Pomona, will then
appoint the holder of the scholar
ship. This will be completed before
the end of March, and the appointee
will enter upon his residence at Ox
ford in October, when the universi
ty year commences.
This examination is merely the or
dinary entrance examination of Ox
ford. The standing which contest
ants make in it has very little to do
with their receiving a scholarship,
as the committee only wants to be
certain that any man whom they
might appoint would not be refused
admission to Oxford on account of
deficient preparation for entrance.
In making the selection of Rhodes
scholars, the committee is guided
largely by the mental and moral
qualities of the candidates, their pro
ficiency in athletics, and similar con
siderations.
