ture of the meeting will be a lecture
by Dr. James W. Strong, president
of Carleton College, on "Robert
Hrowning and his wife, Elizabeth
Barret Browning."
Dr. Strong was for many years
the intimate friend and associate of
Browning, and he is in a position to
give a most interesting account of
the famous poet. Dr. Strong is
thought to be the only American
now living who had such an oppor
tunity for personal acquaintance with
the great poet.
