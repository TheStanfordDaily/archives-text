# TO HOLD CARNOT TRYOUT
## JANUARY 22 IS THE DATE SET FOR CONTEST. Thirteen Debaters Have Already Entered the Competition for Places on the Team. 
### 
The tryout for places ou the Car
not, team will be held in the Uni
versity Chapel on Wednesday, Jan
uary 22. Owing to the fact that
only a comparatively small number
of men have signified their inten
tion of trying for the team, it has
been decided to omit the prelimin
ary tryouts which have been held
in the past. Up to the present thir
teen men have handed in their names
for the tryout, but this list may be
considerably augmented within the
next few days. These men have been
working steadily in preparation for
the debate during the holidays. The
contest for the Carnot medal itself
will take place February 7, at the
University of California, leaving a
little over two weeks after the try
out in which the Cardinal represen
liitives must prepare their final ar
guments.
"France and Morocco," the general
subject from which this year's spe
cific question will be selected, is a
: particularly timely one, as at pres
ent it is the most important of the
1 problems confronting the French
government. Since the Algeciras
Conference the attention of the civ
ilized nations has been focused up
>ll this country, and France and Spain
have been given the duty of patrol
ling this troublesome nation. As a
result, the magazines and newspa
pers have recently been filled with
articles bearing upon the Carnot
question. The specific topic for the
[ tryouts will be selected from this
general field by a committee of three
faculty members, two hours before
the time set for the beginning of the
tryout. President Reilly, of the Tn
tersociety Debating League, has not
yet announced the personnel of this
committee.
The tryout will be conducted un
der the same regulations which will
govern the actual debate. Each as
pirant. for the team will be allowed
tw< nty minutes in which to present
his argument. This time may, be
divided by encli speaker as he
chooses, provided that in each lit- oc
cupies the floor at least four min
utes. After the specific question has
been announced, the participants in
the tryout will have the privilege of
choosing the side which they desire
to uphold.
The following men have entered
the tryouts: W. C. Shelton, '08, R.
