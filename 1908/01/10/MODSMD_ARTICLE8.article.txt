# RUGBY WITH AUSTRALIA
## NEW SOUTH WALES WANTS GAMES WITH CARDINAL. Representative Fifteen, Now in British Isles, May Return Home Through United States.

"If our team visiting Britain re
tain via 'Frisco, wire matches,
terms, and probable receipts.
New South Wales Rugby Union."
The above is a copy of a telegram
from Sydney, which Dr. Jordan re
ceived this morning. The team men
tioned is the New South Wales rep
resentative fifteen, which is just con
cluding a series of matches in the
British Isles and will soon return
to Australia.
When asked regarding the feasi
bility of Ihe proposed games with
the New South Wales aggregation,
Dr. Angell said: "The contests
should by all means he arranged if
possible, but there are several things
which must be taken into consider
ation. We could undoubtedly put
a strong fifteen in the field with
little difficulty, and I think that all
the players would be in favor of the
series, but, of course, we will have
to await the return of Koerner,
Penton, and the other Rugby men
who have not yet returned. It may
be objected that the matches would
interfere too largely with track and
baseball, but as I understand it, the
games would be finished within a
month, and by thai time neither
track nor baseball will have begun
in real earnest. The whole matter
finally comes down to one of fi
nances, and we have no idea as to
the amount that the visitors would
require as a guarantee. As we are
now pretty far in debt, we could
not promise much, but I have little
doubt that with the co-operation of
Vancouver we could meet, all neces
sary expenses.
Lastly, such a series would great
ly strengthen the Rugby game here
on the Coast, and this benefit should
not be underestimated. Every ef
fort should be made to arrange some
matches with the Australians, be
fore the idea is given up."
Manager Knupp did not. look with
favor on the proposed contests. He
thinks that they would be impossi
ble because of the fact that many
varsity men would then be partici
pating in other branches of athlet
ics, which should not be allowed to
suffer through the interference
which would necessarily follow.
