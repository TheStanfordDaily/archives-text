The serious illness of Coach Dan
Murphy may have caused some mem
bers of the Student Body to look up
on the rowing prospects as rather
gloomy. Those who have taken this
view of the situation will be par
ticularly pleased to learn that Coach
Murphy is rapidly recovering, and
the entire Student Body should be in
terested in the announcement that
the oarsmen will begin work tomor
row.
Although Stanford has lost sever
al valuable oarsmen this year, the
season will start with the nucleus of
a strong varsity crew. As rowing
has been recently placed upon an
intercollegiate basis, it is a sport that
should be strongly supported by the
Student Body. This is especially true
in regard to the members of the
Freshman class, as a crew must bo
developed from among the first-year
men to meet the California Fresh
men. Consequently, it is the duty of
every Freshman who has had any
previous experience in rowing, or is
physically qualified for the sport, to
come out for this branch of athletics.
