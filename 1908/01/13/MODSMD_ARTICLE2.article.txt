# DATE SET FOR RALLY
## TRACK SEASON WILL OPEN ON THURSDAY NIGHT. Trainer Moulton Wants Men To Begin Active Training at Once. 
### 
The date of the track rally has
been definitely fixed and the season
of 1 908 will be formally opened by a
mass meeting in Encina club room at
7 : 0 Thursday evening. All candi
dates will sign up at this time, al
though training rules will not go in
to effect until next Monday. The
complete program for the rally has
not been arranged, but Captain Lan
agan and Trainer "Dad" Moulton will
address the men on the prospects for
the coming season.
Although the track season does
not formally begin until next, Monday
when strict training rules go into
effect, Trainer Moulton is desirous
of having as many men as possible
come out for work at once. In this
regard "Dad" said: There is such a
short time remaining before our first
outside meet that. I want as many
men as I can get to train regularly
this week. If we should happen to
I have a wet, spring which would hin-
I der our training, wo would be hard
j pressed for time to get into shape
for the meet with the athletes rrom
Southern California, where they al
ready are in condition and can train
every day."
For the first time since his recent
iliness, Moulton was able to come
out to the track this afternoon,
wnere a number of men are already
working regularly. Nash, Miller,
Horton, Maundrell, Both, Martin and
several others have begun their sea
sou's training and are at the track
â€¢ every afternoon.
The track is in fair shape but will
need a good coating of cinders before
it is in condition to stand the wear
of the training season and the hard
spring rains.
