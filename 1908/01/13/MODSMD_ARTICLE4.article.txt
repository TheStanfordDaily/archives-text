# CONCERT ON JANUARY 18
## COMBINED CLUBS TO APPEAR IN ASSEMBLY HALL. The
						Same Program Will Be Rendered Which Was Given During the Tour. 
### 
The Combined Musical Clubs,
which have recently returned from
their northern tour, will give a con
cert in Assembly Hall on Saturday
night, January 1S.
The clubs received many flatter
ing notices during their trip, among
them that in the Portland "Oregon
ian," which said in part:
"The Stanford talent which ap
peared at the Heilig last night gave
an entertainment which should get
them enough credits to pass, if the
local public had its way about it. It
was a joy to listen to the really ex
cellent voices and the certainly well
played stringed instruments. The
comedians, Kellogg, Bernard and
Bradford, did some genuinely funny
'Stunts' and the soloists acquitted
themselves well. Kellogg is un
doubtedly one of the cleverest ama
teurs ever seen here, and with his
contagious merriment he fascinated
' the audience from the very start.
Bradford and Bernard are equally
as clever and taking all in all they
itre a good team. Of the vocal num
bers, the quartette singing was ex
cellent, while 'Mrs. Cosy's boarding
house' was well done. The mando
lins rendered 'The Wedding of the
: Winds' and the 'Carmela Waltzes'
' well enough to suit exacting tastes.
I The rendition of the 'Sextette from
! Lucia' deserves special notice."
The clubs give a good entertain-
I ment throughout and one worthy of
the patronage of the university pub
1 lie. The seat sale commences Thurs
day ii I the Bookstore and the Uni
; versity Drug Store in Palo Alto.
A concert will also be given on
I Friday night, January 17, at the St.
: Francis Hotel in San Francisco.
