# CLUB QUARTERS SECURED
## SAN FRANCISCO ALUMNI WILL LEASE ROOMS. Satisfactory Arrangements Made For Location in Central Part, of the City. 
### 
Alter two busy weeks of hustling
names and addresses of prospective
members, drafting by-laws, canvass
ing the city for the most accessible
and desirable quarters and attend
ing to many minor details, the board
of control of the Stanford Club of
San Francisco, at its meeting .Mon
day, decided to incorporate immed
iately and to take a year's lease on
a set of rooms on tlu* fourth floor of
u new live-story, white glazed brick
building on Hush street, just above
Kearny, opposite where the Cali
fornia Hotel stood.
The top floor will be permanently
occupied by the San Francisco Press
Club, and the ground floor by the
Bergez and Frank restaurant, a com
bination of two noted Pine-street
restaurants with the old Poodle Dog
Restaurant. The famous caterers of
the days before the fire will main
tain a dumb-waiter service to the
Press Club and the Stanford Club,
thus relieving the dub' of any finan
cial obligations on the problem of
cuisine, as each order will be cash
down from the one ordering. The
owner of the building has given as
surances that the remaining floors
will not be used for lodgings, a con
sideration which at once removes
any objection which might attach to
such close proximity to a "French
restaurant." The restauranteurs
have already signified their willing
ness to supply a low-price commer
cial lunch for members in the club
rooms.
There will be about 133 square
feet of 1 .-shape floor space, about 30
x 2 0 on each flunk of the southeast
corner of the building. The build
ing is to be lighted by electricity,
heated by steam, and equipped with
electric elevators, which will run late
enough for the Press Club, which is
always a late bird.
Partitions art; to be omitted, and
the room tinted and wainscoted high
to suit the club, which has deter
mined to start with a piano, a pool
table, a writing table, card tables,
(but no gambling), and to get all
its initial and augmented furnishings
through personal contributions from
individual members or classes who
may care to give Stanford pictures,
books, publications, and anything
else that will tend to make the
quarters attractive to Stanford men.
Already, just as the board has pre
pared to start the regular canvass
for members, there are forty-four
resident and three non-resident
members who have paid the admis
sion fee and a month's dues in ad
vance, and within a week it is ex
pected that there will be fully 100
paid-up members on the charter list,
which is to he kept open till Febru
