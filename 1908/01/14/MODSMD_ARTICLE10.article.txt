The board of control of the Stan
ford Club of San Francisco is to be
congratulated upon having secured
such satisfactory quarters in the city.
This is the first step toward estab
lishing permanent headquarters in
San Francisco where all Stanford
men may gather, and where iflie
alumni and undergraduates will have
an opportunity to "get together" and
strengthen the bonds of Stanford
loyalty.
