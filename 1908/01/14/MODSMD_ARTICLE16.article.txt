# NO BASEBALL ON TURF.
## Stanford Field May Be Ready For Intercollegiate Game.â€”Practice To Begin Monday. 
### 
Although the Student Body man
agement had planned to have Stan
ford Field in suitable condition for a
diamond in time for the commence
ment of baseball practice, work has
been delayed so long as to render
this impossible. It is hoped, howev
er, that the intercollegiate contest
with California, which will take
place on the Campus early in April,
may be played on the turf, and Man
ager Knupp will make every attempt
to get the field in proper shape.
Baseball practice will begin on the
campus diamond next Monday after
noon, and will continue daily there
after under the direction of Captain
Fenton. Favorable word has been
received from Coach Presley, and it
is expected that he will be able to
resume his duties at the expiration
of two or three weeks.
