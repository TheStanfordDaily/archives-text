# DISTANCE MEN MAY RUN
## ATHLETES MAY ENTER TWO-MILE OLYMPIC RACE. Pacific Athletic Association May Hold Two Meets on Local Track. 
### 
Track Captain Lanagan is in re
ceipt of a letter from Manager Mick
ey, ex-'OS, of the Olympic Club ath
| letic teams, inquiring about the pos- j
! nihility of a Stanford team entering
the annual Olympic Club two-mile j
race, which will be held in Golden j
! Gate Park on Washington's birth- I
day. This event is a team race, each
team entering seven men, the first
five men on each team counting in
'the score.
There is an unusual amount of
j good material in college this semes
| ter, and several of the men have ex
j pressed a willingness to compete if
j there was a Stanford team entered in
the contest. The decision in the
I matter will rest, entirely with the
men interested in the event, and
| will probably be postponed until
training is well under way in order
1 to determine the advisability of en
: tering such a contest, with but short
time to get into condition.
Hlckey is also desirous of having
some Stanford entries in the five-
I mile cross-country race held under
j the Pacific Athletic Association, over
1 the Park course on Sunday, March
jl. However, as this date is only
1 six days before the first meet with
: the University of Southern Califor
; nia, it is not probable that any Car
idinal runners will care to enter.
i
It. is possible that the Olympian
I tryouts for the American team to
compete at London in .luly will be
held on the Stanford track on May
ft. The matter lies between Stan
ford and California, and will be de
cided at. a meeting of the directors
of the Pacific Athletic Association to
j be held in San Francisco tonight.
It is now almost certain that the
[annual P. A. A. meet will be run on
the Stanford track, but the date is
i still undecided, and may be definitely
1 determined at the meeting of the
directors tonight.
