# KOERNER HAS ARRIVED
## FOOTBALL CAPTAIN RETURNS FROM THE NORTH. He Is in Favor of Game With New South Wales if Players Want It. 
### 
Captain W. Koerner arrived on the j
Campus at noon today, having come
direct from Vancouver. He was with j
Coach Presley until last Thursday, !
and he reports him as doing as well |
as could be expected and receiving j
the best of care.
As regards the proposed series of !
Rugby games with the New South
Wales fifteen, Koerner said: "That is j
a matter that should be referred to !
the players themselves, and if they
avor the proposition, the matches
should by all means be arranged, if
j possible." Koerner did not disclose
j his views on the subject.
The Rugby captain states that the
i northern trip of the varsity fifteen
was both very successful and higl.»y
j enjoyable. He says that the games
i with Vancouver are among the best
| in which he has ever played. Koer
j tier especially praises the splendid
i hospitality of the northerners. And
i in connection with this splendid en-
I tertainment received during the trip
i and the impression made by r the team
i while in the North, the following
' from the Vancouver "Daily Prov
ince" is interesting;
"Now that it. is all over and the
j cheers have died away, and the Van
; couver Rugby Union has had a nice
I case made for the Keith Cup, we can
look back and say with truth that
| the series have been really magnifi
cent games. Every match has been
fast and full of soul-stirring inci
dents, and, although the laurels of
victory are with Vancouver, yet the
I Stanford team has left, the impressoin
| that on a dry ground they could do
a great amount of havoc."
In commenting upon the depart
ure of the Cardinal team the same
paper had the following to say:
"Handshakes and cheers showed that
there was genuine regret at the de
parture of such a fine lot. of fellows,
and the Stanford visit of this sea
son can be put down as the greatest
possible success. They have strength
ened the bonds between North and
(South, and they have l done a won
derful amount, of good for the game.
Next year we will see new faces in
the Cardinal ranks, and to those
' who are leaving the alma mater,
I Vancouver wishes to say, Good luck;
j may you always play the game of
| life as you have played Rugby—like
sportsmen and gentlemen."
