# TENNIS OUTLOOK FAIR
## AT LEAST TWO OF LAST YEAR'S VETERANS WILL PLAY. Gowan and Delano Will Be Stanford's Strongest Representatives on Courts This Season. 
### 
The prospects for a winning team
in the intercollegiate tennis matches
with the University of California
next April are not as encouraging
as they were the latter part of last
year. The members of last year's
team, P. B. Delano, '08, A. J. Gowan,
'09, and T. C. Henry, '10, are still
in college, but there is some doubt as
to whether Henry will play tennis
this semester. With two of the three
men that played on the 1907 team,
should Henry not play, and fairly
good material among the other play
ers, Stanford may hope to have al
most strong a team as that of last
year. From present indications it is
almost certain that P. R Delano, '08,
and A. J. Gowan, '09, will consti
tute the doubles team. In the sin
gles, A. .1. Gowan will, in all probab
ility, be first, singles man. Another
man who should make a strong bid
for a place on the team is G. E. Dole,
'OS, who played strong tennis while
a member of the 1907 class team. H.
Mann, '09 is a consistent player
whose chances should not be under
estimated. One of the most promis
ing Freshmen whose chances for
making the varsity team are bright
is E. Kobbe, who played on the
Freshman doubles team last semes
ter.
The prospects of a winning team
are nui <iTsw„ rfl gi n g j n so f ar as ma _
terial is available, tunusually
strong material at California w ni
force Stanford to work hard for a
victory. M. Long, a former Coast
champion, and H. Long, an ex-San
Francisco champion, will in all prob
ability represent the Blue and Gold.
A senior doubles tournament will
be commenced in the near future,
and five or six teams have expressed
their desire to enter. The interclase
doubles from last semester will be
played off immediately, and then the
men will practice regularly for the
try-out for places on the intercol
legiate team.
