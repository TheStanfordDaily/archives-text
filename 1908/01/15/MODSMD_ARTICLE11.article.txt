not present at the first meeting of
the oarsmen.

year men of the Blue and Gold in the
last intercollegiate regatta, will also

A strong addition to the rowing
squad is H. L. Horton, '08, the crack
hurdler and weight man. There are
also several others "who were mem
bers of the rowing squad last season.
More men signed up this after
noon. when work was started under
the direction of the older oarsmen
who have had experience at the Uni
versity. The first training consisted
of calisthenics and running. Work

within a few days, when they will
be ready for use.

the Guild Hospital within the next
few days. F. W. Turner, '08, and
the older men of the crew will then
be enabled to confer daily with the
coach. Captain L. 11. Gay, '08, will
arrive from Honolulu in a few days,
