The system on the avenue will be
underground, ornamental poles will
bo used to support the lights. There
may also be some lights suspended

of Oakland, who is to install the sys
tem, has inspected the entire route of
the proposed work with S. B. Char
ters, of the Electrical Engineering
department, and is prepared to start
the work as soon as the proposed
route is approved by the university
