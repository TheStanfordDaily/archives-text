# WITHDRAWS FROM GUILD
## MISS M.L. SQUIRES, '07, TENDERS RESIGNATION TO BOARD. Applications For Reduction of Fixed Medical Rates Denied by Governing Body. 
### 
The first regular meeting of the
Guild Board for the semester was
held at the Guild Hospital yesterday
afternoon. Two members of the
board, G. J. Presley, '07, and Miss M.
L. Squires, '07, were unable to be in
attendance. The resignation of Miss
Squires from the board was tendered
and accepted. Her successor will pro
bably be named at the next meeting
of the Executive Committee. Miss
Squires has graduated and will leave
the University.
The reports of the various stand
ing committees were received and
showed the hospital to be in excel
lent condition, despite the heavy
drain on the finances of the institu
tion resulting from the large num
ber of improvements now being j
made. Medical attention was given
to forty-six patients during the month
ending December 31.
Receipts and expenses during that
period amounted to $824.54 and
$1261.07 respectively, leaving a defi
cit of $436.25 for the month. The i
management committee was author
ized to pay bills aggregating $4385,
the larger portion of this sum being
for payments on recently purchased
property, building contracts and fur
niture.
Numerous letters asking for reduc
tion of the hospital rates were read.
It was the decision of the board that
all of these applications be denied.
