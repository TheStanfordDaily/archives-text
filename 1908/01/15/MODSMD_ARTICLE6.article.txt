# Board of Control Will Meet.
## 
### 
The Board of Control will meet to
morrow evening to consider ways and
means of raising money to provide
the new bleachers for the track.
Besides the consideration of secur
ing funds for this project, there are
several other matters to come be
fore the attention of the board at
this meeting. The matter of filling
in the gap in the football bleachers
with a duplicate training house will
probably come up for discussion, bui
it is not expected that any immed
iate action will be taken.
