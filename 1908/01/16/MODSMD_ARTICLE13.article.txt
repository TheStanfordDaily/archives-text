# TO PLAY LACROSSE HERE.
## Equipments for the Game Have Been Ordered and Will Arrive Soon. 
### 
Equipment for the installation of
a lacrosse set has been ordered in
the Easl from A. G. Spalding &
Bros, bv Director Long- of the En
cina Gymnasium, and is expected to
arrive some time next week. The
purchase of the lacrosse set was
brought about because it is the de
sire of Director Long to have a lar
ger variety of methods for giving
his class exercise. The game will be
played only in connection with the
sections that take regular gymnasi
um work and will not be developed
as an intercollegiate contest.
Lacrosse is considered one of the
best methods for physical training.
The game is simple in its design and
free from technicalities. It requires
no brute force, but merely skill,
speed and endurance. The game is
played in two halves of thirty to
forty-five minutes each, and each
team consists of twelve men. The
game will be played on the ball field
and on the old track.
