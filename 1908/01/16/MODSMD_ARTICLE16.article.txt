# AMENDS IMPORTANT RULE
## COLLEGE athletes affected BY ACTION OF A. A. U. During Summer Vacation University Students May Participate In Certain Club Contests. 
### 
The Amateur Athletic Union has
just passed an amendment to its reg
istration rule,- which will prove of
importance to all college athletes, as
it. allows them to participate on cer
tain club teams during the summer
vacation. The amendment, in its en
tirety, follows:
"A student attending a universi
ty, college, school or other educa
tional institution may consider such
institution his residence for the pur
pose of registration, to represent
such institution in competition. Such
student during the period between
the close and opening of the scholas
tic: year, may transfer his registra
tion to a club or other organization
belonging to an active or allied mem
ber of the Amateur Athletic Union,
located in the district of his actual
residence, which for this purpose,
shall be the residence of his par
ents or guardian if he be a minor,
or his last place of abode before en
tering his educational institution if
he be an adult, and upon the opening
of the scholastic year he may be re
traiioferred to his educational insti
tution."
Although this gives the sanction
of the A. A. U. to those who take
part in such contests as are mention- !
ed, the undergraduates of Stanford
and California will still be effectual
ly bound in certain cases by the j
stringent rules of the Intercollegiate !
Agreement, which restricts especially
the summer activities of the base
ball candidates.
