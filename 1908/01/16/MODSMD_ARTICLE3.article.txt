# Bentley Makes a Strong Speech
## President of San Francisco Chamber of Commerce Praises Work of Rudolph Spreckels. 
### 
President Charles H. Bentley, Of
the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, and Benjamin Weed, ano
ther business man of the metropolis
and a graduate of the University
of California, were the speakers at
the first regular assembly of the
semester held this morning at 10:15
in Assembly Hall. The gathering
was one of the best held in some
time and the feature of the occasion
was the strong speech of President
Bentley in upholding the graft pro
secution and Rudolph Spreckels of
San Francisco. His praise of the
graft eliminators was received with
cheering. Bentley also gave an in
teresting address upon commercial
life and drew a sharp comparison
between the methods followed by the
British and American men of com
merce.
Benjamin Weed, who was intro
duced by Dr. Jordan as "the distin
guished archeologist who had un
earthed a famous old Greek theatre
at Berkeley," gave an interesting pa
per on advice to undergraduates, the
theme of which was to make an ear
ly choice of one's life work.
President Bentley said in part as
follows:
"The extraordinary commercial
development of the past generation
has brought new conditions and new
problems, perhaps requiring men of
greater ability 'in commercial life
than heretofore. Our industrial
troubles have come naturally and
more frequently as men tare em
ployed in larger groups, where the
personal relation of the employer
disappears. Another change has
come in the growth of the large cor
porations controlled by hoards of
directors who no longer feel that
sense of responsibility and personal
honor in the conduct of business.
They often consent, to do things as
directors which they would have op
posed had it been an old-time busi
ness owned individually. There is
the need of men who are familiar
with the history and significance of
the labor movement, with the de
velopment of the wage system and
the general science of economics.
These are offered here under favor
able and exceptional conditions."
Speaking of the British and Am
erican merchants he said:
"The successful man in America is
dead or a nervous wreck at. the age
of 55, while in England the heads
of the institutions in active control
are in many cases over 70 years of
age and, indeed, in two cases T found
men over SO years of age in actiVe
command getting comfort, and en
joyment out of life as they went
along. As Stevenson puts it,"The

typical business man sows hurries
and reaps indigestion. He puts a
vast deal of activity out at interest
and receives a large measure of ner
vous derangement in return."
"1 have been attempting to discuss
the college man in business from a
merely selfish material point of view,
and 1 shall not venture upon the
higher or better considerations of
morals, of your duty and of your
happiness, all of which has a dis
tinct bearng on a business career,
although the business considerations
are, of course, of minor importance.
I know full well that you are pe
culiarly fortunate in having the best
of thought on these higher questions
but I may be pardoned in view of
the really alarming conditions pre
vailing in our state and more partic
ularly in San Francisco, if T remind
you that even from the material
point of view, honest, free govern
ment, is essential to the general
business progress and every business
man should bear his part in promot
ing such conditions. President Roose
velt has told us that, there are men
who do not divide actions into those
that are honest and those that are
not, but create a third subdivision
of law honesty—that kind of honesty
which consists in keeping out of jail.
This feeling presents one of the grav
est dangers to our institutions, and
lawyers who show men how they
may do wrong things and escape the
law are certainly traitors to the
state. Our universities have a heavy
responsibility in this connection, for
they dn not discharge their duty to
the state unless their students leave
tliem with that public spirit, which
brings them cheerfully to sacrifice
their persona] comfort for the wel
fare of the community and state.
The learned man without work is
likened to the bee without honey.
"San Francisco is torn with the
dissension of the present time. A
large and influential element of the
business community with many of
the large firms of attorneys, are cry
ing that the prosecution is hurting
llie town, they are tired of it all,
that it had better lie stopped. Many
go further and attempt to throw
discredit on the one man who has
proven himself able and willing to
turn tlie foul brood out of office.
They stultify themselves by ascrib
ing selfish motives to a truly great
and good citizen who lias sacrificed
his time, his personal comfort, his
personal safety, for the public good.
1 refer to Mr. Rudolph Spreckels.
God grant that. Stanford University
may send out more and more men
who will catch some of his spirit,
who will stand cheerfully and unself
ishly for the public welfare. God
grant, that she may send out enlight
ened, trained legislators, to make
better laws, better judges to inter
pret. them, true officers to execute
them."

per on advice to undergraduates, the
theme of which was to make an ear
ly choice of one's life work.
President Bentley said in part as
follows:
"The extraordinary commercial
development of the past generation
has brought new conditions and new
problems, perhaps requiring men of
greater ability 'in commercial life
than heretofore. Our industrial
troubles have come naturally and
more frequently as men tare em
ployed in larger groups, where the
personal relation of the employer
disappears. Another change has
come in the growth of the large cor
porations controlled by hoards of
directors who no longer feel that
sense of responsibility and personal
honor in the conduct of business.
They often consent, to do things as
directors which they would have op
posed had it been an old-time busi
ness owned individually. There is
the need of men who are familiar
with the history and significance of
the labor movement, with the de
velopment of the wage system and
the general science of economics.
These are offered here under favor
able and exceptional conditions."
Speaking of the British and Am
erican merchants he said:
"The successful man in America is
dead or a nervous wreck at. the age
of 55, while in England the heads
of the institutions in active control
are in many cases over 70 years of
age and, indeed, in two cases T found
men over SO years of age in actiVe
command getting comfort, and en
joyment out of life as they went
along. As Stevenson puts it,"The

typical business man sows hurries
and reaps indigestion. He puts a
vast deal of activity out at interest
and receives a large measure of ner
vous derangement in return."
"1 have been attempting to discuss
the college man in business from a
merely selfish material point of view,
and 1 shall not venture upon the
higher or better considerations of
morals, of your duty and of your
happiness, all of which has a dis
tinct bearng on a business career,
although the business considerations
are, of course, of minor importance.
I know full well that you are pe
culiarly fortunate in having the best
of thought on these higher questions
but I may be pardoned in view of
the really alarming conditions pre
vailing in our state and more partic
ularly in San Francisco, if T remind
you that even from the material
point of view, honest, free govern
ment, is essential to the general
business progress and every business
man should bear his part in promot
ing such conditions. President Roose
velt has told us that, there are men
who do not divide actions into those
that are honest and those that are
not, but create a third subdivision
of law honesty—that kind of honesty
which consists in keeping out of jail.
This feeling presents one of the grav
est dangers to our institutions, and
lawyers who show men how they
may do wrong things and escape the
law are certainly traitors to the
state. Our universities have a heavy
responsibility in this connection, for
they dn not discharge their duty to
the state unless their students leave
tliem with that public spirit, which
brings them cheerfully to sacrifice
their persona] comfort for the wel
fare of the community and state.
The learned man without work is
likened to the bee without honey.
"San Francisco is torn with the
dissension of the present time. A
large and influential element of the
business community with many of
the large firms of attorneys, are cry
ing that the prosecution is hurting
llie town, they are tired of it all,
that it had better lie stopped. Many
go further and attempt to throw
discredit on the one man who has
proven himself able and willing to
turn tlie foul brood out of office.
They stultify themselves by ascrib
ing selfish motives to a truly great
and good citizen who lias sacrificed
his time, his personal comfort, his
personal safety, for the public good.
1 refer to Mr. Rudolph Spreckels.
God grant that. Stanford University
may send out more and more men
who will catch some of his spirit,
who will stand cheerfully and unself
ishly for the public welfare. God
grant, that she may send out enlight
ened, trained legislators, to make
better laws, better judges to inter
pret. them, true officers to execute
them."
President Charles H. Bentley, Of
the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, and Benjamin Weed, ano
ther business man of the metropolis
and a graduate of the University
of California, were the speakers at
the first regular assembly of the
semester held this morning at 10:15
in Assembly Hall. The gathering
was one of the best held in some
time and the feature of the occasion
was the strong speech of President
Bentley in upholding the graft pro
secution and Rudolph Spreckels of
San Francisco. His praise of the
graft eliminators was received with
cheering. Bentley also gave an in
teresting address upon commercial
life and drew a sharp comparison
between the methods followed by the
British and American men of com
merce.
Benjamin Weed, who was intro
duced by Dr. Jordan as "the distin
