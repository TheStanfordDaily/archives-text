# TO FORM NEW SOCIETY
## STANFORD TO HAVE BRANCH OF INTERNATIONAL CLUB. Doctor Jordan Writes of the History and Aims of Cosmopolitan Organization. 
### 
The following article by Doctor
Jordan explains the aims and pur
poses of the International Club, of
which a Stanford chapter is to be
organized soon. A letter was recent
ly received by the President from
; the Wisconsin chapter inviting Stan
ford to form a local branch of the
organization.
Following is the article by Doc
jtor Jordan:
"The American universities have
long prided themselves on their cos
mopolitan character. Stanford, for
example, has at one time or another
had students from almost every part
of the world, and others, as Har
vard, Columbia and Cornell, cover a
still wider range. On the other
hand it is true that the foreign stu
dents attending these universities
have not availed themselves to the
full of the many advantages to be
gained through the exchange of
knowledge in regard to the customs
and institutions peculiar to their re
spective countries. Nor has the loss
been confined to them alone, for the
great majority of American students
have missed the best opportunity,
next to visiting the various countries
themselves, to become better ac
quainted with some parts of the out
side world, namely, by knowing
those persons who have spent the
greater part of their lives there.
"On view of the need for better
acquaintance, in 190:], certain stu
dents in Wisconsin University or
ganized an International Club, Cor
nell followed the example, organiz
ing a second chapter in 1 904. The
, movement has spread rapidly until
today there are chapters formed at
Huenos Ayres, Michigan, Ohio, Illi
nois, and Purdue, while others are
about to be formed at Indiana, lowa,
Minnesota and Princeton.
"The objects of the club are set
forward as follows in the constitu
tion of the Cornell Club: 'To unite
for their mutual benefit, socially and
intellectually, men of all nationali
ties, and to promote the organiza
tion of chapters in other universi
ties in (he I'nited States of America
and in other countries.'
"Provision has been made for the
admittance of a certain number of
American students, such number not
to exceed one-third of the total mem
bership. Members of the faculty are
eligible to membership.
"In a short time a meeting will
be called for the purpose of form
ing a chapter at Stanford. The
prime movers in this matter at Stan
ford are Yamato Ichihashi, of Japan,
J. Garfield Bayley, of Australia, and
Peter Soo-Hoo, of China. The move
ment deserves encouragement for it
is in the line of the development of
Stanford as a cosmopolitan univer
sity.
