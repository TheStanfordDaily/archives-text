In another column there appears
an interesting article by President
Jordan upon the aims and import
ance of the International Clubs,
which have already been formed in
several of the leading American uni
versities. These organizations are
composed of students in the univer
sities who register from foreign coun
tries and there are also a certain
number of American student mem
bers and faculty men. Such an or
ganization as this can do a great
deal toward bringing the foreign
members of a university community
into closer touch with one another,
and also in aiding them to make the
most of their opportunities while in
this country. That such a club is to
be formed at Stanford, as a chapter
of the national association, is a fact
that should arouse the interest of
the Student Body, and thf project
ors of the plan are deserving of suc
cess in their efforts to establish an
organization of this kind at Stan
ford.
