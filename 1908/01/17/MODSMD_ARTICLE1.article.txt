# MORE MONEY IS NEEDED
## POPULAR SUBSCRIPTION FOR TRACK BLEACHERS. Two Important Changes In the Intercollegiate Agreement Have Been Proposed. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students decided at a
meeting held last night to attempt
to raise sufficient money by subscrip
tion from the undergraduates to de
fray the expense of erecting new
bleachers for the track, which will
be necessary to accommodate the
crowds on the day of the intercol
legiate meet with th Diversity of
California. ter heaung a report
from the members of the Board of
Control it was found that this man
ner of raising money was the only
possible one under the circumstances
and President A. A. Murphy was in
structed to appoint a committee of
collectors of representative students.
He will appoint the collectors early
next week.
The Executive Committe decided
upon two changes in the Intercolleg
iate Athletic Agreement which will
be proposed at the coming session of
the representatives of the two uni
versities Saturday night, Janu
ary 25. The proposed changes deal
with the list of entries for the inter
collegiate track meet and the clause
concerning the eligibility of athletes
transferring from other universities.
The changes if adopted will limit the
number of men to five who can be
entered in each event, from each uni
versity instead of the eight now al
lowed. This will make a full track
team number sixty-nine men.
The other change makes it possi
ble for an athlete who has been in at
tendance at, another university to
participate here without having been
a resident for one year, provided he
bus been out of the last university
attended, for one year, working at
some occupation.
The vacancy caused by the failure
of P. M. Davis, 'OS, to register this
semester was filled last night by J.
F. Reilly, '08, who was the unani
mous choice of the committee for
the position.
