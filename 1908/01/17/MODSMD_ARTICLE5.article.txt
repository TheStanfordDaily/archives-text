# BIG CONCERT TOMORROW
## GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS' ONLY APPEARANCE. Performance in Assembly Hall With Concert in San Jose Completes the Season's Work. 
### 
The Combined Musical Clubs give
their return concert at 8:15 tomor
row night in Assembly Hall. This
concert will in all probability be
the last appearance of the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs on the Campus this
semester. It is quite likely that the
clubs will be disbanded after a con
cert which is to be given in the Vic
tory Theatre at San Jose in the near
future.
The program for tomorrow night
is the same one that the clubs have
used on their northern tour and has
been well received at many places.
The "specialties" put on by Ber
nard, Kellogg, and Bradford are ex
ceedingly clever and surpass the ef
forts of any student comedians of
recent years. People who have
seen the funny men of many of the
Eastern universities expressed an
opinion that the '"stunts" put on by
the Stanford trio were equal to any
thing done by any college comed
ians.
The Mandolin Club received much
praise from the Northern newspa
pers for the professional way in
which they interpreted their music.
The Glee Club was also praised, for
their work has improved very much
since last semester.
The price of tickets for tomorrow
night's concert is fifty, seventy-five
