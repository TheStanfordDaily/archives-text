The fact that Mayor Parkinson or
any of his friends in Palo Alto
should have "invited" the students
of the University to take part in the
affair at Mullen's Hall last night
does not appear to excuse the men
who accepted this opportunity to
participate in an event which certain
ly reflected no credit upon them as
members of the Stanford Stu
dent Body. This meeting last night
had been advertised as an op
en lecture a<t which Mr. E.
P. E. Troy, a San Francisco art
torney, was to criticise the Palo Al
to authorities for their lax methods
in the management of the municipal
light, and water system. Such a
meeting as this would not have at
tracted a great deal of interest
among the students under ordinary
conditions. But the hand-bills dis
tributed on Ihe Campus yesterday af
ternoon asking the students to at
tend the meeting and "back up" the
administration seem to have had the
desired effect. Aiul as a result the
University has suffered an unplea
sant amount of notoriety that was
absolutely unnecessary.
The question as to exactly how the
trouble started is not really a ma
terial point, because by sending out
such an invitation as appeared on
the handbills, the students were ask
ed to place themselves in a position
where they might expect to encoun
ter trouble. We do not believe that
the municipal affairs of Palo Alto
have such a vital interest to Stan
ford men as to warrant the partici
pation in an event such as took place
last night. Nor do we see the slight
est justification for the appeal, of
either Mayor Parkinson or any of
his friends, to Stanford men for sup
port. in such an affair. This was a
matter strictly of interest to cit
izens of Palo Alto and there is abso

lutely no excuse for this method of
encouraging students to take part in
a demonstration, and then casting
the discredit upon them.
