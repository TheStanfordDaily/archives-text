# CAPTAIN GAY RETURNS
## TAKES IMMEDIATE CHARGE OF THE CREW CANDIDATES. Oarsmen Will Not Go To Redwood City For Some Weeks Yet.-Lake May Be Filled Soon. 
### 
L. It. (Jay, '0!>, Captain of tlie var
sity ci'exv, returned to tlie Campus
yesterday afternoon after a six
weeks' trip to Hawaii. Almost all
of Cay's time, which was divided be
tween business and pleasure, was
spent oil the Island of Kaui, where
he visited members of his family.
(Jay saw the crew squad for the first
time this afternoon and took charge
of the training of the men until the
arrival of Coach Murphy.
Captain Gay said this afternoon:
"I understand that the preliminary
training of the men has been well
started. When the repairs on the
flume are completed it will take only
a week nt the most for the lake to
fill if there is enough water in the
dam. There is a good head of water
to tap, so that we shall probably be
able to put the boats in the lake
some time next, week.
"Until the squad is reduced in
size, which will not lie for some
weeks, all our work on the water
will be done on Lagunita. The men
who show ui) best in the preliminary
rowing will go to Redwood City to
row later in the season."
The rowing machines now in En
oina Gymnasium will be moved to
the boat house as soon as arrange
ments can be made with the Busi
ness Office. After permission to
transfer the machines has been re
ceived by the Boat Club, they can
be installed in a few days. Presi
dent Turner, of the club, is now ne
gotiating for the removal of the ma
chines.
Turner went to San Francisco late
this afternoon to see Coach Murphy
in the hope that the coach will be
able to come to the Campus this
week. Boating will receive another
impetus with the arrival of the vet
eran oarsman, who, among other
things will have considerable influ
( nee in determining the size of the
intercollegiate Freshman crew.
There luis been some discussion
among the men most, vitally inter
ested in rowing of having an eight
oared Freshman crew instead of a
four. At the last meeting the Exec
utive' Committee instructed the
members of the Intercollegiate
Agreement. Committee, which will
meet in San Francisco next Satur
day evening, to recommend that the
determination of the size of the crew
be left to the discretion of the grad
uate managers of the two universi
ties.
