In view of the fact that Stanford
has already sent one Rhodes scholar
to Oxford and that the examinations
for another representative from this
state have been announced for to
morrow, it is a matter of interest
to the community to learn of the
following remarkable statement in
the Cornell "Sun," which is attribu
ted to an Oxford professor, writing
to a member of the Cornell faculty:
"The English Oxford men barely tol
erate the Rhodes scholars —they can
not wear a scholar's gown but only
the gown of a commoner, because
they are not university scholars. The
American scholars are an especial
thorn in the llesh, as they think that
Oxford needs improving if they are
• o get anything.
"To the real Oxford man the on
ly reason for tolerating them is that
they can be made useful for winning
games against Cambridge."
No doubt the above statement is
an extreme view on the situation,
but there must be some basis for so
radical an utterance, it. is probab
ly true that the English students
have had occasion to resent the at
titude of some of the Rhodes schol
ars who have gone to Oxford, but as
far as the large majority is concern
ed it does not seem that they could
be as unwelcome as the above quo
tation would make us believe. In
an article to the "Sequoia" last se
mester, Hugh Moran, the Stanford
man who went to Oxford, has the
following to say in regard to the
situation of the Rhodes scholars at
Oxford: "Much has been written of
the joys of Oxford, and the accounts
have seldom been exaggerated. We
Rhodes scholars have that, enjoy
ment to the full, by reason of our
being Rhodes scholars. We are ex
tremely well received, a reception
which is improved by any success
in athletics or college life we may
gain
This statement gives an entirely
different opinion of the conditions
at Oxford, and one which we are na

turally more willing to accept, in
view of the fact that other Rhodes
scholars have written articles to the
effect that they were well received
at the great English university.
