# THE 						MIRACLES OF JESUS.
## Dr. Gardner Delivers an Interesting and Instructive Sermon Upon This Topic. 
### 
At the regular services iu the
Chapel on Sunday morning Rev. D.
Charles Gardner delivered an able
sermon upon "The Miracles of Je
sus."
The preacher prefaced his sermon
by remarking that the subject was
one which stirred the critical blood,
that miracles had been for two cen
turies the chosen battle ground be
tween the two forces warring under
the names "Religion" and "Science."
Dr. Gardner pleaded for courtesy in
debate.
He said of the New Testament
stories of miracles that making all
allowance for the simplicity of
thought in that age; recognizing the
oriental character of the environ
ment of the gospel story; granting
the probability of exaggeration in
works of Jesus, the fact remains that,
miracle is inextricably bound up
with the life of Christ.
He then defined miracles and said
that while once regarded as the
great bulwark of the Christian faith,
miracles are now regarded as its
greatest burden.
The reason for this, he said, is
that we live in ;i scientific age, and
science teaches the rigid uniformity
of the laws of nature. The healing
miracles are now generally accept
ed. The nature miracles are reject
ed. The preacher quoted Huxley,
who said that no conceivable event,
however extraordinary, is impossible,
and concluded that miracles are "ex
tremely wonderful events waiting to
be placed in their order in nature."
Christ used miracles as signs. They
were signs of love and power. Christ
came to save men's minds and bodies
as well as their souls. Salvation
means moral and spiritual good
health, but before the gospel could
reach His hearers their vices and
ignorance and superstitions must
be removed.
