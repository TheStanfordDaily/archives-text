# SELECT VARSITY SQUAD
## FOURTEEN MEN CHOSEN FROM BASEBALL CANDIDATES. Coach Lanagan and Captain Fenton Supervise Work at First Practice Of the Season. 
### 
Fourteen men have been chosen
from the large number of baseball
candidates by Coach Lanagan and
Captain Fenton to comprise the var
sity squad. They are Theile, Wit
iner, Goodell, pitchers; Ganong, Mit
chell, lint lodge, catchers; Ball, Mc-
Gregor, first, base; Bell, second base;
Fenton, third base; Sampson, short
stop; Owen, left field; Scott, center
field; Cadwalader, right field, it is
probable that nearly all of these men
will be played in the game with St.
Mary's next Saturday afternoon, and
a number of substitutes will be used
in several matches during the early
part of ino season. Uniforms have
been ordered and are expected to
arrive in the course of the next few
days.
The first practice of the present
season was held on the Campus dia
mond last, Saturday. Coach Lanagan
was on the field and supervised the
work of the squad. Both he and
Captain Fenton expressed them
selves as well satisfied with the
showing of the men and do not doubt
that little difficulty will be experi
enced in filling the places of those
varsity veterans who have not re
turned to college.
Class nines will be formed and the
series played as soon as possible.
These games, however, will not be
allowed to interfere with the work
of the Varsity. Should there not be
enough aspirants for any class team,
no attempt, will be made to remedy
the defect, but that class will for
feit its right to participate in the
series.
The Campus diamond has been
scraped and put.in suitable condi
tion for the varsity games, the first
of which, that with St. Mary's, will
be called next Saturday iit
