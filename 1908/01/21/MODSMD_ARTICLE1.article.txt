# TRACK TRAINING BEGINS
## LARGE SQUAD OUT FOR FIRST DAY OF SEASON. Majority of Candidates Do Only Light Work.â€”Track Is in Good Condition. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Trainer Moul
ton and Track Captain Lanagan be
gan the task ol' developing a track
team for the season ol' 1908, and
judging from the showing made on
the first day of the regular training
season, there will he no lack of good
material upon which they may work.
Over a hundred men were on the
track in the course of the afternoon
and towards evening the cinder path
was fairly well crowded with the
athletes. As it was the first day out
for many of the men, the training
was necessarily of the lightest char
acter and designed merely to lim
ber up the muscles.
However, several of the men who
began training a week ago are now
getting into pretty good condition
and are doing fairly hard work. Mil
ler, Maundrell, McGregor, Cook and
Lee are running several laps at a
good pace every night and many
others have begun to cover a con
siderable distance. The men are de
voting much of their time at. first
to practice in starting, and a man
is kept constantly busy sending run
ners away from the mark.
A business engagement prevent
ed Trainer Moulton from being pres
ent during the latter part of the
iifternoon, but Captain Lanagan took
charge of the new candidates and the
afternoon's work went off very
smoothly.
The rains have made the track
very favorable for the first few days'
training, though it is a trifle too soft
at the pole, and is becoming badly
in need of a coat of cinders. In
view of the number of meets that
*viil be held here this spring, il will
be necessary to have a new layer of
cinders upon the track.
