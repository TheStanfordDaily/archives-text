# Women Oppose Disfranchisement.
## 
### 
The California women students
helrl a mass meeting yesterday and
protested against the proposed move
ment to disfranchise them. An elec
tion will be held tomorrow, on an
amendment to the constitution which
will accomplish this end, and the
women pledged themselves to vote
against it. They will also introduce
an amendment of their own, framed,
us they believe, on a more equitable
basis. They say that the men wish
to disfranchise them, and at the
same time have them continue to
pay dues.
