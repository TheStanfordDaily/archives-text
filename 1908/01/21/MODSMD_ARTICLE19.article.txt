# GAY PLEASED WITH MATERIAL.
## President Turner Visits Coach Dan Murphy, Who Is Slowly Recuperating. 
### 
Captain Gay is well pleased with
the material for the varsity srew.
Gay took charge of the men at the
boathouse yesterday afternoon.
"Among the new men," said Gay this
afternoon, "there are a number of
large Freshmen and others who have
not. been out before. From the men
at work I think we shall be able to
pick crews that should make a good
showing."
President Turner, of the Boat
Club, saw Coach Murphy at St. Jo
seph's Hospital in San Francisco last
evening. Murphy's temperature had
been normal for five days previous
to yesterday, when it showed a slight
increase. His long illness, resulting
from such an obstinate attack of
typhoid, however, has left him so
weak that his doctors say he will
have to spend a fortnight more in
the hospital. The coach is receiving
the best of care, so that the hospi
tal authorities will not discharge him
until he is fully recovered.
The following names have been
added to the list of candidates for
the crew: W. Slack, '09, W. S.
Miller, '10, H. E. White, '11.
