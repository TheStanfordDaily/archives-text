# SHOWS FINE TECHNIQUE
## FAMOUS VIOLINIST PLAYS WITH SPEED AND PRECISION. Concert In Assembly Hall Draws Largo Crowd From Campus and Palo Alto. 
### 
Jan Kubelik, the second great vio
linist to be heard in Assembly Hall
1 i his college year, played last night
j to a crowded house and won much
I applause but leaves with us the im
pression that while his performance
was fine and a musical treat of the
highest order, he could have donf
better. Had he been playing to
thousands instead of hundreds, Jan
Kubelik would undoubtedly have
j stirred souls with his wonderful abil-
I ity rather than producing simply ex
quisite tones lacking to a certain ex
! tent, that throbing spirit so peculiai
j to the violin.
Kubelik, in his performance last
night amply lived up to his title as
one of the foremost, violinists of the
age in his technique.
The technique of the great artist,
both upon the finger board and with
the bow, was evident from the start
when he rendered Wieniawsky's Con
certo in I) minor. Beginning with
the Allegro Moderato he showed his
technique and in the Komanza in the
solo on the G string displayed per
haps as much feeling and shading
as in any of the subsequent selec
tions of the evening. His rendering
of the Finale was stirring.
In his second group of selections
the Scherzo of Tschaikowsky was
perhaps as pleasing as any of the
four included in this number. In
this selection the members of the au
dience who had the pleasure of lis
j tening to the recital of Maude Pow
, ell last semester were given an ex
cellent opportunity to compare the
I two players as both included this
composition in their repertoire. Jan
I Kubleik did not. suffer from com
parison.
Kubelik brought his recital to a
i close with the Fantasie of Paganini
I followed with Traumerei as an en
core.
Mile. Roy, who rendered several
I solo:; on the piano was also able to
ive a surprising exhibition of tech
j niq ie and her rendering of Chopin
' was? pleasing. Ludwig Schwab at
| ;}•.(• piano rendered an ample back-
I ground for Jan Kubelik's playing.
