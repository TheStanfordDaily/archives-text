Several of the men who had pre

i tion during the past four weeks in
I preparation for the tryout.
Of those trying out, W. C. Shel

manic Languages, Professor IT. W.
Stuart, of the Philosophy depart
ment, and Instructor A. E. Harvey,
of the History department. This
topic will be announced to the con
testants in the Chapel two hours be
fore the tryout opens. At that time
the debaters will designate the side
lof the question which they individ
ually desire to uphold and they will

I hen retire to arrange their speeches
accordingly. As prescribed h\ the
Carnot regulations, each speaker
will divide fifteen minutes as he
chooses between his direct argument
and the refutation of the contentious
of his opponents with the sole limi
tation thai at least four minutes be
devoted to each.
