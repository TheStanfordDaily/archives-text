When the Sophomore class ap
pointed a committee this afternoon
to devise some method of regulating
the financial management of the
"Quad," the class took a step in the
right direction. In the past the edi
torship of the "Quad" has been con
sidered one of the highest honors
that could be secured in college. It
is a position of honor and one which
has been eagerly sought after. And
as a result the class has usually de
voted more attention to securing an
able editor than has been given to
the selection of an efficient manager.
The result has been that the mana
gership of the "Quad" has become
a position which was usually given
to a man on the presumption that
he should make as much money out
of it as possible. This attitude to
ward the posilion is absolutely
wrong. No editor can issue a credit
able "Quad" unless lie has the hear
ty co-operation of his manager, and
the success of the booh depends al
most as much upon the work of the
manager as that of the editor. Con
sequently the class should not only
be careful in selecting a manager,
but the position should be looked
upon as an honor, both in the class
and by the university community,
and a man aspiring to the office
should do so in the same spirit that
inspires the candidates for the ed
itorship. In other words, he should
seek the position for the purpose
of co-operating with the editor in is
suing an artistic "Quad" that will
be a credit to both bis class and the
University.
