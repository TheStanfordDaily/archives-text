# WILL ENTER SEVEN MEN
## CARDINAL TEAM TO COMPETE IN SAN FRANCISCO. Distance Men To Run In Contest for Olympic Cup.â€”Additions to Squad. 
### 
It is now practically certain that
a Stanford team of distance runners
will enter the Olympic Club two-mile
race in Golden Gate Park on Wash
ington's birthday. The event is a
team race, each competing institu
tion entering seven men, the first
five to finish counting in the score.
Stanford has plenty of material
from which to select a strong team
for a race of this distance, with the
assurance that the men are sure to
make a creditable showing, even if
they fail to capture the event. The
men interested in the two-mile run
are all anxious to compete for a
place on the proposed team, and
heartily approve the plan of enter
ing the competition for the Olympic
Club cup. Captain Lanagan also
expresses himself in favor of the
proposal and says he will enter a
team if the men get into condition
by that date. Those who have al
ready signified their intention of en
tering the tryouts when the team
is selected are: E. .1. Nash, '08, E.
A. McGregor, 'OS, .1, O. Miller, '08,
J. P. Hemphill, '09, C. B. Bradford,
'09. H. 11. Maundrell, '10, J. E.
Shelton, '10, and E. C. Templeton,
'10.
From present indications the
Olympic Club will have an unusual
ly strong team in this race, includ
ing such well-known athletes as
Glarner, Garcia, Kelley, Connelly.
Moody and Hackley, who held the
intercollegiate record for 1 902.
Starting today and continuing un
til after the first preliminary meet,
a rubbing table will be mai tained
for all the men doing regular train
ing, regardless of their performance.
Several familiar faces were seen
on the track yesterday for the first
time this season and the number of
candidates was substantially in
creased. C. L. Severy, '08, and C.
C. Coonan, '09, are beginning to
get into shape for the 110-yard ev
ent, and F. K. Pomeroy, '11, took
his first, turn around the track yes
terday.
The men are beginning to special
ize a little more and the field events
are beginning to receive consider
able attention. S. H, Hellah, '10,
tried a few practice vaults over a
low bar, M. P. Youker, '10, is get
ting into good form with the ham
mer, and 11. L. Morton, '08, tried a
few starts over a (light of hurdles.
