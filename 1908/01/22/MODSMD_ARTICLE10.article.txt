We wish to call attention to the
fact that the Sophomore class is anx
ious to receive suggestions as to the
best method to adopt in the finan
cial regulation of the 1910 "Quad."
Communications in regard to the
matter will be welcomed by the Daily
Palo Alto and may serve to mater
ially assist the Sophomores in plac
ing the management of the annual
upon a more suitable basis. This
should be a matter of interest to the
entire Student Body, as the "Quad"
is not only a class annual; it. repre
sents the whole University.
According to the present plans of
ihe Chess Club, there will be several
exhibition matches played, and new
men will be encouraged to become
interested in the game, before tlie
tryouts for the intercollegiate team
are held. This plan has been adopt
ed because at the opening of the
present semester there was not. suffi
cient. interest in chess among the
men who have formerly played. As
there is an intercollegiate chess con
test every spring it is imperative
that the men who play tlie game
should take enough interest to in
sure a spirited contest for places
on the team which will meet Cali
fornia. This year those in charge
of the Chess Club have started in
the proper way to arouse interest
and there is 110 reason why a team
should not be developed which will
defeat California in the annual
match.
