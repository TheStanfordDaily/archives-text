# Michigan Withdraws From Big Nine.
## 
### 
After two years of indecision and
bickering, Michigan lias formally se
vered all relations with the "Big
Nine." The action came as a re
sult of the insistence by the other
members of the Conference upon
three restrictions: abolition of train
ing tables, limiting each member to
(ive football games each season, and
making retroactive the rule that 110
man could participate in athletics for
more than three years.
Michigan is trying to arrange a
schedule with Eastern universities,
but a game with Pennsylvania is
the only one secured so far.
The "Big Eight," as it will now
be known, consists of Chicago, Wis
consin, Minnesota, Illinois, Purdue,
Iowa, Indiana and Northwestern.
