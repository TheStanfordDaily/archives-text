# NEW FEATURES FOR QUAD
## EDITOR BRUNING MAY OFFER PRIZE FOR IDEAS. 1909 Annual Progressing But is Temporarily Handicapped By Non-payment of Assessments. 
### 
The compiling of material for the
1909 "Quad" is progressing favor
ably, a lid the first lot of copy will
he placed upon the copy-hooks of
the publishers in San Francisco this
week. The book is to be printed
by t lie Stanley-Taylor Company,
which had the contract for the last
two annuals. The year book this
year will differ in several respects
from previous volumes. Editor Bru
ning lias decided to eliminate the
prize story and poem from his edi
tion and intends to substitute either
a prize cartoon or offer a cash prize
for the undergraduate submitting
the cleverest idea or feature to be
incorporated in the book. The ex
act. amount of the prize which wil!
be offered and further particulars
regarding the nature of the ideas de
sired will be made known by the
"Quad" board within the next few
days, as the matter is at present
under consideration by Editor Bin
ning and his assistants.
The only serious obstacle which
has thus far been encountered by the
"Quad" board is the lack of ready
money, due to the failure of the
members of the Junior class to meet
the assessment levied last semester.
Ip to date less than one quarter of
the class have paid the assess
ment. and only a third of this number
have had their photographs taken.
The photographs are to be taken by
I)a\ey of Palo Alto, and a twenty
five per cent reduction will be given
upon all extra pictures ordered.
