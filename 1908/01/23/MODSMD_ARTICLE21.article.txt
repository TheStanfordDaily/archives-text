# California Women Retain Vote.
## 
### 
In the election at California yester
day to decide whether the women
students should be deprived of votes
in the Associated Student Body, the
amendment to that effect was defeat
ed oâ€¢"7 to 94. But two women cast
ballots in favor of the measure.
A majority of the men voted for
the amendment, but their vote was
too light to defeat that of the wo
men.
