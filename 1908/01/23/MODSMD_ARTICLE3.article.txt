IN fore one of the largest and most
enthusiastic audiences that, lias ever
I gathered in the University Chapel for
I a preliminary debate, J. B. Slielton,
| '10, YY. 0. Shelton, "08, and I). C.
•oyd, 'OS, were last night selected
to represent the Cardinal in the con
: test for the Car'not medal, to be held
a! the University of California on
February 7. L. Newland, "OS, will
j be the alternate. R. E. Hodge, 'OS,
I presided and briefly reviewed the con
| ditions governing the tryout and read
J the question for discussion.
The general excellence of the
spi eches made by the ten men in tin
tryout last night was a source of
ureal encouragement to those who
look for another Stanford victory
next month. The successful trio was.
picked by Professors F. C. Woodward
j and W. \. Hohfeld of the Depart
: nie.it of Law, and Professor \V. D
| Briggs of the English department. 1 1.
j ai'nq.inciug the .team', Professor
Woodward took occasion to com <!'
meat ail of the debaters upon tlieii
careful preparation and skillful
handling of the subject.
"Resolved, That international con
trol of .Morocco is more desirable!
than Franco-Spanish control, it be- j
ing granted that outside control is,
required," was the coniprehonsivt
specific topic for debate framed by a
committee composed of Professor A
L. Guerard of the Depariment of Ro
manic Languages, Professor 11. W.
Stuart of the Philosoph\ department,
and Instructor A. E. Harvey of the
Ilistorv department. And, although
the situation was dealt with in good
•tyle by the disputants, their argu
ments failed to really clash in the
•oitrse of the discussion. Each of
t m> speakers presented carefully
! worked out solutions of the problem
] but they approached it from entirely
different viewpoints. The contestants
practically ignored Spain and con
fined themselves almost, wholly to
lie French aspect of the matter.
Promptly at six o'clock, It. E.
Hodge opened a sealed envelope con
taining the question and announced

its contents to the candidates for
the team, assembled in the Chapel.
The debaters then chose the sides
which they desired to uphold, and
drew lots to determine the order of
speaking. .1. F. Reilly, '(is, L. New
land, 'OS, J. E. Shelton, *10, li. F.
Pruning, '09, and W. ('. Shelton,
OS, in the order named, composed
the affirmative side, while I!. B. Mur
phy, '08, F. \V. McNulty, 09, D. C.
i.oyd,'08, F. B. Wood, '10, and F. L.
Fetzer, '09, defended the negative.
The debaters, after hearing the ques
tion and selecting sides, retired to
arrange their arguments. The
speeches were limited to fifteen min
ut.es, divided optionally between the
presentation of the main argument
and the rebuttal, provided at least
four minutes was devoted to each.
