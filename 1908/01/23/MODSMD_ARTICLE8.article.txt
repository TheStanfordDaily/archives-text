## HEAD OF LAW DEPARTMENT IS HONORED IN MELBOURNE. Returns to Campus After Pleasant Trip to Antipodes.-Visited Thomas Welton Stanford. 
### 
Professor C. H. Huberich, head of
the Law department, returned to the
Campus this morning, after a two
months trip to Australia, New Zeal
and and the Fiji Islands. While
away he visited the principal cities
of the islands as well as the Uni
versities of Melbourne, Sidney, Ade
laide, and Hobart, being well receiv
ed by the members of the several
universities. The University of .Mel
bourne conferred upon him the hon
orary degree of Doctor of Laws, a
distinction which no American has
ever enjoyed, and which was given
to him in recognition of his schol
arly attainments in tlie field of juris
prudence.
Professor Huberich's purpose in
visiting the Antipodes was to gather
material for a report on the commer
cial laws ol Australia, New Zeal
and, and the Fiji Islands for the
third edition of Borchardt's Commer
cial Laws of the World, which is to
be published by the German Minis
ter of Justice, at Berlin.
While in Melbourne he was the
guest of Thomas Welton Stanford for
several days. Mr. Stanford fully con
firmed all tlie reports which have
been published in regard to his in
tended donations to Stanford He told
Professor Huberich of his plans for
establishing Australian scholarships
at Stanford, stating that he had
made provision in his will for the
endowment of about eight scholar
ships. The exact details as to the
administration and apportionment ot
the funds devoted to this purpose,
have not been worked out but the
funds will he entrusted to the Board
ol I rustees. It is probable that no
definite amount will be appropriated
for each scholarship, but that the
money will be apportioned accord
ing to the needs of each particular
case.
Mr. Stanford and the leading men
of the Australian I'niversities are
very much interested in the estab
lishment ot these scholarships and
believe that Stanford's influence will
thereby lie extended and a closer in
lellectual relationship be fostered be
tween tlie two countries. By the
provisions of the endowment only
prominent undergraduates will !>e
appointed and they must return to
Australia after having completed
their course here. This will create
a strong body of alumni in the Anti
podes. Mr. Stanford also promised
the immediate donation to the Stan
ford Law Library of several very val
uable sets of Australian court re
ports, statutes, digests and records.
