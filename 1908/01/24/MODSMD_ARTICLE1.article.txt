bility rule tor transfers.
It is a foregone conclusion that
California will make every attempt,
short of an actual deadlock to ob
tain some radical change concern
ins <he status of the Rughv game in
the Intercollegiate Agreement. A
prominent Blue and Gold undergrad
uate states in regard to this matter:
"Although there is a strong senti
ment here in favor of a change to
the revised rules, it is probable that
the committee will receive no in
struction?. and it is my personal be
lief that California will make no ef
fort to force Stanford to act. Then,
hack of all this, stands the faculty
rule thai the intercollegiate game
shall be Rugby."
The Cardinal delegates have been
instructed to propose three amend
ments, and the most important of
these is the one providing that nei
ther university shall be represented
hy more than five men in any one
event in any track meet between
Stanford and California. The prev
ent. rule fixes the maximum number
at eight.
The Cardinal members will also
endeavor lo have the annual Fresh
man football same scheduled for ihe
Saturday three weeks before the var
sity contest instead of four, as is
the case at present. Stanford's
third provision, if passed, will allow
any student who has transferred
from another institution to compete
in intercollegiate contests before the
expiration of one year, provided that
the student in question has not been
in attendance at any college during
the year previous to his registering
at Stanford or California.
California will attempt to institute
the custom of a Freshman baseball
game to be played on the morning
of the Freshman intercollegiate
track meet, and the Blue and Gold
representatives will also endeavor
to secure Stanford's sanction to a

• harge, whereby liie intercollegiate
tennis contests will consist of three
singles iind Iwo doubles matches.
Furthermore, California hope.-' to
have inserted in the agreement a
.•lame requiring that the nmpi re of
;i 11 intercollegiate games be a pro
fessional.
The delegates from California will
•ilso propose a change in the rules
meriting the playing of the third
baseball game in the series, when
.lie is necessary. I'nder the pres
ent agreement, the third contest
mast, be played on neutral ground,
and California desires this rule
changed so that the decisive contest
may be played on one of the Oam
•>uh diamonds.
