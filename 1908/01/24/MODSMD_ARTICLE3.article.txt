# WILL SOON FILL LAKE
## REPAIRS ON CONDUIT COST ALMOST $4000. Professor Wing Says a Large Stream of Water Will Now Flow Into Lagunita. 
### 
According to a statement made b\
Professor C. B. Wing, of the Commis
sion of Engineers, this afternoon,
the conduit to fill Lagiiuita will be
! completed by the end of this week
ii rain does not prevent the car
pi liters now engaged from doing
their last work. "The water will
have to be turned in from the dam
| slowly at first," said Professor Wing,
"to allow for soaking up the ditch
and the flume. The capacity of the
(lunie is forty cubic feet per second.
I There is now sufficient water in the
I dam to How at the total capacity
of the flume, and at. that rate, the
; lake can be filled by the end of next
| week."
The only work which remains to
be done is on the flume. When the
battens have been placed on ithe
floor and an inspection board run
along the flume, ihe water will be
turned in.
The Board of Trustees will have
expended nearly $4000 on the al
| terations to the flume and ditch
when all the bills are paid. To
| the Rock-Crusher dam there has
been added a concrete wing wall on
leach side. The purpose of ibis wall
|is to prevent the dam from being
J undermined by the overflow. A large
i amount of the water which is now
flowing over the spillway will be
diverted into Ihe flume when it is
opened. A fish ladder has also been
(installed in compliance with the law.
The new sections of ditch are at
I least five feet deep in all places, and
| have sides sloping at an angle of
j forty-five degrees to a minimum
j width of three feet. They replace
I part of the old flume.
A new reinforced concrete culvert
six feet wide by four feet high and
| 300 feet long has been constructed
| under the county road near the
Stock Farm at a cost of $1200. This
(carries the water into 11k Stock
Farm, through which il passes Fie
| remainder of the way to Laguaiia
by the old ditch. The work done
(>n the conduit, with slight repairs
which may occasionally be neces
sary, should keep it serviceable for
ten years. The total length of the
j conduit is 6200 feet.
