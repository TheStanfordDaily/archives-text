When the Intercollegiate Agree j

cisco tomorrow night, several import- j

that, may enter each event in an in- j
tercollegiate track meet, and the
proposed intercollegiate Freshman
baseball game are the points which
promise to bring forth the most dis- j
cushion. Stanford's delegates will |
certainly stand for a continuation ot >
the Rugby game next fall. This po- |
sition appears to be perfectly justi- |
fled by the sentiment of a large ma- I
jority of the Student Body, and any]
suggestion of changing to the revised '
rules of the American game must ;
undoubtedly be made by California. !
In view of the opinion of the ma
jority of Stanford students our rep
resentatives are sure to remain firm
on this point and there appears to j
be no chance for a change.
The proposal which will be made
by ti t> Stanford delegates in regard
to limiting the number of men to j
be entered by each university in an
event in the intercollegiate track j
meet to five, is a reform that has
long been needed. There does not
api car to be any real reason why six
teen men should be entered in each
event. This offers opportunities for
placing men in events merely for
the purpose of interfering with men
who leally have a chance to make
points. It would indeed be remark
able if either university should have
eight men who appear to have strong
chances of scoring points. By lim
iting the number of entries to five
the contests are sure to be run
more squarely and a man will not
be prevented I'rom doing himself jus
tice because of the track being
blocked by men who have no par- '
ticular chance to take points. The j
large number of preliminary meets j
at both universities give the medi- I
ocre men plenty of chance to com
pete,
California will propose a Fresh
man intercollegiate baseball game

but this suggestion has not met with
favor here generally, because of the
fact that the Freshmen are now
considered as having all the athletic
contests that, are needed. There does
not seem to be any strong reason
lor this addition to the present ath
letic schedule, and although the Ex
ecutive Committee has not instruct
ed the Stanford delegates upon this
point, it is not expected that they
will favor the idea.
The two suggestions from our del
egates in regard to placing the inter
collegiate Freshman football contest
a week later and the change in re
gard to the eligibility of students
who have come from other universi
ties, are amendments which seeni to
be needed and will benefit both par
ties to the agreement.
