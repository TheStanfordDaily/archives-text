# VARSITY PLAYS TUESDAY
## IRELAND'S INDEPENDENTS WILL BE OPPOSING NINE. Devereaux, Heitmuller, and Other Well-Known Players Will Be In Visitors' Line-Up. 
### 
The inclemency of the weather
Saturday afternoon prevented the
playing of the first baseball game
scheduled for the Varsity this season,
but if the condition of the diamond
will permit, the Cardinal nine will
cross bats with Ireland's Independ
ents at 15:45 tomorrow. The visit
ors have a strong team this year,
including in their line-up such men
as Devereaux, Heitmuller, Williams,
Schimpf, and Bliss, not to speak of
Captain Ireland himself. This is the
sixteenth consecutive spring that Ire
land has organized an aggregation of
stars, and he claims that his team
this season is easily the best that
he has ever putin the field.
Notwithstanding the slippery dia
mond, the varsity squad indulged in
the usual practice Saturday. The
class nines will play practice matches
as often as possible, but the inter
class series will probably not be held
until the latter part of February.
The admission to tomorrow's
game will be twenty-five cents. The
line-ups follow:
Stanford—Theile, Witmer, Good
ell, pitchers; Mitchell, catcher: Mc-
Gregor, first base: Bell, second base;
Sampson, shortstop; Fenton, third
base; Owen, left field; Wirt, center
field: Scott, right field.
Independents—Schimpf, pitcher;
Bliss, catcher; Kennedy, first base;
Stultz, second base; Devereaux, third
base; McKune, shortstop; Heitmul
ler, left, field; Williams, center field;
and Ireland, right •field.
