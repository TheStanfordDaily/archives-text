### 
A scholarly sermon was delivered
I by ltev. Henry Gowen, D. D., in the
; Chapel yesterday morning. He chose
the topic for his sermon from the
j "Chronicles" of the Testament which
dealt with the enlargement of one's
outlook upon life. He selected the
, character .labez, to illustrate his
| point upon this topic. After a brief
: talk on the life of .labez he com
pared liis life with the lives of the
present generation, using illustrju
i lions of characters in literature both
ancient and modern.
The preacher brought his sermon
I to a close by saying that if we went
through life w.ith Cod in our hearts
j we would be much happier.
