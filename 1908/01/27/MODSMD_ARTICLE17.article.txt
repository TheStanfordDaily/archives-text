In seeking to reform the present
system of "Quad" management, the
Sophomore class have initiated a
movement which, if carried out, will
result in an important change in
Student Body policy. The practice
of permitting editors and managers
to use the "Quad" as a means for
personal financial profit, is bad in
every way.
In the first place, the class and
the University are not represented
by the best possible book under the
present system. The manager with
an eye to personal profit must ne
cessarily hold down expenses, and in
consequence the editor seldom has
sufficient funds to work out any new
features which he may have planned
for the book. So, from a practical
standpoint, the present system is far
from attaining the best results.
Theoretically this system is op
posed to Stanford's best traditions.
There is in it none of the idea of
doing one's best for the University,
with no selfish thoughts of personal
profit. Why not pay our athletic
teams for their services to the Stu
dent Body, which demand far greater
sacrifices of time and labor than
those involved in issuing the Junior
annual ?
The Sophomores should stop at no
half-way measures. Every cent ov
er and above the legitimate expenses
of the editor and manager, should go
back into the "Quad," and 1910 will
have a book of which it may well be
proud. Such a reform will necessi
tate the discovery in the Sophomore
class of two men, who are ready and
willing to give up their time for the
"Quad," merely for the personal
pride of turning out the best possi
ble book to represent their class. If
1910 is unable to find two such men,
it must necessarily go back to the
old system of previous classes, and
hire the best talent which can be
found in its ranks, with the induce
ment of personal profit to be made
from the production of the annual.
