# Several Changes in Agreement
## Intercollegiate Committee Adopts Freshman Baseball Game.--Football Situation Entirely Ignored. 
### 
A spirit of harmony characterized
the meeting of the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee, which occur
red at the St. Francis Hotel last
Saturday evening. Perhaps the rea
son for the peaceful nature of the
gathering may be found in the fact
that all discussion of the football
situation was left entirely in abey
ance. The only radical change ef
fected was that providing for a
Freshman baseball game between
Stanford and California. Several
propositions were dropped complete
ly, and the only other suggestions
on which action was taken were of
rather minor importance.
Concerning the football question,
it was merely provided that the com
mittee should be convened in spec
ial session, if by any chance future
developments seemed to warrant
such a meeting. This provision an
ticipates any possible change which
the faculty committees of the two
universities might make in regard to
the playing of Rugby.
h'rt'shinaii Baseball Game.
The proposal by the California
representatives of an annual inter
collegiate Freshman baseball game
occasioned little discussion, and the
amendment was adopted with the
stipulation that the r.ile should not
be operative until the spring of 1909.
Coach Lanagan favored such an ad
dition to the present list of inter
collegiate events. He feels that the
innovation would have been imprac
ticable this year, but that next sea
son, when the Cardinal squad has
the use of two diamonds, such a con
test will be distinctly beneficial. The
game will be played on the morn
ing of the intercollegiate Freshman
track meet.

Limit Entries to Seven.
The desire of Stanford to limit to
five the number of Cardinal or Blue
and Gold entries in any track or
field -event ended in a compromise.
The California delegates were strong
ly opposed to the measure, and hear
tily wished to retain the present sys
tem of allowing eight contestants
from either college. The agreement,
as finally reached, makes seven the
maximum number.
Third. Hull Came on Campus.
Next, in interest comes the change
in the rules regarding the place of
playing the third baseball game,
when such a one is necessary. Here
after, beginning at Berkeley, the
match will alternate between the two
campus diamonds. The alternation,
however, will not take place by years,
but will be effective only when the
third game is played.
No Change in Tennis.
Stanford's attempt to alter the
rule that transfers must be in at
tendance at the university for one
year before being eligible to compete
in intercollegiate events met with
complete failure. The motion was
lost on a tie vote, and the present
regulation will stand. California's
proposal in regard to increasing the
number of tennis matches from three
to five was also defeated by an eqiuil
division of the ballots.
The question as to whether or not
the umpire in the intercollegiate
baseball series should be a profes
sional was left to the discretion of
the graduate managers, who will
come to some definite conclusion on
the subject in the near future.
Unless unforeseen complications in
the football situation necessitate an
extra meeting of the committee, the
six representatives will not again be
convened until next January.
