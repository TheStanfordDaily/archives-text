lowing to say:
"The only formal resolution passed
was to the effect that beginning next
year, University teams should com
pete only with teams really amateur
or openly professional. This means
that Santa Clara, St. Vincents' and
St. Mary's will hereafter have- to
follow the usual regulations in re
gard to amateur standing.
"As no formal action was taken
011 the football question, the resolu
tion previously adopted by the con
ference still stands. This resolution,
it will be recollected, barred the Am
erican Intercollegiate game in both
universities.
"The main discussion of the ses
sion was on the growing athletic ex
penses of the two universities."

to economize in athletic expenses this
spring by apportioning definite

ing $400.
While the faculty conference took
no action in the matter of having
the members of the university teams
take out. amateur cards in the Pa
cific Athletic Association, they will
nevertheless recommend all men to
do so before competing with any
; team which is not strictly amateur.
Under the new ruling of the P. A. A.
| anyone not holding an amateur card
!is professionalized by entering in
competition with a non-anTateur
team.
