In another column there appears
a communication to which we wish
to call the attention of the entire
Student Body and particularly mem
bers of the Sophomore class. This
communication deals with the sub
ject of the selection of "Quad" man
ager and editor. We heartily agree
with I lie position taken by the writ
er of this article and hope to see
the Sophomores seriously consider
his suggestions. It is absolutely ne
cessary that there should be some
improvement in the method of man
aging the class annual. And lit
would seem that two men could be
secured who are willing to devote
their time and energy toward get
ting out a creditable "Quad," for
the sake of the class and the Uni
versity, as well iis for the personal
pride in having done a good work.
If the "Quad" was managed and
edited- with this idea in view the
result would be a finer and more ar
tistic book, and the men who un
dertook the work would be reward
ed by the very fact that they had
the honor of directing the produc
tion of such an annual.
The editor and manager should be
allowed all legitimate expenses, but
aside from fhis ;il! money which
conies in either from assessments
or advertisements should be devoted
toward improving the book. With
such a system there is no doubt that
the annual will be greatly improved.
And it is now up to the Class of 1910
to establish such a precedent. If
within the entire class it is impos
sible to get two men to undertake
the t;isU of directing the "Quad" up
on such a basis then go back to
the old system of hiring men.
