# HANDICAP MEET FRIDAY
## ALL MEN TRAINING WILL COMPETE IN THIS CONTEST. Freshman Athletes Have Developed a Great Heal Within the Past Week. 
### 
Captain Lanagan has arranged to
hold the lirst preliminary meet, of the
season next Friday afternoon at 4:00
o'clock. The meet is open to all men
doing track work and a large entry
list is expected. As the men are not
yet in condition to stand a long dis
tance race, the events will be short
ened as they were in the fall meet.
The 440-yard dash will be shortened
to 352 yards; the 880-yard run to
660 yards; the mile run to three
laps; and the two mile-run to six
laps.
The men will be handicapped on the
basis of best previous performance,
in order that the new men will have
some chance of placing in their ev
ents. The handicapping will be done
by Captain Lanagan and Trainer
Moulton.
All who desire to enter the meet
must si£<ll up on the list now posted
in the training house, designating
ihe event in which they wish to en
ter, before Wednesday evening. Tt
is also desire'd that new men give
their time or distance to furnish a
basis for the handicapping.
The regular rubbing list, will be
started after this meet and all men
who do not make the list on their
performance Friday will have to run
a satisfactory trial before their name
is added.
Although the weather has been
most, unsatisfactory for track work
during the past week, the squad has
not materially diminished on account
of <l>e hard training conditions.
The week's work has caused a de
cided improvement in the condition
of the men and the work is becom
ing harder every eveniner. Esnecial
improvement is noticeable among the
Freshman candidates, some of whom
promise to give the varsitv men a
food run for a place on the team.
T v<tb trainer and caotain are pleased
" ith the showing made by the first
vpfu« men and consider that there is
nioptv ( tf (rood material from which
to select the team for the meet with
California.
