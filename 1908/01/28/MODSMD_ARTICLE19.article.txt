Editor of the"Daily Palo Alto:
I have read the foregoing commu
nication, and I wish to subscribe my
approval to it in every detail. While
some of the plans and schemes of
the "Quad" board and the editor
were disappointed last year, on ac
count of the limitation of their ap
propriation, results have shown this
limitation to have been grounded up
on sound business judgment on the
part of Mr. Tlieile. The issuance of
the 1 907 "Quad" at Christmas, last
year, drained the city of advertising,
and the most expensive book yet pub
lished (the 1 908 "Quad") was com
pelled to subsist on about half the
advertisements of the previous edi
tion.
However, 1 am fully aware of the
suspicion which the university pub
lic has come to attach to all "Quad"
finances. 1 have gone carefully
through the books of the 1908
"Quad" with Mr. Theile, and his
statements as to the failure of this
book to make a profit are entirely
accurate. I would suggest to all who
are interested that they respond to
Mr. Theile's invitation to go through
his books with him.
EARL J. HADLEY,
Editor 1908 "Quad."
