# TO ENDOW SCHOLARSHIP
## MR. STANFORD TELLS OF PLANS FOR AUSTRALIAN STUDENTS. Interview Regarding $250.000 Fund Which Is To Be Used To Send Australians to Stanford. 
### 
The following interview with Tho
-1 mas Welton Stanford in regard to the
j Stanford scholarships which he has
I established by a provision in his will,
j appeared recently in the Melbourne
i "Age." The interview is of interest
in that it outlines Mr. Stanford's
plans and gives the objects which
he seeks to attain by sending Aus
tralians to Stanford.
Mr. Stanford said' in part: "1 have
decided to set aside about $250,000
as a scholarship endowment for Aus
tralian students. The details of the
scheme have not been worked out
but will be left in the hands of the
university trustees. The endowment
I fund will probably yield a sufficient
annual revenue to permit of six or
height students leaving for Palo Al
io annually. No definite sum will be
set aside for each student, and the
length of their training at the Uni
versity will vary, the trustees being
i the sole judges of how long a stu
lent shall remain. Above every
'hing else, my desire is that. Australia
shall reap the entire benefit of this
higher training of her rising men.
The difficulty is to make some bind
ing stipulation that students should
give Australia the benefit of the
training they receive, but T hope and
believe, however, that in spite of the
attractions that America, with its
wide field of enterprise, offers, they
will be patriotic enough to return
! to their native land.
"As to the selection of the Aus
tralian students, I believe that the
Stanford University trustees will
seek the assistance and advice of the
Councils of the three Australian uni
versities. Where a student can ob
tain the highest educational advan
tages at the Universities of Mel
bourne. Sidney or Adelaide, 1 do not
desire that lie shall proceed to Stan
ford University under the scholarship
, scheme. Hut in the higher branches
of technical training the Australian
| universities are deficient, and it is in
this direction, principally, that. I do
sire to give extended scope to the
young man of ability, denied by fi
j nancial reasons from completing his
technical training in the colleges
abroad."
Speaking of the University Lib
rary, which he built in 1897. he stat
ed that it contains the finest and lar
gest. collection of Australian litera
ture in the world with the exception
of the Smithsonian Institute at
Washington, D. C. Each year a large
| number of publications are sent to
the librar.y. and Dr. Jordan during
j his recent trip to Australia, secured
â€¢' valuable acquisition to the collec
tion.
