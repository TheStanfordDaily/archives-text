# MUST HAVE MORE MONEY
## ALL STUDENTS WILL BE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE. President Murphy Will Appoint Committee To Solicit Funds for Track Bleachers. 
### 
In accordance with the action
agreed upon at a recent meeting of
the Executive Committee (there is
to be a special assessment levied up
on members of the Student Body
with the idea of raising sufficient mo
ney to construct the new set of
bleachers for the track. The Board
of Control has been unable to raise
any money and has announced that
the expense must be borne by the
undergraduates entirely.
President A. A. Murphy, '08, and
Graduate Manager Guy Knupp, '07,
are making arrangements to appoint
a large number of representative stu
dents as collectors. The plan that
will be followed is similar to that
employed when a portion of the in
itial expense of building the track
was assumed by the students as in
dividuals.
It is thought that $7">o or $800
will be ample to build a set of bleach
ers similar to those already in place.
The need of the extra seating capa
city at the oval is imperative this
year as the intercollegiate meet will
be held here. Should spectators be
forced to watch the events without
sufficient, bleachers to accommodate
them it. would be impossible to draw
a crowd of any size at any future
meet.
The work on the bleachers should
be begun at the earliest opportunity
and the collectors chosen from each
of the various communities will be
given their receipt, books, which call
for an assessment of $1, on Friday.
The names of the students will also
be announced Thursday night.
