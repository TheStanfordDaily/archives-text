# DAILY CALIFORNIAN BANKRUPT.
## Lack of Support on Part of Student Body Has Caused This Failure. 
### 
"The Daily Californian," the stu
dent daily of the University of Cali
fornia, suspended publication last
Saturday. The paper has been finan
cially embarrassed for the last, two
years and Manager McLellan brought
matters to a climax by withdrawing
his bond and refusing to act as man
ager for the publication.
This week the paper is appearing
on a single sheet 8 by 10 inches to
keep its mailing rights. Last night's
issue contained an editorial which
told of the difficulties of maintain
ing a paper with a rj2s circulation.
There will be a special meeting of
the student body next. Thursday
when the Associated Students will be
asked to assume the $800 deficit.
Unless the student body assumes Ibis
debt the"Daily Californian" will bo
forced to cease publication altogether
Some lime ago the paper was reor
ganized as a corporation, and an ef
fort was made to dispose of enough
stock to pay off the paper's indebt
edness, but this plan did not pro
duce the hoped for results.

Manager J. J. Me Leilan said l hat
the whole trouble came from lack of
student, support. He said that
there were only a hundred subscrib
ers of a student body numbering
3000.
The "Daily Californian" was first
published in and the present
editor-in-ohief is C. Kellev Harden
