# ANGELL EXPLAINS PLANS
## HOARD OF CONTROL UNABLE TO BUILD BLEACHERS. Financial Situation Necessitates Aid From the Student Hotly To Make Up Deficit. 
### 
Apropos of the proposed campaign
to raise funds from the Student Body
by popular subscription, with which
to construct the new track bleach
ers, Dr. Angell, chairman of the
Board of Control contributes a com
munication to this issue of the Daily
Palo Alto in which he clearly ex
plains the financial position of that
body.
The collectors appointed by Pres
ident A. A. Murphy will be an
nounced tomorrow and as soon as
these men receive their receipt books
they will begin an active campaign
to raise the money desired to com
plete the project.
Dr. Angell's letter follows:
Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
The cost of duplicating the pres
ent bleachers upon the track will
probably be about $2700. To meet
such an outlay the Board of Control
has practically no funds, as the
$1200 at its command will just about
meet its indebtedness for money bor
rowed to build the old bleachers.
Owing to the general financial strin
gency the Board can no longer bor
row from the banks, though the bank
is ready to carry over the notes of
the Board until next November.
Accordingly the Board is willing
to advance $1000 or $1100 toward
the new bleachers and if the students
can raise an equal amount in cash to
put with this the Board will start
in on the work of construction as
soon as it can receive bids and award
contracts. The remaining $500 or
$600 due on the contracts could in
all probability be satisfactorily fi
nanced. Anyhow, the Board is ready
to undertake the work if it has
$2100 on hand. The present bleach
ers will seat about one-half of those
whom we may reasonably expect to
attend the big track meet.
