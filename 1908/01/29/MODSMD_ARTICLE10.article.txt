# NEW PLANS FOR "QUAD"
## COMMITTEE WILL SUBMIT A SCHEME TO CLASS. If Proposal Meets With Approval, Sophomores May Nominate "Quad" Officers Tomorrow. 
### 
The committee appointed to in
vestigate better methods of control
ling (he managership of the "Quad"
will make its first report at the
| meeting of the Sophomore class to
morrow at 1:10. While the primary
| purpose of the meeting is to consider
this report, it is probable that, in
ase any definite conclusion is reach
! Ed in regard to this matter, the nom
inations for manager and editor of
the 1910 year book will be made
i jit, that time.
The work of the committee thus
far has been largely confined to an
! investigation as to the costs and rev
enues connected with the issue of
the book, in an attempt to obtain a
definite working basis upon which
Ito compute some superior method
|of management or control. Suita
ble figures have been placed at the
disposal of the committee by Mana
ger Theile, of the 190N annual,
! which will enable the committee to
! submit some definite proposition for
! the approval of the class at the
| meeting tomorrow.
Although a very short time still
remains before the nomination of
j "Quad" officers, there are as yet
very few avowed candidates in the
field, and there has been no such
political stir as was occasioned last
year when there were five candi
dates carrying on an active cam
paign for the editorship fully a
week before the nominations. How
-1 ever, there is considerable interest
in the contest and plenty of candi-
I dates are expected to appear when
nominations are in order.
