Yesterday afternoon was the first

and practice. They availed them
selves of the opportunity of a little
clear weather and some very lively
sets were indulged in. Due to the
inclement weather, the courts have
been in an unfit, condition for play,
and the continuing of the interclass
doubles tournament from last semes

The following players were seen
on the courts yesterday and some
hard practicing ensued: P. T*. Del
