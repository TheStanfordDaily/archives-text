The .Junior class has offered sev
enty-five dollars this year as a prize
i'or the writers of the hest. original
opera to be presented in connection
with the Junior Day festivities. This
is a larger prize than is generally of
fered and yet the committee is not
aware of any unusual activity among
those who might be expected to com
pete in such a contest, it. appears in
I his regard that within recent years
the prizes for class operas and farces
have been continually increased with
out any additional increase in the
number of manuscripts submitted. A
few years ago there was far more in
terest, shown in this branch of col
lege activities and the honor of being
the authors of the class farces or
operas was keenly appreciated. Whe
ther the scarcity of contestants with
in more recent times is due to a lack
of talent, in this direction, or a lack
of interest, is a matter of conjecture.
But the fact remains that there
should certainly be more competition
for such prizes. We are unwilling to
believe that a lack of talent in the
dramatic line at. Stanford is tne
cause of this falling off in the num
ber of competitors for the prize
farces and operas. Consequently it
must be a lack of interest. And we
hope to see this attitude changed to
ward this year's Junior and Senior
productions.
