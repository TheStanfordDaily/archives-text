# Enlarging Piping System.

### 
With a view of bettering the facil
ities for fighting fire on the Campus,
I lie system of pipes, which feeds the
emergency hydrants, is being re
placed by new and considerably lar- j
ger piping. When the improvements
now under way are completed, a
twelve-inch water main several miles ■
long will have been laid in place of
the old four-inch pipe, thereby secur
ing added pressure and a much lar
ger stream of water than formerly.
Owing to the fact that the work nun l
he done by sections, it is improbable j
that the new system will be in work
ing order before the latter part of
this semester.
