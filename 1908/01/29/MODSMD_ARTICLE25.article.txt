# Chicago Captains Must Sign Bond.
## 
### 
Following a new precedent, Wal
ter Steffens, captain-elect of the Chi
cago University football team, was
forced to sign a bond that, he would
remain in college until he gradu
ated. It is hoped that this provision
will prevent some men from attend
ing the University merely to play
football. It is said to have been in
spired by the fact that Eckefsall, the
famous drop-kicker, gave up his
work as soon as his last game was
played.
