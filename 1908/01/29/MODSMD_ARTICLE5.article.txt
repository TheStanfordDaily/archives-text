# INTERSCHOLASTIC PLANS
## HOARD OF GOVERNORS WILL MEET NEXT WEEK. Proposed Addition of the Discus Throw to Meet Will Be Discussed. 
### 
The first meeting of the Board of
Governors of the Stanford Univer
sity Interscholastic Athletic Associ-j
I ation will probably be held the early
' part of next week. As Secretary C.
| P. Laumeister, who held this office j
I during the past two years, is not ex-
I pected to return to college this
! spring, it will be necessary to elect
| a new secretary. This action will i
be taken at the next meeting of the I
Governors.
President .1. (). Miller, 'on, of the
Interscholastic Association, is plan
ning to get the first announcements
of the meet out early this year and
Ihe anticipates an unusually large !
number of entries, as the contest is !
to be held on the first Saturday in j
May. There has been some consid- I
eration as to the advisability of in- j
eluding the discus throw as one of
the events in the interscholastic
meet. .1. C. Macfarland, '07, who
was president of the Interscholastic
Association last year, believes that
I this event would be a valuable ad
j Tition to the meet. As several j
chools have asked that the discus i
| trow be included, the matter will !
Ie ' e discussed by the Board of Gov- j
I "mors. It is not likely that the I
| ew event will be added until next
v t ar, as it would give the schools 1
an advantage which already have 1
the discus throw. And the repre- i
-entatives of the preparatory schools, !
who meet on the night of the con
test, may express their opinions up
on the addition of this event.
