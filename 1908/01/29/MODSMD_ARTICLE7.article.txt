# ARE BUSY WITH OPERAS
## STANFORD PEOPLE WRITING FOR 1909. Harry James and George Lask Are Now Being Considered as Coaches by Committee, 
### 
To the knowledge of the Junior
Opera committee there are two op
eras, and a possible third, now in
preparation to be handed to the com
mittee by February 1. One of these
is to be the result of co-operation
on the part of three well-known
Stanford people, while the other is
leing written by a Junior. This in
formation was brought to light in
the fust meeting of the opera com
mittee, which was held yesterday af
ternoon.
Two coaches for the Junior pro
duction are already being consid
ered. Harry James, of the Princess
Theater, San Francisco, who success
fully superintended the staging of
the football show last semester, and
George Lask, now of the Idora Park
Opera Company and many years
connected with the Tivoli Opera
House in San Francisco, are the man
agers whom the committee has in
mind. Chairman L. Roberts and
G. X. Richardson of the committee
will visit these men in San Fran
cisco and Oakland next Saturday.
They will talk over the proposition
of coaching the opera to be given
here and will try to come to terms
with one of the managers.
Names are being received daily, by
lhe committee, of those persons who
wish to try for principal or chorus
parts. Over thirty are now on hand.
Among the names received are sev
eral persons of recognized ability at
the University, who have often won
applause in college productions in
Assembly Hall. The committee is
also endeavoring to gain new mater
ial among a large number of pos
sibilities, particularly in the Junior
class.
The opera committee adjourned
yesterday afternoon to meet next
Monday at i o'clock at the Pi Heta
Phi house, when one of the operas
now in preparation will be read and
discussed.
