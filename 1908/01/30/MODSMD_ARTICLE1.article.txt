# ADOPT NEW "QUAD" PLAN
## SOPHOMORES ACCEPT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE. All Money Will Be Devoted To Production of a Fine Year Book. 
### 
At a meeting of the Sophomore
class this afternoon, the report of
the "Quad" committee was read and
accepted. The nomination of officers
was postponed until tomorrow. In
the new management of the book,
as was adopted by the class today,
a board of directors will have to
be nominated and voted for at the
regular election. The plan adopted
by the class is one which has never
been tried at Stanford before. In
the new publication of the book, the
editor and manager are put on a
strictly honor system, where in for
mer years the manager took 'the
whole responsibility and received
the profits. The manager will not
receive any compensation but will
be allowed all necessary expenses.
II is the intention of the class to
reduce the assessment on the mem
bers and allow them to purchase the
annual at the reduced rate of $1.50.
The departure from the old sys
tem of managing the "Quad" will
call for an editor and manager, who
are willing to give their personal
time and services to the class in
directing the year book. After the
committee presented this report it
was adopted by a good-sized major
ity. Tomorrow nominations will be
made for "Quad" manager and edi
tor. The summary of the plan is
as follows:
The editor and manager of the
book are placed upon a strictly hon
or basis, receiving no compensation
beyond legitimate expenses, while
the class assumes the financial res
ponsibility through a board of di
rectors which shall act as the rep
resentatives of the class in dealing
with the manager.
The board of directors, five in
number, to be elected by the class,
will confer with the editor and
manager on questions of editorial or
financial policy which would affect
the size, character or financial suc
cess of the book and the ultimate
authority in these matters is vested
in the board, which will also approve
the expense vouchers of the mana
ger.
The manager is primarily respon
sible for the success of the book and
has full control of the management
subject to the control of the board of
directors in matters of policy involv
ing its financial success. He will
keep accounts according to the Uni
ted States voucher system, keep his
books ready for auditing, and sub
mit expense vouchers to the board
for approval.
The committee also recommended
a reduction of the "Quad" assess
ment to $3.00 and the auditing of
the complete accounts of the reve
nues and expenditures of the book
by an expert accountant.
While it is the purpose of the plan
to put as much of the revenue into
the book as possible, any profit
which may accrue is to be turned
into the class treasury.
