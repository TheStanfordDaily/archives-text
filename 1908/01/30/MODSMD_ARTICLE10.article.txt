The Sophomore class is to be con
gratulated upon the adoption of a
new system for controlling the
"Quad." This innovation is a long
step in the right direction and there
seems every reason to believe that.
I he 1910 annual will be edited and
managed upon a. basis which will
bring the best, results as well as as
suring satisfaction to the class and
everybody else concerned. Under
the new system practically nil the 1
money will go into the book and the
result should be an improvement in

the "Quad." By adopting this new
plan of directing the production of
its annual, 1910 showed that it was
the wish of the class to get out the
best possible "Quad," and that no
effort or personal sacrifice would be
spared in the work of producing a
representative class book.
