# WOMEN'S CONFERENCE MEETS.
## An Appeal Will Be Made To Improve Desk Service at the Library. 
### 
A most successful meeting of the
President's Conference of Women
was held last night at the home of
Dr. Jordan, with a complete attend
ance of members. There was a live
ly discussion of many important is
sues, followed by the appointment
of several committees to investigate
and report at the next meeting.
A committee of two was chosen
to confer with Mr. Buehrer, the or
ganist, about the music for Memor
ial Church. The church will be op
en for services in August, and plans
for a choir to be composed of stu
dents are now being made. A cre
dit will probably be given for the
work.
Complaints were received in re
gard to the desk service in the Lib
rary and a committee was appoint
ed to consult with the Head Librar
ian upon practical plans for im
provement.
Word was received from the Post
master General that it will be impos
sible to place a mail box on the
Quad.
