the pair-oar are in use, which al
lows six men to be at the oars at
the same time. The four-oared shell
has not been used yet as the water
lias not reached the level of the
float. The water would probably
have come up to the required height
by today, if the stream had not been
temporarily turned off yesterday.

Club, received a telephone message
today from St. Joseph's Hospital to
