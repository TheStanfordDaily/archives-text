In order to build the track bleach
ers it is necessary that approximate
ly a thousand dollars should be
raised by popular subscription
among the members of the Student
Body. At the present time the
Board of Control is not in a finan
cial condition to meet the necessary
expense and consequently it is up
to the Student Body to come for
ward with sufficient funds to con
struct. the bleachers. President
Murphy has appointed a large num
ber of collectors whose duty it will
be to secure subscriptions from
members of the Student Body. Ow
ing to the fact that neither the
Student Body Treasurer nor the
Board of Control is in a position to
meet this expense it is essential that
the students should make a volun
tary contribution. The new bleach
ers for the track are an absolute
necessity, as the present accommo
dations would be utterly insufficient
for the crowd that will attend the
intercollegiate meet, which is to be
held here this spring. For the sake
of having first-class accommodations
at the new track and as a matter of
loyalty to Stanford, every member
of the Student Body should respond
to this appeal.
