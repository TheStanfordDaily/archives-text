### 
At a meeting of the Sophomore
class this afternoon, F. A. Adams
was nominated by W. P. Fuller, Jr..
for the editorship of the 1910 year
hook. When President Ehrhorn call
ed for the nominations for manager,
there was a shuttle of feet and three
men stood up at the same time for
the first place on the ballot list. C.
F. Ganong was the first to receive j
recognition and he placed in nomina- j
tion the name of C. W. Mason, of San |
Francisco. E. 0. Templeton nomina- I
ted H. H. Maundrell, of San Francis
co, and M..M. Mitchell named L. 15.
Mackey, of Los Angeles. The elec
tion will be held next Thursday.
E. A. Melczer made a motion that
the present committee who formulat
ed the plans for the "Onad" bp re- i
tained as the board of directors for
the "Quad." This motion was ,
brought before the class and passed. '
The report of the "Quad" commit
tee, which had been accepted yes
terday.was formally adopted by a
large majority. Before the adoption
of the report a great deal of discus
sion was brought before the class.
The meeting was notable for the dis
cussion between two factions of the
class, one representing the adoption
of the report oi the "Quad" commit- :
tee aud the other held the nega
tive. The first negative speaker was j
D. D. Gammon, who argued that \
the manager should receive some
compensation, and that a better year
book could be gotten out with a
manager who should receive some
benefit for his services other than
the honor that was attached to the
office. B. F. Bickel held the affirm
ative, and said that as no
real argument against the pro
posed system had been put forth, he
would like to hear some discussion
on this subject. S. J. Talbot was
the next speaker for the negative,
and his main argument was, that the
class could not get as good a year
book with a manager that did not
receive any compensation. W. E.
Hettman argued that the class was j
paying an honor to a man by elect
ing him manager of the book and j
that enough class spirit and unity
prevailed to get out the best "Quad"
that has ever been published in Stan
ford University. As a climax to the
debate, E. M. Leaf made a strong j
appeal to the class to adopt there- [
port of the committee as was ac- j
cepted by the ( lass yesterday. In ;
short he said, "The committee has |
considered this question very ser
iously. Members of the Faculty and |
some upperclassmen have been con- !
suited, and they all agree that this
is the most feasible plan. T believe
that there are fifty men in this class
who would be willing to take the
managership of the 'Quad.' " After
a few minutes of hesitation the ques
tion was put before the class and was
adopted by a large majority.
