Although the Sophomore class ac
cepted the report of the "Quad" com
mittee yesterday, which proposed a
radical change in the system of man
aging the annual, the proposition was
again brought before the class at to
day's meeting, upon the plea that
an acceptance of the report of tlx
committee was not an adoption oi
tlie plan presented. As a result the
proposed plan was thoroughly dis
cussed at the meeting this afternoon
and the class voted by a large ma
jority to put the control of the book
under the system proposed by the
committee. This action is a radical
change, but. no class at Stanford
within recent years has made a move
which promises to do as much good
toward developing a spirit for the
doing of things for tlie sake of the
class and the University, without any
desire for personal remuneration. II
is a fine position that lias been tak
en by the Sophomore class and one
lor which the class deserves great
credit.
