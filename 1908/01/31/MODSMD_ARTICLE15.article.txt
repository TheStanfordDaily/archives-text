# Remove Remains of Statue.

### 
The remains of the statue of the
j "Angel of Grief" have been moved
| from the place where the statue for
merly stood, into the Museum. The
statue, made of the rarest Italian
marble, was erected by the late Mrs.
Stanford in memory of her brother,
Henry C. Lathrop. The earthquake
of 19(16 shattered the figure, and as
souvenir seekers were mutilating the
remains, they have been placed iti
the Museum for safe keeping.
