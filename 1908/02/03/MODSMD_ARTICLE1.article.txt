# MOULTON WELL PLEASED
## TRAINER SAYS FIRST MEET WAS GREAT SUCCESS. Work of the Freshmen Is Especially Appreciated.—Detailed Summary of Events. 
### 
The results of the handicap meet
held last Friday demonstrated that
there is plenty of good material in
the track squad and that, the men
are already getting into fairly good
condition. The performances were
of an unusually good order for the
opening of the season and inspire
the hope that records may be brok
en on the Stanford oval this spring.
Practically every man fought gamely
to the end of his race and close and
exciting finishes were the order of
the day.
The Freshmen showed up especial
ly well and figured prominently in
nearly every event, so that both cap
tain and trainer are well pleased
with the prospects of turning out a
successful Freshman team.
"Dad" Moulton was more than sat
isfied with results of the meet and
praised the men highly for showing
such strong fighting qualities so early
in the season. In speaking of the
showing made, he said: "There never
was such an array of talent available
for track work since I have been at
Stanford. But. what. 1 especially like
to see is the 'scrappy' way in which
the men go into their events. Ev
ery man fights his best and that is
what wins races. It was a great
meet, and,"he added enthusiastic
ally. "I am proud to be the trainer
of such a bunch of men."
