### 
Professor A. T. Murray, of the
Greek department, delivered the Sun
day sermon in the Chapel, Dr. Gard
ner being at Santa Clara.
Professor Murray's sermon dealt
with the comparison of the ideas of
worship of Hebrews, Christians and
heathens. Hebrews, he said, wore
after sain in their religious worship,
such as immunity from sin and an ad
vantage over others. "Christians are
too inclined toward the view taken
by the Jews," said the preacher, "al
though the present-day idea of re
ligious worship is not a means of
getting personal advantage but a
means of service."
