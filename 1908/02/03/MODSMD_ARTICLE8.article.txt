# APPOINT WOMEN'S DEAN
## TRUSTEES NAME STANFORD GRADUATE FOR PLACE. Mrs. Allen To Have General Control of Women Students.â€”Trustees To Meet Friday. 
### 
As a result of a wish expressed by
Mrs. Stanford shortly before her
i death, the Board of Trustees have ap
pointed Mrs. Evelyn Wight Alien, '96,
|to be the Dean of Women of the
University. She is to enter upon her
duties next September. The appoint
ment of Mrs. Allen marks a decided
change in tlie policy of the universi
ty authorities. Hitherto, students at
Stanford have been allowed absolute
personal freedom, no supervision in
personal matters ever having been
maintained before.
Mrs. Allen's duties will be largely
of an advisory nature, and she will
have general supervision over all the
women's activities, social and athlet
ic, as well as over their scholarship.
She will act as personal adviser to
all who need her help and will endea
vor to promote and encourage the
j various activities in which the wo
| men are interested. She will have
no authority to make any binding
| regulations, but will act as interme
! diary between the women and the
Faculty, bringing before the latter
body any suggestions or changes
which she believes to be advisable.
Mrs. Allen graduated from Stan
ford with the Class of 1596, and
was known as Evelyn Wight while
in college. She is at present a teach
er in the English department of the
Brooklyn High School and is secre
tary of the High School Teachers'
Association of New York State.
Hon. Whitelaw Reid, embassador
to England, who is also a trustee of
the University, was present at the
meeting of the board, this being the
first meeting that he has attended
for several years. The Trustees will
hold a special meeting on Friday to
take action on the proposed annex
ation of Cooper Medical College. The
project has been under considera
tion for some time, the details of
the plan having been practically all
arranged. Nothing now remains ex
cept the final decision.
