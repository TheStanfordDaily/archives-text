started yesterday afternoon and for

sult of the performances last Friday
afternoon. This list is neither final
or complete, but will be changed or
added to as the occasion may war
rant. Trainer Moulton will keep a
close watch on the work of all the
men now on the rubbing table and
any of the doubtful ones who fail
to come up to expectations will not
bo retained for any length of time
The number will be increased from
time to time as the individual men
demonstrate in the trials that their
work is up to the required standard.

ble meet is scheduled to begin at
4 o'clock. On this occasion every
event will be held twice, the varsity
men competing in one contest and.
