Iii the first list of athletes who
have been placed on the rubbing list
by Trainer Moulton it is most en
couraging to note the large number
of Freshman track candidates who
have already shown ability. From
the showing made by the Freshmen
in the handicap meet last Friday
there appear to be several unusual
ly strong athletes in the entering
class, and the prospects for a win
ning team in the intercollegiate
Freshman meet are good. However,
the number of Freshmen entered in
the distance and weight events is
notably small and it is in these de
partments that California is strong.
It is therefore the duty of every
Freshman, who has had the slightest
experience or who is physically qual
ified, to come out for track work,
and particularly for the events in
which the first-year men are weak.
The meet with the California
Freshmen this spring will be the
third intercollegiate Freshman meet
that has been held. The first two
were won by the Blue and Gold and
i! is up to the present Freshman
class to break this hoodoo. With
the large number of good men to
start the season there is no reason
why the Freshmen should not have
a winning team. Hut every Fresh
man is needed out on the track to
attain this result.
