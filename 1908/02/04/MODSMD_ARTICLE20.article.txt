# STANFORD CLUB GROWING
## JINKS IN SAN FRANCISCO PROVES SUCCESS. Organization Has One Hundred and Sixty-Six Members.â€”Will Now Incorporate. 
### 
The Stanford Club of San Fran
cisco is growing rapidly in numbers
and the prospect of the jinks brought
ilie paid enrollment up to 128 by the
evening of January 31, the time of
the first jinks. Thirty more signed
and paid that night and the mail op
ened Monday showed that enough
others had sent in their fees and
dues to make the membership 166
up to the end of January. Every day
is bringing in more voluntary re
cruits.
The jinks drew ninety-one Stan
ford men, numerically the largest
gathering of Stanford men ever held
anywhere away from the University.
Only half the actual members of the
club attended, which indicates some
thing of the difficulty of getting
young business and family men to
gether even where everything is free
and the entertainment is supposed
to be inviting.
But the complete success of the
jinks and the absolute informality
and good nature of the crowd stamp
ed this form of entertainment as a
winner. The club will hereafter give
a free jinks once a month. Archie
Rice, '95, has been appointed per
manently to head jinks committee,
and Charles K. Field, '95, one of
the best toastmasters in San Fran
cisco, will continue to preside as
jinks master.
Both the older and the younger
Stanford men freely declared the in
itial jinks was the finest and jolliest
affair they had ever attended. Next
time they will need no coaxing to
come, and the Stanford jinks will be
worth cutting out other things to see.
By the middle of February the
club expects to have enrolled 250
paid members, because jinks talk has
aroused wide interest. The club has
more than $440 in the treasury, no
indebtedness, and it is to be incor
porated this week.
A big jinks will be given the night
before the intercollegiate field meet.
