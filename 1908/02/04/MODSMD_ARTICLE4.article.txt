"In order to correct, the absurd
newspaper stories that have been
published since my alleged disap
pearance, about 'suicide,' 'walking
home from college,' 'heroic struggle
for education,' etc., etc., let me state
that they are absolute 'tommy-rot.'
There are plenty of people at col
lege who knew why I did not return
and their negligence has caused me
an endless amount of trouble. I
have not stayed out this semester
from any necessity whatsoever, but
from a personal decision rather too
sacred to publish. Whoever started
these stories did it.from pure conjec
ture and without consulting anyone.
T shall return in August, but any
one wishing to communicate with
me can do so at Los Angeles.
