# PLANS FOR NEW BLEACHERS.
## Hoard of Control Will Call For Kids Tomorrow.â€”Cost Estimated at About $2500. 
### 
Plans for the new track bleachers
are now almost completed and will
Ibe open for inspection tomorrow
| when the Board of Control will call
i for bids on the construction.
The specifications call for bleachers
which are almost the exact dupli
cate of those already constructed on
the new track with a similar ar
rangement of entrances and ticket
windows, and a seating capacity of
2500.
The new bleachers will be situated
across the track from those built
last year, and will thus face the
head of the back stretch of the track.
This location will necessitate the re
moval of the large eucalyptus trees
now inside the field, but will not in
terfere with those outside the fence.
Owing to the fall in the price of
materials the new bleachers will cost
considerably less than the old ones
the estimated total falling below
$2500, while the former price was
above $2 700.
