# DATE FOR JUNIOR DAY
## COMMITTEE NAMES MARCH 27 FOR FESTIVITIES. Manuscripts for Opera Which Will Be Produced By 1909 Are Considered. 
### 
Junior Day will be March 2 7. This
is the date definitely set by the com
mittee, and, as is customary, the
day comes on the last Friday ot' the
month. This is the regular time i'or
the Junior festivities, the chief rea
son for holding them on a different
day last year being the fact that the
last Friday coincided with a hob
day.
A great attraction for Junior Day
will be the intercollegiate track and
field meet against Pomona, which
will be held in the afternoon. Aquat
ic sports will be on the program in
the morning. The committee plans
to arrange tilting contests, canoe
races and other events to be of an
interclass nature. The Junior Prom
will be danced on the evening of that,
day.
Thursday evening, the night be
fore Junior Day, will be given over
to the opera, and plans for the pro
duction are gradually taking shape.
Yesterday afternoon the opera com
mittee read two manuscripts, and
listened to some of the music sub
mitted. The committee is awaiting
the submission of a third opera,
which is expected to be on hand
within a few days.
It is possible that the committee
will not make its final decision un
til the advice of a coach has been
secured. As yet it is undecided whe
ther a professional opera or a local
production will be presented next
month. Both Harry James of the
Princess Theater in San Francisco,
and George Lask of the Idora Park
Opera Company were seen Saturday.
Although one of these men will be
selected to coach the opera, each one
desires information as to details of
the opera which the class will pro
duce. It is probable that these can
be furnished within a week.
