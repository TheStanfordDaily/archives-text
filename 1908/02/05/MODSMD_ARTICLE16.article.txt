### 
The 1910 "Quad" election will be

three men are contesting for the
manager's position. The candidates
who will be voted upon by the Sopho
mores tomorrow are: C. W. Mason,
H. H. Maundrell, and L. B. Mackey.

excitement as was caused last spring
when there was an exciting contest

terest in the new system of managing
the "Quad" and the fact that there
are three men running for the posi
