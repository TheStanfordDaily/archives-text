# Rowell Urges Reform in Politics
## Speaker Says Democracy is on Trial And University Men Must Preserve it. 
### 
Chester 11. Howell, the well-known
editor of the Fresno "Republican,"
[ and one of the founders and present
I secretary of the Lincoln-Roosevelt
j League of Republican Clubs of Cali
! fornia, was the speaker at the Assem
j bly held this morning under the aus
' uices of the Social Service Club. His
! address was one of the strongest and
i most interesting heard here in some
time. He dealt with politics in this
state and also with the Japanese sit
uation. He declared that the uni
i versitv man must he prepared to help
| the commonwealth withstand one of
1 the biggest crises of history, and
made a stirring appeal for univer
sity men to lead in the reform move
ment.
In telling of democracy, Itowell
said: "Everybody questions democ
racy. Fourth-of-July spread-eagle
ism has gone out of fashion.
Democracy really is on trial; and j
the trial is to take place in Califor- !
ilia this generation, and you young j
gentlemen of the universities will ,
largely determine how that, trial
goes. The final test, not of democ- I
racy merely, but of Occidental insti
tutions, is to be worked out here and
now; in this place and at this time
where at last the white man's world
and the brown man's world have
come in contact. Xo more vital is
sue was determined at Thermopylae
than the one we in California must
determine, and determine now. What
Greece is to history, California is
to prophecy, and this is its critical
i
| age.
Then he spoke of the corruptness
of the state legislature and said: "It
is no secret that democracy just now
is very much of a failure in Califor
j ilia. It broke down in our chief city
| and we were saved from anarchy on
j ly by a usurped autocracy."
"The legislative department of
! our state government is a roaring
farce. Only saved from tragedy by
jits utter helplessness. The execu
i five department of our state govern
| ment is dictated by the hired ser

vant, of a foreign corporation. 1
am not guessing this, I can prove it.
Our judicial department of our state
government is under suspicion and
some of that suspicion is just. Our
very sense of right and wrong, of
crime and innocence has given way
to class feeling. There is not a busi
ness man in California that doubts
Patrick Calhoun bribed Abe Ruef.
But there are thousands of men that
want him acquitted of the charge
partly because they do not feel that
such bribery is wrong and partly
because they feel that. Calhoun
should be rewarded for his victory
in a class war which they were too
cowardly to fight for themselves. All
together the California reformer who,
after forty years of work for the peo
ple, proclaims popular government a
farce, was not so far wrong. As <t
is now operating in California it is
a farce. It. is ours not merely to
preserve democracy, but to restore
it."
"And here conies the task of the
university man. Yours is the task
of optimism. You know there is
such a thing as unselfish public spir
it. Manifest it yourselves and rec
ognize it in others. When some Ru
dolph Spreckels devotes life and for
tune to the public good, you at least
shall not. be of those to say that
such devotion is not in human na
ture. And the public opinion of
such as you must sustain the public,
works of such as he. When the men
of your social class see no hope ex
cept in the extermination of the la
bor union, you shall see that the
hope even of your class is in the pro
gress of the labor union, and yon
shall be practical politicians, soldiers
of democracy swearing that, so
help you God, democracy shall not
fail. It will not. fail, if you fight
for it hard enough, but if it does
fail in your state and in your genera
tion, if will have failed for all the
world forever. The past is your her
itage: the present and the future are
in your keeping. See that you fail
not. in the trust."
