when returning home early this mor
ning he entered the wrong housa.
Mrs. Uhlman hearing a strange noise
went to the door and there perceived
a stranger. Closing the door she
aroused her husband, who reached
for bis 2 2-caliber rifle and went to
the door. After calling several times
and receiving no response, Uhlman
fired and struck the unfortunate stu
dent in the head above the left eye.
As soon as help could be secured the
injured man was removed to the
Guild Hospital, where he expired two
hours later.
Cooley is the son of Charles M.
Cooley, a newspaper man of Kalis
pell, Montana, and was always re
garded as a most industrious student.
He was a Junior in the Electrical
Engineering department.
Uhlman, who did the shooting, is

tragedy is the fact that the two Stan

who were drowned last, summer,
were also from Kalispell.
