bate but, owing to the absence of
Professors Alden and Gayley from
the state, a specially appointed com
mittee will perform that duty on this
occasion. The question will be an
nounced to the contestants two
hours before the regular debate,
when they will designate the side
which they wish to uphold. Lots
will he drawn to determine the or
der of speaking. Should all three
representatives from one college
chance to find themselves opposed
to the entire team of the other, lots
must be drawn to decide the respec
tive sides to be argued by the two
teams.
Professor Bacon has not thus far
made public the names of the men
who will judge the contest.
The team that represents Stan
ford combines all the elements es
sential to Carnot debates, all three
of the members being especially
strong as extemporaneous speakers.
.1. E. Shelton is a forcible, convin
cing speaker and in all of his de
hates displays a thorough grasp of
I.is material. His delivery is exceed
ingly calm and deliberate. W. C.
Shelton has a strong delivery and I lie
ability to minimize the weight of his
opponent's argument. He served on
the last Carnot. team. Boyd is a care
ful delater and possesses the faculty
of presenting his facts in a logical
and persuasive manner.. Xewland,
the alternate, is an experienced and
fluent talker. He was the alternate
on the 1 907 intercollegiate team.
California is fortunate in having
two Carnot veterans on her team. M.
E. Harrison and S. Macneil, both hav
ing been competitors for the medal
which was won by W. F. Herron, of
Stanford. Macneil last year won the
Ilonnheim prize. H. D. Hoover, the
other Blue and Gold contestant, has
been prominent in class debating af
fairs. Peixotto, who will alternate,
was a member of the last California
Carnot team.
The Carnot medal is given each
year by the Baron de Coubertin in
honor of Sadi Carnot, the martyred
president of France, with the provis

ion that the topic under discussion
shall always refer to some plan or
policy of the French government.
Carnot contests inaugurated by Bar
on Coubertin are held annually at
Princeton and Tulane universities,
under similar conditions, but the de
bate between Stanford and Califor
nia is the only instance where two
universities participate in the con
test. Team work is not a factor in
the award of the medal and individ
ual merit, alone is considered.
