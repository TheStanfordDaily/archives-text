As the baseball season is now fair
ly started it seems advisable to call
the attention of the Student Rody to
necessity of supporting ihe team in
these preliminary games. There
should be a good crowd on the
bleachers at these games, not only
becaus:' iiu> management has been
successful in arranging games with
teams that furnish high-class base
ball, but also for the sake of show
ing appreciation of the work of the
men who are representing Stanford.
And from a financial standpoint the
expense of bringing visiting teams to
the Campus should be met by a large
attendance at these games.
