# Course For Olympic Run Chosen.
## 
### 
The course for the two-mile run
of the Olympic Club on February
22 was selected yesterday. It will
not be held on the roads of Golden
Gate Park, as in former years, but
will be in the newly-completed sta
dium; partly on the cycle track and
partly on the regular quarter-mile
track.
