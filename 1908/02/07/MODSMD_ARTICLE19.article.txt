## California Athletes Form Large Squad with Plenty of Good Material.â€”Stanton in Hurdles. 
### 
Track work at California has bean
considerably handicapped by the re
cent wet weather which has prevent
ed training on the cinder path, but
a large squad is training whenever
the. condition of the track permits, i
Over one hundred and eighty men
have signed training rules which
went into effect on Monday, and it
is probable that this number will be
still further augmented by the ad
dition of several more freshmen as j
soon as the rule excusing them from
gymnasium work goes into effect.
Trainer Christie has expressed
himself as well pleased with the ma- \
terial available from which to devel
op his varsity men and expects to
turn out a strong team.
Captain Stanton, who has hereto
fore devoted his attention to the I
sprints and the 440-yard dash, if
now practicing over the low hurdles >
and expects to enter that event in
the intercollegiate meet. He won
both the high and low hurdles in the
fall P. A. A. meet with a handicap
and shows promise of becoming a
strong hurdler.
It is reliably reported that Munn,
the former Oakland star, is again
registered in college and will be eli
gible to compete on the T3lue and
Gold freshman team. Munn took
the greatest number of points
in the interscholastic meet last
spring and will prove a formidable
competitor in the freshman meet in
March.
Another valuable addition to the
California squad is that of A1 Evers,
from Berkeley High School, who
placed second to Munn in the high
jump at the interscholastic meet two
years ago, when he cleared 5 feet i
9 1-2 inches.
California has lost Horace Donnell,
who competed in the sprints last |
year, but has now accepted a posi
tion as coach of the Los Angeles
High School team, upon the resigna
tion of L. M. Edwards, '07.
