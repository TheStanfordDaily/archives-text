# TENNIS MEN AT WORK
## INTERCLASS DOUBLES WILL BE PLAYED SOON. Several New Men Are Showing Varsity Form and Tryouts Will Be Interesting. 
### 
During the last few days the ten
j nis players have availed themselves
j of the opportunity of a little clear |
weather and they are practicing very i
i hard to get into condition for the j
| intercollegiate tryouts.
The players are now rounding in- ;
J to better form and some very lively !
j matches have been witnessed by the
onlookers the last few days. The in
' terclass doubles, which were post
| poned from last semester, will be
played in about two weeks. This j
will give the men plenty of oppor
tunity to get into condition, provid- j
jed there is clear weather, and then |
'the tennis season will commence in
| earnest. After thi? doubles tourna
ment the tryouts for the intercol
legiate team will commence and
j some very lively competition may be
looked for, from those who are seek
i iiig places on the team.
Some of the new men, who have
not played on an intercollegiate
team, are improving very steadily. It.
iA. Gott, 'OS, has been playing a
very consistent game lately and will
j make some of the older men hustle
for a place on the team. H. Mann,
'09, has improved a great deal since
last year and he is playing a much
stronger game. G. E. Dole, '0 8, is
|
a very aggressive player and his
! chances of representing Stanford are
bright. P. B. Delano, '08, A. .1.
! Gowan, '09, and 'I'. ('. Henry, '10.
are wielding their rackets regularly j
with the younger players and are
looking forward to the intercolle'.-
! iate tryouts.
The University of California will
in all probability be represented by
the Long brothers. Melville Long
is a former Coast champion and in
the latest ranking of the Pacific
Coast tennis players by the eastern
j experts he has been placed second.
Herbert Long is a former San Fran
{ cisco champion and this combination
of tennis stars will lie very hard to
beat.
