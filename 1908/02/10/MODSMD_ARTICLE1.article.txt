# MURPHY IS IMPROVING
## ROWING COACH EXPECTED IN THREE WEEKS. Is Anxious To Take Charge of Squad, Which May Go To Redwood Before His Arrival. 
### 
Coach Dan Murphy has been get
ting better every day for almost a
week and if the present rate of his I
recovery prevails he will be here to
take charge of rowing by March 1 at
the latest. Captain Gay saw Coach
Murphy yesterday at St. Joseph's
Hospital in San Francisco. The
coach is cheerful, has a bright look |
in his eye and seems to be getting
along well. His principal difficulty
is weakness from his long confine
ment to his bed.
That Murphy is improving is
shown by the fact that he now sits
up on pleasant days. "Last Wed- I
nesday," said the coach, "was the
first time I was up. I got in the j
wheel chair that day and was out
on the porch, taking the air for the
first time in two months. But I am
gradually regaining my strength and
hope to be down on the Campus in
three weeks."
Coach Murphy is receiving satis
factory care at St. Joseph's. He is
under the care of Dr. Hicewolt, and
his fever chart shows an encourag
ing record for the past few days. For
five days his temperature has been
normal or slightly below in the mor
ning, and has not risen above 100
at any time.
Murphy's appetite is near the nor
mal. He is on a diet, but one which
is not greatly restricted, as he is
allowed to partake of certain class
es of solid foods. Coach Murphy
expresses great anxiety to be on the
Campus and in charge of the rowing
men. From his words one can rea
dily understand that he misses be- :
ing away from Stanford so much that j
his confinement irritates him.
It is undecided whether any of ]
the training at Redwood City will be
started before Murphy's arrival here.
By that time, however, work will
be under way on the Redwood slough.
While it would be an advantage to
have a small squad doing work in
the eight oared shell, which will be!
brought to Redwood soon, the row- j
ing squad is now too large to al- '
low it. Twenty-seven Freshmen are
still out for rowing. Added to this I
,
number are twenty-one other men. j
which makes a total squad of forty- i
eight.
