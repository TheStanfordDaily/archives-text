# WOMEN JOIN FENCING CLASS.
## Thirty-One Names on List of Those Who Have Taken Up New Sport. 
### 
Work in fencing has begun in Ro
ble Gymnasium under the direction
of Major Burdett. Regular practice
will be held every Thursday after
noon at 4:45 and every Friday at
4:00. The hours have been arrang

ing laboratory work to enter the
class. Assistance will be given
through the week to anyone desiring
it, by Miss E. Russ.
Fencing will be considered reg

connection with field work, and there
will be no charge for instruction.
Thirty-one women have registered in
the class and there is every indica
tion that the sport will be success
fully established here.
