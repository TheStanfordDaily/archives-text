# "Californian" Resumes Publication.
## 
### 
After appearing in dodger form
during more than two weeks as the
result of financial difficulties, the
"Daily Californian" resumed its re
gular form in the issue on Thursday
of last week. The five hundred new
subscriptions necessary to establish
ing the paper on a sound financial
basis, and to its publication in the
future, have been obtained. A de
sire to properly support the "Cali
fornian" is now being manifested
by the students of the State Univer
sity and in all probability it will in
a short time become a student body
publication, managed and operated
by methods similar to those now in
vogue at Stanford.
