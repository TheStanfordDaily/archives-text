# PREACHES ON "FREEDOM."
## Dr. J. H. Lathrop Delivers Sunday Sermon From Pulpit in University Chapel. 
### 
Reverend John H. Lathrop, of the
Unitarian Church, Berkeley, preach
ed on "Religious Freedom" in the
Chapel yesterday morning. The topic
of his sermon was taken from the
book of St. Luke, and reads, "The
spirit of the Lord is upon me, be
cause he hath annointed me to preach
the gospel to the poor; he hath sent
me to heal the broken-hearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives,
and recovering of sight to the blind,
to set at liberty them that are
bruised."
"Religious Freedom" the preacher
defined as being freedom from con
finement to certain beliefs. The
preacher then went 011 to compare
political freedom with religious free
dom. and said, "We glory in the fact
that we have no restrictions—we
think this freedom. A country is
free when citizens are able to care
for themselves in the best possible
way, have sound judgment, noble de
sires, and sound reasoning. It is a
sacred mission that this country of
ours owes our neighbors and it would
have been a shame had we given
up the Philippines. A man is only
free when he can live above the law."
Dr. Lathrop closed his sermon by
saying that we should think first of
our integrity and see if our relig
ious confidence has grown or with
ered. No man who has not suffered
and bled for freedom knows what
true freedom is.
