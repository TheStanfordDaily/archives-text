Before an audience that complete

evening was awarded the Carnot.
medal for 190N. Shelton's main
speech was ;i brilliant and masterly
exposition of the subject under dis
cussion, displaying an intimate
knowledge of French internal and
foreign affairs. The particular top
ic submitted to the contestants from
the general field, "France and Mo
rocco," was "Resolved, That France
should prepare to revert to the pol
icy of Delcasse in regard to Morocco
on the expiration of the Algeciras
Conventions." The winner of the
medal is a veteran of the 1 907 Car
not team and a member of the Del
ta Chi legal fraternity. He regis
ters in the Law department from San
Jose. The judges of the contest, who
were former congressman John P.
Irish, Raphael Weill, Knight of the
Legion of Honor, and Alexander Mc-
Adie, Chief of the Coast Weather
Bureau, deliberated eighteen min
utes before arriving at their decision,
which was unanimous. Shelton's
winning of the Carnot makes the
first time in five years that the
medal has been bestowed upon a
contestant away from his home col
lege.
The specific topic for the debate,
which was selected by a committee
composed of Professors Bacon, Fla
herty and Wells, of the University
of California, and Professors Duni
wav and Huston, of Stanford, was
read to the debaters in California
Hall at six o'clock. Macneil, of Cal
ifornia, alone chose to uphold the
affirmative, and as this left the three
Stanford representatives on the
same side, contrary to the Carnot re
gulations. Boyd agreed to join Mac
neil on the affirmative side. The
drawing of lots to determine the or
der of speaking resulted as follows:
Affirmative, I). ('. Boyd, of Stanford,
and S. Macneil, of California. Nega
tive, W. (\ Shelton, of Stanford, 11.
D. Hoover, of California, J. E. Shel
ton, of Stanford, and M. E. Harrison,
of California.
In introducing the first speaker
Professor Bacon, who presided, brief
ly reviewed the history of the medal
and laid stress on the fact. that, the
Carnot contest, was primarily an in
dividual one, excluding team work
on the part of the participants. The
Cardinal representatives in general
excelled their opponents in argument
as well as in delivery and poise. The
work of J. E. Shelton and Boyd was
of the highest order. Macneil was

undoubtedly the most effective
speaker among the California repre
sentatives and he alone offered ser
ious competition for the trophy.
D. C. Boyd was the first speaker
to mount the rostrum and in open
ins (lie debate he concisely described
the relations of France to Morocco.
In support of his claim that Del
casse's policy had been one of peace,
the speaker quoted from the French
"Yellow Book." French control of
Morocco, he asserted, was essential
to peace in the French colonies
which completely surounded that
country.
W. C. Shelton argued that Del
casse's policy would inevitably lead
to war, first with the Moroccans
themselves and secondly with Ger
many. And war, he continued, would
not be for the best, interests of
France, for even now her population
is decreasing, and with the added
losses attendant upon war, that
tii-eat. nation would decline political
ly and socially into a second rate
power. In order that France may re
place the thousands of her strongest
men and the industries destroyed by
long continued wars, peace at home
[and abroad is necessary.
H. D. Hoover contended that a re
version to the policy of Delcasse
would embroil France in a death
struggle with Germany, a nation bet
ter prepared for such a, conflict.
S. Macneil, the next speaker, main
tained that recent events in Morocco
proved that war and bloodshed were
more pronounced today than under
Delcasse's policy. U'nder Delcasse
Prance had secured the friendship of
all nations, save Germany, and the
weak provisions of the Algeciras
Conventions presaged a return to
his policy.
J. E. Shelton showed how the con
quest of Morocco would require a
vast army and millions of francs.
This would weaken the home gov
ernment. and at the same time give
Germany the- desired provocation for
war. France's consequent prostra
tion and losses would far outweigh j
the few mercenary and commercial
benefits which might accrue from
the adoption of Delcasse's policy.
M. E. Harrison closed for the neg
ative with an appeal for the continu
ance of the present policy of "paci
fic penetration" of Morocco. A re
version to Delcasse's policy would be
unwise because it disregarded Ger- i
many and the economic development I
of Morocco.
Each of the disputants devoted
about five minutes to rebuttal, and [
it was in refutation that the Stan- j
ford speakers noticeably surpassed !
the efforts of the Californians. W. j
C. Shelton, in a convincing and
strong rebuttal speech, reiterated his
claim that Delcasse's policy stood for
needless war, and that in Clemen
ceau's policy of moderation and in
ternal development lies France's
means of continued prosperity.

the speaker quoted from the French
"Yellow Book." French control of
Morocco, he asserted, was essential
to peace in the French colonies
which completely surounded that
country.
W. C. Shelton argued that Del
casse's policy would inevitably lead
to war, first with the Moroccans
themselves and secondly with Ger
many. And war, he continued, would
not be for the best, interests of
France, for even now her population
is decreasing, and with the added
losses attendant upon war, that
tii-eat. nation would decline political
ly and socially into a second rate
power. In order that France may re
place the thousands of her strongest
men and the industries destroyed by
long continued wars, peace at home
[and abroad is necessary.
H. D. Hoover contended that a re
version to the policy of Delcasse
would embroil France in a death
struggle with Germany, a nation bet
ter prepared for such a, conflict.
S. Macneil, the next speaker, main
tained that recent events in Morocco
proved that war and bloodshed were
more pronounced today than under
Delcasse's policy. U'nder Delcasse
Prance had secured the friendship of
all nations, save Germany, and the
weak provisions of the Algeciras
Conventions presaged a return to
his policy.
J. E. Shelton showed how the con
quest of Morocco would require a
vast army and millions of francs.
This would weaken the home gov
ernment. and at the same time give
Germany the- desired provocation for
war. France's consequent prostra
tion and losses would far outweigh j
the few mercenary and commercial
benefits which might accrue from
the adoption of Delcasse's policy.
M. E. Harrison closed for the neg
ative with an appeal for the continu
ance of the present policy of "paci
fic penetration" of Morocco. A re
version to Delcasse's policy would be
unwise because it disregarded Ger- i
many and the economic development I
of Morocco.

medal for 190N. Shelton's main
speech was ;i brilliant and masterly
exposition of the subject under dis
cussion, displaying an intimate
knowledge of French internal and
foreign affairs. The particular top
ic submitted to the contestants from
the general field, "France and Mo
rocco," was "Resolved, That France
should prepare to revert to the pol
icy of Delcasse in regard to Morocco
on the expiration of the Algeciras
Conventions." The winner of the
medal is a veteran of the 1 907 Car
not team and a member of the Del
ta Chi legal fraternity. He regis
ters in the Law department from San
Jose. The judges of the contest, who
were former congressman John P.
Irish, Raphael Weill, Knight of the
Legion of Honor, and Alexander Mc-
Adie, Chief of the Coast Weather
Bureau, deliberated eighteen min
utes before arriving at their decision,
which was unanimous. Shelton's
winning of the Carnot makes the
first time in five years that the
medal has been bestowed upon a
contestant away from his home col
lege.
The specific topic for the debate,
which was selected by a committee
composed of Professors Bacon, Fla
herty and Wells, of the University
of California, and Professors Duni
wav and Huston, of Stanford, was
read to the debaters in California
Hall at six o'clock. Macneil, of Cal
ifornia, alone chose to uphold the
affirmative, and as this left the three
Stanford representatives on the
same side, contrary to the Carnot re
gulations. Boyd agreed to join Mac
neil on the affirmative side. The
drawing of lots to determine the or
der of speaking resulted as follows:
Affirmative, I). ('. Boyd, of Stanford,
and S. Macneil, of California. Nega

In introducing the first speaker
Professor Bacon, who presided, brief
ly reviewed the history of the medal
and laid stress on the fact. that, the
Carnot contest, was primarily an in
dividual one, excluding team work
on the part of the participants. The
Cardinal representatives in general
excelled their opponents in argument
as well as in delivery and poise. The
work of J. E. Shelton and Boyd was
of the highest order. Macneil was

undoubtedly the most effective
speaker among the California repre
sentatives and he alone offered ser
ious competition for the trophy.
