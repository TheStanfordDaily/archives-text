### 
After a long-continued but thor
ough preparation, actual work has
commenced in earnest on the Uni
versity lighting system and it will
be in complete working order before
the close of the present semester.
At the present time men are at
work digging the trench for the un
ci reground cable and the redwood
for its lining and covering is now ar
riving from San Francisco. Absolute
ly all the material needed for the
installation is here excepting the
Bishop Crook poles, which are now
being manufactured in the city and
will be here in readiness for their
installment, which will not occur un
til the underground apparatus is fin
ished. Professor Ryan and Mr.
Charters of the Electrical Engineer
ing department, have inspected the
entire line of proposed construction
with Contractor Oug, who is to in
stall the system, and they can not
foresee any difficulty whatsoever to
interrupt the course of construction
except the conditions of the wea
ther.
The lights will be located so as
to alternate on each side of the ave
nue, and four will be situated on
the oval so as to have light at each
end of the Quad. Another will be
placed on the corner of Alvarado
street, near the Bookstore. These
lights are to be unusually strong,
each one being approximately five
hundred candle power or more.
