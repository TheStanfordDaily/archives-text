The sale of seats for"The Man

next Saturday night, in Assembly
Hall, was begun today. On the
Campus the demand at the Book
store was heavy and at 4 o'clock over
$400.00 worth of tickets had been
sold. In Palo Alto there was also
a good sale, but there are still some
desirable seats to be had and the sale
will continue this week.
