Our victory in the Carnot debate
last Friday night was particularly
gratifying, not only because ot was
a victory in the first intercollegiate
contest of the semester, but also
because the contest was won on the
California campus. To the winner
of the medal we extend heartiest
congratulations and to the other
members of the team Stanford is in
debted for so ably representing their
university. The victory this year
makes the sixth Carnot medal that
has come to Stanford and it shows
that in this branch of college activ
ities we are developing remarkable
strength. In winning the Carnot
medal W. C. Shelton has added bis
name to an illustrious list of inter
collegiate debaters and Stanford may
well be proud of the victory, espec
ially as the decision was unanimous
and all the Stanford speakers ac
quitted themselves with credit in
the contest.
