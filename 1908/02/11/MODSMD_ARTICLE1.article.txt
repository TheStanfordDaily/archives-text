# ST. MARYS VS. VARSITY
## RIVAL NINES TO CROSS BATS TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Game Will Be Called on the Campus Diamond at 3:45.-Mitchell's Injury Not Serious. 
### 
The third scheduled contest be
tween the Varsity and St. Mary's
nines will be played tomorrow after
noon on the Campus diamond, begin
ning at 3:45. The first, two games
had to be cancelled owing to the
inclemency of the weather, and, con
sequently, the match tomorrow will
afford the first opportunity of the
present season for comparing the
two teams. The St. Mary's men have
had far more practice and several
more games than the Cardinal nine,
and this should give the former ag
gregation no little advantage. Fur
thermore, the collegians have prac
tically a veteran team, including Pit
cher Krause, who proved extremely
effective against the Varsity in the
many matches of last spring.
The wrenching of Mitchell's knee
in the game with Santa Clara was
attended with no serious conse
quences, and it is probable that he
will be found behind the bat tomor
row.
The usual admission of twenty
five cents will be charged. The line
ups follow:
Stanford -Theile, Witmer, Good
ell, pitchers; Mitchell, catcher; Mc-
Gregor, first base; Bell, second base;
Sampson, shortstop; Fenton (c),

tenter field: Scott, right field.

ers: Burke, catcher; Dunn, first
