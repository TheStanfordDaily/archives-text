Tomorrow is the last day for col
lectors of funds for the new bleach
ers to report to Manager Knupp. All
the collectors should make immed
iate efforts to reach the students in
the district to which they were as
signed. And anyone who has not
contributed to the bleacher fund is
once more urged to do so, before
the collectors report to the Stud
dent. Body Treasurer.
In another column there appears
a short item to the effect that the
Palo Alto Club has vacated its quar
ters because those in charge of the
organization did not believe that the
future financial obligations could be
successfully met. This is a most sur
prising announcement in view of the
fact that the Palo Alto Club was re
cently organized with a large mem
bership and when a large room was
secured the club quarters became ex
tremely popular with the members.
It would appear that this is an in
stance of the situation that is too
often found in college organizations.
Namely, that the members are en
thusiastic in forming a club as well
as receiving the benefiits of such
quarters as were held by the l'alo
Alto Club, but when it comes to the
regular financial support there is a
sudden drop in the enthusiasm of
many concerned. In this particular
case there appeared to be enough
interest and sufficient members to
warrant the securing of a regular
meeting place. When such quarters
were secured the members took ad
vantage; of the reading room and the
other opportunities afforded at a
place where the members of the club
could come together informally at
any time. But now that the problem
of giving regular financial support
to the organization is realized, there
are not sufficient members willing
Id meet the obligation. Consequent

ly, the Palo Alto Club must give up
its club room. This fact is to be re
gretted. as the men who live in Palo
Alto have few opportunities to lie
come well acquainted and such a
place as the former club room would
do much toward bringing these stu
dents who do not live on the Campus
into a closer bond of fellowship and
loyalty to Stanford.
