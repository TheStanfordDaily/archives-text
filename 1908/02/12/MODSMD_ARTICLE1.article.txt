# ANOTHER MEET FRIDAY
## NEW MEN WILL AGAIN RUN IN SEPARATE EVENTS. First Relay Race Arouses Interest Anions Men.â€”Additions to Rubbing List. 
### 
The third track meet of the sea- i
son will be held Friday afternoon
at 4:00, and will be arranged simi
larly to that of last week, the var
sity men and new material compet
ing in separate events and everyone
running from scratch. An entry list
is now posted in the training house,
and everyone who expects to com
pete is expected to sign up before
the beginning of the meet.
The relay race instituted by Cap
tain Lanagan and Trainer Moulton
yesterday afternoon proved a dis
tinct success and will be continued
every afternoon, starting each day at
live o'clock. The race yesterday was
close and interesting and aroused
new interest among the men on the
squad. The two teams covered a
distance of two miles, each man run
ning a 220-yard relay, and so even
ly were the two teams matched that
the men were scarcely two yards
apart at the finish. H. Brown, '11,
and C. Coonan, '09. ran a fast and
close race in the first relay, Coonan
winning from the Freshman by a
scant yard. The lead was changed
from one team to the other four
times during the race, though on
the final lap Holman was given a
lead over Reed which enabled him
to win the event.
The improvement in the condition
of the men has been rapid during
the past week so that Friday's meet
should see good time made in ev
ery event. Trainei Moulton is well
pleased with the progress being made
by his men, and is already advising
some of the men who have been do
ing hard work, to lighten their train
ing, and to do their regular events
only two or three times a week, using
the other time for practice in start
ing and light jogging. Although the
large squad keeps "Dad" rather busy
directing the work, he is devoting
considerable time to the instruction
of individual performers.
Several trials have been run dur
ing the past few days and will prob
ably be continued from this time on.
Reed is working hard in the sprints
and is running in fine form, doing
a trial Monday in very little short of
0:10.2. R. B. Wheeler. '11, ran a
440 in 0:56 and with more strength
for a better finish will make good
time. Miller has done several quar
ters under 0:55 and is displaying
good form. E. A. McGregor ran a
trial 880-yard dash in 2:10, and
Maundrell covered the mile in less
than 4:55. Horton in the shot put
has been doing good work in prac
tice and has put the sphere beyond
the 4:? foot, mark on several occa
sions.
The meet Friday resulted in the
addition of eleven new names to the
rubbing list and another change will
be made at, the end of this week.
