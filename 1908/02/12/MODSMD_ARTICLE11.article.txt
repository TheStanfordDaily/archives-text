We feel called upon to make some
comment in regard to certain state
ments which appeared in yesterday's
"Daily Californian" concerning in
tercollegiate rowing affairs. The par
ticular sentence in the article that
does an extreme injustice to Stan
ford is as follows: "Notwithstand
ing the clause in the intercollegiate
agreement (he Cardinal boating men
are trying to get out of rowing a
Freshman eight, claiming that they
cannot get sufficient material to in
sure them a victory." Such a state
ment as this is not only incorrect,
but it. casts a serious reflection upon
the spirit of good sportsmanship
which exists here. We are neither
violating the intercollegiate agree
ment nor are we "claiming that we
cannot get sufficient material to in
sure a victory." As the matter now
stands, Manager Knupp and Manager
Snedigar, of California, are carrying
on negotiations with the object of
securing either a suitable shell or
barge for our Freshman eight to use
in practice; and there is a strong pro
bability that the necessary boat can
be borrowed from California through
the arrangements now being made by
Manager Snedigar.
Under the present intercollegiate
agreement the matter of boating ar
rangements is left largely in the
hands of the graduate managers of
the two universities and they seem
to be carrying on harmonious nego
tiations. There is absolutely no de
sire on the part of Stanford to avoid
an intercollegiate Freshman eight. In
fact, we have good Freshman rowing
material and will probably be able
to turn out as creditable a Fresh
man crew as represented the Cardin
al last year. It is not a problem of
securing sufficient material to insure
a victory that, is confronting Stan
ford, but rather one of securing a
barge or shell in which to train her
Freshmen. This need will probably
be provided for through tlie efforts
of Managers Snedigar and Knupp.
As nothing definite can be announced
in regard to the Freshman rowing
contest until the two managers have
reached an understanding it appears
that such an article as appeared in
the"Daily Californian" is not only

unjust, but shows a lack of knowl
edge of the facts in the case. We
hope to row California in an inter
collegiate Freshman eight and lack
of material will certainly not be the
cause if we are unable to do so.
