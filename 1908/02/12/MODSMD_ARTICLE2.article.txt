# WILL COUNT DAILY WORK
## FACULTY OF LAW DEPARTMENT ADOPT NEW RULE. Marks Obtained In Recitations Will Count One-Third Toward Final Grade. 
### 
"lii estimating a student's grade
hi the work of the Law department,
his classroom work shall l»e allowed
to count as one-third in determining
his filial grade. A minimum of fif
ty | cr cent shall he required in both
classroom work and the final exam
ination."
The above regulation, which was
adopted by the Faculty of the Law
department last night and which is
to «o into effect immediately, marks
a radical change in the policy of the
department. Heretofore the daily
work has not counted particularly
in favor of the student, sole depend
ence being placed on the final exam
ination. The old system necessarily
caused considerable injustice, and it.
is the purpose of the new rule to rem
edy the inequality.
Under the new regulation, in mak
ing ill) a student's grade, the instruc
tor will count the daily work as one
third and the final examination as
two-thirds. To obtain the grade for
the daily work, the marks secured
in class and written recitations and
in the mid-semester test, will be av
eraged. The regulation provides
that neither the daily average noi
the final examination mark shall fall
below fifty per cent.
The new ruling of the department
will prevent the student who main
tains a tfood average in class work
from being judged entirely upon a
final examination.
