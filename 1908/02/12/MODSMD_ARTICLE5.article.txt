# TO CONSIDER ROWING
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL DISCUSS 1911 EIGHT. Question Raised By California Will Be Taken Up Tomorrow Night at Meeting. 
### 
The question as to whether Stan
ford shall meet the University of Cal
ifornia in an intercollegiate regatta
of Freshman "eights" will come up
for consideration at the meeting of
the Executive Committee to be held
tomorrow night. At the last meeting
of the Intercollegiate Athletic Agree
ment Committee in San Francisco it
was decided by the delegates to leave
the matter of Freshman eights en
tirely with the two graduate mana
gers. Manager Knupp wishes to get
instruction as to the sentiment, of
Ihe local Committee upon the sub
ject as the issue has been brought,
to a crisis recently.
At present. Stanford is in the pre
dicament. of being able to enter a
strong Freshman eight, but as there
is but one shell in possession of the
Boat. Club, this will be impossible
at present. The purchase of a new
shell is not feasible at this time, and
| Manager Knupp is not in favor of
I securing a second-hand craft at any
J great expense as next season the
| present, varsity shell will be relegated
to the second class and can be used
tby a Freshman crew. It is probable
that should California wish to lend
the local oarsmen a shell or eiglit-
I oar barge to train in, the event might
ibo attempted. The folly of attempt
ing to train the varsity and Fresh
man crews in the same shell is evi
dent to the expert oarsmen, and
| meets with strong opposition br
I coaches Murphy and Turner.
It is upon this situation that
1 Knupp will ask for information and
I also the question of the date for the
meet of the crews will come up.
Coach Garnett, of the University of
California, is quoted as having stated
that the date must fall in April.
