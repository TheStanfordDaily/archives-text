# THIRD MEET TOMORROW
## LARGE ENTRY LIST ASSURES GOOD COMPETITION. Relay Race Will Be Run Twice Each Week.â€”Officials Are Appointed. 
### 
The plan of having the varsity
men and new material compete in
separate events proved so satisfac
tory in the meet last week that it
will be repeated in the meet tomor
row afternoon at 4:00 o'clock. How
ever, the performances should be
much better than in the previous
competitions! as the men are getting
into better condition and the warm
er weather will be conducive to fast
er time.
There is a large entry list already
signed up and there will undoubtedly
be plenty of competition in every
event, though the field events are
not as well filled as the races. Sev
eral of the men will change their
events at this meet so that it will
not be a mere repetition of Friday's
contest. Maundrell will run in the
880-yard run instead of the two-mile,
while Miller and Brown will enter
the 880 as well as the quarter. Nash
will run the mile and Bradford will
probably change to the half-mile.
Reed and Holman will enter both of
the sprints and Roth will appear in
the 220-yard dash.
The relay yesterday afternoon
proved a close race, but on account
of the interruption of regular work
which these contests cause, the cap
tain and trainer have decided to hold
them only on Monday and Wednes
day afternoons at 5:00 o'clock.
There will probably be no regular
tryout to select the seven men who
will represent Stanford in the Olym
pic Club two-mile team race in Gol
den Gate Park on Washington's
Birthday, though the two-mile run
tomorrow will be used as a basis for
the selection of any men needed to
complete the team of seven entries
The matter of the number of men
who will be taken on the southern
trip when the Cardinal will compete
with the University of Southern Cal
ifornia on March 7, will come before
the Executive Committee at its meet
ing tonight, when the number will
be finally determined.

the meet tomorrow are: starter, A.
