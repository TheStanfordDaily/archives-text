At the present time Manager Knupp
is endeavoring to arrange at least
one meet for the Freshman track
squad with a strong team of prepar
atory school athletes. Such meets
do a great deal toward arousing in
terest among the first-year men in
track work and also are highly ben
eficial toward developing a strong
Freshman team to compete with Cal
ifornia in the intercollegiate Fresh
man meet. In the past these meets
have been eminently successful and
there is every reason to believe that
the Bay Counties League will be
able to send down a team this sea

fine contest. It is to be earnestly
hoped that such a meet may be ar
ranged in the near future.
