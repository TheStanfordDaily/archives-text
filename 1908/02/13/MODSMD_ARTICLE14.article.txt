# Schubert Club Concert Date.
## 
### 
The Schubert Club has changed
the date of its concert to Saturday,
May 2, the night of the interscholas
tic track meet. This later date has
been chosen in order that the club
may have more time to devote to
their concert.
The musical program will be fol
lowed by the "Egyptian Princess,"
an opera by Vincent. The cast has
not. yet been selected, but there will
be eight leads and eight choruses.
This will be the first concert given
by the Schubert Club and its success
seems assured. The club has se
cured Dr. Blodgett, formerly univer
sity organist, as director and his
work will add greatly to the efficien
cy of the organization.
