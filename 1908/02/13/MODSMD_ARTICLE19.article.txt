Dr. George L. Spining, of the Nor
thern California Indian Association,
gave an address in the Chapel this
afternoon on the Indians of this
slate. The speaker was brought up
among the Indians of the Middle West
and has devoted all his life to study
ing them. Some time ago lie came
to California, to investigate those
living in this section, and has trav
eled more than 2,000 miles in this
work.
He reports that there are now
about 17,000 Indians in California,
as compared with 310,000 fifty years
ago. Of this number, the greater
part are in absolute poverty, al
though they are willing and indus
trious workers, and will easily sup
port themselves if given an oppor
tunity.
Their present condition is due to
the action of the Senate, in failing
to ratify the treaty made after the
American occupation of California,
which gave the Indians the right
to their land. As the treaty was
pigeon-holed, the Indians have nev
er had any legal rights, and as fast
as they acquired small farms, they
were evicted by white settlers.
The government is now being
urged to provide lands for the home
less Indians, and if public opinion
can be aroused enough to secure
this action, the situation will be
much relieved.
