# Large Sum For New Bleachers
## Collectors Have Already Secured Over Five Hundred Dollars and More Is Expected. 
### 
Sufficient money to warrant the
Board of Control in going ahead
with plans for the construction of
the track bleachers has been paid
by the undergraduates and turned
in to Graduate Manager Knupp by
the special collectors appointed some
time ago by Student Body President
A. A. Murphy. Over $500 is now
in the possession of the Student Body
treasurer, and Knupp confidently ex
pects that the total will be in the
neighborhood of $650 when all of
the collectors have reported. The
showing of the various divisions of
the community have been with but a
few exceptions uniformly good. En
cina Hall ranks first in the lists
with a total up to date of $182.00,
and the prospects of sufficient to
swell this past the $200.00 mark,
while the fraternities with the ex
ception of four yet to be heard from,
have contributed $139.00. The wo
men of the University have paid so
far about $130.00, but several of the

sorority collectors have not added
their receipts to the amount in the
hands of Miss J. Derby, '08.
The showing of the Palo Alto stu
dents has been low up to date. Of
the entire number of undergraduates
living there but 2 0 have paid the
assessment. Upon the Terrace
$24.00 has been collected while the
students in the private lodging
houses on the Campus have reported
$12.00. The Japanese Club has con
tributed $12.50 while nothing up to
date has been received from the un
dergraduates who commute.
It was expected that $700.00 would
be raised by the special assessment,
which, together with the money now
in the hands of the Board of Con
trol, would pay the expense of the
new bleachers to be constructed. The
amount, when the last collector has
been heard from, will not be far
from this figure, and it is expected
that work can be started within a
few weeks upon the bleachers.
