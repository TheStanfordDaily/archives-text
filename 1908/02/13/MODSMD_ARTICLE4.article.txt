# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS ON JAPAN.
## Tells San Francisco People That There Is No Danger From the Island Empire. 
### 
President Jordan gave an address
yesterday in San Francisco under the
auspices of the Forum Club, on "Ja
pan." He discussed the religious,
political, and the civic side of the sit
uation, and in regard to the "Yel
low Peril" said, "There is no Jap
anese situation."
He explained that a natural thirst
for knowledge has brought the Jap
anese people to the front as a na
tion, but that it was a poor country
and had no desire for war. Every
battleship constructed meant increas
ed taxation and hardship for the
working classes.
The speaker then gave a number
of illustrations to show that Japan
had a very friendly feeling for the
United States, and he emphasized
the fact that the Japanese did not
have any desire for a war by which
they could gain nothing, and would
in the end meet disaster.
Dr. Jordan also pointed out that
the Japanese were originally a white
race, but that the inhabitants of the
southern islands acquired a yellow
color by intermarriage with other
Asiatic nations. The people in the
northern islands are still white.
