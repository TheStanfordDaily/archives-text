# EIGHTS FOR FRESHMEN
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VOTES TO RENT SHELL. Much Business Transacted at Meeting Last Night.â€”Carnot Pins Are Granted. 
### 
It was decided at the meeting of j
the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students last night that an
eight-oared regatta between the
Freshmen crews of the two univer- j
sities shall be held this spring. The
question has been agitated recently, j
and Manager Guy Knupp appeared
before the Committee last night to \
secure the permission of that body
to rent a suitable shell from the
Koat Club of the University of Cali
fornia. This was granted and the
stipulation made at the suggestion!
of assistant coach W. F. Turner
that oars and rudder be included in
tlie contract. The lack of a second
shell here has been all that stood
in the way of an eight-oared Fresh
man regatta as far as Stanford was
concerned, and this action effectually
clears up the difficulty.
No action was taken last night
by the Executive Committee upon
the proposal of the Pacific Athletic
Association to attempt to have all
competing athletes take out regis
tration cards in the association, as
no official communication has been
received here as yet from the asso
ciation. A communication bearing
upon this subject was received from
the Executive Committee of the As
sociated Students of the University
of California, in which the stand
taken by that body against the pro
posal was cited. This will be an
swered and the assurance given the
undergraduates of California that
while no action has been taken, the
Committee is not in favor of the pro
posal of the P. A. A.
The members of the winning Car
not team were granted the new style
pins. The men to receive the tro
phies are W. C. Shelton, 'OS, 1). 0.
Boyd, 'OS, and J. E. Shelton, '10.
The Executive Committee author
ized the sending of a team of eight
track men to San Francisco to com
pete in the cross-country race
through Golden Gate Park on Wash
ington's Birthday. The matter of
setting a date for the intercollegiate
regatta was considered only inform
ally, as the intercollegiate agree
ment. states that the matter shall
rest with the graduate managers,
and no action was taken. The rep
resentatives of California are at
tempting to have the race set, for
ward a week on account of examina
tions.
