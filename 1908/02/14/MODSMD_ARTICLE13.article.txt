# TROPHY NOT YET AWARDED.
## Quadrangle Club's Punting Cup Winner Cannot Be Decided Until Club Takes Action. 
### 
As some discussion has arisen as
to whether the punting trophy of
the Quadrangle Club should be
awarded for distance and accuracy
or for all around good kicking,
Coaches J. F. Lanagan and G. J.
Presley, in whose hands the award
ing of the trophy lies, refuse to ren
der a decision without the Quad
rangle Club first taking action and
deciding for which of these things
the trophy is to be awarded.
At. the meeting of the Quadran
gle Club last Wednesday evening,
this matter was to have been brought
up and some action taken in re
gard to it, but as Professor Max Far
rand was not present at the meeting,
the matter was not mentioned. Pro
fessors Farrand and Angell are the
only present members of the club
who were members of the club at the
time when the trophy was first of
fered. When seen yesterday Pro
fessor Farrand said that at the time
the Quadrangle Club first offered the
trophy good football kickers were
scarce, and no restriction w;is laid
ui)on the coaches in awarding the
trophy.
The Quadrangle trophy was award
ed in 1904 to W. H. Dole, 05. K.
| L. Fenton, '08, was awarded the tro
phy in the years 1905 and 190G.
