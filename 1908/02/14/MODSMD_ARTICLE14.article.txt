# WILL MEET INDEPENDENTS.
## Varsity to Cross Bats With Ireland's Men Tomorrow for Second Time This Season. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2::!() the
Varsity nine will meet Ireland's In
dependents, of San Francisco, for
the second time this season. The
first match resulted in a defeat for
the Cardinal by a score of 3 to 2, and
with the additional two weeks' prac
tice since that contest, the Varsity
should give the visitors a hard game
Saturday. Ireland's team will be
composed of practically the same
men that were in the line-up a fort
night ago, although Thielman, of the
Cleveland Americans, may pitch for
the visitors.
Kenton's injury, which he receiv
ed in the match with Santa Clara
yesterday, is of a more serious na
ture than was anticipated. Although
it is not expected that the wrench
to his knee will cause him any
long-continued trouble, the varsity
captain will be kept off the diamond
for at least a week by it. In the
meantime, Scott will cover the third
bag, while the outfield will be made
up of Owen, Wirt and Scofield. The
last-named is a recent addition to
the squad, and although he has not
as yet displayed more than average
form at the bat, he has proved him
self a reliable fielder.
Following are the probable line
ups:
Stanford—Theile, pitcher; iMitch
ell, catcher; Ball, first base; Bell,
second base; Sampson, shortstop;
Scott, third base; Owen left field;
Wirt, center field; Scofield, right
field.
I ndependents—Hopkins, pitcher;
Bliss, catcher; Kennedy, first base;
Stultz, second base; Deveraux, third
base; McKune, shortstop; Heitmul
ler, left Held; Williams, center field;
and Ireland, right field.
