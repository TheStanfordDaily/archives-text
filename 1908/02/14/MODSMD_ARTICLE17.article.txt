# New "Angel of Grief" Statue.
## 
### 
A new statue of the "Angel of
Grief" has been received and set up.
The statue, made of the rarest Ital
ian marble, is an exact reproduction
of the original "Angel of Grief."
The earthquake of 190 shattered
the first statue, erected by Mrs. Stan-
J ford in memory of her brother, Hen
ry C. Lathrop, and not until now
I was it replaced.
