The following communication has
been received by the"Daily Palo Al
to" in regard to the discourteous
treatment accorded a lady by a bus
driver operating between the Cam
pus and Palo Alto:
"Editor 'Daily Palo Alto':
"May I be allowed a few lines to
protest against an unusually flag
rant instance of insolence on the
part of one of the Campus bus driv
ers? A lady of my acquaintance
hailed a bus this afternoon at the
Bookstore corner, wishing to be driv
en to Palo Alto. The driver, who
is known to the community by the
name of 'Curly,' drove up to the
curb and the lady entered his car
riage. After waiting for some min
utes, 'Curly,' seeing three other la
dies enter another bus, drove up to
this carriage and requested its driv
er to make room for his own pas
senger, explaining to the latter with
that genial urbanity for which he
is so deservedly admired, that 'It
don't seem worth while for two car
riages to take four people.' The
other driver explained that his car
riage was full, and the lady in Cur
ly's carriage, not choosing to risk
being ordered to vacate, got out and
returned to her home, having 110
time to wait for the arrival of a
less impudent driver.
"B. O. FOSTER."
