sistance of 11. I. Cruzan, '06, and.
: Professor 11. I). Gray, of the Eng
lish department.
Chairman Avery has secured a new
i stage setting from a San Francisco
j studio which will be used as the
| scenery for the second and fourth

The plot is built on the troubles
(>!' the impetuous Jane Mangle and
her clandestine lover. Opposition
I is encountered from her father, and
she also has to contend against the
! schemes of a governess and her bro
! ther, who plan to match the young
heiress to the Nangle fortunes with
her host, Lord Bapchild. Their
plans continually thwarted, not the
least often by the vexatious child,
Pamela, Jane and her lover are fin

ally aided to elope by the charming
Constantla Gage, Jane's staunch
l'riend. The third act presents two
of the liveliest scenes in the play,
when Constantla and Lord Bapchild
find a refuge after being lost all
night in a boat, and Jane finds her
self alone in a public inn. The
fourth act portrays the consterna
tion of the Bapchild household and
its guests on hearing that Jane is
lost with Lord Bapchild, and is full
of surprises for the assembled com
pany that are furnished by the two
young couples.
