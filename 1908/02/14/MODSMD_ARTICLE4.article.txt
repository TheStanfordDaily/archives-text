### 
The members of the Student
Affairs Committee resigned this
afternoon in a body. This ac
tion was taken because chair
man W. P. Dui'and feels that
his work as a member of the
Commission of Engineers and
his regular duties in his depart
ment would prevent him from
devoting the time necessary to
carry out the policy that the
* Hoard of Trustees has instruct
► ed the Faculty to take in regard
► to the drinking question. As
f chairman lMirand fell, it ncces
► sary to resign, the remaining
» members of the committee took
similar action. The men who
* have resigned are: Professors
► V. L. Kellogg, 15. <), Foster, A.
f <r. Newcomer, A. >1. Cat heart,
£ and \V. F. Durand, chairman.
£ The new Student Affairs Coni
» mittee will .probably be ap
x pointed next. Monday.
