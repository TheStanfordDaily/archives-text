There is just cause for a feeling
of satisfaction upon the part of the
baseball coach and players after the
showing made by the Varsity in the
last two games. The defeat of St.
Mary's College on Wednesday and
the close and well played game with
Santa Clara yesterday afforded two
of the best exhibitions of baseball
that have been seen on the Campus
in some years. These games were
particularly good for such an early
date in the season and from the
present playing of the varsity squad
the outlook for a successful base
ball season is bright. With three
capable pitchers and the team hit
ting and fielding well there is every
reason to look forward to the de
velopment of a winning team. How
ever, in this connection, it is well j
to urge the Student Body to support
the players. When the team is play
ing the sort of baseball that has been
seen during t he present season there
is certainly no reason why the
bleachers should not be crowded. We
hope to see a large crowd at the
game tomorrow so that the coach
and players will realize that their
work is appreciated.
