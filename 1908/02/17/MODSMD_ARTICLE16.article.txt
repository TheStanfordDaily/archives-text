# FINE SOPHOMORE COMEDY
## CLASS OF 1910 SCORES SUCCESS IN CLEVER PLAY. "The Manoeuvres of Jane" Presented In Manner Up to Standard of Sophomore Plays. 
### 
A large audience witnessed "The
Manoeuvres of Jane," as presented
by* the Class of 1910 in Assembly
Hall last Saturday evening, and ac
corded it a hearty reception. In the
painstaking effort and creditable han
dling of their material the cast and
committee achieved the success which
Stanford people have come to expect
of the Sophomores since their come
dy always surpasses the other two
class plays which are presented dur
ing the semester. The chief criti
cism which is heard on the Campus
concerns the selection of "The Man
oeuvres of Jane." In comparison
with the brilliantly clever lines of
"You Never Can Tell," last year's
comedy, the best repartee in the
1910 play seemed relatively tame,
and neither plot, situation, nor char
acterization was strong enough to
make up for this defect. The first
act was slow, and the same fault was
apparent, at intervals throughout the
play; to partially correct this, many
of the characters might have spok
en less deliberately, hurried their en
trances and exits more, â€”in general,
put more speed into the unimportant
action, thereby emphasizing all the
more the really effective "business."
Miss Adaline Wright, in the title
role, made a charming and impulsive
Jane. Her ease and naturalness
were marked, and she was entirely
adequate to all the demands of the
character. Miss Winifred Higgins
was very successful with the part
of Constantia Gage, especially in Acts
111 and IV. Her acting during the
scene in Miss Dodd's cottage was bet- j
ter than at any other time. Miss
Dodd herself was exceptionally good,
and the few lines allotted to Miss
Burnham were as well done as any
thing in the play. In Pamela Beech
inor, Miss ,T. I. Roll carried out the
author's idea of an awkward, malic- ;
ions little eavesdropper, but in this
as in nearly every part in the com- [
edy, there was an unfortunate repe
tition of a few stock gestures, man
nerisms and inflections, all very char
acteristic in themselves, but. too con
stantly used to be constantly inter
esting.
W. P. Fuller, Jr. made an instant
hit as Lord Bapchild, and is to be
commended for sustaining the part
successfully throughout the evening.
His nervous stammer was capital,
and every detail of his action had
been carefully studied out. L. N.
George, as George Langton, has a
much better part than the average
so-called "hero" of a society play,
and though at times he seemed some
what too cool and restrained, on the
whole his quiet interpretation of
Langton heightened the effect of
Jane's impulsive wilfulness. H. W.
Thompson did some good work as
Jervis Punshon, despite a most inap
propriate costume and absurd make
up. The uncertain temper of Nangle
was exaggerated by C. .1. Moroney so
that a climax was made impossible,
and the character rendered somewhat
tiresome. H. F. Allen was a most
dignified and sanctimonious Rev. Bo
stock.
As a whole, the audience was well
satisfied with the performance, and
will be glad to class it with other

Sophomore successes in bringing out
new talent for the encouragement
of the Stanford stage during the next
two years.
