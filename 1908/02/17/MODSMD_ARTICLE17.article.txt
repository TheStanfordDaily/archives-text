### 
"Honor thy father and thy moth
er," was the text of the sermon
preached in the University Chapel
yesterday morning by Dr. Gardner.
After discussing the qualities of the
ancient Jewish home, the preacher
said: "Home is not only a shelter,
it is a nursery for the young, a sem
inary for the youthful, a refuge for
(he aged. Our Anglo-Saxon peoples
have shared with the Jewish people
respect for home and family life.
This hits been especially true of Am
erica. But many observers regret
a lowering of standards in our do
mestic life. Hotel life, divorce, self
ishness are hindering home life, and
something not so easily defined is un
dermining (lie old fashioned ideas of
duty in the home and obedience to
parents. Most of you are away from
home. That fact does not alter your
duty. You bear a name which you
must not shame. When we are
tempted to sin we should think of
our parents; we should remember
the kind hands, the sweet, anxiety,
the brave and prudent talk of home.
That will save us in many a tempta
tion."
Referring to the recent death of
a student, the preacher said: "Maude
Turner won the love and devotion of
many friends by her gracious, amia
ble, happy disposition. How comfort
ing to the parents to know this, and
to remember that their only daugh
ter has always been noble and good
and true in life, affectionate and de
voted to them and beloved to her
friends."
The choir sang one of McFarren's
devotional anthems, elaborated by
that author upon the text of the
twenty-third Psalm.
