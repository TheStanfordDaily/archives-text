\\ hat President Jordan Says.
In regard to the situation and
I the policy of the new committee,

President Jordan said: "Last, Friday
the Academic Council adopted a reso
lution to carry out ihe action of the
Board of Trustees relative to sus
pension of students for drunkenness.
It was the desire and intention of
the Faculty to pursue a quiet, sys
tematic campaign of appealing to the
manhood of the students to get rid
of the evil of drunkenness. This
necessitates a great deal of work.
Chairman Durand, of the Student Af
fairs Committee, stated that he could
no longer devote the necessary time
to this work without neglecting his
luties as a member of the Faculty
and the Commission of Engineers.
The other members of the committee
resigned with him because it is the
custom here when the chairman of
this committee resigns that the other
members should resign also, in order
that the new chairman may have a
free rein in selecting the men he
would like to have serve with him
on the committee. There are no in
structions given the men on the new
committee as to the manner to be
adopted in carrying out the resolution
of the Academic Council. They are
to use whatever methods seem best."
