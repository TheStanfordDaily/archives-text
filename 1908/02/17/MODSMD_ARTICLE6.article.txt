# Varsity Lost on Saturday.
## 
### 
For a second time this season the
Varsity was defeated by Ireland's In
dependents on the Campus diamond
last Saturday afternoon. The final
score was 5 to 3. A rather listless
exhibition was brightened by the en
thusiastic coaching of Captain Ire
land of the visiting team. During
the first two innings Theile and Mit
chell officiated as the Cardinal bat
tery, and the latter's passed balls
and wild throws to the bases were
largely responsible for the three runs
] scored by the visitors in the second
period. Goodell then took Theile's
| place and successfully kept the vis
itors from hitting safely until the
ninth, when two singles, two walks
I and a sacrifice brought in a couple of
tallies.
Four safe hits scored Sampso and
| Owen in the fifth, and Ganong's two
bagger, following Scott's single, made
; a total of three. Coach Lanagan
! witnessed the game from the bench.
