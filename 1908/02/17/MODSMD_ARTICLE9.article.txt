The resignation of Professor Du
rand and the members of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee is an event
which must be deeply regretted by
the Student Body. When this com
mittee was first appointed it took up
the duties of its office at a time when
the relations between the Facility and
the students were strained. By the
attitude of the committee and the
personality of its members, the
breach was soon reconciled. An un
derstanding was established between
the two elements and the result was
perfect harmony and ideal conditions
in student life. On account of their
position toward the students and the
frank method in which they per
formed their many difficult duties,
the resignation of the members of
this committee is a matter of keen
regret to the Student Body.
In regard to the resolution that
has been adopted by the Academic J
Council announcing the policy of the
new committee, there is reason for I
some comment. Although there may
be cause in certain cases for strin-
Sent rules in regard to drinking up- I
on the Campus, it would appear that j
a great many members of the Fac
ulty have taken a position that is
not entirely logical. The infrequent |
and exceptional cases have been con- j
sidered as typical of the prevailing ,
conditions. It is this attitude that
has made it appear that there is a
situation much more serious and i
disgraceful than actually exists. It |
also affords opportunities for the
metropolitan press to give the public
an exaggerated idea of the conditions
that prevail here and in this way the
University is injured. There have
been occasions when there was just
criticism of the drinking on the Cam
pus and some restrictions, other than
those enforced by student sentiment
may have been necessary; but never
lias there been such a situation as
some of the members of the Faculty
seem to believe now exists.
When the new committee takes up
its duties every action will be watch
ed with intense interest on the part
of the Student Body. The frank
method of acting in the open, that
has been followed by the former
committee, is the true mode by which
the committee may receive the sup
port of the students. And when

such an open method is followed it
is unquestionable that the vast ma
jority—in fact, every member—of the
Student Body is in favor of the
strictest moderation in regard tc
drinking. The committee is sure to
receive support in eliminating drunk
enness, just us it would in eliminat
ing any conduct on the part of tho
students that would bring shame up
on Ihe fair name of our University.
