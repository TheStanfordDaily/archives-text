# WILL ANNOUNCE POLICY
## STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO MAKE STATEMENT SOON. New Committeemen Are Now Investigating the Conditions On Campus. 
### 
The new Student Affairs Commit
tee will hold an informal meeting to
night for the purpose of discussing
the present situation on tne Cam
pus. Chairman Clark stated that no
action of any kind will be taken to
night but that a second meeting will
be held within the next three or
four days, when the policy which is
to govern the future actions of the
committee will be formulated and
given out to the University. Chair
man Clark considered it inadvisable
to announce the policy of the com
mittee for a few days, until the pre
sent agitation has somewhat sub
sided and the committee has ac
quainted itsell' with all the tacts
bearing on the situation.
The committee desires to thor
oughly investigate every phase of
the drinking question before deciding
upon any definite course of action.
With this idea in view consultations
have been held with Professor Du
rand's committee for.the purpose of
ascertaining the exact facts and con
ditions with which the new commit
tee has to deal. In adition to this,
information and data which has been
collected by the former committee
has been placed in the hands of Pro
lessor Clark to guide the new com
mittee in determining its policy. And
as Professor Cathcart was a mem
ber of the previous committee,
Chairman Clark and his associates
should be in a position to deal intel
ligently with the drinking question
and other affairs of interest to/*iie
students.
As a tribute to the members ol
the committee which hasf'Tust re
signed, several hundred students,
led by a band, marched to the home
of Professor Duyand night. Af
ter several niinutVs had been spent
in-cheering for the retired chairman
the crowd called for a speech. As-
Professor Durand was not at home,
Mrs. Durand responded to the ova
lion with a few remarks in which
she said that Professor Durand was
entirely in sympathy with the reso
lution of the Academic Council.
The students later visited the resi
dences of the other members of Du
l and's committee.
