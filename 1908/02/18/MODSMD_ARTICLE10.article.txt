In regard to the recent discus
sion as to the policy of the Pacific
Athletic Association toward colleg
iate athletics, the"Daily Californian"
contains an editorial stating the sit
uation as it is understood at. the
University of California. From the
editorial it would appear that. Cali
fornia believes the P. A. A. is assum
ing an arbitrary attitude and the
editor of the"Daily Californian" has
the following to say:
"The recent ultimatum of the Pa
cific Athletic Association to the ef
fect that, unless the university ath
letes enroll in that organization they
shall not be recognized as amateurs
has met with well-merited opposi
tion from the executive committee.
The result of the action on the part
of the P. A. A. authorities has been
the calling off of the basketball game
with the University of the Pacific and
the possible forfeiting of a number
of other games. Despite this fact,
however, we believe that the posi
tion of the executive committee
should meet with the approval of the
student body.
"The attitude of the Pacific Ath
letic Association appears to be about
as follows: 'The A. A. IT. is the only
organization of amateurs in existence.
Membership in this body is conclu
sive evidence and the only evi
dence of amateur standing.
Therefore, unless the University of
California registers its athletes with
us, we must, consider them as pro
fessionals and take action accord
ingly.' In view of the fact that the
university has always made the ut
most efforts to prevent even the
slightest suggestion of professional
ism among its athletes, the position
which has been taken by the local
organization can scarcely be borne
with equanimity. Looked at in its
broadest light, it is nothing less than
an attempt to compel the university
athletes to pay the registration fee
of the P. A. A. regardless of their
own wishes. We believe that this
action was entirely unwarranted and
that the position taken by the exec
utive committee in opposing it should
be commended."
