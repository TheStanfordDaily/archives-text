## Harvard Director Says college Honors Should Not Depend Solely on Studios. 
### 
I Jr. Dudley A. Sargent, director of
physical training at Harvard, in a
recent article advocates a physical ex
amination for entrance into universi
ties and colleges, by which all those
below a certain moderate standard
of physical fitness would be denied
admission to the higher institutions.
"At the present time," says Mr.
Sargent, "in many schools and col
leges it is customary to forbid stu
dents to take honors in athletics un
less they have a creditable standing
in their studies. In order to make
this consistent, the requirement
should be coupled with another, i.e.,
that no student should be given
honors in his studies unless he at
tained a certain grade in his gymnas
tics and athletics. This last require
ment would insure the conscientious
student against sacrificing his health
in view of raising his standard in
scholarship, which at the present
time he is likely to do on account of
the keen competition to which lie is
subjected."
Mr. Sargent further says that all
advancement, from class to class in
all schools should be dependent on
a physical test, and argues that un
less some such requirement as this
be adopted all over America, the na
tion will lose its intellectual supre
macy.
