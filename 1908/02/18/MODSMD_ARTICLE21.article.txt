To the Editor of the"Daily Palo
Alto."
With your permission I desire to
correct any wrong impression that
might easily have been made by the
communication of Prof. B. O. Fos
ter, since such a correction can be
made by simply statiug the facts in
the case.
Last Friday afternoon 1 and ano
ther driver were at the regular stand
near the Bookstore corner, when a
lady came down the walk and waved
for a carriage. 1 drove up to the
walk for her and at the same time
three other ladies came along and
got into the other carriage. When
T knew they were going to take the
other rig I turned my team around
and asked the driver if he would
take another passenger, and he said,
"Yes, 1 will." Before the other driver
had answered this, and even before
I had the words out of my mouth in
asking it, the lady stepped out of
the carriage and remarked, "I'll not
go down now, I want to see this
lady." With this she crossed the
sidewalk, met another lady, then
both turned and walked up Alvarado
Row. The other driver did not say
he would not take her down, as
Prof. Foster's communication states,
and altogether the lady was in my
rig only a few seconds.
It is customary for a driver with
only one passenger to ask for a
transfer to another carriage which
is going down; but in case of a re
fusal or in case of the other rig be
ing full, then the driver knows it to
be his duty to go if only with one
passenger. Had the lady remained
in my rig she would not only have
gone to Palo Alto but would have
arrived there long before the three
in the other carriage, for I have the
reputation of driving the fastest
team on the line.
Very respectfully,
ALBERT McCLEAN.
