# WILL NOT ENTER TEAM
## MEN NOT IN CONDITION FOR OLYMPIC CLUB RUN. Try-out For Team To Make Southern Trip On February 28.â€”Eligibles From U.S.C. 
### 
Captain Lanagan and Trainer Moul
ton have decided not to enter a Stan
lord team in the Olympic Club two
mile race in Golden Gate Park next
Saturday. It. has never been Train
er- Moulton's policy to encourage Car
dinal distance runners to enter cross
country races with outside athletes,
but he left the decision in this mat
ter with the men themselves. Some
time ago the men decided to enter
the Olympic Club contest if they
were able to get into proper condi
tion before the event, but this has
proven impossible and the men have
asked Captain Lanagan not to enter
them in Saturday's race.
Few of the athletes who would
compose the two-mile team are in
condition for such a race. As the
meet with Southern California is less
than three weeks off it is considered
best to employ the entire time in
preparation for that contest. Nash,
who would have been one of the
strongest of the two-mile team, is
getting into condition very slowly
and has not sufficient strength to run
j a hard two-mile. W. W. Adams, '09,
is still kept off the track by a foot
j which was injured in the meet of a
week ago. S. G. Sweet, '09, is suf
fering front a case of shin-splints
and .T. E. Shelton, '10, has not train
i ed enough to stand a hard race. This
| would leave only Maundrell and Mac
gregor in condition for the race, and
: both men prefer to devote their time
to lhe meet with IT. S. C.
The meet Friday will be conducted
in the same manner as the two pre
j vious contests, the old and new mei.
i competing in separate events.
The tryouts to select the team
| which will make the southern tri]
' to compete with l\ S. C. on March 7.
' will be chosen on Friday, February
128, when every one will run from
I scratch in straight heats. The list
