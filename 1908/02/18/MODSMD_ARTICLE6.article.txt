SCOItK OP 15 TO 7.
Game Broken l'p In Fifth Inning liy
right For Hall, ISnt Later Is
Finished.
The first interclass baseball game
this afternoon between the Sopho
mores and Freshman resulted in a
victory for the 1910 players by the
score of 15 to 7. It was a one-sided
contest from the start, although
there were several interesting fea
tures, among them the batting of
Wilde, who played first for the
Sophomores. Little and Cochran
formed the battery for the Sopho
mores, while Tidemann and Kobe
pitched for the Freshmen, and Peck
caught.
During the fifth inning the game
was broken up by a long fly to the
outfield, which resulted in a wild
chase for the ball. After about fif
teen minutes the game was contin
ued.
The summary follows:
R. H. E.
Sophomores 15 13 4
Freshmen 7 5 7
F. A. Adams captained the Soph
omore team while C. H. Tallant led
the Fresmmen. After the game there
was the usually strenuous scrap for
the ball that, was used in the con
test.
Game With St. Mary's Tomorrow.
The seventh game of t lie season
and the second with St. Mary's will
be called on the Campus diamond
tomorrow afternoon at 3:45. in the
match between the Varsity and the
Collegians a week ago the Cardinal
was victorious for the first time with
in many years, and Presley's nine
will make a determined effort Wed
nesday to repeat the performance.
The discouraging work of the Var
sity in the game with the All-Stars
was due probably to the many un
fortunate mishaps which combined to
heap ui> six runs in two innings.
Krause will be in the box for the
visitors, and, in all probability, Wit
mer will officiate on the slab for
Stanford. The remainder of the line
up will be the same as in the game
of last week with the exception of
Fenton, whose injured knee still con
tinues to keep him on the bench.
The entire nine is rounding into
good condition, and scarcely any
substitutes have been played in the
! last few games. Theile pitched the
, whole match yesterday, and it is
; probable that the other twirlers will
be asked to do the same, if their
! arms are sufficiently strong.
Among the new men, Ball, at. first,
and Scofield, in right field, are doing
j excellently. The former is proving
himself a consistent and timely hit
l ter.
