At the Assembly tomorrow Rev.
Dr. Charles Reynolds Brown will be
the speaker. This announcement
should assure a large attendance, as
Dr. Brown is one of the best speak
ers that has ever been heard at Stan
ford. He is familiar to the older
members of the Student Body and it
ia unnecessary to call their atten
tion to his appearance, but upon all
other undergraduates we wish to im
press the importance of attending
the Assembly tomorrow morning.
