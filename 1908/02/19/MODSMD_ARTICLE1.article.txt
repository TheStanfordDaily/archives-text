# SECURES FRESHMAN BOAT
## KNUPP EFFECTS ARRANGEMENT WITH MANAGER SNEDIGAR. Track Meet Date Remains Unchanged.â€”New Ride Governs Admission To Ball Games. 
### 
Arrangements to secure an eight
oared shell from the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Califor
nia have been practically completed
by Manager Guy Knupp, '07. At a
conference held in Berkeley yester
day, Knupp interviewed Manager
Spedigar of California and the pres
ident of the Associated Students at
that institution, and they both stated
positively that there would be no
difficulty in securing a shell for the
Freshman crew to train in but thai
official action would have to be tak
en by the executive committee of
their student body. The shell will
be rented at a nominal charge, prob
ably just, enough to cover the wear
and tear which may result from its
use here.
Knupp went over the proposition
of changing the date of the intercol
legiate track meet. As it now stands
for April, it conflicts with the cele
bration planned in San Francisco on
the scheduled arrival of the big
fleet. As the arrival of the fleet is
uncertain, nothing definite has been
done toward changing the date.
A new method of conducting the
ticket sale upon the varsity diamond
has been adopted by Manager Knupp,
to go into effect at once. Hereafter
tickets will not be sold aTter the
sixth inning, so that all undergradu
ates who arrive after this time from
thi afternoon laboratory courses will
be given seats upon the bleachers
free, provided they do not arrive be
fore this inning. This step has been
taken by Knupp because of the fail
ure of a large number of students
to pay their admissions and congre
gating along the si,3e lines in the
field.
