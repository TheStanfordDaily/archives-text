A new method has been announced
by Manager Knupp in his attempt, to
prevent a large crowd from watch
ing the baseball games without going
through ilie formality of paying ;in
admission fee. According to the pro
posed scheme no tickets will be sold
after the sixth inning, and those who
arrive after this inning may occupy
seats on the bleachers without
charge. In this way the men who
stand back of first and third bases
cannot give the excuse that they ar
rived late, as has been their plea in
the past. Every season there has
been a complaint upon the part of
the management in regard to those
who stand around the edges of the
diamond and escape the ticket col
lectors. There is no excuse for the
man who witnesses the games with
out expense, as lie deprives the Stu
dent Uody treasury of needed funds
and also does an injustice to the
other students who have paid ad
mission. With this new system of
ticket selling we may hope to see all
the spectators at the varsity games
upon the bleachers, where they prop
erly belong.
