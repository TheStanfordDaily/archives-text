# Few Pay "Quad" Assessment.
## 
### 
Manager D. W. Burbank, of the
1909 "Quad," reports that the num
ber of members of the Junior class
who have not paid their "Quad" as
sessment is unusually large. He has
decided to extend the time limit up
on the payment for a. few days, but
all assessments should be in by
March 1. Up to the present time
only 187 members out ol the class
of over 300 have paid their $."> as
sessment, and of this number many
have not had their pictures taken,
rt is essential that all Juniors have
their pictures taken immediately as
the cuts for the "Quad" are made
in alphabetical order and the failure
of certain students to pay delays the
work on Ihe entire number.
