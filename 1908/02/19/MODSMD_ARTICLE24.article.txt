# DR. JORDAN ON FOOTBALL
## CONTRIBUTES TIMELY ARTICLE TO "PACIFIC .MONTHLY." Discusses Evils of American Game and Compares It With Rugby As Played Here. 
### 
President Jordan has an illustrated
article which will appear in the
March number of the "Pacific Month
ly," entitled, "Football: Battle or
Sport?" The article contains a re
view of the causes leading up to the
criticism of the old American game
of football and some of the reasons
why Rugby has gained favor. There
are several fine illustrations accom
panying the story, especially of the
last, big game.
In regard to the adoption of ltug
bv at California and Stanford, Dr.
Jordan says:
"In the two great universities of
California, the Rugby game, played
under varying but fundamentally
identical rules throughout Great Brit
ain, Canada, New Zealand and the
northern half of Australia, has been
substituted for the American game.
The initiative in this matter was
due to President Wheeler of the
University of California and to Pro
fessor Frank Angel 1, chairman of
the committee on athletics of Stan
ford. The present writer was an ear
ly convert to the wisdom of this ac
tion. Mr. James Lanagan. the Stan
ford coach, was a later convert, but
a very enthusiastic one. The game
has been played for two seasons and
with very fair success.
"Experience shows that the acci
dents in Rugby football are much less
frequent, less severe, and mainly con
fined to the limbs. Injuries to the
legs are almost as frequent as in
the American game. The fact that
the game is played in cotton draw
ers instead of padded coats of mail,
indicates at once a great difference.
The Rugby football is a far swifter
game, involving adroitness and co
operation rather than great strength.
The giant has the advantage even
in Rugby, but he must be a giant
whose head and whose feet move
quickly. As there are thirty players
in a game of Rugby instead of twen
ty-two, and as it is a sport which
men will play even though there
is no possible hope of making any
team, its introduction tends to re
vive the life of athletics within the
colleges, which the American battle
game has done so much to destroy.
Men can play Rugby football and
carry full work in the class room as
well. It is a rare man who can do
this and play the American game
even as a scrub.
"The game of Rugby cannot, lie
planned by a coach. The most lie
can do is to give form to individual
players. In New Zealand, the espec
ial home of clean, swift, strenuous
sport, every player is his own coach,
and professionalism of coaches as
well as of players, though not un
known, is condemned by universal
popular opinion."
