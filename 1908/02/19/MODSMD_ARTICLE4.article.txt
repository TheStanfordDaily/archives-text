# Appeals to Student Sentiment
## Rev. Dr. Charles Reynolds Brown Makes a Forcible Address Upon the Bad Influence of Drinking. 
### 
â€¢ That, it was for the students as men j
and women to come out into the op
en and clear the fair name of the
University from any smirch which
may have been caused by excessive
drinking, was the plea advanced by
Dr. Charles Reynolds Brown, rector
of the First Congregational Church
of Oakland, this morning in a stir
ring address before the undergradu
ates at the regular Assembly. The
remarks of the well-known speaker
were received with applause and ap
peared to make a decided impres
sion upon all present. The gather
ing was one of the largest held in
some time and the program of the
occasion was greatly strengthened by
the appearance of the University Or
chestra.
President Jordan introduced the
speaker of the day and in his in
troductory remarks complimented
the "college spirit." and the unity of
spirit displayed by the yelling, but
sounded a note of warning that "col
lege spirit" should not be overdone.
When a. man was convinced the
crowd was headed in the wrong di
rection lie should have the mo.al
courage to step from the throng,
said President. Jordan.
Dr. Drown, who is known to the
older undergraduates here as a
straightforward speaker, proved all
that reputation has boasted. "I have
a working knowledge of five or six
other languages," said Dr. Brown,
"but for every day sound sense talk
ing I prefer the English language."
The "Spirit of Moral Venture" was
the topic chosen by the speaker, lie
slated that drinking was to his in
timate knowledge with affairs here,
not prevalent among the greater ma
jority of the undergraduates as it
has been said.

"We have been humiliated by the
action of some men who have been
guilty of drunkenness. There is no
use denying this fact and I speak
not as an outsider but as one who
ha:-\ through my six years as a lec
turer here and through my acquain
tance with undergraduates and alum
ni, become acquainted with the sit
uation. I have heard of the condi
tions from the lips of Faculty and
students in my own home."
In telling how the evil done could
be rectified, he said: "The Faculty
can do some good and the committee
on Student Affairs will be able to
do some. The supervisors of San
ta Clara, county or San Mateo county
can help by removing the tempta
tion. But it rests upon the stu
dents. It can't be done from the
outside.
"The people of the State of Cali
fornia have a right to look to the
two big universities of the state for
high mora! integrity and spiritual
passion. Idealism should breathe and
grow here as upon its native heath.
You are here to be made more com
petent. to take moral risks."
In conclusion he addressed a few
remarks to the women of the Univer
sity and asked them to exact high
ideals. His speech was followed by
cheers and much applause which
showed that his remarks had made
an impression on his hearers.
One of the features of the gath
ering was the excellent playing of
the University Orchestra and in tin
rendering of selections from "Wood
land" were given a vigorous encore
from the undergraduates. The ga
thering was brought to a conclusion
with the singing of "Hail, Stanford
Hail," and a Varsity.
