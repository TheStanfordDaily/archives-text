# Interscholastic Takes No Action.
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that J. It. Hick
ey, ex-'OS, was unable to attend last
night's meeting of (lie Hoard of Gov
ernors of the Interscholnstic At h let -
i" Association, it.was decided to post
pone any action in regard to the af
filiation of the \ssociation with the
Pacific Athletic Association, until the
situation was more thoroughly un
derstood by the members of the lo
cal board. As neither .1. F. Danagan,
'00, nor Dr. P. Angell were present,
ii was impossible to obtain their
exact opinion as to the advisability
of the action under consideration,
so those present were not desirous
of taking any definite attitude until
the entire board had discussed the
question. W. H. H. Fowler, '06, was
present at the meeting.
