# KRAUSE IS EFFECTIVE
## ST. MARY'S WINS THE GAME BY SCORE OF 4 TO 1. Varsity Unable To Get Hits When There Are Men on the Bases. 
### 
The Varsity lost in the second
Kit me of the season with St. Mary's
College this afternoon by the score
of 1 to 1. The cause of the Car
dinal defeat was inability to hit
Krause when there were men on
the bases. The game was ragged
at times and both sides piled up a
good many errors. Witmer and Rut
ledge formed the Stanford battery
throughout the game and Krause and
Burns officiated for the collegians.
Witmer pitched a steady game and
the visitors' hits were well scatter
ed, while Krause was practically in
vincible after the first inning, and
although several men got on the
bases nobody could get a hit when it
would mean runs.
Stanford made her only run in the
first inning when Rutledge, who got
the base on an error, came in on
Sampson's hard-hit ball to second.
St. Mary's scored two runs in the
first inning on Burns' three-bagger,
a walk, and an erro.r In the sixth
the visitors made another tally on a
man being hit by Witmer, followed
by two singles. The final run was
made by St. Mary's in the ninth on
I Lit t ledge's eror.
The summary follows:
R. H. E.
Stanford 1 5 S
St. Mary's I (1 ~
Base on balls: off Witmer.2; off
