### 
The Committee on Student
AfVairs at a meeting on Febru
ary 10, 1008, considered a mat
ter referred to it by the chair
man of tlie former committee,
with the result that two stu
dents who were noticeably un
der the influence of liquor upon
the University Quadrangle at
about the date of February
5, were indefinitely suspended
from the University.
Signed, A. 15. CLARK,
Chairman.

The above official communication
from the chairman of the new Stu
dent Affairs Committee was received
this morning. It refers to the most
recent action of the new committee,
and is probably their first official
act. The cases referred to were con
sidered by the committee at a spe
cial meeting held yesterday morning.
Although this sudden and drastic ac
tion of the new committee comes as
a complete surprise to the commun
ity, Chairman Clark states that the
committee took up the case of the
two men who were suspended, as a
matter of business that had not been
completed by former chairman Du
rand. Because of this fact the ac
tion in this particular case may not
be interpreted as evidence of the pre
sent committee's intention to consid
er actions of the students which took
place prior to the resignation of Pro
fessor Durand and his committee.
Affairs in Encina Hall.
Although there have been various
rumors in regard to a change in the
policy of the committee toward the
management of Encina Hall, ('hair
man Clark said today that he was
ioi considering any change. At the
present time he expressed himself as
pleased with the house committee,
which has control of affairs in the
big dormitory, and he felt that this
committee was perfectly capable of
handling the situation in the Hall.
Chairman Clark's Statement.
When interviewed this morning in
regard to the most recent action of
the new Student Affairs Committee
in indefinitely suspending two men,
Chairman Clark said: "In taking
this action the new committee is
merely proceeding with what might
be termed unfinished business. The
chairman of the former committee
had this case reported and was in
vestigating the matter at the time of
his resignation. It was then turned
over to the present committee and
we continued the investigation, and
after having secured the facts the
present action was taken.
"It was not a case of flagrant
drunkenness, but these men were suf
ficiently under the influence of liquor
to be noticeable to passers-by. The
