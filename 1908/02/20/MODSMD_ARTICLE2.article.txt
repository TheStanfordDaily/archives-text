# ASK STANFORD TO ENTER
## THE
						CONFERENCE ASSOCIATION SENDS INVITATION. Cardinal May Compete In "Big Nine" Track Meet In Chicago Next June. 
### 
Manager Knupp is in receipt of a
letter from the secretary of the In- j
tercollegiate Conference Athletic As
sociation, inviting Stanford to send a
i team to the Conference track meet
which will he held on Marshall Field,
Chicago, on .June 6. This meet is
| held annually under the auspices of
| of the "Big Nine" Athletic Associa
tion and is considered one of the
j greatest athletic events in the coun
j try, drawing the best talent from
the entire West and Middle West
The letter also states that a sim
j ilar invitation has been extended to
the University of California, and sug
gests that in case neither university
is able to bear the expense of send
: ing a full team to the meet, it might
be possible to send a combination
team, selecting the best men in the
different events and thus securing
good representing at much less ex
pense.
The last time a Cardinal team
; competed in the Conference meet was
in the spring of 1904, when the
men took part in that, event and also
in the Olympian games in St. Louis.
The impression made by that, visit
proved very favorable and the mem
bers of the conference have urgently
requested the Stanford athletic of
ficials to send a team to the past
two meets, and have renewed their
efforts in hopes of securing repre-
I sentation at the meet this spring.
California sent a team East in
190r>, but since then neither of the
large Western universities has com
peted with the Middle West. While
Stanford bas not sufficient material
Â»o send a complete team to a meet
where the performances will be of
such a high order, there are several
individual athletes in college who
compare favorably with the best men
of the "Big Nine" and it, is not. im
probable that in combination with
California a strong aggregation might :
he sent to represent, the West in !
the meet at Chicago. The invita- ]
tion will be considered by the Execu
tive Committee at. an early date.
