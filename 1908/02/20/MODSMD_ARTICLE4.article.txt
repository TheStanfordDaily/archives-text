lection of the team to make the
i southern trip on Monday, March 7,
] tomorrow's contest will be the last
| of ibis kind of competition for some
! time.
If good weather continues there
I should be some close races and good
| time made as the past week has
j shown a marked improvement in the
| condition of the men. The relay
| race has already proven beneficial
j in developing speed among the mid
; die distance men and the idea will
| be continued, races being run twice
j a week with teams made up at ran
j dom from the men 011 the squad.
In tomorrow's meet Nash will

and Shelton may also enter 'this
j event. Maundrell is suffering from
a strnined ligament received while
; running a trial half mile early in
the week, and will not compete to

j meet, in the 440 and possibly the
! sBO. Vandervoort will make his first
appearance of the season in the
j sprints, where he has been doing
good work in practice, running a
I trial hundred Tuesday in 0:13. Con
siderable interest is being manifested
in Otis' performance in the high
jump, where he annexed first place
|in the last meet, and there is no
little speculation as to the probab
ility of his repeating the perform
ance.

ful in arranging a date for the Fresh
