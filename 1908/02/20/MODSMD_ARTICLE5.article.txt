this afternoon was a mighty good
game of baseball for the interclass
series and the pitching of G. B. Mc-

of the day. He only allowed the Ju
niors three safe hits and in adition
to his good work on the slab Mc-
Lain lined out a fine three-bagger
in the ninth inning. E. P. Tallant
pitched for the Juniors and only
eight hits were made off his de
livery but the Seniors were lucky
in the seventh inning when they
scored three runs on hits and errors.
There was no scoring on either
side until the sixth inning, when
each team made a run. In the sev
enth the Seniors took the lead by
the score of 4 to 1, and in the next
inning the Juniors made it 4 to 2.
The Seniors clinched the victory by
making another tally in the ninth In
ning. One of the features of the
game was the catching of some long
flies in center field by J. W. Gallo
way of the Senior team. The win
ners will meet the Sophomores in
the final interclass game.
E. P. Tallant. captained the Jun
iors, and F. A. Herrmann led the
