The special request from the man
agers of the Western Conference
that Stanford be represented in tne
great track meet to be held in Chi
cago next June is an invitation that
should receive serious consideration.
When the Cardinal track men en
tered the Conference Meet in 1904
they made a creditable showing, al
though the talent in the Middle West
that year was particularly high
class. This season Stanford should
have several exceptionally strong
athletes and it would be an excel
lent opportunity for comparing the
relative standard of Coast athletics
with those of the Middle Western
colleges. The greatest obstacle to
such a trip for a team of Stanford
track men would be the expense in
volved. It is upon this phase of the
proposal that the Executive Commit
tee would do well to devote some
serious consideration. If any feasi
ble scheme can be devised, whereby
a team may be successfully financed
on such a trip, it would be a fine
thing for the University to be rep
resented in the great Conference
Meet. This contest is the greatest
track meet held in the Middle West
and the mere fact that Stanford is
represented at such an affair, to say
nothing of the posibilities of winning
points, would add to the athletic re
putation of the University.
