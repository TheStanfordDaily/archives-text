# OLYMPIC NINE TOMORROW
## WILL MEET VARSITY TEAM IN FIRST GAME OF SERIES. Chalmers and Parker in Visiting Line-up.—Fenton Will Again Be on Third Base. 
### 
For the first time in several years
a baseball team representing the
Olympic Club will meet the Cardinal
nine on the Campus diamond Satur
day afternoon. This game, which will
be called promptly at 2:30, is the
first of a series of three which are
to be played between the two teams
in the course of the present season.
In the line-up of the visitors there
will be a number of well-known play
ers, including A. J. Chalmers, ex
'o7, a veteran of two years ago, and
Paul Parker, '03, also a member of
former varsity nines.
After an absence of over a week,
necessitated by a wrenched knee,
Captain Fenton will again be seen on
third base in the contest tomorrow.
Scott will resume his position in left
field, and the other two outfielders
will probably be Wirt and McGregor.
It is probable that, Mitchell will con
tinue to cover first, and that Wit
mer will be in the box.
The probable line-ups are:
Stanford—Witmer, pitcher; Ga
nong, Rutledge, catchers; Mitchell,
first base; Bell, second base; Fen
ton, third base; Sampson, shortstop;
Scott, left field; Wirt, McGregor,
center field; Owen, Scofield, right
field.
Olympics—Lyman and Hougaard,
pitchers; Reiterman, catcher; Scott,
first base; Erlin, second base; Mo
ran, third base; Muhl, shortstop;
Chalmers and Parker, left field;
O'Kane, center field; Atkins, right
field.
According to the present arrange
ments, there will be but one varsity
game on the Campus during the com
ing week, that between St. Ignatius
and the Cardinal on Tuesday. The
varsity nine will leave for Los An
geles Thursday afternoon, where they
will cross bats with the St. Vincent's
on Friday and Saturday.
