The representatives of the Univer
sity of California will meet the Stan
ford debating committee tomorrow
to arrange a new Intercollegiate De- j
bating Agreement. At the present
time there is no understanding be- i
tween the two universities in regard
to the arrangements for the intercol- j
legiate debate. This is due to the
fact that the old agreement expired
on January 18 and no new compact j
has been drawn up. There appears to
be a small matter of controversy be- j
tween the two institutions in regard
to the exact amount of time to be !
allowed each speaker in the annual
debate. This is not a matter of such
vital consequence that it cannot be
easily adjusted, and the real im
portance of the meeting tomorrow
will be to arrive at some sort of an
understanding that will result in the
announcement of the question for
the annual debate. It is California's
turn to select the subject for the in
tercollegiate debate, and as the date
for such an announcement has ar
rived, there should be no unneces
sary delay. As the matter now stands,
the Stanford debaters will be placed
at a disadvantage unless they are
immediately informed of the topic
for the annual debate, and no minor
points of dispute should interfere
with the announcement of the ques
tion.
