The Executive Committee is per
fectly justified in its action toward
the proposed intercollegiate Fresh
man baseball game. There do not
appear to be any strong reasons why
there should be such a contest added
to the present schedule of intercol
legiate athletic events and several
objections may be raised to the pro
posal. The contest would necessi
tate additional expense and there
would be 110 particular benefit de
rived. Baseball differs from other
branches of sport in regard lo the
advantages of bringing out a large
number of Freshmen for the purpose
of developing varsity material, be
cause varsity baseball players can
not, be developed from among men
who have reached college. Another
objection to the baseball game lies
in the fact that two intercollegiate

Freshman contests in the spring are
quite sufficient. The Freshmen have
as much as they can attend to at the
present time and no advantage can
be gained by increasing the number
of Freshmen who will devote time
to intercollegiate athletics, ft would
add to the number of men who are
dropped because of scholarship with
: out bringing any benefit to those
j who competed and kept up with their
studies. From a financial standpoint
it seems extremely doubtful if such
a game would prove successful. For
all of these reasons the Executive
Committee lias wisely decided that
Stanford does not desire an intercol
legiate Freshman baseball contest.
