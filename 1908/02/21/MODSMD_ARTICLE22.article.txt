The following communication has
been received by the "Daily Palo Al
to," in which the writer denies the
statements recently attributed to him
in a San Francisco newspaper. The
writer of the communication says:
"Editor 'Daily Palo Alto,'
"Dear Sir: My attention has been
called to the article in the San Fran
cisco 'Examiner' of February 19, en
titled 'Stanford Students Decry Beer
Clamor,' in the closing paragraph of
which a vigorous denunciation of the
outgoing Student Affairs Committee
is credited to me. I wish to state
to all who may have read that arti
cle, and to the university public in
general, that I did not make any
such statement at all. Not being a
resident on the Campus, I have had
no opportunity of acquaintance with
the regime of the Student Affairs
Committee, and have made no state
ments at all to anyone about it. I
have only the highest respect and
esteem for those professors of the
former Student. Affairs Committee
whom I know, and 1 have no reason
to speak ill of those whom 1 do not
know. It would be gratifying to the
whole Student Body, I am sure, as
well as to myself, if students who
correspond for the daily San Fran
cisco papers would not manufacture
their news items, as was done in
this case. Most sincerely,
"G. CA<RL McPHEETERS, '10."
