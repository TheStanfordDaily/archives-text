# WILL ROW AT REDWOOD
## TWO CREWS TO START TRAINING THERE TOMORROW. Turner Will Visit Coach Murphy On Sunday and Also Try To Set Race For April 25. 
### 
Boating practice at Redwood City
will be started when the first Fresh
man eight formed this year goes on
the water tomorrow morning. The
men will be given their first exper
ience in an eight-oared shell under
the direction of Coach Turner and
Captain Gay. In the afternoon, a
varsity eight will row on the Red
wood course.
Commencing Monday, practice will
be held at Redwood regularly each
afternoon. At least one crew will
be taken up every day, so that prac
tically every man will be given a
chance in the eight at Redwood twice
a week. The shell for which Mana
ger Knupp has been negotiating with
the University of California will be
available at an early date. On its ar
rival, a varsity eight and a Fresh
man eight will be taken to Redwood
every afternoon. Two crews can be
accommodated on Saturdays with on
ly one shell, so that with two shells
almost the whole squad can train in
an eight on the last day of each week.
Practice on Lagunita will be con
tinued every day for the men who
do not go to Redwood. For this
purpose, both the four-oared shell
and the barge will be kept at the
lake.
Coach Turner will go to San Fran
cisco Sunday to see Coach Murphy
and will also go to Berkeley to ar
range affairs connected with row
ing. He will spend Sunday morning
with Coach Murphy, who wrote in
a recent letter that he expected to be
able to take charge of the oarsmen
by March 1.
Turner will try to make arrange
ments for sending the shell rented
from California as soon as possible
to the Redwood City training quar
ters. It is understood that little
difficulty will be encountered in ship
ping the boat, so that it will be ready
for use at an early date. Coach Tur
ner will also confer with Manager
Snedigar and the boating authorities
at Berkeley in an effort to schedule
the intercollegiate regata for April
25.
