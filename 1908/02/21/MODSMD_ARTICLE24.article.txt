# PLAN ELABORATE JUNIOR PROM.
## Sub-Committees Suggest Features Which Will Make Brilliant Social Event on March 27. 
### 
Elaborate plans of decoration were
submitted to the Junior Prom, com
mittee at a meeting held late yester
day afternoon, by the sub-committee
in charge of decoration. The main
feature of the scheme involves the
use of smilax and If the suggestions
of the sub-committee are adopted,
over 2000 feet of the beautiful green
climber will be worked into the deco
rations.
Whether a military band or a well
known orchestra will furnish the mu
sic has not been decided by the com
mittee. There will be sixteen dances
and two extras included in the Prom.,
besides the opening grand march to
be led by the president of the class.
Tickets will go on sale March 1.
