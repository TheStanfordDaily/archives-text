# NO FRESHMAN BASEBALL
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DOES NOT FAVOR GAME. President Peixotto Explains Attitude of P.A.A. With Regard To Intercollegiate Athletics. 
### 
The changes in the Intercollegiate
Athletic Agreement which were
drawn up last month by the dele
gates at Ihe regular meeting in San
Francisco were considered by the
Executive Committee with the re
sult that the proposed Freshman
baseball game was not ratified and
will not be sanctioned by Stanford.
The other changes calling for the
seven man entry in the various ev
ents of the track meet and the clause
fixing the final baseball game of the
varsity series were accepted but have
not yet been approved by the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Associated
Students of the University of Cali
i fornia.
The proposed Freshman baseball
game was introduced by the Califor
nia representatives and did not meet
with favor from Coach Presley or
the majority of the Executive Com
mittee. At the meeting of the com
mittee last night Coach Presley and
Captain Fenton both appeared and
stated their position in regard to the
proposal, and the committee voted
against this clause of the agreement.
Sidney Peixotto, president of the
Pacific Athletic Association, appeared
before the Executive Committee last
night to explain the position of the
association with regard to intercol
legiate affairs. He stated positively
that there was no movement, on loot
to force the athletes of the two uni
versities to take out P. A. A. cards
when engaged in intercollegiate com
petition as had been rumored. The
only time when it would be necessary
for the athletes to take out cards
was when the track men engaged in
open meets with athletes of outside
clubs who had cards in the P. A. A.
He would be pleased, however, to
have Stanford undergraduates send
;i representative to the Board of Di
rectors of the Association. This was
, laid over until the next meeting be
fore any action will be taken.
The use of the new track was
granted the I*. A. A. to hold the try
outs here, lor the Olympic Games
at London, on May 9.
