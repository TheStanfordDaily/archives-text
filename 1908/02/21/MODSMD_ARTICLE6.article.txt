### 
L. S. Levy, ex-'OB, contributes to
the March issue of the "Bohemian
Magazine" an interesting article on
the "Chaparral," as one of a series
on humorous college journalism.
The article reproduces about twenty
of the best "Chaparral" illustrations,
and quotes a number of the clever
est prose compositions, including
Wallace Irwin's famous "Graduate by
Request."
