# U.C. OFFERS AMENDMENT
## DESIRES TO CURTAIL SPEECHES IN ANNUAL DEBATE. California and Stanford Representatives Meet Tomorrow To Discuss Debating Agreement. 
### 
A conference between the repre
sentatives of debating interests at
the University of California and Stan
ford will be held in the Encina re
ception room tomorrow afternoon
for the purpose of drawing up a new
debating agreement between the two
universities. This is made necessary
by the fact that the Intercollegiate
Debating Agreement of 190G ex
pired on January 18 of this year,
thereby severing debating relations
until a new set of regulations is ad
opted. Several interesting questions
may arise out of this situation, which
is unprecedented in the history of
the two institutions, and negotia
tions looking toward the establish
ment of a new pact have been car
ried on during the past few days.
Had the old agreement remained
in force, it would have been neces
sary for California to submit the
question for the intercollegiate de
bate today. However, in the absence
of a regular understanding, the
State institution refuses to submit a
topic until an agreement has been
drawn up and accepted. Should this
be accomplished at tomorrow's meet
ing the question will be-made known
to the Stanford committee at that
time.
The California Intercollegiate De
bating Committee, on February 18,
formally adopted the debating agree
ment of 1906 with the following
amendment: "The time allowed
each speaker shall be fifteen min
utes, except that one speaker for
the negative shall have twenty min
utes, and one speaker for the affir
mative shall have a second speech of
seven minutes; the affirmative shall
have the closing speech." Under the
old agreement the disputants were
given twenty minutels for their
speeches.
In answer to this action the Stan
ford committee notified California
that Stanford would immediately rat
ify the 1906 agreement as it stood,
in order that the subject for debate
might be submitted on the usual
date. To this was added the pro
viso that any amendment which
the two universities might agree up
on subsequently, would govern this
year's debate. This proposal was re
jected. and the conference tomorrow
was called as a means of settling the
matter to the satisfaction of both uni
versities.
