# REFUSE TO RENT SHELL
## CALIFORNIA OARSMEN FAIL TO ASSIST CARDINAL. Stanford Is Now Forced To Train Two Crews In One Eight-Oared Boat. 
### 
Contrary to the word received some
days ago by Manager Knupp from the
University of California, the Blue
and Gold boating interests now re
fuse to rent Stanford a shell in which
to train a Freshman eight. Assist
ant. Coach Turner went to Berkeley
yesterday to make the necessary ar
rangements for shipping the shell to
the training quarters at Redwood
City. When he reached Berkeley and
saw John Tyssowski, the manager
of boating at the University of Cali
fornia, he was informed that it
would be impossible for California
to loan a shell.
Altogether there are three eights
owned by the University of Califor
nia. One of these is a brand new
boat. The stand taken by Manager
Tyssowski for the boating interests
at California is partly founded on the
decision of the oarsmen not. to use
this boat until the race against the
Cardinal. In order to make their
chances for victory better, the Blue
and Gold men want to row in a boat
which has never been subjected to
the wear and tear of the water.
If California rents a shell to Stan
lord, always providing that the new
shell be kept in the boathouse on
the Oakland estuary, then there will
be only one boat in which to train
the Berkeley oarsmen, both fresh
men and veterans. One of the old
shells owned by California received
an injury Saturday which will pre
vent its use for some days. How
ever, California will not let. Stanford
have even this damaged boat, owing
to the fact that the oarsmen at Ber
keley are unwilling to use their new
shell until the intercollegiate regat
ta. The amount of rental stipulated
for the shell which Manager Knupp
expected to procure was $35.
Coach Turner declared this after
noon that, notwithstanding the at
titude of the California men, he
would go on developing a Freshman
eight. Even handicapped as they
are, the varsity men will train in
the same boat that is used by the
Freshmen, the two crews alternating
in the only eight-oared shell avail
able to the Cardinal oarsmen. This
will have to be done to conform with
the intercollegiate agreement, which
calls for a Freshman eight this year.
Coach Turner conferred with
Boating Manager Tyssowski in re
gard to the date of the intercolleg
iate regatta, which will probably be
held some time in April. No date
was fixed, and the matter will come
before the executive committee of
the University of California at the
next regular meeting on Wednesday
evening.
Coach Murphy was doing well when
Turner saw him in San Francisco
yesterday morning. His progress is
still slow and was steady up to Sat
urday, when he caught a slight cold.
Murphy took to his bed as a precau

tionary measure on that day, but the
chances are good that, he will be able
to leave the hospital for Stanford
bv March 1.
