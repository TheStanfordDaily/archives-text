Inasmuch as one Carl McPheeters
has seen fit to deny a statement crit
icising the former Student. Aflairs
Committee, quoted as coming from
him, which statement was printed in
hist Wednesday's "Examiner," I de
sire to reiterate the statement in that
article. The said quotation was not
obtained by me in person as I do not
know McPheeters, but it was ob
tained from reliable friends of his.
Since the denial of McPheetres the
statement attributed to him has been
reaffirmed to me by the same parties
and I still believe it to be true, as
I don't know what object his friends
would have in "manufacturing" a
tale against him; one can plainly see
that, motives might actuate McPhee
ters to deny the statement.
