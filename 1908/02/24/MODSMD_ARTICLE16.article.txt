# PRESIDENT BAER PREACHES
## Head of Occidental College, Los Angeles, Delivers Sermon To Large Congregation. 
### 
I "If a man compel you to go with
him one mile, go with him twain,"
was the text for President John Wil
lis Baer's sermon in the Chapel on
Sunday morning.
In opening the sermon the preach
er emphasized the fact that the ser
mon on the Mount was just as true
today as it ever was and that it fit
ted the needs ol' all living in the
St;ite of California in the year 1908.
To do one's duty he considered high
work, but to do more than one's du
ty was a still higher work. When
a man reminds you to do your duty,
go further. "There is no way to the
second mile until you have gone all
ol' the first," said the preacher; "be
ware of the short cut. Short cut
ters sometimes appear to reach the
second mile gate, but after they have
been out in life they will come to
some thorny place, where the exper
iences of the first mile would have
helped them materially in covering
the second. Young people ought to
get hold of the saying, "Practice
makes perfect.' Beware of the mea
sured unit and remember you must
travel all of the first mile to get to
the second."
