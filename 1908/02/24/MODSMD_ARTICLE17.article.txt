# Sad Washington's Birthday Parade.
## 
### 
The annual Washington's birthday
parade was held on Saturday morn
ing and proved one of the most in
teresting processions of the kind that
has ever been seen on the Campus.
It was a typical funeral cortege, and
the "deceased" was an empty keg,
borne by six solemn undergraduates
in black robes. Following this sad
group in black came a number of stu
dents clad in pure white, bearing
milk cans and banners ot' purity. The
remaining features of the parade
were the usual drum and horn and
many students in various weird cos
tumes. But the whole tone of the
parade was that of sadness and the
solemnity of the occasion was mani
fested by the leader, who with a
most sad expression, carried a beau
tiful bouquet of flowers as a tribute
to the departed.
