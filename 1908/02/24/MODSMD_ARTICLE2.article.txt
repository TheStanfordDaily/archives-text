# CLARK DERIDES RUMOR
## COMMITTEE TAKES NO SUCH ACTION AS PUBLISHED. Dismissal of Four More Undergraduates in Midnight Session Only Reporter's Fantasy. 
### 
The assertions published in one of
the San Francisco dailies to the ef
fect, that four more students had
been compelled by the Committee on
Student Affairs to sever their con
nection with the University were this
afternoon declared by Chairman
Clark to be base and unqualified lies.
Furthermore, Professor Clark de
rides the "midnight session" to
which allusion was also made in the
same journal. The new chairman
states that a meeting of his commit
tee occurred Saturday afternoon, but
that during the session no decisive
action was taken and that the body
merely discussed informally differ
ent matters of varying importance.
Another meeting was held this morn
ing in the President's office, but no
result was attained which would yet
warrant publication. It is probable,
however, that the committee will
again convene some time today or
tomorrow.
Chairman Clark reiterates the fact
that he will not. seek to discipline
anyone for offenses committed pre
vious to his appointment as chair
man, with the exception that the
new committee feels itself bound to
dispose of all cases referred to it by
Professor Durand and his associates.
It. is intimated, however, that such
cases were comparatively few in
number and that the majority of
them have already been settled.
Yesterday morning Clark visited
President Stewart, of Encina Club,
and the two discussed conditions as
they now exist in the Hall. The
chairman assured Stewart that he
did not intend to interfere in the
government of the dormitory as long
as matters continued as satisfactorily
as they are at present.
