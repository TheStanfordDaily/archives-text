# Choir Creates Good Impression.
## 
### 
The Chapel Choir continues to
show improvement under the direc
tion of organist Buehrer, and show
ed to especial advantage yesterday
morning in Mendelssohn's "Come,
Let Us Sing." Mr. Rand rendered the
solo. Miss Alberta Hanna sang "Eye
Has Not seen,'' from Gaul's "Holy
City," with much success.
