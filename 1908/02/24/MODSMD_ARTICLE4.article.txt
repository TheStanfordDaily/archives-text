# NEED MORE TRACK MEN
## CERTAIN EVENTS NOTICEABLY WEAK THIS YEAR. "Dad" Moulton Speaks of Men Who Have Ability But Do Not Work Consistently. 
### 
Although the performances at the
track meets held during the last four
weeks have, in general, been very
satisfactory, there are some events
in which there is a noticeable weak
ness, which might in some cases be
remedied if all available material
was placed at the disposal of Train
er Moulton.
In varsity material the broad jump
is one of the weakest events. Bellah
is doing good work in that event
and may prove a point winner, but
his performance in the pole-vault last
Friday shows that this is his best
event. L. Scott, '10, may also be
considered a likely candidate for a
place in the broad, but as he is play
ing baseball he may not have time
to do sufficient track training. Aynes
worth and Redman are no longer in
college and the development of oth
er material is imperative.
For the Freshman meet there are
several events which are not well
supplied with strong material. As
yet there have been no Freshman
pole-vaulters who have shown any
form, inspite of the fact that there
are men in college who have good
preparatory school records which
should entitle them to a place in the
meet with California. The weights,
especially the hammer throw, have
also a noticeable lack of strong
Freshmen and unless more men come
out for these events, it seems likely
that most of the points in the field
events must go to California. There
is also room for more men in the
other field events. In the middle
distances the Class of 1911 has some
strong athletes, but there are practic
ally no two-milers showing good
form and the sprints are not. unusu
ally strong.
"Dad" Moulton is very pleased with
the work of the men who are train
ing, but expresses no little feeling
over the fact that there are several
good athletes in college who are not
doing consistent training.
In speaking of these men, "Dad"
said, "Although the training season
is over a month old and four pre
liminary meets have been held, there
are still some men of known ability
who have not yet begun to work reg
ularly, and some who have not ap
peared for track training at all.
"I don't know to what this is due,
but it seems that there are a few
men who do not care for hard work
unless there is a. trip or an import
ant meet in immediate view.
"I know of Freshmen in college
who have good preparatory school
records who have not come out for
track work or any other branch of
athletics and there should be some
means of bringing these men out
where they will be of some service
to the University."
