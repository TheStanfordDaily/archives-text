# OLYMPICS ARE DEFEATED
## VARSITY WINS ON SATURDAY BY SCORE OF 12 TO 5. Cardinal Halters Show Good Form and Win Game With Timely Hits. 
### 
An exhibition of ragged baseball
resulted in a victory for the Cardin
al over the Olympics last Saturday
afternoon. Numerous errors, com
bined with timely and well-bunched
hits, were responsible for the large
score of 12 to 5. Goodell and Hou
gaard were the opposing twirlers,
and both were hit freely, although
Stanford was the more successful in
lining out safeties at opportune mo
ments.
The Cardinal started off in the
first inning by tallying three times
on a succession of errors by third
baseman Erlin, of the Olympics. No
more scoring occurred until the
fourth, but from then until the end
of the game not an inning passed
with one or the other of the con
testing nines registering at least one
run. The Cardinal bunched their
hits in the seventh and eighth in
nings, sending five players across
the plate in those two periods. The
heavy batting alone enlivened an
otherwise listless game.
The feature of the afternoon was
Scofield's spectacular catch of Par
ker's long drive in the eighth. Cap
tain Feriton celebrated his first,
match since his injury by a pair of
timely singles and also by playing
a fast fielding game.
