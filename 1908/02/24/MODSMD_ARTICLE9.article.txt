It is most unfortunate that the
negotiations with California in re
sard to securing another shell for
training our Freshman crew have re
sulted unfavorably. Manager Knupp
had expected that there would be no
difficulty in renting a shell from Cali
fornia and the result, of Coach Tur
ner's visit to Berkeley on Saturday
came as a surprise to Knupp. The
situation, as explained by the Cali
fornia boating manager, is simply
this: California has three shells, but
desires to keep one in absolutely
perfect condition and not use it un
til the intercollegiate regatta. This
means that they have but two for
practice, and cannot spare one for
us to use unless they see fit to use
their best shell for practice; instead
of keeping it. on the shelf until the
big regatta.
As a result of this sudden an
nouncement Coach Turner lias deter
mined to go ahead with the training
of the Cardinal crews with one eight
shell and do the best we can to de
velop a Freshman crew. This is the
only method we can follow in order
to conform with the agreement in
regard to intercollegiate boating. Al
though it will mean a great deal of
inconvenience for the coaches and
oarsmen, it is expected that we will
be able to have a fairly well trained
Freshman eight. In their efforts to
thus fulfill the agreement, in spite
of the disadvantages under which
they are working, the coaches and
men are to be congratulated.
