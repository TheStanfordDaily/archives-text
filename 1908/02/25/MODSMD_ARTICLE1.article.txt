public by Professor Clark this after
noon and refers to a case which, like
the two already treated by the pre
sent committee, was handed over by
the old body for decision. The mat
ter in question occurred several
weeks ago. It. is believed, however,
that (his action completes the busi
ness left unfinished by Durand's
committee, and that henceforward
only such matters as have arisen
since the beginning of Clark's reg
ime will receive his attention.
