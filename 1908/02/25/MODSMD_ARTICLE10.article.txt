# VARSITY WINS EASILY
## ST. IGNATIUS MM: DEFEATED BY SCORE OF 9 TO 0. Bell's Home Run Is the Feature of Game.-Theile and Mitchell Are Battery. 
### 
The St. Ignatius College nine
proved no match for the Varsity in
the contest this afternoon and the
visitors were shut out by the score
of 9 to 0. It was a fast game, but
there were no interesting features
aside from Hell's long home run in
the first inning when he brought in
three runs. There were a few
changes in the varsity line-up, Bell
playing first, while Scott went in
at second, and Mitchell was again
placed behind the plate. The team
played well and only one error is
credited to Stanford..
Dorland, who pitched for the St.
Ignatius team, struck out six of the
varsity players, but he was hit hard
at, times and allowed several men
to walk. This fact, coupled with
the number of errors piled up by the
losers, accounts for the large score.
Theile and Mitchell constituted the
Cardinal battery throughout the
game and Theile performed consist
ently.
Stanford istarted the scofling in
the first inning when Bell made a
home run after Scott had walked,
Mitchell singled, and Sampson reach
ed first on an error. This placed
four runs to the credit of the Var
sity and another was added in the
fifth by Bell's single, which brought
in Sampson. Three more runs were
made in the seventh on hits by Scott
and Fenton and errors on the part
of St. Ignatius. The final run was
made in the eighth inning on a hit
by Mitchell.
The Varsity will not play again
before leaving for the South.
