The Senior class has offered a
prize of fifty dollars for the person
submitting the best, manuscript for
the annual Senior Farce. This an
nouncement should certainly arouse
the interest of all those who have
ability along this line. However, in
view of the tendency in recent years,
with one exception, it seems that
there is not enough attention paid to
the work of developing clever and
original class farces. Tn the spring
of 1 904, when the Senior class de
termined to present "Patience" in
stead of having the usual college
farce, there was a great deal of crit
icism because of this departure from
(lie old tradition. The custom of pre
senting an original Senior Farce is
long-established, and when such
members of the alumni as W. H.
Irwin and R. E. Renaud should be
lieve it worth while to write com
munications to the"Daily Palo Al
to," as they did in the controversy
in 1 904, we feel that there are
strong reasons for maintaining the
present tradition. There should be
a play presented here in Senior
week that would be distinctly typi
cal of Stanford life, and this is ex
actly what the university communi
ty would most like to see. This year
the Senior Farce committee is par
ticularly anxious to obtain original
farces and especially for the sake of
maintaining the standard of the past,
anyone with ability in this line
should certainly enter the present
com petition.
