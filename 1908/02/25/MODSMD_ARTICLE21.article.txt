# FOREIGNERS IN COLLEGE
## CHEAT NUMBERS IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. Japanese Government Spends $150,- 000 Annually in Sending Students to the United States. 
### 
The Cornell "Sun" has an interest
ing article in regard to the number of
foreign students in American univer
sities. The institutions of the United
States are slowly taking the place
which the German universities have
so long occupied, as centers for for
eign students. The "Sun" contin
ues as follows:
"A parallel with the gradual de
crease in the number of American
students abroad, is found in the in
creasing prestige of collegiate Amer
ica as a cosmopolitan school room,
the intellectual mart of the world.
Of this scholastic flux, the constant
element is the Japanese, for the gen
eral outpouring of the youth of Nip
pon, under subsidy from the Mika
do's government, has been going on
for forty years, directed for the most
part towards the United States.
"There are upwards of 300 Japan
ese students studying in the various
colleges and universities of the Uni
ted States, a number forming about
one and two-tenths per cent of the
Japanese in America, a percentage of
students unequalled in any other for
eign element in our population. In
fact, only one-quarter of one per cent
of our total population are college
students. The largest contingent of
these Japanese students is situated
at New York University, where there
is a colony of 36, while here at Cor
nell, nine Japanese are receiving in
struction.
"Each of the subsidized Japanese
students has an allowance from the
government of about $900 a year, a
sum which may be increased in spe
cial cases by as much as $750 more
for special study and travel. In all
cases an allowance of $100 is made
for an outfit of American clothing,
while, in addition, $350 is allowed
for traveling expenses each way to
the students to go to study in the
Western States and $4 00 to those j
who come to enter our Eastern uni- 1
versities. Thus each student may
cost his home government as high
as $2,150 a year.
"The presence of these Oriental re- j
presentatives in America is signifi- |
cant of Japan's world-wide hunt for j
efficiency and the $150,000 which the
Japanese government annually spends
in sending its best students to for
eign universities, comes back to them
in the form of the most advanced
scientific learning and the latest ed
ucational methods. About half of the
Japanese scholars in America are un
der government subsidy, while the
remainder are working at their own
expense. All of them, however, re
turn to their native country and add
their gleanings of knowledge to her
advancement."
