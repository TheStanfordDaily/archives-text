# Senior Farce Must He a Good One.
## 
### 
The Senior Farce committee an
nounces that unless a manuscript is
submitted before April 1 which is
worthy to take the prize of $50 which
has been offered, and of being played
during Senior Week, that the prize
will not be awarded. In this case
the committee will not bring in a
professional play, but will revive
one of the Senior Farces written by
Stanford men in the past.
