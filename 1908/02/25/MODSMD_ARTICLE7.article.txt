# SERVICES NEXT FRIDAY
## ANNIVERSARY OF DEATH OF MRS. JANE L. STANFORD. Simple Services at .Mausoleum Will Commemorate Decease of Last Surviving Founder. 
### 
Short memorial services in honor
of the late Mrs. .lane L. Stanford will
lie conducted by Rev. Mr. D. Charles
Gardner at the Mausoleum at half
past four next Friday, the third an
niversary of the death of the last
surviving founder of the University.
The ceremonies for the afternoon
will include an address by itev. Mr.
Gardner and singing by the Choir.
The first memorial services, which
were held in the Memorial Church,
were conducted by Mr. Gardner and
Dean Hodges, and were much the
same as those at the funeral of Mrs.
Stanford. Since the destruction of
the Memorial Church the memorial
services have been held at the Maus
oleum. Further announcement of
the services will appear in Thurs
day's paper.
Mrs. Stanford died in Honolulu on
February 2S, 1905, and the commem
oration services are the outgrowth
of the love which the students bore
her. The custom of the Senior class
in appointing two of its members to
see that flowers are placed weekly
at the Mausoleum originated from
this same source. Mrs. Stanford was
the last of the founders to survive
and her death, which came very sud
denly, was a source of great grief to
all connected with the whole Univer
sity.
