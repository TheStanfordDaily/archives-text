# VARSITY TO GO SOUTH
## CARDINAL NINE LEAVES FOR LOS ANGELES TOMORROW. Will Meet St. Vincent's Team on Friday and Saturday.â€”Eleven Men to Make the Trip. 
### 
Coach Presley and eleven men,
comprising the varsity baseball
squad, will leave tomorrow after
noon on the 4:22 train, going to
San .lose, where they will catch the
Snnset Express tor Los Angeles. The
team will reach the Southern City
early the next morning. On Fri
day and Saturday two games will
be played between the Cardinal and
St. Vincent's nines, and immediately
after the second of these the Stan
ford squad will leave for the Uni
versity, reaching the Campus Sun
day morning. Although it is usual
for the Varsity to take a somewhat
extended trip during the season, this
is the first time that Los Angeles
has been their destination.
The eleven men to take the trip
are: Theile and Witmer pitchers;
Mitchell and Ganong, catchers; Bell,
first base; Scott, second base; Samp
son, shortstop; Fenton, third base;
Owen, left field: Wirt, center field;
McGregor, right field. On Friday
Witmer and Ganong will officiate as
the battery, but on Saturday they
will be replaced by Theile and Mitch
ell.
The new varsity line-up, with Scott
on second and Bell covering first,
worked admirably in the contest with
St. Ignatius yesterday, and it is
probable that this arrangement will
be indefinitely continued.
Little is known of the St. Vincent's
nine, but it is believed that the col
legians are represented this season
by an exceptionally strong aggrega
tion. No well-known names appear
in their line-up, but the team is very
evenly balanced and plays well to
gether. Their nine is as follows:
Lamer and Kerfoot, pitchers; Grin
die, catcher; O'Rourke, first base;
Yabarrando, second base; Flick,
shortstop; Corbin, third base; Cal
lahan, left, field; Gray, center field;
Brannen, right field.
