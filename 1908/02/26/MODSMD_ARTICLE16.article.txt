"Editor 'Daily Palo Alto':
1 wish to record my appreciation
of the line instinct which prompt
ed Captain Lanagan and his men to
give up their track meet on Friday
when they realized that the day
marked the anniversary of Mrs.
Stanford's death.
"And another proof of the sensi
tiveness of Stanford men came to my
notice recently, namely, the thought
fulness of the Junior class in put
ting the date of their opera beyond
Good Friday. These may seem small
matters, but they are typical of a
spirit of self sacrifice and thought
fulness of which T could give many
evidences.
One fact is that there is much
more real spontaneous goodhearted
ness hereabouts than appears in the
columns of the daily press."
"Yours sincerely,
"D. CHARLES GARDNER."
