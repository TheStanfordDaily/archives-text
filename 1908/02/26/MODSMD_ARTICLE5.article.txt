# AWAITING ROWING DATE
## WORD FROM CALIFORNIA MAY COME TOMORROW. Manager Knupp Will Communicate With Washington When California Date Is Fixed. 
### 
Manager Knupp is only waiting
to learn the date on which the Uni
versity of California is willing to
row the intercollegiate regatta be
fore he informs the University of
Washington when a triangular re
gatta may be held. Assistant Coach
Turner has written to Manager Tys
sowski, of the boating interests at
California, asking that the race be
tween the two universities be held
at a time corresponding to last year's
date, and expects to hear definite
word tomorrow.
The proposition to bring Washing
ton down this year, as was done last,
was discussed three weeks ago by
Managers Knupp and Snedigar, who
looked on the matter favorably. The
guarantee which has been offered
Washington is the first $100 netted
by the two universities of this state
from the observation train which will
be run during the regatta.
The Northwestern Pacific Railway
has given Managers Knupp and Sned
igar strong assurances that at least
$1000 will be taken by the railroad
for tickets on the observation train.
This amount was taken in by the
railroad last year. The tariff
charged by the railroad company for
a seat from which to view the race
was one dollar last year and the
same will probably prevail next Ap
ril. The railroad expects that by
increasing the capacity of the train,
as there was not room enough to
accomodate the prospective patrons
last year, more than $1000 will be
received.
Half of the gross receipts from
the observation train go to the two
universities. Last year California and
Stanford received $.">OO. This year
the guarantee to Washington is to
be the first $400 netted by the uni
versities. Washington has not yet
answered the proposition made her
by California and Stanford, but will
probably accept when the date for
the intercollegiate regatta on Rich
ardson's Bay is fixed.
