# DISCUSS ROWING DATE
## MANAGER SNEDIGAR COMES HERE TO SETTLE QUESTION. California Wants Intercollegiate Regatta on April 11 and Stanford Favors April 
### 
Graduate Manager O. F. Snedigar,
of California, arrived on the Campus
this afternoon for the purpose of
meeting Manager Knupp and the Ex
ecutive Committee and arranging the
date for the intercollegiate regatta.
It is not likely that the two managers
will be able to settle this affair sat
isfactorily, and Manager Snedigar
will probably appear before the Ex
ecutive Committee tonight. At pre
sent there is considerable difference
between the dates that are favored
by the two universities. California
wishes to have the regatta on either
April I 1 or 18, and would prefer Ap
ril 11. While Stanford favors a later
date, and suggests April 25, which is
about the date on which the con
test was held last year. The Cali
fornia representatives are asking for
an early date because of the fact
that the final examinations begin ;if
California on April 22 and they do
not wish to keep their men in train
ing during examination week.
Captain Dean Witter, of the Cal
ifornia crew, made the following
statement this afternoon: "We had
a meeting of our executive commit
tee last night. The action taken
was that the last date we can row
on is April 18, but we would much
prefer the 11th. Our examinations
start on the 22d, and we could not
possibly row on the 25th. Gradu
ate Manager Snedigar will go down
to Stanford and try to see some
members of the Executive Commit
tee there. He should be there this
afternoon or this evening, and will
probably be able to settle the ques
tion."
The letter which states Stanford's
position in the matter was written
by Assistant Coach Turner on Feb
ruary 24, and follows:
"Dear Tyssowski:
"Upon my return I talked over the
matter with the men concerned here,
with the following result. They do
not believe that rowing should be i
made subservient to any other in
tercollegiate sport and should have
a day of its own: that rowing re
quires a longer and harder training
than either track or baseball ami
should be held after these contests,
illowing the baseball and track men
to see the contest. We cannot row
before April 25, 1908, but are will
ing to row then or any time after
that date, that California should see
fit to row. The race was rowed at i
this time last year and a change was
never spoken of until quite recent
ly. We assumed the date was fixed I
by precedent.. I hope you will see
fit to fix this date at your conven- j
ience any time after the date men
tioned. This must be done imined- j
iately in order that Washington may j
be informed.
"Very sincerely,
"F W. TURNER."
Neither Manager Knupp nor Man
ager Snedigar favor holding there- 1

gatta on April is. The California
manager said he believed it would
be suicidal from a. finarn ial stand
point to bold tbe regatta on the same
date as (lie intercollegiate track
meet.
