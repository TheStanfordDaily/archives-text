Tomorrow will mark the third an
niversary of the death of Mrs. Stan
ford. It. has already become a tra
dition that on this day memorial
services shall be held at the Mauso
leum, and such services will take
place at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. In
the establishment of such a fine cus
tom the members of the Student
Body should take a serious interest.
There are not many undergraduates
here now who had the good fortune
of knowing Mrs. Stanford during her
life, but to all of us her memory is
sacred as that of one of the finest
types of womanhood. When we real
ize that it is largely due to the
sacrifices and liberality of this wo
man that we have the advantages
of the University, we must also real
ize that it is asking very little of us
in return to give an hour once a year
to the observance of memorial ser
vices in her honor at the Mausoleum.
Every member of the Student Body
should attend these services tomor
row in the spirit of loving memory;
not as a religious duty. In this way
ii fine tradition will be fostered and
another worthy custom made a part
of our Stanford life.
