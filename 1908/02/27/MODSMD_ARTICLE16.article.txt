# "SEQUOIA" OUT TOMORROW.
## Caustic Comment Is Made Upon the Much-Discussed Drinking Problem. 
### 
The February number of the "Se
quoia" will be on sale on the Quad
tomorrow morning. The number is
illustrated and contains an original
cover design in red by Bellows.
The principal article is an expose
ol" last year's Junior opera, which
was stolen from a play written by
Richard Harding Davis. Parallel
lines are given, and the two plays
are discussed from beginning to end,
showing where the author took his
situations and lines.
In the fiction department Miss
Jennet Johnson has a story entitled
"Gardens," and Miss L. B. Mirrie
lees another story on "Politics in
Siam." F. E. Hill, a new contribu
tor, has some good short verse.
"Some Examination Pointers," by
H. C. Green, is a special article writ
ten after an examination of some of
the records of the Registrar's office,
showing an alarming percentage of
failures among the Seniors and
among upperclassmen on the Row.
The editorial discussion is wholly
confined to the present agitation
against the "steam beer wave," in
which the editor explains the atti
tude of the men of the University
and belittles the seriousness of the
situation. The old and new Student
Affairs Committees are discussed, al
so the actions already taken by the
new committee. The editor goes
straight to the point and calls for
reform by both sides, and also an
swers a communication sent, to the
public press by "An Old Stanford
Student."
