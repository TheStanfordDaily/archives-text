were gathered in the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans by a number of noted
scientists on board the United States
scientific ship, Albatross.
Professor C. 11. Gilbert, head of
the Zoology department, who has
accompanied several scientific expe
ditions on the Albatross, considers
the gift of the government to be an
