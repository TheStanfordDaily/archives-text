# APPOINTS QUAD BOARD
## F.A. ADAMS ANNOUNCES NAMES OF THIRTEEN ASSISTANTS. New Board Will Begin Their Work on March 31.No Plans Formulated as Yet. 
### 
F. A. Adams, editor of the 1910
"Quad," has announced the names
of thirteen Sophomores who will
compose the board which will assist
him in the production of the next
Junior annual. The names of those
receiving this appointment are: Miss
H. T. Thompson, Miss M. Kaufman,
A. S. Macdonald, F. M. Ackley, L.
Scott, J. P. Levy, W. P. Fuller, Jr.,
C. H. Hails, S. A. Lindauer, L. G.
Avery, L. O. Macomber, T. C. Henry,
C. P. Happy.
This number is larger than the
"Quad" board which was appointed
by Editor IJruning to take charge of
the 1909 book, as he limited his as
sistants to eight. It is about the
same as the 1908 and previous
boards in point of size and the work
will be distributed in much the same
manner.
Practically all the members on the
newly appointed board have been
identified with journalistic work or
other literary work in the Univer
sity. Editor Adams has not yet an
nounced his plans for the 1910 book,
but will call a meeting of his board
in the near future when plans will
be discussed and the work appor
tioned among the various members.
The actual work of the new editor
and board will begin about March
31, as the 1909 annual will close
its college year with the Junior Week
festivities. In the athletic depart
ment, however, the 1910 editors will
begin the collection of material at.
once, as the present "Quad" will
not cover the current track, base
ball. or boating season.
