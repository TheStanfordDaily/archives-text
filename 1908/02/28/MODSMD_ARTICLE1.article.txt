# CONSIDER REGATTA DATE
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONFERS WITH SNEDIGAR. Manager Knupp Goes To Berkeley to Learn Decision on Race.â€”May Row on a Week Day. 
### 
The question of a date for the in
tercollegiate regatta was the sole top
ic of discussion at the meeting of
the Executive Committee held last
night, and in spite of the fact that
Manager O. F. Snedigar, of the As
sociated Students of the University
of California, was present no final
conclusion was reached and the ques
tion remains practically undecided.
Manager Snedigar came here yester
day afternoon and met Manager
Knupp with the request that the
date of the regatta be moved two
weeks nearer and fall upon April 11
instead of April 25. Knupp would
not consent to this proposition and
it was taken up before the Execu
tive Committee as a result.
Snedigar states that the date as
set at present would make it impos
sible for the seniors of the lllue and
Gold crew to row, as it would fall
in the middle of the senior examin
ation week. The argument advanced
by the Executive Committee last
night was apparently convincing to
the California manager that an ear
lier date for the regatta than April
20 would be impossible for the lo
cal crews, and he will take the mat
ter iip again with the oarsmen of
the University of California.
As the examinations begin April
2 2 at the University of California,
the California men contend that the
race cannot be held on or after that
date. Stanford will not row before
the 18th, and the race will not be
held on this date as it would come
the same day as the intercollegiate
track meet. Probably the date set.
for the regatta will be either Mon
day, April 20, or Tuesday, April 21.
The day on which the tides are most
advantageous will be chosen, and
Manager Knupp will probably return
front Berkeley Saturday or Sunday
with definite information as to when
the two Varsities will row.
