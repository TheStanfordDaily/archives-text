It is unfortunate that the repre
sentatives of California and Stanford
cannot come to an understanding in
regard to the date of the intercol
legiate regatta, so that it may he
held on a Saturday. At, the present
stage of the negotiations it is evi
dent that an agreement upon a Sat
urday is highly improbable. Cali
fornia wishes to row on April 1 1,
while we would like to have the re
gatta held on April 25. The only
intermediate Saturday is that on
which the intercollegiate track meet
will be held. Consequently, if nei
ther university sees fit to change its
attitude on the question, the regat
ta will have to be held upon a week
day. This will in all probability be

the result of the present negotiations
and it appears to be the only solu
tion of the problem. From a finan
cial standpoint it may be a severe
handicap to hold the regatta upon a
week day, but Stanford will not be
in a position to row before April 20,
while the examinations begin at Cal
ifornia on April 22, and for this rea
son the Blue and Gold representa
tives wish the regatta held before
this date. It is unfortunate that
this disagreement, should arise, and
it would be wise to establish a per
manent date for the intercollegiate
regatta in future.
