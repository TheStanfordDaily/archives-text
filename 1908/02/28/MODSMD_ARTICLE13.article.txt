# PADEREWSKI ENTERTAINS.
## Famous Pianist Is Greeted By Unusually Large Crowd in Assembly Hall. 
### 
Ignace Paderewski pleased an au
dience of about 1 700 people who
crowded Assembly Hall to the doors
last evening in the final recital of the
season given under the auspices of
the Faculty Committee on Entertain
ments. The great pianist fully dis
played his wonderful technique, and
his interpretation called forth re
peated bursts of applause. Perhaps
the most logical criticism which may
be advanced as to the performance
would not reflect upon Paderewski as
a musician but upon him as the se
lector of his program. Of tlie num
bers rendered last night several were
not as familiar to the audience as
some other selections of the same
composers.
The contrast of expression which
Paderewski commanded was one of
the most noticeable qualities of the
artist's rendering of the difficult pro
gram. in the first number, of his
own composition, Paderewski ap
peared in all of his moods. Commenc
ing with a thundering phrase, he
ran the gamut of expression. His
heavy notes as compared with the
velvet touch in the passages of dou
ble pianissimo were at a decided con
trast.
Beethoven's Sonata, Opus 27, No.
1, was ably rendered and was fol
lowed by three selections of Schu
bert and Liszt, which, with the Cho
pin numbers, were among the most
pleasing of the evening. Chant
D'Amour, by Stojowsky, and the
Rhapsodie Hongroise, No. 13, by
Liszt, completed the program of the
evening.
The great pianist was generous
with his encores, which were three
light, numbers by Chopin.
