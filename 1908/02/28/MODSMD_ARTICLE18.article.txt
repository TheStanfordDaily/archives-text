# TRYOUT MEET TOMORROW
## WILL SELECT ATHLETES FOR SOUTHERN TRIP. Men Who Can Enter Two Events Will Receive First Consideration.—Officials Appointed. 
### 
Unless excessively heavy rains pre
vent, the tryout meet for the selec
tion of the fifteen or more men who
will compete with the athletes of
the University of Southern Califor
nia in Los Angeles on March 7, will
be held tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock.
Captain Lanagan states that the
selection of the men will not be
based on tomorrow's performances
alone, but that the men will be chos
en primarily for their ability to en
ter more than one event, owing to
the limited number which can be
taken on the trip. The point-taking
ability in competition with the U.
S. C. entries, based on a knowledge
of the Southerners' performances
this season, will also be taken into
consideration.
The two-mile run will be the first
race of the day and Maundrell, J.
E. Shelton, Sweet, and W. W. Ad
ams will probably enter this race.
Nash and Macgregor will run in the
mile and W. S. Porter, '11, may be
switched to this event. Miller will
enter the half, but it is not decid
ed in what other event he
will compete. Brown has not been
feeling well during the past week
and has shown a slump in form,
which may cause "Dad" to give him
a rest and keep him out of the meet
tomorrow.
The 220-yard dash will be run on
the course in order to accustom the
men to making the turn on a curved
track in Los Angeles. The track at
Bovard field has very sharp turns
which are only slightly banked. It
is not improbable that Trainer
Holmes will insist on running the
22 0-yard relay instead of a 440 relay
as will be run with California.
The officials tomorrow are: star
ter—F. R. Lanagan, '08; clerk of
the course—F. D. Mahone, '08; tim
ers—"Dad" Moulton, W. P. Fuller,
Jr., '10, C. R. Young, '0 9; judges
of the finish—T. R. Cadwalader, '09,
W. Koerner, '08, T. T. Bennett, '08,
A. Drew, '10; measurers—high and
broad jumps, F. A. Adams, '10, and
P. C. Giesy, '10; shot and hammer,

'l! 8; pole vault, G. B. McLain, '08,
