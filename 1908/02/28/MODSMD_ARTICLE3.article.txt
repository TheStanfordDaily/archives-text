said: "We all deeply regret the fact
that Professor Farrand has resigned
and will leave Stanford. He stands
in the front rank of American his
torians of the present day, as well
as being a fine executive. His de
parture is due not only to the strong
graduate school of History at Yale,
but also because of the fact that his
new position will place him within
easy reach of the great libraries of
the East, and particularly those at
Washington.it. is in this respect
that he will be in a better position
