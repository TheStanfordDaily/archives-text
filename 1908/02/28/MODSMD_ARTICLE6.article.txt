# SERVICES IN CHAPEL
## ANNIVERSARY OF FOUNDER'S DEATH IS MARKED. Students Honor Memory of Mrs. Stanford, and Dr. Gardner Tells of Her Work. 
### 
On account of the ruin, the mem
orial services commemorating the
death of Mrs. Stanford were held in
the Chapel this afternoon. Several
hymns were sung by the congrega
tion, and the choir rendered an an
them by Stainer. Rev. Mr. Gardner,
the University chaplain, gave a short
address, in which he emphasized the
fact that Mrs. Stanford's greatest and
most enduring contribution to the
University was her fostering of the
spirit of morality and religion. Mr.
Gardner said in part: "Time proves
what is permanent in human work.
And time has already emphasized the
value of one element in the life of
Stanford which, I believe, represents
the genius of Mrs. Stanford's per
sonal life and her ideal for the Uni
versity.
"In the final estimate of Mrs. Stan
ford's share in founding and foster
ing the University, one principal will
stand out clear—her emphasis upon
morals and religion in relation to
education,
"The Memorial Church is the out
ward and visible sign that the good
mother of the University desired its
sons and daughters to be brought up
to lead a Godly and a Christian life.
Looking back over my ten years'
work here, I can say that religion
has taken an ever increasing place
in the life of Stanford University.
With the restoration of the Church
will come again the fine services
which expressed the religious aspir;*-
tions Sunday by Sunday. But, in
the meantime, this question presents
itself: Are you, am I, doing all wo
can to maintain the religious life of
the University? Are we regular in
attendance at public worship? Are
we standing up and counting one
against the excesses of student life?
Are we examples of Christian man
hood and womanhood in our homes
and fraternities and clubs?
"These questions may properly bo
asked upon such an occasion, for,
believe me, we shall honor Mrs. Stan
ford's memory, not only by admiring
and/ eulogizing her chjaracter and
her work, but by striving to imi
tate her good example, and by stand
ing true to her principles."
