The announcement that. Professor
Max Farrand will leave Stanford
comes as a distinct surprise to the
Student. Body. In the loss of such
a man as Professor Farrand the
members of the Student. Body exper
ience the same feeling that was ex
pressed here a year ago when Dr.
Abbott's resignation was announced.
Although Professor Farrand has not
been as intimately connected with
the University during the struggles
of its earliest days, nevertheless,
since coming here seven years ago
he has won the same position in the
estimation of the Student Body as
was held by the former head of the
Law department. Not only as head
of the History department has Pro
fessor Farrand done much for the
University, but by his active inter
est in undergraduate affairs and his
cordial relations with so many of
the students, he has done a great
deal toward developing that sort of
"Stanford Spirit" of which we are
justly proud. In his departure we
lose not only an able scholar but also
a wise counsellor and a true friend
ot the Student Body.
