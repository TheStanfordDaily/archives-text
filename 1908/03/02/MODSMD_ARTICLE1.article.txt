The men accompanied by Trainer
Moulton and Manager Knupp, will
leave on the 4:22 train next. Thurs
day afternoon, and will compete with
the southern team on Bovard Field
Saturday afternoon. This will give
the athletes a rest of twenty-four
hours after reaching Los Angeles, in
which to recover from the effects of
their journey.
Nearly every member of this team
will enter at least two events, and
some will compete in three, counting
the relay race, which will be run
with 220-yard laps. This should be
a strong event for Stanford, as a
team of 220 men can be selected
from Reed, Holman, Brown, Wyman,
Miller, Bellah a>nd Bradley.
Sweet, Brown, Wyman, Bellah and
Martin are all new men on the var
sity squad, but their work in the
preliminary meets has been uniform
ly good and fully justifies their se
lection. Sweet has been steadily im
proving in the two-mile, where he
shows unusual strength, and with
coaching should win from the South
erners. Wyman has shown good form
in both the 220-yard dash and the
quarter, while Brown is good for a
place in both the middle distances.
Bellah will be Lanagan's team-mate
in the pole-vault and will also enter
the broad jump. Martin has been
consistently winning the high jump
in the local meets and has reached
the â– "> feet. 10 mark on more than
one occasion. This will be the only
event in which Stanford will have
only one entry against. U. S. C.
