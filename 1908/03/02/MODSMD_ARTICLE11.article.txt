The intercollegiate difficulty in re
gard to the date for the annual re
gatta appears to be as much of a
problem as when the discussion first
arose. Each side has made a defi
nite statement upon the matter and
it now seems to be a case where com
promise would be advisable. There
ought to be some decision reached
at once, as it reflects no credit on
either university to have a continual
wrangle over a date for the regatta.
