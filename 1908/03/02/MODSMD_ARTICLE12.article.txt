We would like to call attention to
the fact that prizes have been offer
ed by the English Club for the best
short story and the best poem sub
mitted for the April issue of the "Se
quoia." in view of the fact that
the 1 909 "Quad" has not offered any
such prizes this year, and there have
been opinions expressed in regard to
the decadence of interest in literary
efforts at. Stanford, the present offer
by the English Club is timely. If
there is anywhere near the amount
of interest in this line of work that
we should expect, the English Club
will obtain some good stories and
poems. It is to be hoped that all
those with any inclination in this
direction will enter the present com
petition.
