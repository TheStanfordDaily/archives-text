# WIN BASKETBALL GAME
## WOMEN PLAYERS DEFEAT SAN JOSE NORMAL. Stanford Team Wins By Score of 12 to 8 in a Hard-Fought Contest. 
### 
Saturday afternoon, in a hard
fought game, the Stanford basketball
team defeated San Jose Normal
School by the score of 12-8. The
game was called in San Jose at 2:00
o'clock. In the first half, the excel
lent playing of the jumping center
and one of the forwards of the Nor
mal School team was more than a
match for the team work of the Stan
lord players, and the score was 6-2.
In the second half, however, the
Stanford team, by cool, steady play
ing, brought the score up to a vie
tory. The game was the roughest
one that has been played here for
the last two years. The work of the
Stanford guards was particularly ef
fectual, and they played in much bet
ter form than they have in any of
the previous games of the semester.
The San Jose Normal School team
is generally conceded to be better
than the California team, although
the two have not played together
and this victory has been very en
couraging to the coaches. The line
up of the Stanford team was as fol
lows: forwards—Miss H. Ward, '08,
(capt.), Miss R. Sampson, '10, Miss
B. Haig, '10; centers —Miss S. Bun
dy, '10, Miss R. Blodgett, '09, Miss
L. Mirrilees, '09; guards—Miss E.
Haywood, '10, Miss S. Hunter, '10,
Miss P. Abright, '08; substitutes—
Miss H. Hardison, '11, Miss E. James,
'10.
