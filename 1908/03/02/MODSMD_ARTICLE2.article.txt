# Varsity Plays at Santa Clara.
## 
### 
Tomorrow on the Santa Clara dia
mond the Varsity will cross bats
with the Collegians in the third
game of the season. Santa Clara
won both of the preceding matches,
which were fast and close, the scores
being 2 to 1 and 1 to 0. The usually
effective Kilburn will again be in
the box for the opposing team.
