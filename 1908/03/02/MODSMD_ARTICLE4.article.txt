# VARSITY BREAKS EVEN
## ONE VICTORY AND A DEFEAT ON SOUTHERN TRIP. St. Vincent's Wins on Saturday By Score of 4 to O.—Interclass Final Tomorrow. 
### 
After decisively defeating their op
ponents on Friday, the Cardinal nine
was worsted by the St. Vincent's
team by a score of 4 to 0 on Satur
day. Theile was hit almost at will
by the Southerners, ten safe drives
being registered off his delivery,
while the Stanford batters connect
ed only five times with the curves of
Ybarrando. Nor was the hitting of
the St. Vincent's nine the sole cause
of their victory, for the Los An
geleans fielded errorlessly, while
three misplays were credited to the
Cardinal.
The scoring was started in the
third inning when the Southerners
opened up a lead of a single tally.
However, this was increased to four
in the next frame. Although no
more runs were obtained during the
remaining periods, there was plenty
ot' hitting. Stanford hit safely twice
in the last, but was unable to get a
man across the plate.
The victory in Friday's game was
due chiefly to Witmer's effective
ness and to the evident fright of the
opposing nine. On Saturday, howev
er, St. Vincent's played with the
greatest of confidence from the start.
The score follows:
