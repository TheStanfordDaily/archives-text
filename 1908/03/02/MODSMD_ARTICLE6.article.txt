# TRYOUT MEET A SUCCESS
## GOOD TIME MADE ON SOFT TRACK SATURDAY. Maundrell Runs a Fast Two Mile in 10:22.2.—Horton Puts Shot Over 44 Feet. 
### 
The tryout track meet Saturday
morning developed some excellent
performances, in spite of the fact
that a soft and slippery track tend
ed to lower the time. The pole-vault,
hammer-throw, shot-put and low
hurdles were omitted from the list.
The best race of the day was the
two-mile, which Maundrell, though
suffering from an injured ligament
in his leg, won in (he good time of
10:22.2 after one of the pluckiest
runs seen on (he track this year.
Sweet showed a strong sprint at the
finish and would have made a close
finish if lie had started sooner to
close up on Maundrell's lead.
Bradford's time of 4:45 in the mile
was good for the condition of the
track. E. A. McGregor, 'OS, pushed
him hard for the place, and W. S.
Porter, '11, showed good form though
lie was not. in condition for such a
long race.
In practice, Horton put the shot
4 4 feet 5 inches, which shows that
he is again in the form shown two
weeks ago. Wyman won the quar
ter after a hard fight with Coonan,
in 0:54. Brown did not enter the
meet.
