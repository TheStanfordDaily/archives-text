# DO NOT DETERMINE DATE
## MANAGERS HAVE NOT AGREED ON REGATTA. Turner Visits Coach Murphy In San Francisco and Finds Him Rid of His Fever. 
### 
No agreement has been reached
| for the date of the intercollegiate re
j gatta. Manager Snedigar, of the Uni
versity of California, went back to
Berkeley Friday, leaving the impres
sion that he would try to have the
California men agree to row Stanford
,as late as April 20. Captain Dean
| Witter, of the California crew, made
I a visit to the Campus Saturday and
informed Manager Knupp that the
; California men would row on April
11 or not at all.
Stanford's position was set forth
in the letter which Coach Turner
sent to Boating Manager Tyssowski,
at California, and in the last, meeting
of the Executive Committee. Coach
Turner v stated that Stanford was will
ing to row on April 25 or any date
thereafter which California might
be pleased to name. At the meet
ing held last Thursday evening the
Executive Committee recognized the
contention of the California men that
rowing later than April 21 would
; interfere with the examinations at
| the State University, and agreed that
the race could be held about April
20 or 21. Until further developments
come to light, the date when the
race will be held will be a question
! which technically lies with the grad
; uate managers for settlement,
j Coach Turner visited Coach Mur
i phy in San Francisco Friday and
found him improving. His tempera
ture record shows that the typhoid
fever has left him, so that his recov
ery is a matter of convalesence. Tur
ner was unable to see Dr. Hicewolt,
who is in charge of Coach Murphy,
and so did not learn how soon Mur
phy could be brought to the Campus.
His recovery is slow, so that the
date of his coming is uncertain, but
it will be in the near future.
