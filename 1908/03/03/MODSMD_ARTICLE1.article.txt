of E. Horner, '09, and Miss R. A.
Roberts, '09, respectively. The parts

fin. '11.

The chorus will be garbed as tour
ists, natives, dancing girls, attend
ants and imperial guards. The cos
tuming of the chorus and the prin
cipals will be unique >and origin
al and will be greatly varied. The di
verse characters of the people in
the opera allow many different kinds
of costumes to be worn. The op
portunity for color display and con
trast will be fully realized in the
production.
Color, music and scenic effects will
all be used to the best advantage
with the harmonious luxuriance
which is to be seen in an island of
the tropics. The two salient features
of the book are the action, which is
quick and steady, and the humor,
which promises to provoke an unu
sual number of laughs.
The music is by far the prettiest
which has been used here in an
opera, and the principals who have
the leading parts are fortunate in
possessing remarkably good voices.
The chorus will be the largest ever
used on Assembly Hall stage and
will be a full four-part chorus, in
cluding forty people in its tenors,
sopranos, altos, and basses.
