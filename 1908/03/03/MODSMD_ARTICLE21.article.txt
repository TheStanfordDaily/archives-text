# REGULATION OF DRINKING
## INTERESTING ARTICLES TELL OF PRINCETON INN. Prominent Men Write of Solution of Drinking Problem at that University. 
### 
The following articles regarding
the Princeton Inn have been obtained
from reliable authorities by the
President's office. These are of in
terest in view of the suggestions that
have been made recently, that an
inn, modeled on similar lines, if es
tablished here would solve the so
called "drinking problem." The ar
ticles are submitted by the President
without comment.
"A former manager of the Prince
ton Inn writes:
" 'The business of the Inn from
September when it opens until De
cember is good; from vthen until
April it is very poor, and from then
until June it is very good. We do
a good business in dinners, lunches,
suppers and smokers. We have a
few dances and would have more if
we had a good dancing floor.
" 'Downstairs is the grill room for
the students. The rules of the grill
are as follows: Only Juniors and
Seniors are allowed in the grill. No
thing is sold but soft drinks, beer
and ale, and the room is closed at
11 p. m. We have a regular liquor
license, but don't sell any liquor to
undergraduates. Guests of the house
and outsiders can have what they
want in the cafe, which is on the
office floor. In the hotel there are
fifty rooms, fifteen of them with pri
vate bath.'
"An eminent professor at Prince
ton writes as follows regarding the
Inn and the regulations governing
it:
" 'Liquor was soid and is sold still
in two ways: first, to patrons of the
hotel in any form and quantity. Of
course they would be restrained if
their behavior became improper. This
liquor is seldom used by students;
second, it is sold to students and
their men friends in a separate grill
room where an experienced man
keeps order and sees that no one
drinks too much. Only beer is sold
here, if I recollect, and while the
men are noisy and sing and laugh a
great deal, there is practically no ab
solute drunkenness or disorder. The
room is closed promptly at 11 p. m.
and is arranged by a separate en
trance, etc., so that the patrons of
the hotel will see and hear nothing
of the students.
" 'The university authorities have
since bought( two years ago) the
other hotel in town and arranged the
drinking question rn a somewhat
freer manner, students being on an
equal footing at this bar with the
public. They often drink too much,
here, but are liable to punishment,
the same as if they had been intem
perate in some public saloon. They
seldom go into the other saloons
although some do and get drunk. On
occasions the men buy bottled liquor
and get drunk on the campus. They
are very promptly punished in vari
ous ways, and usually very severe
ly. The great trouble with drink
here is in connection with our re
turning graduates who come back in
a body and, not. being amenable to
the university authorities hold
wild reunions at which they not. on
ly get drunk but try to bring in stu
dents. We have improved this ques
tion slightly in the past five years.' "
