# "QUAD" BOARD ACTIVE
## EDITOR BRUNING HOPES TO GO TO PRESS ON APRIL 1. College Year and Athletics To Be Given Special Attention.â€” Last Junior Pictures Taken. 
### 
The work of compiling material
for the 1909 "Quad" is rapidly near
ing completion. The majority of
the events which will be recorded
in the coming edition of the annual
have taken place and the copy for
the greater part has been turned in.
The book will probably be sent to
press the first of April, and the last
events which will be chronicled are
the coming .Junior Week festivities.
None of the athletic events of the
present semester will be included in
the volume.
The last call for data and photo
graphs of university organizations,
honor societies, and clubs, together
with publications, has been sounded
by H. L. Rixford, '09, who has this
department of the book in charge.
The material upon the classes has
been compiled by E. R. Purdum, '09,
and the last of the class pictures of
the Juniors have been taken. Sun
day was the last day and up to date
the number taken was about the av
erage.
One of the main features of the
"Quad" will be the college year de
partment, which was originated by
the editors of the 190S "Quad" as
an experiment. Editor Binning in
tends to devote considerable space
to the portraying of the events of
campus interest during the time cov
ered in the annual. Excellent pho
tographs of the big events, such as
the Plug Ugly and other rushes have
been obtained. G. B. Bush, '09, will
have charge of this department,
which will not be complete until af
ter the Junior Day exercises.
The joshes are accumulating un
der the supervision of M. J. Helmick,
'09, while V. F. Bellows, '09, has
the art work well in hand. In the
recording of the data upon the fac
ulty an innovation will be introduced.
C. B. Bradford, '09, will have charge
of this department as well as that
of the fraternities and sororities.
As the year in athletics covered by
the present "Quad" is probably with
out precedent, a large amount of
space will be devoted to pictures, of
which a good collection of interest
ing snap shots have been obtained.
Several well-known writers have
been asked to contribute to the make
up of the department.
