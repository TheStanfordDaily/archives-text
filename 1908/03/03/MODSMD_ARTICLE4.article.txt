### 
Stanislau Jan Zowski, who lias re
cently come to Hie Michigan Engi
neering department from Germany,
says that American engineering slu
flents accomplish more in four years
of work than Germans do in the same
period. The technical schools of the
two countries are, in his opinion,
very nearly equal. The Charlotten
berg Royal Technical College is the
Kaiser's favorite, and receives large
annual appropriations from the im
perial government, but the best Am
erican schools surpass it. .
