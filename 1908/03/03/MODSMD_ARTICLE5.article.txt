# AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED
## CALIFORNIA RATIFIES ACTION OF AGREEMENT COMMITTEE. Time Limit for Rejecting Proposed Changes Passes With No Word From California. 
### 
As over thirty days have elapsed
since the last meeting of the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee,
which was held in San Francisco late
in January, and no notice has been
received from California relative to
the various amendments passed at
that time, it is to be assumed that
no objection has been made to them,
for each university lias only one
month in which to refuse its ratifica
tion. As Stanford has refused to
adopt the provision concerning the
intercollegiate Freshman baseball
game, only two amendments remain
endorsed by the Cardinal and Blue
and Gold committees. The first of
these refers to the place of the third
varsity baseball match, providing
that, when such a one is necessary,
it shall be played alternately on the
campuses of the two universities.
The other clause that h;is been mu
tually agreed upon makes seven the
maximum number of men that may
be entered by either college in any
event, of the intercollegiate track
meet.
