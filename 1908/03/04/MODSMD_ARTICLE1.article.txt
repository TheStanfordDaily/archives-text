# HAVE NOT SETTLED DATE
## MANAGERS MAKE NO FURTHER MOVE AS TO REGATTA. Each University Has Stilted Its Side of the Controversy and Awaits Developments. 
### 
Neither California nor Stanford
has made any further move to set
tle the date on which the intercol
legiate regatta will be held. Each uni
versity has stated its position,
through its graduate managers and
boating representatives. The inter
collegiate agreement leaves the date
of the race to be fixed by the gradu
ate managers of the two universi
ties.
California desires that the regatta
be held on April 11, as that is the
only available Saturday before April
25. This latter date is the one fav
ored by Stanford, and is objected to
by California because it. will come
during examinations at the State
University, which commence on April
2 2. Because the training season is
unusually severe it is claimed that
it would be a hardship to prolong
it into the examination period, which
the boating men cannot be expected
to undergo. The statement has also
been made that the interest of the
students would lag and a regatta on
April 25 would not bring as many
spectators as would see the race on
an earlier date.
Stanford's strongest argument for
holding the regatta on April 25 is
that the Cardinal oarsmen will not
have time to get into condition before
that date. Fall training is well-nigh
impossible here, owing to the fact
that Lagunita has no water until af
ter the opening of the spring semes
ter, and the trips to Redwood in
volve a great deal of time â€”more
than that required to make the trip
back and forth, as the tides cannot
be relied on to furnish water on
which to row. By the installation
of a tank at the State University,
stationary facilities allowing eight
men to train at the same time have
been available since some time last
fall.
Several additional reasons why the
regatta should be held on a date as
late as April 25 and even later, were |
advanced by Coach Turner tin's af
ternoon. "Cold, wet and rainy wea- |
tlier," said Turner, "prevents (lie
Stanford crew candidates from mak
ing the most of their shorter period
of training. As rowing requires a
longer and harder training season
than either track or baseball, the
regatta should come after the in
tercollegiate events in these sports. I
"The bay is not reliable for a race
as early as California wishes to row. \
Even last year, when the regatta I
was scheduled for April 27, the San j
Francisco Yacht Club, which acts on
experienced gained during twenty- '
five years on San Francisco Hay, was |
only opening its season for yachting j
on the regatta day. For this reason,
the race should be held even later
than the latter part of April.
"This year, however, in order that
the race may be over before the ex
aminations at California commence,
we are willing to row as early as
April 20 or 21, although it is to
our disadvantage to do so."
