In another column there appears
an article in which Trainer Christie,
of California, states that there is
a remarkably strong Freshman squad
on the track at California. This fact
should arouse the interest of every
Freshman at Stanford, as it means
that we will have to exert our best
efforts to win the intercollegiate
Freshman meet this year. Califor
nia has won both the intercollegiate
Freshman meets held, and it de
volves upon this year's Freshman
class to break the string of defeats.
As the Class of 1911 at California
is unusually strong on the track,
the task before our Freshmen is a
difficult one. Every man in the class
should take an interest in the track
work and those who are not able to
come out themselves should support
and encourage the men who are do
ing hard work on the track and keep
ing strict training rules, in order
that the third intercollegiate Fresh
man meel may bring a Cardinal vic
tory.
