All persons included in the list of
professors of Yale, whether engaged
in teaching or administration, who
have never taken a degree higher
than Bachelor, have had the degree
of Master of Arts conferred upon
them by the university authorities.
Among the number was Walter
Camp, Yale's football advisor, who is
retained on the rolls as a full pro
fessor.
