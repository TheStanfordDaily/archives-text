# ATHLETES ARE RESTING
## TRACK MEN DO ONLY LIGHT WORK THIS WEEK. Track Is In Need of Cinders.â€”Schedule Is Complete For This Month. 
### 
The work of the track men this
week lias been of a very light char
: acter and it is not probable that the
athletes will do any hard training
before the meet with the University
of Southern California in Los An
geles on Saturday afternoon. The
strain of the races last week on the
slippery track resulted in sore mus
cles for most of the men, so that
a period of light work or complete
rest was deemed advisable before en
; tering a severe meet, such as that
next Saturday.
The cold weather has also hin
dered the work somewhat and those
who have continued their regular
training have not been showing
any marked improvement, since the
; beginning of the present cold wea
ther.
Maundrell's strained ligament lias
bothered him somewhat since his
two-mile race on Saturday, so that
he has remained off the track the
past, few days, in the hope that it
, will be in better condition by the
end of tlie week. Brown is also
taking a rest to regain his strength,
lost by a. period of overtraining.
Nash, on the contrary, is working j
harder than ever, and is beginning
lo get back into the form which he
displayed last year, after suffering i
for over two weeks with a trouble
some case of shin-splints.
The recent rains have not improved
the condition of the track, which
was already in need of cinders, and
in some spots the clay is so near
the surface that the runners are ser- j
iously impeded by the dirt they
pick up.
Owing to the fact that the Varsity
will be away from the Campus next
Saturday there will be no meet with
outside teams, but from that time on,
every Saturday will witness a dual
meet on the local track. The Olym
pic Club will meet the Varsity on
March 1(1, U. S. C. will come north
for March 21, and the intercollegiate
Freshman meet is scheduled for j
March 2S. The fact that the Po- |
niona athletes will compete here on
March 27, the day before the Fresh
man meet, will prevent Stanford
from using the first-year men against
the Southerners, and should serve to
make the score a close one. The Po
mona athletes have shown up well
in preliminary meets and have some
men of recognized ability, especially
in the Held events and hurdles.
