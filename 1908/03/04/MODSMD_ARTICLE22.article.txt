# CHRISTIE WHITES ON TRACK.
## California Trainer Says Freshman Squad Is Strongest Aggregation In Past Seven Years. 
### 
Trainer Walter Christie, of Cali
fornia, has contributed an article to
the"Daily Californian" in which he
comments very favorably upon the
work of the freshman track squad,
and compliments the first year men
for the earnestness which they have
shown in their training. He states
that there are over seventy earnest
workers in the freshman squad,
whicli he considers the best showing
made in the past seven years. He
strongly criticizes the athlete who
is content after he has won his nu
merals or varsity letter, and gives
words of praise to the men who keep
on working even though there seems
no chance of success at first. He
makes no comparisons of the two
freshman teams but says,"I don't
see a single point which we are sure
to win, but I can see how we can
squeeze in a few here and there if
our freshmen can grasp the right
way of doing things. They might
even break a few records."
Christie is giving out no time in
his tryouts in the freshman squad,
but it is understood that the per
formances are above the average in
many events, and the large number
of aspirants from which he can se
lect his team is assurance that the
aggregation is one of the strongest
in some years.
