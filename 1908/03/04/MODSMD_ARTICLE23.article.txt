# JUNIORS MAKE STATEMENT.
## Opera Committee Says that "Butterfly Isle" Is an Original Production. 
### 
The"Daily Palo Alto" has receiv
ed a communication from the Junior
Opera committee in regard to the
care exercised by the committee in
the selection of the "Butterfly Isle,"
the comic opera to be staged by 1 909.
This statement has been issued by
the committee in order that any
charge in regard to the present Jun
ior Opera, such as was brought by
the "Sequoia" in connection with
"La Serena," may be averted.
"Editor of the 'Daily Palo Alto':
"In order to satisfy any doubt in
the mind of the Student Body as
to whether the Junior Opera, to be
produced in Assembly Hall on March
26, is original or otherwise, the Ju
nior Opera committee wishes to
make this statement. Before finally
accepting the opera which has been
selected this year, the manuscript
was submitted to the inspection of
Messrs. Harry James and George
Lask. These gentlemen, who have
staged a great majority of existing
comic operas, read both the prepara
tory and final drafts of the manu
script, and both say that all the ideas
are original. As in all comic operas
the plot and action move along cer
tain lines which comic opera requires.
(Signed)
"JUNIOR OPERA COMMITTEE."
