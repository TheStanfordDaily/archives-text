# ALL-STARS CANCEL GAME
## PROFESSIONAL NINE HAS DISBANDED FOR SEASON. Varsity Will Not Play Tomorrow. Scott May Be Able To Play Saturday. 
### 
Manager Knupp has been notified
of the disbanding of the All-Star
baseball nine for the season, and
consequently the game with that
team, which was scheduled to be
played tomorrow, will not take place.
The All-Stars were made up of pro
fessionals connected with various
teams of the country, and the begin
ning of spring training for many of
the league teams is responsible for
the cancellation of the remaining
games of their schedule.
The next varsity match will occur
on Saturday, when the Cardinal will
cross bats with St. Mary's on the
Campus diamond. As originally
planned, this contest was to be play
ed in Oakland, but Knupp has ar
ranged for the collegians to make
the trip to the University.
Second baseman Scott is at present
at the Guild Hospital suffering from
an attack of grippe. It is probable,
however, that he will be able to re
sume his position in Saturday's game.
Goodell's Arm Injured.
Goodell's arm gave out in the con
test with Santa Clara yesterday, and
upon consulting a doctor this morn
ing it was found that the muscles
near the shoulder had been torn.
This will keep him out of the game
for at least two weeks and perhaps
for the remainder of the spring.
Goodell suffered a similar injury to
wards the end of the 1907 season.
