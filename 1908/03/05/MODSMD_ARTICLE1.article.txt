# LUTOSLAWSKI SPEAKS
## NOTED SCHOLAR TELLS HOW TO TRAIN THE MIND. He Staffs That Perfect Physical Condition Is Essential to Mental Efficiency. 
### 
Professor Wincenty Lutoslawski,
of the University of K..akow, Aus
tria, lectured this afternoon in the
Chapel on "Training of Mind and
Body." He is an unusually brilliant,
and witty speaker, with an admir
able command of English, and his
talk was thoroughly enjoyed by the
audience, which completely filled the
Chapel.
Professor Lutoslawski first out
lined the ancient systems of train
ing. These are the "Yogi" system,
as practiced by the Hindus, and the
Latin system used by the Christian
Saints. The first of these systems
he characterized as being selfish,
since it provided only for the im
provement of the individual, but did
not enable him to benefit, others.
The Christian system was much bet
ter in this respect, but did not ade
quately provide for training the body.
To these systems Professor Luto
slawski added another, which he
calls the American system. This
embraces "New Thought," Christian
Science, and similar cults. He char
acterized these as "fanatically optim
istic."
The speaker then elaborated his
own, or the '"Polish System." The
foundation of this must be physical
efficiency. The easiest and simplest
exercise is to breathe rhythmically,
but it is of the utmost importance
not to eat or sleep too much. He
says that by his own experience one
fourth or one-fifth of the amount
of food usually taken is sufficient,
and that too much sleep is fatal to
mental efficiency.
After the body has been putin
good condition, the candidate is
ready to begin training his mind and
will. Small things are the best for
training of the will, and Professor
Lutoslawski gives the first place to
total abstinence from liquor or to
bacco. On account of the constant
temptation to which one is exposed,
to indulge in these articles, the will
power gets invaluable training which
could not be secured so well in any
other way.
Next to this, the speaker declared
that, some form of prayer was neces
sary to train the mind on concen
tration. He declared that for stu
dents, one of the most valuable ex
ercises was to study in groups, per
fect silence being observed. The stu
dent who had the greatest power
of concentration would insensibly in
crease that of the others.
In conclusion Professor Lutoslaw
ski dwelt on the happiness which
came from having the mind and
body in perfect control, and proper
ly related to each other. He then
answered a large number of ques
tions put by members of the audi
ence.
