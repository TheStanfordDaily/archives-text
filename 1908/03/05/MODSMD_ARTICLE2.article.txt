# Track Team Leaves for South.
## Prospects Are Good for a Victory Over Coach Holmes' Athletes at Los Angeles On Saturday. 
### 
The fifteen members of the track
squad who will compete against the
University of Southern California in
Los Angeles next Saturday, left the
Campus this afternoon en route for
the southern city, where they will ar
rive tomorrow forenoon. They were
accompanied by Trainer "Dad" Moul
ton, Graduate Manager Knupp, and
W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, representing
the"Daily Palo Alto." The men
should be able to wrest a victory
from the southern athletes, but the
score will no doubt be close, as the
limited number of Stanford entries
will cause the men to enter too many
events and will not allow them to
take, as many second and third places
as their competitors.
The past few days of light train
ing have put the men into fine con
dition and, barring the possibility of
unfavorable weather, they should
put up good performances in every
event. The preliminary meets in
which the U. S. C. athletes have
taken part this season have been
with preparatory schools, where the
best men on the college team have
not been sufficiently hard pressed to
show what they are really capable
of doing, so that it is not impossible
that they may spring some surprises
when they meet Stanford Saturday.
The best performance and closest
contest of the day should be devel
oped in the pole-vault, where there
will be a good fight between Lana
gan, Bellah and Richardson, of U.
S. C., all of whom have done over
11 feet tl inches. Richardson will
also force Martin to do his best in
the high jump, being credited with
5 feet 9 Inches this season. His
performance in the broad is about
on a par with that of Bellah, but the
fact, that Richardson is entered in
so many events may give the Stan
ford entry an advantage. Richard
son seems to have first place in the

hammer at 139 feet, with Youker
second. The shot-put will go to Hor
ton with ease, and Richardson should
take second.
In the sprints the Southerners
have some strong men who will
make the Stanford men do their best
if they breast the tape first. In the
hundred, Reed and Shute, of U. S. C.
have both been caught at 0:10.1,
while Holman and Thompson are
credited with 0:10.2. Shute is the
man who won the relay race for the
Southerners last year, and he will
give Reed a hard race in the 220
i with the odds in his favor.
On form, Miller should win both
! the quarter and half, as the best
time credited to the U. S. C. runners
.is 0:54.3 and 2:11.2, respectively.
In the 440, Brown will give Thomp
son a good fight for second and
should win that place from Curl in
the 880. There is a strong possibil
ity that first and second places in
j both distance events will go to Stan
| ford, though Nordahl, of U. S. C.,
may figure in the mile. However,
both Bradford and Maundrell can
j beat his time of 4:55 by several sec
| onds. Nash and Sweet, in the two
| mile, are both capable of almost a
i minute faster time than Garbutt is
credited with, as his best this sea
son is 11:16.1.
j If the relay is a 220 event, only
previous overwork can prevent Stan
ford from winning, as such a team
as Reed, Holman, Wvman and Brown
can not be equalled by the South
erners.
At the last minute D. P. Crawford,
i '09, was prevented from taking the
! southern trip with the track team
on account of blood poisoning. It
is the result of a slight injury and
Dr. Wilbur says that Crawford would
l be unable to take part in the meet
, so that, it was useless to accompany
the team. His case, however, is not
j considered dangerous.
