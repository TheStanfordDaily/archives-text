# STONE GIVES ADDRESS
## SPEAKS TO SOCIAL SERVICE CLUB LAST NIGHT. Tells of Work of Seamen's Institute on San Francisco Water Front. 
### 
At the meeting of the Social Ser
vice Club held last night, Mr. Frank
Stone, the well-known social work
er, addressed the club on the work
of the Seamen's Institute of San
Francisco. Mr. Stone spoke 011 the
social side rather than the political
side of the question but he mention
ed the fact that in case of an attack
on the United States by some foreign
power, it would be the navy rather
than the army that would defend
the country. He pointed out the
significance of the fact that practic
ally all the seamen on American
ships are Danish or Swedish.
Mr. Stone stated that the major
ity of the population of Great Brit
ain were seafaring people, and that
is the reason the English were taking
the leading part in the organization
of Seamen's Institutes in foreign
ports. Although the United States
has 17 7,000 seafaring men, there
are only five of the eighty-five Sea
men's Institutes in the world, situ
ated in American ports.
The idea of the establishment of
institutes in the principal ports is
to furnish a suitable place for strange
seamen to spend their land leave,
rather than the general haunts of
water fronts. Here billiard tourna
ments, boxing matches and concerts
are furnished for their amusement,
the directors endeavoring to make
the place as attractive as possible.
He mentioned both the humorous
and tragic side of a life at sea, the
latter side, however, greatly out
weighing the former, according to the
speaker.
