# AUDITING COMMITTEE NAMED.
## Freshman President Appoints Three Well-Known 1911 Men To Examine Treasurer's Books. 
### 
President of the Freshman class,
.1 E. Thompson, has appointed the
following committee to audit the
treasury books of last semester: C.
H. Tallant, R. V. St. John, and K.
Chamberlain, chairman.
At present there is a very small
amount of money in the treasury,
due to the fact that a comparatively
few Freshmen paid their fifty-cent
assessment.
A meeting will be called soon for
the purpose of levying another as
sessment to pay for the debating
pins, which have already been made,
and sweaters for the Freshman win
ners in the coming interclass meet.
