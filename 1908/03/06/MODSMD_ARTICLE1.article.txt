# FIXES DAY FOR ROWING
## CALIFORNIA CONSENTS TO RACE ON APRIL 25. Varsity and Freshman Eight-Oared Events Will Be Held On Date Preferred by Cardinal. 
### 
Stanford will row the University
of California in the intercollegiate
regatta, including Varsity and Fresh
man eight-oared races, on Richard
son's Ray, Saturday, April 2.">. This
conclusion was reached at the last
meeting of the California Executive
Committee, and although no official
communication has been received
here, an account of the committee's
action has appeared in the"Daily
('aliforninn."
April 25 has not been specifically
agreed upon by the graduate mana
gers of the two universities, but Stan
ford has stated her preference to row
on April 25 over any other Saturday
in the month, and the consent of the
California Committee makes the date
ot the regatta practically certain.
According to statements coming
from California, notice will be served
on the management here that under
no circumstances will the race be
r.owed after the first Saturday in
April.
Whether such a notice is received
or not, it will probably not affect
the date of the future regattas. If
there is likelihood of any contro
versy in future years over the re
gatta date, it is not improbable that
the question of when the races shall
be rowed will receive the attention
of the intercollegiate agreement com
mittee.
Manager Snedigar, of the Universi
ty of California, is considering the
suggestion of having bleacher seats
built on the cars of the Northwestern
Pacific railroad, which runs paral
lel with the course to be used by
the oarsmen on Richardson's Bay,
The object of having such seats
is to increase the capacity of the ob
servation cars and to allow the pat
rons a better view of the race than
they would get. from ordinary rail
road coaches.
The present understanding which
Stanford has with the Northwest
ern Pacific iÂ« that the receipts from
the observation cars will be divid
ed between the railroad and the uni
versities equally. Each university
takes one-fourth of the total receipts.
The executive committee of the
University of California has instruc
ted its manager to close a transac
tion with the railroad for building
the bleachers on cars. The contem
plated transaction involves paying
for the bleachers by the railroad and
tiiking all the receipts this year. Af
ter this season, the receipts from
the observation train would be divid
ed between the railroad and the uni
versities.
However, Manager Knupp, who is
now in Los Angeles with the track
team, has received no notification of
the propositition from the Northwes
tern Pacific. As far as Stanford has
been informed, the relations between

the universities and the railroad in
regard to the observation train this
year are the same as those which pre
vailed last year.
