It is a source of satisfaction to
learn that the discussion in regard
to the date for the intercollegiate re
gatta has been ended. California
announces that her crews will be
able to compete on April 25, the day
on which Stanford originally expect
ed the regatta to be held. Although
California was anxious to have the
date of the regatta set two weeks
earlier, the Blue and Gold repre
sentatives decided at the last meeting
of their executive committee to row
Stanford 011 April 25. In making
this decision the California commit
tee displayed excellent judgment. In
tercollegiate boating is not yet upon
a firm enough basis to survive the
cancellation of the annual regatta,
which seemed likely at one stage of
the controversy. As Stanford could
not row before April 20, the regatta
had to be held either on a week day
or upon April 25. By deciding to
hold the event on Saturday, April
25, the Californians have shown that
they wish to do their share in en
couraging interest in intercollegiate
rowing, and their spirit in this mat
ter is appreciated at Stanford. It is
well that the controversy has ended,
and we may look forward to a suc
cessful intercollegiate regatta this
spring.
