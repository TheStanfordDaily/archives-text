# MEET TOMORROW MORNING.
## Freshmen Will Compete Against Members of the Second Varsity Squad at Ten o'clock. 
### 
The meet between the second var
i sity track team and the Freshman
squad will be run off tomorrow mor
ning at 10 o'clock. This contest
lias been arranged in order to give
the first-year athletes additional ex
perience in actual competition, be
fore their first meet with an out
side team which occurs on March
12, when the Freshmen meet the
Olympic Junior team. With the pick
of the varsity squad absent in the
South, the Freshmen should place
well in several events, though it is
I not probable that they will be able
to win, as the team is weakened by
the loss of Brown and Wyman, who
are two of the strongest men.
Captain Lanagan is desirous that
all the men in training shall enter
this meet as it will furnish the best
possible basis for an estimation of
the ability of the new material, and
the results will aid him in the selec
tion of the available men for the
Freshman team against California.
The officials for the meet will be
the same as acted at last Saturday's
competition, with the exception that
W. W. Behlow, '07, will act as
starter in place of A. E. Roth, '09.
