# WILL PLAY CALIFORNIA
## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS TO PLAY TOMORROW. Stanford Has a Good Chance in First Intercollegiate Match at Berkeley. 
### 
The first of the series of three
basketball games with the Univer
sity of California will be played to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock at
Berkeley. The Stanford team will
leave here on the 7:47 train and it
is expected that they will be ac
companied by a larger number of
women students than has been the
case previously.
It is impossible to obtain a com
parative judgment of the two teams,
as they have not played the same
schools in the secondary games. The
Stanford team, however, has met de
feat only once, in the first game of
the season.
Practicing has been continued four
times a week, regularly, and the
team is in unusually good condition.
A new feature this year will be the
use of signals, which have been
found very satisfactory in the pre
liminary games.
The Stanford team is strong in
the team work, rather than in hav
ing players of marked individual ab
ility. The work of the centers
throughout the season has been good
and the forwards have developed
into unusually sure goal throwers.
The work of four guards has been
of such equal merit that the coaches
have been unable to discriminate
between them, and they will all play
in the game tomorrow, a change in
the line-up being made in the sec
ond half.
Five of the members of the team
this year played on the last year's
team and the captain, Miss Helen
Ward, 'OS, is a player of several
years' experience.
The line-up of the Stanford team
tomorrow will be as follows: for
wards—Miss H. Ward. '08, captain.
Miss R. Sampson, '11, .Miss B. Haig
'11: centers—Miss S. Bundv, '10,
Miss L. Mirrilees, '09, Miss Ft. Blod
