Unless unfavorable weather inter
feres, the Varsity nine will cross bats
with the crack St. Mary's College
team on the Campus diamond to
morrow afternoon. This game, the
third to be played with the Col
legians this season, will be called
promptly at. 2: :iO. The first contest
resulted in a victory for the Car
dinal and the second game went to
St. Mary's, owing to the inability of
the Varsity to /Cooineet effectively
with Krause's delivery.
The Stanford team will present a
somewhat changed line-up in the
game tomorrow, owing to the illness
of second baseman and the un
avoidable absence or Bell from the
Campus. Scott, is still suffering from
a severe case of grippe. Ball will
be seen in Bell's position on first
base, and Owen has been shifted to
second in Scott's absence. The battery
will be composed of Theile and Mit
chell.
The St. Mary's line-up is made up
ol' the same players who have ap
peared here in the two former con
tests. Krause, the veteran St. Mary's
twirler, will as usual occupy the box
for the visitors.
