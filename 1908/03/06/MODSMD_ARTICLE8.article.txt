# Terrace Club To Raise Money.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Terrace Club
at the Marchmont House last night,
the available fund of $30, with
which to build a tennis court, was
found to lie insufficient, and schemes
for raising more money were discuss
ed. It was finally decided to give n
dance, to be held in Mayfield direct
ly after Lent. A dance committee
was appointed by President Weaver,
consisting of F. R. Purvis, '11, C.
M. lie Count, '11, C. A. Waring, '1 1,
and.1. R. Tuttle, '09, chairman.
The tennis court is to cost about
$100 and is to be built in Cypress
Park, the use of which was donated
by the Mayfield Town Board.
