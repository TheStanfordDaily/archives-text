# ST. MARY'S WINS GAME
## VARSITY COMES OUT ON SHORT END OF SCORE. Theile Pitches Well, But Game Is Marred By Weakness at Critical Moments. 
### 
St. Mary's Phoenix nine defeated
the Varsity by a score of 2 to 1 this
afternoon. Garibaldi, Feeney and
Burns led off at the bat in fast style
for the visitors, each of the first
three men up getting a hit. A clean
three-bagger by Garibaldi, between
center and right, followed by Feen
ey's grounder between third base and
short, scored the first tally for St.
Mary's. Burns singled to left field.
Wallace and Duggan made outs for
the visitors. Theile ended the inning
by stopping a ball bounced from De
terding's bat and tagging Feeney as
he was about to cross the plate. In
this inning, Mitchell walked, Fenton
singled and Mitchell was prevented
from scoring by a close decision af
ter a pretty slide to the plate.
Hallman went to first base on call
ed balls. Dunn struck out, Mitchell
dropping the third strike. Although
Dunn was out because there was a
man on first, Mitchell picked up the
ball and made an overthrow to first
which rolled far into right field. Hall
man came home on the error.
Stanford's tally came in the sixth
inning. Mitchell placed a three-base
hit between the right and center
fielders and scored on Sampson's sin
gle to right field. The Varsity was
near to scoring in the fourth inning.
Scofield went to second on an over
throw to first base and Tallant beat
out a hit. With two outs he at
tempted a double steal, but Scofield
at third, failed to draw the throw
from the St. Mary's first baseman,
and Tallant was tagged between first,
and second. A feature of the third
inning was a hard left-handed stop
by Sampson, which Ball converted
to a put-out at the first bag.
Theile pitched an excellent game,
striking out eight men and allowing
one base 011 balls. The batteries
were: St. Mary's—Hart and Burns;
Stanford —Theile and Mitchell. Hart
struck out three and walked six
men. Three-baggers were made by
Garibaldi and Mitchell, and Duggan
made a two-bagger. Stanford had
six left on bases and St. Mary's
five. Krause, the regular St. Mary's
twirler, played in left field after the
fifth inning. Ganong batted for Mc-
Gregor in the ninth. "King" Brady
of St. Mary's umpired satisfactorily.
