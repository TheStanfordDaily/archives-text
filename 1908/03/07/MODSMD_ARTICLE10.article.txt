# Lutoslawski Tells of Poland.
## 
### 
Professor Lutoslawski spoke in the
Chapel last night on "Poland." He
stated that the history of that coun
try as given in ordinary text-books
was largely falsified by the influence
of the Prussians, who wished to jus
tify their tyrannical actions. He then
gave a brief review of the history
of Poland, described the partitions,
and discussed the present condition
of the country. He afterwards an
swered questions put by the audience
"in the usual Polish manner," as he
said.
