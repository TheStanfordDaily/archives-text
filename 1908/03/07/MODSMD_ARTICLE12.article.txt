# STANFORD CLUB PLANS
## HAS TAKEN NEW QUARTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO. Room at Kearney and Post Will Be Fitted Up For Occupation This Month. 
### 
The "jinks" held by the Stanford
Club of San Francisco last night is
the last to be held before the club
moves into its new quarters. After
the last meeting it was decided not
to take the quarters on Bush street,
for which negotiations had been al
most closed. More thorough investi
gation showed that the rooms were
not arranged properly to accommo
date a large crowd, and so were not
suitable for "jinks."
After a careful investigation of the
entire downtown district, the quar
ters at the northeast corner of Kear
ny and Post streets were unanimous
ly decided upon by the board of di
rectors. They comprise the entire
third floor of the building and will
be ready for occupancy about March
15, when a "house-warming" will
be held.
There is but one large room in
cluded, which is well lighted, with a
high ceiling. The walls will be tint
ed a cardinal, and covered with the
numerous pictures that have been
donated to the club, and the valu
able collection of college pennants
given by Spaulding & Co. A commit
tee consisting of James Lanagan, '00,
O. A. Wilson, '04, and Morris Op
penheim, '05, Has been appointed to
look after furnishing the room, and
secure a billiard table and piano.
The quarters have been leased for
a year at a rental of $100 per month.
An option of renewal during the four
succeeding years has also been se
cured.
Besides laying plans for the
"house-warming," the committee is
arranging to hold a big meeting the
night before the intercollegiate field
day. The membership of the club has
practically reached the two hundred
mark.
