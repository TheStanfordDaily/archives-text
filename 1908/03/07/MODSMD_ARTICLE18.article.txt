passage of a resolution providing for
the charging of tuition fees in the
Law department. The resolution
does not apply to students who are
now registered in the University, but
will go into effect next August and
will apply to all students entering
Stanford hereafter. Tuition will be
as follows: twenty-five dollars per se
mester for a full Law course con
sisting of thirteen or more units of
work in the Law department, and
two dollars per unit of credit for less
than that. This action has been con
templated by the Trustees for some
time, a bill having been passed by
the Legislature last March giving the
Board the authority to charge tui
