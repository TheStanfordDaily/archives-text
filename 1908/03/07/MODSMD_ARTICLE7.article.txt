The fact that there should be stu
dents who will take hour books
from the library at a time when a
large class is in need of t.hem in pre
paration for an examination, is most
surprising. However, it appears
from the action of some students in
the library this morning that there
are certain members of the Student
Body who have little regard for the
lights of others. When a student
signs for an hour book there is ab
solutely no excuse for taking the vol
ume for a longer time, and this is
particularly true when it is known
that there is a large class that needs
the books in preparation for an ex
amination. Anyone who thus takes
advantage of the privileges of the li
brary is deserving of strong condem
nation, and we hope that there will
never be another exhibition of self
ishness such as was called to our
attention this morning.
