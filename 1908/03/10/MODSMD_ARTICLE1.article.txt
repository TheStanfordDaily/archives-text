# FOUNDERS' DAY SPEECH
## ASSEMBLY IN HONOR OF UNIVERSITY'S BENEFACTORS. Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones Delivers Address, and Dr. Jordan Heads Interesting Letter. 
### 
Founders' Day was celebrated
this morning by special exercises in
Assembly Hall. Following a brief
address by Dr. Jordan, in which he
lead an interesting letter written by
Senator Stanford, Rev. Jenkin Lloyd
Jones, of Chicago, gave a lecture
upon poetry. "The Power of Poet
ry-' was his subject, and he went
into detail to explain the hold of the
muse upon the destinies of a nation.
He cited incidents from the classics
and showed their bearing upon his
subject.
Dr. Jordan, in Introducing Rev.
Jones, stated he was "one of the
oldest friends of the University and
one of the oldest friends of educa
tion and not a very old man at that."
Dr. Jones in his remarks said, "1
come to Leland Stanford as to a
shrine. It has been a bright point
in American life and has a great
promise for a future. Today 1 shall
try to speak of the power of poetry.
"Poetry is power."
He then told of the power of poet
ry as it was illustrated in the events
of ancient Grecian history. He add
ed to his first statement as to the â– 
power of poetry: "Poetry has an eco
nomic worth. Poetry is a tangible !
asset. Poetry is an indispensable I
and invaluable item of stock in trade i
without which all other cultures avail (
but little."
"Poetry is the guardian of jus
tice," said Jones, "it is the essence
of youth. There will come a day
when a doctor, a. philosopher, a
statesman and poet shall represent I
us in Congress all in the same pair j
of shoes. The real leaders are po
ets. Today he may not stand out.
distinctly, but time will prove the
truth of this assertion."
In referring to Senator Stanford, !
the speaker said: "Senator Stanford,
whose birthday we are celebrating
today, was a great railroad owner,
which was a distinciton in his time,
l)iit which would not. mean much to
us now with the ever lengthening line
of successful railroad magnates. Le- j
land Stanford was different from the
average railroad men of his time.
He was a broad minded man and
because of his great, benefactions,
of which this University stands as an
example, he will be remembered
when others will be forgotten."
The University orchestra was pres
ent at the Assembly and rendered j
a number at the opening of the ga
thering, and accompanied in the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
