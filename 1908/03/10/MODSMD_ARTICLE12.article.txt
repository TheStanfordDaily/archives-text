After much delay the cinders have
finally arrived and the track may
now be placed in first-class condi
tion. This announcement should in
deed be pleasant news to the track
men, as well as to every member of
the Student Body who is interested
in the welfare of athletics. It is a
severe handicap to have to train on
a track that is not in the best of
condition and now that we have a
new track it. is only right that it
should be kept in fine shape.
