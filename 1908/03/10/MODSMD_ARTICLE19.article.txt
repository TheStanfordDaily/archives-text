# JOURNALISM AND POLITICS.
## Brisbane Says College Men Can Not Do Better Than To Enter Them. 
### 
Arthur Brisbane, editor of the
New York evening Journal, lias writ
ten nil article on "Journalism and
Politics," for the Intercollegiate Civ
ic League, which has secured its pub
lication in the leading college dail
ies of the country. The article is, in
part, as follows:
"Journalism is in its babyhood. It
needs new men, new energy, enthus
iasm and earnest conviction above
all. I saw in one group of young
Columbia law students three or four
men at least, who would make use
ful newspaper workers. I believe
that in devoting their lives to the
fights of the people through journal
ism, these young men students could
find greater happiness than in sell
ing their energies to corporation
fights in the court-room.
"Already it is possible for one
newspaper writer in this country to
talk to ten millions of Americans
in a day. If the young graduate
were taken back to old Athens, he
would not miss a chance to have his
say in the public square. The edi
torial column of a great newspaper
is the public square of today. The
man who talks in that column has
the opportunity of the orator who
addressed the ancient Athenian
crowd.
"Politics offers innumerable op
portunities for American ability of
all kinds. Our government has be
come an industrial organization
largely—a system of industrial feu
dalism better organized already than
the old military feudalism. Concen
tration of industrial wealth and pow
er means added governmental re
sponsibility for the protection of cit
izens dealing with monopolies. The
government will need hereafter es
pecially callable business minds in
politics, as well as mental leaders
and political thinkers of the old kind.
"Newspaper work brings a man in
contact with politics and politicians.
It. makes it easy for him to engage
actually in politics if he wishes. It
should convince him that the effort
to influence politics for the benefit
of people outside of office is more
satisfactory than any work that can
be done in office. Newspaper work
of today is largely anonymous, and
that fact is discouraging to those
who would delight in the sound of
their own names. But let. a man se
lect for his guiding thought the half
cynical toast of old Teufelsdroch:
'Die Sache der Armen in (Jottos und
Teufels Namen.' "
