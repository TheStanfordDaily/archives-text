# CIRCUS IS COMING HERE.
## Norris and Rowe to Give Two Performances. â€”Student Body To Receive Percentage. 
### 
The Norris and Rowe circus will
appear in Palo Alto on the afternoon
and evening of Saturday, March 21,
and as the result of an agreement
entered into between the Associated
Students and the manager of the
circus, ten per cent of all the gross
receipts derived from the two per
formances will be donated to the
Stanford Student Body. This in
cludes the receipts of the side shows
as well as the money taken in at
the main teut. The agreement stip
ulates that the Stanford Students
shall lend their support in making
the appearance of the circus a suc
cessful one, by giving to it a semi
collegiate aspect.
It is planned to have a number of
prominent students take part in the
Circus, as "spielers" for shows and
in other positions. There will also
be a big parade in which it is ex
pected that some of the features will
be supplied by the undergraduates.
Manager Knupp will make announce
ments later in regard to the exact
plans of the students' participation
in the circus.
