# CINDERS HAVE ARRIVED.
## Manager Knupp Now Has Men at Work Improving Condition of the Track. 
### 
Graduate Manager Knupp has fin- j
ally succeeded in obtaining the neees-1
sary cinders for Ihe new track, and |
teamsters have been occupied during j
the past two days in hauling them
to the oval. The cinders were pur- '
:
chased from the Pacific Mail Steam- [
ship Company, at an expense of about j
seventy dollars, including transporta-,
tion charges.
In covering the track with the
cinders only one side at a time will
be coated, in order that, the regular
training may not lie interrupted, and
although the work lias already begun,
it is unlikely that the cinders will be
in place in time for the Freshman
meet with the Olympic Juniors on
Thursday. Before applying the cin
ders, the track must be harrowed
and thoroughly rolled.
