# TWO MEETS THIS WEEK
## FIRST CONTEST FOR FRESHMEN NEXT THURSDAY. Victory In South Was Easy.â€”Record -Holding Relay Team May Meet Olympic Runners. 
### 
There will be two meets on the
track this week, the Freshmen meet
ing the Olympic Junior team Thurs
day afternoon at 4:00 o'clock, and
varsity athletes competing with the
Olympic Club team on Saturday.
It' it is possible for Glarner to
be present at. Saturday's meet it is
planned to run a half-mile relay race
between the previous holders of the
coast record and the Stanford team
which established the new record of
1: 4. 2 in Los Angeles last Saturday.
Should this event be arranged it will
probably be made the feature of the
meet and will be run off first, with
Snedigar, Gerhardt, Cheek, and Glar
ner opposed to Wyman, Holman, Mil- i
ler and Reed.
The showing made by the varsity |
squad in the South has been grati- j
fying to Captain Lanagan, though l
the absence of any severe competi- i
tion did not force the men to their j
best efforts. This fact is largely re
sponsible for the slow time made in
the meet with the Southerners, the j
men having practically everything j
their own way.. In several events |
the Cardinal runners were so far 1
ahead that they deliberately slowed i
up and trotted over the line hand
in hand. Moreover, the track at Bo- i
vard Field was in very poor condi-1
tion and the sharp turns were diffi
cult to take at full speed. When
the athletes from U. S. C. meet the
Stanford men on the Campus on
March 21, it should be practically a
walk away for Stanford. Unless the
Southerners show improvement it ap- :
pears that t.liey can be defeated even
more decisively.
Wyman showed up well in the
South and will prove one of the 1
strongest Freshmen in the quarter.
He also ran a good lap in the relay,
winning by several yards. The in
jury to Hortoil's loot has not proved
nearly so serious as was at first
supposed, and lie will probably be
back ou the track within a day or
two.
