# FIRST FRESHMAN MEET
## WILL COMPUTE WITH OLYMPIC JUNIORS TOMORROW. Visiting Team Is Strong in Field and Distances.—Quarter Will Be Fast Race. 
### 
The Freshman track team will
have the first opportunity to com
pete with outside athletes when they
meet the Olympic Junior team at
4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, on the
Stanford track. The visiting team,
consisting of fifteen of the younger
athletes of San Francisco, will leave
the city on the 11 o'clock train to
morrow morning, under the manage
ment of .J. R. Hickev, ex-'OB.
The Freshmen will have the ad
vantage of a larger entry list, but
the Olympic team has a number of
stars who have good records which
are superior to anything the Fresh
men have done. The visitors have
a strong two-miler in Macpherson,
of Mission High, who is good for
10:24, and should take the race
from St. John and Bevier. Tom
Smith, formerly of Lowell, will run
the mile. He has a record of 2:04
in the half and should put up a
strong race against either Porter or
Thompson, whom Trainer Moulton
will probably enter in this event.
George Maundrell, a brother of H.
H. Maundrell, '10, will run this race
and should figure at the finish, if
in condition, as he has a record of
4:53.
Meyer, the quarter-miler from Lo
well, will be entered against Wyman
and Brown, and with a record of
53 seconds should make a hard
fight, though the Freshman entries
should both win from him. The
Olympics have another :53 man in
Rathbone, but he is not considered
in condition at present. In the half
mile the visitors will enter Meyer
and Padilla. The latter has a record
of 2:04.3, but owing to a recent ill
ness is not in condition to do his
best.
Read should win the hundred for
the visitors, as he is consistent at
0:10.2, while Wyman will probably
take first in the 220 for the Fresh
men. Boyd and Raines for the
Freshmen will be opposed by Baum
haugh, Bressi and Bonner in the
hurdles and should win both events,
though Bressi is a good man over
the low hurdles.
The Olympics are strong in the
jumps, and the Freshmen are cor
respondingly weak. Bofnner, win
ner of the broad jump in St. Louis,
in 1904, and Baumbaugh are both
good for 21 feet and will crowd
Med dick for the first, two places.
Bressi and Baumbaugh have done
5 feet, 7 inches and 5 feet 5 inches
respectively, in the high, which is
as good as Waring has yet done.
The visiting relay team will in
clude Smith, Meyer, Padilla, Baum
baugh and Bromley. The Freshmen
will probably uso Wyman, Brown,
Thompson, Wheeler and Dufiin.
