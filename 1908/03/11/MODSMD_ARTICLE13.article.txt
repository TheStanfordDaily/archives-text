# DIRECT OPERA REHEARSAL.
## Harry James and Miss Violet Arthur Direct the First Act of "Butterfly Isle." 
### 
Harry James, who will direct "But
terfly Isle," which will be produced
in Assembly Hall on the evening of
March 2(i, by the Class of 1909,
went through the first act of the
opera on Monday with the princi
pals and chorus. Four hours of
steady work were put on this act,
and the results of James' efforts
will allow the rehearsing to go on
with hardly anything more to be
supplied for the production of Act
I
Miss Violet Arthur, of the Prin
cess theater, was present at the re
hearsal and did a great deal to
ward training the chorus, which she
will have charge of until the opera
is produced. James' visits will be
made every few days in order to
supervise the progress made by the
cast. Both Miss Arthur and Harry
James expressed themselves enthus
iastically over the great possibili
ties for producing a successful op
era.
