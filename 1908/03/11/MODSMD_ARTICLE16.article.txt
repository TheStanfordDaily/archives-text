Dr. Snow has conferred with many
of the students who live in San Jose,
and has advised them in regard to
their situation. So far no official
action has been taken in regard to
students who live on the University
Campus. Dr. W. P. Snow, chairman
of the Public Health Committee of
the University, makes the following
announcement in regard to \the
smallpox outbreak:
"Editor 'Daily Palo Alto':
"In reply to your request for a
statement concerning the danger of
a smallpox outbreak here, I would
say that up to the present time no
smallpox cases have developed on
the Campus or in Palo Alto. The
homes of students living in San Jose
and other towns in the valley have
been under the observation of the
local health officers. There aro 88
student commuters, but it has not

been necessary thus far to interfere
with their living at home.
"Vaccination is the effective meth
od of control of smallpox, but it
will not produce immunity unless
it 'takes' and is subsequently re
peated at, frequent intervals. Any
person who has not been revaccin
ated within five years is probably
susceptible to the infection of small
pox.
"If the disease appears in the
University community it will be ne
cessary to adopt additional measures
providing for general revaccination
of all members of the community
and the isolation of all persons who
have been exposed.
"Very truly yours,
"W. F. SNOW,
"Chairman of Committee."
