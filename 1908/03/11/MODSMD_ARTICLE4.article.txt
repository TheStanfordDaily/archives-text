# EVENTS TO BE ON LAKE
## INTERCLASS TOURNAMENT IS SET FOR JUNIOR DAY. Lagunita Will Be Scene of Regatta, Swimming Races and Other Contests on Water. 
### 
An interclass water tournament is
the novel program arranged by the
Junior Day committee and announ
ced by Chairman A. E. Roth.
Never before has there been such
an interclass affair on Lagunita, and
the numerous events will call forth
a large number of participants and
spectators on the morning of March
27. The program will commence at
10 o'clock.
Six events will be included in the
festivities on the lake. The most
important of these is the interclass
regatta. The class four-oared crew
which makes the fastest time over
a course marked out on the lake
by buoys will be awarded their nu
merals for winning the interclass
championship in rowing. There will
be no delay in rowing this event,
as a crew will be ready to step into
the shell and row around for time
as soon as one crew has made the
three-quarter mile circuit of the lake.
The object of the competitors in
the tournament will be to make as
many points for their respective
classes as possible. Places in all the
events except the regatta will count
as many points as in a track meet â€”
first place, five points; second place,
three points; and third place,
one point. It has not yet been de
cided whether points will be count
ed for the class winning the regat
ta.
An interclass pursuit race will be
a feature of the day. The four
oared barge will be given a handicap
over the four-oared shell to equal
ize whatever advantages there might
be in rowing in the shell. Two
crews will take the boats around the
lake. The two under classes will
compete against each other, as will
the two upper classes. The two win
ning crews will race in the final,
which will count points.
The four canoes now on the lake
will be used in an interclass canoe
race. The best canoeist in each class
will compete, and points for place
will be counted as in the other ev
ents. An interclass swimming race
will be held over the distance of fif
ty yards. The fifth event will be an
interclass tilting contest. Another
swimming race will be a relay event
among the classes. Four men will
compete for each class over a course
immediately in front of the specta
tors.
An intercollegiate track and field
meet against Pomona will be held
on the Stanford track in the after
noon of Junior Day. In this meet
the Freshmen will not participate,
as the regular intercollegiate con
test for the first-year athletes against
the University of California will oc
cur the .following day on the Ber
keley oval.
