The Freshman track athletes will
be given their first real test tomor
row afternoon when they meet the
Junior team from the Olympic Club
of San Francisco. Among the vis
iting athletes there are some of the
best performers in the metropolitan
high schools, and it will be neces
sary for the Freshmen to do their
best work in order to defeat the
Olympians. With such good pros
pects for a close and exciting meet
there should surely be a large crowd
on hand at the first Freshman con
test tomorrow afternoon.
It is now less than three weeks
before the intercollegiate Freshman
meet, and the Student Body should
show the Freshmen that their efforts
on the track are appreciated. As
California has an unusually strong
Freshman team this year it is of the
highest importance that our men
should receive proper support. We
do not wish to lose the meet this
year because of our failure to show
the Freshmen that the Student Body
is with them in their efforts to de
velop a winning team, and tomor
row is the first opportunity of show
ing the proper spirit in this regard.
