# HERE ARE THE RULES
## USE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS PROHIBITED ON CAMPUS. Student Affairs Committee Takes Exceedingly Stringent Action In Regard to Drinking. 
### 
The intention of the Committee on
Student Affairs, as evidenced by
the tenor of a communication mailed
today to llie various organizations on
the Campus, is to effectually stamp
out drinking at the University and
to suppress any but the most moder
ate use of intoxicating liquor off the
Campus. The communication, which
is printed below, is worded care
fully, and Professor Clark intimates
that it will be interpreted strictly.
A letter accompanied these instruc
tions, the last, sentence stating that
"the further discussion of this mat
ter in the newspapers is undesirable."
The following is the statement is
sued by the Student Affairs Commit
tee:
"The Committee on Student Af
fairs respectfully calls the attention
of the students to the following reso
lutions, which were adopted on Feb
ruary 14, 1908, without dissenting
vote, by the Academic Council of
the University:
" 'The Academic Council of the
University is in thorough sympathy
with the policy of eliminating the
drinking of intoxicating liquors from
Encina Hall, fraternity houses, and
other student lodgings, and of the
removal of students guilty of drunk
enness from the institution.
" 'The Council hereby urges and
instructs the University Committee
on Student. Affairs to use all prac
ticable means to this end, and pledges
its support to the President and Com
mittee on Student Affairs in their
efforts toward freeing the University
from the burden and disgrace of stu
dent, drunkenness.'
"This Committee, in considering
the interpretation it should place up
on these resolutions, believes that
all drinking of intoxicating liquors
in Encina Hall, the fraternity houses,
or other student lodgings is obviously
inconsistent with the spirit of these
resolutions and should therefore be
discountenanced by all loyal mem
bers of the University community.
"The known occurrence of a so
called 'beer-bust' or other drinking
party, which results in disorder or
drunkenness in any degree, upon
premises under tlit* control of any
student club, fraternity, organization
or group, will be treated as an of
fence for which the members of such
club, fraternity, organization or
group shall be held responsible. Fur
thermore, any student who is known
to have been noticeably under the
influence of intoxicating liquor in any
place, or to have participated in a
so-called 'beer-bust.' or other drink
ing party, from which resulted dis
order or drunkenness in any degree,
shall be considered a subject for
discipline at the hands of the Com
mittee. The Committee would have
it clearly understood that all stu
dents violating the spirit of the res
olutions of the Academic Council do
so at their peril, and that whenever
disorder or drunkenness In fact re
sults from such violation, an inten

ti'on to avoid such disorder or drunk
enness will be regarded as no ex
cuse.
"The Committee hopes that, the
voluntary co-operation of the stu
dents will make further restrictive
measures unnecessary.
(Signed)                    "A. B. CLARK.
