# Student Refuses Phi Beta Kappa Key
## 
### 
L. K. Underhill, a senior at Cali
fornia, has refused membership in
Phi Beta Kappa, to which he was
elected recently. He stated that he
did not think the honor was fairly
won by a student in general culture
courses, since so many of them were
"snaps" compared with the courses
taken by engineers and others.
