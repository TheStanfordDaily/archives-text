# Freshman Team Wins Meet Easily
## Wyman and Brown Defeat Meyer in Fast Time in the Quarter—Final Score 86 1-3 to 26 2-3 
### 
The Olympic Junior team failed
to live up io expectations today and
was easily defeated by the Fresh
man athletes who were in fine form,
and piled up a score of 86 1-:! to
2G 2-3, surprising even those who
have been watching the rapid im
provement of the past two weeks.
The feature of the meet was de
veloped in the quarter, with Wy
man and Brown matched against
the speedy Meyer, of Lowell High.
The visitor drew the pole and kept
the lead to the second turn, when
he was passed by Wyman, and lat
er by Brown. The two Freshmen
crossed the mark together in 52 tint.
Macpherson, of the Olympics, had
everything his own way in the two
mile, setting a pace which rapidly
gave him a lead of a quarter la]),
which he retained to the finish. St.
John and George Maundrell fought
hard for second during the last mile,
the latter winning out at. the fin
ish after a splendid sprint. This
event was the only first which fell
to the visitors. The sprints were
fairly fast, the Freshmen proving
too fast for the visitors. Macpher
son was the only Olympic entry in
the mile and could not do himself
justice after running a fast two-mile,
so that all the places in this race
went to Stanford, Thompson and Por
ter winning by a narrow margin
from Bevier.
The Stanford entries in the half
loafed after passing Meyer in the
second lap and allowed the Olympics
a second place which should have
been but a third.
The field events were about, even.
Boyd took the high jump in good
form and Meddick captured the
broad jump from Bambaugh. Raines
sprung a surprise in the shot, win
ning at 38 feet, 2 inches. The ham
mer throw was omitted.
The relay was a good race but

! the result was never in doubt, as
iSmitherum gave the Freshmen such
! a lead in the first, lap that there
i was little chance of making it up.

The Olympic Junior team failed
to live up io expectations today and
was easily defeated by the Fresh
man athletes who were in fine form,
and piled up a score of 86 1-:! to
2G 2-3, surprising even those who
have been watching the rapid im
provement of the past two weeks.
The feature of the meet was de
veloped in the quarter, with Wy
man and Brown matched against
the speedy Meyer, of Lowell High.
The visitor drew the pole and kept
the lead to the second turn, when
he was passed by Wyman, and lat
er by Brown. The two Freshmen
crossed the mark together in 52 tint.
Macpherson, of the Olympics, had
everything his own way in the two
mile, setting a pace which rapidly
gave him a lead of a quarter la]),
which he retained to the finish. St.
John and George Maundrell fought
hard for second during the last mile,
the latter winning out at. the fin
ish after a splendid sprint. This
event was the only first which fell
to the visitors. The sprints were
fairly fast, the Freshmen proving
too fast for the visitors. Macpher
son was the only Olympic entry in
the mile and could not do himself
justice after running a fast two-mile,
so that all the places in this race
went to Stanford, Thompson and Por
ter winning by a narrow margin
from Bevier.
The Stanford entries in the half
loafed after passing Meyer in the
second lap and allowed the Olympics
a second place which should have
been but a third.
The field events were about, even.
Boyd took the high jump in good
form and Meddick captured the
broad jump from Bambaugh. Raines
sprung a surprise in the shot, win
ning at 38 feet, 2 inches. The ham
mer throw was omitted.
The relay was a good race but

! the result was never in doubt, as
iSmitherum gave the Freshmen such
! a lead in the first, lap that there
i was little chance of making it up.
