# CHANGE IN LAW COURSES
## JUNIORS WILL NOT TAKE CRIMES AND TORTS. Present Course in Elementary Law To Be Superseded by Two New Courses. 
### 
r lhe Faculty of the Law depart
ment has been engaged for some
time in revising the curriculum in
that department and announces a
new schedule for the coming year
which embodies many important
changes in the course of study. The
most important of these changes is
the concentration of the undergradu
ate Law courses in the Senior year.
That is, hereafter, Junior Law maj
ors will be allowed to take only
Contracts, leaving Torts and Crimes
to be taken in the Senior year in
addition to the courses at present
given in that year. The advantage
accruing from this change is that
Law majors will have practically
completed all the required culture
work by the time they become Sen
iors and can then devote their undi
vided attention to the study of Law.
Under the above regulation the
schedule of courses for the Junior
and Senior years will be as follows:
Junior year—Contracts, 7 hours (:'»
hours first semester and 4 hours
second semester). Culture subjects.
2:> hours. Senior year—first semes
ter, Torts, Crimes, Property I; sec
ond semester, Agency, Equity, Prop
erty I; a total of 2.1 hours, leaving
7 hours of culture studies to be
taken during the year.
Other new regulations are, that
no student will be allowed to regis
ter for more than fifteen hours of
Law work in a semester and that
no one will be permitted to attend
a class in which he is not registered.
It was also decided that all Law
courses will be given in the morn
ing hereafter.
New Courses.
Two new courses will be given
by the department to take the place
of the present course in Elementary
Law, which is to be discontinued.
"The Introduction to the Study of
Law," to be given by Professors Hu
berich and Cathcarr, is designed par
ticularly for Law majors and will
afford a thorough training in the use
of Case Books and reports, and in
the preparation of briefs and cases.
It will be a two-hour course given
the second semester of each year
and will be open .to students in
their Sophomore year.
For all students but Law majors,
a course entitled, "Elements of Bus
iness Law," will be offered by the
Faculty for the benefit of students
of other departments who may wish
to acquaint themselves with the prin
ciples of Business Law. It will be a
two-hour course continuing through
out the year and will be open to all
except Law majors.
Courses for Next Year.
The following are the courses
which the department will offer next
year and the Professors who will
give them:
