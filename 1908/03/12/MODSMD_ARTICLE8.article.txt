As the present Student Affairs
Committee has now issued its first
official statement of policy in regard
to the enforcement of the x-ecent res
olution of the Academic Council, we
would call the attention of the Stu
dent Body to this announcement.
There is no mistaking the fact that
the present committee is determined
to carry out the policy announced
by the Academic Council. In mak
ing this announcement of its policy
the Committee has also shown that
it intends to give the Student Body
a definite warning, and in this re
spect the statement is beneficial. Ev
ery student should now know that
the committee has taken a decided
stand on the question; there will
be no excuse for those who plead
that they did not appreciate the
committee's attitude. This state
ment may be interpreted so as to
appear most general in its scope,
but we do not believe that it is the
intention of the Committee to carry
on an absolute prohibition policy.
This statement will be construed by
the Committee according to the mer
its of the particular cases. In ex
treme circumstances a radical inter
pretation of the policy will be fol
lowed. In general, the statement ap
pears to be a reiteration and ampli
fication of the original resolution of
the Academic Council. But in the
final analysis the whole matter rests
with the Committee, which will act
at its discretion, and it is advisable
for the students to carefully heed its
latest proclamation.
