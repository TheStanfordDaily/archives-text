# WILL MEET OLYMPIANS
## VARSITY WILL COMPETE WITH STARS TOMORROW. Miller Will Not Run on Account of Injured Ankle.—Glarner In Quarter. 
### 
The varsity track team will meet
the Olympic Club athletes tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 on the Stanford
track. The aggregation wearing the
winged O will not be as strong as
the team which met Stanford last
year, but there are several.stars
among the visitors who will force
the Stanford entries to their best ef
forts.
The Varsity will be handicapped
by the absence of Miller, who is
bothered with an injured ankle which
will keep him off the track for a
week. Glarner win no doubt take
the quarter from Wyman and Brown
and will run the 880. Gerhard!,
who won the hundred the last two
years, is running in fine form this
season and should take both sprints.
Garcia, Moody and Richardson will
run the two mile against Nash and
Sweet, Garvin and Kelly running
against Bradford and Maundrell in
the mile. Cheek will be the only
entry for the visitors in the hur
dles, as his team-mate, Powell, is
seriously ill with rheumatic fever.
The Olympians are strong in the
field, except in the pole vault, where
Stanford should take all the points.
Snedigar will enter the shot, hammer
and broad jump. Gilmore, who won
the Pacific Northwest championship
last year at 45 feet will be in the
shot. Cheek and Channing Hall will
enter the high jump.
