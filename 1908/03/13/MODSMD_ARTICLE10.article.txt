Although there may be many ques
tions raised as to the expediency of
such a demonstration as took place
on the Campus last night, there is
also liable to be a serious misun
derstanding as to the spirit really
involved in the affair; this is par
ticularly true in view of the accounts
already published. The details of
the parade are not involved in the
discussion of the sentiment that was
expressed. It was not a demonstra
tion for the purpose of opposing au
thority, any more than it was an
expression of sentiment on the ques
tion of drinking. It shows that there
are a great many students who are
not in sympathy with the method of
the new Student Affairs Committee,
mainly because the announcement
which was issued yesterday by the
Committee is not thoroughly under
stood. This appears to be the im
portant phase of the situation. Such
a demonstration as that of last night
is an injudicious way to express sen
timent, but it shows that there is a
serious misundei'staflding that should
be straightened out, in a- different
way. As this sentiment has been
expressed by a large number of the |
most prominent students, a serious
effort should be made to adjust the
misunderstanding, and place the stu
dents in a position where they can
clearly understand the intention of
the Committee and will be in a po
sition to co-operate in its policy.
