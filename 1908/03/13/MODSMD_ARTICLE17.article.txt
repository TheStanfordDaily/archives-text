College Terrace was the scene of
two daring robberies last night, when
an unknown burglar entered the
Snell and Welakahao Clubs about
3:30 a. in.and secured $46 in cash,
I while the students were asleep.
The two heaviest losers are P. A.
Ross, 'OS, of the Snell Club, who
was robbed of $25, and a Freshman
j of the Welakahao Club, who lost
$18. B. R. Weaver, '09, and E. L.
McKeon, '11, both of the Welakahao
Club, report small losses. Ross was
unaware of the robbery until he
found his clothes scattered in the
hall this morning.
H. E. Schmidt, '11, of the Wela
kahao Club, was awakened by the
marauder and frightened him from
the house. When he first saw the
burglar standing in his doorway he
took him for a fellow clubman. When
spoken to the robber quickly took
to his heels, and before Smith was
out of bed, he had made his way
down stairs and was running in the
direction of Mayfield. Schmidt is the
only one who saw the robber but can
give no accurate description of him.
