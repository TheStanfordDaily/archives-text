# WILL GET COLLEGE NEWS
## TO SEND THE DAILY PALO ALTO TO HIGH SCHOOLS. Executive Committee Authorizes Distribution of 100 Copies.â€”Grants Fobs To Musical Clubs. 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Associated Students at. the regular
meeting last night decided upon sev
eral items of interest to the under
graduates. Probably the most im
portant step taken was to order the
"Daily Palo Alto" sent to 100 of the
principal high schools of the state.
The papers will be sent daily for
the next two months. It is believed
in this manner the preparatory
school students will get a true ver
sion of all college affairs and will
become in touch with college life
here.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs, as
represented by R. A. Gott, '09, last
night, will be allowed to wear dis
tinctive watch fobs. These fobs,
which are in the form of a heavy
seal, will be purchased by the mem
bers of the clubs, but only those who
make the annual trips will be al
lowed the privilege of wearing these
fobs.
A. E. Roth, '09, was appointed by
the Executive Committee to act as a
committee of one in order to ascer
tain the exact whereabouts of the
music formerly owned by the Girls'
Glee Club with the idea of turning
this over to the Schubert Club upon
some basis to be agreed upon later.
Roth is to discover whether the
Girls' Glee Club now has possession
of this music or whether the club
has disbanded.
A committee of three was author
ized last night to draw up any pro
posed amendments to the constitu
tion of the Associated Students.
As the present lot. of cinders ob
tained by Manager Knupp is not
considered sufficient in quantity or
quality to cover the new track, Knupp
was authorized to make negotiations
to obtain another carload from Cis
co, where it is understood a quan
tity can be obtained.
