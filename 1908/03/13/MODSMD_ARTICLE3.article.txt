# MUST WORK HARD TO WIN
## OARSMEN APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE HANDICAPPED. Candidates for Both Varsity and Freshman Crews Are Putting in Extra Time. 
### 
Training two eiglit-oared crews
with the use of only one eight shell
is a problem of'which Coach Turn
-1 i er and the crew candidates have
found I lie best solution to be, to put
in as much extra time rowing as
| possible. In order to overcome the
1 handicap under which the Cardinal
, oarsmen must train for both the
Varsity and Freshman intercollegiate
i races, a schedule of extra time has
j been arranged.
| The men work whenever they can
Ibe at the training quarters. Every
j man on the squad realizes that an
j exceedingly difficult proposition is
| before the Cardinal crews this spring
j to defeat the University of Califor
i nia. The Freshmen have caught the
j spirit of the older men and make
| good training mates in the boats.
Almost every man on the squad
j lias either two or three hours a
| week free in the morning. This
| time the oarsmen use on Lagunita or
j at the training quarters on the shore
!of the lake. So many men are free
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fri
! days that there are not enough seats
! lor them in the boats on the lake,
| which include the four-oared shell,
the four-oared barge and the pair
oar. Those who are not seated en
ter readily into work with dumb
bells or on the rowing machines, so
that no one is idle.
Every afternoon of the regular
college week a crew goes out in the
J eight from the training quarters at
| Redwood City. On Saturdays two
! crews can row. In order to keep
I all the men who are liable to have
j to pull together working well in the
I eight, almost the same eight men
are worked every day, only one
j member of the crew being changed,
j But every day a new man goes to
! Redwood, until the composition of
the crew is entirely changed. The
rotation of the men who row in the
eight goes on from day to day.
After the interclass water tourna
i inent, on March 27, the four-oared
i shell will lie moved to Redwood City.
As I lie eight is the only boat which
| the oarsmen have for use at Red
wood, neither a Freslunan nor a Var
sity eight can get any competition.
When the four is taken to Redwood,
j the candidates for the crews will get
as much competition as may be ob-
I tained from races between the eight
i and the four. This method of gain
j ing competition must, be pursued
I throughout the season.
