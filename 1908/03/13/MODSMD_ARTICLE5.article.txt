### 
Dr. Rudolph Leonhard, tlie famous
German jurist and author, who is
at present the Emperor Wilhelm Pro
fessor of Law to tlie United States,
gave a very interesting address in
Assembly Hall, at the fourth hour
this morning, on "The Social Tenden
cies of Modern German Legislation."
The speaker told of the bond of
sympathy that exists between Europe
and the United States and ascribed
it to the fact that both continents
have as a common heritage the laws
and civilization of Rome. He said
that Germany and America were
closely united by reason of the simi
lar political development of the two
countries and that this union would
be strengthened in the future on ac
count of the social problems which
are common to the two nations and
which will demand more and more
attention as time passes.
In tracing the political develop
ment. of Germany and the United
States he showed that although the
history of the two countries was very
different, Germany being a mon
archy, and the United States a dem
ocracy, that commercial and social
conditions were rapidly making the
two countries similar in their laws
and methods.
In speaking of the social condi
tions of Germany, he said in that
country the government had to meet,
conditions which have never obtain
ed in the United States, in that there
is a dependent class of laborers
which lias to be provided for. This
problem has been successfully met
by a system of government pensions
to laborers and their families.
In concluding, Dr. Leonhard said
that he wished to leave as his mes
sage to the people of the United
States the necessity of meeting the
social, and especially the labor prob
lems, of this country by a system
of pensions similar to that in Ger
many, and by the adoption of a l
single code of laws for the entire
country.
