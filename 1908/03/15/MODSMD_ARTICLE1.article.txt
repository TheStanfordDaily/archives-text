ner, who held the lead to the last,
turn, when .Brown started a sprint
which won thd race by several yards
in 2:01.1. McGregor stuck to the
fast pace in good style and finished
third. Glarner took the only first
for the Olympians by winning the
quarter by a, very narrow margin
from Wyman in:51.3. The Fresh

the finish beat him by an inch. Coon
an took third from Hussey by a
scant foot.
Reed was in fine form in the
sprints and won both with compara
tive ease. Holman and Gerhardt re
versed the places in these races, Hol
man taking second in the hundred

over the sticks in fine form. Gregg
and Morris took the other places in
the 220 hurdles, with Peaslee and
Bradley second and third over the
high sticks.

ents. Sweet, in the two mile, show
ed wonderful strength and finished
far in advance of the field in 10:12.1,
with Adams second and Nash third.

for the Olympians by winning the
quarter by a, very narrow margin

sprints and won both with compara
tive ease. Holman and Gerhardt re
