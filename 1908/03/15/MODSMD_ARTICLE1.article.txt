# OLYMPIC MEET IS FAST
## TWO NEW STANFORD RECORDS ARE ESTABLISHED. Varsity Defeats Club Athletes by Score 104 to 18.â€”World's Record Equalled. 
### 
For the first time in three years
the Varsity track team defeated the
Olympic Club athletes Saturday, win
ning by the score of 104 to 18 in a
meet which was replete with high
class performances and exciting fin
ishes. Although the visitors were
handicapped by a small team which
limited the number of entries to one
or two in each event, they were clear
ly outclassed by the Varsity athletes
who were in the best form shown
this season.
New Stanford records were estab
lished in the 220-yard dash and the
high jump, Reed doing the sprint
in 0:22.2, which is 1-5 of a second
better than the record of W. F. Dunn,
'04, and Mlartin clearing the bar
iit 5 feet, 11 1-4 inches, 1-4 inch
higher than the mark set. by N. E.
Dole, '03, and H. W. Bell, '05. Reed's
record was made on the straight
away, while Dunn established his
mark on a curved track, and the Ex
ecutive Committee wlil probably es
tablish Reed's time as a separate rec
ord without displacing Dunn's pre
vious performance. The relay team
consisting of Coonan, Hussey, Hol
man and Reed, covered the half-mile
i : 1:32.2, breaking the Coast record
of 1:34.1, made by the Stanford team
in Los Angeles, and equalling the
mark for the world. Horton equal
ed the record of J. C. Macfarland in
the low hurdles at : 25.4 and Reed
covered the hundred in record time
at 10:1.
Glarner, the crack quarter-miler,
was not in the best of condition, and
lost the half to Brown after a hard
fight. Lee set the pace for a fast
quarter when he was passed by Glar
ner, who held the lead to the last,
turn, when .Brown started a sprint
which won thd race by several yards
in 2:01.1. McGregor stuck to the
fast pace in good style and finished
third. Glarner took the only first
for the Olympians by winning the
quarter by a, very narrow margin
from Wyman in:51.3. The Fresh
man runner led all the way and ap
parently had the race his own way,
but Glarner's phenomenal sprint at
the finish beat him by an inch. Coon
an took third from Hussey by a
scant foot.
Reed was in fine form in the
sprints and won both with compara
tive ease. Holman and Gerhardt re
versed the places in these races, Hol
man taking second in the hundred
and Gerhardt in the 2 20. The visit
ors had no entries in the hurdles, so
that all the points went to Stanford,
Horton winning both events, getting
over the sticks in fine form. Gregg
and Morris took the other places in
the 220 hurdles, with Peaslee and
Bradley second and third over the
high sticks.
The distances were another clean
sweep for the Stanford entries, who
completely outclassed their oppon
ents. Sweet, in the two mile, show
ed wonderful strength and finished
