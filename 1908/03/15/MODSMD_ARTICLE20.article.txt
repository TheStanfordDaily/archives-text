# CALIFORNIA WINS SERIES.
## Stanford Women Lose Second Basketball Game by the Score of 22 to 11. 
### 
Stanford was defeated by Califor
nia in the second basketball game
of the series Saturday morning by
the score of 22 to 11. As California
also won the first game, it will not
be necessary to play the game which
was scheduled for next week.
The California team outplayed
Stanford from the start, the work of
their jumping center and forwards
being particularly effective. There
were a few spectacular plays by the
Stanford forwards, but the team was
greatly handicapped by size.
The Stanford team lined up as fol
lows: forwards—H. Ward, '08, cap
tain, B. Haig, '11, R. Sampson, '11;
centers—R. Blodgett, '09, P. Abright,
'08, L. Mirrilees, '09; guards—B.
Maine, '09, E. Hayward, '10, S. Hun
ter, '10; referees Miss A. Ege and
Miss J. Derby.
