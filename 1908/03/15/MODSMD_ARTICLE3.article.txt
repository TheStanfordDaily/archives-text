## Manager Knupp Cancels Field Day with St. Mary's for Bay Counties League. 
### 
Instead of the proposed meet Wed
! nesday afternoon between the Fresh
men and the track team of St. Mary's
College, Manager Knupp has changed
the schedule and replaced the Oak
i land collegians by a picked team
I chosen from the stars of the Bay
Counties Academic League. He re
j ceived word from the high school
I athletes yesterday asking for a meet
1 and has decided to re-arrange the
; schedule to the above effect. This
step has been taken at the sugges
tion of Brother Joseph, of St. Mary's
I College, who told Manager Knupp
| that he did not believe St. Mary's
j could put a creditable team in the
I field events. The high school ath
letes of the schools about the Bay
have not as fast a team this year as
visited Stanford last season but it is
expected a number of performers
can be found who will give the first
year men a much better opportunity
to show their caliber than the meet
Inst, week with the Olympic Junior
team.
The meet, will be held on the new
track Wednesday afternoon unless
the visitors are delayed for some
unexpected reason.
