# WINS FROM COLLEGIANS
## SCORE OF 8 TO 3 IN SANTA CLARA-VARSITY GAME. Stanford Connects With Kilburn's Delivery for Ten Hits in Otherwise Dull Match. 
### 
By a score of 8 to 3 the Varsity
defeated Santa Clara on the hitter's
diamond Saturday morning. The
game was rather listless, but was
temporarily enlivened by the spas
modic hitting of the Cardinal. The
Stanford batters connected safely ten
times with the curves of Kiiburn,
who evidently had an off day. Wit
mer was putin the box for the Var
sity, but while at bat in the second
inning was hit just above the elbow
by a pitched ball and forced to re
tire. Theile replaced him and proved
uniformly effective, save in the third
inning, when Santa Clara scored
three times.
Two hits and a pair of battery er
rors gave Stanford a lead of two
runs in the first inning. Another
was tallied in the third, a fourth in
tlie seventh, and in the ninth foui
men completed the circuit on hits by
Fenton, Mitchell, Bell and Ball.
The Varsity will again journey to
Santa Clara tomorrow to play the
collegians for the fifth time this sea
son.
