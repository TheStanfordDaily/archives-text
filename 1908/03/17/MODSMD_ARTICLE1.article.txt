# ALUMNI PLAN REUNION
## COMMITTEE STATUS POLICY FOR GATHERING IN MAY. Every Class Now Has Permanent Secretary and Schedule of Reunions Is Arranged. 
### 
"To the President of the Stanford
Alumni Association:
"Your committee appointed to con
sider the adoption of the Alumni Re
union Scheme now used by the class
es of 1906, 1907, and 190S, hereby
makes the following recommenda
tions:
"I. The committee having been
clothed with the power to act has de
rided to adopt the Duennial Reunion
plan, i. e., classes reunite for their
first or duennial reunion two years
after graduation, for their second or
quintennial reunion three years later
or five years after graduation, and
thereafter every five years.
"11. We also recommend that the
classes as far as possible try to hold
their reunions as thej* would have
done if the duennial reunion scheme
had been adopted in 1592, when the
first class graduated from Stanford
University. That would bring the fol
lowing classes back for their reun
ions this coming May: Class of '93,
quindecennial reunion; Class of '98,
decennial reunion; Class of '03, quin
tennial reunion; Class of '06, duen
nial reunion.
"111. We also recommend that the
following be appointed as permanent
secretaries for the various classes who
have not already appointed said sec
retaries: '9 2, Thomas Crothers, San
Francisco; '93, Frank M. McFarlane,
Stanford University; '94, Aylett R.
Cotton, Jr., San Francisco; '95, Ar
chie Rice, care of San Francisco
Chronicle, San Francisco; '96,
Charles F. Wright, Stanford Univer
sity; '97, Dr. Thomas M. Williams,
Palo Alto; '98, Prof. Dorsey Lyon,
Stanford University; '99, John Ezra
McDowell, Stanford University; '00,
James F. Lanagan, Palo Alto; '01,
Frank Adams, care of Adams & Hol
lepeter, San Francisco; '02, Hen F.
Oakford, Humboldt Building, San
Francisco; '03, Hall Ross, Redwood
City; '04, Miss Alice Kimball, Stan
ford University; '05, Morris Oppen
heim, Pacific Building, San Francis
co; '06, Harold Ide Cruzan, Stan
ford University; '07, Clay Crider, San
Jose, Cal.
"IV. We further urge that the
following rules be laid down for the
classification of the students and
graduates who are to be kept track
of by the permanent secretaries: (1 )
The date of graduation determines
the class a graduate belongs to. (2)
September and Christmas graduates
are classed with the graduating
class of the preceding May. (3) The
students who fail to graduate but
who attend Stanford long enough to
be affiliated with Stanford will be
classed with the class with which
they entered. (4) Those who have
received their A. B. degrees from
other colleges and who are taking
advanced work at Stanford Univer
sity, affiliate with the Stanford Sen
ior class with whom they take their
advanced degrees. (5) In case a
graduate prefers to affiliate with the
class with which he entered rather
than with the class with which he
graduated, he may do so by commu
nicating this fact to the permanent
secretaries of both classes.
"V. The committee also recom
mends that the list of permanent sec
retaries and their addresses be pub
lished as a regular part of the Alum
nus, together with the reunions for
the coming year, so that the alumni
can know at once who their respec
tive class secretaries are and when
their classes reunite.
"VI. In accordance with the
scheme as outlined by the Classes of
1906, 1907, 1908, your committee
recommends that the president of
the Alumni Association be empower
ed to fill vacancies in the list, of per
manent secretaries if any occur.
"Your committee being appointed
with power to act, it was decided to
adopt the above recommendations
with the exception of the last which
will call for a constitutional amend
ment. This the committee strongly
recommends to the committee on the
constitution.
"We respectfully submit the above
as our report.
"HALL ROSS, '03,
"W. A. MANNING, '9 9,
"HAROLD IDE CRUZAN, '06,
"Chairman of the Alumni Reunion
Committee."
