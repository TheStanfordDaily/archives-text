The announcement that the Uni
versity Band has begun regular prac
tice indicates that the members of
this organization will soon take an
active part in aiding the rooters at
the track meets and baseball games.
This is news which should be wel
come to the Student Body, as the
dates of the intercollegiate athletic
contests are rapidly approaching and
the assistance rendered by the band
on these occasions is most valuable.
The band has always shown a re
markably good spirit in its work, and
the Student Body appreciates its ef
forts to follow the course of previous
years.
