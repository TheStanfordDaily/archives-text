### 
The tickets for Norris & Rowe's
Circus, which is to be held at Palo
Alto next Saturday afternoon and
evening, were placed on sale at the
Bookstore this morning. An agree
ment has been made between Mana
ger Knupp and those in charge of
the circus, whereby the Student
Body is to receive a certain percent
age of all the money taken in at
the circus. This arrangement has
been entered into with the under
standing that the students would co
operate in every possible way to
ward making the circus an affair or
particular interest to the university
community. This will probably be
accomplished by having q, number
of well-known students participate in
the parade and also act as "spielers"
for the show. The exact plans for
having students take part in the af
fair have not been arranged, but
there will be an effort made to in
terest many prominent members of
the Student Body.

years that a first-class circus has
visited Palo Alto, it is expected that
a large attendance will be secured
and considerable money should come
into the Student Body treasury. It
is printed on the tickets that this
performance is under the auspices of
the Student, Body Athletic Associa
tion, and as there is particular need
of money at this time to aid in the
construction of the new track bleach
ers as well as in other athletic ex
penses, Manager Knupp believes that
the funds secured as his percentage
of the circus receipts will aid ma
terially.
The tickets are 50 cents and $1,
the $1 tickets providing for reserved
seats. The performances on Satur
day will be at 2 o'clock in the after
