# Twelve Students Are Suspended.
## Student Affairs Committee Has Announced Drastic Action In Regard To Parade of Thursday Night. 
### 
j The following announcement has
! been made by the Student Affairs
| Committee in regard to its action
I taken upon the parade held last
j Thursday night. There is no mention
made in the document to the effect
that the twelve men suspended were
regarded as leaders, and apparently
the offence consisted only in parti
cipation in the parade.
"At a meeting of the Student Af
fairs Committee held on March 17,
11)08, twelve students were suspend
ed from the University for the re
mainder ol' the present semester for
participation in the so-called parade
! ol Thursday evening, March 12, 1J)08.
"The Committee finds three offences
j in the conduct of the so-called pa
! rade of Thursday evening:
"1. The action of the men concern
' ed oil the premises of a member of
i the Faculty.
"2. The procession through tile Li
brary.
":J. The proceedings in Memorial
j
Court.

"The Committee finds that the stu
dents in the demonstration generally
seemed disposed to regard it as a
means of protest against the recent
J Committee letter on the drinking
question. The Committee takes no
stand against protest and dissent as
such, expressed in a proper manner,
but as representing the disciplinary
| authority of the University, the Com
mittee feels impelled to state that it
cannot tolerate offences or insulting
I conduct or rowdyism, as a method of
i dissent.
"The Committee realizes that indi
viduals who take part in such a dem
onstration differ greatly in their con
duct and intent iouis, but s&nce it
finds no practicable and certain
means of discriminating between in
dividuals, if imposes an equal penalty
on all participants identified.

"Chairman Committee oil Student
Affairs."
