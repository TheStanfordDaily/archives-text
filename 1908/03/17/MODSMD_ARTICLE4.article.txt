# FAST TRIALS RUN.
## Attempt May Be Made Next Saturday To Lower Half-Mile Relay Record. 
### 
Captain Lanagan is planning to
run a series of trials this week in
order to determine who are the fast
est. relay men. If the weather is fav
orable on Saturday a team will make
another attempt to lower the world's
record for the half-mile relay, as
the time made last Saturday will
probably not be allowed, as the last
lap was paced. The time of 1:32.2
equals that made by the Lewis Insti
tute team at an interscholastic meet
at Northwestern University on May
2, 1903, which is recognized as a
world's interscholastic and world's
amateur record, but of course, does
not stand among the intercollegiate
records. Coonan covered the quar
ter this morning in:52.4 by "Dad's"
watch, and Maundrell was caught at
2:02.3 in the half.
