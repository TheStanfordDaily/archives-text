## Chairman Clark Receives Request That All Participants In Parade Be Treated Alike.

Chairman Clark's Statement.
"The Committee on Student.
Affairs informed a committee
of students this afternoon that
it did not then see
grounds for a reconsider
ation of its action in re
gard to the twelve men who
participated in the deinonstra
tion hist Thursday night. The
statement of the men who ad
mit they were in the parade
was submitted to me this af
ternoon after the Student Af
fairs Committee had adjourn
ed. Thus far I have received
no other document from the
representatives of the students
in the present discussion. The
Committee was in session sev
en hours yesterday, had a meet
ing the day before and lias al
ready held one session today.
If it were possible, 1 would get
the Committee together this af
ternoon so that tli<' students
could he informed this even
ing as to the action of the Com
mittee on the statement of the
men who acknowledge their
participation in the parade. Hut
it is likely that the Committee
will meet tomorrow morning,
and I will endeavor to have
them act by tomorrow noon on
the statement, which has been
submitted to me.
"As far as the justice of the
suspension of the twelve men
is concerned, I will say that
an unavoidable injustice was
done to them not to take equal
action on the others who parti
cipated in the demonstration.
As was said in the statement
made by the Committee yester
day afternoon, all those who
were identified as participants
in the demonstration were sus
pended."

Not. sufficient grounds for reconsid
eration is the reason given by the
Student Affairs Committee for not
again taking up the case of the
twelve men who were suspended yes
terday for participation in the parade
last Thursday night. Chairman Clark
said tliis afternoon that an unavoid
able injustice had been done the
twelve men who were suspended for
their part in the demonstration. The
committee will meet before tomor
row noon in an endeavor to reach an
agreement among themselves as to
what course will be pursued toward
the 24 0 other men who have ac
knowledged that they took part in
the parade.
Conference with Committee.
At. a special meeting of the Stu
dent Body held in the Encina Club
room last evening. President A. A.
Murphy, 'OS, appointed J. R. Stewart,

! 'OS, Guy Knupp, '07, and F. W.
I Turner, '08, a committee to submit
j the statement of the men who partic
ipated in I lie parade to the Student
! Affairs Committee, along with a gen
leral Student Body petition for the
j re-instatement of the twelve suspend
jed students. This committee and
| President Murphy met the Student
I Affairs Committee at 11:30 this
I morning and remained with them for
an hour and three-quarters. The
' representatives of the students di
j rected their efforts toward a recon-
J sideration of the suspension of the
students. After this meeting, the
i Committee on Student Affairs held a
j short session, which resulted in the
! announcement that the efforts of the
j committee of students had been un
! successful.
The statement, signed by 246 men,
j which lias been (submitted to the
Student. Affairs Committee follows:
j "To the Members of the Student
Affairs Committee:
"Gentlemen: We, the undersign
i ed students of the University, took
! part in the demonstration occurring
J on last Thursday night and we be
i lieve that we are equally blamewor
| thy with the members of the Student
: Body already suspended for that of-
I fence. Under these circumstances
I we believe that we should be sub
jected to the same penalty or that
the suspended members should be

reinstated immediately."
Appended to this statement and
construed to be signed by all the
signers of the first statement is the
' following: "We, the undersigned, de
ny that, any personal insults were
'given in the parade on Thursday ev
j ening; but, if there were, we are
I heartily sorry." This statement, was
! drawn up by the twelve men who
i
! believe themselves to be suspended
J from tlie University, and was hand
led to Chairman Clark with the names
j of the signers of the original state
j ment.
XÂ« Suspensions Received.
lip to a late hour this afternoon
I no notices of suspension for partic
ipation in the parade of Thursday
evening had been received by any
members of the Student Body. The
conclusions as to who the men are
who have been suspended are reached
by a process of elimination. The
only statement made by the Commit
tee that the twelve students had
been suspended was the public no
tice given last, evening in the "Daily
Palo Alto." As only fourteen men
were examined bv the Committee,
twelve of whom admitted they were
in the parade, those who admitted
they were in the parade are the ones
supposed to have been dismissed
from the University for the remain
der of the semester.
