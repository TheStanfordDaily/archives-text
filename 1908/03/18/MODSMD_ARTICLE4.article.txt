# VARSITY TO PLAY BALL
## OLYMPIC NINE FACES CARDINAL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Clubmen Have Strengthened Their Team.—Theile Will Pitch for Varsity. 
### 
The second game between the
Olympic Clul» nine and the Varsity
is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon
on the Campus diamond at 3:30.
When the Olympic team came down
here for its first game the Varsity
won easily by a score of 12 to 5, al
though the Olympians out hit the lo
cal men, most of the runs being due
to errors. As the clubmen have had
a month in which to practice since
their last appearance, they will
no doubt give the Varsity a closer
game than on that occasion. It is
probable that there will be some for
mer Stanford baseball stars in the
visitors' line-up, including Paul Par
ker, '03, and A. J. Chalmers, ex-'O7,
who appeared under the Olympic em
blem in the game here on Washing
ton's birthday. Nothing more is def
initely known as to the personnel
of the visiting team, although it is
likely that there will be many of
the same players in the line-up who
appeared here before.
Theile will do the pitching for the
: Varsity, but the battery of the Olym
j pians has not been announced.
