# STATEMENT WILL BE GIVEN TO COMMITTEE TOMORROW
## Meeting of Student Body Held Tonight Results in Most Conservative Action 
### 
After the most remarkable Student Body meeting that lias ever
been held at Stanford University, the undergraduates tonight votc<«
in favor of handing a statement to the Student Affairs Committee
which expresses the sentiment of the Student Body in regard to
the parade. This conclusion was reached after two hours of serious
discussion, after such men as Dr. .Max Farrand, Coach Lanagan, ami
President A. A. Murphy, of the Student Body, had expressed them
selves and given their advice.. As the matter now stands it is a
question as to what recognition the Student Affairs Committee will
give this statement and what will be their next move.
This is the statement that will hi' presented to the Student Af
fairs Committee tomorrow morning: ."The Associated Students of
Stanford University realize that certain things occurred in the parade
of last Thursday night which are causes for sincere regret.
"We wish to condemn most strongly the insults that were of
fered to any individuals and to express our sincere regrets that the
same were offered.
"We wish to condemn as a breach of University discipline the
action of the men engaged in tlx' parade in invading the Library and
the Memorial Court.
Tilt •se tilings were done without malice or evil intent and are ab
solutely contrary to the sane sentiment of the Student Body."

In a special Student Body meet
ing which lasted two hours this ev
ening. and at which Professor Max
Farrand, Coach J. F. Lanagan, and
a large number of the most promin
ent Seniors in the University ex
pressed their convictions on the case j
of the twelve students who were sus- I
pended yesterday, on the parade of j
Thursday night, and on what expres-1
sleu. of opinion the Student Body j
should make, the above resolutions j
i were adopted by unanimous vote.
The widest and freest, discussion !
of the situation was called for by I
President Murphy and given by ev- j
erv one who spoke. The words of i
j every speaker carried conviction as
! to what, he thought after having con
sidered the matter at length.
The resolutions, proposed by the
! representatives of the students, were
; adopted by a unanimous vote. A mo-\
lion was also carried to the effect'
i that the same committee should pre-
I sent the statement to the Student
I Affairs Committee. A unanimous
vote of thanks was given to Presi
dent Murphy and the members of the
student committee for their efforts
in behalf of the twelve suspended
students.
President Murphy Opens Meeting.
The Student Body meeting was
opened by President Murphy at 7:40
with the following Introductory re
marks: "I think, fellows, all those
present should regard this as a closed
meeting of the Student Body. We
are not deciding anything except for
Ourselves." After this brief state
ment there was a standing vote tak
i en by which the newspaper men were
I allowed to remain in the meeting,
I provided they send out reports at
I their discretion. A second standing

vote was taken which decided that
all faculty men should leave the
meeting who were not invited to at
tend.
Then it was decided to dispense
with the reading of the minutes,
and the real business of the meeting
began with a statement of the work
of the special committee appointed
011 Tuesday night, consisting of
Knupp, Stewart, Murphy, and Turner.
This statement was substantially the
same as that which appears in to
night's "Daily Palo Alto," telling of
the efforts of the student committee
to have the Student Affairs Commit
tee reconsider their action.
Parraml Makes Strong Appeal.
After President Murphy had spok
en, Professor Max Farrand, head of
the History department, came for
ward ;ind made a plea to the Student
Body against the policy of "striking."
Dr. Farrand said in part: "It is
my object to put a stop to one phase
of this discussion. I wish to speak
as <111 elder brother, but also as a
member of the faculty, a body to
which you are placing yourself in op
position. It. is simply on the possi
bility of the Student Body striking
that 1 wish to speak.
"Those who have placed their
names on the petition stating they
were in the parade should take what
ever punishment is meted out. to them
without whimpering. By walking out
you are going to accomplish nothing.
The Student Affairs Committee is
duly appointed. When you place
[yourself in opposition to constituted
| authority you unite the Faculty, the
j President, and the Board of Trustees
against you. it. is right for every
man to withdraw if he feels the con
ditions are unbearable. 1 advise him
