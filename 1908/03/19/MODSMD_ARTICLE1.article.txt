# STATEMENT WILL BE GIVEN TO COMMITTEE TOMORROW
## Meeting of Student Body Held Tonight Results in Most Conservative Action 
### 
After the most remarkable Student Body meeting that lias ever
been held at Stanford University, the undergraduates tonight votc<«
in favor of handing a statement to the Student Affairs Committee
which expresses the sentiment of the Student Body in regard to
the parade. This conclusion was reached after two hours of serious
discussion, after such men as Dr. .Max Farrand, Coach Lanagan, ami
President A. A. Murphy, of the Student Body, had expressed them
selves and given their advice.. As the matter now stands it is a
question as to what recognition the Student Affairs Committee will
give this statement and what will be their next move.
This is the statement that will hi' presented to the Student Af
fairs Committee tomorrow morning: ."The Associated Students of
Stanford University realize that certain things occurred in the parade
of last Thursday night which are causes for sincere regret.
"We wish to condemn most strongly the insults that were of
fered to any individuals and to express our sincere regrets that the
same were offered.
"We wish to condemn as a breach of University discipline the
action of the men engaged in tlx' parade in invading the Library and
the Memorial Court.
Tilt •se tilings were done without malice or evil intent and are ab
solutely contrary to the sane sentiment of the Student Body."

In a special Student Body meet
ing which lasted two hours this ev
ening. and at which Professor Max
Farrand, Coach J. F. Lanagan, and
a large number of the most promin
ent Seniors in the University ex
pressed their convictions on the case j
of the twelve students who were sus- I
pended yesterday, on the parade of j
Thursday night, and on what expres-1
sleu. of opinion the Student Body j
should make, the above resolutions j
i were adopted by unanimous vote.
The widest and freest, discussion !
of the situation was called for by I
President Murphy and given by ev- j
erv one who spoke. The words of i
j every speaker carried conviction as
! to what, he thought after having con
sidered the matter at length.
The resolutions, proposed by the
! representatives of the students, were
; adopted by a unanimous vote. A mo-\
lion was also carried to the effect'
i that the same committee should pre-
I sent the statement to the Student
I Affairs Committee. A unanimous
vote of thanks was given to Presi
dent Murphy and the members of the
student committee for their efforts
in behalf of the twelve suspended
students.
President Murphy Opens Meeting.
The Student Body meeting was
opened by President Murphy at 7:40
with the following Introductory re
marks: "I think, fellows, all those
present should regard this as a closed
meeting of the Student Body. We
are not deciding anything except for
Ourselves." After this brief state
ment there was a standing vote tak
i en by which the newspaper men were
I allowed to remain in the meeting,
I provided they send out reports at
I their discretion. A second standing

vote was taken which decided that
all faculty men should leave the
meeting who were not invited to at
tend.
Then it was decided to dispense
with the reading of the minutes,
and the real business of the meeting
began with a statement of the work
of the special committee appointed
011 Tuesday night, consisting of
Knupp, Stewart, Murphy, and Turner.
This statement was substantially the
same as that which appears in to
night's "Daily Palo Alto," telling of
the efforts of the student committee
to have the Student Affairs Commit
tee reconsider their action.
Parraml Makes Strong Appeal.
After President Murphy had spok
en, Professor Max Farrand, head of
the History department, came for
ward ;ind made a plea to the Student
Body against the policy of "striking."
Dr. Farrand said in part: "It is
my object to put a stop to one phase
of this discussion. I wish to speak
as <111 elder brother, but also as a
member of the faculty, a body to
which you are placing yourself in op
position. It. is simply on the possi
bility of the Student Body striking
that 1 wish to speak.
"Those who have placed their
names on the petition stating they
were in the parade should take what
ever punishment is meted out. to them
without whimpering. By walking out
you are going to accomplish nothing.
The Student Affairs Committee is
duly appointed. When you place
[yourself in opposition to constituted
| authority you unite the Faculty, the
j President, and the Board of Trustees
against you. it. is right for every
man to withdraw if he feels the con
ditions are unbearable. 1 advise him
to take out a leave of absence, and
I advise any man who does not be
lieve conditions are unbearable to
stay. You may question the justice
and wisdom of the Student Affairs
Committee, but not its motives. I
believe the committee is acting for
what it believes to be the best in
terests of Stanford. Please God,
Stanford is going to survive!"
Professor Far rand's speech was fol
lowed by prolonged cheers and ap
plause.
Lanagan for Strong Protest.
The next speaker was Advisory
Coach James F. Lanagan, '00, who
spoke as follows: "Tf you men think
you did anything wrong—and '
think all the men in the parade will
agree that marching through the
Library was wrong—you should cer
tainly be ready to admit it. I
am against parades after so-called
"beer-busts." This parade was a
protest—which the students have a
right to make. I believe the action
of the committee in inflicting its
worst penalty for a trivial offense
is the worst thing that has happen
ed in an American university. I
believe the action of the committee
is unwise, unjust, and unfair." Lan
agan then discussed the strike
phase of the question and said he
was against a strike. He said, how
ever, that the only point in which he
did not agree with Dr. Farrand was
in regard to the men who were sus
pended accepting their penalty with
out a murmur. Lanagan said he be
lieved that there should be a mur
mur—a roar. "You should show
the Faculty, Trustees, and President
that you mean it,"he said.
Then Coach Lanagan advised the
Student Body against hasty action,
but he also urged them to make a
determined and strong fight against
this injustice and for reinstatement
of the students.
Other Prominent Speakers.
Coach Lanagan was followed by
Graduate Manager Knupp, who stated
that both the students and the com
mittee were wrong and he believed
that the first step toward remedying
the matter should come from the stu
dents.
F. \V. Turner, 'OS, said he believed
that getting back the twelve men
was only the first step in trying to
secure that harmony between the
Student Affairs Committee and the
students which should exist. This
is only the first step and we should
go further. What should be done
was up to the Student Body to decide,
said Turner.
Captain K. L. Fenton, of the base
ball team, was the next speaker, and
he was absolutely firm in his de
termination to fight the question to
a finish. He said he believed that
the time for compromise—which he
believed in under ordinary circum
stances —had passed. He said it
was a great crisis and that we should
fight for our position. The alumni
are with us, said Fenton.
Various Ideas Presented.
Following Captain Fenton there
were several speakers who repre
sented various attitudes. J. E. Stew
art, '08, was against a strike because
he did not believe it would do any
good. I. B. Cross, instructor in
the Economics department, took the
same position. John E. Cushing,
'08, former editor of the"Daily Palo
Alto," warned the men to act careful
ly and not do anything that would
not bring good results. W. R. Cole,
'05, Captain Koerner, of the foot
ball team, and J. R. Pemberton, all
voiced their opinions strongly in
favor of a determined protest by th»
students, and Cole, who is a San
Francisco alumnus, said he believed
the old Stanford men in the city
would back the Student Body up in
a sane and determined fight against
injustice.
R. J. McFadden, '05, E. J. Nash,
'08, A. N. Cole, '08, and F. A. Cur
tin, '08, all spoke against a strike,
but favored giving the committee
some chance to rectify its mistake,
before taking any other action.
