# Orchestra Practicing Hard.
## 
### 
The orchestra had a satisfactory
: practice last night on the Junior
Play music. Out of the sixteen num
| hers that will be rendered by the or
chestra, only six pieces have arrived,
the opening choruses of Acts 1 and
11, finale to Act I, and three songs.
The contract, which was signed by
the orchestra, was to have all the
! music here by March 16, but this
contract has not been kept. The or
chestra, however, will continue its
practices on what music they have
and will commence on the other
music as soon as it is received.
