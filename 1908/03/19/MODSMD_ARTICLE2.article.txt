# FIFTY MEN QUESTIONED
## SIGNERS OF PETITION WILL ALL BE EXAMINED. Committee Makes Decision at Noon Today Which Does Not Relieve the Situation. 
### 
President A. A. Murphy, 'OS, and
the committee .appointed by him,
composed of .). E. Stewart, '08, Gu\
Knupp, '07, and F. W. Turner, '08,
met the Student Affairs Committee
this morning to hear their action
on the statement signed by the 24G
men who participated in the parade.
The result of the meeting of the
affairs committee is contained in the
notice of the committee posted at
1:30, to the effect that each signer
will be examined, and that "The
committee will sit at once and will
notify individual signers as it is able
to meet them."
President Murphy, of the Student
Body, said that the committee gave
as a reason for examining the sign
ers in the light of the fact that their
statement was regarded as prima
facie evidence of participation in the
parade, was that the committee had
reason to believe that a few of the
signers at least were not participants
in the parade.
Chairman Clark's Statement.
The action of the Student Affairs
Committee on the statement handed
to Chairman Clark yesterday is con
tained in the notice handed to the
representatives of the students, and
posted at 1:30 today. The notice
follows:
"The Committee on Student Af
fairs has in its hands a statement
which contains prima facie evidence
of participation in the parade of
March 12.
"The committee will give individ
ual hearings to the signers of this
statement.
"The committee will sit at once
and will notify individual signers as
it is able to meet them.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK.'
Students Before Committee.
The committee adjourned about 2
o'clock and reconvened about, half
an hour later. The task of examin
ing the signers of the statement was
commenced this afternoon. A large
crowd of students waiting to be ex
amined was at the Presidents Of
fice for the balance of the after
noon. The committee will take no
action on the men who have confess
ed their participation in the parade
until they go into session for that
purpose. Each man that has been
called before the committee has been
asked practically the same questions
and it appears to be the intention
of the members of the committee to
ascertain the exact status of every
signer of the petition. There is no
intimation from the questions asked
as to what course the committee will
purine ;with- these men, and when
the men left the room after being
interviewed by the committee they
stated that there was apparently no
definite intention on the part of the
committee as to a general policy.
At about 5 o'clock this afternoon
the Council Room, where the stu
dents were being summoned before
the committee, was closed, and no
more men are to go before the Com
mittee today. Up to that hour about
fifty signers of the parade petition
had appeared before Professor Clark
and his committee. No further state
ment was made by Chairman Clark
in regard to the Situation, and the
committee went into private session
to consider the matter.
President Murphy's Views.
President Murphy summed up the
attitude of the Student Affairs Com
mittee after the two conferences of
the committee of students and
Clark's committee as follows: "The
Student Affairs Committee says that
it cannot afford to barter with the
students in a matter of University
discipline. The committee does not
wish to make any treaty with the
students in regard to the present
discussion. The members of the
committee regard the statement, of
the 246 men who took part in the
parade as evidence of guilt and must
act upon the same."
Before hearing the action of the
Student Affairs Committee this morn
ing, the representatives of the stu
dents, telling the committee that
they were not speaking officially,
asked whether, if the students would
furnish satisfactory assurance, by
the pledge of twenty-five or thirty
representative men, that the efforts
of the students would be used to
maintain good order, the committee
would reconsider the suspension of
the twelve men suspended on Tues
day. The answer received was in
the negative.
Appeal for Harmony.
At the meeting of the student rep
resentatives and the Student Affairs
Committee yesterday, the students
said that they came to the commit
tee in the hope that harmonious re
lations could be established between
the Faculty and the students at
large. They used their efforts to
persuade the committee that recon
sideration was the best course to
pursue, but were unsuccessful. Af
ter the adjournment of the commit
tee, the statement of the 24 6 stu
dents was handed to Chairman Clark.
Prominent Alumni Interested.
Paul M. Downing, '95, and F. B.
T. Lee, '01, two prominent alumni
from San Francisco, arrived on the
Campus today and for more than
an hour were in private consultation
with the members of the Student
Affairs Committee. After these men
came from this conference they re
fused to make any statement as to
what took place during their inter
view with the committee. Both
Downing and Lee stated, however,
that they discussed the affair with
the committee merely as interested
individuals, and not as the repre
sentatives of any organization what
ever.
