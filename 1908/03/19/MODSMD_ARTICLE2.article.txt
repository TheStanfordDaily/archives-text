# FIFTY MEN QUESTIONED
## SIGNERS OF PETITION WILL ALL BE EXAMINED. Committee Makes Decision at Noon Today Which Does Not Relieve the Situation. 
### 
President A. A. Murphy, 'OS, and
the committee .appointed by him,
composed of .). E. Stewart, '08, Gu\
Knupp, '07, and F. W. Turner, '08,
met the Student Affairs Committee
this morning to hear their action
on the statement signed by the 24G
men who participated in the parade.
The result of the meeting of the
affairs committee is contained in the
notice of the committee posted at
1:30, to the effect that each signer
will be examined, and that "The
committee will sit at once and will
notify individual signers as it is able
to meet them."
President Murphy, of the Student
Body, said that the committee gave
as a reason for examining the sign
ers in the light of the fact that their
statement was regarded as prima
facie evidence of participation in the
parade, was that the committee had
reason to believe that a few of the
signers at least were not participants
in the parade.
Chairman Clark's Statement.

representatives of the students, and
posted at 1:30 today. The notice

"The committee will give individ

statement.
"The committee will sit at once
and will notify individual signers as
it is able to meet them.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK.'
Students Before Committee.
The committee adjourned about 2
o'clock and reconvened about, half
an hour later. The task of examin
ing the signers of the statement was
commenced this afternoon. A large
crowd of students waiting to be ex
amined was at the Presidents Of
fice for the balance of the after
noon. The committee will take no
action on the men who have confess
ed their participation in the parade
until they go into session for that
purpose. Each man that has been
called before the committee has been
asked practically the same questions
and it appears to be the intention
of the members of the committee to
ascertain the exact status of every
signer of the petition. There is no
intimation from the questions asked
as to what course the committee will
