# ALUMNI ARE INTERESTED
## MANY SAN FRANCISCANS KEENLY CONCERNED IN CRISIS. Sentiment Has Been Expressed By Some Strongly in Favor of Students. 
### 
There is no doubt that the pres-
I ent situation here in regard to the
suspension of the twelve men by the
| Student Affairs Committee, and the
organized protest of the Student
I Body upon the matter has aroused
| the interest of every alumnus in San
I Francisco. It is also undoubtedly
| true that the greater part of the
| alumni feel that the students are jus
tified in their position at the present
time. Every move that is made by
the students and Faculty is being
watched by the alumni in San Fran
cisco intense interest. There
have been messages received here
today by various members of the
Student Body asking about the sit
uation and stating that many of the
alumni are with the students in a
I strong protest against this injustice.
Alumni Tome to Campus.
Besides Paul Downing, '95, and
; F. B. Lee, '01, who arrived on the
| Campus this morning, there are other
I strong alumni who are sufficiently
interested to come down from the
; city and take part in the present dis
| cussion between the Student. Affairs
1 Committee and the undergraduates.
It is difficult to obtain any definite
opinion as to what is the personal
feeling of some of the alumni on the
I matter, as they feel that, they are
! not in sufficiently intimate touch
> with affairs here to be positive. How
! ever, there is certainly a good pro
| portion who feel that the Student,
i Body is right, and all the alumni are
intensely interested in the present
i crisis.
' The amount of notoriety that has
been given the affairs by the metro
-1 politan papers has also aroused the
| interest of business men and lawyers
I throughout the city, and no affair
I
has ever occurred at. Stanford of
| more widespread importance.
