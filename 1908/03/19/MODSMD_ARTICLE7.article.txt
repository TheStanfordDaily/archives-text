The special meeting of the Stu
dent Body tonight was the most mo
mentous gathering that has ever
been held by the undergraduates of
this University. After calmly and
seriously considering this critical sit
uation in regard to the suspension of
the twelve students for participation
in the parade of last Thursday night,
Ihe Student Body has voted to hand
;i statement to the Student Affairs
Committee which represents the san
est and most conservative position
that it is possobile for the Student
Body to take at this time. In as
suming such an attitude the Student
Body shows remarkable discretion
and the results should certainly be
good.
In reviewing the proceedings of
tonight's meeting, the"Daily Palo
Alto" feels that its original position
in regard to the affair remains un
changed. The students may have
acted rashly and injudiciously, and
there were certain objectionable fea
tures in the parade; but the action
of the Student Affairs Committee
in regard to the matter has certain
ly been unjust and far too severe
in proportion to the offense commit
ted. On these two points we remain
absolutely fixed. There can be no
doubt of this; it is simply a matter
as to what is the best procedure to
remedy this injustice. After such a
meeting as that held tonight we are
perfectly willing to abide by the
decision of the Student Body and
await the action of the Student Af
fairs Committee. However, we be
lieve that this committee should act
without delay. This should be done
in justice to the twelve men sus
pended, in justice to the two hundred
and forty-six signers of the parade
petition, and in justice to every mem
ber of the Student Body who has
calmly taken a most conservative
attitude on the matter at a time
when conservatism is truly commen
dable.
