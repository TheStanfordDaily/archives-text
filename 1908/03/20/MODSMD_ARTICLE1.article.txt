# VARSITY TRACK MEET
## U.S.C. ATHLETES EXPECT TO TAKE FORTY POINTS. Absences Handicap Stanford Team But Should Win Easily.â€”Arrival of Southerners Delayed. 
### 
The track meet between the Var
sity athletes and the team from the
University of Southern California
will he held on the Stanford track
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, if
Ihe southern athletes arrive in time
to begin the competition at that
hour. The U. S. C. team left Los An
geles this afternoon and should ar
rive in Palo Alto at 7:17 or 9:31
tomorrow morning. Owing to the
unsettled condition of the Student
Body yesterday afternoon, Manager
Knup]) canceled the date, but after
the meeting last, night telegraphed
that he would still hold the meet.
His message, however, reached Los
Angeles too late to enable the men
to catch the morning train.
The visiting team is composed of
fifteen men and on account of bet
ter condition is considered superior
to the aggregation which was so
badly defeated in Los Angeles two
weeks ago. According to reports
from the South, Coach Holmes ex
pects his men to spring several sur
prises and is counting on forty or
more points for IT. S. C. While the
Varsity will be handicapped by the
absence of some of the best, men, it
is not expected that the visitors will
succeed in securing as many points
as they anticipate. Instead of the
five first places which are expected,
the final score will probably be only
two.
