### 
The Association of American Uni
versities, of which Stanford is a
member, formulated at its last meet
ins a definition of "university" which
will do much to clear up this diffi
cult question.
"The association set up, in the
first, place, the criterion of a strong
graduate department of instruction
as fundamental; hut it also demands
that where there are professional
schools, one or more years of col
lege work shall he required as a
prerequisite for admission in at least
one of these schools, with the ul
timate intention of requiring it in
all. This action means, in the end,
that no professional degree shall be
given by a 'university' until the sat
isfactory completion of at least five
years of study. This cuts sharply
in two directions; to standardize the
universities and to raise the whole
level of professional education in
the United States."
