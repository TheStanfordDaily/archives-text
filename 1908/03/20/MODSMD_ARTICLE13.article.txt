# Students To Publish Californian
## 
### 
At a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California Associated
Students last, night, it was finally
decided that the "Daily Californian"
will be taken over by the student
body, beginning with next semester.
This will put an end to all financial
difficulties, and insure that a full
sized paper will be published reg
ularly hereafter.
