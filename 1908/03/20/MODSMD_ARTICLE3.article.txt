a meeting ol' the Student Hotly
for tonight. lie feels that a
meeting tonight will not ac
complish anything toward a re

Affairs Committee has issued a
statement which is not gener
ally considered encouraging,
President Murphy titles not be
lieve that a special meeting of
the undergraduates would re

ation of the signers of the pa
rade petition has continued he
fore Chairman Clark and his

the entire number should have

President Murphy, of the Associa
ted Students, and the student com
mittee, composed of Guy Knupp, '07,
J. E. Stewart, 'OS, and K. W. Tur
ner, 'OS, presented to the Student
Affairs Committee this morning the
statement which was unanimously
passed in the special Student Body
meeting last evening, attended by
900 moil of the University. Presi
dent Murphy made a statement con
cerning the passing of the resolu
tions. and presented them to the
Committee.
Chairman Clark, of the Student
Affairs Committee, read the state
ment to the other members of his
committee. After the reading a mo
tion was made, seconded and car
ried to accept the statment from the
Student Body. President Murphy
then asked if any of his fellow rep
resentatives wished to make a state
ment. Turner sketched the feeling
of regret which prevailed in the
meeting of last evening and stated
that men who participated in the
parade rose and expressed I hem
selves as being sorry.
After the student representatives
left, the committee conferred for an
hour and at 11:15 posted the follow
ing statement:
"The Committee on Student Af
fairs wishes to make public an
nouncement of its sincere apprecia
tion of the sentiments expressed in I
llx resolutions of the Associated I
Students, as presented by its rep
resentatives this morning. It does'
not consider, however, that the pre- J
sentation of these resolutions calls !
for an interruption in the proceed
ings already entered upon in the
matter of granting a hearing to all
students who have asked for com
mittee action concerning their par
ticipation in the parade of March i

12. The Committee feels that it is
but t'iiir to say to all concerned that
it does not feel warranted in recon
sidering its action in the case of
ihc twelve suspended students or in
discontinuing its hearing of the 24 7
signers of the petition received
March 19.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK,
"Chairman."
immediately after this statement
was posted, the Committee went in
to session again and recommenced
its examination of the remainder of
the 2 17 signers of the statement of
participation in the parade. Up to
12: 00, twenty-seven men had been
examined today.
The committee started again on
the examination at 2 o'clock.
Murphy Says Wait.
President A. A. Murphy, when in
terviewed today, made tlie follow
ing statement: "As I said in the
Student Body meeting last night, and
as 1 still think, the resolution as
adopted, was the best thing for the
students to do. Many fellows who
saw the statement of the committee
this morning believed that our action
had proved unavailing. Such I do
not." believe to be the case, it neces
sitated three days' thought to en
able the Student. Body to hold a
conservative meeting and admit
their mistakes, and yet the Student
Affairs Committee was expected to
reinstate the suspended men as soon
as they learned of our action. The
students have rectified their mis
takes, and the lapse of a day or two
cannot hurt their position.
"I thought from the first that the
punishment, meted out. to the twelve
men was too severe. I still think
so, and I believe the committee will
see fit to be lenient now that the
students have plainly acknowledged
that they are subject to University
discipline, and were in the wrong as
to certain matters for which they
have apologized. Hasty action can
not be expected in a serious matter
like this, and I am distinctly op
posed to calling another Student
Body meeting until the Student Af
fairs Committee has had ample time
to reach a final conclusion."

After the student representatives
left, the committee conferred for an
hour and at 11:15 posted the follow
ing statement:
"The Committee on Student Af
fairs wishes to make public an
nouncement of its sincere apprecia
tion of the sentiments expressed in I
llx resolutions of the Associated I
Students, as presented by its rep
resentatives this morning. It does'
not consider, however, that the pre- J
sentation of these resolutions calls !
for an interruption in the proceed
ings already entered upon in the
matter of granting a hearing to all
students who have asked for com
mittee action concerning their par
ticipation in the parade of March i

12. The Committee feels that it is
but t'iiir to say to all concerned that
it does not feel warranted in recon
sidering its action in the case of
ihc twelve suspended students or in
discontinuing its hearing of the 24 7
signers of the petition received
March 19.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK,
"Chairman."
immediately after this statement
was posted, the Committee went in
to session again and recommenced
its examination of the remainder of
the 2 17 signers of the statement of
participation in the parade. Up to
12: 00, twenty-seven men had been
examined today.
The committee started again on
the examination at 2 o'clock.
Murphy Says Wait.
President A. A. Murphy, when in
terviewed today, made tlie follow
ing statement: "As I said in the
Student Body meeting last night, and
as 1 still think, the resolution as
adopted, was the best thing for the
students to do. Many fellows who
saw the statement of the committee
this morning believed that our action
had proved unavailing. Such I do
not." believe to be the case, it neces
sitated three days' thought to en
able the Student. Body to hold a
conservative meeting and admit
their mistakes, and yet the Student
Affairs Committee was expected to
reinstate the suspended men as soon
as they learned of our action. The
students have rectified their mis
takes, and the lapse of a day or two
cannot hurt their position.
"I thought from the first that the
punishment, meted out. to the twelve
men was too severe. I still think
so, and I believe the committee will
see fit to be lenient now that the
students have plainly acknowledged
that they are subject to University
discipline, and were in the wrong as
to certain matters for which they
have apologized. Hasty action can
not be expected in a serious matter
like this, and I am distinctly op
posed to calling another Student
Body meeting until the Student Af
fairs Committee has had ample time
to reach a final conclusion."
