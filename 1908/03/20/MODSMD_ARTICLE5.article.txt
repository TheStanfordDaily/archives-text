# TO PLAY AT BERKELEY
## VARSITY WILL MEET ST MARY'S ON CALIFORNIA DIAMOND. Theile Will Pitch and Cardinal Hopes To Secure a Second Victory. 
### 
The varsity nine will journey to
I he campus of the University of Cal
ifornia, tomorrow and at 1:30 the
local players will cross bats with
| the Phoenix nine of St. Mary's Col
lege on the Blue and Gold diamond.
Arrangements for playing this con
test on the California grounds were
made in order that the Varsity might
become accustomed to the peculiar
ities of the diamond before the inter
collegiate series is begun. For simi
lar reasons the California team will
play the Santa Clara College aggre
gation on the local diamond on
March 25.
The contest tomorrow is the
fourth game to be played with St.
Mary's this season, the Varsity hav
ing been victorious once, while the
linal score has twice been favorable
to the collegians. With Theile in
Ihe box and either Mitchell or Rut
ledge behind the bat, Stanford will
tomorrow endeavor to even up the
number of victories credited to each
team, and a fast, game should result.
In the game with St. Mary's on
March 7, Theile pitched effective
ball, allowing only a few scratch
hits and striking out eight men.
Practically the same men who have
been playing the other positions in
the past few games will appear in
the Stanford line-up tomorrow.
The personnel of the St. Mary's
team has not been announced but
it is probable that the same men who
faced the Varsity in the last contest
will be seen in tomorrow's game.
The probable line-ups follow:
Stanford —Theile, pitcher; Mitch
ell, Rutledge, catcher; Bell, first
base: Scott, second base; Sampson,
