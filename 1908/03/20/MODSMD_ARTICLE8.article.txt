The announcement made by the
Student Affairs Committee this mor
ning, after receiving the resolution
of regret unanimously passed at last
night's meeting of the Student Body,
has further complicated the present
situation. This latest statement
from the committee announces that
the receipt of the Student Body res
olutions does not call for an inter
ruption in the present proceedings
of the committee; namely, the ques
tioning; of all those who signed the
former petition announcing their
participation. And the committee
further states that it does not feel
warranted in reconsidering its action
in the case of the twelve suspended
students. This statement may be
deemed by some to show an attitude
on the part of the committee to re
consider the situation of the entire
two hundred and fifty-nine men who
are involved in the affair, after the
present examination of petitioners
lias ended. However, we believe that
the committee should take some
more definite, action after receiving
such a resolution as was passed last
night by the Student Body. This
resolution places the Student Body
in the strongest possible position,
and we should expect the committee
to act on the cases of the twelve sus
pended students. By this question
ing of all men involved in the parade
nothing new can be developed re
garding the facts in the case of the
twelve who are suspended. Mean
while these men are in an extreme
ly unsatisfactory position and there
does not seem to be any just cause
for delay upon the part of the com
mittee. There should be some abso
lutely definite action taken on these
cases at once.
In regard to the position of the
entire Student Body, we believe it
is the duty of every man who signed
the petition pledging himself to sup
port the men involved in the parade,
against severity and injustice, should
abide by this pledge. The stand
should be made firmly and unani
mously upon the part of the Student
Body. We are engaged in a protest
against what we honestly believe to
be injustice and extreme severity.

We believe that the position of the
Student Body is absolutely right,
and particularly strong since the
conservative action at the meeting
held last night. Therefore, we be
lieve we are right in protesting
against further delay at this critical
time. The committee should take a
definite action.
At the present time the situation
has become so serious, and the re
lations between the Student Body
and the committee have reached such
a point that we believe the alumni
should step in and use their efforts
toward having this question definite
ly settled without further delay.
The position ot the Student Itody is
absolutely right and what we now
need above all other things is posi
tive and immediate action.
