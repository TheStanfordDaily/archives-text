# DEFEATS PHOENIX NINE
## VARSITY WINS FAST GAME BY SCORE OF 4 TO 1. Theile, in Excellent Form, Strikes Out Eleven Men.—Cardinal Plays Santa Clara Tomorrow. 
### 
In a fast exhibition of baseball that
was characterized by fast fielding
and effective pitching on both sides,
the Varsity defeated the St. Mary's
College team on the University of
California diamond Saturday after
noon, by the score of 4 to 1. The
Stanford team was seen to better ad
vantage than in any game played
this season, the fielders accepting all
chances perfectly and six clean hits
being secured from Hart's delivery.
Two errors on the part of Theile
and Mitchell were largely responsi
ble for the lone tally credited to St.
Mary's. Theile was in fine form, and
the opposing batters were unable to
connect effectively with his delivery,
lie fanned eleven men and allowed
only four scattered hits. Aside from
Theile's work in the box, two three
baggers by Sampson and Wirt and
Dunn's splendid catch of Sampson's
long fly to left field in the eighth in
ning were the features of the game.
Stanford secured a lead of two
runs in the first inning. Scott, the
first, man up, flew out to Wallace.
Owen singled, was advanced to sec
ond by Fenton's safe hit, and both
scored on Sampson's triple over the
center fielder's head. The next two
batters proved easy outs and Samp
son was left 011 third with the score
reading 2 to 0. In the second in
ning Ganong drew a pass, reached
second 011 Ball's sacrifice, stole third
and came home on Scott's infield
hit. Wirt's three-bagger in the sixth
and Duggan's fumble of Bell's drive
netted the fourth and last tally for
the Cardinal.

In a fast exhibition of baseball that
was characterized by fast fielding
and effective pitching on both sides,
the Varsity defeated the St. Mary's
College team on the University of
California diamond Saturday after
noon, by the score of 4 to 1. The
Stanford team was seen to better ad
vantage than in any game played
this season, the fielders accepting all
chances perfectly and six clean hits
being secured from Hart's delivery.
Two errors on the part of Theile
and Mitchell were largely responsi
ble for the lone tally credited to St.
Mary's. Theile was in fine form, and
the opposing batters were unable to
connect effectively with his delivery,
lie fanned eleven men and allowed
only four scattered hits. Aside from
Theile's work in the box, two three
baggers by Sampson and Wirt and
Dunn's splendid catch of Sampson's
long fly to left field in the eighth in
ning were the features of the game.
Stanford secured a lead of two
runs in the first inning. Scott, the
first, man up, flew out to Wallace.
Owen singled, was advanced to sec
ond by Fenton's safe hit, and both
scored on Sampson's triple over the
center fielder's head. The next two
batters proved easy outs and Samp
son was left 011 third with the score
reading 2 to 0. In the second in
ning Ganong drew a pass, reached
second 011 Ball's sacrifice, stole third
and came home on Scott's infield
hit. Wirt's three-bagger in the sixth
and Duggan's fumble of Bell's drive
netted the fourth and last tally for
the Cardinal.
