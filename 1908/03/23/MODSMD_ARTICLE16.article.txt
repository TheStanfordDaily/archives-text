# MOTT GIVES TWO ADDRESSES.
## Speaks to Large Audiences on "Moral and Spiritual Atrophy" and "Temptations." 
### 
John R. Mott spoke yesterday mor
ning at the regular Sunday service
before an audience which entirely
filled the lower floor of Assembly
Hall. Taking the parable of the
Talents as a basis for his talk, Mott
emphasized the fact that we needed
constantly to exercise our moral and
spiritual faculties, or else they would
become atrophied. This he called
a most insidious danger, because it
is most likely to come over one who
feels that he is entirely secure. There
is only one way to test whether a
person is becoming atrophied in his
moral and spiritual nature, and that
is the amount of time he spends in
cultivating them. The speaker re
marked that one wno spent no time
whatever in training his mind would
not expect to have it develop much;
and that the same reasoning applied
to the moral and spiritual nature.
In the evening Mott again spoke
in Assembly Hall to a large audience
of men, on the subject of "Tempta
tion." After showing that, tempta
tion was absolutely universal, he
stated that it was just as absolutely
conquerable, and laid down the prin
ciples by which one might be super
ior to his temptations.
Mott has an immense fund of il
lustrations, drawn from his twenty
years' contact, with college men, and
is an unusually clear and logical
speaker.
