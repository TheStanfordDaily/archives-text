Seniors Before Committee.
A committee of Seniors, represent
ing the twelve suspended students,
waited upon Chairman Clark, of the
Student Affairs Committee, at an ear
ly hour this afternoon for the pur
pose of ascertaining whether there
was any possibility for a reconsid
eration of their cases. In response
to the request of this committee,
Clark stated that as far as he was
personally concerned absolutely no
possibility of a revocation of the
original decision remained . Profes

sor Price acquiesced in the state
ment of the chairman. The other
three members of the committee
were not present at the time of this
interview.
Saturelay's Proceedings.
The signers of the parade petition
took a further step toward the re
consideration of the cases of the
twelve students suspended by the
Student Affairs Committee at a meet
ing held in Encina clubroom Satur
day afternoon. After discussion of
the best move to make, it.was de
cided to sign practically the same
statement that was passed as a reso
lution by the Student Body on Thurs
day evening. Every man in the room
who was in the parade signed the
statement individually.
The statement to which the men
subscribed is as follows: "We, the
undersigned students who partici
pated in the parade on Thursday,
March 12, realize that certain things
occurred in the parade which are
causes for sincere regret. We wish
to condemn most strongly the in
sults that were offered to any indi
vidual and to express our sincere re
grets that the same were offered.
We wish to condemn as a breach of
University discipline the action of
the men engaged in the parade in
invading the Library and the Mem
orial Court. These things were done
without malice or evil intent, and
are absolutely contrary to the saner
sentiment of the men concerned."
President Murphy called the meet
ing for 1:30 Saturday afternoon,
when it became known that the Stu
dent Affairs Committee had posted
a notice to the effect that it did not
consider the resolutions passed by
the Student Body as an apology from
the signers of the original parade
petition.
Clark Issues Fourth Notice.
This notice, which was posted
about 9 o'clock on Saturday morning,
follows:
"The Committee on Student. Af
fairs is credibly informed that the
students concerned in the parade of
March 12 consider the resolutions
passed at the meeting of the Asso
ciated Students 011 March 20, con
stitute an apology on the part of the
247 men. The committee does not
wish the students to retain this mis
conception. The committee believes
that reflection will show that such is
not the fact, and that the commit
tee must still act on the petition
of the 24 7 men, and proceed calmly
and carefully in determining what
in fact was the participation of each
individual concerned.
"The students must remember that
but one sctatement is before the com
mittee from the 24 7 men, namely,
the petition. The committee will en
deavor to be entirely fair, will calm
ly and carefully determine what
should he the final action in these
cases, fridlvidually and collectively,
but it asks the students to remember
that to do this requires time.
(Signed) "A. B. C^ARK,
"Chairman."
Examination Goes On.
Saturday was devoted by the Stu
dent Affairs Committee to examina
tion of participants in the parade,
and to hearing Professor C. li. Lew
ers, formerly of the Faculty of the
Law department. Professor Lewers,
who appeared as an alumnus and a
former member of the Faculty, met
the committee about 2 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon and remained with
it for nearly half an hour. By Sat
urday afternoon at 4 o'clock, when
the committee adjourned, approxi
mately 175 men had been examined.
The rate of examination was quick
er this morning, so that at 1.30 this
afternoon, only about fifteen men re
mained to be seen by the committee
in their afternoon session.
