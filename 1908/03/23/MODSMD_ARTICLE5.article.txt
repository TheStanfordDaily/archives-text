From the statement issued by
Chairman Clark at nine o'clock on
Saturday morning it would appear
that the committee is now solely
concerned with the cases of the two
hundred and forty-seven signers of
the petition which announced their
participation in the parade. It would
further appear from the statement
that Chairman Clark made this af
ternoon to the Seniors who were
suspended, that there was only a
remote chance of the twelve sus
pended men being reconsidered or
reinstated. If it is a fact that as far
as the committee is concerned the
cases of these twelve men are fin
ally settled, then we believe that the
twelve suspended men have a perfect
right to appeal to the President of
the University. In this matter they
appear amply justified. It has been
a week since they were suspended
and during that, time there has not
been the slightest intimation from
Chairman Clark that they were to
even be reconsidered. Today there
is a strong intimation to the con
trary. Therefore, these men ought
to make an appeal and have their
cases settled permanently one way
or the other. This delay accomplish
es no good. When this appeal of
the twelve men is positively settled,
then the Student Body will be in
a position to take some stand; now
the entire community is in a state
of the most intense unrest and the
continual delay only increases this
condition. Even those who are but
remotely interested in the matter
now believe that it should be defin
itely decided without delay.
As far as the cases of the two
hundred and forty-seven who signed
I he parade petition are concerned,
we believe they are in a slightly bet
ter position to await action as
they are still attending classes. How

ever, our jtosition in the entire mat
ter remains absolutely the same as
lias been continually stated during
tlie past few (lays ami Avhat. is ne
cessary above everything else is def
inite and immediate action.
