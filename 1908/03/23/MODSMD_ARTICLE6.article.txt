In view of the announcement by
the university health authorities that
vaccination is required of all mem
bers of the University, a word of
comment is necessary. This require
ment is merely a wise measure and
should cause no alarm or confusion
among the members of the Student
Body. The Committee 011 Public
Health has considered this action for
some time past and it is merely a
preventative measure. There is now
but one known *-ase of smallpox
among the undergraduates and there
is no reason for any excitement
over the situation. But every stu
dent should follow out the commit
tee's requirement at once, for his
own protection as well as to aid the
authorities in preventing the spread
of the disease.
