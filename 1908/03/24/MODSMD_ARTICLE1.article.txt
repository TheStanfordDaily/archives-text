Chairman C. L. Roberts, of the

afternoon that the reason why a pro

to play for "Butterfly Isle" was that
Robert Hughes of the Sixteenth
Street Theatre in San Francisco, who
had charge of the orchestration of
the music, found it impossible to
finish his work in time to live up to
his agreement, with the University
Orchestra. The Junior Opera com
mittee gave the orchestra a release
from playing for the opera in case
the music failed to arrive in time.
Harry James, musical director of
the Princess Theatre, San Francis
co, who with Miss Violet Arthur, of
the theatre, has directed the prepar
ation of the production, will lead the
orchestra on Thursday evening, when
"Butterfly Isle" will be produced.
Elaborate costuming will distin
guish the opera from other perfor
mances held in Assembly Hall. The
women's chorus will have a change
from their opening costume for the
"Lotus," which is the musical num
ber at which the princess of Butter
fly Isle makes her entrance. Dif
ferent costumes will be used by the
chorus, which will be larger than in
the first act, in the opening of the
second. In this act there will be a
military song, in which a special
mixed chorus, garbed to suit the
number, will sing with a quartet of
the principals In the show.
