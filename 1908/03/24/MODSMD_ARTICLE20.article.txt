# REDWOODS ARE SAVED.
## Commission of Forestry Prevents Further Cutting of Trees in Big Basin. 
### 
The final outcome of the protract
ed hearing of the Sempervirens Club
before the State Commission of For
estry yesterday afternoon in the Eco
nomics seminar room was a firm as
surance from the commission that
not another redwood would be cut
within the confines of the Big Basin
and that every care would be taken
in removing the remainder of the
burnt timber.
The meeting was attended by at
least 100 of the most prominent peo
ple of Middle California, and was
presided over by Acting Governor
Warren Porter, who showed a splen
did spirit of fairness to both sides
of the controversy. A letter from
Doctor Jordan was read by Prof. E
G. Dudley, of the Systematic Bot
any department, expressing his sin
cere regret that official business in
San Francisco prevented his being
present.
Prof. Dudley, who was a member
of the fir si State Forestry Board
and closely identified with the move
ment for the purchase of the park,
took an unusually active part in the
proceedings. He made a strong ap
peal for the preserving of the red
wood forest and said in closing: "It
is my conception mid I still retain
it, that we are to keep this park
for the sake of the trees as long as
they shall live, and to leave the re
serve in its pristine beauty, with its
green undergrowth and moss covered
logs, so that it will be a natural and
unspoiled attraction for the people
of all time." Professor Dudley pre
sented good evidence of his conten
tion that redwoods apparently burn
ed past recovery would branch out
again if given time, by some remark
able photos of redwoods where new
branches were growing from charred
trunks.
The decision of the Forestry Board
was received with great satisfaction
by the Sempervirens Club and an
interesting discussion concerning the
welfare of (he Big Basin Reserve fin
ally closed the conference. Among
the representatives of the club at the
meeting were Prof. Abrahms, of the
Botany department, Prof. W. 1;. .Tep
sim, of the University of California,
Andrew P. Hill, of San Jose, Judge
John E. Richards, of San Jose, Rev.
Father Kenna, of San Francisco,
Prof. Wood, of San Jose Normal,
George Wharton James, the famous
Southern California naturalist, and
ex-Lieutenant Governor Jeter.
