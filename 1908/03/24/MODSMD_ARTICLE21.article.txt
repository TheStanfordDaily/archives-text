Despite the fact that statements
have been made to the effect that
"Butterfly Isle," the Junior Opera, is
made up of an original manuscript
with music adapted and arranged by
the committee, there seem yet to be
promiscuous and dubious discussions
as to the possibility of this year's
opera not being what it purports to
be as far as lyrics are concerned.
The book was selected and is to be
produced as an original effort. The
music was adapted by the commit
tee. That many of the lyrics need
ed complete revision or modification
to become appropriate should be evi
dent. This was handled by the au
thors of the manuscript. In the case
of some solo numbers, the lyrics
stand as adapted with the music. The
committee wishes to have it thor
oughly understood: the opera is an
original book and adapted music
with as many changes in the lyrics,
by the authors of the manuscript,
as is necessary to provide for their
fitness in the manuscript.
