# SCHOLARSHIP RULES.
## Leaves and Honorable Dismissals May Be Taken Out by Students In Good Standing. 
### 
The regulations applying to the j
granting of leaves of absence and |
honorable dismissals are of interest ,
at this time. All students who are !
not under discipline by the Commit-i
tee on Student Affairs and whose \
scholarship record for the semester j
is good, can take out a leave of ab- j
sence or an honorable dismissal.
There is practically little differ
ence between a leave of absence and
an honorable dismissal, except that j
in the latter case the student is re
commended to the favorable con
sideration of any other university,
and a statement is given to him as
to the number of hours to his cred
it tit, this University. In either case
the student may return to Stanford
at any subsequent time and con
tinue his work. Students whose
scholarship for the semester is de
ficient are not allowed to take out
a leave of absence during the last
six weeks of the semester. As there
are now remaining only about six
weeks of university work in this year
it will be impossible for anyone to
take out a leave or a dismissal who
is deficient in scholarship.
