# VARSITY GAME CALLED OFF.
## Santa Clara Team Fails To Arrive and Cardinal Nine Will Meet St. Mary's Tomorrow. 
### 
The game scheduled for this af
ternoon between the Varsity and the
Santa Clara College nine was not
played owing to the non-arrival of
the latter. And as the Santa Clara
team will meet the California varsity
here on Thursday afternoon instead
of the local players, as had previous
ly been scheduled. Manager Knupp
has aranged for a game with the
St. Mary's team tomorrow afternoon.
This game, the fifth in the series
with the Phoenix nine, will be called
at 2::>o on the St. Mary's diamond.
The series thus far has resulted in
two victories for each team and to
morrow's game should be hotly con
tested as a victory for either nine
will figure materially in the final
outcome of the series, the sixth and
last game of which will be played
on the local grounds on April 1.
The St. Mary's line-up will probab
ly be the same as in the game last
Saturday. For the Varsity Wltmer
will occupy the box while either Mit
chell or Rutledge will be at the re
ceiving end.
