# WILL HOLD TRACK MEET
## FRESHMAN ATHLETES WILL RUN NEXT SATURDAY. Stanford Team Handicapped By Absence of Raines in Hurdles and Possibly Wyman in Sprints. 
### 
Preliminary arrangements for the
intercollegiate Freshman meet to be
held on the Berkeley oval at 2:30
Saturday afternoon are about com
plete, and unless there is some radi
cal change in the situation, the meet
will occur at that time. The unset
tled conditions of the past week have
not improved the chances to turn out
a successful Freshman team as it has
interfered with training and spirit
among the men. At the present time
it appears possible that the 1911
team will be still further weakened
by the loss of two of its best athletes,
as both Raines and Wyman are now
on the sick list. It is absolutely cer
tain that Raines, who is ill at. his
home in Santa Cbna with mumps,
will not be able to compete, but it
is hoped that Wyman, who severely
wrenched a tendon in his leg yester
day while running the hundred, will
recover in time to enter the meet.
Trainer Moulton is rather dis
couraged at the prospect of entering
a meet with a team so severely crip
pled. but will nevertheless make the
best of the situation with what men
he has left. If Wyman is out of the
meet, Smitherum will have to work
hard in both sprints if he is to place
ahead of Vilas or Kretsinger, of
California. Boyd will now be the
only Stanford entry in the hurdles,
against a fast field of California hur
dlers.
