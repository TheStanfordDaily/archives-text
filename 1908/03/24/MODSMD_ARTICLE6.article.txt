# Statement Regarding Smallpox.
## 
### 
"To the Editor:
"The rumors to the effect, that
additional cases of smallpox have ap
peared on the Campus are unfound
ed. The requirement of vaccination
lias been made in order l'o prevent a
general outbreak. It is impossible
to express any opinion concerning
the development of smallpox .by
those exposed to the patient at pres
ent isolated. The average incubation
period is twelve days, and during
this time we may expect no addi
tional cases, unless others develop
as the result of exposure away from
the Campus prior to twelve days ago.
"There will be no necessity for a
quarantine, though the vaccination
certificate may be required by the
transportation companies before.;stu
dents are permitted to purchase tick
ets. Such certificates will be. issued
by the committee upon request. At
present there is no apparent, neces
sity for postponing the scheduled ev
ents of Junior Day and the field day.
Approximately .'!7"> students have
been vaccinated, and 200 students
have been approved as adequately
protected by successful vaccination
the past five years.
"Vaccination has been required of
the Faculty and the employees of
the University and the majority of
them have been vaccinated.
"Very truly yours,
"WILLIAM F. SNOW, M. D.,
"Chairman of Committee."
