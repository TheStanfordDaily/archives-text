It is now nine days since the so
called parade occurred. It has been
exactly a week since twelve men
were suspended for participation in
this parade. During all this time
the Committee on Student Affairs
has been busily engaged in receiv
ing petitions and apologies, as well
as in interviewing the two hundred
and forty-seven signers of the orig
inal petition. That the committee
lias practically completed its task
we are reliably assured, and as a
result some definite action is to be
announced tomorrow morning. This
will truly be good news to the Stu
dent Body. We believe that there
has been remarkable patience shown
by the students during this nerve
racking delay.
Whether there will be any positive
announcement in regard to the
twelve suspended men, we do not
know. But when the action of the
committee is announced tomorrow
ihe Student Body will know where
it stands. We sincerely hope that we
will not be disappointed in our ex
pectation of action tomorrow.
