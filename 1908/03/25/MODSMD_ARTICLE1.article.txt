# FORTY=ONE STUDENTS ARE SUSPENDED
## STAGE OPERA TOMORROW "BUTTERFLY ISLE" WILL BE SUNG IN EVENING. Class of 1909 Will Start Junior Day Festivities.—Tickets Wrongly Dated for Friday. 
### 
"Butterfly Isle," the Junior Opera,
will open the program of the annual
Junior festivities, when the Class of
1909 presents the much-talked-of
production in Assembly Hall tomor
row evening. Preparation has been
going on for two months, and the op
era bids fair to make a name for it
self in the annals of dramatics at the
University.
For the books and those of the
lyrics which were written by the
joint authors, D. H. Clift, '07, and
L. S. Levy, ex-'08, the sum of $75
was given as a prize. Ever since
the catchy music of good quality
which will be sung has been adapted
by the committee, Harry James and
Miss Violet Arthur, of the Princess
Theater, San Francisco, have been
bringing the chorus to a state of
perfection and giving the principals
the pointers necessary to make a
finished production. A professional
orchestra will play under the direc
tion of Conductor James.
The costumes worn by the chor
us and the women principals will be
far in advance of any previous op
eras, as far as beauty and brillian
cy are concerned. Under the direc
tion of Sword and Sandals, the op
era will be staged amid tropical
scenes.
The island in question, where all
the action takes place, is ruled by a
Shah and is claimed by five differ
ent nations, whose ambassadors are
at the court of the Shah. A contro
versy over the ownership furnishes
a thread of the plot, which includes
the love of Reggie Van Fleet for the
island princess and some other min
or matches. The German ambassa
dor, who is also in love with the
princess, has a comic part. Jasper,
the Shah's handy man, and Bolo, a
maiden, are the principal natives in
the show. Reggie's friend, Jimmy,
is a wireless operator on the island,
who finds his affinity in Miss Van
Fleet. A yellow reporter, the father
of Young Van Fleet, and the yacht
ing party in charge of Aunt Sarah,
complete the cast.
The parts, will be taken by the
following persons: Reggie Van Fleet,
E. Horner, '09; Jimmy Dyer, E. L.
Coffin, '11; His Majesty, the Shah,
H. S. Ross, '08; Herr Louis Stein,
