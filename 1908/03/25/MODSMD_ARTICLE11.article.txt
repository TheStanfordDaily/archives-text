# Must Present Prom. Tickets at Door.
## 
### 
The Junior Prom. Committee an
nounces that tickets must be pre
sented at the door. There will be
no reservation of seats for the sup
per which will be served at the
Stanford Inn immediately after the
Prom., so that those who wish to be
seated together must make their
own arrangements for so doing. The
grand march will start promptly at
eight o'clock, led by President D. P.
Crawford, who will attend the func
tion in spite of his injured foot. The
management has several "stunts"
which it is planning to pull off dur
ing the dances, but the nature of
these is being kept a close secret.
