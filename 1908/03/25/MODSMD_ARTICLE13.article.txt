# FACTS ABOUT VACCINATION.
## Students Must Comply With Committee's Orders Before Noon on Friday. 
### 
Two statements have been issued j
to the public by Dr. W. F. Snow,
chairman of the University Commit
tee on Public Health. They are \
as follows:
"The registration of all students
who have not complied with there- j
quirement of this committee regard
ing vaccination by noon, Friday, !
March 27, will be cancelled for a j
period of ten days from April 6.
"This action is taken in order to j
prevent students susceptible to small- !
pox from coming in contact with oth
er students in class and laboratory
work during the period of probable
danger. "WILLIAM F. SNOW,
"Chairman of Committee."
"The University does not provide
for the vaccination of students be
cause it is impossible for a public
vaccinator to properly follow the
course of the vaccinia to the com
pleted 'scar.'
"Many individuals in every com- j
munity have been eeriously injured
in health by improper care by the
physician performing the vaccina- \
tion.
"Vaccination is a surgical proced
ure and must be performed under
all the precautions employed in sur- j
gical operations with subsequent j
dressings. Proper vaccination re- j
quires: (1) cleansing and sterilizing
of the physician's hands; (2) |
cleansing and sterilizing of an ade
quate area of skin at the site of vac
cination; (3) sterile vacine points;
or tube syringes; (4) sterile dress- i
ings applied by the physician; (5)
at least two subsequent inspections
and dressings during the course of
the 'take,' and repetition of the i
vaccination if the first does not take; i
(6) as many additional office visits!
as may be required by the physician
in properly controlling the course of
the vaccinia.
"This committee is concerned on
ly in having each vaccination per
formed under the conditions of at
tention outlined above.
"WILLIAM F. SNOW,
"Chairman of Committee." !
The following statement was is
sued by Dr. W. F. Snow in regard
to the price of vaccination. It has :
been sent to all doctors in this vie- |
inity:
"Dear Doctor:
"Certain unfounded rumors have
been given space in the current news
papers to the effect that the Commit
tee on Public Health is desirous that
all students be charged $2.00 for
vaccination.
"The enclosed statement has been
posted for the information of the
students.
"The committee is concerned only
in having each student realize that
he must be properly vaccinated and
kept under observation by the phy
sician of his choice until the vac
cinia is complete.
"There is no foundation for the
statement that vaccinations perform
ed by physicians for less than $2.00
will be refused.
"Very truly yours,
"W. F. SNOW, M. TV
Dr. W. F. Snow, chairman of the
Public Health Committee, has in
terviewed the members of the Santa
Clara Health Society in Palo Alto
with reference to making a uniform
charge of one dollar for vaccination
lor a limited period., This was
not approved. Tho charge of two
dollars specified by the County Fee

bill, which was made to cover the
entire attendance necessary together
with dressing and vaccine material,
was adopted. In addition to this it
was agreed by the members that any
person who could not afford this
price would be vaccinated free of
charge.
