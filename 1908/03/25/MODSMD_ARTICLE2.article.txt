## 
### 
The Committee on Student Affairs has taken action in the mat
ter of the demonstration of March 12 as follows:
In the ease of the twelve students originally suspended action
has been reconsidered, and they have been placed in the same cat
egory with the 212 petitioners who voluntarily acknowledged par
ticipation in the demonstration.
As a result of the hearings given by the committee, these 254
participants have been separated into three groups.
I. (a) Those who were not in the parade—to the number of
17; (b) those who refused to testify to the fact of participation in
the parade—to the number of 2; (c) those who withdrew their
request that the committee investigate their part in the parade—
to the number of 1; (d) those who did not act independently in
signing the petition—to the number of If); (e) those who parti
cipated in a minor way—to the number of 41.
11. Those who participated actively, but in a portion only of the
parade—to the number of iJO.
lIT. Those who participated actively and fully in the demonstra
tion. (No number given.)
In regard to the first group, no action is contemplated by the
committee.
All students, excepting firsi-year students, in the second group
have had live unit hours added to requirements for graduation.
In regard to the third group, those who have been considered by
the committee as upperclassmen—to the number of 41, are sus
pended for the rest of the semester. Second-year students have
had .10 unit hours added to the requirements for graduation. First
year students have had five unit hours added to requirements for
graduation.

The Student Affairs Committee
published the above notice, announc
ing its wholesale slaughter, at 1:30
this afternoon, when all the notices
of punishment for participation in
the parade of March 12 were placed
in the University postoffice by As
sistant Registrar .1. E. McDowell. The
notice was posted on the bulletin
board of the President's Office, but
the knowledge that individual com
munications would be mailed short
ly after the noon hour, had spread
over the Campus by lunch time, and
a crowd of 200 students soon gath
ered to learn the fate of themselves
and their friends.
Original Twelve Acted Upon.
Of the original twelve suspended
students, the seven upperclassmen
are still suspended, for their penal
ty stands as first announced by the
Student Affairs Committee. The four
Sophomores who were suspended at
first were docked ten hours and one
Freshman was docked five hours.
The two latter penalties mean that
the men in question have these ex
tra. hours to make in addition to
the other requirements for gradua
tion.
The action of the committee re
lieves over 80 men of liability for
their part in the parade or in sign
ing the parade petition. New sus
pensions were made to the number
of 34. In total, about 160 men were
penalized.

Excitement at Postolfice.
As the announcements of suspen
sions and of minor punishment were
opened, they were received with
cheers and howls by the assembled
crowd. Nearly all the men who were
punished by suspension or by penal
ties of additional hours to be re
quired for graduation were present
to receive their notices. The noise
of the cheering reached to the far
thest parts of the Campus and men
hurried to the scene ot" the excite
ment.
The mail boxes in the postoffice
were never so quickly cleared of
their contents as when the last of
the notices had been distributed.
Men who suspected that their status
in the University was in jeopardy
hastened to open their mail. The
boxes of the fraternity houses and
the other groups of students were
relieved of their mail as soon as
any member could obtain the con
tents.
The man who got the mail did
not wait to make individual deliv
ery of any letters which bore the
stamp of the University on their en
velopes, but hastily opened the let
ters to learn what had befallen the
men concerned. The news of the pen
alties was spread by word of
mouth from man to man as they
elbowed each other in the post
office, on the steps and in the street,
near the Government building. So
