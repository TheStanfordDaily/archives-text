# MEN WANTED ON TRACK
## TRAINER MOULTON REQUIRES THE ATHLETES TO WORK. Freshman Meet Will Be Held Saturday and Wyman May Run. 
### 
"I "want every track man to come
to the track and begin regular train
ing tomorrow. Some of the men
have been irregular in their attend
ance for the past week, but from
this time on I wish to see everyone
training regularly. We have lost on
ly two men among those dismissed
and will not allow their absence to
interfere with our plans for the in
tercollegiate meet. A team as strong
as the one we have this year is not
wrecked by the loss of two men,
and we still have a strong chance
to defeat California on April 18.
The Freshman team will not be af
fected by the ruling of the commit
tee and will compete against the
Blue and Gold 011 Saturday."
"TRAINER MOULTON."
The above statement made this
afternoon by Trainer "Dad" Moul
ton expresses his attitude on the
question of any interruption of train
ing on account of the present unset
tled situation. Only two of the var
sity track squad have fallen under
the ban of the Student Affairs Com
mittee, so that the team will still
be a strong aggregation, which
"Dad" is desirous of holding togeth
er until the meet with California.
The track is being watered regular
ly and, as the new cinders pack in
to shape, is getting into excellent
condition.
Wyman's injury has not proven
quite so serious as was at first, fear
| ed and he may yet be able to com
pete Saturday. At the first exam
ination he was told to stay off his
feet for three days, but was able
to walk a little today. Miller's ankle
is still troubling him somewhat
when he trains, but is showing a
steady improvement. Reed is in bet
ter shape than at any time since
his injury.
