### 
In one of the best games of the
season, Si. Mary's baseball team won
from the Varsity this afternoon at
Oakland by the score of 3-2 after
ten innings of fast playing. Tin
feature of the game was the phe
nomenal pitching of the two slab
sters. Witmer striking out 13 men,
and Krause of St. Mary's fanning 16.
In the third inning Mitchell made
a run which would have won the
game for Stanford had it not been
for the fact that in running around
the diamond he failed to touch third
base.
The summary follows:
R. H. E.
Stanford 2 f> 5
St. Mary's 3 6 3
