The statement issued by Chair
man Clark this afternoon announc
ing the action of the Student Affairs
Committee upon the cases of the
students who participated in the
demonstration of March 12 has de
veloped a situation more complicat
ed than could have possibly been
expected by any member of the Stu
dent Body. The twelve men who
were originally suspended have not
all been reinstated. There have been
thirty-four students added to the list
of those suspended. Tn addition to
this drastic action, there have been
a large number of students, probably
over one hundred and fifty severe
ly disciplined for their participation
in the parade. And there are more
than eighty men who participated
in the parade to varying degrees,
who are apparently blameless in the
eyes of the committee and conse
quently received 110 punishment. This
latest announcement of the commit
tee shows a method of discrimina
tion that is beyond us to attempt
to interpret or understand.
We still believe that the penalty
of suspension for any degree of par
ticipation in the parade is far too
severe. It was too severe for the
original twelve and it is too severe
for every man upon whom it has
been inflicted. Furthermore, in its
method of intricate discrimination,
1 he committee has reached a con
clusion that we do not believe can
be defended as either logical or just.
When the matter is calmly consid
ered it is evident that some of the
men were undoubtedly suspended as
a result of their appearance before
the committee. This is unjust be
cause merely as a matter of tem
peraraent some men could make a
more calm appearance before the
committee than others. Some men
were asked questions that would

cause them to give answers that
would arouse the committee more
than others. That they should sub
sequently be dealt with more se
verely is not right. The men who
were originally suspended were not
punished because of any fact ex
cept that they participated in the
parade. That other men, who were
later called before the committee
for protesting against injustice and
severity to the original twelve,
should be severely punished and even
suspended because of the facts de
veloped at their interview, or be
cause of their attitude in the affair
is absolutely unfair.
In regard to the entire matter of
the committee's announcement we
believe that it is far too severe and
that the discrimination is absolutely
unjust. What action the Student
Body can take in regard to such
manifest injustice is a matter to be
determined at . the Student Body
meeting tomorrow afternoon. We
advise the Student Body to think
seriously on what method will be
most effective, but a strong protest
should be made against this latest
unjust action of the Student Affairs
Committee.
