# DECIDE TO MAKE STRONGEST PROTEST
## Student Body Meeting Results In Agreement To Have All Those Who Wish To Leave Sign Statement 
### 
When the men of the Student
j Body met this afternoon on the
bleachers at. the baseball diamond
there were close to a thousand stu
| dents in the gathering. President
i Murphy took his position on an ele
j vated stand in front, of the bleach
ers and after briefly summarising the
: present situation, called for a free
j discussion of the matter and what
; measures should be adopted to rem
i edy the present difficulty.
I F._ W. Turner, '08, was the first
I speaker and he spoke of the hostile
| attitude toward the students which
; the public has taken and said that
it was due to the fact, that the ac
! coiynts of the trouble which had
I gone out had been biased and he
' moved that a committee be appoint
i ed including H. Fitch, 'OS, and the
j editor of one of the other college
; publications to write a correct ac
j count of the trouble and to send it.
to the newspapers. In this way he
believed that public, opinion would
be won over to the side of the stu
dents. This motion was carried.
President Murphy then briefly out
lined the situation and said that the
principal question before the stu
dents was the advisability of the Stu
dent Body taking out leaves of ab
| sence.
Captain Kenton Speaks.
i The first, man to speak on this
! question was Captain Fenton. He
made a warm appeal for the Student
Body to support in every possible
way the men who were suspended,
saying that fhe whole Student Body
I was morally bound to stand behind
I the disciplined students. He said
1 that it was a matter of honor and
. principle with the rest of the men to
help out those suspended, that the
Faculty had been given all the
chance possible to do the right and
decent, thing, nnd that It. had com
pletely ignored the apologies of the
Student, Body. He believed a walk-

The filial outcome oi (he Si n<lÂ«>nt Body meeting held on the base
ball diamond this afternoon, which was reached after three hours
of discussion and argument, was that each man who personally de
sired to sign the paper agreeing to withdraw from the University
should do so. The matter was thus made a personal decision ra
ther than a Student Body action. As there were less than two
hundred and tlfty signatures to the petition, it is to be left open
to enable all who wish to do so to affix their names to it. As far
as fhe general situation is concerned, practically nothing was done
at the meeting today to alter it and the Student llody is as much
undecided what action to take as it.was before the meeting. The
only positive action taken by the Student Body was the appoint
ment of a committee to prepare a public statement of the Student
Body attitude in the matter and send it to the newspapers. In case
that two hundred and fifty signers to the petition are secured it is
probable that those members who are in favor of such action will
take out honorable dismissals or leaves of absence. One point
that was brought out by practically every speaker was the fact
that injustice had been done by the Student Affairs Committee.

i out to he the most effective way of
J voicing 1 lie protest and of helping
; (he 41 men. At the conclusion of
j his speech he presented a petition to
to the meeting and made a plea for
everyone to sign it:
The petition follows:
"We the undersigned agree to
withdraw from the University, tak
i
j ing out an honorable dismissal, pro
j viding there are 250 or more sign
! ers of this agreement. We take this
! method of showing our disapproval
1 of the unmerited severity shown by
| the Student Affairs Committee of this
| University in dealing with the men
concerned in the parade of March
12."
.Many Speeches Made.
| Editor Fitch was then called for
j and took much trie same position
!as Fenton. He said that all who
I signed the Student Body petition had
| pledged themselves to support the
'41 men and that this pledge should
: e kept. What was the best way to
stand by the men was a matter of dis
! cussion, but whatever was done the
! students should support the dismiss
ed students to the utmost of their
: power. The students had done every
i thing possible to act in a fair and
I square manner with the Student Af
fairs Committee but without effect.
If an appeal to the President or Trus
tees is believed to be effective, make
such an appeal.
E. A. Cunha, '07, justified the pa
rade on the ground that is was a
proper protest against needlessly
stringent regulations and expressed
the opinion that an appeal to the
Trustees either by means of a large
number of students leaving or by pe
tition would be effective. He said
that the fight was against manifest
injustice and for a principle, and
that this should be made clear to the
world. If there was a walkout the
men should do all in their power
