# DECIDE TO MAKE STRONGEST PROTEST
## Student Body Meeting Results In Agreement To Have All Those Who Wish To Leave Sign Statement 
### 
When the men of the Student
j Body met this afternoon on the
bleachers at. the baseball diamond
there were close to a thousand stu
| dents in the gathering. President
i Murphy took his position on an ele
j vated stand in front, of the bleach
ers and after briefly summarising the
: present situation, called for a free
j discussion of the matter and what
; measures should be adopted to rem
i edy the present difficulty.
I F._ W. Turner, '08, was the first
I speaker and he spoke of the hostile
| attitude toward the students which
; the public has taken and said that
it was due to the fact, that the ac
! coiynts of the trouble which had
I gone out had been biased and he
' moved that a committee be appoint
i ed including H. Fitch, 'OS, and the
j editor of one of the other college
; publications to write a correct ac
j count of the trouble and to send it.
to the newspapers. In this way he
believed that public, opinion would
be won over to the side of the stu
dents. This motion was carried.
President Murphy then briefly out
lined the situation and said that the
principal question before the stu
dents was the advisability of the Stu
dent Body taking out leaves of ab
| sence.
Captain Kenton Speaks.
i The first, man to speak on this
! question was Captain Fenton. He
made a warm appeal for the Student
Body to support in every possible
way the men who were suspended,
saying that fhe whole Student Body
I was morally bound to stand behind
I the disciplined students. He said
1 that it was a matter of honor and
. principle with the rest of the men to
help out those suspended, that the
Faculty had been given all the
chance possible to do the right and
decent, thing, nnd that It. had com
pletely ignored the apologies of the
Student, Body. He believed a walk-

The filial outcome oi (he Si n<l«>nt Body meeting held on the base
ball diamond this afternoon, which was reached after three hours
of discussion and argument, was that each man who personally de
sired to sign the paper agreeing to withdraw from the University
should do so. The matter was thus made a personal decision ra
ther than a Student Body action. As there were less than two
hundred and tlfty signatures to the petition, it is to be left open
to enable all who wish to do so to affix their names to it. As far
as fhe general situation is concerned, practically nothing was done
at the meeting today to alter it and the Student llody is as much
undecided what action to take as it.was before the meeting. The
only positive action taken by the Student Body was the appoint
ment of a committee to prepare a public statement of the Student
Body attitude in the matter and send it to the newspapers. In case
that two hundred and fifty signers to the petition are secured it is
probable that those members who are in favor of such action will
take out honorable dismissals or leaves of absence. One point
that was brought out by practically every speaker was the fact
that injustice had been done by the Student Affairs Committee.

i out to he the most effective way of
J voicing 1 lie protest and of helping
; (he 41 men. At the conclusion of
j his speech he presented a petition to
to the meeting and made a plea for
everyone to sign it:
The petition follows:
"We the undersigned agree to
withdraw from the University, tak
i
j ing out an honorable dismissal, pro
j viding there are 250 or more sign
! ers of this agreement. We take this
! method of showing our disapproval
1 of the unmerited severity shown by
| the Student Affairs Committee of this
| University in dealing with the men
concerned in the parade of March
12."
.Many Speeches Made.
| Editor Fitch was then called for
j and took much trie same position
!as Fenton. He said that all who
I signed the Student Body petition had
| pledged themselves to support the
'41 men and that this pledge should
: e kept. What was the best way to
stand by the men was a matter of dis
! cussion, but whatever was done the
! students should support the dismiss
ed students to the utmost of their
: power. The students had done every
i thing possible to act in a fair and
I square manner with the Student Af
fairs Committee but without effect.
If an appeal to the President or Trus
tees is believed to be effective, make
such an appeal.
E. A. Cunha, '07, justified the pa
rade on the ground that is was a
proper protest against needlessly
stringent regulations and expressed
the opinion that an appeal to the
Trustees either by means of a large
number of students leaving or by pe
tition would be effective. He said
that the fight was against manifest
injustice and for a principle, and
that this should be made clear to the
world. If there was a walkout the
men should do all in their power
to uphold Stanford and to put it right
with public opinion.
C. F. Laumeister, ex-'O7, next
spoke briefly and emphasized the re
marks of previous speakers that
something should be done to correct
the wrong impressions that the pub
lic had received of the trouble here.
Coach Presley strongly urged the
Student Body to stand back of the
41 men, saying that it had led them
to put their standing on the Uni
versity in danger by signing the pe
tition, and by its promise to support
them to the end, and that it was
bound to keep its pledge. In the
matter of leaving the University, he
believed that every man should act
according to his own convictions.
Popular Alumnus Speaks.
Charles R. Lewers, '96, was then
called upon by President Murphy and
was warmly received by the stu
dents. Mr. Lewers was well known
at Stanford during his undergraduate
days and later as a member of the
Faculty of the Law department. He
made a strong appeal for the perpet
uation of the Stanford ideals and
spirit and for conservative action on
the part of the students. He said
that the undergraduates did not real
ize the seriousness of the recent ev
ents at Stanford and the harm which
had come to the University from
them. He believed that the students
should support the 41 men but he
questioned whether a walkout would
be the most, effective way of doing
this. A walkout would not benefit
the men who were suspended, the
University or the men who left and
on the contrary it would cause
very great harm to all concerned.
He considered that an injustice had
been done and that the Faculty had
not met the students in the right
spirit after the frank and manly man
ner in which the Student Body had
acted. In closing he urged the stu
dents to remain at Stanford and do
all they could to better conditions
here, saying, "A walkout will bring
no advantage whatsoever to either
the University, to the 41 men or to
yourselves. It is your duty to re
main at Stanford University and
bend your efforts toward seeing that
the University continues its growth
as in the past."
A. E. Roth, '09, strongly and sensi
bly argued that the students should
remain and try to better conditions
by carrying an appeal to the Trustees.
He said that a disruption of the Stu
dent Body would cause a financial
loss that it would take years to re
coup. That such an action would
jeopardize the future of Stanford, fi
nancially and athletically for years
to come and would, moreover, not
aid the 41 men. Faculty men had
borrowed money on their personal se
curity to aid various student pro
jects and these men would be com
pelled to pay these debts of the Stu
dent Body if the Student Body dis
banded.
R. .T. McFadden said that in the
present trouble the liquor question
played no part, that it was simply a
matter of protesting against a great
injustice. He advised a walkout, say
ing that such an action would be
the best way of supporting the sus
pended men and at the same time the
men would retain their own self
respect.
President Murphy stated that at
first he was in favor of conservative
action but that in view of the dras
tic acrtion of the Student Affairs

Committee he favored some positive
I action. A paper appeal to the Trus
tees would be disregarded, but if
: the most prominent men in the Uni-
I versity left, he believed the Trustees
; would be constrained to take some
j action to remedy the existing con
ditions.
The discussion continued along
j these lines for some time, the out
| come being that a motion was passed
; that all who wished to do so should
j sign the petition which had been pre
sented by Captain Fenton.
Captain Fenton has called a meet
ing of the men who signed the pe
l tition for 9:30 tomorrow morning in
Encina Gymnasium and he is anxious
that all concerned should attend.
Senior Class Meets.
At 11:15 o'clock this morning the
Senior class met and determined to
call off all the usual Senior week fes
tivities and other class functions that
usually take place during Commence
ment week. There was only one fea-
I ture of the usual Senior week cere
monies that the Seniors voted to car
j ry through, namely, the laying of the
class plates. All the regular chair-
I men of the various Senior week com
mittees resigned, and the resignation
of F. A. Curtin, '08, who was to read
the class will, was announced by
President Fenton.
After this decision on the part of
the class there was considerable dis
cussion as to how the money in the
class treasury should be spent, as it
would naturally have been used to
defray the cost of the Senior week
festivities. It was decided that a
committee consisting of President
Fenton, Permanent Secretary Ben
nett, and Treasurer Clark should di
vide what money was left, after the
amounts voted by the class to its per
manent secretary and for sweaters
'■ had been expended, between Train
j er Moulton and Coach Dan Murphy,
because their salaries would be ser
iously affected by the cessation of

! spring athletics.
After some discussion as to wheth
er the class officers should resign, it
was voted that President Fenton and
all the officers should retain their
positions and the class spirit and uni
ty should not be disturbed in spite
of the critical situation at the Uni
versity.
