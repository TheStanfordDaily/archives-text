# POMONAMEET TOMORROW
## VARSITY ATHLETES AGAINST SOUTHERN TEAM. Visitors Have Well Balanced Aggregation With Strong Individual Performers Like Monger. 
### 
The Varsity track team will meet
the athletes from Pomona College
011 the new track tomorrow at 2:00
in the last preliminary meet of the
season. The sontnern aggregation,
consisting of fifteen men, arrived on
the Campus this morning and did
' light training this afternoon.
Judging from the performances in
previous meets the Pomona athletes
will furnish the Stanford team the
best competition that it has received
this year and the score should be
much closer than fn the contests
with the Olympic Club or U. S. C.
The visitors will be handicapped by
lack of sulficient. entries in taking
! more than one place in the major
! ity of events, but this will be particu
larly offset by the fact that two of
the varsity team cannot compete and
that all the Freshmen will be kept
off the track in preparation for the
| intercollegiate freshman meet in Ber
! keley Saturday afternoon.
I In the field the Claremont. ath-
I letes have some Certain point win
ners in Munger, holder of the coast
high jump record at 6 ft., 3 in.; Mer
riam, who clears the bar at 6 ft., 1
in.; Rogers, in the broad, who has
done over 22 feet ;Met.calf, in the
Davenport, good for close to 4 0 feet
in the shot; Munger and Merriam.
capable of doing 11 feet in the pole,
j Hirod, who recently established a
I record of 4:26.4 in the mile, should
; take that event from either Bradford
or Maundrell if he is in form, while
Sweet, can easily win the two-mile
from Leeke unless the Southerner
lowers his time of 10:30. If Miller
runs, he will win both middle dis
tance races, though Sloan did the
quarter in 52.1 last Saturday.
The hundred should furnish a fine
race between Sloan, of Pomona, Reed
and Hoi man, as all three sprinters
have recently done 0:10.1. Holman
J can defeat. Rogers in the 2 20, the
southerner's time being 22.2. Spur
geon, of Pomona, is good for 16 sec
onds in the high hurdles and may
win from Horton, though the Stan
ford entry should capture the 220
hurdles, which Spurgeon is doing in
26 seconds.
The usual officials will serve.
