The result of the Student Body meet
ing this afternoon has left the mat
ter of protest up to the individual
members of the Student Body. This
we believe is right. If a man be
lieves that he can do more good for
the cause of the students who have
been unjustly and too severely dealt
with by leaving, and believes this af
ter personal and careful considera
tion. he may act accordingly. If a
man believes that he can do the Uni
versity more good by leaving and
making his protest against unfairness
and injustice in this way that is a
personal opinion and he should de
cide it personally, without any out
side influence. It is still our firm and
honest belief that the action of the
Student Affairs Committee was too
severe, and that it was manifestly
unfair, unjust, and inconsistent. The
Student Body has used practically ev
ery manner of manly appeal for just
treatment and the committee has
steadfastly ignored our attitude in
the matter. The final decision of
the committee, as announced yester
day, showed that the committee ar
rived at a conclusion that is unjust
in its discrimination and that is far
too severe for the offense commit
ted by the participants in the parade
of March 12.
It is now a matter to decide wheth
er the Student Body can make a fur
ther appeal. We believe that a di
rect appeal should be made to the
President of the University. This we
have a legal right to do according
to the rules of organization of the
University. In addition to this ap
peal, we believe that the present sit
uation, which has brought about such
an extraordinary condition of rela
tions between the students and the
administration, should be brought be
fore the Board of Trustees in a for
mal manner. There may not be any

legal basis for such an appeal, but
it is certainly a case that ought not
be bound by any legal rules of ap
peal. We should make every possi
ble effort to have this matter inves
tigated by the highest authorities of
the University. We have been treat
ed unfairly, unjustly, and too se
verely. Therefore, it is our right to
make an appeal to the two highest
authorities, namely, the President
and the Board of Trustees.
The question of whether the most
effective protest against this injustice
can be made by the men taking out
leaves of absence is a matter for
each individual student to determine.
Whether we can make a stronger and
better fight for our University, our
rights, and our friends by leaving
the University is a matter for each
man to decido independently. We
believe this is the most extreme ac
tion and should not be taken unless
it is the decision of a large number
of the students acting independently
and after serious consideration. Ev
ery loyal man should stand firmly be
hind the 247 students who have been
unjustly tree ted and every man
should continue this protest to the
highest authorities and in the most
effective way.
