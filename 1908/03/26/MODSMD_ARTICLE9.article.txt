### 
The final tryout for the intercolle
giate team which was held in the
University Chapel last night result
ed in the selection of L. Craven, '0 9,
G. D. Ferrell, '09, and J. E. Shelton,
'10, as the men who will represent
Stanford in the annual debate with
the University of California in As
sembly Hall next month. D. C.
Boyd, 'OS, will be the alternate. Pro
fessors Mlllis, Duniway and Huston
were the judges who passed upon the
merit of the contestants in the try
out and T. T. Bennett, '08, presid
ed.
Despite the excitement incident to
the events that have taken place on
the Campus during the past few days,
thirteen debaters participated in the
discussion of the intercollegiate ques
tion, "Resolved, That labor unions
are justified in insisting, through all
lawful means at their disposal, on
the closed shop," and the standard of
their disputation was uniformly good.
For the purposes of the tryout they
were divided into two squads, as
follows: first squad, L. Newland,
'08, F. B. Wood, '10, G. D. Ferrell,
'09, R. J. Miller, '11, J. E. Shelton,
'10, and R. B. Murphy, '08; second
squad, D. C. Boyd, '08, A. Macmillan,
'10, W. E. Hettman, '10, J. W. Gallo
way, '08, C. C. Shoemaker, '10, G. B.
Bush, '09, and L. Craven, '09. The
speeches of Bush, Murphy, Newland
and Galloway were well above the
average and were second only to
those of the successful aspirants for
the team.
Craven in his argument displayed
a very careful preparation of the
subject under discussion, and his
main speech was probably the most
convincing of the evening. His de
livery is direct and forceful. Cra
ven is president of the Nestoria Lit
erary Society and a member of the
President's Conference.
Ferrell maintains a calm and ar
gumentative bearing upon the ros
trum, and his material is arranged
in a logical and impressive manner.
Ferrell was a member of last year's
intercollegiate team and belongs to

the Euphronia Literary Society.
Shelton's debates are marked by
a mastery of the essential points in
volved in the discussion and an un
usually clear presentation of his ar
gument. He is well known as a de
bater here, having been a member
of this year's Carnot team and his
class teams in his Freshman and
Sophomore years. He is a member
of Euphronia.
Boyd, the alternate, has a calm, de
liberate delivery. Like Shelton, he
was a member of this year's Carnot
trio. He belongs to the Nestoria Lit
erary Society.
