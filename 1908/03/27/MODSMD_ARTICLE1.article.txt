# INTERCOLLEGIATE TRACK
## FRESHMAN MEET AT BERKELEY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Cardinal Team Is Crippled Rut Moulton Hopes to Spring Some Surprises. 
### 
The Stanford Freshman track team
will meet the University of Califor
nia first-year athletes on the Ber
keley oval tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 in the annual intercollegiate
Freshman meet. The Stanford team
will leave for Berkeley on the 9:31
train tomorrow morning accompan
ied by Trainer Moulton, varsity
track captain Lanagan and Manager
Knupp.
The Freshnietn do not seem to
have a strong chance of securing the
long end of the score tomorrow,
though there are some individual
stars who will make a showing that
will surprise the California contin
gent. In the middle distances the
team is especially strong but it is
not well balanced and in some events
is very weak. The California team
is, on the other hand, a very well
balanced aggregation, which has con
sistent performers in every, event,
though lacking in star athletes except
Miyin.
Stanford's chances will be mater
ially damaged by the injury or illness
of three of the best men on the
team. Raines is ill with mumps, leav
ing Boyd as the only Cardinal entry
in the hurdles against such fast
men as Donald, Grubb and Eldridge.
Wyman's condition is uncertain, but
even if he is able to compete, it is
not probable that he can run in his
usual form. Thompson is so ill as
to be confined to his bed and will
be unable to run tomorrow, leaving
Porter the task of winning the mile
from Trowbridge and Mahon. The
best race of the day should come in
the half, with Brown of Stanford
and Dowd of U. C. pitted against
each other. Down has done 2:01.4
and will give Brown the race of his
life, though the Cardinal entry is
expected to cross the line first. With
Brown, Wheeler, Taylor, and possi
bly Wyman, in the quarter, Stanford
should take two places. The two
mile is uncertain, but will probably
go to California. Tn the sprints Vilas
and Kretsinger seem to have the
lead in the hundred, while Wyman
or Switherum stand a good chance
of taking the 220.
In the field California is much the
stronger and will annex a large ma
jority of the points, Riving a lead
which the crippled Stanford team
can hardly hope to make up on the
cinder path. Munn and Maddox, of
California, will have no difficulty in
the pole vault, and the same two
will probably place in the hammer.
Munn and Jordan ought to take the
shot from Dole. Meddick ought to
place in the broad and both Waring
and Boyd stand a chance to secure
points in the high. The relay race
is always uncertain and as the teams
will not be selected until the time
of the race the outcome is impos
sible to predict.
The list of entries for the meet to
morrow follows:
