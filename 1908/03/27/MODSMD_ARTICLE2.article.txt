## President Jordan Receives A Committee From San Francisco-Students Decide Not To Leave 
### 
President Jordan's Statement.
"The present difficulty at
Stanford University lias had
its origin in the effort of the
University authorities, Trus
tees and Faculty, to rid the in
stitution of the 'burden and
disgrace of student drunken
ness. 1 The Student Affairs
Committee is the regularly con
stituted disciplinary committee
having charge of these matters
and its actions are in accord
ance with definite instructions
from the Academic Council.
The demonstration of March
12 was an organized expres
sion of revolt primarily against
the committee but actually
against the University itself. It
was necessary that the offense
should lÂ»e met squarely and
definitely. This the committee
lias done, and the University
will continue to carry out its
policy without reference to
opposition or protest.
"It is a matter of regret that
so many line young men have
been drawn into this matter
by a false idea of college spir
it, the undercurrents in the af
fair not appearing on the sur
face and flit- moral issue being
obscured by sympathy for their
fellows."

The most important developments
in the present serious controversy
between the Student Body and the
Student Affairs Committe were the
issuing of an official statement on
the affair by President Jordan, and
the arrival of the committee of San
Francisco alumni upon the Campus.
In regard to organized movement on
the part of the students to leave
the University, it was decided that
no such radical action won.ld- be
taken, as there were not the requis
ite number willing to protest in this
way.
A committee of four prominent
San Francisco alumni, representing
the earlier classes at Stanford, ar
rived on the Campus today for the
purpose of investigating the situa
tion. This committee consists of P.
M. Downing, '95, Dr. A. B. Spauld
ing, '96, C. M. Fiokert, '98, and
L. S. Beedy, '98. Upon arriving on
the Campus the committee visited
President Jordan, who left the Cam
pus this afternoon for Montana, and
secured an interview of some length
with him. As President Jordan ex
pressed it,"The committee of alumni
came to me for the facts of the
case." After discussing the matter
with the President it is the object
of the alumni to interview the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, as well as

a sunitable committee to represent
Student Body opinion.
Chairman A. B. Clark and Pro
fessors A. C. Whitaker, R. E. Swain,
G. C. Price and A. M. Cathcart, of
the Student Affairs Committee are
exhausted after their long delibera
tions, and no more meetings have
been held. However, this afternoon,
the committee of San Francisco-al
umni held a consultation with Chair
man Clark at his home, and it is
probable that the alumni will se
cure the committee's point of view
on its recent action from the chair
man.
Trustee Crother's Statement.
"1 confirmed the statement of W.
C. Shelton that I advised liim, as 1
advised others at Stanford, that there
is no appeal in individual or soc
ial cases to the Trustees.. This was
a mere statement of a fact made in
the hopes expressed at the time, that
the boys would direct all their efforts
toward reconciliation with the Stu
dent .Affairs Committee. Tiie Faculty
is acting under written constitution,
"The Articles of Organization of the
Faculty.' If it is defective, the Trus
tees and Faculty will doubtless be
as anxious to remedy it as any of
you, but in the past the Trustees
have refused to violate it in any in
dividual cases, however important.
As an alumnus, I urge upon you as
men who sincerely believe that you
are right to remain and direct your
efforts toward the accomplishment of
any purpose you may have at heart
in an orderly way, and not to sacri
fice yourselves to no advantage to
any one. The trust constituting the
the charter of the University pro
vides that the rules of discipline
shall be just and equitable. If they
are not, and I do not know any re
spect in which they are not so, the
Trustees are expressly required to see
that they are made so. I refer you
to the articles of organization as to
tin' proper procedure in such a mat
ter."
Alumni Meet in City.
Two hundred alumni, thoroughly
representative of the graduate body
living in San Francisco and vicin
ity, met last night in Jefferson
Square hall and took definite ac
tion looking to an endeavor to bring
about a settlement, of the trouble
at their alma mater.
The meeting was called to order at
8:30 o'clock by Paul M. Downing,
'95, and F. V. T. Lee, '97, was made
permanent chairman and E. R. Zion,
'94, secretary. After a lengthy dis
cussion and expression of opinion by
a score of graduates, the following
resolution, introduced by Louis S.
Beedy, '98, was adopted:
"Whereas, There is a breach be
tween the Faculty and students of
Stanford University; and
"Whereas, We as alumni are inter
ested in the welfare of the Universi
ty and in the promotion of harmon
ious relations between Faculty and
students; now, therefore, be it

"Resolved, That a committee of
four be appointed by the chairman to
consult with the President of the
University, the Committee on Stu
dent Affairs, and a properly consti
tuted committee representing the As
sociated Students."
Several proposed amendments to
this resolution were voted down, and
the sentiment was expressed that
the committee should be given pow
er to take whatever action it deemed
advisable to participate as it might
see fit in case of an appeal to the
President of the University by the
men suspended and to take such
other action as might appear proper
to effect a settlement of the exist
ing controversy.
The committee appointed by Chair
man Lee consists of Louis S. Beedy,
'98, Charles W. Fickert, '98, Dr. A.
B. Spaulding, '96, and Paul M.
Downing, '95. The committee is to
report at another meeting to be held
next Wednesday evening.
Track Men Meet.
At a meeting of the varsity track
squad this afternoon, the men de
cided to keep the team together,
continue regular training and hold
the intercollegiate meet with Cali
fornia regardless of what develops
in the present student situation. This
action was taken at the close of a
spirited session at which the men
agreed to stay with the team and
F. R. Lanagan promised to remain
here and coach tne men in their
training. The committee's action
has resulted in the loss of only two
men.
