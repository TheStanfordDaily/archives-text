The present situation in regard to
the determined protest of the Stu
lent Body against the injustice and
severity of the Student Affairs Com
mittee is in an unsettled condition.
Tn regard to the agreement of the
students who wished to withdraw
from the University it has been de
eded that this extreme line of ac
tion in protest against the unjust
ind harsh treatment would not be
"he most eflective manner of attain
ing their ends. Consequently, there
" vill be no organized withdrawal, the
•nen coming to this agreement after
•onsidering the telegrams received
oday from many alumni clubs and
rom George E. Crothers, an alumnus
ind a member of the Board of Trus
tees. All these telegrams encouraged
the men in their protests, but ad
vised against this partiuclar manner
>112 protest. Although this extreme
action will not be taken, there is no
essation in the spirit of protest that
:s practically unanimous among the
students of the University and we be
lieve that there will be continual
protest in every possible manner un
til redress comes from the authori
ties in regard to the unfair action of
"he Student Affairs Committee.
The President of the University
has issued a statement in regard to
.ho present situation which plainly
shows that he misunderstands the
•>asis of the parade of March 12, as
a result of which the Student Af
fairs Committee took such drastic
ind unjust action. In this state
ment it is asserted that the parade
was an organized protest against
he authority of the University. We
'ertainly deny this assertion and be
ieve that the statements of the men
who were involved in the affair, as
veil as their subsequent manly npol
gies for any breaches of discip
•ine, have disproved any such in
terpretation of the parade. It was
he result of a feeling of protest
• gainst a document issued by the
•student Affairs Committee, and
igainst the method of the commit
tee's procedure in issuing a state
ment. that would naturally be inter
preted as threatening and not cal

eulated to show a sympathetic spir
it of controlling the students. Then
again, the parade was most certain
ly not an organized movement. This
is evident by the sudden way in
which it started and by the charac
| ter of tile men in the affair. We
I unquestionably believe that the Pres
j ident, as well as the Student Af
fairs Committee, has magnified the
importance of the parade and its spi
rit out of all proportion to what it
really amounted to. It was a pro
test; but it was not defiance of au
thority in its spirit or intentions.
Consequently we believe that if the
Student Affairs Committee inflicted
its severe and unjust penalties up
on this basis, the action was cer
tainly unwarranted.
The interest and support shown by
, the alumni in this protest against the
action of the Student Affairs Com
i inittee is sincerely appreciated by the
Student Body .and we believe that
with the wide influence of our strong
alitmni we can expect to have this
affair thoroughly investigated and
the injustice and severity rectified
by the proper authorities.
