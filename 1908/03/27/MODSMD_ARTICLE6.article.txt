Owing to the week of vacation this
will be the last issue of the "Daily
Palo Alto" until Monday, April 6,
when regular university work will
be continued. As this is the last ap
pearance of the "Daily Palo Alto,"
for more than a week, we wish to
urge upon the members of the Stu
dent Body the necessity of support
ing our athletic teams, the Fresh
man track team in their meet at
Berkeley tomorrow, as well as the
Varsity baseball nine in its first in
tercollegiate struggle next Saturday
on the Campus. No matter how de
pressed athletic spirit may have
been during this crisis of the Stu
dent Body, it is our duty to support
our teams, since it has been decided
to hold these intercollegiate ev
ents. We appreciate that these teams,
especially the Freshmen, are going
into the contests somewhat handi
capped in condition and spirit and
this is all the more reason for every
loyal Stanford student showing the
real "Stanford Spirit" and assisting
these men in winning the victories
we sincerely hope they will secure.
