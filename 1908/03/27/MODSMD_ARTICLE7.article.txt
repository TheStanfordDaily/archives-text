# Wyman to Lend Freshmen.
## 
### 
W. M. Wyman, of Santa Barbara,
was elected captain of the Fresh
man track team, by one vote, over
H. Brown, of Pomona, at a meeting
of the team held after the meet this
afternoon. Wyman has been one of
the most consistent athletes on the
squad and has shown steady im
provement since the season began.
He is the best quarter miler on the
team and is a fast 220 man as well.
If he is able to compete, he will
enter these events tomorrow and
probably the hundred and relay as
well. He is a member of the Theta
Delta Chi fraternity and registers in
the Law department.
