# JUNIORS SCORE SUCCESS
## "BUTTERFLY ISLE" PLEASES A CROWDED HOUSE. Singing of Chorus and Specialty Songs by W.P. Fuller, Jr., '10, Bring Applause. 
### 
"Butterfly Isle," the Junior Opera
of the 1909 class, was successfully
staged in Assembly Hall last night
before a well crowded auditorium.
The production, which was one of
the moajt elaborately costumed of
any that have been given here, was
brilliant in scenic effects, and the
work of the chorus was beyond any
doubt the feature of the show. Sel
dom has there been a better group
of local singers. While the individ
uals may have lacked some of the
swing and unity of the professional
performers in the various steps, the
singing was on a par with that of any
regular company.
The work of the principals was
uniform but none of the soloists,
with the exception of W. P. Fuller,
Jr., '10, stood out distinctly. Fuller,
as Jasper, the handy man of the
Shah, made numerous and decided
hits in his songs. "Help Yourself"
and other songs with local lines of
timely interest made his appearance
the signal for prolonged applause.
Miss R. A. Roberts, '09, as Prin
cess Vallie, sang with credit and in
the duets with E. Horner, '09, as
Reggie Van Fleet, harmonized well.
In "Nestle by My Side" she scored
high favor and was ably seconded
by the chorus who were recalled
three times. Winifred and Jimmy,
as taken by Miss E. M. Ingels, '08,
and E. L. Coffin, '11, sang several
numbers successfully. Miss M. E.
Coombe, '11, as 8010, rendered sev
eral catchy songs and proved a val
uable addition to the fun-making.
H. L. Rixford, '09, as Carleton, play
ed the part of an excited and yellow
journalist with an air of realism.
The orchestra, led by Harry James,
who also coached the cast, added a
great deal to the success of the pro
duction.
The cast follows: Reggie Van
Fleet, E. Horner, '09; Jimmy Dyer,
