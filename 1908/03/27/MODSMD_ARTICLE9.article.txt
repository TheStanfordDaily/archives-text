### 
In the week that still remains be
fore the first contest with the Uni
versity of California, the Varsity will
play two games with outside teams.
Next Monday afternoon at 2:30 the
Cardinal will meet the Santa Clara
College nine on the grounds of the

last game of the season with the col
legians. Of the five games that have
thus far been played, the Varsity
has won two and three have been
annexed by Santa Clara. Should the
locals gain a victory on Monday, this
year's series will end in a tie.
On Wednesday afternoon the Var
sity will cross bats with the Phoe
nix nine of St. Mary's College on
the local diamond. This game,
which is to be called at 2:30, is the
sixth and final contest with the Oak

ent. stands exactly the same as the
one with Smnta Clara, three vic
tories being credited to St. Mary's
and two to the locals. In all of these
games the score has been close and
the outlook for an even break in
both series is bright.
The first intercollegiate game will
take place on the Stanford diamond
on April 4, at 2:30. The Stanford
line-up will probably be announced
immediately before the call of "play"
and at present several positions are
still in doubt. A comparative study
of the scores of the games in which
the Varsity and the Blue and Gold
have participated this season would
seem to favor the Cardinal, although
the Californians have a shade in the
hitting department, five of them be
ing over the .300 mark. The ad
mission will be fifty cents.
