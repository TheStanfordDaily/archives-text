# CALIFORNIA WINS MEET
## CARDINAL FRESHMEN LOSE BY SCORE OF 81 2-3 TO 40 1-3. Brown Breaks Intercollegiate Record In Half-Mile, and Wyman Wins Fast Quarter. 
### 
The Freshman track team lost the
intercollegiate freshman meet to Cal
ifornia Saturday by the score of SI
2-3 to 4 0 1-3, in a fast and spectac
ular meet in which eight intercolleg
iate freshman records were beaten
and the varsity time lowered in one
event. Though handicapped by the
loss of two of its best athletes, the
Cardinal team put up a good fight
and, considering the relative number
of entries, made a splendid showing.
Brown was responsible for the fin
est performance of the day, when he
covered the half-mile in 1:59.4, win
ning from Dowd, the speedy Califor
nia Freshman, by over ten yards and
lowering the intercollegiate record b.\
two-fifths of a second. Lee ran a
game race in this event and took
third from a large field of Blue and
Gold entries. Captain Wyman, run
ning with his foot tightly bound,
t lipped 2 2-5 seconds off the fresh
man record in the quarter which he
won from Harlowe of California,
with Wheeler fighting hard to get
third place from Fiske and Calkins.
Contrary to expectations, Stanford
won both sprints, Smitherum taking
the hundred from Vilas in 10.3 and
Towne securing first in the 220 from
Truxaw in 24.
Porter made a hard fight in the
mile but did not have sprint enough
to catch up with Boydson in the fin
al hundred yards when the Califor
nia runner sprinted across the line
in 4:38.4. Bevier took second place
in the two-mile, and should have
won had not Thompson, of Califor
nia, been inadvertently paced on the
last lap. Grubb and Donald, of Cal
ifornia, took the firsts in the hur
dles, Boyd securing second in the
high and third in the low hurdles.
In the field, Munn, of California,
the individual star of the meet, took
every first place, breaking the fresh
man records in all but the high
jump. Meddick took second in the
broad, with a leap of 2 1 feet (5 3-4
inches, three inches better than the
former freshman record. Waring
took three points in the pole, at 1 I
feet 7-8 inch, Barneson taking third
place. Waring also tied for second
place in the high jump with Douglas
and Evers of California, clearing the
bar at 5 feet. 6 3-4 inches.
The relay was somewhat of a dis
appointment, as neither Brown nor
Porter was in condition to enter.
When Wyman started in the last lap
California had a lead of almost for
ty yards, which was too much to be
overcome, though Wyman cut the
distance down to fifteen yards in a
wonderful sprint.

intercollegiate freshman meet to Cal
ifornia Saturday by the score of SI
2-3 to 4 0 1-3, in a fast and spectac
ular meet in which eight intercolleg
iate freshman records were beaten
and the varsity time lowered in one
event. Though handicapped by the
loss of two of its best athletes, the
Cardinal team put up a good fight
and, considering the relative number
of entries, made a splendid showing.
Brown was responsible for the fin
est performance of the day, when he
covered the half-mile in 1:59.4, win
ning from Dowd, the speedy Califor
nia Freshman, by over ten yards and
lowering the intercollegiate record b.\
two-fifths of a second. Lee ran a
game race in this event and took
third from a large field of Blue and
Gold entries. Captain Wyman, run
ning with his foot tightly bound,
t lipped 2 2-5 seconds off the fresh
man record in the quarter which he
won from Harlowe of California,
with Wheeler fighting hard to get
third place from Fiske and Calkins.
Contrary to expectations, Stanford
won both sprints, Smitherum taking
the hundred from Vilas in 10.3 and
Towne securing first in the 220 from
Truxaw in 24.
Porter made a hard fight in the
mile but did not have sprint enough
to catch up with Boydson in the fin
al hundred yards when the Califor
nia runner sprinted across the line
in 4:38.4. Bevier took second place
in the two-mile, and should have
won had not Thompson, of Califor
nia, been inadvertently paced on the
last lap. Grubb and Donald, of Cal
ifornia, took the firsts in the hur
dles, Boyd securing second in the
high and third in the low hurdles.
In the field, Munn, of California,
the individual star of the meet, took
every first place, breaking the fresh
man records in all but the high
jump. Meddick took second in the
broad, with a leap of 2 1 feet (5 3-4
inches, three inches better than the
former freshman record. Waring
took three points in the pole, at 1 I
feet 7-8 inch, Barneson taking third
place. Waring also tied for second
place in the high jump with Douglas
and Evers of California, clearing the
bar at 5 feet. 6 3-4 inches.
The relay was somewhat of a dis
appointment, as neither Brown nor
Porter was in condition to enter.
When Wyman started in the last lap
California had a lead of almost for
ty yards, which was too much to be
overcome, though Wyman cut the
distance down to fifteen yards in a
wonderful sprint.
