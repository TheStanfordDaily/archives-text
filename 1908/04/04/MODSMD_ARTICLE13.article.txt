Eighty-seven notices were sent out
by the Public Health Committee of
j the University to students who did
not live up to the requirements set
forth by Dr. Snow, to prevent the
spreading of smallpox. Of these
| eighty-seven persons notified, many
have appeared before the committee
, and straightened out their misun
derstanding. It is understood that
these notices do not announce that
the person so affected by the require
ments of the committee are sus
pended, nor that they are required
|to cancel their registration. It is
merely required that the person so
dealt with should refrain from at

the period of ten days.
