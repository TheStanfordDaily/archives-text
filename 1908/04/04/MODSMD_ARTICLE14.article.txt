# Estimate Junior Finances.
## 
### 
T. R. Cadwalader, chairman of the
Junior Prom. Committee, stated to
day that he expected the class would
come out about even on the finances
of the dance. The Prom, committee
lias not. yet closed its accounts to
balance the receipts from the 124
tickets which were sold.
All bills for the Junior Opera have
not been received by the opera com
mittee, so that Chairman Roberts at
present cannot give an accurate state
ment. of the committee's accounts. Al
though the house was not as large as
was first expected, Roberts said this
morning that there would probably
be a profit to the class of more than
a. hundred dollars.
