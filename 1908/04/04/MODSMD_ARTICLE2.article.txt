# Stanford Nine Wins First Game
## California Defeated By Captain Fenton's Team In Exciting Contest On Cardinal Diamond. 
### 
Battered as it was through the
loss of Shortstop Sampson, Captain
Kenton's nine of Cardinal ball tos
sers this afternoon wrested victory
from the Hlue and Gold team in the
first game of the intercollegiate base
hall series of 190 S. The final score
of 2 to 1 truthfully bespeaks the
closeness of the contest, the result
of which was a matter ot' conjecture
from the moment Third Baseman
Smith stepped up to the plate short
ly before 3 o'clock until Solinsky,
the last batter to face Pitcher Theile,
was retired at first. Not for an in
stant did the interest wane, and al
though at times the playing became
somewhat ragged, this defect was
more than atoned for by the excite
ment attendant upon the close score.
Before many innings had passed, it
was evident that the outcome of the
match would depend largely upon
the opposing twirlers, both of whom
proved remarkably effective. But
four safe hits none for extra bases
were registered against each pitch
er, and these were kept well scatter
ed. Careless errors were responsi
ble for California's only tally, and
for the Cardinal's second score,
while Jordan's wildness on the first
ball pitched started the runner who
first, completed the circuit for Stan
ford. The strike-outs and bases on
balls were almost evenly divided be
tween the two pitchers, to neither of
whom a wild pitch is credited. Glan
cing at the records in their entirety,
it appears that the twirling honors
were practically on a par.
The scoring began in the initial
period. Scott, the first Cardinal bat
ter, was hit, and then stole second,
advancing another bag on Owen's
out. Amid deafening cheers from the
Stanford rooters, Captain Kenton
stepped to tin 1 plate. On the first
ball pitched by Jordan to the little
veteran, the signal for bunt, and run
was given and Scott started swift 1 >
for home. Kenton negotiated a beau
tiful bunt toward the Blue and Gold
captain, Scott easily reading the
plate.
California was next to tally, but
tin- visitors did not succeed in get
ting a man around the bags until
the seventh inning. Then A. Myers,
reaching second on an error and a
sacrifice, came home when Wirt
dropped Jordan's fly to center, and
the score was tied. Later, in the
Blue and Gold's half of the eighth,
a. California victory seemed immi
nent. With no one out, Lewis and
Reid had reached first and third re
spectively. However, on an attempt
ed double steal, clever throwing by
Owen and Mitchell caught Lewis at
the plate. Reid went out stealing
third, Smith was retired on a field

| er's choice, and the crisis was passed.
The winning tally was gained in
J tlie latter part of the eighth inning,
j Scott was out, and Owen hit cleanly
]to left, and stole second. Fenton
j drove a grounder to Reid, who made
| a had overthrow in attempting to
catch the runner at first, Owen scor
ing from second on the play.
California made a valiant effort to
secure another run in the ninth, but
failed, R. Myers being left on third.
Several times during the progress of
the game the Cardinal team seemed
about to tally again, but between the
first and eighth, no one was success
ful in getting further than third.
Theile was exceptionally steady ear
ly in the match, as only sixteen bat
ters faced him in the first five in
nings of play, and not a single safety
was obtained off his delivery during
those periods.
As for tbe individual players, Fen
ton, of course, put up a reliable game
at short, while Owen covered sec
ond like a veteran. Behind the bat,
Mitchell was a. distinct surprise. Nev
er during the preliminary games of
the season has he displayed the ster
j ling ability exhibited this afternoon,
j Tallant's hitting was a feature, two
|of Stanford's four singles coming
| from his bat.
VV. T. Reid, Jr., of Belmont, and
I King Brady, of St. Mary's, umpired
and gave entire satisfaction in every
i detail.

the last batter to face Pitcher Theile,
was retired at first. Not for an in
stant did the interest wane, and al
though at times the playing became
somewhat ragged, this defect was
more than atoned for by the excite
ment attendant upon the close score.
Before many innings had passed, it
was evident that the outcome of the
match would depend largely upon
the opposing twirlers, both of whom
proved remarkably effective. But
four safe hits none for extra bases
were registered against each pitch
er, and these were kept well scatter
ed. Careless errors were responsi
ble for California's only tally, and
for the Cardinal's second score,
while Jordan's wildness on the first
ball pitched started the runner who
first, completed the circuit for Stan
ford. The strike-outs and bases on
balls were almost evenly divided be
tween the two pitchers, to neither of
whom a wild pitch is credited. Glan
cing at the records in their entirety,
it appears that the twirling honors
were practically on a par.
The scoring began in the initial
period. Scott, the first Cardinal bat
ter, was hit, and then stole second,
advancing another bag on Owen's
out. Amid deafening cheers from the
Stanford rooters, Captain Kenton
stepped to tin 1 plate. On the first
ball pitched by Jordan to the little
veteran, the signal for bunt, and run
was given and Scott started swift 1 >
for home. Kenton negotiated a beau
tiful bunt toward the Blue and Gold
captain, Scott easily reading the
plate.
California was next to tally, but
tin- visitors did not succeed in get
ting a man around the bags until
the seventh inning. Then A. Myers,
reaching second on an error and a
sacrifice, came home when Wirt
dropped Jordan's fly to center, and
the score was tied. Later, in the
Blue and Gold's half of the eighth,
a. California victory seemed immi
nent. With no one out, Lewis and
Reid had reached first and third re
spectively. However, on an attempt
ed double steal, clever throwing by
Owen and Mitchell caught Lewis at
the plate. Reid went out stealing
third, Smith was retired on a field

| er's choice, and the crisis was passed.
The winning tally was gained in
J tlie latter part of the eighth inning,
j Scott was out, and Owen hit cleanly
]to left, and stole second. Fenton
j drove a grounder to Reid, who made
| a had overthrow in attempting to
catch the runner at first, Owen scor
ing from second on the play.
California made a valiant effort to
secure another run in the ninth, but
failed, R. Myers being left on third.
Several times during the progress of
the game the Cardinal team seemed
about to tally again, but between the
first and eighth, no one was success
ful in getting further than third.
Theile was exceptionally steady ear
ly in the match, as only sixteen bat
ters faced him in the first five in
nings of play, and not a single safety
was obtained off his delivery during
those periods.
As for tbe individual players, Fen
ton, of course, put up a reliable game
at short, while Owen covered sec
ond like a veteran. Behind the bat,
Mitchell was a. distinct surprise. Nev
er during the preliminary games of
the season has he displayed the ster
