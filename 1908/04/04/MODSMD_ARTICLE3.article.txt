### 
More than a hundred alumni who
reside in San Francisco and vicin
' ity met at .Jefferson Square Hall on
! Wednesday night to receive the re
port of the four men who were ap
pointed to investigate the present sit
uation concerning the suspension of
, forty-one students by the Student Af
j fairs Committee for participation in
; the parade of March 12. This com
mittee, composed of P. .M. Downing,
! '95, Dr. A. B. Spaulding, '9C, C. M.
I Fickert, '98, and L. S. Beedy, '9S,
made a lengthy and impartial report
lin regard to the entire trouble be-
I tween the Strident Body and the Stu
! dent Affairs Committee, and after a
; careful resume of all the facts the
most important conclusion reached is
summed up in the following para
' graph of the report:
"We condemn the action of tlie
Student Affairs Committee and con
sider the penalty inflicted excessive,
'and out of proportion to the offenses
I committed."
Ileedy, 'OS, Brads Report.
When the alumni met in San Fran
cisco Wednesday night, F. V. Kees
ling, '9S, was elected chairman and
he presided throughout the evening.
The meeting opened with the read
ing of the minutes of the previous
meeting of March 2(5, when the com
j mittee of four had been appointed,
and then L. S. Beedy, '9S, appeared
1 before the meeting to read the im
portant report, of the committee who
! had investigated the trouble. The
' report of the committee began with
some references to conditions on the
i Campus under Professor Durand's
committee and stated that, since last
November the situation here had
been perfectly satisfactory. It then
went on to state the cause of the
change in committees and told of
events leading up to the parade of
March 12. The account of the man
ner in which the parade started and
of its general character and what ac
tually occurred, showed that the al
umni committee had made a thor
ough investigation while on the Cam
pus, and the report was absolutely
impartial in dealing with the actions
of the students. After reviewing the
events following the parade the re
port closed with a set of conclusions
and recommendations. The report
was detailed and it required some
time for Chairman Beedy to read the
results of the committee's work, but
he was accorded the most careful at
tention throughout and when he
closed there was unanimous applause.
| A motion was made.to adopt the re
j port of the committee an.l tliis mo
tion passed without a dissenting vote.
! It was further decided to have the re
port sent, to all Stanford clubs
I throughout the country in order that
all Stanford people might know the
exact status of the present serious
i controversy.
I The report of the alumni closed
with the following conclusions:
"That the demonstration was not
a protest against the efforts of the
University authorities to rid the Uni
versity of the disgrace of student
drunkenness; that the sentiment of
the Student Body favors the suppres
sion of drunkenness and disorderly
conduct; that the demonstration was
not organized or premeditated; that
its purposes were to protest against
the chairman of the committee, and
against the ambiguities of the com
mittee's statement.
"Your committee condemns the in
sults offered to Professor Clark and
his family, the method pursued by
the students in protesting against the
statement from the University au
thorities and the action of the stu
dents in attempting to influence and
intimidate the members of the Com
mittee 011 Student Affairs before final
judgment had been rendered. Whe
ther punishment was excessive or not
is a matter concerning which there
may be an honest, difference of opin
ion.
"In the statement of the Student.
Affairs Committee, posted March 21,
there is an implied invitation to the
participants in the parade to apolo
gize, and it was so interpreted by the
students, as was evidenced by their
apology of March 23, hereinabove set
forth. This was not considered by
the Student, Affairs Committee as a
mitigating circumstance in determin
ing their final action.
"In view of these facts we condemn
the action of the Student. Affairs
Committee and consider the penalty
inflicted excessive and out of propor
tion to the offense committed."
Following these conclusions the
alumni committee made three recom
mendations which are as follows:
"(1) That a copy of this report
be sent to the Board of Trustees, the
President of the University, to each
member of the Student Affairs Com
mittee, the President of the Associat
ed Students and to the Executive
Committee of the Alumni Association.
"(2) That, a resolution be adopted
requesting the Committee on Student
Affairs to permit students who desire
to reinstate themselves to do so upon
giving proper assurance of submis
sion to University discipline.
"(:]) That the President's Confer
ence request the Alumni Association
to appoint representatives who shall
be members of that body."
The report was signed by Louis
S. Beedy, chairman; Charles Fiekert,
P. M. Downing and Alfred Baker
Spaulding. This committee was em
powered by the meeting to continue
its work and seek to arrive at some
solution of the present trouble at
Stanford -some course which might
be followed in the future to prevent
a repetition of such a situation as ex
ists here at present. This committee
will report at a meeting of the alum
ni to be held in the near future.

the action of the Student. Affairs
Committee and consider the penalty
inflicted excessive and out of propor
tion to the offense committed."
Following these conclusions the
alumni committee made three recom
mendations which are as follows:
"(1) That a copy of this report
be sent to the Board of Trustees, the
President of the University, to each
member of the Student Affairs Com
mittee, the President of the Associat
ed Students and to the Executive
Committee of the Alumni Association.
"(2) That, a resolution be adopted
requesting the Committee on Student
Affairs to permit students who desire
to reinstate themselves to do so upon
giving proper assurance of submis
sion to University discipline.
"(:]) That the President's Confer
ence request the Alumni Association
to appoint representatives who shall
be members of that body."
The report was signed by Louis
S. Beedy, chairman; Charles Fiekert,
P. M. Downing and Alfred Baker
Spaulding. This committee was em
powered by the meeting to continue
its work and seek to arrive at some
solution of the present trouble at
Stanford -some course which might
be followed in the future to prevent
a repetition of such a situation as ex
ists here at present. This committee
will report at a meeting of the alum
ni to be held in the near future.
More than a hundred alumni who
reside in San Francisco and vicin
' ity met at .Jefferson Square Hall on
! Wednesday night to receive the re
port of the four men who were ap
pointed to investigate the present sit
uation concerning the suspension of
, forty-one students by the Student Af
j fairs Committee for participation in
; the parade of March 12. This com
mittee, composed of P. .M. Downing,
! '95, Dr. A. B. Spaulding, '9C, C. M.
I Fickert, '98, and L. S. Beedy, '9S,
made a lengthy and impartial report
lin regard to the entire trouble be-
I tween the Strident Body and the Stu
! dent Affairs Committee, and after a
; careful resume of all the facts the
most important conclusion reached is
summed up in the following para
' graph of the report:
"We condemn the action of tlie
Student Affairs Committee and con
sider the penalty inflicted excessive,
'and out of proportion to the offenses
I committed."
Ileedy, 'OS, Brads Report.
When the alumni met in San Fran
cisco Wednesday night, F. V. Kees
ling, '9S, was elected chairman and
he presided throughout the evening.
The meeting opened with the read
ing of the minutes of the previous
meeting of March 2(5, when the com
j mittee of four had been appointed,
and then L. S. Beedy, '9S, appeared
1 before the meeting to read the im
portant report, of the committee who
! had investigated the trouble. The
' report of the committee began with
some references to conditions on the
i Campus under Professor Durand's
committee and stated that, since last
November the situation here had
been perfectly satisfactory. It then
went on to state the cause of the
change in committees and told of
events leading up to the parade of
March 12. The account of the man
ner in which the parade started and
of its general character and what ac
tually occurred, showed that the al
umni committee had made a thor
ough investigation while on the Cam
pus, and the report was absolutely
impartial in dealing with the actions
of the students. After reviewing the
events following the parade the re
port closed with a set of conclusions
and recommendations. The report
was detailed and it required some
time for Chairman Beedy to read the
results of the committee's work, but
he was accorded the most careful at
tention throughout and when he
closed there was unanimous applause.
| A motion was made.to adopt the re
j port of the committee an.l tliis mo
tion passed without a dissenting vote.
! It was further decided to have the re
port sent, to all Stanford clubs
I throughout the country in order that
all Stanford people might know the
exact status of the present serious
i controversy.
I The report of the alumni closed
with the following conclusions:
"That the demonstration was not
a protest against the efforts of the
University authorities to rid the Uni
versity of the disgrace of student
drunkenness; that the sentiment of
the Student Body favors the suppres
sion of drunkenness and disorderly
conduct; that the demonstration was
not organized or premeditated; that
its purposes were to protest against
the chairman of the committee, and
against the ambiguities of the com
mittee's statement.
"Your committee condemns the in
sults offered to Professor Clark and
his family, the method pursued by
the students in protesting against the
statement from the University au
thorities and the action of the stu
dents in attempting to influence and
intimidate the members of the Com
mittee 011 Student Affairs before final
judgment had been rendered. Whe
ther punishment was excessive or not
is a matter concerning which there
may be an honest, difference of opin
ion.
"In the statement of the Student.
Affairs Committee, posted March 21,
there is an implied invitation to the
participants in the parade to apolo
gize, and it was so interpreted by the
students, as was evidenced by their
apology of March 23, hereinabove set
forth. This was not considered by
the Student, Affairs Committee as a
mitigating circumstance in determin
ing their final action.
"In view of these facts we condemn
