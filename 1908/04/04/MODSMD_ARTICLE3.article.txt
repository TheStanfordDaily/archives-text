Ileedy, 'OS, Brads Report.
When the alumni met in San Fran
cisco Wednesday night, F. V. Kees
ling, '9S, was elected chairman and
he presided throughout the evening.
The meeting opened with the read
ing of the minutes of the previous
meeting of March 2(5, when the com
j mittee of four had been appointed,
and then L. S. Beedy, '9S, appeared
1 before the meeting to read the im
portant report, of the committee who
! had investigated the trouble. The
' report of the committee began with
some references to conditions on the
i Campus under Professor Durand's
committee and stated that, since last
November the situation here had
been perfectly satisfactory. It then
went on to state the cause of the
change in committees and told of
events leading up to the parade of
March 12. The account of the man
ner in which the parade started and
of its general character and what ac
tually occurred, showed that the al
umni committee had made a thor
ough investigation while on the Cam
pus, and the report was absolutely
impartial in dealing with the actions
of the students. After reviewing the
events following the parade the re
port closed with a set of conclusions
and recommendations. The report
was detailed and it required some
time for Chairman Beedy to read the
results of the committee's work, but
he was accorded the most careful at
tention throughout and when he
closed there was unanimous applause.
| A motion was made.to adopt the re
j port of the committee an.l tliis mo
tion passed without a dissenting vote.

port sent, to all Stanford clubs
I throughout the country in order that
all Stanford people might know the
exact status of the present serious
i controversy.
I The report of the alumni closed
with the following conclusions:
