The report, of the committee of
four San Francisco alumni has been
made public and should cause a
feeling of satisfaction in the Stu
dent Body. Our determined protest
against the severity and inconsist
ency of the Student Affairs Commit
tee has now been approved by a com
mittee of representative graduates in
a report that was unanimously adopt
ed at a large meeting of alumni in
San Francisco last Wednesday night.
This report was compiled by men
who have been out of college for
ten years or more; men who are in
a position to assume an unprejudiced
point of view in considering the pre
sent situation; and it is the result of
a thorough and careful investigation
by these capable men. That such a
committee should agree with us in
condemning the action of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, as excessive
and out of proportion to the offense
committed, certainly adds great
weight to the position we have main
tained ever since the present con
troversy started on March 17 with
the suspension of twelve students for
participation in the parade of March
12.
In its report the alumni commit
tee is impartial and the students are
condemned for certain actions which
did not meet with the approval of
the alumni. However, in its final
conclusions the report plainly states
that the committee, after carefully
considering all the facts relative to
the parade, does not consider it ei
ther an organized demonstration
against university authority nor a
premeditated affair. The report also
states that the demonstration was
not a protest against the efforts of
the university authorities to rid the
University of the burden and dis
grace of student drunkenness. In this
conclusion the committee lnis done

{much toward relieving the men who
have been punished from bearing
the false stigma that may have been
attached to them for their participa
tion in the parade. We sincerely
hope that the alumni report will re
ceive! the same notoriety that has
been accorded other statements
which falsely intimated that the men
involved were in some way support
ing drunkenness. This has been the
worst result of the entire trouble, and
every means possible should be ad
opted in clearing the men involved,
as well as the name of the Univer
sity from this false impression which
has gone abroad. Another strong
point made by the alumni in criti
cising the Student Affairs Commit
tee concerns the apology made by
the men involved in the parade. The
I alumni condemn the Student Affairs
Committee for not considering this
apology as a mitigating circumstance
in their final action. We certainly
agree with the report in this criti
cism.
At this time it is impossible to
comment upon what action the Stu
dent Affairs Committee or the Presi
dent will take in regard to the ap
peal of the alumni. We believe that
some reply will be made to a docu
ment of such fairness and coming
from such sources. It is not the prej
udiced protest of undergraduates, but
the sane results of a careful inves
tigation by mature men and, as such,
it commands attention and consid
eration on the part of the authori
ties.
