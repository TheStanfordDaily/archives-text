# To Have Student Government.
## 
### 
An agitation for student control
of student affairs is being made at
Kansas University. Although the in
itiative has been taken by the stu
dents, the faculty favors the plan,
recommending it as the only solution
of many university problems. Stu
dent representation on all universi
ty committees and a student coun
cil are probabilities of the near fu
ture at Kansas.
