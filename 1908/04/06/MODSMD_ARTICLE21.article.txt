# WORK DURING VACATION
## BAD WEATHER KEEPS CREW MEN FROM MUCH TRAINING. Part of Last Week Is Spent at the Quarters at Redwood City.â€”No Boat in Use on Lake. 
### 
A number of the men oil the row
ing squad, including Freshmen and
the older candidates for the crew,
spent a great part of the past week
at the training quarters in Redwood
City, but were not able to putin
much time on the water, owing to
the high winds which caused rough
water on the bay. Because of this
high wind during the greater part
of the week, the men were unable to
use the shell, and spent their time
in working on the boat and talking
over rowing affairs.
Besides being prevented from do
ing work on the water, the oarsmen
broke two oar-locks on the eight,
which put the boat out of commis
sion. Two oar-locks have been re
moved from the four-oared barge
which is at Lagunita. These have
been placed in the eight-oared shell.
Two new oar-locks are being cast
so that the barge can be refitted, but
will not be ready for several days.
With the barge out of use, there
is at present no boat in which the
oarsmen can train on Lagunita, as
the four-oared shell was removed to
Redwood City shortly after Junior
Day. The absence of boats which can
be used on the lake deranges all the
schedules which Coach Turner had
arranged for extra time to be putin
by the crew men. Until the barge
is refitted, the men cannot get on
the water except at Redwood. The
time which was counted on before
breakfast and in the morning as al
lowing extra work cannot now be fig
ured in.
The bad rowing weather which
has prevailed lately demonstrates the
fact that a regatta on April 11 would
not be a success. Saturday morning,
April 25, which has been set for the
regatta, will probably furnish smooth
water for the intercollegiate races.
The officials have not all be chosen,
but a list will probably be completed
within a few days.
