# PRESIDENTS ARE ALUMNI.
## Nearly all Chief Executives and all Present Candidates Are College Graduates. 
### 
A recent editorial in the Cornell
"Sun" comments upon the fact that
all the prominent presidential candi
dates this year are college gradu
ates. This is in harmony with the
fact that a large majority of our
presidents have also been alumni.
The "Sun" continues as follows:
"The men who are considered pro
i minent presidential candidates this
year are Governor Hughes, Secretary
Taft, Senator Foraker, Senator Knox,
Vice-president Fairbanks, Senator La
Follette and Secretary Cortelyou on
the Republican side, and William
Jennings Bryan, Judge Gray, .ludge
Harmon, Senator Culbertson and
President Woodrow Wilson, of
Princeton, on the Democratic side of
tlie political arena. And hence, if any
of these men are elected to the office
of the chief executive, history will
be but repeating itself.
"Harvard and William and Mary
Universities have each graduated
three presidents, and Princeton has
two to her credit, if ex-President
Grover Cleveland can be counted as
an adopted son, though he was nev
er an undergraduate there. Hamp
den-Sidnev, the University of North
Carolina, Bowdoin, Dickinson, West
Point, Kenyon, Williams, Union, and
Miami, each can boast of one presi
dent.
"The presidents who were not col
lege men include some of the most
famous names in our history, des
pite their minority in numbers. They
1 are Washington, Jackson, Van Bu
ren, Taylor, Fillmore, Lincoln, John
son, Cleveland and McKinley. The
