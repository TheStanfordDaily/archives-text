# ATHLETES IN GOOD FORM
## WORK OF PAST WEEK SHOWS MARKED IMPROVEMENT. Interclass Meet Next Wednesday Afternoon.â€”Twenty-Four Men on Training Table. 
### 
The week of vacation has resulted
in a noticeable improvement in the
condition of the men 011 the track
squad and it seems probable at pres
ent that every man will be in condi
tion to enter the intercollegiate meet
011 April 18. The athletes spent con
siderable time on the track each
day and the regular training has
resulted in developing better form
than lias been heretofore shown.
Those who were on the crippled list
at the beginning of the holidays are
nearly all recovering rapidly and will
soon be running as well as ever.
Reed and Coonan are still doing light
work to prevent a second injury to
their weakened ligaments, but a few
more days will enable them to be
gin hard training. Holman has been j
troubled with a slight case of blood
poisoning in his foot, but his recov
ery is almost complete.
Captain Lanagan has set. Wednes
day afternoon, April S. as the date
of the interclass meet at which only
those who have been training will
be allowed to compete. The men on
the varsity squad will be run in the
events in which it is planned to en
ter them in the intercollegiate meet.
On account of the short time before
the contest with California, the inter
class meet will be largely used as a
basis for deciding the personnel of
the team, and the events in which
the various athletes will be entered.
Perhaps the most noteworthy per
formance of the past week has been
in the broad jump where both Van
dervoort and Meddick have improved
their form until they are consistent
ly jumping better than any previous
performance this season. Trainer
Moulton is much pleased with the
work of these two men and spends
considerable time each day in de
veloping their form.
The addition of the new coat of
cinders to the track has put the path
in fine shape and after this last coat
of cinders has settled the track will
be faster than ever. "Dad" has had
a few trials run nearly every after
noon and though he gives out 110
time, the results seem to be highly
satisfactory. The training table was
started last Monday with twenty
members, and has now been increas
ed to twenty-four. This number will
be further increased as performances
justify, the next addition probably!
coming after the interclass meet.
