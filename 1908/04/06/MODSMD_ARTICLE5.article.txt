## DR. JORDAN ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. Stanford May Be Changed Into Graduate School on Pattern of German Universities. 
### 
While lecturing in Spokane last |
week Dr. Jordan made the following
statement:
"Within live years we expect to
have only Juniors and Seniors at
Stanford University, ft will be a place
for only those who have a definite
object in pursuing a university |
course, and not for those who are
merely gathering up the odds and ;
ends of an education.
"Stanford has passed the stage'
where it can afford to devote so 1
much of its efforts to the training ;
period. Within five years we must 1
expect an elimination of the fresh- 1
man and sophomore classes. That ;
is not the work of a real university; j
it is for the preparatory schools. The
man with a definite aim in pursuing j
bis college work is the man who is :
wanted at Stanford.
"We are working on that plan
now. We have just, succeeded in de- !
veloping a fine law school. We have I
made arrangements for the Cooper
Medical College as the property of
Stanford and with it will come the j
Lane Hospital. That completes two
leading departments and we will be
ready when the time comes to turn
out. fine, strong, specialized men aiul
women to do real work in the world."
This statement marks the first,
public announcement of a step which â– 
Dr. Jordan and the university an- j
thorities have been considering for
several years. Dr. Stillman, who is
just now acting president, says:
"President Jordan's idea has been ;
under consideration for some time,
but thus far it has not reached the j
stage of discussion. Dr. Jordan has
been conferring with prominent edu
cators throughout, the country, get- I
ting their ideas 011 his project, but i
lie steps have yet been taken to pre
sent the scheme to either the Faculty
or the Trustees. When that formal
move will be taken is uncertain.
"Stanford University is working un
der a. charter, which provides no set
rules governing the exact nature of
the institution. In fact, it. is strict
ly within the province of the board
to make out of Stanford any kind of
a university that they see fit. Noth
ing prevents the Trustees from mak
ing a change even more radical than
the one suggested by Dr. Jordan.
"Should Stanford become a grad
uate school the standards of the in
stitution would be raised tremen
dously. The high school requirements
would be made more stringent, and
those students who matriculate j
would be older and better prepared j
than those who now enter the in- j
stitution. The class of work perform- i
ed at the University would, as Dr. !
Jordan says, be much higher than J
that, which is possible under the ex- 1
isting rules."
If the plan is adopted, it would
probably mean that the high schools |
of the state would enlarge their |
curriculums to cover the first two
