series between the Stanford and San
ta Clara nines will be played on the
Campus diamond tomorrow after
noon, beginning at :5: :i0 o'clock. Of
the six matches already decided, the
Cardinal has annexed but two. How
ever, with Theile and Mitchell, the
victorious battery, officiating on the
slab and behind the bat on Tuesday,
Coach Presley's team will endeavor
to reduce the collegians' lead in the
matter of winning games. As usu
al, Kilburn will be the visiting pitch
er. Should the second intercol
legiate contest between the Cardinal
and the Blue and Gold, scheduled to
take place on the California diamond
next Saturday, result in a score fav

Campus this season.
Of the nine men who comprised the
Cardinal team in the first game with
California, only one, E. P. Tallant,
'09, won a varsity "S" for the first
time. Although the match Saturday
was Ganong and Mitchell's initial ex
perience in intercollegiate baseball,
both of these athletes secured an
"S" during the Rugby season of
1907.
