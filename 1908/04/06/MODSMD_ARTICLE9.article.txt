The members of the Student Af
fairs Committee and the President
of the University have not yet re
ceived copies of the report of the
committee of San Francisco alumni
in regard to the recent action of the
Student Affairs Committee, but this
report is expected to reach the uni
versity authorities tomorrow morn
ing. Although th- report may not
develop any new facts in regard to
the actual happenings during the pa
rade of March 12, it certainly does
state that the alumni do not believe
it to have been a demonstration
against university authority or a pa
rade in any way connected with
drunkenness. After carefully review
ing all the facts of the case, the re
port states that the alumni believe
the penalty inflicted by the Student
Affairs Committee, in suspending
forty-one students, was excessive and
out of proportion to the offense com
mitted . Wo believe that such a
conclusion on the part of four ca
pable alumni, representing the ear
lier classes which graduated from
the University, is worthy of serious
consideration on the part of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee. That ma
ture graduates, who have investigat
ed the affair from an unprejudiced
point of view, should arrive at such
a conclusion surely justifies our po
sition in protesting against the ac
tion of the Student Affairs Commit
tee. The alumni report also states
that the demonstration was neither
organized nor premeditated, which
is a conclusion we have always held.
In this regard it appears that the
Student Affairs Committee in taking
its severe action must have consid
ered the parade as an organized af
fair, and the contrary opinion as
stated by the alumni committee,
should have great weight with the
members of Chairman Clark's com

mittee. A further cause for the con
demnation of the action of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee by the alum
ni lies in the fact that the commit
tee did not consider the apology of
the paraders as a mitigating circum
stance in rendering their final judg
ment. We certainly believe that this
apology should have had great influ
ence in determining the committee's
action.
In view of these strong points that
are brought out by the alumni re
port, we feel that the Student Af
fairs Committee will undoubtedly
take some official cognizance of the
report as soon as it is received, and
we hope that some action will be tak
en at once toward the reinstatement
of the forty-one suspended students.
