# INTERCLASS MEET CLOSE
## SENIORS SEEM TO HAVE SLIGHT ADVANTAGE. Wyman and Brown Will Compete in the Quarter.â€”Miller Will Not Run. 
### 
The interolnss track meet will be
liehl tomorrow afternoon at 4:00
o'clock, and from present indications
it appears that the contest will he
close and the results uncertain, ow
ing to the temporary crippled condi
tion of several of the most promin
ent athletes, which will upset the
previous calculations as to the out
come. Any advantage which may exist
seems to he in favor of the Seniors,
who will, however, lose a heavy
point winner in J. O. Miller, '08, who
will he unable to compete, though he
is again able to walk after using
crutches since the Pomona meet. The
Seniors stand a good chance of tak
ing nine points in the shot which will
give them a lead hard to overcome
in the even competition of the other
events.. Vandervoort should win five
points for 1908 in the broad, Ster
ling has a chance to take second in
the high, Kocher may place in the
pole vault, and Tomasini will take
a place in the hammer. On the track
the Seniors will annex several more
points in the hurdles with Horton
and Morris, while Nash in the two
mile, Severy in the mile, Cook in
the half, and McGregor in the quar
ter are all likely point winners.
Holraan will not enter the sprints,
and it is not improbable that Reed
will also be kept out of the meet,
though he is improving rapidly and
may be in condition to run. In
case neither of these men are enter
ed, the sprints will probably go to
W. H. Gardner, '09, who is running
in fine form. Wyman and Brown
will be matched against each other
in the quarter which should prove
the fastest race of the day, as these
men will be instructed to light each
other to the finish in order to deter
mine the entries for the intercolleg
iate meet, where the Cardinal run
ners will be entered against the
speedy Captain Stanton, who is cred
ited with 50.3 in his last race.
It is uncertain whether or not
Brown will also run in the SBO,
which will contain such entries as
Maundrell, Cook, Lee and Hemphill.
Bradford will run the mile, compet
ing against Porter, and Severy and
McGregor. Sweet, Nash and Adams
appear to have the places in the two
mile without serious opposition. The
hurdle entries include Horton, Mor
ris, Peaslee, Gregg and Boyd.
In the field Martin should take the
high jump, Youker the hammer, Bel
lah the pole, Horton the shot and
either Vandervoort or Meddick the
broad.
The relay race seems likely to go
to the Freshmen, who will have a
fast team chosen from Brown, Wy
man, Porter, Taylor, Wheeler and
Lee, while the other classes will
have no little difficulty In getting a
team to enter in the race.
The usual officials will be in
charge of the meet, F. R. Lanagan,
'08, acting as starter.
