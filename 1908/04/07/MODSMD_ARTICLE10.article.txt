# One More Smallpox Case.
## 
### 
When interviewed today, Dr. W.
F. Snow gave out the following offi
cial statement in regard to the most
recent smallpox case:
"Three cases have thus far devel
oped but inasmuch as the majority
of students have been successfully
vaccinated within the past two weeks,
there is no probability of additional
cases."
The Students' Guild today estab
lished an isolation hospital in or
der to provide for an additional case
of smallpox. The patient was re
moved from Encina Hall this after
noon and the rooms involved were
disinfected.
