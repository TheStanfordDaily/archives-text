# THE
						PRESIDENT'S PLAN
## DR. JORDAN RELIEVES THAT UNIVERSITY WILL CHANGE. Favors an Institution in Which Men Will Enter Prepared for Definite Work. 
### 
In President, Jordan's annual re
port to the Trustees, which will ap
pear in the near future, he writes
at length in regard to the proposed
change in the university course,
which would eliminate the two lower
classes. His remarks contain a gen
eral summary of the present condi
tions in American universities, and
then goes on to relate the tenden
cies of English and German univer
sities. Tho President then states
that there is a tendency in America
to separate the college into two parts,
the junior college, of two parts, and
the university college, in which the
university work begins.
President Jordan writes in part: "It
is safe to prophesy that before many
years the Amertcau universities will
abandon their junior colleges, rel
egating it to the college on one hand,
and to the graduate courses of the
secondary schools on the other." In
an interview today the President
stated that he believed such a change
would be practical in this state with
in five years, as the courses in some
of the high schools were already con
forming to such a plan. His report
to the Trustees continues further as
follows:
"Thus far Stanford University has
been a large college, well ordered
for the most part, giving good in
struction and with the highest colleg
iate standards. Its university work,
though not extensive, has justly com
manded respect.
The present condition of the Uni
versity does not represent the orig
inal aim of the founders nor the ideal
of the President. It has been the
necessary result of limitation of
funds, the long delay of litigation,
and the final settlement of the es
tate, and the recent unwelcome dis
turbance oi the earthquake.
The elimination of these factors
makes it. necessary to look forward
to the future. Is Stanford University
to be a college or a university, or a
compound of both? In my judgment
the last cannot be a permanent condi
tion in any of our large institutions.
Collegiate instruction is relatively
cheap. It is given well in upwards
of two hundred institutions in Am
erica, and more or less badly in
aB many more.
University work on a large scale
is expensive. If properly undertak
en, it is the choice privilege of the
few institutions that are generously
endowed, or that are the.education
al pride of wealthy states.
Among these Stanford University
must stand. Its great endowment
was given for that purpose, and its

freedom from outside control enables
| it to undertake lines of work, and
long-continued series of investigation,
I efforts of the highest intellectual type,
which would not find support in pub
lic institutions with their natural ten
dency towards the demanding of im
! mediate results.
In 1592 Governor Stanford said re
peatedly that he wanted this insti
tution to combine the technical work
of Cornell University with the high
! est post-graduate work or work of
investigation, at thai time represent
ed by Johns Hopkins University;
that he wished it to be a university
|in the highest sense, "beginning,"
j to use his own words, "where the
I state university leaves off." I may
! say in passing that at that time the
; University of California was chiefly
an undergraduate college. In its
; present expansion, it. has largely be
gun where it then "left off," and we
; may admit that it has already gone
much further in the realization of
j the ideals of Governor Stanford than
Stanford University has gone. But
; we have time before us, and most
i things are possible with time and
j patience.
To make a university, in the world
! sense, of Stanford University the fol
lowing elements seem to me essen
j tial:
The elimination, as soon as possi
ble —let us say in the course of five
years—of the junior college, by the
addition of two years to the entrance
requirements. This need not neces
jsarily raise the requirements for the
j bachelor's degree which would then
I be, as now, two years of approved
[ university work beyond the work of
, tho junior college. These require
ments are high enough. There is
| much to be said in favor of lowering
them to the level of completion of
the junior college course. This would
! correspond to the bachelor's degree
| of twenty to thirty years ago.
With this should follow the exten
| sion of the university as such and
the intensification of the higher
work. Especially medicine should be
I added to its scope of instruction, and
other lines of advanced work would
! naturally follow if the University
i were relieved from the burden of ele
i mentary instruction —of work which
I is done more or less well in every
j part of the country.
It will also be necessary to provide
; means for fellowships and scholar-
I ships. The present writer has been
strongly opposed to the present fel
lowship system in America, believ
ing that its evil of hiring men to
study in a certain place often out
weighs its advantage of furnishing
promising men with means of mak-
I ing the most of their period of train
ing. But in a matter of this kind
it is not possible for a single insti
tution to stand aloof from its asso
ciates, and to demand an adequate
i return in laboratory or other assist
ance from each fellow will tend to
! minimize the evils of the system."
