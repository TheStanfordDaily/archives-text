# Report of the Alumni Received
## Copies of the Document Are Now In Hands of the President and the Student Affairs Committee 
### 
Several copies of the alumni re
port, as composed by the alumni com
mittee consisting of P. M. Downing,
'95, Dr. A. 13. Spaulding, '96, C. M.
Fickert, '98, and L. S. Beedy, '98,
reached the Campus this morning
and have been received by the Pres
ident of the University, the members
of ihe Student Affairs Committee,
and the President of the Student
Body. There has been no official ac
tion taken in regard to this report,
and it is difficult to predict just
what effect the efforts of the alumni
will have. However, the report is
most complete and practically the
only point in which it has erred is
in regard to the resignation of Pro
fessor Durand's committee. The al
umni report in relating the events
preceding the resignation of the for
mer committee makes it appear that
their resignation followed the pass
ing of the resolution by the Aca
demic Council, whereas the Durand
committee really resigned before this
resolution had been passed. The an
nouncement. of their resignation was
not made public until several days
after it actually occurred.
President Jordan Returns.
President Jordan returned to the
Campus today from a ten-days trip
to Montana and the Northwest. He
went to Montana to fulfill an engage
ment made last December to speak
before the Teachers' Association of
Missoula, Mont. During his stay Dr.
Jordan delivered five addresses,
speaking at Helena, Bozeman, Bill
ings and Missoula, Montana, and Spo
kane, Washington.
Since President Jordan has arrived
on the Campus lie has been occupied
with his correspondence, which ac
cumulated during his absence, and
he has not yet read the report of
the San Francisco alumni in regard
to the action of the Student Affairs
Committee. The President stated
that he would give the report his ser
ious consideration as soon as possi
ble.
Chairman Clark's Statement.
Professor A. B. Clark, chairman of
the Committee on Student Affairs,
was this morning in receipt of a
copy of the report of the committee of
the San Francisco Alumni Associa
tion, dealing with the recent suspen
sion from the University of forty
one upper classmen. Upon being ask
what attention would probably be
given the document by his commit
tee, Professor Clark replied: "I have
only now received the report, and,
consequently, have nothing to say
concerning it. However, at present,
1 do not contemplate any action by
the committee as a result of it, and,
furthermore, I do not at present con
template a meeting of the committee
to consider it."
Account of Parade.
In commenting on the parade of
March 12, the report of the alumni
committee says:"In the evening of

Thursday, the 12th day of March,
a so-called parade, composed of sev
eral hundred students, took place on
the Campus. This parade started in
tlie Row, crossed from there to En
cina Hall, proceeded through the
club room and down the road to the
residence of the chairman of the
Committee on Student Affairs.
"Tlie parade started by shouts of
'parade' in one of the houses, answer
ed by similar shouts from others,
following by the assembling of the
students from the various fraterni
ties, clubs, and lodging houses on the
Row. There is no evidence that this
parade was premeditated, or that it
started as a result of organized effort
on the part of anyone. It was whol
ly spontaeous, and was participated
in principally by students residing on
the Row and in Encina Hall, and
was composed of all classes of stu
dents. In ibis parade the students
played musical instruments, shot, fire
arms, sang songs and made the usual
noises that have characterized similar
previous demonstrations. The shoot
ing ceased before the parade arrived
at the residence of Professor Clark.
Upon arrival there the students in
vaded his premises, singing and
shouting. Mrs. Clark appeared upon
the veranda of the residence, and
stated that Mr. Clark was not at
home, whereupon derisive remarks,
hooting and expressions of disap
pointment were made. These insults,
however, were made by individuals
and were disapproved by the students
generally, their disapproval being
manifested by hisses, and statements
of 'key down' and shut up.' Mrs
Clark re-entered the house, the stu
dents remaining on the premises
singing and continuing the disturb
ance. Within a few moments she
reappeared, again stated that Pro
fessor Clark was not at home, could
not be reached by telephone, and re
quested that they leave the premises.
The parade then proceeded to the
Quadrangle, entered the University
Library and from there marched into
the Memorial Court, where the state
ment of the committee, received that
day, was read amid shouts of deris
ion and expressions of disapproval.
After its reading, the parade dis
persed.
"Your committee finds that this
demonstration did not differ in its
essential details from similar demon
strations held prior to this upon the
Campus, against which no statement
had been made by the Faculty au
thorities charged with the duty of ad
ministering discipline.
Causes of the Parade.
"Various reasons have been given '
as to the purposes of this so-called |
parade. Different participants be-J
lieved that it had different, purposes, j
Some that it was a protest against J
the statement of the Committee on
Student Affairs, because of its am
