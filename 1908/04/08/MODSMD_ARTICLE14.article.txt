# Changes in Blue and Gold Line-Up.
## 
### 
When the California nine goes on
the diamond next Saturday to meet
the Cardinal team in the second
game of the intercollegiate series,
two changes in the line-up will be
noted. Second-baseman Reid will be
replaced by Butler in the infield,
while center field will be filled by
either Reid or Earnist.
