According to an article in the
"Cardinal," daily paper of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, that university
will be invited to participate in a
regatta, to he held in Seattle during
the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific exposition
next, summer. The invitation will
come from the University of Wash
ington. Stanford, California, and
some athletic club in the Northwest
will also be invited to enter.
The information comes from a Wis

crew of his alma mater with those
of the Pacific Coast universities, and
concludes that Wisconsin would have
to exert herself to win in competition
here.
