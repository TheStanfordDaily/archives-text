The Medical department of Michi
gan has invented a machine to test
the speed of batters, and the entire

! the test.
The batter is placed before a
j screen in which are several openings,
j A white disk, in place of a baseball,
jis dropped past one of these, and
j the batter strikes. His bat is so
| connected that the movement breaks
I an electric circuit, and automatical
ly measures the time in fiftieths of
| a second, between the dropping of
