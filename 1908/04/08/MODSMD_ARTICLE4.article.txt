The Seniors won the interclass
meet this afternoon in one of the
highest class competitions that lias
ever been developed in an interclass
contest. Five new records were es
tablished for the Stanford track and
good time made in nearly every ev
ent. The fact that several of the
men entered only one event upset
calculations, but the Seniors early
obtained a lead which they never
lost.
Both llolman and Reed were so
much improved that they were al
lowed to enter the meet, though
llolman confined himself to the hun
dred, both running in excellent form.
The only incident to mar the success j
of the day was an accident to Maun-]
drell in the half when, after run-i
ning well in the lead for three j
fourths of a lap. he was suddenly |
seized with a cramp which caused
him to stumble and put him out of
the race.
Bradford started tlie record break-1
ing by covering the mile in 4:3r». I
taking 4-5 of a second off the timej
made by Maundrell last year. Brad-1
ford ran easily all the way and fin-1
ished fresh, with McGregor a good j
second and Peterson third. Brown |
set a new mark in the quarter by |
running in 50.3, without any com-}
petition in the last part of the race.
Wyman did not enter, second place
going to Hughes. Nash was back
in his old time form in the two
mile and finished with a wonderful
sprint in 10:6.3, lowering his for
mer record by several seconds. Ad
ams hung close to Nash until the
final sprint and demonstrated that
he can cover the distance in 10:1 () or;
better. Sweet fell back in the
eighth lap and did not try for second!
place.
In the field Vandervoort equalled I
the intercollegiate record, held by
Broughton, of California, with a|
jump of 23 feet, 4 1-2 inches J
which Is several inches better than
the Stanford mark. Bellah round
ed off a day of good performances
by clearing 12 feet 2 1-2 inches in
the pole, at the first trial.
Reed had no difficulty in the
sprints, equalling the intercollegiate
record of 10.1 In the hundred, and
running the 220 In 22.4.
Gardner ran a good race In the
220, finishing close to Reed, with
Towne pulling a hard third. Horton
won four first places, taking both

hurdles and the weights. He was in
fine form in the high hurdles, win
ning from Peaslee by a good mar
gin in 16. In the 220-yard hurdles
he was well in the lead all the way.
Gregg had a sure second but fell on
the next to last hurdle, allowing
Morris the place. The half, with
Brown out of the race, developed
some good competition, Severy win
ning by several yards. After run
ning last for a lap, Lee took sec
ond from Hemphill by a hard sprint
down the straightaway.
Martin was not forced in the high
and stopped at 5 feet, 8 inches. Hor
ton took the shot at 43 feet, 5 inches
and also took the hammer from You
ker, who had difficulty in staying in
the ring.
