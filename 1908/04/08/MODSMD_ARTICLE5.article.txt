# NO OFFICIAL ACTION
## STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WILL NOT HOLD SESSION. Alumni Report Will Be Printed and Distributed by Executive Committee. 
### 
After having had ;i day to consid
er the matter, Chairman Clark, of
the Student Affairs Committee,
stated in an interview this after
noon that his committee would noi
meet to give the report of the San
Francisco alumni official considera
tion. Chairman Clark said: "I have
written a personal letter to L. S.
Heedy, '98, chairman of the alumni
committee, acknowledging the re
ceipt of the report made by ills com
mittee. However, the Student Affairs
Committee will not hold an -official
session to consider this alumni re
port." Professor Clark made no
further statements concerning the
report and did not give any intima
tion as to his personal opinion in
regard to the document.
President Jordan has made no offi
cial announcement in regard to his
opinion of the alumni report, which
he received yesterday. It is prob
able that he lias not. yet. bad time
to consider it.
Five hundred copies of ihe re
cent report of the San Francisco
alumni committee have been ordered
printed by the Associated Students
and should be ready for distribu
tion by Friday. These copies are
intended primarily for the use of
those undergraduates who wore dis
ciplined by the Student. Affairs Com
mittee and secondarily to give the
public, in general, a fair and im
partial view of the entire situation.
Should the demand prove greater
than expected an additional number
of copies may be obtained.
At the Student Body meeting on
March 2G it was decided that a thor
ough review of the trouble should
be written and published and a
committee was appointed to com
pile such ii report. Deeming it im
possible to secure a more satisfac
tory account of *he subject than
that contained in the alumni report,
it has been decided to utilize that
for the purposes of the undergradu
ates.
