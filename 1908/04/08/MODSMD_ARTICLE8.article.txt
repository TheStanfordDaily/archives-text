It has been decided to print sev-j
eriil hundred copies of the report
made by the alnmni committee upon
the action of the Student Affairs
Committee in regard to the parade
of March 12. We are heartily in
favor of circulating the alumni re
port and believe that much good can
be accomplished toward clearing the
men involved in the affair from the
stigma of drunkenness that may
have attached to them. As we have
frequently stated, this report of the
alumni is an impartial and carefully
prepared statement of the entire af
fair. Tt condemns the students for
the breach of university discipline,
and it also sets forth the belief of
the alumni committee, reached after
thorough investigation, that the pa
rade was not connected with drunk
enness. Such a report as this will
do the University good, as it express
es the sane and true sentiment of
the Student Body upon the question
of student drunkenness and will
counteract many false impressions
that have been created by the sen
sational reports in various papers
concerning the recent trouble here.
We regret that the Student Af
fairs Committee will not give the
alumni report official consideration,
as it is a document which truly ex
presses the sentiment of the Student
Body upon the recent controversy,
and it was hoped that such an ex
pression of opinion, coming from the
alumni, would receive official recog
nition at the hands of the commit
tee.
