# Cooper College Acquired.
## Medical Institution In San Francisco Will Become a Part of the University. 
### 
it has been decided that Cooper
Medical College of San Francisco will
become a part of Stanford Univer
sity and the University will have
one of the strongest medical depart
: ments in the country. The property
is deeded outright to the Universi
ty and the trust executed by Dr.
Lane will be followed by the Board
of Trustees of Stanford University.
The names of Lane Hall. Lane Hos
pital, Lane Library, and Cooper Hall
shall be preserved and the Univer
sity shall perpetually teach medicine.
This union of Cooper Medical Col
lege with Stanford was first suggest
ed by Dr. Lane himself, the honored
founder of the institution. In order
to carry out this desire he changed
his will and the deed of gift to ac
complish the union of the two insti
tutions. Since the settlement of the
Stanford estate, this adjustment has
been made practicable and in a short
time it will be an accomplished fact,
all the details having been already
agreed upon.
In brief, the conditions are that
Stanford University shall in perpetu
ity continue the study of the theory
land practice of medicine, and that
I it shall execute all the trusts left by
Dr. Lane, and that the names of the
buildings of the medical college
be retained.
The Stanford Medical department
will rank with Harvard Medical
I School and other eastern universi
ties which require an A. B. degree
I as a prerequisite for admission to
their course in medicine.
Details of Medical Course.
The details as to just how the med
ical course will be given will be de
cided upon later by the Academic
Council, but Dr. Jordan has prepared
a working plan which will probab
ly be adopted in all its essential fea
tures by the Council. According to
the President's plan seven years will
be required to complete the course,
j four or five at Stanford and two
l or three in San Francisco, the de
| gree of A. B. being given at the
end of the fourth year and M. D. at
! the end of the seventh. The first
! three years or pre-medical part of the
j course will be devoted to general
culture studies, Chemistry, Physiolo-
I gy, Zoology and allied subjects, with
j German or French. During the
fourth and fifth years the medi
cal students will take up the study
of Materia Medica, Anatomy, Prin
ciples of Medicine, Bacteriology and
Advanced Physiology and Chemistry.
i The last two or three years of the
; course will be spent in San Francisco
| in clinical work, pathology and bed
side instruction at Cooper Dispensary
! and Lane Hospital.
The students who are at present
enrolled at. Cooper will not come 1111-
1 der the control or supervision of the
i University in any way but will com
j plete their course under the old fac

ulty and management. No new stu
dents, however, will be enrolled at
Cooper after September, 190 S.
As soon as the Class of 1912 grad
uates the Faculty and directors of
Cooper will resign and transfer the
school with all its equipment and
endowment to the Board of Trus
tees of the University. It is prob
able that many of the present fac
ulty will be reappointed as there are
many eminent physicians and sur
geons 011 the teaching staff.
Beginning next year students will
be permitted to register at Stanford
as Medical majors and it is probable
that members of the present Fresh
man class will be permitted to
change their majors to medicine, if
they so desire. Thus the first class
to take an A. B. degree in Physiolo
gy, as medical attendants, at Stan
ford will be 1910, and 1914 will
probably be the first year in which
the degree of Doctor of Medicine will
be conferred. The question as to
whether special students will be ad
mitted to the Medical department
has not yet been decided but in the
case of regular students of medicine,
I the present regulations as to admis
j sion will be enforced. The first pro
fessional year in medicine corres
ponds almost exactly to the Senior
| year in the Department of Physiolo
; g.v.
l T nder the course of study outlined
by the committee appointed by Dr.
Jordan, Professors Stillman, Jenkins
and Marx, the Stanford School of
Medicine will be recognized as the
equal in thoroughness of any in the
United States. The equipment will
be gradually raised to rank with the
best, the Medical department of
Johns Hopkins representing a pres
ent ideal.
The Trustees have not. decided
that tuition will be charged
| in the course in medicine, but it is
altogether probable that students in
'all courses will be charged tuition.
in speaking of the affiliation of
j Cooper Medical College with Stan
ford, Dr. Jordan said:
"Cooper Medical College is one of
the best schools of its type, an insti
j tut ion fairly but not completely en
dowed, and therefore not able to
enforce the entrance requirements
' nor to furnish the equipment now re
i quired by university courses in medi
cine. 111 the past, it lias had a most
worthy record, and all honor should
be paid to its founder, l)r. Levi
Cooper Lane.
"lint in these days, institutions of
this type must merge themselves in
to universities in order to keep pace
with tin' demands of science and of
; medical education. Thus the Tol
land Medical College has become
part of the University of California,
the Rush College of the University
of Chicago, liellevue College of Cor
