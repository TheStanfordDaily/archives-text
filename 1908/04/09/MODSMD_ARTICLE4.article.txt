# ATHLETES MAY GO EAST
## MANAGER KNUPP BELIEVES FUNDS CAN BE RAISED. Stanford Could Send Fine Team to Conference Meet.—First Contribution Received. 
### 
Manager Knupp is seriously <-«m
-templating t lie chances of sending a
Stanford track team to the great
Conference Meet to be held at Chi
cago on .liine (I. This scheme lias
been considered by Trainer Moulton,
Captain Lanagan and the track squad
and it is believed that the Cardinal
could send nine or ten athletes to
this meet in the Midle West who
would be able to carry off several
first places against the large univer
sities represented in the Conference.
This opinion has been strengthen
ed by the high-class work of the
track men in yesterday's interclass
meet and there is now every reason
to believe that sufficient money will
be raised to send a team East. Man
ager Knupp believes that with the
money which can be raised among
the alumni, the students, and the
business men of Palo Alto, together
with a sum which the Executive
Committee would undoubtedly appro
priate for such a trip, a team could
be sent to Chicago in June. It would
require between $1300 and $1400 to
send a Stanford team to Chicago,
and according to the present plans,
that is about the number that would
be sent. Trainer Moulton would, of
course, accompany the men and he
believes that the team which he
could take to Chicago would be the
equal of any team entered in the
Conference Meet. If sufficient mon
ey can be raised for this trip there
is no doubt that it will be taken re
gardless of the outcome of the inter
collegiate meet, as the Conference
Meet, can be won by a small num
ber of first place men, and Stanford
will have a wonderfully strong team
to send East.
First Contribution To Fund.
The discussion of this proposed
eastern trip for the Stanford track
team has already created interest
outside of the University, and this
morning the"Daily Palo Alto" re
ceived a check for $14 from the
sporting staff of the San Francisco
"Chronicle," accompanied by a let
ter expressing the hope that Stan
ford would be represented by a
team at Chicago and wishing the Car
dinal athletes success.
There will undoubtedly be some
definite action taken at. the Execu
tive Committee meeting tonight con
cerning plans for raising funds f<>
send the track team to Chicago.
