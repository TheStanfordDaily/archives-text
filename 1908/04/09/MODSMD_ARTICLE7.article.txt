The acquisition of Cooper Medical
College as a part of Stanford Uni
versity is an event of far reaching
importance to the future of the Uni
versity. It means that Stanford will
be able to offer a finer medical
course than any other university 011
this Coast, and will be able to offer
a course that will rank with the
leading medical schools of the coun
try. This action has been under con
templation for some time past and
Ihe Board of Trustees is to be con
gratulated upon successfully negotia
ting so important an addition to the
University.
Cooper Medical College is one of
1 lie oldest and finest medical insti
tutions 011 the Coast, and the facili
ties offered there for advanced med
ical work are exceptionally good. The
institution has a fine building and a
well-equipped hospital in connection,
as well as a large library of medical
works, and the college has made a
lino reputation during its long ca
reer. That this accession to Stan
ford University was made possible is
due to the fact that although Cooper
Medical College was well endowed,
it had not sufficient funds to improve
its preparatory course and at the
same time keep up with the advance
in the requirements for collegiate
medical instruction. In becoming
connected with Stanford Cooper Med
ical College is following the custom
that has been set all over the coun
try of requiring a good university
preparation for advanced medical
work. And Stanford may now offer
as fine a medical course as any uni
versity.
