It now appears highly probable
tlrat a track team will be sent to Chi
cago to represent Stanford in the
Conference Meet next June. This
trip will be a fine thing for the Uni
versity in many ways. Our team
this year should be one of the strong
est. entered in the Conference Meet
and the showing made by the Cardin
al athletes would do a great deal to
ward increasing the prestige of the
University in the athletic world, and
it would be a benefit to the entire
Pacific Coast, if a Stanford team
should make a fine record at Chi-

I cago. but another even stronger rea
son for sending a team to represent
Stanford in this great meet of the
Middle Western universities, lies in
tlu' fact that the recent unpleasant
notoriety that has been given the
! University would l>o counteracted,
i When Stanford sends a team of fine
[athletes and fine men to Chicago,
the false reputation that may have
been attached to the University con
cerning drunkenness will be in a
large measure refuted. We have a
great opportunity to show the other
universities that Stanford in reality
j has as fine a group of men as any
institution in this country.
The Executive Committee and
Manager Knupp should announce
some definite plan of raising money
j for ihe proposed eastern trip and it
is then the duty of everyone concern
ed with the welfare of the University
to assist in this work of securing
money to send a team to Chicago.
With the assistance of the alumni,
the students, the business men of Pa
!lo Alto, and the different classes
which have money in the treasury,
such a trip is sure to be successful.
