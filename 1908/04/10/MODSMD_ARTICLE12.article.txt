Three Sophomores, prominent in

membership in Sword and Sandals,
at a recent meeting of that society.
The men were: H. W. Thompson, of
Portland, W. P. Fuller, Jr., of San

is smaller than it has been for sev

Thompson had leading parts in
both the Sophomore Comedy and Ju

George won his election by his work
as a lead in the Sophomore Comedy.
