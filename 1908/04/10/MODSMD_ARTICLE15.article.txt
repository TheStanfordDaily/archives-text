# Lectures on Parcels-Post.
## 
### 
Mr. Edward Berwick, of Pacific
Grove, delivered a very interesting
lecture this morning before Profes
sor Young's class in Railway Trans
portation on parcels-post. "Although
most people think it improbable," he
said, "the parcels-post system could
be used very successfully in this
country." He also suggested the ad
vantages of establishing a post-office
savings bank.
