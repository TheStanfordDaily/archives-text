# NEW RECORDS ACCEPTED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FIXES STANFORD FIGURES. Proposed Chicago Trip for Athletes Is Approved by the Executive Committee. 
### 
Following the numerous changes
which have occurred in the Stanford
track and Held records during the
i past few weeks and in order to get
; the best marks fixed for publica
tion in the 1909 "Quad," the Exec
utive Committee of the Associated
Students met last night and set anew
the records for the past year and
, also made a ruling which will serve
as a basis for the awarding of rec"
I ords in the future. Of the thirten
I records allowed, eight new and bet
i ter marks have been made in the
: past year and two former records
have been tied.
In the 220-yard dash, H. E. Reed,
!'lO, has been given the record over
the previous time of W. F. Dunn,
j In the shorter sprint, J. It. Holman,
| '09, and Reed have been allowed a
I tie on the former record of 10 1-5,
i held by H. L. Hamilton, '04. The
new records are in the quarter mile,
by Brown, '11, one mile, by C. B.
Bradford, 'OS, two mile, by E. J.
Nash, '08, broad jump, by T. Van
| dervoort, '08, and pole vault, by F.
It. Lanagan, '08. Horton has been
accredited with equalling J. C. Mac
farland's record of 25 4-5 seconds
in the low hurdles.
The Executive Committee, consid
ering the uncertain basis upon which
records have beeit allowed in the
| past, made the following regulation:
"Stanford records are to be here
after the best record of Stanford
I men in any meet against any other
i college or club under Stanford col
ors or in the annual interclass meet,
or as an individual competing as
a representative of the University
under sanction of the Executive Com
mittee."
Times at meets in the future will
1 be taken if possible by official tim
: ers, with a head timer to estimate
the allowable record. This was sug
gested last night and met with favor
' and probably will Tie put into effect
at. the next. meet.
The Student Body Committee ap
| proved of the proposed Chicago trip
I of the varsity track team, but. took
no action to raise funds, but will
meet for some such purpose next
Tuesday if it is the desire of the stu
i dents.
The new records added to the
list this year include two relay rec
j ords, one for a five-man event and
I the other for the four-man half mile
j event. The first was made at the
1 intercollegiate meet last year, while
the other was made this year at Los
| Angeles in competition with the Uni
j versify of Southern California.
At the meeting last night, L. New
: land, '08, T. R. W. F. FiggHoblyn,

I legiate chess tournament.
