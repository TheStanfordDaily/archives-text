# SECOND VARSITY GAME
## CARDINAL MEETS BLUE AND GOLD NINE TOMORROW. Intercollegiate Baseball Match Will Be Called at 2:30 on California Field. 
### 
At 2:30 tomorrow afternoon on
California Field, Berkeley, Third
baseman Scott, of the Cardinal nine,
will step to the plate, and the sec
| ond game of the 190S intercollegiate
series with the Blue and Gold team
will have begun. The first, played
on the Stanford Campus last Satur
i day, resulted in a victory for Cap
i
tain I'enton s team, and should they
be able to duplicate their perform
ance on the enemy's diamond tomor
row, the championship for the year
will remain with them. On the oth
er hand, should California triumph
I tomorrow, the deciding match will
;be contested two weeks hence, on
April 25.
Only one change is possible in the
line-up of the Stanford nine, when
it faces the Blue and Gold tomor
row, and that change is in the pitch
er's box. Notwithstanding Theile's
; superb showing in the game of last
Saturday, the coaches think that
Witmer's exceptional work through
out the season warrants the utmost
consideration. Acordingly, who will
occupy the slab will be a matter of
conjecture until the team takes the
field tomorrow afternoon. Whether
Witmer or Theile is chosen to do
the twirling will make no difference
as regards the catcher, as the coach
es will use Mitchell with either pitch
er. Mitchell's reliable work behind
the bat in the first match with Cal
ifornia made it a certainty that he
would be on the receiving end of
the battery during the remainder of
the series.
The other positions will be filled
as they were last week: Bell, firsi
base; Owen, second base; Scott,
third base; Fenton, shortstop; Tal
lant, left field; Wirt, center field:
; Ganong, right field. In the Blue and
Gold line-up it is probable that two
i changes will be made, Butler being
switched from center to second, eith
er Reid or Earnist taking his place
in the field.
The second contest presages to re
semble the first as regards being a
pitcher's battle. Captain Jordan will
again be on the slab for the oppos
ing nine, and it seems extremely like
ly that the game will develop into
a struggle between him and the Car
dinal twirler, Witmer or Theile as
the case may be.
Reid, of Belmont, and Brady, of
I St. Mary's, the umpires of last Sat
urday, will again officiate.
The Southern Pacific Company will
offer a round trip rate of $1.10 to
Berkeley, good to return either Sat
urday or Sunday.
