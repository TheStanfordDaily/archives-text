We wish to urge upon the mem
bers of the Student Body the ne
cessity of attending the second in
tercollegiate baseball game at Ber
keley tomorrow afternoon. When
our team won a victory last Satur
day, in spite of the loss of one of our
best men, we were justly proud of
the team and the chance to show
real appreciation is afforded tomor
row. As the second game is of great
importance to us, and the winning of
it will mean another victorious base
ball season for Stanford, every mem
ber of the Student Body should at
tend this contest and support the
team. California will surely have a
strong rooting section and we must
not be outdone.
In addition to the intercollegiate
baseball game at Berkeley, there
will be some fine contests 011 the
California track and field in the
morning, in which Stanford will be
represented. This additional attrac
tion should serve to increase the
number of Stanford rooters that will
be on hand to support the baseball
team in the second intercollegiate
game tomorrow afternoon.
