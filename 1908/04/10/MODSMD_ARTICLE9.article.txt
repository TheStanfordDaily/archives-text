The Senior class this afternoon
decided that its action of March 26
would stand, and that there will be
110 Senior Week festivities except the
laying of the class plate. We be
lieve that this protest of the Senior
class against the action of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, and this
method of showing our respect for
the members of the Senior class
who were so severely dealt with, is
one of the most effective ways in
which the Seniors can express their
feelings in this matter. The sub
sequent decision that any surplus
funds in the class treasury should
be devoted to the fund for sending
a Stanford team to the Conference

is another fine action taken at the
meeting of the Seniors this after
noon. There is no way in which
tliis money could be spent that would
be more beneficial to the University
and accomplish more toward placing
our University in the correct light
before the public. By sending a fine
track team to the Conference Meet,
Stanford will do a great deal more
than could be accomplished in any
other way toward showing the oth
er universities that Stanford has as
fine a type of college man as is found
in any other university. The Sen
iors have done a good work in con
tributing to this worthy cause.
