Vacation Employment.
Last summer six students made
$4 0 to $100 weekly as salesmen un
der my direction. T can use twelve
this year, so need six new men.
I have a straight, business prop
osition, no house-to-house canvass
ing, no books, views, "samples" or
"outfits" to sell you. I want high
grade men.
Mail your application and T will
refer you to last year's salesmen.
