# CONSIDER CHICAGO TRIP
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO MAKE PLANS TOMORROW. Proposal To Send Team East Meets With Widespread Interest Among Alumni. 
### 
The proposed trip of the track
team to Chicago this summer to
compete in the big track meet of
the Conference Association has as
sumed such promising proportions re
cently that a special meeting of the
Executive Committee has been called
for tomorrow afternoon. At this
time the many plans by which it is
believed money can be raised will
Ik considered and suggestions from
Manager Guy Knupp, '07, will be
received and considered. It is thought
that to send a team of any size to
the meet, at least $1,500 will be
needed. This figure is the largest
which has been raised for a similar
purpose before, but those who have
been interested in the matter of col
lection of funds are enthusiastic.
Up to the present time, while no
authoritative move has been made
to collect funds, subscriptions have
been turned in from several sources.
Two alumni of the University of Cal
ifornia have made substantial prom
ises to back the proposal, while sev
eral merchants in Palo Alto have
given voluntarily their promise to
help finance the move. D. E. Brown.
'97, has started a canvas of the alum
ni in San Francisco, and believes a
very considerable sum can be se
cured in that city.
Probable sources, some of which
have already made gifts, are: alumni
in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Port
land, Seattle and other portions of
the Coast, San Francisco newspapers,
Senior class and other classes, mer
chants of Palo Alto, members of the
Faculty, and undergraduates.
