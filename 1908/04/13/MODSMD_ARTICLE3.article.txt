# Second Game Won By California
## Cardinal Nine Loses Exciting Contest on Blue and Gold Diamond by Score of 2 to 1. 
### 
Two timely singles from the bats
of Smith and It. Myers, a walk off
Theile, and a careless error allowed
a pair of California runners lo com
plete the circuit of the bases in the
sixth inning of the second game of
the intercollegiate baseball series
between Stanford and the Blue and
Gold, giving the latter team a lead
which the Cardinal players could not
overcome. Stanford had succeeded
iii tallying once in the fifth, and
the final score stood 2 to i, as it
did a week ago Saturday, with the
positions of the contesting nines re
versed. The baseball offered was of
the best, and the interest was in
tense. Not an inning passed without
one or the other team getting men
on the bases, and a higher score
was only prevented by clever field
ing and the effectiveness of Theile
and Jordan at crucial moments.
Almost twenty-five hundred people
adorned the west bleachers on Cali
fornia Field when the game was call
ed. Both university bands were in
evidence, and the cheering was ex
ceptionally good for a baseball con
test.
Almost, from the opening inning
i; was clear that, as in the first
match, a major portion of the work
would devolve upon the opposing
pitchers, and, save in the sixth per
iod, the honors were easily with
Theile. In that inning, however, the
first man was given a base on balls,
Smith, the second batter, bit cleanly
to left, and reached second 011 Ga
nong's poor handling of the bingle.
First Baseman Myers' hard single to
left scored both runners and regis
tered California's only tallies.
Stanford's sole run came in the
fifth and was due to Owen, the
timely hitter to whom the Cardinal
owes victory in the intercollegiate
series of 1907. Witmer, who was
011 the bases in place of Theile, had
reached second 011 grounders retir
ing Wirt and Scott. With two out
Owen came to the plate. Waiting
carefully until three balls and two
strikes bad been called 011 him, the
second baseman swung squarely on
the next ball and planted it cleanly
in the center garden, out of the
fielder's reach. Witmer scored with
ease.
The Cardinal made several at
tempts to tally in other innings, but
hits which meant scores were not
forthcoming. In the second, witli
one out, Bell advanced half way
around the diamond, but was unable
to get. further. Again in the third,
Witmer was caught at the plate in
endeavoring to score from second
011 Fenton's single. In the eighth,
three men were safe on first, but

none could get beyond the keystone
sack. In all, ten Cardinal runners
were left on the bases, while only
three California men found them
selves in the same predicament when
the side was retired.
The Stanford infield, and especial
ly Captain Kenton, did admirable
work. Scott is credited with one
particularly spectacular assist. He
stopped a hot one along the third
base line, and, recovering quickly,
retired the runner at first.
Mitchell again proved himself a
heady and reliable catcher. His
throws to second were .remarkable !
for accuracy. As in the first game,
Tallant was the only Cardinal play
er to secure a pair of safe hits.
Reid, of Belmont, found it impossi
ble to be present, and the umpiring
fell to King Brady alone. Although
satisfactory, his work was not as
faultless as on the previous Satur
day.
The regular time for the third and
deciding game of the series is April
2.", the day of the intercollegiate re
gatta. However, as the men do not
desire to remain in training through
out the coming two weeks, an effort
is being made to change the date
and play the match on California
Kield next Friday afternoon.
The score:
Stanford.

Two timely singles from the bats
of Smith and It. Myers, a walk off
Theile, and a careless error allowed
a pair of California runners lo com
plete the circuit of the bases in the
sixth inning of the second game of
the intercollegiate baseball series
between Stanford and the Blue and
Gold, giving the latter team a lead
which the Cardinal players could not
overcome. Stanford had succeeded
iii tallying once in the fifth, and
the final score stood 2 to i, as it
did a week ago Saturday, with the
positions of the contesting nines re
versed. The baseball offered was of
the best, and the interest was in
tense. Not an inning passed without
one or the other team getting men
on the bases, and a higher score
was only prevented by clever field
ing and the effectiveness of Theile
and Jordan at crucial moments.
Almost twenty-five hundred people
adorned the west bleachers on Cali
fornia Field when the game was call
ed. Both university bands were in
evidence, and the cheering was ex
ceptionally good for a baseball con
test.
Almost, from the opening inning
i; was clear that, as in the first
match, a major portion of the work
would devolve upon the opposing
pitchers, and, save in the sixth per
iod, the honors were easily with
Theile. In that inning, however, the
first man was given a base on balls,
Smith, the second batter, bit cleanly
to left, and reached second 011 Ga
nong's poor handling of the bingle.
First Baseman Myers' hard single to
left scored both runners and regis
tered California's only tallies.
Stanford's sole run came in the
fifth and was due to Owen, the
timely hitter to whom the Cardinal
owes victory in the intercollegiate
series of 1907. Witmer, who was
011 the bases in place of Theile, had
reached second 011 grounders retir
ing Wirt and Scott. With two out
Owen came to the plate. Waiting
carefully until three balls and two
strikes bad been called 011 him, the
second baseman swung squarely on
the next ball and planted it cleanly
in the center garden, out of the
fielder's reach. Witmer scored with
ease.
The Cardinal made several at
tempts to tally in other innings, but
hits which meant scores were not
forthcoming. In the second, witli
one out, Bell advanced half way
around the diamond, but was unable
to get. further. Again in the third,
Witmer was caught at the plate in
endeavoring to score from second
011 Fenton's single. In the eighth,
three men were safe on first, but

none could get beyond the keystone
sack. In all, ten Cardinal runners
were left on the bases, while only
three California men found them
selves in the same predicament when
the side was retired.
The Stanford infield, and especial
ly Captain Kenton, did admirable
work. Scott is credited with one
particularly spectacular assist. He
stopped a hot one along the third
base line, and, recovering quickly,
retired the runner at first.
Mitchell again proved himself a
heady and reliable catcher. His
throws to second were .remarkable !
for accuracy. As in the first game,
Tallant was the only Cardinal play
er to secure a pair of safe hits.
Reid, of Belmont, found it impossi
ble to be present, and the umpiring
fell to King Brady alone. Although
satisfactory, his work was not as
faultless as on the previous Satur
day.
The regular time for the third and
deciding game of the series is April
2.", the day of the intercollegiate re
gatta. However, as the men do not
desire to remain in training through
out the coming two weeks, an effort
is being made to change the date
and play the match on California
Kield next Friday afternoon.
The score:
Stanford.
