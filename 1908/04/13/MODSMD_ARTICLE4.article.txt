# MEN IN GOOD CONDITION
## INJURED ATHLETES ARE FAST RETURNING TO FROM. Maundrell and Miller Will Compete Against California.â€”"Dad" Objects to Earthquake Parade. 
### 
With only five days remaining:
before the intercollegiate track meet,
it appears that the Stanford track
team will be in the best possible
condition when the first event is
called next Saturday afternoon. The
athletes who have been on the crip
pled list during the past week are all
rapidly improving and with the pos
sible exception of Manndrell, will be
strong enough to compete against
California. .Manndrell is now able to
walk without the aid of crutches,
though he limps and Hie injured
muscle is somewhat bothersome. In
case Manndrell is not able to run
a good race in ihe half it is not im
probable that Brown may yet be
entered in that event, though the
present plans are to reserve him for
the relay after running the quarter
mile.
Miller's injured foot is healing
rapidly and he is expected to be
running in good form before the end
ot the week. It cannot be known
how much this interruption of train
ing will influence his speed, but
Trainer Moulton anticipates a close
contest, between Miller and Dowd,
the California Freshman who ran
second to Brown in I: "> 9.4. Reed
and Coonan are now entirely recov
ered from their recent ' "break
downs" and are running in the same
torm exhibited before their injuries,
llolman is still troubled a little with
liis foot, but is rapidly rounding into
shape again and ought to be able to
do himself justice next Saturday.
Raines, the Freshman hurdler, is
working regularly, and will be en
tered in the high hurdles against
California.
"Dad" Moulton has been having the
men run trials every afternoon of
late in an endeavor to find who are
the most available runners for the
relay team. Wyman and Brown will
be reserved for this race after com
peting in the 4 40, unless Brown
should also be entered in the half,
and Coonan is also a likely member
of the team. The selection of the
fourth man is receiving constant, at
tention from Trainer Moulton. if
Miller is in shape he will be a strong
candidate for the place. Wyman ran
a trial quarter yesterday in 51.1, with
no competition, and Coonan covered
the distance in fast, time which is
reported to be under 54.
Trainer Moulton has raised a de
cided protest against the proposed
earthquake parade which was plan
ned for the early morning of April
IS. In speaking of the matter he
said: "I want to ask the men not
to hold the parade on Saturday morn
ing, or do anything else that will in
terfere with the rest of the men on
the team. It is not fair to the ath
letes who have trained hard all sea
son and now have a chance of win
ning from California, to be waken
ed at 5:30 on the morning of the
contest and made nervous the entire
day. by such a parade."
