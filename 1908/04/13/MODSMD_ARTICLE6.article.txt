It appears from the statement issued
by President Jordan today that the
report made by the committee of
four San Francisco alumni will have
little influence with the President. In
his statement the President com
ments upon the fact that the report
of this committee does not repre
sent any regular organization of
Stanford alumni, but goes 011 to
state that the matters of discipline
are entrusted to the President and
Faculty alone. From this statement
it would appear that the report of
tlie alumni committee was not con
sidered sufficiently representative by
the President, but the closing re
marks of his statement show that
any sort of an alumni report would
be unlikely to receive official con
sideration in such a matter. We re
gret that the efforts of the alumni
committee have not been more suc
cessful in receiving official considera
tion. There are good grounds for
the opinion that this report repre
sents the sentiment of a large num
ber of the alumni, as the meeting
at which it was accepted was well
attended by alumni, as was the meet
ing at which the committee was ap
pointed. On this account we feel
that the report really represents the
opinion of considerably more mem
bers of the alumni than the four
men who made the report. How
ever, the attitude of the President
appears determined, and we sincere
ly regret that the work of this com
mittee has not carried more weight.
We feel that in such a situation the
alumni opinion is worthy of serious
attention, as it is impartial and rep
resents the attitude of men who are
naturally most concerned with the
welfare of the University.
