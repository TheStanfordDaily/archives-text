# NO CHANGE AT MAYFIELD.
## Reports Concerning Change In Prohibition Administration Are Alleged To Be Untrue. 
### 
The account of yesterday's trustee
I election in the town of Mayfield,
which appeared in today's issue of
(a San Francisco daily, was a mis
interpretation of the actual facts, ac
cording to T. J. Palmateer, foreman
of the University machine shop. In
-1 stead of receiving only fifteen votes
to his opponent's one hundred and
twenty-five, Palmateer alleges that
!he polled ninety-five votes, or only
! four less than E. J. Ponce, a May
! field blacksmith, who defeated him
iin the race for the town council.
In discussing the probable effect of
Ponce's election on the liquor situa
tion in Mayfield, Palmateer sa.id:
"My opponent's victory will not alter
the prohibition policy that Professor
Clark has pursued in the past two
I years, as four out of the five trus
-1 tees are avowed anti-saloonists, and
it is probable that Clark will again
be chosen chairman of the Board.
In this capacity he will direct the
| policy of the administration. As the
I complexion of the present board will
i remain unchanged for at least the
j next two years, there is no possibil
j ity of an immediate change to a sa
! loon town."
