# Eastern Trip Is Now Assured.
## Executive Committee Endorses Plan And Will Glve Entertainment In Assembly Hall. 
### 
I The proposed trip of the track
team to Chicago this summer to com
pete in the annual Conference Meet is
, now practically an assured fact. At
| a special meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students
held this afternoon, while it was de
i cided that the committee could not
i officially sanction the trip due to the
lack of funds, the Student Body
would go on record as being highly
in favor of the project and will be
gin at once to collect subscriptions.
A personal canvass of the Faculty,
j Student Body and merchants of Palo
1 Alto; a monster student body enter
tainment, together with private sub
scriptions from alumni and outside
! enthusiasts, are the sources of capital
j which have been suggested and acted
j upon by the executive committee.
The part of the Student Body will
I take the form of a monster rally
and entertainment to be held next
Wednesday night, April 22, in As
sembly Hall. This big gathering will
be known as a "Smokerless Smoker."
i
I A committee of five was appointed to
day by the Executive Committee, with
j G. N. Richardson, '09, as chairman,
and F. H. Bernard, '08, G. E. Dole,
'08, R. A. Gott, '09, and L. Y. Mattes,
'08, to make the arrangements for
this entertainment, and in the next
! few days "josh" posters announcing
the nature of the show will be dis
(tributed about the Campus. In addi
! tion to an entertainment the Smoker
1 will serve as a big send-off and rally

! for the Varsity and Freshman crews,
i Coach W. F. Turner, '08, will tell of
i the prospects of the crews and will
explain the arrangements that have
been made for the regatta.
This Smoker is looked upon by the
Executive Committee as tlie most fea
sible way of raising funds and with
an admission of twenty-five cents it
lis expected several hundred dollars
j will be realized.
i To send the team East is estimated
that it will cost $1,500. This would
provide transportation and pay ex
penses for nine men and Dad Moul
j ton. President A. A. Murphy, '08,
and Manager Knupp have been au
thorized to act as finance committee
for the undertaking and to start have
promises for $200. They have re
ceived a gift of $">0 from C. P. Holt,
a former graduate of the University
of California, a substantial check
from San Francisco newspaper men,
the money voted by the Senior Class
and a communication from the New
York Alumni Association in which it
I appears that organization would help
| considerably.
President. Murphy and Manager
! Knupp started the canvass this after
i noon, and beginning tomorrow a
I daily list of contributors will be pub
lished in the"Daily Palo Alto."
The track men are enthusiastic
over the prospects and it is under
