# CONSIDER REGATTA OFFICIALS.
## Coach Turner Is Preparing List To Send To California.â€”Varsity Race Will Be First. 
### 
Coach Turner has been preparing
a list of officials who will be de
sired by Stanford. This list con
tains the names of men to represent
California and of others to represent
Stanford, and is based on the officials
who have served in previous races,
but is naturally incomplete, as Cal
ifornia has not yet been consulted by
Manager Knupp, who has a copy of
the list. California will probably be
consulted soon in regard to the offi
cials for the regatta so that the list
can be announced this week.
The Varsity race will be first in
the regatta and will probably be
called at 9 : 0. Arrangements will
be made so that, a ferry boat will
leave to carry spectators to the ob
servation train at Sausalito soon af
ter their arrival at. the foot of Mar
ket street, San Francisco, from an
early train from Palo Alto. More
seats are being constructed on the
observation cars than were used last
year, so that ample accommoda
tions will be provided for all who
desire to see the race from the
train.
