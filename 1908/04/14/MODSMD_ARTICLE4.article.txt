### 
The track rally, at which the Stu
dent Body will give the last send-off
to the members of the track squad
and the various other teams which
are to represent Stanford in the in
tercollegiate contests next Saturday,
w ill be held in Assembly Hall, Thurs
day evening, at 7::!0. Yell leader
(1 X. Richardson, '09, is arranging
a program for the event which in
cludes speeches by two members of
the Faculty. One of the latter speak
ers will be Professor F. C. Wood
ward, of the Law department, who
has consented to make a short ad
dress. The other arrangements for
the meeting are not yet complete
and will be announced later.
The members of the track team
have been working hard the last two
days and seem in little danger of be
ing overtrained. For many of the
men, tomorrow will be the last day
of regular work as they will do very
little on Thursday and Friday, con
serving all possible energy for the
competition against the Blue and
Gold. Other athletes who have had
their training interrupted by injur
ies will continue light work in order
to get into as good form as possible.
Maundrell was on the track yes
terday afternoon, but his leg still
troubles him and he was unable to
run in any form. The attempt to
train was painful and the outlook
for Maundrell's recovering sufficiently
to compete against California does
not seem favorable. However, there
is still a chance that he will enter,
as he is determined to run unless
totally disabled.
"Dad" had several more trial
quarters run yesterday, but no es
pecially good performances were de
veloped, although Severy covered
the distance in 54. Among the
sprinters, W. H. Gardner, '09, lias
been improving rapidly lately and
promises to figure in the meet Satur
day. The first heat of the 220-yard
dash should bring out. one of the
fastest competitions of the day, and
the contest for third place to quali
fy for the final will be a close one,
with Reed and Gardner entered for
Stanford and Captain Stanton and
rJrnnrtv nmiiiii? for California.
