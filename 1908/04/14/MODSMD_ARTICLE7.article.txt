The Executive Committee has
given its official support to the pro
posed Chicago trip for a Stanford
team to participate in the Conference
Meet in June. We have assurances
of substantial support from various
outside sources and it is to the mem
bers of the Student Body that the
strongest appeal should be made.
Our team this year is one of the best
that has ever represented the Car
dinal and would undoubtedly make
a creditable showing at Chicago. In
addition to the athletic prestige to
be gained by the University, it would
be a particularly good thing to have
Stanford represented at the Confer
ence Meet this year, because of the
amount of injurious notoriety that
the University has received during
our recent trouble. The good effects
of sending of a strong track team
t.o represent our University at Chi
cago next June will do much to cor
rect the many false impressions that
may have gone abroad concerning
the character of our Student Body.
For this reason, as well as for the
athletic advantages of being repre
sented in competition with the best
Middle Western universities, we feel
that every member of the Student
Body should assist in making this
trip a success.
