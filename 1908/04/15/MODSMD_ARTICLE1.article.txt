spring election, two members from

ed from each of the three lower class

and Freshmen elected, the one from
each class receiving the smallest
number of ballots shall hold office
only until January, 1909. All oth
er members of this committee shall
hold office for one year.
Article V, Section 1. Shall be
amended to read: "The officers and
standing committees of this associa

Alto' and certain members of stand
ing committees, as hereinbefore pro
vided in Article 111, Section 11, who
shall be elected on the first Wednes
day after the first Sunday in Decem
ber."
In addition to the proposed amend
ment to the Student Body Constitu
tion, the committee appointed by Pre
sident Murphy recommends that the
Executive Committee should appoint
an auditing committee of three mem
bers from the Executive Committee,
and that this auditing committee
should consider the accounts of the
Student Body Treasurer at the end
of each month, instead of the end
of each semester. This change can
easily be made by the Executive
Committee without necessitating any
amendment to the constitution.
