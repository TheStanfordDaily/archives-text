to the important rally in Assembly
Hall tomorrow night. This celebra

meet California on Saturday and it
is particularly necessary that we
show our sincere appreciation of the
conscientious work of the various
teams. It is also essential that we
revive the enthusiastic spirit that
has characterized our rallies in the
past, and which should not be in
terrupted even by the recent trouble
through which the Student Body has
suffered. Let every loyal Stanford
student attend the rally tomorrow
night and cheer for the teams.
