The proposed amendment to the
Student Body Constitution which ap
pears in another column is one which
should concern every member of the
Student Body. According to the
amendment suggested the Executive
Committee would be so constituted
that there would be some experi
enced members on the committee at
the opening of each college year.
This we believe is a marked improve
ment upon the present method of se
lecting the members of this most im
portant committee. Under the pres
ent system it is generally the rule
that every August an entirely new
set of Executive Committee mem
bers comes into office. This causes
considerable delay in the managing of
the Student Body affairs, and is also
a serious handicap in attaining the
best results. On a committee that
is of as much importance in the
handling of the Student Body busi
ness as the Executive Committee,
there should always be some experi
enced members. By having some
men who bad already served on the
committee at the opening of each
college year if would assure the new
committee of being able to take tip

its work without material interrup
tion, and (he advice of these men
would bo most, valuable. This pro
posed amendment is one which
should be carefully considered by the
Student Body, as it is a change which
wo believe would do a great deal to
ward improving the administration of
the Student. Body affairs.
