# Ticket Sale Is Light.
## 
### 
The sale of tickets for the track
meet has been very light. Manager
Knupp has called attention to this
fact. He said today that if the stu
dents would secure their tickets be
fore going to the oval it would save
a great (leal of delay and confusion
and would be a courtesy to our vis
itors. The special train from San
Francisco will arrive in Palo Alto at
12:03, leaving Third and Townsend
streets in San Francisco at 11:10.
The regular 11 o'clock train will be
run with additional accommodations.
