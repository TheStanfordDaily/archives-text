# CARNEGIE FUND INCREASED.
## Professors in State Universities Will Hereafter Be Eligible for Pensions. 
### 
The Carnegie pension fund, pro
vided by the steel magnate several
years ago to provide an income for
retired college professors, has re
ceived an addition of five million
dollars in the form of five per cent,
bonds, making the fund fifteen mil
lion dollars. This bequest has just
been made by Mr. Carnegie in an
swer to a petition sent by the Na
tional Association of State Univer
sities. The state university coming
within its benefits must have the ap
proval of the legislature and gover
nor.
Mr. Carnegie did not at first in
clude the faculties of state insti
tutions in the benefits of the gift,
because he thought that the states
would prefer that their relations
would remain exclusively with the
state. The national organization as
sured him that this was not so, and
that the exclusion of state school
faculties put a handicap on their
getting the best scholars on their
instructional force. It was also dis
covered that the income from the
original $1.0,000,000 was completely
exhausted. Mr. Carnegie has now
added five millions, and state univer
sity men will be admitted as bene
ficiaries with the approval of their
legislatures and governors.
