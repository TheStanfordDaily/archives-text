auspices of the Stanford Art Clul),
was opened this morning in the new
Art Gallery. The exhibition is prob
ably the most representative ever
held upon the Pacific Coast, con
taining not only pictures of the fa
mous American artists, but also of
the best known European painters,
both of the modern school and of
the Middle Ages.
The picture that is of the greatest
interest both with reference to its
history and technical excellence, is
a canvas of the Rubens' School.
A study of animal life by Rosa Bon
heur is among the pictures, and Is
of interest because of its historical
connection and its technical super
iority. Other famous French artists
who are represented are De Latour
and Corot.
Pictures of the Pacific Coast art
ists, William Keith, Sidney Yard,
and G. L. Noyes, are in the collec
tion, those of Keith being of the
bold, warm, impressionistic type
that is characteristic of this Cali
fornian.
Among the painters represented
are the names of Fiskin, Nourse,
Carlsen, Tony Offerman, Harshe,
Vivion and Clark.
