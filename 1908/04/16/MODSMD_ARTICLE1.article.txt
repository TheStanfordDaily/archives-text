# VOTE MONEY FOR TEAM
## JUNIORS ADD TO THE FUND FOR EASTERN TRIP. Point-Winners Will Receive Uppers and Jerseys.â€”Committees Report on Junior Festivities. 
### 
The Junior class voted $50 this
afternoon to the fund to send the
track team east to compete in the
Conference Meet which will be held
in Chicago on June <!. The fund for
the varsity athletes is growing at
present by private subscriptions, but
the other classes will probably make
donations after the fund has increas
ed, as contributions other than those
of the classes will probably not
amount to the sum which is neces
sary to defray the expenses of the
trip.
In addition to the amount voted
to the track team, provision was
made for uppers and jerseys for the
1909 track and field men. Four men
who had never won points for 1909
until the recent interclass meet were
given uppers and jerseys, while all
the men in college who ever won
points for the class in an interclass
meet were given uppers bearing the
numerals, as the class athletes had
never received this mark of distinc
tion.
R. A. Gott and A. J. Gowan were
voted sweaters bearing the class nu
merals for their victory in the in
terclass championship matches. Gott
and Gowan made a very good show
ing on the courts, when they won the
doubles championship.
The report of the Prom, commit
tee was read and accepted. The state
ment of the committee showed $18.44
on the credit side of the sheet. The
committee sold 124 tickets for the
Prom., the sale bringing $G2O. The
Junior Day committee reported min
or expenses. No report has yet been
submitted by the Opera committee.
The following men were granted
their class jerseys and uppers for
the first time: S. G. Sweet, W. W.
Adams, W. H. Gardner and C. J.
Peterson. In the list of men who
will receive their uppers are the fol
lowing: J. R. Holman, D. P. Craw
