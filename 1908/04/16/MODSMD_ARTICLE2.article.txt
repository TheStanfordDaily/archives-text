# knupp Receives More Money.
## 
### 
Manager Knupp visited San Fran- |
eisco today and received assurances j
from the alumni in the city that con- !
siderable money could be raised |
among the Stanford men for the pur- i
pose of sending the team to Chica- |
go. Another offer which Knupp re- j
ceived in the city was from A. O. '
Spaulding & Company, who will con- |
tribute $50. Joe Larkin, of Palo
Alto, has made Knupp an offer to give
a certain percentage of his receipts ,
on Saturday toward the fund, and j
as there will be an unusually large j
crowd in Palo Alto on that day there |
should be a. substantial return from i
Larkin's generous offer.
