# Interesting Statement of Case.
## Strong Opinion Given Alumni Regarding the Parade, By a Temperance Advocate. 
### 
The Stanford Alumni Committee,
in its investigation, has secured from
Harry C. Green, '08, an associate of
the "Sequoia" staff, and formerly
president of the Stanford Temperance
League, a statement in regard to the
student demonstrations at Stanford
of March 112. This statement was not
made for publication, but merely as
nn expression to the alumni commit
tee to aid in the proper investigation
ot" the difficulty. It is a clear state
ment of the purposes ol' the parade,
nnd the committee feels that it will
tend to correct the erroneous im
pressions in the public mind that the
demonstration was against the ef
forts of the University authorities
to rid the institution of the burden
and disgrace of student drunkenness.
That impression is very generally
held and is doing much harm to the
University. It has put tlie forty-one
suspended students in a false posi
tion, and simple justice to them re
quires a careful statement to set
them right. In view of these facts
the committee, with Green's permis
sion, publishes tin- statement.
"By the way of introduction 1
might, say that when I was younger
than I am now I enjoyed the good fel
lowship of the cup to some extent
with the boys at home. But for
several years before 1 came to Stan
ford, and ever since 1 have been here
I have been fighting the evils of the
saloon. I feel, therefore, i can appre
ciate the view-point of both sides of
the drinking question.
"While the remote cause of the
present bad relationship existing be
tween the Faculty and students may
have some connection with the drink
ing evil, the parade was not a dem
onstration for drunkenness, nor were
the paraders all drinking men.
Many tine young men were caught up
in the true spirit of the protest, and
have now been branded by the com
mittee as drinking fellows, as far as
their parents, friends and the out
side world may see t lie matter.
"I have been a teacher myself for
several yearsâ€”long enough to ap
preciate the value of firm discipline.
On the other hand, however, 1 have
always insisted that disciplinary reg
ulations must be reasonable, adapted
to tiie occasion, and furthermore,
the penalty attached must be appro
priate and in proportion to the of
fense.
"The parade of March 12 was a
protest against the unsympathetic,
ambigious and unreasonable edict of
the committee. For the three breach
es of university discipline which the
committee claims occurred, the Stu
dent Body and the paraders separate
ly apologized. The mere matter of
parading has long been a custom here
and had never been frowned upon
before. Therefore, when twelve men
were indiscriminately selected for
suspension, tlie parade petition of
247 names, (including my own), was
also a protest against, the unreason

able punishment which the commit
tee had meted out. Next to expul
sion, this suspension was the sever
est penalty within the power of the
committee. It.was certainly inappro
priate to tiie offense, and its injus
tice clearly apparent.
"When thirty-four more names
were added to the list by the com
mittee, who wholly disregarded all
efforts made by the Student Body to
bring about a sympathetic, kindly hu
man relationship, we felt that, the
committee was heaping insult upon
injury, and this fact gives us good
and ample grounds to continue our
protests until a better feeling, a
closer bond of sympathy and unity
are brought about for the honor and
good name of STANFORD.
"We who have come to know Dr.
Jordan hold him in high esteem, and
we feel that means should be devised
whereby lie may come into closer
touch with the larger body of stu
dents. We further feel most strongly
that lie should appoint men on the
Student. Affairs Committee who re
gard tiie men and women who com
pose the Student Body, not as mere
sticks and stones, but as real, live,
flesh and blood human beings, with
natural tastes, desires, appetites, pas
sions and frailties, vet withal with
hearts and souls. This the present
committee has absolutely failed to
do. Furthermore, the actions of tiie
committee and Dr. Jordan's state
ment have worked irreparable in
jury to many of the men suspended.
They have been branded as being
"fired" from a great American uni
versity for drunkenness, which is ab
solutely false. Nevertheless, these
men must go out into the future
handicapped, and blighted in their
careers; heart-broken mothers must
receive their boys with this unmerit
ed stain and stigma upon their char
acters, when in reality the most they
have done lias been to engage in a
college prank, from which the major
ity escaped the punishment of sus
pension and the public brand of the
President and the committee. This
is absolutely unfair and unjust. The
alumni committee should strive (as
the members of the Student Body
are doing) to put this matter right
before the world. A signed acknowl
ment. of the wrong done should
somehow be secured from the mem
bers of the Student Affairs Commit
tee, and a copy furnished each stu
dent who has been wrongly branded.
Many students feel that President
Jordan will sooner or later retract
his statement, but doubt if he will
do this in time to have the desired
effect. The opinion of the conservative
element of the Student Body is that
harmony and unity, fairness and jus
tice will never exist as long as the
present committee is in power.
"It. lias been conceded by many
members of the Faculty, including
