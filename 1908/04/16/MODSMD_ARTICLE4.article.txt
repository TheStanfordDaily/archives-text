# LAST DAY OF TRAINING
## ATHLETES TO DO ONLY LIGHT WORK TOMORROW. Men Are In Condition and There Is Good Chance for a Cardinal Victory. 
### 
This afternoon witnessed the last
regular training for the majority of
the men on the track, as tomorrow
will be devoted to the lightest possi
ble work, the men doing only what
is necessary to keep their muscles
in condition for the meet Saturday
afternoon. With the exception of
Miller and Maundrell, every man on
the team is in condition and ready
for the contest. While still figur
ing that the score will be close,
"Dad" seems better pleased with the
prospects than at any time since
Maundrell's injury.
The loss of Miller and Maundrell,
both of whom seem practically out
of the meet, will force the other
members of the team to exert them
selves to the utmost to secure the
long end of the score. The fact,
that Miller will be out of the run
ning in the half may change the
previous plans in regard to the en
tries, so that the probability of
Brown being entered against Dowd
in the XSO seems stronger than be
fore. In this case, the personnel
of the relay team may be still fur
ther changed as it. is unlikely that
Brown will be forced to enter three
events.
Jt is reported in the San Francisco
papers this morning that Munn, the
champion of the Freshman meet, who
has been counted upon as a heavy
point-winner for California in the
coming meet, is confined to his bed
with a stone-bruise on his heel, but
it. is not believed that the injury will
prove sufficiently serious to prevent
his competing Saturday. On the oth
er hand, reports seem to indicate that
many of the men on the California
squad who were slow to get into
condition are now rounding into fine
shape. DeMamiel is credited with
running a trial mile in better time
than his record of 4 2, made last
year, so that he will be distinctly
in the race this year. Dowd is al
so snid to have shown improvement
since the Freshman meet when he
ran close to Brown in 1:59.4.
The new cinders on the track are
beginning to work in satisfactorily
and the path promises to be in good
condition on Saturday after it has
been rolled down again. The new
bleachers have received the last
touches and are ready for occupation
while the tree which obstructed the
view has been removed. A large
score-board has been erected at the
south end of the oval so that every
thing is in readiness for the recep
tion of the visitors on Saturday.
