The warning issued by Trainer
Moulton against holding an "earth
quake parade" early Saturday morn
ing should be respected. The cus
tom of holding such a parade upon
the anniversary of the great earth
quake was started last spring, and
as a result many of the track ath
letes were awakened at an tearly
hour. This year the earthquake an
niversary comes upon the very day
of the intercollegiate track meet, and
every precaution snould be taken to
insure the track men a perfect night's
rest before the big meet. Any un
usual noise at an early morning
hour would interfere with our
Chances of sending a team on the
track in the best possible condition.
For this important reason the resi
dents of the Campus should dispense
with the early morning parade on
Saturday.
