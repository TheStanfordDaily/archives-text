# Tomorrow Will Witness Decision of Four Intercollegiate Contests On Cardinal Campus.
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that live sure
point-winners have been lost, in one
manner or another, the track team
which will represent Stanford when
'the intercollegiate meet is called at
i 2: Mo tomorrow afternoon, is one of
I the strongest and most evenly bal
anced aggregations that lias ever
! worn the Cardinal on a cinder path.
Not only are the men capable of good
performances and trained to the best
possible condition, but every man on
the squad is a fighter, with the strong
determination to win ibis contest
from the Blue and Gold despite all
the interruptions and mishaps that
have marred this season's training.
California is known to have a good
: team and is confident that the result
j will be in favor of the Blue and
Gold, but unless something unfore
seen arises, the prospect, seems to be
a hard-fought contest and a close
score, with the chances in favor of
a victory for the Cardinal athletes.
"Dad's" assurance that the men are
in the best of shape goes a long way
toward maintaining confidence that
tomorrow will record another defeat
for California and another triumph
I of the "Stanford Spirit."
"Dad" Predicts Hard I'igbt.
"I think we can land this meet,
but in order to do it every man will
have to do his best, if there is any
! loafing or serious mishap, we may
j lose. But. the outcome does not de
pend on the quarter or any other one
race. If we do not come lip to ex

pectations in some ])articulai' event,
we may still pull up somewhere else
and win the meet. I expect ;i hard,
close light but our men are in con
dition to fight, and fight hard, and
I don't think we will lose."
Track Kvenls To lie Close.
On the track Stanford expects to
annex the majority of the first places
though tlx 1 larger- number of sec
onds and thirds falling to California
will tend to keep the score close.
From the start each event will be
hard fought. Bradford is expected to
win the mile from DeMamiel, his ri
val of last, year, though the strug
gle will probably be a close one.
Bradford has been running strong in
all the preliminary meets and has a
good sprint at the finish which few
distance men can survive. Third
place will also be a good fight, be
tween Porter and McGregor for
Stanford and Hoydson and Erskine
of California. Bovdson defeated Por
ter in th<> Freshman meet in 4:38.4,
but it is doubtful 1f lie can finish
ahead of the Stanford runner
present. Maundrell will enter the
mile, but it cannot be foretold to
what extent, his injury will handicap
him. In the two-mile. Nash, who is
running in the best form he has ever
shown, is a sure winner and it is
not improbable that the record in this
event will be lowered. Sweet and
Adams have both done this race in
10:12 and it would not. bo a sur-

prise lo the Stanford bleachers to
see both men finish ahead of either !
Clabaugh or Gaines, who are the \
strongest, of the California distance
men. Thompson, winner of the
Freshman event for California, may
also figure with the older athletes. I
(■rent Race in Quarter.
The greatest interest is probably
centered in the quarter-mile, which :
promises to be one of the most sen
sational races seen on the Coast in
some time. California places her j
faith in Stanton's performance of j
50.3 against Pomona, while Stanford
is confident that Brown, who has |
covered the 440 in the same time,
has sprint, enough to win from the j
California captain at the finish. Wy
man, who won the quarter in the
Freshman meet, is credited with
51.1 in a recent trial and is ex
pected to give a good account of
himself when he runs with such
fast competition.
Brown will have another hard j
race in the half when he meets Dowd,
the California Freshman who is said
to have improved since his defeat in
the Freshman meet. Bradford will
i
also run this race 'and may be
counted upon to give either Liggett j
or Dossier a hard fight for the oth
er place. Whether or not Brown ;
can retain strength enough to low
er his time of 1:59.4 in the half,
after running the quarter, is a doubt- i
fill question.
Heed Is 1 lost In Sprints.
Reed is counted upon for first j
place in both sprints, though he will j
have a fast man against him in the J
220-yard dash in the person of Stan
ton. the California captain. Johns,
who won this event last, year, will
not compete. Gt-tindy is crediited
with 22.4 in Ibis event, but both
Reed and Holman can do 1-5 better
than this. In the hundred the
chances are good that Reed and Hol
man will talce the first two places,
while Gardner will run the Califor
nia men a good race.
California has the advantage in
the hurdles, though both Horton and
Peaslee are men who always do bet
ter in competition, and may show
up well against the Rlue and Gold.
Cowles should take the high, and
his team-mate, Edwards, is a likely
second place, as both are doing 15.4.
In the 220-vard hurdles the race
will be between Johns and Horton,
and the Californian's time of 25.4
in the Pomona meet marks him as a
likely winner.
Classy Competition in the Field.
In the field Stanford should take
four of the five first places, though
the break in joints will be about
even owing to the fact, that Cali
fornia stands a good chance of an
nexing all the points in the hammer
throw, where Munn is consistently
throwing over 140 feet, while Bnl
zari, Glazier and Swim are all doing
good work. Youker, the strongest
Cardinal entry, has done 135 feet, but
has some difficulty in staying in the
ring. Horton is accorded first in

the shot with Munn second, while
third place will probably go to either
Blake or Budelman.
If Martin jumps consistently he
will have no difficulty in the high
jump, as Munn is not doing better
than 5 feet, I o inches. Third place
lies between Sterling, Otis and Poor
for Stanford and either Bull or Stout,
of California. Vandervoort's perform
ance of 23 feet., 4 1-2 inches in the
broad marks him as the winner of
this event, while Meddick may take
second from Munn and his team
mates, Chapman, Kretsinger and Vil
as. Everyone will be surprised if
Bellah does not win the pole-vault,
as he is in fine form and is expected
to do twelve feet or better. Munn,
Kocher, Scott and Cook will fight for
the other two places.
Trainer Christie has turned out
a good relay team and as "Dad"
Moulton has had some little difficul
ty in finding quarter men to fill out
his team, the result of this race will
be in doubt, until the final lap is run.
Cheney, Jones, Fish and McNamara
or Stanton will probably compose
the visiting team, while Wyman, Coo
non, Brown and either Miller, Wheel
er or Reed will run for the Cardinal.
In spite of the fact that live sure

Track Kvenls To lie Close.
On the track Stanford expects to
annex the majority of the first places
though tlx 1 larger- number of sec
onds and thirds falling to California
will tend to keep the score close.
From the start each event will be
hard fought. Bradford is expected to
win the mile from DeMamiel, his ri
val of last, year, though the strug
gle will probably be a close one.
Bradford has been running strong in
all the preliminary meets and has a
good sprint at the finish which few
distance men can survive. Third
place will also be a good fight, be
tween Porter and McGregor for
Stanford and Hoydson and Erskine
of California. Bovdson defeated Por
ter in th<> Freshman meet in 4:38.4,
but it is doubtful 1f lie can finish
ahead of the Stanford runner
present. Maundrell will enter the
mile, but it cannot be foretold to
what extent, his injury will handicap
him. In the two-mile. Nash, who is
running in the best form he has ever
shown, is a sure winner and it is
not improbable that the record in this
event will be lowered. Sweet and

(■rent Race in Quarter.
The greatest interest is probably
centered in the quarter-mile, which :
promises to be one of the most sen
sational races seen on the Coast in
some time. California places her j
faith in Stanton's performance of j
50.3 against Pomona, while Stanford
is confident that Brown, who has |
covered the 440 in the same time,
has sprint, enough to win from the j
California captain at the finish. Wy
man, who won the quarter in the
Freshman meet, is credited with
51.1 in a recent trial and is ex
pected to give a good account of
himself when he runs with such
fast competition.
Brown will have another hard j
race in the half when he meets Dowd,
the California Freshman who is said
to have improved since his defeat in
the Freshman meet. Bradford will
i
also run this race 'and may be
counted upon to give either Liggett j
or Dossier a hard fight for the oth
er place. Whether or not Brown ;
can retain strength enough to low
er his time of 1:59.4 in the half,
after running the quarter, is a doubt- i
fill question.
Heed Is 1 lost In Sprints.
Reed is counted upon for first j
place in both sprints, though he will j
have a fast man against him in the J
220-yard dash in the person of Stan
ton. the California captain. Johns,
who won this event last, year, will
not compete. Gt-tindy is crediited
with 22.4 in Ibis event, but both
Reed and Holman can do 1-5 better
than this. In the hundred the
chances are good that Reed and Hol
man will talce the first two places,
while Gardner will run the Califor
nia men a good race.
California has the advantage in
the hurdles, though both Horton and
Peaslee are men who always do bet
ter in competition, and may show
up well against the Rlue and Gold.
Cowles should take the high, and
his team-mate, Edwards, is a likely
second place, as both are doing 15.4.
In the 220-vard hurdles the race
will be between Johns and Horton,
and the Californian's time of 25.4
in the Pomona meet marks him as a
likely winner.
Classy Competition in the Field.
In the field Stanford should take
four of the five first places, though
the break in joints will be about
even owing to the fact, that Cali
fornia stands a good chance of an
nexing all the points in the hammer
throw, where Munn is consistently
throwing over 140 feet, while Bnl
zari, Glazier and Swim are all doing
good work. Youker, the strongest
Cardinal entry, has done 135 feet, but
has some difficulty in staying in the
ring. Horton is accorded first in

the shot with Munn second, while
third place will probably go to either
Blake or Budelman.
If Martin jumps consistently he
will have no difficulty in the high
jump, as Munn is not doing better
than 5 feet, I o inches. Third place
lies between Sterling, Otis and Poor
for Stanford and either Bull or Stout,
of California. Vandervoort's perform
ance of 23 feet., 4 1-2 inches in the
broad marks him as the winner of
this event, while Meddick may take
second from Munn and his team
mates, Chapman, Kretsinger and Vil
as. Everyone will be surprised if
Bellah does not win the pole-vault,
as he is in fine form and is expected
to do twelve feet or better. Munn,
Kocher, Scott and Cook will fight for
the other two places.
Trainer Christie has turned out
a good relay team and as "Dad"
Moulton has had some little difficul
ty in finding quarter men to fill out
his team, the result of this race will
be in doubt, until the final lap is run.
Cheney, Jones, Fish and McNamara
or Stanton will probably compose
the visiting team, while Wyman, Coo
non, Brown and either Miller, Wheel
er or Reed will run for the Cardinal.
In spite of the fact that live sure
point-winners have been lost, in one
manner or another, the track team
which will represent Stanford when
'the intercollegiate meet is called at
i 2: Mo tomorrow afternoon, is one of
I the strongest and most evenly bal
anced aggregations that lias ever
! worn the Cardinal on a cinder path.
Not only are the men capable of good
performances and trained to the best
possible condition, but every man on
the squad is a fighter, with the strong
determination to win ibis contest
from the Blue and Gold despite all
the interruptions and mishaps that
have marred this season's training.
California is known to have a good
: team and is confident that the result
j will be in favor of the Blue and
Gold, but unless something unfore
seen arises, the prospect, seems to be
a hard-fought contest and a close
score, with the chances in favor of
a victory for the Cardinal athletes.
"Dad's" assurance that the men are
in the best of shape goes a long way
toward maintaining confidence that
tomorrow will record another defeat
for California and another triumph
I of the "Stanford Spirit."
"Dad" Predicts Hard I'igbt.
"I think we can land this meet,
but in order to do it every man will

(■rent Race in Quarter.
The greatest interest is probably
centered in the quarter-mile, which :
promises to be one of the most sen
sational races seen on the Coast in
some time. California places her j
faith in Stanton's performance of j
50.3 against Pomona, while Stanford
is confident that Brown, who has |
covered the 440 in the same time,
has sprint, enough to win from the j
California captain at the finish. Wy
man, who won the quarter in the
Freshman meet, is credited with
51.1 in a recent trial and is ex
pected to give a good account of
himself when he runs with such
fast competition.
Brown will have another hard j
race in the half when he meets Dowd,
the California Freshman who is said
to have improved since his defeat in
the Freshman meet. Bradford will
i
also run this race 'and may be
counted upon to give either Liggett j
or Dossier a hard fight for the oth
er place. Whether or not Brown ;
can retain strength enough to low
er his time of 1:59.4 in the half,
after running the quarter, is a doubt- i
fill question.
Heed Is 1 lost In Sprints.
Reed is counted upon for first j
place in both sprints, though he will j
have a fast man against him in the J
220-yard dash in the person of Stan
ton. the California captain. Johns,
who won this event last, year, will
not compete. Gt-tindy is crediited
with 22.4 in Ibis event, but both
Reed and Holman can do 1-5 better
than this. In the hundred the
chances are good that Reed and Hol
man will talce the first two places,
while Gardner will run the Califor
nia men a good race.
California has the advantage in
the hurdles, though both Horton and
Peaslee are men who always do bet
ter in competition, and may show
up well against the Rlue and Gold.
Cowles should take the high, and
his team-mate, Edwards, is a likely
second place, as both are doing 15.4.
In the 220-vard hurdles the race
will be between Johns and Horton,
and the Californian's time of 25.4
in the Pomona meet marks him as a
likely winner.
Classy Competition in the Field.
In the field Stanford should take
four of the five first places, though
the break in joints will be about
even owing to the fact, that Cali
fornia stands a good chance of an
nexing all the points in the hammer
throw, where Munn is consistently
throwing over 140 feet, while Bnl
zari, Glazier and Swim are all doing
good work. Youker, the strongest
Cardinal entry, has done 135 feet, but
has some difficulty in staying in the
ring. Horton is accorded first in

the shot with Munn second, while
third place will probably go to either
Blake or Budelman.
If Martin jumps consistently he
will have no difficulty in the high
jump, as Munn is not doing better
than 5 feet, I o inches. Third place
lies between Sterling, Otis and Poor
for Stanford and either Bull or Stout,
of California. Vandervoort's perform
ance of 23 feet., 4 1-2 inches in the
broad marks him as the winner of
this event, while Meddick may take
second from Munn and his team
mates, Chapman, Kretsinger and Vil
as. Everyone will be surprised if
Bellah does not win the pole-vault,
as he is in fine form and is expected
to do twelve feet or better. Munn,
Kocher, Scott and Cook will fight for
the other two places.
Trainer Christie has turned out
a good relay team and as "Dad"
Moulton has had some little difficul
ty in finding quarter men to fill out
his team, the result of this race will
be in doubt, until the final lap is run.
Cheney, Jones, Fish and McNamara
or Stanton will probably compose
the visiting team, while Wyman, Coo
non, Brown and either Miller, Wheel
er or Reed will run for the Cardinal.
In spite of the fact that live sure
point-winners have been lost, in one
manner or another, the track team
which will represent Stanford when
'the intercollegiate meet is called at
i 2: Mo tomorrow afternoon, is one of
I the strongest and most evenly bal
anced aggregations that lias ever
! worn the Cardinal on a cinder path.
Not only are the men capable of good
performances and trained to the best
possible condition, but every man on
the squad is a fighter, with the strong
determination to win ibis contest
from the Blue and Gold despite all
the interruptions and mishaps that
have marred this season's training.
California is known to have a good
: team and is confident that the result
j will be in favor of the Blue and
Gold, but unless something unfore
seen arises, the prospect, seems to be
a hard-fought contest and a close
score, with the chances in favor of
a victory for the Cardinal athletes.
"Dad's" assurance that the men are
in the best of shape goes a long way
toward maintaining confidence that
tomorrow will record another defeat
for California and another triumph
I of the "Stanford Spirit."
"Dad" Predicts Hard I'igbt.
"I think we can land this meet,
but in order to do it every man will
have to do his best, if there is any
! loafing or serious mishap, we may
j lose. But. the outcome does not de
pend on the quarter or any other one
race. If we do not come lip to ex

pectations in some ])articulai' event,
we may still pull up somewhere else
and win the meet. I expect ;i hard,
close light but our men are in con
dition to fight, and fight hard, and
I don't think we will lose."
Track Kvenls To lie Close.
On the track Stanford expects to
annex the majority of the first places
though tlx 1 larger- number of sec
onds and thirds falling to California
will tend to keep the score close.
From the start each event will be
hard fought. Bradford is expected to
win the mile from DeMamiel, his ri
val of last, year, though the strug
gle will probably be a close one.
Bradford has been running strong in
all the preliminary meets and has a
good sprint at the finish which few
distance men can survive. Third
place will also be a good fight, be
tween Porter and McGregor for
Stanford and Hoydson and Erskine
of California. Bovdson defeated Por
ter in th<> Freshman meet in 4:38.4,
but it is doubtful 1f lie can finish
ahead of the Stanford runner
present. Maundrell will enter the
mile, but it cannot be foretold to
what extent, his injury will handicap
him. In the two-mile. Nash, who is
running in the best form he has ever
shown, is a sure winner and it is
not improbable that the record in this
event will be lowered. Sweet and
Adams have both done this race in
10:12 and it would not. bo a sur-
