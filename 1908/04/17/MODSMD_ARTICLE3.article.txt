# Tomorrow Will Witness Decision of Four Intercollegiate Contests On Cardinal Campus.
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that live sure
point-winners have been lost, in one
manner or another, the track team
which will represent Stanford when
'the intercollegiate meet is called at
i 2: Mo tomorrow afternoon, is one of
I the strongest and most evenly bal
anced aggregations that lias ever
! worn the Cardinal on a cinder path.
Not only are the men capable of good
performances and trained to the best
possible condition, but every man on
the squad is a fighter, with the strong
determination to win ibis contest
from the Blue and Gold despite all
the interruptions and mishaps that
have marred this season's training.
California is known to have a good
: team and is confident that the result
j will be in favor of the Blue and
Gold, but unless something unfore
seen arises, the prospect, seems to be
a hard-fought contest and a close
score, with the chances in favor of
a victory for the Cardinal athletes.
"Dad's" assurance that the men are
in the best of shape goes a long way
toward maintaining confidence that
tomorrow will record another defeat
for California and another triumph
I of the "Stanford Spirit."
"Dad" Predicts Hard I'igbt.
"I think we can land this meet,
but in order to do it every man will
have to do his best, if there is any
! loafing or serious mishap, we may
j lose. But. the outcome does not de
pend on the quarter or any other one
race. If we do not come lip to ex

pectations in some ])articulai' event,
we may still pull up somewhere else
and win the meet. I expect ;i hard,
close light but our men are in con
dition to fight, and fight hard, and
I don't think we will lose."
Track Kvenls To lie Close.
On the track Stanford expects to
annex the majority of the first places
though tlx 1 larger- number of sec
onds and thirds falling to California
will tend to keep the score close.
From the start each event will be
hard fought. Bradford is expected to
win the mile from DeMamiel, his ri
val of last, year, though the strug
gle will probably be a close one.
Bradford has been running strong in
all the preliminary meets and has a
good sprint at the finish which few
distance men can survive. Third
place will also be a good fight, be
tween Porter and McGregor for
Stanford and Hoydson and Erskine
of California. Bovdson defeated Por
ter in th<> Freshman meet in 4:38.4,
but it is doubtful 1f lie can finish
ahead of the Stanford runner
present. Maundrell will enter the
mile, but it cannot be foretold to
what extent, his injury will handicap
him. In the two-mile. Nash, who is
running in the best form he has ever
shown, is a sure winner and it is
not improbable that the record in this
event will be lowered. Sweet and
Adams have both done this race in
10:12 and it would not. bo a sur-
