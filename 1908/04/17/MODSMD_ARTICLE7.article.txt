Many editorials have been written
encouraging Stanford teams that
have faced California. There have
been many exhortations urging the
Student Body to support our teams
in these intercollegiate contests; but
never has there been more necessity
of encouraging our teams than at
rhis time. We feel sure that teams
which have gone through the hard
training season endured by our rep
resentatives this year and survived
the loss of some of their leaders and
best men are sure to represent Stan
ford in a worthy manner tomorrow.
Our University has a reputation for
clean sportsmanship and a deter
mined fighting spirit. We feel that,
ihe Cardinal teams will uphold this
reputation tomorrow, and to insure a
victorious day for Stanford it is ne
cessary for every member of the
Student Body to support our teams.
Never has a strong rooting section
been more needed at a great track
meet. It is our duty to support this
team, which has already shown its
line lighting spirit, from start, to fin
ish. and with this sort of backing
we believe that Stanford will close
the series of intercollegiate contests
with a victorious record.
