### 
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
the varsity nine, in a somewhat, shat
tered condition, will cross bats with
the Wiley B. Allen team of San Fran
cisco. Both Theile and Witmer will
do slab duty for the Cardinals with
Mitchell behind the bat. On account
of the fact that he will participate
in the track meet, it is probable that
Scott will not play in the baseball
game. Center fielder Wirt will also
be out. of the line-up. The visitors'
nine comprises the following players:
Yaezell, pitcher; Collins, catcher;
Coffin, first base; Hood, second base;
Waters, shortstop; Stenson, third
base; Gari, left field; Parker, center
field; O'Connor, right field.
