In a meet where nearly every event
developed a reversal of form or a
mishap which completely upset all
previous calculations, California was
victorious over the Cardinal this af
ternoon. though the shattered Stan
ford team put up a game fight and
the final score was kept in doubt
until the field events. The perform
ances throughout the meet were high
class and five intercollegiate records
were broken in the course of the
afternoon. Bradford established a
new mark of 4:32.3 in the mile, low
ering the previous mark by a second,
Brown took three-fifths off the for
mer time in the half by running the
two laps in 1:59.2. Stanton's time
of 50.2 in the quarter is three-fifths
better than the record. Horton and
Johns took one-fifth off the 220-yard
hurdle time by getting over the
sticks in 25. 2. while the Stanford
relay team, composed of Morris, Coo
nan, Brown and Wyman, brought a
day of record-breaking races to a
fitting close by running the relay in
3:27.1.
Stanford's calculations were entire
ly upset and the chances of a Car
dinal victory almost ruined early in

iho meet, when Reed, an apparent
winner in the hundred, snapped the
tendon which was injured some
weeks ago and suffered a break
down which shut him out of that race
and prevented him from entering the
220-yard dash, where he was expect
ed to win from the California entries.
In spite of this almost irreparable
misfortune, the outcome might still
have been favorable for the Stanford
team if California had not taken
some unexpected points when Nash
was forced out of the two-mile run
by a sudden attack of heart failure
which for a time threatened to re
sult. seriously.
For the Cardinal, Brown and Hor
ton were the stars of the meet. The
Freshman runner not only displayed
wonderful speed, but by running
three hard races, two of which he
ran in record time, he showed an
amount of endurance which marks
him as one of the greatest runners
that, lias ever represented Stanford.
Horton had fast men against, him
in the hurdles, but secured an even
break with Johns in the 220-yard
event, in record time, besides win
ning the shot from Munn with a toss
of 4 2 feet, 10 inches.
Bradford did all that was expected
of him in the mile and also ran a
good race in the half, while Wyman's
performances in both the quarter and
final lap of the relay mark him as
one of the fastest athletes on the
team.
Stanton and Munn deserve the cre
dit for the success of the Blue and
Gold. The California captain showed
a wonderful sprint in the quarter and
also ran a good hundred in 10.1,
equalling the intercollegiate record.
Munn was handicapped by an injured
heel which kept him out of the
pole vault, and the broad jump,
though he did good work in the shot
and high jump.
Bradford Wins the Mile.
Stanford started off tlie first event
by taking six points, Bradford win
ning the mile in record time with
De Mamiel, of California, second and
McGregor third. It was Bradford's
finish that proved too much for the
California runner, who had kept be
hind until the last. lap. Maundrell
entered the event at. the last minute,
but his injury proved too serious
and he was unable to run anywhere
near his usual form. Bradford ran
a beautiful race and finished about
two yards ahead of De Mamiel, the
California man having a hard fight,
with McGregor, who finished a close
third. Porter ran a game race for
Stanford, but the pace proved too
fast at the finish.
(Quarter Goes to Stanton.
As was expected, the quarter

proved to be one of the hardest
fought races of the day, and Captain
Stanton, of California, beat out
Brown and Wyman in a driving fin
ish. winning in 50.2. Wyman took
the pole at the start and led around
the first turn and along the back
stretch, with Stanton second 011 the
turn and Brown third. Along the
back stretch Brown passed Stanton
it iid the three leaders held these po
sitions until the last, turn, when
Stanton began to close up on the
Cardinal runners and in a gruelling
race down the stretch the speedy
California runner crossed the tape in
the lead.
111-own Wins Past Half.
The half-mile developed one of the
fastest races of the day and Brown
proved that he is one of the great
est runners ever seen 011 the Coast,
by taking first in 1:59.2. Dowd, of
California drew the pole, but Lee, of
Stanford, took the lead. Brown and
Bradford were fourth and fifth on
the first turn but Bradford picked
up and took the lead in the second
turn, while Brown still stayed back
as he was closed in by California
runners. On the final sprint Brown
showed his wonderful speed and won
by a good margin. Dowd and Do
zier took second and third, and Brad
ford, who looked to have second
place, was cut off on the straight
away by the California runners.

In the sprints Stanford's hopes
were shattered hy the breakdown of
Reed in the hundred, whose injured
leg went back on him and he was
11 mihlo to finish in this event and

could not enter the two-twenty. Hoi- !
man, however, ran a tine race in both
sprints, taking second in the hundred
iind was an exceedingly close second
in the two-twenty.
The short sprint was won by Stan- j
ton, of California, with Holman sec
ond and Gardner third in the fast i
time of 10.1. The 220-yard dash
proved an exciting race with Holman
and Stanton fighting all the way,
when Paul, of California, came up at
the finish and just nosed Holman out
of first place.
Nnsli Sufi'ci's Heart Attack.
The two-mile proved one of the
biggest surprises of the day, as Nash ,
was unable to finish on account of !
an attack upon his heart, which at
first threatened to prove most ser
ious and the game little runner was J
carried from the track. Adams ran '
well and took second for Stanford, ;
but was unable to keep up with !
Gaines, of California, on the last lap. :
Hobart, of California, took third.
Bevier and Sweet ran gamely for
Stanford, but the pace proved too j
fast for them.
Ilellali Wilis Vault.
Stanford led in the field, though
the performances were not up to the
standard of previous meets except
in the pole vault, where Bellah
cleared the bar at 12 feet, 1 inch, i
After the competition he made three i
trials at 12 feet, C inches, but gath-j
ering darkness prevented his seeing
either the take-off or the bar, and
he failed by a narrow margin in each
attempt. Martin had a hard fight
against Munn in the high jump, as
the California entry was in fine form
and the contest finally resulted in
a tie at 5 feet, 11 3-8 inches. Hor
ton's toss of 4 2 feet, 10 inches was
good for first place in the shot,
while Vandervoort. took the five
points in the broad. Meddick was not
in form and second went to Vilas.
Rellah securing third. The Stanford
entries failed to place in the hammer
throw, Owen being the only one to
qualify for the finals.
Stanford Wins Relay.
California's expectations were ov
erthrown in the relay, which was
captured by the Stanford team in
3:27.1, after a close and exciting race
which kept the rooters on their feet
from the start. Morris ran the first
lap, finishing about two yards behind
Fish, while McNealv increased the
California lead to eight yards in a
hard race with Coonan. Starting on
the third lap with this handicap.
Brown pulled away from Fiske in
the final stretch and sent Wyman
away with a lead of five yards, which
Jones never cut down, and the Stan
ford runner finished with a lead of
fifteen yards.
Tie in Low Hurdles.
In the 220-yard hurdles llorton
and .lohns. of California, tied for
first place with Morris third. This
was a close race all the way and the
two men went over the last hurdles
together and finished in 25.2. The
high hurdles proved a victory for
California with Cowles first and Ed
wards second. Peaslee was a good

third in this event.

up and took the lead in the second
turn, while Brown still stayed back
as he was closed in by California
runners. On the final sprint Brown
showed his wonderful speed and won
by a good margin. Dowd and Do
zier took second and third, and Brad
ford, who looked to have second
place, was cut off on the straight
away by the California runners.

In the sprints Stanford's hopes
were shattered hy the breakdown of

man, however, ran a tine race in both
sprints, taking second in the hundred
iind was an exceedingly close second
in the two-twenty.
The short sprint was won by Stan- j
ton, of California, with Holman sec
ond and Gardner third in the fast i
time of 10.1. The 220-yard dash
proved an exciting race with Holman
and Stanton fighting all the way,
when Paul, of California, came up at
the finish and just nosed Holman out
of first place.
Nnsli Sufi'ci's Heart Attack.
The two-mile proved one of the
biggest surprises of the day, as Nash ,
was unable to finish on account of !
an attack upon his heart, which at
first threatened to prove most ser
ious and the game little runner was J
carried from the track. Adams ran '
well and took second for Stanford, ;
but was unable to keep up with !
Gaines, of California, on the last lap. :
Hobart, of California, took third.
Bevier and Sweet ran gamely for
Stanford, but the pace proved too j
fast for them.
Ilellali Wilis Vault.
Stanford led in the field, though
the performances were not up to the
standard of previous meets except
in the pole vault, where Bellah
cleared the bar at 12 feet, 1 inch, i
After the competition he made three i
trials at 12 feet, C inches, but gath-j
ering darkness prevented his seeing
either the take-off or the bar, and
he failed by a narrow margin in each
attempt. Martin had a hard fight
against Munn in the high jump, as
the California entry was in fine form
and the contest finally resulted in
a tie at 5 feet, 11 3-8 inches. Hor
ton's toss of 4 2 feet, 10 inches was
good for first place in the shot,
while Vandervoort. took the five
points in the broad. Meddick was not
in form and second went to Vilas.
Rellah securing third. The Stanford
entries failed to place in the hammer
throw, Owen being the only one to
qualify for the finals.
Stanford Wins Relay.
California's expectations were ov
erthrown in the relay, which was
captured by the Stanford team in
3:27.1, after a close and exciting race
which kept the rooters on their feet
from the start. Morris ran the first
lap, finishing about two yards behind
Fish, while McNealv increased the
California lead to eight yards in a
hard race with Coonan. Starting on
the third lap with this handicap.

ford runner finished with a lead of
fifteen yards.

In a meet where nearly every event
developed a reversal of form or a
mishap which completely upset all
previous calculations, California was
victorious over the Cardinal this af
ternoon. though the shattered Stan
ford team put up a game fight and
the final score was kept in doubt
until the field events. The perform
ances throughout the meet were high
class and five intercollegiate records
were broken in the course of the
afternoon. Bradford established a
new mark of 4:32.3 in the mile, low
ering the previous mark by a second,
Brown took three-fifths off the for
mer time in the half by running the
two laps in 1:59.2. Stanton's time
of 50.2 in the quarter is three-fifths
better than the record. Horton and
Johns took one-fifth off the 220-yard
hurdle time by getting over the
sticks in 25. 2. while the Stanford
relay team, composed of Morris, Coo
nan, Brown and Wyman, brought a
day of record-breaking races to a
fitting close by running the relay in
3:27.1.
Stanford's calculations were entire
ly upset and the chances of a Car
dinal victory almost ruined early in

iho meet, when Reed, an apparent
winner in the hundred, snapped the
tendon which was injured some
weeks ago and suffered a break
down which shut him out of that race
and prevented him from entering the
220-yard dash, where he was expect
ed to win from the California entries.
In spite of this almost irreparable
misfortune, the outcome might still
have been favorable for the Stanford
team if California had not taken
some unexpected points when Nash
was forced out of the two-mile run
by a sudden attack of heart failure
which for a time threatened to re
sult. seriously.
For the Cardinal, Brown and Hor
ton were the stars of the meet. The
Freshman runner not only displayed
wonderful speed, but by running
three hard races, two of which he
ran in record time, he showed an
amount of endurance which marks
him as one of the greatest runners
that, lias ever represented Stanford.
Horton had fast men against, him
in the hurdles, but secured an even
break with Johns in the 220-yard
event, in record time, besides win
ning the shot from Munn with a toss
of 4 2 feet, 10 inches.
Bradford did all that was expected
of him in the mile and also ran a
good race in the half, while Wyman's
performances in both the quarter and
final lap of the relay mark him as
one of the fastest athletes on the
team.
Stanton and Munn deserve the cre
dit for the success of the Blue and
Gold. The California captain showed
a wonderful sprint in the quarter and
also ran a good hundred in 10.1,
equalling the intercollegiate record.
Munn was handicapped by an injured
heel which kept him out of the
pole vault, and the broad jump,
though he did good work in the shot
and high jump.
Bradford Wins the Mile.
Stanford started off tlie first event
by taking six points, Bradford win
ning the mile in record time with
De Mamiel, of California, second and
McGregor third. It was Bradford's
finish that proved too much for the
California runner, who had kept be
hind until the last. lap. Maundrell
entered the event at. the last minute,
but his injury proved too serious
and he was unable to run anywhere
near his usual form. Bradford ran
a beautiful race and finished about
two yards ahead of De Mamiel, the
California man having a hard fight,
with McGregor, who finished a close
third. Porter ran a game race for
Stanford, but the pace proved too
fast at the finish.
(Quarter Goes to Stanton.
As was expected, the quarter

proved to be one of the hardest
fought races of the day, and Captain
Stanton, of California, beat out
Brown and Wyman in a driving fin
ish. winning in 50.2. Wyman took
the pole at the start and led around
the first turn and along the back
stretch, with Stanton second 011 the
turn and Brown third. Along the
back stretch Brown passed Stanton
it iid the three leaders held these po
sitions until the last, turn, when
Stanton began to close up on the
Cardinal runners and in a gruelling
race down the stretch the speedy
California runner crossed the tape in
the lead.
111-own Wins Past Half.
The half-mile developed one of the
fastest races of the day and Brown
proved that he is one of the great
est runners ever seen 011 the Coast,
by taking first in 1:59.2. Dowd, of
California drew the pole, but Lee, of
Stanford, took the lead. Brown and
Bradford were fourth and fifth on
the first turn but Bradford picked
up and took the lead in the second
turn, while Brown still stayed back
as he was closed in by California
runners. On the final sprint Brown
showed his wonderful speed and won
by a good margin. Dowd and Do
zier took second and third, and Brad
ford, who looked to have second
place, was cut off on the straight
away by the California runners.

In the sprints Stanford's hopes
were shattered hy the breakdown of
Reed in the hundred, whose injured
leg went back on him and he was
11 mihlo to finish in this event and

against Munn in the high jump, as
the California entry was in fine form
and the contest finally resulted in
a tie at 5 feet, 11 3-8 inches. Hor

California lead to eight yards in a

fifteen yards.

In a meet where nearly every event
developed a reversal of form or a
mishap which completely upset all
previous calculations, California was
victorious over the Cardinal this af
ternoon. though the shattered Stan
ford team put up a game fight and
the final score was kept in doubt
until the field events. The perform
ances throughout the meet were high
class and five intercollegiate records
were broken in the course of the
afternoon. Bradford established a
new mark of 4:32.3 in the mile, low
ering the previous mark by a second,
Brown took three-fifths off the for
mer time in the half by running the
two laps in 1:59.2. Stanton's time
of 50.2 in the quarter is three-fifths
better than the record. Horton and
Johns took one-fifth off the 220-yard
hurdle time by getting over the
sticks in 25. 2. while the Stanford
relay team, composed of Morris, Coo
nan, Brown and Wyman, brought a
day of record-breaking races to a
fitting close by running the relay in
3:27.1.
Stanford's calculations were entire
ly upset and the chances of a Car
dinal victory almost ruined early in

iho meet, when Reed, an apparent
winner in the hundred, snapped the
tendon which was injured some
weeks ago and suffered a break
down which shut him out of that race
and prevented him from entering the
220-yard dash, where he was expect
ed to win from the California entries.
In spite of this almost irreparable
misfortune, the outcome might still
have been favorable for the Stanford
team if California had not taken
some unexpected points when Nash
was forced out of the two-mile run
by a sudden attack of heart failure
which for a time threatened to re
sult. seriously.
For the Cardinal, Brown and Hor
ton were the stars of the meet. The
Freshman runner not only displayed
wonderful speed, but by running
three hard races, two of which he
ran in record time, he showed an
amount of endurance which marks
him as one of the greatest runners
that, lias ever represented Stanford.
Horton had fast men against, him
in the hurdles, but secured an even
break with Johns in the 220-yard
event, in record time, besides win
ning the shot from Munn with a toss
of 4 2 feet, 10 inches.
Bradford did all that was expected
of him in the mile and also ran a
good race in the half, while Wyman's
performances in both the quarter and
final lap of the relay mark him as
one of the fastest athletes on the
team.
Stanton and Munn deserve the cre
dit for the success of the Blue and
Gold. The California captain showed
a wonderful sprint in the quarter and
also ran a good hundred in 10.1,
equalling the intercollegiate record.
Munn was handicapped by an injured
heel which kept him out of the
pole vault, and the broad jump,
though he did good work in the shot
and high jump.
Bradford Wins the Mile.
Stanford started off tlie first event
by taking six points, Bradford win
ning the mile in record time with
De Mamiel, of California, second and
McGregor third. It was Bradford's
finish that proved too much for the
California runner, who had kept be
hind until the last. lap. Maundrell
entered the event at. the last minute,
but his injury proved too serious
and he was unable to run anywhere
near his usual form. Bradford ran
a beautiful race and finished about
two yards ahead of De Mamiel, the
California man having a hard fight,
with McGregor, who finished a close
third. Porter ran a game race for
Stanford, but the pace proved too
fast at the finish.
(Quarter Goes to Stanton.
As was expected, the quarter

proved to be one of the hardest
fought races of the day, and Captain
Stanton, of California, beat out
Brown and Wyman in a driving fin
ish. winning in 50.2. Wyman took
the pole at the start and led around
the first turn and along the back
stretch, with Stanton second 011 the
turn and Brown third. Along the
back stretch Brown passed Stanton
it iid the three leaders held these po
sitions until the last, turn, when
Stanton began to close up on the
Cardinal runners and in a gruelling
race down the stretch the speedy
California runner crossed the tape in
the lead.
111-own Wins Past Half.
The half-mile developed one of the
fastest races of the day and Brown
proved that he is one of the great
est runners ever seen 011 the Coast,
by taking first in 1:59.2. Dowd, of
California drew the pole, but Lee, of
Stanford, took the lead. Brown and
Bradford were fourth and fifth on
the first turn but Bradford picked
up and took the lead in the second
turn, while Brown still stayed back
as he was closed in by California
runners. On the final sprint Brown
showed his wonderful speed and won
by a good margin. Dowd and Do
zier took second and third, and Brad
ford, who looked to have second
place, was cut off on the straight
away by the California runners.

In the sprints Stanford's hopes
were shattered hy the breakdown of
Reed in the hundred, whose injured
leg went back on him and he was
11 mihlo to finish in this event and

could not enter the two-twenty. Hoi- !
man, however, ran a tine race in both
sprints, taking second in the hundred
iind was an exceedingly close second
in the two-twenty.
The short sprint was won by Stan- j
ton, of California, with Holman sec
ond and Gardner third in the fast i
time of 10.1. The 220-yard dash
proved an exciting race with Holman
and Stanton fighting all the way,
when Paul, of California, came up at
the finish and just nosed Holman out
of first place.
Nnsli Sufi'ci's Heart Attack.
The two-mile proved one of the
biggest surprises of the day, as Nash ,
was unable to finish on account of !
an attack upon his heart, which at
first threatened to prove most ser
ious and the game little runner was J
carried from the track. Adams ran '
well and took second for Stanford, ;
but was unable to keep up with !
Gaines, of California, on the last lap. :
Hobart, of California, took third.
Bevier and Sweet ran gamely for
Stanford, but the pace proved too j
fast for them.
Ilellali Wilis Vault.
Stanford led in the field, though
the performances were not up to the
standard of previous meets except
in the pole vault, where Bellah
cleared the bar at 12 feet, 1 inch, i
After the competition he made three i
trials at 12 feet, C inches, but gath-j
ering darkness prevented his seeing
either the take-off or the bar, and
he failed by a narrow margin in each
attempt. Martin had a hard fight
against Munn in the high jump, as
the California entry was in fine form
and the contest finally resulted in
a tie at 5 feet, 11 3-8 inches. Hor
ton's toss of 4 2 feet, 10 inches was
good for first place in the shot,
while Vandervoort. took the five
points in the broad. Meddick was not
in form and second went to Vilas.
Rellah securing third. The Stanford
entries failed to place in the hammer
throw, Owen being the only one to
qualify for the finals.
Stanford Wins Relay.
California's expectations were ov
erthrown in the relay, which was
captured by the Stanford team in
3:27.1, after a close and exciting race
which kept the rooters on their feet
from the start. Morris ran the first
lap, finishing about two yards behind
Fish, while McNealv increased the
California lead to eight yards in a
hard race with Coonan. Starting on
the third lap with this handicap.
Brown pulled away from Fiske in
the final stretch and sent Wyman
away with a lead of five yards, which
Jones never cut down, and the Stan
ford runner finished with a lead of
fifteen yards.
Tie in Low Hurdles.
In the 220-yard hurdles llorton
and .lohns. of California, tied for
first place with Morris third. This
was a close race all the way and the
two men went over the last hurdles
together and finished in 25.2. The
high hurdles proved a victory for
California with Cowles first and Ed
wards second. Peaslee was a good

third in this event.

dit for the success of the Blue and
Gold. The California captain showed
a wonderful sprint in the quarter and
also ran a good hundred in 10.1,
equalling the intercollegiate record.
Munn was handicapped by an injured
heel which kept him out of the
pole vault, and the broad jump,
though he did good work in the shot
and high jump.
Bradford Wins the Mile.
Stanford started off tlie first event
by taking six points, Bradford win
ning the mile in record time with
De Mamiel, of California, second and
McGregor third. It was Bradford's
finish that proved too much for the
California runner, who had kept be
hind until the last. lap. Maundrell
entered the event at. the last minute,
but his injury proved too serious
and he was unable to run anywhere
near his usual form. Bradford ran
a beautiful race and finished about
two yards ahead of De Mamiel, the
California man having a hard fight,
with McGregor, who finished a close
third. Porter ran a game race for
Stanford, but the pace proved too
fast at the finish.
(Quarter Goes to Stanton.
As was expected, the quarter

proved to be one of the hardest
fought races of the day, and Captain
Stanton, of California, beat out
Brown and Wyman in a driving fin
ish. winning in 50.2. Wyman took
the pole at the start and led around
the first turn and along the back
stretch, with Stanton second 011 the
turn and Brown third. Along the
back stretch Brown passed Stanton
it iid the three leaders held these po
sitions until the last, turn, when
Stanton began to close up on the
Cardinal runners and in a gruelling
race down the stretch the speedy
California runner crossed the tape in
the lead.
111-own Wins Past Half.
The half-mile developed one of the
fastest races of the day and Brown
proved that he is one of the great
est runners ever seen 011 the Coast,
by taking first in 1:59.2. Dowd, of
California drew the pole, but Lee, of
Stanford, took the lead. Brown and
Bradford were fourth and fifth on
the first turn but Bradford picked
up and took the lead in the second
turn, while Brown still stayed back
as he was closed in by California
runners. On the final sprint Brown
showed his wonderful speed and won
by a good margin. Dowd and Do
zier took second and third, and Brad
ford, who looked to have second
place, was cut off on the straight
away by the California runners.

In the sprints Stanford's hopes
were shattered hy the breakdown of
Reed in the hundred, whose injured
leg went back on him and he was
11 mihlo to finish in this event and

could not enter the two-twenty. Hoi- !
man, however, ran a tine race in both
sprints, taking second in the hundred
iind was an exceedingly close second
in the two-twenty.
The short sprint was won by Stan- j
ton, of California, with Holman sec
ond and Gardner third in the fast i
time of 10.1. The 220-yard dash
proved an exciting race with Holman
and Stanton fighting all the way,
when Paul, of California, came up at
the finish and just nosed Holman out
of first place.
Nnsli Sufi'ci's Heart Attack.
The two-mile proved one of the
biggest surprises of the day, as Nash ,
was unable to finish on account of !
an attack upon his heart, which at
first threatened to prove most ser
ious and the game little runner was J
carried from the track. Adams ran '
well and took second for Stanford, ;
but was unable to keep up with !
Gaines, of California, on the last lap. :
Hobart, of California, took third.
Bevier and Sweet ran gamely for
Stanford, but the pace proved too j
fast for them.
Ilellali Wilis Vault.
Stanford led in the field, though
the performances were not up to the
standard of previous meets except
in the pole vault, where Bellah
cleared the bar at 12 feet, 1 inch, i
After the competition he made three i
trials at 12 feet, C inches, but gath-j
ering darkness prevented his seeing
either the take-off or the bar, and
he failed by a narrow margin in each
attempt. Martin had a hard fight
against Munn in the high jump, as
the California entry was in fine form
and the contest finally resulted in
a tie at 5 feet, 11 3-8 inches. Hor
ton's toss of 4 2 feet, 10 inches was
good for first place in the shot,
while Vandervoort. took the five
points in the broad. Meddick was not
in form and second went to Vilas.
Rellah securing third. The Stanford
entries failed to place in the hammer
throw, Owen being the only one to
qualify for the finals.
Stanford Wins Relay.
California's expectations were ov
erthrown in the relay, which was
captured by the Stanford team in
3:27.1, after a close and exciting race
which kept the rooters on their feet
from the start. Morris ran the first
lap, finishing about two yards behind
Fish, while McNealv increased the
California lead to eight yards in a
hard race with Coonan. Starting on
the third lap with this handicap.
Brown pulled away from Fiske in
the final stretch and sent Wyman
away with a lead of five yards, which
Jones never cut down, and the Stan
ford runner finished with a lead of
fifteen yards.
Tie in Low Hurdles.
In the 220-yard hurdles llorton
and .lohns. of California, tied for
first place with Morris third. This
was a close race all the way and the
two men went over the last hurdles
together and finished in 25.2. The
high hurdles proved a victory for
California with Cowles first and Ed
wards second. Peaslee was a good

third in this event.

In a meet where nearly every event
developed a reversal of form or a
mishap which completely upset all
previous calculations, California was
victorious over the Cardinal this af
ternoon. though the shattered Stan
ford team put up a game fight and
the final score was kept in doubt
until the field events. The perform
ances throughout the meet were high
class and five intercollegiate records
were broken in the course of the
afternoon. Bradford established a
new mark of 4:32.3 in the mile, low
ering the previous mark by a second,
Brown took three-fifths off the for
mer time in the half by running the
two laps in 1:59.2. Stanton's time
of 50.2 in the quarter is three-fifths
better than the record. Horton and
Johns took one-fifth off the 220-yard
hurdle time by getting over the
sticks in 25. 2. while the Stanford
relay team, composed of Morris, Coo
nan, Brown and Wyman, brought a
day of record-breaking races to a
fitting close by running the relay in
3:27.1.
Stanford's calculations were entire
ly upset and the chances of a Car
dinal victory almost ruined early in

iho meet, when Reed, an apparent
winner in the hundred, snapped the
tendon which was injured some
weeks ago and suffered a break
down which shut him out of that race
and prevented him from entering the
220-yard dash, where he was expect
ed to win from the California entries.
In spite of this almost irreparable
misfortune, the outcome might still
have been favorable for the Stanford
team if California had not taken
some unexpected points when Nash
was forced out of the two-mile run
by a sudden attack of heart failure
which for a time threatened to re
sult. seriously.
For the Cardinal, Brown and Hor
ton were the stars of the meet. The
Freshman runner not only displayed
wonderful speed, but by running
three hard races, two of which he
ran in record time, he showed an
amount of endurance which marks
him as one of the greatest runners
that, lias ever represented Stanford.
Horton had fast men against, him
in the hurdles, but secured an even
break with Johns in the 220-yard
event, in record time, besides win
ning the shot from Munn with a toss
of 4 2 feet, 10 inches.
Bradford did all that was expected
of him in the mile and also ran a
good race in the half, while Wyman's
performances in both the quarter and
final lap of the relay mark him as
one of the fastest athletes on the
team.
Stanton and Munn deserve the cre
dit for the success of the Blue and
Gold. The California captain showed
a wonderful sprint in the quarter and
also ran a good hundred in 10.1,
equalling the intercollegiate record.
Munn was handicapped by an injured
heel which kept him out of the
pole vault, and the broad jump,
though he did good work in the shot
and high jump.
Bradford Wins the Mile.
Stanford started off tlie first event
by taking six points, Bradford win
ning the mile in record time with
De Mamiel, of California, second and
McGregor third. It was Bradford's
finish that proved too much for the
California runner, who had kept be
hind until the last. lap. Maundrell
entered the event at. the last minute,
but his injury proved too serious
and he was unable to run anywhere
near his usual form. Bradford ran
a beautiful race and finished about
two yards ahead of De Mamiel, the
California man having a hard fight,
with McGregor, who finished a close
third. Porter ran a game race for
Stanford, but the pace proved too
fast at the finish.
(Quarter Goes to Stanton.
As was expected, the quarter

proved to be one of the hardest
fought races of the day, and Captain
Stanton, of California, beat out
Brown and Wyman in a driving fin
ish. winning in 50.2. Wyman took
the pole at the start and led around
the first turn and along the back
stretch, with Stanton second 011 the
turn and Brown third. Along the
back stretch Brown passed Stanton
it iid the three leaders held these po
sitions until the last, turn, when
Stanton began to close up on the
Cardinal runners and in a gruelling
race down the stretch the speedy
California runner crossed the tape in
the lead.
111-own Wins Past Half.
The half-mile developed one of the
fastest races of the day and Brown
proved that he is one of the great
est runners ever seen 011 the Coast,
by taking first in 1:59.2. Dowd, of
California drew the pole, but Lee, of
Stanford, took the lead. Brown and
Bradford were fourth and fifth on
the first turn but Bradford picked
up and took the lead in the second
turn, while Brown still stayed back
as he was closed in by California
runners. On the final sprint Brown
showed his wonderful speed and won
by a good margin. Dowd and Do
zier took second and third, and Brad
ford, who looked to have second
place, was cut off on the straight
away by the California runners.

In the sprints Stanford's hopes
were shattered hy the breakdown of
Reed in the hundred, whose injured
leg went back on him and he was
11 mihlo to finish in this event and
