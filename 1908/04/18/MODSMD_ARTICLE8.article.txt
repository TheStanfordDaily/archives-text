# WILL NAME CREW NEXT WEEK.
## Tides Compel Oarsmen To Go To Redwood Shortly After Noon. New Oars Have Arrived. 
### 
Coach Turner said this afternoon
that ihe crew would not be picked
before Wednesday. The men are all
working constantly and with admir
able spirit in face of the difficulties
which beset their training. Thursday
the varsity candidates went to Red
wood on the 12:12 train from Palo
Alto, in order to be at the course
when the tide was high. The Fresh
men were compelled to do this yes
terday in order to have the water
available for rowing. The squad
trained this morning in order to be
back in time to see the track meet.
The lasi hard training will be done
tomorrow. The men who go to Red
wood on the early train use the
eight-oared shell. When the remain
der of the squad gets there later in
the afternoon, eight, of them take
the larger shell and two man the
four-oared she'l with two men from
the eight who trained earlier. Thus
the two men who row in both boats
must do considerable more rowing
than the other oarsmen.
A shipment of eight, new oars ar
rived yesterday and will help the
men considerably in their training.
These oars will bo used by both
crews on the day of the regatta. The
arrival of these oars will allow the
use of the pair-oar at the same time
as the two other shells are being
used, whereas formerly there were
not enough oars to allow this.
