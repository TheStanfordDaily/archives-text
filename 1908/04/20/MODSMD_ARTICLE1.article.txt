# LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS
## NEARLY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS NOW ON HAND. Manager Knupp and President Murphy Well Pleased With Progress of Canvass. 
### 
The contributions to the fund
which is being raised to send the
picked team to Chicago are being re
ceived in large numbers by Graduate
Manager Knupp and Student Body
President A. A. Murphy. At the
present time $577 has been promised
the plan and it is estimated that this
total will be swelled rapidly to reach
the entire amount needed. The
"smokerless smoker" and the produc
tion of the "Egyptian Princess" by
the Schubert Club are expected to net
several hundred dollars. In San
Francisco the alumni are enthusiastic
over the project, in spite of the de
feat of Saturday, and the collections
will be continued with unabated en
ergy.
The Palo Alto merchants have been
generous and will aid still farther.
The Senior class has contributed the
most up to date with the gift of $200
while the 1909 class and C. P. Holt,
'02, of the University of California,
have each given $50. President Mur
phy has been collecting among the
Faculty, but the extent of the money
received is not known.
