The report made by Manager
Knupp today in regard to the con
tributions toward a fund for sending
a track team to the Conference Meet
at Chicago show that there is strong
support of such a movement. This
is a most encouraging fact and one
which we believe is fully justified.
The fact that we lost the intercollegi
ate meet on Saturday by a narrow
margin should in no way change the
attitude toward the Chicago trip. We
have some of the best athletes in col
lege at present who have ever repre
sented the Cardinal and the team
which we can send to Chicago would
be a credit to the University. There
will be many benefits derived from
such a trip and the good that will
be done the University by sending a
strong team to compete with the
Middle Western universities is evi
dent. It will bring Stanford into
closer touch with these institutions
and will also add to the athletic pres
tige of the University. In addition
to this fact it will show the outside
world that Stanford has a Student
Body that is able to survive such a
crisis as we have passed through and
still have the spirit which was mani
fested last Saturday against great
odds. It is the duty of every loyal
supporter of Stanford to assist in this
work of raising funds for our track
team to go East.
