### 
Professor A. L. Kroeber, director
of archaeological research for the
University of California, gave a lec
ture in chapel Friday afternoon on
the "Problems of American Archaeol
ogy." Dr. Kroeber first described
some of the work done in California,
and stated that evidence is being
gradually accumulated which tends
to show that man has lived on the
coast for a much longer time than n
ordinarily thoughtâ€”;>roba'.ly si ce
the Quaternary age.
Professor Kroeber then described
;:i some detail the work which l as
been done in Peril, showing that civ
ilization there was perhaps at its
highest pitch about the time of the
birth of Christ. Consequently, its
beginnings go back to the remotest
antiquity.
