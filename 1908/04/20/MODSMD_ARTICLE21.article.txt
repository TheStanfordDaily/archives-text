At the regular meeting of Ihe
Schubert Club at the Gamma Phi
Beta house, it was decided to give

era, with the exception of one-fourth,
to the Women's Club House fund
and the fund for sending the track
team East. Because of this, Sword
and Sandals have very kindly of
fered the use of their scenery free.
Rehearsals are being held daily
and the work is progressing rapidly.
