# Stanford Team Wins the Debate.
## L. Craven, '09, G.D. Ferrell. '09, and J.E. Shelton, '10, Receive a Unanimous Decision. 
### 
The fifteenth annual intercollegiate
debate with the University of Cali
fornia, which was held in Assembly
Hall last Saturday evening, resulted
in a splendid victory for the Stan
ford team, composed of L. Craven,
'09, G. D. Ferrell, '09, and J. E.
Shelton, '10. M. E. Harrison, '08,
C. Kaseh, '11, and S. Macneil, '08,
the California team, upheld the af
firmative side of the question, "Re
solved, That labor unions are justi
fied in insisting, through all lawful
means at their disposal, on the closed
shop." The decision of the judges,
who were President M. E. Dailey, of
the San Jose State Normal School,
Bishop W. F. Nichols and Beverly L.
Hodgehead, was unanimous in favor
of Stanford.
The character of the debate was of
an exceptionally high order and the
work of the Stanford team, in par
ticular, was noteworthy. Never has
Stanford been represented bv a more
well-balanced trio, the unanswerable
logic of whose argument and the
compelling force of whose delivery
completely overwhelmed their oppo
nents. While the Californians were
all able speakers, they failed to have
the strong team work and practical,
convincing arguments that marked
the speeches of their adversaries.
Craven, Ferrell and Shelton, all
proved themselves to be debaters of
more than ordinary skill and excel
lence, and Shelton's speech was a
masterly refutation of the affirmative
contentions. McNeil was the most
finished of the California debaters.
Harrison opened the discussion for
the affirmative and he prefaced his
argument with an interpretation of
the question in which he endeavored
to confine the debate within theoreti
cal limits. Admitting certain evils
in the modern labor union, he con
tended that the benefits more than
outweighed them and that the closed
shop was essential to a continuance
of these benefits.
Craven, the opening speaker for
the negative, in a convincing, logi
cal manner showed that the closed
shop gives an absolute, dictatorial
nower into the hands of the union.

a power that has invariably been det
rimental to the public welfare where
exercised. He cited numerous in
cidents of unions that have secured
all of the legitimate aims of union
ism, including collective bargaining,
a steady growth and industrial peace,
without the closed shop.
Kasch, the second Californian to
mount the platform, asserted that
without the closed shop, the laborer
is deprived of "the real right of free
contract" and as an individual, lack
ing "collective bargaining," is at the
mercy of the selfish employer. Fer
rell, in continuing the negative, dealt
with the question in its broadest
phase and he proved effectively that
the closed shop was equally undesir
able from the union, non-union and
public standpoints. Inevitably, he
maintained, the closed shop is abused
by unscrupulous union leaders as ac
tual practice has so clearly demon
strated in such cities as San Fran
cisco and Chicago. Macneil recap
itulated the arguments of the affirm
ative and assured the audience that
the closed shop had been proven nec
essary to the existence of unions. He
asked the judges to differentiate be
tween the "closed shop" and the
"closed union."
The negative was closed by Shel
ton with a brilliant summary of the
argument. He contended that the
closed shop must by its very nature
result in the disintegration of the
unions because it either incurs the
bitter enmity of non-union laborers
or recruits a membership that is se
cretly antagonistic to unionism. Un
der the closed shop, moreover, mem
bership in a union, not efficiency, is
the factor which aids laborers in se
curing work.
President Jordan presided over the
meeeting and introduced the speak
ers. The alternates, D. C. Boyd, of
Stanford, and J. Robinson, of Cali
fornia, were the timers.
The result of the debate on Satur
day night makes the eighth Cardinal
victory in intercollegiate debating,
while Californi.a has won seven de
bates.

ative and assured the audience that
the closed shop had been proven nec
essary to the existence of unions. He
asked the judges to differentiate be
tween the "closed shop" and the
"closed union."
The negative was closed by Shel
ton with a brilliant summary of the
argument. He contended that the
closed shop must by its very nature
result in the disintegration of the
unions because it either incurs the
bitter enmity of non-union laborers
or recruits a membership that is se
cretly antagonistic to unionism. Un
der the closed shop, moreover, mem
bership in a union, not efficiency, is
the factor which aids laborers in se
curing work.
President Jordan presided over the
meeeting and introduced the speak
ers. The alternates, D. C. Boyd, of
Stanford, and J. Robinson, of Cali
fornia, were the timers.
The result of the debate on Satur
day night makes the eighth Cardinal
victory in intercollegiate debating,
while Californi.a has won seven de
bates.
The fifteenth annual intercollegiate
debate with the University of Cali
fornia, which was held in Assembly
Hall last Saturday evening, resulted
in a splendid victory for the Stan
ford team, composed of L. Craven,
'09, G. D. Ferrell, '09, and J. E.
Shelton, '10. M. E. Harrison, '08,
C. Kaseh, '11, and S. Macneil, '08,
the California team, upheld the af
firmative side of the question, "Re
solved, That labor unions are justi
fied in insisting, through all lawful
means at their disposal, on the closed
shop." The decision of the judges,
who were President M. E. Dailey, of
the San Jose State Normal School,
Bishop W. F. Nichols and Beverly L.
Hodgehead, was unanimous in favor
of Stanford.
The character of the debate was of
an exceptionally high order and the
work of the Stanford team, in par
ticular, was noteworthy. Never has
Stanford been represented bv a more
well-balanced trio, the unanswerable
logic of whose argument and the
compelling force of whose delivery
completely overwhelmed their oppo
nents. While the Californians were
all able speakers, they failed to have
the strong team work and practical,
convincing arguments that marked
the speeches of their adversaries.
Craven, Ferrell and Shelton, all
proved themselves to be debaters of
more than ordinary skill and excel
lence, and Shelton's speech was a
masterly refutation of the affirmative
contentions. McNeil was the most
finished of the California debaters.
Harrison opened the discussion for
the affirmative and he prefaced his
argument with an interpretation of
the question in which he endeavored
to confine the debate within theoreti
cal limits. Admitting certain evils
in the modern labor union, he con
tended that the benefits more than
outweighed them and that the closed
shop was essential to a continuance
of these benefits.
Craven, the opening speaker for
the negative, in a convincing, logi
cal manner showed that the closed
shop gives an absolute, dictatorial
nower into the hands of the union.

a power that has invariably been det
rimental to the public welfare where
exercised. He cited numerous in
cidents of unions that have secured
all of the legitimate aims of union
ism, including collective bargaining,
a steady growth and industrial peace,
without the closed shop.
Kasch, the second Californian to
mount the platform, asserted that
without the closed shop, the laborer
is deprived of "the real right of free
contract" and as an individual, lack
ing "collective bargaining," is at the
mercy of the selfish employer. Fer
rell, in continuing the negative, dealt
with the question in its broadest
phase and he proved effectively that
the closed shop was equally undesir
able from the union, non-union and
public standpoints. Inevitably, he
maintained, the closed shop is abused
by unscrupulous union leaders as ac
tual practice has so clearly demon
strated in such cities as San Fran
cisco and Chicago. Macneil recap
itulated the arguments of the affirm
ative and assured the audience that
the closed shop had been proven nec
essary to the existence of unions. He
asked the judges to differentiate be

"closed union."
