## STANFORD ATHLETES UP TO CONFERENCE FIGURES. Performance In Saturday's Meet Surpass Middle Western Records in Some Events. 
### 
In view of the apparent certainty
that Stanford will be represented at
the Conference Meet this year it is
interesting to note some comparisons
between the records made at the In
tercollegiate meet on Saturday and
those of the Conference Meet last
June. Since (he withdrawal of Mich
igan from the Conference there has
been a deterioration in some of the
events and last year, when the meet
was held in Chicago, a Stanford team
would have been able to cut consider
able figure. In last year's Confer
ence the mile was won by Lyon of
Chicago in 4:37; the broad-jump
went to Jenkins of Illinois at 21 feet,
5 inches; Slaght. of Grinnell took the
high-jump at 5 feet, 8 inches; while
the pole vault was won at 11 feet,
4 inches. In all these events the
performances of the Cardinal ath
letes on Saturday were superior.
Myers of Wisconsin won the half-mile
in 1-4 of a second over two minutes,
and Brown did under two minutes
on Saturday. The time in both hur
dle events at Chicago last June were
equalled in the meet here Saturday.
The relay time on Saturday was su
perior to Conference time.
In practically every event but the
hammer-throw Stanford could send a
team to the Conference Meet that
would be the equal of the Middle
Western athletes. On account of the
large number of colleges represented,
and owing to the fact that some of
the smaller colleges only have one
or two star men, it requires but a
comparatively small number of points
to win the Conference. Judging
from the work of the Stanford ath
letes in Saturday's contest and the
records that they have made through
out tho season, it is more than likely
that the Cardinal team could carry
off several first places in the Confer
ence Meet and have a good chance
of winning the contest.
As there have not yet been any
big outdoor meets among the Middle
Western colleges it is impossible at
present to secure a correct line on
the material that will compete in this
year's Conference.
