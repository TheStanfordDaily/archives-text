The combined rally and smoker in
Assembly Hall tomorrow night should
be attended by every member of the
Student Body, as the receipts from
this affair will be added to
the fund for sending a track
team to Chicago. As the Faculty,
alumni, and Palo Alto merchants are
contributing liberally to this cause, it
is certainly essential that the stu
dents should support, the movement
and attend the smoker tomorrow
night. In addition to being a rally
for the Cardinal athletes it will be a
most interesting entertainment and
the committee in charge has prepared
a program that will be attractive
throughout. We feel that every stu
dent should support the effort to
raise money for the Eastern trip and
the affair tomorrow night will afford
a chance to show that we appreciate
the work of the track team on Sat
urday, and that we are behind the
Cardinal representatives who will
meet California next Saturday.
