j tion of names of many members of

I few members of the Faculty, reports j
I that the enthusiasm among the Fac- j
I ulty men is in many instances as •
| great as among the undergraduates, j
: The professors have willingly con- j
' tributed $5 apiece, and of the few
visited Murphy has promises for $40
' and expects to be able to get prom
ises for several times this amount.
This support upon the part of the
i Faculty is highly encouraging to the
collectors and gives additional evi
dence that the proposition of sending
the team East is sure to meet with
the required support. Manager
