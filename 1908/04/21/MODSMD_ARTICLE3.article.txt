# TO NOMINATE OFFICERS
## STUDENT BODY WILL MEET TOMORROW AFTERNOON. Proposed Amendments to Constitution Come Up for Consideration. Dearth of Candidates. 
### 
The members of the Student Body
will gather in the Chapel tomorrow
afternoon at 1:15 for the purpose of
voting on the amendments to the
constitution, which were submitted a
week ago by a committee appointed
for that purpose, and to make nom
inations for next year's officers. The
proposed amendment contemplates a
change in the method of constitut
ing l lie Executive Committee.
There seems to be a decided lack
of interest towards the various po
litical offices of the Student Body at
present, as compared with former
years, and the candidates have been
rather slow in announcing them
selves. The graduate managership
will, from present indications, de
velop the hottest contest, as it is
pretty definitely understood that the
present incumbent will retire at the
end of the semester to enter the of
fices of a well-known law firm, thus
affording several possible candidates
an even opportunity to enter the con
test for the position. There have al
ready been several names mention
ed for the place, but the real candi
dates will be known tomorrow. No
condidates have thus far appeared
for vice-president or secretary of the
Associated Students and only one is
prominently mentioned for president.
In the election held a year ago, the
latter office provoked one of the most
intense political battles that has been
held on the Campus in recent years.
Probably only one candidate will
be nominated for editor and one for
business manager of the"Daily Palo
Alto" and these offices would in this
event go uncontested. Two students
have announced themselves as
aspirants for the business man
agership of the "Sequoia," and
there is also a slight possi
mility of a two-entry race for the
editorship of that magazine. The cus
tomary interest will undoubtedly be
shown in the candidates for the Exec
utive Committee, although so far no
one has signified any definite inten
tion of running for it. The election
itself will be held a week from to
morrow.
