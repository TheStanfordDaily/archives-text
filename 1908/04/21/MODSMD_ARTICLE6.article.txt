# GREAT CONTESTS HERE
## TRY-OUTS FOR OLYMPIAN GAMES ON OUR TRACK. Leading Coast Athletes Will Compete Here On May 9, for Places on London Team. 
### 
Preparations for the Olympic try
outs to be held on the Stanford
track on May 9, are nearing comple
tion at the hands of the committee
in charge, headed by S. S. Peixotto,
of San Francisco, and entry blanks
for the meet will be mailed to all
the prominent athletes of the Coast
within a few days. This Pacific
Coast try-out is open to all regis
tered amateur athletes of the Paci
fic Association and the Pacific North
west Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union of the United States,
registration being made with S. S.
Peixotto, 458 Guerrero street, San
Francisco, prior to May 1, upon the
payment of an entrance fee of $2.00
per man for each event entered.
In the selection of the team which
will represent this country at Lon
don, the executive committee will be
largely influenced by the perform
ances of those competing in the try
outs, but is not bound to select ev
ery or any athlete who wins in the
try-outs and may, if occasion seems
to justify, select a person for the
team who was unable to compete
in the try-outs if his previous per
formance has been good. As the
distances are run in metres instead
of yards, the events will seem odd,
but the actual difference in distance
is in most cases slight. These races
will be held under the same con
ditions that govern the great games
held at Paris, St. Louis and Athens,
and, as they have never been run
on the Coast before, should attract
a large crowd to the Campus for the
meet. The champion athletes of the
whole Pacific Coast and tlie North
west will be seen in competition and
should furnish performances of the
highest class ever seen in the West.
The committee has received sev
eral entries for the 15-mile Mara
thon race which will probably have
both the start and finish at the oval.
Other unusual events which will be
held here, if there are any entries,
include a 3200 metre steeplechase;
standing high jump; hop, step and
jump and discus throw. The lo
cal committee will not hold any try
outs in the javelin throw, three
mile team race or relay.
The events which will be held are
100 metres (109.3 yds.); 200 met
res; 400 metres; 800 metres; 1500
metres; 110 metres hurdles; 400
metres hurdles; 3200 metres steep
lechase; 8 kilometers run (5 miles);

jump; hop, step and jump; pole
jump; throwing the hammer, put
ting the weight; marathon race.
