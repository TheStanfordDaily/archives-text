# CREW IS WORKING WELL
## COACH TURNER HAS DEVELOPED A STRONG SQUAD. Party of Stanford Watch the Varsity Candidates Train at Redwood City. 
### 
A party including Coach Turner,
Manager Knupp, a representative of
the"Daily Palo Alto," a photog
rapher and two members of the row
ing squad, watched the training of
the eight varsity candidates on the
Redwood City course yesterday after
noon. The party was carried over
the course in a launch which was se
cured through the courtesy of W. H.
Hanson, of Redwood City., and was
kept at close range with the oars
men during their afternoon's work.
The men who are now vowing for
the Varsity are candidates for the
positions as follows: stroke, Patrick;
7, Malone; G, Wondries; 5, Cole; 4,
Hatch, Robinson; 3, Vose; 2, Ben
son, Hatch; bow, Reynolds. Freshmen
are rowing as follows: stroke, Cham
berlain; 7, Day; 6, Dole; 5, Killian;
4, Smith; 3, Tittle; 2, Visel; bow,
Acker, Leeds. Coach Turner will an
nounce the crews tomorrow after
noon.
A high wind which blew all dur
ing yesterday afternoon greatly hin
dered the work done by both crews,
the Freshman candidates having fol
lowed the Varsity men on the 4:57
train from Palo Alto. The Varsity
candidates were in the boat and row
ing by 4 o'clock. The men went
over the three-mile course which
they have been using for their train
ing and then rowed back. Coach
Turner, who has often taken the
coxswain's position in the shell, had
an excellent opportunity to judge the
efforts of the men from the side of
the shell, as the launch was always
in hailing distance. Guerna held the
tiller ropes.
The crew was at. a great disad
vantage but handled the shell ad
mirably. The men pull a strong and
steady stroke, and work well togeth
er. Patrick, who pulls the stroke
oar, keeps the men working at a
good pace and is a leader whom
they follow steadily. In the f;iee
of the adverse conditions which have
beset the training of the crew, Coach
Turner has developed a squad which
should make a most creditable show
ing against the oarsmen of the Blue
and Gold. The Freshman candidates
took the 3:03 train to Redwood to
day and used the shell before the ar
rival of the Varsity candates.
