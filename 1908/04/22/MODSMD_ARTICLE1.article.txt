## THREE MORE STUDENTS RECEIVE SEVERE PENALTY. E.N. Smith, Former Editor of "Sequoia, "Cannot Return to the University Again. 
### 
The recent meetings of the Student
Affairs Committee have resulted in
(he inlliction of severe penalties up
on three more prominent students.
Two students have been denied the
privilege of re-registering in the Uni
versity by the Clark committee and
another student has been indefinitely
suspended. The notice of the com
mittee's most recent actions, as pub
lished today, follows:
"At a meeting of the Student Af
fairs Committee, held today, the fol
lowing actions were taken:
"The privilege of re-registration
was permanently withdrawn from
the editor of the 'Sequoia' for his
abuse of the privilege of the college
press in his editorial of the last
issue of that periodical.
For violation of the regulations
governing students under suspen
sion, a student will not be permitted
to re-register in the University.
(Signed) "A. B. Clark,
"Chairman."
"At a meeting of the Student Af
fairs Committee held Monday, April
20, a. student was indefinitely sus
pended from the University for hav
ing been noticeably under the influ
ence of liquor on the Campus on the
evening of April 17.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK,
"Chairman."
E. N. Smith, ex-'OB, formerly edi
tor of the "Sequoia," has been de
nied the privilege or re-registering
in the University because of the edi
torials he published in the last is
sue of the "Sequoia," which severely
criticised the Student Affairs Com
mittee for its recent action in regard
to the forty-one suspended students.
The editorials in the "Sequoia" were
the sharpest comments that have
been made upon the committee, and
as Smith was not registered in col
lege at the time the magazine ap
peared, the committee has visited
the only possible penalty upon him.
At present Smith is in business in
San Francisco.
Chairman Clark Interviewed.
When interviewed this afternoon,
Chairman Clark, of the Student Af- |
fairs Committee, had nothing to say
in regard to the most recent actions i
of his committee. However, as the
committee was not. in session this
afternoon, it, is presumed that there
are no further cases under immedi
ate consideration, although Profes
sor Clark was reticent upon the sub
ject and did not intimate whether
there were other matters before the
committee or not.
