# IBSEN'S ASSOCIATE TO READ.
## Dramatic Rendition of "Peer Gynt" By Personal Friend of Ibsen's. 
### 
Unusual interest attaches itself to
the interpretative reading of Ibsen's
"Peer Gynt" by Mr. Ole Bang, which
is announced for the Assembly Hall
on Thursday evening, April 23rd. Mr.
Bang is not only a Norwegian him
self, a countryman of the great dra
matist, but has given his readings in
the presence of Ibsen and has re
ceived from him directly the ideas of
the author about his works.
This is also true of Grieg's version
of the Peer Gynt Suite that Mr. Bang
will use in interpreting the play, as
it was the famous composer's per
sonal wish that Mr. Bang should
make use of a trio in the Peer Gynt
Suite that is particularly well adapted
to the drama.
Mr. Bang, who is a master of the
English language, )is well as his
own, uses the translation of the cele
brated English critic, Mr. William
Archer, who describes him as "a
dramatic reader of remarkable abil
ity." His purpose is to give the chief
scenes of the play directly, with all
their color and atmosphere together
with the national spirit, accentuated
by the essentially Norwegian music.
Mr. Bang's recital will consist of a
running sketch of the plot of the
piece, augmented by dramatic inter
pretations of the most characteristic
selections, He gave his reading in
Lyric Hall, San Francisco, last Sun
day before a highly appreciative au
dience.
