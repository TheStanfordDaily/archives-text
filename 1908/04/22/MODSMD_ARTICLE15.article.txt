## Interesting Comment In Regard to Those Who Disturb Symphony Concerts. 
### 
To the Editor of the D. P. A.
Dear Sir:—lf it should be that
your columns are open to the ency
clicals of "knockers" we desire to
avail ourself thereof.
We are in an indifferent frame of
mind resulting from a commixture of
a great pleasure and a small pain.
Thus:
When Richard Wagner directed
the performance of his work at Bey
reuth he would tolerate none of the
distracting, nerve-racking nuisance
commonly known as applause. He
knew—and surely we should allow
him a better knowledge than our
selves—that this thing was as cruel
ly, viciously out of place in a musi
cal interpretation as in the sacramen
tal service at the altar of a church;
and we submit that a university town
might with grace and becoming vir
tue take a long-awaited lead in al
lowing such an infliction to fall into
a decorous obsolescence.
Applause has its place. And it is
precisely at the annual minstrel
show that it should be sought. We
ourselves have a most felicitous
war-whoop which wo keep in gener
ous and solemn pickle for hog-kill
ings and similar occasions, but which
we have always felt called upon to
discontinue in the concert hall out
of deference to, and fear of, the po
lice: therefore, we take what liberty
may be necessary in suggesting that
the most significant item that man
agements could place upon their pro
grams would be a request that the
audience kindly refrain from making
a disturbance between the move
ments of a symphony.
But this is not entirely a knock.
We are waiting in all humility to
say that if Stanford has one citizen

to honor it is the gentle man who
led the orchestra at the church last
night. If there be anything subtle, if
there be anything feminine, if there
be anything spiritual in our gro
tesquely material life, it is a Chopin
or a Tschaikowski waltz; and it is
just in the midst of such a delicate
and inspiring mystery that we object
to Noise. Nevertheless, we must say
that we do not expect to readily for
get the pleasure which we got from
one of these, —an item in a most ad
mirable and most eloquently render
ed musical evening.
We desire to convey our sincere
appreciation of these concerts and
our wish that they might become as
frequent as they are excellent.
We are, sir,
CONSTANT READER.
