# AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED
## MANNER OF ELECTING EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CHANGED. Majority of Candidates For Offices Will Be Unopposed.—Contest for Treasurer. 
### 
The annual meeting of the Stu
dent Body, held in the University
Chapel this afternoon, was one of the
quietest gatherings of the kind that
has ever taken place. The nomina
tions for the various offices within
the gift of the students disclosed
none of the keen competition that
has marked the contests for these
positions in former years, and the
election, which is scheduled for a
week from today, will not serve to
arouse unusual interest. Two candi
dates were nominated for the import
ant position of graduate manager,
and three nominations for the Ex
ecutive Committee were made from
each of the upper classes. Aside
from these offices, 110 contest will re
sult from today's nominations.
President A. A. Murphy, of the
Associated Students, called the meet
ing to order and before presenting
the new amendment, to the students
for a vote he explained the purpose
of its framers at length. Under the
provisions of the amendment, the Ex
ecutive Committee will at all timefe
have at least two members who are
thoroughly familiar with the rou
' tine duties of that body. This will
j remove the difficulty of starting each
| year with an entirely new commit
tee, none of the members of which
have had previous experience in di
recting Student Body affairs. The
