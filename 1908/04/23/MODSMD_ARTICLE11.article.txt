It will be welcome news to tlie
Student Body that a University holi
day has been announced for May 6,
the day upon which the great fleet
is scheduled to arrive in San Fran
cisco Bay. Although there has been
considerable speculation in the Stu
dent Body in regard to the possib
ility of postponing the examinations
for a few days, on account of the
celebration in San Francisco on May
6, 7 and 8, it now appears that the
day the fleet arrives will be our only
holiday. Since our examinations
prevent the students from witnessing
the review and parade, the oppor
tunity of viewing the arrival of the
fleet is certainly appreciated by the
members of the Student Body. This
will undoubtedly be one of the great
est events that has ever taken place
upon the Coast, and every student
is glad to have the chance to attend
a patriotic occasion of this kind.
We sincerely regret that our exam
inations schedule should deprive us
of witnessing the other events con
nected with the reception of the
fleet.
