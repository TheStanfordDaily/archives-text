The election of H. L. Horton, '08,
to lead the track team next season
insures a bright prospect for the
Cardinal athletes. Horton is a relia
ble performer himself, a man of ex
perience upon the track, and is at
the same time a leader in whom the
Student Body has the utmost confi
dence. We feel sure that under
"his leadership Stanford will have a
successful year on the track.
