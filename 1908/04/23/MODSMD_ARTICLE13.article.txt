# German Club Meets.

### 
The German Club met last night
at the home of Charles Reining, '08.
The girls of the club gave a clever
take-off on the German department,
impersonating several of the pro
fessors. Later in the evening Miss
Gabel played a piano solo, and Mrs.
Stuart rendered some German songs.
