The annual statistics of the Uni
versity of Paris, just published, show
that of a total number of 16,609 stu
dents admitted to the faculties of
law, medicine, science, arts and phar
macy, 2,634, or about one-sixth, were
foreigners. Of these, 1,117 were wo
men students. Although there are
many American students in Paris,
they are almost entirely confined to
art or music. Both at the Ecole Na
tionale des Beaux Arts and the pri
vate academies of painting, such as
Julian's, Americans easily outnumber
students of other nationalities.
