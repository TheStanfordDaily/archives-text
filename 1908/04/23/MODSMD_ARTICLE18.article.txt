The San Francisco Stanford Club,
which has a membership of over two
hundred Stanford men, will hold a
"jinks" tomorrow night in the new
club quarters at the northeast corner
of Kearney and Post streets, San
Francisco. This will be the first af
fair ot" the kind in the new home of
the club, which is located in one of
the most recently constructed build
ings in the downtown district. The
club has commodious quarters and
the various contributions toward fit
ting up the club-rooms has resulted
in the establishment of a most com
fortable meeting place. Athletic pic
tures and college pennants have been
contributed and these gifts from the
club members will continue until the
San Francisco Club quarters will be
among the most artistic of any Stan
ford club in the country.
Among the members of the club
are practically all the well-known
graduates who are now residing in
San Francisco or the vicinity and
the "jinks" tomorrow night promise
to be most entertaining. It is prob
able that Charles K. Field, '95, will
act as toastmaster, as he has acted in
this capacity with great success at
the previous affairs of the club. No
regular program has been arranged,
but several speeches and various
songs and "stunts" will be given.
As the regatta and the third inter
collegiate baseball game take place
on Saturday, it. is expected that there
will be a number of students in at
tendance at the "jinks" tomorrow
night, and all undergraduates are
welcome.
