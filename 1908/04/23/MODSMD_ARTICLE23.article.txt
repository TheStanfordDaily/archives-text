# SMOKER IS PROFITABLE
## INTERESTING ENTERTAINMENT NETS $131.45 FOR TEAM. Couch Presley and President Murphy Address Students at Enthusiastic Rally. 
### 
Success attended the efforts of the
yell-leaders and the committee in
charge in arranging the combined
smoker and rally held in Assembly
Hall last evening. Coach Presley and
President A. A. Murphy were the
speakers at the rally. The crews
and the baseball team, all of which
will compete against the athletes of
the Blue and Gold next Saturday,
were given a rousing send-off. The
music, athletic bouts and "stunts"
appealed greatly to the appreciative
audience. A profit of $131.45 was
made, the expenses being $14.10.
The University Band started the
festivities and the crews and the base
ball team were cheered repeatedly,
as were the coaches. Coach Presley
said that no matter whether the
baseball team won the intercollegiate
series by a victory on Saturday or
not, every man on the team would
have done his utmost to win.
President Murphy of the Associat
ed Students, outlined the difficulties
which beset the training of the crews.
He first spoke of the loss of Coach
"Dan" Murphy through the latter's
prolonged illness. The time which
the crew candidates must take in
order to do their training at Red
wood, returning worn out (to the
Campus late in the evening, made
the work of the men very arduous.
Then the loss of their captain, one
of the strongest men in the boat,
left the crew in a very precarious po
sition. But training was continued
and now we have two good crews.
The entertainment for the benefit
of the eastern track team was great
ly enjoyed by the assemblage. The
University Orchestra, the Glee Club
and the Mandolin Club gave pleasing
selections, a medley of lines from
popular airs, sung by the Glee Club,
provoking great laughter. J. C. Ray,
'OS, rendered two excellent selec
tions on the violin and was accom
panied in a very creditable manner
by Mrs. F. C. Woodward. S. B. Dole,
'0 9. rendered a guitar solo and en
core. F. H. Bernard, 'OS, R. S. Kel
logg, '08, and C. B. Bradford, '09,
received an ovation in ' Resurrec
tion."
The first boxing match, between
.1. E. Elliott, '11, and M. E. Mitchell,
'11. was fast and also gave amuse
ment through the fact that the con
testants had their gloves dipped in
blacking. The match was declared a
draw. A. F. Meston, '10, and J. H.
Wiggins, '10. wrestled three interest
ing rounds, each man gaining a fall.
A. B. Cook, '10, and S. M. Bellah,
'10, had a fast three-round go, Bel
lah receiving the decision. The hea
vyweight match was put up by J.
O. Miller, 'OS, and D. Rutherford,
'09. Miller received the decision.
F. A. Adams, '10, had no easy task
disposing of C. H. Tallant, '11, who
was counted out by Referee J. R
Pemberton, '08. C. W. Mason, '10
acted as announcer. At the closf
of the program Ihe entire company
and audience sang "Come, .loin tin
Band." and "Hail, Stanford. Hail!"
