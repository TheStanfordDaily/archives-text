The report that some of the seats
for (ho Schubert Club production of
"The Egyptian Princess" have been
sold is entirely erroneous. The com
mittee wishes to announce that all
of the seats will be on sale tomor
row morning at eight, o'clock and
that, none of them will be disposed
of before that time.
