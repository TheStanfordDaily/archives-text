# ARRANGE FOR REGATTA
## KNUPP AND TURNER INTERVIEW RAILROAD OFFICIALS. Persons Leaving Palo Alto at 7:24 Will Have Plenty of Time to See Regatta. 
### 
Manager Knupp saw the officials
of the Southern Pacific in Palo Alto
this morning in regard to trans
portation to Sausalito. Persons who
wish to go from Palo Alto to view
the intercollegiate regatta next Sat
urday morning on Richardson's Bay
will have ample time to see both
races by leaving Palo Alto on the
7:24 train or on any train before
that time. This train will arrive
in San Francisco at 8:20, allowing
its passengers to catch the S:4r>
boat via the Sausalito ferry. The
boat will arrive in Sausalito at 9: If.
and the Varsity race will commence
sharply at 10 o'clock.
Coach Turner was in conference
this afternoon with representatives
of the Northwestern Pacific Rail
road. in order to make arrangements
for an observation train. Turner
informed Manager Knupp that if he
succeeded he would let Knupp know
by wire the results of his meeting
with the railroad officials. The rate
to Berkeley and return will be $1.10,
tickets good from 12:02 Friday un
til any time on Monday. The regu
lar round trip rate of 2"> cents be
tween San Francisco and Sausalito
will probably prevail. Manager
Snedigar, of the University of Cal
ifornia, was supposed to have made
arrangements for the observation
train. The railroad was to have
built bleachers on flat cars but gave
up the idea owing to the cost of
carrying out Ibis plan. The length
of time which the observation train
may be on the track will possibly
be a drawback to having if.
If Turner suceods, other cars will
probably be provided by the railroad
for the accommodation of those who
wish to see the race in this manner.
