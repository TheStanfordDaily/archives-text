At a meeting of the Sophomore
class this afternoon, $100 was voted
to the track fund for sending the
track team to the Conference Meet
in Chicago.
The advisability of ordering the
Junior Plugs was discussed and the
following committee was appointed,
to order the plugs before the end of
the present semester: C. H. Hails,
C. H. Benson, and W. P. Fuller, Jr.,
chairman.
The Junior Plug Ugly last year
did not come at the beginning of
the semester, so it is the intention
of the Sophomore class this year to
get the plugs by the time college
opens and have the Plug Ugly held
during the first few weeks of college.
