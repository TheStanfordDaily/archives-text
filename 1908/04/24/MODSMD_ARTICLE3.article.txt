# Great Annual Regatta Tomorrow
## Stanford Crews Are In Pine Condition For Contest With California On Richardson's Bay. 
### 
One of the most beautiful spec
tacles and fiercest contests afford
ed by intercollegiate athletics will
occur tomorrow morning when the
Varsity and Freshman eight-oared
crews will race on Richardson's Bay.
Both of the Stanford crews are in
the pink of condition, while the Var
sity that will row over the two and
a half mile course for the Blue and
Cold is the best crew California has
ever developed. California has a
husky bunch of oarsmen in her
Freshman crew, and their race will
probably be over a two-mile course.
The stretch of water for the race is
marked at Waldo Point for the
start. The crews will row towards
Sausalito, crossing the line near the
ferry slip. Tomorrow's regatta will
have the first intercollegiate Fresh
man eight-oared race rowed between
the two Universities, and the Varsity
crews will row eight men for the
second time.
Coach Turner says that the Var
sity race will be nip and tuck all
the way, the winning crew having
a small lead at the finish, but that
the Stanford men can probably turn
the tric|:. The Freshmen will sur
prise the Californians with the suc
cess of their efforts.
In height and weight. California
has an advantage in the Varsity
race, and her Freshmen outweigh
the Cardinal first-year men by three
pounds. There is a difference of
weights of the Varsity crews, and
the strength of the Cardinal oars
men will have to overcome the ad
vantage of their opponents' presum
ably greater pulling power.
If victory rests with the Car
dinal tomorrow, unusual credit will
he due to every man 011 the crews,
as it has been a most trying season.
When the call for crew men came,
Coach "Dan" Murphy, who brought
victory to the Cardinal last year,
was on his back in a hospital in San
Francisco. Murphy's absence during
the whole season has been a serious
drawback to the training of the men.
Their spirits were kept up during
the hard and long training period
not. a little by the continual hope
that lie would he able lo take charge
in the near future. It is probable
that Murphy will be able to get out
and see the race tomorrow .
Undaunted by the ansence of Mur
phy. however, F. W. Turner, '0 8,
took the men in charge and started
them at work according to Murphy's
methods. Within a few days, Cap
tain Gay returned from a vacation
trip, and assumed the leadership of
the squad. The ceaseless work of
training went 011 uninterrupted until
Captain Gay left the University. The
loss of their captain in the middle
of the season demoralized the spir
it of the men. but after a few days
they got back to work and have
been faithfully training up to the
present time, when all is in readi

ness for the race.
