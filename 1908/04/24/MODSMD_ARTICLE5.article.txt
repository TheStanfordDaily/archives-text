# READY FOR FINAL GAME
## STANFORD NINE MEETS BLUE AND GOLD TOMORROW. Opposing Varsities in Excellent Condition for Derisive Match of 1908 Series. 
### 
Whether victory or defeat will be
Stanford's in the intercollegiate
baseball series ot 1908 is to be d«-
cided on California Field tomorrow
afternoon, when the Blue and Gold
nine will cross bats with the Car
dinal team in the third and decid
ing game, each varsity 'having an
nexed one of the preceding matches.
The first ball will not be pitched un
til three o'clock, thus allowing those
who attend the regatta ample time
to journey to Berkeley.
Since their defeat of two weeks
ago at the hands of California, Cap
tain Kenton's men have been prac
ticing hard and faithfully, and as
a result should put up a fast exhib
ition tomorrow, notwithstanding
their crippled condition. The loss
of Sampson completely destroyed the
unity and combination of the infield,
but three weeks of conscientious
work has partially repaired the
damage.
Save for the substitution of Ear
nist for Reid in the Blue and Gold
right field, the same eighteen men
who fought the battle on April 11
will again compose the opposing
nines Saturday. The reliable Theile
will again be on the slab for the
Cardinal and will endeavor to make
his sixth intercollegiate contest with
California a victorious one. He is
in perfect shape and with Mitchell,
should form a superb battery. The
other seven Cardinal players are all
in the best of condition with the
exception c)" Fenton. A split finger
kept the Varsity captain out of the
shortstop position on Wednesday,
but the injury is not expected to
mar his work tomorrow, as it has
been healing with remarkable celer
ity.
The team will leave Palo Alto on
the 11:34 train, arriving at Ber
keley about 2 o'clock.
The line-ups follow:
Stanford —Tlieile, pitcher: Mitch
ell. catcher: Bell, first base; Owen,

ton, shortstop: Tallant, left field;
