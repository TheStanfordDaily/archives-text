Never have the Stanford athletes
trained under more discouraging cir
cumstances than during the present
season. Our crews and baseball
team have had their work inter
rupted and have lost strong men
from among their number. In spite
of these severe handicaps, the hard
training season has been fully com
pleted and tomorrow the crews and
the baseball team will meet Califor
nia in the decisive intercollegiate
contests. We believe that our base
ball team will bo able to carry off
the championship after the two close
games that have already been play
ed with honors even. In the crews
that will represent the Cardinal to
morrow we also have sincere confi
dence. Men who have gone through
a siege of hard training under such
extremely discouraging circumstan
ces as beset the oarsmen this year
have the right spirit and deserve to
win. We do not underestimate the
ability of our opponents and this
fact is the very reason why there
should be a strong contingent of
Stanford supporters at the regatta
and baseball game. Our athletes
wil be called upon to do their best
and the Student Body must sup
port them if victory is to be ours.
