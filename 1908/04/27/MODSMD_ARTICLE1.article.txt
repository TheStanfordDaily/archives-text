# ATHLETES TO COMPETE
## THIRTY-THREE SCHOOLS ENTER INTERSCHOLASTIC. Two Hundred and Twenty-One Athletes Will Compete Here Next Saturday. 
### 
The interseholastic track meet
which will be held on the Stanford
track next Saturday will, be an even
greater contest than the meet last
year in the number of schools and
athletes entered, and if the warm
weather continues the third annual
meet should prove one of the most
successful preparatory school com
petitions ever held. Thirty-three
schools have already sent in their en
try lists, making an aggregate of two
hundred and twenty-one athletes
who will compete for honors upon
the local cinder path and field. The
entries include the high schools of
the state, so that the competition
will no doubt develop some high
class performances.
On account of the large number
of entries, it will be necessary to
hold the preliminary heats of the
shorter races and the trials in the
field events in the morning, so that
tho afternoon events will not be un
necessarily prolonged. There will
be no admission charged in the mor
ning.
