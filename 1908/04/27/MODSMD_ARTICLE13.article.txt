## 
### 
The baseball series just completed,
from a financial point of view, has
been highly successful. In the last
game the largest crowd upon record
attended and the Stanford share of
the receipts amounts to $G6S, while
at the first game $222 was realized
and the second, held at Berkeley,
shows a return of $539.75. This
makes Stanford's total for the inter
collegiate games $1429, which is
practically net.
