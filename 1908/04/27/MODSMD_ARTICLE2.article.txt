# VARSITIES LOSE ON LAND AND WATER
## California Wins Sensational Twelve-Inning Game.---Freshman Oarsmen Are Victorious. 
### 
Shortstop Lewis, the fourth Cali
fornia butter in the twelfth inning,
drove a beautiful single along the
right-field foul line, scoring a sec
ond tally and winning for the Blue
and Gold the third and deciding
game of the 190S baseball series be
tween the varsity nines of Califor
nia and Stanford. For eleven in
nings the large and enthusiastic
crowd of 3500 people nervously
watched the battle of the pitchers,
off neither of whom the winning run
could be gained. But finally the fa
tal period came. For one moment
throughout the struggle Theile weak
ened, and the next instant the
match was lost and California had
added another triumph to her list
of recent intercollegiate victories.
Never before has a baseball game
between the two institutions boon
so closely and hotly waged as was
the one of Saturday." For one hun
dred and thirty-five minutes neither
nine could secure more than a single
tally and the result hung in the bal
ance. With one winning game regis
tered for each team by the low
score of 2 to 1, and with the tallies
one apiece, there was absolutely no
choice between the contending nines.
The climax to the magnificent ex
hibition was reached only in the
twelfth period. Solinskv, the first
Blue and Gold batter, found Theile
for ono of two extra-base hits of
the afternoon. The Cardinal twirl
er then hit Fielder Myers, leaving
the runners on first and second with
none out. Captain Jordan connected
for a long drive to deep left, which,
on leaving the bat, seemed good for
at least two bags. Tallant, how
ever. was in exactly the right posi
tion for the hit and fielded the fly
with ease, doubling Solinskv at sec
ond. The Stanford rooters breathed
more easily, but the worst was not
yet. over. Lewis, who next came to
the plate, planted a single in right,
well out of the reach of Rutledge,
and the fleet Myers just succeeded
in beating the throw to home, in
the latter half of the inning the
Stanford batters were retired in one
two-three order, and the game and
series were won and lost.
Stanford's sole tally was register
ed in the second, and four singles
were necessary for the score. Bell
hit safely but was caught stealing.
Ganong went out, but Wirt and
Theile both reached first on safe
ties, the former coming home on
Scott's two-bagger. California's ini
tial run was secured in the seventh,
when 11. Myers singled, advanced to
second on a sacrifice, took third on
a passed ball, and crossed the plate

After lowing in excellent form for
13 minutes and IS seconds in the in
tercollegiate regatta on Saturday
morning, the California varsity eight
crossed the finish line near the lower
end of Richardson's Bay a victor over
the Cardinal crew by three lengths
of clear water. The better of the
two crews won the race. However,
had it not. been for unlooked for
accidents in the Caidinal boat, Stan
ford would have been a closer sec
ond. The Freshmen turned the ta
bles on the Blue and Gold oarsmen
by defeating them handily with a
lead of four lengths. The time was
13 minutes and 28 seconds. Both
races were rowed over a course of
two and one-quarter miles. which
was shorter by a quarter of a mile
than last year's races.
At, ten o'clock both crews were
on the water. They rowed leisure
ly up the bay to the start. At 10:17
the sound of Starter F 1 . (r. Phillips'
pistol cracked over the smooth wa
ters and the two crews were off.
Stanford started the lace with 38
strokes to the minute, and California
with 39. A delay was caused to
tile Stanford boat when No. ."> lost his
sent. California shot, ahead a few
feet, and kept increasing her lead.
In tlie lirst Stanford caught a crab
and one of the oars jammed. Cali
fornia slowed down to 37 strokes.
Stanford slowed up a trifle. At. the
end of the first mile California was
leading by a length, and rowing 36.
During the next half mile, Califor
nia made another length on the Car
diiiiil oarsmen. Almost another
length was gained before the end ot
the second mile was reached by Cal
ifornia. Both crews kept between
36 and 38. At the beginning of the
last quarter California speeded up
to 3 9. The Stanford men gradually
quickened their stroke and were row
ing close to 3 9. But the lead of
California could not be overcome,
and the race was lost.
The Freshman crews manned the
shells after the necessary adjust
ments had been made and the boats
bailed out. At 10 minutes after 11,
the crews left the club house. Short
ly after 11:30 the pistol sounded.
The Freshman contest was practic
ally a reversal of the Varsity race,
with the exception that the losing
crew kept their form throughout.
California's eight rowed a game
race, but the Stanford men main
tained the lead which they had se
cured at. the start. The number of
strokes was about the same as that,
made by the Varsity on the average.
Toward the finish of the two miles
and a quarter the crews sprinted,
when Solinsky worked the squeeze
play.
The defeat of the Cardinal team
was due to lamentable and inexcus
able base running. Time and again
during the early periods Stanford
men reached first only to be caught
at. second, usually caused by mistak
ing the signals. No less than seven
runners were caught in this fash
ion, three of them being caught in
a single inning.
That the Stanford men, playing as
they did, were not defeated before
the twelfth inning, is due to the re
markable steadiness and effective
ness of Pitcher Theile, who during
the first eleven periods allowed but
three hits, and these were scattered.
He gave not a single walk, hit one
man, and struck out. seven. Other
than Theile, Bell and Fenton were
the stars of the infield, while Wirt's
one-banded catch of Smith's long fly
was the feature in the work of the
outfielders. In the sixth inning Rut
ledge replaced Ganong in right.
For California, Jordan was ex
tremely effective after the second in
ning. Although during the first two
periods the Cardinal batters connect
ed safely just six times, after that
they secured only three singles, and
during the last five innings Stanford
failed to obtain a single hit.
The score:
STANFORD.

and by a lead of five lengths (he
Stanford crew crossed the line at a
clip close to 40, amid the cheers of
the Stanford onlookers.
For the spectators the regatta was
a very successful event. Scores of
launches, with many tugs, rowboats
and a few larges barges were crowd
ed with partisans of both colleges.
Almost 2000 persons viewed the
rates from the Sausalito hills. Coach
"Dan" Murphy got up from a sick

the latter half of the inning the
Stanford batters were retired in one
two-three order, and the game and
series were won and lost.
Stanford's sole tally was register

were necessary for the score. Bell
hit safely but was caught stealing.
Ganong went out, but Wirt and
Theile both reached first on safe
ties, the former coming home on
Scott's two-bagger. California's ini
tial run was secured in the seventh,
when 11. Myers singled, advanced to

a passed ball, and crossed the plate

After lowing in excellent form for
13 minutes and IS seconds in the in
tercollegiate regatta on Saturday
morning, the California varsity eight
crossed the finish line near the lower
end of Richardson's Bay a victor over
the Cardinal crew by three lengths
of clear water. The better of the
two crews won the race. However,
had it not. been for unlooked for
accidents in the Caidinal boat, Stan
ford would have been a closer sec
ond. The Freshmen turned the ta
bles on the Blue and Gold oarsmen
by defeating them handily with a
lead of four lengths. The time was
13 minutes and 28 seconds. Both
races were rowed over a course of
two and one-quarter miles. which
was shorter by a quarter of a mile
than last year's races.
At, ten o'clock both crews were
on the water. They rowed leisure
ly up the bay to the start. At 10:17
the sound of Starter F 1 . (r. Phillips'
pistol cracked over the smooth wa
ters and the two crews were off.
Stanford started the lace with 38
strokes to the minute, and California
with 39. A delay was caused to
tile Stanford boat when No. ."> lost his
sent. California shot, ahead a few
feet, and kept increasing her lead.
In tlie lirst Stanford caught a crab
and one of the oars jammed. Cali
fornia slowed down to 37 strokes.
Stanford slowed up a trifle. At. the
end of the first mile California was
leading by a length, and rowing 36.
During the next half mile, Califor
nia made another length on the Car
diiiiil oarsmen. Almost another
length was gained before the end ot
the second mile was reached by Cal
ifornia. Both crews kept between
36 and 38. At the beginning of the
last quarter California speeded up
to 3 9. The Stanford men gradually
quickened their stroke and were row
ing close to 3 9. But the lead of
California could not be overcome,
and the race was lost.
The Freshman crews manned the
shells after the necessary adjust
ments had been made and the boats
bailed out. At 10 minutes after 11,
the crews left the club house. Short
ly after 11:30 the pistol sounded.
The Freshman contest was practic
ally a reversal of the Varsity race,
with the exception that the losing
crew kept their form throughout.
California's eight rowed a game
race, but the Stanford men main
tained the lead which they had se
cured at. the start. The number of
strokes was about the same as that,
made by the Varsity on the average.
Toward the finish of the two miles
and a quarter the crews sprinted,
when Solinsky worked the squeeze
play.
The defeat of the Cardinal team
was due to lamentable and inexcus
able base running. Time and again
during the early periods Stanford
men reached first only to be caught
at. second, usually caused by mistak
ing the signals. No less than seven
runners were caught in this fash
ion, three of them being caught in
a single inning.
That the Stanford men, playing as
they did, were not defeated before
the twelfth inning, is due to the re
markable steadiness and effective
ness of Pitcher Theile, who during
the first eleven periods allowed but
three hits, and these were scattered.
He gave not a single walk, hit one
man, and struck out. seven. Other
than Theile, Bell and Fenton were
the stars of the infield, while Wirt's
one-banded catch of Smith's long fly
was the feature in the work of the
outfielders. In the sixth inning Rut
ledge replaced Ganong in right.
For California, Jordan was ex
tremely effective after the second in
ning. Although during the first two
periods the Cardinal batters connect
ed safely just six times, after that
they secured only three singles, and
during the last five innings Stanford
failed to obtain a single hit.
The score:
STANFORD.

and by a lead of five lengths (he
Stanford crew crossed the line at a
clip close to 40, amid the cheers of
the Stanford onlookers.
For the spectators the regatta was
a very successful event. Scores of
launches, with many tugs, rowboats
and a few larges barges were crowd
ed with partisans of both colleges.
Almost 2000 persons viewed the
rates from the Sausalito hills. Coach
"Dan" Murphy got up from a sick
bed to see the regatta. Murphy is
still weak but expects to no north
in May to coach the four of the Port
land Rowing Club.
Both crews arrived at the quar
ters of the San Francisco Yacht Club
on Wednesday. The California men
got on the ground a little before
their rivals. The crews rowed each
day, the Stanford oarsmen doing
their last training Friday morning.
On Friday, K. L. Dole, who rowed
No. 6, was elected captain of the
Freshman eight. The Stanford crews
follow: Varsity—bow, Reynolds; 2,
Benson; 3, Vose; 4, Hatch; 5, Cole;

Shortstop Lewis, the fourth Cali
fornia butter in the twelfth inning,
drove a beautiful single along the
right-field foul line, scoring a sec
ond tally and winning for the Blue
and Gold the third and deciding
game of the 190S baseball series be
tween the varsity nines of Califor
nia and Stanford. For eleven in
nings the large and enthusiastic
crowd of 3500 people nervously
watched the battle of the pitchers,
off neither of whom the winning run
could be gained. But finally the fa
tal period came. For one moment
throughout the struggle Theile weak
ened, and the next instant the
match was lost and California had
added another triumph to her list
of recent intercollegiate victories.
Never before has a baseball game
between the two institutions boon
so closely and hotly waged as was
the one of Saturday." For one hun
dred and thirty-five minutes neither
nine could secure more than a single
tally and the result hung in the bal
ance. With one winning game regis
tered for each team by the low
score of 2 to 1, and with the tallies
one apiece, there was absolutely no
choice between the contending nines.
The climax to the magnificent ex
hibition was reached only in the
twelfth period. Solinskv, the first
Blue and Gold batter, found Theile
for ono of two extra-base hits of
the afternoon. The Cardinal twirl
er then hit Fielder Myers, leaving
the runners on first and second with
none out. Captain Jordan connected
for a long drive to deep left, which,
on leaving the bat, seemed good for
at least two bags. Tallant, how
ever. was in exactly the right posi
tion for the hit and fielded the fly
with ease, doubling Solinskv at sec
ond. The Stanford rooters breathed
more easily, but the worst was not

Stanford slowed up a trifle. At. the
end of the first mile California was
leading by a length, and rowing 36.
During the next half mile, Califor
nia made another length on the Car
diiiiil oarsmen. Almost another
length was gained before the end ot
the second mile was reached by Cal
ifornia. Both crews kept between
36 and 38. At the beginning of the
last quarter California speeded up
to 3 9. The Stanford men gradually
quickened their stroke and were row
ing close to 3 9. But the lead of
California could not be overcome,
and the race was lost.
The Freshman crews manned the
shells after the necessary adjust
ments had been made and the boats
bailed out. At 10 minutes after 11,
the crews left the club house. Short
ly after 11:30 the pistol sounded.
The Freshman contest was practic
ally a reversal of the Varsity race,
with the exception that the losing
crew kept their form throughout.
California's eight rowed a game
race, but the Stanford men main
tained the lead which they had se
cured at. the start. The number of
strokes was about the same as that,
made by the Varsity on the average.
Toward the finish of the two miles
and a quarter the crews sprinted,
when Solinsky worked the squeeze
play.
The defeat of the Cardinal team
was due to lamentable and inexcus
able base running. Time and again
during the early periods Stanford
men reached first only to be caught
at. second, usually caused by mistak
ing the signals. No less than seven
runners were caught in this fash
ion, three of them being caught in
a single inning.
That the Stanford men, playing as
they did, were not defeated before
the twelfth inning, is due to the re
markable steadiness and effective
ness of Pitcher Theile, who during
the first eleven periods allowed but
three hits, and these were scattered.
He gave not a single walk, hit one
man, and struck out. seven. Other
than Theile, Bell and Fenton were
the stars of the infield, while Wirt's
one-banded catch of Smith's long fly
was the feature in the work of the
outfielders. In the sixth inning Rut
ledge replaced Ganong in right.
For California, Jordan was ex
tremely effective after the second in
ning. Although during the first two
periods the Cardinal batters connect
ed safely just six times, after that
they secured only three singles, and
during the last five innings Stanford
failed to obtain a single hit.
The score:
STANFORD.

and by a lead of five lengths (he
Stanford crew crossed the line at a
clip close to 40, amid the cheers of
the Stanford onlookers.
For the spectators the regatta was
a very successful event. Scores of
launches, with many tugs, rowboats
and a few larges barges were crowd
ed with partisans of both colleges.
Almost 2000 persons viewed the
rates from the Sausalito hills. Coach
"Dan" Murphy got up from a sick
bed to see the regatta. Murphy is
still weak but expects to no north
in May to coach the four of the Port
land Rowing Club.
Both crews arrived at the quar
ters of the San Francisco Yacht Club
on Wednesday. The California men
got on the ground a little before
their rivals. The crews rowed each
day, the Stanford oarsmen doing
their last training Friday morning.
On Friday, K. L. Dole, who rowed
No. 6, was elected captain of the
Freshman eight. The Stanford crews
follow: Varsity—bow, Reynolds; 2,
Benson; 3, Vose; 4, Hatch; 5, Cole;
t>, Wondries; 7, Malone; stroke,
Patrick; coxswain, Turner. Fresh
men—bow, Leeds; 2, Visel; Tittle;
4, Smith; 5, Killian; 6, Dole; 7, Day;

Guerena.
Shortstop Lewis, the fourth Cali
fornia butter in the twelfth inning,
drove a beautiful single along the
right-field foul line, scoring a sec
ond tally and winning for the Blue
and Gold the third and deciding
game of the 190S baseball series be
tween the varsity nines of Califor
nia and Stanford. For eleven in
nings the large and enthusiastic
crowd of 3500 people nervously
watched the battle of the pitchers,
off neither of whom the winning run
could be gained. But finally the fa
tal period came. For one moment
throughout the struggle Theile weak
ened, and the next instant the
match was lost and California had
added another triumph to her list
of recent intercollegiate victories.
Never before has a baseball game
between the two institutions boon
so closely and hotly waged as was
the one of Saturday." For one hun
dred and thirty-five minutes neither
nine could secure more than a single
tally and the result hung in the bal
ance. With one winning game regis
tered for each team by the low
score of 2 to 1, and with the tallies
one apiece, there was absolutely no
choice between the contending nines.
The climax to the magnificent ex
hibition was reached only in the
twelfth period. Solinskv, the first
Blue and Gold batter, found Theile
for ono of two extra-base hits of
the afternoon. The Cardinal twirl
er then hit Fielder Myers, leaving
the runners on first and second with
none out. Captain Jordan connected
for a long drive to deep left, which,
on leaving the bat, seemed good for
at least two bags. Tallant, how
ever. was in exactly the right posi
tion for the hit and fielded the fly
with ease, doubling Solinskv at sec
ond. The Stanford rooters breathed
more easily, but the worst was not
yet. over. Lewis, who next came to
the plate, planted a single in right,
well out of the reach of Rutledge,
and the fleet Myers just succeeded
in beating the throw to home, in
the latter half of the inning the
Stanford batters were retired in one
two-three order, and the game and
series were won and lost.
Stanford's sole tally was register
ed in the second, and four singles
were necessary for the score. Bell
hit safely but was caught stealing.
Ganong went out, but Wirt and
Theile both reached first on safe
ties, the former coming home on
Scott's two-bagger. California's ini
tial run was secured in the seventh,
when 11. Myers singled, advanced to
second on a sacrifice, took third on
a passed ball, and crossed the plate

After lowing in excellent form for
13 minutes and IS seconds in the in
tercollegiate regatta on Saturday
morning, the California varsity eight
crossed the finish line near the lower
end of Richardson's Bay a victor over
the Cardinal crew by three lengths
of clear water. The better of the
two crews won the race. However,
had it not. been for unlooked for
accidents in the Caidinal boat, Stan
ford would have been a closer sec
ond. The Freshmen turned the ta
bles on the Blue and Gold oarsmen
by defeating them handily with a
lead of four lengths. The time was
13 minutes and 28 seconds. Both
races were rowed over a course of
two and one-quarter miles. which
was shorter by a quarter of a mile
than last year's races.
At, ten o'clock both crews were
on the water. They rowed leisure
ly up the bay to the start. At 10:17
the sound of Starter F 1 . (r. Phillips'
pistol cracked over the smooth wa
ters and the two crews were off.
Stanford started the lace with 38
strokes to the minute, and California
with 39. A delay was caused to
tile Stanford boat when No. ."> lost his

the first eleven periods allowed but
three hits, and these were scattered.
He gave not a single walk, hit one
man, and struck out. seven. Other
than Theile, Bell and Fenton were
the stars of the infield, while Wirt's
one-banded catch of Smith's long fly
was the feature in the work of the
outfielders. In the sixth inning Rut
ledge replaced Ganong in right.
For California, Jordan was ex
tremely effective after the second in
ning. Although during the first two
periods the Cardinal batters connect
ed safely just six times, after that
they secured only three singles, and
during the last five innings Stanford
failed to obtain a single hit.
The score:
STANFORD.
