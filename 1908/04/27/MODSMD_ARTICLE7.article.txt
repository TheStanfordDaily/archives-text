Notwithstanding the fact that the
Stanford varsity crew and the base
ball team lost their contests with
California on Saturday, our athletes
made a gallant fight and both events
were stubbornly contested through
out. In view of the many trials and
disadvantages under which our men
have worked this semester, we may
truly feel proud of the showing they
made against California. The varsity
crew rowed a creditable race and
were only defeated after a hard
struggle by the best crew that Cali
fornia has ever produced. In base
ball our team lost in the closest and
most hotly contested game that has
ever been witnessed in an intercol
legiate series. After such contests
as these our atliletes have no cause
to feel ashamed, and we should cer
tainly feel proud of the men who
represented the Cardinal. And to
I he Freshman crew, which carried off
a magnificent victory against, the
California first-year oarsmen, we
must give unqualified praise. Their
work was worthy of Stanford and the
first intercollegiate contest in Fresh
man eights will go down in Stanford
rowing history as one of the races
to which we may point, with pride.
In conclusion, it is well to mention
that all the intercollegiate contests
were carried out in that, spirit of
fairness and true sportsmanship
which has become characteristic of
these events in recent years.
