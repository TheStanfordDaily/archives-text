### 
The official batting averages of the
varsity squad have been compiled and
are herewith printed. Sampson and
Tallant lead the list with Captain
Fenton a good third. Hut as Tallant
did not play in half -the games and
Sampson did not participate in the
intercollegiate series, the real honors
should probably go once again to
Fenton. The nine possesses no .300
hitters, but the team average of .210
is an encouraging increase over the
.176 of last year. The completed
list, follows:

Sampson 76 22 .289
