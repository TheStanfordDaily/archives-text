# BACK FROM SOUTH AMERICA.
## Dr. Branner, Head of Geology Department, Returns After Year of Scientific Investigation. 
### 
Dr. J. C. Branner, head of the Ge
ology department, who has been ab
sent from the University since last
May, returned to the Campus this
afternoon from an extended trip of
scientific investigation in South Am
erica. He was for the greater por
tion of his time engaged in making
geological surveys of Brazil and in
the course of his research covered a
territory of over 1,000 square miles.
The class of data gathered by Dr.
Branner was considered of such im
portance that the Brazilian govern
ment paid all the expenses of the trip
in exchange for the valuable notes,
and in addition engaged Roderic
Crandall, '06, who accompanied Dr.
Branner as his assistant.
The investigations of Dr. Branner
wore for the most part, confined to
tin l Brazilian states of Bahia, Ala
goas and Sergito. Two months were
spent in Rio Janeiro and he also vis
ited the scenes of the earthquakes
of Valparaiso and Kingston. A study
of the damage done convinces Dr.
Branner that in violence the earth
quakes of Kingston. Valparaiso and
San Francisco rank in the order
named.
Dr. Branner left last, year on May
t>, and returned to the Campus late
this afternoon.
