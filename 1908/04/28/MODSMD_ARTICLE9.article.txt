It appears necessary to remind the
members of the Student. Body that in
the entertainment of the preparatory
school athletes who will compete
here next Saturday, everybody should
take an active interest. There will
be more than two hundred high
school athletes visiting upon the
Campus at the end of the week and
it is our duty to see to it that they
are well received. This is particu
larly true in regard to the teams
that come from some distance and
will not have friends residing upon
the Campus. It is essential that
the fraternities and Encina Hall
should accommodate all the visitors
who desire to spend Friday and Sat
urday night on the Campus and our
guests should be shown every atten
tion. This is an affair in which the
whole Student Body should take an
active part and everybody should co
operate in making the Interscliolas
tic this year a success. If our meet
is to prosper in the future as it has
since its organization, it will be be
cause the preparatory school athletes
are well satisfied with their treat
ment while on the Campus and while
in competition. Consequently, all
personal and selfish interests should
be cast aside during these few days
when we are the hosts of the visiting
athletes and everyone should assist
in making the meet this year the
most, successful that we have yet
held.
