# Will Remove Emergency Hospital.
## 
### 
Believing the community to be no
longer infected by the smallpox, the
Public Health Committee has issued
orders for the emergency hospital,
which was erected during the epi
demic, to be removed. Dr. Snow
believes that there will be no more
cases, as the period for infection is
past. Next year, students entering
college will be compelled to be vac
cinated and Dr. Snow believes that
this regulation will do away with it 11
such trouble that occurred this year.
