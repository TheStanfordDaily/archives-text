# WANT STUDENT SUBSCRIPTIONS
## Graduate Manager Knupp Will Appoint Collectors To Gather Money for Truck Fund. 
### 
No additional subscriptions have ;
been received during the past two |
days by Manager Knupp. and while !
it is l>elieved the alumni will prob-1
1 |
ably aid materially in sending the
track team East, it has been decided i
to call upon the undergraduates to:
make personal donations sufficient to j
assure the trip of the athletes. Col-1
lectors will be appointed tomorrow j
by Manager Knupp and will begin |
their canvass of the students. In the i
mean time it is thought the San |
Francisco alumni will have made
some response.
At Chicago there is a possibility |
that a guarantee can be obtained or .
the alumni in that city will forward |
funds. The same is expected at
New York, though nothing definite '
from either of these cities has been
heard.
The alumni in Denver are enthu-1
siastic over the prospect that the i
Cardinal may contest with the Uni- I
versity of Colorado and some hope
has been entertained that financial
support from this source may be i
realized. In Los Angeles, O. S. Lous- j
ley, '05, is engaged in raising funds \
but, as in the case of the other cit
ies, has not made any report.
