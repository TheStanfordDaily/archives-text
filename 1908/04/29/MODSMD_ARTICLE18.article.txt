## Prize Story Number, Published by English Club, Out Tomorrow. 
### 
The April number of the "Se
quoia," published by the English
Club, will be out tomorrow. The
features of this issue are a prize
story and poem. The prize story,
"God Ha' Mercy," by Dora Eckl,
'11, is interesting and shows consid
erable literary ability. The prize po
em, "Lines to Music," by Miss Eller
beck, 'OS, is quite original.
Continuing the series of "What's
the Matter with Stanford," George E.
Crothers, secretary of the local board
of trustees, writes on "The Future
of the University." In dealing with
this subject he follows closely along
the lines of President. Jordan's theo
ry of doing away with the two lower
classes. "The University of the Fu
ture," by Sydney Hillyard, is inter
esting, if highly imaginary.
Editorially, P. F. Valentine, the
editor, under the head of "Student
Control," indirectly refers to the re
cent. troubles and suggests it, as a
remedy for conditions now existing.
He also deals under another head
with the so-called decline of liter
ary spirit, saying that what has been
regarded as a literary decline here is
only a reflection of the conditions
now prevalent throughout the coun
try.
New poems by .T. Hill and F. W.
Weymouth, and the two stories, "The
Lie that. Failed," by E. M. Roboth
am, and "A Discourse of Neatherds,"
by Helen Campbell, complete this
very interesting number.
