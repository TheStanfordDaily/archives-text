# SIGMA XI ELECTS.
## Many Scientists From Anions Faculty, Alumni, and Senior Class Are Honored.

The annual meeting of the Sig
ma Xi fraternity was held last even
ing in the Faculty clubhouse, for
the purpose of electing officers for
the ensuing year and to vote on
this year's candidates for member
ship.
The following officers were chosen:
president, E. C. Franklin, Depart
ment of Chemistry; vice-president,
F. J. Rogers, of the Physics depart
ment; recording secretary, Harold
Heath, Department of Zoology; cor
responding secretary, R. E. Swain,
of the Chemistry department; trea
surer, W. A. Manning, Department
of Applied Mathematics.
Up to this year the eligibility
clause in the constitution has been
followed explicitly in choosing new
members. This clause provides that
"anyone who is a member of the
Faculty, a graduate assistant, a grad
uate student, a member of the fourth
year class, or a graduate of not less
than five years' standing, and who
has made original investigations in
pure or applied science is eligible
for membership in Sigma Xi." In
some cases this has been found to
work a hardship, notably in the
Mathematics department, where re
search work very seldom is possible.
A committee of four members was
therefore appointed to consider the
means of remedying this difficulty.
The new members, who were
chosen from various scientific de
partments of the University for work
in special lines follow:
Chemistry department—Hazel W.
Severy, '07, "Determination of Ar
senic by Marsh's Test." C. A. Rouil
