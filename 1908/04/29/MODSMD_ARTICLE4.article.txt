# Student Body Officers Chosen.
## Stewart and Leach Win In the Most Interesting Contests.--Light Vote Is Cast. 
### 
In tlie annual Student Body elec
tion, which was unusually free from
close contests, the officers of the As
sociated Students were selected to
day for the ensuing year. The vote
cast, was exceedingly light as com
pared with that of a year ago, ap
proximately six hundred students re
gistering their choice. Six of the
chief offices were filled without a
contest, which is a situation that
has rarely arisen in local student af
fairs. A number of students did
not. qualify as voters because of the
fact that they had failed to pay
their assessments. However, about
thirty of these were permitted to
participate in t lie election upon the
payment of their fees to Manager
Knupp. Interest centered in the
contest for treasurer, in which two
nominees sought to be elected, and
in which .1. E. Stewart was victor
ious.
