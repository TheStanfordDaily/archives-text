# DISCUS TO BE FEATURE
## WILL INTRODUCE NEW EVENT AT INTERSCHOLASTIC. Several Entries Will Offer Exhibition In Free Style Throwing. Officials Named. 
### 
An unusual feature of the inter
scholastic meet on Saturday will be
an exhibition discus throw, in which
athletes from Healdsburg, Willits,
and probably Pasadena, will compete.
There has been considerable agita
tion to have this event added to the
regular entry list for next year, and
the exhibition will be given in order
that the college public may have an
opportunity to judge the merits of
the sport. Tt, is probable that the
matter will come up for discussion at
the meeting of the team captains af
ter the meet. While the event is in
progress, the other events of the
meet will be suspended, to allow the
audience to witness the competition.
The men all use the free style of
throwing the discus, and will use the
official twelve-pound weight furnish
ed by the Spaulding Company of San
Francisco. Each contestant will be
allowed three preliminary throws,
and the two highest will compete in
the final.
The Healdslmrg entries are said
to be excellent performers and as
they have been coached by Ralph
Rose, who formerly threw the dis
cus at Michigan, it. is to be expected
that they will be in good form for
the event. Coolidge, the strongest
of the Healdslmrg contestants, is
credited with a throw of 110 feet,
which is an excellent distance when
it is considered that the world's rec
ord in this event is only 1158 feet.
