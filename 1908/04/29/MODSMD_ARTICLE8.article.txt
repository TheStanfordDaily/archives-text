The fund for sending a track
team to Chicago has now reached
such proportions that the trip seems
certain and the track men have al
ready begun light training. In view
of this condition, it is certainly to
be expected that the remaining
amount, which is not large, neces
sary for the trip will be raised. As
many outside contributions have
been received, and the alumni have
promised aid, it is surely proper that
the members of the Student Body
contribute as much as possible. We
have a strong team and now that
the plans have been carried so far,
it would be shameful should a lack
of funds prevent the trip. Although
this seems entirely improbable, the
Student Body should realize the ne
cessity of raising the required
amount in order that Trainer Moul
ton may take a team to Chicago
that will be a credit to the Univer
sity. In order to assure the trip
there should be a ready response to
Manager Knupp's request for Student
Body aid and we trust that the re
quired sum will soon be in the hands
of the manager.
