Manager Knupp of the Student I
Body has named the committee of
ten upperclassmen who will begin
at once to collect funds from among
the undergraduates, for sending the
track team East. The collectors
have been chosen from Encina Hall,
the Row, Mayfield and Palo Alto,
and are as follows: Encina Hall —
L. M. Klauber, '08, A. C. Luhrs,
'08, A. D. Hughes, '08, and J. P.
Hemphill, '09; fraternities—G. N.
Richardson, '09, F. W. Turner, '08,
C. It. Young, '08, and G. B. McLain,
'08; Palo Alto —W. W. Adams, '09;
College Terrace —E. A. McGregor,
'08.
These men will make collections
according to any method they may
decide upon among themselves and
will depend upon the generosity of
the individuals.
In Palo Alto, the merchants have
shown their support of the proposal
to the extent of $101 more, which
was contributed yesterday upon the
solicitation of Manager Knupp. This
makes the total amount given by the
merchants and business men reach
the creditable figure of $313 and
brings the big total of money on
hand to $1324.45.
