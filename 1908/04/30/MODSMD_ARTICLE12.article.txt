The opera to be given by the Schu
bert Club tomorrow night will be
the last amateur attraction given in
Assembly Hall this semester, and be
cause of the intentions of its pro
moters, we believe the Student Body
should support the affair. It. has been
decided that a certain percentage of
the proceeds is to be given to the
eastern track fund and to the fund
for a women's clubhouse. As these
are two worthy causes, and the
members of the club, as well as the
coach and the orchestra, are un
selfishly giving their services toward
the production, it deserves the sup
port of the Student Body. The cast
has spent a great deal of time in
careful preparation for the e\ent and
the opera should be a success.
