In deciding to adopt the regular
red Sophomore hat, the Class of
1911 has followed the custom that
is now well established and one
which we believe should endure. The
present style of Sophomore hat has
been worn by four classes and is
now as distinctive a class headgear
as either the plug or the sombrero.
It. has proved serviceable and we
trust the Sophomores next year will
wear the class hat as consistently as
the classes in the past have done.
