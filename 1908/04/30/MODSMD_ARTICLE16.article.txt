# ENGLISH CLUB ELECTS.
## Work of William B. Yeats Is Read and a Play Committee Is Appointed. 
### 
Election of officers was the most j
important business transacted at the
business meeting of the English Club
held last evening at the Kappa Al
pha Theta house. After the busi
ness session some of the work of
William B. Yeats was read. Yeats
is a playwright of eminence who is
reviving the old Celtic mythology.
The election resulted in the choice
of the following for officers: presi
dent, L. S. Walbridge, '09; vice
president, Miss M. Browne, '09;
secretary-treasurer, E. W. Wey
mouth, '09. The new members of
the executive board are Mrs. T. P.
Russell and Miss D. Macpherson, '09.
A committee was appointed to in
vestigate plays during the summer
which may be available for produc
tion by the English Club next sem
ester. The committee is composed
of P. F. Valentine, '08, Miss A
Crawford, '08, and Professor H. D.
Gray.
"The Land of Heart's Desire," an
Irish playlet by Yeats, was read be
fore the club in contemplation of
next semester's production. In the
event that a short play is finally de
cided upon for presentation, it is
not unlikely that the club will give
"The Land of Hearts Desire" as a
curtain raiser. The remainder of
the reading of Yeats' work was an
act from"The Countess Cathleen."
