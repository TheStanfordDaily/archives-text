The Faculty Entertainment Com
mittee is pleased to be able to in
vite the university community and
the residents of Palo Alto and vicin
ity to a complimentary recital, to be
given by the Savannah Ensemble
Club of San Francisco, in Assembly
Hall on the evening of Saturday,
May 2, at S o'clock. During the
past four or five years, the commit
tee has been struggling to maintain,
each year, a series of first class
musical attractions at the University,
and at the same time to pay off a
very considerable debt on the grand
piano which was purchased for As
sembly Hall. Thanks to the active
support given by the community dur
ing the present year, the title to
the piano is clear and a small cash
surplus is on hand.
Feeling very grateful for the grow
ing interest which has been mani
fested in its work, the committee
desired to show its appreciation in
some active way. This was made pos
sible through the generosity of the
Savannah Ensemble Club, which
most kindly offered its services for
a concert, asking only that its ex
penses should be paid, an offer which
was most thankfully accepted.
The Savannah Ensemble Club is
an unique organization, being com
posed entirely of players of string
intsruments. There are twenty-five
members, fittingly divided among
violins, violas, cellos and basses. The
program to be given is a most at
tractive one, including numbers by
Bach, Tschaikowski, Grieg ;ind Schu
bert, and Solos by Miss Rosenthal
and Miss Reynolds.
The Hall will be thrown open to
any who may desire to come, and
no admission fee whatever will be
charged.
