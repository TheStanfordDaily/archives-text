# VARSITY MEN REWARDED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AWARDED EMBLEMS LAST NIGHT. New Regulation Made Concerning Granting of Varsity Letter to Track Men. 
### 
The varsity "S" was voted last
night to thirty-eight men at the meet
ing of the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students. This num
ber, the largest ever granted at one
time, includes all the winners of
points or any fraction thereof in the
intercollegiate track meet, as well as
the baseball nnd .crew men. In base
ball, ten men received sweaters with
the block "S" and nine on the crew,
the remainder being given for compe
tition in the meet.
The awarding of the track sweaters
brought up considerable discussion, in
view of the fact that some men won
but one-fifth of a point. It was de
cided by the Executive Committee to
settle all doubt upon this matter for
the future and made the ruling that
no man shall receive a sweater when
tying for a third place in an intercol
legiate meet, unless he ties with a
competitor of the University of Cal
ifornia. This ruling would not have
affected any of the sweaters award
ed last night. In case Stanford men
tie, they must run off the tie or
compete in a field event until one
man has won out.

the following track men: C. B.
