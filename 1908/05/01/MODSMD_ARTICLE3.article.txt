# Young Athletes Will Compete.
## Over Two-Hundred Preparatory School Stars To Compete In Interscholastic Meet. 
### 
When the third annual interscliol
astic meet is started at 12 o'clock to
morrow afternoon there promises to
lÂ»e tlie greatest preparatory school
contest ever held on this Coast. More
than two hundred young athletes
from thirty-three different prepara
tory schools will meet on Stanford
track to contest for the handsome
trophies and medals offered for the
Stanford iuterscholastie meet. Since
its inauguration three years ago, this
interscholastic meet has become the
greatest event in the West for aca
demic athletes and the contest this
year will surpass the previous meets
in the number of entries and the
competition in most events promises
to be unusually high-class. There
will appear representatives from
schools as far south as Pasadena
and as far north as Lassen County.
This comprises a greater area of ter
ritory than has ever been represent
ed before, as Seattle High School was
unable to reach here last year on ac
count of the storms and this spring
there have been no entries from out
side this state.
As the large number of entries
would make it impossible to run the
entire meet off in the afternoon,
there will be preliminary heats in
the shorter track events in the mor
ning and also trials in the field ev
ents. The pole-vault and broad
jump finals will be started at 2
o'clock in the afternoon and the reg
ular track events will begin at 2:30.
As the past two meets have been
held during the rainy season on a
muddy track, the contest tomorrow
should be the most, successful, as the
cinder path will be in excellent con
dition. The events will be run in reg
ular intercollegiate order and the
points will be counted in the same
manner, first place counting five
points, seconds three, and thirds one.
However, the school whose team
wins the relay will not have the five
points for that race added to its
score, as the association does not
wish to favor the larger schools.
Gold, silver and bronze medals will
be given to the first, second, and
third place winners respectively.
Winning Team Uncertain.
An attempt, to select either the in
dividual or school winners in the
meet tomorrow would be little more
than guessing, for with thirty-three
schools competing and an entry list
of over two hundred and twenty ath
letes, the outcome of each event and
the final score of the day cannot be
determined by previous calculations.
But with the star performers well
scattered among a large number of
schools the winning score will prob
ably be low, not much exceeding
twenty points. This fact gives the
schools possessing a small number of
flrst-class men a chance to carry off
first place in the meet, and it is not

sity cup may fall to some school, not
impossible that the Stanford Univer
hitherto well known in academic cir
cles.
Lick Has Many Entries.
Oakland and Lick have entered the
largest teams, but their athletes are
not up to the standard of the last
two years and their chances of win
ning the meet are not especially
strong. i>ick is weakened by the
loss of Padilla, their star half-miler,
who is not in condition to compete.
Berkeley has some good men, Ukiah
has a strong man in Riuldick, Chico
High School has won everything in
the league in the North, while Los
Angeles and Pasadena both have
strong aggregations. Tho Lassen
County High School team comes the
longest distance to the meet, the
team of three men leaving yesterday
morning at four o'clock, going by
stage and narrow guage road to Re
no, Nevada, and arriving on the
Campus at noon today. Owing to
the injury of two of the best men,
the Willits team will probably not be
entered, making, with Los Angeles
Polytechnic, the second withdrawal.
Thirty-five men have entered in
the mile, which will be started at
2:30. With such a field the winner
may be any one of a dozen men,
but the race lies between Hanford,
of Berkeley, Little, of Lick, Hartwell,
of Oakland, Hufft, of Ukiah, and
Vallely, of Harvard.
Fast Sprinters Entered.
The hundred should furnish some
fast time, as there are a number of
men entered with 10.1 records. Sou
thern California is represented by
Ilubio and Thorpe, while Campbell,
of Berkeley, Leber, of Oakland and
Connelly, of Vallejo, will look after
the interest of Northern California.
The two-twenty is another event
with a number of well-known ath
letes of ability entered. Thorpe, of
Harvard, ought to win this event if
he has finishing power to defeat Mac
auley, of Alameda, though Coleman,
of Los Angeles, will probably be well
in the running. Leber, of Oakland,
won the A. A. L.this year and Cald
well, of Cogswell, has a. 23.2 rec
ord. Stock, of Ukiah, has shown
rapid improvement of late and may
place.
Great Race in Quarter.
The quarter will bring together
the best class of the day. Hart, of
Chico Normal, and Macauley, of Al
ameda, have records of 50.3, while
Meyer, of Lowell, and Macpherson,
of Mission, are runners of well
known ability.
The half is another uncertain race
owing to tho large entry list, with
Moss, of Berkeley, Appel, of Cogs
well, Robb, of Los Angeles, Meyer,
of Lowell, Hartwell, of Oakland, and
Wolford, of Watsonville, all doing
less than 2:06.
