# PATRICK TO LEAD CREW
## OARSMEN ELECT THEIR CAPTAIN FOR NEXT YEAR. New Leader Rowed Stroke In Race Against California This Season. 
### 
H. B. Patrick, '10, is the unani
mous choice of the varsity crew to
be next year's captain. The men who
filled the positions in the varsity
boat last Saturday in the race against
the eight of the University of Cali
fornia met this afternoon in the En
gineering building and after a short
session Patrick was declared unani
mously elected.
The new captain pulled the stroke
oar for the varsity eight this sea
son and proved to be one of the best
men who ever filled the position for
the Cardinal. Patrick has a long
reach and keeps the men pulling to
gether in admirable form.
Patrick's first experience in a shell
was gained at Stanford under the
veteran coach, Dan Murphy, last sea
son, when he was a member of the
crew squad. Under Murphy, Pat
rick's ability as an oarsman came
to light from the first. His work
was so good that he was chosen as
a member of the Junior four-oared
crew which went south to Naples a
year ago and carried off the honors
in a race against the San Diego
Rowing Club, the winners receiving
a handsome silver cup. Patrick pull
ed No. 2. He was a strong candidate
for last year's varsity eight, as far
as ability was concerned, but was
ineligible to row against the Univer
sity of Califarnio on account of not
qualifying under the residence rule.
When the varsity eight rowed against
the University of Washington on
Lake Washington last May, Patrick
pulled No. 6.
Captain-elect Patrick made his var
sity "S" this year when he stroked
for the crew against the Blue and
Gold. He registers from Visalia in
the Department of Economics. He
is a member of the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity.
