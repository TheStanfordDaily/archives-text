Already several of the preparatory
school track teams have arrived on
the Campus and for the next two
days we will be the hosts of a large
number of visiting athletes. It is
the duty of all loyal members of the
Student Body to see that our guests
are properly entertained during their
stay on the Campus, and tonight we
should be careful that nothing is
done to disturb the sleep of the ath
letes. In this matter the visiting
teams should be accorded the same
treatment as we give our own ath
letes the night before an important
contest. When the meet is held on
the track tomorrow, we should do
everything in our power to encour
age the athletes in their work and
no partially should be shown. In
the entertainment of this large num
ber of visitors a serious obligation
rests upon every member of the Stu
dent Body and unless the affair is
entered into in the proper spirit, our
meet will not prosper as it has in
the past.
