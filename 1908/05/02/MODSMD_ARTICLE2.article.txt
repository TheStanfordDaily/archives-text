bay secured low scores. Lick fail
ing to place though entering a
team of twenty men. In the weights
the athletes from the smaller schools
were especially prominent and the
performances were uniformly good.
Meyer, of Lowell, showed conclusive
ly that he is the best preparatory
school quarter-miler on the Coast by
his splendid performance this after
noon, when he defeated Macaulay in
52.1, lowering the previous record
over a second. Vallely, of Harvard,
was a surprise in the mile, where he
won from the field by a magnificent
show of speed at the finish, while
Tlartwell, the winner of last year's
race, was shut out without a place.
A crowd of over twelve hundred
spectators witnessed the contest,]
which went off smoothly and rapid

ly, each event following without any
perceptible interruption, except
when the races were suspended for
the exhibition discus throw, which
proved an interesting event, going to
Pyle, of Pasadena, at 110 ft. 9 in.
A cold wind prevented the weather
conditions from being ideal, but the
situation was much better than that
of the last two contests which were
run off in the rain.
Vallely Wins the.Mile.
A large field started in the mile,
which developed a hard, close fight
for the lead between Hart well, of
Oakland, and Macpherson, of Mis
sion, but on the final straightaway,
Vallely, of Harvard, who had been
running well back in the crowd, pull
ed up in a magnificent sprint, win
ning by six yards in 4:42. Mac
uherson maintained his place in ;i
gruelling finish and captured three
points for his school, but at the tape
Hanford nosed out Hartwell for
third by hard fighting down the fin
ish. Macpherson ran in good form
and set the pace for the entire race
until the Harvard runner let him
self out for the sprint. Hartwell,
the winner of last year's event, did
not have his old form, though he
fought well the entire distance.
Thorpe Is Fastest in Sprints
The hundred-yard dash was cap
tured by Thorpe, of Harvard, in 10.15,
which breaks the former interschol
astic record by a fifth of a second.

preliminary heats and in the final
he beat Shafer and Rubio, who both
made fast time in the heats. Con
nelly, of Vallejo, who did nice run
ning in the morning, did not place
in the final, although all the en
tries in the final finished but a few
inches apart.
Meyer Defeats Maeaiilay.
The quarter developed one of the
prettiest races of the day and was
won by Meyer, of Lowell, in 52.1, j
after a hard fight with Macaulav, the
fast little runner from Alameda. As
soon as the men had passed the first !
turn Meyer took the lead and he
ran in front all the rest of the way, ;
although Macaulay challenged him
on the back stretch and again when
the men hit the straightaway, but
the Lowell man proved too strong
and won with a margin to spare.
Butler, of Oakland, took third after
a hard fight. The time made by
Meyer surpasses the former record
of Kerr, of San .Tose, who made
53.3.
