Nine records were broken and an
other tied this afternoon In the most
successful interscholastic meet in
the history of the event, when Har
vard School, of Los Angeles, carried
off the honors of the day by annex
ing four first places and capturing
the relay race after an exciting con
test with the Berkeley team. This
gives the team from the military
school possession of three of the
handsome trophies offered for the
meet, securing the Stanford Univer
sity cup and the Sigma Sigma tro
phy for first place in the meet, and
the Bittner Relay Trophy as a re
ward for the relay contest. The
Thiele Trophy, which is awarded to
the school taking second place in
the meet, will go to llkiah through
the brilliant work of Ruddick. who
gave his school second place and
secured the Encina Club cup for in
dividual point-taking by capturing
first place in both hurdles and sec
ond in the high jump—a total of
thirteen points.
For the winning school. Thorpe
contributed ten points by capturing
both sprints in record time, while
Robb and Vallely each contributed
five in the half and mile, respective
ly. All of ITkiah's points were due
10 the work of Ruddick, the individ
ual star of the day, who took two
firsts, a second and qualified in the
broad jump and shot put. Santa
Rosa made a good showing and
scored eleven and one-half points,
while the larger schools around the
bay secured low scores. Lick fail
ing to place though entering a
team of twenty men. In the weights
the athletes from the smaller schools
were especially prominent and the
performances were uniformly good.
Meyer, of Lowell, showed conclusive
ly that he is the best preparatory
school quarter-miler on the Coast by
his splendid performance this after
noon, when he defeated Macaulay in
52.1, lowering the previous record
over a second. Vallely, of Harvard,
was a surprise in the mile, where he
won from the field by a magnificent
show of speed at the finish, while
Tlartwell, the winner of last year's
race, was shut out without a place.
A crowd of over twelve hundred
spectators witnessed the contest,]
which went off smoothly and rapid

ly, each event following without any
perceptible interruption, except
when the races were suspended for
the exhibition discus throw, which
proved an interesting event, going to
Pyle, of Pasadena, at 110 ft. 9 in.
A cold wind prevented the weather
conditions from being ideal, but the
situation was much better than that
of the last two contests which were
run off in the rain.
Vallely Wins the.Mile.
A large field started in the mile,
which developed a hard, close fight
for the lead between Hart well, of
Oakland, and Macpherson, of Mis
sion, but on the final straightaway,
Vallely, of Harvard, who had been
running well back in the crowd, pull
ed up in a magnificent sprint, win
ning by six yards in 4:42. Mac
uherson maintained his place in ;i
gruelling finish and captured three
points for his school, but at the tape
Hanford nosed out Hartwell for
third by hard fighting down the fin
ish. Macpherson ran in good form
and set the pace for the entire race
until the Harvard runner let him
self out for the sprint. Hartwell,
the winner of last year's event, did
not have his old form, though he
fought well the entire distance.
Thorpe Is Fastest in Sprints
The hundred-yard dash was cap
tured by Thorpe, of Harvard, in 10.15,
which breaks the former interschol
astic record by a fifth of a second.
Thorpe's performance in the hund
red was consistent throughout his
preliminary heats and in the final
he beat Shafer and Rubio, who both
made fast time in the heats. Con
nelly, of Vallejo, who did nice run
ning in the morning, did not place
in the final, although all the en
tries in the final finished but a few
inches apart.
Meyer Defeats Maeaiilay.
The quarter developed one of the
prettiest races of the day and was
won by Meyer, of Lowell, in 52.1, j
after a hard fight with Macaulav, the
fast little runner from Alameda. As
soon as the men had passed the first !
turn Meyer took the lead and he
ran in front all the rest of the way, ;
although Macaulay challenged him
on the back stretch and again when
the men hit the straightaway, but
the Lowell man proved too strong
and won with a margin to spare.
Butler, of Oakland, took third after
a hard fight. The time made by
Meyer surpasses the former record
of Kerr, of San .Tose, who made
53.3.

Ruddlck, the all-around athlete from
Ukiah, proved an easy winner and
he went over the hurdles in beauti
ful form, finishing in 16.2, which was
good time against the'wind. Beeson,
of Healdsburg, was second, with
Kern, of Pasadena, and Maclise, of
Oakland, tying for third after a hard
fight. The time made by Ruddick
breaks the former record held by
Robertson, of Los Angeles Polytech
nic, at 17.2. Duque, of Harvard,
looked to have a place in this race,
but lost his stride in the last few
yards.
Kolib, of Harvard, Wins Half.
Another record was smashed in
the half mile, when Robb, of Har
vard, a comparative dark horse in
the event, came out strong in the
second lap and broke the tape in
2:04.1, a second better than the
time previously made by Lee, of the
same school. Two rows extending
across the track started in this race,
with Millsap, of Pasadena, drawing
the pole. Millsap took the lead on
the start and held it around the
turn, but on the back stretch Robb
pulled ahead for a time. The
field stayed well bunched on the first
lap but began to straggle on the sec
ond round. Robb pulled out on th •
last turn and won with no compe
tition. McClure fought hard to gut
serond from Ruth, who had ;i good
? i ' int.
Knddiek Again a Winner.
Ruddick, the Ukiah star, demon
strated bis ability again in the 220-
yard hurdles, winning in 27, against
a strong head wind, and breaking
the record of 28 seconds formerly
held by Fickert, of Relmont. The
Ukiah athlete ran in fine form; tak
ing the hurdles with either foot,
and displaying a strong sprint which
gave him the decision in a close
finish at the tape, where Maclise.
of Oakland, made a strong fight for
the place, but was awarded second.
Costar, of Chico State Normal, se
cured third by a hard sprint after
clearing the last hurdle a yard be
hind Bristol, of Los Angeles.
Thorpe Wins Two-Twenty.
After performing consistently in
all the preliminary heats, Thorpe,
the clever Harvard School sprinter.
ran away from the field in the 2 20-
yard dash and won in 23 fiat, taking
four-fifths of a second off the rec
ord formerly held by Keating, of
Harvard. Thorpe runs in fine form,
appears to have unlimited strength,
and should develop into an unusual
ly fast man in both sprints. Shafer,
of Santa Clara College, ran well in
the semi-finals, and looked a possi
ble winner, but he faded away at
the finish in the final and gave sec
ond place to Colemau, of Los An
geles, who came up strong in the
last twenty yards. Allen, of Santa
Slara High, pressed the winners hard
for a place and was only defeated by
inches.
Close Contest ill the Hammer.
Five of Chico High's six points
were won by Rice, when his toss
of the hammer measured 160 feet.
5 in. This really remarkable throw
is second only to the record of
Tomasini. Wasley's attempt, which
fell only two feet short of Rice's,
netted Santa Rosa second place in
the event. Wheaton, from Fresno,
took the remaining point with his
throw of 153 ft. 1 in.
Wheaton Annexes the Shot.
Besides winning a third place in
the hammer throw, Wheaton, of
Fresno, defeated Dickson, of Santa
Rosa, by a narrow margin in the
shot. Wheaton's best put was 4G
ft. 1 3-4 in., just six inches better
than that of the second man. How
ever, it falls considerably short of
the record held by Munn. Chico
State Normal obtained one of her
three points by Bruce taking third
in this event.
Beeson Wins High Jump.
Beeson, of Ilealdsburg, tied Munn's
record of 5 ft. 10 in.in the high
jump, with Ruddick, of Ukiah, sec
ond at 5 ft. 7 in., and Case, of Chi
co Normal, third at 5 ft. 6 In.
Rathbono a Surprise.
A surprise was sprung in the broad
jump when Rathbone, of Berkeley,
won from Gibbs, of Pasadena, with
a jump of 22 ft. 6 in., more than
two feet better than the record held
by Hupp, of Lick. Gibbs secured
second at 22 ft. 2 5-8 in., a fourth
of an inch better than the leap of
Crites, of Watsonvllle.
Dickson Takes Pole Vault.
The pole brought out another new
man in Dickson, of Santa Rosa, who
cleared the bar at 11 ft. 3 1-2 in.,
bettering Munn's record by 3-4 of
an inch, and defeating Smith and
Vail, the star pair of vaulters from
Oakland, who tied for second.
Harvard Wins the Relay.
The relay race proved an excit
ing contest from the start, though
it was early evident that first place
lay between Harvard and Berkeley.
Vallely lost ten yards to the Ber
keley runner on the first lap but
Thorpe pullel ahead on the second
turn and sent Robb away with a lead
of ten yards. He touched Lane about
two yards ahead of the Berkeley
runner and Lee got in a lead of
three yards on the last turn which
the speedy little captain increased
to ten yards at the finish, winning
in 3:22, which is four seconds bet
ter than Lick's record.
