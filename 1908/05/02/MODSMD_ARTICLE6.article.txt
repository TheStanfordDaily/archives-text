# TREAT GOING TO HARVARD.
## Instructor in History, on Leave of Absence, Will Teach There Next Year. 
### 
Payson J. Treat, instructor in the
Department of History, has accepted
an offer from Harvard to act as in
structor there during the coming
year. President Jordan this after
noon granted him a leave of absence
in order that he might accept the
offer.
Treat's position there will be about
the same as here, and he will devote
himself to the work in which he is
a specialist. The following courses
are scheduled to be given by him:
Tropical Colonization. First sem
ester, the present methods of the
English, Dutch, French and Ger
mans in managing tropical depend
encies in the Far East; second sem
ester, the Philippines and other Am
erican tropical dependencies. (For
undergraduates and graduates.)
History, Government and Re
sources of Eastern Asia and Aus
tralia. (In the new School of Busi
ness Administration, which is open
to graduates only.)
Treat, graduated from Wesleyian
University in 1900, took his A. M.
degree at Columbia in 1903, and
then came here to do advanced work.
He was soon appointed an instruc
tor, and was absent on leave during
the year 1906-'O7, when he traveled
in Europe, and visited the Far East
and Australia, making a close study
of the countries of the South Pacific.
While a student here Treat was a
member of several college organi
zations and has always been inter
ested in undergraduate affairs.
