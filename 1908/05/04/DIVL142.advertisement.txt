As heretofore, the Southern Paci
fic will make a rate of a fare and
one-third for all Stanford students
going home for the summer vaca
tionâ€”minimum rate being $5.00.
To procure this reduction a cer
tificate must be procured from the
Registrar, same to be exchanged at
the Palo Alto station for another
certificate when purchasing your
ticket home, the certificate thus ob
tained to be presented when purchas
ing your ticket returning, which will
be sold to you at one-third fare.
On account of it taking some time
to issue tickets in this manner, all
students should purchase tickets be
fore the day of leaving.
No. 10, southbound, May 12, 13,
14, 20 and 21, will stop at Palo
AJtO.
