### 
Tomorrow morning; at IO: 15 the
1001) "Quad" will be placed on sale
at the usual stand on the Quadran
gle. This has heen announced by
Manager l>. \V. Rurlmnk, and he is
confident, the sale of the current is
;
sue ol' the book will go without a
■ i
hitch. The book will be one of the
most remarkable published in some
time. Not only has it IxVn the in
tention of Editor H. F. limning to
make many changes in the appear
once of the publication, but the hap-I
penings of the past year have been
so unique in every department, with
but few exceptions, that the issue
will he one which should stand un
precedented for years.
The space devoted to the differ
ent departments has been distribut
ed in somewhat different order from
that followed in past issues. The
College Year, the new department
inaugurated last year by the 190S
"Quad," has been increased three
times and is one of the most import
ant. ft, contains a large number of
unpublished photos of interesting
happenings. This department has
been edited by G. B. Bush.
The Art department, managed bv
V. F. Bellows, is one of the best and
the number of excellent full-page il
lustrations and headings is ahead of
the average. Several well-known ar
tists of the undergraduate communi
ty have contributed especially good
pieces of work.
The unparalleled list of victories
in every varsity athletic event is
the subject of the largest athletic
department published in recent years
and the number of large snapshots
of the teams in action together with
the arrangement of the matter makes
this section one of the features. The
events have been commented upon
in this department by several well
known writers. The compilation of
matter has been in charge of D. H.
Walker, .Tr.
H. L. Rixford edited the various
departments of Honor Societies, Or
ganizations, Music, Publications and
Dramatics. Good pictures of all so
cieties, with but few exceptions, have
been obtained and the general ap
pearance of the section including
these departments is up to the stan
dard.
The "Classes" have been treated
in a semi-humorous manner by E.
R. Purdum, while the "Fraternities"
and "Faculty" have been edited by
C. B. Bradford. In the arrange
ment of the Faculty list, an innova
tion has been made. The professors
and instructors are grouped by de
partments and minor employees are
eliminated.
The space devoted to the "Josh"
department is large and it. is expect
ed that, the deviation from the per
sonal josh and the addition of a large
number of cartoons will make inter
est in this portion of the edition
keen.
