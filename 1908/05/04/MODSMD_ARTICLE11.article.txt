The Student Body of Stanford is
unanimous in its expression of deep
sorrow and sympathy for the par
ents and family of John Service. In
this hour of bereavement every mem
ber of the university communjity
sincerely sympathizes with the grief
stricken family. Our feeling of sad
ness upon this occasion is particu
larly keen because of the fact that
John Service was a guest of the
Student Body at the time of his
death. To all who met him he was
known as a fine boy in every re
spect and the Student Body extends
deepest sympathy to his family in
the loss of such a son and brother.
