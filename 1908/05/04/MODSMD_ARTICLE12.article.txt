lix another column there appears
a recommendation from Dr. Frank
Ahgell, of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee, concerning the manner in
which the intercollegiate track meets
should be held. The opinions ex
pressed in this letter we balievo are
amply justified by the conditions
which prevailed at the meet this
year. There appears to be no good
reason for the unusual delay in run
ning off the events in the intercolleg
iate contest and it certainly does not
nelp the reputation of the two uni
versities. If a change in officials will
improve conditions we favor such a
change, or it might be done through
some amendment in the intercolleg
iate athletic agreement. The matter
is one which should be considered by
the Executive Committee and some
action taken before the next inter
. oilOgiate meet.
