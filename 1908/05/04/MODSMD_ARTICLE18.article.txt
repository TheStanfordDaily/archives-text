# ANGELL ADVISES CHANGE.
## Officials in Intercollegiate Meet Should Not Be Directly Connected with Colleges. 
### 
At a special meeting of the Exec- >
utive Committee held this afternoon, j
a letter was received from Chair- i
man Angell, of the Faculty Athletic
Committee, concerning the manner in |
which the last intercollegiate meet
was conducted. The opinions and
suggestions of Dr. Angell were hear
tily endorsed by the Executive Com
mittee. The letter is as follows:
Mr. Clarence Severy, Secretary Ex
ecutive Committee Associated
Students,
Dear Sir:â€”The intercollegiate
track and field meet held on the
Stanford track on the 18th inst. is
in the opinion of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, the most faulty ever
held between California and Stanford
as regards the thronging of specta
tors on the field, the crowding of of
ficials and competitors around the
decisive field events and the delay
in the succession of both track and
field events.
It is therefore the sense of the
committee that in meets hereafter
held on Stanford Field between the
two universities, the officials, with
the possible exception of the time
keepers, should be selected from ex
perts not directly connected with
either university, and that the mar
shal's assistants should be officers
of the law.
1 would like further to call atten
tion to the fact that the manner of
starting runners was in contravention
of Art. I, Sec. 1, of the Intercolleg
iate agreement, which provides that
the A. A. U. rules shall cover all
conditions of a meet not otherwise
expressly defined in the agreement.
But the manner of starting runners
is not so defined, and it may not be
changed except by joint action of
the Intercollegiate Agreement Com
mittees, ratified by the Executive
Committees.
I am, Sincerely yours,
FRANK ANGELL,
Chairman Faculty Athletic Commit
tee.
