# WILL RESTORE CHURCH
## TIMOTHY HOPKINS TELLS OF PREPARATIONS. Plans Include Putting Memorial House of Worship in Usable Condition by Next Semester. 
### 
Plans for the restoration of Mem
orial Church have been completed
and work will commence ill a very
short time. This much can be
definitely stated, but the particulars
of the plans are being withheld by
the university authorities. However,
it. is intended to fit the church for
services and organ recitals by the
opening of next, semester. When
seen this morning, Mr. Timothy Hop
kins, vice-president of the Board of
Trustees, who is acting as treasurer
during Charles G. Lathrop's absence,
admitted that complete preparations
have been made for rebuilding the
church, but declined to make public
the details of the proposed work.
it.was learned, however, that the
church will be restored to its or
iginal condition, as far as is con
sistent. with increased strength of
building materials /ind construction,
with the exception of the tower,
which will not. be rebuilt at present.
The restoration of the tower , will
be undertaken later in order that
careful tests may be made of the
materials used in its construction to"
make it as far as possible earth
quake-proof.
The work has been placed in the
hands of Meyers & Ward, a San
Francisco firm of architects. Recon
struction will begin as soon as the
necessary materials can be assembled,
it is impossible to tell how long it
will take to complete the work, but
it. is hoped by the architects and
the university authorities that the
church will be completely restored,
with the exception of the tower, by
the beginning of the fall semester.
