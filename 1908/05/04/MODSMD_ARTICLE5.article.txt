# MEETS DEATH IN LAKE
## JOHN H. SERVICE, OF BERKELEY, LOSES LIFE HERE. Unfortunate Youth Was Captain of High School Track Team and Competed in Meet. 
### 
Lagunita was the scene of a trag
edy yesterday morning when John
H. Service, who was present on the
Campus as captain of the Berkeley
High School track team, lost his life
in the waters of the lake, after being
upset from a canoe. Service had
taken one of the canoes out by him
self and was alone at the time of the
disaster.
About a quarter to 10 o'clock, stu
dents on the shore noticed Service's
canoe floating upside down a little
over 100 feet from shore. Service
was swimming toward the shore and
seemed well able to take care of
himself. Suddenly he stopped and
was seen struggling to keep above
water. A cry of alarm was raised
and N. K. Carpenter, 'OS, who was
on his way to the distressed man,
commenced to row faster. As Car
penter came near, he shouted to
the swimmer to catch the side of
the boat. Service was unable to
save himself and went down for the
last. time.
Great difficulty was encountered in
locating the place where Service
sank. As soon as he was seen to be
in trouble, several students who were
on the shore plunged into the wa
ter, but could not reach him before
he disappeared. Two hours' time
was spent by forty college and high
school students in searching for the
body.
When Service's body was recover
ed, Dr. It. L. Wilbur and a large
number of students were on the
shore awaiting the results of the
search. Dr. Wilbur and several of
the students worked over Service for
two hours, but were unable to revive
him after bis long immersion in the
lake.
Jonathan Service, father of the
young man, was notified, and came
to Palo Alto yesterday afternoon.
Last evening the coroner's inquest
resulted in a verdict of accidental
drowning. However, there was no
water in the lungs, and death, ac
cording to Dr. Wilbur, probably re
sulted from suffocation caused by
fright attended by cramps.
John H. Service, captain of the
track team of the Berkeley High
School, represented bis school in the
high jump in the meet of the Inter
scholastic Assocaition, held here on
Saturday. During bis stay on the
Campus, he was a guest at the Sig
ma Chi house. At. Berkeley he had
a good record as a student and an
athlete, and was. well liked among
his companions. Besides his father,
he leaves five brothers and three
