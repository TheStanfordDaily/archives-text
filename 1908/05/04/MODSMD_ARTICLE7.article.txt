# ELECT SAMPSON CAPTAIN
## BASEBALL MEN NAME LEADER FOR NEXT SEASON. Shortstop for Past Two Years Is Choice of Ten Players Who Competed Against California. 
### 
When the baseball season opens
in the early part of next spring, the
Cardinal forces will be under the
captaincy of C. E. Sampson, '09 who
was yesterday unanimously chosen
by the ten varsity players who com
peted against the Blue and Gold in
the recent games. The captain-elect
was the logical man to succeed Pen
ton. Entering college in the fall Of
I9or>, Sampson, early in the season,
insured himself a place on the var
sity nine during his Freshman year:
He was played at shortstop, where
he has been kept ever since, bar
ring a few weeks during the season
of 1907, when he was moved to sec
ond but soon switched back to his
accustomed station. During the past
three years shortstop has been rec
ognized as one of the strongholds of
the Stanford team, as Sampson was
a sure fielder, besides being a strong
and timely hitter. With Tallant,
the newly chosen captain leads the
varsity batters for the past season.
Sampson, who is an Electrical En
gineering major, belongs to the Del
ta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and to
Skull and Snakes. He was a mem
ber of the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students during his
Sophomore year. He registers from
Alameda.
Although not in college at present.
Sampson intends to return in August
and will be ready to assume his du
ties when the season opens in Jan
uary.
