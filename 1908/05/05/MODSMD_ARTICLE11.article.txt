With this issue of the"Daily
Palo Alto" the present editor will
conclude his control of the paper
and it is fitting that there should
be a brief review of the semester's
work. In the first place the editor
wishes to express his appreciation
for the valuable services of a loyal
and efficient staff. Whatever success
we may have achieved this semester
has been due to the unselfish and
conscientious work of the staff who
have done everything in their power
to relieve the task of the editor and
make his work pleasant. In so far
as it has been possible for the staff
to do so, they have succeeded; and
the editor leaves his duties with
many pleasant recollections of the
loyalty of a faithful staff. There have
also been many friends of the paper
among the Faculty who have aided
us in numerous ways and to them we
feel deeply indebted. In retiring from
the position of editor we pass 011 the
duties of the position to H. L. Rix
ford, '09, who needs no introduction
to the university community. He
enters upon his duty after a period
of faithful work and is ably quali
fied to carry on the affairs of the pa
per and under his guidance the Stu
dent Body may be sure to have a
daily that will be representative of
the best interests of Stanford Uni
versity.
The one unfortunate incident that
has marred the entire semester is
1 he wide breach that has been open
ed between the Student Body and
the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs. This is a matter that is too
thoroughly known by every member
of the community to need detailed
discussion at this time. We engaged
in a dignified and serious protest
against what we firmly believe to
have been an unjust action and one
in which we were perfectly justified
in upholding the Student Body posi

tion. That a situation should have
arisen which demanded such an at
titude on our part we deeply regret.
That, the Student Body and the Com
mittee on Student Affairs should
have reached such a condition as now
exists is also to be regretted. What
! steps will be taken toward a proper
I adjustment of the relations between
I the students and the committee which
| controls student, affairs is as yet a
| matter of conjecture. We hope that
1 there will be something done to re-
I store that harmony which is essen
tial to a good University spirit. A
spirit of co-operation and unity of
■
purpose; the sort of spirit which ere
| ates loyalty to our University and at
■ the same time strengthens the bond
of mutual sympathy between the Stu
! dent Body and the Faculty. It is
1
only by the return to such a condi
tion of affairs that Stanford may oc
j cupy the position she should hold
I among the great universities of the
! country.
