### 
The sacred concert given by the
University Choir in the Chapel yes
terday afternoon was particularly
successful, both in the execution and
in the enthusiasm which it aroused
in the large audience that was pres
ent. The choir was assisted by an
orchestra from San .Tose, which had
been very carefully drilled by Mr.
Buehrer. The program as a whole was
most interesting, and its rendition
was excellent, but especially good
among the orchestral numbers was
Haendel's "Largo." The following
number was the Aria from "Stabat
Mater," by Rossini, which was sung
by Miss Richardson in a way that,
left little to be desired. The greater
part of the program was devoted to
a Mendelssohn cantata for soli, chor
us and orchestra, which included a
tenor solo, sung by F. W. McNulty,
'09. It would be impossible, how
ever, to do justice to the persever
ance of the choir, which resulted in
such an excellent concert.
