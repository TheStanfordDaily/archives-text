# Freshmen Add To Track Fund.
## 
### 
The Freshman class has been able
to raise about $-10.00, which will
be given to the track fund. As was
decided at a meeting, the surplus left
after paying for the 1911 track
sweaters, would be turned over to
Graduate Manager Knupp to be used
toward the track team fund.
