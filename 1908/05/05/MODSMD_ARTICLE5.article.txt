# ARTISTIC "QUAD" ISSUED
## 1909 ANNUAL IS ONE OF THE BEST PUBLISHED. Athletic Department Is Especially Good and Art Work Is High Class 
### 
The 1909 "Quad," which appeared
011 sale today, is one of the most ar
tistic Junior annuals that lias yet
been published, it is well edited and
there are several changes which have
done much toward increasing the at
tractiveness of the volume. This is
especially true in the manner of art
work and attractive decorations that
have been distributed throughout the
book to advantage. The separation
of the pictures of the Junior men
and women is an improvement as is
the decorative drawing around the
fraternity house pictures. The hu
morous class headings are cleverly
drawn and add to the book.
In the athletic and "college year"
department there has been unlimited
space devoted to a graphic account
of all the events during the past
year, and the photographs are unusu
ally plentiful and realistic. It is
these two departments that deserve
special mention. The art work
throughout the book is also of a high
order and in this respect it is one of
the best annuals that has ever been
published. The current year in col
lege dramatics has been ably review
ed by E. .1. Hadley, 'OS, and the ar
ticle is well illustrated with pictures
of the various actors and actresses
who have taken a prominent part in
college productions.
On the whole, the 1909 "Quad" is
one of the most interesting annuals
that has ever been published and its
artistic features are above the aver
age. Probably one of the few criti
cisms that could be made concern
ing the book is in regard to the lack
of a dedication.
