# HIGH CLASS TRACK MEET
## OLYMPIC TRY-OUTS TO BE HELD ON SATURDAY. Champions Will Compete Here on Saturday for Team to go to London. 
### 
The last important track meet of
the season will be held on the Stan
ford track Saturday afternoon, May
9, when the best amateur athletes
of the Coast will meet in the Olym
pic try-outs for the London sanies
to take place in July. The entries
in this competition include the star
college and club athletes and the
pick of the high school teams.
With the very best material in the
West entered in many of the events,
the performances should be the best
ever seen here, though the fact that
the distances will be run in meters
instead of yards will make a com
parison of results with those of pre
vious m ets a difficult matter. The
field events will be easier to judge
and should furnish championship re
sults. The addition of the discus
throw, in both the free and Greek
styles, and the javelin throw, will
add interest on account of their nov
elty here.
Some of the Stanford men who will
enter the meet are: F. It. Lanagan,
'08, and S. H. Bellah, '10, in the
pole vault; D. H. Martin, '10, high
jump; H. L. Horton, '08, shot put.;
T. Vandervoort, '08, and S. H. Bel
lah, '10, broad jump; W. M. Wyman,
Ml, quarter; H. C. H;irle, '10, fifteen
mile marathon race.
The Olympic Club has some cham
pions entered who stand an excellent
chance of making the team. Ralph
Rose, the world's champion shot-put
ter, and W. Gill more, the junior
champion, with Horton, should fur
nish a splendid trio in the shot,
where the distances should be high
class. Glarner, the holder of the 900
yard championship, will enter the
middle distance events, where he will
meet Meyer, the Lowell High School
runner, and Dowd, the California
Freshman. F. Smitlison, of Multon
omali Club, holder of three world's
hurdle records, will compete in
these events against Donald and Ed
wards, of California. Munn will al
so compete for the Blue and Gold in
the field events, meeting Beeson, of
Healdsburg and Ruddick, of Ukiah,
in the high jump and Baumbaugh, of
Wilmerding, in the broad. A new
entry in the quarter is Harry Elliott,
captain of the Barbarian football
team, why is credited with a former
