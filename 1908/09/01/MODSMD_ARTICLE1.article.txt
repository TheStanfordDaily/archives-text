# RUGBY ON SATURDAY
## ENCOURAGING PROSPECTS FOR STRONG VARSITY. Candidates for Teams Will Sign Up at Annual Football Rally Friday Evening. 
### 
The third Rugby football season
will be inaugurated next Friday eve
ning, when all candidates for varsity
and freshman fifteens will sign up
at the rally which will be held
that night in Encina «iubroom. Coach
George J. Presley, '07, has announced
that practice will begin Saturday and
that all aspirants for places on the
•»y teams will be expected to ap
pear on that date.
J. F. Lanagan, '00, is retained as
advisory coach. The veteran train
er, "Dad" Moulton, will have charge
of the physical condition of the squad,
while the place of Assistant Coach
K. L. Fenton, ex-'OS, who expects to
enter Yale, has not yet been filled.
Absolutely nothing is known con
cerning prospective Freshman mater
ial, but speculation is rife as to those
fifteen men who will wear the cardi
nal in the annual contest with the
University of California next Novem
ber. At present not more than five of
last year's sensational team are sure
of being able to participate in the all
important struggle this fall. It is
probable, however, that in the course
of then -xt few days the names of a
few more veterans will be added to
the list. Furthermore, the available
substitutes of 1907 are strong.
In the scrum, there will be J. It.
Pemberton, 'OS, at side rank and J. O.
Miller, '08, at rear rank. The last
named has just, discovered that, con
trary to all expectations, it will be
possible for him to register in the
Univarsity, and lr.s presence in the
pack will be a great aid. Ex-captain
Koerner will be in college during the
first part of the semester, but he may
not remain until November. H. Rhyne
ex-'i>7, his partner in the front rank,
will not be on the field; but C. Terrill,
'09, and P. Giesy, '10, the second-team
men, are both eligible, while L. P.
Cheda, '10, a member of the 1900
Varsity fifteen, is likely to be a
contender for one or the other of the
positions. The reliable tiio of for
wards, Captain D. P. Crawford, '09,
L. P. Minturn, '09, and C. Thorpe, '09,
will in all probability be barred by the
rule which prohibits men on proba
tion from competing in intercollegiate
contests. Reynolds is sure to fill one
of these vacancies, while IC. L. Dole,
'11, and J. W. Fitting, '10, if the lat
ter registers, will both be strong can
didates for the positions. As yet C.
Pemberton, '10, is the only aspirant
for wing forward. Pemberton has
filled this position for his class team.
The veteran backs will be J. R.
Holman, '09, at wing, and C. F. Gan
ong , '10, and M. M. Mitchell, '10, the
five-eights. It is not known whether
Vandervoorl, the center three-quar
ter, will re-register. Cadwalader has
not decided to sign up for full, but he
may be persuaded to don a suit once
again, for it is thought that Brown
should have little trouble in securing
the second wing position; while D. S.
Heinly, '09, was Fenton's only sub
stitute at half.

while the place of Assistant Coach
K. L. Fenton, ex-'OS, who expects to
enter Yale, has not yet been filled.
Absolutely nothing is known con
cerning prospective Freshman mater
ial, but speculation is rife as to those
fifteen men who will wear the cardi
nal in the annual contest with the
University of California next Novem
ber. At present not more than five of
last year's sensational team are sure
of being able to participate in the all
important struggle this fall. It is
probable, however, that in the course
of then -xt few days the names of a
few more veterans will be added to
the list. Furthermore, the available
substitutes of 1907 are strong.
In the scrum, there will be J. It.
Pemberton, 'OS, at side rank and J. O.
Miller, '08, at rear rank. The last
named has just, discovered that, con
trary to all expectations, it will be
possible for him to register in the
Univarsity, and lr.s presence in the
pack will be a great aid. Ex-captain
Koerner will be in college during the
first part of the semester, but he may
not remain until November. H. Rhyne
ex-'i>7, his partner in the front rank,
will not be on the field; but C. Terrill,
'09, and P. Giesy, '10, the second-team
men, are both eligible, while L. P.
Cheda, '10, a member of the 1900
Varsity fifteen, is likely to be a
contender for one or the other of the
positions. The reliable tiio of for
wards, Captain D. P. Crawford, '09,
L. P. Minturn, '09, and C. Thorpe, '09,
will in all probability be barred by the
rule which prohibits men on proba
tion from competing in intercollegiate
contests. Reynolds is sure to fill one
of these vacancies, while IC. L. Dole,
'11, and J. W. Fitting, '10, if the lat
ter registers, will both be strong can
didates for the positions. As yet C.
Pemberton, '10, is the only aspirant
for wing forward. Pemberton has
filled this position for his class team.
The veteran backs will be J. R.
Holman, '09, at wing, and C. F. Gan
ong , '10, and M. M. Mitchell, '10, the
five-eights. It is not known whether
Vandervoorl, the center three-quar
ter, will re-register. Cadwalader has
not decided to sign up for full, but he
may be persuaded to don a suit once
again, for it is thought that Brown
should have little trouble in securing
the second wing position; while D. S.
Heinly, '09, was Fenton's only sub
stitute at half.
