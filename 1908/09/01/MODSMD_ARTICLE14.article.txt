# DEAN OF THE WOMEN IS HERE.
## Mrs. Evelyn Wight Allan, '96 will Take Up Her Duties Toward Five Hundred Students. 
### 
Mrs Evelyn Wight Allan, a grad
uate of the Class of 1896, who has
been chosen by the Board of Trustees
to act as the dean of the women stu
dents, is now residing on the campus.
Her position is not executive, being
rather of an advisory nature. She
will give advice that has the value of
coming from one who is in close
touch with the affairs of the women
students. Should the new dean, in
her study of the present conditions,
discover any situation that demands
a change for the betterment of the
women, she will make recommenda
tions to that effect to the Committee
on Student Affairs. Mrs. Allan will
not have charge of women's athletics
nor will she supervise their scholar
ship nor will she be present at the
University in the capacity of a cliap
erone. The post being a new depart
ure, a very careful study of the re
lations of the women will be made
by the dean and she will act slowly
at present concerning the offering of
any suggestions to the Student Affairs
Committe.
Mrs. Allan lias been a teacher in the
English department of the Brooklyn
High Sshool and secretary of the
High School Teachers Association of
New York State, and is a woman who
made an enviable record for herself
during her course at Stanford.
