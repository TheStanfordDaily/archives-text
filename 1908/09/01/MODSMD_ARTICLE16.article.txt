# DR. JORDAN BACK FROM TRIP.
## President Crosses Continent to Help Formulate International Laws on Fisheries. 
### 
Dr. Jordan returned to the campus
last Friday after having been absent
from the University almost three
months. He went East early in June
to deliver the Commencement ad
dresses at the University of South
Dakota aud at Colorado College, re
turning to the campus late in the
month to prepare for an extensive
trip along the boundary line between
the United States and Canada.
Dr. Jordan took this trip at the re
quest of President Roosevelt, in com
pany with S. L. Bastedo, representing
Great Britain's interests, in order to
gather data from which to compile
an international code of laws to
govern the fisheries in the boundary
waters. The fact that there has been
constant conflict between the state
statutes and the laws of Canada in
regard to these fisheries has led the
two governments to appoint commis
sioners to formulate a new set of laws
which shall bind both countries. Dr.
Jordan and his fellow commissioner
spent two months in journeying from
the Atlantic to the Pacific and in in
vestigating the conditions which obtain
in the various localities. This part
of the work has been completed and
the two commissioners will meet here
in October to draw up the statutes.
These statutes, when ratified by the
two governments, will supersede all
present legislation on the juris
diction which has been under consid
eration.
