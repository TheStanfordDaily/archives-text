with the Universities of Colorado,
Utah and with the best athletes of
the Middle West, as represented in
the gathering of the Intercollegiate
Conference Association in Chicago.
In addition, two Stanford men were
chosen to represent the United States
in the Olympic games in London.

three meets, the individuals disting
uished themselves.

which was won in 0:50.2-5 by Merriam

fering considerably from the effects
of the heat, which, coupled with hard
luck, made it possible for him to take
only a third in the low hurdles, which
were won in : 15.4-5, and a third in
the shot-put. Maundrell ran a plucky
race in the two-mile and finished
third. In the hammer-throw Craw

only able to take a second place in
the pole-vault at 11 feet 10 inches

Slagh of Grinnell and Schonner of
Chicago at 5 feet 10 inches. He won
the medal on the toss.

Members of Olympic Team.
I |
(if the few athletes selected to go
.lioiTi tiie 'Pacific Coast to represent
the United States in the Olympic
games in London, Stanford was given
the distinction of producing two.
S. H. Bellah, '10, and J. O. Miller, 'OS,
were the chosen men. Miller was
picked because of his fine perform
ance in the half-mile in Chicago.
Bellah was originally named for his
showing during last season and at
the first try-out, held here on May 9,
Bellah was the only one to go to Lon
| don, as Miller was prevented from
, making the trip because of financial
reasons. In the games, the Stanford
' representative made a creditable
: showing, qualifying for the finals,
but, due to the constant slipping of
the pole at the take-off, did not place.
