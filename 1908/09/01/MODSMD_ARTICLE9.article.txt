The first step that can be taken, by
the members of the entering class,
toward fostering the many branches
of student life that breathe "Stan
ford spirit," is to pay the Student
Body assessment of two dollars.
Without the payment of this fee no
body can become a member of the
Associated Students or cast a vote in
the Student Body elections. The Reg
istrar's figures indicate that the en
rollment of the class of 1912 will com
pare favorably with the size of other
entering classes, and, in order that
ihe Freshman Class shall be able to
fulfill its duties in the University,
it must also be healthy in spirit.
It should be sufficient to remind the
old students that the expenses of the
Associated Students would be heavy
were it for no other reason than that
the recent improvements in athletic
grounds and facilities have been ex
tensive. Receipts by the management
of the Associated Students for to
day are not so large in proportion to
the number of old students registered
as they were last year. Furthermore,
a higher percentage of women than
of men students has paid the assess
ment for this semester. .It, should be
borne in mind that all the women's
assessments are used for the benefit j
of women's athletics. Therefore the
burden of the financial support of the
Associated Students devolves upon
t lie men of the University, who have
at present an excellent opportunity
to show "Stanford spirit."
