# NEW ATHLETIC FIELDS
## MANY IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN CAMPUS GROUNDS. Football Practice Will Be Held on Special Surface That Has Not Been Used Heretofore. 
### 
During the past summer the loca
tions of the Varsity baseball diamond
and the supplementary Rugby fields
have been changed. To take the
place of the old baseball field near
Encina gymnasium, the auxiliary
Rugby field of last year has been
thoroughly graded and converted in
to a regulation baseball diamond.
Here the varsity squad will probably
hold fall practice.
The diamond has been fitted with
a substantial backstop and players'
benches, but no bleachers have been
erected. A well-oiled path leads from
the main ioad, near Stanford Field,
to the baseball diamond as well sis
to the new Rugby auxiliary field,
which has been constructed immedi
ately southeast of the new diamond.
The former Varsity diamond and the
old football field south of Encina all
have been leveled and will in the fu
ture be maintained as general athlet
ic fields where the outdoor gymnasi
um work will be done. At the close
of the Rugby season a regulation dia
mond will probably be laid out 011 the
Stanford Field turf and the games
with outside teams played there.
The new supplementary Rugby
field has been placed in perfect con
dition preparatory to the opening of
the practice season next Saturday.
Three carloads of sawdust were used
in surfacing it and a splendid substi
tute for the more expensive turf
thereby secured.
The grass on Stanford Field has
been allowed to grow without cut
ting throughout the summer and, as
a result, is not now in condition to
be used for Rugby football. After
the grass has been cut, however, the
field will doubtless afford a better
playing surface than ever before.
The Board of Trustees has voted
to defray the expense of laying out
the new baseball diamond and aux
iliary Rugby field and placing them
in their present condition. Whatever
funds may be required to improve
and maintain the new track and Stan
ford Field will be supplied from the
treasury of the Associated Students.
A custodian of fields has been hired
by the Board of Control to supervise
the work of keeping the various ath
letic grounds in proper condition.
