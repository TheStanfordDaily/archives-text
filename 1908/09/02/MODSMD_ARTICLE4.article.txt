Sophomores and Freshmen will en
gage in the annual lower class bat
tle next Friday afternoon. If possi
ble the contest will be held on' Sta
nford Field. The time that the ref
eree's pistol will crack for the start
will be announced later.
The struggle this year will be car
ried 011 along the lines followed last
year by the Classes of 1910 and 1911
and, as usual, will be supervised by
upperclass men. This decision has
been reached on account of the great
success that attended the contest of
1907, and because of the interesting
character of the fight.
It has been decided to hold a rope
tying contest, the object being for
each class to tie and to place with
in its "morgue" the most men of the
opposing class. Tying material will
be supplied to each man and thirty
minutes will be allowed before the
judges call a halt and count the men
placed in the two "morgues." The
class obtaining the largest number of
prisoners will be declared the win
ner. The judges who have been
chosen are: D. P. Crawford, '09, A.
E Roth, '09, G. N. Richardson, '09,
and A. E. Ehrhorn, '10, while Field
Coach G. J. Presley, '07, will act as
referee. Thirty-five officials to pre
vent infringement of the rules will
be appointed tomorrow. The rules
applying to the actions of the con
testants will remain the same as last
year and the rule forbidding the use
of knives is especially brought to the
notice of all participants.
President Ehrhorn, of the Class of
1910, desires all Freshmen to meet
in room GS on Thursday, September
3, at 1:30. This meeting will be of
great importance to all Freshmen, as
