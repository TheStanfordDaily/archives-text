# MANY SINGERS RETURN
## OUTLOOK IS BRIGHT FOR A GOOD GLEE CLUB. Practice Will Probably Begin In Near Future.â€”Leader Mattes Will Be Absent. 
### 
The outlook is bright for an unu
sually good Glee Club this year, as a
majority of the members of last year's
club have returned to the Universi
ty and have announced their inten
tion of trying out for this year's or
ganization. The leader of this year's
Glee Club, L. Y. Mattes, '08, will pro
bably not return to the University
this semester, and if he does not it
is likely that the executive commit
tee of the club will call a meeting of
the members and elect a new leader
in the near future. Until a leader l's
chosen nothing can be definitely de
cided for this season, although plans
were partially made last spring for
a minstrel show early this fall.
.J. J. Hill, '08, who was last year's
leader, has returned to college. It
was under Hill that the club appeared
in the successful minstrel show of
last fall.
The fact that R. S. Kellogg, '08,
and P. H. Bernard, ex-'08, will not re
turn to college means a loss to the
Glee Club of two good stunt men.
