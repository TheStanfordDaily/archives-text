The success of the tying contest
last year and the decision to hold
the same form of struggle this sem
ester are indications that ibis meth
od of holding an under-class rush
will become a custom at Stanford. A
rush is defensible on the ground that
there is always class rivalry which \
breaks out in one way or another, ;
and that a rush, organized and regu
lated, gratifies this rivalry.
Another advantage of such an event,
especially one held early in the year,
is that the Freshmen engaged have
a good opportunity to become ac
quainted. The common struggle
breeds that strong fellow feeling
which is necessary to real class spir
it, and the accomplishment of deeds
which mark a "good class," as the
phrase has come to be used at Stan
ford.
The class which wins the fight
next Friday will gain a certain pres
tige in the University; the better
the showing made, the more respect
will be due. On the contrary, if ei- !
tlier class makes a decidedly poor
showing, that class will suffer the
odium of inglorious defeat. That
class will have a disadvantage to
overcome—a disadvantage in reputa- !
tion and also within its ranks. Num-!
bers are, of course, very important !
in such a struggle as a rush, and it I
is the duty of every able under-class j
man—to his class and to himself — j
to do his utmost to win on Friday.
A great stride toward a success- j
ful rush can be made by the Fresh- |
men if they will all attend the meet
ing which has been called for to
morrow, for they will find on Fri-j
day that all the organization which
they can get beforehand will be
needed.
