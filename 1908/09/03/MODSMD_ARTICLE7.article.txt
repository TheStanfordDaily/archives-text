The tone of the whole Rugby sea
son can be struck tomorrow evening.
If the right note is sounded by the
football rally that will be held in En
cina clubroom on the eve of the first
practice, a successful season, acci
dents barred, is assured. The coach
es, trainer and others in charge, and
the grounds and other facilities are
the best that can be had. From the
undergraduates must come the mater
ial and the spirit. Every man in the
University should be in Encina club
room tomorrow evening to give the
coaches all the material they want
for the teams and to raise the en thu
siasm of the whole Student Body to
a pitch that will carry the Cardinal
to victory.
