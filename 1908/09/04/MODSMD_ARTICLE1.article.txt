# VOTE FUND FOR BOOKS
## TRUSTEES PROVIDE HANDSOMELY FOR LIBRARY. Building Will Be Ready For Occupying Soonâ€”New Regulations for Loan of Books. 
### 
Wishing to carry out the original
intention of the founders of the Uni
versity that the Library be one of the
most complete in the country, the
Board of Trustees has voted to add
to the amount received from the re
cent sale of Mrs. Stanford's jewels,
other funds from the general endow
ment sufficient to make purchase of
books for the University Library.
"We did this not only to adequately
provide for the Library," said Presi
dent Horace Davis, "but also to estab
lish a fitting memorial for Mrs. Stan
ford and to carry out her purpose as
she had planned before her generos
ity caused her to sacrifice a part of
her jewels. This will eventually make
the Stanford Library one of the best
university libraries in the country."
The extensive improvements in the
Library building will be completed
within a few days. The scaffolding
in the study room wil be taken out
Saturday and work commenced im
mediately on the laying of the lino
leum and the re-varnishing of the
desks.
The steel stacks which now ac
commodate the books will be built up
as high as the ceiling, as soon as
the necessary steel for their erection
is received. The contract called for
the delivery of the stacks August 1,
but no material has been received
and none is expected before the lat
ter part of this month.
During the summer vacation, over
4 000 new volumes have been receiv
ed at the Library. There are many
outstanding orders for new books.
These will probably be filled at the
rate of 12 volumes a month.
Among the new volumes are the
files of "Curtis's Botanical Maga
zine," dating back as far as 1789. It
is the chief English botanical publica
tion, and the organ of all the greatest
scientists, "Annales des Sciences Nu
turelles" is the title of a notable set
of French botanical and zoological
works. These are files of the chief
French natural science publication
dating back for over a century.
Librarian G. T. Clark wishes to cail
special attention to the new rule with
regard to the loan of books. It reads:
"A student becomes entitled to the
privilege of borrowing books for
home use upon presenting his or her
registration card and signing the re
quired form of application." It is de
sired that as many as possible pre
sent their cards at the beginning of
the present semester. Another new
rule reads: "A fine of ten cents for
each hour overdue is incurred for
each reserved book issued for a clos
ed period, and not returned before
8:30 a. m.the day the library is next
opened. A fine of five cents per day
is charged on other books not return
ed when due. No books will be lent to
any student charged with unpaid
fines."
