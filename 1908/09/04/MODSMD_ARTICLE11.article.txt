Several hundred men students will
assemble in Encina Hall this evening
to inaugurate the Rugby season with
a rallyâ€”the football candidates sign
ing at this meeting for training. The
list of those who wish to try out for
the teams will probably number near
ly two hundred and the rest of the
audience will contain a good portion
of the men who are to cheer the
teams to do their utmost. But in case
this first rally should be followed by
a small attendance at Rugby prac
tice tomorrow, the purpose of to
night's gathering will be lost.
So that this possibility may
be avoided, loyalty should bring
out to see tomorrow's practice, a
great crowd of the men at the rally
and a large number of undergradu
ates, both men and women, who will
not lie present this evening.
