# Will Organize University Choir.
## 
### 
Work along musical lines at the
University has begun and, if the
plans of G. C. Buehrer, organist of the
University Chapel, materialize, the
Chapel will possess a large choir. Or
ganist Buehrer has been at Stanford
for a year and showed himself ably
fitted for the supervision of such
work.
The first meeting of the choir will
take place at 6:30 next Saturday ev
ening, September 5, in the Chapel.
Organist Buehrer is anxious to have
all persons who are interested in
the organization of the choir present
at the initial meeting.
