after the last issue of the Daily Palo ,
Alto had been published. About i
three hundred members were
in attendance, a majority of
those present being women, facul- j
ty members and residents of Palo Al
to or the Campus. The association
indorsed the stand by the Stud- j
ent Affairs Committee in the late con
troversy over the suspension of the
forty-one students, whose registra
tion was revoked for participation in
the parade of March 12.
Two radical changes were made in ;
the constitution of the alumni body.
It was decided that in the future, of- j
ficers of the Association may be
elected by a mail ballot, which will
give a larger number of alumni an
opportunity to participate in their,
selection. A clause, establishing
body to be known as an advisory com
mittee, whose duty it will be to offer 1
to act as a conciliatory element in
any trouble which may arise betweeu
the undergraduate and the authorities,
was also incorporated into the con
stitution.
The alumni further voted to set
aside each year the sum of $100 as a
sinking fund for the building of an j
alumni hall on the campus. Hereaf-1
ter, the annual dues of the Asso-1
ciation will amount to $1.25 and must
be paid by all members as long as
they retain their membership.

transacted, officers for the ensuing
year were elected as follows:
