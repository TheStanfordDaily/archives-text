# STANFORD CLUB IS ACTIVE.
## The
						San Francisco Organization Has Moved Into New Quarters and Is In Thriving Condition. 
### 
The Stanford Club of San Fran
cisco Opened its new quarters in the
Ibis building on Bush street, above
Kearny, last month. The house
warming took the form of an informal
smoker, and was attended by about
100 members of the organization and
other Stanford men. Dr. Edward C.
Sewall, '98, president of the club, ex
plained the aims and hopes of the
club's officers under the reorganiza
tion, and short addresses were also
made by Francis V. T. Lee, '95, and
Harold I. Cruzan, '06, members of the
board of directors.
The club is now housed in half
a dozen rooms in the Ibis building,
instead of the one big clubroom on
Kearny street, that was found un
suitable. The rooms have been com
fortably fitted up with tables and
chairs, and the walls are adorned
with attractive photographs of col
lege teams and athletic events and

cartoons of famous Stanford charac
ters and organizations. A piano and
a billiard table have been installed,
and it is proposed to add other things
as funds become available. Arrange
ments have also been made for the
serving of luncheon and dinner in the
clubrooms for the benefit of the large
number of Stanford men now en
gaged in business in the down-town
section of the city.
The new board of directors of thi
club follows: E. C. Sewall, '98, pres
ident; D. V. Cowden, '03, secretary;
H. r. Cruzan, '06, treasurer; L. S. Be>-
dy, '98, A. R. Cotton, Jr., '94, F. V. T.
Lee, '97, John Nourse, '00.
The board of directors is anxious
to have Stanford men, especially un
dergraduates, visit the rooms at any
time.
