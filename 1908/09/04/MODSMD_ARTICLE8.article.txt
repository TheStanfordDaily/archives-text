# WILL BEGIN PRACTICE
## FOOTBALL CANDIDATES TO DON SUUITS TOMORROW. Moulton Well Pleased With First-year Men.â€”Barbarians to Play Freshmen Sept 12. 
### 
The first practice of the present
Rugby season will he held on the new
auxiliary gridiron adjoining Stanford
Field, tomorrow afternoon, begin
ning at 4 o'clock. At that time all
those men who sign up at the rally
tonight for places on either the var
sity or Freshman fifteens will be ex
pected to report for their first active
work. After indulging in preliminary
exercises, the many candidates will
be divided into several squads, and
each of these smaller bodies will then
be drilled in the rudiments of the
Rugby game under the supervision of
Coach Presley and the older Cardinal
Veterans. Such fundamental points
as passing dribbling and kicking will
form the work of the first afternoon.
One week from tomorrow football
enthusiasts wil have their first oppor
tunity of witnessing the 1912 Fresh
men in Competition. The Barbarian
team will be their opponents, and al
though the halves will necessarily be
short some sort of an idea may then
be obtained on the merits of the first
year team. "Dad" Moulton has been
engaged in supervising a portion of
the medical examination to which
every Freshman has been submitted,
and the veteran trainer expresses him
self as being exceptionally pleased
with the physical qualities of the en
tering class, which Dad says is com
posed of as husky a lot of athletes as
he has ever seen.
