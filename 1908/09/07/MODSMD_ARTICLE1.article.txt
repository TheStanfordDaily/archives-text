# FIRST PRACTICE FAST
## CARDINAL COACHES DRILL MEN FOR OVER TWO HOURS Clever Work of First-Year Rugby Players Raises Hopes for Good Fifteen. 
### 
The first Rugby practice of the pres
ent season was held last Saturday ai!-
ternoon 011 the sawdust-covered grid
iron adjoining Stanford Field. Prompt
ly at 4 o'clock the entire squad was
drilled in setting-up exercises, and
from then until after 6 o'clock th-J
large body of men was worked con
tinuously at passing, dribbling, kick
ing and tackling. When it is consid
ered that this was the first day of ac
tive work, the practice to which tlie
men were subjected was most labo
rious.
The candidates were divided into
four squads. Coach Lanagan super
vised the Freshman backs; Coach
Presley looked after the first-year for
wards; Koerner superintended the up
per-class scrum, and Five-eighths
Mitchell took charge of the veteran
backs. Every one worked with a vim,
and it was undoubtedly the fastest
initial practice indulged in for many
years.
Although little could be told as to
the individual merits of the Freshman
players, the men as a whole looked
large and strong. Furthermore, thoy
seemed to grasp the rudiments of Rujj
by with exceptional quickness, and be
fore the afternoon was over, the 1912
backs were doing as well as could pos
sibly be expected of beginners. The
first-year candidates will be worked
hard all week in an endeavor to as
certain the best available material In
their ranks for the game with the
Barbarians, which will take place next
Saturday.
