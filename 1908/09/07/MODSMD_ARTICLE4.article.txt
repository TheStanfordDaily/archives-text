# ENTHUSIASTIC RALLY OPENS RUGBY SEASON
## Nearly 150 Football Candidates Sign Up for Practice. Spirited Speeches Stir Large Undergraduate Audience. 
### 
If the success of the present Rugby
season can be measured by the en
thusiasm displayed at the first rally,
a victorious year may be safely as
sured, for great was the yelling and
cheering in Encina clubroom last Fri
day evening. All of the six speakers
were warmly welcomed, and their
words were received with prolonged
applause. The keynote struck by the
different speechmakers was harmony;
and, indeed, such a spirit seemed to
pervade every listener. Coaches Lan
agan and Presley, Trainer Moulton,
Captain Crawford, ex-Captain Koer
ner, and President Roth all spoke, and
at the conclusion of the affair 145 men
signed up for Rugby. Of this num
ber, almost SO were Freshmen.
Coach Lanagan made a stirring ad
dress. He said in part:
"There are just a few things I want
to say to you this evening. First, a
great many men came out for
football last fall, believing that Rugby
was a gentle game. Nine out of ten
of these fellows were unable to stay
on the field for the entire season, much
as they wanted to. I wjsh the Fresn
men especially to know that Rugby
is a hard and awfully rough game;
rougher, in fact, than American foot
ball, and it takes as much, if not more,
nerve to play it. If you were unable
to play the intercollegiate game, do
not come out for Rugby.
"Next, many have talked about our
team. As yet we have no Varsity
team. A man's record makes no dif
ference with 11s. We want nerve and
fight, and if a candidate possesses
them, we ask for r.o more.
"Lastly, many have wondered what
spirit there would be here this sea
son. The spirit will be just what yoa
fellows make it. Last spring is over.
Let us forget it, and every one make
up his mind that we can and will win
that game this year."
Coach G. J. Presley told the men
that the result of the approaching
season depended entirely upon them,
lie spoke also of the many defects of
last semester, and said, in concluding:
"Every man must put his whole
heart and soul into his work every
minute he is on the field, and then we
will be able to show Berkeley that
Stanford is not the place where men
get disheartened in the face of disap
pointments and obstacles."
President Roth was the first speak
er of the evening. Ho spoke impres
sively of this season's prospects, an 1
encouraged the Freshmen to make ef
fective use of their magnificent op
portunity to break California's record
of first-year victories.
Captain Crawford instructed the
candidates in the matter of paying the
strictest attention to the mnches, and
warned every man to ce up his
mind, before signing up, that he would
work hard from start to finish.
Ex-Captain Koerner assured the
men that, if a large squad turned out
and the proper spirit were displayed,
the Cardinal Freshmen would be suc

cessful in October, and the Varsity
would "make it five straight in Novem
ber."
"Dad'' Moulton, the final speaker,
said in part:
"You must do three things to make
a Stanford football team: First, un
derstand the game; second, be in
condition to fulfill and carry out what
you understand; and, third, have fight
and nerve. Training is a religion hero
with us, and not even your best friend
will stand by you if you break the
rules. Then, be sure and listen to what
the coaches have to say. If you can
not get something through your head,
ask about it. Neither Coach Lanagan
nor Coach Presley will think you are a
dummy. They will see that you ars
taking an interest, and that is what
they want you to do."

on the field for the entire season, much
as they wanted to. I wjsh the Fresn
men especially to know that Rugby
is a hard and awfully rough game;
rougher, in fact, than American foot
ball, and it takes as much, if not more,
nerve to play it. If you were unable
to play the intercollegiate game, do
not come out for Rugby.
"Next, many have talked about our
team. As yet we have no Varsity
team. A man's record makes no dif
ference with 11s. We want nerve and
fight, and if a candidate possesses
them, we ask for r.o more.
"Lastly, many have wondered what
spirit there would be here this sea
son. The spirit will be just what yoa
fellows make it. Last spring is over.
Let us forget it, and every one make
up his mind that we can and will win
that game this year."
Coach G. J. Presley told the men
that the result of the approaching
season depended entirely upon them,
lie spoke also of the many defects of
last semester, and said, in concluding:
"Every man must put his whole
heart and soul into his work every
minute he is on the field, and then we
will be able to show Berkeley that
Stanford is not the place where men
get disheartened in the face of disap
pointments and obstacles."
President Roth was the first speak
er of the evening. Ho spoke impres
sively of this season's prospects, an 1
encouraged the Freshmen to make ef
fective use of their magnificent op
portunity to break California's record
of first-year victories.
Captain Crawford instructed the
candidates in the matter of paying the
strictest attention to the mnches, and
warned every man to ce up his
mind, before signing up, that he would
work hard from start to finish.
Ex-Captain Koerner assured the
men that, if a large squad turned out
and the proper spirit were displayed,
the Cardinal Freshmen would be suc

cessful in October, and the Varsity
would "make it five straight in Novem
ber."
"Dad'' Moulton, the final speaker,
said in part:
"You must do three things to make
a Stanford football team: First, un
derstand the game; second, be in
condition to fulfill and carry out what
you understand; and, third, have fight
and nerve. Training is a religion hero
with us, and not even your best friend
will stand by you if you break the
rules. Then, be sure and listen to what
the coaches have to say. If you can
not get something through your head,
ask about it. Neither Coach Lanagan
nor Coach Presley will think you are a
dummy. They will see that you ars
taking an interest, and that is what
they want you to do."

If the success of the present Rugby
season can be measured by the en
thusiasm displayed at the first rally,
a victorious year may be safely as
sured, for great was the yelling and
cheering in Encina clubroom last Fri
day evening. All of the six speakers
were warmly welcomed, and their
words were received with prolonged
applause. The keynote struck by the
different speechmakers was harmony;
and, indeed, such a spirit seemed to
pervade every listener. Coaches Lan
agan and Presley, Trainer Moulton,
Captain Crawford, ex-Captain Koer
ner, and President Roth all spoke, and
at the conclusion of the affair 145 men
signed up for Rugby. Of this num

heart and soul into his work every
minute he is on the field, and then we
will be able to show Berkeley that
Stanford is not the place where men
get disheartened in the face of disap
pointments and obstacles."
President Roth was the first speak
er of the evening. Ho spoke impres
sively of this season's prospects, an 1
encouraged the Freshmen to make ef
fective use of their magnificent op
portunity to break California's record
of first-year victories.
Captain Crawford instructed the
candidates in the matter of paying the
strictest attention to the mnches, and
warned every man to ce up his
mind, before signing up, that he would
work hard from start to finish.
Ex-Captain Koerner assured the
men that, if a large squad turned out
and the proper spirit were displayed,
the Cardinal Freshmen would be suc

cessful in October, and the Varsity
would "make it five straight in Novem
ber."
"Dad'' Moulton, the final speaker,
said in part:
"You must do three things to make
a Stanford football team: First, un
derstand the game; second, be in
condition to fulfill and carry out what
you understand; and, third, have fight
and nerve. Training is a religion hero
with us, and not even your best friend
will stand by you if you break the
rules. Then, be sure and listen to what
the coaches have to say. If you can
not get something through your head,
ask about it. Neither Coach Lanagan
nor Coach Presley will think you are a
dummy. They will see that you ars
taking an interest, and that is what
they want you to do."

If the success of the present Rugby
season can be measured by the en
thusiasm displayed at the first rally,
a victorious year may be safely as
sured, for great was the yelling and
cheering in Encina clubroom last Fri
day evening. All of the six speakers
were warmly welcomed, and their
words were received with prolonged
applause. The keynote struck by the
different speechmakers was harmony;
and, indeed, such a spirit seemed to
pervade every listener. Coaches Lan
agan and Presley, Trainer Moulton,
Captain Crawford, ex-Captain Koer
ner, and President Roth all spoke, and
at the conclusion of the affair 145 men
signed up for Rugby. Of this num
ber, almost SO were Freshmen.
Coach Lanagan made a stirring ad
dress. He said in part:
"There are just a few things I want
to say to you this evening. First, a
great many men came out for
football last fall, believing that Rugby
was a gentle game. Nine out of ten
of these fellows were unable to stay
on the field for the entire season, much
as they wanted to. I wjsh the Fresn
men especially to know that Rugby
is a hard and awfully rough game;
rougher, in fact, than American foot
ball, and it takes as much, if not more,
nerve to play it. If you were unable
to play the intercollegiate game, do
not come out for Rugby.
"Next, many have talked about our
team. As yet we have no Varsity
team. A man's record makes no dif
ference with 11s. We want nerve and
fight, and if a candidate possesses
them, we ask for r.o more.
"Lastly, many have wondered what
spirit there would be here this sea
son. The spirit will be just what yoa
fellows make it. Last spring is over.
Let us forget it, and every one make
up his mind that we can and will win
that game this year."
Coach G. J. Presley told the men
that the result of the approaching
season depended entirely upon them,
lie spoke also of the many defects of
last semester, and said, in concluding:
"Every man must put his whole
heart and soul into his work every
minute he is on the field, and then we
will be able to show Berkeley that
Stanford is not the place where men
get disheartened in the face of disap
pointments and obstacles."
President Roth was the first speak

encouraged the Freshmen to make ef
