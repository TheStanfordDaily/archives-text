# CRAWFORD WILL PLAY
## RUGBY CAPTAIN IS RESTORED TO GOOD STANDING. Scholarship Committee Rescinds Its Action of Last May, Removing Athlete from Probation. 
### 
As a result of the action taken by
the Committee on Delinquent Schol
arship this afternoon, Football Captain
D. P. Crawford will be permitted to
fill the position to which be was elect
ed au I lead the team In the intercol
legiate match with California, thus
greatly strengthening the chances of a
Stanford victory and removing the
depression among the members of tno
team caused by the threatened loss of
the captain. The action of the com
mittee invests Crawford with all the
privileges of the regular student. This
also removes the record of a "flunk"
which was included in the former pro
bation.
The decision of the committee whs
the result of a petition submitted b/
Crawford, in which h3 a eked to hav-j
the clause prohibiting students on pro
bation from participation in intercolle
giate athletic confers waived, thus
permitted him to play on the Varsity
Rugby team. In the investigation of
this petition, the committee learned
from the instructor:?, ?ho had report
ed Crawford deficient, that his failure
was due entirely to illness, and that
otherwise his scholarship was satisfac
tory.
Acting on these facts, and deeming
it unwise to make a special dispensa
tion for Crawford in regard to the
probation rule, the committee remove!
his name from the probation list, thus
restoring him to good standing in
scholarship.
