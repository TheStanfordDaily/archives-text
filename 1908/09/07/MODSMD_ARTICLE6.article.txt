# CHAPLAIN GARDNER PREACHES
## The
						Place of the Chapel in College Life the Theme for Yesterday's Sermon. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner spoke yes
terday morning in the University
Chapel on "The Place the Chapel Oc
cupies in College Life." He brought
out the fact that the attendance was
entirely voluntary, and the success de
pended entirely upon the students
and the residents of the college com
munity. Chaplain Gardner showed
how the ordinary congregation wa3
bound together by history, tradition and
social obligation. Here there are few
traditions, a checkered history, no ob
ligations and, furthermore, the con
gregation does not have to contribute
financially towards the support of the
services.
The chaplain said that the
University Chapel stands for re
ligion. Its purpose is to foster the
life of God in the soul of man. Sec
ondly, it stands for Christ and Chris
tianity. Thirdly, it stands for spirit
ual idealism in opposition to the ma
terialism of our time. Then, again,
it stands for morality. The speaker
j went 011 to show how these four things
would round out one's education, he
said that university life had very few
problems outside of one's studies, and
that these things would prepare you to
meet the world's problems.
It was announced that outsid9
speakers would be secured on the sec
>nd and fourth Sundays cf each month
in continuation of the practice of latt
year.
