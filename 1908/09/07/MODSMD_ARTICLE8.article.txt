The action of the Committee on Do
liuquent Scholarship, restoring to
good scholastic standing a student
who was migtakenly placed on the pro
bation list, deserves the commenda
tion of all who know the facts of tho
case. Through a particularly untime
ly illness, the student in question was
forced to be absent from his classes
last semester to such an extent that
his college work suffered, and he was
placed on probation. As a conse
quence of a petition for mitigation of
its action, the Scholarship Committee
discovered that the petitioner's defi
ciency was due to circumstances be
yond his control. The good record of
the petitioner substantiated the claim
that he would have received a passing
grade had he been able to attend
classes. In reviewing this case and
acting as it has done, the Scholarship
Committee has shown that it is will
ing to consider extenuating circum
stances and rectify mistakes. By to
day's action the committee has gone
far to right a false impression, re
tained for some years in the minds jf
present and past students, that an ac
tion of the committee in placing a man
on the probation list was final. The
fair-minded reconsideration made to
day deserves the respect and applause [
of the entire community.
