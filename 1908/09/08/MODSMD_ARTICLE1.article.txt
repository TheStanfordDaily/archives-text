# DESCRIBES NEW WORK
## DR. SNOW'S GYMNASIUM SCHEME PUT INTO EFFECT. Courses Are Planned So as to Develop Athletic Ability — All-Around Test Must Be Passed. 
### 
The inauguration of Dr. W. F.
Snow's new gymnastic training system
is rapidly being put into effect by Di
rectors Moulton and Long of the gym
nasium. Dr. Snow's idea is one that
he has had long in mind, but has nev
er before had the opportunity of giv
ing a trial before the Hygiene depart
ment. Dr. Snow believes that the gym
nasium should be the center of ath
letic activity, and a place where all
people who desire to go into sports
or exercises that will develop the boc.y
should register. He desires that the
gymnasium be a general all-around
training-house, even going so far a*
to give certain men a course in cer
tain phases of a sport in which the
coaches have found him deficient. In
explaining this new system, Dr. Snow
makes the following statement:
"The Depatment of Hygiene gives
University credit for two general edu
cation courses, which are designed to
do three things for each student en
rolled: (1) To give him a well-de
veloped body; (2) to teach him how to
keep his body in the best physical
condition: (3) to teach him the re
quirements of good citizenship in mat
ters of public health.
"Hygiene is concerned with the first
of these. Each student registering in
the gymnasium is required to demoa
strate what he can do in a general
efficiency test of his development and
co-ordination. If he fails, he is given
such body-building work as may be
indicated until he can pass the test.
After which he becomes eligible lo
train in any of the all-around com
binations of physical training sports
scheduled by the department.
"From these general forms of exer
cise he can be transferred by a request
of a team captain to any one of the
Varsity squads to specialize for the
season, returning at its close to the
more general work previously elected
by him.
"The general efficiency test is based
at present on evidence of either skill
in Llui gymnasium or all-around ath
letic ability. The gymnasium test con
sists of the performance of ten exer
cises on thro' 3 selected pieces of ap
paratus. Each exercise is marked on
a basis of ten for excellent work. The
passing grade is 60. The all-round
athletic ability test consists of five
events, viz.: 100-yard dash, running
high jump, 12-pound hammer-throw,
pole-vault and mile run.
"At least 10 points in each event,
and a total of 200 points, must be
scored. The five events shall be scored
on the same day.
"Students who make 80 or over in
the gymnastic test, or between 200 and
300 in the athletic test, form the first
division; 60 or over in the gymnastic
test, or between 200 and 300 in the
athletic test form the second division;
all others are placed in the third di
vision.
"First Division students omit the
setting-up drill and during the time
taken up by the drill are given ad
vanced apparatus work and tumbling,

or special coaching iu some form o?
competitive sport. These men are pre
pared to lead sections in Divisions 2
and 3.
"Second Division students take the
calisthenic drill, which is followed by
apparatus work, or work in one of the
athletic sections.
"Third Division students take a cal
isthenic drill, after which they are as
signed to some piece of apparatus,
handball and occasionally a cross
country run or game. These students
are given general body-building work,
with the more elementary co-ordina
tive movements on the apparatus.
They do not enter any of the compet
itive games.
"Students who make the Varsity
squad in track, football, rowing, ten
nis, baseball, passing the general effi
ciency test, may, after taking the set
ting-up drill on regular class days,
practice under (he direction of the
coaches and captains of the various
teams. No student not on a Varsity
squad is permitted to do this as a part
of his gymnasium work.
"Varsity Squads—The Rugby Var
sity squad shall be defined for the
purposes of this privilege as the fir-jt
forty-five men on the field are rated
by the captain, trainer and coach.
"The baseball Varsity squad shall
be defined for the purposes of this
privilege as the first twenty men;
Varsity crew as the first, twenty;
Varsity tennis squad as the first six
men as rated by captain, trainer ami
coach of the respective groups."

The inauguration of Dr. W. F.
Snow's new gymnastic training system
is rapidly being put into effect by Di
rectors Moulton and Long of the gym
nasium. Dr. Snow's idea is one that
he has had long in mind, but has nev
er before had the opportunity of giv
ing a trial before the Hygiene depart
ment. Dr. Snow believes that the gym
nasium should be the center of ath
letic activity, and a place where all
people who desire to go into sports
or exercises that will develop the boc.y
should register. He desires that the
gymnasium be a general all-around
training-house, even going so far a*
to give certain men a course in cer
tain phases of a sport in which the
coaches have found him deficient. In
explaining this new system, Dr. Snow
makes the following statement:
"The Depatment of Hygiene gives
University credit for two general edu
cation courses, which are designed to
do three things for each student en
rolled: (1) To give him a well-de
veloped body; (2) to teach him how to
keep his body in the best physical
condition: (3) to teach him the re
quirements of good citizenship in mat
ters of public health.
"Hygiene is concerned with the first
of these. Each student registering in
the gymnasium is required to demoa
strate what he can do in a general
efficiency test of his development and
co-ordination. If he fails, he is given
such body-building work as may be
indicated until he can pass the test.
After which he becomes eligible lo
train in any of the all-around com
binations of physical training sports
scheduled by the department.
"From these general forms of exer
cise he can be transferred by a request
of a team captain to any one of the
Varsity squads to specialize for the
season, returning at its close to the
more general work previously elected
by him.
"The general efficiency test is based
at present on evidence of either skill
in Llui gymnasium or all-around ath
letic ability. The gymnasium test con
sists of the performance of ten exer
cises on thro' 3 selected pieces of ap
paratus. Each exercise is marked on
a basis of ten for excellent work. The
passing grade is 60. The all-round
athletic ability test consists of five
events, viz.: 100-yard dash, running
high jump, 12-pound hammer-throw,
pole-vault and mile run.
"At least 10 points in each event,
and a total of 200 points, must be
scored. The five events shall be scored
on the same day.
"Students who make 80 or over in
the gymnastic test, or between 200 and
300 in the athletic test, form the first
division; 60 or over in the gymnastic
test, or between 200 and 300 in the
athletic test form the second division;
all others are placed in the third di
vision.
"First Division students omit the
setting-up drill and during the time
taken up by the drill are given ad
vanced apparatus work and tumbling,

or special coaching iu some form o?
competitive sport. These men are pre
pared to lead sections in Divisions 2
and 3.
"Second Division students take the
calisthenic drill, which is followed by
apparatus work, or work in one of the
athletic sections.
"Third Division students take a cal
isthenic drill, after which they are as
signed to some piece of apparatus,
handball and occasionally a cross
country run or game. These students
are given general body-building work,
with the more elementary co-ordina
tive movements on the apparatus.
They do not enter any of the compet
itive games.
"Students who make the Varsity
squad in track, football, rowing, ten
nis, baseball, passing the general effi
ciency test, may, after taking the set
ting-up drill on regular class days,
practice under (he direction of the
coaches and captains of the various
teams. No student not on a Varsity
squad is permitted to do this as a part
of his gymnasium work.
"Varsity Squads—The Rugby Var
sity squad shall be defined for the
