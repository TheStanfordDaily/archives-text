# California Freshmen Defeated.
## 
### 
The University of California Fresh
man Rugby team was badly punished
by the Barbarians of San Francisco
yesterday on California Field. Some
good individual work by a few of the
first-year men was evident, but their
general lack of knowledge of the game
allowed the older players to annex a
score of 26 to 0. Tomorrow another
division of the Freshman squad will
play against the Olympics of San
Francisco.
