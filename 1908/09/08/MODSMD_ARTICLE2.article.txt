### 
Yesterday afternoon the large Rug
by squad went through the second
practice of the season under the direc
tion of Coaches Lanagan and Presley
and their assistants, Captain Crawford,
Koerner, Holman and Mitchell. The
work varied little from that of Sat
urday, concluding with a few minutes
of active scrumming between the Var
sity and Freshman teams. At pres
ent both the first-year men and the
old players are each divided into four
fifteens.
Everything went with the accus
tomed dash again yesterday, and the
Freshmen continued to show them
selves remarkably adapted to the game.
There is no lack of material among
them, and a very strong fifteen will
surely take the field against California.
Last night all the candidates to
whom Rugby is a new game assem
bled in room 68 of the quadrangle,
and Coach Lanagan spoke to them on
the elementary points, the fouls and
the penalties of Rugby.
J. R. Pemberton, *08, and A. B.
Cook, '10, are among those who have
signed up since the rally Friday even
ing. Pemberton is a veteran side
rank man, and his appearance brings
the number of eligible Varsity for
wards on the field up to four, the oth
ers being Koerner, Crawford and Mil
ler. Cook is well known for his won
derful fighting spirit. Last fall he
substituted at wing, and now he is
being tried at center three-quarter.
