# DEBS IS COMING HERE
## ADDRESS BY NOTED SOCIALIST LEADER ON SATURDAY. English Club Secures Date with Famous Orator and Presidential Candidate. 
### 
Eugene V. Debs, Presidential candi
date on the Socialist ticket, will ad
dress the students of the University
next Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.
The place has not been decided, and
will be announced at a later date. An
effort has been made to secure the use
of the Chapel, but the permission has
not been granted, and if it cannot be
secured the meeting will be held in
the open air.
The presence of this noted Social
ist and orator has been secured
through the efforts of L. Sâ€ž Walbridg,*,
'09, president of the English Club, un
der the auspices of which the most
noted leader in the work of spreading
Socialist propaganda will speak be
fore the University audience. The title
which has been selected for the ad
dress is "The Influence of the Social
ist Movement on American Literature.'
It is probable, however, that the
speaker will treat this subject in such
a manner that the essence of the ad
dress will be political rather than lit
erary, as the spread of Socialist prop
aganda is the purpose of the present
tour which Debs is making prior to
the coming election.
As a labor leader and Socialist, Debs
has been before the people of this
country for more than twenty years.
During this time he has won the ref
utation of being a brilliant speaker on
questions of social reform, so that he
is in a position to deliver an addreso
of interest and value to the Univer
sity community. For the third con
secutive time he is the candidate of
his party for the Presidency. There
have been many spectacular incidents
in the career of this popular leader
since he took up the cause of the
working man. In 1893 he opposed the
federation of the railway unions by
the formation of the American Rail
way Union, and the next year led the
great Pullman strike, in connection
with which he served nearly a year's
term in prison for contempt of court
because he ignored an injunction.
The officers of the English Club
have experienced difficulty in secur
ing a place to hold the address. The
application made to the President's
Office for the use of the Chapel was
referred to the Business Office; but
Treasurer C. G. Lathrop did not wish
to grant the permission on his own
responsibility, and passed the matter
to the president of the Board of Trus
tees for final decision. The answer
from President Horace Davis has not
yet been received.
