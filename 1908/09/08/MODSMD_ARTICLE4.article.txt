# Band Reorganization Postponed.
## 
### 
The Band held no rehearsal last
evening, as planned, in Encina gym
nasium, because of the failure to se
cure adequate lighting. A. T. Case,
'10, has announced that another meet
ing will be held Thursday evening at
7:30 o'clock in the same place. For
mer members and new candidates are
requested by Case to bring instru
ments, as fhere will be a practice at
that time. Several new men turned out
last evening, and, if numbers count,
the present prospects are good for a
successful band.
