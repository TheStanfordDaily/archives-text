# GUILD WILL MEET TONIGHT.
## Board Has Difficulty in Collecting Money Dueâ€”Vacancy Will Be Filled. 
### 
The first meeting of the Guild Board
this year will be held this evening at
7:30 o'clock. $n addition to the gen
eral routine business for the month
of August, the board will hear reports
of the Summer Committee and of the
Stanford committees for the year 1907-
08.
A committee composed of Dr. Snow,
Prof. C. H. Gilbert and Prof. R. E.
Swain will make nominations to be
submitted to the Executive Commit
tee after tonight's meeting, to fill a va
cancy in the student members of the
Guild Board. No important changes
relative to the hospital have been
made during the summer, with the ex
ception of a general renovation of the
hospital plant Miss Hogue, '98, ex
ecutive nurse for the past three years,
resigned at the end of her term of
appointment, August, to enter
work. Her place is being filled tem
porarily by Miss Grace T. McKinley.
The annual reports of the standing
committees this evening will show
that the Guild has continued on a safe
financial basis, but it has been diffi
cult to collect all the money due to
the Guild for services rendered. So
the gross indebtedness is $3500, but
all of this is covered by the earnings
of the institution. This matter was
called to the attention of the student
body executive committee last spring,
and general instructions were issued
by that body to the board concerning
collections. However, this question
will be taken up at length at the
meeting tonight.
The officers of the Guild Board for
the ensuing year are: President, M.
R. Kirkwood, '09; vice-president and
chairman of the managing committee,
Miss K. L. Barnes, '10; treasurer and
I chairman of the ways and means com
mittee, W. H. Masters, '09; secretary.
J. C. Robbins, '10.
