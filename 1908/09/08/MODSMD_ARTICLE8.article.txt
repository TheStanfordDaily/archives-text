The initial Assembly of the year
should be attended by every student
in the University. Moreover, it will
be the first opportunity for a large
number of the undergraduates to hear
the four speakers who have consented
to address the meeting. What the
president and vice-president of the
University have to say may be direct
ed toward describing the policy of the
University toward the students at
large. The president of the Associated
Students will have an opportunity \o
strike the keynote for the conduct of
undergraduate affairs. The chairman
of the Committee on Public Exercises
will be in a position to tell what place
he hopes to make the University as
semblies occupy in the life of the
community, and between the Univer
sity authorities and the Student Body
they are sure to have a considerable
influence. It is to be hoped that those
in charge will make the most of the
assemblies, and that the new students
will come to learn that these gather
ings are so important for their possi
bilities alone that none will be missed.
