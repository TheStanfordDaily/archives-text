### 
The Combined Musical Clubs ir.et
last evening and discussed business
affairs. Officers for the year were
elected as follows: C. B. Bradford,
'09, president; L. J. Hart, '10, vice
president, and W. W. Todd, '09, secre
tary. After a discussion of the nu
merous possible musical events which
may occur this fall the Combined
Clubs adjourned, and the Glee and
Mandolin Clubs each held a meeting.
The Glee Club voted that this year's
club should be under professional di
rection, and after some discussion/
voted unanimously that Prof. Roland
Roberts of Palo Alto be secured, if
possible, to have entire charge of the
musical part of the club's activities.
Professor Roberts has been promi
nent in musical circles both on the
campus and Palo Alto. In previous
years he has assisted the Glee Club
from time to time, usually in an ad
visory position, but this year he is be
ing retained for the whole of the first
semester, with the privilege of obtain
ing his services under the same con
ditions for the second. Heretofore
it has been the custom to elect an
undergraduate leader, who has large
ly directed the musical affairs of the
club. It may be that an undergrad
uate leader will be elected later oti,
but it has been waived for the pres
ent. The executive committee, con
sisting of W. W. Todd, '09, and R. H.
Brown, '10, will manage the club's
business affairs, as it has always done.
The professional director's duties will
not include business management.
The try-out, which was announced
to occur tomorrow evening, has been
postponed until next Tuesday and
Wednesday. Both try-outs will occur
in the Chapel at 7:30 o'clock on the
respective evenings.
The Mandolin Club talked over sev
eral offers they have received for sin
gle concerts in nearby towns, and
elected F. D. Mahone, '08, manager
for the season.
