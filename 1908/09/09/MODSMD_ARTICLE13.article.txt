# OUTLINE ROWING WORK
## OARSMEN PLAN FOR AN ACTIVE BOATING SEASON. Crew May Be Sent to Row at Venice This Semester.â€”Fall Training May Be Started. 
### 
Negotiations are now under way for
a fall regatta to be held at Venice,
under the auspices of the Los An
geles Athletic Club and the San Diego
Rowing Club, respectively. There are
a number of oarsmen in college not",
entering other fall athletics, including
last year's captain, L. R. Gay, '08; A.
N. Cole, '08; C. Wondries, '08; G. Hus
ton, '10; A. Visel, '11; K. Chamberlain,
'11, and B. Shutts, '09, who have rowed
against California in either varsity cr
Freshman races. They would serve
as a nucleus for "senior" fours or
eights. In all probability, light fail
training will be done, and if enough
Freshman material is available, a ju
nior" four or eight might also be en
tered.
A regatta will be held at Seattle
next year, under the auspices of the
Alaska-Yukon Exposition, and the Uni
versities of California, Washington
and Wisconsin will meet Stanford
there. In all probability Coach Dan
Murphy will be able to resume his
work again, and there will be unusual
incentives for Stanford to turn out a
winning crew. In addition to the
above-mentioned oarsmen, a number
of experienced rowers who are play
ing Rugby will add materially to Stan
ford's chances for a strong squad.
These men are J. R. Pemberton, '08;
R. H. Reynolds, '10; C. H. Vose, '10,
and J. W. Fitting, '10. J. Killian, '11,
and K. L. Dole, '11, who rowed on the
winning Freshman crew last year, will
also be valuable additions to the
squad.
