# FIRST ASSEMBLY IS MARKED BY FOUR STRONG SPEECHES
## President David Starr Jordan, Dr. Branner, A.E. Roth, '09, and Prof. B.E. Howard Speak to Undergraduates This Morning. 
### 
The first assembly of the semester
and one intended primarily for the
students of the class of 1912 was held
this morning in Assembly Hall at the
third hour. Four forceable and inter
esting speeches were delivered by
President David Starr Jordan, Dr. J.
C. Branner, vice-president of the
University, Prof. B. E. Howard of the
Department of Economics, and A. E.
Roth, '09, student body president for
the present year. In addition to the
speeches, yells were given and the
meeting closed with the singing of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," by the audi
ence.
Each speaker in turn addressed a
number of his remarks particularly co
the Freshmen. l)r. Jordan called the
attention of the first-year students to
certain customs and rules they should
obey. Dr. Jordan's speech was marked
by many forcible statements having a
| bearing upon the situation given so
: much publicity last semester. "Cut
: out Menlo, or cut out Stanford," was
how he treated the subject of drinking
by students. He further said: "The
flower of life is red. The color of
Stanford is red, not pale blue nor
crushed strawberry, nor yet yellow or
dark brown. Yellow is the hue of dis
honesty and disloyalty; dark brown,
of the dark brown taste, is the hue of
regrets."
As Dr. Jordan touched upon the sit
uation of last semester, so President
A. E. Roth also laid much stress on
what the spirit of the community
should be after what has occurred.
Roth made one of the best speeches
ever delivered here by an undergrad
uate. He emphasized the fact that
what happened last semester should
be forgotten and only the present con
sidered. He urged co-operation, and
embodied the spirit of his address in
these words: "You and I as individu
als are responsible for the success or
failure of this year. If every member
will do his utmost to make it a suc
cess, this year will mark another mile
stone in the path of Stanford vic
tories."
Dr. Jordan was the first speaker.
He spoke in part as follows:
"It is for me to say a few words
r )f welcome to the new class of 1912;
some of these may pass over their
heads to the upper classes.
"All I would say seems to have
been said already by some one or bv
many who can say it better than I.
For I find the Stanford Spirit is abroad
again, never stronger than today. Nev
er mind the past. Get into the future,
'et together. Work together.
"Stanford University is the gift of a
man and woman who believed in
young men and young women—who
believed in education, for training
for success in life.
"Education means work. What comes
easy is not education. It is not worth
taking. Free lunch is a poor sort of
meal.
"While you are here, your work ij
the only real thing. All things else,
all student activities are by-play—we ? l
enough in themselves, but never to b<

| sought as ends. We hear much said
I of what the student does or may do
j for liis University. No student can dj
j anything else so important as doing
| his college work. We believe in stu
j dent athletics so long as athletes are
j students. The curse of athletics is the
j professional athlete, who is not a stu
| dent, but yet wears the student's
j badge. We would like to see every stu-
I dent an athlete, evey one in the field
|as a player; but the student in thri
bleachers is not in athletics. Shout
ing for the team, betting on the team,
do not mean college spirit. Get into
the game. Got into the work. Be a
put of the University, else you had
better go home. Try for something
real somewhere else.
"You must learn to respect your
selves. You must not injure your
selves or others. The tradition of
Stanford is that it drops off the edge
of the campus all who do it more harm
than Stanford can do them good.
"One harm that a student may do
is to hurt the reputation of his college.
One of the worst advertisements of
college is a drunken collegian.
"You will not find many laws here
telling you what you must do. You
must write your own prohibitions. To
say no at the right time is the best
test of manliness. Besides, the fac
ulty cannot enforce its laws if it
makes many. The men are here to
teach you, to inspire you, not to give
you punishment, even when you need
it. You must choose for yourselves,
and you must choose right. Just now,
you must cut out Menlo, or cut out
Stanford. There is no middle ground.
Do not ask how far you may go and
keep out of reach of the faculty com
mittees. Look the other way or else
go home. If you cannot make your
selves immune to the temptations of
evil resorts, we cannot train you for
success in life.
" 'The flower of life is red. Red Is
the color of Stanford—the color of
strength. It is not pale blue of anae
mia, nor yellow, nor dark brown.
These are off-color. Whatever is off
color of conviviality, in good fellow
ship, in athletics, in journalism, in life
anywhere is not for us. It is not the
Stanford shade. It does not bear the
Stanford mark. It is not at home on
our campus."
Dr. J. C. Branner followed Pres
ident Jordan. He chose as his subject
"Loyalty." He gave an interesting
and instructive talk. "A man who is
not loyal is not wanted by anybody
or good for anything," he said. "Love
may make the world go around, but
it is loyalty that holds the world to
gether." He went on further to tall
of the importance of loyalty in all
walks of life.
Roth, who followed Dr. Branner, in
addition to his plea for the co-operation
of the undergraduates, gave a brief
history of the obstacles which had
been overcome by past generations of
undergraduates. He told of the dark
days when it was doubtful whether the
buildings would be exempted from
taxation, of the many epidemics, of

the earthquake, and lastly of the se
vere rupture of last semester. In
drawing his conclusion he said: "ft
is now to be seen whether we prove
ourselves able of surmounting the dif
ficulties and making corrections for
last semester."
Professor Howard gave a brilliant
speech, dealing with "Stanford Spirit."
The newly appointed member of the
faculty held the rapt attention of the
audience, and was given a hearty
round of applause. The substance of
his speech was: "You cannot get
Stanford Spirit by artificial meam.
Stanford Spirit is a mighty spirit.
Don't think you have the Stanford
Spirit until you feel the courage of life
and devotion to higher ideals from
your very soul."

Dr. J. C. Branner followed Pres
ident Jordan. He chose as his subject
"Loyalty." He gave an interesting
and instructive talk. "A man who is
not loyal is not wanted by anybody
or good for anything," he said. "Love
may make the world go around, but
it is loyalty that holds the world to
gether." He went on further to tall
of the importance of loyalty in all
walks of life.
Roth, who followed Dr. Branner, in
addition to his plea for the co-operation
of the undergraduates, gave a brief
history of the obstacles which had
been overcome by past generations of
undergraduates. He told of the dark
days when it was doubtful whether the
buildings would be exempted from
taxation, of the many epidemics, of

the earthquake, and lastly of the se
vere rupture of last semester. In
drawing his conclusion he said: "ft
is now to be seen whether we prove
ourselves able of surmounting the dif
ficulties and making corrections for
last semester."
Professor Howard gave a brilliant
speech, dealing with "Stanford Spirit."
The newly appointed member of the
faculty held the rapt attention of the
audience, and was given a hearty
round of applause. The substance of
his speech was: "You cannot get
Stanford Spirit by artificial meam.
Stanford Spirit is a mighty spirit.
Don't think you have the Stanford
Spirit until you feel the courage of life
and devotion to higher ideals from
your very soul."
The first assembly of the semester
and one intended primarily for the
students of the class of 1912 was held
this morning in Assembly Hall at the
third hour. Four forceable and inter
esting speeches were delivered by
President David Starr Jordan, Dr. J.
C. Branner, vice-president of the
University, Prof. B. E. Howard of the
Department of Economics, and A. E.
Roth, '09, student body president for
the present year. In addition to the
speeches, yells were given and the
meeting closed with the singing of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," by the audi
ence.
Each speaker in turn addressed a
number of his remarks particularly co
the Freshmen. l)r. Jordan called the
attention of the first-year students to
certain customs and rules they should
obey. Dr. Jordan's speech was marked
by many forcible statements having a
| bearing upon the situation given so
: much publicity last semester. "Cut
: out Menlo, or cut out Stanford," was
how he treated the subject of drinking
by students. He further said: "The
flower of life is red. The color of
Stanford is red, not pale blue nor
crushed strawberry, nor yet yellow or
dark brown. Yellow is the hue of dis
honesty and disloyalty; dark brown,
of the dark brown taste, is the hue of
regrets."
As Dr. Jordan touched upon the sit
uation of last semester, so President
A. E. Roth also laid much stress on
what the spirit of the community
should be after what has occurred.
Roth made one of the best speeches
ever delivered here by an undergrad
uate. He emphasized the fact that
what happened last semester should
be forgotten and only the present con
sidered. He urged co-operation, and
embodied the spirit of his address in
these words: "You and I as individu
als are responsible for the success or
failure of this year. If every member
will do his utmost to make it a suc
cess, this year will mark another mile
stone in the path of Stanford vic
tories."
Dr. Jordan was the first speaker.
He spoke in part as follows:
"It is for me to say a few words
r )f welcome to the new class of 1912;
some of these may pass over their
heads to the upper classes.
"All I would say seems to have
been said already by some one or bv
many who can say it better than I.
For I find the Stanford Spirit is abroad
again, never stronger than today. Nev
er mind the past. Get into the future,
'et together. Work together.
"Stanford University is the gift of a
man and woman who believed in
young men and young women—who
believed in education, for training
for success in life.
"Education means work. What comes
easy is not education. It is not worth
taking. Free lunch is a poor sort of
meal.
"While you are here, your work ij
the only real thing. All things else,
all student activities are by-play—we ? l
enough in themselves, but never to b<

| sought as ends. We hear much said
I of what the student does or may do
j for liis University. No student can dj
j anything else so important as doing
| his college work. We believe in stu
j dent athletics so long as athletes are
j students. The curse of athletics is the
j professional athlete, who is not a stu
| dent, but yet wears the student's
j badge. We would like to see every stu-
I dent an athlete, evey one in the field
|as a player; but the student in thri
bleachers is not in athletics. Shout
ing for the team, betting on the team,
do not mean college spirit. Get into
the game. Got into the work. Be a
put of the University, else you had
better go home. Try for something
real somewhere else.
"You must learn to respect your
selves. You must not injure your
selves or others. The tradition of
Stanford is that it drops off the edge
of the campus all who do it more harm
than Stanford can do them good.

Roth made one of the best speeches
ever delivered here by an undergrad
uate. He emphasized the fact that
what happened last semester should
be forgotten and only the present con
sidered. He urged co-operation, and
embodied the spirit of his address in
these words: "You and I as individu
als are responsible for the success or
failure of this year. If every member
will do his utmost to make it a suc
cess, this year will mark another mile
stone in the path of Stanford vic
tories."
Dr. Jordan was the first speaker.
He spoke in part as follows:
"It is for me to say a few words
r )f welcome to the new class of 1912;
some of these may pass over their
heads to the upper classes.
"All I would say seems to have
been said already by some one or bv
many who can say it better than I.
For I find the Stanford Spirit is abroad
again, never stronger than today. Nev
er mind the past. Get into the future,
'et together. Work together.
"Stanford University is the gift of a
man and woman who believed in
young men and young women—who
believed in education, for training
for success in life.
"Education means work. What comes
easy is not education. It is not worth
taking. Free lunch is a poor sort of
meal.
"While you are here, your work ij
the only real thing. All things else,
all student activities are by-play—we ? l
enough in themselves, but never to b<

| sought as ends. We hear much said
I of what the student does or may do
j for liis University. No student can dj
j anything else so important as doing
| his college work. We believe in stu
j dent athletics so long as athletes are
j students. The curse of athletics is the
j professional athlete, who is not a stu
| dent, but yet wears the student's
j badge. We would like to see every stu-
I dent an athlete, evey one in the field
|as a player; but the student in thri
bleachers is not in athletics. Shout
ing for the team, betting on the team,
do not mean college spirit. Get into
the game. Got into the work. Be a
put of the University, else you had
better go home. Try for something
real somewhere else.
"You must learn to respect your
selves. You must not injure your
selves or others. The tradition of
Stanford is that it drops off the edge
of the campus all who do it more harm
than Stanford can do them good.
"One harm that a student may do
is to hurt the reputation of his college.
One of the worst advertisements of
college is a drunken collegian.
"You will not find many laws here
telling you what you must do. You
must write your own prohibitions. To
say no at the right time is the best
test of manliness. Besides, the fac
ulty cannot enforce its laws if it
makes many. The men are here to
teach you, to inspire you, not to give
you punishment, even when you need
it. You must choose for yourselves,
and you must choose right. Just now,
you must cut out Menlo, or cut out
Stanford. There is no middle ground.
Do not ask how far you may go and
keep out of reach of the faculty com
mittees. Look the other way or else
go home. If you cannot make your
selves immune to the temptations of
evil resorts, we cannot train you for
success in life.
" 'The flower of life is red. Red Is
the color of Stanford—the color of
strength. It is not pale blue of anae
mia, nor yellow, nor dark brown.
These are off-color. Whatever is off
color of conviviality, in good fellow
ship, in athletics, in journalism, in life
anywhere is not for us. It is not the
Stanford shade. It does not bear the
Stanford mark. It is not at home on
our campus."
Dr. J. C. Branner followed Pres
ident Jordan. He chose as his subject
"Loyalty." He gave an interesting
and instructive talk. "A man who is
not loyal is not wanted by anybody
or good for anything," he said. "Love
may make the world go around, but
it is loyalty that holds the world to
gether." He went on further to tall
of the importance of loyalty in all
walks of life.
Roth, who followed Dr. Branner, in
addition to his plea for the co-operation
of the undergraduates, gave a brief
history of the obstacles which had
been overcome by past generations of
undergraduates. He told of the dark
days when it was doubtful whether the
buildings would be exempted from
taxation, of the many epidemics, of

the earthquake, and lastly of the se
vere rupture of last semester. In
drawing his conclusion he said: "ft
is now to be seen whether we prove
ourselves able of surmounting the dif
ficulties and making corrections for
last semester."
Professor Howard gave a brilliant
speech, dealing with "Stanford Spirit."
The newly appointed member of the
faculty held the rapt attention of the
audience, and was given a hearty
round of applause. The substance of
his speech was: "You cannot get
Stanford Spirit by artificial meam.
Stanford Spirit is a mighty spirit.
Don't think you have the Stanford
Spirit until you feel the courage of life
and devotion to higher ideals from
your very soul."
