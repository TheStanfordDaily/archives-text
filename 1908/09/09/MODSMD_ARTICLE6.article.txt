# CLASS TEAMS CHOSEN
## FIFTEENS WILL PLAY ANNUAL SERIES NEXT WEEK. Preliminary Matches Began Today — Fourteen Rugby Candidates on Rubbing List. 
### 
Tuesday's Rugby practice continued
the same as the work of the first two
afternoons, the time being divided be
tween kicking for touch, passing
rushes, rucking and line-out forma
tions. The candidates from the three
upper classes were assigned to class
fifteens, while there are still four
teams constituted of 1912 players.
Short preliminary interclass matches
began this afternoon, and will con
tinue as often as practicable during
the next few days. The regular se
ries of games between the different
class teams will begin next week. The
Seniors will meet the Juniors, while
the Sophomores will oppose the Fresh
men, the two victorious fifteens play
ing the final and deciding game. It
is probable that all the line-ups will
take place on the turf field.

be made as often as warranted. The
