# PUT OFF SCRUMMAGES
## LINE-UPS SET FOR WEDNESDAY TOOK PLACE TODAY. East Practices Continue.â€”Freshman Backs Perform Cleverly Under Lanagan's Supervision. 
### 
The line-ups scheduled to take place
at the Rugby practice yesterday had
to be postponed until today because
of the failure of the black jerseys to
arrive. Both gray and black uppers
are necessary in order that the con
tending teams may be distinguished.
This afternoon, however, the Seniois
faced the Sophomores, the Juniors
took the field against the first Fresh
man fifteen, while the second and
third division of the 1912 squad fought
each other.
Yesterday being Admission Day and
a legal holiday it was possible for
Coach Lanagan to be on the field. He
took charge of the Freshman backs,
whose work was fast and accurate.
Although their knowledge of the game
will necessarily be of the most limit
ed kind, the first-year team, backs and
forwards, will be sure to play hard
and well against the Barbarians on
Saturday.
No variation from the former days
marked the practice of yesterday, save
that a large portion of the work was
done on the turf field, where all ol*
the scrummages today were held. Just
before Wednesday's practice was con
cluded, the different fifteens lined up
against one another and endeavored
to rush the ball over their opponents'
goal.
W. D. Fletcher, captain of the 1911
Freshman team, has added his name
to the list of those already signed up,
while G. C. Faulkner, fullback of the
1910 fifteen, will make his first ap
pearance on the gridiron next Monday.
