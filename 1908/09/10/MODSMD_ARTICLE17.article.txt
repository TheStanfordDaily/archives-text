# Change in Mining Course Announced.
## 
### 
The former course in the Depart
ment of Geology leading to the de
gree of Mining Engineer, has been
systematized, so as to form a regular
ly prescribed five-year course. Tbe
main difference is that the work of
the fifth year heretofore required has
been consolidated with the regular
four-year course leading to an A. 11.
degree, and that several culture
courses, among them Business Law
and English Composition, have been
introduced.
This change will apply to all those
desiring the degree of M.E. who en
tered the department in the fall of
1907 and each year thereafter.
