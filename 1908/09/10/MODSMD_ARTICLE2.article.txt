# DR. SNOW MAKES STATEMENT.
## Students Whose Vaccination Did Not "Take" Will Be Revaccinated Without Charge. 
### 
Because of the erroneous statements
that have been circulated on the
campus in regard to vaccination, Dr.
W. F. Snow makes the following dec
laration :
"All the physicians of the commu
nity agreed to vaccinate the studenr.n
applying to them for an initial charge,
which would cover subsequent inspec
tion and a re vaccination, if the lire
attempt did not result in a "take."
This initial charge varied with the in
dividual physicians from 50 cents to
$2. There will be an additional charge
made by the physicians in complying
with the committee's requirements of
a completed record. Each student win
did not go back to his physician after
being vaccinated last March should
report at once to the committee an 1
receive instruction concerning the
completion of his record."
