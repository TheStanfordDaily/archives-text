# WILL GIVE ORATORIO
## THE 						"STABAT MATED" WILL BE SUNG ON THE CAMPUS. Special Chorus and Orchestra Will Assist.â€”Rehearsals Begin Soon. G.C. Buehrer to Direct. 
### 
Unless the present plans miscarry,
the oratorio "Stabat Mater" will oe
given on the campus this semester. It
is planned that it shall be rendered
with a full orchestra and a large
chorus. This is the largest musical
undertaking that has been attempted
since the earthquake, and will require
the interest and co-operation of the
University community in order to
make a success of Rossini's master
piece.
Organist G. C. Buehrer, under
whose direction the oratorio is to be
presented, will endeavor to give all the
solo parts to local talent, in so far a3
he is able. If he finds voices that are
capable of rendering such solos ay
the great tenor solo of the Stabat,
"Cujus Animam," or the soprano solo,
"Inflammatus," he will favor residents
of this community over outsiders. He
hopes to be able to give all the solo
work to University people, but if he
fails in this, he will have to fall back
upon outside talent. Besides the solos
mentioned, the soprano and alto duer,
"Quis est Homo"; the alto solo, "Fac
Ut Portem," and the great bass solo,
"Pro Peccatis," are almost equally
well known. There are also several
quartet numbers, one selection having
a baritone solo.
The orchestra will be one especially
trained for the occasion. The director
does not feel that he can ask the Uni
versity orchestra for this event, be
cause they already have so many reg
ular University engagements for which
they are expected to play. Organist
Buehrer hopes to have both men and
women in the orchestra, and as many
professional musicians will be added
to the organization as are necessary
to insure the best results. Rehear
sals will begin as soon as all the
plans are perfected, and will occur
once a week.
This oratorio is one of the most fa
mous, and has been given frequently
in the world's musical centers. Be
fore the earthquake, it was the cus
tomary .musical event of the Lenten
season in San Francisco. Organist
Buehrer's idea in giving the oratorio
is to develop in every way he can the
musicaj element in the student body.
The composer of this great work,
Rossini, is one of the most noted fol
lowers of the later Italian school,
and (he author of the opera "William
Tell." The "Stabat Mater" was orig
inally written for a friend of Rossini.
At the time of its first, production,
the last few numbers were supplied
by a friend, but at a later date Ros
sini rewrote the Inst part and sold
the entire rights of production to a
Parisian impresario for a large sum.
