# PERFECTS INVENTION
## C.F. ELWELL SUCCEEDS WITH WIRELESS TELEPHONE. Graduate in Electrical Engineering Develops Wonderful Instrument for Commercial Use. 
### 
C. F. Elwell, '07, a graduate of the
Electrical Engineering department,
has attained considerable distinction
in the scientific world through his
work in perfecting the wireless tele
phone apparatus invented by Francis
McCarty of Oakland. Since the death
of the young inventor two years ago,
the invention has remained undevel
oped, owing to the fact that no one
understood the patents covering it.
In April of this year, however, the
McCarty Wireless Telephone Com
pany secured the services of Elwell as
an electrical engineer to develop the
patents and devise means of convert- 1
ing the invention into a practical com
mercial utility. Four months of ex
perimental work and tests have en
abled Elwell to demonstrate the suc
cess of the telephone, and the com
pany will now proceed to put the
apparatus on the market.
Tests made in the vicinity of the
campus have proven satisfactory for
a distance of three-fourths of a mile,
the message being distinctly audible
and even clearer than with the ordi
nary telephone. Messages have also
been transmitted from a station in
Palo Alto to one in Mountain View, a
distance of five miles, with equal
success.
It is the belief of Elwell and his as
sistants that only the manufacture of
more powerful sending apparatus re
mains before messages can be trans
mitted fully as far as is now done by
wireless telegraph. The telephone has
many advantages over its earlier
wireless rival, as it does not require
the services of an expert operator and
can handle about six times the vol
ume of business.
The first installation of the Mc-
Carty wireless apparatus, where the
iÂ»ss be on the battleships, where the
government requires an efficiency
test of five miles, which can easily he
met by even the present crude ap
paratu.i, as it is much easier to send
over water than land. The phone
works on the Hertzian-wave principle
applied in the wireless telegraph.
