# GIVES LIE TO RUMOUR
## REPORTS ON CONSTRUCTION OF UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS. John Sewell, for Geological Surrey, Made Investigation After the Earthquake. 
### 
After the earthquake of April, 1908,
had destroyed so many of the Univer
sity buildings, reports became cur
rent that those connected with their
erection had not followed out the con
tracts; that poor materials had been
used; the walls filled up with trash,
and an insufficient amount of steel
work put in. John S. Sewell of the
United States Geological Survey Da 3
shown that these rumors were wholly
unfounded by his statements in Bulle
tin 324 of the United States Geological
Survey.
In his report to Brigadier-Generai
Alexander Mackenzie, Chief of Engi
neers, United States Army, he poin.ed
out that there were three dist'net
fypÂ°s of buildings. The first of these
was the class in which were the old
buildings, built in the early days by
liiied labor, under the direct super
vision of Governor Stanford. Tlie>e
buildings were faced with sandstone,
the cut-stone having good, wide beds,
carefully laid and solidly backed up
with brickwork. Though damaged,
they were by no means beyond repair.
The second type of buildings includ
ed those erected more recently, some
not entirely completed. Here the
sandstone facing was thinner, the beds
were not so well cut, nor so wide, and
the backing was not so good. The
mortar was examined and found to be
of a better grade than that used in
ordinary commercial work. In shor*,
Sewell pointed out that these build
ings conformed to the modern com
mercial standard of building construc
tion, and that they were not of a i.yoo
that would indicate culpable negli
gence or incapacity on the part of
any one connected with their design
and erection.
The third class, or type, included
those built of concrete, as examples,
Roble Hall and the central portion of
the Museum. The two brick wings of
the latter building were shaken down,
while in the concrete portion a few
cracks opened, but they were of no
serious consequence. The only dam
age done to Roble was caused by a
chimney crashing through the roof.
The damage as a whole shows, ac
cording to the report, not that the con
structors were blamable, but that the
old methods of solid construction were
superior in the durability of buildings
than the modern methods.
