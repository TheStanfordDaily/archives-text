# DISCUSS QUAD IDEAS
## JUNIORS TALK OF ANNUAL TO BE PUBLISHED IN APRIL. Editor Adams Assigns Departments to Members of Board.â€”Two New Appointees. 
### 
The 1910 "Quad" board held the first
meeting of the year at the Delta Gam
ma house last evening, when Editor
F. A. Adams called his associates to
gether to discuss plans for the class
annual, to be issued next April. Be
yond the distribution and assignment
of the various departments among the
members of the staff, little definite ac
tion was taken, though many sugges
tions in regard to the contests and ap
pearance of the volume were presented
and discussed. In order that the book
may be published at the earliest pos-;
sible date after the Junior festivities
in March, the editor has insisted that
as much of the material for the book
as can be gathered at present must j
be in the hands of the printer as soon
as the contract is signed, probably a
month from date.
Two new associates have been named
by Editor Adams. They are H. F.
Allen and J. M. Wadsworth.
In general arrangement and appear
ance, the 1910 annual will conform to
the precedent set by previous "Quads,"
though it is hoped to improve the dur
ability of the binding by obviating the
usual rush in taking the books from
the bindery. The quality of paper and J
number of pages will necessarily j
somewhat with Manager C. W. Mason, i
There is a probability that one or
more new departments will be added
to give individuality to the volume,
while the present departments will bo
rearranged with the view of giving
precedence to the departments of
greater interest to the student body.
Especial attention will be paid to the
art work in the book, and some new
departures in this line are being
planned. However, L. S. Scott, who is
in charge of this work, finds himself
severely handicapped by the fact that
neither A. S. Macdonald or F. M. Ack
ley. the two best-known artists of the
Junior class, are registered this sem
ester. Athletics will also be given a
large proportion of space, in order to
n'.low for copious illustrations. The
department of the college year will be
continued, as instituted by the class
of 1909.
The departments as now assigned
to the different members of the board
are: Miss N. Graves and Miss M. How
ell, Dramatics and Music, Women's
department and Sororities; S. A. Liti
dauer, Debating; W. P. Fuller, Jr., and
C. H. Hails, Athletics; A. Wright and
J. H. Polhemus, Organizations and
Honor Societies; T. C. Henry and J. P.
Levy, Fraternities and College Year;
L. O. Macomber, Founders, Faculty ami
Classes; H. F. Allen, Publications anJ
Literature; L. Scott and J. M. Wadp
worth, Art.
