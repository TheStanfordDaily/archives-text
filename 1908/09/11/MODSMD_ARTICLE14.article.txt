Interest in the first match game of
the Rugby season and loyalty to the
Stanford teams that will compete
should bring out a large and enthu
siastic crowd tomorrow. The mate
rial for the Freshman fifteen is this
year good. Everything that can be
doue should i.t* done to make the sup
port of the spectators equal to the
merit of the players. The yell-lead
ers will be present at the contests to
morrow, and the men of the Univer
sity would do well to make the most
of their opportunity to practice the
songs and cheers and get behind the
teams at the same time.
For the last three years the inter
collegiate Freshman games have been
won consecutively by the University of
California. The Stanford first-year
men are at a slight disadvantage iu
not having as long a season as their
freshman rivals in which to learn a
new game. In defense of the 1911
Stanford team, it should be said that
they were tremendously outweighed.
If the members of the Class of 1912
show as good a fighting spirit as last
year's Freshmen, with their material,
coaches, traijier, excellent facilities
and the strong support of the student
body, the Cardinal should be victorious
on October 17.
