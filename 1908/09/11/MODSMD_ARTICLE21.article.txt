## 
### 
Pursuant to the call issued by tho
Intersociety Debating League, a num
ber of Freshmen met in room 231 of
the History building last evening, and
perfected a permanent organization of
the Freshman Debating Society. The
following officers were elected to serve
during the present semester: Presi
dent, F. Russell; vice-president, N.
Wilson; secretary, C. Richardson;
treasurer, E. Marr.
The next regular meeting of the so
ciety will be held at the same place
next Monday evening at 7:30 o'clock,
and an informal program has been ar
ranged for that time. It will consist
of a general discussion of the Demo
cratic and Republican platforms. In
addition, a short address will probably
be given by some member of the fac
ulty. The standing committees are also
to be appointed at this meeting, and
all Freshman debaters will be wel
comed.
