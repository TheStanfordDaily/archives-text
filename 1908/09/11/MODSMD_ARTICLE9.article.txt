# PLAY GAME TOMORROW
## 1912 WILL PLAY BARBARIANS ON STANFORD FIELD. Seniors Will Face Juniors, While Sophomores Will Oppose Second Freshman Fifteen. 
### 
The first Rugby game of the season
that between the Freshmen and Barba
rians, will be called on Stanford Field
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
Just one hour previous to the begin
ning of this contest, the Seniors and
Juniors will oppose each other for a
short line-up. At the conclusion of
this match and before the Barbarian
game, the Sophomores will meet the
second Freshmen. The one admission
will be good for all three matches. The
first two will be merely preliminary
line-ups, and will have nothing to do,
except as practice matches, with the
regular series, which will take place
next week.
Several familiar faces will prob
ably appear with the Barbarians to
morrow. The exact personnel of their
team, however, has not yet been decid
ed. The Freshman team, as announced
for Saturday's struggle, is necessari
ly only temporary, and many changes
are sure to occur constantly. In less
than a week it has been impossible for
the coaches to choose from eighty
candidates the fifteen best fitted for
their positions. The 1912 fifteen, as it
will line-up tomorrow, follows:
Crandall, R. Smith, Cilker, Hails,
Schaupp, Partridge, Gilmore, for
wards; Whitney, wing forward; Don
ovan, half; Erb, Sbarboro, fives; A.
Sanborn, center; T. Sanborn, Coleman,
wings; Brown, full.
The preliminary interclass scrum
mages held yesterday were hard and
fast, and for the most part close.
Promptly at 4:45 o'clock the Seniors
lined up against the Sophomores, and
at the end of two short halves the 1909
team had scored 14 points against
their opponents' nothing. The for
wards of the Senior fifteen played a
remarkable game, and, had they re
ceived adequate support from the
backs, the score would have been
much larger.
The next contest, between the Ju
niors and th? first Freshmen, proved
the surivise of the afternoon. The
first-yea- men put up a sturdy defense,
and 1910 was unable to tally during
the initial half. After the second kick
off the advantage was clearly with the
Freshmen for the first few minutes,
but shortly before time was called the
upper-class team braced up noticeably,
scoring 8 points.
The second and third Freshman
teams played a nothing-to-nothing tie.
Although their work as a whole was
in no way exceptional, several individ
ual players showed up exceedingly
well.
Each of the three line-ups consisted
of two halves, the first one of five min
utes, and the second lasting ten min
utes. In the middle of the last period
the substitutes on the respective fif
teens were putin the game. No in
juries marred the afternoon's work.
