# REV. WILLIAM RARER PREACHES.
## Many Listen to Interesting Sermon on Temptation, Rendered in Chapel Yesterday Morning. 
### 
Rev. William Rader of the Calvary
Presbyterian Church of San Francisco
preached to a large and attentive
audience in the chapel yesterday
morning. The subject of his sermon
was "Temptation" and he took for his
text the verse, "Then was Jesus led
up of the Spirit to be tempted of the
devil," Matthew IV, 1.
The preacher began by saying that
the wilderness should be thought of as
real life and the temptation of Jesus
was his entrance into the arena of his
true mission. The devil is the Bible's
personification of sin.
Dr. Rader said it is not wrong to be
tempted. Only the useless and un
worthy escape temptation. The burg
lar pays you a compliment when he
breaks into your home because he sus
pects that you have treasure which
he does not possess. According to Dr.
Rader temptation is a revelation cl
the imminence of God in the world.
Furthermore it is a revelation of one's
self. A man does not know his
strength or weaknesses until he has
been tried and tested. Each man mu-it
fight his own devil. Only those who
have suffered the same temptations
are capable of sympathizing with
others.
The message of religion is that it is
possible for every man to overcome.
This message is the encouragement
which comes from the life of Christ to
every man who is weak, to be brave
and be of good courage in the wilder
ness of temptation.
