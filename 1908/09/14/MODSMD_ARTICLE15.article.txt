# Junior Plugs are on Sale.
## 
### 
The plugs for the 1910 Plug Ugly
have been secured by "The Toggery"
and will be on sale during the present
week. According to the agreement
made with this firm by the plug com
mittee, the plugs were secured by "The
Toggery" to be sold at cost, all the
risk being taken by the company. This
is the same agreement which was
made with the Class of 1909, and the
same grade and style of plug will be
supplied as was furnished last year.
As the risk of having hats left unsold
is being taken by the firm with no
profit on those sold there will be no
reservations made, and owing to the
limited number of plugs ordered it ij3
advisable for all Juniors intending to
take part in the annual Plug Ugly to
purchase their plugs at once. The
price is $1.15, as last year.
