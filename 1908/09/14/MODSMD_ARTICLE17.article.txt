# NEW BODY DIFFERENT
## PRESIDENT'S CONFERENCE NOT NOW SUSPENDED. Dr. Jordan Plans to Meet Representative Men Who Stand High In Their Departments. 
### 
The newly organized University Con
ference which will hold its initial
meeting at the home of President Jor
dan on Wednesday evening is not in
tended to supersede the President'*
Conference of last year, but originated
in an altogether distinct and separate
purpose from that which actuated the
formation of the former assemblage.
Such were the sentiments expressed by
Dr. Jordan this afternoon in regard to
the proposed association of depart
ment representatives.
In an interview on the subject of
the new Conference the President stat
ed that the main purpose in calling to
gether the men from the different de
partments was that he might have tho
opportunity to meet representative men
of high scholarship who stood well in
the estimation of their d-parLuonts.
This is partially the result of an it
tempt to devise means of becoming ac
quainted with more of the representa
tive University men, and partially to
the desire to take up matters of a dif
ferent nature from that brought be
fore the former President's Conference.
This difference was brought out oy
Dr. Jordan as follows: "In the Presi
dent's Conference we met representa
tives from various student body orga
nizations and discussed questions deal
ing with the relations between the stu
dents and the faculty, while in the new
organization we will meet representa
tive men from the various departments
who stand high in scholarship and in
the opinion of their professors, arid
will take up matters which deal more
intimately with the relation of the in
dividual to the University as a whole.
T do not yet know whether I will call
together the old conference during the
present semester or not, but in no
sense is the University Conference in
tended to supersede the former organi
zation. It is merely the means )f
meetin representative men aul diii;us
sing with them matters of University
interest."
The following men have been chosen
to represent the various departments,
though some branches of the academic
life of the University have failed to
select representatives, owing generally
to a lack of available material: Law,
.T. E. Stewart, 'OS, W. C.
A. E. Roth, '09; English, F. H. Ashley,
