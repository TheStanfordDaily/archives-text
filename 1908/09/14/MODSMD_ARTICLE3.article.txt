# BARBARIAN TEAM WINS
## VISITORS SCORE SIX TRIES IN SECOND HALF. Freshmen Hold Opponents to 0-0 Tie in First Period 1909 and 1911 Victorious. 
### 
That the 1912 Freshmen will be rep
resented by a formidable Rugby fifteen
was plainly evidenced by the determiu
d showing made by the first-year play
ers in the opening period of their te:>t
with the experienced Barbarians last
Saturday. Although the final score stood
24 to 0, neither side had succeeded
in tallying at half-time. Immediately
after the kick-off in the second half,
however, the visiting forwards took
a marked brace and managed to get
the ball out to the speedy three-quar
ters, whose dazzling style of play com
pletely demoralized the Cardinal no
vices. Furthermore, the limited train
ing of the Freshmen began early in
I the last period to have a telling effect
upon them. With from ten to fifteen
minutes left to play Coach Presley sub
stituted an almost entirely new fifteen,
which, as was to be expected, found it
self entirely unable to withstand the
invincible rushes of Captain Elliott
and the other Barbarian backs.
The work of the Freshmen was never
theless extremely good. Very few of
the fifteen men possessed the slightest
knowledge of Rugby previous to the
opening of the present season, and only
six practices occurred before this
meeting with the San Francisco team.
The latter aggregation is composed
for the most part of men who have
played the game for years. The first
year forwards all put up a fine exhibi
tion. For the initial game of the year
their team-play was exceptional. The
defensive work of the backs was u,i
to the average, while little could be
j expected of them on the offensive with
; so small a knowledge of the game and
with such aggressive opponents.
Brown, at full, seems to be of a cali
bre almost, if not quite, equal to that
of his namesake, the sensational 1911
full-back.
The spectacular passing and rushes
of the Barbarian backs were almost
wholly responsible for all of the six
Jries, three of which were converted by
Captain Elliott. Their combination
was splendid, and the three-quarters,
when once started, swept all before
them. The line-ups follow:
Barbarians—Brown, Sands Clarkson,
Moverly, Price, Hamilton, Buckingham,
forwards; Walters, wing forward; Hy
land, Goff, halves; Elliott, Earle, Poni
eroy, Sharpe, three-quarters; Shanks,
j full.
Freshmen—Crandall, R. Smith, Cilkor
TTails, Schaupp, Partridge, Gilmore,
forwards; Whitney, wing forward;
Donavan, half; Erb, King, fives; A.
Sanborn, center three-quarter; T. San
born, Coleman, wings; E. Brown, full.
The 1912 substitutes were: Benett,
Henderson, Hedeman, Doran, Everett,
Hubbard, Corbet, Macready, Dickinson,
Kennedy, Reynolds, Sundell, Bemati,
Before the Freshman-Barbarian con
test the Seniors faced the Juniors and
the Sophomores lined up against the
second Freshman in two short games.
Fast play characterized the match be
tween the upper-class fifteens, which
ended in a 9 to 0 score in favor of the
■ 1909 team. The underclass contest
! Avas far less spirited. The Freshmen

fought gamely and succeeded in more
than holding their own during the first
half. In the last few minutes of play,
however, the 1911 athletes managed to
secure a victory by the meager score
of 3 to 0.
