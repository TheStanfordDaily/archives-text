A few nights ago the numerals of
the Freshman class were placed on
the bleacher fence of Stanford Field
and also on the Encina tennis courts.
Complaint has already been expressed
at these unsophisticated actions. The
Freshmen should know that the naw
athletic fields and their immediate
surroundings are exempt frcm the de
facement which is decoration whan
put on surfaces that are not held
sacred. Of these there are plenty.
The tennis players have made serious
objection to the use of the courts for
class advertisement, and not the least
cause for their taking this position Is
the nature of the material employad
and the annoying condition in which
it remains. The responsibility forth 3
complaints that have been expressed
lies with the Freshmau Class, wlio.se
members should mend at once the in
fractions of custom that have been
committed. If they wish to paint,
they must find the proper places.
