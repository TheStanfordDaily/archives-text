home at College Terrace. The house,
which has just been completed, is a
two story frame dwelling of modern
type, and is completely furnished.
There are now twenty members of
the Association, nine of whom live in
the clubhouse. The building is leased
from private parties. The Associa
tion officers for this semester follow:
President, T. Motomura, '09, secre
tary, Y. Murakami, '11, treasurer, K.
Mochizuki, '11, executive committee,
