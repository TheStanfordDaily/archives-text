C. Thomas, '12. The test was to play
a solo before a committee consisting
of F. D. Mahone, '08, L. J. Hart, '09,
R. A. Gott, '09, and F. H. "Wilson, '10.
The try-out last evening was the first
one of a series, which will last until
the Varsity club is announced.
The Mandolin Club could usa more
guitars and Leader Gott wishes men
>o play that instrument to confer
with him. While this section of the
club is not very noticeably weak at
present the addition of a few guitars
to the organization will give better
balance to the music.
