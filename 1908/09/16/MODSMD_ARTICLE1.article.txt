# PLANS FOR 1910 QUAD
## ALL ASSESSMENTS MUST BE PAID THIS SEMESTER. Financial Outlook for Annual Very Good. J.E. Shelton Appointed to Board of Directors. 
### 
The board of directors of the 1910
"Quad" held a joint meeting with the
editor and business manager last night
and made a careful survey of the work
to be done to publish the book. The
probable receipts and expenses were
carefully estimated and many details
connected with the securing of adver
tisements and the issuance of the book
were discussed. According to the sur
vey of the advertising field made by
the manager this summer, the financial
prospects of the book are exceptional
ly good. Business conditions in the
bay cities have greatly improved dur
ing the past few months and the mer
chants are more liberal in buying ad
vertising space. Bids for the printing
of the book will be submitted to the
manager some time this week and the
contract will probably be awarded
in the near future. A large number
of firms have signified their intention
to bid on the work, and it is very prob
able that more contracts can be made
this year than the Class of 1909 se
cured.
The manager and directors decided
to inaugurate a change in the manner
and time of collecting the "Quad" an
sessments. In order to get the book
out in due season it will be necessary
for all assessments to be paid this
semester. Money is needed to pay
for pictures and cuts and for other
expenses of the gathering of the ma
terial for the annual.
It is the present plan to issue the
book somewhat earlier this year than
formerly and also to improve on the
binding that has been done hereto
fore. To do this it is necessary that
the publishers have a longer time in
which to keep the book in the presses
during the binding process. This can
only be done by getting all copy and
material to the printers earlier than
usual, which will in turn necessitate
the early payment of the assessments.
Manager Mason is preparing to send
statements covering the assessment
to each member of the class the first
of next week. All Juniors will be urg
ed to make their remittance as soon
as possible so as to expedite the work
of the editors. All those who do not
pay their assessment this semester
will be denied the privilege of having
their pictures in the book. The as
sessment is and those paying will
be entitled to buy the book for the re
duced price of $1.50.
Trie vacancy on the board, caused by
the absence from college of C. 11. Ben
son, has been filled by the appoint
ment of J. E. Sheiton. The personnel
of the Board at present is: B. F. Biclt
el, R. Little, J. E. Sheiton, E. M. Leaf,
J. B. Bubb, chairman.
