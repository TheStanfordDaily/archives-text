# TRUSTEES DO NOT FAVOR MAKING STANFORD A GRADUATE SCHOOL
## President Davis Explains at Length Traditions of University, and Governing Body Disapproves of Dr. Jordan's Plan. 
### 
At one of the sessions of the Board
of Trustees held during the summer j
months, the annual report of the Pres- '
ident of the University was read, and
the suggestions contained therein came !
up for discussion. In this report Dr.
Jordan had embodied his plans for |
converting Stanford into a graduate
University of eliminating the two >
lower classes and throwing this part J
of a higher education back to the i
smaller colleges and the secondary
schools.
In view of the fact that the sugges-1
tions looking to this change were not
acted upon by the trustees, in spite
of the declaration by Dr. Jordan that
this alteration in their courses will be
made by all the great universities
within the next five years, a compari
son of the attitudes taken by Dr.
Jordan in spport of the change
and of President Horace Davis of the
Board of Trustees is of interest regard
ing the future of the University.
The stand taken by President Davis
is not one of direct opposition
the principle involved in the plan sug
gested by Dr. Jordan, but the head
of the Board of Trustees asserts that
such a change can not be made in a
short time or at any time before the
secondary schools have grown to a
place where they can take over the
work discarded by the University when
it drops the two lower classes.
The views of the two men are given
herewith that a comparison of the
arguments may be made:
"Thus far," says Dr. Jordan, "Stan
ford has been a large college, well or
dered for the most part, giving good
instruction, and with the highest col
legiate standards. Its university
; work, though not extensive, has justly
commanded respect.
"University work on a large scale
is expensive. If properly undertaken,
it is the choice privilege of the few in-
I stitutions that are generously endow
ed, or that are the educational pride
! of wealthy states. Among these Stan
ford University must stand. To make
I a university, in the world sense, of
Stanford the following elements seem
to me to be essential:
"The elimination, as soon as pos
sible —let us say in the course of five
j years—of the junior college, by the
i uidition of two years to the entrance
: requirements. This need not neces
j warily raise the requirements for the
j bachelor's degree, which would then
J h e, as now, two years of approved
university work beyond the work of
the junior college. These require
J ments are high enough. There is
much to be said in favor of lowering
them to the level of the completion of
the junior college course. This
j • ould correspond to the bachelor's
j degree twenty or thirty years ago.
"With this should follow the ex
tension of the University as such and
the intensification of the higher work.
Especially medicine should be added
to its scope of instruction, and other
lines of advanced work would, natural
-1 iv follow if the University were re

lieved from the burden of elementary
instruction —of work which is done
more or less well in every part of the
juntry."
President Davis of the Board of
Trustees takes the view that the es
sential duty of the University is >.o
keep in touch with the secondary
school system and that no change in
the University curriculum can be
made until the courses of the second
ary schools have adjusted themselves j
to take over the work. He says in
part:
"As a matter of fact, the Board of
Trustees of the University would never
put the institution out of touch with
the common-school system, because
the trust, on which the University is
founded, is tronger on this very point
than on any other. It insists on our
being in close touch with the schools
of the State.
"When President Jordan first made
his announcement concerning his am
bition for Stanford the faculty at the
University gave it serious discussion,
and the decision reached was that the
institution could not afford to detach
itself from the public schools. Then
the trustees, both in general meeting
and in committees, argued the same
question, and at the end arrived at
the same conclusion as the faculty.
"As a matter of fact, we could never
take such a step until the public
schools agreed to meet us. We cer
tainly could not make such a radical
innovation until the secondary school
system was vastly improved. If we
has such a system as the Germans,
with their Gymnasia and other inte *-
mediary schools, we might permit our
selves to retain the idea of transform
ing Stanford into an institution strict
ly devoted t oresearch work. But that
is impossible under present conditions.
"We might cut the university in two
horizontally, but that would leave the
institution in the air. The idea of an
upper and lower school is absurd, un
less the State schools meet us, or the
colleges of the country take such con
certed action that we will be justified
in following them. Before Stanford
can be made a post-graduate institu
tion there must be a great increase in
the entrance requirements. There is
unquestionably an increasing desire to
stiffen the standards, and, as the re
quirements become stricter, the
secondary schools will grow to meet
them, so that eventually it may be pos
sible to put what is now freshman and
sophomore work in the high schools,
leaving the universities more oppor
tunity to develop their post-graduate
departments.
