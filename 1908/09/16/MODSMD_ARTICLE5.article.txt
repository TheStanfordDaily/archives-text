# SENIORS VS. JUNIORS
## INTERCLASS SERIES WILL BE COMMENCED TOMORROW. Upperclass Fifteens to Meet in First Game-1911 Will Play 1912 Next Saturday. 
### 
The first of the annual series of in
ter-class Rugby games will be played
on Stanford Field Thursday afternoon
at 4:45.The Seniors and Juniors will
he the contesting teams, and next
week* the winners will meet the vic
torious fifteen in the 1911-1912 strug
gle, which will take place before the
Varsity-liarbarian match on Saturday.
The game tomorrow, however, will
probably be final and decisive of the
series, for it is almost a foregone cou
clusion that neither the Sophomores
nor the Freshmen will be able to com
pete successfully against either of the
upperclass fifteens. For this reason
unusual interest attaches to the 1909-
1910 match Thursday.
Last fall the Sophomores, who are.
now Juniors, were the iuterclass
champions, defeating 190 Sin the fimtl
contest. In its turn 1908 had defeated
1909. This season, however, the Seniors
are materially strengthened, especiallv
in the scrum, by the addition to then
ranks of several members of the 1908
team who are still in college. Among
these are Koerner, Pemberton, Higley,
Myers, and Miller. With a very ex
perienced and aggressive scrum to off
set the superior efficiency of the Jun
ior baclcfleld, 1909 probably has the
better chance of victory, notwith
standing the fact that the team which
last year won the championship is still
almost intact. Following are the pro
liable line-ups:
1909—Koerner, Terrill, Minturu,
Crawford, Pemberton, Higley, Wallace,
[forwards; Myers, wing forward; Hein
ly, half; Swickard, Roth, fives; Miller,
center; Holman, Thorpe, wings; Oos
sett, full.
1910 —Patterson, Melczer, Cheda,
Hine, Fitting, Yose, Reynolds for
wards; McKenzie, wing forward; Mit
chell, half; Scott, Ganong, fives; Wea
ver, center; Drew, Cook, wings; Jor
dan, full.
Yesterday afternoon the Seniors,
Juniors and first Freshmen were drill

Sophomores lined up against the sec
ond Freshmen, 1911 winning 8 to 3.
