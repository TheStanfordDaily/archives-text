For over two years Memorial Church
has stood unsightly and unused ex
cept on the rarest occasions, and then
by but a handful of persons. The
services must be held in a small and
comparatively ill-equipped chapel, to
the hindrance of the life of the Univer
sity, for it can not be denied that the
religions atmosphere and beauty of
the Church attracted many per
sons who feel the loss of the
magnificent edifice. The absence
of the daily organ recitals is
a detriment to the spiritual life of
the whole community and one that
can not be overcome without the re
fitting of the church. It seems that
this is important enough for a special
force of workmen to be employed to
finish the structure as rapidly as it
can be done. If, by Thanksgiving
Day, the church were occupied, the
services would surely be attended
with the greatest fervor.
