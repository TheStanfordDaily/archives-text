furtherance Of iue various party prop
aganda are bright. Especially is this
true of the Democrats. During the
summer vacation, the Democratic vot

rarily. electing S. J. Talbot, '10, sec
retary. This organization accom
plished the election of H. C. Green,
'08, and H. L. Morton, '08, as dele
gates to the Santa Clara County Dem
ocratic convention.
The formation of this club had for
its ultimate object the organization jf
the Democrats among the voting stu
dents on their return to the Univer

munication with the Democratic State
Central Committee, with a view to
bringing prominent speakers on the
campus at various times during the
campaign.
Talbot has called a meeting of all
interested Bryan men, to be held tn

room 224 of the English building at
8 o'clock Friday evening. At this
time plans for the organization of a
Stanford Democratic Club will be dis
