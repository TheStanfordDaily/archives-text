Freshman spectators of Rugby have
among their number some who are
prone to laughing at the players. Per
haps there are also a few, not Fresh
men, who do not appreciate the work
and the spirit of the candidates for
the Stanford teams and of the coaches
who are bending their utmost effoits
to make those candidates win for their
University. The man who laughs
should try to put himself in the place
of the man who works. For then he
would realize the sting in a thought
less gibe that floats down from the
scoffer on the bleachers to the athlete
on the field who is gasping for
breath. A little reflection on the part
of all will doubtless serve to correct
this fault. Let every man—and wo
man—remember that one attitude
should be maintained toward the foot
ball players—one of encouragement.
