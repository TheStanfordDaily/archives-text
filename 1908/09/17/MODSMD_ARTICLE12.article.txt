# New Electric Furnace in Operation.
## 
### 
Professor D. A. Lyon of the Metal
lurgy department lias recently made
a very important discovery in con
nection with the electric smelting of
iron at Heroult, Shasta county. Pro
fessor Lyon has perfected an electric
furnace in which pig-iron may be
smelted in great quantities without
any diffusion of heat.
The defect in the former method
of smelting iron by electricity has
been that the heat which leaked out
was so intense that it was impossible
for the laborer to work around the
smelting apparatus. The new Lyon
furnace, named in honor of its invent
or. is so constructed as to maintain
the great heat —1800 degrees Centi
grade—without any perceptible radia
tion. This new process will also les
sen the consumption of fuel. The ne v
furnace has now been In operation for
two weeks and by January Ist., 1909,
a large smelter will have been erect
ed.
