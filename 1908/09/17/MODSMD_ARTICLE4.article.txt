# FRESHMEN WIN 8 TO 3
## PALO ALTO FIGHTS HARD AGAINST 1912 PLAYERS. First-year Men Fail to Gain Advantage Until Second Half of Exciting Game. 
### 
Knowing almost nothing of the de
tails of the game of Rugby, fifteen des
perate fighters from the Palo Alto
High School held the Freshmen to an
8 to 3 victory for the Cardinal on
Stanford Field yesterday afternoon.
The visitors put up a plucky battle
against the first-year team, giving the
latter a decided scare in the first half,
which ended with the score 3 to 0 in
favor of Palo Alto. During this period
the Freshman forwards were com
pletely outfought by their opponents,
and consequently the Cardinal backs
had little chance to display their abil
ity. After half-time, however, the
Stanford men took the offensive and
retained a clear advantage over the
High School lads from then until the
end of the game.
Of the changes in the 1912 line-up
the shifting of Erb from five to half
proved most successful. Consider
ing his limited experience at the po
sition, Erb played brilliant; especially
noticeable was his coolness in tight
places. Everett, at center three-quar
ters, showed up extremely well on the
defensive and should prove a valuable
addition to the backfield, once he over
comes his fatal tendency to run to
ward the touch lines when the ball is
in his possession. Brown, as usual,
played a reliable game at full. Hail:-;,
the side rank man, was injured in the
knee and forced to retire. He will,
however, be off the field but a short
time.
The first try of the game was made
soon after the kick-off by Boulware,
of Palo Alto, after a series of passing
rushes. During the remainder of the;
half the oval see-sawed up and down
(he field, and although both goals were
seriously threatened no further scores
were tallied. Early in the second half,
fter several scrums near the Palo Alto
goal, the High School secured and
kicked out of danger, but the 1912
backs immediately started a success
ful passing rush, Everett carrying
ihe ball over the line. Brown failed
o kick a very difficult goal. A few
minutes later Murray scored the last
ry of the afternoon on another pass
ing rush. This time Brown converted,
»nd the score was 8 to 3. Again dur
ing the game the Freshmen were with
in scoring distance but could not get
Ihe ball over the line. Time was call
ed with the pigskin near the center
of the field. The line-ups:
Freshmen —Crandall, R. Smith. Cil
