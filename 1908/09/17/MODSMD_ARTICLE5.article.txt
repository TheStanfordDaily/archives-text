# TO GIVE MODERN PLAY
## ENGLISH CLUB WILL PRESENT SHAW DRAMA. Year Book of Short Stories to be Published in Order to Foster Literary Interest. 
### 
As a survival of an old custom, the
English Club has now under consider
ation the production of a play. At th i
regular meeting last evening it was
practically decided to stage a modern
drama some time during this semester.
The play will probably be G. Bernard
Shaw's "Arms and the Man." The
production of "Arms and the Man"
would mean the exhibit of a drama
truly modern and of a play which i3
rarely offered to the public.
President L. S. Walbridge, '09, was
empowered to appoint a committee vo
ascertain the sentiment of the active
members of the club who were not
present at last evening's meeting an 1
therefore not in a position to give
their views. This committee will have
authority to act upon the consensus
of the opinions of the club members.
As the active members who have ex
pressed themselves are in favor of
"Arms and the Man" it is likely that
this play will be given. In its place
another modern drama would have
the stage.
The cast will be chosen from the
entire student body under the direc
tion and auspices of the club. No
partiality will be shown to club mem
bers as the object is to draw out. new
talent and foster dramatic interest
in the University.
A departure which was suggested
last night is the publication of a year
hook. As the plans stand, the book is
to be composed of short stories chosen
from the English department and also
bv competition. All students are elig
ible to compete. There will be no
compensation, for it is planned to
sell the book at cost. The object is
in no way conflicting with the "Se
quoia" but merely to create greater
literary interest among the under
graduates and emulate a practice
which has done much to help literary
students in other universities.
