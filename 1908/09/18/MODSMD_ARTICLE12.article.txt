The University will have tomorrow
its first opportunity of seeing the Uni
versity fifteen in action this year aga
inst an outside Rugby team. Of
course the so-called "Varsity" is sub
ject to many changes this early in
the football season, but tomorrow's
line-up will be the nearest approach
to the fintl Stanford team that can be
made at this date. This oppurtunitv
should not be missed by a single per
son who is able to view the games.
The teams need all the support they
can get from the peopl on the bleach
ers and th management needs finan
cial backing. While atetndance at
practice has been fair, many mora
persons should be at the contests than j
have turned out so far. The crowd 1
at the interclass game was good; it
is to be hoped that the price of ad- s
mission tomorrow will keep no oru
away.
