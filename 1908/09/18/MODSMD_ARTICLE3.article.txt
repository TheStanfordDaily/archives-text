# 1910 WINS FROM 1909
## SCORE MARKS DEFEAT OF SENIORS IN FAST GAME. Junior Backs Prove Invincible In First Game of Annual Interclass Rug-by Series. 
### 
In one of the fastest games ever
witnessed on the Stanford campus the
1909 Rugby fifteen yesterday we.it
down to defeat before the irresistible
onslaughts of the 1910 players. Ex
citement was rife from the initial
kick-off until the call of time found
the score 6 to 3 in favor of the Jun
iors. As was expected, the 1910 barks
had their opponents at their mercy
throughout the contest, and, further
more, the 1910 forwards put up a
far better tight than was anticipated
against the heavier and more experi
enced Senior pack.
The first try was secured by the
Juniors about the middle of the open
ing half, when Ganong, getting the
ball in a passing rush, carried it over
the line and directly behind the goal
posts The easy conversion was mis
sed, however. From this point until
the end of the half 1910 had a good
advantage, twice forcing the Seniors
to touch down. Soon after the be
ginning of the final period, however,
Holman secured the ball on the blind
side of the three-quarter division and
in a spectacular run advanced it 30
yards down the touch line and over
the goal. By missing the difficult
kick, Miller left the score 3 to 3.
Scarcely had play again begun when
the Juniors forced their way near
the 1909 goal, and by a desperate
plunge Cook just succeeded in regis
tering another try. Mitchell once
more failed to convert. Little advan
tage was gained by either side during
the remaining minutes of play, and
the game ended with the pigskin on
1910's 30-yard line.
Crawford and Koerner, of course,
did excellent work for the Seniors,
while Cheda was the particular star
of the 1910 fifteen. The four backs,
Mitchell, Ganong, Scott and Cook,
were responsible fo temendous gains.
Ealy in the fist half Swickard suc
ceeded Rogers at five in the Senior
line-up, while just before the contest
ended Faulkner replaced Jordan as
Junior full. Coach Presley officiated
as referee. The line-ups follow:
1909—Koerner, McGregor, Minturn,
Crawford, Gay, Higley, Wallace, for
wards; Terrill, wing forward; Heinly,
half: Rogers, Roth, fives; Miller, cen
ter; Holman, Thorpe, wings; Gos

1910—Batterson, Melczer, Cheda,
Mine, Fitting, Vose, Reynolds, for
wards; McKenzie, wing forward; Lit
tle, half; Mitchell, Ganong, fives;
Scott, center; Cook. Arrell, wings;
