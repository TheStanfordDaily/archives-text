# SHOPS ARE COMPLETED
## FORGE, FOUNDRY AND PATTERN BUILDINGS ARE IN USE. New Shops are Improvement Over Old. Highly Regarded by Leading Engineering Experts. 
### 
With but a small amount of interior
painting and exterior finishing yet to
he done, (he new Forge-Foundry build
ing and the Pattern Shop of the Me
chanical Engineering department will
he vacated soon by the artisians who
have heen completing them. Many
classes are being held in them at the
present time although instruction is
given under difficulties.
The work of reconstruction and ex
tension going on in this department
under the supervision of the Commis
sion of Engineers practically stands
completed. Stanford University to
day possesses ,as the frution of the
commission's labors, what are without
doubt the best built and most fully
equipped engineering buildings to be
found anywhere. They represent a
marked improvement in style of con
struction and arrangement over '.he
old style foundry and pattern shops.
The construction is of reinforced
concrete and brick, the use of the lat
ter resulting in the utilization of a
large quantity of old brick which came
from the wreckage of former build
ings. The exterior finish will he the
"pebble-dash," similar in texture to the
exterior of the Stanford Bookstore and
harmonizing with the general effect
of the stone buildings. The machine
shop extension is naturally of stone
in conformity with the original build
ing and with the general mode of con
struction which now obtains in all
of the buildings lying immediately
south of the quadrangle.
The total floor area of the shops is
approximately 34,000 square feet
which should furnish sufficient space
for the demands of the most advanced
systems of shop instuction and for
snch future increase in numbers as
seems probable in connection with
the growth of the University.
The equipment is intended to cover
two classes of tools and appliances.
The first class will include those which
are needed in shop instruction and
with which each student is expected
to gain reasonable familiarity and
skill. Such representative special tools
and items of equipment as shall serve
to illustrate the more advanced meth
ods and equipment for economic en
gineering production will make up
the second class. These tools will be
used largely for demonstration and
as a means of familiarizing the stu
dent with the advanced and special
shop methods which are in use in
the industrial world.
Each shop contains a room for the
recently organized courses of lectures
aid demonstrations. The shops have
teen visited during the summer months
by many leading engineers and all
of them unite in their praise of the
excellence of arrangment and super
iority of equipment of the Stanford
engineering buildings.
