# REVISES FAMOUS BOOK
## PROFESSOR YOUNG IS ONE OF THREE COLLABORATORS. Stanford Faculty Man Assists in Preparing New Edition of Ely's "Outlines of Economies." 
### 
The revised edition of "Outlines of
Economics" by Richard T. Ely is the
name of the new text book for Eco
nomics 1 which is just off the press
of the Macmillan Company and is on
sale at the Stanford Book Store.
This edition will be of special inter
est to Stanford students, owing to the
fact that Professor A. Young, head of
the Economics department was one of
the three professors who have had
charge of the revision of the work.
His collaborators were Thomas S.
Adams, Ph. D., and Max O. Lorenz,
Ph. D., respectively, professor and
assistant professor of Political Econ
omy in the University of Wisconsin.
Professor Ely, the author, is head
of the Economics department at Wis
consin and his book has had the larg
est sale of any economics text book
for the last sixteen years. Of late,
however, it has grown out of date,
and the revised copy is the result.
The new edition has already been
adopted by eight leading universities.
Dr. Young lias been working on the
revision for the last year and it was
only late this summer that the work
was entirely completed. In all, Pro
fessor Young has handled eleven
chapters of the book, dealing prin
cipally with economic theory.
