One of the duties which should,
have been remembered by the Uni
versity people, as a whole, who oc
cupied the bleachers last Saturday af
ternoon, was the reverential singing
of "Hail, Stanford, Hail." The yell
leaders did their part in starting and
leading the hymn. But at the in
stant the last minute of play hal
elapsed, scores of persons left the
rooting section and the seats imme
diately adjacent thereto. Some of
them probably had good excuses for
being in a hurry, but there can be no
justification of the exodus that de
cimated the ranks of the Cardinal
contingent.
Every Stanford student soon learns
that he should uncover when the
hymn is sung. Among the faculty,
however, there are some who seem to
forget or not to realize the true po
sition of this hymn at Stanford. It
will undoubtedly be sufficient to re
mind them that if they remain on the
bleachers during the singing, they
will harmonize with the sentiment of
the whole University by removing
their hats.
