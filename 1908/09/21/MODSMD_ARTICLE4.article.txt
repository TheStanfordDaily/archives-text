# CARDINAL WINS 22 TO 0
## TEAM SHOWS WONDERFUL FORM ON FIRST APPEARANCE. Barbarians Outplayed Forward and Back in Speedy Match.—Freshmen Tie With Sophomores. 
### 
After two tie matches had been
fought on Stanford Field last Satur
day afternoon the Barbarians, of San
Francisco, lined up against the Car
dinal fifteen in the first Varsity game
of the season. Although it was the
initial appearance of the Stanford
team, the match was easily among
the fastest witnessed. Replete with
lightning work and speedy passes on
the part of the college players the
contest was one such as few will ever
have the good fortune to see. Half
time found the score only 3 to 0 in
the Cardinal's favor, but the visitors
were completely outplayed forward
and back during the second period,
the final tally being 22 to 0. Had
there been a less technical referee
officiating, the contest would doubt
less have been even more spectacu
lar and exciting, but Cameron's all
too frequent penalties for the least
infringement marred much of the
play.
It is indeed difficult to pick out
any member of the Stanford team
whose work excelled that of his
fourteen mates, but at least Holman'3
brilliant offensive play was the most
effective. The two Freshmen, Ero
at half and Brown at full, exceeded
the coaches' expectations in their re
spective positions. Erb showed that
he was cool and steady, sure in
picking the ball off the ground and
an accurate passer. Furthermore he
executed several pretty and timelv
quick kicks. Brown's booting for
touch concinued to gain unusual dis
tances, the ball invariably striking
.inst over the side lines. He also
proved his reliability as a tackier by
stopping Captain Elliott in an open
field within a few yards of a try. As
the Barbarian forwards were unable
to hold their own with their oppon
ents, the visiting backs had little op
portunity to exhibit their remarkable
offensive combination and had to con
tent themselves with endeavoring to
withstand the rapid onslaughts or the
varsity three-quarters.
Towards the end of the opening
| half the Barbarian backs inaugurated
a rush near the center of thhe fiel'J,
! but Holman intercepted the pass to
the opposing wing and quickly
! covered the 50 yards to the goal line.
After some clever work by Mitchell
and Holman early in the second per-
I iod Miller registered another score,
while Holman and Scott were respon
sible for the third try. After some j
further startling passes by the Stan
ford backs, in all of which Holman
was prominent, Higley went over the
line for three more points. A moment
later Scott and Holman tallied ;i
fifth try for the Cardinal, and this
was the first one to be converted.!
Then came the most spectacular
play of the afternoon. Captain El
liott got loose in mid-fiebl and wis
stopped by full-back Brown only
few yards from the line. Immedi
ately Miller and Cheda commence!
a dribbling and passing rush which
ended only when Miller was downed
by Coff within ten yards of a try. i
The score was later made by Mitch-1

ell after a rally in which all the
backs participated. Crawford con
verted. The line-ups follow:
Stanford—Koerner, Higley, Miller,
Pemberton, Cheda, Reynolds, TerriU,
Crawford, forwards; Heinly, wing
forward; Erb, half; Ganong, Mitchell,
fives; Scott, center; Holman, Cook,
wings; Brown, full.
Barbarians—Brown, Sands, Scott,
Clarkson, Mowley, Kay, Wilber, Goif,
forwards; Price, wing forward; Ham
ilton. Phillips, Hyland, halves; El
liott, Clark, Pomeroy, Sharpe, threo
quarters; Shanks, full.
The 1911-1912 match ended in a
0-0 tie after two halves of the most
close and even playing imaginable.
Neither side deserved a victory. Each
team was burdened with a single play-1
erin its back-field, whose disheart
ening inability made it impossible
for either fifteen to successfully ex-1
ecute any sort of passing rush.
The Blacks and Grays, two picked j
teams, played one half to a 3 to 3 tie. ;

The 1911-1912 match ended in a
0-0 tie after two halves of the most
close and even playing imaginable.
Neither side deserved a victory. Each
team was burdened with a single play-1
erin its back-field, whose disheart
ening inability made it impossible
for either fifteen to successfully ex-1
ecute any sort of passing rush.
The Blacks and Grays, two picked j
teams, played one half to a 3 to 3 tie. ;
After two tie matches had been
fought on Stanford Field last Satur
day afternoon the Barbarians, of San
Francisco, lined up against the Car
dinal fifteen in the first Varsity game
of the season. Although it was the
initial appearance of the Stanford
team, the match was easily among
the fastest witnessed. Replete with
lightning work and speedy passes on
the part of the college players the
contest was one such as few will ever
have the good fortune to see. Half
time found the score only 3 to 0 in
the Cardinal's favor, but the visitors
were completely outplayed forward
and back during the second period,
the final tally being 22 to 0. Had
there been a less technical referee
officiating, the contest would doubt
less have been even more spectacu
lar and exciting, but Cameron's all
too frequent penalties for the least
infringement marred much of the
play.
It is indeed difficult to pick out
any member of the Stanford team
whose work excelled that of his
fourteen mates, but at least Holman'3
brilliant offensive play was the most
effective. The two Freshmen, Ero
at half and Brown at full, exceeded
the coaches' expectations in their re
spective positions. Erb showed that
he was cool and steady, sure in
picking the ball off the ground and
an accurate passer. Furthermore he
executed several pretty and timelv
quick kicks. Brown's booting for
touch concinued to gain unusual dis
tances, the ball invariably striking
.inst over the side lines. He also
proved his reliability as a tackier by
stopping Captain Elliott in an open
field within a few yards of a try. As
the Barbarian forwards were unable
to hold their own with their oppon
ents, the visiting backs had little op
portunity to exhibit their remarkable
offensive combination and had to con
tent themselves with endeavoring to
withstand the rapid onslaughts or the
varsity three-quarters.
Towards the end of the opening
| half the Barbarian backs inaugurated
a rush near the center of thhe fiel'J,
! but Holman intercepted the pass to
the opposing wing and quickly
! covered the 50 yards to the goal line.
After some clever work by Mitchell
and Holman early in the second per-
I iod Miller registered another score,
while Holman and Scott were respon
sible for the third try. After some j
further startling passes by the Stan
ford backs, in all of which Holman
was prominent, Higley went over the
line for three more points. A moment
later Scott and Holman tallied ;i
fifth try for the Cardinal, and this
was the first one to be converted.!
Then came the most spectacular
play of the afternoon. Captain El
liott got loose in mid-fiebl and wis
stopped by full-back Brown only
few yards from the line. Immedi
ately Miller and Cheda commence!
a dribbling and passing rush which
ended only when Miller was downed
by Coff within ten yards of a try. i
The score was later made by Mitch-1

ell after a rally in which all the
backs participated. Crawford con
verted. The line-ups follow:
Stanford—Koerner, Higley, Miller,
Pemberton, Cheda, Reynolds, TerriU,
Crawford, forwards; Heinly, wing
forward; Erb, half; Ganong, Mitchell,
fives; Scott, center; Holman, Cook,
wings; Brown, full.
Barbarians—Brown, Sands, Scott,
Clarkson, Mowley, Kay, Wilber, Goif,
forwards; Price, wing forward; Ham
ilton. Phillips, Hyland, halves; El
liott, Clark, Pomeroy, Sharpe, threo
quarters; Shanks, full.
