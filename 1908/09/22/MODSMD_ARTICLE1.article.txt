# 1911 WINS FROM 1912
## SOPHOMORE TEAM QUALIFIES FOR INTERCLASS FINALS. Freshmen Lose Second Rugby Game Between Underclass Fifteens by Score of 5 to 3. 
### 
In playing off the tie in which Sat
urday's game resulted, the Sopho
mores yesterday triumphed over the
Freshmen by a 5 to 3 score. The first
half was slow and tiresome, the 1912
pack being completely outplayed oy
the much lighter 1911 forwards. It
was in this period that the Sopho
mores registered their try, which
Carraher converted into a most diffi
cult goal, thus practically saving his
team another tied match.
After half-time, however, the Fresh
man scrum seemed to fight with some
real determined spirit, pushing their
opponents about at will. The 1912
backs were able to do little, as Dick
inson, their half, scarcely ever suc
ceeded in inaugurating a passing ral
ly. Finally, the pack forced the pig
skin near the 1911 line, and a moment,
later Hubbard touched it just as it
rolled across the goal. Brown missed
the kick which was at a hard angle.
During the remainder of the play the
Freshmen continued to threaten the
Sophomore line, but failed to score
again.
Time was taken out several times
for injuries, but the only mishap
which proved at all serious was the
clash between Fletcher and Cilker ir>
the second half. The latter's fore
head was cut, while a deep gash was
made in Fletcher's chin. The line
ups:
1911 —Woodville, Nolan, Killian,
Evans, Swigart, Carraher, Schutz,

liott, half; Carden, Woodcock, fives;
