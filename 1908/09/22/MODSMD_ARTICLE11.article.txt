The rate at which songs and yells
have been received by the judges on
the prize committee has not been
rapid. Now only nine days remain
in which manuscripts may be sub
mitted. As there are many persons
in the University capable of produc
ing original and singable verse, there
should be no dearth of new lays and
cheers when the contest closer.
There has not been a lack of good
material of this kind in past years,
and the advantage of such songs and
yells are plural. Although their in
spirational value is a quality not
necessarily bound up with freshness,
the latter is always a help to suc
cess. It being a piece of work of
some difficulty to write an accepta
ble yell or bleacher song, any person
who would consider such composi
tion should make the most of the
period intervening between today and
October 1, for it will be a service to
his Alma Mater for any one to do his
best to win one of the prizes that
have been offered.
