# MANY SIGN FOR TRACK
## OVER SIXTY ATHLETES WILL DO FALL TRAININGG. Enthusiastic Rally Is Addressed by Trainer Moulton, Captain Horton and Varsity Men. 
### 
At the track rally held in the train
ing house last evening, 61 men signed
up for fall. More than 100 men were
present at the meeting, but many of
those who will he out for track in the
spring are now in football training
and consequently did not sign the
lists. Enthusiasm was shown by
both old and new candidates for track
honors during the short talks deliv
ered by "Dad" Moulton, Captain Hor
ton and several other varsity men.
Captain Horton opened the rally
with a few pointed remarks on the
prospects of the coming season, and
the necessity of having every man
try out and discover what ability
he possesses. He urged the first
year men to come out even if they
had done no previous athletic train
ing ,saying that there would always
be someone to instruct the novices.
Trainer Moultonsaid, in part:
"No athlete in college has as yet
reached his limit in improvement, so
no one can afford to neglect fall
training. It takes six years to devel
op an athlete ,so there is no danger
of overtraining, which is, at best, a
false alarm. Any man who keeps up
consistent work for four years is
bound to make his varsity S. Come
out every day and bring every likely
looking man you know with you."
A. E. Roth, '09, C. B. Bradford, '09
and J. O. Miller, '08, also addressed
the gathering, emphasizing the fact
that new men can never judge their
ability until they try-out. Bradford
and Miller payed high compliments
to the work done by "Dad" Moulton on
the Eastern trip and declared he was
fully equal to Stagg or Williams.
Training will begin immediately
and the men are expected to go out
regularly though no especial rules
will be enforced. Men making good
in the gymnasium try-outs will he
transferred to the track squad. The
new men will be instructed by the
varsity athletes, W. M. Rawles, '09,
quarter; H. L. Horton, '08, hurdles;
