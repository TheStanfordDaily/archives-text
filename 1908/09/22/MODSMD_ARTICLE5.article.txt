# BRITISH COMING
## ANGLO-WELSH FIFTEEN MAY MEET THE VARSITY. Woodward of Vancouver Will Attempt to Secure Rugby Match for Stanford. 
### 
Manager Stewart has been nego
tiating with 11. V. Woodward, the
manager of the Vancouver Rugby
team in the attempt to secure a game
with the Anglo-Welsh team which Is
to visit the coast next week. This
team is a famous British aggregation
being considered one of the star fif
teens of Great Britain and is visiting
the coast for the purpose of playing a
series with the Canadian teams.
Learning that manager Merritt of
California has reserved October 21
in the expectation of securing a game
with the Britishers on that date,
Manager Stewart wrote to Woodward
to secure, if possible, a date for
Stanford.
In his reply Woodward states that
it will be difficult to arrange any
contests with the visitors owing to
the fact that their stay on the
coast is limited to a short time
and their return tickets are
routed via the "All Red Route"
on the Canadian railways. If he ca-i
possibly do so Woodward promises
to make some arrangement that will
enable the British experts to visit
this part of the coast. He has
promised to wire the result of his
efforts so that arrangements can be
made for the entertainment of the
visiting team.
In his letter Woodward calls at
tention to the fact that two years
ago he advised Stanford to become
affiliated with the Rugby Union of
London, England, and makes the
statement that if this action had been
taken, the Anglo-Welsh team would
have received instructions to play
with Stanford as it did to meet the
Canadian teams. He also advises that
Stanford join the Rugby Union now
and thereby be in a better position to
secure games with visiting aggrega
tions in the future. The New South
Wales team expects to visit the coast
in February and he thinks that
games could be secured with it.
