## ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE TO PRESENT GOOD PROGRAM Series of Three Concerts Is Being Planned.â€”Madame Gadski and Others to Appear. 
### 
The committee on Public Enter
tainments is arranging a series of
three concerts to be given in As
sembly Hall during the present year.
Efforts are being directed towards
securing Madame Gadski, the well
known contralto, for one concert,
David Bispham, the American bari
tone, for the second, and the world
famous pianist Gabrilowitcli for the
third of the series. Other concerts
may be given, but whether they will
or not depends upon the season seat,
sale, which will commence as soon
as arrangements are definitely made.
Besides the season tickets, coupons
to single concerts will be sold.
Among the possible attractions are
Madame Nordica and violinists of
note who will tour the coast this
winter. There will be none of the
great orchestral organizations on the
coast this winter.
In past years from time to time
professional lecturers have appeared
in Assembly Hall to whose lectures
admission has been charged. These
lectures have never been successful
from the financial point of view ex
cept in a few rare instances. Bear
ing these facts in mind the present
committee have made no effort to
book any of the paid lecturers who
may be out this way.
When distinguished men visit the
campus or nearby cities they will be
secured to address the University
body by Dr. Jordan, as during the
year just closed. No regular lectur
ers outside of the regular depart
mental lecturers have been engaged,
though it is entirely possible that a
number of men will deliver free lec
tures before the close of this year.
