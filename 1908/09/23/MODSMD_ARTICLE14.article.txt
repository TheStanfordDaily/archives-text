Contributions have been quietly
sought for some time to repay the
kindly loan made by Treasurer C.
Lathrop to enable Stanford's repres
entative at the Olympic games to re
turn home. At present there is still
a small amount to be collected to
wipe out the debt. There should be
no trouble in collecting enough mon
ey for this purpose, for the object is
a worthy one. The members of the
student body are directly concerned
with the representation. of the l/'ni
versity at so famous an athletic
meeting and should without question
respond to the call for aid as readily
as did Treasurer Lathrop, whose ac
tion was taken through kindness.
