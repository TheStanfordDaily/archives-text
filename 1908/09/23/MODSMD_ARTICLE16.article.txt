# Euphronia Calls Off Debate.
## 
### 
The intersociety debate between
the Nestoria and Euphronia liter
ary societies, which was scheduled
for this semester, has been declared
off, the latter forfeiting the contesr.
Euphronia was led to take this action
because of the fact that some of her
most capable members are too bus
ily engaged n other duties to parti
cipate in the proposed debate.
