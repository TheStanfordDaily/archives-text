### 
The marriage of Miss Ethel Ludwig,
'08, to Professor Fred Fitzgerald of
Cooper Medical College, San Franci s
co, was a romantic event of the sum
mer. The marriage was the climax
of a courtship beginning at Stanford
University, extending across the con
tinent and ending at Sacramento.
The match was opposed by Mrs. Lud
wig, she having withdrawn her con
sent and taken her daughter to Chica
go, so as to prevent the ceremony from
taking place when Fitzgerald arrived
there in August. But the young lady
later escaped from her mother ami
hurried across the continent to Sacra
mento. She was met here by Profes
sor Fitzgerald who had returned from
Chicago, and who was informed b/
wire of the circumstances of his fian
cee's coming. An hour after her ar
rival, the young couple were quietly
wedded at the residence of Rev. Rich
ard Rhodda.
