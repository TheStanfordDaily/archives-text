# MUST CHOOSE TRUSTEE
## BOARD MAY CHANGE POLICY IN MAKING APPOINTMENT. Vacancy Caused by Death of Trustee McFarland. Raises Question of Naming An Alumnus. 
### 
Another vacancy has occurred in
the Board of Trustees, caused by the
demise of Justice Thomas B. McFar
land of San Francisco, who was one
of the original 24 placed upon the
board in 1895, Mrs. Stanford was
accustomed to replace by appoint
ment vacancies caused by death or
resignation, but when 20 of the or
iginal members had become inactive,
the number was kept at fifteen,
where it now remains.
Because of the fact that so many
of the board reside at distances from
the University or from any poinc
that is central, the board has not
been able to obtain a quorum of late,
with the result that such important
business as the appointment of a
new trustee has been impossible.
Eight members will constitute the
necessary number to carry on busi
ness and the return of Trustees Mil
ler, Grant and Eells in the latter part
of the month of November will prob
ably enable the board to transact
this very important business on the
last Friday in that month.
The appointment resolves itself in
to a question of whether or not a
member of the alumni shall receive,
this honor. It was the wish of Mrs.
Stanford that eventua' 1 " the board
should be composed entirely of
graduates, which sentiment was evi
denced by the appointment by her of
G.E. Orothers, of the class of lS9r>.
who has now been in this responsi
ble position for 10 years. One trus
tee only has been chosen by the board
itself, the appointment being that of
Wm. Babcock. In this case a decis
ion was reached only after a long
controversy over the policy of
men from the alumni. This next
meeting will be of special interest as
the future policy of the board re
garding appointments may be out-
Ined.
