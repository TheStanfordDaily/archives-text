## CRACK LONDON AGGREGATION WANTS A MATCH. Manager Stewart Receives a Letter Asking for a Series of Games in December. 
### 
Still another Rugby organization of
international reputation has been
heard from by Manager J. E. Stewart
and the possibility of a post-season
game with an aggregation of players
who know the game from "A to Z" is
deemed favorable. The latest club co
be heard from is the crack fifteen of
the United Hospitals of London. Yes
terday Manager Stewart received a
letter which had been forwarded
from Harvard University in which
Ernest MacEwan, secretary of the
London club, asks for a game during
this season.
The English manager explains that
he has heard that the Rugby game
has surplanted the old sport in this
University and is desirable of mak
ing a trans-oceanic-and-continentul
trip for the purpose of comparing
merits of the two teams.
Manager Stewart has written to
the London players for further par
ticulars and will also take the mat
ter up with Manager Merritt of the
Associated Students, of the Univer
sity of California. By the tone of the
letter it appears that a number of the
English players would pay their own
expenses and that if four or five/
games could be arranged on the
coast the players would undertake
the trip. The United Hospitals' Foot
ball Club is said to be one of the best
in England and annually has several
representatives upon the national
team. The membership is drawn Trom
among London medical students and
members of hospital corps.
The middle of December is sugges
ted as the date possible for a match
an dit is likely if the financial ar
rangements can be completed satis
factorily that the English players
would be pitted against the winner of
the intercollegiate game.
