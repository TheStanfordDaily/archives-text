Three weeks from Saturday, Stan
ford Field will be the scene of the
annual intercollegiate Freshman foot
hall game. One of the accessories
necessary to the contest is the Uni
versity Band. So far the band has
not organized and no leader has been
chosen. Some effort at organization
has been made, but the attempts have
been allowed to fail for paltry reas
ons. As there are many places where
rehearsals may be held, a successful
meeting should have occurred long
since. When the manager of the
band issues his next call for new re
cruits, every man in the University
who can play an instrument well
enough to be accepted as a member
should be found among the candi
dates for the band. Some may pro
test that they are unable to play sat
isfactorily. The only way to find our.
is to try-out. If any more time is loot
in getting out a host of players for
the band, Stanford will suffer on
October 17.
