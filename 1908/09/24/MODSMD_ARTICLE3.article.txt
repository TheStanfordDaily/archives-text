# DEBATERS TO CONTEST
## ENTRIES NEARLY ALL IN FOR INTERCLASS TRY-OUTS Sophomores and Freshmen Preparing for Competitions to Be Held for Places on Teams. 
### 
The Sophomore men who will en
ter the try-outs for the 1911 debat
ing team on the evening of October
20 have been arranged in squads by
the Intersociety debating commit
tee, and will begin work at once on
their questions.
The fourteen members of the dif
ferent squads will decide upon their
own subjects for discussion, and up
on their positions as speakers on
the night of the try-out. There are
now two squads of six men, and one
of two, but should any sophomores
desire to fill out the short squad they
may do so by arrangement with the
two now composing it, and with the
president of the Intersociety Debat
ing League.
Each speaker will be allowed
seven minutes in the try-out, with
an additional three minutes for re
buttal.
The squads are composed of the
following men:
First squad—J. A. Visel, F. E. Hill,
F. H. Hilton, A. L. Jacobi, H. S
Tracey, and M. L. Hall; second
squad—W. R. Pittenger, C. J. Miller,
W. S. Porter, J. E. Thompson, G.
Hatfield, K .Van Slyck; third squad—
G. Holcomb, F. V. Acker.
At a meeting of the Freshman le
bating society, held last evening,
thirteen names were received by the
Intersociety Debating League rep
resentative for the try-out for the
1912 debating team, which takes
place on the evening of October 21.
The rules governing the arrange
ment of squads and the choosing of
questions are the same binding the
1911 candidates. The groups of de
baters have been made up by the
league, but the questions and the or
der on the floor will be settled by
each individual squad. If any more
Freshmen desire to try-out, they may
still hand their names to some mem
ber of the Intersociety League.

been put into the following squads:
First squad—E. Marr, W. Tucker,
