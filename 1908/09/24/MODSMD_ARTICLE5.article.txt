# PLAN A NEW MAGAZINE
## MECHANICAL ENGINEERS WOULD PUBLISH JOURNAL. Wish Cooperation of Other Societies and Departments.â€”Amend Constitution. 
### 
If the plans considered by the Me
chanical Engineering Society at its
meeting held last evening carry, a
new publication will soon appear in
the field of Stanford journalism. It
will be in the shape of an engineer
ing magazine which, with the back
ing of such experts as are among the
faculty, alumni and students of the
engineering departments would make
an impression in the technical world.
The plans are entirely in embrio,
but if the other engineering societies
will cooperate in the same spirit in
which the Mechanical Engineering
Society conceived the idea, the new
magazine will become a fact.
It is planned to model the publica
tion after the Sibley College Journal
of Cornell, which is one of the best
college journals along engineering
lines in the counrty. A committee
composed of J. I. Thompson, '09,
chairman, C. Breer, '09, and C. E.
Steinbeck, '09, was appointed to look
further into the matter and report as
to the advisability of the publication
of the journal. Chairman Thompson
is of the opinion that if the other so
cieties will not cooperate, the Me
chanical Engineering Society may is
sue a smaller magazine.
Several other matters of import
ance were disposed of at the meeting
of the society. The constitution wa3
amended so as to require the consent
of two-thirds of the membership for
the admission of a new member. U.
was announced that through the
kindness of Professor W. F. Durand,
head of the Mechanical Engineering
department, room 260 had been se
cured as a permanent clubroom for
the society. R. E. Beckley, '10, was
voted to membership.
The feature of the evening's pro
cram was a talk by P. H. VanEttert,
'09, on "Experience with Dredeers on
the Sacramento River", which a
bounded with interesting information
of a valuable character to those pres
ent . The evening was closed with en
enjoyable social hour during which
light refreshments were served.
