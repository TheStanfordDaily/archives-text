## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NAMES ATHLETIC REPRESENTATIVES Stanford Will Enter Team in P.A.A. Track Meet.—Miller's Record Is Allowed in Half Mile. 
### 
R. \V. Barrett, '04, G. J. Presley, '07
and J. E. .Stewart, 'OK, were appointed
lust evening by the Executive Commit
tee to serve as Stanford's representa
tives on the Intercollegiate Athletic
Agreement Committee for the year 1908-
1909. This body meets once each year
and, as its name implies, revises the
regulations under which the various
contests with the state university are
held.
Secretary Burbank was instructed to
convey the thanks of the student body
to Treasurer Charles (•». Lathrop for his
generosity in advancing $100 as a loan
to Stanford's representative on the
Olympic team, and also to Coach Lan
agan, through whose efforts the atten
tion of Treasurer Lathrop was called to
Bellah's immediate need of money.
Members of the student body have been
asked to contribute as individuals
towards the repayment of this loan and
although the sum has not as yet been
fully subscribed, the Executive Com
mittee directed Manager Stewart to re
mit the full amount to Lanagan, by
whom an equivalent has been given to
the Treasurer.
The question of whether Stanford
should join the Pacific Athletic Associa
tion came up for consideration and after
an extended discussion a special commit
tee was appointed to thoroughly investi
gate the subject pending final action
thereon. California is already a mem
ber of the association.
It was decided to send a track team of
15 men to represent the Cardinal at the
Pacific Athletic Association meet which
is to be held on the new oval at St.
Mary's College of Oakland on October
31. "Dad" Moulton and Captain Ilor
ton will avail themselves of this oppor
tunity to get a line on the [men who are
now in fall training. One year ago at a
similar meet the Stanford team captured
second place with only a few entries.
J. O. Miller's time of 1:58 2-5 in the
half-mile, made last summer in the Con
ference Meet at Chicago, was allowed as
the official Stanford record in that event.
The Executive Committee fixed the sal
ary of the official ticket-taker at $15 per
month for every month that he is en
gaged in work for theAssociatedStudents.
An auditing committee, composed of two
members whose duty it will be to ex
amine monthly the books of the grad
uate manager was established. The pres
ident of the Associated Students is to be
an ex-officio member of this standing
committee
