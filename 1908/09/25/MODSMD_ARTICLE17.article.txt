# Shaw Play Cast Not Yet Chosen.
## 
### 
As a result of the English Club
play try-out yesterday for parts in
"Arms and the Man," those whoso
names are posted on the English
building bulletin are requested by
Professor Gray to meet tomorrow at
2 o'clock in room 205. Each person
is to prepare some scene as given In
the book.
The cast is not yet chosen, so those
who have not tried-out for any part
may do so by arrangement sometime
Saturday morning. The complete
cast will probably be chosen by Mon
day, though it may be necessary to
hold some parts open a few days
longer.
