### 
Contrary to the posters which
were placed ia the windows around
the quadrangle last night, the Olym
pics, and not St. Mary's, will be the
opponents of the Stanford Varsity
in the game tomorrow afternoon.
The first match of the day will be
called at 2:30 , and the Freshmen
and San Jose High School fifteens
will be the contending teams. Imme
diately on the conclusion of this con
test the varsity struggle will com
mence.
The Olympic fifteen has been show
ing constant improvement during the
past few weeks, and Manager Erslc
ine asserts that he will have a strong
aggregation on the field Saturday.
Three of the clubmen, including
Webster, the speedy wing, are on the
injured list, but it is believed that
some of them will be able to play
tomorrow. Among the former Stan
ford men who will be in the line-up
are Chalmers, Vail, Molfino, Hiclcey
and Brennan.
The Cardinal will be represented
by practically the same fifteen thai
appeared against the Barbarians. As
the interclass games have occupied
the greater part of the present week,
the Varsity has had no practice since
the contest of last Saturday. The
line-ups:
Olympics—Hickey, Molfino, Wall
fisc'n, Brennan, Matthews, Aguirre,
Thorpe, forwards: Pomeroy, wing
forward; Miller, half; Vail, Chal
mers, fives; Koch, Kerrigan, Sned
igar, three-quarters; Briggs, full.
Varsity—Koerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Crawford, Pemberton, Reynolds, Mil
ler, forwards; Heinly, wing forward;
Erb, half; Mitchell, Ganong, fives:
Scott, Holman, Cook, three-quarters;
Brown, full.
The Freshman fifteen has bee a
worked hard since last Saturday and
should evince a decided improve
ment against San .Jose tomorrow.
Little is known of the high school
players except that they are fierce
fighters, and they will undoubtedly
make the 1912 team exert themselves
to win. As in the case of the Varsity,
scarcely any change has occurred in
the Freshman line-up. This, of
course, does not indicate that the
first-year team which meets Califor
nia will be substantially the same is
the present fifteen, but merely that
Coach Presley is endeavoring to give
each man who shows any real ability
a thorough try-out. The line-up:
Freshmen —Crandall, R. Smith, Cil
ker, Rodgers, Schaupp, Gilmore,
Hubbard, forwards: Macready, wing
forward; Hatch, half: Whitney, T.
Sanborn, fives; A. Sanborn, Ken
nedy, Murray, three-quarters; Is'n,
