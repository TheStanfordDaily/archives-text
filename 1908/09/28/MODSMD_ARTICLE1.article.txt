### 
The Olympic fifteen of San Fran
cisco, went down to dire defeat Inst
Saturday before the fierce rushes of
the Cardinal Varsity, while (he
Freshmen succeeded in gaining a
victory over the San Jose high school
team. The 1912 game resulted in a
14 to 3 score, while 2S to 0 was the
final tally in the varsity contest.
The Stanford veterans lived up to
their work of the week before, and
the Olympics, although playing a
hard and consistent game, were nev
er dangerous. As usual, the varsity
backs, when once started, swept all
in front of them, while the forwards
completely overran the opposing
pack. Erb, at half, showed great
improvement even over his previous
work, but full-back Brown had some
what of an off day. Scott becomes
more valuable with practice and
Mitchell, Ganong, Holman and Cook,
the experienced players behind the
scrum, go to form an incomparable
backfield. The forwards presented
their full strength and had their op
ponents well in hand, especially in
the loose.
The first try was made at the ex
piration of ten minutes of play on
a passing rally between Ganong and
Mitchell, Miller converting. Terrill
registered the next three points af
ter a 5-yard scrum, and this time
Mitchell kicked the goal. Early in
the second half, the entire backfield
joined in a long passing rush which
brought the score to 13. Mitchell
converted, making it 15. The next
try was secured by Holman, and
once again it was Mitchell that suc
cessfully kicked the goal. A spec
tacular dribbling rush by Cheda and
Iligley followed! some minutes later,
the latter registering the filth score
of the game. The conversion was
by Crawford. Immediately after the
kick-off Pemberton secured the ball
in the Olympic's territory and passed
to Iligley who again crossed the line.
The goal was missed, and time was
called on the first, play after the
drop out. The line-ups:
Varsity—Koerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Crawford, Miller, Reynolds, Iligley,

own. For the most part the backs

The Olympic fifteen of San Fran
cisco, went down to dire defeat Inst
Saturday before the fierce rushes of
the Cardinal Varsity, while (he
Freshmen succeeded in gaining a
victory over the San Jose high school
team. The 1912 game resulted in a
14 to 3 score, while 2S to 0 was the
final tally in the varsity contest.
The Stanford veterans lived up to
their work of the week before, and
the Olympics, although playing a
hard and consistent game, were nev
er dangerous. As usual, the varsity
backs, when once started, swept all
in front of them, while the forwards
completely overran the opposing
pack. Erb, at half, showed great
improvement even over his previous
work, but full-back Brown had some
what of an off day. Scott becomes
more valuable with practice and
Mitchell, Ganong, Holman and Cook,
the experienced players behind the
scrum, go to form an incomparable
backfield. The forwards presented
their full strength and had their op
ponents well in hand, especially in
the loose.
The first try was made at the ex
piration of ten minutes of play on
a passing rally between Ganong and
Mitchell, Miller converting. Terrill
registered the next three points af
ter a 5-yard scrum, and this time
Mitchell kicked the goal. Early in
the second half, the entire backfield
joined in a long passing rush which
brought the score to 13. Mitchell
converted, making it 15. The next
try was secured by Holman, and
once again it was Mitchell that suc
cessfully kicked the goal. A spec
tacular dribbling rush by Cheda and
Iligley followed! some minutes later,
the latter registering the filth score
of the game. The conversion was
by Crawford. Immediately after the
kick-off Pemberton secured the ball
in the Olympic's territory and passed
to Iligley who again crossed the line.
The goal was missed, and time was
called on the first, play after the
drop out. The line-ups:
Varsity—Koerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Crawford, Miller, Reynolds, Iligley,
Evans, forwards; Heinly, wing for
ward; Erb, Elliott, half; Mitchell.
Ganong, fives; Scott, center; Hol
man. Cook, St. John, wings; Brown,
full.
Olympics — Brennan, Hickev.
Aguirre, Bromley, Sweeney, Thorpe.
Matthews, forwards; Pomero.v, wing
forward; Miller, half: Vail, Kerrigan,
fives; Laumeister, Chalmers, Cavan
aiigh, three-quarters; Briggs, full.
Although in the Freshman-San.
Jose game the visitors were first to
score, the 1912 team experienced lit
tle difficulty in finally finishing the
contest, in victorious fashion. Dur
ing the opening half the first-year
forwards were thoroughly outplayed
by the high school pack, but after
half time they more than held their i
own. For the most part the backs
did not have much chance for often-1
sive work, and when they did re- i
ceive the ball for a. passing rush they |

•eldom succeeded in gaining many
yards. The only spectacular try ot j
the match came in the second period,
v,hen A. Sanborn got loose on the 40-j
yard-line and cleverly dodged several
men in his rush for the goal. The j
line-ups:
Freshmen — Corbet, (Ml- ;
ker, Rodgers. Schaupp, Gilmore.
Hubbard, forwards; Macready, wing
