# Shelton Lectures to Socialist Club.
## 
### 
\V. C. Shelton, '08, delivered a lec~
lure to the Stanford Socialist Club
last night upon the reason why he
was voting the Democratis ti<:K«i
Shelton enumerated the salient
points of similarity between the two
platforms and asserted his entire ap
preciation of the socialistic philoso
phy. Nevertheless lie said, the issue
was one of the present hour, and
such being the case, he was going to
support Bryan, who was a man of the
present hour, rather than Debs, a
man of ten years hence.
Shelton was asked to repeat his
lecture in Palo Alto,, and has con
sented to do so—the date to lie an
nounced later. The next lecture and
discussion at the club will be in a
fortnight's time.
