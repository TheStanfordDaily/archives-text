# BERKELEY GIVEN CUP
## BITTNER TROPHY AWARDED TO SECOND PLACE TEAM. Medals to Be Recalled From Harvard Belay Men and Record Disallowed. 
### 
At a meeting of the Board of Gov
ernors of the Stanford Interscholas
ric Association held yesterday morn
ing, it was decided to accept the Bitt
ner Relay Trophy which was return
ed to the association by Harvard
School of Los Angeles, upon the dis
covery of the fact 'hat one of the
members of the team was not eli
gible to compete under the regula
tions of the meet, and the cup was
awarded to Berkeley High School
whose team captured second place
in the race. No stigma whatever is
attached to Harvard School on ac
count of the incident, as it is evident
that both the school authorities and
the other members o-' the track team
were entirely ignorant of the fact
that one of the men in the relay
team was over 21 years of age and
therefore ineligible to compete.
In granting the trophy to the sec
ond place team the governors have
arranged to have the name of Har
vard School removed from the cup,
and that of Berkeley High substitu
ted, as this school is the rightful
winner of the event. It was also
voted to recall the medals issued to
the members of the Harvard relay
team, but no individual medals will
be given to the members <5f the Berk
eley team. The fact that the Har
vard team has been disqualified also
throws out the Interscholastic rec
ord of 3:22 which t1.3 southern run
ners established in this event.
