# FORCEFUL SERMON ON CHARITY.
## Rev. D. Charles Gardner Preaches at the Regular Sunday Service in the Chapel. 
### 
Rev. D. Charles Gardner preached
yesterday morning in the Chapel up
on the text, "Bear ye one another's
burdens and so fulfill ihe law of
Christ." He began liis sermon by
showing how Christ had inaugurated
a new brotherhood among men and
how his ethics as well as the teach
ings of Paul sank deep into the earl\
church. Coming on down to our own
time he said there had never been a
time in history when people have
been as kind, thoughtful, sensitive, or
sympathetic as they are today, al
though there are many sleek, smiling,
selfish people who do nothing to
lighten the burdens of those less for
tunate.
Rev. Gardner went on to say that
our modern idea of charity is to pay
somebody to lift aivtther's burden —
that this method is a l l right as far as
it gooes, but true charity must liave
the real motive of love and personal
sympathy. Again it was pointed out
that to bear one another's burdens
means more than merely personal
sympathy since it carries with it a
social obligation. I r ° touched upon
settlements and showed how it was
the aim of the workers to solve the
problems of the poor by personal con
tact with their problems, and how
this idea of social service and settle
ment work originated in University
centers.
