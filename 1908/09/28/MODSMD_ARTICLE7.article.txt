# THE
						COOK IS VINDICTIVE
## DISCHARGED CHINESE POISONS FOOD SUPPLY. Patrons of University Suffer from Wrath of Celestial When Latter Looses His Job. 
### 
What is generally believed to be
a malicious attempt at poisoning for
revenge upon the part of a discharg
ed Chinese cook has resulted in an
epidemic ol illness which has effected
the students who take hteir board at
the University Inn. Almost without
exception the students and even the
cooks themselves have been attack
er! by the malady
The first effects ol the supposed
poisoning were detected late Satur
day night. A large number of stu
dents living in Encina Kail were
taken seriously sick and it was
thought were suffering from pto
maine poisoning. Dr. R. L. Wilbur
was immediately summoned and was
in attendance the greater part of the
night administering emergency anti
dotes. Before morning relief had
been given to most of the sufferers.
As all the students affected were
boarders at the Inn it was evident
that the cause of the epidemic was
to be found in the food served there.
It then developed that Chin, one of
the Chinese cooks, had been dis
missed Friday night and had left the
place in an unpleasant mood. Dr.
Wilbur has secured samples of all
the articles of food used at the estab
lishment. and will analyze them for
traces of poison which he is confi
dent, caused the sickness. In the
meantime the supply of staples to
which Chin could have had access
has been locked up and entirely new
food procured. Fully 175 students
were affected by the poison.
