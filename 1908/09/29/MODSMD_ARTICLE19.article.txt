The University Band lias started
its activity for the semester with an
enthusiastic try-out. The new offi
cers are men who are qualified to
handle their respective responsibil
ities with credit and should lead the
twenty-five members through a suc
cessful season.
There are several lines in which
the good work started may be con
tinued. While the band encounters
obstacles in preparing new music for:
presentation, its members will be j
amply recompensed for all the ef- j
forts they put forth to this end. New
music should be bought for the or- \
ganization, for the members have i
shown the spirit that will master |
new pieces if they are provided with
such, if regular funds are not avail-1
able for this purpose, a small collec- j
tion would suffice.
The student body appreciates the j
work of the band and can be relied ;
011 to back up the organization. This,
was shown in one way by the large
number of men that turned out last |
evening and it is hoped that their
ranks will be still further augmented j
by capable musicians who have not
yet tried-out.
