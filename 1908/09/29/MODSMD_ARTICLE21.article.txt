### 
The .Japanese Students' Association,
who have recently moved into new quar
ters at College Terrace, are experiencing
some trouble with their home. They
claim that the specifications are not fill
tilled in many iexpects, and since they
are forced by contract to occupy the
dwelling for two years, they feel that
some injustice has been done them. The
plaster 011 the walls is of such a poor
grade that it is already breaking. In
addition to that it is said that the con
tract calls for a cement basement which
has not yet been built.
The owner has supplied the club with
very good furniture and the members
are now making a tennis court on an ad
joining lot. Other than the defective
workmanship on the house they have
a verv comfortable home.
