# READS ANCIENT RUNES
## PROFESSOR HEMPL CARRIES ON RESEARCH WORK. Discovers Germanic Inscriptions Should Be Translated Into Burgundian. 
### 
Professor George Hempl of the
German department has been con
ducting a course of investigation in
order to discover in what language
the ancient so-called "German"
Runes should be read and the results
of his work have led to the disprov
ing of the venerable theory that the
Runes were in any German tongue
yet known.
The Runes are the first letters
used by early Scandinavians and the
ancient inhabitants of England.
They have been found inscribed on
fibulas, or brooches, which have been
discovered in various parts of Ger
many and in the country to the east.
Hitherto these Runes were taken to
be German, but all efforts to trans
late them into that tongue have tailed.
Professor Hempl tells in an inter
esting manner how he was led to dis
believe that the Runic alphabet be
longed to the German people. Hav
ing this doubt, he worked on the the
ory that the inscribed brooches wer 3
left by northern tribes during their
migrations from the Baltic region to
France. Those fibulas found in Cler
many and elsewhere correspond
with the ones found in Burgundy.
Professor Hempl concluded from this
and contributory evidence that thev
were left in graves by the Burin ra
dians. While they could not be read
into German, they could be trans
lated, according to his theory, into
a language which, while Germanic,
was in many ways unlike any Ger
man language yet known. The only
knowledge, before this, of Burgun
dian speech was from a few proper
names, and these were more or less
changed by Latin, Gothic or German
influences.
Though these inscriptions are
short and of a limited number, they
furnish examples of the Burgund'an
speech and show its relation ship, to
other Germanic languages and also
to the Anglo-Frisian speech
Professor Hempl is giving a coiir.'f
of lectures 011 his tre
class meeting every Friday after
noon.
