# PROF. CHARTERS LECTURES.
## Gives Interesting Talk on "Insulator Tests" Before Electrical Engineering Society. 
### 
A lecture by Professor S. B.
Charters, on "Methods Used in West
inghouse Insulation Tests" was the
feature of yesterday evening's pro
gram at the meeting of the Stanford
branch of the American Institute
o. Electrical Engineers.
The lecturer had several samples
of insulation material at the meeting
which he ined in illustrating the
points o. his exposition. One of the
unique illustrations v\as a new pat
ent. insulator made of enamel in
stead of the customary vegetable
fibre. This is the first time this in
itiation has been shown at Stanford
and it aroused great interest among
the students.
In 1906 Professor Charters con
ducted a series of extensive insula
tion tests for the Westinghouse com
pany and hence his subject was dis
cussed from the practical side and
all the problems arising in the actual
carrying out of such tests were
brought up and clearly explained.
By a vote of the society the con
stitution was amended so as to pro
vide for the holding of the bi-month
ly meetings on Tuesdays instead of
Mondays as heretofore.
The following mon were voted to
membership: W. T. Tyler, 'OS; (). S.
Ambrose, us; and C. S. Bradley, 'us.
