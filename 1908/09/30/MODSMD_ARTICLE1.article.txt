# OPPOSE STUDENT VOTE
## COUNTY OFFICIALS IMPUGN RIGHT TO REGISTER. Definition of Legal Residence Will Probably Determine Ability to Cast Ballot. 
### 
Numbers of students who reg
istered last month in order that (hey
might vote in the coming President
ial election were notified by this
morning's mail that their reg
istration was illegal and unless
they took steps to cancel the same
by October 3, that they would lie
prosecuted under the laws of Cali
fornia for illegal registration.
The difficulty has arisen over the
fact that most of the registrations
were made when the person regis
tering would not have been a resident
of Santa Clara county for the ninety
days required by law as residence
previous to tbe next election.
Tomorrow Charles Detrich of May
field will review the alleged cases of
illegal registration at Marshall
I Hack's office in Palo Alto. A promi
nent man of Palo Alto expressed his
opinion that many of the men noti
fied would be permitted to vote and
that the mistakes which have evi
dently' been made would be rectified.
The whole affair seems to have
arisen from a suspicion that many
of the students who have registered
were not legally entitled to do so. It
was upon this complaint that County
Clerk H. A. Pfister sent up from
San Jose to the University yesterday
afternoon, his deputy, Wm. T. Ag
gler, upon the advice of the District
Attorney.
Aggler went over the lists of the
University Registrar in an en
deavor to learn all he could about
the residence of the students who
had registered as voters. Those who
it was not certain were bona fide res
idents of this community received
notification that they were illegally
registered. It is probable that many
of the students who received this no
tification will lie permitted to vote
because they will be given an oppor
tunity tomorrow morning of proving
their bona fide residence.
As far as can be determined in
Palo Alto about 300 of the University
students have registered as voters.
Only those who registered this fall
are in any way affected by the action
of the County Clerk.
It is rumored that the present situ
ation is merely the result of the com
ing county campaign for the election
of a supervisor, in which a Palo Alto
candidate is running against a Sun
Jose man.
As the election promises to 1 .<â€¢
close, the conclusion is that the San
Jose contingency have resorted to
this means of reducing the probable
vote which will be cast for the Palo
Alto candidate.
\ meeting will be held in room 77.
Encina Hall, this evening of all the
.students who have received notifi
cation that they would not be allowed
to vote in the coming election. The
situation will be discussed with a view
of remedying the apparent injustice
done if) the students who intended
to vote in November. Several men
who can probably throw light on the
situation has signified their intention
of being present.
