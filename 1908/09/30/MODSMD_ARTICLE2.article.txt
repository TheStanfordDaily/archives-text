# PROFESSOR HOWARD AND W. C. SHELTON ADDRESS ASSEMBLY
## President of Y. M. C. A. Outlines Its Policy for This Year at Gathering Held Under Auspices of the Association. 
### 
The second Assembly of the sem
ester was held this morning at 11:15.
The gathering was under the auspi
ces of the Young Men's Christian
Association and speeches were de
livered by Professor Burt Estes How
ard, chairman of the committee on
Public Exercises and \V. C. Shelton,
'08, president of the Y. M. C. A.
Professor Howard made the first
address and chose as his subject
"The Power of Positive Convictions."
His thoughts were well taken and
forcibly delivered. While the topics
discussed by the speaker were in no
manner localized his talk was highly
instructive and interesting.
Shelton confined his speech to a
plea for the "Association.
in a straightforward manner he
placed his subject before the under
graduates and clearly outlined the
new policy which is to govern the
Young Men's Christian Association.
He was well received and his re
marks applauded.
Professor Howard spoke in part
as follows: "The strong man in the
community is the man who does his
own thinking, the man who is master
of his own mind. The constructive
energy of society is the sum of its
positive convictions. Thought is
creative. The world is shaped by
its great ideas and its great ideals.
This iron age of materialism is in
sistent in its demand for what it is
pleased to call facts. Facts are not
the truth. They are only the raw
material out of which truth is made.
Without the philosophy of things,
which takes these facts and moulds
them into forms that can be used,
without a scheme of life that fashions
facts in such wise that human ex
perience can profit by them and grow
saner and wiser by feeding on them,
they lie as they fall —an incoherent
disconnected mass of stuff. The end
of truth is being, and the value con
sists in its grip on human life. The
potent factors of any community,
therefore, are its constructive think
ers, the men who create its ideals
rather than the men who discover its

facts, Great men are the embodi
ment of great ideas. They are the
men who are caught fast in the
clutch of great convictions."
In speaking of the convictions of
heroes he continued: "it is a faith
like this that we need in this flabby
age, an age of many opinions, but
few convictions. it is the kind of
faith that is needed to put red blood
into our languid times and to quick
en the pulse ot a decrepit church."
Shelton spoke in part as follows:
"No organization has the right to
ask for tlie support morally and
financially of the Stanford public
unless it has a justifiable work to do.
The Stanford man is no loafer, but
a busy man. He can not afford to
do with things not worth while.
"That presents the question: Is
the Association worth while. We do
not care to discuss the past. We
today turn our faces to the future.
Then, is the Association of the fu
ture worth while? I believe that it
is. I believe that it has a work to do,
a field to cover. What must, it be
then? it will be a body of men,
strong in body and active in mind,
the real men of Stanford, the varsity
athletes and debaters, the "rough
necks," the Encina men, and the fra
ternity men.
"There is not a college man before
me who does not believe in aiding
the other fellow. This is tbe first
thing the Association does, this is
for what is stands. We desire to
bring all classes together socially, to
get tbe men of the Row, of the Hall,
of Palo Alto and the Terrace better
acquainted. We intend to give a so
cial good time and 'jolly up' in En
cina clubrooni shortly to bring this
about.
"We will strive for high moral
standards through the pursuance of
a broad, liberal policy rather than
a narrow one. Our monthly meetings
will be characterized by a breaking
away from the old standards. Our
programs will .be strong and helpful
such as appeal to the busy, stren
uous. virile men of today."

the other fellow. This is tbe first
thing the Association does, this is
for what is stands. We desire to
bring all classes together socially, to
get tbe men of the Row, of the Hall,
of Palo Alto and the Terrace better
acquainted. We intend to give a so
cial good time and 'jolly up' in En
cina clubrooni shortly to bring this
about.
"We will strive for high moral
standards through the pursuance of
a broad, liberal policy rather than
a narrow one. Our monthly meetings
will be characterized by a breaking
away from the old standards. Our
programs will .be strong and helpful
such as appeal to the busy, stren
uous. virile men of today."
The second Assembly of the sem
ester was held this morning at 11:15.
The gathering was under the auspi
ces of the Young Men's Christian
Association and speeches were de
livered by Professor Burt Estes How
ard, chairman of the committee on
Public Exercises and \V. C. Shelton,
'08, president of the Y. M. C. A.
Professor Howard made the first
address and chose as his subject
"The Power of Positive Convictions."
His thoughts were well taken and
forcibly delivered. While the topics
discussed by the speaker were in no
manner localized his talk was highly
instructive and interesting.
Shelton confined his speech to a
plea for the "Association.
in a straightforward manner he
placed his subject before the under
graduates and clearly outlined the
new policy which is to govern the
Young Men's Christian Association.
He was well received and his re
marks applauded.
Professor Howard spoke in part
as follows: "The strong man in the
community is the man who does his
own thinking, the man who is master
of his own mind. The constructive
energy of society is the sum of its
positive convictions. Thought is
creative. The world is shaped by
its great ideas and its great ideals.
This iron age of materialism is in
sistent in its demand for what it is
pleased to call facts. Facts are not
the truth. They are only the raw
material out of which truth is made.
Without the philosophy of things,
which takes these facts and moulds
them into forms that can be used,
without a scheme of life that fashions
facts in such wise that human ex
perience can profit by them and grow
saner and wiser by feeding on them,
they lie as they fall —an incoherent
disconnected mass of stuff. The end
of truth is being, and the value con
sists in its grip on human life. The
potent factors of any community,
therefore, are its constructive think
ers, the men who create its ideals
rather than the men who discover its

facts, Great men are the embodi
ment of great ideas. They are the
men who are caught fast in the
clutch of great convictions."
In speaking of the convictions of
heroes he continued: "it is a faith
like this that we need in this flabby
age, an age of many opinions, but
few convictions. it is the kind of
faith that is needed to put red blood
into our languid times and to quick
en the pulse ot a decrepit church."
Shelton spoke in part as follows:
"No organization has the right to
ask for tlie support morally and
financially of the Stanford public
unless it has a justifiable work to do.
The Stanford man is no loafer, but
a busy man. He can not afford to
do with things not worth while.
"That presents the question: Is
the Association worth while. We do
not care to discuss the past. We
today turn our faces to the future.
Then, is the Association of the fu
ture worth while? I believe that it
is. I believe that it has a work to do,
a field to cover. What must, it be
then? it will be a body of men,
strong in body and active in mind,
the real men of Stanford, the varsity
athletes and debaters, the "rough
necks," the Encina men, and the fra
ternity men.
"There is not a college man before
me who does not believe in aiding
the other fellow. This is tbe first
thing the Association does, this is
for what is stands. We desire to
bring all classes together socially, to
get tbe men of the Row, of the Hall,
of Palo Alto and the Terrace better
acquainted. We intend to give a so
cial good time and 'jolly up' in En
cina clubrooni shortly to bring this
about.
