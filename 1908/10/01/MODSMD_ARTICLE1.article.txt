# FRESHMAN PROSPECTS
## KEEN RIVALRY FOR POSITIONS ON 1912 FIFTEEN. Erb Brown Alone Practically Assured of Places.â€”Heavy Team a Certainty. 
### 
Hut little more thaii two weeks
remain before the Freshman fifteens
of the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold
will face each other on Stanford
Field for their annual contest. Since
the Class of 1908 were Freshmen
every first-year game has been won
by California, but this year for the
first time since Rugby was inaugu
rated the Stanford team seems to
have practically an even chance for
victory. Just at present the Cardinal
players are experiencing a terrific
slump. This, however, is sure to be
only temporary, and with the mater
ial which is available Coach Presley
will have a fast, and fighting fifteen
chosen by October 17.
The only two Freshmen who are
substantially assured of their posi
tions are half-back Brb and full-back
Brown. Although in the last two
games the latter has not displayed
his early season form, Erb has shown
increased ability each day.
There is an exceedingly close race
for scrum positions. In the front
rank, Crandall, Smith and Corbet are
all keen contenders, while Reynolds,
the fourth candidate, scarcely seems
fitted for that important place. Since
Cilker's ineligibility was discovered,
Schaupp has been playing at lock.
T1 e other four positions have five
strong applicants in Rodgers, Pat't
i'dge, Gilmoro, I iuvibard <i; liaiii
together witu several rpjye ;;i'!-sti
ttit.es whose work is not to be under
rated. Macready is doing saris! ac
torily at wing forward.
In the back-field, T. Sanbor i and
Whitney, the fives, with wing thieo
quarters Kennedy are making effec
tive bids for their respective posi
tions. Of the other candidates, Ever
ett and A. Sanborn seem to be the
most likely, although the latter has
several bad faults which be apparent
ly is unable to completely overcome.
Another possible' choice is Murray.
Whatever the final personnel of the
1912 fifteen it is certain to be one
of the heaviest of Stanford's Fresh
man teams, and this is especially
true regarding the scrum.
