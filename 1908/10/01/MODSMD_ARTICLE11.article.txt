The difficulty of obtaining books at
the desk of the University Library
is a distinct disadvantage to the stu
dents. The cause of dissatisfaction
with the service is that persons wish
ing to draw books have to wait often
a half an hour or more before they
receive the volumes in quest. Some
are discouraged at the number of ap
plicants ahead of thorn, knowing that
they will have to wait long, and
therefore turn away rather than
waste their time in line.
Where the fault lies is a question
for consideration. The regular li
brary staff is efficient, but many of
the persons whose duty it is to dis
pense the references are unfamiliar
with them through lack of experi
ence. That the contrary might be
true can hardly be expected, for it
seems to be the policy of the Univer
sity not to keep a sufficient force of
loan clerks to attend to the rush
business. Students are employed to
do much of this work. Each year
some drop out of the available posi
tions and new assistants must be
trained at the expense of the people
who are continually calling for the
various works that are in irregular
demand. It would cost more to em
ploy clerks who would remain with
the library long enough and put in a
sufficient number of hours each day
to become experts in handling the
volumes, but it would save a large
body of students much time and trou
ble. It is evident that the composi
tion of the force should either be
changed or else au ,merited lor t lie
rush hours.
