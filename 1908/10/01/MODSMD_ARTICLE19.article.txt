# Committee Audits Class Books.
## 
### 
The Committee appointed by Presi
dent H. C. Warren of the Junior
Class to audit the class treasurer's
books met this afternoon and inves
tigated the accounts. The books
were found in perfect order.
The money expended last year by
the class nearly amounted to $500.
$200 of this amount was donated to
the Track Fund that was used by the
athletes who went East last summer
to the conference meet, and to the
new track bleachers. The committee
that audited the books was composed
of F. G. Wilson, It. L. Hughes and
F. L. Stanton. There is still $232.59
in the class treasury.
