# IMPROVING FIRE PROTECTION
## New Auxiliary Mains Being Laid to Quadrangle, Chemistry Building and Museum. 
### 
The prosence 01 open ditches and
cast iron pipes around the quadrangle
is explained by the fact that new
water mains are being laid to the
quadrangle, Chemistry building and
Museum, to. the purpose of estab
lishing a more efficient fire protec
tion than has existed heretofore.
It, was reared that, in case of an
eNten; ive fire, the old pipe line would
not" irnMi a sufiicienl amount of
v iter at hi*.;h pressure. The new
mains are much larger than ihe ones
now in use and can be relied upon
in an emergency. A number of hy
drants- are to he added and they also
will he on a larger scale. The
system is not intended to replace the
old, but will be used only in case of
emergency.
