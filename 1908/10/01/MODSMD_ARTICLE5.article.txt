# RHODES TEST OMITTED
## NO EXAMINATIONS TO BE HELD HERE THIS YEAR. Next Date for Qualification for Entrance to Oxford Is October 1909. 
### 
No examinations for admission to
Oxford under the Rhodes Bequest
will be held this year at Stanford.
The last qualification test was held
in January, 1907, but according to
the will of the trustees of the fund,
examinations are omitted every third
year. It has been decided to hold
the next examinations in October
1909.
The board in charge of this fund
require certain qualifications to be
fulfilled before examinations can be
taken. The candidates must be un
married and citizens of the United
States. All scholars are supposed to
have finished their second or Sopho
more year in some degree-granting
college and must have passed their
nineteenth birthday.
The scholarship is valued at $1,500
per annum and is tenable for three
years, thus making part of the work
at Oxford of an advanced nature.
The last Rhodes scholar from
Stanford was H. A. Moran of the
Class of 1905, who is now attending
the English university. F. P. Grif
fiths of the University of California
was the last scholar from the state.
Details relative to the tests may
be obtained from Professor A. T.
Murray of the Greek department,
who is chairman of the Stanford
committee of selection that acts in
conjunction with that of the Univer
sity of California. President B. I.
Wheeler is the chairman of the com
mittee of selection of the State of
California.
