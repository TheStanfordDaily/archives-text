# ASK FOR AFFILIATION
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TAKES STEPS TO ENTER P.A.A. Membership in Athletic Association Gives Stanford Representative on Governing Board. 
### 
Stanford will immediately apply
for membership in the Pacific Ath
letic Association. This action was
decided on last night at the regular
weekly meeting of the Executive
Committee after hearing the report
of a select committee on the subject
and carefully considering the advis
ability of joining the body which
stands at the head of amateur ath
letics on the Coast.
Not only will Stafford's admission
to the association materially assist
the officers of the latter body
in their efforts to jdace am
ateur sport on a firm, clean basis,
but it will serve also to bring Stan
ford into closer touch with outside
athletic interests.
Membership in the association en
titles the Cardinal to one represen
tative on the governing board who
will be appointed within a short
time. It will not in any way interfere
with intercollegiate contests as they
are now conducted. Now, as for
merly, the intercollegiate agreement
will govern the eligibility of contest
ants as well as the manner of hold
ing the various contests. On the
other hand, Stanford will benefit
from the Association in a general
way.
Little other business of importance
was transacted by the Executive
Committee further than to readopt
last year's official rooters' hat and
to grant the University Choir per
mission to use the old student body
piano that, has been stored in the
back of the Assembly Hall stage for
several years. President A. E. Roth,
'09, of the Associated Students, and
J. E. McDowell, '00, were appointed
an auditing committee to examine
monthly the books of the graduate
manager.
