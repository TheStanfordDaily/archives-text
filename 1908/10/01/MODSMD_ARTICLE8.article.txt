From the results so far obtained
in the analysis of the food supply of
the University Inn by Professor 11.
E. Swain of the Chemistry depart
ment, it would seem that the theory
of the poisoning of the food by a dis
charged cook is exploded. Of the
four articles to be examined —lard,
sugar, flour and baking powder—the
first three have been tested and
found to be pure. Professor Swain
is now engaged in the analysis of the
baking powder which he expects to
have completed by tomorrow.
The articles so far examined have
been put to both chemical and mi
croscopic tests, but 110 foreign sub
stance has been discovered in their
composition. With the analysis of
the baking powder half completed the
indications seem to point to the pur
ity of this staple also.
