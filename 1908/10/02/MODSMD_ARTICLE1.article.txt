# REHEARSING STEADILY
## CAST FOR ENGLISH CLUB PLAY HAS LEARNED TWO ACTS. Rapid Progress Made in Preparation of “Arms and the Man” for October 30. 
### 
Unusually rapid advancement is be
ing made by the cast in the prepar
ation of the play "Arms and the Man"
which is soon to be staged under the
auspices of the English Club. The
entire first and second acts have al
ready been memorized by the players
and are now being rehearsed every
Monday, Thursday and Friday after
.noons from 1:30 to 4 o'clock under
the able guidance of Professor 11. D.
Gray, who expresses his entire satis
faction with the excellent progress
of the cast.
Work will soon be commenced on
the third act of the play, which if
the present showing of the players
may be taken as a criterion, promises
to be one of the greatest histrionic
accesses ever staged before the
Stanford public. The committee also
is getting tip designs for the pro
gram cover and the art posters, which
from present indications will excell
any used for a simular purpose be
fore in Stanford dramatics.
Professor Gray expressed himself
this afternoon as more than satisfied
with the prospects of the coming
performance. He said:
"My chief regret is that the play
does not have parts for more of those
who tried out. There is a surprising
amount of excellent material here to
draw front. Tn some cases the choice
was an extremely difficult one to
make. But with the cast that we
now have we ought to give a splendid
performance. There are a number
who have had professional experi
ence and all have shown unusual ap
titude.
"The play itself is one of breath
less interest, full of the most delight
ful surprises, it is perhaps the best
play that Bernard Shaw ever wrote,
and certainly his most significant
one. As Shaw is beyond question
the most vital as well as the most
brilliant of living English or Ameri
can dramatists, this means that
'Arms and the Man' is as important
and as interesting a play as could
very well be chosen. 1 am confident
that the English Club is going to give
the University public a thoroughly
good performance.
"We have put the date early sc
that it will not interfere with thp
Sword and Sandals play, which I
understand is not to lie given until
December.
"1 shall miss greatly the splendid
assistance of Mr. Cross, who did so
much to make 'You Never Can Tell'
what it was. Though I have not yet
had an opportunity to see him, I
know lit 1 will not refuse to come in
to some of the rehearsals and give
me his keen and stimulating sug
gestions."
