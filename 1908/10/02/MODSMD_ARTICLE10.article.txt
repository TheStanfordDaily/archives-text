A communication appearing in an
other column raises some questions
regarding the coming "show" to lie
given by the Junior Class.

crackers thrown to explode among |
a crowd of people, but we do believe j
that any restriction oil legitimate ex

is contrary to the spirit of the Plug j
Ugly. Such expressions need not be I

danger ot this if the show is held !
