The fact that you have recently
devoted editorial space to a discuss
ion of the Plug Ugly will perhaps
justify some further comment on tlie
same subject.
That the Junior Plug Ugly has
greatly deteriorated during the last
few years will not, I think, be de
s hoxe who have kept in

in 1907?
You say that "good compensation
awaits the successful competitors."
Concerning the munificence of $25.
as a reward for some weeks of diffi
cult work there may be some differ
ence of opinion, but in any case, an
author's chief reward is the applause
of his readers or hearers, and of this
reward lie is certainly deprived as
long as present conditions continue.
The remedy for all this lies with
the Seniors. Let an agreement lie
reached that "joshing" and applause
will be kept within reasonable limits,
and the Juniors should certainly be
i-*atiy to offer some entertainment
more nearly worthy the attention of
the public than has formerly been the
case. Few men care to stand their
work up in order to have it knocked
down, and Plug Ugly authors are no
exception to the rule.
