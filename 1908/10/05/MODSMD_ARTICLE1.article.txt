# VARSITY WINS AGAIN
## BARBARIAN FIFTEEN SUFFERS ANOTHER DEFEAT. 24 to 0 Score Gives Cardinal a Decisive Victory.—Freshnen Best Santa Clara. 
### 
On Saturday tlie varsity fifteen re
pealed its performance of two weeks
before by again easily defeating the
Barbarians, and iliit; time the final
score stood 24 to 0. As in llie iirsi
game the vast majority oi the tallies
were registered in the .final half,
when the Stanford team's superior
condition commenced to assert itself.
The Cardinal forwards were largely
responsible for the decisive victory,
as they completely overran the oppos
ing pack, especially in the second
half. The excellency of the Barbar
ian hookers led Captain Elliott to
call for a scrum instead of a line-out.
whenever he had the option, but the
formidable strength of the Cardinal
pack, as a whole, quickly offset any
advantage which the visitors hoped
to gain from the particular effective
ness of one or two individuals. The
Stanford backs played well, but their
work was only mediocre when com
pared to the wonderful ability dis
played on previous occasions.
The backs succeeded in gaining the
first try, when Scott crossed the line
towards the middle of the opening
half, Miller converting. The next
score came during the first ten min
utes of the second period. Terrill
secured the ball as it came out of a
ruck and covered the twenty yards
to the line. Crawford missed the
goal. In a phenomenal dash through
the ranks of the Barbarian pack Erb
registered ihe next three points of
the match, and for the second time
Miller was successful in converting.
The fourth try was easily the most
spectacular of the afternoon. On the
Barbarian's 40 yard line 1 leiu 1 y began
a dribbling rush, and skillfully eluded
the opposing three-quarters and full,
he took the pigskin to the 10 yard line,
where lie scooped it up and passed to
lUiller just before being caught by
a speedy Barbarian. Miller scored
and converted. Later a forward rush
brought the ball to within striking
distance and Reynolds carried it over
Captain Crawford kicked an extreme
ly difficult goal. The final tally was
made by McKenzie, who had replaced
Heinly at wing forward, and the score
stood 24 to 0.
Besides Heinly's dribbling rush
down the field. the,continual aggress
iveness of Captain Crawford, espec
ially in the line-outs, was a feature
of the contest. Lafferty, the referee
was thoroughly satisfactory. The

Freshmen. 14: Santa Clara College. 0,
The Freshmen exhibited a complete
reversal of form on Saturday, fighting

;every minute of the game and playing |
in a consistent manner throughout. I
j Although all of their 14 points were
! tallied in the first half, this was due
more to the determined stand 011 the
I part of Santa Clara in the second!
j period than to any fault of the 1912
' team.
The forwards followed the hall bet
ter than at anv previous time, and the
i backs, although still rather weak on j
the offensive, put up a strong defen
sive game. The visitors knew little
or nothing of the rules of Rugby, and
consequently the contest was marred
to some extent by the frequent, pen
alties which had to be enforced.
Rogers, the forward, was the indi
vidual star of the match, and <i of the
14 points were due directly to him.
Once from the 2."> yard line and again
from the 35 yard line he sent the ball
squarely between the goal posts on
penalty kicks.
