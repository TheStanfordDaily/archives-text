The Rugby squad was augmented
this afternoon by the addition to its
numbers 01 T. R. Cadwalader, 09,
who played full-back on the 1907
fifteen. This is Cadwalader's first
appearance on the field this season,
and his cleverness, speed and relia
bility. together with his splendid skill
in kicking, should make his services
invaluable to the present varsity.
