## CHAPLAIN GARDNER PREACHES ON TIMELY SUBJECT. Gives Interesting Discourse on "The Relation of Religion to Polities." 
### 
Pursuant to a special request, the
Rev. I). Charles Gardner delivered a
very interesting and forcible sermon
yesterday morning in the University
Chapel on "The Relation of Religion
to Politics." The preacher began his
discourse by showing how politics
was originally wedded, a it were, to
religion, but at the entrance oi vice
and corruption into politics the two
were divorced. Party spirit was unit
ed with the latter and now when re
ligion attempts to interfere with poli
tics, party spirit cries: "Hands off!"
lie declared that politics in the
truest sense of the word was higher
than an individual or party and that
it was a science of government in
cluding both ethics and religion. Rev.
Gardner went on to state that a good
and trustworthy political machinery
was just as essential to a government
as a thorough academic training was
to a university course.
In dealing with the influence of re
ligion over politics the speaker
showed how our constitution had
been founded upon religious prin
ciples and how it was an appeal to
every man to do his own part in the
government of his nation and state.
At this time he lamented the pessi
mism on the part of so many edu
cated men towards politics and at
tributed it to indifference and lazi
ness on their part. Furthermore,
he brought out the fact that religion
fostered and emphasized certain im
portant duties to the government,
such as a strict obedience to its laws,
a willing financial support of its in
stitutions, and positive convictions in
the election of men to office.
In concluding, Dr. Gardner said
that the West of the future would be
largely what the university men and
women make it and made a strong
plea for Stanford men going out into
the world to enter politics, not as
mere politicians, but as statesmen
with a desire to uphold a high and
noble standard of government.
After the sermon, the celebration
of the Lord's Supper was held.
