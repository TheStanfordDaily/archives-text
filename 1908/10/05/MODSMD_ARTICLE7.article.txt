# MANIAC ATTACKS GIRLS
## PICNIC PARTY BROKEN UP BY SUPPOSED WILD MAN. Women Students at a Loss to Account for Stranger's Bellicose Demeanor Last Friday Evening. 
### 
A party of 20 women picknickers
members of Manteista 'audtheir guests
according to Mrs. L. Hanktree of
Roble Hall, were attacked Friday
evening by a man supposedly insane
while eating ilieir supper in the bed
of San Fraucisquito creek, a short
distance south oi the Roble foot
bridge. The first intimation the party
had of ihe stranger's presence oc
curred when a club came crashing
down through the underbrush into
their midst. Fortunately no one was
injured by the missile though it fell
on the cloth upon which the young
ladies had placed their repast and
about which they were all sitting.
Startled by the intrusion the girls
sprang to their feet, only to be as
sailed by huge clods.
Three of the young women slipped
away unnoticed and hastily retreated
toward the University through the
dusk, looking for some one to come
to their assistance. They stopped at
Dr. Jordan's residence, where they
communicated the plight of the party
to the power station. The men at the
power station misunderstood their
directions and instead of hurrying to
Roble bridge, went to Roble Hall. As
no one there knew of the predicament,
of the picknickers, the men thought
themselves the victims of some prac
tical joke and returned to their duty
at the power house.
In the meantime the miscreant
further annoyed those of the party
who had not returned to the campus
by setting fire to the underbrush near
them. The young women, knowing
the danger of a tire being allowed to
gain headway in the thick under
brush along the creek, immediately
set. to work to put out the fire. This
they did by throwing dirt on the
flames. Following this first dastardly
effort, to fire the underbrush, the in
terloper made two more attempts,
each time being balked by the young
women.
As the whole affair occurred after
dusk no accurate description of the
man was secured. He at no time
came near enough to the party for
the young women to distinguish any
features beyond the fact that he was
tall, middleaged and wore a gray cap.
The girls are at a loss to account for
the attack upon them, but suppose
their assailant was insane.
-Mrs. L. Lanktree the matron of
Roble. stated this afternoon that a
number of men from the power sta
tion had run down to Roble upon the
receipt of an urgent telephone mes
sage asking that help be immediat
ely sent to Roble as there was an im
perative need of assistance. Won
dering at the presence of the men
Friday evening, she later ascertained
that the unfortunate young ladies
were members of Manteista.
