Stanford's Freshmen evinced a de
cided change of form last Saturday
afternoon when they defeated the
Santa Clara College fifteen. The
showing of the Freshmen was decid
edly encouraging after the "slump"
that lately lias been experienced.
Now that, less than two weeks remain
before the first-year intercollegiate
struggle, every Freshman candidate
must realize that he must give his ut
most headwork and strength to the
development of the team if Stanford
is to win. Lie should remember that
it has been three years since a Stan
ford Freshman team have defeated
their rivals from the state university;
he should remember that this year's
squad affords far greater possibilities
than did last year's to turn out a win
ning fifteen, but that the magnificent
spirit of last year's Freshmen must
be duplicated. The coaches are doing
all in their power to develop a win
ning team without neglecting the
Varsity, and will continue to do so
constantly, so that the result of this
season's contest lies with the players.
They must keep up the good work of
Saturday if they hope to serpentine
on Stanford Held.
