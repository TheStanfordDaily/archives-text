# AFTER CITY THEATER
## MANAGER STEWART NEGOTIATING FOR ACCOMODATIONS. Annual Football Theatrical Will Be at Some San Francisco Playhouse. 
### 
The annual footfall show will be
held in San Francisco this year. This
has 1 een decided and \lanaser E.
Stewart has been engaged in negotia
tions with several theatrical manag
ers in San Francisco during the past
few days. Two theaters are under
consideration. At one, it is said, an
excellent Eastern company will put
o:i a light musical comedy and seat:-
can be obtained in a block at ihe reg
ular prices. While ihe other house
is perhaps more conveniently located
tbe management will not turn over
ie box office to the rooters for the
evening.
It was always the custom of the
rooters to hold forth, in times when
the games were played in San Fran
el: co. at a certain San Francisco
playhouse and hotel. This year will
probably come closer to the resump
tion oi ibis practice than the past
three years. Two football shows have
been given on the campus and in 1 !>Ot;
the Stanford contingent went to an
Oakland theater, but on account of
the unsatisfactoriness of this depar
ture. Stewart is after a theater in
Sail Francisco.
