# MAY TAKE LAW WORK
## STUDENTS NOT AFFECTED BY FARADE FENALTIES. New University Directory, Issued This Morning, Has Paraders' Hours Dedacted. 
### 
In the new Directory of officers and
stuile.iui which was put on sale this
morning, the number of hours which
students were penalized last spring
lias ! een deduc.e I lrom the number
of credits such students have made
In the University. This was done for
Ihe purpose of convenience in print
in.. . as lack of space would not per
mit of any other manner of indicat
ing the penalty.
This method of reckoning the stand
ing of the students raised the ques
tion with students of tlie Law depart
ment as to whether they would there
by be prevented from registering for
Law courses. The department has
made tlie ruling that the penalties
inflicted upon those students who
participated in the parade of March
12, 1908, will not prevent them from
taking the professional courses.
The doubt in the minds of the stu
dents arose from the fact that the
Law department requires students to
have 30 hours of University credit
before they are allowed to register
for courses in Law. If the number of
hours for which they were penalized
were deducted from their standing in
the consideration of the Law faculty
regarding the requirements for pro
fessional courses, many students in
the department would not have the
required r»0 onits.
The ruling is in accordance with
he report of the Committee on Stu
dent Affairs published March 2."tin
regard to the paraders, which in part
follows:
"All students, excepting first year
students, in the second group have
had live unit hours added to the re
quirements for graduation. t
"In regard to the third group, those
who have been considered by the
conimiitee as upperclassmen—to the
number of 11—are suspended for the
j rest of the semester. Second year
students have had ten unit hours ad
ded io the requirements; for gradu
ation. First year students have had
live unit hours added to the require
| :nents for graduation."
It is evident from the above that
as far as lite penalty affects Law
I work, it may be said that the
hours are added to the require-
I ments for graduation and are not sub
tracted from the credits that a stu
i dent has made while in college, as
| would appear from the new direc
tory. Therefore, all students who
; have made the required number of
units will lie allowed to register for
Law courses regardless of any penal
! ties they may have incurred.
