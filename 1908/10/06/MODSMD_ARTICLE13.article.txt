Up to and including the year 1904.
a special train was run on the campus
for the accomodation of the people
going to San Francisco on the day of
the varsity intercollegiate football
game against the University of Cal
ifornia. Previous to 1904 the games
were played in San Francisco; in
that year the lirst campus game was
played, at Merkeley; the following
year Stanford Field was christened.
'Clle only occasion for a special from
the campus on the day ol' a big game
when there has not been such a train
was in 190(5, when Rugby was played
at Berkeley. The omission of the
train is easily explanable by the fact
that the University spur track from
Maylield was iu a weak condition af
ter the disaster of April of that year.
At present, however, the track is in
excellent shape, having been rerailed
and reballasted. Long, heavy trains
are now pulled over the route by the
most powerful locomotives. The ad
vantages to the University community
of having such a train on November
14 are manifest, and we hope that the
necessary steps will be taken so that
these advantages will lie realized.
