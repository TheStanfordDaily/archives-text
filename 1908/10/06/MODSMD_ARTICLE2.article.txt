# TRAINING TABLE FOR 1912.
## Principal Freshman Candidates Will Eat in Palo Alto During Week Before Game. 
### 
Coach Presley lias decided to in
augurate a training table for those
freshmen who are most likely to con
si ituio the fifteen and substitutes in
the contest with the Blue and Gold
on October 17. Consequently, front
li.een to twenty men will be chosen
at the end of the present week, and
beginning at noon next Sunday these
Candida es will eat two meals a day
lunch and dinner, at a Palo Alto
restaurant.
Tlie graduate manager will, as us
ual, provide a conveyance for '.hen
to a id from the Campus. Naturally,
a training table for only one week is
not expected to accomplish very
much in conditioning the men, bui
it cannot fail to get the members oi
the team better acquainted with one
another, and this alone is importan:
in the molding of a successful Rir;' \
fifteen.
