According to a Frankfort. Kentucky
despatch published in ;i newspaper of
Washington, I). C., a Stanford woina.i,
student recently wrote a letter to a
Mr. Wilson, Slate University, Lexing
ton, Kentucky. There being no stu
dent in the University registered un
der that name, some of the friends of
Governor Wilson of Kentucky seat
him the missive. An extract from the
dispatch follows:
"The letter was from a girl student
at Leland Stanford University, who
wanted to correspond with Wilson.
She said she achieved numerous col
lege honors at Stanford and had
bought a copy of Spaulding's manual
of sports with a picture in it of the
football team at the State University.
Wilson was a member of the team
and the girl liked his looks, so she
wrote to him and suggested that thev
correspond. She said she would have
sent a picture, but she had none small
enough to go in a letter. The young
woman was rather doubtful about
how her letter would be received and
she suggested to Wilson that if he
did not want to write to her he migh
i refer the letter to some other man
who would write to her. She said sh<'
expected to go to <>r Smith's
i College next year and would come
through Kentucky with a 'bunch' from
the coast, all of whom would stop
over in Kentucky on their way East,
i 'We are a lively bunch, the letter
said."
