# AUSTRALIANS TO PLAY
## RUGBY GAMES ARE PROMISED FOR FIRST OF YEAR. Vanconver Men Expect to Send South a Much Stronger Team This Season Than Before. 
### 
William Unmack, the Rugby expert
for the San Francisco Call, is author
ity for the statement that the Austral
ian team will not play here this year
as Stanford has not been affiliated
with the British Krgby Union. R.
Woodward of Vancouver has been
trying very hard tr have the team
come to San Francisco but the best
he could do was to get the managers
promise that the team would play in
San Francisco in January or Febru
ary, For this purpc se the team will
co ne direct from New York.
"oncer ling the corning visit of the
Canadians in order to play Stanford,
the union in Vancouver is going to
profit by past experience and send a
much stronger team 1 nan in previous
years. They intend to combine with
Victoria and Nanaimo Rugby unions,
and the teams will thus be thoroughly
representative of British Columbia
rather than a combined Vancouver
team such as has visited here before.
With this combination an extra strong
team will be putin the field.
The Canadians have received an in
vitation from ihe Australian Rugby
unions to send a team to Australia
next year under the jurisdiction of
the Vancouver union. It is doubtful
whether a Canadian team strong
enough could be got together to make
the trip, and if not it is possible a
combined American and Canadian
team might lie sent, in such a case
teams, universities and colleges be
longing to the local Rugby union will
be drawn from and a splendid team
could be selected.
