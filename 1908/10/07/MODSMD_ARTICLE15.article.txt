# Sophomore Play Committee
## 
### 
Mest efforts are being put forth to
secure the finest, possible coach for
the Sophomore plav. .At present the
committee is corresponding with
eral prominent theat/ical men, and is
receiving good advicÂ». and the names
of coaches. Most likely the coach
will not be a Stanford man.
The committee is absorbed in read
ing plays and discussing their possi
bilities. The play will not be chosen
before a coach is scoured. No dato
for the staging of the comedy has
been decided, but it is certain that tlvj
play will not be put on until next
semester.
