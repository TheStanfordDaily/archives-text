Ii is customary to juive up an entire
day to an intercollegiate athletic con
test â€”that is, it is exceptional when
mure such events than one fall upon
the same day. Within less than two
weeks we shall havt such an excep
tion, for ou the morning of October
17, the Barbarian fifteen will play the
Varsity and on the afternoon of the
same day will come the intercolP gi.ne
Freshman Rugby coi lest.
It, is the opinion ol the yell leadcis
that two contests in a day have a bad
effect on rooting. They claim that a
man has a certain capacity for root
ing, which is exhausted befote two
games are played. Vie can yell one
game and poorly the other, <r else
he can yell unsatisfactorily during
both.
It is manifest that the rooting for
the Freshman game must not suffer
from any avoidable cause. It seems,
too, that the students are under no
obligation lo yell at the Barbarian
game in question. Therefore if the
yell leaders think best, there should
be no complaint if tl.e rooting is dis
pensed with in the morning game for
the sake of the support that Is to be
given to the Freshmen. But he root
ers should all be present :it both
games if ii is possible for thmi so 10
do.
