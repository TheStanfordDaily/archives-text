## MISS ROSE STRUNSKY TELLS OF FOREIGN EXPERIENCE. Former Stanford Student Describes Life of Prison Inmates in an Interesting Manner. 
### 
In the last number of the New York
Independent .Miss Hose Strunsky, ex
'o6, gives a very vivid and interesting
account of her experiences in a Rus
sian prison. .Miss Strunsky and her
sister, who was a member ol' the class
of 1904, are identified with the Social
ist movement. Miss Rose Strunsky
has spent the past two years study
ing the social conditions in Russia
and necessarily led a rather nomadic
life. While going to catch a train
in Sr. Petersburg last October she
was to her intense surprise arrested.
She says the officer declared she was
not arrested but merely held under
suspicion' After having her suit
case and person thoroughly searched,
the officer in charge decided that she
should be sent to prison pending fur
ther investigation.
.Miss Strunsky describes the lii'e of
the inmates in a very interesting
manner, how they follow special
courses of study and certain pres
cribed labor. The writer likens Rus
sia to "Alice in the Looking Glass",
for she says:"The prisons were the
Universities and i lie constitution is
kept under lock and key." The for
mer Stanford student declares that
the conditions in the prisons are de
plorable and should be the object of
speedy reform.
After some very unpleasant experi
ences .Miss Strunsky secured her re
lease and accounts for her mishap by
stating that from the Russians' view
point. if you are arrested you are
guilty and if you are not it is none of
their business to say so.
