# DISFAVORS REDUCTION
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VETOES CHANGE IN ENTRANCE PRICE. Existing Admission Charge to Rugby Games Warranted by Heavy Expense of Season. 
### 
At its meeting last evening the Ex
ecutive Committee considered the ad
visability of reducing the admission
charges to the football games from
fifty to twenty-five cents. There has
been a growing complaint of late
against what is thought by many stu
dents to be an excessive entrance
price and the committee desired to
find out whether there were any real
grounds for ihe dissatisfaction. It
was decided to continue to charge
ihe present fee in view of the great
expense the Associated Students ar>>
under in bringing Ihe numerous out
side teams to the Campus.
Instead of one game at a time, as
was formerly the case, the graduate
manager has provided two games on
every occasion so far this season and
the Executive Committee considers
the present admission price to be
warranted by the heavy cost of bring
ing two teams to the Campus.
Moreover, the games with Vancouv
er, Nevada and other distant fifteens
are scheduled to begin shortly. In or
der to even partially clear the ex
pense of bringing them here the ad
mission charge must remain at fifty
cents.
Manager Stewart is negotiating
with several San Francisco theaters
with a view to obtaining one of them
the night of the Varsity game but
no definite agreement has been made.
The Executive Committee was in
formed that at least one Palo Alto
store lias already ordered a consign
ment of the official rooters hats.
These are due to arvive in the near
future.
