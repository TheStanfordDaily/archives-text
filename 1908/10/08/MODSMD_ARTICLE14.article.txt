# Roble Club to Give Dinner.
## 
### 
Roble Club will entertain the mem
bers of the faculty of the English
department at dinner this evening.
This is the beginning of a series of
informal dinners to be given by the
young women to their major profes
sors.
it was formerly the custom to give
a dinner to the entire faculty each
semester, but it was thought that by
a number of informal dinners the
women would have a better opportun
ity to become acquainted with their
professors.
