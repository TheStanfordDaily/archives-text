As yelling for two games does not
get the best results from tha rooters,
so the singing of 'Hail, Stanford,
Hail!" after every game tends, to
look a- fact in the to become te
dious. Formerly it was customary
to sing the University hymn nnuh less
frequently than at present. After
Assemblies and after intercollegiate
contests are two good occasions for
singing the anthem. But it. apivuirsi
to lie true that giving it so nuinv times
as it has been sung this year tends to
make ii commonplace, and it is a
matter to be regretted that the ;dng
ing appears to have been overd-' le.
On the other hand, however, there
has been one good reason for singing
the hymn so often. This is that the
rooters —and especially the Freshmen
—naturally need a certain amount of
practice on this song. The hymn, if
sung at all at the big contest must be
well sung. It is only with practice
that the singing of the anthem can
be brought to the proper level of ef
fectiveness. The yell leaders wish
io have "Hail, Stanford, Hail!" rend
ered flawlessly on the day of the
Freshman game, and this desire is
undoubtedly the reason why the
hymn has been given after every
game.
When the rooters at large have had
enough of lliis practice can not be tie-]
termined before I lie Freshman game. I
l)iit it, is certainly to be hoped that ;
the singing on that day will demon-i
strate that further rehearsing is mi-1
necessary. Then the Stanford hymn |
ran take its place again as an anthem
to be sung only when an occasion
more important than the average
arises.
