# TO ENLARGE SOCIETY
## GYMNASIUM CLUB DECIDES TO REORGANIZE. Members Will Broaden Its Scope to Take in Boxing, Fencing and Wrestling. 
### 
The Gymnasium Club will reorga
nize. This action is the result of a
motion passed in a meeting of that
organization last evening. The mem
bers of the club have come to the con
clusion that the field covered by their
work was not large enough and that,
a broader scope of activity should be
involved.
This action will necessarily demand
a reorganization of the athletic society,
The club members now desire to ex
pand the field of athletic work that
they are interested in, and include
boxing, wrestling, and fencing. It is
also admitted by the members that
ihe club should have more men and
should take up such work that will
make it possible to take in able men
who are interested in these ihree
sports.
Although this action of the club will
sound the death knell of the Wrestl
ing Club that was organized last year,
the Gymnasium club will probably be
more able to increase the interest in
this sport than the former society,
which so l'ar this semester has failed
to meet. To carry out this idea a
committee of five ws.3 appointed last
evening. The committee consists of
C. T. Whetmore, '10, H. R. Oilman,
'08, E. G. McCann, '10, and A. F. Mes
ton, '10. chairman, and Instructor R.
R. Long, ex-ofhcio.
The committee will at once investi
gate the late action and will prepare
a new constitution. When the reor
ganized club is a fact, the club mem
bers will be divided into divisions that
will deal only with special work.
There will be a Gymnasium division,
that will include only men who work
on the gymnasium apparatus, and the
fencing, boxing and wrestling sec
tions will include the individuals who
are interested in (hose specialties.
The club last night elected seven
new members. They follow :F. H.
Hilton, '11, J. W. Howell. '12, G. S.
Holman, '12, R. B. Carter, '12, J. B.
Beman, '12, J. A. Macready, '12, and
