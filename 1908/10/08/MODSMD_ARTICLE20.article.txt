# History Professors to Dine Together.
## 
### 
By way of a discussion of matters
of mutual and general interest in
historical work, the faculty of the
History departments of Stanford and
the University of California will dine
together at the University Club, San
Francisco, Saturday evening.
This joint meeting is an annual
event, but owing to the acquisition of
several new professors in both de
partments since 1907, this year's
dinner will be especially helpful in
better acquainting the professors of
the two institutions.
