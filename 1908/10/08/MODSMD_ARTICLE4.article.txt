### 
Encina Club will, on the evening
of October 16 and all day on October
17, act as hosts to the Columbia Park
Hoy's Club of San Francisco. It was
for the consideration of this plan o!
entertainment that President C. H.
Wondries, 'OS, of Encina Club called
a meeting last evening. Together
with Rev. D. Charles Gardner he ad
dressed the men on this subject.
Rev. Gardner of the poor
support which was given to the boys
at their last, appearance here and
urged that, the men show their ap
preciation of the work which Sidney
l'\ Pexiotto, organizer of this well
known juvenile club, is doing along
social service lines, by having the
boys give their entertainment in the
Assembly Hall under the auspices of
Encina Club. He further urged that
the students take advantage of the
occasion to give the youths an en
joyable outing the following day by
taking them to the Freshman inter
collegiate Rugby game.
The Chaplain's suggestions were re
ceived with enthusiasm and adopted
by a unanimous vote. The plans for
the entertainment were not decided
upon other than the time of its hold
ing, but were left to a committee to
be appointed by President Wondries.
