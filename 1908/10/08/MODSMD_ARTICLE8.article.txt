# NEW SONGS ARE GOOD
## SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE HELD AT STANFORD FIELD. Light Work for Rugby Squad Yesterday.â€”Ganong and Erb Among Those on Injured List. 
### 
The first practice of the new foot
ball songs which were recently se- i
lected by a committee chosen lor the
purpose was held on the bleachers of
Stanford Field yesterday afternoon. |
The Glee Club was present and assist-1
ed the rooters in gaining an idea ofj
the time and melod.v of the different i
ttines submitted. The four new songs
to he used this year are "Berkeley's!
Tombstone," t lie "Rah-Rah Song,";
"Cheer the Team," and "Berkeley,
You're Licked." All of these, and es
pecially the first two named, went ex
ceptionally well on the bleachers j
Wednesday. They will he tried again
at the V. M. C\ A. smoker in Encina!
Hall tomorrow night.
Rugby practice yesterday was of a I
very light order, as two line-ups oc-j
curred the day before, and some more
scrums also took place today.
At present there is the usual exten-1
sive list of injured men, among whom
are now included Ganong and Erb.
Ganong has a bad ankle which has j
incapacitated him for any rough work 1
since the end of the week. Erb has a !
slight touch of blood poisoning in his j
elbow which will probably keep him
off the field until next Monday. Fur
thermore, Higley has bruised his leg
in such a way that he is unable to
take part in any line-ups.
As for the 1912 candidates, Part
ridge, who until Saturday had been
playing a side rank position, is still
suffering from the dislocation to his
arm which he incurred in the game
with Santa Clara. H is improbable
that he will be in condition again
during the present Freshman season.
