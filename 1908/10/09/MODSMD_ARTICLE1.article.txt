# COTILLION IS CERTAIN
## SOPHOMORE DANCE IN ENCINA ON DECEMBER 4. Committee Requests That Programs Be Not Filled Out Until Tickets Are on Sale. 
### 
In two meetings of the Sophomore
cotillion committee plans have been
laid and have already been realized
far enough to assure a successful
underclass festivity. The date of Fri
day, December 4, which was offered
by Encina club has been accepted
by the committee and approved by
the Student Affairs Committee. The
tickets will go on sale November 4,
to the Sophomores and a week later
to other classes. The number will
be limited to 125. While the price of
admission has not been definitely de
cided. it will probably be the same as
last year, two and a half dollars a
couple. It is desired by the Student
Affairs Committee that the affair he
made less elaborate than the Junior
and Senior dances. For this reason
carriages and llowers will be tabooed.
Among the cotillion committee's
plans are the abolishing of rehear
sals except for a few chosen leaders
who will meet a few evenings prior
to the dance. The number of figures
will be reduced and those will be
made a little simpler than last year's.
A feature of the dance may be a mili
tary band, which the committee hopes
to secure.
So far the initial signal of the
dance has been the appointment of
the committee. When interviewed
today, chairman R. B. Wheeler made
a request in behalf of the committee,
that "Persons who intend to purchase
tickets kindly refrain from making
ont programs until tickets are on
sale." The reason is that the dance
is some time off and if some fill out
their programs now, other persons
who later decide to attend will be
in an unequal position with the earl
ier ones, and thereby many will be
at a disadvantage.
