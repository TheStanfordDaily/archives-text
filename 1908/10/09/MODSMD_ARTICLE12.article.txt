# BOTH TEAMS TO PLAY
## VARSITY WILL MEET OLYMPIC TEAM TOMORROW. Freshman Fifteen Matched Against University of Pacific in Last Preliminary Contest. 
### 
lu pursuance of tbe policy estab
lished thus far this season two Rugby
games are down on the schedule for
decision on Stanford Field tomorrow
afternoon. At 2:30, the University
of the Pacific fifteen will line up
against the Freshmen, while at the
conclusion ol this match the Varsity
aud the Olympics, Douglas Erskine's
team from San Francisco, will face
each other for the second time this
fall. The personnel of the Varsity
and Olympic team will be nearly the
same as when they x ast met and the
Cardinal triumphed 2$ to 0. Little can
be prophesied regtrding the 1912
contest. It is known, however, that
the University of the Pacific fifteen
compares favorably with any of the
Freshmen's previous opponents.
Several noticeable changes in the
Varsity back-field have been made
for tomorrow's game. Elliott is put
in at half in place of Erb, who is still
suffering from the affected arm which
has kept him out of the game for
several days past. Brown's injuries
will also prevent him from playing
tomorrow. His position at full will
be taken by Jordan, while Cadwal
lader goes in as a wing in Cook's
place. On the Freshman fifteen, Dor
an will play side rank in place of
Partridge, who is out of the game
from an injury to his arm received in
the match last Saturday. Kiug, who
has been playing substitute at the
five position has been shifted to rear
rank where he fills the place vacated
by Doran. Sundell has also been
shifted from substitute wing to full
back.
Several former Stanford players are
included in the probable Olympic Club
line-up and it is believed the fifteen
is somewhat stronger than when it
last met the Stanford fifteen. It is
reported that A. A.M'ulfino, ex-'O7, will
be among the forwards of the visiting
team, where Minturn and Thorpe are
also listed. In the back-field, S. M.
Vail, e.v-'O7, A. J. Chalmers, ex-'O7, and
J. R. Hickey, ex-'OB, will appear in
Olympic Club uniforms.
The line-ups of the visiting teams
have not yet been definitely decided,
but the personnel of the Cardinal fif
teens will be as follows:
Varsity—Koerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Pemberton, Crawford, Miller, Rey
nolds, forwards; Heinly, wing
forward; Elliott, half; Mitchell. Ca
nong, fives; Scott, center; Hoi man,
Cadwalader, Cook, wings; Jordan,
