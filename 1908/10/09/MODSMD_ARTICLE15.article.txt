tion tomorrow will help the progress
of the new songs. These should be
sufficiently well known to the mass of

are to be tried, and the attendance
will count either fox or against the
yelling and singing. It is every stu
dent's concern that the practice is
not marred by the presence of only a
small number of rooters.
