# STANFORD MAY ROW IN SOUTH.
## Boat Club Considering Advisability of Filtering a Crew in San Pedro Regatta. 
### 
Stanford will be represented at the
regatta to he held at San Pedro on
Thanksgiving Day, if suitable ar
rangements can he made. The Boat
Cluh is considering the advisability
of a four-oared crew being entered
from the University.
Much enthusiasm is being shown
by Southern boat clubs, in anticipa
tion of the regatta. The San Diego
Rowing Club is particularly active
in organizing and financing the event.
A dance and vaudeville show will be
given by the San Diego oarsmen the
last of this month, the proceeds to
defray tlie expense of advertising the
regatta. This advertising will be
very extensile as- the San Diego, Los
Angeles, and San Pedro Boat Clubs
will enter. It is not improbable that
the University of California will send
down a, crew.
