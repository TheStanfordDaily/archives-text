# 1909 CONSIDER CIRCUS
## VOTE IS TAKEN BY SENIORS TO ABOLISH CARNIVAL. Small Number Present at Meeting and Movement Is Started to Reconsider Decision. 
### 
The Senior Class met this after
noon for the purpose of discussing
the feasibility of giving a circus. P.
R. Johnson, as chairman of the com
mittee appointed last meeting to look
into the matter, reported at some
length. The substance of his report
went to show that any affair of the
nature of the 1908 circus would only
meet with failure as the public had
become accustomed to the stuqts, and
the novelty which made the 1907 cir
cus a success could not be apprpached
by the past methods. With this opin
ion the few Seniors present deeded
that it would be best to allow the cjr
9us to die a natural death.
The question, however, will prob
ably not be allowed to rest with the
decision today as a movement is on
foot among a number of the men of
the class to reconsider the vote. Just
what kind of a festival would be best
is undecided, but some plan will pro
bably be advanced which will offer
some sort of an entertainment and
will be followed by the customary
carnival.
