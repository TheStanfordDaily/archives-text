# PLAYHOUSE IS SECURED
## MANAGER STEWART OBTAINS AMERICAN THEATRE. "Land of Nod" Will Be Produced for Annual Football Show in San Francisco. 
### 
The annual football show which
follows the intercollegiate game with
Ihe University of California will be
held in San Francisco at the Ameri
can Theatre. Manager J. E. Stewart,
acting upon instructions received
from the Executive Committee, went
to San Francisco yesterday afternoon
and concluded the engagement of the
playhouse.
While it was definitely understood
that the show would be held in San
Francisco it was uncertain as to
which playhouse would be chosen.
Manager Stewart considered both the
Princess Theatre, which is located in
Ellis street, and the American, which
is in Market street above Seventh.
The latter management made a
much better financial proposition and
it is believed that this theatre has a
more accessible location. The down
town district of San Francisco is
daily coming to be a truer center of
the metropolitan community and
nearly all of the new first class res
taurants are in close proximity. In
reaching the train after the perform
ance, persons leaving the city will
find the location of the American
much more convenient.
The production which is billed for
the night of the game is "The Land
of Nod",a well known musical comedy
produced by an excellent Eastern
company. The management has
turned the entire house over to Man
ager Stewart for the night and tickets
will be sold both at the box office in
San Francisco and upon the campus.
The San Francisco sale is for the
benefit of the alumni and interested
spectators. The theatre is a new,
class A structure and has a seating
capacity of about 1550.
