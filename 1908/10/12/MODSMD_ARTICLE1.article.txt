### 
The rally and "jolly-up" given by
the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion Friday evening in Encina club
room was a great success. A large
number of students attended and
greatly appreciated the splendid pro
gram. W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, and W.
W. VVeist, general secretary of the
association, made hits with their
comic songs and were repeatedly en
chorpd. G. F. Morgan, '10, gave a
very clever monologue which was
well received. W. C. Shelton, 'OS,
delivered a short address and then
yielded the floor to President Jordan,
who responded by telling several fun
ny stories and further said: "I wish
that the faculty would be brought in
to closer touch with the students.
While the floor was being prepared
for the athletic numbers, (1. N. Rich
ardson, '09, and P. R. Johnson, '09,
led a short song and yell practice,
which was very enthusiastic. The
Glee Club gave the audience a good
idea how the new songs should go
and the men quickly mastered the
words and music.
Excellent exhibitions were given in
boxing, wrestling, fencing and tumbl
ing. O. Du F. Kehrlein, ex-'O5, and
H. W. Maloney, instructor of boxing
and fencing in Encina gymnasium,
gave exhibition matches in fencing
lirst with the French fencing foils
and then with regular duelling
swords. Instructor Long, of the En
cina gymnasium, acted as referee and
announcer.
The stag dance, which followed, was
-0011 broken up when the frankfurters
and buns appeared. A general rush
was made for the table, 011 which the
feed" was placed, and after some
confusion every one was supplied.
The association is planning to give
more of these entertainments, the
next one to be a barbecue.
