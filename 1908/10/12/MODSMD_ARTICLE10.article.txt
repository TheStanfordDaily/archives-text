The lecture delivered this after
noon by Professor Charles Moreau
Harger of the University of Kansas
on "The Newspaper" brings up the
question of giving University credit
at Stanford for work on the college
publications, and, incidentally, of
giving credit for work done in con
nection with some other student ac
tivities. It is by no means an unusual
practice in America! universities to
allow hours to writers for college
publications, to debaters, to members
of musical organizations and pos
sibly to some others. Provided that
some such system could be satisfac
torily devised here, it would be to the
advantage of every one concerned.
There is no questiou but that many
students in this University deserve
credit in hours for work done out
side of the regular college curriculum.
Such credit would be the means of
supplying several new courses which
would be eagerly attended. They
would add vigor to their departments.
activities, of course, would have
a higher standard under the system,
which would thus be of immediate
practical value. The Daily Palo Alto
does not recommend a system which
would give any control to the in
structors in the branches mentioned
for that would tend to defeat the ob
ject of the instruction. It would be
far more effective in developing abil
ity to leave the management and con
duction of such student activities in
the hands of the students, who should
be dependent solely on themselves
in this regard.
This matter has been considered
before and the Daily Palo Alto knows
of no reason why it was dropped.
Very probably a system of credit
could be satisfactorily arranged. If it
was done, it would seem to further
the purpose of il*' University.
