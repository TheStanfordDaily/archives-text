### 
The Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation held its tirst monthly mass
meeting yesterday in the Chapel. The
meeting was opened with song prac
tice and a selection by the Associa
tion quartette. Doctor Jordan spoke
on "American Christianity." In part
he said: "What this University most
needs is a revival of religion—not
daily sermons or special forms, but
a revival of true rrUgion. Religion
is akin to poetry for religious
thoughts are very largely expressed
by poetry, and when they are put into
prose much of their beauty is lost.
"This is God's world, and 110 world
of chance, but a world of meaning.
Things that happened yesterday are
disposed ol and cannot be changed.
Today is the day in which to do
things. One of the essentials of re
ligion is to do things that you have
to do at the right time, and that is
now. We cannot do things in the
thirteenth century nor in the twenty
second, but must do them while we
are living.
"Religion and science are dif
ferent sides of the same thing
and are not in opposition to each
other. Every church has its creeds,
but creeds are historical and written
down. Let them stand. While they
may be wrong, they Jo not harm any
one."
Reverend D. Charles Gardner gave
the benediction at the close of the
service.
