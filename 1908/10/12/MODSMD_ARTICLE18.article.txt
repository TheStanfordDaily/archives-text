### 
Upon an invitation from Mrs. G. T.
Clark and Mrs. J. E. Goodwin, the
Library staff held an informal feath
ering at the latter's home last Friday
night. During the evening the ques
tion of the advisability of reorganiz
ing the Library Club, an organization
that has been dead for some two
years, was brought up. It was finally
decided to reorganize the club as a
purely social society composed of the
library staff, and Librarian Clark was
named as president and .Miss A. X.
Hays, secretary-treasurer. Mr. Clark
gave a talk on the "History of Li
brary Movements and Libraries of
Central California."
