# Use of Stunts Abandoned.
## 
### 
The University of California rally
committee has made the announce
ment that there will be no use of

stunts such as have attended past in- 1
tercollegiate events, by Blue and Gold
After interviews with former yell
leaders, the committer decided the big
game was partaking too much of the
nature of a carnival and that the nion-1
ey used in preparing for these stunts
should be devoted to improving equip
ment, while the energy expended I
should be employed in bettering the j
yelling. This will do away with the
employment of all such accessories |
as balloons, bombs and confetti, al-J
though it was the intent of the board
to retain the use of the rooters' hats. |
