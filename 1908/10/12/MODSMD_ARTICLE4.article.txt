# VARSITY TEAM WINS AND FRESHMEN TIE ON SATURDAY
## Olympics Lose Rough Game While University of the Pacific Plays Indecisive Contest With 1912 Fifteen. 
### 
A victory, a tie, and three Varsity
men injured sums up the result of the
| Rugby games here Saturday. The
Olympics were defeated 12 to while
the Freshmen tied with the Univer
sity of the Pacific 5 10 5. As for the
I accidents, Ganong Inoke a jaw bone,
which will incapacitate him for about
: ten days, Scott fractured a rib, which
will keep him off the field for a week,
and Mitchell was hurt in tlie head.
The varsity game, in effects on the
players, was one of the roughest ever
witnessed on Stanford Field. The
Cardinal had a clear advantage from
the start, and the failure to run up a
larger score was due to the fact that
fourteen substitutes were used dur
ing the contest. Until Mitchell, Ga
nong and Scott retired, the backfield
worked as a unit, but after they left,
the greater part of the work devolved
upon the forwards, who put up a good
defensive game, but were unable to
accomplish much in the way of scor
ing.
A perfect passing rally from Elliott
to Mitchell and Ganong, and then out
to Scott and Cadwalader accomplish
ed the first try of the day. The play
reminded one of the spectacular and
effective backfield rushes in the var
sity match last November. Crawford
failed to convert. Soon afterward a
brilliant ruck carried the pigskin
close to the Olympics' goal, where
Mitchell secured the ball and dashed
over for the second try. The tackle
aggravated the injury he had received
a few minutes earlier, and he was
replaced by Roth. Miller tried for a
goal but the pigskin failed to go be
! tween the posts. Stanford scored
once more before the interval, when
Holman took the ball after a dribbling
rush. Again the conversion was mis
sed, and half-time found the score 9
Ito 0.
Drew was responsible for the only
try registered by the Varsity during
I the second period, lie made a pretty
| run and passed to Roth just before
crossing the line. Fletcher failed in
his attempt to kick the goal. Soon
after the resumption of play, the
Stanford line was crossed for the first
time this season. An Olympic for
ward found touch well down in the
Cardinal territory, and 011 the line
out, Clark secured and dashed over
the line. A continued punting dual
marked the closing moments of the
contest.
The work of Referee Blair was less
satisfactory than formerly. The line
ups:
Stanford—lvoerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Crawford, Pemberton, Miller, Rey
nolds, McGregor, Batterson, Doyle,
Evans, Wallace, Vose, Gay, for

Freshmen, University of the Pa
cific, o.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
1912 team only succeeded in tying
the fifteen which the University of
California Freshmen had defeated <i
to 0, the playing of the Cardinal first
year men was extremely encouraging
Saturday. The backs executed a few
real passing rallies for the first time
this season, while the playing of the
forwards seemed to show that they
understood the fine." details of the
play.
No scoring characterized the first
half, but early in the second the 1912
backs got loose and covered GT» yards
before their rush was interrupted.
With the ball on the visitors' 2"> yard
line, A. Sanborn started a short drib
bling rally, from which Sundell se
cured the ball and crossed the line,
Rodgers converting. Shortly after
ward, Atkinson, the star of the op
posing team, got free in the loose and
registered three points for his fifteen,
Smith making it five.
A little individual head-work at the
right time would have given the
Freshmen two or three more tries,
and this is especially true of Hatch,
who having crossed the goal line, was
endeavoring to plant the ball square
ly behind the posts when he was
tackled and lost possession of the
oval.
Of the new men on the team Sun
dell and Doran excelled. After mak
ing but a mediocre full during the
first period, Sundell was transferred
to wing where he seemed to be
thoroughly at home. Doran in the
scrum was always right on top of the
ball and playing hard. The line-ups:
Freshmen — Corbet, Crandall,
Schaupp, Hubbard, Doran, King,
Rodgers, forwards; Macready, wing
forward; Hatch, half; Whitney, T.
Sanborn, fives; A. Sanborn, center;

A victory, a tie, and three Varsity
men injured sums up the result of the
| Rugby games here Saturday. The
Olympics were defeated 12 to while
the Freshmen tied with the Univer
sity of the Pacific 5 10 5. As for the
I accidents, Ganong Inoke a jaw bone,
which will incapacitate him for about
: ten days, Scott fractured a rib, which
will keep him off the field for a week,
and Mitchell was hurt in tlie head.
The varsity game, in effects on the
players, was one of the roughest ever
witnessed on Stanford Field. The
Cardinal had a clear advantage from
the start, and the failure to run up a
larger score was due to the fact that
fourteen substitutes were used dur
ing the contest. Until Mitchell, Ga
nong and Scott retired, the backfield
worked as a unit, but after they left,
the greater part of the work devolved
upon the forwards, who put up a good
defensive game, but were unable to
accomplish much in the way of scor
ing.
A perfect passing rally from Elliott
to Mitchell and Ganong, and then out
to Scott and Cadwalader accomplish
ed the first try of the day. The play
reminded one of the spectacular and
effective backfield rushes in the var
sity match last November. Crawford
failed to convert. Soon afterward a
brilliant ruck carried the pigskin
close to the Olympics' goal, where
Mitchell secured the ball and dashed
over for the second try. The tackle
aggravated the injury he had received
a few minutes earlier, and he was
replaced by Roth. Miller tried for a
goal but the pigskin failed to go be
! tween the posts. Stanford scored
once more before the interval, when
Holman took the ball after a dribbling
rush. Again the conversion was mis
sed, and half-time found the score 9
Ito 0.
Drew was responsible for the only
try registered by the Varsity during
I the second period, lie made a pretty
| run and passed to Roth just before
crossing the line. Fletcher failed in
his attempt to kick the goal. Soon
after the resumption of play, the
Stanford line was crossed for the first
time this season. An Olympic for
ward found touch well down in the
Cardinal territory, and 011 the line
out, Clark secured and dashed over
the line. A continued punting dual
marked the closing moments of the
contest.
The work of Referee Blair was less
satisfactory than formerly. The line
ups:
Stanford—lvoerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Crawford, Pemberton, Miller, Rey
nolds, McGregor, Batterson, Doyle,
Evans, Wallace, Vose, Gay, for
wards; Heinly, MacKenzie, wing for
ward: Elliott, Wheeler, half; Mitchell,
Ganong, Roth, ArreM, fives; Scott,

Freshmen, University of the Pa
cific, o.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
1912 team only succeeded in tying
the fifteen which the University of
California Freshmen had defeated <i
to 0, the playing of the Cardinal first
year men was extremely encouraging
Saturday. The backs executed a few
real passing rallies for the first time
this season, while the playing of the
forwards seemed to show that they
understood the fine." details of the
play.
No scoring characterized the first
half, but early in the second the 1912
backs got loose and covered GT» yards
before their rush was interrupted.
With the ball on the visitors' 2"> yard
line, A. Sanborn started a short drib
bling rally, from which Sundell se
cured the ball and crossed the line,
Rodgers converting. Shortly after
ward, Atkinson, the star of the op
posing team, got free in the loose and
registered three points for his fifteen,
Smith making it five.
A little individual head-work at the
right time would have given the
Freshmen two or three more tries,
and this is especially true of Hatch,
who having crossed the goal line, was
endeavoring to plant the ball square
ly behind the posts when he was
tackled and lost possession of the
oval.
Of the new men on the team Sun
dell and Doran excelled. After mak
ing but a mediocre full during the
first period, Sundell was transferred
to wing where he seemed to be
thoroughly at home. Doran in the
scrum was always right on top of the
ball and playing hard. The line-ups:
Freshmen — Corbet, Crandall,
Schaupp, Hubbard, Doran, King,
Rodgers, forwards; Macready, wing
forward; Hatch, half; Whitney, T.
Sanborn, fives; A. Sanborn, center;
