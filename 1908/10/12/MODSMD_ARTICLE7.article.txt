# DR. NICHOLLS PREACHES
## EPISCOPALIAN BISHOP GIVES FORCEFUL SERMON. Speaks on Universities and Religion to Large Audience in the Chapel. 
### 
Bishop Nicholls, of San Francisco
preached one of the most powerful
sermons of I lie yen r in the Univer
sity Chapel yesterday morning to a
large audience. He took as his sub
ject the general topic of "The Univer
i sity and Religion." The fact was
brought out that universities were
, first founded with a religions motive
after the crusades. Oxford was
j cited as a good example. Harvard,
coining down to move modern times,
was founded to teach learning and
Godliness to the Indians and the
â–  youth 01 the colonies.
Today, according '.o Hishop Nich
olls, our American University is a
! popular institution through the rise
of the people. Harvard, when it was
founded to foster learning, was the
first example of a movement in this
direction. This new democratic
spirit challenges the old idea that the
university works down the throne.
Bishop Nicholls continued by say
ing that universities need Christ and
his religion. He said that every one
asks "What has Christianity in it for
me?" The universities are working
more and more towards the man, and
the trend of university training is to
help men to answer this question.
The tendency of the age is more and
more towards the study of the age.
The problem before the universities
today is to make manhood and wo
manhood.
