lecture on "Modern Journalism" in

told ot the principles of newspaper
writing and urged all his hearers

newspaper work was a valuable train
ing for most men intending to follow
any professional career, and was an
almost necessary apprenticeship for
magazine writers.

Florid, overweighted language is an
abomination in the modern news
