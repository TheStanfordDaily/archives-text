The Daily Palo Alto wishes to call
the attention of the University com
munity to the fact that the Graduate
Manager has provided two Rugby
games for tomorrow afternoon,, to
which admission will tie free. Good
contests will undoubtedly be played.
The Varsity substitutes will meet lhe
team of the Olympic Club and the
Freshmen will appear against an out
side fifteen for the last time before
the intercollegiate game next Satur
day.
The fact that no admission will be
charged for tomorrow's contests will
probably offset any decrease in at
tendance which might be caused by
the early hour set for the first game.
This was unavoidable. That an un
usually large crowd should take ad
vantage of the exceptional opportu
nity to see the teams in action should
be patent to all who are notified of
the occasion.
