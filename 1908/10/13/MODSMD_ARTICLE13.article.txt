# To Organize Forestry Club.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Botany Club,
which will be held in a few days,
plans will be drawn up for the for
mation of a Forestry Club. Owing to
the fact that few students have here
tofore been interested in forestry, no
organization separate from the Botany
Club has been formed. As there is
a great increase in the number of
students wishing to take up this
work now, it has been decided to have
two separate clubs in the Botany de
partment.
The club will have to carry on its
work independent of the department,
however, as there is no regular
course in forestry g'ven in the Uni
versity at present. As forestry may
now be looked upon as a growing
profession, it is possible that a prac
tical course along these lines will be
soon given.
