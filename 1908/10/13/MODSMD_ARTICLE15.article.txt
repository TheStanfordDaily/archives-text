has been compiling a very compre
hensive book which is almost ready

ed trip through tlie West Indies, for
the purpose of gathering additional
material to be used in this book.
Specimens of the various type ferns

field for the study of terns and mosses.
It is not expected that this later
book on ferns will lie ready for publi
cation until some time in November.
