## Plan Reorganization of club With Larger Membership to Promote Interest. 
### 
Plans are 011 foot among some of
the older members for a complete re
organization of the tennis club, in
volving a considerable increase in
the membership and the establish
ment of the club u| on a more sub
stantial basis. It is the intention of
those behind this movement to hold
several tournaments during the year
as an encouragement for more men
to come out and maintain their prac
tice. With the view of increasing in
terest in the game is planned to
secure exhibition matches between
crack players from San Francisco
and vicinity.
New courts are badly needed to ac
commodate the men who wish to play
the game for exercise, as well as
those who are practicing for the var
sity teams, and an active campaign
will be inaugurated to secure the nec
essary courts. Among the old tennis
men who are pushing the movement
are R. Gott, '09, A. J. Gowan, '09, T.
('. Henry, '10, and H. Mann, '09.
