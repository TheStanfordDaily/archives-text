# PRIZE AWARDED FOR YELL.
## Committee Decides That Two Compositions Are Worthy to Be Used on the Bleachers. 
### 
At the meeting of the prize yell
committee today, one prize was
awarded for the best composition
and two yells adopted for use on the
bleachers. W. 11. Cline, '11, was the
successful contestant who submitted
the winning composition, receiving a
prize ol five dollars for the produc
tion. The yell follows:
L. S. J. 11., Rah,
| L. S. J. U., Rah,
! L. S. J. VS., Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah,
Stanford, Rah!
The second yell chosen by the com
mittee was submitted by J. M. Ward,
'07, for which honorable mention was
given him. The yell is as follows:
Stan — ford!
Stan — ford!
RAH — rah — rah. rah.
(Pause or drum) STANFORD!
The intention of the writer of the
last yell is that the first "Stan" in
each case is to be prolonged, while
the following syllable is short and
quick. The initial "Rah" is very loud,
the next and the last, two are to be
given in quick succession.
The committee wishes to commend
all those who submitted yells in com
petition and desires to thank them
for their interest in the contest.
