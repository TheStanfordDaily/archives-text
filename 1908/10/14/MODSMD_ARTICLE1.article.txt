# SECOND TEAM VICTORS
## DEFEATED OLYMPICS BY SCORE OF 3 TO 0 IN SECOND HALF. Hard-Fought. Contest Characterized by Many Dribbling Rushes This Afternoon. 
### 
The Rugby contest .between the
Olympics and the Varsity substitutes
this afternoon resulted in a 3 to 0
victory for the Cardinal fifteen in two
short halves of fierce playing but
mediocre football. The Stanford
pack played a strong game and did
excellent work in the rucks, but the
hackfield failed to inaugurate any
successful passing rushes, making the
game slow and uninteresting, espec
ially in the second half.
A slight injury to Thorpe on Satur
day kept him out of the game today.
.Minturn, however, was in evidence
throughout the contest. It. Little,
'10, played a consistent half.
First half:
The first half, which ended in a
0 to 0 score, consisted in only a suc
cession of fierce rucks and dribbling
rushes. Scarcely any passing rallies
characterized the play during this
period. Neither side had any distinct
advantage, although the brilliant
finding of touch by Briggs, the visit
ing fullback, seriously threatened
the Cardinal goal at one time. A
penalty kick put an end to the danger.
.Most of the play was near the center
of the field and nothing spectacular
occurred before the call of time.
Second half:
In the second period the varsity
substitutes started with a rush and
forced the ball over the line for a
touch-down; but the visitors dribbled
out of danger, Snedigar securing and
making a pretty 25-yard run along
the touch line. Soon afterward, Ev
ans and McKenzie started a dribbling
rush at the center of the field and
forced the ball into touch at the Olym
pics' 5-yard line. After two unsuc
cessful attempts to score by passing
rushes Vose secured the ball out of
the ruck on the 2-yard line and
bucked across for th« only try of the
day, making the score 3to 0. Fletch
er failed to convert. After the drop
out play mostly remained near the
center of the field, Mthough the var
sity twice threatened the visitors'
goal. Two penalty kicks were award
ed the Olympic team but both were
too near the center of the field to be
dangerous. Near the close of the per
iod all the forward substitutes were
put into the game.
