# FRESHMEN WIN TODAY
## PALO ALTO LOSES DECIDING GAME OF SERIES. Fast Playing of 1912 Fifteen During Last Half of Match Results in 3 to 0 Score. 
### 
Three points i'or the Freshmen and
none for Palo Alto tell the result of
a fast and interesting game between
these fifteens late this afternoon. Al
though the advantage was clearly
with the high school team during the
first half, the 1912 men rallied after
the interval and outplayed their op
ponents. Very little backfield work
was seen during the contest, and the
only spectacular rally behind the
scrum resulted in the try and the
game for the Cardinal. This was the
third and deciding match between
Palo Alto and the Freshmen, the lat
ter having captured the first 8 to 3,
and Palo Alto annexing the second
by a score of 3 to 0.
First half:
The Palo Alto forv ards started the
game with their accustomed fierce
ness and completely overwhelmed
their opponents in the Cardinal scrum
during the first few moments of the
play. The Freshmen then rallied and
carried the ball for the first time in
to the high school's territory.
This advantage did not last long,
however, for by finding touch suc
cessfully and exciting several swift
rucks Palo Alto brought the play into
close proximity to the Cardinal goal.
The ball remained on Stanford's side
of the field from then until the call
of time, the period ending in a 0 to 0
score. During the latter part of the
half Captain Erb several times gave
the Cardinal a breathing spell by
quick and accurate kicks into touch.
Second half:
Soon after the opening of the sec
ond period the tide turned in favor
of the Stanford men who carried the
pigskin close to Palo Alto's line be
fore the high school forwards real
ized that play had commenced. A
score was saved by dribbling into
touch. Play remained in the Fresh
men's territory until the greater por
tion of the period had elapsed, when
several rangy punts which were
poorly handled by the Cardinal gave
the advantage to Palo Alto, it was
at this juncture that the right side
of the 1912 backs secured the ball
and registered the only try after a
60-yard rush, Sundell carrying the
ball the last 15 yards and over the
line. Rodgers missed a difficult goal.
Just before the call of time the visi
tors worked the oval well down into
the Freshmen territory, but nothing
more dangerous resulted. The line
