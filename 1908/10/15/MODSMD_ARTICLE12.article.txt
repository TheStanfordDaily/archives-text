### 
Treasurer C. G. Lf.throp left a few
days ago for New York, to attend the
funeral of his brother Ariel Lathrop,
whose death occurred last Sunday.
It is not known how long he intends
to remain away but probably will not
return until all business in connection
with the settling of the estate has
been transacted.
