# UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE MEETS
## More Extensive Student Control Is Discussed.â€”Other Matters of Interest. Brought Up. 
### 
At a meeting of the University Con
ference held last evening at Dr. Jor
dan's residence, fourteen members
were present and a number of import
ant matters were taken up and dis
cussed. Among the matters brought
up before the conference was the
question of the possibility of more ex
tensive student control upon the cam
pus. As no one present had an exact
knowledge of the working details of
the systems in vogue at the Univer
sity of California, Bryn Mawr and
other American universities and col
leges, a committee was appointed by
President Shelton to make a careful
investigation into the matter and to
report upon the subject' at the next
meeting of the conference.
The present ruling of allowing no
candidates of any political party to
make campaign speeches in University
buildings was brought up and dis
cussed at some length. At the next
meeting a formal recommendation
Will be laid before President Jordan
to be acted upon by the University
faculty.
The possibility of allowing Univer
sity credit for certain college activi
ties, especially in the cases of various
student publications, was, after some
discussion, referred to a committee
which should confer with the men in
terested in the proposed scheme and
also with the professors who have
had experience with such a plan.
