# TAKES DRASTIC ACTION
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE RATIFIES GUILD BOARD ACTION Registration of Students Who Wantonly Fail to Pay Hospital Bills Will Be Cancelled. 
### 
The Executive Committee last night
received a communication from the
(luild Hoard which disclosed the fact
that the board is being seriously
handicapped in its work because of
the failure of a large number of stu
dents now in the University to pay
their hospital Wilis. Approximately
twenty live hundred dollars is the sum
now due from these students, most
<>l this amount being made up of small
sums. The interesting circumstance
developed that the larger accounts
are usually settled most promptly.
In view of the fact that the Guild
Hospital is essentially a student body
institution, and as every other means
of collecting these bills has failed,
the Executive Committee ratified the
action asked for in the appended
communication and directed that it
lie carried into effect immediately.
"To the Executive Committee of the
Student Body:
"At the October meeting of the
Guild Board the question of finances
was carefully considered and the re
port of the Ways and Means Commit
tee showed that, while the Guild has
a small balance on hand at the pres
ent, it is absolutely necessary to have
all bills owing it paid up in order to
maintain a balance. The report also
showed that the student members of
the Guild have become more and more
lax in the matter of paying their hos
pital bills until there is now a very
large amount outstanding. These bills
are for the most part small and have
run for a very long time. Requests
for payment have been unavailing and
the Board after careful consideration
took the following action: 'That it be
(he sense of the Board that registra
tion in the University for the second
semester be refused to all persons
owing hospital bills unless such bills
be paid, or some arrangement, satis
factory to the Guild Board, be made
in regard to them. The Guild being
a Student Body institution, the Board
asks that the Executive Committee
ratify this action in order that it may
be put into effect.' I have the promise
of the University authorities that such
action will lie allowed provided the
Executive Committee ratifies it. The
action may seem severe to some but
it is absolutely necessary to properly
carry on the work of the Hospital and
it is, therefore, earnestly requested
that the Committee ratify this action
without delay.

The Graduate Manager was author
ized to dispose of the old student
body piano, which has been stored
in the Assembly Hall for several
years past, he having received an ac
ceptable offer for it.
The Committee was advised that
only one Palo Alto merchant has
thus far been able to secure any
rooters'hats and his total supply con
sists of about one hundred and fifty.
A select committee was appointed to
find out where an added supply can
be procured. No student will be al
lowed to sit in the rooters' section
