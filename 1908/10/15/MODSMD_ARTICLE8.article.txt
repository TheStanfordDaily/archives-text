While the Columbia Park Boys re
main on the campus tomorrow and
Saturday, they will be in a sense the
guests of the whole University. En
cina Club and lloble Club have pro
vided special entertainment for the
visitors and the managers of the As
sociated Students of the two Univer
sities have made the way clear for
them to see two good Rugby games.
The least that the Universtiy com
munity can do for these deserving
boys is to see that their vaudeville
show is a financial success. They
have the reputation of giving the best
juvenile entertainment of any organ
ization in the state.
