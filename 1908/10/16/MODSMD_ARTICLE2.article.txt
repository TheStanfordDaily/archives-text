, ~'Everj man on the Freshman team
knows that lie is going into an an ful
ly hard tight on Saturday afternoon,
and every man is going into it de
termined to give Berkeley the best lie
lias got."â€”Coach George J. Presley.
With the spirit which these words
so intensely express predominating at
the football rally for the 1912 fifteen,
which was held in Assembly Hall last
night, the men who are to support
the Cardinal against; the attacks of
the Blue and Gold tomorrow \vt re
given a final rousing send-off, which
concluded with a long and moru-ter
serpentine on tlie inner quad.
At. the commencement of the rally
the playing of the band and the usual
yelling and singing were soon inter
rupted by the vociferous welcome
which greeted the entrance of the
experience teaches that it is practi
cally impossible to determine from
preliminary games what the Fresh
men will do when once against their
foes in the intercollegiate match.
A glance at the api.ended table will
show that the Care inal is slightly
outweighed, but that the advantage of
the Blue and Gold is distributed rath
er evenly throughout the team.
The comparative scores also give
California a little the better of the ar
gument. The Stanford Freshmen
have participated in eight games, los
ing two and tying one. The men
across the bay have played in seven
contests against practically the same
opponents that faced the Cardinal
forces, California winning five and
drawing one. In their eight matches
the Stanford players registered 52
points, while 43 we*e tallied against
them. In their seven contests the
Californians secured 54 points, and
their opponents 39. Following is a
resume of the season's preliminary
games:
Stanford 0, Barbarians 24; Stan
ford 8, Palo Alto 3; Stanford 8, St.
Mary's 5; Stanford 14, San .lose 3;
Stanford 0. Palo Alto 3; Stanford 14,
Santa Clara College 0; Stanford 5,
Uni crsitv of the Pacific 5; Stanford
3, Palo Alto 0; California 0, Barbar
ians 2ti; California G, University of
the Pacific 0; California 13, Olympics
5; California 5, St. Mary's 5: Califor
nia 3, St. Mary's 0; California 14, San
Jose 0; California 16, Santa Clara
College 0.
Comparative scores are rather a
meaningless gauge, however, and the
chances for victory tomorrow are
very nearly even. Both teams have
proved themselves reliable in their
practice games; the one that proves
itself the most reliable in the final
struggle can not fail to be returned
the winner.
T. J. Lafferty is slated for the po
sition of referee. With the consent of
both California and Stanford, Laf
ferty was appointed by the Pacific
Coast Referees' Union. He is easily
the most efficient member of that or
ganization, and his decisions in the
many games which he has previously
refereed on the local gridiron have
invariably been utterly impartial and
entirely satisfactory. Elliott, of the
Barbarian Club, and Cameron, the
San Francisco referee, will be the
touch judges, while D. E. Brown, '97,
and his brother, Everett, U.C., '97, will
as usual, keep the time.
The Cardinal rooters will occupy
a section on the east side of the
bleachers, and the rooters of the
Blue and Gold will be located directly
opposite the Stanford men.
Suitable arrangements have been
made for the handling of a large
crowd, and should the weather be
fine, a record attendance for a Fresh
man game is expected. For the bene
fit of any who may not be able to
catch the regular morning trains
from San Francisco, the Southern Pa
cific will run a special, which will
leave Third and Townsend streets at
12:30 and, returning, will depart
from Palo Alto soon after the con
clusion of the contest.
