The place is Stanford Field, Ihe day

event the annual intercollegiate
Rugby battle between the first-year
Rugby fifteens of California and Stan

ance to the struggle of the Varsity
teams in November is this meeting of
the Freshman hosts, scheduled for
tomorrow' afternoon.
All the contestan's have received
thoroughly adequate coaching and
training: the heroes of the Blue and
Gold in an effort to 'add one more to
their already length' list of Fresh
man victories; the Cardinal athletes
in the hope and firmly rooted de
termination to at least break the for
midable chain of past defeats. The
two teams will come together on the
field under the critical but enthusias

Prediction as to the outcome of the
impending battle is necessarily diffi
cult and uncertain. Difficult, for the
final line-up of the Cardinal forces
was announced but yesterday—Cali
fornia's fifteen was published to the
world only today; uncertain, for past
team, the substitutes and coach, head
ed by Captain Erb. The noisy re
ception was of several minutes du
ration and was followed by a round
of cheers, after which the first speak
er of the evening was called to 'he
stage. Rev. D. Charles Gardner, J. E
Shelton, '10, Coach Presley, and Pro
fessor B. E. Howard spoke in the or
der named.
Rev. Gardner said in part: "I feel
sure that every man will muster all
that there is in him and no one can
do any more. There is no need to
caution you about fairness, for every
Stanford man plays fair."
Probably the most pertinent ad
dress of the evening was made by .1.
E. Shelton, who began by stating that
the change from the old style of foot
ball to Rugby was suggested by Cali
fornia, who found herself somewhat
embarrassed by the Cardinal's re
peated Varsity victories. The Blue
and Gold freshmen, however, had not
yet suffered defeat n Rugby at the
hands of a Stanford learn, and conse
quently it was up to 1912 to admin
ister the thrashing. He said in con
clusion: "Two thingd are necessary
to bring us victory—the men on the
bleachers and the team on the field.
Every ounce of yell is needed to
drive the team on to victory, but pri
marily the result rests with the fifteen
players. Actions speak louder than
words. Let your actions speak elo
quently for you and your University
on Saturday."
Professor Howard pointed out
clearly and forcibly that a victory
won at the cost of sacrificing clean
sportsmanship and absolute fairness
was infinitely worse than no victory
at all.
