# BARBARIANS TO PLAY
## VARSITY WILL OPPOSE THE SAN FRANCISCANS AGAIN. Third and Filial Game of the Series Will Be Decided Tomorrow Morning at 10:30. 
### 
Promptly at 10:30 tomorrow morn
ins the regular Varsity team will face
the Barbarian fifteen in the third and
probably final game of the series be
tween those teams. The two matches
already played resulted in decisive
victories for the Cardinal 011 each oc
casion, the Barbarians having been
defeated 22 to 0 and 24 to 0. The visi
tors will have substantially the same
line-up as previously, with the ad
dition of G. P. Shaner, '07, at lock.
The Varsity will be deprived of the
services of Ganong, at five, and Scott,
at center, who are still on the in
jured list, while Erb, of course, will
not be found at half. The presence
of both Cadwalader and Cook, how
ever. will materially strengthen a
rather crippled backfleld. No changes
will occur in the scrum.
Captain Elliott of the Barbarians:
claims that his lean has benefitted
greatly by the last few weeks of prac
tice, and his statement is borne out
by their showing at Berkeley Satin-j
day, when they triumphed over the
California team 11 t<. 0. Consequent- j
ly, a much closer match may be ex
pected than resulted from the first
two meetings of the rival teams. The
line-ups:
Stanford —Koerner, Terrill, Cheda.
Pemberton, Crawford, Miller, Rey
nolds, forwards; lleinly, wing for-'
ward; Elliott, half; Mitchell, Roth, |
fives; Cook, center; Holnian, Cad
walader, wings; Jordan, full.
Barbarians —Webber, Goff, Moverly, I
Duryea, Shaner, Kay, McWalters, for
wards; Brown, wing torward; Hamil-|
ton, Phillips, halves; Pomeroy, Dono
van, Elliott, Sharpe, three-quarters: |
Goodeß, full.
