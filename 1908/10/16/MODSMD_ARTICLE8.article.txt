Three successive defeats have been
the bitter cup of the Cardinal for the
past three intercollegiate Freshman
football contests. More than any oth
er Stanford Freshman Rugby team,
the fifteen men of the Class of 1!)12
who will tight for the University to
morrow are qualified to win their
game. Every man and woman on the
campus should be at Stanford Field
to see that they do. As close as they
are able to tell what is right in the
fierce moments of play, the members,
of the Stanford team will fight fair.
To do their best â€”that is an achieve
ment, of degree and indeterminate.
When they come off (he field for the
last time, may there be not one of
them who can think for even an in
stant: "If I had only lasted a second
longer, run a whit faster, or strained
a bit, harder, we might have won!"
But let every man be able to say: "1
gave my all!" And may every man,
when he steps on the field, grit his
teeth for an ordeal of nerves, speed,
and force, and none let up till it is
over.
