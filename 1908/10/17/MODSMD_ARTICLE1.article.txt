# CALIFORNIA TRIUMPHS OVER STANFORD FRESHMEN
## Forward Divisions Are Even, but Blue and Gold Backs Overwhelm Cardinal and Raise the Score to 21-5. 
### 
Advisory Coach Eaiiagan—
"Berkeley had a much better
team. Their backs were so
much faster than ours that we
never had a chance."
"Wad'Mloulton —"The j weir,
too last for us and smothered
our plays. Their passing' was
better than ours."

Fighting gallantly but against foes
whose strength and prowess increas
ed as the struggle drew nearer to a
close, the fifteen gritty men of the
1912 Stanford Freshman team were
overwhelmed by the fiery onslaughts
of the California backfield in the fif
teenth annual Freshman football bat
tle between the two institutions, con
tested on Stanford Field this after
noon. The final score of 21 to 5
adequately and accurately portrays
the relative merits of the two fifteens.
But let it be said to the credit of the
Cardinal forwards that they were in
every respect the equal of their op
ponents from across the bay. The
utter defeat of the Stanford forces
must be charged to the backs: not
so much to the weakness of the Cardi
nal back division as to the incompar
able ability and untiring efforts of the
Blue and Gold athletes behind the
pack. Outplayed at all times, out
generaled at intervals, and often out
witted, the Stanford backs accom
plished scarcely anything on the of
fensive and were of little greater
worth on defense. The speed and
cleverness of the Blue and Gold pass
ing rallies had their opponents at
their mercy, while the Cardinal hosts
were almost helpless against the rare
and stalwart aggressiveness of their
hackfield foes. Concerning the for
wards, however, a different tale must
he told. The Cardinal pack had a
clear advantage during the early part
of the battle and easily held their own
until the final call ol' time. The Car
dinal pack taught every minute and
their scrappy prowess alone prevent
ed a much larger score.
Contrary to intercollegiate contests
in lht> past the condition of the Stan
ford men was not superior today in
comparison to that, of the Blue and
Gold heroes, whose speed increased
with every play an I never for one
instant lagged. The forwards of the
Cardinal team lasted gamely notwith
standing the seemingly never-ending
additions to the California score, but
the Stanford backs 'vere overrun the
easier by their fast and invincible an
tagonists as the struggle continued.
Speed and fight won the fourth con
secutive intercollegiate Freshman
game for the California fifteen.
T. J. Lafferty proved himself the
most efficient referee who has ever
officiated in that position on Stanford
Field. He was always close to the
play, and only those impossible of
satisfaction could find the least fault
with his decisions.

Through the courtesy of the Palo
Alto manager of the Pacific Telephone
and Telegraph company, direct con
nections between Stanford Field and
the office of the Daily Palo Alto were
established this afternoon. The game,
as it progressed is reported as fol

Trainer Christie—"We were

tinually coaehvd their Fresh

sarily rough. I am glad we
won because we did not get
a square deal."

Second half:
Stanford Comes Hack Strong.
The second half started with Rodg
ers' kick-off to California's 20-yard
line. A line-out was called 10 yards
nearer the center of the field. The
Blue and Gold dribbled down but
Brown returned to center. A number
of line-outs brought the ball to Stan
ford's 25-yard line. A long kick sent
the ball across the line, where Brown
touched down. No sooner had Stan
ford dropped-out than the ball was
rushed back once more. At this junc
ture Macready marked and Rodgers'
foot sent, the ball well towards center.
Again the Blue,and Gold dribbled
only to incur a free-kick penalty
when near the line, and play came
back to center.
Rodgers was given a free kick from
center, which he followed up. He
tackled the catcher within 10 yards
of the Blue and Gold line. Although
injured in the play he resumed his
place in the game. A scrum on tin*

out, which Sundell ran in 20 yards.
California Strikes Her Gait.
The ball came back to center, where
a quick line-out gave the Blue and
Gold opportunity to run the spheroid
in 25 yards. The Ca'ifornia backs se
cured the ball from a scrum, and
passed to Rath bone, who registered
another try, which Harris easily con
verted. Score: California 11, Stan
ford 5.
A few minutes of fast, fierce drib
bling and rucking occurred. The un
tiring Blue and Gold backs once more
eluded pursuit and Harris succeeded
in placing the ball squarely between
the posts before being downed. Har
ris added two more points by con
verting. Score: California 16, Stan
ford 5.
The kick-off was soon brought back
and Harnett, getting loose ran f>o yards
until he was forced to pass. Kennedy
getting the ball, and becoming rattled,
threw it directly into Wheeler's hands,
who had no difficulty in tallying the
try. Harris converted. Score Cali
fornia 21, Stanford 5.
On the resumption of play, Black
succeeded Gabriel at, five-eighths for
California. Soon afterwards, Watt
replaced Rathbone at wing three
quarters. The Stanford forwards
took a brace and temporarily kept
their opponents from getting the ba'l
to their backs. Nickerson replaced
Wegener at rear rank for the Bine
and Gold.
Play settled near center and many
fierce dribbling rushes followed in
fast succession.
It was not long before the Blue and
Gold backs rushed the pigskin down
the field, and the call of time found
the ball on Stanford's 15-yard line.
The final pistol shot served as an
expected signal to the California
rooters, who swooped down upon the
gridiron to serpentine Stanford Field
for the second time in celebration of
a Freshman Rugby victory. But as
long as the merriment of the Blue and
Gold partisans continued, the Cardinal

supporters remained i<n the bleachers,
cheering lustily for their vanquished
heroes.
