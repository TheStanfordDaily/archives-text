# May Debate University of Utah Team.
## 
### 
President G. B. Bush of the Inter
society Debating League is in receipt
of a communication from the debat
ing management of the University of
Utah in which it is proposed to hold
an annual intercollegiate contest be
tween the two universities. The Utah
men offer to bear the expenses of
sending a Stanford team to their
state in case the other arrangements
for the proposed debate can be satis
factorily concluded. However, it is
improbable that such a contest will be
held, the great distance separating the
two institutions beitg a difficult ob
stacle to overcome.
