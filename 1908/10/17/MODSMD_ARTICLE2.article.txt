# VARSITY WINS 28 TO 3
## CARDINAL VICTORIOUS OVER BARBARIAN TEAM. Varsity Fifteen Plays Aggressive Game Although Crippled in the Backfield 
### 
Six tries by the Cardinal, five con
versions by Crawford, and a 47-yard
goal from placement £>y Elliott consti
tuted the scoring in the Varsity-Bar
barian game on Sta iford Field this
morning, leaving the final tally 2S to
3. This result well for the
strength ot the Card rial, as just one
week ago California went down to
defeat at the hands ot' the same team
to the time of 11 to 0, and, further
more, the Stanford backiield today
played without the assistance of eith
er Erb, Scott, or Ganong. The pack,
however, put up the best exhibition
of forward work yet seen this season,
and Mitchell was a wonder behind
the scrum.
Elliott's beautiful place kick was
the first score of the day. Donovan
had marked, and the Barbarian cap
tain, despite the hea\y wind, sent the
ball squarely over the bar. The Car
dinal was not slow to retaliate, how
ever, and at the end of a passing rally
Cadwalader was downed near the
line, Terrill falling 0.1 the oval which
had rolled across. The pigskin was
quickly returned to the Barbarians'
territory after the drop-out. Cook se
cured, made a short kick, caught the
ball- again and tallied the second
try, just before the end of the half.
At the opening of the second per
iod, Evans took Reynold's place in the
rear rank, while Drew replaced Cad
walader at wing. A dribbling rush,
followed by a passing rally brought
the oval within scoring distance, and
Terrill soon registered another try.
The fourth tally was made by the
speedy Holman who distanced all
competitors in a race for the pigskin,
which had been booted over the goal.
For the fi.-st and only time Crawford
failed to convert. Pemberton and
Heinly's dribbling was responsible
for the next tally which was register
ed by the Cardinal. The final try
came shortly before the end of the
game after a series of fast passing
rushes, Mitchell at last forcing his
way over for the sixth score.
