Stanford's defeat today was due to
the tact, that her opponents were too
fast for her. We c<in feel sure that
our men fought as best they knew
how in tlie fierce battle for suprem
acy. For their struggle against over
whelming odds they deserve great
credit. The victory was a clean case
of superiority in the Blue and Gold.
The defeat is disheartening to all
Stanford partisans, but ihe Stanford
Spirit is in the hearts of all to cheer
them for the bigger game which is to
come.
