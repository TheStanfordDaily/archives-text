After assiduous work upon the part
of the two organizations that will
produce "His Excellency the Gover
nor," and especially by the committee
in charge, the cast has been chosen
for the play. The first production
that will be staged by Sword and San
dals this year, assisted by the Mas
n Hers, an organization of women who
o.re prominent in college theatricals,
is a comedy in three acta, written by
the well known playwright H. Mar
shall. This will be the first time that
this play has ever been put upon the
boards in this vicinity. The cast that
is announced and the capable coach
who has been obtained will insure
an unparalleled success. The date
lias been set for Saturday, December
r>, on the night following the Sopho
more cotillion.
For almost three weeks rehearsing
lias been going on steadily under the
direction of Coach Frank Mathieu.
His services are valuable as he has
attained an enviable reputation, es
pecially in the vicinity of San Fran
cisco, in coaching and staging plays.
The scenery to be used in the pro
duction will be entirely new, orders
for the construction of original drops

building up the scenes.

parts in college productions or have
