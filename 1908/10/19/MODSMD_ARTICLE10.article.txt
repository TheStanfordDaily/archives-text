It is to be hoped that the prospec
tive contest lor a prize to promote
orations on the subject of universal
peace will receive the favorable con
sideration of those with whom the
determination of tlui details of the
competition lie. The world's gains to
be derived from universal peace are
so great and so varied as to defy ac
curate estimation. It follows that
study and oration of the general topic
and the means of realization should
be fostered. Such a competition be
tween the universities would without
doubt come best du-ing the fall, as
has been planned. All that remains
to found the contest is the consent of
the committee of the University of
California and the arrangement of the
minor conditions. As the possibility
of an increase, by the generous donor
of the award, in the amount of the
prize has been authoritatively stated,
it, is desirable that a favorable agree
ment on this proposition be reached
at an early moment.
