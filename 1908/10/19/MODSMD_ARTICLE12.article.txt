### 
Bishop Hughes of the Methodist
Episcopal Church preached an elo
quent sermon to a large congregation
in the Chapel yesterday morning. So
many people were p esent that those
who came late were unable to gain
admittance. A male quartet rendered
"Lead Kindly Light." n such a pleas
ing manner.
The text chosen i'oi (he sermon was
the fifth commandim nt. The Bishop
saiil that sentimental logic would not
carry weight with a college audience,
1 though logical sentiment would. For
that reason (lie Bish >p gave his rea
son for preaching on the topic he had
chosen. He said ilit. the thought an
almost universal feeling among stu
dents who were leaving home for tlvi
first, time was that t'tey were getting
away from parental control. He then
developed the propo lition that the
student's decisions as. he grows old • •
and becomes maturer, more and more
parallel those of the parents if the
student's development has been along
the right lines. Bisliop Hughes said
that the presence of a great majority
of the students in this University
means sacrifice of the parents at
home. In his opinion one hears a
great deal more of the mother's sac
rifice than of the father's. This fact
lead to the remark of an Indiana
newspaper man: "Nobody never hears
nothing about the man who paid for
"the bread that mother used to make."
In conclusion, Bishop Hughes stated
that for all these sacrifices the so'i
and daughter can du nothing better
than so to live their lives that they
will reflect honor upon Themselves anO
their parents.
