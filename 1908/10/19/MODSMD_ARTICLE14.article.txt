## CAPITALIST TO REWARD BEST PEACE ORATOR. Desires Intercollegiate Forensic Contest on "World Peace"â€”$100 for Winner. 
### 
It' the plan which the Stanford in
tercollegiate debating committee, com
posed of D. C. Hoyd, '08, L. Craven,
'09, and J. E. Shelto.i, '10, will place
before the University of California's
debating committee .11 the near fu
ture is acceptable to the latter, a new
contest in forensics between the two
universities will be instituted. Un
like the regular intercollegiate and
Carnot debates, this contest will be
purely oratorical in character and
will be held yearly through the gen
erosity of James Mills, a wealthy
Riverside capitalist.
Mr. Mills, who is one of the moving
spirits of the international peace
movement, is desirous of having the
two universities discuss this great
movement in an annual oratorical
contest. He has offered a prize of
over one hundred dollars as the award
to each successive winner of the con
test. He desires that the orators
speak in favor of a world peace and
especially show that the disarmament
of the nations is practicable and feas
ible in a discussion of the means to
that end.
The Stanford debating committee
is enthusiastic over the offer and is
in hopes that it will receive favor in
California's eyes. The need of an in
tercollegiate oratorical contest in
which practice in the preparation
and delivery of set speeches as well
as extemporaneous efforts can be se
cured has long been felt by the Stan
ford literary societies. It is believed
that the Mills Peace Oratorical Con
test will supply this want.
