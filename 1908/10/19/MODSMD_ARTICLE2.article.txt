# RENO TRIP THIS WEEK
## VARSITY WILL PLAY NEVADA ON LATTER'S CAMPUS. Nine Freshmen to Remain on Rugby Squad.â€”Training Table Commenced for Cardinal Team. 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity and probably
five substitutes, together with Man
ager Stewart and Coc.ch Presley, will
make their only trip away from the
campus before the intercollegiate
game, next Thursday afternoon in
stead of the followii g week as orig
inally scheduled. Their destination
is Reno, where they will meet the
University of Nevada fifteen on Satur
day, returning to the campus on Sun
day. The Nevada team is a strong ag
gregation, having defeated the Olym
pics 3to 0, and although the Varsity
should have little trouble in gaining
the victory, an exceedingly one-sided
match is not likely to result. Nevada
will play a return game on Stanford
Field the following Saturday.
Nine of the fifteen members of the
Freshman team have been requested
to remain on the Varsity squad for
the remainder of thj season. They
are Corbet, Crandall, Hubbard, Rodg
ers, Erb, T. Sanborn, A. Sanborn, Sun
dell and Brown.
