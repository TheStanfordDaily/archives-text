The Executive Committee of tht
Associated Students, at its meeting
held last Wednesday evening, took ac
tion that may have serious consequen
ces for some members of the student
body. The drastic course to be pur
sued by the committee and the au
thorities of the University is neces
sary to save the Student's Guild fron
being crippled, and possibly from dis
solution. The step taken grew out
of the fact, extremely embarrassing
to the Guild Hoard, that members ol
the student body weve in debt to the
board in the sum of approximately
twenty-five hundred dollars.
It is a pity that tJtie publication oi
the amount of money owed the board,
and the danger that hangs over the
heads of those who wantonly neglect
to pay their bills, should be insuffi
cient to effect a remedy. Hut it seems
that their omissions must be brought
home again to the students who re
ceive but do not pay The resolution
of the Guild Hoard, ratified by the
Executive Committee and sanctioned
by the Student Affa'rs Committee, fol
lows:
"That it be the sense of the Hoard
that registration in the University for
the second semester be refused to all
persons owing hospital bills unless
such bills be paid, or some arrange
ment, satisfactory to the Guild Hoard,
be made in regard to them. The Guild
being a Student Hody institution, the
Hoard asks that, the Executive Com
mittee ratify this action in order that
it may be put into effect."
When the amount of deliberation
that has been given this remedy, and
the number and character of the men
who have passed upon it. are con
sidered, it, should be manifest to
everybody that the action taken is
justifiable in every case in which bills
can be met.
