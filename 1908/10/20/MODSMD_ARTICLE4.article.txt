# CHINESE EDITOR, NG POON CHEW, ADDRESSES THIRD ASSEMBLY
## Pleasing Oriental of San Francisco Tells of China of the Present Day and Its Relations to America. 
### 
One of the most pleasing Assem
blies that has been given in Assembly
Hall for some time was held this
morning when Ng Poon Chew, editor
of a Chinese newspaper in San Fran
cisco, spoke on the interesting sub
ject of "The Twentieth Century China
and its Relation to America." Presi
dent Jordan introduced Ng Poon Chew
as one who has gotten over the race
prejudice and as one of the Chinese
who is doing all he can to make China
an important nation of the twentieth
century. Chew won the applause of
a well filled hall as he stepped out to
speak, and his pleasing manner and
emotional delivery were well received
by the appreciative audience. Chew
was the only speaker and he said in
part as follows:
"One of the greatest features of
America is rapid education. Ameri
can people are the most intelligent
and best informed people in the world.
Yet why should they not. be? Ameri
ca is a nation of schools, institutions
of learning, libraries, literature,
newspapers, and dime novels. Yet
American people have queer notions
about the Chinese. American peo
ple have more pride than is necessary
lor the good of man. Americans call
Italians ' Dagoes', Japanese 'Japs',
Chinese 'Chinks'. To you a China
man is slow, ignorant, and devoid of
emotions.
"Yet. China is the largest nation in
the world with four hundred and fifty
million people. China has had a great
past history, and will have a great
prosperous future. The Chinese do
not excite the American people to
study their conditions. During
China's forty-five centuries of history,
there were forces working both to
degenerate and to build up the coun
try. The forces met and neutralized,
and China passed on as ever. China
is different from a l other nations.
She has lived through all stages of
history and still lives. Nations have
come and gone, yet China still re
mains. China seems to be an excep
tion to the rule —it is today, was yes
terday and may be tomorrow. Like
a cube, no matter how you strike it,
it always remains the same."
Chew then told how the Chinese
wall of exclusion against foreigners
had been knocked down, and how the
Chinese then scattered to all parts
of the globe. In bringing these phas
es in his talk in regaui to John China
man to a close, he said "Wherever you
go you will always find Johnny on
the spot." Continuing he said. "Re
gardless of the constant knocking on
the door China still slept. That day
is now passed. Let. no nation say
that China still sleeps."
In regard to the so-called "Yellow-
Peril", he said: "I contend that there
is not, and never will be a yellow
peril, but If there is one it will be be
cause it. is fostered by the western
nations themselves. China is a place
of peace and the people are peaceful.
China regards militarism as the relic
of barbarous nations and uncultured
men. We pride ourselves on this. The

nations today regard no right but
might. The size of a nation's right is
like the might of the big stick. A
nation is not measured by its right
eousness, its schools, intelligence; it
is measured by the number of men
it can kill on the ba f tle field with the
least time and expense.
"The greatest crime of the nine
teenth century was the importation of
opium into China by England. China
has tried to get rid of this crime,
which is sapping the vitality of the
nation. England sent a commission
to China to investigate the danger ot
opium, but they reported it was not
harmful there. The Emperor of
China had to sign the act legalizing
the importation of opium into China.
There is one nation that has in all
dealings with China always acted fair.
This nation which has earned the
everlasting gratitude of China is that
which is representee by the Star
Snanuled Banner."

speak, and his pleasing manner and
emotional delivery were well received
by the appreciative audience. Chew
was the only speaker and he said in
part as follows:
"One of the greatest features of
America is rapid education. Ameri
can people are the most intelligent
and best informed people in the world.
Yet why should they not. be? Ameri
ca is a nation of schools, institutions
of learning, libraries, literature,
newspapers, and dime novels. Yet
American people have queer notions
about the Chinese. American peo
ple have more pride than is necessary
lor the good of man. Americans call
Italians ' Dagoes', Japanese 'Japs',
Chinese 'Chinks'. To you a China
man is slow, ignorant, and devoid of
emotions.
"Yet. China is the largest nation in
the world with four hundred and fifty
million people. China has had a great
past history, and will have a great
prosperous future. The Chinese do
not excite the American people to
study their conditions. During
China's forty-five centuries of history,
there were forces working both to
degenerate and to build up the coun
try. The forces met and neutralized,
and China passed on as ever. China
is different from a l other nations.
She has lived through all stages of
history and still lives. Nations have
come and gone, yet China still re
mains. China seems to be an excep
tion to the rule —it is today, was yes
terday and may be tomorrow. Like
a cube, no matter how you strike it,
it always remains the same."
Chew then told how the Chinese
wall of exclusion against foreigners
had been knocked down, and how the
Chinese then scattered to all parts
of the globe. In bringing these phas
es in his talk in regaui to John China
man to a close, he said "Wherever you
go you will always find Johnny on
the spot." Continuing he said. "Re
gardless of the constant knocking on
the door China still slept. That day
is now passed. Let. no nation say
that China still sleeps."
In regard to the so-called "Yellow-
Peril", he said: "I contend that there
is not, and never will be a yellow
peril, but If there is one it will be be
cause it. is fostered by the western
nations themselves. China is a place
of peace and the people are peaceful.
China regards militarism as the relic
of barbarous nations and uncultured
men. We pride ourselves on this. The

nations today regard no right but
might. The size of a nation's right is
like the might of the big stick. A
nation is not measured by its right
eousness, its schools, intelligence; it
is measured by the number of men
it can kill on the ba f tle field with the
least time and expense.
"The greatest crime of the nine
teenth century was the importation of
opium into China by England. China
has tried to get rid of this crime,
which is sapping the vitality of the
nation. England sent a commission
to China to investigate the danger ot
opium, but they reported it was not
harmful there. The Emperor of
China had to sign the act legalizing
the importation of opium into China.
There is one nation that has in all
dealings with China always acted fair.
This nation which has earned the
everlasting gratitude of China is that
which is representee by the Star
Snanuled Banner."
One of the most pleasing Assem
blies that has been given in Assembly
Hall for some time was held this
morning when Ng Poon Chew, editor
of a Chinese newspaper in San Fran
cisco, spoke on the interesting sub
ject of "The Twentieth Century China
and its Relation to America." Presi
dent Jordan introduced Ng Poon Chew
as one who has gotten over the race
prejudice and as one of the Chinese
who is doing all he can to make China
an important nation of the twentieth
century. Chew won the applause of
a well filled hall as he stepped out to
speak, and his pleasing manner and
emotional delivery were well received
by the appreciative audience. Chew
