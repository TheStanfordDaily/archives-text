# TO GIVE SHOW INDOORS
## JUNIORS TO STAGE PLUG UGLY IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Class Sweaters Voted to Members of the 1912 Championship Rugby Team. 
### 
At a special meeting of the Junior
Class today it was decided to hold
the Plug Ugly show set for Novem
ber (>, in Assembly Hall. The com
mittee was authorized to proceed with
the preparations for staging the pro
duction in accordance with this de
cision. This motion was adopted af
ter a very thorough discussion of the
whole question of where the show
should be produced, .he subject being
introduced at the instance of the com
mittee in order that the ultimate de
cision might unques ionably be that
representing the majority of the class.
The impracticability of staging any
sort of a Plug Ugly on the old base
ball diamond, where scenic and light
ing effects would be impossible, and
the fact that the great distance from
stage to audience would not admit
those present to hear any appreciable
part of the production, were the two
reasons which influenced the decision
to hold the affair indoors.
It is not the intention to change
the character of the show, but merely
to give the audience which pays ad
mission a chance to bear some of the
local hits and songs which abound
in the piece. The absence of suitable
or even practicable accommodations
prevent the attempt to do this on the
outside.

Quad, made a report showing that
only about one-fifth of the members
of the class have as yet paid the as
sessment of three dollars levied for
the publication of the class annual,
and urged the necessity of paying
this amount immediately as all the
Junior pictures to be published must
be taken before the end of the present
semester.

members of the 1910 Rugby team
which won the interclass series by
