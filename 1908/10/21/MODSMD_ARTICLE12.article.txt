The party of Stanford athletes that
will leave the campus tomorrow will
go forth with the best wishes of the
University for an enjoyable and suc

tance. A good hard game may be ex
pected from Nevada The Stanford
team will go into the contest with the
knowledge that the whole University
is behind them as ever, anxiously
awaiting the news of their struggle.
