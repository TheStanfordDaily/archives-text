# AUTHOR SEEKS FIELD ASSISTANT
## Edward S. Curtis, Specialist on the North American Indian, Wants Man for Southwest. 
### 
Edward S. Curtis, author and pub
lisher or the "Nort\i American In
dian", a work to be completed in 20
volumes, is searching for an assist
ant. to do field work in the Southwest.
The qualifications are outlined by
Curtis, as follows:
"His field of operation will be the
Southwest. One necessary require
ment will be a knowledge of Spanish,
which could easily oe twisted into
Mexican, and what I would want him
to do would be to settle down in Ari
zona or New Mexico .'or two or three
years' steady digging for lore and
logic of the tribes of that region. It
is a mighty hard country for any man
to work in and get results. He has
to turn himself inU a semi-private
detective and work in a quiet but
very persistent way. I thought it
barely possible that your institution
had lately turned out a man who
might do this work. If such is the
case, I should like to correspond with
him. There is no end of men coming
from Eastern colleges who would
think themselves equipped to do this
work and who would be only too glad
to take it up; but I prefer a man from
the West, if I can find him. 1 took on
a new man from the University of
Washington this yeai who is making
good. He will devote the next, two
years wholly to the North Coast, re
gion of Washington and Oregon."
Information in regard to the posi
tion may be secured by applying to
Instructor W. K. Fisher, room 441,
any afternoon during the week.
