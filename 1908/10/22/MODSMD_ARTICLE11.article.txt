The cordiality and feeling of justice
that certainly prompted the letter re
ceived by Manager Stewart from Man
ager Ralph Merritt of the University
of California goes a long way in re
paration of a statement that was at
best unfortunate. The letter is un
mistakable in its assurance that no
such feelings as those for which an
apology has been offered are har
bored by the students of California or
their representatives. This statement
although the contrary was not enter
tained in the minds of any Stanford
people, is very gratifying. It shows
an admirable spirit and one that
should always exist between tiie two
universities. For the lair and manly
action of Manager Merritt, it is hardly
going too far to say that the executive
committee of the Blue and Gold may
expect a cordial acknowledgement and
acceptance of the apology so gener
ously tendered.
