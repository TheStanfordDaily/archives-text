Before an appreciative audience, J.
U. Hayley, '<)!), last evening delivered
an interesting lecturt in room 214 on
Australia and New Zealand, Hayley,
the president oL' the Cosmopolitan
Club, at an open meeting of which he
lectured, is a native of the country he
described.
From the discovery of Australia in
the middle of the eighteenth century
and the beginning o! its colonization
a few years later in 1788, he traced
its progress until Uie present day
and showed how the development of
the marvellous resources of the con
tinent had been hindered by nature
and the cupidity of man.
"Australia," said the lecturer, "with
a territory equal to that of the United
States exclusive of Canada, and a
comparatively small population, lacks
only a constant water supply to make
it an agricultural paradi e. Not that
the rainfall is slight, for in some
parts it. is extremely heavy, but the
soil is very porous and will not re
tain moisture. The remarkable
growth of plant life in this part of the
world is well shown by the groves of
gigantic trees which would tower
head and shoulders above the famous
Sequoias. Some of these trees reach
the enormous height of 100 feet, not
branching out till over 150 feet from
the ground."
With the aid of stereoptican views
the audience was led through the
most interesting parts of both Aus
tralia and Xew Zealand. One thing es
pecially noticeable was the startling
contrast, their clean, well-ordered
cities offer to our haphazard ones.
Hayley spoke entertainingly of the
New Zealand scenery, saying that in
the islands, about equal in size to
Oregon, every kind of scenery is
found, from geysers and hot springs
in the north to glaciers and fiords,
rivalling those of Norway, in the
south.
In conclusion, Hayley particularly
impressed upon his auditors the pos
sibilities of both Dominions, saying
that the tide of European emigration
would soon turn from the United
States and then Australia would come
in for her fair portion which would
supply the need, now sadly felt, of
white labor.
After the lecture, a short business
meeting, in which some routine bus
iness was transacted, was held by the
club.
