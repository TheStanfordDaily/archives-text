The fact that over eighty men have
signified their intention to enter the
tournament to be held in the near
future by tlie Tennis Club brings to
notice the woeful lack of courts at the
University. Besides the three courts
at Encina Hall, nearly all the other
courts will be desired for the tourna
ment. This means Oiat the grounds
of the various fraternities and of the
Faculty will probably be in request.
Great as are the improvements that
continually are being made in ath

student participate in athletics, ten
nis can not but play an important
part. It is a game at which a couple
of hours can be spent each day, yield
ing pleasant recreation to a high de
gree. For this reason, the new courts
should be as near the dwellings of the
students who will u\e them most as
they can be built with convenience.
