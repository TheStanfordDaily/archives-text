# WILL RETAIN STUNTS
## YELL LEADERS' ARRANGEMENT COMMITTEE ACTS. Stanford to Have Bleacher Novelties as Accompaniment to Big Game This Year. 
### 
The stunts that been a char
acteristic feature of t/ie varsity inter
collegiate football game between
Stanford and California for many
years will not be abolished by Stan
ford. The yell-leaders' arrangement
committee has finally decided that the
Stanford rooters will continue to par
ticipate in the original stunts that
now mark every game with distinctive
individuality.
R. Fitch and L. Lewis, the present
yell-leaders of the University of Cal
ifornia, have announced that all
stunts will be abolished by that uni
versity, including in this statement
the use of toy balloons, pigeons, con
fetti and bombs that have been pop
ular during the past few years. The
money that would have been expended
upon such practices is to be used in
be used in the betterment of the foot
ball equipment, while the time taken
up in perfecting the songs and
the learning of the .iiew events will
be used in perfecting the songs and
yells that California now has. All
energies are to be concentrated upon
the rooting and upon the effort to se
cure new songs and yells.
At a consultation between associ
ate yell-leader G. N. Richardson, '09,
and California's yell-leader, R. Fitch,
'09, the use of stunts this year was
discussed, but the action of the yell
leaders' committee, that has such mat
ters in its charge, insures the contin
uance of the custom, that has proved
so successful in its operation.
