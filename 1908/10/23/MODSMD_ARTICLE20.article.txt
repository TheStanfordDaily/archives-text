# SENIOR WOMEN TO GO ON JAUNT.
## Will Endeavor to Have All Girls of the Class Participate in an Evening Picnic. 
### 
A committee of Senior women, coni
sisting of Miss M. Browne, Miss B.
Maine, Miss F. Forbes, Miss E. Davis,
and Miss Blodgett, met this after
noon to plan some entertainment to
be given for the women of the class.
They decided to give a supper picnic
on the evening of Wednesday, No
vember 11, at Frenchman's Dam at
5:30 o'clock. A list has been posted
in the Rest Room and all who wish to
sign-up to go, must 'lo so before No
vember 6. As the purpose of this is
to enable the Senior women to become
better acquainted, it is hoped by the
committee that a large majority of the
class will be able to attend. In case
the weather is unfavorable, the pic
nic will be held indoors. An assess
ment of fifty cents a head will be
necessary to cover expenses and will
be collected as follows: Delta Gamma,
Kappa Kappa Gamma — Miss M.
Browne; Roble — Miss B. Maine; Palo
Alto — Miss E. Davis ; Pi Beta Phi,
Madrono, Manteista, Mrs. Hurd's
Miss R. Blodgett; Alpha Phi, Gamma
Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta — Miss F.
Forbes. The commuters and all others
not provided for will leave the money
with Miss M. Graham in the Rest
Room.
