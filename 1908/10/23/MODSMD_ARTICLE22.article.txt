Regular practice in basketball will
commence Monday at 4:30 o'clock, at
Roble courts. For the last few weeks
practice has been held regularly with

not played previously, and the coaches
feel very much encouraged by the
amount of good new material. Much
more interest in tin class games,
which are scheduled for this semester,
will be shown than has been the case
for the last few years. Practice
games will also be held with schools
near by. Any girl interested is urged
