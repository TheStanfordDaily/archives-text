### 
H. A. Moran, ex-'O5, the first
Rhodes scholar from Stanford,
preached yesterday morning in the
First Presbyterian Church of Palo
Alto, lie took for his text John 1.9:
"That was the true light which light
eth every man that cometh into the
world."
Moran showed that there must be
a dual conception of Christ, that lie
should be thought of not only us a
historical character but as a spiritual
being forming part of the Trinity.
He went on to censure the tendency
on the part of some to condemn those
who had never heard of our Christ,
because, said he, they were sincere
in their belief; and their prayers
would be answered by the true God
although they have not our concep
tion.
The Rhodes scholar then brought
out a very interesting similarity be
tween the primitive religion of the
Persians and the Christian religion.
They had, said he, a belief in an in
finite God who would be manifested
in His Son and they also had baptisms,
communions and many other resem
blances to Christianity. In the speak
er's opinion this anc'ent religion was
a work of God in preparation for the
coming of Christ.
In conclusion the former Stanford
man made clear his own attitude by
saying that he intended to go to China
and teach her people a belief in one
great spiritual God and try to give
them a fuller knowledge of our own
spiritual Christianity.
