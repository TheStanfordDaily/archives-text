The Daily Palo Alto has received a
communication disapproving ot' the
method of selection of the manu
scripts for the Junior Plug Ugly ex
travaganza. The complaint of the
writer seems to be that manuscripts
which are submitted in competition
were partly used in combination by
the committee without notice being
given to the authors.
The writer makes a good point in
recommending that there be an under
standing that the competitions for the
Senior farce and Junior opera will
not be conducted in this manner. The
force of the contention is that if man
uscripts are to be combined, the au
thors should l>e inf( rmed. In most
competitions of this kind, manuscripts
have been rejected absolutely or ac
cepted with but few changes. In or
der that the number of compositions
submitted should not fall off in any
future contest, it should be definitely
understood that ii. dividual manu
scripts will stand or fall on their own
merits, or else that they will not be
materially changed without the sanc
tion of the authors.
