As a result, of the try-out meet held
Saturday morning, Captain Horton
J has decided to enter a full team ot
j fifteen men in the annual handicap
meet of the Pacific Athletic Associa
| toin, to be held in Oakland next Sat
| urday. The entry blanks of the men
selected will be immediately for
warded to the ollicia's of the associa
tion so that the ha adicaps may be
awarded. Although the try-outs failed
to develop any spectacular perform
ances, the general showing was good
for such a limited amount of train
ing. With fair handicaps some of the
Stanford athletes should show up
well in the P. A. A. meet.
The men selected to represent Stan
ford on the team are, H. L. Horton,
'08, C. S. Morris, '08, E. A. McGregor,
'08, 15. L. Gregg, '09, E. O. Billwiller,
'09, W H. Rawles, '09, J P. Hemphill,
'09, H. V. Poor, '10, A. Johnson, '10,
M. P. Youker, '10, E. C. Templeton,
10, G. Bevier, '11, C. A. Waring, '11,
T. D. Meddick, '11, W. H. Cliue, '11.
Captain Horton wishes to empha
size the fact that each one of these
men must be on the track for training
every afternoon this week and strict,
training rules must be enforced. The
cinder path is in very good condition
land will admit of ha?d training with
j out injury to the miners. "Dad"
says that the men are in good con
dition for fall training, but lie is de
| sirous of having the men on the team
improve their present form before
Saturday's meet.
