# FAMOUS MAN SPEAKS
## DESMOND FITZGERALD TALKS TO ENGINEERS. Man Connected With Many Enterprises Gives General Information to a Large Audience. 
### 
Desmond Fitzgerald, past president
of the American Society of Civil En
gineers, addressed a large number of
students of the engineering depart
ments this afternoon. The speaker
is one of the best known experts upon
water supply systems and in the
course of his address gave many val
uable bits of inforn ation upon this
subject and other branches of civil
engineering practice. The noted en
gineer has been engaged recently in
ihe investigation of the 1 letch lietchy
water supply system which is pro
posed for San Francisco. He is also
collecting data for the City of Boston
with the idea of improving docking
facilities at that port.
Fitzgerald compared the rain fall
in the Easi, with that of the West and
brought out many interesting facts in
this connection. The"run off" of this
rain fall was discussed at some length.
In the East it. has been found by in
vestigation covering a long period of
years, that the streams and rivers
carry off about one-half of the average
annual rain fall. This amount is
very evenly distributed throughout
the year, the snow in winters and the
rain during the summer. But on the
coast conditions are entirely differ
ent. Rains, coming at only one sea
son of the year, present many more
problems to the hydraulic engineer.
Fitzgerald laid great stress on the
necessity of every engineer being well
grounded in his work.
