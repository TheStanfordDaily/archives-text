# Freshman Class Will Meet Tomorrow.
## 
### 
At the Freshman Class meeting
tomorrow several important questions
will come up for discussion. Com
mittees will be appointed to carry out
the work of building the bonfire for
the night of the varsity Rugby rally,
and also to arrange for a Freshman
dance.
The Committee on Student Affairs
has sanctioned the giving of such a
dance, provided that it is not too elab
orate, and that it, include only the
members of the 1912 class.
