# NEVADA FIFTEEN LOSE
## CARDINAL VARSITY DEFEATS BLUE WHITE 14 TO 0. Stanford's Offense Has Difficult Task in Overcoming Nevada's Defense. 
### 
On a strange field, in a high alti
tude, and with a hand-full ot' support
ers on the bleachers, the crippled Car
dinal Varsity fifteen downed its op
ponents of t lie University of .Nevada
last Saturday 14 to 0. Although
powerless on offense, the Nevadans
were desperate in their determination
to withstand the various rushes of the
Cardinal, and even though partly suc
cessful, they made a brave light. The
Stanford men outweighed their rivals,
especially in the backfleld, but the
three-quarters of the Blue and
White put an end to many a Stanford
passing rally. The absence of Scott,
Ganong and Cadwalader was, of
course, a hindrance to the Cardinal's
scoring ability, but the substitutes,
and especially Five-eighths Roth, did
excellent work.
Stanford was affected scarcely at
all by the high altitude of Reno, but
the plentiful dust of Mackay Field, in
contrast to the accustomed turf, in
terfered to a large extent with their
speed and endurance. Notwithstand
ing, the team played a moderately
good game, although in the second
half they exhibited little ability in
advancing the ball.
The Nevada fifteen is a splendid
aggregation of plucky fighters who
play a clean and spirited game. Out
classed at every turn of the offense,
they tried to offset this deficiency by
sheer determination, and after half
time they were ratliei successful, only
3 of the 14 points being registered
after the interval. Coach Mayers has
taught his limited material all that
was possible in the short time avail
able, while the condition of the Ne
vadans, which has been in the care of
C. K. Badger, ex-'ll, was fully equal
to that of the Cardinal.
Both of the first two tries were
made by Front-ranker Terrill after
effective dribbling rushes. A strong
wind prevented Captain Crawford
from converting either one. The
third tally was registered when Drew
secured on the wing and dashed over
the line, the goal this time being
kicked by Crawford. The only try of
the second half was made by Hoi man
towards the middle of the period. Hol
man had been showing occasional
flashes of remarkable speed, but had
not as yet been able to get clear of
all his opponents. On this attempt,
however, he eluded all and covered
the 40 yards to the line. Crawford
again failed to convert.
At the opening of the second period,
Brown replaced Jordan at full, and
during the progress of the half Rey
nolds was substituted for Miller, Hig
ley for Terrill, and Elliott for Erb.

Stanford —Koerner, Terrill, Cheda,
Pemberton, Crawford, Miller, Evans,
