# Freshman Debaters Choose Negative.
## 
### 
The freshman debating team yes
terday definitely decided to uphold
the negative side of the question
which had been previously submitted
by the 1911 debaters. The question
deals with the banking system of the
country and reads as follows:
' Resolved, That a consolidated na
tional bank should be established in
the United States, with branches in
the larger commercial cities; which
bank shall be the fir cal agent of the
government and shall have sole power
to issue bank notes â€”general super
vision by the government being con
ceded."
The plan for which the affirmative
will contend is based on economic
principles and its practicability will
doubtless offer opportunity for ex
tensive research and argument on
both sides. The Sophomores, as the
proponents of the new banking sys
tem, will be given four minutes for
a rebuttal speech.
