## 
### 
Due to the fact that, several men
of the team which was picked to com
pete in the P. A. A.track meet in
Oakland Saturday are on the proba
tion list, the Committee on Delinquent
Scholarship has sent letters to three
of the most promising of the athletes.
The letters simply call the attention
of the students to the fact that they
are on probation and that, they are
warned against competition. The men
have decided to withdraw from the
meet, and their absence from the
contest will materially weaken the
team that, was chosen.
