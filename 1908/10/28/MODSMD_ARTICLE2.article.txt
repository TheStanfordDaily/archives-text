# WILL ENTERTAIN NORTHERNERS.
## Executive Committee Provides for the Accommodation of Vancouver Rugby Players. 
### 
A special session of the Executive
Committee was helri last night and a
number of important matters dis
cussed, but definite action on them
was postponed until the next meeting
of the committee.
President Roth was authorized to
appoint an entertainment committee
of five members to provide for the
accommodation and entertainment of
the Vancouver Rugby players who
will arrive on the campus next week.
The personnel of this committee has
not yet been announced. It will have
the cooperation of Coach Presley and
Captain Crawford. While no definite
arrangements have been made, one
evening will probably be devoted to a
"jinks" in Encina Hall, such as has
been tendered the northerners on their
past visits to the campus.
