# TO START TOURNAMENT
## FIRST ROUND OF HANDICAP TENNIS ON SATURDAY. Committee Makes Rules and Arranges Drawings for a Large Entry List. 
### 
The tennis committee met last night
and held the drawings for the tourna
ment. The lower class men, below
"15", were all drawn into the "lower
half" so that one of them will be
sure to annex a prize. The varsity
men were more severely handicapped
than ever before, but no Freshmen
were placed above scratch. Over
forty original entries were not veri
fied and so were omitted, as the men
were unable to play on account of
lack of time, of equipment, or of
good physical condition. The commit
tee made rules as fellows:
(1) "First Round" matches will be
started at 8:30 Saturday, unless mu
tually arranged to be played
any time before Monday. New balls
to be secured from H. Mann, '10,
room 42 Encina, or L. B. Mackey, '10,
11 Lasuen street, and courts reserved.
(2) "Second Round" matches to be
completed by Saturday, November 7;
can be arranged mutually at any time
except that first round matches have
precedence on the courts on Saturday.
(.3) Students drawn with faculty
men should arrange with them to
play at the faculty grounds.
(4) In arranging matches, men
should agree upon an umpire unless
both should agree to dispense with
one.
(5) Any balls lost must be replaced
by the players, as it is only by the
greatest care that this tournament
can be run through with the low en
trance fee and the scarcity of balls.
(6) No deuce sets: six games win
the set; best two of three sets win
Balls should be secured from and
returned to H. Mann, 10, room 42
Encina, or L. B. Mackey, '10, 11 La
suen street, who will also explain the
handicaps when needed. Spaulding's
1908 Tennis Annual gives all the in
formation needed on handicaps. All
entrance fees must be paid before
playing. Defaults will be scored Sat
urday night against those who have
neither paid their fees nor arranged
their matches. L. B. Mackey will
make reservations for the courts on
the Row, and H. Mann will list the
games for the Encina courts. The
drawings follow:
