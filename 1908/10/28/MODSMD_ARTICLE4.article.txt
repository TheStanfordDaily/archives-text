# KOERNER BADLY HURT
## WILL BE UNABLE TO PLAY FOR AT LEAST TEN DAYS. Ex-Captain Sprains Ankle in Practice Game.â€”Varsity Wins From Subs 29 to 0. 
### 
The succession of serious injuries
which have fallen to the lot of many
of the most valuable men on the Rug
by squad still continues to pursue the
varsity players, for in a short practice
line-up yesterday afternoon ex-Cap
tain Koerner, '08, s iffered a severe
sprain to his ankle which will prob
ably incapacitate him for at least ten
days.
This will allow him to again appear
on the field only one week previous
to the intercollegiate contest with Cal
ifornia on November 14, by which
date Koerner hopes to be in perfect
shape. Koerner is perhaps the most
reliable man in the scrum, and the
loss of him in the front rank would
be an irreparable blow to the attack
of the entire fifteen.
At Tuesday's practice the Varsity
faced the second team in two short
halves, the substitutes being scored
on several times. C.-awford success
fully converted in four instances,
leaving the final tally 29 to 0. The
backfield was responsible for the
great majority of the scoring, Mitchell
doing some particularly brilliant
work. For the first time in over a
fortnight Ganong resumed his old po
sition at second five. The line-up of
the Varsity as it appeared yesterday
follows:
Koerner, Terrill. Cheda, Pemberton,
Crawford, Miller, Evans, forwards;
Heinly, wing forward; Erb, half;
Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Cook, center;
Holman, Roth, wings; Faulkner, full.
Twenty-three members of the Var
sity squad together with Coach Pres
ley, Trainer Moulton and Manager
Stewart left Palo Alto on the 12:02
train this afternoon for Berkeley,
where they will witness the first Rug
by game between the Blue and Gold
fifteen and the Vancouver team.
