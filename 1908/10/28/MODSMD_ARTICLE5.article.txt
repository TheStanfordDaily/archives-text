# Women's Conference Decides Seating.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Women's Presi
dent's Conference, held at Dr. Jordan's
residence last evening, a systematic
plan for seating the women in Uni
versity Assemblies was decided upon.
Several years ago the Seniors es
tablished the precedent of sitting in
the center of the balcony of Assembly
Hall. The present plan is to have
them keep their old section, to have
the Juniors seated on either side of
the Seniors, the Sophomores on either
side of the Juniors, and the Freshmen
on the ends.
The object of this arrangement is to
have the classes instead of the dif
ferent places of residence, the units
of division, and to promote aquain
tance among the women.
