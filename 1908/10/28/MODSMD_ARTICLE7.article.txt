# TO HOLD SEAT LOTTERY
## NEW PLAN TO BE FOLLOWED FOR ROOTERS TICKETS. System Similar to That in Vogue at Harvard.â€” Will Eliminate Speculation. 
### 
Tickets for the rooters at the var
sity intercollegiate Rugby game will
lie sold upon a system this year which
differs materially froxn any attempted
before. The plan adopted accords
closely with that followed at Harvard.
Under the new plan the tickets will
be disposed of upon a lottery basis
and in lots of ten as a maximum. In
tending depositors will make their
deposits stating the number of tickets
desired and will then draw from the
lottery. In case the purchasers de
sire less than ten tickets the desired
seats can be taken from the package
and the broken package properly la
beled will be returned to a separate
grab bag.
All seats in the package are con
secutive and in the same rows. Those
desiring more than ten seats will have
to secure the desired seats from other
purchasers after the drawing.
This plan of sale has been adopted
to do away with speculation upon the
part of undergraduates and outsiders.
As no tickets are returnable the
chance of obtaining tickets less de
sirable than others will make "scalp
ers" hesitate to operate.
The sale of the seats will probably
begin the last of this week or the
first of next, depending upon the ar
rival of tickets from Berkeley.
