# VANCOUVER TEAM FAST
## NORTHERN FIFTEEN AS STRONG AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS Tics Blue and Gold on California Field 3 to 3.â€”Nevada Rugby Squad Leases Reno. 
### 
The Rugby contest, between the Van
couver and Blue and Gold fifteens on
California Field yesterday afternoon,
which ended in a 3 to 3 tie, developed
the fact that the Northern team is
about on a par with the British Co
lumbian aggregations of previous
years. They have a fast and aggress
ive pack, which, although lighter than
the forward division of either Stan
ford or California, was responsible for
practically all their ground gaining
yesterday. The combination of the
backfield is not exceptional, but
Three-quarter Johnson and Five
eights Ellis stood out as the individual
stars of the backs. Vancouver suc
ceeded in crossing the Blue and Gold
line, while California's tally was made
on a 35-yard kick from placement af
ter a mark. The Northerners rallied
tremendously in the second period,
displaying far greater form than in
the opening half. California played
an aggressive game, forwards and
backs being equally responsible for
her gains. The Blue and Gold team
suffered through the absence of three
of their most valuable backfield men.
The final game between the two fif
teens will be contested on Saturday,
and immediately after that match the
Vancouver squad will leave for Stan
ford.
The Nevadan team and substitutes,
with Coach Mayers and Trainer
Badger left Reno this evening and will
reach the campus tomorrow morning
about 10 o'clock. The game between
the Varsity and Nevada will be played
on Stanford Field Saturday afternoon
at 3:30 o'clock.
At the training house tomorrow af
ternoon the Varsity squad will be
given an opportunity to purchase
seats for the intercollegiate game,
other than those in the rooters' sec
tion. The men on the training table
will be given two complimentaries
each, while the remaining candidates
will receive one each. Tomorrow the
management will give them the first
choice of any extra tickets which they
may desire.
