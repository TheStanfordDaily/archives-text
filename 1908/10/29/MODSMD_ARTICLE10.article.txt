From the opinions of members of
the Rugby squad themselves, it is to
be understood that the attendance at
football practice is poor. The exist
ence of such a condition of affairs
is only another instance of the apathy
which characterizes the student body
in the present athletic season, it' this
lack of spirit continues, Stanford will
have the best chance in the world to
lose the game with the University of
California on November 14.
The fault in the student body is
over-confidence in the ability of the
Stanford team. It may or it may not
be true —none can tell until the final
struggle—that Stanford can turn out
fifteen men in her team this year who
will be better than the fifteen who
will represent the University of Cali
fornia. But if the foolhardy careless
ness, regarding the result, that now
manifests itself in almost every Rugby
conversation continues, it can not but
have an effect on the feeling of the
team regarding their chances for vic
tory. This effect will be to lessen the
chances of Stanford, notwithstanding
the fact that at present the players
are deeply impressed with the
strength of the Berkeley aggregation.
The members of the squad, having
seen the British Columbia team lie
unable yesterday to defeat California,
returned to the campus last, evening
with the knowledge that they will
have to fight every inch of the way in
order to best California. The mem
bers of the squad know.
The time before the big game is
short. Only two weeks from Satur
day remain before the great contest.
One member of the team is already
laid up, and more may be injured ser
iously on. any day. It is for the stu
dent. body to realize (hat in this time.

overconfidence must be killed as a
treacherous snake, th.it will prove the
undoing of any man or organization.
With this feeling that Stanford must
do everything in her power to win the
intercollegiate game this year, it lies
in the path of the student body to let
the team know that he student body
knows that Stanford's chances are
only even, and to support the mem
bers of the squad throughout the rest
of the season as well as on the day
of the intercollegiate game.
