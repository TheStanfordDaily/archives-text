# PART OF CAST ATTENDS PLAY.
## "His Excellency the Governor" Witnessed at Valencia by Stanford Thespians. 
### 
As scheduled, the seven leading
characters of the cast of "His Excel
lency the Governor", accompanied by
Stage-Manager P. R. Johnson and Mr.
F. Mathieu, the professional coach
who is assisting in the staging of the
play, attended the Valencia Theater in
San Francisco last e\ening to witness
the interpretation of the same play
by Robert Warwick and company.
The members of the local cast who
made the journey include Miss R. A.
Roberts, '09. Miss A. Wright, '10, Miss
M. T. Howell, '10, G. N. Richardson,
'09, W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, H. W.
Thompson, '10, and T. A. De√üolt, '10.
Mrs. E. W. Allan, the dean of
women, enjoyed the trip with the
party as chaperone. Although the
production was not as finished as it
would have been under the interpre
tation of a company other than a stock
aggregation, and despite the fact that
some of the minor parts were not up
to the standard usually attained by
professional companies, the members
of the party obtained many points and
suggestions that will materially aid
them in the production here on De
cember 5.
