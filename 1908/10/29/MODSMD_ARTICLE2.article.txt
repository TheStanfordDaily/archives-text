# SECOND TEAM PLAYS SATURDAY.
## Game Between Substitutes and Santa Clara Will Be Contested on Latter's Field. 
### 
Probably the only Rugby game
which will be schedi led for the sec
ond team during the present season
will be contested next Saturday, when
the substitute fifteen of the Cardinal
squad will journey 'o Santa Clara,
where they will meet the Santa Clara
College team on the latter's gridiron.
Almost a month ago the Freshmen de
feated the Collegians 14 to 0, but un
der the direction of Coach Howard it
is understood that the latter team has
become much stronger during the past
four weeks. Naturally, the Stanford
second team will be rather weak, as
not only the fifteen Cardinal players
but also several varsity substitutes
will remain on the Campus, that be
ing the date of the Stanford-Nevada
game. Consequently, the match at
Santa Clara should be hard and close.
