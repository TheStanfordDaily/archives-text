In Assembly llall tomorrow even
ing the lirst play of the semester will
be presented under the auspices of the
English Club. The play is George
Bernard Shaw's great satirical eom
edy-drama, "Arms and the Man." Af
ter many weeks of consistent study
and rehearsing under the directorship
of Professor H. D. Gray, of the Eng
lish department, a cast
will be able to present a thoroughly
genuine representation of "Shawism."
No effort has been spared in the pre
paration. The management was for
tunate in procuring the excellent cos
tumes used by the Katherine Grey
company when they presented "Arms
and the Man" in San Francisco re
cently.
The cast was chosen by try-out
from the student body, not being lim
ited to only English Club members.
Professor Gray from the beginning
has been very pleased with the play
ers under his charge. All have had
varied experience in amateur produc
tions, while some have been in pro
fessional theatricals.
Miss A. Ellerbeck, '08, who assumes
the leading female role needs little
introduction to the Stanford public,
having taken principal parts in"The
Two Gentlemen of Verona," "She
Stoops to Conquer," and in "Christo
pher Junior," staged here during the
last four years. It is quite assured
that she will give an adequate por
trayal of the character of Raina.
Miss E. E. Dean as Louka the inde
pendent maid-servant, and Miss M.
Wilson, though not having appeared
here, have been interested in amateur
productions for several years.
R. H. Seward, '12, impersonates
Bluntschli in a romantic, soldierly
style. This is his first appearance
here, as is the case with Lewis, Visel,
and Cohen.
Sergius, in all his military idealism,
is capably likened to the Shaw style
of pedestal-seated heroes by G.F. Mor
gan, '10, who has often acted in dra
matics in the southern part of (he
State.
"Arms and the Man" is a satire,
ridiculing militarism with amusing
scoffing at the pictorial soldier of the
moderns. With Shaw's deepness, ex
ploited in this play, hre entwined two
charming love complexities. Raina,
the daughter of rich Bulgarians who
hold themselves on "high horses,"
affecting the ways of highly civilized
Europe, is betrothed to Sergius, re
cently appointed to an offlcership in
the army which is at war with Servia.
Raina fairly worships her lover, though

more she worships nis uniform and
position. By chance Bluntschli, a
rebel officer, escapes from his enemies
and finds succor by ulimbing the wa
ter pipe to Raina's room. For his
care-free, romantic way, Raina takes
an interest in him, saves his life by
giving him chocolate creams, and aids
his escape.
War over, Sergius and Raina's fath
er, Petkoff, return, proud of their
military distinction. Raina espies
Sergius making love to her vivacious
maid, Louka, who is presumedly en
gaged to the cool tempered, lovely
Nicola. Raina says nothing. Soon
Bluntschli returns to pay his com
pliments, which puts Raina in an aw
ful plight, as neither her father nor
Sergius knew of her aiding the en
emy, Bluntschli, to escape. After
many comical scenes, the climax is
reached when Raina's love changes
to her "chocolate cream soldier."
Sergius then seeks the hand of the
maid-servant.
With its clever plot, the exploit
ation of an ideal and the amusing
bits of comedy and affectation, "Arms
and the Man" cannot but hold the
rapt attention of the audience.
The curtain will rise at 8 o'clock on
the first act which is unusually im
portant, to the understanding of the
play. The University Orchestra will
render the music of the evening, hav
ing been holding special rehearsals
for this purpose during the last few
weeks.
The committee in charge of the pro
duction consists of P. F. Valentine,
'08, Miss A. Ellerbeck, '08, D. H. Ferry,
'OS, H. L. Rixford, '09, and L. S. Wal
bridge, '09, chairman, while the man
aging has been done by G. B. Bush,
