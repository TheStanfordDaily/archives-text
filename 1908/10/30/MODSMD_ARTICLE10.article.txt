# PLAN AUTOMOBILE TRIP
## COMMITTEE WILL ENTERTAIN VANCOUVER PLAYERS. Program for Visiting Rugby Squad Will Include Jinks and Plug Ugly Show. 
### 
President A. E. Roth, '09, of the
Associated Students, has appointed J.
E. Stewart, '08, C. 11. Bradford, '09,
and F. A. Adams, '10, together with
Yell leaders Richardson and John
son, as a committee to arrange for the
entertainment of the Vancouver Rug
by players on their coming visit to
the campus.
In addition to the usual "jinks"
given in honor of the Vancouver
squad, the committee plans to take the
visitors on an all-day automobile trip
to Halfmoon Bay. This depends
wholly on the generosity of student
automobile owners and the entertain
ment committee urgently requests
that all possessors or machines vol
unteer to place them at the service of
the Northerners. In the event that a
sufficient number of automobiles can
lie procured for the purpose mention
ed, the trip to the coast will be made
on Tuesday, which is a University
holiday. The machines, of course,
! would be loaned at the risk of the
Associated Students.
If this trip can be taken, it will un
doubtedly be the most notable event
! in the entertainment of the visitors.
Provided that enough machines can
be secured, it is not at all improb
able that the members of the Varsity
squad and as many others as there
may be room for will be taken. The
movement that has been started to
J obtain the machines has met with un
â–  expected enthusiasm and bids fair to
I culminate successfully. The middle
part, of the day will be required for
i the journey, as it is planned to take
1 luncheon at the coast. The trip itself
is one of great beauty, and offers un
usual opportunity for an automobile
holiday.
The program of entertainment at
present calls for a "jinks" in Encina
Hall on Wednesday evening. A va
riety of "stunts" and other attrac
tions is being prepared for that oc
casion.
On Friday evening the visitors will
be taken to the performance of "Given
the Hook", the 1910 Plug Ugly, in As
sembly Hall. It is thought that this
feature of the program will particu
larly appeal to the Britishers, because
of its unusual character.
