# WILL MEET NEVADA
## VARSITY TO PLAY SAGEBRUSH FIFTEEN TOMORROW. Visitors Comprise Fast Aggregation. Scott and Ganeng Again in Cardinal Line-up. 
### 
At 3:30 tomorrow afternoon on
Stanford Field, the Rugby team of llie
University of Nevada will meet, the
Varsity in the return game of the
series. The Nevadans, accompanied
by Trainer C. K. Badger, ex-'ll, ar
rived on the campus this morning and
will remain here until tomorrow ev
ening, when they will return to Reno.
The team which represents Nevada,
although considerably lighter than the
Varsity, is a set of clean, aggressive
players with a fair knowledge of the
Rugby game and should be able to
put up an extremely spirited contest.
The chief strength of the visiting team
lies in its forward division, which is
composed of fast, heady fighters who
play a hard, consistent game and are
particularly good in following the
ball. The backfield is too light to
play a strong offensive game against
the heavy players on the Cardinal
fifteen but in the contest at Reno last
Saturday the backs displayed much
ability in resisting the attacks of the
Stanford offense.
The Varsity backfield will be
strengthened tomorrow by the reap
pearance of Scott at center and Ga
nong at five. Roth these L.an have
recovered sufficiently from their in
juries to permit of their resuming
their former places in the Cardinal
ranks. Higley will appear at front
rank in place of Koerner, who sus
tained a sprained ankle during a
practice line-up last. Tuesday. Cad
walader will also be unable to play,
owing to injuries from which he has
not, fully recovered. Faulkner will
replace Jordan at. *ull. Otherwise
the line-up will be the same as in the
first contest with Nevada.
Front-ranker Koerner's ankle,
which was at first thought to be ser
iously injured, is improving much
faster than was expected and he will
probably be on the field again the
first of next. week.
T. J. Lafferty of the Pacific Coast.
