Until last night the club was much
larger, but it is the annual custom to
reduce the membership so that with
the smaller aggregation more work
can be accomplished. This year's
club is smaller in number than the
clubs for several years past, but it
has been shown by previous experi

Six of the men who made the club

clubs and the indications are that the
club will be still more successful than
in former years.
