# DEMOLISHING CHURCH
## MEN ATTACK RUIN OF FAMOUS MEMORIAL EDIFICE. Force of Carpenters and Laborers Clears Out Interior and Build Scaffolding. 
### 
Twenty carpenters and laborers un
der the direction ot' Superintendent
of Construction A. J. Bain started the
work of the demolition of Memorial
Church this morning. The carpen
ters engaged themselves all day in
the erection of the scaffolding to be
used in the removal of the art win
dows. The laborer? spent most of
their time in cleaning the interior of
the building of debris and the removal
of the chimes from the damaged
steeple.
A much larger force of men will lie
put to work next week in the actual
tearing down of the stone work. It
cannot be determined at present
whether the entire structure will have
to come down or not. It is the belief
of those in charge however, that sev
eral of the arches are in good con
dition. It is positively known that
the vestry will not have to be re
built.
Superintendent Bain spent the day
in San Francisco in consultation with
the firm of Meyers and Ward, archi
tects, who are drawing the plans for
the new church.
