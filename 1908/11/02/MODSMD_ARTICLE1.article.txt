# NEVADA LOSES AGAIN
## CARDINAL FIFTEEN PLAYING POORLY WINS 26 TO 6. Visitors' Fighting Defense Saves Larger Score.—Ganong and Scott In Line-up. 
### 
The plucky fifteen lrom the Univer
sity of Nevada suffered a second de
feat. at the hands of the Cardinal Vai
sity last, Saturday, when a total of
26 points was rolled up on the visit
ors by the Stanford players. Although
exhibiting less ability in the various
departments of the game than at any
time this season, the Cardinal team
gained such an advantage over its
performance of a week ago by being
on its own field, that the large score
was tallied with but little difficulty.
Nevada was overwhelmingly out
weighed both forward and back, but
never for an instant did the team re
lent in its desperate defense. On the
contrary, as the score became greater,
the fight became harder.
The Cardinal had an off day.. In
the first half the forwards scarcely
held their own ag*.inst their light
opponents, while the backs were only
spasmodically successful in their
passing rallies. Cadwalader was still
out of the line-up, but Ganong and
Scott reappeared.
A passing rush, with Holman on
the extreme end, wau responsible for
the first try, which Crawford con
verted from the side-lines. Scott
made the second ta.ly by securing
from a ruck on the 5 yard line, while
a long and spectacular run by Miller
registered three more points, Craw
ford converting each. The first half
ended 15 to 0.
Almost half of the second period
had elapsed before Heinly and Cook
succeeded in tallying another try,
Crawford missing the goal. A short
but clever dodging run by Mitchell
was the next play which took the
ball across the line, bringing the
score to 21 to 0. A moment later
came a long dribbling rush well down
into Nevada's territory. Crawford
finally receiving the ball and tallying.
Scott converted a difficult, goal.
Faulkner played his first game as
varsity full, and although he had no
chances to tackle in an open field, his
work in other respects was eminently
acceptable. The line-ups follow:
Stanford—Terrill, Higley, Cheda,
Pemberton, Crawford, Miller, Evans,
McGregor, Reynolds, forwards; Hein
ly, wing forward; Erb, Elliott, half;
Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Scott, center;
Holman, Cook, Drew, wings; Faulk
ner, Brown, full.
Nevada—Leavitt, Kemp, Anderson,
Hardy, McKenzie, J. McKenzie, Ben
nett, forwards; E. Bennett, wing for
ward; Kennedy, half; Folsom, Homer,
fives; Lunkey, center; Cashbaugh,
Rossi, wings; Roder, full.
The Nevada squad left the campus
immediately after the game and ar
rived in Reno Sunday morning.
