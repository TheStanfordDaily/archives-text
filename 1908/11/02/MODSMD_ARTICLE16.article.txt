# SARATOGA DIVINE PREACHES.
## Rev. C.W. Merrill Addresses Well Killed Chapel Upon the Text "In the Beginning, God." 
### 
Rev. C. W. Merrill, pastor of the
First Congregational Chtuch, preach
ed at yesterday morning's service in
the Chapel. He chose as his text the
four words, "In the Beginning, God."
The speaker pointed to the text as
perhaps the most wonderful four
words in the English language with
the possible exception of the phrase,
"For God so lived."
Rev Merrill then brought out the
fact that the mere mention of the text
brings us face to face with eternity.
A child, when once asked "What is
eternity?" said (hat it was the life
time of God. This is probably as
simple a definition as can be given.
The Saratoga divine then asked if
a grander or simpler beginning could
be made than, "In the beginning
God." When you know this much you
know all you need to about the past.
