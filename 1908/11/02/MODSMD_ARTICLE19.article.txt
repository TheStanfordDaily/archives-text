# PLAY CLEVERLY ACTED
## SUCCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF "ARMS AND THE MAN." Excellent. Cast Gives Entertaining Performance of Shaw's Famous Comedy-Satire. 
### 
II. H. Seward's admirably finished
impersonation of tlie soldierly lilnnt
schli raised the English Club's pro
duction of George Bernard Shaw's
comedy-satire, "Arms and the Man,"
from the level of the average college
comedy and placed it with the best
things recently offered by the drama
tic talent of Stanford. In Assembly
Hall Friday evening a well-filled
house accorded a hearty greeting to
the piece which was, for the most
part, cleverly acted.
It is a curious play. Shaw con
st rucls a stereotyped love story in a
stereotyped manner only to immedi
ately attack its every phase with his
poignant and amusing satire. The
lines of the piece, especially those
of the third act, portray Shaw's wit
at its best, and thanks to the coaching
of Professor H. D. Gray nothing was
lost through faulty interpretation.
The play, however, had one important
defect, which was the more serious
in the hands of amateurs: situations
were entirely lacking, and there was
but little "business." Only the con
tinuing brilliancy of the lines effect
ively counteracted the absence of ac
tion.

To repeat, Seward's work was the
treat of the evening. Besides read
ing his lines excellently and possess
ing a commanding presence, he
showed an almost professional knowl
edge of stage technique. But al
though Seward was the star, the
strength of his scenes was greatly
increased by the fetching Raina of
Miss A Ellerbeck, '08, opposite whom
he played. Miss Eilerbeck's naive
charm, together with her innate dra
matic intelligence, made her Ilaina
in every way the equal of her Julia
in "Two Gentlemen of Verona."
Probably the most difficult role in
the piece is that of the proud and de
fiant servant, Louka, a part which
was assumed by Miss E. E. Dean, '12.
Miss Dean's debut on the Stanford
stage was indeed a worthy one; her
characterization was at all times
finished, consistent, and convincing.
She was handicapped, however, in
that all her important scenes were
with the only two members of the cast
whose work was below the standard
of the production. Although (J. F.
Morgan, '10, failed to show the real
Sergius, his performance was aided
by a very distinct reading of his lines,
not a syllable of which escaped the
audience. J. A. Visej, '11, whose dra
matic experience has been large, was
plainly miscast as Nicola.
Miss M. Wilson, '11, was thoroughly
acceptable as Catherine, while H. A.
Lewis, '12, gave a convincing rendi
tion of Petkoff, an intricate role for
young amateurs. W. B. Cohen, '12,
was the Officer.

The long waits between acts, which
were merely an attempt, to prolong
an unusually short play, formed an
unpleasant feature, (he intermissions
being unnecessarily tedious. The
scenery was adequate, but not ex
ceptional as the English Club pro
vided no new settings for the oc
casion.
The orchestra, under the leadership
of R. A. Gott, '09, was extremely sat
isfactory.
