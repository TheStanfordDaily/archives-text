# VANCOUVER IS VICTOR
## EASILY DEFEATED VARSITY IN FAST, SPIRITED GAME. 11 to 3 Is Score of First Watch Between British Columbian and Stanford Fifteens. 
### 
Vancouver deserved even a larger
score than fell to her lot in the 11 to
3 victory which the British Colum
bians secured over the Cardinal Var
sity today. Barring spasmodic rallies
on the part of the Stanford team, Van
couver had a clear advantage
throughout. A wonderful exhibition
of aggressive forward play was given
by Bryant and Deakin of the visiting
pack.
The first half of the game was
merely a succession of the best drib
bling and rucking which has been
seen this year with an occasional
flash of brilliant backfield work. Van
couver was slow to strike her gait
and during the early course of the
period the play was continually in
her territorry. The Northern pack,
however, soon began the fierce at
tack for which it is famed and from
then on honors were practically even.
Vancouver made the only score of
the half by a momentary passing ral
ly, Deykin carrying the oval close to
the line where he transferred to Bry
ant. Ellis failed to convert. The
desperate struggle commenced again
and never for an instant did the fight
relax its fierceness. Rucking and
kicking into touch followed each oth
er in quick succession, neither goal
being seriously threatened again. The
half ended with the ball in touch
Following the second kick-off the
Vancouver forwards pushed Stanford
far down the field but a long run by
Mitchell and Ganong brought the
ball back to the Northerners' side of
center. Johnson relieved and the
oval was once again on the Cardinal's
twenty-five yard line. Soon after,
Johnson's pretty run brought the pig
skin to the one-yard line where Van
couver was given a free kick but Ellis
missed the chance at goal. Play still
remained in Stanford's territory.
Scott was soon forced to touch down
and a drop-out temporarily relieved
the danger. The Vancouver pack
quickly dribbled down and Newcombe
registered the second try, Gibson fail
ing to convert. Stanford rallied and
forced the play down the field but
Vancouver soon returned the pigskin.
Then came the day's most sensational
play when Scott and Ganong by ac
curate passing and an effective short
kick carried the ball seventy yards.
The third score of the afternoon
was secured by McLorg in a short and
brilliant dash, while just before the
call of time Holman covered 30 yards
to a try near the side-lines. Ellis con
verted Vancouver's tally, while Miller
made a beautiful attempt of a very
difficult goal.
