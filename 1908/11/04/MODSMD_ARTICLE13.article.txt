With some simple co-operation the
two upper classes can avoid a very
dangerous practice that has attended
most Plug Uglies. This is the con
tinuance of the rush at the postofflce.
Most of the former upper classes have
been peculiarly fortunate in not hav
ing many of their members injured
as a result of the rush on the steps.
There have been cases of serious in
jury to men who were thrown off the
porch to the pavement below. It may
be seen readily that the possible con
sequences that may arise from rush
ing on the steps may be even more
serious than the few accidents which
have occurred. There have been
agreements to keep off these steps
but the makers have never lived up
to them. If a good understanding is
reached beforehand, however, no one
will be the worse for not mounting
the steps and serious accidents will
be prevented.
