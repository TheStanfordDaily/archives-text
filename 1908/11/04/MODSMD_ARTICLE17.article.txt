# Fall Baseball Practice Discontinued.
## 
### 
Fall baseball practice has been dis
continued and the varsity squad will
not appear on the local diamond
again until Captain Sampson issues
the call for spring training next sem
ester. This step was taken because
of the early hour at which darkness
falls, thus making it impossible to
continue practice long enough to be
profitable to the players.
