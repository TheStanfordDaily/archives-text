# WHITES OF FLEETS RECEPTION.
## Friend of Dr. Jordan in Sydney, Australia, Gives Interesting Details of Welcome. 
### 
President Jordan is in receipt of
a letter from a friend in Sydney, who
writes an interesting letter about the
reception tendered the American fleet,
as follows:
"We are just recovering from a
very, very bad attack of American
Fleet. "The Fleet" has come and
gone, and it has left behind it the
pleasantest of recollections. The
wonderful outburst of affection and
good fellowship during the stay of
the ships in these waters was some
thing never to be forgotten. Affec
tion is not too strong a word to use,
as the feeling of esteem and respect
for our big brother in America is
very deep-seated in the heart of Aus
tralia. It has been uppermost in the
people's minds all through that we
welcoming those who were born
of the same mother, and that is the
keynote, of the whole matter. The
entry into port Jackson was a ma
jestic sight. The spectacle of the
high cliffs (running for several miles
to the south from Port Jackson) cap
ped with one continuous living hedge
of people, following the contour of
the headlands, was aothing short of
amazing. That Uncle Sam's ships
will be the means of drawing the En
glish-speaking peoples much closer
together in the bonds of sympathy
and affection, there can be no doubt."
