# University to Have Gas.
## 
### 
Pipes are now being laid to furnish
the University buildings with gas.
Although the Palo Alto Gas company
has the contract to provide the gas
supply, they will not own the pipe
lines.
The pipe lines will connect with
the mains of Palo Alto at a point
north of the entrance gate and will
extend through the arboretum past
the Museum and Chemistry building
to the corner of the Zoology building,
then along side the quadrangle to
the Stanford Bookstore.
At present neither of the dormitor
ies will be connected.
