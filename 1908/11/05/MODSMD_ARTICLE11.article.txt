# More Football Show Tickets Secured.
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that the block of
seats which were reserved for the stu
dents at the football show at the
American Theater are not sufficient
to supply the demands on the campus,
Graduate Manager J. E. Stewart, '08,
has withdrawn the tickets from sale
in the city which were reserved for
the alumni and has placed them at
the disposal of the student body.
They may now be secured at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
This makes 200 more seats avail
able. They are in a very good loca
tion. F. W. Turner, '08, stated also
today that about one hundred rooters'
seats remained to be sold for the in
tercollegiate game, and urged that
they be taken up at once.
