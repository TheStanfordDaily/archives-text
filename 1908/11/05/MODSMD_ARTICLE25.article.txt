# DOCTOR JORDAN TALKS
## LECTURES ON FISHERIES LAW IN THE CHAPEL. Big Difference Between American and British Statutes From Ocean to Ocean. 
### 
Doctor Jordan gave an interesting
talk on the "international Law and
the Fisheries Question" this after
noon in the Chapel. In part he said,
"The boundary between United States
and Canada lies largely through
water which is fine fresh-water fishing.
On the north side of the line the Brit
ish law prevails and on the south side
the American law. The laws in re
gard to fishing in the lakes are vari
ous and consequently trouble arises
over the fisheries. Lake Erie is the
best fresh water fishing in the world.
Fishing on this lake is governed not
only by state laws, but also by Ameri
can National and British law.
"The American and British laws dif
fer in regard to ways of protecting
and saving the various fishes. The
Canadians are restricted from fishing
in the lakes unless they receive cer
tain privileges, while any American
can fish on this side of the line. The
former thought the only way possible
to save the fish was by eliminating the
number of fishermen, while as the
Americans could not do this, friction
soon arose.
"It has been the policy of President
Roosevelt to be on friendly terms with
the British in regard to the fisheries.
To remove the friction between the
two countries, in April 1908 a treaty
was made by which a commission, to
consist of one American and one Eng
lishman, was appointed to draw up
international statutes in regard to
fisheries."
Dr. Jordan was the American com
missioner. After visiting all the fish
ing stations he and his collegue de
cided on what statutes would prove
successful. Further he spoke of the
various types of fishes, showing speci
mens of each type, and told where the
different fishes live, of their habits,
food and numbers, and then explain
ing the different laws for the protec
tion of the different fishes. In con
clusion he said the two countries have
never been able so far to get laws on
both sides of the boundary line to
match and the commission hoped to
effect uniformity of law.
