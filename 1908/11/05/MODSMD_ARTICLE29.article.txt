# JAPANESE STUDENTS ENTERTAIN.
## V. Ichihashi, '07, Delivers Address on Japanese Customs to Members of Cosmopolitan Club. 
### 
The Japanese Students' Association
entertained the members of the Cos
mopolitan CI lib last evening at their
home in College Ten ace. Y. Ichiha
shi, '07, delivered an address on "Ja
pan as a Topsy-Turvy Land," in
which he compared the customs of
the American and Japanese peoples,
showing the curious reversal of
habits.
"To the Japanese coming to this
country" he said, "the rooms of an
American home, crowded with furni
ture and bric-a-brac, seem like mus
eums when compared with the ex
treme simplicity of the Japanese
homes, in a room of which there may
be perhaps a few flowers and draw
ings, but scarcely any furniture."
The Japanese custom, said Icliiha
shi, in writing is entirely different
from that of the Western nations also,
as the former habitually write from
the top to the bottom of a page and
from the right to the left-hand side.
In meeting a friend a Japanese never
looks him in the eye, as it is consid
ered embarassing. Sekko Shimada,
the well-known artist, illustrated the
lecture with some clever sketches
which were afterward sold at auction,
the proceeds going to the treasury of
the club. Characteristic Japanese
refreshments were served during the
evening and a pair of chopsticks giv
en to each of the guests as souvenirs.
