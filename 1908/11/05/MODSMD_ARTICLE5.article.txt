# GIVE UP RUSH AT P.O.
## PLUG UGLY STRUGGLE WILL BE CONFINED TO QUAD. Upper Classes Decide to Abandon Dangerous Practice and Institute Change. 
### 
The old custom of storming the
postoffice steps as a conclusion of the
Plug Ugly rush will be abandoned to
morrow night. At meetings of the
Senior and Junior men held this af
ternoon it was decided to seek some
substitute for this stunt, which has
been considered unfavorably by all
classes in recent years. As a result,
committees from the two classes met
and conferred upon the plan.
It has been fixed that instead of
running to the postoffice in case the
Juniors effect a footing on the quad
rangle, the third year men will be
allowed to march off the inner quad
rangle unmolested and form in the
open court between the Romanic
Languages building and the Business
office. The Seniors will gather in the
large stone archway which leads to
the inner quadrangle and when both
classes have secured a formation a
rush will be instituted and the object
of the struggle will be for the Sen
iors to prevent the Juniors from
reaching the inner quadrangle.
The arguments presented which re
sulted in the changing the final strug
gle from the postoffice to the quad
rangle were that the struggle was in
determinate as held before and dan
gerous in the extreme. Both classes
were practically unanimous in de
ciding to abandon the practice. The
conference committees appointed
were:
Seniors —G. McGregor, J. P. Hemp
hill and H. Price; Juniors— F. A.
Adams, J. Bubb and B. E. Parsons.
