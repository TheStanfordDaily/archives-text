# SATURDAY IS TAG DAY
## SPECTATORS AT GAME WILL HELP CRIPPLES. Girl Students Will Pin Immunity Badges on You, But Not for Less Than a Dime. 
### 
Next Saturday will be "Tag Day"
on the campus. This day is for the
purpose of raising money for charit
able institutions, and was introduced
from the east into Los Angeles this
summer. Its success in the southern
city was so great that many promi
nent women in San Francisco have
taken the matter up and are trying
to raise $30,000.00 for the Cripple
Ward of the Children's Hospital there.
All of the towns around the bay are
in sympathy with this, and are work
ing in harmony with San Francisco
to make Saturday a success.
"Tag Day" is being furthered by
Rev. D. C. Gardner and a number of
the women students, who are working
in conjunction with the San Fran
cisco committee. Two girls will be
appointed from each sorority and
club, with four from Roble Hall to
assist and will do their "tagging" at
the Vancouver Rugby game on Sat
urday. Each person is expected to
give at least ten cents toward this
worthy cause, and will be tagged in
return by one of the ladies who have
the day in charge.
