# LAST RUGBY CONTEST
## VARSITY WILL MEET VANCOUVER TOMORROW AT 3:30. Final Chance to See Stanford Fifteen Against Opponents Before the Intercollegiate Game. 
### 
Tomorrow for the last time bel'ore
the big game, the Stanford bleachers
will have ail opportunity to see the
Varsity in action against an outside
team. From all indications the con
test tomorrow between the Cardinal
veterans and the crack Vancouver
fifteen will be the ir.ost fiercely con
tested match of any seen on Stanford
Field this year. The game, which is
the last of the series with the North
erners, will Le called at 3:30.
The British Columbian fifteen will
present practically the same line-up
as on Wednesday. Bryant, rear rank
er, who was injured in the first con
test, will be replaced by Davis. Other
than this the Northerners will make
no changes in the personnel of their
team.
The line-up of the Varsity for to
morrow's game is somewhat uncer
tain owing to the fact that four of
the Cardinal players are suffering
from rather serious injuries and may
not be sufficiently recovered to per
mit of their appearing on the field
Captain Crawford is one of those who
may not enter, on account of his dam
aged ear and will probably be replaced
at side rank by Reynolds. In case
Terrill's ankle prevents him from
playing, Higley will appear at front
rank. Cheda's injury is rather more
serious than was at first supposed,
and while he will probably be able to
resume his position in time for the
intercollegiate contest, he will be un
able to play tomorrow. His place will
be filled by Dole. Cadwalader's knee
is improving rapidly now but it is
practically certain that he will be un
able to enter the game. Although
considerably handicapped by the ab
sence of the four veterans, the Var
sity will still present a strong line
up to the visitors and should be able
to turn the tables 011 them.
T. J. Lafferty of San Francisco will
officiate at the contest. The usual
admission of fifty cents will be charg
ed. The line-ups:
Stanford—Higley, Koerner, Dole,
Reynolds, Pemberton, Miller, Evans,
