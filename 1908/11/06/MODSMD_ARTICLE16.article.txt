There seems to be some misunder
standing among the student body, and
especially among the men, concerning
the conduction of Tag Day tomorrow.
In the first place, the money that will
be raised will go toward the benefit
of the Little Jim Ward of the Child
ren's Hospital, San Francisco. This
ward contains a large number of the
youngest and most desperately crip
pled children in the city.
A tag tomorrow will cost but ten
cents. Of course, no one has to buy
a Tag unless he wishes so to do. It
almost goes without saying that the
men alone are not expected to buy
the tags. Everybody who will con
tribute ten cents will be welcomed by
the young ladies who will sell the
tickets. They are making something
of a sacrifice to dispose of the tags,
and it would be a lielp to them if
those who feel they can contribute
ten cents to such a worthy cause
would step up and buy of their own
accord. No one will be expected to
purchase more than one tag. Change
will be given to every purchaser.
There can lie no question of the
worthiness of the cause for which
the tag money will be collected. With
this idea well understood, it seems
that the members of the University
community should do all in their
power to swell the total that Stanford
will send to San Francisco for the
aid of her suffering children.
