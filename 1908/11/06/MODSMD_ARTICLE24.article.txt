# TOURNEY NEARING END
## FEW UNFINISHED MATCHES TO BE PLAYED. Finals Will Probably Come on Tuesday or Wednesday of Next Week. 
### 
Contrary to the expectations of the
committee in charge, the men's handi
cap tennis tournament will not be
finished this week. This is owing to
the fact that severa' of the matches
that were to have been played during
the afternoons have had to be post
poned on account of darkness. It is
thought, however, that these can be
played off inside of two or three days
and that Tuesday rr Wednesday of
next week will see the completion of
Ihe tournament.
The elimination of deuce sets has
aided materially in the early ending
of the large number of matches and
this method of play will probably be
generally adopted for the large tour
naments in the future. The majority
of the players approve strongly of the
six-game set. Following are the re
maining scores of the second and
third rounds:
Second round —Geary defeated
Wilkeson, 6-4, 6-2; McDougal defeat
ed Jacobi, 6-1, 6-1; E. Jordan defeated
Caddagan, default; Hriggs defeated
Lilienthal, default; R. Steinberger
defeated Doan, 6-4, 4-6, default; Par
ton defeated Delano, default.
Third round —Batkin defeated Ward
6-2, 6-3; Peabodv defeated Sheldon,
0-2, 5-6, 6-2; Wilde defeated Geary,
6-3, 6-4; Canterbury defeated Lantz,
