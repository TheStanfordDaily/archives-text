# SCOTSMAN SPEAKS ON SCOTLAND
## Hon. Robertson Gives Entertaining Talk to University Audience This Afternoon. 
### 
Hon. Joseph C. Robertson, one of
the magistrates of the city of Glas
gow as well as a trustee of the Uni
versity of Glasgow, gave a most de
lightful talk this afternoon on the
subject of "Men and Places in Scot
land."
After a brief introduction by Dr.
Jordan, the speaker told how Glas
gow had grown from a small village
to a modern city of a million inhab
itants and spoke of some of the prom
inent men whom that city has pro
duced, among the most famous of
whom were Henry Bell and James
Watts He next took up the indus
tries of his city and showed how the
Americans had wrested the cotton
trade away from Glasgow, leaving the
ship building as the chief present
day industry.
Hon. Robertson said in part: "We
read in American newspapers that we
are a model city and we sit up and
take notice. We don't think we are.
You wouldn't either if you had ever
been present at a council meeting."
He spoke briefly on his intimate
acquaintance with Lord Kelvin, Lord
Rosenberry, Lord Lister and Lord
Argyle, William Ramsey.
In passing he said: "We have ex
perienced a depression caused by
your recent crisis that is due to you
because you have not sent the regular
amount of iron and steel to our
shores."
