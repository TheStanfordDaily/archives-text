# P.A.A. MEET TOMORROW
## LARGE ENTRY LIST FOR ANNUAL HANDICAP EVENT. Stanford Athletes Receive Slight Advantages Except in a Few Instances. 
### 
Stanford will not be represented by
a full team at the annual handicap
meet of the Pacific Athletic Associa
tion to be held on the new cinder path
at St. Mary's College in Oakland to
morrow afternoon, owing to the fact
that several of the original fifteen
men selected will be unable to com
pete. Eleven clubs and institutions
are included in the entry list, which
is the largest ever received for an
open meet in this vicinity. The Uni
versity of California has an unus
ually strong team entered, and from
the prospects should carry off the
honors of the clay. The meet will be
gin sharply at 1:30.
In general, the Cardinal athletes
received very close handicaps, but in
a few instances the distance given is
sufficient to give the Stanford entry
a good chance of winning his event.
In the 880 yard run, J. P. Hemphill,
'09, has a handicap of 32 yards and
E. A. McGregor, '08, is allowed 30
yards. These should give either of
these men a fair chance to win the
race from Glarner, who is running
scratch, or Dowd of California, who
has 15 yards. It is still possible, how-
that there is some unknown
runner' who has a sufficiently large
handicap to enable him to keep the
lead. McGregor has been put at
scratch in the mile and will have a
good run to place, though G. Bevier,
'11, with 40 yards and E. C. Temple
ton, '10, with 85 yards might annex a
point.
A. Johnson, '10, has a good lead in
the 220 yard dash, where he is given
a handicap of 16 yards over Gerhardt
the Olympic Club star, and in the
440 yard dash the same runner is
given only 20 yards over Glarner. In
the hurdles, K. L. .dorton, '08, is
scratch man in both events with Ed
wards of California, while B. L. Gregg
has an advantage of l yard in the low
hurdles. Gregg may be able to place
in the high jump, where he has an 8
inch handicap over D. G. Martin, ex
'lo, now of the Olympic Club. In this
event H. V. Poor, '10, has 1 inch and
C. A. Waring, '11, 3 inches. Waring
has two inches over Bull of Califor
nia in the pole vault.
Should T. D. Med lick, '11, enter
the meet he will face a hard
proposition in the broad jump, where
he is put at scratch with such a jump
er as Beeson of Healdsburg, holding
a 24 inch handicap, it is very doubt
ful at present whether Meddick will
be entered or not. Gregg was given
27 inches in this event. M. P. Youker,
'10, is scratch man in the hammer
throw, but it is probable that an in
jury to his bark will prevent him
from entering the meet. Horton is
scratch in the shot put with several
men holding 8 foot handicaps.
