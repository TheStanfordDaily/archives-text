# TO HELP THE CRIPPLES
## TAGS WILL BE SOLD AT RUGBY GAME TOMORROW, Step Up to a Pretty Girl and Give Her a Dimeâ€”That's All There Is to Tag Day. 
### 
"1 am tagged for charity, get in
the game!" Anybody who does not
wear a tag bearing the above in
scription, at the Vancouver game to
morrow, Saturday, November 7, will
be strictly out of it. All of the cities
around the bay, together with the
University of California will have
Tag day on tomorrow and Stan
ford has been asked to join them.
Each tag will be sold for ten cents,
and the proceeds de voted to the Lit
tle Jim Ward of the Children's Hospi
tal in San Francisco. Five hlndred
thousand dollars belonging to this
institution was lost in a bank failure
last spring. Since then almost the
whole amount has been replaced by
donations and the Tag Days of dif
ferent cities. The object of this Tag
Day is to complete the sum, and en
able the hospital to proceed with the
new buildings planned for the insti
tution. The earnest co-operation of
every body should put this project
through.
Twenty-two women of the Univer
sity will sell tags on the campus. The
number assigned to Stanford to be
sold is close on to a thousand. The
y< ing ladies who have consented to
stil the tags wish it known that
change will always be given and that
no more than one tag is expected to
be purchased by any one. They say,
too, that it will help them immensely
if the purchasers of tags will come
forward voluntarily. Carry your
money with you on Saturday, for you
may be tagged any time.
The following young ladies have
charge of the selling in case none of
them come to you, go to them:
Misses M. A. Dunn, '08, H. Green,
'OS, S. H. Starr, '09, F. H. Forbes, '09,
