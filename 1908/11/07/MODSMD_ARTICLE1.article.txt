# PLUG UGLY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED
## VANCOUVER BESTED IN SMASHING GAME. INSTRUCTED TO LEAVE STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TAKES ACTION. Seven Juniors Suffer Penalty For Certain Features of Foster and Last Night's Show. 
### 
At a meeting of the Student Af
fairs Committee toddy, the seven
members of the 1910 Plug Ugly Com
mittee were suspended from the Uni
versity for an indefinite period of
time, while applications for re-admis
sion will not be considered before the
end of the semester. The notices
of suspension were mailed to the mem
bers of the Junior committee this af
ternoon.
Those suspended were S. A. Lin
dauer, C. H. Hails, J. E. Shelton, R.
H. Brown, H. T. Allen, W. P. Fuller,
Jr., and T. C. Henry.
Professor A. H. Clark, when inter
viewed this evening in regard to the
situation and the action of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, chose to con
tine his remarks almost entirely to
the statement posted over his signa
ture on the University bulletin board.
He said, however, that no further ac
tion bearing on the Plug Ugly was
at this time contemplated by the Stu
dent. Affairs Committee. He stated
that the action ol the committee had
been purely confined to the members
of the Plug Ugly Committee for rea
sons set forth in the statement, post
ed. Professor Clark also said the com
mittee met this morning and that no
session was called for after the show
last, night as it had been rumored
today. The notice published by the
committee contains the only other
statement that the committee desires
to make public. The notice reads:
"Because of the character of the al
lusions to the women of the Univer
sity in the Plug Ugly poster, and in
view of the violation of the pledges
given to the Committee on Student
Affairs, the members of the Plug Ugly
Committee are suspended from the
University.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK,
"Chairman Student Affairs Commit
tee."
The pledges referred to in tlie state
ment which Professor Clark explain
ed, were both verbal and written. He
says that before the Juniors were al
lowed to have permission to use As
sembly Hall, the Plug Ugly Commit
tee gave written assurance that the
show would be free from objection
able features of past performances.
This the committee did, says Profes
sor Clark, and furthermore, when
called before himself and the other
members of the Studint Affairs Com
mittee on Thursday, the Junior com
mittee also stated that the show
would be clean, decent and respect
ful. This, he says, the Student Affairs
Committee feels has been violated,
and action has been taken accord
ingly.
When interviewed this evening re-
garding the suspensions, Dr. Jordan
had the following to say:
"[ am not authority for the com
mittee, but I think the suspensions
were made because of both the post
er and the show. As I see it, al
though 1 am not thoroughly acquaint
ed with the committee's point of view,
their action was taken because of
pledges that were made by the Plug
Ugly Committee and because of the
reference to the Dean of Women in
the poster. The Junior committee
stated that there would be nothing
improper in the show if they were al
lowed the use of the Assembly Hall;
that the show would be one fit to be
given in the Assembly Hall. They
said it would be orderly and these

statements were made to the Student
Affairs Committee and also to Mr.
Clark, my secretary, when applica
tion was made for the hall.
"The suspensions were made, I
think, primarily, because the commit
tee thought that the men had prom
ised to do things which they did not
do. The men seemec to be responsi
ble for a breach of faith."
The letter mailed to the respective
members of the Plug Ugly Commit
tee follows:
"Leland Stanford Juuior University
"Committee on Student Affairs.
November 7, 1908.
"Dear Sir:—
"At a meeting of the Student Af
fairs Committee held November 7„
1908, you were suspended indefinitely
from the University. Application for
re-admission will not be considered
before the end of the semester.
"Your attention is called to the
rule on the accompanying sheet.
"Very truly yours,
"A. B. CLARK, Chairman."
The regulations referred to are:
"During the period of suspension
from the University a student shall
not attend University exercises, nor
remain in residence at the Universi
ty, nor frequent the University
grounds except by s| ecial permission
of the commitee.
"A student under suspension shall
not take part in any intercolegiate
contest, nor represert the University
in any way, whether individually or
in connection with any athletic. lit
erary, musical, dramatic or other or
ganization."
A feature of the situation arising
out of the Plug Ugly produced last
night, is the calling off of the big
mass meeting of the men of the Uni
versity, which President W. C. Shel
ton, '08, of the University Confer
ence, had scheduled. At this gather
ing, President David Starr Jordan,
Professor J. M. Stillnian.head of the
Chemistry department, Professor F.
C. Woodward, of the Law department,
and Profesor C. D. Marx, of the Civil
Engineering department, were to have
spoken. Acting upon the stand taken
by Dr. Jordan, all of the faculty mem
bers decided not to speak, as the dis
turbance at the show last night waR
deemed by the head of the University
sufficient to disrupt any plans that
might have been advanced for stu
dent control. President. Shelton be
lieved it the best policy under the cir
cumstances to call off the meeting.
