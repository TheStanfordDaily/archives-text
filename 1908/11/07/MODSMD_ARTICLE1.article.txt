## VANCOUVER BESTED IN SMASHING GAME. INSTRUCTED TO LEAVE STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TAKES ACTION. Seven Juniors Suffer Penalty For Certain Features of Foster and Last Night's Show. 
### 
At a meeting of the Student Af
fairs Committee toddy, the seven
members of the 1910 Plug Ugly Com
mittee were suspended from the Uni
versity for an indefinite period of
time, while applications for re-admis
sion will not be considered before the
end of the semester. The notices
of suspension were mailed to the mem
bers of the Junior committee this af
ternoon.
Those suspended were S. A. Lin
dauer, C. H. Hails, J. E. Shelton, R.
H. Brown, H. T. Allen, W. P. Fuller,
Jr., and T. C. Henry.
Professor A. H. Clark, when inter
viewed this evening in regard to the
situation and the action of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, chose to con
tine his remarks almost entirely to
the statement posted over his signa
ture on the University bulletin board.
He said, however, that no further ac
tion bearing on the Plug Ugly was
at this time contemplated by the Stu
dent. Affairs Committee. He stated
that the action ol the committee had
been purely confined to the members
of the Plug Ugly Committee for rea

mittee met this morning and that no
session was called for after the show
last, night as it had been rumored
today. The notice published by the
committee contains the only other
statement that the committee desires
to make public. The notice reads:
"Because of the character of the al
lusions to the women of the Univer
sity in the Plug Ugly poster, and in
view of the violation of the pledges
given to the Committee on Student
Affairs, the members of the Plug Ugly
Committee are suspended from the
University.
(Signed) "A. B. CLARK,
"Chairman Student Affairs Commit
tee."
The pledges referred to in tlie state
ment which Professor Clark explain
ed, were both verbal and written. He
says that before the Juniors were al
lowed to have permission to use As
sembly Hall, the Plug Ugly Commit
tee gave written assurance that the
show would be free from objection
able features of past performances.
This the committee did, says Profes
sor Clark, and furthermore, when
called before himself and the other
members of the Studint Affairs Com
mittee on Thursday, the Junior com
mittee also stated that the show
would be clean, decent and respect
ful. This, he says, the Student Affairs
Committee feels has been violated,
and action has been taken accord
ingly.
