# 1910 STAGE PLUG UGLY
## "GIVEN THE HOOK" PLAYS TO A CROWDED HOUSE. Juniors Find Small Opposition In Mounting Quad.â€”Good Eight At New Point of Struggle. 
### 
On the boards of the Assembly
Hall last evening the Class of 19 10
staged "Given the Hook" to a pack
ed house. As was the case last
year, the actors had little chance to
make their lines heard, and tor this
reason little idea could be gained
of the reputed cleverness of the dia
logue. To the spectators the only
part of the show really worth while
was the impersonation of a certain
well-known faculty member and of
the charming, albeit a bit risque,
typewriter girl.
But as the appetizer for the real
business of the evening, "Given the
Hook" filled the bill perhaps as well
as usual, and the good tight around
the quadrangle atoned in a measure
for the lack of the old picturesque
performance in the open air. The
Juniors swept onto the quad at the
steps on the north side of the Ro
manic Languages department with
comparative ease, probably owing to
the fact that they mounted the steps
before the Seniors had formed, and
were checked for only an instant by
the thin line of 1908 men at the in
ner quadrangle. A stiff running fight
was made of it around the arcades.
Seniors and their allies were mixed
with the Junior ranks in their march
and a confused melee resulted in
which there was no organization but,
nevertheless, plenty of damage to
the new headgear. In front of the
Memorial Church the Seniors checked
the advance of the Juniors for an
instant, but the latter completed the
circuit to the east central arch of
the inner quadrangle, where the
hardest fighting of the evening took
place. The success of holding the
second struggle here instead of on
the postofflce steps was then demon
strated. The white dust which en
veloped the defenders and the attack
ing party at this point choked the
fighters and made it difficult to judge
to whom belongs the credit of a vic
tory.
Several rushes were made and un
doubtedly a good part of the Jun
iors went through the disputed,
ground. On the other hand, the
line of the attacking party was sev
eral times cut in two by wedges
from the Senior ranks and several
rushes were decisively beaten back.
A point on which all agree, and that
is the most important, after all, is
that the plugs of 1910 received a
proper christening.
