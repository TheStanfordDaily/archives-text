# VARSITY WINS BY 11-3
## STRUGGLE IS HARDEST FIGHT SEEN THIS SEASON. Forwards Continually Prominent In Contest in Which Scores Are All Made In Second Half. 
### 
The Stanford Varsity turned th
tables on their opponents from Van
couver this afternoon, the British
Columbians going down to defeat 11
to 3, the same score as that of Wed
nesday's game with the teams re
verse!.
Stanford's defence was powerful to
day, successfully preventing Vancou
ver from tallying until far along in
the second half. The Cardinal play
ers themselves failed to secure any
of their eleven points until several
minutes after the opening of the last
period. Hut once the first try was
registered, Stanford gained continu
ally and easily until (he end of the
match, with the exception of Van'
couver's fine rally at the time of her
score.
The contest characterized
throughout by the fiercest fighting
that has been seen on Stanford Field
this year, the forward divisions in
particular, playing extremely agres
sive games. Dole, who substituted at
lock for Cheda, deserves especial
mention for his work. Today was his
first appearance in the Varsity ranks,
and his performance was fully on a
par with that of the veteran for
wards. Crawford, in spite of his in
jury, played his usual strong game.
Miller's offensive work, especially in
dribbling and punting, stood out
prominently, even in as fast an ag
gregation as the forward divisions of
the contesting teams. Faulkner, at,
full, was very effective, relieving the
Stanford goal from danger time and
again by his punts.
The first period was largely a strug
gle between the opposing forwards,
but in Ihe last half, Stanford's back
field had a better opportunity in which
to demonstrate its speediness, and
many snappy passing rushes brought
substantial gains to the Cardinal.
During the second period, Cook, at
wing, was replaced by Roth.
The particular stars in the British
Columbian fifteen were Fyson and El
lis, the two fives, Deykin. ai side rank,
and Bell-Irving, ,who played at full.
These men were responsible for many
of the gains made by the visitors.
First Half.
The initial kick-off was made by
Captain Crawford and was run in to
the forty-yard line. Stanford punted
to touch on the ten-yard streak and
Fyson saved a try by booting. The
Northern forwards seemed to strike
their gait now, and in a series of
rushes pushed the oval to within a
few feet of the Cardinal goal, but
Mitchell relieved by punting.
Stanford now assumed the aggres
sive, and from this time on the Car
dinal line was never in serious dan
ger. A series of dribbling rushes
brought the pigskin to Vancouver's
thirty-yard line, where Crawford se
cured on a line-out, and in one of
the prettiest runs of the half carried
to within a few feet of the British
Columbian goal, where he was down
ed and the ball punted out of danger.
Again the Cardinal forwards ad
vanced the oval into the Northern
ers' territory, where Dole secured and
ran thirty-five yards. He was downed
and an over-kick on the part of the
Cardinal forwards sent the pigskin
into the territory known as touch-in
goal. Miller secured, the effect be
ing equivalent to a touch-down by
Vancouver, in that the play is follow
ed by a drop-out.
The next few minutes of play con
sisted chiefly in a punting duel by
the fullbacks. Following the boot
ing, the Vancouver backs secured the
ball, and in a fast, passing rally, car
ried the ball to within ten yards of
Stanford's goal. The danger was at
once relieved by Crawford, who boot
ed to center. The play was charac
terized by much kicking without eith
er side gaining any clear advantage.
Near the end of half-time, the Nor
therners succeeded in dribbling into
the center of the Cardinal territory,
but. Stanford kicked to touch at cen
ter just as the period ended.
Second Half.
Vancouver kicked off and immed
iately rushed the ball by a series of
punts to the Cardinal two-yard line,
from where it rolled over and Ga
nong touched down. Stanford then
assumed the offensive and until the
end of the period, with the exception
of the brief instant when Vancouver
scored, forced the play. The first try
was made after about fifteen minutes
of play, Holman securing the oval
from a ruck and passing to Mitchell,
who went over near the side-line.
Crawford failed to kick a very diffi
cult goal.

After the drop-out, play settled
near the Vancouver thirty-five-yard
line, and Erb secured and passed to
Evans, who was downed within three
feet of the line. Do'e made the try,
which was not converted.
The Cardinal forwards again forced
the pigskin well into the visitors' ter
ritory and Holman scooped the ball
and ran twenty yards for a try. Craw
ford kicked a beautiful goal from a
difficult angle.
Vancouver kicked off but a few feet
and immediately started a dribbling
rush which brought the ball to with
in a few feet of the Cardinal goal. A
scrum ensued and Fyson was pushed
over for a try. Bell-Irving failed to
convert. The period ended with the
ball near center and Stanford forcing
the play.

ger. A series of dribbling rushes
brought the pigskin to Vancouver's
thirty-yard line, where Crawford se
cured on a line-out, and in one of
the prettiest runs of the half carried
to within a few feet of the British
Columbian goal, where he was down
ed and the ball punted out of danger.
Again the Cardinal forwards ad
vanced the oval into the Northern
ers' territory, where Dole secured and
ran thirty-five yards. He was downed
and an over-kick on the part of the
Cardinal forwards sent the pigskin
into the territory known as touch-in
goal. Miller secured, the effect be
ing equivalent to a touch-down by
Vancouver, in that the play is follow
ed by a drop-out.
The next few minutes of play con
sisted chiefly in a punting duel by
the fullbacks. Following the boot
ing, the Vancouver backs secured the
ball, and in a fast, passing rally, car
ried the ball to within ten yards of
Stanford's goal. The danger was at
once relieved by Crawford, who boot
ed to center. The play was charac
terized by much kicking without eith
er side gaining any clear advantage.
Near the end of half-time, the Nor
therners succeeded in dribbling into
the center of the Cardinal territory,
but. Stanford kicked to touch at cen
ter just as the period ended.
Second Half.
Vancouver kicked off and immed
iately rushed the ball by a series of
punts to the Cardinal two-yard line,
from where it rolled over and Ga
nong touched down. Stanford then
assumed the offensive and until the
end of the period, with the exception
of the brief instant when Vancouver
scored, forced the play. The first try
was made after about fifteen minutes
of play, Holman securing the oval
from a ruck and passing to Mitchell,
who went over near the side-line.
Crawford failed to kick a very diffi
cult goal.

After the drop-out, play settled
near the Vancouver thirty-five-yard
line, and Erb secured and passed to
Evans, who was downed within three
feet of the line. Do'e made the try,
which was not converted.
The Cardinal forwards again forced
the pigskin well into the visitors' ter
ritory and Holman scooped the ball
and ran twenty yards for a try. Craw
ford kicked a beautiful goal from a
difficult angle.
Vancouver kicked off but a few feet
and immediately started a dribbling
rush which brought the ball to with
in a few feet of the Cardinal goal. A
scrum ensued and Fyson was pushed
over for a try. Bell-Irving failed to
convert. The period ended with the
ball near center and Stanford forcing
the play.

The Stanford Varsity turned th
tables on their opponents from Van
couver this afternoon, the British
Columbians going down to defeat 11
to 3, the same score as that of Wed
nesday's game with the teams re
verse!.
Stanford's defence was powerful to
day, successfully preventing Vancou
ver from tallying until far along in
the second half. The Cardinal play
ers themselves failed to secure any
of their eleven points until several
minutes after the opening of the last
period. Hut once the first try was
registered, Stanford gained continu
ally and easily until (he end of the
match, with the exception of Van'
couver's fine rally at the time of her
score.
The contest characterized
throughout by the fiercest fighting
that has been seen on Stanford Field
this year, the forward divisions in
particular, playing extremely agres
sive games. Dole, who substituted at
lock for Cheda, deserves especial
mention for his work. Today was his
first appearance in the Varsity ranks,
and his performance was fully on a
par with that of the veteran for
wards. Crawford, in spite of his in
jury, played his usual strong game.
Miller's offensive work, especially in
dribbling and punting, stood out
prominently, even in as fast an ag
gregation as the forward divisions of
the contesting teams. Faulkner, at,
full, was very effective, relieving the
Stanford goal from danger time and
again by his punts.
The first period was largely a strug
gle between the opposing forwards,
but in Ihe last half, Stanford's back
field had a better opportunity in which
to demonstrate its speediness, and
many snappy passing rushes brought
substantial gains to the Cardinal.
During the second period, Cook, at
wing, was replaced by Roth.
The particular stars in the British
Columbian fifteen were Fyson and El
lis, the two fives, Deykin. ai side rank,
and Bell-Irving, ,who played at full.
These men were responsible for many
of the gains made by the visitors.
First Half.
The initial kick-off was made by
Captain Crawford and was run in to
the forty-yard line. Stanford punted
to touch on the ten-yard streak and
Fyson saved a try by booting. The
Northern forwards seemed to strike
their gait now, and in a series of
rushes pushed the oval to within a
few feet of the Cardinal goal, but
Mitchell relieved by punting.
