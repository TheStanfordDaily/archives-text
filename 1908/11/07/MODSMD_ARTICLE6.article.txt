# VARSITY WINS BY 11-3
## STRUGGLE IS HARDEST FIGHT SEEN THIS SEASON. Forwards Continually Prominent In Contest in Which Scores Are All Made In Second Half. 
### 
The Stanford Varsity turned th
tables on their opponents from Van
couver this afternoon, the British
Columbians going down to defeat 11
to 3, the same score as that of Wed
nesday's game with the teams re
verse!.
Stanford's defence was powerful to
day, successfully preventing Vancou
ver from tallying until far along in
the second half. The Cardinal play
ers themselves failed to secure any
of their eleven points until several
minutes after the opening of the last
period. Hut once the first try was
registered, Stanford gained continu
ally and easily until (he end of the
match, with the exception of Van'
couver's fine rally at the time of her
score.
The contest characterized
throughout by the fiercest fighting
that has been seen on Stanford Field
this year, the forward divisions in
particular, playing extremely agres
sive games. Dole, who substituted at
lock for Cheda, deserves especial
mention for his work. Today was his
first appearance in the Varsity ranks,
and his performance was fully on a
par with that of the veteran for
wards. Crawford, in spite of his in
jury, played his usual strong game.
Miller's offensive work, especially in
dribbling and punting, stood out
prominently, even in as fast an ag
gregation as the forward divisions of
the contesting teams. Faulkner, at,
full, was very effective, relieving the
Stanford goal from danger time and
again by his punts.
The first period was largely a strug

but in Ihe last half, Stanford's back
field had a better opportunity in which
to demonstrate its speediness, and
many snappy passing rushes brought
substantial gains to the Cardinal.
During the second period, Cook, at
wing, was replaced by Roth.
The particular stars in the British
Columbian fifteen were Fyson and El
lis, the two fives, Deykin. ai side rank,
and Bell-Irving, ,who played at full.
These men were responsible for many
of the gains made by the visitors.
First Half.
The initial kick-off was made by
Captain Crawford and was run in to
the forty-yard line. Stanford punted
to touch on the ten-yard streak and
Fyson saved a try by booting. The
Northern forwards seemed to strike
their gait now, and in a series of
rushes pushed the oval to within a
few feet of the Cardinal goal, but
Mitchell relieved by punting.
Stanford now assumed the aggres

dinal line was never in serious dan
