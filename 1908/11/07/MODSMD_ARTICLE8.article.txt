The Daily Palo Alto is deeply affect

Ugly Committee. If the men are
compelled to remain absent from the
University for the remainder of the

Especially is the latter the fact in
regard to the members of the Plug
Ugly Committee who have risen to
the position of associates on the staff
of this newspaper. The absence of
these three, all good men, loyal and
true, would mean that the work which
they have so ably handled will have

cessation of disturbances of which the
present is an instance? Naturally,
when the cause of the chronic trouble
is corrected. The blame for this trou
ble can lie on nobody but the admin
istration and the students. It is the
honest belief of the Daily Palo Alto
that by far the lesser part, if any,
of this blame, should fall upon the
students; and that the quicker the
administration realizes so, the better
off the whole University will be.
