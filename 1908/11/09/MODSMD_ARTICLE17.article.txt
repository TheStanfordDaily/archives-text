Rev. D. Charles Gardner preached
an especially forceible sermon at
yesterday morning's service in the
Chapel on the subject of the general
ideals that a student should have and
still not be narrow minded in regard
to amusements. At the conclusion
of the morning service there was •)
celebration of the Lord's Supper.
Good music was a feature of the
morning service. Miss Johanne
Johnson sang "The Lord Is My Shep
herd" in a very pleasing manner and
the University choir rendered the
morning's Anthem, "The Hymn of
Peace," F. W. McNulty, '09, singing
the solo tenor parts.
The University Chaplain brought
out the fact that religion is not merely
a code of morals and that Christianity
has become so confused with creeds
and churches that we almost forget
the fundamental principles of Christ
ianity is loyality to Jesus Christ, it
was then pointed out how important
self-denial is, as it is in reality a war
bHween the animal and the spiritual.
Rev. Gardner said further: "Some
churches prohibit their members from
drinking the social glass, card play
ing, dancing and many other such
things. Every one will acknowledge
that certain forms of pleasure de
moralizing, but everything must be
settled by one's own individual run
science. You must not condemn
your neighbor because he does things
which are tabooed to yourself. Above
all things it is necessary to be broad
minded."
in conclusion he said that self-de
nial allowed absolutely no unbending
to one's conscience. No compromise
and no surrender are the rules of a
moral Christian's denial.
