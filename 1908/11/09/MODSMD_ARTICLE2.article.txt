# "CHAPPIE" TO CELEBRATE BIRTH.
## Tenth Anniversary Will be Observed by Old and New Staffmen at Banquet Next Friday. 
### 
On next Friday evening the Chap
arral will celebrate the tenth anniver
sary of its founding. The present
staff and as many former staffmen as
can be reunited will gather at an elab
orate banquet in the hunting room of
the Bismarck Cafe in San Francisco
and talk and rejoice over the good old
days of the college comic publication.
A bit over ten ago, before
Stanford had an ur.serious publica
tion, Bristow Adams, '00, conceived
the idea of bringing forth to the
university public a periodical in which
good-natured joshes and bits of humor
could be sprung on the Faculty, or
ganizations and students. With the
aid of Larrey Bowman, '01, whose re
cent death has ended the career of a
brilliant magazine writer, the first
Chapparal was published on October
5, 1899. The book was well taken by
the University public, for its joshes
were clever, original, unique and
wholesome and from then on the
Chaparral never saw a dark day, with
the possible exception of the time
when Editor Morris Oppenheim, '05,
was suspended for a few days for the
nature of a "Now That" which dealt
severely with certain unpleasantness
in the University's history.
The editing and managing was
started as an independent institution
and has never been under the control
of the student body. It is in charge of
the Hammer and Coffin society in
which each assistant of the staff is a
member.
The former editors are: Bristow
Adams, '00, Ralph Renaud, '03, Isaac

Russell, '04, Delmar Reynolds, '05,
Morris Oppenheim, '05, Dennison Clift,
'07, E. J. Hadley, '08.
A window of the bookstore will dis
play some of the relics of the Chap
arral this week. The "Hammer" and
some original drawings, as well as
some old editions will be displayed.
