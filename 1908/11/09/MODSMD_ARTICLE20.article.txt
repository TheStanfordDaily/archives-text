## MEN'S HANDICAP TENNIS TO BE COMPLETED THIS WEEK Morgan Defeats Varsity Champion In Hotly Contested Match Last Saturday 
### 
The men's handicap singles tennis
tournament is rapidly coming to a
close. In the lower half H. S. Morgan,
'12, has reached the finals. In the up
per halt' the winner of Batkin —Pea-
body meets the winner of Collins vs.
Crandall —Domaschenz for a place in
the finals to meet Morgan. The feature
of Saturday's play was the remarkable
showing made by Morgan, who de
feated decisively two of the best ten
nis men in the University, Varsity
champion Gowan and Instructor E
Jordan, the latter giving handicap of
"owe 151-2." Morgan would have
had a good chance with either man at
even terms, according to the play Sat
urday.
The Morgan-Gowan match was of
a very high class and was hotly con
tested, many games going to "deuce,"
Gowan's brilliant forehand and back
hand drives and strong serves being
balanced by Morgan's remarkable re
turns and clever overhand work. A
crowd of spectators viewed the macch
which was sensational from start to
finish.
The Morgan-Jordan match was
somewhat similar to the previous
match. Jordan's pretty ground strokes
and passing shots were as ineffective
as Gowan's speed to stop the all
around good playing of Morgan from
winning. Many games went to "duece"
and long rallies resulted, but Jordan's
telling cross-court volleys did not
avail against the back-hand and fore
hand side-line drives of the Freshman
crack, who is conceded an excellent
chance to win the gold medal racket
offered by the Bookstore as first prize.
F. A. Parton/09, made a game fight
against Morgan in the semi-finals, but
his steady game only postponed the
ultimate result.
