# PLAN MUSICAL EVENT
## GLEE CLUB TO GIVE MINSTREL SHOW NEXT SEMESTER Committee of Four to Have Charge of Performanceâ€”Active Work Will Begin Soon 
### 
The Glee Club took the first active
steps towards a minstrel show yester
day afternoon at a meeting: of the
club at the Phi Delta Theta house.
Every one present was in favor of a
show and a committee composed of
J. J. Hill, '08, W. W. Todd, 09, N. Tay
lor, '10, and A. E. Ehrhorn, '10, was
elected to take charge of the prelimi
nary work and make what arrange
ments necessary for the success of the
undertaking. Hill, the chairman of
the committee, had entire charge of
the show that was given during the
first semester last year and has had
considerable experience with this
work.
Under his direction the production
next spring should repeat the success
of last fall.
The committee in charge have al
ready secured the manuscript of an
olio, the dialogue part of a minstrel
show, that failed to arrive in time for
last year's performance, so that work
can begin as soon as the committee
decides whether they care to use this
manuscript. The manager of the Glee
Club, C. B. Bradford, '09, is at pres
ent on an eastern trip and before he
returns to the University he expects
to buy the latest musical song hits
that can be worked into the produc
tion.
The present plans include a regu
lar black-faced minstrel troupe with
end men and a vaudeville program,
preceding the vaudeville. The com
mittee anticipates that the greatest
difficulty of their work will be to get
those who have sufficient ability in or
der to put on sketches, monologues
and other things that would be enter
taining to the student body, to stage
them.
The most likely time for the event
to take place would be midway be
tween the Junior opera and the So
phomore play. Work for the produc
tion will begin this semester, so that
if the Sophomore comedy should be de
layed later than usual, ,tlie Glee Club
could shift their show to a date pre
ceding the comedy of the second year
class.
