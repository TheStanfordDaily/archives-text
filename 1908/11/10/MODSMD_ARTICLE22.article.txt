# California Starts Secret Practice
## 
### 
The varsity Rugby squad of the
University of California began secret
practice this afternoon on California
Field and will continue it until the
big game.
California may be weakened in the
front rank by the absence of Budle
man, who is suffering from an aggra
vated "scrum ear" and may not be
able to play Saturday. Freshman
Hansen has been placed on the train
ing table in case he may be needed to
fill Budleman's place.
