# SHOW IS AT AMERICAN
## "LAND OF NOD" WILL PUT NO ONE TO SLEET Critics Say That Opera for Stanford Night Is a Tuneful and Amusing Production. 
### 
That the football show which is to
be held at the American Theater in
San Francisco the night of the big
game will be worth seeing, even
should the house not be packed with
an enthusiastic gathering of under
graduates, is now assured. Last night
a number of students ,among them
Manager J. E. Stewart, '08, and Yell
Leaders G. N. Richardson, '09, and
P. R. Johnson, '09, attended the per
formance. They are enthusiastic over
the production. Manager Stewart re
turned to the Campus this morning
and states that it is one of the best
musical and laughter-making shows
he has seen in some time. The cast
of the show is nearly the same as that
which made such a decided hit* at the
Van Ness Theater a year ago. The
comedy is replete with situations
which can be given a local touch by
the stunt committee.
The comedians are especially good.
Knox Wilson is very clever and pro
vokes many smiles. Adelaide Har
land, as the chorus girl, is accord
ing to the San Francisco critics,
"snippy and pretty and light
and airy," just like chorus girls
are presumed to be. The chorus is
large and prettily costumed and indi
vidually and collectively good to look
at.
The tickets for the show have been
in big demand in San Francisco and

Manager Stewart has decided to hold
the local supply of seats only until
tomorrow evening. The tickets here
.are the best to he had, but if not
wanted by students will sell readily
to the general public. The football
tickets are also in incessant demand
at Spaulding & Company and at Berk
eley. Manager Stewart has decided to
hold tickets here until Thursday be
fore switching the sale to Spauldrfng's.
