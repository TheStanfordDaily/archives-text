# TO LINE-UP TOMORROW
## VARSITY VS. SUBSTITUTES IN PRACTICE GAME Last Appearance of Fifteen Before Intercollegiate Contest Promises Good Rugby. 
### 
Light work was again the order of
the day with the varsity squad at the
regular practice held on the sawdust
held this afternoon. The men were
put through a round of passing, kick
ing, dribbling and picking up the ball.
Several practice line-outs and scrums
were held to give the players more
drill in these formations.
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 on the
turf field the varsity will contest. A
practice game will bo played between
the first and second fifteens, which
should afford a fast exhibition of
Rugby, as the work of the substitutes
has, of late, been of a high, order.
This is the last opportunity that will
be afforded to the undergraduates to
see the Cardinal team in action be
fore the big game, as the fifteen will
take only light exercise Thursday af
ternoon and will be absent from the
campus all day Friday.
