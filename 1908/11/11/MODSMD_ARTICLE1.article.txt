# DENY BOTH PETITIONS
## COMMITTEE REFUSES REQUEST OF SWORD AND SANDALS. Combined Musical Clubs Will Not Be Allowed to Take Regular Christmas Trip. 
### 
The Student Affairs. Committee have
denied the request of G. N. Richard
son, '09, on behalf of Sword and San
dals, for permission for the appear
ance of W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, in the
play, "His Excellency the Governor"
which is to be staged here next
month. They base their denial on the
fact that Fuller is at present under
suspension from the University.
C. B. Bradford, '09, appearing be
fore Professor Clark, and later before
the entire committee, seeking permis
sion for a combined musical club trip
during the Christmas vacation, was
denied the desired permission. He
was also told that no musical trip
was favored by the committee. The ex
tent to which the statement of that
body is to be construed seems to be
that no body of men who are members
of the Combined Clubs may go from
the University during the holidays and
apear publicly, by themselves, in a
musical program, with impunity.
Bradford later received the following
letter from the committee, which
Professor Clark refuses to discuss for
publication, other than state that the
committee will not approve of any
trip of the club whatsoever. The let
ter reads as follows:
"Dear Sir:
"The Committee on Student Affairs
still retains its opinion given to you
a few days ago and will withhold per
mission for a musical trip this year.
"Very truly yours,
"A. B. CLARK, Chairman."
