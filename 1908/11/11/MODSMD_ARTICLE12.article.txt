now lias a force of thirty-five men en
gaged in removing the ruined stat
uary and the art glass windows. A
temporary wooden structure has been
built in the rear of the church where
the statues and windows will lie
stowed.
At the present time it is impossible
to tell what parts of the ruined ed
ifice may be used in the construction
of the church, but it is the opinion
of those in charge of the work of
demolition that the arches and mo
saics can be left intact. The tearing
out of the side roofs will probably be
started tomorrow.
