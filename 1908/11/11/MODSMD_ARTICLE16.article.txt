# "7-20-8" IS SOPH PLAY
## AUGUSTIN DALY'S BEST WORK CHOSEN FOR PRODUCTION. Preliminary Try-Out to Be Held Next Wednesday Under Coach Frank Mathieu. 
### 
After six weeks of earnest work of
reading numerous plays and after
conscientious endeavors to select a
good, worthy and taking comedy, the
Sophomore play committee, with the
advice of Coach Frank Mathieu, de
cided upon Augustin Daly's pleasant
comedy, "7-20-8," sometimes known as
"Casting the Boomerang." The com
mittee is exceptionally fortunate in
taking this piece as Coach Mathieu is
thoroughly familiar with it. He has
seen the original Da'y company stage
the production, has played parts in
"7-20-S"and acted as professional
stage director in it.
The play itself is a true comedy, not
farcical, with good humorous parts,
and is free from extreme seriousness.
The title, "7-20-8," is the number of
a portrait in an art gallery and the
plot deals with the "original." It is
modern. There are seven male and
four female parts with no part afford
ing great prominence.
Preliminary try-outs will begin at
once, assuring ample time to get the
advanced rehearsals well under way
this semester. The first try-out will
be held next Wednesday afternoon
and evening. The time and place will
be announced later.
The nature of these first try-outs
will be principally for the coach to
get an idea of the available mater
ial. The committee states that can
didates should be prepared to read,
recite or act something with which
they are familiar. Coach Mathieu will
also have them read some parts from
the play.
The date of the performance has
been set for Friday evening, February
26.
