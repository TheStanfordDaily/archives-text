# SOCIETIES HOLD JOINT DEBATE.
## Rebating Interests Forwarded by Gathering of Representatives From Clubs. 
### 
Last evening for the first time in
the history of debating in the Univer
sity, a joint meeting of Nestoria and
Euphronia, the debating societies of
Stanford, was held. This gathering
is the culmination of an effort upon
the part of the organizations of this
branch of college activities to create
more interest for this work in the
student body.
President A. E. Roth, of the Asso
ciated Students, occupied the chair
throughout the evening. An irn
prmptu debate was given by various
members of the two societies repre
sented upon the question of whether
student control should be in the hands
of the Student Affairs Committee or
under the dominance of the students
themselves.
The regular question debated was,
"Resolved, That the Democratic party
Should Give Way to a Third Party."
This was discussed by G. F. Morgan,
'10, F. E. Hill, '11, D. C. Boyd, '08, and
R. J. Miller, '11, upon the affirmative
and by H. C. Green,, '08, S. J. Talbot,
'10, and H. E. Smith, '10, for the nega
tive.
Chairman Roth gave an address in
which he spoke highly of the object
for which the meeting was originally
called and in the co.irse of his talk
expressed the hope that an inter
scholastic debating society would be
formed after the pattern of the pres
ent Interscholastic Athletic Associa
tion that holds its meets at Stanford.
