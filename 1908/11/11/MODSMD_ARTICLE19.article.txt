# Freshmen Begin Work on Bonfire.
## 
### 
The Freshmen began gathering ma
terial for tomorrow night's bonfire
yesterday afternoon. Thirteen mem
bers of the Class of 1912 devoted the
afternoon toward carrying barrels and
other combustibles to the old baseball
diamond, where the serpentine will
take place. By aid of a couple of hay
ricks which were hired for the oc
casion, they have been able to bring
up most of the barrels which the class
has purchased, from behind the ruins
of the Library building. It is the in
tention of the Freshmen to build their
pile to the height of fifty feet. Indi
cations are that the fire will be one of
of the best ever built here for a rally.
