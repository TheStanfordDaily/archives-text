# BIG RUGBY "CHAPPIE" TOMORROW
## Anniversary Number Largest Ever Issuedâ€”Contains Many Good Articles 
### 
Tomorrow the tenth anniversary
number of the Chaparral will appear
on the quadrangle. This number will
be rich in material. "Chappie" will
celebrate by issuing the largest num
ber ever published.
The coming intercollegiate Rugby
contest will be the chief topic treated.
In this connection are some interest
ing articles, including an editorial ad
dressed to the rooters overconfidence.
"1 predict the Score," by Archie Spice,
'95, is a satire on Archie Rice's annual
prediction on the outcome of the game
and "Why Is Berkeley?" is one of the
clever adaptations of Wallace Irwin's
Japanese schoolboy letters.
H. C. Fisk, '09, contributes a full
page poem entitled: "Ye Verie Moral
Tale of Ye Ardent Digge," written in
the form of an old English ballad.
Another clever article is a take-off
on "Arms and the Man," staged re
cently by the English Club. G. F.
Morgan, '10, relates his experiences
with Palo Alto and San Jose majors.
A letter to the Faculty of the English
department is reproduced, purporting
to be from Hades.
Besides the football editorial is one
reviewing the ten years of "Chappie's"
reign. Another deals with the Plug
Ugly and the suspension of its com
mittee.
The art work is probably the best
collection of drawings ever appearing
in the Chaparral. Many are by Ran
dall Borough, '04, the designer of the
present cover. Other good cartoons
are the work of Stoops, S. K. Dixon,
*12, and D. H. Ferry, '08. V. F. Bel
lows, '09, has furnished a beautiful

halftone showing the Stanford girl
at the game.
The Chaparral announces the ap
pointment of H. C. Fisk, '09, former as
sociate editor of the Cornell Window,
to membership on the staff.
