# LAST LINE-UP SNAPPY
## VARSITY DEFEATS SUBSTITUTES BY SCORE OF 13-0. Cheda, Cadwalader and Faulkner Not In Game Today, But Will Be In Condition Saturday. 
### 
Before a large crowd of undergrad
uates the varsity defeated the second
fifteen in a ten minute line-up this
afternoon by a score of 13-0. The
game was fast and snappy through
out and was replete with many spec
tacular runs and backfield passing
rallies. The feature of the contest
was the gains made by the backs, the
three trys coming as the result of
passing' rushes.
The first score was made by Mit
chell after a pretty run. Crawford
failed to convert owing to the diffi
culty of the angle. Holman was re
sponsible for the next try, .running
fifteen yards through a scattered field
to the goal line. Crawford converted.
The last scoring was done by Evans
who was pushed over after a ruck
near the line. The try was again con
verted by Crawford.
The line-up of the varsity today,
which was practically the same as in
the Vancouver game, doubtless pres
ages the personnel of the fifteen that
will face California cn Saturday, sev
eral of the most likely candidates,
however, being out of the game on ac
count of injuries. Faulkner and Che
da were not fully recovered and did
not appear in the game today, but
will be in good physical condition by
Saturday. Cadwalader's knee is still
somewhat weak anc" although it is
expected that it will be strong enough
to enable him to play in the big game
he was kept out tonight. The varsity
line-up:
Koerner, Terrill, Dole, .Crawford,
Pemberton, Miller, Evans, forwards;
Heinly, wing forward; Erb, half;
Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Scott, center;
Cook, Holman, wings; Rrown, full.
