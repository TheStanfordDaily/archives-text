## Entries Being Received By H. Mann and L. B. Mackey-Playing Begins Next Week. 
### 
Entries are now being received for
the Thiele cup tennis tournament by
H. Mann, '10. This is to be a men's
handicap singles event and will be
open to anyone who has ever been
connected with the University. An
entrance fee of fifty cents will be
charged the contestants.
A new method of running a tourna
ment will be tried by having the men
draw promiscuously instead of the
halves of the drawing being separated
in two classes as heretofore. This
will give better practice to the lower
class men and will compensate for
any inequalities in their relative han
dicaps. These will be adjusted on the
basis of the present tournament when
necessary. The matches will be
started after the intercollegiate game.
