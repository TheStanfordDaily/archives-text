At 4:45 this afternoon Coach Pres
ley announced the personnel of the
fifteen that will appear against Cal
ifornia Saturday. The make-up of the
team is practically the same as in the
Vancouver games, the changes being
the substitution of Dole for Cheda
at lock and the replacing of Cook at
wing by Cadwalader. Of the other
contested positions, Evans will ap
pear at rear rank, while Faulkner
will play at full. The line-up follows:
(ran ford.
D. P. Crawford, '09, who captains
this year's varsity, is one of the most
aggressive men in the pack. He plays
at side rank, from which position he
directs the work of the scrum. His
200 pounds make him a tower of
strength in the scrum and in line-outs,
where his work is particularly effect
ive. His powerful build enables him
to force his way through the enemy's
lines for many material gains and he
leads in punting and kicking for
touch. Crawford played right tackle on
the 1905 eleven and on his Freshman
team. He was ineligible in 1906, but
was again in the Cardinal ranks last
year, holding down the side rank po
sition. As captain he has earned the
respect and confidence of all of his
men and has proved himself a worthy
successor to the long line of captains
that precede him. He has also been
identified with track, taking first in
the shot putin the 1907 meet He is 21
years old and measures 6 feet 2 1-2 in
ches in height. Crawford is a mem
of Encina Club, Skull and Snakes and
the Quadrangle Club. He is from
Cupertino and majors in Civil Engi
neering.
koerner.
\V. Koerner, '08, of Oregon City,
Oregon, will again appear at front
rank. His presence in the scrum adds
much to the efficiency of the forward
division as his playing is character
ized by headiness and aggressiveness.
His previous experience in this posi
tion has given him great dexterity in
hooking and dribbling and he can at
all times be relied upon, no matter
what the emergency. Koerner played
left end on the 12-5 eleven and filled
the front rank position in the 1906
and 1907 fifteens, having the honor of
captaining the latter team to victory
in last year's game. He is 22 years
old, tips the scales at 170 pounds and
is 5 feet 10 inches tall. He majors
in Geology and Mining and is a mem-

her of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
Terrill.
At the other front rank position will
be C. C. Terrill, '09, who registers in
Civil Engineering from San Francisco.
He is strong on both defense and of
fense and although never brilliant, he
plays a consistent, reliable game. His
dribbling is good and he is sure to
make many gains in this way. Ter
rill has played at front rank the en
tire season and works perfectly with
his partner, which is an important
qualification for this position. He
substituted for front rank last year
and was a member of the 1909 Fresh
man eleven. He is 22 years old, meas
ures 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and weighs
165 pounds. He is a member of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity.
Dole.
K. L. Dole will till the important
position of lock. Dole was not con
sidered a varsity possibility until the
second Vancouver game when he took
the place of Cheda, who was suffer
ing from an injured shoulder. His
powerful build combined with his ag
gressiveness renders him conspicu
ous in the work of the forwards. His
190 pounds make him an important
addition to the scrums and also ren
der him dangerous in the line-outs.
He is a hard fighter, his particular
forte being the ability to force his
way through the opposing pack. He
has been playing at this position on
the second team since the beginning
of the season and was also a member
of the 1911 Freshman fifteen. Dole
rowed on the winning Freshman crew
last spring and is a member of the
Stanford Gymnasium Club. He is 20
years old and measures ti feet, 1 inch
in height. He belongs to Beta Theta
I J i and majors in Systematic Botany
from Riverside.
IVmberton.
At the side rank position, opposite
Captain Crawford, will be .1. R. Pem
berton. '08, who registers in Geology
and Mining from Palo Alto. He is a
powerful player, particularly danger
ous in the scrum and in dribbling
rushes. He is untiring, always fol
lows the ball, and is strong in defense.
He played in the forward division of
the fifteen in the 6-8 and 21-11 games.
Pemberton has taken a leading part
