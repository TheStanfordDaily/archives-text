at lock and the replacing of Cook at
wing by Cadwalader. Of the other
contested positions, Evans will ap
pear at rear rank, while Faulkner
will play at full. The line-up follows:
(ran ford.
D. P. Crawford, '09, who captains
this year's varsity, is one of the most
aggressive men in the pack. He plays
at side rank, from which position he
directs the work of the scrum. His
200 pounds make him a tower of
strength in the scrum and in line-outs,
where his work is particularly effect
ive. His powerful build enables him
to force his way through the enemy's
lines for many material gains and he
leads in punting and kicking for
touch. Crawford played right tackle on
the 1905 eleven and on his Freshman
team. He was ineligible in 1906, but
was again in the Cardinal ranks last
year, holding down the side rank po
sition. As captain he has earned the
respect and confidence of all of his
men and has proved himself a worthy
successor to the long line of captains
that precede him. He has also been
identified with track, taking first in
the shot putin the 1907 meet He is 21
years old and measures 6 feet 2 1-2 in
ches in height. Crawford is a mem
of Encina Club, Skull and Snakes and
the Quadrangle Club. He is from
Cupertino and majors in Civil Engi
neering.
koerner.
\V. Koerner, '08, of Oregon City,
Oregon, will again appear at front
rank. His presence in the scrum adds
much to the efficiency of the forward
division as his playing is character
ized by headiness and aggressiveness.
His previous experience in this posi
tion has given him great dexterity in
hooking and dribbling and he can at
all times be relied upon, no matter
what the emergency. Koerner played
left end on the 12-5 eleven and filled
the front rank position in the 1906
and 1907 fifteens, having the honor of
captaining the latter team to victory
in last year's game. He is 22 years
old, tips the scales at 170 pounds and
is 5 feet 10 inches tall. He majors
in Geology and Mining and is a mem-

her of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
Terrill.
At the other front rank position will
be C. C. Terrill, '09, who registers in
Civil Engineering from San Francisco.
He is strong on both defense and of
fense and although never brilliant, he
plays a consistent, reliable game. His
dribbling is good and he is sure to
make many gains in this way. Ter
rill has played at front rank the en
tire season and works perfectly with
his partner, which is an important
qualification for this position. He
substituted for front rank last year
and was a member of the 1909 Fresh
man eleven. He is 22 years old, meas
ures 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and weighs
165 pounds. He is a member of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity.
Dole.
K. L. Dole will till the important
position of lock. Dole was not con
sidered a varsity possibility until the
second Vancouver game when he took
the place of Cheda, who was suffer
ing from an injured shoulder. His
powerful build combined with his ag
gressiveness renders him conspicu
ous in the work of the forwards. His
190 pounds make him an important
addition to the scrums and also ren
der him dangerous in the line-outs.
He is a hard fighter, his particular
forte being the ability to force his
way through the opposing pack. He
has been playing at this position on
the second team since the beginning
of the season and was also a member
of the 1911 Freshman fifteen. Dole
rowed on the winning Freshman crew
last spring and is a member of the
Stanford Gymnasium Club. He is 20
years old and measures ti feet, 1 inch
in height. He belongs to Beta Theta
I J i and majors in Systematic Botany
from Riverside.
IVmberton.
At the side rank position, opposite
Captain Crawford, will be .1. R. Pem
berton. '08, who registers in Geology
and Mining from Palo Alto. He is a
powerful player, particularly danger
ous in the scrum and in dribbling
rushes. He is untiring, always fol
lows the ball, and is strong in defense.
He played in the forward division of
the fifteen in the 6-8 and 21-11 games.
Pemberton has taken a leading part
in rowing, being a member of the var
sity crew in 1906, 1997 and 1908. He
rowed on the Portland four that fin
ished second in the international re
gatta held on Lake Quinsigamond in
1906. He is 0 feet 2 inches tall,
weighs 190 pounds and is 25 years old.
He belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull
and Snakes.
Miller.
J. O. Miller, '08, will again appear
at rear rank, having tilled the same
position onlast year's varsity. He is
the speediest man in the pack and is
especially valuable in a dribbling rush,
where his speed and aggressiveness
make him a dangerous opponent. His
height of 6 feet 1 inch gives him an
advantage in the line-outs which he
puts to good use. Miller first won re
nown in track athletics. He was first
in the 440 and the mile and took third
place in the 880 in the varsity inter
collegiate track meet in his Freshman
year, in the spring of 1907 he won
first in the half and third in the mile.
An injured foot kept him out of the
meet last year. He is 22 years old,
weighs 170 pounds, and majors in Civ-
Engineering from San Francisco.
Evans.
The other rear rank osition will be
played by C. 1?. Evans, '11, of Palo Al
to. He is a hard fighter and a worthy
partner for Miller. Evans won his
spurs last year when he played at
rear rank on the 1911 Freshman team,
proving himself one of the most re
liable men in the pack. He follows
the ball well, is a good dribbler, and a
dangerous man in the line-outs. He
is 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighs 175
pounds and is 19 years old. He is a
member of the Sign'a Nu fraternity
and claims Civil Engineering as his
major department.
Heinly.
IJ. G. Heinly, '09, will play the wing
forward position. Although weighing
but 127 pounds he i? one of the most
aggressive fighters on the squad. He
is particularly strong at dribbling and
follows the ball at all times. Heinly
has struggled hard and faithfully
since the introduction of Rugby to
make the team, but has hitherto been
successful only to the extent of win
ning a place on the side-lines. His
Work this year, however, clearly en
titles him to his position. He has play
ed on bis class teams the last two
years and substituted for Fenton in
the 21-11 game. He is 22 years old
and 5 feet 6 1-2 inches tall. Heinly
belongs to Sigma Nu and majors in
Law from Los Angeles.
Erb.
The only Freshman to achieve a
place on the 1908 varsity is B. E. Erb,
of Chemainus, British Columbia. He
is eminently qualified to fill this im
portant position, which requires above
everything else quickness and head
work. Upon him devolves the duty
of getting the ball out to the backs
and he has abundantly proven his abil
ity to meet this requirement. Erb is
a versatile kicker, being especially
skillful in finding touch, no matter
how hard pressed. He has played
Rugby previous to entering Stanford
and was a member of the 1912 Fresh
man fifteen. He is 17 years old, weighs
140 and is 5 feet 8 inches in height.
He registers in the department of Ge
ology and Mining.
Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
fills the position of first five-eighths.
lie is one of the strongest men on the
backfield, being powerful on defense
and exceptionally clever and aggres
sive on offense. His speediness and
heady playing make him invaluable
at this position, where he starts many
passing rallies that render the work
of the Cardinal backs so spectacular.
He is accurate and reliable and a sure
ground-gainer. He played on last
year's varsity and also on the 1910
Freshman fifteen. Mitchell is also
prominently identified with baseball,
serving as catcher for the varsity nine
last season. He weighs 170 pounds,
is 2i! years old and 5 feet 11 1-2 inches
in height. He majors in Economics
and belongs to Zeta Psi.
(warning.
At second five-eighths will be C. F.
Ganong, '10, who is a resident of Ore
gon City, majoring in Mechanical En
gineering. He is one of the most val
uable players in the backfield, being
a hard fighter and tackier. He is ac
curate in passing and catching the
ball and always takes a prominent
part in the backfield rushes. Ganong
played center three-quarters on his
Freshman team and held the position
of five on last year's varsity. He has
also taken an active part in base
ball, substituting for catcher on the
varsity in 1907 and playing a field
position on last year's nine. He was a
member of the Executive Committee
last year and belongs to Theta Delta
Chi. He tips the scales at 155 pounds,
is 21 years old and 5 feet 8 inches in
height.
Scott-
L. Scott, '10, is perhaps the find of
the season. His remarkable speedi
ness and his accuracy in catching and
passing the ball make him an ex
tremely valuable acquisition to the
backfield, where he will fill the posi
tion of center three-quarters. This
is Scott's first year on the football
field but his instant mastery of the
points of the game and his brilliant
offensive work easily won him a
place on the team. . He has been
prominent in baseball and track ath
letics since his Freshman year. He
was a member of the varsity nine for
two years, holding down a field posi
tion and second base in his first year
and playing third base last season. In

ches in height and is 21 years old.
Hoi man.

.1. It. Holman, '09, of Portland, whose
position on the team has been assured
from the first, lie is without doubt
the fastest man on (he fifteen and is
remarkably clever in running through
a scattered field. He uses his head at
all times and is never taken unawares.

and he was also captain and quarter
of the 1909 Freshman eleven. He has

Cadwalader.
T. It. Cadwalader, '09, of Los An

three-quarters. He hao been pre

juries that he has received, but his
known cleverness and reliability have
won him a position despite the fact
that he has been unable to appear in
any of the more important contests.
He is a consistent, heady player, a
good kicker, and is a fast man in a
scattered field. He played at full on
last year's fifteen, being shifted at the

Faulk liter.
G. C. Faulkner, '10, of San Luis

ment over that of previous seasons
has won him his position, for which
there was perhaps the closest rivalry
of the season. . He has developed in
to a hard tackier and he has the abil
ity of always being able to find touch
when necessary. Hiu punting always
results in substantial gains for the
Cardinal, and, although inclined to
be erratic at times, he is on the whole
a dependable player. Faulkner was a

during the last two years. He is 5
feet 9 1-2 inches tail, weighs 165

fifteen that will appear against Cal
ifornia Saturday. The make-up of the
team is practically the same as in the
Vancouver games, the changes being
the substitution of Dole for Cheda
at lock and the replacing of Cook at
wing by Cadwalader. Of the other
contested positions, Evans will ap
pear at rear rank, while Faulkner
will play at full. The line-up follows:
(ran ford.
D. P. Crawford, '09, who captains
this year's varsity, is one of the most
aggressive men in the pack. He plays
at side rank, from which position he
directs the work of the scrum. His
200 pounds make him a tower of
strength in the scrum and in line-outs,
where his work is particularly effect
ive. His powerful build enables him
to force his way through the enemy's
lines for many material gains and he
leads in punting and kicking for
touch. Crawford played right tackle on
the 1905 eleven and on his Freshman
team. He was ineligible in 1906, but
was again in the Cardinal ranks last
year, holding down the side rank po
sition. As captain he has earned the
respect and confidence of all of his
men and has proved himself a worthy
successor to the long line of captains
that precede him. He has also been
identified with track, taking first in
the shot putin the 1907 meet He is 21
years old and measures 6 feet 2 1-2 in
ches in height. Crawford is a mem
of Encina Club, Skull and Snakes and
the Quadrangle Club. He is from
Cupertino and majors in Civil Engi
neering.
koerner.
\V. Koerner, '08, of Oregon City,
Oregon, will again appear at front
rank. His presence in the scrum adds
much to the efficiency of the forward
division as his playing is character
ized by headiness and aggressiveness.
His previous experience in this posi
tion has given him great dexterity in
hooking and dribbling and he can at
all times be relied upon, no matter
what the emergency. Koerner played
left end on the 12-5 eleven and filled
the front rank position in the 1906
and 1907 fifteens, having the honor of
captaining the latter team to victory
in last year's game. He is 22 years
old, tips the scales at 170 pounds and
is 5 feet 10 inches tall. He majors
in Geology and Mining and is a mem-

her of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
Terrill.
At the other front rank position will
be C. C. Terrill, '09, who registers in
Civil Engineering from San Francisco.
He is strong on both defense and of
fense and although never brilliant, he
plays a consistent, reliable game. His
dribbling is good and he is sure to
make many gains in this way. Ter
rill has played at front rank the en
tire season and works perfectly with
his partner, which is an important
qualification for this position. He
substituted for front rank last year
and was a member of the 1909 Fresh
man eleven. He is 22 years old, meas
ures 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and weighs
165 pounds. He is a member of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity.
Dole.
K. L. Dole will till the important
position of lock. Dole was not con
sidered a varsity possibility until the
second Vancouver game when he took
the place of Cheda, who was suffer
ing from an injured shoulder. His
powerful build combined with his ag
gressiveness renders him conspicu
ous in the work of the forwards. His
190 pounds make him an important
addition to the scrums and also ren
der him dangerous in the line-outs.
He is a hard fighter, his particular
forte being the ability to force his
way through the opposing pack. He
has been playing at this position on
the second team since the beginning
of the season and was also a member
of the 1911 Freshman fifteen. Dole
rowed on the winning Freshman crew
last spring and is a member of the
Stanford Gymnasium Club. He is 20
years old and measures ti feet, 1 inch
in height. He belongs to Beta Theta
I J i and majors in Systematic Botany
from Riverside.
IVmberton.
At the side rank position, opposite
Captain Crawford, will be .1. R. Pem
berton. '08, who registers in Geology
and Mining from Palo Alto. He is a
powerful player, particularly danger
ous in the scrum and in dribbling
rushes. He is untiring, always fol
lows the ball, and is strong in defense.
He played in the forward division of
the fifteen in the 6-8 and 21-11 games.
Pemberton has taken a leading part
in rowing, being a member of the var
sity crew in 1906, 1997 and 1908. He
rowed on the Portland four that fin
ished second in the international re
gatta held on Lake Quinsigamond in
1906. He is 0 feet 2 inches tall,
weighs 190 pounds and is 25 years old.
He belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull
and Snakes.
Miller.
J. O. Miller, '08, will again appear
at rear rank, having tilled the same
position onlast year's varsity. He is
the speediest man in the pack and is
especially valuable in a dribbling rush,
where his speed and aggressiveness
make him a dangerous opponent. His
height of 6 feet 1 inch gives him an
advantage in the line-outs which he
puts to good use. Miller first won re
nown in track athletics. He was first
in the 440 and the mile and took third
place in the 880 in the varsity inter
collegiate track meet in his Freshman
year, in the spring of 1907 he won
first in the half and third in the mile.
An injured foot kept him out of the
meet last year. He is 22 years old,
weighs 170 pounds, and majors in Civ-
Engineering from San Francisco.
Evans.
The other rear rank osition will be
played by C. 1?. Evans, '11, of Palo Al
to. He is a hard fighter and a worthy
partner for Miller. Evans won his
spurs last year when he played at
rear rank on the 1911 Freshman team,
proving himself one of the most re
liable men in the pack. He follows
the ball well, is a good dribbler, and a
dangerous man in the line-outs. He
is 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighs 175
pounds and is 19 years old. He is a
member of the Sign'a Nu fraternity
and claims Civil Engineering as his
major department.
Heinly.
IJ. G. Heinly, '09, will play the wing
forward position. Although weighing
but 127 pounds he i? one of the most
aggressive fighters on the squad. He
is particularly strong at dribbling and
follows the ball at all times. Heinly
has struggled hard and faithfully
since the introduction of Rugby to
make the team, but has hitherto been
successful only to the extent of win
ning a place on the side-lines. His
Work this year, however, clearly en
titles him to his position. He has play
ed on bis class teams the last two
years and substituted for Fenton in
the 21-11 game. He is 22 years old
and 5 feet 6 1-2 inches tall. Heinly
belongs to Sigma Nu and majors in
Law from Los Angeles.
Erb.
The only Freshman to achieve a
place on the 1908 varsity is B. E. Erb,
of Chemainus, British Columbia. He
is eminently qualified to fill this im
portant position, which requires above
everything else quickness and head
work. Upon him devolves the duty
of getting the ball out to the backs
and he has abundantly proven his abil
ity to meet this requirement. Erb is
a versatile kicker, being especially
skillful in finding touch, no matter
how hard pressed. He has played
Rugby previous to entering Stanford
and was a member of the 1912 Fresh
man fifteen. He is 17 years old, weighs
140 and is 5 feet 8 inches in height.
He registers in the department of Ge
ology and Mining.
Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
fills the position of first five-eighths.
lie is one of the strongest men on the
backfield, being powerful on defense
and exceptionally clever and aggres
sive on offense. His speediness and
heady playing make him invaluable
at this position, where he starts many
passing rallies that render the work
of the Cardinal backs so spectacular.
He is accurate and reliable and a sure
ground-gainer. He played on last
year's varsity and also on the 1910
Freshman fifteen. Mitchell is also
prominently identified with baseball,
serving as catcher for the varsity nine
last season. He weighs 170 pounds,
is 2i! years old and 5 feet 11 1-2 inches
in height. He majors in Economics
and belongs to Zeta Psi.
(warning.
At second five-eighths will be C. F.
Ganong, '10, who is a resident of Ore
gon City, majoring in Mechanical En
gineering. He is one of the most val
uable players in the backfield, being
a hard fighter and tackier. He is ac
curate in passing and catching the
ball and always takes a prominent
part in the backfield rushes. Ganong
played center three-quarters on his
Freshman team and held the position
of five on last year's varsity. He has
also taken an active part in base
ball, substituting for catcher on the
varsity in 1907 and playing a field
position on last year's nine. He was a
member of the Executive Committee
last year and belongs to Theta Delta
Chi. He tips the scales at 155 pounds,
is 21 years old and 5 feet 8 inches in
height.
Scott-
L. Scott, '10, is perhaps the find of
the season. His remarkable speedi
ness and his accuracy in catching and
passing the ball make him an ex
tremely valuable acquisition to the
backfield, where he will fill the posi
tion of center three-quarters. This
is Scott's first year on the football
field but his instant mastery of the
points of the game and his brilliant
offensive work easily won him a
place on the team. . He has been
prominent in baseball and track ath
letics since his Freshman year. He
was a member of the varsity nine for
two years, holding down a field posi
tion and second base in his first year
and playing third base last season. In
his Freshman year he took second in
the broad jump in the intercollegiate
meet and he tied for second place in
the pole vault last year. He regis
ters from Alameda in Architectural
Drawing and is a member of Delta
Kappa Epsilon. He tips the beam at
155 pounds, measures 5 feet 10 in
ches in height and is 21 years old.
Hoi man.
At right wing three-quarters will be
.1. It. Holman, '09, of Portland, whose
position on the team has been assured
from the first, lie is without doubt
the fastest man on (he fifteen and is
remarkably clever in running through
a scattered field. He uses his head at
all times and is never taken unawares.
This is his third year at this position
and he was also captain and quarter
of the 1909 Freshman eleven. He has
made a record in track, having taken
second in the 100 and 220 last April,
and third in the same events in the
1907 meet. He is 21 years old, weighs
173 pounds and is (! feet in height,
lie majors in Electrical Engineering
and belongs to Zeta Psi.
Cadwalader.
T. It. Cadwalader, '09, of Los An
geles, will fill the place at left wins

three-quarters. He hao been pre
vented from playing at most of the
games this season by reason of in
juries that he has received, but his
known cleverness and reliability have
won him a position despite the fact
that he has been unable to appear in
any of the more important contests.
He is a consistent, heady player, a
good kicker, and is a fast man in a
scattered field. He played at full on
last year's fifteen, being shifted at the
last moment to that position from
wing, where he played most of the
season.' Cadwalader was a member
of the varsity nine in 1906 and again

Pi fraternity and majors in Econom
ics.
Faulk liter.
G. C. Faulkner, '10, of San Luis
Obispo, will appear at full. His work
which has shown a marked improve
ment over that of previous seasons
has won him his position, for which
there was perhaps the closest rivalry
of the season. . He has developed in
to a hard tackier and he has the abil
ity of always being able to find touch
when necessary. Hiu punting always
results in substantial gains for the
Cardinal, and, although inclined to
be erratic at times, he is on the whole
a dependable player. Faulkner was a
member of the 1910 Freshman fifteen
and has also played on his class teams
during the last two years. He is 5
feet 9 1-2 inches tail, weighs 165
pounds and is 21 years old. He is a

Obispo, will appear at full. His work
which has shown a marked improve
ment over that of previous seasons
has won him his position, for which
there was perhaps the closest rivalry
of the season. . He has developed in
to a hard tackier and he has the abil
ity of always being able to find touch
when necessary. Hiu punting always
results in substantial gains for the
Cardinal, and, although inclined to
be erratic at times, he is on the whole
a dependable player. Faulkner was a
member of the 1910 Freshman fifteen
and has also played on his class teams
during the last two years. He is 5
feet 9 1-2 inches tail, weighs 165
pounds and is 21 years old. He is a

ifornia Saturday. The make-up of the
team is practically the same as in the
Vancouver games, the changes being
the substitution of Dole for Cheda
at lock and the replacing of Cook at
wing by Cadwalader. Of the other
contested positions, Evans will ap
pear at rear rank, while Faulkner
will play at full. The line-up follows:
(ran ford.
D. P. Crawford, '09, who captains
this year's varsity, is one of the most
aggressive men in the pack. He plays
at side rank, from which position he
directs the work of the scrum. His
200 pounds make him a tower of
strength in the scrum and in line-outs,
where his work is particularly effect
ive. His powerful build enables him
to force his way through the enemy's
lines for many material gains and he
leads in punting and kicking for
touch. Crawford played right tackle on
the 1905 eleven and on his Freshman
team. He was ineligible in 1906, but
was again in the Cardinal ranks last
year, holding down the side rank po
sition. As captain he has earned the
respect and confidence of all of his
men and has proved himself a worthy
successor to the long line of captains
that precede him. He has also been
identified with track, taking first in
the shot putin the 1907 meet He is 21
years old and measures 6 feet 2 1-2 in
ches in height. Crawford is a mem
of Encina Club, Skull and Snakes and
the Quadrangle Club. He is from
Cupertino and majors in Civil Engi
neering.
koerner.
\V. Koerner, '08, of Oregon City,
Oregon, will again appear at front
rank. His presence in the scrum adds
much to the efficiency of the forward
division as his playing is character
ized by headiness and aggressiveness.
His previous experience in this posi
tion has given him great dexterity in
hooking and dribbling and he can at
all times be relied upon, no matter
what the emergency. Koerner played
left end on the 12-5 eleven and filled
the front rank position in the 1906
and 1907 fifteens, having the honor of
captaining the latter team to victory
in last year's game. He is 22 years
old, tips the scales at 170 pounds and
is 5 feet 10 inches tall. He majors
in Geology and Mining and is a mem-

her of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
Terrill.
At the other front rank position will
be C. C. Terrill, '09, who registers in
Civil Engineering from San Francisco.
He is strong on both defense and of
fense and although never brilliant, he
plays a consistent, reliable game. His
dribbling is good and he is sure to
make many gains in this way. Ter
rill has played at front rank the en
tire season and works perfectly with
his partner, which is an important
qualification for this position. He
substituted for front rank last year
and was a member of the 1909 Fresh
man eleven. He is 22 years old, meas
ures 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and weighs
165 pounds. He is a member of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity.
Dole.
K. L. Dole will till the important
position of lock. Dole was not con
sidered a varsity possibility until the
second Vancouver game when he took
the place of Cheda, who was suffer
ing from an injured shoulder. His
powerful build combined with his ag
gressiveness renders him conspicu
ous in the work of the forwards. His
190 pounds make him an important
addition to the scrums and also ren
der him dangerous in the line-outs.
He is a hard fighter, his particular
forte being the ability to force his
way through the opposing pack. He
has been playing at this position on
the second team since the beginning
of the season and was also a member
of the 1911 Freshman fifteen. Dole
rowed on the winning Freshman crew
last spring and is a member of the
Stanford Gymnasium Club. He is 20
years old and measures ti feet, 1 inch
in height. He belongs to Beta Theta
I J i and majors in Systematic Botany
from Riverside.
IVmberton.
At the side rank position, opposite
Captain Crawford, will be .1. R. Pem
berton. '08, who registers in Geology
and Mining from Palo Alto. He is a
powerful player, particularly danger
ous in the scrum and in dribbling
rushes. He is untiring, always fol
lows the ball, and is strong in defense.
He played in the forward division of
the fifteen in the 6-8 and 21-11 games.
Pemberton has taken a leading part
in rowing, being a member of the var
sity crew in 1906, 1997 and 1908. He
rowed on the Portland four that fin
ished second in the international re
gatta held on Lake Quinsigamond in
1906. He is 0 feet 2 inches tall,
weighs 190 pounds and is 25 years old.
He belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull
and Snakes.
Miller.
J. O. Miller, '08, will again appear
at rear rank, having tilled the same
position onlast year's varsity. He is
the speediest man in the pack and is
especially valuable in a dribbling rush,
where his speed and aggressiveness
make him a dangerous opponent. His
height of 6 feet 1 inch gives him an
advantage in the line-outs which he
puts to good use. Miller first won re
nown in track athletics. He was first
in the 440 and the mile and took third
place in the 880 in the varsity inter
collegiate track meet in his Freshman
year, in the spring of 1907 he won
first in the half and third in the mile.
An injured foot kept him out of the
meet last year. He is 22 years old,
weighs 170 pounds, and majors in Civ-
Engineering from San Francisco.
Evans.
The other rear rank osition will be
played by C. 1?. Evans, '11, of Palo Al
to. He is a hard fighter and a worthy
partner for Miller. Evans won his
spurs last year when he played at
rear rank on the 1911 Freshman team,
proving himself one of the most re
liable men in the pack. He follows
the ball well, is a good dribbler, and a
dangerous man in the line-outs. He
is 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighs 175
pounds and is 19 years old. He is a
member of the Sign'a Nu fraternity
and claims Civil Engineering as his
major department.
Heinly.
IJ. G. Heinly, '09, will play the wing
forward position. Although weighing
but 127 pounds he i? one of the most
aggressive fighters on the squad. He
is particularly strong at dribbling and
follows the ball at all times. Heinly
has struggled hard and faithfully
since the introduction of Rugby to
make the team, but has hitherto been
successful only to the extent of win
ning a place on the side-lines. His
Work this year, however, clearly en
titles him to his position. He has play
ed on bis class teams the last two
years and substituted for Fenton in
the 21-11 game. He is 22 years old
and 5 feet 6 1-2 inches tall. Heinly
belongs to Sigma Nu and majors in
Law from Los Angeles.
Erb.
The only Freshman to achieve a
place on the 1908 varsity is B. E. Erb,
of Chemainus, British Columbia. He
is eminently qualified to fill this im
portant position, which requires above
everything else quickness and head
work. Upon him devolves the duty
of getting the ball out to the backs
and he has abundantly proven his abil
ity to meet this requirement. Erb is
a versatile kicker, being especially
skillful in finding touch, no matter
how hard pressed. He has played
Rugby previous to entering Stanford
and was a member of the 1912 Fresh
man fifteen. He is 17 years old, weighs
140 and is 5 feet 8 inches in height.
He registers in the department of Ge
ology and Mining.
Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
fills the position of first five-eighths.
lie is one of the strongest men on the
backfield, being powerful on defense
and exceptionally clever and aggres
sive on offense. His speediness and
heady playing make him invaluable
at this position, where he starts many
passing rallies that render the work
of the Cardinal backs so spectacular.
He is accurate and reliable and a sure
ground-gainer. He played on last
year's varsity and also on the 1910
Freshman fifteen. Mitchell is also
prominently identified with baseball,
serving as catcher for the varsity nine
last season. He weighs 170 pounds,
is 2i! years old and 5 feet 11 1-2 inches
in height. He majors in Economics
and belongs to Zeta Psi.
(warning.
At second five-eighths will be C. F.
Ganong, '10, who is a resident of Ore
gon City, majoring in Mechanical En
gineering. He is one of the most val
uable players in the backfield, being
a hard fighter and tackier. He is ac
curate in passing and catching the
ball and always takes a prominent
part in the backfield rushes. Ganong
played center three-quarters on his
Freshman team and held the position
of five on last year's varsity. He has
also taken an active part in base
ball, substituting for catcher on the
varsity in 1907 and playing a field
position on last year's nine. He was a
member of the Executive Committee
last year and belongs to Theta Delta
Chi. He tips the scales at 155 pounds,
is 21 years old and 5 feet 8 inches in
height.
Scott-
L. Scott, '10, is perhaps the find of
the season. His remarkable speedi
ness and his accuracy in catching and
passing the ball make him an ex
tremely valuable acquisition to the
backfield, where he will fill the posi
tion of center three-quarters. This
is Scott's first year on the football
field but his instant mastery of the
points of the game and his brilliant
offensive work easily won him a
place on the team. . He has been
prominent in baseball and track ath
letics since his Freshman year. He
was a member of the varsity nine for
two years, holding down a field posi
tion and second base in his first year
and playing third base last season. In
his Freshman year he took second in
the broad jump in the intercollegiate
meet and he tied for second place in

155 pounds, measures 5 feet 10 in
ches in height and is 21 years old.
Hoi man.
At right wing three-quarters will be
.1. It. Holman, '09, of Portland, whose
position on the team has been assured
from the first, lie is without doubt
the fastest man on (he fifteen and is
remarkably clever in running through
a scattered field. He uses his head at
all times and is never taken unawares.
This is his third year at this position
and he was also captain and quarter
of the 1909 Freshman eleven. He has
made a record in track, having taken

and belongs to Zeta Psi.
Cadwalader.
T. It. Cadwalader, '09, of Los An
geles, will fill the place at left wins

three-quarters. He hao been pre
vented from playing at most of the
games this season by reason of in
juries that he has received, but his
known cleverness and reliability have
won him a position despite the fact
that he has been unable to appear in
any of the more important contests.
He is a consistent, heady player, a
good kicker, and is a fast man in a
scattered field. He played at full on
last year's fifteen, being shifted at the
last moment to that position from
wing, where he played most of the
season.' Cadwalader was a member
of the varsity nine in 1906 and again

Cadwalader.
T. It. Cadwalader, '09, of Los An
geles, will fill the place at left wins

three-quarters. He hao been pre
vented from playing at most of the

known cleverness and reliability have
won him a position despite the fact
that he has been unable to appear in
any of the more important contests.
He is a consistent, heady player, a
good kicker, and is a fast man in a
scattered field. He played at full on
last year's fifteen, being shifted at the
last moment to that position from

Faulk liter.
G. C. Faulkner, '10, of San Luis
Obispo, will appear at full. His work
which has shown a marked improve
ment over that of previous seasons
has won him his position, for which
there was perhaps the closest rivalry
of the season. . He has developed in
to a hard tackier and he has the abil
ity of always being able to find touch
when necessary. Hiu punting always
results in substantial gains for the
Cardinal, and, although inclined to
be erratic at times, he is on the whole
a dependable player. Faulkner was a

Vancouver games, the changes being
the substitution of Dole for Cheda
at lock and the replacing of Cook at
wing by Cadwalader. Of the other
contested positions, Evans will ap
pear at rear rank, while Faulkner
will play at full. The line-up follows:
(ran ford.
D. P. Crawford, '09, who captains
this year's varsity, is one of the most
aggressive men in the pack. He plays
at side rank, from which position he
directs the work of the scrum. His
200 pounds make him a tower of
strength in the scrum and in line-outs,
where his work is particularly effect
ive. His powerful build enables him
to force his way through the enemy's
lines for many material gains and he
leads in punting and kicking for
touch. Crawford played right tackle on
the 1905 eleven and on his Freshman
team. He was ineligible in 1906, but
was again in the Cardinal ranks last
year, holding down the side rank po
sition. As captain he has earned the
respect and confidence of all of his
men and has proved himself a worthy
successor to the long line of captains
that precede him. He has also been
identified with track, taking first in
the shot putin the 1907 meet He is 21
years old and measures 6 feet 2 1-2 in
ches in height. Crawford is a mem
of Encina Club, Skull and Snakes and
the Quadrangle Club. He is from
Cupertino and majors in Civil Engi
neering.
koerner.
\V. Koerner, '08, of Oregon City,
Oregon, will again appear at front
rank. His presence in the scrum adds
much to the efficiency of the forward
division as his playing is character
ized by headiness and aggressiveness.
His previous experience in this posi
tion has given him great dexterity in
hooking and dribbling and he can at
all times be relied upon, no matter
what the emergency. Koerner played
left end on the 12-5 eleven and filled
the front rank position in the 1906
and 1907 fifteens, having the honor of
captaining the latter team to victory
in last year's game. He is 22 years
old, tips the scales at 170 pounds and
is 5 feet 10 inches tall. He majors
in Geology and Mining and is a mem-

her of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
Terrill.
At the other front rank position will
be C. C. Terrill, '09, who registers in
Civil Engineering from San Francisco.
He is strong on both defense and of
fense and although never brilliant, he
plays a consistent, reliable game. His
dribbling is good and he is sure to
make many gains in this way. Ter
rill has played at front rank the en
tire season and works perfectly with
his partner, which is an important
qualification for this position. He
substituted for front rank last year
and was a member of the 1909 Fresh
man eleven. He is 22 years old, meas
ures 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and weighs
165 pounds. He is a member of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity.
Dole.
K. L. Dole will till the important
position of lock. Dole was not con
sidered a varsity possibility until the
second Vancouver game when he took
the place of Cheda, who was suffer
ing from an injured shoulder. His
powerful build combined with his ag
gressiveness renders him conspicu
ous in the work of the forwards. His
190 pounds make him an important
addition to the scrums and also ren
der him dangerous in the line-outs.
He is a hard fighter, his particular
forte being the ability to force his
way through the opposing pack. He
has been playing at this position on
the second team since the beginning
of the season and was also a member
of the 1911 Freshman fifteen. Dole
rowed on the winning Freshman crew
last spring and is a member of the
Stanford Gymnasium Club. He is 20
years old and measures ti feet, 1 inch
in height. He belongs to Beta Theta
I J i and majors in Systematic Botany
from Riverside.
IVmberton.
At the side rank position, opposite
Captain Crawford, will be .1. R. Pem
berton. '08, who registers in Geology
and Mining from Palo Alto. He is a
powerful player, particularly danger
ous in the scrum and in dribbling
rushes. He is untiring, always fol
lows the ball, and is strong in defense.
He played in the forward division of
the fifteen in the 6-8 and 21-11 games.
Pemberton has taken a leading part
in rowing, being a member of the var
sity crew in 1906, 1997 and 1908. He
rowed on the Portland four that fin
ished second in the international re
gatta held on Lake Quinsigamond in
1906. He is 0 feet 2 inches tall,
weighs 190 pounds and is 25 years old.
He belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull
and Snakes.
Miller.
J. O. Miller, '08, will again appear
at rear rank, having tilled the same
position onlast year's varsity. He is
the speediest man in the pack and is
especially valuable in a dribbling rush,
where his speed and aggressiveness
make him a dangerous opponent. His
height of 6 feet 1 inch gives him an
advantage in the line-outs which he
puts to good use. Miller first won re
nown in track athletics. He was first
in the 440 and the mile and took third
place in the 880 in the varsity inter
collegiate track meet in his Freshman
year, in the spring of 1907 he won
first in the half and third in the mile.
An injured foot kept him out of the
meet last year. He is 22 years old,
weighs 170 pounds, and majors in Civ-
Engineering from San Francisco.
Evans.
The other rear rank osition will be
played by C. 1?. Evans, '11, of Palo Al
to. He is a hard fighter and a worthy
partner for Miller. Evans won his
spurs last year when he played at
rear rank on the 1911 Freshman team,
proving himself one of the most re
liable men in the pack. He follows
the ball well, is a good dribbler, and a
dangerous man in the line-outs. He
is 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighs 175
pounds and is 19 years old. He is a
member of the Sign'a Nu fraternity
and claims Civil Engineering as his
major department.
Heinly.
IJ. G. Heinly, '09, will play the wing
forward position. Although weighing
but 127 pounds he i? one of the most
aggressive fighters on the squad. He
is particularly strong at dribbling and
follows the ball at all times. Heinly
has struggled hard and faithfully
since the introduction of Rugby to
make the team, but has hitherto been
successful only to the extent of win
ning a place on the side-lines. His
Work this year, however, clearly en
titles him to his position. He has play
ed on bis class teams the last two
years and substituted for Fenton in
the 21-11 game. He is 22 years old
and 5 feet 6 1-2 inches tall. Heinly
belongs to Sigma Nu and majors in
Law from Los Angeles.
Erb.
The only Freshman to achieve a
place on the 1908 varsity is B. E. Erb,
of Chemainus, British Columbia. He
is eminently qualified to fill this im
portant position, which requires above
everything else quickness and head
work. Upon him devolves the duty
of getting the ball out to the backs
and he has abundantly proven his abil
ity to meet this requirement. Erb is
a versatile kicker, being especially
skillful in finding touch, no matter
how hard pressed. He has played
Rugby previous to entering Stanford
and was a member of the 1912 Fresh
man fifteen. He is 17 years old, weighs
140 and is 5 feet 8 inches in height.
He registers in the department of Ge
ology and Mining.
Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
fills the position of first five-eighths.
lie is one of the strongest men on the
backfield, being powerful on defense
and exceptionally clever and aggres
sive on offense. His speediness and
heady playing make him invaluable
at this position, where he starts many
passing rallies that render the work
of the Cardinal backs so spectacular.
He is accurate and reliable and a sure
ground-gainer. He played on last
year's varsity and also on the 1910
Freshman fifteen. Mitchell is also
prominently identified with baseball,
serving as catcher for the varsity nine
last season. He weighs 170 pounds,
is 2i! years old and 5 feet 11 1-2 inches
in height. He majors in Economics
and belongs to Zeta Psi.
(warning.

Ganong, '10, who is a resident of Ore
gon City, majoring in Mechanical En
gineering. He is one of the most val
uable players in the backfield, being
a hard fighter and tackier. He is ac
curate in passing and catching the
ball and always takes a prominent
part in the backfield rushes. Ganong
played center three-quarters on his
Freshman team and held the position
of five on last year's varsity. He has
also taken an active part in base
ball, substituting for catcher on the
varsity in 1907 and playing a field
position on last year's nine. He was a
member of the Executive Committee
last year and belongs to Theta Delta
Chi. He tips the scales at 155 pounds,
is 21 years old and 5 feet 8 inches in
height.
Scott-
L. Scott, '10, is perhaps the find of
the season. His remarkable speedi
ness and his accuracy in catching and
passing the ball make him an ex
tremely valuable acquisition to the
backfield, where he will fill the posi
tion of center three-quarters. This
is Scott's first year on the football
field but his instant mastery of the
points of the game and his brilliant
offensive work easily won him a
place on the team. . He has been
prominent in baseball and track ath
letics since his Freshman year. He
was a member of the varsity nine for
two years, holding down a field posi

Cadwalader.
T. It. Cadwalader, '09, of Los An
geles, will fill the place at left wins

three-quarters. He hao been pre
vented from playing at most of the
games this season by reason of in
juries that he has received, but his
known cleverness and reliability have
won him a position despite the fact
that he has been unable to appear in
any of the more important contests.
He is a consistent, heady player, a
good kicker, and is a fast man in a
scattered field. He played at full on
last year's fifteen, being shifted at the
last moment to that position from
wing, where he played most of the
season.' Cadwalader was a member

Faulk liter.
G. C. Faulkner, '10, of San Luis
Obispo, will appear at full. His work
which has shown a marked improve
ment over that of previous seasons
has won him his position, for which
there was perhaps the closest rivalry
of the season. . He has developed in
to a hard tackier and he has the abil
ity of always being able to find touch
when necessary. Hiu punting always
results in substantial gains for the
Cardinal, and, although inclined to
be erratic at times, he is on the whole
a dependable player. Faulkner was a

and has also played on his class teams
during the last two years. He is 5
feet 9 1-2 inches tail, weighs 165

Vancouver games, the changes being
the substitution of Dole for Cheda
at lock and the replacing of Cook at
wing by Cadwalader. Of the other
contested positions, Evans will ap
pear at rear rank, while Faulkner
will play at full. The line-up follows:
(ran ford.
D. P. Crawford, '09, who captains
this year's varsity, is one of the most
aggressive men in the pack. He plays
at side rank, from which position he
directs the work of the scrum. His
200 pounds make him a tower of
strength in the scrum and in line-outs,
where his work is particularly effect
ive. His powerful build enables him
to force his way through the enemy's
lines for many material gains and he
leads in punting and kicking for
touch. Crawford played right tackle on
the 1905 eleven and on his Freshman
team. He was ineligible in 1906, but
was again in the Cardinal ranks last
year, holding down the side rank po
sition. As captain he has earned the
respect and confidence of all of his
men and has proved himself a worthy
successor to the long line of captains
that precede him. He has also been
identified with track, taking first in
the shot putin the 1907 meet He is 21
years old and measures 6 feet 2 1-2 in
ches in height. Crawford is a mem
of Encina Club, Skull and Snakes and
the Quadrangle Club. He is from
Cupertino and majors in Civil Engi
neering.
koerner.
\V. Koerner, '08, of Oregon City,
Oregon, will again appear at front
rank. His presence in the scrum adds
much to the efficiency of the forward
division as his playing is character
ized by headiness and aggressiveness.
His previous experience in this posi
tion has given him great dexterity in
hooking and dribbling and he can at
all times be relied upon, no matter
what the emergency. Koerner played
left end on the 12-5 eleven and filled
the front rank position in the 1906
and 1907 fifteens, having the honor of
captaining the latter team to victory
in last year's game. He is 22 years
old, tips the scales at 170 pounds and
is 5 feet 10 inches tall. He majors
in Geology and Mining and is a mem-

her of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
Terrill.
At the other front rank position will
be C. C. Terrill, '09, who registers in
Civil Engineering from San Francisco.
He is strong on both defense and of
fense and although never brilliant, he
plays a consistent, reliable game. His
dribbling is good and he is sure to
make many gains in this way. Ter
rill has played at front rank the en
tire season and works perfectly with
his partner, which is an important
qualification for this position. He
substituted for front rank last year
and was a member of the 1909 Fresh
man eleven. He is 22 years old, meas
ures 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and weighs
165 pounds. He is a member of the
Kappa Alpha fraternity.
Dole.
K. L. Dole will till the important
position of lock. Dole was not con
sidered a varsity possibility until the
second Vancouver game when he took
the place of Cheda, who was suffer
ing from an injured shoulder. His
powerful build combined with his ag
gressiveness renders him conspicu
ous in the work of the forwards. His
190 pounds make him an important
addition to the scrums and also ren
der him dangerous in the line-outs.
He is a hard fighter, his particular
forte being the ability to force his
way through the opposing pack. He
has been playing at this position on
the second team since the beginning
of the season and was also a member
of the 1911 Freshman fifteen. Dole
rowed on the winning Freshman crew
last spring and is a member of the
Stanford Gymnasium Club. He is 20
years old and measures ti feet, 1 inch
in height. He belongs to Beta Theta
I J i and majors in Systematic Botany
from Riverside.
IVmberton.
At the side rank position, opposite
Captain Crawford, will be .1. R. Pem
berton. '08, who registers in Geology
and Mining from Palo Alto. He is a
powerful player, particularly danger
ous in the scrum and in dribbling
rushes. He is untiring, always fol
lows the ball, and is strong in defense.
He played in the forward division of
the fifteen in the 6-8 and 21-11 games.
Pemberton has taken a leading part
in rowing, being a member of the var
sity crew in 1906, 1997 and 1908. He
rowed on the Portland four that fin
ished second in the international re
gatta held on Lake Quinsigamond in
1906. He is 0 feet 2 inches tall,
weighs 190 pounds and is 25 years old.
He belongs to Kappa Alpha and Skull
and Snakes.
Miller.
J. O. Miller, '08, will again appear
at rear rank, having tilled the same
position onlast year's varsity. He is
the speediest man in the pack and is
especially valuable in a dribbling rush,
where his speed and aggressiveness
make him a dangerous opponent. His
height of 6 feet 1 inch gives him an
advantage in the line-outs which he
puts to good use. Miller first won re
nown in track athletics. He was first
in the 440 and the mile and took third
place in the 880 in the varsity inter
collegiate track meet in his Freshman
year, in the spring of 1907 he won
first in the half and third in the mile.
An injured foot kept him out of the
meet last year. He is 22 years old,
weighs 170 pounds, and majors in Civ-
Engineering from San Francisco.
Evans.
The other rear rank osition will be
played by C. 1?. Evans, '11, of Palo Al
to. He is a hard fighter and a worthy
partner for Miller. Evans won his
spurs last year when he played at
rear rank on the 1911 Freshman team,
proving himself one of the most re
liable men in the pack. He follows
the ball well, is a good dribbler, and a
dangerous man in the line-outs. He
is 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighs 175
pounds and is 19 years old. He is a
member of the Sign'a Nu fraternity
and claims Civil Engineering as his
major department.
Heinly.
IJ. G. Heinly, '09, will play the wing
forward position. Although weighing
but 127 pounds he i? one of the most
aggressive fighters on the squad. He
is particularly strong at dribbling and
follows the ball at all times. Heinly
has struggled hard and faithfully
since the introduction of Rugby to
make the team, but has hitherto been
successful only to the extent of win
ning a place on the side-lines. His
Work this year, however, clearly en
titles him to his position. He has play
ed on bis class teams the last two
years and substituted for Fenton in
the 21-11 game. He is 22 years old
and 5 feet 6 1-2 inches tall. Heinly
belongs to Sigma Nu and majors in
Law from Los Angeles.
Erb.
The only Freshman to achieve a
place on the 1908 varsity is B. E. Erb,
of Chemainus, British Columbia. He
is eminently qualified to fill this im
portant position, which requires above
everything else quickness and head
work. Upon him devolves the duty
of getting the ball out to the backs
and he has abundantly proven his abil
ity to meet this requirement. Erb is
a versatile kicker, being especially
skillful in finding touch, no matter
how hard pressed. He has played
Rugby previous to entering Stanford
and was a member of the 1912 Fresh
man fifteen. He is 17 years old, weighs
140 and is 5 feet 8 inches in height.
He registers in the department of Ge
ology and Mining.
Mitchell.
M. M. Mitchell, '10, of Los Angeles,
fills the position of first five-eighths.
lie is one of the strongest men on the
backfield, being powerful on defense
and exceptionally clever and aggres
sive on offense. His speediness and
heady playing make him invaluable
at this position, where he starts many
passing rallies that render the work
of the Cardinal backs so spectacular.
He is accurate and reliable and a sure
ground-gainer. He played on last
year's varsity and also on the 1910
Freshman fifteen. Mitchell is also
prominently identified with baseball,
serving as catcher for the varsity nine
last season. He weighs 170 pounds,
is 2i! years old and 5 feet 11 1-2 inches
in height. He majors in Economics
and belongs to Zeta Psi.
(warning.
At second five-eighths will be C. F.
Ganong, '10, who is a resident of Ore
gon City, majoring in Mechanical En
gineering. He is one of the most val
uable players in the backfield, being
a hard fighter and tackier. He is ac
curate in passing and catching the
ball and always takes a prominent
part in the backfield rushes. Ganong
played center three-quarters on his
Freshman team and held the position
of five on last year's varsity. He has
also taken an active part in base
ball, substituting for catcher on the
varsity in 1907 and playing a field
position on last year's nine. He was a
member of the Executive Committee
last year and belongs to Theta Delta
Chi. He tips the scales at 155 pounds,
is 21 years old and 5 feet 8 inches in
height.
Scott-
L. Scott, '10, is perhaps the find of
the season. His remarkable speedi
ness and his accuracy in catching and
passing the ball make him an ex
tremely valuable acquisition to the
backfield, where he will fill the posi
tion of center three-quarters. This
is Scott's first year on the football
field but his instant mastery of the
points of the game and his brilliant
offensive work easily won him a
place on the team. . He has been
prominent in baseball and track ath
letics since his Freshman year. He
was a member of the varsity nine for
two years, holding down a field posi
tion and second base in his first year
and playing third base last season. In
his Freshman year he took second in

Chi. He tips the scales at 155 pounds,

Scott-
L. Scott, '10, is perhaps the find of
the season. His remarkable speedi
ness and his accuracy in catching and
passing the ball make him an ex
tremely valuable acquisition to the
backfield, where he will fill the posi
tion of center three-quarters. This
is Scott's first year on the football
field but his instant mastery of the
points of the game and his brilliant
offensive work easily won him a
place on the team. . He has been
prominent in baseball and track ath
letics since his Freshman year. He
was a member of the varsity nine for
two years, holding down a field posi
tion and second base in his first year
and playing third base last season. In

the broad jump in the intercollegiate
meet and he tied for second place in
the pole vault last year. He regis
ters from Alameda in Architectural
Drawing and is a member of Delta
Kappa Epsilon. He tips the beam at
155 pounds, measures 5 feet 10 in
ches in height and is 21 years old.
Hoi man.
At right wing three-quarters will be
.1. It. Holman, '09, of Portland, whose
position on the team has been assured
from the first, lie is without doubt
the fastest man on (he fifteen and is
remarkably clever in running through
a scattered field. He uses his head at
all times and is never taken unawares.

and he was also captain and quarter
of the 1909 Freshman eleven. He has
made a record in track, having taken
second in the 100 and 220 last April,

Cadwalader.
T. It. Cadwalader, '09, of Los An
geles, will fill the place at left wins

three-quarters. He hao been pre
vented from playing at most of the
games this season by reason of in
juries that he has received, but his
known cleverness and reliability have
won him a position despite the fact
that he has been unable to appear in
any of the more important contests.
He is a consistent, heady player, a
good kicker, and is a fast man in a
scattered field. He played at full on
last year's fifteen, being shifted at the
last moment to that position from
wing, where he played most of the
season.' Cadwalader was a member
of the varsity nine in 1906 and again
in 1907, playing a field position. He
is 22 years of age, tips the scales at

Pi fraternity and majors in Econom
ics.
Faulk liter.
G. C. Faulkner, '10, of San Luis
Obispo, will appear at full. His work
which has shown a marked improve
ment over that of previous seasons
has won him his position, for which
there was perhaps the closest rivalry
of the season. . He has developed in
to a hard tackier and he has the abil
ity of always being able to find touch
when necessary. Hiu punting always
results in substantial gains for the
Cardinal, and, although inclined to
be erratic at times, he is on the whole
a dependable player. Faulkner was a
member of the 1910 Freshman fifteen
and has also played on his class teams
during the last two years. He is 5
feet 9 1-2 inches tail, weighs 165
pounds and is 21 years old. He is a

Gamma Delta fraternity.
