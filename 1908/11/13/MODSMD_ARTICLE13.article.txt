# The
						Campus and Adjacent Land.

### 
The Stanford and contiguous land
owned by the University comprises
over six thousand acres. Private own
ership in this great holding is pre
cluded for all time and will one day
render almost priceless the small
amount of saleable land, near the Un
iversity and at a desirable elevation.
WILLIAM CRANSTON, Palo Alto.
