### 
Down on Stanford Field through
ten long weeks of arduous training
coach and men have been prepar

been undergone by the opponents;
now both teams, trained to the min

equally firm resolve to add one more
to Ihe number of victories which is
already unparrelled in the history of
the two universities.

team-work to an unusual degree. The
