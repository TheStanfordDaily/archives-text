Tomorrow is the twenty-third an
niversary of the day when Senatoi
Stanford made to the Hoard of Trus
tees the grant founding and endowing
our University. In the exultation over
the result of the great intercollegiate
contest, probably none would have re
membered this signal even'., liuu its
occurrence not been mentioned
it is an occasion to lie celebrated,
for it commemorates the great act
without which we should not have had
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity. It is te ardent desire of
every Stanford partisan that also, to
morrow, there will be another oc
casion to l>e celebrated —a victory.
From all available indications we
seem to be about to realize both. The
sanest, truest and noblest method of
celebrating both these events is by
so conducting ourselves after our
struggle as to reflect nothing but hon
or on the student body and name of
Stanford.
