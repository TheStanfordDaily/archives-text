# STANFORD SCORES FIFTH SUCCESSIVE VICTORY
## In an Extremely Spectacular Exhibition of Rugby Cardinal Worsts Blue and Gold by Score of 12-3 
### 
In the fastest and most spectacular
Rugby contest ever seen on the Pa
cific Coast the University of Califor
nia went down to defeat before the on
slaughts of the Cardinal in the eigh
teenth annual football game of the
two universities. For the fifth suc
cessive time Stanford triumphed over
her rival by reason of her superior
team-work and fighting ability.
The contest was replete throughout
with the most thrilling plays which
brought the assembled multitude to its
feet time and again. The teams strug
gled back and forth over the field.

one having the advantage for a brief
moment and then the other assum
ing the lead. So closely were the riv
al fifteens matched that the outcome
was in doubt until the last five min
utes, when, in a magnificent burst of
speed and aggressiveness, the Car
dinal swept their opponents before
them almost at will and within a space
of four minutes scoied two trys. So
lightning-lilie was die playing that
it was with difficulty that the spec
tator followed the Individual plays.
The contest was largely a forwards'
fight, especially in die first period.
Many of the largest gains were made
by the respective packs and much of
the fierce fighting occured between
the opposing forward divisions. That
does not imply that the backfields did
not do their duty for the two back
fields played a brilliant game when
oportunity offered. The aggressive
ness of the two packo, however, made
the contest essentially a forwards'
game.
The favorable weather conditions
and the dry field were factors in the
Cardinal victory, for had the field
been muddy Stanford would have been
at a disadvantage, being accustomed
to play on turf.
It is hard indeed to pick out from
the Cardinal ranks any particular
stars, for every member of the team
played a magnificent game. Holman's
brilliant runs were without doubt the
feature of the contest. Crawford out
played the forwards of both teams,
both in the line-outs and in the
scrums, his rushes bringing mater
ial gains to Stanford. The other for
wards were fighting every minute and

surpassed their opponents both in
speed and in knowledge of the game.
Although playing against a much
heavier man, Heinly at wing forward,
easily outclassed Swartz, his aggres
sive dribbling being responsible for
many gains. Mitchell was in splen
did form and his offensive work ranks
him as one of the beot Rugby players
in the west. He was ibly seconded by
his mate, Ganong and together they
proved a tower of strength on defense.
Scott fully lived up to his form in the
prelminary games and played a well
I judged game. Despite his weak knee
Cadwalader was in every play and
proved a host in himself, both on de
[ fense and in gaining ground for the
I Cardinal.
Although lacking in experience,
Faulkner was the equal of the Butler
and relieved many dangerous situa
tions by his timely kicking.
First liiiil'o
California won the toss and Butler
decided to kick-off, leaving the choice
of goals to Crawford, who decided to
defend the south goal. Butler's kick
was returned to touch on the Cardinal
!40 yard line by Holman. Following
the line-out there was a scrum near
the 30 yard line and the California for
wards started a dribbling rush which
carried the oval within a few feel of
the Cardinal goal. California over
kicked and Faulkner touched down.
Crawford's drop out was returned to
center by Butler. Holman received
and ran along the side lines for a
twenty yard gain. Dwiggins secured
on the line-out and found touch in
Stanford territory. A punting duel

succeeded in which neither side had
the advantage. From the line-out at
center following a kick by Cerf, Erb
secured, passing to Mitchell, who im
mediately returned to Erb who found
touch on the Blue and Gold 35
yard line. A passing rush by the
Stanford backs brought the pigskin
almost to the California goal. Sut
ler relieved by tackling Scott and Cal
ifornia rushed the ball back 25 yards.
Mitchell Scores.
Erb secured from the scrum that
followed and passed to Mitchell. Dodg

ing through the entire California
backfield, Mitchell made a beautiful
25 yard run and planted the hall be
hind the line. Crawford failed to kick
an easy goal. Score Stanford 3, Cal
ifornia 0.
Ganong secured Butler's drop-out
and ran it to the 25 yard line. A kick
into touch by Watts and a dribbling
rush by Markwart and Phleger car
ried the ball well into the Cardinal
territory. Scott to Ganong netted 25
yards but California again dribbled
back to Stanford's 25 yard line. A
pretty passing rally by California's
backs was stopped by Heinly, who
dribbled back to center.
Csilifornia .Makes a Try.
The Blue and Gold team at this
juncture assumed the offensive and
several times threatened the Cardinal
goal. A series of backfield rushes
left the ball within 15 yards of Stan
ford's line. Elliott .secured from the
line-out and passed to Webster. The
latter threw the oval to Cerf, whose
impetus carried him over the line.
Harris failed to convert. Score Stan
ford 3, California 3.
A series of punts following the
drop-out carried the ball to the Blue
and Gold 25 yard line. A scrum fol
lowed and the Cardinal clean heel
out was secured by Erb who passed
to Cadwalader, who gained 20 yards
through a scattered field. Califor
nia dribbled back to the 25 yard line
but Erb again secured and passed
to Mitchell. The five-eighths ran the
ball almost to the line and then pass
ed to Pemberton, who scored the sec
ond try. Crawford failed to kick a
difficult goal near center and the pis
tol soon ended the period.
Second Half.
Crawford's kick-off was returned to
center by Dwiggins. Cadwalader
found touch on California's 25 yard
line but the Blue and Gold forwards
dribbled back to center. In a series
of fast rushes the California pack car
ried the oval to within three feet of
Stanford's line. Holman saved a try
by scooping and kicking to touch. Mit
chell secured from the line-out and
hooted to center. A number of rushes
ensued without any material gain to
either side, each pack holding its
ground. A scrum followed and Har
ris received Dwiggins' pass and boot
ed the pigskin into Cardinal terri
tory. Faulkner returned to center.
At this time Johns succeeded Watts
at wing three-quarters and a little lat-

Hefcree Jcnkinson—"The game was
■iiucli better than that played last
year.. It was more »|>en and freer
from penalties.. That the hest team
won is so beyond si question. The
game was a clean one. The iihm
sliowed that they understood the rules
and penalties, and with a little couch
ing in the heated moiiients I had ci<»>
trouble in preventing the niea from
malting wrong moti'es."
Trainer Christie of California —
''Stanford won from California by a
safe margin. I feel that the California
men did a lit hat could be expected of
them. Stanford had tlx- weight and
speed necessary."
..Captain Butler of California—"We
wer forced to defeat bby a heavier,
faster and more aggressive team. They
outplayed us at the scoring intervals.
It is a great disappointment to us. Ev
ery California man played his very
hardest and did all that was possi
ble."
. .Coach Taylor of California—"The
best team won. I thought California
would win, but I can see I was badly
mistaken.. I thought at times in the
second half that perhaps California
would score and even up matters. My
men did all that thej could, hut were
simply pitted against a better team."
..Coach .lames F Lunagan—"The
credit of the victory is entirely due to
Coach George .1. I'resley and ("raw
ford.. lie has had charge of tiie team
this year. I have acted in only an ad
visory capacity. It was a good game."
Coach Presley—"The Berkeley team
put up an awful hard light, and I can
say tliat I am entirely satisfied with
the showing made by Stanford. That
is all I care to say about the game."
..Captain Crawford—"lt was a hard
tight and I think tlx best team won.
The men of Stanford were on the
ball and played for all that was iu
them. I feel proud of our team."

er Twitchell took Pauly's place at rear
rank. After the drop-out California
found touch on the Cardinal 30 yard
line, but a snappy passing rally by
the Stanford hacks returned the ball
to center of the Rlue and Gold terri
tory. The California pack in a num
ber of fierce rushes threatened the
Stanford goal, but Erb relieved by
finding touch. Faulkner was injured
in trying to stop the rush and Cadwal
ader was put at full and Cook at wing
three-quarters.

Miller.
From the scrum which followed a
crooked throw-in at the 25 yard line
the California forwards dribbled to
the Cardinal goal but overkicked and
Holman touched down. Play settled
near center for a few minutes and
then Swartz broke through and drib
bled to Stanford's 20 yard line. Cad
walader returned to center and Hein
ly dribbled to within a few yards of
the goal. A backfield rush was start
ed by the Cardinal players which al
most resulted in a try, but a fumble
enabled Butler to touch down. The
California forwards rallied and suc
ceeded in forcing the oval danger
ously near the Stanford line. A mom
entary relief was afforded by Cad
walader's kick to touch but the Blue
and Gold pack again started a fierce
dribbling rush and would have scored
but for Cadwalader's quickness in
falling on the ball. Owing to an in
jury to Heinly's leg, Miller was
placed at wing forward and Cheda
went in at rear rank. From this time
on California was forced to play a de
fense game, Stanford assuming the of
fensive and continually threatening
the Blue and Gold goal.
Holmnii Scores Third Try.
Following the line-out near center,
Cheda dribbled the pigskin 25 yards
into California territory. Here a pass
ing rally was started by Mitchell. Hol
man received the pass from Scott and
in a spectacular 20 yard run along the
side line succeeded in scoring another
try for Stanford. Crawford failed to
convert owing to the difficulty of the
angle.
Miller Makes Last Try.
Immediately after the drop-out, and
with but four minutes of play left,
' the Cardinal pack rushed the ball to
the Blue and Gold 10 yard line. Ruck
ing ensued, the ball finally rolling out
to Miller who forced his way through
California's defense for the last try
of the game. Crawford again missed
a difficult goal and the score stood 12-
3. During the last two minutes of
play the advantage was with the Car
dinal, the ball being well into the
California territory when the game
ended.
