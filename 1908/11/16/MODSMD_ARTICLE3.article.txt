Stanford's victory Saturday comes
as the most fitting close possible to the
intercollegiate Rugby season, inas
much as the winning players deserv
ed every score they made. They de
served to win because of their sports
manlike spirit displayed throughout
the entire season. They deserved to
win because of their skill and prow
ess in Rugby; because of their fine
physical condition and, again, be
cause the instruction of the coaches
was keen, thorough, consistnet and in
spiring. The greatest amount of credit
for the success of Stanford is due to
the players and the men who trained
them and to all these the thanks of
the student body are owed in great
measure.
