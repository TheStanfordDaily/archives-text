# LARGEST CROWD IN HISTORY.
## All Records For Attendance at Stanford California Games Are Broken. 
### 
The attendance at the Stanford-
California Rugby contest last Satur
day was the largest that ever witness
ed an athletic event at either uni
versity. Probably, also, the Pacific
Coast lias never seen a larger crowd
at a football game. It is estimated
that there were over 17,000 people in
the gathering, and that the total re
ceipts were not less than $33,000.
For three years previous to this the
attendance at the annual games has
been practically the same, in the
same, in the neighborhood of 15,000
â€”with receipts amounting to $30,000.
