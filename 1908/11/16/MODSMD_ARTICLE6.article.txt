# Berkeley vs. Stanford.
## 
### 
Berkeley $33.00 an inch, Stanford
$5.50 a foot; that represents the rel
ative value of the choicest residence
property near Stanford. The Key
Route gave Berkeley its impetus. Five
years ago it was about the size of Palo
Alto and rapid transportation will do
as much for us.
A little more than half a mile from
the Quadrangle at the end of the road
past Roble Gym lies the neasest sale
able land to the University. It is roll
ing and prettily wooded. Fifty-loot
lots sell for $275 â€”$10 a month, no in
terest, no taxes, so that almost any
one can buy one out of his allowance.
In Berkeley similar lots sell for
$20,000.
