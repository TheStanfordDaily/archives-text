### 
Both the Stanford and California
cheering sections at the big game Sat
urday used various "stunts" with
which to outdo the other in spirit and
enthusiasm. The Stanford section
wore the conventional Cardinal hats
and used red megaphones.
As in games before a huge "S" was
outlined by students in the center of
the section, who wore white hats and
capes and carried white magaphones.
Pigeons, carrying Cardinal ribbons,
were released at intervals during the
game and were greeted with applause
by the crowd.
At the top of the section a large
white banner was placed, bearing the
Stanford victory scores for the past
five years. In large letters below
them was printed ' Aint it awful,
Berkeley?" When the Cardinal team
came on the field a rain of confetti
was thrown over the bleachers by
the Stanford students. The Stanford
and California bands both played for
their respective sections.
On the California side the cheering
section presented a mass of white
with blue and gold hats. Pennants at
the top of the section each bore a let
ter spelling "California." In front of
the Blue and Gold section a large
bear, made of yellow chrysanthemums
was placed, the gift of a Berkeley
florist.
The cheering by the two sections
was up to the standard of former
years, but no record for enthusiasm
was established. Both universities
used their songs to good advantage
and both received their share of ap
plause from supporters of both sides.
At the end of the game the usual
serpentine was given by the Cardinal
students, whose line of march went
under both goals, where red rooting
hats were thrown over the goal bars.
"Hail, Stanford, Hail" was sung in the
center of the field and "Hail Califor
nia" from the Blue and Gold bleach
ers.
