# REV. PARSONS PREACHES.
## Explains Old Question and Its Answer As Applied to Modern Society. 
### 
Rev. E. L. Parsons of St. Marks
Church, Berkeley, delivered the ser
mon in the morning service at the
chapel yesterday. Taking as his
theme the question asked of John the
Baptist, whether the Saviour was He
that should come or we should look for
another, Dr. Parsons applied the
query as it is usually heard in the
present day society. The same ques
tion is asked as it was in the time of
.Testis and answered in the same way
that the harbinger of the Man from
Galilee answered it. He satisfied his
interrogators by pointing out the good
works of the Great Healer and stated
that that was sufficient proof of His
identity.
"All true believers in Christ" said
the preacher, "should be and are now
judged by the deeds and actions that
are committed by them in the interest
of humanity, or in other words, for
the benefit of the name of Christian
ity." A man's service to society should
not be judged by the material or pe
cuniary reward that he obtains from
humanity, but should consist of a true
valuation of the deeds and actions
that are the results of his activity. The
world asks the question whether a
man is at the present doing society
a benefit by his acts and if he is not
the world recognizes the fact at once."
