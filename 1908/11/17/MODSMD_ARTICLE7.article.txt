# Last Week of Season Ticket Sales.
## 
### 
Professor S. W. Young, Chairman
of the Faculty Entertainment Commit
tee, makes the following announce
ment:
"Through the courtesy of Manager
Behimer the time for the sale of sea
son tickets for the Gadski —Bispham—
Gabrilowitch series has been extended
one week. This period will close on
Wednesday, November 25, at which
time tickets will be withdrawn from
sale. Up to the present time the sales
are not sufficient to insure the engage
ment of these artists. Unless the
sales reach the amount required in
the contract by the above mentioned

date, the chances of securing these ar
tists will be very small. Therefore
all those interested in the matter are
urged to secure their tickets at once.
"In case the committee fails to se
cure sufficient sales, the dates upon
which purchasers may redeem their
tickets will be announced early in
December.
"(Signed)' S. W. Young,
