# JAPANESE WILL SPEAK
## REV. D. EBINA WILL DELIVER ADDRESS TO STUDENTS. Cosmopolitan Club Has Arranged a Lecture By Religious Loader From Japan. 
### 
Reverend D. Bbina, a prominent
Japanese minister of the Gospel, will
deliver an address before the members
of the Cosmopolitan Club in room 214
tomorrow evening, wnich the students
of the University are invited to at
tend. Dr. Ebina is a graduate of the
Congregational College at Kioto and
has spent his entire life working
among the students of the univer
sities and colleges of Tokio.
The life-work of Dr. Ebina has been
to organize a separate church, inde
pendent of the influence of mission
aries and foreigners in Japan.
Christianity is a comparatively new
religion to the Japanese, and has been
until lately, confined to the poorer
and more ignorant classes, to whom
the missionaries have devoted them
selves almost exclusively.
By untiring effort, Ebina a few years
ago, succeeded in establishing an in
dependent Congregational Church,
supported by students, which has
since become the nucleus of a growing
sentiment among people for freedom
from outside influence in religious
matters. The mind of the Japanese
people, as they have become more
educated, has revolted against the
mere exterior forms of the older re
ligion of Shintoism and Buddhism.
More and more are the educated Jap
anese turning towards the newer re
ligion of Christianity for solace. It
is of this transitional period that Dr.
Ebina will speak in his address to
morrow evening. The subject will
be "The Religious Struggle of the
Japanese Young Man." which, it is
supposed, will be a comparative study
of the ideals and ethics of Shintoism,
Buddhism and Christianity.
Dr. Ebina is now on his way back
from a Congregational conference
held last spring at Edinburgh, Scot
land, at which he represented his con
gregation. After the conference he
spent a considerable length of time
on the continent, where he met sev
eral noted men who nre In sympathy
with his work. Dr. Ebina will spend
a short time on the Coast and then
leave for his home in Japan. The lec
ture will begin at 8 o'clock.
