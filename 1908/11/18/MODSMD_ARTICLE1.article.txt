# SECURES RARE BOOKS
## LIBRARY PURCHASING NEEDED PUBLICATIONS. Fund Appropriated By the Trustees Used To Aid Departments For Research. 
### 
The Stanford University Library has
recently received several sets of peri
odicals and societys' publications much
needed for research and graduate
work, which, owing ♦o its youth and
formerly small book fund, the Li
brary has heretofore been unable to
procure. These large and expensive
sets usually form the backbone of a
university library, since they are es
sential to research work and the
growth of a graduate school. Recog
nizing this, the trustees have appro
priated $8000 per year for the next
five years to make up this deficiency
and the result is now being seen in
the arrival of these much desired
books.
The receipt of the Annals des
Sciences Naturelles and Curtis' Bo
tanical Magazine has already been re
corded. Since these, however, many
other sets have been added, notably
Poggendorff's Annalen der Physik
und Chemie, 1824-77 —a work as val
uable and expensive as it is difficult
to procure—the Philosophical Mag
azine from 1827-1850 and the Proceed
ings of the Royal Society of London
to date.
Of interest chiefly to the engin
eering departments will be the trans
actions of the Society of Engineers
and the Proceedings of the Associa
tion of Municipal and County Engi
neers—two useful English sets—the
Street Railway Journal and the Elec
trical Engineer (N. Y.) being also
completed.
For the English department a com
plete set of the Publications of the
English Dialect Society has been se
cured and the gaps in the Spenser
Society filled; while for the classi
cal students the Annual of the Brit
ish School at. Athens will be of in
terest. Other complete sets are the
Bulletins de l'lnstitut Internationale
de Statistique, the Societa Entomo
logia Italiano, and Mind. Lastly, the
Fortnightly Review has been secured
from the beginning, a fact which de
baters and other users of Poole's in
dex will be pleased to hear.
Additional sets are now on their
way here and still others will be
bought as rapidly as their rarity and
cost will allow.
