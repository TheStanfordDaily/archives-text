The Daily Palo Alto understands
that at the last meeting of the 1910
Quad Board of Directors the general
sense of the members present was
that an official statement of the ac
tions of the committee should be
drawn up from time to time and pub
lished.
This view is to he commended from
every standpoint. The Junior Class
has a right to know how its busi
ness is being conducted. The class
should be kept accurately informed
inasmuch, also, as the present sys
tem of managing the Quad is on trial.
The board is responsible to the class
for the proper conduct of the manage
ment of the book and in publishing
the accounts approved by it would be
doing its duty.
