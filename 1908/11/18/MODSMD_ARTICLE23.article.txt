# NEW PRESIDENT ELECTED.
## A. C. Stelle, '09, To Fill Place Made Vacant By Resignation of W. C. Shelton, '08. 
### 
The election of a new president was
the most important business trans
acted by the Euphronia Debating
Society last evening outside of the
regular debate and routine business.
The new officer is A. C. Stelle, '09, who
was unanimously chosen by the or
ganization to succeed W. C. Shelton,
'08, who tendered his resignation on
account of too great a stress of work.
A vote of thanks was given to the re
tiring president for the services that
he has rendered to the society by the
members of the organization.
The regular question for debate was
"Resolved, That the initiative and ref
erendum as adopted in the State of
Oregon should be adopted by the
State of California." The affirmative
was presented by S. J. Talbot, '10, and
W. H. Patterson, '10, while R. L.
Smith, '10, and F. B. Wood, '10, upheld
the negative; the latter were success
ful in attacking the proposition.
