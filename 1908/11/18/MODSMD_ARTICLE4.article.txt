# BUTLER TAKES BLAME
## CALIFORNIA CAPTAIN ACCOUNTS FOR DEFEAT. Letter Sent To Athletes of Blue and Gold Explaining Stanford's Victory Saturday. 
### 
In a letter to tht athletes of the
University of California, Captain
Ralph Butler takes full responsibility
for the large score that was made by
the Stanford varsity during the sec
ond half of the game last Saturday.
This was on account of Butler's
having given orders for open play,
at the time when he rushed up from
his position and threw the ball into
play. Holman finally secured it, made
his run for a try, and from this time
on the play was all Stanford's way.
Captain Butler's lotter in full fol
lows:
"Our varsity was essentially a de
fensive team and it <vas only by the
almost superhuman efforts of the
forwards and inside line of backs that
Stanford was played to a standstill
for an hour and fifteen minutes. So
long as we could play a defensive
game the Stanford attack was almost
powerless to advance the ball and
with but six minutes to play a chance
for California to win came—and was
lost. Straight defensive play could
no longer bring victory and with five
minutes to play the California captain
ordered that the game be made as
open as possible, that every chance
for victory be taken. It was but a
bare chance for victory and one full
of danger, as the result showed. The
California team was asked to play a
style of game at which Stanford, and
not they, excelled, and they tried with
all that was in them to play that game
—every man fought to the last
whistle. The team as a whole is re
sponsible for a 6-3 score; the Cali
fornia captain is responsible for Stan
ford's last six points."
