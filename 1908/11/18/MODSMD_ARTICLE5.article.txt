# GOOD CONTEST IN TRY-OUT.
## 51 Men and 38 Women Compete For Cast of Sophomore Play "7-20-8" â€”More To Try-Out. 
### 
Much interest was shown in the So
phomore play "7-20-8" try-outs this
afternoon. This statement is based
on the fact that 51 men and 38 women
signed Chairman Thompson's book
with intention to compete for the
parts in the comedy. These figures
were reported at 4:30 o'clock this af
ternoon and no doubt more Sopho
mores will report at Ibis evening's
try-out.
Coach Frank Mathieu heard the as
piring Thespians all afternoon. The
nature of the try-outs is to give the
coach an idea of available material
besides taking note of the candidates'
ability.
As this is a preliminary try-out,
those who are successful will be
obliged to go through another compe
tition, at which time Coach Mathieu
will be able to nam? the cast. The
successful members will be obliged to
learn the play this semester, for sev
eral rehearsals will be held, insur
ing an early start next semester.
