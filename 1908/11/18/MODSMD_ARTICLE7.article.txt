"Vocations of Americans and Jap
anese" will be the subject that Rev
erend D. Ebina will speak upon to
morrow morning at 11:15 o'clock in
Assembly Hall. Reverend Ebina is a
Japanese of much ability as a relig
ious worker and his success has cre
ated much comment both at home and
abroad. Dr. Ebina's work has been a
consistent effort to organize an in

Japan. This church he desires to be
free from the influences of mission
aries and foreigners in Japan. With
this purpose in view he has worked
faithfully for a number of years and
it was only a short time ago that the
eminent Japanese was successful.
Dr. Ebina is at the present time on
his way back to Japan from a Congre
gational conference held last spring in
Edinburgh, Scotland. He expects to
remain only a short time on the Pa
cific coast before leaving for Tokio.
He is the guest of the Japanese
Students' Association and has been
