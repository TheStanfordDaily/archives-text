# REVEREND D. EBINA ADDRESSES LAST ASSEMBLY OF THE YEAR
## Japanese Religious Worker Speaks on the Interesting Subject of "Vocations of Americans and Japanese." 
### 
Reverend D. Ebina, of Tokio, Japan,
gave a very interesting talk this morn
ing before a large assembly. Dr.
Ebina was introduced by Professor
Howard, who introduced him as "Mr.
Ebina of Japan." Before giving his
announced speech he explained to the
audience that this was his first visit
away from his native land and that
not only was his speech of English
awkward, but that his new American
suit felt out of place on him.
Dr. Ebina in his talk told in detail
the relations of America and Japan,
and also expressed many ideas of what
the Japanese as a people think of the
American people and government. As
announced, his spet.ch also dealt
largely with the "Vocations of Amer
icans and Japanese." Reverend Ebina
spoke in part as follows:
"I have come from the far East, a
place which is misleading. Yet 1
have come from the West. If England
is your nearest eastern neighbor, then
Japan is your nearest western neigh
bor. We receive our new light of
civilization from the East. Christ
ianity was introduced into Japan from
the West hundreds of years ago. It
failed. Now the modern Christianity
from the East has been substituted
and is succeeding.
"Forty years ago only privileged
classes could fight for Japan. The
laborer, artisan and business man
could not. They were not brave or
disciplined enough. After reading
the history of the United States and
America we see why all the Japan
ese should be on an equal footing. We
see why democracy should prevail.
"It was only because the Japanese
were imbued with the democratic
spirit that they were able to fight suc
cessfully against the Russians. At
that time you know all the Japanese
people fought. They were instilled
with patriotism. The Japanese respect
your pilgrim fathers, the fathers of
your grand democratic government.
These great men have inspired the
young Japanese as well as the young
Americans.
"For a long time there has been
a class struggle in Japan. It was
the class called the 'outcasts' against
the wealthier people. The 'outcasts'
had their own villages and amuse
ments. They were ignored. But later
the Japanese, imbued with the spirit
of fraternity and benevolence, treated
the 'outcasts' better. In the late war
the 'outcasts' and the more respect
ed man fought side by side. The 'out
cast' today is respected. Many are
high officers in the Japanese army. To
day in Japan there are no classes.
The people all respect each other,
they work together and fight to
gether.
"When the people of America abol
ished slavery they did their noblest
work. In Japan a similar thing has
occurred. The Japanese have abol
ished distinction. We have raised
the business class and have done away
with the arristocracy. We desire to
elevate the 'outcast' as you have ele

vated the negro. Democracy 111 Japan
has developed rapidly. The .Vapanese
today can look forward with spirit
of democracy and humanity Ve are
following you people. You are ad
vancing beyond all others. r "he best
of Europe and England is now being
realized in America.
"In England we find churches of
the people. In America we find only
one thing—Christianity of the people
and for the people.
"In Japan during the last thirty
years there has been perfect freedom
of conscience. The Japanese have
churches for the people. So it is
plain that the people of Japan are fol
lowing the Americans. We are all
kindred in Christianity, we are in this
way brothers and sisters. Japanese
see much in humanity. They have
learned to love their enemies. Amer
icans have a great task before them
in Americanizing the whole people of
that nation. America and Japan, by
combining their forces, can push on
the work of God. We are willing, you
are more able. You start, we will
follow."

American people and government. As
announced, his spet.ch also dealt
largely with the "Vocations of Amer
icans and Japanese." Reverend Ebina
spoke in part as follows:
"I have come from the far East, a
place which is misleading. Yet 1
have come from the West. If England
is your nearest eastern neighbor, then
Japan is your nearest western neigh
bor. We receive our new light of
civilization from the East. Christ
ianity was introduced into Japan from
the West hundreds of years ago. It
failed. Now the modern Christianity
from the East has been substituted
and is succeeding.
"Forty years ago only privileged
classes could fight for Japan. The
laborer, artisan and business man
could not. They were not brave or
disciplined enough. After reading
the history of the United States and
America we see why all the Japan
ese should be on an equal footing. We
see why democracy should prevail.
"It was only because the Japanese
were imbued with the democratic
spirit that they were able to fight suc
cessfully against the Russians. At
that time you know all the Japanese
people fought. They were instilled
with patriotism. The Japanese respect
your pilgrim fathers, the fathers of
your grand democratic government.
These great men have inspired the
young Japanese as well as the young
Americans.
"For a long time there has been
a class struggle in Japan. It was
the class called the 'outcasts' against
the wealthier people. The 'outcasts'
had their own villages and amuse
ments. They were ignored. But later
the Japanese, imbued with the spirit
of fraternity and benevolence, treated
the 'outcasts' better. In the late war
the 'outcasts' and the more respect
ed man fought side by side. The 'out
cast' today is respected. Many are
high officers in the Japanese army. To
day in Japan there are no classes.
The people all respect each other,
they work together and fight to
gether.
"When the people of America abol
ished slavery they did their noblest
work. In Japan a similar thing has
occurred. The Japanese have abol
ished distinction. We have raised
the business class and have done away
with the arristocracy. We desire to
elevate the 'outcast' as you have ele

vated the negro. Democracy 111 Japan
has developed rapidly. The .Vapanese
today can look forward with spirit
of democracy and humanity Ve are
following you people. You are ad
vancing beyond all others. r "he best
of Europe and England is now being
realized in America.
"In England we find churches of
the people. In America we find only
one thing—Christianity of the people
and for the people.
"In Japan during the last thirty
years there has been perfect freedom
of conscience. The Japanese have
churches for the people. So it is
plain that the people of Japan are fol
lowing the Americans. We are all
kindred in Christianity, we are in this
way brothers and sisters. Japanese
see much in humanity. They have
learned to love their enemies. Amer
icans have a great task before them
in Americanizing the whole people of
that nation. America and Japan, by
combining their forces, can push on
the work of God. We are willing, you
are more able. You start, we will
follow."
Reverend D. Ebina, of Tokio, Japan,
gave a very interesting talk this morn
ing before a large assembly. Dr.
Ebina was introduced by Professor
Howard, who introduced him as "Mr.
Ebina of Japan." Before giving his
announced speech he explained to the
audience that this was his first visit
away from his native land and that
not only was his speech of English
awkward, but that his new American
suit felt out of place on him.
Dr. Ebina in his talk told in detail
the relations of America and Japan,
and also expressed many ideas of what
the Japanese as a people think of the
American people and government. As
announced, his spet.ch also dealt
largely with the "Vocations of Amer
icans and Japanese." Reverend Ebina
spoke in part as follows:
