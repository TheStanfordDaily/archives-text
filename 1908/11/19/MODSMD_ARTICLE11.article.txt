# What Happened at Berkeley.
## 
### 
A favorite stunt at Berkeley was to
cut over to Bancroft Way and catch
a car there for the Key Route depot.
Some of the wise ones realized that
Bancroft Way, so near the U. C.
buildings and three minutes by car
line from the railroad was a good
place to live. Lots there are worth
$400 a foot now.
Similarly situated land skirted by
the new Peninsula Electric Railway,
for which ground is already broken,
lies at the end of the road past Roble
Gym. Beautifully wooded lots on roll
ing ground are selling for $10 a month
and $275 in all â€”no interest or taxes.
