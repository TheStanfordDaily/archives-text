# Dr. Ebina Lectures To Club Men.
## 
### 
Dr. Ebina, of Tokio, Japan, deliv
ered a very interesting lecture last
evening before the members of the
Cosmopolitan Club. The subject of
the address, "The religious Struggles
of the Japanese Young Man," offered
Dr. Ebina the opportunity-to show the
difficulties in the way of Christianizing
of Japan.
"The greatest difficulty," he said,
"is the fact that the religions already
existing there, Shintoism, Buddhism
and Confucianism, have many virtues,
and teach above all, patriotism. For
a long time it was difficult to make
the Japanese believe that the Chris
tians were not revolutionists and, al
though they were not persecuted,
they were looked down upon."
Other influences which retards the
spread of Christianity according to
Dr. Ebina, is the natural conservatism
of the people, and the fact that Shin
toism contains many practical doc
trines similar to those of Christian
ity, and that the people are reluctant
to make the change from one relig
ion to the other.
After the lecture a short business
meeting of the club was held at which
some routine business was transacted.
