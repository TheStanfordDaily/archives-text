The question of payment of the
semester dues of twenty-five cents was
brought up at the meeting of the

Many of the girls have not paid yet
and the league urgei. them to do so
immediately, this insuring the early
payment of various expenses incurred
Those wishing to pay dues may see

Miss F. McKinley, '10, or Miss L.
Mirrielees, '09.
