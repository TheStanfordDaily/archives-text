# TO ELECT FOOTBALL CAPTAIN.
## Team to Choose Crawford's Successor Next Saturdayâ€”Light Training After Thanksgiving. 
### 
In all probability the man who will
lead next year's varsity fifteen will be
elected when the team meets Satur
day to have pictures taken. No ban
quet will be given the football men
this year and for this reason the
election will take place Saturday.
Manager Stewart has arranged for a
bus leaving Stanford University Inn at
1:30 to convey the players to Palo
Alto.
Practice for the Vancouver trip
will not begin until the first of De
cember when light drill will be in
dulged in each day to keep the mer
in condition. The past season has
been an arduous one and both coaches
and trainer thought it best to allow
the men a period ot rest before be
ginning preparations for the north
ern trip.
