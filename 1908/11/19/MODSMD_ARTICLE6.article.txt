# SAN FRANCISCO LAWYER SPEAKS.
## Attorney H.M. Wright Lectures on Jurisdiction of State and Federal Courts. 
### 
The second of the series of Legal
Tactics lectures was given this af
ternoon by Attorney H. M. Wright of
the San Francisco Bar. His general
topic was,"State and Federal Courts
â€”A Study in Concurrent Jurisdic
tion." To give a practical illustra
tion of the conflict in authority be
tween the two branches of courts, he
gave the history of a case in admir
alty which he had prosecuted some
years ago. During the progress of
this case action, which extended over
a period of four years, questions arose
which made it necessary to bring the
case before both Federal and State
courts. By presenting the various
phases of the case he was able to im
part a clear idea of the rules of pro
cedure governing such actions. His
address was very interesting through
out and contained much that was n c
practical benefit to Law students.
