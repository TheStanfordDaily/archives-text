The actions of the Board of Con
trol this afternoon are such as to
elicit the hearty congratulation of
everybody connected with Stanford.
That the student body is out of debt
on grounds and bleachers is the first
cause for rejoicing. This state of af- [
fairs is a fact due to the capable man
agement of the persons who have had
the supervision of the student body
finances in their charge and, as such,
is a glowing testimonial of their ef
ficiency. The appropriation for new
tennis courts will be welcomed by a
large number of persons in the com
munity. Furthermore, no better place
for baseball games could be found
on the campus than Stanford Field,
privided the players are satisfied with
the diamond that is to be constructed.
The wise expenditures authorized by
the board will bring forth the fruits
of a prosperity that bodes well in ev
ery way for the atletic future of the
University.
