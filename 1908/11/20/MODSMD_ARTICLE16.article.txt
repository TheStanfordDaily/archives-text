### 
The number of passengers conveyed
by the Southern Pacific from Palo
Alto to San Francisco upon Novem
ber 14 was larger than any crowd
that was ever taken before to Berk
eley when the intercollegiate foot
ball game has been held there. These
figures have been obtained from the
number of tickets sold by the South
ern Pacific, including both the spec
ial rate tickets and the regular trans
portations.
The demand for the special tick
ets reached a high figure as shown
by the number disposed of which was
1743, while 500 at the regular rate
were sold.
