# Yale vs. Harvard at Yale Tomorow.
## 
### 
Yale will play Harvard tomorrow
afternoon on Yale Field, New Haven.
The 40,000 seats in the stadium were
sold some time ago, as the demand ran
many thousand above the capacity.
Harvard has been playing strongly
and consistently during the entire
season, while Yale's line-up has suf
fered radical changes after practi
cally every game, and several veter
an players are on the injured list.
Both the captains of the Blue and of
the Crimson are out of the game,
though Captain Barr, of Harvard may
be able to play part of the game.
There is no hope that the Yale Cap
tain Burch, will play. Harvard's
chances were perhaps never better
for breaking the long line of seven
straight defeats at the hands of Yale
since 1901.
Harvard will use a military band
to lead her cheering section instead
of her university band, while Yale
will have the Second Connecticut
Regimental Band, as usual.
