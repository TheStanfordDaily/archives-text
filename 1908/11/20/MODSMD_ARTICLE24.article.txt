# STONE TO COME DOWN.
## Hazing of Walls of Memorial Church Starts Next Weekâ€”Scaffolds and Derricks Are Being Erected. 
### 
Continued rapid progress is being
made in the razing of Memorial
Church. At the present time, the lar
ger part of the tiling 011 the roof has
been torn off and the entire interior
decorations as well as the galleries
have been removed
All the mosaics are still intact and
as few of them will be removed as
possible. It cannot be completely
determined which of them are in good
condition until the work of demoli
tion has been further advanced. Tt has
been found that all but four of the
statues have been seriously damaged.
Superintendent of Construction Bain
believes that the less seriously dam
aged ones can be repaired. All the
statues are at present stored in a
wooden building especially con
structed for that purpose in the rear
of the church.
The entire force of laborers is at
present engaged in building scaffold
ing to be used in tearing down the
walls. Three derricks are also be
ing erected for the same purpose.
One of the derricks has already been
raised to the east of the church. Grav
el is now being cleared away and
holes dug in the inner quadrangle
preparatory to placing the other two
derricks in position. Owing to the
dangerous character of the work now
going on signs have been posted at
all the entrances of the church for
bidding entrance therein. A railing
in front of the edifice and extending
for some distance into the inner quad
rangle, has been built for the same
protection.
