# INVENTION TO BE SHOWN.
## Burlingame Telegraphic Typewriter Method of Transmission on Exhibition Monday. 
### 
A new invention of telegraphy is to
be demonstrated here next Monday
by N. D. Barry, who represents the
company that has control of the de
vice. The Burllngame Telegraphing
Typewriter is the name of the instru
ment to be exhibited and it is claim
ed by the company to be capable of
a peculiarly simple Miode of trans
mitting messages at a distance.
A typewriter is connected with the
machine and the mere operation of
the key-board on the former will
type the message upon the typewriter
connected at the other end of the
transmission wire. This makes pos
sible the sending of messages by those
who do not understand telegraphy or
the technical operation of a sending
instrument. The words are se»t di
rect from the key-board to the type
writer at the other end, which deliv
ers the message in its entirety and
without the necessity of an interpre
tation from the telegraph code.
Barry will give his demonstration
of the instrument after 10 o'clock on
Monday morning and will continue
to experiment with the machine
throughout the day in room 50(X which
is in the annex to the Mechanicai En
gineering labratory. This wilt be an
exhibition of the discovery upon the
same lines that were followed in the
demonstration given at the University
of California during the past few days.
