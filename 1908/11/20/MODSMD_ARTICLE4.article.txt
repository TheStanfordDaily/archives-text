# TRIP QUITE ASSURED
## "ARMS AND THE MAN" CAST FOR LOS ANGELES PRODUCTION. English Club Will Meet Next Week to Decide On Actors Journey In Christmas Vacation. 
### 
The "Arms and the Man" cast met
this afternoon to consider the proposed
trip to Southern California during
Christmas vacation and unanimously
voted in favor of the production of
the play in the South.
Professor H. D. Gray, who coached
the cast is heartily for the proposed
trip. He stated in regard to being
permitted by the authorities of the
University to take the trip, that Pro
fessor A. B. Clark informally indorsed
the plans, though the Student Af
fairs Committee has not yet acted up
on the consideration.
The English Club will probably de
cide the early part of next week
whether or not the trip is possible.
If the present plans are carried out
the play will be staged in one of the
Los Angeles playhouses under the
auspices of the Stanford English Club
and G. B. Gush, '09, will manage the
trip.
