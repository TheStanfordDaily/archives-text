# New Scenery For Sword and Sandals.
## 
### 
The new set of scenery that is to
be used by Sword and Sandals in
their next production, "His Excel
lency the Governor," is rapidly near
ing completion at a scenic artist's
studio in San Francisco. The organ
ization will not use any of the large
amount of scenery that it now owns
and has stored in thu Assembly Hall.
This stage setting is to be delivered
upon the campus within a few days
when it will be used in the final re
hearsals that are to be held soon.
