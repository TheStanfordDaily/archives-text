Both of the preliminary interclass
women's doubles tennis matches
were played off Saturday morning at
Roble courts. The Freshmen team
defeated the Seniors by the score of
6-4, 6-2 and the Juniors defeated the
Sophomores by the ccore 6-4, 2-6, 6-
4. The finals between the Freshmen
and Juniors will be called at the
gymnasium tomorrow at 4 o'clock.
The 1910-1911 match was of un
usual interest. Excellent team work
was displayed by both sides and the
entire game was characterized by
good long rallies and splendid net
work. The playing of Miss M. Knox,
'11, and Miss S. Bundy, '10, was un
usually good.
The 1909-1912 game, although not
as spectacular was steady and inter
esting. Some good new material has
been developed from the Freshman
Class, Miss R. Hutchinson playing
a steady, reliable game.
Miss F. Burrell, '10, the captain of
the squad this year, played in her
customary good form. She is greatly
encouraged by the prospects for the
intercollegiate tournament to be held
the middle of next semester.
The following took part in the
match Saturday: 1910, Miss F. Bur
rell, Miss S. Bundy; 1911, Miss M.
Knox, Miss B. Haig; 1912, Miss R.
Hutchinson, Miss R. Overman; 1909,
Miss A. Ellerbeck, Miss M. Clay.
