# Hard Luck Stories.

### 
Within a few days several U. C.
men have told me of fortunes which
they lost in Berkeley by not buying a
lot or two when they were in college
a couple of years ago. A good many
of us will be telling people something
similar some time soon.
In ten years San Francisco should
extend to San Mateo. What do you
think a fifty-foot lot on rolling ground,
a few minutes from the quad will be
worth then? Today it sells for $10 a
month, twenty-seven payments and no
interest. Walk down past Roble Gym
and look at them.
