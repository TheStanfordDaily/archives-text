# DR. B.E. HOWARD PREACHES.
## Delivers Sermon in Presbyterian Church In Absence of Rev. Sidney Snow. 
### 
Dr. B. E. Howard of the Economics
Department, preacned yesterday
morning in the Unitarian Church of
Palo Alto, in the absence of Rev. Sid
ney Snow, the minister of the church.
He chose for his text, Matthew, 6-
19; "Save not up for yourself treas
ure upon the earth where moth and
rust doth consume and where thieves
break through and steal."
"There is great danger in these
days of economic interest of not only
losing our money, but also our
ideals," said Dr. Howard. "All mon
ey-niaking ideas dull the edge of pa
triotism. " He spoke of the value of
moral ideas, as they stood for what a
man is and what he is to become.
He added that the ideals of men
were becoming so warped that suc
cess is coming to mean only com
mercial success. In bringing out this
point he spoke of the heavily endow
ed universities, saying: "Apparatus
can never be a substitute for strong
ideals."
In conclusion, he said that the col
leges of today cannot afford to have
their traditions become the tradi
tions of great men who merely
made money and built build
ings; that public institutions which
received aid from questionable
sources are receivers of stolen goods.
