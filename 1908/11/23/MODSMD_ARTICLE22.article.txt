# Harvard Breaks Series of Defeats.
## 
### 
Harvard defeated Vale in football
last Saturday afternoon for the first
time in seven years. The only score
in the game was a field-goal from
the twenty-eight-yard line made by
Kennard, the Harvar.i full-back, who
was substituted in the line-up five
minutes before the end of the first
half. Immediately after entering
the game, he kicked the goal that
won.
The game was peihaps the closest
that the two universities have played
in many years. Neither team fought
harder than the other, as a sum
mary of the plays shows. The Yale

captain, Burch, was able to play part
of the first half, but Harvard's cap
tain was unable to take part.
