A portion of Rev. Gardner's ser
mon about life at Stanford folows:
"Here you are, free from worry and
care, in a charming environment,
among congenial friends; you walk
the porches with poets and philoso
phers; you live in imagination with
kings and prophets; you see through
the microscope the glories of the in
fintely small, and, through the tele
scope the majesty of the infinitely
great. Are you thankful? You are
the heirs of the intellectual wealth
of all the ages. What a privilege.
And you enjoy that most exquisite
of all blessings of this life — youth;
bouyant, trustful youth, with its ro
mance, its high hopen, its joyous out
look upon the future. Be thankful!
Let us be thankful to God, the giv
er of all good gifts, for the blessings
of friendship and love, for the hopes
and fancies that give color to life,
for the ideals that beckon us onward
and upward to spiritual manhood
and womanhood.
It was announced that there would
