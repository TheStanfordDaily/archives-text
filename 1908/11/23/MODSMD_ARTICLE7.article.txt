# MITCHELL IS CAPTAIN
## PROMINENT ATHLETE ELECTED TO LEAD 1909 VARSITY. Team Choose Crawford's Successor At Meeting Held Last Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
Mowatt Merrill Mitchell, '10, was
unanimously elected to lead next
year's Cardinal fifteen at a meeting
of the team held Saturday afternoon.
Owing to the fact that the customary
banquet will not be given to the team
this year, the election was held when
the men assembled at Davey's Studio
to have their picture taken.
The captain-elect has been identi
fied with Rugby since his Freshman
year, having been a member of the
1910 Freshman fifteen. His speed,

aggressiveness and cool heady play
ing won him a place as first five
eighths on last year's varsity and
these same qualities made his posi
tion on this year's fifteen assured
from the first. His work in the pre
liminary games and in the intercol
legiate contest made him a promi
nent candidate for the position of
captain and his election does not
come altogether as a surprise to the
student body.
Mitchell has taken an active part
in baseball. He was a member of the
1910 class team and served as cat
cher for the varsity nine last season.
Mitchell is 22 years old and weighs
170 pounds. He majors in Econom
ics from Los Angeles and belongs to
the Zeta Psi fraternity.
