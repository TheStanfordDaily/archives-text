# Mr. Cross Speaks To Socialist Club.
## 
### 
At the fortnightly meeting of the
Stanford Socialist Club last night.
I. B. Cross, assistant in the Econom
ics department, read a paper upon
"Benevolent Feudalism."
Cross has elaborated a system
which he holds will follow the pres
ent competitive era and which will
be the condition under which we
shall be in the future, rather than
under that of Socialism.
At the conclusion of the paper a
very interesting discussion on it
took place.
