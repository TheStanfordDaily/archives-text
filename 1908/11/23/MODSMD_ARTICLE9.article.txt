### 
Track Captain H. L. Horton, "OS,
this afternoon announced the possi
bility of another meet this semester.
If the contest materializes, it will
probably be between the members of
the various departments represented
among the candidates for track
honors.
"Trainer Moulton," said Horton
this afternoon, "will be at the track
between the hours of 4 and 6 each
afternoon of the week, and will as
sist all those who desire help. 'Dad'
wishes to gain as accurate informa
tion as he can regarding both the am
bitions of the men and their possi
bilities. He is right in thinking that
it will be a distinct advantage to us
if every man on the track knows what
he is best in and what events he
wishes to do. The earlier we can
get the men settled in this regard,
the better off we shall be."
Captain Horton said this afternoon
that although some could not spare
much time for track work the rest of
this semester, almost every man
could get out for a while during the
period stated. He hopes to see a
large representation of both former
squads and Freshmen.
