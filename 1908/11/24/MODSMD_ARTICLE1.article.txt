# HAVE GIVEN UP HOPE
## MUSICAL CLUBS NO LONGER EXPECT TRIP. Proposition Which They Wish To Take Up Is Accepted By a California Club. 
### 
There is now no possibility of the
Glee and Mandolin Ciubs taking their
annual trip this year even if the Stud
ent. Affairs Committee should allow
them to do so. The party with whom
the Combined Musical Clubs have
been communicating for the last two
months has written that all negotia
tions would cease for this semester
for the reason that he has made ar
rangements for students of the Uni
versity of California to take the trip.
The proposition that F. W. Turner,
'OS, was hoping that members of the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs would be able
to accept during the holidays was an
offer that was received from S. E.
lUisser, superintendent of the read
ing rooms for the Santa Fe system. It
guaranteed the men all of their ex
penses, a private car and a trip to
Kansas City, extending through the
Christmas vacation. Probably some
sort of agreement would have been
reached between the Santa Fe com
pany and those who were managing
the business end of the affairs for the
musical clubs but for the denial of the
Student Affairs Committee to allow
the men to take a trip of any kind
during the coming vacation.
A letter from Busser received today
said that he would probably be in a
position to make some sort of a sim
ilar offer during the Easter vacation
next spring. Nothing has been done
towards making any plans for the fu
ture for the reason that it is not
known whether or not the musicians
would be allowed to leave the campus
next semester.
