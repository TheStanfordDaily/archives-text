The proposal to hold an informal
dance in Encina clubroom next Fri
day evening is an excellent one. There
seem to be no reasons why the dance
should not be given and some why it
should. The people who would at
tend such an affair would be, for the
most part, those who are not fortu
nate enough to be able to go home
to their families to spend the Thanks
giving holidays. inasmuch as the
dance would fall in vacation, it is dif
ficult to see how it would interfere
with University studies. The advan
tages to be derived by those who
would attend such an event seem to
be sufficient to ensure its realization.
