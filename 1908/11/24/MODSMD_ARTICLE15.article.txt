## J. C. Stubbs on "The Relations of the Railroads to Trans-Mississippi Territory." 
### 
' The Southern Pacific railroad com
pany is distributing in pamphlet form
la speech on railroads made by .i. C.
i Stubbs at the recent Trans-Mississip
pi Commercial Cong -ess held in San
, Francisco. Stubbs, vho was the rep
i resenlative of the Harriman inter
ests, presented the instructive re
| suits ol' an exhaustive study of "The
! Relations of the Railroads to Trans-
Mississippi Territory." Stubbs' ad
dress dealt with the benefits this
country and in particular that por
tion west of the Mississippi has de
rived from the development of the
railroads, and in particular, the Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific systems.
He says that while railroads need
supervision and regulation, they also
deserve the support of the people
that they may continue to grow and
by expanding into new territory, de
velop and enrich the country con
tiguous to them.
Stubbs favors the completion of the
Panama canal and the development
of inland waterways, but not for the
purpose of destroying the railroads.
He concludes by showing that the
railroads earn less on the money in
vested than do farmers or manufac
turers and asks for public coopera
tion which will bring about renewed
confidence and industrial prosperity.
