## Law Faculty Will Grant Units In Business Law At the End of Each Semester 
### 
A change has recently been made
by the members of the Law Faculty
in the method of granting credit for
the course in elements of Business
Law. This has previously come un
der the regular method which has
been pursued by the Law deparment in
respect to all deferred courses, which
has been to grant credit in such
courses only to students who have
satisfactorily passed examinations
covering the work ot both semesters.
As there has been a misunderstand
ing on the part of some of the heads
of the various departments and the
students in regard to this matter, and
as the course is for non-law majors
only, some of whom will not be able
to register in it on account of required
work next semester, it has been deem
ed advisable to make a change. There
fore two hours will te granted at the
end of this semester and the students
will not be required to register a
second semester in order to obtain
their hours. The change will proba
bly be effective for only this year.
