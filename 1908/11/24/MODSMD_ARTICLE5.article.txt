# CHARTER NOT GRANTED
## NO NEW SORORITY TO COME TO STANFORD THIS YEAR. Humors That Delta Delta Delta Is To Install Chapter Here Are Denied. 
### 
Rumors have been current on the
campus during the past few weeks
that a charter of De.ta Delta Delta
sorority was to be installed at Stan
ford this semester. These rumors were
authentically denied this afternoon,
and it has been ascertained that the
next national convention of the so
rority will not be held until June, 1910.
It was a common opinion among
many members of the sorority this
year that the chance for the appear
ance of another Greek-letter society
in their midst were excellent. Few
would have been surprised if a chap
ter of Delta Delta Delta had been es
tablished here this semester. The last
convention of that organization, how
ever, was held this summer and no
chapter was granted by it, so that it
is probable that "Tri-Delt" will not
come to Stanford for another two
years, at least.
