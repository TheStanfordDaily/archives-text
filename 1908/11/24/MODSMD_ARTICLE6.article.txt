expected on account of the severe
wind and the dampness of the courts.

cellent team work, but the Freshmen
put up a good fight and at no time un

assured to the class of 1910. Miss F.

back court. Miss S. Bundy, '10, pu:
up a hard and very successful
game. She has a fine serve and an
unusual back-hand stroke. Miss K.
Hutchinson, '12, user? a deep, speedy
serve and an effectual long drive, ami
Miss R. Overman, '12, backed up her
partner's playing stwadily and con
