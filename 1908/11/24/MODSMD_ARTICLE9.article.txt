# TURNER DENIES STORY
## PRESSURE OF WORK DOES NOT PREVENT TRIP. Circumstances Beyond Control of Oarsmen Cause Cancellation of Journey To Naples. 
### 
Coach F. W. Turner stated this af
ternoon that the idea that press of
college work determined the Stan
ford oarsmen to abandon their
Thanksgiving trip to Naples in South
ern California was a mistaken view
of the situation. Turner denied that
any of the men were deficient in their
studies this present semester and said
that the reason why the trip south
was foregone was beyond their con
trol.
The oarsmen would have been al
lowed to take their proposed journey
in all probability, were it not for two
reasons, in the eyes of the Scholar
ship Committee. One of these wai
that two of the men who were ex
pected to row were on probation, aoi
the committee thought that the crew
could not be regaraed except as a
Stanford crew. If the committee had
thought it possible for the four !o
row without being iooked upon aj
representing the University, the
chances for the successful culmin
nation of the journey would have
been much better.
When seen this alternoon, Turner
had the following to say:
"The idea conveyed by the article
in last night's issue of the Daily Palo
Alto was that the crew voluntarily
gave up the trip through pressure of
college work. They would leave to
night if permission should be granted.
Because of misrepresentation by a
local newspaper correspondent, the
Scholarship Committee advised the
crew that probable action would be
taken in case the crew appeared in
any way to represent the University.
The article written from Stanford
stated that the faculty opposed the
trip and that the crew were coming
to Los Angeles in disguise. Both
staements were false and made it im
possible for the crew to enter as at
tached to the University."
