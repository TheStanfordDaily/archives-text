# NEW SCENERY BOUGHT
## SWORD AND SANDALS TO HAVE FRESH SETTING. Sale of Tickets For "His Excellency the Governor" Will Start Monday Morning. 
### 
The scenery that was ordered by
Sword and Sandals especially for "His
Excellency the Governor" has ar
rived upon the campus and has been
set up for the rehearsals that will
take place in Assembly Hall from
now on. The wings and drops repre
sent special work upon the study of
the kind of scenes that are depict
ed by the play.
Sword and Sandalu states that Ly
ons, who has had the execution of the
stage settings, has made a careful
study of the architecture and of the
construction of the British govern
ment buildings in the Amandaland
Islands. Both the drops and the wings
show the excellent results that have
been obtained. In both the interior
and outdoor scenes that are depicted
the representation is both vivid and
accurate.
The seats are to be put on sale up
on Monday morning, November 25, at
8 o'clock, both at the University Book
store and the Stanford Pharmacy.
The prices will be one dollar, seven
five and fifty cents. A new system
has been introduced as to disposition
of the complimentary tickets that will
be given away by the organization.
Instead of presenting tickets to these
parties who are to receive them, they
will receiive reserve coupons that
will be accepted in exchange for the
tickets at the places of sale. Every
person who is entitled to a compli
mentary, except Doctor Jordan, will
receive a coupon, exchangeable at the
Bookstore or at the Stanford Phar
macy for the final reservations.
