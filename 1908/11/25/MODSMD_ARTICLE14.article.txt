The system of distributing compli
mentary tickets to theatrical per
formances by means of exchangeable
coupons cannot but meet with the ap
proval of the University public.
Sword and Sandals is to be commend
ed for instituting the practice, which
should be followed by other student
organizations. It has been custo
mary for some time with the enter
tainments given under the auspices of
the Faculty committee that has such
matters in charge.
Heretofore, in almost every in
stance, the student organizations
have reserved a number of seats
from sale. Some of these went to 11k 1
press, some to committee members,
some to friends of the players, and
some to other favored persons. Now,
the remainder of the public will have
an equal chance with the favored
persons to obtain the best seatsâ€”pro
vided the coupons are issued before
the general sale commences, and this
Sword and Sandals, we understand,
will do. Whatever complimentary
tickets are issued will amount to free
admissions and to nothing more.
While the consideration shown to the
heretofore favored persons was
pleasant, it should, i:i the interest of
the public, be foregone.
