# OLYMPICS-BARBARIANS
## FAST RUGBY CONTEST EXPECTED THANKSGIVING DAY. Wearers of the â€œ0" Have Advantage In Weight and Barbarians Excell In Speed. 
### 
The two strongest Rugby teams in
San Francisco, the Barbarians and
the Olympics, will line-up against
each other tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock on California Field. A large
Thanksgiving crowd is expected for
the game.
A comparison of the two teams
gives the Olympics an advantage in
average weight of eight pounds per
man. Such a difference will count
for a great deal on a slow field, such
as the gridiron will probably be to
morrow, on account of the recent
rains.
In the games played by both con
testing fifteens against Stanford the
Olympics have had slightly better
scores than the Barbarians, but
against California the balance is on
the side of the Barbarians by a lar
ger margin. The over-weight of the
Olympics will undoubtedly off-set the
apparent advantage in comparative
scores of the Barbarians, and a fast
close game is anticipated. Captain
Kerrigan, of the Olympics, will be un
able to play, and his successor will be
elected tonight. It is thought that
Snedigar, the former California
player, will be chosen. Captain El
liott, G. L. Goodell, ev-'O9, and Sharpe
of the Barbarians, are expected to
star for their team. Goodell has been
shifted from full-back to wing three
quarters. O. E. Snedigar will prob
ably be the best player in the Olymp
ic team.
Of the thirty men on the two teams
almost a third are Stanford men.
These are: for the Barbarians G. L.
Goodell, ex-'O9, three-quarters; L. P.
Donovan, '11, three-quarters, and
T. Tiedemann, ex-'ll, full-back; for
the Olympics, A. A. Molfino, ex-'O7, J.
F. Brennan, ex-'O7, L. R. Minturn, '09,
C. A. Thorpe, '09, J. R. Hickey, ex
'oB, and C. F. Laumeister, ex-'O7. The
first five of the above Olympics are
forwards with Laumeister at five
eighths.
