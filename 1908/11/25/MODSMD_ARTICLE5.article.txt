Graduate Manager J. E. Stewart Is
now carrying on negotiations with
"Reggie" Woodward of Vancouver
concerning the northern trip of the
varsity Rugby fifteen during the
Christmas vacation. This is to be the
second of the series of games to be
played for the Cooper-Keith Cup
which was offered last year by J.

season.

'09, and L. S. Scott, '10, will be un
able to accompany the varsity north.
