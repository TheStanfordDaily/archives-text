# PIPE ORGAN IS BEING REMOVED.
## Huge Instrument In Memorial Church Is Being Taken Apart For Purpose of Storage. 
### 
With the work of razing the Me
morial Church it has been found
necessary to remove the pipe organ.
The Harris Organ company of Los
Angeles, the firm which installed the
instrument, has the removal contract.
Taking apart the wind bellows was
begun this afternoon.
Owing to the delicate nature of the
mechanism of the instrument the
work of removal will be necessarily
slow and will take al out three weeks
in all. Each pipe will have to be put
in a special case, wapped in cotton
batting and held in a perpendicular
position during the time of storage.
The organ will be s'ored in the As
sembly Hall basement. It will be
necessary to tear out a large part of
the front of the church in order to
lower the bellows to the ground.
Some difficulty will also be encounter
ed in protecting the pipes from the
damp air as the demolition of the
walls gives the fog free access to all
parts of the buildiny.
