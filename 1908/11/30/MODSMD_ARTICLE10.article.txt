Tenuis prospects for Stanford are
brightening. One of the greatest
drawbacks the University has exper
ienced in the development of tennis
players has been the dearth of courts.
This lack has also deterred good
athletes in this branch of sport who
are greatly interested in the game,
from coming here to spend four years.
The new courts, however, will par
tially remove this obstacle. Material
in the Freshman Class seems to be
unusually good, both in quality and
quantity. Probably there will not
be another class very soon which will
afford such good material as does
1912. Therefore, this time is more
advantageous than any other at which
to improve tennis facilities.
For the sake of the Stanford ten
nis interests, it is urgently to be
hoped that nothing will prevent the
consummation of the plans to have at
least one more asphalt court before
the intercollegiate matches are again
played on the campus.
