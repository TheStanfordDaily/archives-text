# MRS. ALLAN DENIES RULES.
## Says Story About Government of Women Students Is Utterly Without Foundation. 
### 
Mrs. E. W. Allan, dean of women,
made a complete and emphatic denial
this afternoon that ohe had promul
gated any rules for the government
of the women students. Mrs. Allan
characterized as statements made of
whole cloth the rul3s attributed to
her in this morning's issue of the San
Francisco Call.
Mrs. Allan, in her denial of the
rumor said in part: "I have never is
sued any rules or regulations regard
ing the conduct of the women stud
ents. My position is that of an ad
viser to the girls, not that of an ex
ecutive. The report Is a fabrication
made up of whole cloth."
