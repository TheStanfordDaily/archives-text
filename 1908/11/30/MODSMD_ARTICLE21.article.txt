beautiful and terrible being. In this
very aspect of terribleness the
'preacher claimed that they develop
ed the greatest insight into the mind
of God and attained the truest con
ception of an omnipotent being, for,
he said, "God is the very essence of
holiness and cannot be approached.''

power was found also in our person
