## EVENLY MATCHED TEAMS FIGHT FOR CHAMPIONSHIP. Underclass Debate Is Replete With Interesting: Speeches On Live Question. 
### 
Before an unusually large audience
last Wednesday evening, the "repre
sentatives of the Sophomore and
Freshman classes met in the Univer
versity chapel to decide upon the
forensic championship of the under
classes. The contest was remarkable
for the general high qualities exhib
ited by the individual speakers and
for the evenness in strength evinced
by the two teams. This latter char
acteristic of the debate resulted in a
hard fight.
Three speakers represented a side,
each individual being allowed twelve
minutes, while the affirmative was
given the privilege of using five
minutes for rebuttal. The question
as submitted by the Sophomores read
as follows, "Resolved, That a consol
idated bank with branches in the
larger commercial centers should be
established in the United States,
which shall be the fiscal agent of the
government and shall have sole pow
er to issue notes, government sup
ervision being conceded." In their
choice of sides the Freshmen team
decided to uphold the negative of the
question.
The affirmative, represented by F.
H. Hilton, R. J. Miller and E. J. Hop
kins argued that the present system
in vogue in the United States was
weak and could only be remedied by
the use of some other system. Refer
ence was made to the consolidated
plan of banking as adopted by Eur
opean countries and a comparison
made as to the results obtained by
the eastern and western nations.
One reason why the argument
seemed very even was that the So
phomores deferred answering the ob
jections raised by the first year men.
They were not taken up by the So
phomores until the rebuttal.
11. R. Person, N. C. Wilson and M.
E. Grimes, who composed the Fresh
man team acknowledged the inade
quacy of the system in vogue at the
present day in the United States, but
instead of the consolidated bank, they
advocated a plan that they contended
was superior. In the place of the
present banking organizations, the
negative advanced the asset currency
system. The quality of the speeches
delivered by the members of the
Freshman team was unusually good.
The judges who officiated at the de
bate were Professor A. A. Young,
head of the Economics department,
Professor C. A. Huston, from the De
partment of Law and W. N. Hohfeld,
also of the latter department. Con
trary to the usual custom, the judges
did not confer, but gave their decis
ions separately. The final verdict
was two votes to one in favor of the
Sophomores, who had ably won it by
their logical arguments and by the
excellent rebuttal given by F. H. Hil
ton.
F. E. Hill and R. S. Worthington,
as alternates for the two teams, act
ed as time-keepers, while G. B. Bush,
'00, in the capacity of president of
the intersociety committee officiated
throughout the evening as chairman.
