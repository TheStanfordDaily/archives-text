# VARSITY BEGINS WORK
## FIFTEEN INDULGE IN LIGHT PRACTICE TODAY. Training For Northern Trip Will Be Less Severe Than For Intercollegiate Game. 
### 
The varsity fifteen began regular
practice again this afternoon in prep
aration for the northern games. Only
light work was indulged in today,
Coach Presley putting his men
through a series of evolutions in
cluding passing, dribbling and punt
ing. The plans for the post-season
training include only easy work for
the team, the fact that there is no
second fifteen precluding the possi
bility of any practice line-ups. It is
probable, however, that games with
outside aggregations will be arrang
ed, to make up for this deficiency. Ne
gotiations are now under way with
the Olympic and Barbarian teams and
if Manager Stewart is successful
there will be two games on the cam
pus with these fifteens within the
next two weeks.
For the present at least there wiil
be no training table in connection
with the work of the varsity and the
training rules will be less stringent
than was the case before the inter
collegiate contest. Practice will be
held each evening at 4:45 on the
sawdust field.
The following men are able to take
the trip and were requested by the
coaches to come out for practice.
From this number the team that will
meet the northern fifteen will be
picked:
Terrill, Higley, McGregor, Dole,
Crawford, Pemberton, Cheda, Rey
nolds, Evans, Miller, Erb, Heinly,
Mitchell, Ganong, Elliott, Roth, Hol
man, Cook, Faulkner and Brown. Of
the men who played against the Uni
versity of California, Scott, Cadwal
ader and Koerner will not make the
trip.
