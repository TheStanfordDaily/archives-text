# SET TWO RUGBY GAMES
## VANCOUVER DECIDES ON INTERNATIONAL MATCHES. Varsity Will Meet Northerners On Christmas and New Years-Third Date Not Made. 
### 
Three games will be played by the
varsity while in the North. All of the
matches will be with the Vancouvei
fifteen, no match being scheduled with
the Victorians as last year. Wlnlo
Manager Stewart has not completed
all of the negotiations for the trip
this much has been settled and also
the dates for two of tne championship
games. One will be piayed on Christ
mas and the other New Year's. The
second game of the series will fall
on some week day between these
dates.
Word was received bv Managt
Stewart that the VauC'M:vi..r men bad
scheduled the first game fo: Decem
ber 25, the second the d'V* following
and the third on Januar/ 1.
Directly upon learning this, word
was sent north that it would be im
possible for the Stanford men d plav
two games running witllont at least
a day to rest and pre-.ate for the next
struggle. Vancouver, with its n >st
of Rugby players, could better ai'l'ord
to do this.
The Stanford varsity will in all
probability travel both ways bv rail.
It was at first sugg3se.' mat the trip
be made by steamer bit the uncer
tainty of the weatlio has made "bis
mode of travel seem risky.
