# Simpson Turns Profit Over To Class.
## 
### 
President B. W. Lee of the Sopho
more Class has received a check
amounting to $7.50 from J. L. Simp
son of Palo Alto to be placed to the
credit of the class. This is the dif
ference between the selling price and
cost of the Sophomore hats, Simp
son kindly giving the class the ben
efit of the profit.
In his store he has still quite a
number of hats left unsold, and it
undoubtedly will be doing him a fav
or for the men of the class who are
without the proper headgear or need
new hats to take them off his hands.
