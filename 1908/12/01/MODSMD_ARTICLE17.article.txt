It is important that the members
of the Associated Students consider
deeply the coming election. From
the fact that the constitution was
amended last spring two members
will lie elected to the Executive Com
mittee for one year. Because this
time of choosing members to the gov
erning body of the Associated Stud
ents is new, care should be taken that
interest in the election will be
stimulated. There seems to have
been little concern so far manifested
as to possible candidates, and it
should be remembered that the ballot
is to be taken one week from to
morrow. Good, live and capable men
should be putin office. If the result
of the election shows that this has
been done, the student body will have
cause for congratulation. If it is not
done, the committee may suffer weak
ness for a whole year.
