# POST-SEASON RUGBY GAMES.
## Varsity May Meet Barbarian and Olympic Teams of San Francisco Before Northern Trip. 
### 
In order to give the varsity prac
tice in line-ups before it meets the
British Columbian tuams, according
to Coach George Presley, two games
will be played here with outside
fifteens. The first of these will take
place Saturday when the varsity will
play the Olympics of San Francisco
The following Saturday the Barbar
ian team will visit the campus. Both
games will be called at 3:30.
This post-season series of games
promises some interesting exhibi
tions of Rugby as both of the visiting
aggregations play a fast, snappy
game and are able to hold their own
with the varsity in a very creditable
manner.
