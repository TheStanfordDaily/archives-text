# TENNIS MEN STILL IN ACTION.
## Stakes Have Been Set For Three New Tennis Courtsâ€”Will Be Graded Soon. 
### 
The active practice which preceded
the last two tennis tournaments has
lessened somewhat, but the courts
are filled every afternoon and Satur
days with those who play for pleas
ure. Stakes have been set for the
three new oil courts, which will soon
be graded and lined.
A. J. Gowan, '09, R. A. Gott, '09,
and H. Mann,'lo, have been seen on
the courts practicing during the sem
ester and seem to have lost little if
any of their form of last spring. In
a fast doubles match last Saturday
afternoon H. Mann, '10, and H. S. Mor
gan, '12, took the measure of Instruct
or Jordan and H. S. Lyne, '11, in the
best three of five even and hard fought
sets in which many fast strokes and
exciting rallies occurred. The latter
team have had more practice togeth
er as their form and team-work are
both excellent.
The prospects of a winning tennis
team next spring woald be excellent
if there were not two players of the
championship class still at Califor
nia, namely the Long brothers. Still
the chances are much better than last
year, as besides the veterans, Gowan,
Gott and Mann of last spring's team,
varsity player P. H. Delano, 'OS, E. .Jor
dan, H. S. Morgan, '12, and E. It. Can
terbury, '12, are all conceded an ex
cellent chance to make the team. Be
sides these, many lowerclass men
may improve enough to figure in the
try-outs next spring.
