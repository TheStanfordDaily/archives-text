# INTERCLASS BASKETBALL BEGUN.
## Seniors Defeat Juniors In First Game Yesterday By the Score of 17 to 15. 
### 
A series of live men's interclass
basketball games waa started yester
day afternoon, when a five made up
of Seniors defeated one of Juniors by
the score of 17 to 15 oil the outdoor
court of Encina Gymnasium.
The game which it was hoped could
be arranged between teams from the
Sophomores and Freshmen classes
this afternoon fell through because
of the non-appearance of a Sopho
more team. The second-year men
seem to lack interest in the sport,
and unless they put a five on the
courts for the next underclass con
test scheduled, today's default by the
Sophomores will put the Freshmen
five in the finals to uieet one of the
teams composed of Seniors and Jun
iors respectively.
The series was started in an attempt
to make interclass basketball a per- ;
manent institution at Stanford and i
to interest as many men as possible
in the game. W. H. Masters has been
elected captain of the Seniors, S. J.
Hayes of the Juniors and R. E. Mill
sap of the five composed of Fresh
men. A Sophomore leader has not
been chosen.
The remainder of the series is as
follows:
Wednesday—Juniors vs. Seniors.
Thursday — Sophomores vs. Fresh
men.
Friday — Upperclass winner vs.
Lowerclass winner. No arrangements
have been made yet in case of a tie
in the preliminary games.
