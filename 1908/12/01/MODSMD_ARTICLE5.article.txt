# WORK ON NEW DIAMOND
## STANFORD FIFLD BEING MADE READY FOR BASEBALL. Turf Will Be Used On All Parts of Grounds Except on Bases and Base Lines. 
### 
The work of preparing Stanford
Field for baseball has been started
Stakes have been set. for the diamond
which is to be located in the north
west corner of the turfed area.
The surveyors have found that the
tield is several inches lower on the
north side, which will require some
filling in. Special dirt will be hauled
for this purpose to make the surface
of the diamond springy and if possi
ble free from dust. The remainder
of the field is being covered with
loam which Treasurer Lathrop has
given to the student body. It is be
ing hauled from the creek bed near
the Roble bridge and will serve as a
foundation for a better growth of
turf.
The baseball diamond will in no
way spoil the appearance of the foot
ball iield, as the ground will be sown
and the turf allowed to grow in all
places except about the bases and
base lines. These spots will be sown
immediately after the conclusion of
the season.
