"On Wednesday, November IS, one
of the pigeons brought by the Stan
ford boys to Berkeley was seen fly
ing about the Mountain View Ceme
tery, still struggling to get the car
dinal ribbons from it., leg, and finally
became tangled in a tree, i beg to
suggest that the carrier pigeon be
used in the future in place of the or
dinary birds, as in this way the old
custom could be retained and the cru
elty avoided. 1 trust that this sug
gestion will be received in the spir
it in which it is sent."
