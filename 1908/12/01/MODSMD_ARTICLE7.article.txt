## 
### 
The Multnomah Athletic Club of
Portland, Oregon, has sent, a letter to
the Olympic Club of San Francisco
challenging them to a same of inter
collegiate football to be played on
New Year's Day at Portland. Al
though the Olympic Club has been
playing Rugby during the last season,
there are a number of good players
of the old game on the team and they
feel they could organize a strong
team to send north.
