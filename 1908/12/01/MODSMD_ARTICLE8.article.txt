The sale of seats for "His Excel
lency the Governor" for Saturday
evening, December o, lias been pro
gressing rapidly at both the Stanford
Bookstore and at the Stanford Phar
macy. The seats are going at a more
rapid rate than usual. In view of
the fact that the character of the pro
duction is of such a high type, (lie
j manager expects a complete disposal
of the seats within a few days.
The cast has had some pictures
j taken in representative scenes from
| the play, embodying some of the most
I comical situations arising in the de
j velopment of the plot. These prints

idea of the well-balanced and all-star
cast that is playing in this produc
tion. Not only is every face famil
iar to the local theater-goers, but the
players are recognized as almost all
of the best material to be found in the
student body.

while reservations raav be made at
