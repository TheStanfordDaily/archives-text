# DR. JORDAN RETURNS
## PRESIDENT ARRIVED TODAY AFTER TRIP IN EAST. Devoted Much Time To International Fisheries Law and Meetings of Commissioners. 
### 
Doctor Jordan arrived upon the
campus today after an extended stay
in the East, where he has been en
gaged in attending several important
meetings of commissions, of which he
is an active member.
The Carnegie Foundation, which
has for its object the assistance of
universities in many ways, and of
which Doctor Jordan was vice-pres
ident, met while he was in the East.
The organization re-elected Doctor
Jordan vice-president, while the honor
of president was again conferred up
on President Eliot of Harvard.
The Agricultural College Commis
sion of which Doctor Jordan is chair
man, met and discussed ways and
means of carrying on the work that
it has in charge.
As the representative of the United
States on the International Fisher
ies Commission, Doctor Jordan met
the representatives of England in
many conferences regarding the final
draft of the statute that is contem
plated by the two countries, regulat
ing and defining the rights of the
two nations in the North American
fishery controversies that arise from
time to time. The two representatives
have postponed ultimate action until
after this month, when the final meet
ing with reference to this question
will be held here. Luring the inter
vening period the two are receiving
from all those vitally affected by such
statutes and fromthos e who may
have suggestions to offer, any criti
cisms or ideas that may be worthy of
been compiled, which in all proba
bility will be adopted as it stands, but
the final compilation will not be ready
for presentation until after Decem
ber.
This is the first attempt ever made
by the two governments to create a
commission to draft a law with ref
erence to the boundary disputes con
cerning fisheries, and will be the first
law ever operative along the boundary
which was compiled by a commission.
H. R. Stolz, '09, who is secretary of
this commission accompanied Doctor
Jordan.
