### 
The Geological Society held a reg
ular meeting last evening at the
Acacia house. The address of the
evening was delivered by T. A. Rick
ard, editor of the "Mining and Scien
tific Press" in San Francisco, and one
of the leading authorities on mining
in the world. The speech was quite
informal and consisted of a general
synopsis of a book, which the noted
editor is about to publish, entitled
"Mining in the North.'
