# Women Abandon Field Day Plans.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Women's Ath
letic Association this noon, it was de
cided to abandon the half-formulated
plans for a field day this semester,
the reasons for this decision being
that, the weather is unfavorable and
the semester too far advanced. As
there is over seven hundred dollars
in the treasury, plans were discuss
ed for building bleachers at the bas
ket ball court, but no action was
taken.
