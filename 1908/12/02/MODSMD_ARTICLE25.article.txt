# COURT ABBOTT'S INN MEETS.
## Members Convene For Last Time This Semesterâ€”Discuss Plans For Next Year. 
### 
The Court of Abbott's Inn held its
final meeting last evening at the
Theta Delta Chi house. The usual
argument was omittea and there was
a general discussion of plans for next
semester.
It was decided to abandon the pres
ent plan of holding two meetings ev
ery week, one in charge of the under
graduates and the other conducted
by the graduate members. By com
bining the two divisions it is planned
to hold only a weekly meeting. This
arrangement will go into effect next
semester and the arguments will be
given alternately by the graduate
and under-graduate members.
The Court has been unusually dil
igent in its work the present semes
ter, every member having taken some
part in the meetings, at least twice
during the term.
