# Concerts Depend Upon Beheymer.
## 
### 
Although Professor S. W. Young,
Chairman of the Faculty Committee
on Public Entertainments, reports
that the advance sale of season tick
ets for the Gadski-Bispham-Gabrilo
witch concerts was not quite as
heavy as originally required by their
advance agent, Manager Beheymer of
Los Angeles, it is not improbable that
Beheymer will decide to go ahead
with the concerts, relying on the size
of past audiences at the University.
The season ticket sale was con
cluded some time ago but as the
amount obtained from this source
was not up to the amount required by
Manager Beheymer as a guarantee it
now rests with Beheymer whether
he will assume the risk of a loss and
present his artists here.
As the matter rests entirely with
the management of Madame Gadski,
Messrs. Bispham and Gabrilowitch, it
will not be known definitely whether
these concerts have been secured un
til Chairman S. W. Young hears from
Beheymer. A reply is expected within
the next few days.
