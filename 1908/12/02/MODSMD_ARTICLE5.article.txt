# MAY PLAY ON SAWDUST FIELD.
## Surveyor's Stakes on Stanford Field May Prevent Use of Turf For Post-Season Games. 
### 
Certain details in connection with
the two post-season games with the
Barbarian and Olympic teams have
not yet been arranged. Owing to the
fact that Stanford Field has been re
cently surveyed for the purpose of
laying out a baseball diamond it may
be impossible to hold the contests
there as the surveyors have driven
stakes over a large area of the field
and unless these can be removed
the games will have (o be played on
the sawdust field. The question of
the admission charges to the game
depends on where the contests are
held and cannot be settled until that
matter is determined. It is prob
able that the details will be settled
within a day or two.
The varsity will continue to hold
light, informal practice every after
noon until the end of the semester.
The only line-ups that will occur,
however, will be in the games with
the San Francisco fifteens.
