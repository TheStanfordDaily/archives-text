# TO HOLD CONFERENCE
## DELEGATES WILL GATHER AT PACIFIC GROVE. Young Men's Christian Association Will Assemble During the Christmas Holidays. 
### 
The Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation is hard at work preparing for
the annual conference, which is held
at Pacific Grove during the Christ
mas holidays. Each year delegates
from the different associations of
California gather iliere. Last year a
total of one hundered and twenty
five men, representing the associa
tions, were present, and this year the
number is to lie increased. At least
twenty-five men as delegates of the
the Stanford Association, will attend
this year. They will include officers,
members of the association, faculty
men and others who wish to receive
an inspiration of fellowship and en
joy the beauty of the popular resort.
The object of the conference is to
train men for service to men, to cre
ate a deep sense of Christian Spirit
and fellowship and to open up to men
visions of the possibilities of life. The
mornings are spent with strong lead
ers and speakers, in classes, confer
ences and assemblies. The after
noons are given over to the men for
recreation, which consists of ath
letics, rides, boating, baseball, ten
nis and other exercises. The re
nowned Seventeen Mile Drive gener
ally is taken for one of the trips and
the Stanford delegates always look
forward to the annual Pacific Grove
baseball game with the University of
California representatives .
An unusually strong list of speak
ers will lead the thought of the con
ference this year. Among them will
be: W. H. Ray, of Los Angeles; Dr. F.
W. Clampett, of San Francisco; E. C.
Carter, of New York; Prof. C. G. Pat
erson, of San Anselmo; A. L. Adams,
of Oakland; J. W. Baer, of Los An
geles; E. C. Mercer, of New York; G.
Irving, of Montreal; J. E. Sprunger,
of Los Angeles; and G. Seaman, New
York.
The cost of attending the confer
ence is very reasonable. Five dol
lars is the registration fee, one dol
lar per day is for board and room, and
transportation is at a reduced rate.
D. W. Weist, gr., general secretary of
the local association, room 31, En
cina, or President W. C. Shelton, '08,
at the Stanford University Inn, will
be glad to talk over this conference
with any men interested.
