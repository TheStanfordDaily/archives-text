The Classical Club held its second
meeting at the Delta Gamma house
last night. The first part of the ev
ening was taken up in completing or
ganization and electing officers. Miss
L. Howell, '08, was elected president,
Miss A. Wallace, '10, secretary, and
Professor H. R. Fair dough, honorary
president. An executive committee
was appointed, consisting of the above
officers and Miss H. E. Russell, '09,
and S. J. Talbot, '10.
Following this, Dr. Harry L. Wil
son, Professor of Roman Archaeol
ogy at Johns Hopkins, spoke on the
"American School of Classical Stud
ies in Rome." Dr. Wilson explained
that this school was founded for re
search work of graduates of Ameri
can universities. He said that many
of them were availing themselves of
the opportunities afforded there. Dr.
Wilson recently held a chair in this
school, the same which Professor
Fairclough is to occupy for a year.
