# Director Meets Schubert Club.
## 
### 
The Schubert Club met at the Kap
pa Kappa Gamma house yesterday
afternoon, and began practice under
the new director, Walter Bartlett.
There was a discussion concerning
an opera to be given in the early part
of next semester, but nothing was de
cided. As there was a deficiency in
membership, Miss H. Binder, '09, was
elected to the club.
