# CANON WRITES BOOK
## HISTORY PROFESSOR AUTHOR OF NOTABLE WORK. "Reading Inferences For English History" is Title of New Publication On the Press. 
### 
Of the historical works of impor
tance which will soon come from the
press of Ginn& Company will be a
book entitled "Reading References
for English History" by Professor H.
L. Cannon of the History department.
This work, which will be entirely
unique in character and will cover a
field which has long felt the want of
such a publication, should take its
place in the world as worthy of the
esteem of the foremost educators.
The author has hai wide exper
ience in secondary-scfiool teaching as
well as in university instruction, serv
ing in the History faculty at the Un
iversity of Cincinnati before coming
to Stanford. His new book is the out
growth of this expedience. It is in
tended primarily for the instructor,
but will be of value to college stud
ents in directing them in their col
lateral reading, to librarians in facil
itating them to find literature called
for by their readers, and to the gen
eral reader who wishes to secure suit
able references on definite topics.
Exact assignments to some fifteen
hundred of the most useful and acces
ible works on English history will be
found in the new book. With these it
is possible for any one to make use
of the facilities at hand, enabling an
instructor, for instance, to direct the
collateral reading of his students with
the maximum amount of efficiency.
The plan of the work includes, first,
a bibliography of all the books re
ferred to; and second, topics and ref
erences covering the whole field of
English history, chronologically di
vided into sections, with special sec
tions for colonial history. Each sec
tion contains a summary of sub-top
ics, such as references to accessible
sources, references to modern works
of a nature especially suitable for high
school students, references to modern
works of a more advanced character,
intended for college students and gen
eral readers, and bibliographical ref
erences designed to facilitate further
reading.
The work concludes with appen
dices that cannot fail to be useful, one
being a chronological index to the im
portant historical characters in the
"Dictionary of National Biography."
The two others relate to historical fic
tion and poetry, prepared by Miss Jo
sephine Smith, A. M., of the Universi
ty of Cincinnati. A minute index ren
ders all the material easily accessi
ble.
