# LECTURES ON GRECIAN LIFE.
## E. W. Hope Addresses Cosmopolitan Clubâ€”Members Decide To Hold Banquet. 
### 
Dr. A. T. Murray, of the Greek de
partment being unable to attend the
meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club last
evening, the lecture which he was to
give on "Life in the Grecian Classi
cal Period" was delivered by Instruct
or E. W. Hope of the same depart
ment.
Instructor Hope told of a great
many interesting customs of the
Greeks, among which were their hab
its of studying. They considered it
a bad custom to receive instruction
from books, preferring to listen to tut
ors. The reason for this was that
there might be ambiguities in books,
while an instructor must explain ev
erything.
After the lecture a business meet
ing was held in which it was decided
to hold a banquet sometime during
the first part of next semester.
