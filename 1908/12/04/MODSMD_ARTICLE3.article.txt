Captain Marshall's successful far
cical comedy " His Excellency the
Governor" will he seen for the first
time here tomorrow evening when
the play will be presented under the
auspices of Sword and Sandals. The
curtain will rise promptly at 8:15 in
Assembly Hall upon the most finish
ed production ever presented by that
organization. As only one play is pre
sented yearly by Sword and Sandals
its best efforts will be embodied in
the presentation.
The members of the cast have com
pleted their work upon the prepara
tion of the production. "His Excel
lency the Governor" was a vehicle of
the Henry Miller Stock Company
which played on this coast a few years
ago. The success of the play was of
long duration, both in the eastern
cities in which it was presented and
on the road.
Sword and Sandals has selected the
play because of ite-Jbigh standard and
on account of itfcjSHlity to hold the
interest of the awuShce throughout.
The members of' the society have
spared no effort or expense to make
this the most complete and success
ful production ever presented here,
and the results obtained during the
past months of preparation fully as
sure an excellent presentation.
The play is a farcical romance,
written by Captain Marshall, an Eng
lish officer of wide experience in the
service, and one who is very familiar
with the life of the British forces
stationed in the tropical posts. This
comedy deals with that life as lived
in the Amandaland islands, a group
of islands in the Indian Ocean under
the sovereignty of England.
Very amusing and laughable situ
ations arise in the development of the
plot, which centers about a semi
tragic revolution of the uncivilized
natives that inhabit those islands. The
government house, being vitally in
terested in the suppression of this
uprising and in the consummation of
several affairs of the heart that are
in progress under ito shadow, enters
into the complications in the person

of "His Excellency," who braves the
wiles of the fairer sex to accomplish
his ends. In dealing with a comic
opera star and with a vivacious
daughter of the representative of the
English government, the governor be
comes party to various situations that
are ludicrous. The final outcome of
the quandaries into which several
members of the group of visitors and
residents upon the island are thrown,
is worked out in a clever and origi
nal manner.
The cast picked by Sword and San
dals from the members of that organ
ization and from the Maskers, who
are assisting in the production, and
the result has been the grouping of
the best talent that the student body
has to offer in the line of theatricals.
It is essentially an all-star cast, as
is shown by the dramatic personae.
Sword and Sandals has also been
very fortunate in securing as coach
for the play, Mr. Fraiik Mathieu, who
has made an enviable reputation
throughout the west for his ability
as a coach of amateur theatricals.
Mr. Mathieu has ha 3 great success
with the present production and is
confident that the final presentation
tomorrow night will far surpass the
ordinary college production. P. R.
Johnson, '09, will act as stage man
ager for the play.
Special effort has been made by
Sword and Sandals in the acquisition
of new accessories and scenery for the
evening. An entirely new stage
setting is now in position, represent
ing the tropical scenery peculiar to
that part of the torrid zone in which
the play is laid. A special study was
made of the government, buildings
characteristic of those islands by the
scenic artist employed by Sword and
Sandals to build the scenes. The re
sult has been a very realistic concep
tion.
The University Orchestra will be in
attendance and will render the fol
lowing program: "Overture," Schep
eringill; "Glow Worm," Linke; "Man
dy Lane,,' and "Mary, Pride of the
Prairie."

The cast picked by Sword and San
dals from the members of that organ
ization and from the Maskers, who
are assisting in the production, and
the result has been the grouping of
the best talent that the student body
has to offer in the line of theatricals.
It is essentially an all-star cast, as
is shown by the dramatic personae.
Sword and Sandals has also been
very fortunate in securing as coach
for the play, Mr. Fraiik Mathieu, who
has made an enviable reputation
throughout the west for his ability
as a coach of amateur theatricals.
Mr. Mathieu has ha 3 great success
with the present production and is
confident that the final presentation
tomorrow night will far surpass the
ordinary college production. P. R.
Johnson, '09, will act as stage man
ager for the play.
Special effort has been made by
Sword and Sandals in the acquisition
of new accessories and scenery for the
evening. An entirely new stage
setting is now in position, represent
ing the tropical scenery peculiar to
that part of the torrid zone in which
the play is laid. A special study was
made of the government, buildings
characteristic of those islands by the
scenic artist employed by Sword and
Sandals to build the scenes. The re
sult has been a very realistic concep
tion.
The University Orchestra will be in
attendance and will render the fol
lowing program: "Overture," Schep
eringill; "Glow Worm," Linke; "Man
dy Lane,,' and "Mary, Pride of the
Prairie."

Captain Marshall's successful far
cical comedy " His Excellency the
Governor" will he seen for the first
time here tomorrow evening when
the play will be presented under the
auspices of Sword and Sandals. The
curtain will rise promptly at 8:15 in
Assembly Hall upon the most finish
ed production ever presented by that
organization. As only one play is pre
sented yearly by Sword and Sandals
its best efforts will be embodied in
the presentation.
The members of the cast have com
pleted their work upon the prepara
tion of the production. "His Excel
lency the Governor" was a vehicle of
the Henry Miller Stock Company
which played on this coast a few years
ago. The success of the play was of
long duration, both in the eastern
cities in which it was presented and
on the road.
Sword and Sandals has selected the
play because of ite-Jbigh standard and
on account of itfcjSHlity to hold the
interest of the awuShce throughout.
The members of' the society have
spared no effort or expense to make
this the most complete and success
ful production ever presented here,
and the results obtained during the
past months of preparation fully as
sure an excellent presentation.
The play is a farcical romance,
written by Captain Marshall, an Eng
lish officer of wide experience in the
service, and one who is very familiar
with the life of the British forces
stationed in the tropical posts. This
comedy deals with that life as lived
in the Amandaland islands, a group
of islands in the Indian Ocean under
the sovereignty of England.
Very amusing and laughable situ
ations arise in the development of the
plot, which centers about a semi
tragic revolution of the uncivilized
natives that inhabit those islands. The
government house, being vitally in
terested in the suppression of this
uprising and in the consummation of
several affairs of the heart that are
in progress under ito shadow, enters
into the complications in the person

of "His Excellency," who braves the
wiles of the fairer sex to accomplish
his ends. In dealing with a comic
opera star and with a vivacious
daughter of the representative of the
English government, the governor be
comes party to various situations that
are ludicrous. The final outcome of
the quandaries into which several
members of the group of visitors and
residents upon the island are thrown,
is worked out in a clever and origi
nal manner.
