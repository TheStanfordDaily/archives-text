# TO PLAY INVINCIBLES
## VARSITY TO INDULGE IN A PRACTICK GAME. Local Club Will Show Its Speed On Sawdust Field Tomorrow— No Admission. 
### 
The varsity will play their first
post-season game tomorrow after
noon when they will meet the "Invin
cibles." The game is scheduled for
3:30 o'clock on the sawdust field and
no admission fee will be charged.
The "Invincibles" are a lately or
ganized club of local Rugby players
and would put up a fast game but for
the heavy condition of the field. All
the men have had previous exper
ience and in their practice line-ups
have shown indications of a good deal
of speed. The mere mention of a few
of the club's members should be suf
ficient to guarantee that a lively
match will be played. Among those
who will oppose the varsity are
"Dutch" Koerner, Harry Horton,
George Presley, "Jim" Reynolds,
"Phil" Johnson, "Cub" Minturn and
other equally well known Stanford
men.
This will be the first of several
games that the varsity hope to play
before they go to Vancouver. Nego
tiations are under way to secure oth
er games with outside organizations
but no dates have been announced.

Varsity—Higley, Terrill, front rank;
Cheda, lock; Crawford, Pemberton,
side rank; Miller Evans, rear rank;
