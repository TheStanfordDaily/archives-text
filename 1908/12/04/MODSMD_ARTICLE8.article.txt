That the University of California
athletic authorities have directed that
a new eight-oared shell be ordered is
worthy of note at Stanford. This ac
tion dispels what doubt there may
have been that rowing would be a
sport engaged in by the athletes of

so assures the engagement of Coach
Murphy by Stanford as soon as he
arrives 011 the campus.

ing season. None but the best first

not be behindhand in providing ad

a shell will probaly have to be pur
chased in the East, and will lie long
in coming to this coast by water, the
only safe way of transportation, it will
be good news to learn in the near fu
ture that the iinest shell has been or
dered for the Stanford crew.
