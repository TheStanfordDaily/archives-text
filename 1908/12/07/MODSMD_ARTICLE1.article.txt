# SUCCEED WITH COMEDY
## LOCAL PLAYERS RECEIVE MUCH DESERVED APPLAUSE "His Excellency the Governor," is Well Presented by Sword and Sandals 
### 
Probably no audience ever left the
Assembly Hall feeling better satisfied
with a performance than the one which
went home Saturday evening to chuckle
reminiscently over the Sword and San
dals play, "His Excellency the Gover
nor." In the first place, the kind of
play chosen (farce-comedy), is a type
sure to be popular with a college audi
ence; in the second place, it is perhaps
the only kind which could be received
with enthusiasm in the gloomy atmos
phere of approaching final examinations,
"llis Excellency's" appearance was well
timed.
Granted that the selection of a play
was a happy one, Ihe 'msl of success
of such a comedy is undoubtedly its
power of entertaining the audience.
This it most certainly did. It would be
hard to pick out one single dull spot
in the entire performance, as the listen
ers proved by the frequency of laughter
and applause, and in general by the
responsive and enthusiastic reception
they gave the play throughout the three
acts.
The best comedy of the evening was
of such a comedy is undoubtedly its
furnished by J. M. Ward, '07, and Miss
M. T. Howell, '10. Ward did more
than create a funny part, though as
Baverstock he was irresistibly amus
ing; he played the role with a sym
pathy that made his audience feel sorry
for the poor secretary even while they
laughed at his eccentricities. Ward's
best scene, his proposal with the aid
of a note-book, was one of the funniest
passages in the play; but at all times
he was consistent in giving an ideal
interpretation of the character.
As Mrs. Wentworth Bolingbroke,
Miss Howell assumed the sort of role
which is usually termed "thankless";
at her hands, however, so much real
humor was infused into the ponderous
chaperone's words and actions that
the part ranked as one of the very
best in the play, and received much
well-deserved applause.
G. N. Richardson, '09, in the title
role, demonstrated once again his
ability to act with perfect ease and
naturalness. In every small detail
his impersonation of Sir Montagu
Martin showed almost professional at
tention, and the pari was in conse
quence thoroughly convincing. The fact
that the sympathies of the audience
were too much on his Excellency s side
to justify the play's ending forms the
only criticism of the play that is gen
erally heard on the campus. Perhaps
an older, rougher, and more jovial
man-of-the-world type would have
been a better characterization, but for
his own conception of the part Rich
ardson could hardly have been im
proved upon.
Miss R. A. Roberts, '09, was perfect
ly adapted to the ingenue part of Ethel
Carlton, and was at all times thorough
ly entertaining and attractive. Play
ing opposite to her was T. A. De Bolt,
'10, as Captain Carew, a part with
rather limited possibilities which he
made the most of . Both De Bolt and
Miss Roberts were at their best in the
scene where Carew teaches Ethel the

new game. This was one of the best
comedy love-scenes ever seen on the
Stanford stage, and was moat enthu
siastically received.
As Stella De Gex, Miss Adaline Wright
'10, played an important part with much
success, especially in the last act and
during the famous barricade scene,
where all of the three women characters
called forth roars of laughter. It was in
the last act, too, that 11. W. Thompson,
'10, did his best work in the role of the
Hon. Henry Carlton, M. P. He and
Miss Wright were both most amusing
during the entire scene.
All of the minor characters were quite
adequately represented, M. F. George,
'00, and.1. A. Visel, '11, impersonating
Captain Rivers and Major Kildare, re
spectively ; A.B.Simpson taking the part
of the clerk, and 11. S. Hunter, '08, the
impassive sentry. W. B. Cohen, '12, as
the butler, showed real ability in mak
ing a minor part thoroughly individual.
Sword and Sandals outdid themselves
in the small details of stage manage
ment, and no amateur play before pre
sented here has passed off more smooth
ly than the one under discussion. The
coach, Mr. Frank Mathieu, deserves all
possible credit for the all-round excell
ence of " His Excellency," the first play
which he has undertaken at Stanford.
