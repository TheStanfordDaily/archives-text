# REY.D.C. GARDNER PREACHES.
## Chaplain Delivers Forceful Sermon on Trinity in University Chapel. 
### 
By request, Itev. D. Charles Gard
ner spoke on the doctrine of the
Trinity yesterday morning in the
Chapel. He distinguished between
doctrine, teaching about truth, and
dogma, truth imposed by authority.
He declared the doctrine of the Trin
ity to be practical and vital, because
it lies at the base of Christian ethics,
Christian worship, Christian theolo
gy and Christian philosophy.
The preacher then traced the idea
of Trinity as found in the Bible, and
as elaborated in the Christian creeds.
The monotheistic idea of God as
found in the old testament is en
riched and developed in the teach
ings of the new testament. The doc
trine of Trinity was defended philos
ophically on the ground that God,
a being who thinks, wills and loves,
must of necessity express himself,
not only in nature and humanity,
which are infinite and incomplete, but
in perfection. Such self-expression
is found in Christ, the eternal word
of the Father. God, the Father re
vealed himself in .Tesus Christ, and
the Spirit carries that revelation in
to the hearts of men.
Rev. Gardner begged his hearers to
avoid tritheism, the idea of three Gods.
God is one. He manifests Himself
in three characters: the Father, Son,
and Spirit. The preacher said in
part: "The true story of every hu
man soul is this: it longs to know
God. But just because of the dark
ness and the doubt about spiritual
tilings, we need some clear revelation
of the Father, some revelation that
we can understand. God meets this
need by the gift of His Son; the
eternal thought of the Father enter
ing our humanity, taking upon Him
self our nature."
