## DAVIS DECLINES RE-ELECTION AS HEAD OF TRUSTEES. Secretary G.E. Crothers Offers His Resignation, Which Takes Effect December 18. 
### 
After waiting for live months to secure
the necessary number to constitute a
quorum, the Board of Trustees met in
the Union Trust building in San Fran
cisco last Friday to conduct a very im
portant meeting.
President Horace Davis declined to al
low his name to be again presented for
the presidency, with the result that Tim
othy Hopkins was nominated and elected
to that position. President Davis did not
care to undertake the responsibilities of
of this position again on account of press
of business. C. P. Eells was selected by
the board to fill the office of vice-presi
dent, while C. G. Lathrop will again
manage the University as its treasurer
and business manager.
G. E. Crothers, '95, offered his resig
nation as secretary of the board and ex
plained that he did not have the leisure
to attend to the duties that are required
of the holder of that otlice. It was only
because of the earnest solicitation of
Mrs. Stanford that he accepted the posi
tion. Crothers however consented to re
main in his present ollicial position until
December 18, when he will leave for New
York on a business trip, at which time
the board will again hold a meeting for
the purpose of electing another secretary.
A seal was adopted as the official insig
nia to be used by the president and fac
ulty upon all diplomas, but although it
will take the place of the old seal that
has hitherto been used, it differs only
slightly from the former one.
Three new library assistants were ap
pointed by the board, including S.
Bryan, '10, W. S. Porter, '11, and Miss
M. M. Dean.
The Commission of Engineers sub
mitted a report to the board, which
was read and accepted as their final
report, as the Commission was dis
banded. This body of engineers was
composed of Professors C. D. Marx, W.
F. Durand and C. B. Wing.
The vacancy made by the death of
Justice T. B. McFarland was not filled,
but was left until the board met again
on December 18.
