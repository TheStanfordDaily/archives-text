# PRESLEY WILL COACH RUGBY AND BASEBALL NEXT YEAR
## Accepts Offer of Executive Committee to Have Full Charge of Both Sports Beginning with September, 1909. 
### 
George J. Presley, '07,
Will be head coach of base
ball and football for one
year, beginning September,
1909, at a salary of $2000.
This was decided at. the
last meeting of the Exec
utive Committee, and
Graduate Manager J. E.
Stewart today announced
that Presley has decided
to sign a contract to this
effect. No assistant coach
will be retained at a sal
ary, and James F. Lana
gan, who has been serving
in an advisory capacity,
will no longer be connect
ed with the coaching
force.
This action was taken
by the Executive Commit
tee after careful consider
ation. The fact that no
assistant coach has been
retained is due to the fact
that it developed this year
that it was more desirable
to have the old players
coach the beginners for
several reasons. It is es
sential that as long as the
graduate coach system is

in vogue that undergraduates be
trained for the position.
The expense that the student, body
will be put to this year for coaches
will be much less than last year,
when Lanagan was given a contract

for the football season at. $1000, Pres
ley one at $1,500 and K. L. Fenton,
'08, $1,000 for the football and base
ball seasons, as assistant. The only
expense this year will be the $2000
paid Presley.
