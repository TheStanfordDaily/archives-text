# VARSITY DEFEATS INVINCIBLES.
## Heavy Field and Poor Form of Players Produce Uninteresting Exhibition. 
### 
The game won by the varsity from '
the Invincibles Saturday afternoon
was an extremely slow and uninter- j
esting exhibition of Rugby. This was 1
partly due to the fact that the In-'
vincibles had but very little oppor-1
tunity in which to practice for the |
game, but the muddy condition of |
the field would have prevented a I
fast exhibition even if the teams had j
been well matched.
The Varsity scored on their oppo
nents almost at will, registering five
tries with one conversion, as against
one try for the Invincibles. The game
was marked throughout by very rag
ged playing by both teams, the Var
sity, in particular, not playing up to
their usual form. Of the five tries |
registered by the Varsity, Holman i
made two, and Miller, Roth and Cook I
were each responsible for one. Two
of the tries were made in the first
half and three in the second period,
one of the latter being converted by
Crawford. Crandall went over the
line for the Invincibles' lone try,
which was not converted.
The line-up follows:
Varsity—Higley, McGregor, Fit
ting, Crawford, Reynolds, Miller, Che
da, forwards; Heinly, wing forward;
Erb, half; Roth, Ganong, fives; Cook,
center; Drew, Holman, wings; Faulk
ner, full.
Invincibles —Crandall, Min
turn, Ilorton, Schaupp, McKenzie,
forwards; Koerner, wing forward;
Elliott, half; Johnson, Presley, fives;
Donovan, center; Worthington, Tal
lant, wings; Brown, full.
