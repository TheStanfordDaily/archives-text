# COTILLION A DECIDED SUCCESS.
## Unique Decorations, Fine Music and Good Management Made Soph. Dance Pleasing. 
### 
The Sophomore Cotillion, which was
held in Encina clubroom last Frfday
night was a thorough success, and will
remain well qualified to be classed
among the best University dances.
The limit of 125 couples attended.
President B.W. Lee, of the Sophomore
class, started the grand march at eight
thirty o'clock, followed by the first co
tillion figure, led by Chairman R. B.
Wheeler. The figures were neat and
original, as well as the favors, which
were gilded butterflies for the ladies and
miniature nets for the men. The favors
for the second figure were paper bou
quets of violets which opened to be fans.
The autumnal scheme of decoration
was beautifully carried out. Woodward
ia fern-brakes were used in abundance
with yellow chrysanthemums. The
chandeliers were covered with large ruf
fled masses of vari-colored tulle, while
the entire ceiling suspended hundreds of
elaborate paper butterflies, thus com
pleting the motif, "The dance of the
butterflies."
