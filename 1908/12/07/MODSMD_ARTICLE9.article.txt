The Executive Committee has done
well in selecting Coach George J.L'resley
to have charge of the Rugby squad next
year. Mr. Presley's work this year has
been above criticism, and the results of
the season justify liis ra-engagement. As
a coach and as a man he has won the
respect of the men under him and of the
entire student body. All things con
sidered, his retention is the best thing
that could happen at this time for
the two sports in which he will coach,
and his acceptance bodes well for the
athletic success of the Cardinal forces
next year.
