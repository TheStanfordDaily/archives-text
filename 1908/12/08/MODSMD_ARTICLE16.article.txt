# WANT PART IN PARADE
## MAY ENTER ROSE TOURNAMENT IN VACATION. Students from Southern California Plan Float in Pasadena New Year's Show. 
### 
Efforts are being made by a number of
Stanford men and women who live in
the southern part of the state to decide
whether there shall be some kind of a
Stanford float in the Tournament of
Roses, the great annual flower festival
held in Pasadena on New Year's day.
A meeting was held of those interested
in the affair last Saturday afternoon.
Twenty-four were present and they were
all strongly in favor of the project. Be
foie the meeting dissolved they agreed
to come together again next Saturday
and at that time it would be finally de
cided whether or not they should under
take the venture.
Since the meeting of last Saturday
the Student Affairs Committee has given
its consent to the project, which had its
origin in a letter from the Pasadena
Chamber of Commerce.
The project is a big one and if it is un
dertaken would entail an immense
amount of work. Just who will bear
the expense of the undertaking is an
other question that will have to be met
at the meeting which will occur at the
hitter part of the week. Other difficult
ies also complicate the undertaking so
that if the matter receives a favorable
vote, those in charge will have many
vexing problems to cope with.
A. C. Stelle, '09, one of the prime
movers in the enterprise, thought that
one of the most effective displays that
could be made would be a float contain
ing about thirty-five Cardinal rooters
seated in bleachers facing a miniature
football field with goal posts at each
end and containing two imitation foot
ball teams. The plan also included an
"S" similar to those used in the last few
intercollegiate contests.
