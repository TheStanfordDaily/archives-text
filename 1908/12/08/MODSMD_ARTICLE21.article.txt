# Exhibition Is Attended by Many.

The exhibition of the Ponting car
bon photographs, which has been held
since Saturday noon in the old studio,
is attracting unusual interest among
the campus residents. Up to the final
closing hour, this evening, over 185
names were 011 the register of visit
ors, and, as there were many who did
not inscribe their names, the number
registered is a poor criterion of the
number of visitors.
The work in the exhibition, which
closed today, is that of Dr. Ponting of
Berkeley, Cal., and London. It is of
such merit lhat the London art gal
leries allowed it to be exhibited 011
their walls, thus giving Dr. Ponting's
work a distinction which they had
never before accorded any photo
graphs.
