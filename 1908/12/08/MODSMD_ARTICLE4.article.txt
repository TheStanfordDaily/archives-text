### 
"Will leave today, if all right—feel
ing fine; please answer. 'Dan' J.
Murphy." The abovj statement ex
plains that the veteran Coach, 'Dan'
Murphy will leave tb<} East today for
Stanford University, and will next
semester be the rowing coach of the
Cardinal crews. This news is hailed
with delight by the oarsmen of the
University, and the prospects for the
boating season are far brighter than
they would have been if Murphy had
been unable to come.
The announcement that Murphy in
tended to leave the East today was re
ceived by Coach Turner this after
noon, and he replied, telling Murphy
to start. Turner states that Coach
Murphy is so anxious to set on the
campus and start work that he will
immediately come to the University
and look over the equipment and add
all necessary materiel, so that by the
first, of next semester training may
not be delayed.
With the return of Coach Dan Mur
phy and the indications that now point
toward a large and excellent rowing
squad, the outlook for a successful
boating season is exceedingly encour
aging. Many of the crew men who
have decided to take an active part in
the work this spring have been doing
light training all this semester, so as
to be in good condition for the nre-

I liminary work early next semester.
J According to the athletes interested
;in boating, arrangements have been
j made for a thorough overhauling of the
j boat house, situated on the shore of
Lagunita, during the Christmas vaca
tion. Beside this, prospects are bright
for a new boat house at Redwood City
and a new shell. The new boathouse
and shell are as yet only probabilities,
but the oarsmen at the present time
think that these new additions will be
made so as to give Murphy ample
equipment.
At the present time, the squad of
men that wil probably don suits when
I Murphy issues his call for men is
large, and many of them have had vast
experience in crew work. With this
material. Murphy will start prelimin
ary work immediately after college
opens.

probably be out next semester: J. It.
Pemberton, 'OS, L. R. Gay, '08, C. H.
