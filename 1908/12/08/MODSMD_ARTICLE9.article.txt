The atention of the members of the
Associated Students is called to the
regular fall election, to be held to
morrow. Ordinarily, the vote at the
fall election has been light, owing to
the fact that in almost every case the
only candidate was a single nominee
for the office of editor-in-chief of The
Daily Palo Alto. Tomorrow, however,
there will be an important contest, the
winner becoming a member of the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Associated
Students for one year. It is for the
best interests of the student body that
every person who is entitled to vote
shall cast a ballot.
