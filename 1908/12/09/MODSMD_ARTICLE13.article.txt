In another column there appears
notice of one step for rhe good of Har
vard University that was taken by the
Student Council. It seems that such a
step would be only one of the things
for good that might lie done if a stu
dent council that had limited author
ity over student conduct were estab
lished at Stanford. The Daily Palo
Alto realizes that a student organiza
tion with authority over the conduct
of students is a subject needing con
siderable discussion l'rom all persons
interested in the University. It is well
to talk over such matters and cite ap
propriate instances of the workings
of any such council— be th«y good or
bad. It is no new opinion that such
a body would be good in most uni
versities. Undoubtedly, if such were
feasible here, it would be a good thing.
We believe it is.
