# RUGBY OUTLOOK BRIGHT
## PROSPECTS FOR NEXT SEASON ARE ENCOURAGING. Large Number of Veterans Expected to Be Eligible for Varsity in Fall of 1909. 
### 
Football prospects have never been
so bright at the close of any season
as they are at the present time. With
fifteen, and possibly eighteen, varsity
veterans eligible for next year's Rugby
fifteen, every indication points to an
other winning season next fall. Sel
dom in the history of the two rival
universities has either had so many
veterans eligible to compete in the
next year's team. Judged from con
ditions now known, almost every
man who played against the Uni
versity of California in this year's
victorious fifteen can be count
ed on to return and take his place
in the Cardinal ranks next season,
with the exception of W. Koerner, '08,
and C. C. Terrill, '08, who do not in
tend to return to college. It is also
possible that J. O. Miller, '08, and J.
E. Pemberton, '08, will also not regis
ter next year, but no definite decision
has been made by them as yet regard
ing this matter. T. R. Cadwalader,
'09, may leave the University this year
to pursue his studies elsewhere.
To compensate for the loss of these
men, several speedy players will ap
pear on the field, v/ho, for various
reasons, were not in the Cardinal
ranks this year. T. Vandervoort, '08,
and H. E. Reed, '10, two of the fast
est backs that ever wore the Cardi
nal, can be relied cn to strengthen
the backfield, while C. A. Thorpe, '09,
and L. R. Minturn, '09, both of the
1907 varsity, will prove extremely val
uable in the forward division.
The pack for next season's fifteen
will be fully as heavy and dangerous
as the aggregation of forwards that
played against California this year. In
addition to the many good players in
the Freshman and second-team packs,
the coach will have the following var
sity forwards to choose from: D. P.
Crawford, '09, J. R. Pemberton, '08,
J. O. Miller, '08, C. A. Thorpe, '09, L.
R. Minturn, '09, G. E. Cheda, '10, R. H.
Reynolds, '10, and K. L. Dole, '11. D.
(J. Heinly, '09, will appear at wing
forward, while K. S. McKenzie, '10
who ran him a close race for the po
sition this year, will be eligible again
next season.
in the backfield Stanford will be
particularly strong, for not only will
every back on the 1908 fifteen be able
to contest, but Vandervoort and Reed,
as well as several promising members
of this year's Freshman team, will ap
pear as candidates for positions. With
such stars as Erb, Mitchell, Ganong,
Scott, Holman, Cadwalader, Cook,
Reed and Vandervoort to chose from,
the Cardinal will have a backfield sec
ond to none on the Coast.
The large number of fast, aggres
sive players who were members of
the second and Freshman fifteens this
year will make the 'competition for
places on the 1909 varsity very keen
and will afford Coach Presley a gen
erous lot of material from which to
pick another winning aggregation.
