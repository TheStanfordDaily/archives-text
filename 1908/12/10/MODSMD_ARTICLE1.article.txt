# PROSPECTS ARE GOOD
## BASEBALL OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR IS PROMISING. Nine of Last Season's Men Expected to Be Out for Varsity Nine in Spring Semester. 
### 
Stanford has the best of prospects
for a victorious baseball season next
year, owing to the fact that nine of the
twelve men who played during the
1908 series are back In college, and
will be eligible to compete on the team
in 1909. This practically assures
Stanford of a veteran baseball nine.

Those who will in all proba
bility be on the diamond are
Captain Sampson, Theile,
Mitchell, Bell, Scott, Cadwala
der, Tallant, Rutledge and
Ganong.
Theile is certain to be the
mainstay of the pitching de
partment. Ho was in the box
all thre games with Califor
nia last spring.
Mitchell and Rutledge will
both be strong men as catch
ers—a fact which makes it
almost certain that the posi
tion behind the bat will be
well filled.
The infield will be strong
and fast. For first base there
is likely to be a good contest
between Bell and Ball. Bell
is a strong man for that posi
tion, having held it down dur
ing last spring. Ball, however.

would be a good man there and is ex
pected to give Bell a run for the place.
Cadwalader will be a strong man to
fill Owen's place at second. He fiHpd
this position in an able manner two
years ago, but, on account of a bad
shoulder, he was unable to keep up
his baseball last spring. His shoulder
is now in good condition, and he oan
be depended on next semester. Samp
son will again be at short, while
Scott will most likely hold down bis
position of last season, that of thvrd
base.
Last season's fielders, Tallant, Can
ong and Rutledge, have a good chance
for their same positions next spring,
but McGregor and Scr field are expect
ed to put up a good fight for places
in the gardens. No other candidates
have so far been found for these po
sitions. The Freshmen, however, are
still to be heard from, and it is un
derstood that there is some good
available material anong the mem
bers of 1912.
Work is fast progressing on the new
diamond that is now being construct
ed in a corner of Stanford Field, and
a good field on which to play will be
a great help to next season's squad.
The greatest confidence is placed in
Coach George Presley, who turned out
such a good team last season, and he
may be relied upon to turn out a
strong nine next spring.
