# MANY TENNIS PLAYERS
## WEALTH OF MATERIAL SHOULD BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR. Several Varsity Cracks and Freshmen Are Promising, Although Not in Highest Class. 
### 
In regard to Stanford's prospects
for tennis next semeuter, the class A
men who have lately represented the
Blue and Gold loom large in any view
that is taken of the situation. Cali
fornia will again have the enviable
Long Brothers, who are among the
best racket wielders on the Coast, both
in the open amateur and intercollegi
ate classes. Melville Long now holds
the Coast championship, and also
ranks high throughout the United
States, having defeated several East
ern cracks in the Del Monte tourna
ment last Septembei. His brother,
Herbert, was at one time State cham
pion.
Stanford will have a goodly bevy of
players next semester. Two varsity
players, P. B. Delano, '08, and T. C.
Henry, '10, are possibilities for the
team. Delano has not played in the
preliminary tournaments this semes
ter, due to pressure of other work, but
he may turn out next spring.
T. C. Henry, '10, who is not in the
University at present, is expected to
play. Henry won his S, both in dou
bles and singles, in his Freshman year
and is a strong, consistent player. He
did not play against the Long broth
ers in the last intercollegiate match,
but he may be considered a strong
opponent.
Captain A. J. Gowan, '09, is another
good player. H. Mann, '09, who is a
player of no mean ability and ranks
equally with the average Western uni
versity player, was a member of the
singles team last year. Mann was bad
ly smashed up in a mine accident last
summer, but he has practically recov
ered and has been practicing consci
entiously lately. He will be out de
terminedly to attempt to break the
long series of defeats at the hands of
Berkeley.
R. A. Gott, '09 is another good man
who is a prospective candidate for the
team. Though he has not played
very much this semester, he may turn
out for practice for the intercollegiate
try-out. Gott played on the doubles
team last season with Captain Gowan.
Besides these players, there are
some likely comers among the upper
class players who have shown up in
the two handicap tournaments. They
are L. Mackey, '10, E. W. Borough, 'OS,
H. Beard, '09, and JI. S. Lyne, '11.
Lyne and Instructor E. Jordan put up
a clever, hard game playing doubles.
D. Caddagan, '11, and E. Kobbe, '11,
who composed the Freshman team last
spring, will be back in the University.
Much interest has been shown in
this branch of athletics this semester.
The two tournaments enrolled ovnr
100 players, and among this number
was an extraordinarily large quota ot
Freshmen, and among them two stand
out as prospective Varsity tennis men,
namely, H. S. Morgan and H. H. Can
terbury. Canterbury, the winner of
the Thiele tournament, was a scratch
man, and by his showing in defeaii.ig
several veterans, placed himself
among the best players in Stanford.
Morgan is likewise one of the best. lie
won the first tourney of the season
from scratch and ran well up in the
Thiele meet, owing 15. Both of these
Freshmen are steady and consistent,
as well as being heady, players.
J. A. Davis, '12, and W. E. Fergu
son, '12, are two more coming players.

Practice with varsity players will
make them good future tennis men.
The Tennis Club has gone through
an energetic preliminary season under
the leadership of President Mann, and
through their untiring efforts the Uni
versity will have three new courts
completed before the next intercolle
giate matches. These courts, which
are laid out near the present Encina
courts, will be available for spring
training. Before the intercollegiate
matches are played here in 1910, a sec
ond asphalt court will be ready for
use by the Stanford players.

J. A. Davis, '12, and W. E. Fergu
son, '12, are two more coming players.

Practice with varsity players will
make them good future tennis men.
The Tennis Club has gone through
an energetic preliminary season under
the leadership of President Mann, and
through their untiring efforts the Uni
versity will have three new courts
completed before the next intercolle
giate matches. These courts, which
are laid out near the present Encina
courts, will be available for spring
training. Before the intercollegiate
matches are played here in 1910, a sec
ond asphalt court will be ready for
use by the Stanford players.
In regard to Stanford's prospects
for tennis next semeuter, the class A
men who have lately represented the
Blue and Gold loom large in any view
that is taken of the situation. Cali
fornia will again have the enviable
Long Brothers, who are among the
best racket wielders on the Coast, both
in the open amateur and intercollegi
ate classes. Melville Long now holds
the Coast championship, and also
ranks high throughout the United
States, having defeated several East
ern cracks in the Del Monte tourna
ment last Septembei. His brother,
Herbert, was at one time State cham
pion.
Stanford will have a goodly bevy of
players next semester. Two varsity
players, P. B. Delano, '08, and T. C.
Henry, '10, are possibilities for the
team. Delano has not played in the
preliminary tournaments this semes
ter, due to pressure of other work, but
he may turn out next spring.
T. C. Henry, '10, who is not in the
University at present, is expected to
play. Henry won his S, both in dou
bles and singles, in his Freshman year
and is a strong, consistent player. He
did not play against the Long broth
ers in the last intercollegiate match,
but he may be considered a strong
opponent.
Captain A. J. Gowan, '09, is another
good player. H. Mann, '09, who is a
player of no mean ability and ranks
equally with the average Western uni
versity player, was a member of the
singles team last year. Mann was bad
ly smashed up in a mine accident last
summer, but he has practically recov
ered and has been practicing consci
entiously lately. He will be out de
terminedly to attempt to break the
long series of defeats at the hands of
Berkeley.
R. A. Gott, '09 is another good man
who is a prospective candidate for the
team. Though he has not played
very much this semester, he may turn
out for practice for the intercollegiate
try-out. Gott played on the doubles
team last season with Captain Gowan.
Besides these players, there are
some likely comers among the upper
class players who have shown up in
the two handicap tournaments. They
are L. Mackey, '10, E. W. Borough, 'OS,
H. Beard, '09, and JI. S. Lyne, '11.
Lyne and Instructor E. Jordan put up
a clever, hard game playing doubles.
D. Caddagan, '11, and E. Kobbe, '11,
who composed the Freshman team last
spring, will be back in the University.
Much interest has been shown in
this branch of athletics this semester.
The two tournaments enrolled ovnr
100 players, and among this number
was an extraordinarily large quota ot
Freshmen, and among them two stand
out as prospective Varsity tennis men,
namely, H. S. Morgan and H. H. Can
terbury. Canterbury, the winner of
the Thiele tournament, was a scratch
man, and by his showing in defeaii.ig
several veterans, placed himself
among the best players in Stanford.
Morgan is likewise one of the best. lie
won the first tourney of the season
from scratch and ran well up in the
Thiele meet, owing 15. Both of these
Freshmen are steady and consistent,
as well as being heady, players.
J. A. Davis, '12, and W. E. Fergu
son, '12, are two more coming players.
