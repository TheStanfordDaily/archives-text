# VARSITY WILL CONTEST FOR INTERNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
## Rugby Team, Accompanied by Coach Presley and Manager Stewart, Will Leave for the North on Saturday, 19, to Meet Vancouver 
### 
On Saturday afternoon, December
19, the varsity Rugby team, five sub
stitutes, and Coach Presley and Man
ager Stewart will leave the campus for
Vancouver. The trip will be made by
train, instead of by boat, as has been
the case heretofore. This is the third

successive Christmas trip the Stan
ford fifteen has taken to British Co
lumbia to contest for the international
championship, which carries with it
the magnificent Cooper-Keith trophy;
and, although the Northerners have
been successful in the two preceding
series, the chances for a victory this
year are very bright. The varsity will
be gone the entire vacation, leaving
Vancouver on the return journey Jan
uary 2, and arriving on the campus
about January 7.
Three games are scheduled; one
team winning two will capture the
championship. One will be played on
Christmas Day, one on December 28
and the final contest will take place
on New Year's Day. All of these
games will be played with the Van
couver fifteen on Broeton Point Field,
near Vancouver. During its stay in
the northern city, the varsity will
make its headquarters at the St. Fran
cis Hotel.
The team that will represent Stan
ford in this series is probably strong
er than either of the fifteens that
made the trip in former years. With
but three exceptions, the personnel of
the team will be the same as the orig
inal line-up in the Stanford-California
contest. W. Koerner. '08, T. R. Cad
walader, '09, and L. S. Scott. '10. will
be unable to make the journey, and
their places will be filled by W. B.
Higley, '08, A. B. Cook, '10, and A. E.
Roth, '09, respectively. This change
will not weaken (he team, as both Hig
ley, Cook and oRth ran the successful
candidates a close race for the posi
tions on the varsity this fall. This
year's aggregation of players is ad
mittedly the fastest and cleverest fif
teen that ever represented the Card
inal, and the showing made against
the Vancouver team In the last game
of the series played on the campus

gives ground for Stanford's support
ers to expect their team to capture
the trophy this year.
The varsity will be in good condi
tion for the series, having practiced
faithfully since the Thanksgiving va
cation. Although the team has had
no opportunity to line up against an
outside fifteen since the California
game, the men have not lost any of
their speed or fight. It is probable
that, the Olympics will meet the var
sity Saturday, and thus afford it a
chance to participate in one fast con
test before the Vancouver series.
The team will line up as follows for
the Northern games: Terrill, Higley,
front rank; Dole, lock; Crawford,
Pemberton, side rank; Evans, Miller,
rear rank; Heinly, wing forward; Erb,
half; Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Roth,
center; Cook, Holman, wings; Faulk
ner, full. The following men will ac
company the team as substitutes: Mc-
Gregor, Cheda, Elliott, Drew, Brown.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton will be unable
to take the trip this year, but Coach
Presley and Manager Stewart will
both accompany the team. It is also
probable that Dr. Frank Angell, chair
man of the Faculty Committee on Ath
letics, will be a member of the party,
although not in any official capacity;
his intention being merely to take a
vacation trip.
According to the terms prescribed
by the donor of the Cooper-Keith tro
phy, the team winning the annual con
test between Stanford and California
is entitled to meet the Vancouver team
in the series to decide who shall have
possession of the cup for the year.
Three games are played, the interna
tional championship and the trophy
going to the team winning two of
them. There is a further provision
that the international series shall be
held on the home grounds of the fif
teen that was victorious the year pre
ceding. Thus, should Stanford be vic
torious this year, series will be
played on Stanford Field next year,
should the Cardinal also win the Cal
ifornia game next fall.
The Northerners are making great
plans to entertain their visitors and
to return the welcome which they re
ceived when they visited Stanford this
fall. Although no details can be
learned, it is said that the plans made
by the British Colombians surpass
even the elaborate hospitality shown
the Cardinal visitors last Christ
mas.
While the Vancouver team is pre
paring to show the Stanford aggrega
tion a royal time, they have also been
practicing hard and faithfully with a
view to retaining possession of the
Cooper-Keith cup. The team that will
meet the Cardinal will be a much
stronger fifteen than the one that via
ited here, sorm changes having been
made in the line-up. That the games
will he close and hard-fought, is con
ceded, but the Stanford team has at
least an even break ttith the North
erners, and should, if the field is no 1
too heavy, br'ng home the trpphy

championship. One will be played on
Christmas Day, one on December 28
and the final contest will take place
on New Year's Day. All of these
games will be played with the Van
couver fifteen on Broeton Point Field,
near Vancouver. During its stay in
the northern city, the varsity will
make its headquarters at the St. Fran
cis Hotel.
The team that will represent Stan
ford in this series is probably strong
er than either of the fifteens that
made the trip in former years. With
but three exceptions, the personnel of
the team will be the same as the orig
inal line-up in the Stanford-California
contest. W. Koerner. '08, T. R. Cad
walader, '09, and L. S. Scott. '10. will
be unable to make the journey, and
their places will be filled by W. B.
Higley, '08, A. B. Cook, '10, and A. E.
Roth, '09, respectively. This change
will not weaken (he team, as both Hig
ley, Cook and oRth ran the successful
candidates a close race for the posi
tions on the varsity this fall. This
year's aggregation of players is ad
mittedly the fastest and cleverest fif
teen that ever represented the Card
inal, and the showing made against
the Vancouver team In the last game
of the series played on the campus

gives ground for Stanford's support
ers to expect their team to capture
the trophy this year.
The varsity will be in good condi
tion for the series, having practiced
faithfully since the Thanksgiving va
cation. Although the team has had
no opportunity to line up against an
outside fifteen since the California
game, the men have not lost any of
their speed or fight. It is probable
that, the Olympics will meet the var
sity Saturday, and thus afford it a
chance to participate in one fast con
test before the Vancouver series.
The team will line up as follows for
the Northern games: Terrill, Higley,
front rank; Dole, lock; Crawford,
Pemberton, side rank; Evans, Miller,
rear rank; Heinly, wing forward; Erb,
half; Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Roth,
center; Cook, Holman, wings; Faulk
ner, full. The following men will ac
company the team as substitutes: Mc-
Gregor, Cheda, Elliott, Drew, Brown.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton will be unable
to take the trip this year, but Coach
Presley and Manager Stewart will
both accompany the team. It is also
probable that Dr. Frank Angell, chair
man of the Faculty Committee on Ath
letics, will be a member of the party,
although not in any official capacity;
his intention being merely to take a
vacation trip.
According to the terms prescribed
by the donor of the Cooper-Keith tro
phy, the team winning the annual con
test between Stanford and California
is entitled to meet the Vancouver team
in the series to decide who shall have
possession of the cup for the year.
Three games are played, the interna
tional championship and the trophy
going to the team winning two of
them. There is a further provision
that the international series shall be
held on the home grounds of the fif
teen that was victorious the year pre
ceding. Thus, should Stanford be vic
torious this year, series will be
played on Stanford Field next year,
should the Cardinal also win the Cal
ifornia game next fall.
The Northerners are making great
plans to entertain their visitors and
to return the welcome which they re
ceived when they visited Stanford this
fall. Although no details can be
learned, it is said that the plans made
by the British Colombians surpass
even the elaborate hospitality shown
the Cardinal visitors last Christ
mas.
While the Vancouver team is pre
paring to show the Stanford aggrega
tion a royal time, they have also been
practicing hard and faithfully with a
view to retaining possession of the
Cooper-Keith cup. The team that will
meet the Cardinal will be a much
stronger fifteen than the one that via
ited here, sorm changes having been
made in the line-up. That the games
will he close and hard-fought, is con
ceded, but the Stanford team has at
least an even break ttith the North
erners, and should, if the field is no 1
too heavy, br'ng home the trpphy


Captain Sampson.
On Saturday afternoon, December
19, the varsity Rugby team, five sub
stitutes, and Coach Presley and Man
ager Stewart will leave the campus for
Vancouver. The trip will be made by
train, instead of by boat, as has been
the case heretofore. This is the third

successive Christmas trip the Stan
ford fifteen has taken to British Co
lumbia to contest for the international
championship, which carries with it
the magnificent Cooper-Keith trophy;
and, although the Northerners have
been successful in the two preceding
series, the chances for a victory this
year are very bright. The varsity will
be gone the entire vacation, leaving
Vancouver on the return journey Jan
uary 2, and arriving on the campus
about January 7.
