## MANTEISTA TO BE CHAPTER OF DELTA DELTA DELTA. Grant Was Made on December 1 to Members Who Were in Club Last Year. 
### 
"The Manteista Club hereby an
nounce that they have been granted a
charter of the Delta Delta Delta Fra
ternity. Owing to the fact that tho
close of the semester is so near, the
installation of the chapter has been
postponed until early in January." Tho
foregoing statement was made by
Manteista this afternoon.
Several weeks ago rumors were cur
rent on the campus that a charter of
"Tri-Delt" had been granted to Man
teista. On the authority of a member
of that sorority, now :n attendance in
the University, The Daily Palo Alto
denied these rumors. The statement
was made that the last convention of
the sorority, which was held last sum
mer, did not grant the charter. These
assertions are now borne out by the
fact, announced today by a member
of Manteista, that the charter was
granted to the club by the council of
Delta Delta Delta on the first day of
the current month.
Manteista stated today that the
members of the club to whom the
charter was granted were those in the
club last year. The members of the
club at that time wera the Misses A.
