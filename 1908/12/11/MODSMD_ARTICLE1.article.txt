# TRACK OUTLOOK BETTER
## RETURN OF OLD MEN MAKES UP PARTIALLY FOR LOSSES. "Dad" Will Have Considerable Material of Worth from Which to Pick Cardinal Team. 
### 
The prospects for a Stanford vic
tory at. the close of the next track
season seem much more favorable
than was generally believed at the
end of the last semester. At that
time the knowledge that such point
winners as Reed, Brown, Bellah and
Maundrell would not be eligible to
compete in the seaton of 1909 tem
porarily shattered ary hopes of win
ning from California in the annual

meet next spring.
But though the loss of
these men will he severely
felt, their absence has
been partially compensat
ed for b v the unexpected
return of some other good
athletes, and there seems
to be a considerable amount
of good material available.
Of the point-winners in
the last meet, it is expected
that nearly every man will
be on the t.ack next spring.
This list includes Captain
Horton, Holman, Bradford,
Vandevoort, Martin, Ad
ams, Morris, Wyman, Coo
nan, McGregor, Gardner,
Peaslee, Scott. Kocher,
Waring, Poor. The addi
tion of Miller, Crawford
and Rawles makes a good
number of athletes of
proven point-winning abil
ity. And the loss of some

of the stars of last spring's season is
further offset by the fact that Cali
fornia has lost two of the heaviest
point-winners in that contest in Stan
ton and Munn.
If Captain Horton lives up to the
form of last season, he should have
no difficulty in winning the shot put,
though he will be forced to his best
to take the hurdles from Captain
Cowles and Edwarda of California.
Holman must continue to be the main
stay of the Cardina\ in the sprints,
though W. H. Cline, *11, and E. O. Bill
willer, '09, showed up well in the fall
training and gives promise of becom
ing good varsity material. These, with
Vandervoort again in the sprints, and
Gardner and Smitherum of last year's
team, make this department strong. In
the hurdles there will be, besides Hor
ton, Gregg, Morris, Peaslee, Boyd and
Cline.
The return of W. M. Wyman, '11,
and the presence of W. M. Ilawles,
'09, will greatly strengthen the quar
ter-mile, where Miller, Coonan, Mc-
Gregor, Wheeler an-l .Johnson will
also be in evidence. In the half, Mil
ler's phenomenal performance of
1:58 2-5 at the Chicago meet marks
him as the probable winner in this
event. Hemphill, McGregor, Lee and
Bradford are also good at this dis
tance. On form, Bradford should
again win the mile, while Sweet and
Adams wil be in a position to give
any one a good run in the two-mile
race. W. S. Porter, '11, in the mile
and G. Bevier, '11, in the longer dis
tance have also been showing up well.
R. IT. St. John, '11. and E. C. Tem
pleton, '10, have shown improvement

and may prove available this year.
More than one place should fall to
Stanford in the shot, with Crawford,
'09, K. Dole, '11, and E. S. Evenden, '11,
assisting Captain Horton. Crawford
should win the hammer throw, and
constant improvement in this event
points to M. P. Youker, '10, as a likely
point-winner.
Vandervoort's return would also
give Stanford the advantage in the
broad jump, in which the Cardinal's
chances may be weakened by the pos
sible loss of T. D. Meddick, '11. Scott,
would be able to place in this event,
if he can be induced to enter track
training, in addition to his work on
the diamond. The return of D. G.
Martin, '10, seems to be uncertain,
but Poor, Waring and Otis will all
be in the staff of high jumpers.
The loss of Bellah makes Stanford
weak in the pole vault, and there
seems to be no one capable of filling
his place. Scott is capable of a good
performance in this event, as is Kocli
er, if he returns next semester;
while Cook and Waiing are capable
of improvement.
The prospects for a Stanford vic
tory at. the close of the next track
season seem much more favorable

Holman must continue to be the main
stay of the Cardina\ in the sprints,
though W. H. Cline, *11, and E. O. Bill
willer, '09, showed up well in the fall
training and gives promise of becom
ing good varsity material. These, with
Vandervoort again in the sprints, and
Gardner and Smitherum of last year's
team, make this department strong. In
the hurdles there will be, besides Hor
ton, Gregg, Morris, Peaslee, Boyd and
Cline.
The return of W. M. Wyman, '11,
and the presence of W. M. Ilawles,
'09, will greatly strengthen the quar
ter-mile, where Miller, Coonan, Mc-
Gregor, Wheeler an-l .Johnson will
also be in evidence. In the half, Mil
ler's phenomenal performance of
1:58 2-5 at the Chicago meet marks
him as the probable winner in this
event. Hemphill, McGregor, Lee and
Bradford are also good at this dis
tance. On form, Bradford should
again win the mile, while Sweet and
Adams wil be in a position to give
any one a good run in the two-mile
race. W. S. Porter, '11, in the mile
and G. Bevier, '11, in the longer dis
tance have also been showing up well.
R. IT. St. John, '11. and E. C. Tem
pleton, '10, have shown improvement

and may prove available this year.
More than one place should fall to
Stanford in the shot, with Crawford,
'09, K. Dole, '11, and E. S. Evenden, '11,
assisting Captain Horton. Crawford
should win the hammer throw, and
constant improvement in this event
points to M. P. Youker, '10, as a likely
point-winner.
Vandervoort's return would also
give Stanford the advantage in the
broad jump, in which the Cardinal's
chances may be weakened by the pos
sible loss of T. D. Meddick, '11. Scott,
would be able to place in this event,
if he can be induced to enter track
training, in addition to his work on
the diamond. The return of D. G.
Martin, '10, seems to be uncertain,
but Poor, Waring and Otis will all
be in the staff of high jumpers.
The loss of Bellah makes Stanford
weak in the pole vault, and there
seems to be no one capable of filling
his place. Scott is capable of a good
performance in this event, as is Kocli
er, if he returns next semester;
while Cook and Waiing are capable
of improvement.
The prospects for a Stanford vic
tory at. the close of the next track
season seem much more favorable
than was generally believed at the
end of the last semester. At that
time the knowledge that such point
winners as Reed, Brown, Bellah and
Maundrell would not be eligible to
compete in the seaton of 1909 tem
porarily shattered ary hopes of win
ning from California in the annual

meet next spring.
But though the loss of
these men will he severely
felt, their absence has
been partially compensat
ed for b v the unexpected
return of some other good
athletes, and there seems
to be a considerable amount
of good material available.
Of the point-winners in
the last meet, it is expected
that nearly every man will
be on the t.ack next spring.
This list includes Captain
Horton, Holman, Bradford,
Vandevoort, Martin, Ad
ams, Morris, Wyman, Coo
nan, McGregor, Gardner,
Peaslee, Scott. Kocher,
Waring, Poor. The addi
tion of Miller, Crawford
and Rawles makes a good
number of athletes of
proven point-winning abil
ity. And the loss of some

of the stars of last spring's season is
further offset by the fact that Cali
fornia has lost two of the heaviest
point-winners in that contest in Stan
ton and Munn.
If Captain Horton lives up to the
form of last season, he should have
no difficulty in winning the shot put,
though he will be forced to his best
to take the hurdles from Captain
Cowles and Edwarda of California.
Holman must continue to be the main
