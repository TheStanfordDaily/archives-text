In releasing the editorship of The
Daily Palo Alto, we wish to thank
those who have helped to make the
paper this semester. We appreciate
them personally and as a staff. Their
services have been indispensable, and
it is with regret that official rela
tions with them are severed by the
retiring editor.
Mr. D. H. Walker, Jr., who will
have charge of The Daily Palo Alto
next semester, is fit for his position
of editor-in-chief. He has been a
faithful member of the staff since he
was first appointed in his Freshman
year; his newspaper experience is,
comparatively speaking, large; and as
a conservative leader, he deserves the
confidence of the entire student body.
