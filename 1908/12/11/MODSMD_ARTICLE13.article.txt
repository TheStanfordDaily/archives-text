# Special Music for Next Sunday.
## 
### 
Special music will be a feature of
next Sunday's service, at which Dr. C.

F. Kent of Yale University will preach.
F. W. McNulty, '09, will sing "Callest
Thou Thus, O Mastfv?" by Mietzke.
The anthem, "I Will Sing of Thy Pow
er," will be rendered by the Chapel
choir. An orchestra will furnish ad
ditional music, playing as a prelude a
selection from "Parsifal."
As Sunday's will be the last Uni
versity service to be held in the Chap
el ibis semester, sp icial pains have
been taken to secure Dr. Kent, who
is Woolsey Professor of Biblical Lit
erature at Yale.
