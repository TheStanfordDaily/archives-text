To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
May 1 ask space in your columns
to correct a wrong impression which
may possibly be drawn by your read
ers from the introductory note to my
article in the December Sequoia? I
accepted the editor's invitation in the
vain hope, perhaps, that something
could be written which would not stir
up controversy. When 1 was shown
the proposed "reply" to my article, it
was plain that I had failed in this
attempt. Both Professor Clark and
myself, who were consulted, were con
vinced of the unwisdom of reopening,
through the public press, the recent
Plug Ugly affair, and advised the sup
pression of both articles. In this
point of view the editor acquiesced.
Later, permission to run my article
alone was asked and reluctantly
granted, 011 the ground that otherwise
the Sequoia would not be able to ap
pear before the close of the semester.
[ may also call attention to a lib
erty which the editor has taken with
my title. I wrote, 'From the Com
mittee Point of View," and not, "From
the Student. Affairs Committee's Point
of View." The difference is not great;
but then, I prefer my own version.
There is also a misquotation in the
extract from President White's ad
dress (due doubtless to a slip of my
own pen: I was not shown a proof),
which makes rather pointless a later
remark in the article. President
White said, "In Heaven's name, be
men," not "In Heaven's name, be true
to yourselves."
O L. ELLIOTT.
