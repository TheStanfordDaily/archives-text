# TALK OF MORE RACES
## WASHINGTON COACH SUGGESTS TRIANGULAR REGATTAS. Stanford Oarsmen Are Considering Proposition.â€”Wisconsin May Also Enter. 
### 
Word has been received from the
North that there will be a number of
rowing contests held there next spring,
and that, if satisfactory arrangements
can be made, the Cardinal oarsmen
are invited to enter (he races. The
announcement of these races was re
ceived by Coach Turner from Coach
Conibear of the University of Wash
ington.
According to the northern coach,
the boating enthusiasts of the Paget
Sound region are planning on a num
ber of interesting events in this sport
for next spring, during the Alaska-
Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Another
event often suggested in connection
I with the exposition is a race in which
the University of Wisconsin would
compete.
Among the events now anticipated is
a two-mile race among Stanford, Cal
ifornia and Washington for the Pa
cific Coast championship. The race is
to take place near San Francisco or
any place named by the Stanford and
California crews. Another race is to
be for the Coast championship in a
four-mile race. This race is to be
among the same crews as the first,
but is to take place in the North. At
the same time of this race, Coach Con
ibear desires that each college rep
resented bring, beside the varsity, a
freshman crew. This crew is to be an
eight-oared crew, and is to race for
the distance of two miles.
Coach Conibear of Washington is
very anxious to bring about these
races, and is now finding out just what
dates would be feasible for all con
cerned. Although no arrangements
have been talked over in regard to
the cost of such an adventure, Coach
Conibear has suggested that Stanford
and California give $250 each, when
Washington comes down for the first
race, and that Washington will give
in return to Stanford and California
$400 each when they go North. As
yet no definite idea Las been decided
on by the Stanford oarsmen, but they
think it a good proposition and are
at the present time considering it.
