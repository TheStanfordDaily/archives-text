# LAST GAME TOMORROW
## VARSITY MEETS INVINCIBLES IN PRACTICE CONTEST. Final Rugby Exhibition of the Season to Be Held on Sawdust Field at 3:45. 
### 
The last Rugby game for this sea
son will be played tomorrow on the
sawdust field at 3:45, when the var
sity lines up against (he Invincibles.
The original plan for tomorrow's
game was that the Olympics should
appear against the varsity, but, owing
to the fact that several members of
the San Francisco team were unable
to play tomorrow, the contest with
the Invincibles was arranged. As the
field is drying rapidly, a good exhibi
tion of Rugby can be expected. Both
teams have been practicing the last
week, and the varsity, in particular,
is in the best of trim.
The Invincible line-up has not yet
been definitely determined, but it is
probable that it will be nearly the
same as in the game last Saturday.
The personnel of the varsity will be
the same as announced for the Van
couver trip. No admission will be
charged to the game. The line-ups
follow:
Varsity—Terrill, Higley, McGregor,
Dole, Crawford, Pemberton, Cheda,
Evans, Miller, forwards; Heinly, wing
forward; Erb, half; Mitchell, Ganong,
fives; Roth, center; Cook, Holman,
Drew, wings; Faulkner, full.
Invincibles—Crandall, Giesy, Hine,
Minturn, Horton, Reynolds, Thorpe,
forwards; Koerner, wing forward; El
liott, half; Johnson, Presley, fives;
Donovan, center; Macomber, Tallant,
wings; Brown, full.
