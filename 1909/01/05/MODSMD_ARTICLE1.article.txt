STANFORD 16, VANCOUVER 10.
The Stanford Rugby Varsity re
turned to the campus this morning af
ter one of the most successful trips
ever taken by a Stanford team. Each
member of the squad is enthusiastic
over the generous hospitality accord
ed them by their British hosts.
The men left the campus on De
cember 19. During the trip three
games were won by the Cardinal
team. The first two games were chief
ly contests of the forwards. Vancou
ver was bested in the line-outs and
in the loose plays. Stanford used the
high kick, and the pack charged down
repeatedly, smothering the plays of
the northern team.
Stanford has now become the pos
sessor of the valuable Cooper-Keith
trophy, which was offered to the win
ner of the series of three games be
tween Vancouver and the victor of
the intercollegiate contest here. This
trophy will remain at the University
for one year, as it is a perpetual
prize. In the first contest the Varsity
outplayed their opponents. In the sec
ond game, Vancouver could not start
any plays, as the Stanford men were
on top of them all the time. In the
last match, however, Vancouver was
the stronger team and showed a won
derful improvement.
The entertainment of the team
while in Vancouver consisted of a
launch ride up the North Arm. Here
the British Columbia power-house
was viewed. Also a smoker was given
by the National Sports Club, at which
United States Consul West, the Mayor
of Vancouver and the Lieutenant-Gov
ernor of British Columbia were pres
ent. A theater party and dance were
given in their honor.
The first match was played on
Christmas Day. The Northern team
was outplayed and outweighed in this
game. About 1500 Rugby enthusiasts
witnessed the game, and declared the
team won. Cheda was substi
tuted .for Pemberton, who was un
able to play on account of illness. On
a fumble of a punt by Brydone-Jack, j
near the goal posts, Cheda scored a '
try and the first half ended with a ;
score of 3-0. In the second half some
loose work gave Stanford a chance to j
show their sprinting ability, and a
couple of individual runs resulted in i
tries by Cheda and Holman.
The second game, which was play
ed the following Tuesday, was as de
cisive as the first. <n this game Ev
ans figured conspicuously, getting the
ball on a line-out and he carried it
sixty yards to Vancouver's five-yard 1
line, where he passed to Holman, who
scored a try. Cheda gave a wonder
ful exhibition of Rugby in both con
tests.
The third and last game of the se
ries was the best of all, from a spec
tacular point of view. The game took

place in a snowstorm, and the ground
was in bad shape, being frozen hard.
At the end of the first half, Vancou
ver was ahead by a score of 10-3, but
in the second half the Varsity rallied
and made three more scores by the
splendid individual runs of Roth, Hol
man and Miller.

STANFORD 0, VANCOUVER 0.
STANFORD 10, VANCOUVER
STANFORD 16, VANCOUVER 10.
The Stanford Rugby Varsity re
turned to the campus this morning af
ter one of the most successful trips
ever taken by a Stanford team. Each
member of the squad is enthusiastic
over the generous hospitality accord
ed them by their British hosts.
The men left the campus on De
cember 19. During the trip three
games were won by the Cardinal
team. The first two games were chief
ly contests of the forwards. Vancou
ver was bested in the line-outs and
in the loose plays. Stanford used the
high kick, and the pack charged down
repeatedly, smothering the plays of
the northern team.
Stanford has now become the pos
sessor of the valuable Cooper-Keith
trophy, which was offered to the win
ner of the series of three games be
tween Vancouver and the victor of
the intercollegiate contest here. This
trophy will remain at the University
for one year, as it is a perpetual
prize. In the first contest the Varsity
outplayed their opponents. In the sec
ond game, Vancouver could not start
any plays, as the Stanford men were
on top of them all the time. In the
last match, however, Vancouver was
the stronger team and showed a won
derful improvement.
The entertainment of the team
while in Vancouver consisted of a
launch ride up the North Arm. Here
the British Columbia power-house
was viewed. Also a smoker was given
by the National Sports Club, at which
United States Consul West, the Mayor
of Vancouver and the Lieutenant-Gov
ernor of British Columbia were pres
ent. A theater party and dance were
given in their honor.
The first match was played on
Christmas Day. The Northern team
was outplayed and outweighed in this
game. About 1500 Rugby enthusiasts
witnessed the game, and declared the
team won. Cheda was substi
tuted .for Pemberton, who was un
able to play on account of illness. On
a fumble of a punt by Brydone-Jack, j
near the goal posts, Cheda scored a '
try and the first half ended with a ;
score of 3-0. In the second half some
loose work gave Stanford a chance to j
show their sprinting ability, and a
couple of individual runs resulted in i
tries by Cheda and Holman.
The second game, which was play
ed the following Tuesday, was as de
cisive as the first. <n this game Ev
ans figured conspicuously, getting the
ball on a line-out and he carried it
sixty yards to Vancouver's five-yard 1
line, where he passed to Holman, who
scored a try. Cheda gave a wonder
ful exhibition of Rugby in both con
tests.
The third and last game of the se
ries was the best of all, from a spec
tacular point of view. The game took

place in a snowstorm, and the ground
was in bad shape, being frozen hard.
At the end of the first half, Vancou
ver was ahead by a score of 10-3, but
in the second half the Varsity rallied
and made three more scores by the
splendid individual runs of Roth, Hol
man and Miller.
