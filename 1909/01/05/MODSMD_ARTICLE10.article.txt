Much has been said concerning
what The Daily Palo Alto should
stand for in the community. It is our
belief that its chief function lies in
completely and accurately gathering
the news, and, secondly, in directing
and voicing the opinions of the Stu
dent Body. We do not believe in prec
edent when it hampers or retards
progress. A practice which has been
followed and found sane and benefi
cial should be preserved.
The Daily Palo Alto is the result
of a gradual growth along rigid lines.
As a representative University daily,
we feel it has attained a standard of
which we have just cause to be proud.
To attempt any serious deviation from
the fundamentals of previous volumes
would be changing for the mere sake
of change.
We believe there is room for im
provement, but that it should be along
lines which have permanency. Such
are our aims for the present semester.
As a newsgatherer, The Daily Palo
Alto should contain an accurate ac
count of the activities and of every
phase and factor of the community. As
a Student Body organ, it is our first
duty to carefully cover the athletic
and general news of the undergradu
ates. Our duty doeÂ« not stop here,
however, but includes the recording
of results in the mere serious busi
ness of the University. New ideas ad
vanced by members of the community
other than students, should find their
way into our columns. We believe
lhat in this direction more can be
accomplished than, perhaps, in any
other. To achieve the best results,
we must have co-operation such as
has not been accorded in the past.
The Student Body should have an
organ capable of voicing its views at
all times. Editorially, we stand to
foster the best interests of the Stu
dent Body. By so doing we advance
the University.
