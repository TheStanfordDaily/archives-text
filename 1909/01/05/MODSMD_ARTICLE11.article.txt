Stanford University, through the
splendid efforts of the Varsity Rugby
Fifteen, has won the right to the in
tercollegiate championship of this
State and to the Coast international
championship, a combination of posi
tions never before held by any or
ganization. To say we are proud of

the men who have made this possible
would be mildly stating it.
The players and coaches and train
er, who have devoted themselves to
this end, have shown the best type of
Stanford Spirit. Clean, sportsman
like football was played against all
sorts of opponents and tactics.
The Rugby Varsity of 1908 will long
remain an illustrious example in
Stanford history.
