# SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE ACTS.
## Increased Number of Students Placed on Strict Probation.â€”Ninety-one one Fail. 
### 
Ninety-one students will not be
permitted ot resume their work in the
University this semester because of
scholarship deficiencies incurred in
the session just cloned, and for sim
ilar reasons fifty-five students have
been placed on strict probation.
The figures given above disclose a
marked increase in the number of
those who have been probationed, but,
contrary to the general impression
prevalent among the undergraduates,
this is not due ot any new addition
to the regulations that govern the
proceedings of the Committee on De
linquent Scholarship. Section 2 of
the faculty rules, under which this
committee takes its actions, confers
the power of placing 011 probation any
"student whose work is unsatisfac
tory," and it has been a part of the
regulations since 1905, when all fac
ulty legislation was incorporated into
written form. The power, as the
wording implies, is exercisable at the
discretion of the committee. Former
ly, a large number of students were
subjected each semester to the effect
of the rule, but in recent years a
somewhat more len.'ent policy has
been pursued by the committee, in so
far as Ihe enforcement of this partic
ular rule is concerned. The increased
application of the strict probation rule
is merely a return to the more strin
gent scholarship regulation main
tained until a few years ago.
ft is as yet too early to determine
in what measure student activities
will be effected by the exclusion of
140 persons from participation in the
affairs of the Student Body. How
ever, it is known that several promi
nent athletes and journalists are
among those who have come within
the rulings of the Scholarship Com
mittee.
