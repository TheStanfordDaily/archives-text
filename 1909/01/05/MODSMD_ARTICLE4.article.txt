# HEMPL DISCOVERS KEY TO ETRUSCAN RUNES
## NEW LIGHT ON HISTORY PHILOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DISCOVERY IS GREAT. Head of German Department Reveals Secrets of Hitherto Undecipherable Characters of Ancient Race. 
### 
Professor George Hempl, head of
the Department of Germanic Lan
guages, has accomplished what has
baffled scientists the world over for
centuries. During the vacation Pro
fessor Hempl made public, before a
meeting of the Stanford Philological
Association, the fact that he had dis
covered the key to the Etruscan lan
guage, and, by so doing, has been able
to read the inscriptions to such an
extent as to completely overthrow the
generally accepted belief that the
Etruscans and Romans were a sep
arate people. Professor Hempl has
deciphered 50 inscriptions of the thou
sands recovered from the ruins of
habitations, and is now making a fur
ther study, with the intention of pub
lishing a complete book upon his dis
coveries.
The Etruscan history has long been
a deep mystery. The Etruscans were
mentioned by the Egyptians and by
the Grecians. It has been accepted
that they were a foreign element in
the Roman neighborhood. This the
ory is now overthrown by Professor
Hempl, whose investigations prove a
great similarity between the Roman
language and the Etruscan. This
makes possible only the conclusion
that the Etruscany and Romans
sprang from one race, which, follow
ing the legend, wandered to Italy from
Troy after the fall of that city. Thus,.
Virgil's "Aeneid" is substantiated by
scientific proof.
When Dr. Hempl made the first an
nouncement of his discovery, lie had
only translated about fifty inscrip
tions. There are some SOOO in all, an 3
their interpretation will involve years
of labor. At present he can formu
late sufficient ideas *o conceive con
siderable of the unknown people';'
customs and history
