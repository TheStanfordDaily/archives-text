# HEMPL DISCOVERS KEY TO ETRUSCAN RUNES
## NEW LIGHT ON HISTORY PHILOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DISCOVERY IS GREAT. Head of German Department Reveals Secrets of Hitherto Undecipherable Characters of Ancient Race. 
### 
Professor George Hempl, head of
the Department of Germanic Lan
guages, has accomplished what has
baffled scientists the world over for
centuries. During the vacation Pro
fessor Hempl made public, before a
meeting of the Stanford Philological
Association, the fact that he had dis
covered the key to the Etruscan lan
guage, and, by so doing, has been able
to read the inscriptions to such an
extent as to completely overthrow the
generally accepted belief that the
Etruscans and Romans were a sep
arate people. Professor Hempl has
deciphered 50 inscriptions of the thou
sands recovered from the ruins of
habitations, and is now making a fur
ther study, with the intention of pub
lishing a complete book upon his dis
coveries.
The Etruscan history has long been
a deep mystery. The Etruscans were
mentioned by the Egyptians and by
the Grecians. It has been accepted
that they were a foreign element in
the Roman neighborhood. This the
ory is now overthrown by Professor
Hempl, whose investigations prove a
great similarity between the Roman
language and the Etruscan. This
makes possible only the conclusion
that the Etruscany and Romans
sprang from one race, which, follow
ing the legend, wandered to Italy from
Troy after the fall of that city. Thus,.
Virgil's "Aeneid" is substantiated by
scientific proof.
When Dr. Hempl made the first an
nouncement of his discovery, lie had
only translated about fifty inscrip
tions. There are some SOOO in all, an 3
their interpretation will involve years
of labor. At present he can formu
late sufficient ideas *o conceive con
siderable of the unknown people';'
customs and history


PROFESOR GEORGE HEMPL
When interviewed yesterday, Pro
fessor Hempl had no further an
nouncement to make regarding his
transcriptions, except that he is pre
paring a report en the subject to be
published shortly bv 4ie University.
The Etruscans lived just north of
the Romans, and at a time were far
more powerful than the Romans, and
furnished them with kings, institu
tions and civilization. As with several
other races in this vicinity, the lan
guage died out, and the inscriptions
left by those peoples have up to the
present time remained uncipherable.
Professor Hempl has for years
worked on the ancient German runes,
which led to his discovering two mi
nor italic languages. This he re
ported to the Philological Association
of the Pacific Coast last fall. He was
then urged to try the unaccomplished
feat of solving the Etruscan language.
He obtained his first clue 011 Decem
ber 4, when he discovered the kin
ship between Etruscan and Roman.
Dr. Hempl is professor of Germanic
philology. He received his doctor's
degree at the University of Jena, af
ter graduating from Michigan. He
has been president of the American
Philological Association, the Ameri
can Dialect Society and the Modern
Language Association. At the St.
Louis Exposition Dr. Hempl held the
distinction of being chairman of the
department of history of language in
the Congress of Arts and Sciences.
Scientists all over the world have
taken notice of Dr. Hempl's discov
ery, and interest is evidenced in the
publishing of his next results. It is
then hoped considerable can be learn
ed regarding the customs of the an
cient people.
