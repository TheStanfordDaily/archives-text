A call has been issued by those in
charge of boating affairs, for men to
fill both Varsity and Freshmen shells.
Coach Murphy should be confronted
with the full array of available ma
terial in the University. There should
be no hanging back. Every man who
is capable of pulling an oar—whether
he has had experience or not —should
come out. Stanford must win the in
tercollegiate regatta; and to do it,
concerted and enthusiastic response is
necessary.
This year the need of the best pos
sible crews is more urgent than at
any other time. Boating enthusiasts
on the Coast have under considera
tion plans for activities on water
which overshadow anything at templ
ed in years past. In addition to our
opponents of the University of Cali
fornia, we shall probably meet the
oarsmen of the University of Wash
ington in the annual struggle on the
Sausalito course. Again, the North
ern rowers, through their coach, have
stated that a big regatta will be held
on Lake Washington between not only
the two California crews and the
Washington eight, but that the Uni
versity of Wisconsin will be repre
sented by a crack crew.
Stanford has been established in
other branches of intercollegiate ath
letics with a widely known reputation,
and, in the short time that boating
lias been followed, has made an excel
lent aquatic record. The question now
is whether we will put forth an effort
worthy of the occasion and make a
mark for ourselves when the oppor
tunities are best.
We think that such will be the case.
"Dan" Murphy is here to coach. He
has at his command several men who
have been under his direction in both
Varsity and class regattas, who will
assist him. He has not, however,
enough veterans to fill the boats; nor
is every old man assured of an oar
when a better is trying out. He
wants many who have never pulled
an oar or steered a boat. He wants
plenty of husky, able-bodied under
graduates, who are registered this
season for the first time, or who, in
other years, have not responded to
the call. In fact, he wants the big
gest turn-out on record. To win wa
must have it. Sign up!
