# Registration Light This Semester.
## 
### 
The registration up to ."i o'clock this
evening is somewhat lighter than that
of a year ago, due partly to the vac
cination requirements and partly to
the fact that 110 entrance examina
tions were held. At present, 1227 have
registered, while at this time last year
the total had reached 1334. Out of
the total registration, 441 are women
students.
The new applicants who registered
numbered 26, as compared with 39 in
January, 190 S. The old students re
turning, who have registered and
have been out for a semester or more,
come to 53 at the present writing,
shows GO to be the number at the
while a comparison with last year
same time.
