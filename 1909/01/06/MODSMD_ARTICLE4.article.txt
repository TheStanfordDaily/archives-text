# Drain Pipes and Bulkhead Installed.
## 
### 
Preparatory to the filling of Lake
Lagunita for this semester, a new
drain and overflow pipe has been in
stalled and a new cement bulkhead
built. The old drain pipe was en
tirely enclosed in cement, so that,
when in the course of time it rusts
away, a good and permanent cement
pipe will be left to do its work.
