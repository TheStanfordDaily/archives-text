## 
### 
The Stanford float in the Tourna
ment of Roses, held at Pasadena on
New Year's Day, captured the first
prize among floats or its class in the
great annual flower pageant. The en
try which represented Stanford was
a touring car, so banked with flowers
that the body of the machine was en
tirely hidden from view. The color
scheme of red and white was well
worked out. By the use of red ge
raniums, a solid red background was
made for a white "S" that stood out
well against- its brilliant background.
The five men who rode in the car
were dressed in white and wore root
er's hats. At intervals they gave Stan
ford yells that were received with a
great deal of applause from the crowd
that lined the route.
