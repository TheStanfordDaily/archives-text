# TO PLAY AUSTRALIANS
## GAME WITH "WALLABIES" IS NOW PRACTICALLY ASSURED. Manager Stewart Makes Trip to San Francisco to Complete Negotiations with Experts. 
### 
Present indications point to a post
season series ot' Rugby games during
the latter part of this month, and the
first part of February, in which the
famous Australian Rugby fifteen,
known as the "Wallabies," will con
test with the leading Rugby teams of
this State. Manager Stewart is in San
Francisco today, with the purpose of
completing arrangements for a match
with the Australians. If suitable
terms can be secured from William
Unmack, the California representative
of the antipodeans, he will set an
early date. No special schedule of
games has been made by Unmack as
yet, but unless February 6 is found
to be inconvenient to the crack foot
ballers from across the seas, they
will be seen in action on that date on
Stanford Field.
Should the "Wallabies" agree to
participate in the proposed series,
three games will be played in this vi
cinity. These will consist of a match
with teams representing Stanford, the
University of California and a mixed
aggregation made up of the best play
ers on the Barbarian and Olympic
Club fifteens. Douglas Erskine, act
ing for the last-mentioned clubs, and
Graduate Manager Merritt of Califor
nia have already signified their will
ingness to comply with the terms of
the Australians, and the second in
ternational Rugby series to be played
within the college year now seems as
sured.
The "Wallabies" team is one of the
finest Rugby machines in the world,
it being composed entirely of "stars,"
each of whom is an expert in his re
spective position. It is a professional
organization.
A satisfactory agreement will give
local followers of Rugby an excellent
opportunity to judge the relative mer
its of Rugby as played abroad and at
home.
Numerous matches have been play
ed by the "Wallabies" with the fore
most teams of the British Isles. Suc
cess has attended the team in its tour
of the world.
While the local players do not ex
pect to win from the experts, they
are anxious to learn just what first
class Rugby means. The Vancouver
critics were of the opinion, should a
match be arranged between Stanford
and the "Wallabies," the Australians
would have a far more difficult task
of winning than they anticipate. Stan
ford will have a strong team. While
some of the men who played against
the University of California are not
in college, a sufficiently large number
of former players are registered to
take their places.
