# TWO MAKE ADDRESSES,
## SPEAKERS TELL EXPERIENCES AT FIRST ASSEMBLY. Visitors Talk on Work in the Slums and Advance Plea for Needed Prison Reforms. 
### 
The first regular assembly of the
semester was held this morning in
the Assembly Hall at 11:15, and the
program as arranged by the Commit
tee on Public Exercises consisted of
an address by E. C. Mercer and one
by G. J. Griffith of Los Angeles.
Mercer, in his introductory talk,
gave some of his experiences while a
frequenter of the slums of the big
cities in the East, dealing particular
ly with the tremendous influence that
the element of liquor has in the deg
radation of the men who eventually
come to such a level. The speaker
offered his own case as an illustra
tion of the fact that it is not always
the unnoticed, habitual drunkard that
finally seeks the refuge of the mis
sions that are scattered through the
slums, but that ther» are many col
lege graduates and men who have
even gone into the world to preach
the gospel that need this proffered aid
and seek it.
"One man out of every three that
come to these resci e stations is a
graduate from some college," said
Mercer. "This vice <)f drinking does
not come upon the individual sud
denly, but is a gradual growth, and
one does not realize his position un
til he is finally in the clutches of
drink. Some of these unfortunates
come to the missions without enough
clothes upon their to flag a
freight, train, and I sffer myself as
one of those who have been through
the circuit, and one who can speak
with the authority of experience.
"Needed Prison Reforms" was the
subject, chosen by G. J. Griffith, who
was the next speaker. In tracing the
treatment of prisoners by the various
nations from the time of the ancient
Babylonian captors, l.e arrived at th°
conclusion that the pn sent system ol
treatment, as practiced, was not ad
vanced indue proportion to the pr'tg
ress in civilization. "The present-day
penal institutions are primarily for
the purpose of punishment, not to re
form the culprits sentenced to terms
within their walls," he said.
"Every man has a heart in him and
can be influenced by the environment
in which he is placed. This should
be toward a complete moral reform
of the criminal, not to harden
the subject by punishment," remark
ed Griffith. Instances of cruelty and
vigorous action by the chief warden
and his staff of guards at San Quen
tin penitentiary were cited by him as
cases where the State sanctioned this
theory of punishing criminals for the
sake of the discipline itself.
"Prisoners are at times broken in
health and spirit by their sojourn in
one of our modern penal institutions,"
continued Griffith. "The released con
vict, who is withou 4 influence or
friends, is practically unable to
again obtain a firm foothold in a com
munity. The police continually dog
his actions wherever he may be, while
the number of yearM served in the
cells generally breaks his health, so
that he is unable to compete success
fully with the workers in his line of
work."

Griffith stated that efforts are be
ing made to secure legislation to
modify and alleviate some of the con
ditions now prevalent in our own
State prison at San Quentin, and that,
although some progress has been
made toward this goal, there is still
room for wide improvement.
