Stanford University lacks what
every institution and club of size
should possess. We nave no Trophy
Room. The fact is brought to our at
tention forceably by the arrival of
the Cooper-Keith cup. After thin
prize has been exhibited in the Book
store window or some more or less
public place, it is safe to say it will
be kept where few undergraduates or
interested individuals will see it until
another series of games brings it to
our notice. No blame is to be at
tached to those who have charge of
the valuable cup, but discredit never
theless reflects upon existing condi
tions.
It is a problem which deserves care
ful consideration and action in the
immediate future. This lack of a Tro
phy Room has been decried before
and the question then allowed to
lapse. It is time those who have con
trol of the affairs of the Student Body
should see that some result is accom
plished. The location and mainte
nance of rooms of this nature in oth
er universities can be studied to ad
vantage. Permission from the Uni
versity authorities and a small ex
penditure by the Student Body will
undoubtedly be found all that is nec
essary to obtain a good Trophy Room.
