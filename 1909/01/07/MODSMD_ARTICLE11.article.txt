Dr. Jordan has communicated to
The Daily Palo Alto the following res
olutions of the Senate of Michigan
University. The Michigan Senate cor
responds to the local Academic Coun
cil. The resolutions are:
"Resolved, That, im the judgment, of
the Senate, the growing practice on
the part of the students in the Uni
versity of meeting in rooms or halls
attached to or connected with saloons
or drinking places is for obvious rea
sons to lie condemned, and that stu
dents who organize or participate in
such meetings shall become subject
to disciplinary action. Furthermore,
that any students who organize or
take part in what are called the keg
parties,' no matter where they may
be held, should also ue liable to dis
cipline by the faculties in whose de
partments they are enrolled.
"Resolved, That the annual flag and
pole rush and the attendant hazing

between the first and second-year stu
dents are a disgrace to the Univer
sity, and that they are hereby pro
hibited; and that, if any trial of
strength and skill between such stu
dents is thought to be desirable, it
shall be held in the daytime and un
der such regulations as shall elim
inate the objectionable preliminaries
and accessories as well as the hazard
and roughness of the previous con
tests."
