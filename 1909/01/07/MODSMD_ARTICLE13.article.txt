Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: Today's assembly recalls
a question to which we Stanford men
may well give a moment of generous
attention. It is this:
Is not our relation to the speakers
at assembly that of the host toward
his guest? And, if so, are we not all
interested in showing to our guests
every possible personal courtesy? I
hardly think we meet the test, when
many of us leave the hall before a
speaker has finished his address. Of
course, some have imperative reasons
for leaving early, but those so cir
cumstanced, presumably, are the ones
who find places near a door and are
careful to go out quietly. 1 fear
there is reason to suspect, on the
other hand, that when a half-dozen
together tramp out noisily in single
file, there is no important duty await
ing them outside. And I leave it to
the general sense of candor whether
a prevailing atmosphere of shifting
and whispering indicates the degree
of courtesy we wish to pay to the
speakers who are our guests, or to
those in the audience who wish to
listen
One other point: Has it. ever been
explained why every stray dog in the
neighborhood takes bis turn in at
tending an assembly, either by invi
tation or by permission, and then in
variably finds his way on the stage?
The inexhaustible variety of dogs is
in itself surprising, but the unvarying
regularity of their appearance sug
gests a psychological problem that is
puzzling indeed. I *lo not write this
in the expectation that we can ever
get through an assembly without a
dog, but simply a* a disinterested
seeker after knowledge.
