# NEW BOOK ON BURBANK'S WORK.
## President Jordan and Professor Kellogg Write of the Plant Wizard's Labors. 
### 
President David Starr Jordan and
Prof. Vernon L. Kellogg of the De
partment of Entomology have written
a book on the work accomplished by
Luther Burbank, the eminent horticul
turist of Santa Ror-i. The title of
the work is "The Scientific Aspect of
Luther Burbank's Work."
Dr. Jordan writes Â«>n "Some Exper
iments of Luther Hurbank." He shows
more clearly than any one yet how
much of Mr. Burbank's success has
depended on his great patience, skill
and powers of observation. It is this
great patience that to newspaper and
magazine writers has remained un
seen. Dr. Jordan lias then shown by
specific examples ln-w different plants
and flowers have been developed, the
most noteworthy being the Shasta
daisy among the flowers and the
spineless cactus amcng plants.
Professor Kellogg covers "Scientific
Aspects of Luther Burbank's Work."
He says that although Burbank has
"no new fundamental laws to reveal,"
be has "the right to formulate some
valuable conclusions touching certain
already recognized evolution factors,
in particular the influence on varia
bility of hybridization and modifica
tion of environment." Mr. Kellogg
believes that Burbank's great service
lies in the recognition and selection
of desirable material, which he is able
to do because of his quick percep
tion. Professor Kellogg tells very in
terestingly of Mr. Burbank's keen
senses, and then describes the meth
ods used in creating the new plants
and fruits.
