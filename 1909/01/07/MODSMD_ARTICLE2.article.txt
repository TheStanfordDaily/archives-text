# ADMITTED TO UNION
## ENGLISH RUGBY ORGANIZATION MAKES STANFORD A MEMBER. Recent Application of Executive Committee Favorably Considered. Advantages to Result, 
### 
Graduate Manager Stewart is in re
ceipt of a communication from the
secretary of the London Rugby Un
ion, conveying the information that
Stanford has been admitted to full
membership in that body. Formal ap
plication for membership in the Union
was transmitted to England by the
Executive Committee of the Student
Body some months ago, and this is
the first intimation of favorable ac
tion thereon that has been received.
It is mainly through the efforts of
"Reggie" Woodward, the well-known
Vancouver Rugby enthusiast, that
Stanford was assured of a place in the
central governing body of internation
al Rugby. Woodward, as the repre
sentative of the Union in Western
Amerca, has been in a position to as
sist materially in facilitating the en
trance of Stanford to its membership.
The advantages accruing from hold
ing a card in the English athletic
body are many. Especially will the
University be drawn into closer rela
tions with the Rugby clubs that each
year send championship teams to
compete with the leading fifteens of
other sections of the globe. Instead
of arranging matches with such teams
indirectly through Vancouver, as has
been necessary in the past, the Rug
by Union, which has charge of the
schedules of its world-touring mem
bers, will make the Cardinal a regu
lar opponent of all fifteens coming
out this way. This insures matches
with some of the best Rugby aggre
gations in existence.
Manager Stewart was unable to
conclude arrangements with the man
ager of the "Wallabies" yesterday.
Pending the receipt of news of the
present whereabouts of that team, no
definite contract can be entered into.
Their local representative is desirous
of securing their assent to the plans
that have been made for their stay in
this vicinity. Final word regarding
their wishes should be received here
within a week.
