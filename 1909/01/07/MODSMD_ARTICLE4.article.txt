# CUP IS ON EXHIBITION
## COOPER-KEITH TROPHY IS HAND. SOME PRIZE. Gift of Noted Rugby Enthusiast Will Be Property of Stanford This Year. 
### 
The Cooper-Keith trophy cup, which
the Varsity won by shutting out Van
couver in the serifs just completed
in the North, is one of the most ex
pensive and handsome prizes ever
contested for on this Coast. The cup

was presented by J. Cooper-Keith of
Vancouver, a wealthy Rugby enthusi
ast and follower of amateur sports.
The trophy was especially made for
the donor by the fair cms silversmiths
of China, and has been offered for
competition during *he past seasons
of Rugby.
In presenting the cup, it was stipu
lated that the trophy should be a pev
petual one, and should be an inter
national challenge prize. Cooper-
Keith further provided that the cup
should be contested for on the
grounds of the defenders, and drew
up a set of rules and regulations. This
ruling has been altered at the sug
gestion of Manager .1. E. Stewart,
who pointed out to the trustees m
Vancouver that a game here after the
varsity match with the University of
California would not prove a drawing
card. The rules T ?ere changed to
read to the effect that the cup shall
be contested upon grounds to be
agreed upon by the challengers and
defenders. This wili probably mean
a regular Vancouver trip as long as
Stanford qualifies to defend or chal
lenge for the trophy.
The cup will he kept on exhibition
at the Bookstore for several d
and will then be given into the charge
of a local trustee, to be appointed.
