# E.C. Mercer Talks to Encina Men.
## 
### 
E. C. Mercer, who lectures in the
Chapel tonight, gave a very interest
ing and entertaining talk last night to
the members of Encina Club at an
informal gathering in the clubroom,
after being introduced by W. P.
Hemphill, '09, president of the club.
He spoke along the lines of the

address which he delivers tonight,
giving a very clear and vivid story
of his college days and just how it
happened that he was forced to live
on the Bowery of New York City. His
speech was well received and appre
ciated by those present, and in token
of this he desired to be personally
introduced to the members of the
club, all of whom he met with a
hearty handshake.
