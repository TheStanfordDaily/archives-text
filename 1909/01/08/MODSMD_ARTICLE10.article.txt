### 
The Stanford Commission of Engi
neers, composed of Prof. C. D. Marx,
head of the Department of Civil En
gineering; Prof. W. F. Durand, head
of the Department of Mechanical En
gineering, and C. B. Wing, professor
of Structural Engineering, by its final
report to the Board of Trustees, at a
recent meeting, officially completed its
share in the work of reconstruction
What yet remains to be done along
this line will be given Into the hands
of private contractors, who will work
under the direction of Superintendent
of Construction A. J. Bain. The Me
morial Church will be rebuilt in this
manner.
The Commission of Engineers
which has completed its labors was
appointed the latter part of June.
1906, to superintend the reconstruc
tion of the buildings and arcades
which were wrecked at the time of
the earthquake. It has confined itself
to this work almost entirely, putting
back into good condition all those
buildings which were absolutely nec
essary in carrying on the work of the
University. •
The first duty of the Commission
was to prepare those buildings which
were most needed for the reopening
of the University the following Au
gust. The rooms which were found
unsafe were closed, while the lesser
damaged ones were rebuilt, painted
and calcimined, so that enough were
ready when the semester opened. Dur
ing the summer, Encina and Roble
halls were made safe, and both, with
the exception of the rooms in the rear
of the east wing of Encina, were oc
cupied the following semester. While
this work was going on, the arcades
on the east and west sides of the
quadrangle were repaired and the
tower of the church was taken down
and the interior protected with a tem
porary roof.
The demolition of Memorial Arch
took much care. High scaffolds were
erected on which was placed a der
rick, and the arch was taken down,
stone by stone. At the same time
the new gymnasium and Library were
razed.
The Chemistry building was next
repaired. Here a large portion of the
frontal walls had to be rebuilt. The
interior walls of the four large corner
buildings of ihe outer quadrangle—
the History, Physics, Geo'cgy and En
gineering bui'.d'ngs—also had to be
reconstructed practically from the
ground. A great deal of repair work
was done on the inner quadrangle
buildings, and the entire group had to
be recalcimined and revarnished.
The machine and pattern shops and
engine rooms were rebuilt and a new
for-re building constructed, the walls
being built from bricks taken from
the other buildings. The engineering
building nearest the Bookstore wa.?
ieduced in lonpth, so as to be in line
w'th the buildings; on the quadrangle.
