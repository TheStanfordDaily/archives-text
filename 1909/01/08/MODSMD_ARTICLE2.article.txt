# MANY HEAR MERCER
## SPEAKER IS GIVEN OVATION IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Urges Value of Practical Christianity and Tells of "College Grads on the Bowery." 
### 
The Chapel proved too small to hold
the large audience which desired to
hear E. C. Mercer last night, and the
meeting was held in Assembly Hall,
the lower floor of which was crowded.
The visitor was greeted with hearty
applause upon being introduced by VV.
C. Shelton, president of the Young
Men's Christian Association.
He chose as his subject, "College
Grads on the Bowery." As Mercer
has lived just the life of many of the
men he told about, his speech was
convincing. He spoke of the good the
rescue missions of the slums had ac
complished for him, and urged the
value of practical Christianity. He
showed the photog.-aphs of a large
number of college men who had held
high positions in social and financial
circles, but who had fallen because of
evil habits acquired while in college.
He outlined the downfall and rescue
of the individuals, and by his intimate
association with his subject lent so
much color to the talk that he held
the attention of the crowd to the last
word he had to say.
"It is peculiar," he said, "how many
college men there are on the Bowery.
There are college men of all types.
One night, in a blinding snowstorm I
counted fifty-nine college men in the
bread line, waiting for their allotment
of bread and tea."
He told his story in a straightfor
ward, modest, convincing manner. His
message was not a mere denunciation
of social drinking and other vices
and an appeal for their suppression,
but a tribute to the power of Chris
tianity.
Men have been visiting Mercer daily
in his headquarters, guest room 6, En
cina, talking over various subjects. He
is also visiting the different fraternity
houses.
Sunday evening, in the Assembly
Hall, at 7:30, Mercer will talk on "The
Story of My Life," which promises to
be interesting.
