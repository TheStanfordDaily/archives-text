## 
### 
The water was turned into Lake La
gunita this morning, and since then a
steady stream has been flowing and is
rapidly filling the lake-bottom.
Coach Murphy expects to have the
boats out on the water within the next
ten days, and then the men will be
given every opportunity to practice
with the shell and barge.
Some of the men have been doing
light road work and cross-country
running in order to reduce all their
superfluous flesh and get into condi
tion.
The heavy rains of the past few days
insure a plentiful supply of water.
