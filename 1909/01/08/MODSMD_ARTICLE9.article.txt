# Registration Still Light.
## 
### 
The vaccination requirements,
which have barred about seventy-five
applicants from registering, have
caused the total registration at this
time to fall off considerably, when
compared with that of last year at this
time. The men who have registered
number 836, while there are 447 wo
men, making a total of 1253. At this
time last January, 1426 had registered.
This discrepancy will be made up
largely by the registration of those

who are now only allowed to attend
classes, pending the outcome of their
vaccination requirements.
