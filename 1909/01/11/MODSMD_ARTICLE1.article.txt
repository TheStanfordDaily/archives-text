# PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT
## KEEN RIVALRY FOR POSITIONS ON CARNOT TRIO. Preliminary Contest Will Be Conducted Under Regulations of the Actual Debate. 
### 
The tryout for the Carnot team,
which will be held in the University
Chapel on Friday evening, January 22,
promises to be one of the most keen
ly contested struggles for a position
on an intercollegiate debating team
that has ever taken place in the his
tory of Stanford forensics. Never be
fore has interest in debating been so
general and so intense as at present.
This gratifying condition of affairs
can be traced, no doubt, to Stanford's
triumph over California in both the
Carnot and intercollegiate debates last
year, as well as to the unusually flour
ishing condition of the local literary
societies.
All of the men who have signified
their intention of trying for a place
on the Carnot team have not as yet
handed their names to the Interso
ciety committee, and, in order to fa
cilitate the arrangements for the try
out, it is urged that all contestants
leave their names wi'.h some member
of the committee at once. Probably
three veteran interco.legiate debaters
will compete for the honor of repre
senting the Cardinal against the Cali
fornians in the effort to bring the Car
not medal to Stanford for the third
consecutive time. A number of other
prominent local speakers have been
studying the general topic, "France:
Her Colonies and Dependencies,"
since it was announced some weeks
ago.
The selection of this year's trio and
alternate will be made in the usual
manner. Only one preliminary tryout
will be held, unless the number of
candidates exceeds that of past years.
Should the latter prove to be the case,
an elimination debate would be held a
few nights prior to the final tryout.
The possibility of such a necessity,
however, seems to be unlikely.
In the years that have elapsed since
the first Carnot was held, a definite
body of regulations for the conduct
of the annual contest has been evolved
and the tryout, following the regular
custom, will be governed by these
rules. Twenty minutes will be al
lowed each competitor in which to
present his argument. The partici
pants may divide this rime as they see
fit, providing that they speak at least
twice and that each speech requires a
minimum of four minutes for de
livery.
The specific question for the dis
cussion is to be chosen from the gen
eral subject by a committee of three
faculty members, two hours previous
to the time appointed for the opening
of the tryout. President G. B. Bush
of the Intersociety Debating League
will announce the personnel of this
committee as soon as he can secure
the services of the requisite number
of faculty members. Immediately up
on the reading of the particular topic
of the debate, the several contestants
will be permitted to choose the side
which they may desire to uphold in
the tryout. The actual Carnot dispu
tation will take place in Assembly
Hall, about two weeks after the try
out for the team has been held.
