E. C. Mercer, who is visiting the
large universities of the country and
warning undergraduates of prevalent
college evils, has been accorded a re
ception by the men cf the University
during his stay such as has seldon
been witnessed before. The enthusiastic
response to a moral appeal is not only
a tribute to the drawing powers of
the speaker, but priraa facie evidence
that conditions at Stanford University
are not of the type which misinformed
publications have described.
The audience which tilled the Chap
el to overflowing then occupied
all the available seating capacity upon
the main floor of Assembly Hall has
demonstrated beyond a doubt that
Stanford men are in sympathy with
such thoughts as advanced by the vis
itor. Members of thif community will
listen fo strong speakers who have a
right to the confidence of their audi
ence, and much good can be accom
plished if an effort is made to bring
men of this type before the Student
Body.
