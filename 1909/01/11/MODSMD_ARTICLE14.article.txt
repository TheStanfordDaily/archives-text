# FINANCES OF VANCOUVER TRIP.
## Statement of the Expenses Incurred by the Stanford Rugby Team During Xmas Trip. 
### 
Manager Stewart gave out a state
ment today of the expenses incurred
by the Stanford Rughy team on their
Vancouver trip. Th« Vancouver men
guaranteed $1900 for the trip. Ac
cording to the report, there is a defi
cit of $197.05, which will lie paid by
the Student Body. This deficit could
hardly be avoided on account of the
higher living expenses and a few in
cidentals that were not figured on.
Manager Stewart believes the expense
is offset by the valuable experience
and playing that the men received.
