# MERCER MAKES LAST ADDRESS.
## "The Story of My Life" Is Subject of Strong Talk by Noted Easterner. 
### 
Assembly Hall was again filled last
night to hear Mercer's concluding ad
dress. The meeting was opened by
a vocal solo by P. F. Pettigrew, '09.
which was well received. Dr. Jordan
then made a brief address, introduc
ing the speaker of the evening, in
which he paid a high tribute to the
work that is being done by Mercer.
The applause which greeted Mer
cer's appearance was nil able criterion
of the interest which he has aroused
in his work among flie undergradu
ates. His subject for last night was
the "Story of My Life," which he told
in a straightforward manner, conceal
ing nothing of his life. He used events
of his past life to illustrate the evils
of social drink and what it would
eventually lead to. He closed his ad
dress by thanking the Stanford stu
dents for their hospitality, and said
that he was leaving here with the im
pression that Stanford has a higher
moral standard than the majority of
colleges. One thing, however, in
which the eastern colleges are far
ahead of the western institutions is
in lack of Christian reverence, and
lie urged Ihe men to equal the east
erners along this line.
Mercer left this afternoon for other
colleges along the Coast, where he
will deliver similar lectures before
returning to New York.
