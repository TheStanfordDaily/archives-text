# REV. BROOKMAN PREACHES
## Addresses Large Audience on the Subject of Prayer.â€”Good Music. 
### 
The regular Sunday service in the
Chapel was conducted by the Reverend
D. M. Brookman of St. Mark's Church,
Berkeley, who talked on the subject
of Prayer. Rev. Brookman took for
his text the passage telling of the
Transfiguration and on that passage
he based his sermon.
He told of the wonderful things that
can be accomplished through prayer.
The fact that Christ always had com
passion on those who were sick anil
in pain was emphasized.
Reverend Brookman continued: "If
we were to reconstruct the world, we
would rule out pain. At the same time
we would rule out pleasure, because
they are inseparable. For it would be
impossible to have pleasure if we did
not have pain. We would rule out
sin, and at the same time we would
be ruling out salvation. But who
would wish to live in a world where
death, pain and sin have all been
eliminated? We should flee from that
as from a hell! Where would be the
beauty of self-sacrifice? There would
be no glory in bringing comfort to
those who are weary and heavy-laden.
We should not be in pain, but at the
same time we should not be in pleas
ure. We should not be in sin, but
we should never be saved. We should
not die, for we would never have
lived. It is better to suffer pain
than never to reap a harvest of joy.
Tt is better to sin than never to be
saved. It takes faith in the fatherly
wisdom of God to say .that. Yes, in
deed it does. There are many good
men and women who have never be
lieved in God, but on the other hand
there are millions and millions who do"
In conclusion, the speaker related
a little story of a father calling to
his child to jump down into his arms
when the child couldn't see the father
because of the darkness. "Jump! It
will be all right. I will catch you."
So it is that we look into the black
ness of human life. I hear a voice
that says, "Jump and you will be
caught.' Are you listening for that
voice? If you listen you can hear it."
