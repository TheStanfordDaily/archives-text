# MINSTREL SHOW SOON
## MUSICAL CLUBS TO STAGE BLACKFACE AFFAIR. Club in Fine Condition.â€”Program Already Partially Prepared for the Event. 
### 
The minstrel show of the Combined
Musical Clubs is scheduled to take
place early in February. It will pre
cede the Sophomore comedy, which
will be presented some time after the
middle of the month. While the two
entertainments will occur within a few
weeks of each other the minstrel
show should not in any way affect the
attendance at "7-20-8," for the reason
that the two are of an entirely differ
ent character.
The members of the Glee and Man
dolin Clubs have begun work in earn
est to make a success of their produc
tion. The clubs have a number of se
lections which they prepared in antic
ipation of a trip during the Christ
mas holidays. This list includes many
numbers that have been produced
through the courtesy of the Cornell
Glee Club, and include several which
the Cornell club used during their
successful tour last season.
Besides this program, new music
has recently been secured from east
ern publishers. While the Glee Club
has not appeared on the Assembly
Hall stage this season, it has been
practicing hard, under the direction
of Professor Roberts. Several old men
whose voices have made hits with col
lege audiences in the past, have reg
istered in the University this semes
ter and have consented to sing with
the club.
The Mandolin Club also has been
unusually successful in their fall
work. This organization had also pre
pared a program for a trip, so they
have a good start toward as com
plete a program as has been put on
here recently.
The details of the show have not
been announced, but the end-men will
be chosen in a few days by those who
have the affair in charge. The exact
date of the show will be announced
later.
