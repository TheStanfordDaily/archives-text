# Junior Class to Meet Thursday.
## 
### 
President H. C. Warren has called
a meeting of the Junior class for next
Thursday afternoon. The purpose of
the meeting is to nominate officers for
the present semester as well as to
dispose of some important class busi
ness.
There is now a vacancy on the Quad
Directors' Board and that will prob
ably be filled on Thursday. The fail
ure of F. A. Adams, editor-in-chief
of the Quad, to register in the Univer
sity this semester will necessitate the
appointment of a successor. The man
ner in which this is to be done will
be decided on Thursday. That the
selection of Adams' successor will be
left to the editorial board of the An
nual seems likely, because of the ne
cessity of immediately beginning the
work of compiling the book. An elec
tion at this time would result in con
siderable delay in the active work of
preparing the Quad for publication.
