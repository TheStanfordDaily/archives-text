# DR. JORDAN TO REPORT
## PRESIDENT ACTIVE IN MAKING NEW FISHERY LAWS. Several Conferences Have Been Arranged with Canadian Commissioner Before Final Action. 
### 
Since his appointment as United
States Fish Commissioner, Dr. Jordan
has been active in formulating laws
which shall govern fisheries in waters
bounding both Canada and this coun
try.
According to an agreement entered
into by the United States and Great
Britain on April 11, 1908, it was de
cided that each country should ap
point one commissioner of fisheries,
and that these two commissioners
should devise regulations and rulings
pertinent to and governing certain
specified waters between the United
States and Canada. The conference
held last spring was instigated chief
ly by President Roosevelt and is in
direct line with his policy of the pres
ervation of natural resources. The
object of appointing the commission
ers is that there may be a unifica
tion of statutes on buth sides of the
boundary line governing the fish in
dustry of the waters contiguous to
both countries, and that the represen
tatives may make laws sufficiently
stringent to prevent any extermina
tion of the fish found within the vari
ous waters.
Dr. Jordan was appointed a com
missioner from the United States July
1, 190£, and immed'utely went East.
En route he traversed the entire
length of the international boundary.
After this trip, Dr. Jordan returned
to the Pacific Coast, but went East
again in November to attend a meet
ing called by the State Department
for the purpose of furthering the
plans of the new undertaking. At this
gathering there were present, all the
State commissioners from the States
which will be affected by the intend
ed regulations, and daring this meet
ing Dr. Jordan discussed the stat
utes of the various States with their
respective representatives. Directly
following this meeting he went to
New York, where he had a brief in
terview with the Dominion Commis
sioner, Prof. E. E. Prince, but noth
ing definite was decided at this time.
However, a number of meetings have
been arranged between the two rep
resentatives previous to the final re
port, which is due June 3, 1909. This
report will be sent to President Taft,
who will submit it to be read before
Congress. This body may either rat
ify or annul the report, but has no
power to amend it. When the report
has once passed, thti laws embodied
in it become the supreme law of the
land and take precedence over any
conflicting State statutes concerning
fisheries.
