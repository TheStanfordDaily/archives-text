### 
Active training for all the men out
for Varsity and Freshman crews
started this afternoor, and from now
on candidates will report daily to Dan
Murphy.
The lake has been filling up rather
slowly, but Coach Murphy expects lo
have the men out in the boats by
Thursday.
The first day's training consisted of
calisthenics and setting-up exercises,
to get the men accrstomed to the
moving of the hands and body. Fol
lowing this, they wsre taken for a
short run. The rowing machines have
not been taken from the gymnasium
as yet, but they will In all probability
be installed in the boathouse within
the next few days.
Up to the present time forty-seven
men hve signed the roll, which does
not include the whole list, as a few
men have signified their intention of
coming out who have not signed. Out
of the al ove number, twenty-four are
Freshmen, and prosrects for a good
1912 eight are bright.
Coach Murphy said in part this al
ternoon: "We will have the boats in
the water by Thursday. I am having
the four-oared shell brought up from
Redwood and everything will be ready
for work on the water by the middle
of this week. The prospects for a
crew are very good, and I am very
much encouraged with the number and
the ability of the fellows out."
