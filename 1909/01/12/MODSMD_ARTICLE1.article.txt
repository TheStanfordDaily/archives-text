# CALLS OUT TRACK MEN
## ACTIVE TRAINING WILL BEGIN TOMORROW AFTERNOON. "Dad" Moulton Urges New Men to Start Light Work at Once. Rally Next Week. 
### 
Trainer Moulton has issued a call
for all track men to begin active train
ing at once, and asks that every man
who intends to do track work this
semester come out tomorrow and do
regular and systematic training from
the beginning of the season. This
call is made especially emphatic to
new men, as it is "Dad's" desire to
get acquainted with the new men ami
size up the material available in the
Freshman class and among the can
didates who have done no previous
track work.
The regular track rally at which
the candidates for positions on the
varsity and Freshman teams will for
mally sign up for the season's work
will not be held until some time in
the coming week, owing to the fact
that Track Captain H. L. Horton, '08,
will not return to the University until
January 15. Strict training rules will
not go into effect until after the rally,
but every one who expects to sign
up is urged to do light work on the
track in the interim, beginning to
morrow. For the benefit of those who
have not previously trained under
"Dad," the Stanford trainer will be
at the training house every afternoon
during the coming week from 3 until
5 while those who are forced to do
Iheir training in the morning may con
sult him at the old track after 10.
Trainer Moulton is very strong in
his appeal to Freshmen and men who
have done no previous track work at
the University to come out this sea
son and help to furnish material from
which to build up teams for the in
tercollegiate contests. There is an
urgent need of every available man to
fill the many vacancies and strength
en the track squad, and "Dad" is be
ginning early in order to make the
most of the opportunities for develop
ing this new material.
The anticipated Rugby match with
the Wallabies team will delay the ac
tive track training of several of the
members of last year's varsity track
team, who are now playing on the
Rugby fifteen. But as the Rugby train
ing will keep the men in condition
fully as well as the ureliminary track
work would do, "Dad" will not ask
these athletes to begin their training
on the cinder path until after the post
season Rugby match.
