A game has been arranged with the
crack Rugby team known as the "Wal
labies," and it is practically assured
that a tour of Australia and New Zea
land will be made ibis summer if tin;
varsity players decide favorably. In
ternational matches of the nature
planned are to be encouraged. Stan
ford has already derived a great
amount of benefit from the games with
Vancouver. The players have learned
many points of the game, and the Uni
versity, by reason of the international
character of the contests, has been
brought before the attention of the
outside public. In this respect, a re
cent editorial which appeared in the
New York Sun is worthy of notice. It
reads:
"While the exponents of the 'color
line" rage and the admirers of the
Boilermaker imagine a vain thing, the
manly art is not the only sport with
present claims to attention. Coinci
dently we learn that the Rugby foot
ball team of Leland Stanford Univer
sity has won the international cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast, defeat
ing a Vancouver "fifteen," and that
teams from England and Australia are
planning to visit us.
The football scrimmage of two or
three years ago that produced the re
formed or open game, the game of for
ward pass and onside kick, resulted
in the West in the substitution of Rug
by for its hardy descendant, American
football, llemarkablo progress must
have been made to enable the West
ern novices to defeat the veteran
players of Canada. It, will be inter
esting to see what they can do against
other British teams.
Rugby has not found favor in the
East, possibly because it is practi
cally unknown here; yet even the
most ardent followers of the American
game may pick up many points by
watching the work of a good Rugby
team. Our open field work may be
vastly improved, the passing made far

more common, and yet the dreaded ap
proximation to basketball kept within
reasonable bounds. We have tried
'soccer' and found it a splendid aux
iliary sport; "rugger," when we get
to know it better, may prove to have
something for us, too.
"A hearty welcome to the Pilgrims
and to the Antipodeans. We are ready
to let them 'show ur.' "
