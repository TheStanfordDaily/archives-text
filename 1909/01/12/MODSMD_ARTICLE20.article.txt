# INSTALLS NEW APPARATUS.
## Mechanical Engineering Department Adds Automobile Engine to Equipment. 
### 
Among the recent items of equip
ment in tlie mechanical laboratory, a
gas engine of the automobile type hao
been installed.
This engine is of the double-opposed
type, and will be mounted with clutch
mid speed variation gears, the same
as in an actual automobile. A form of
absorption brake for measuring power
will also be attached, thus making
possible a study of the operation of
this engine under a wide variety ot
conditions. It is exuected that this
engine, with its mounting and attach
ments, will be ready for laboratory use
in the near future.
In view of the importance to Cal
ifornia of cheap industrial power, the
investigation of the so-called internal
combustion engine has become impor
tant. It lias long been the purpose
of the Department of Mechanical En
ginering to add to itu equipment rep
resentative forms of engines of tlii ->
general type, and the engine abo"e
noted is intended to represent one of
the common forms met with in auto
mobile design.
