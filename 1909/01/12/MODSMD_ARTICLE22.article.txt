# ARE RETURNING SLOWLY.
## Majority of Students Out on Account of Vaccination Have Not Yet Registered. 
### 
But few of the seventy-five students
who were not allowed to register be
cause of vaccination have enrolled in
tlie University. They are compelled
to wait until their vaccination takes
before the Committee on Public Health
will allow registration. Another week
will probably elapse before the ma
jority of those who are effected will
be allowed to attend classes.
Some of those who have applied
for admission have found that they
were compelled to pay an additional
fee for registering J ate. Old students
who were not in residence at the Uni
versity last semester or new students
ore not called upon to pay any addi
tional fee, but old students who were
in the University last semester and
did not get vaccinated must pay an ad
ditional fee of $2 before they can reg
ister, provided that tliey made an ef
fort to register on :egistration day.
II they did not try to register on Jan
uary 5, they are treated as if they
were registering late and are forced
to pay according to the number of
days that they are late.
