# Diamonds Put in Shape.
## 
### 
During the holidays the preparation
of College Field for the coming base
ball season has been progressing rap
idly under the direction of the Board
of Control. The diamond has been
levelled and will be putin first-class
condition by the opening of the season
The turf in Stanford Field has been
covered with a coating of sandy loam,
which will make the field much soft
er for next football season.
The diamond for the varsity games
will not be rolled, however, nor the
paths cut until it is definitely decided
where the Wallabies game will be
played.
If the game is played here, the dia
mond will be putin shape immediate
ly after it, in plenty of time for the
varsity contests.
