# RAZING OF CHURCH PROGRESSES.
## Demolition of Memorial Edifice Will Be Complete by Middle of March. 
### 
The work on the razing of Memo
rial Church has been progressing rap
idly during the Christmas holidays,
and, if it continues at the present rate,
the edifice will be down by the middle
of March. All the roofs have been
removed except that covering the ves
try, which will remain intact. The
outer walls of the front half of the
building have been reduced to within
fifteen feet of the ground, and the in
terior furnishings removed and placed
under shelter. The pipe organ has
been stored in the basement of the
History building.
The work of reconstruction will not
be begun for some time yet. Superin
tendent of Construction Bain has a
large force of men at work with pick
and derrick, and not until their work
of demolition is compete can the res
toration be commenced. The plans
for the new church are practically the
same as the old, with the ex
ception that those of the tower
are modified to some extent, omit
ting the chimes and the clock, and
conforming more with the style of ar
chitecture of the other University
buildings. All the stones which are
being taken down are being numbered,
so that they may be replaced as they
originally stood. The arches are skill
fully braced so as to preserve them
if possible.
