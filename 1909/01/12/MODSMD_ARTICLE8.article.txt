# Y. M. C. A. to Hold 50-Mile Relay Race
## 
### 
A unique indoor track meet is to be
held at San Jose on January IG, be
tween the Young Men's Christian As
sociations of San Francisco and San
Jose. The meet will be in the Audi
torium Skating Rink on Market street,
San Jose, at 6 p. m. The floor of the
building has been banked at both ends
and forms an eleven' lap track.
The meet is to consist of a fifty
mile relay race. Each team will be
represented by sixty menâ€”twenty
half-milers and forty milers. It is ex
pected that the race will take five
hours to run. When one of the milers
appears to be tiring and loses distance
I for his team, a half miler will be put
; in, and the lost distance recovered.
Thus, by interspersing the long and
short relays, the runners will always
l be close together and the interest will
be kept up throughout the whole meet.
This is the first contest of its kind
that has been hold on the Coast, and
a large attendance is expected. Music
! will be rendered by a San Jose band
during the meet.
