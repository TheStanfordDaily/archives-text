At a recent Assembly, certain mem
bers of the audience conducted them
selves in such a manner as to cause
comment, an expiespVon of which ap
peared in the columns of The Daily
Palo Alto in tho form of a commu
nication. We agree heartily with the
spirit in which we I elieve the com
munication was written, and, further
more, in the sentiments expressed.
There seems, however, to be another
side to the question. In the columns
of this issue will be found a statement
of a member of the Student Body.
Out of fairness to all concerned, and
with the idea of preventing the re
currence of such an episode, it is fit
ting that the situation be summed up
impartially.
Assemblies are vital in bringing the
entire community together and in
fostering a better understanding ol
conditions by expression of opinions
by strong speakers. Gatherings of
this nature are essential in the pro
ducing of strong, bread-minded grad
uates.
Therefore, taking (.his view of the
importance of the Assemblies, its the
duty of both audience and speakers to
see the opportunities offered are not
abused. As the writer of the commu
nication several days ago stated,
must first of all treat our guests with
all courtesy. The Committee on Pu 1-
lic Exercises, upon the other hand,
should be equally alive to the rights
of the audience, and refrain from in
viting any speaker but one who is, in
their minds, sure to bring a beneficial
thought and express it in a clear, in
teresting and commanding manner To
do this requires delicacy, we admit,
but do not think it can be ranked f\s
an impossibility.
Speakers are not difficult to find.
San Francisco is but an hour distant,
and other cities are close at hand.
In these metropolitan communities
are men who have won recog
nition in many branches of the

world's work. In our own number
are those who have not had an op
portunity lo become as well known
to the undergraduates as they are lo
the outside world.
Speakers from any of these groups
could be secured and would gladly
give the undergraduates the keynotes
of success in life. ll' such are se
lected, it is our opinion there will be
no "prevailing atmosphere of shifting
and whispering." It would be a grave
charge to attribute willful discourtesy
to such a general gathering of this
University as filled the Assembly Hall
last Thursday, and, while we urge
self-control and respect to our visit
ors, we also dislike to receive the lull
measure of blame.
If the last Assembly was a disap
pointment, the interest in future As
semblies should not be dampened. Ev
ery one should attend at the next gath
ering and show that no inhospitality
has been intended and give the Com
mittee on Public Exercises an oppor
tunity to demonstrate good, live
speakers are obtainable. We want
many and good Assemblies this year.
Let's hope the next will be soon.
