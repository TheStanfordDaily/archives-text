# STANFORD TO HAVE NEW SHELL.
## Assistant Manager Turner Negotiating with Eastern Representative for Eight-Oared Craft. 
### 
Assistant Manager F. W. Turner,
'08, is now negotiating with Captain
Dean Witter of the University of Cal
ifornia for a new eight-oared shell.
Witter is in the East at the present
time and is making i>lans for the pur
chase of two new shells, one for each
university, which will be exactly alike,
lie has been visiting the Cornell Boat
Club at Cornell University and mak
ing all preparations for the sending
out of two boats, such as are used in
the big Poughkeepsie regatta.
Last year the Cardinal rowers were
greatly handicaped by only having one
eight-oared shell, whiofc necessitated
a great deal of inconvenience on the
part of both the men and the coach,
as it was necessary to train two eight
oared crews. With the addition of an
other shell, the men will be given
more opportunity to row together, and
a great deal of competition between
the crews will give them the experi
ence and oarsmanship that is to de
velop a good crew.
The men are going through the
same routine of work every day, name
ly: setting-up exercises, calisthenics
and cross-country running. The row
ing machines will be placed in the
Moat house within the next few days,
and then the men will be given their
preliminary handling of the oars be
fore entering the shells or barges. The
varsity men and other crew men who
have been out before will be the first
to go in the boats.
