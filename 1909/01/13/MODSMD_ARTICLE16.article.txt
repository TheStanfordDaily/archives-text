# TRYOUTS FOR CHESS TEAM.
## Members of Club Will Hold Tournament for Selection of Intercollegiate Players. 
### 
The regular annual tryout for the
chess team is scheduled to begin next
week. From then on till the Raster
vacation, the players will contest for
a place on the team, which will be

secured by the elimination system.
This will allow ample time for the
team to prepare for the intercollegiate
tournament, to be held on the night of
the varsity track meet.
The Stanford club has been practic
ing steadily to the present time, and
with the long spring tournament
should be in shape to put up a strong
game with Berkeley. The men regis
tered in college who were on last
year's team are: F. Figg-Hoblyn, '09,
E. J. Cummings, '09. J. H. Pratt, '09,
and W. M. Davidson, 10.
The University of California is as
sured of even a stronger team than
that of last year, having in college,
in addition to three of last year's men,
two new and very strong players.
Encina Club is fortunate in having
secured a new chess table, with a set
of men, which is designed to conform
to the new furniture lately installed
in the clubroom.
