Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Sir: The recent communication in
The Daily Palo Alto by Mr. S. S. Sew
ard, commenting on the duty the stu
dents owe to our speakers in Assem
bly gatherings, was meritorious and
well-timed, considered from the stand
point of the speakers and the com
mittee who secured them.
However, the right of the auditors
to hear something worth while is im
perative and should receive some con
sideration by the parties who address
the Assembly. It is doubtless true
that a universal disturbance such as
occurred at the last Assembly would
be regarded as a breech of duty to
our guests, but it can scarcely be said
that it is our duty to listen patiently
to a listless reading of a time-worn
document on prison reform or an ex
tended excerpt from Babylonian cruel
ties. In short, the address as given
by Mr. Griffith was as much out of
place as the customary dog referred
to by Mr. Seward. It would, perhaps,
be presumptuous for a person inex
perienced in Mr. Griffith's line to crit
icise his remarks, from an argumen
tative point of view; but it is certain
that the opinion of the vast majority
of the student body is reflected when
it is declared that Mr. Griffith's lecture
was neither interesting nor instruc
tive. Who is to blame?
The committee is under no moral
obligation to date every gentleman of
leisure who proffers his services. They
are vested with discretion in this re
spect, and should exercise it in such
manner that the students would be
benefited by their choice of speakers.
Of course, men like Speer, Heney,
Mercer and some others who have left
a favorable impression are often diffi
cult to secure, and unquestionably it
is no easy matter to arrange pro
grams. On the othev hand, radicals,
who go about the country inflicting
pet theories upon the people whenever
and wherever permitted to do so, are
over-anxious to get an opportunity to
impose themselves on the public, and
should be carefully avoided in the fu
ture. D. F. Conway, '10.
