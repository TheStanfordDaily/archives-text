### 
The executive board of the Women's
Athletic Association held an important
meeting this noon. Miss M. Monteith,
'08, formerly vice-president of the as
sociation, succeeded to the presidency
left vacant by the graduation of Miss
B. Maine, '09, and Miss P. Abright, '08,
was elected alumnae member of the
board.
It was decided to award the mem
bers of the basketball team this year
with watch fobs. These will consist
of a silver seal, in the form of a bas
ketball, and will bear a red-enamel
' S." The members of the tennis team
will be awarded small gold racquet
pins, which will also bear a red enam
el "S." This awarding the members
of the teams with some trophy has
been meditated for several years, but
the association has never been in a
position to take definite action upon
the matter until this year.
The executive board wishes to an
nounce that the "S's" awarded to 1908
varsity basketball team have arrived
and may be obtained by application
to any of the officers of the associa
tion.
