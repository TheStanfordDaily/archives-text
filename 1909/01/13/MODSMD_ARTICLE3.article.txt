# Too Wet for Track Work.
## 
### 
A good many men were at the train
ing house this afternoon to do a lit
tle pre-season track work, but, owing
to the heavy rainfall, only a few went
out. Several old men signed up. It
is practically impossible to do any
work until the weather becomes more
favorable.
