# BASEBALL SEASON OPENS FRIDAY
## Large Number of Veteran Players Will Form Nucleus of Strong Nine.â€”Work on the Diamond Monday. 
### 
The baseball training season will be
opened next Friday afternoon, when
all aspirants for the varsity and in
terclass teams will sign up for work.
Coach Presley and Captain Sampson
have called a meeting of all baseball
men, to be held on that date in room
50 at 1:10. In addition to getting a
line on the material and the number
of men that are available this year,
Coach Presley and Captain Sampson
will deliver short talks, outlining the
plans for the season.
Seldom has the outlook for a suc
cessful season been as bright as are
the prospects at present. Seven of
the veterans who faced the California
Varsity last spring have returned to
college and will be eligible to take
part in the championship series this
year. They are: M. M. Mitchell, '10,
W. C. Theile, '08, J. H. Bell, '08, Cap
tain C. R. Sampson, '09, L. S. Scott,
'10, E. P. Tallant, '09, and C. F. Ga
nong, '10. One more veteran, T. R.
Cadwalader, '09, who played on the
victorious 1907 varsity against the
Blue and Gold, but who did not come
out a year ago, has signified his in
tention of signing up on Friday.
In addition to these old players,
there are a number of members of for
mer varsity squads who will be seen
on the diamond, when actual practice
starts on next Monday afternon.
Among these are L. Smith, '09, G. Mc-
Gregor, '09, F. A. Scofleld, '11, and B.
L. Ball, '11, all of whom should make
strong bids for varsity honors and all
of whom are eligible. Smith is a re
liable pitcher, and was a member of
the 1907 squad. Scofleld and McGreg

or played in the outfield in a number
of preliminary games last spring, and
Ball covered the Initial sack in
a creditable manner on several oc
casions.
Not only is Stanford fortunate in
having a large number of veterans at
the beginning of the season, but also
in the fact that these men are as
strong in the hitting department as
in fielding. The 1909 varsity bids fair
to be one of the hardest hitting ag
gregations that has been produced
here in some time.
Besides the players that have been
noted, there is said to be some excel
lent material in the Freshman class,
which should develop as the season
progresses.
Coach Presley will endeavor to have
the interclass series played off at an
early date, possibly within three or
four weeks. The class nines will, nec
essarily, be chosen in the near future
and regular practice for the series be
gun. It is likely that the interclass
games will reveal some material that
otherwise would not come to the no
tice of Coach Presley. For the pres
ent, at least, the regular practices will
be held on the old diamond on Gym
nasium Field. This is due to the fact
that it is located more conveniently
than the new diamond adjacent to
Stanford Field.
The varsity squad will at first com
prise only the vetera.i players. They
will fill their customary positions. The
rest of the men will be divided into
squads, in order to facilitate the prac
tices. These squads will be under the
' supervision of some of the old players.
