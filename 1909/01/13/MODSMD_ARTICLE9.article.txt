# WILL CONSIDER TRIP
## NO DECISION REACHED AS TO AUSTRALIAN GAMES. Determination of the Question Will Probably Be Left to the Varsity Fifteen. 
### 
Whether or not the Stanford Varsity
will journey to the Antipodes to meet
the Australian fifteens depends partly
upon the answer which Manager Stew
art receives to the proposition which
he made to them, and partly upon the
desire of the men who compose the
varsity team. Manager Stewart has
written to Australia to ascertain the
number of contests that would be held,
the amount that Stanford would be
guaranteed and the other details in
connection with the trip.
An answer is expected daily, and
as soon as it comes, a meeting of the
fifteen will be held to determine the
will of the men. A considerable num
ber of the players are strongly in fa
vor of the taking the journey, while
some are undecided or oppose it. It
is feared that in case the trip were
undertaken those of the men who de
pend upon their earnings in the sum
mer to defray their college expenses
would be unable to return next fall.
This would weaken next year's team
and might counterbalance the benefit
that would be derived from the expe
dition. The prevailing sentiment
among the players seems to be in
favor of the Australian games.
Active training for the game with
the Wallabies, which will be played
on February 17, will begin about the
first of next month. The men will
not be put on strict training rules, and
the practice will be light, consisting
largely of punting, passing the ball,
rucking and dribbling. About ten
days' practice is probably all that will
be indulged in preparatory to the con
test with the crack Australian team-
The exceptionally valuable experi
ence which the varsity received dur
ing the fall season, especially in the
Vancouver games, will stand them in
good stead in the contest with the
Wallabies, and, as the men are all in
good condition, no extensive training
is thought necessary.
The men who will be called on to
play in the game will be announced
by Coach Presley at a later date.
