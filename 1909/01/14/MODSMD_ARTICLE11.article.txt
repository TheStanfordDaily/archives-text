At the meeting of the Executive
Committee held last night, the advis
ability of awarding some sort of a
bronze token to the members of the
team which won the international
championship at Vancouver, was con
sidered. The proposition is a worthy
one. Several of the men who helped
Avin the championship in the North
did not play against the University
of California and did not receive the
gold footballs. They should have
some token of recognition from the
Student Body, and it is only fair that
ihe other players be given an inex
pensive fob or seal by which to re
member the unprecedented victories of
the past season.
