# MEN'S NEW DORMITORY
## WINERY TO BE REMODELED FOR HABITATION. Hoard of Trustees Grant Old Structure for Use of Students.â€”Building Is Large. 
### 
A new men's dormitory has been
secured through the efforts of Dr. Jor
dan at a recent meeting of the Board
of Trustees. For some time he has
been working to secure an additional
dormitory to remedy the present lack
of accommodations, but it was not
until the last meeting that the trus
tees took any definite action on the
matter.
Dr. Jordan first approached the
board with the suggestion that, if the
permission were granted, many of the
buildings on the stock farm might be
fixed up so that they could be used as
dormitories. This suggestion was
considered by the board, and it was
finally decided that it would not be
practical to remodel the old stock
farm buildings. Later the board de
cided to use for dormitory purposes
the old winery that lies about a quar
ter of a mile west of the Mausoleum
on the Stanford estate.
This building was erected about 20
years ago, and up to the time of the
earthcpiake was used as a winery. It
suffered damage at the time of the
earthquake, and since then has not
been used. It is a long barracks-like
structure, built of brick, two stories
high, with wings that extend to the
rear, making the building "U"-shaped.
The dimensions of the main building
are approximately 150x50 feet, the
wings extending toward the west about
fiO feet. The main building can be
made into three stories, as the second
floor is 20 feet above the lower floor.
As the interior of the building is un
finished. little or no tearing out will
have to be done before work is com
menced on making the place habitable.
The casks which were used when wine
was stored in the building are still
in place, but they are of such a size
that they can easily be removed. Be
fore the winery can be occupied, the
interior will have to be refinished
throughout. Windows will have to be
putin the walls, and the large doors,
which are placed at short intervals
around the whole building, will have
to be bricked up. These alterations
will take several months and will cost
a large sum of money. While it is not
known when these extensive improve
ments will be completed, the new
building can reasonably be expected to
be completed by next September.
So far as can be ascertained, no
plans have been made yet or any date
set for the beginning of the active
work of reconstruction. Superinten
dent of Construction Bain, when seen
yesterday, knew nothing of the ac
quisition of the winery and had noth
ing to say. No effort will be made to
remove the building from its present
location to a site nearer the Quad.
