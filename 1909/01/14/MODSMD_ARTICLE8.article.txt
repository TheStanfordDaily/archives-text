# ELECT QUAD EDITORS
## C.H. HAILS AND S.A. LINDAUER TO ISSUE 1910 ANNUAL. Junior Class Officers Are Nominated at Meeting Today.â€”Election Thursday on Quadrangle. 
### 
The Junior class met this afternoon
and nominated officers for the present
semester. The election will be held
on the Quad at the usual place, one
week from today. Only two offices are
to be contested as a result of today's
nominations.
The candidates for the various of
fices are as follows:
President, J. E. Shelton and C. F.
Ganong; vice-president, H. F. Allen;
treasurer, J. H. Menke; secretary,
Misses M. Miller and A. Perrine; ser
geant-at-arms, H. C. Warren.
Treasurer C. P. Taylor presented his
report for approval, and it showed the
class finances to be in good condition.
An auditing committee was appointed
to examine Taylor's accounts before
turning them over to his successor.
The Plug Ugly hat committee re
ported that a considerable number of
the hats that were ordered for the
Plug Ugly last semester had not been
disposed of, and recommended that
some action be taken looking toward
a sale or transfer of them to the
present Sophomore class. A commit
tee was named to confer with that
class, with a view of coming to some
satisfactory agreement.
The class was called upon to deal
with a situation that has confronted
none of its predecessors in the pub
lication of a Quad. The editorship of
the 1910 Quad was left vacant by the
failure of F. A. Adams to return to
college, and, in order to expedite the
work of compiling the annual, it was
necessary to immediately select his
successor. The class met the emer
gency by establishing a dual editor
ship, and chose C. H. Hails and S. A.
Lindauer as chief editors of the Quad.
This is the first instance in the his
tory of Stanford annuals that such ;i
plan has been adopted.
Hails has been prominently identi
fied with college journalism since his
Freshman year. He is now managing
editor of The Daily Palo Alto, an as
sociate on the Sequoia staff and a
Press Club member. Hails registers
ia the Department of Law from Santa
Barbara, and is a member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity.
Lindauer likewise registers in the
Law department. He comes from
Deming, N. M., and now fills the posi
tion of News Editor on The Daily Palo
Alto staff. He belongs to the Encina
and Press clubs.
The new editors of the Quad will
proceed at once with active work of
gathering the material for the year
book.
