# DISCOVERY EXPLAINED
## PROFESSOR G. HEMPL TALKS OF DECIPHERED RUNES. In Interesting: Lecture Philologician Tells of Acquisition of key to Mysterious Language. 
### 
Entering into a more detailed ex
planation of his world-famous discov
ery of the philological sphere of re
search, Professor George Hempl, in
his latest lecture upon that achieve
ment, has further elucidated upon his
work in that field, and has given to
the public his first explanation of
the manner in which he succeeded in
acquiring the key of the Etruscan lan
guage. Since his discovery, Profes
sor Hempl has been engaged in mak
ing further translations of the in
scriptions secured from tombs and
from the only existing manuscript
written in this language.
In the past, philological students
have endeavored to interpret the
queer-looking characters by the indi
vidual letters or by the phonetic plan.
But in his study along this line, Pro
fessor Hempl introduced an experi
ment by segregating syllables instead
of the individual letters, and found,
after an exhaustive research, that cer
tain vowels were omitted and implied
after consonants at different periods.
This defect was supplied by the stu
dent, and, as a result, many words
can now be formed and by their sim
ilarity to the Latin and by their use
can be translated. According to Pro
fessor Hempl, the language is some
what similar to the XJmbrian and Sa
binic as well as Latin, but the dis
tinction is made by him that they are
related in the position of distant cous
ins. The semblance is somewhat vague
and undefined, although fundamental
ly similar. After the language was
superseded by the Latin, the Etruscan
words were used in a liturgical sense,
and as such existed for some time
after the advent of Christ. At the
present day, there are only twenty or
thirty words upon which the philolog
ists can rely as being absolutely cor
rect.
The common conception among stu
dents along this line and in the
schools of philologists has been that
the Etruscan language is not related
to any speech known today, but the
interpretation put upon the runes by
Professor Hempl shows a marked sem
blance to the modern and archaic
Latin.
Inscriptions upon the tombstones of
priests and their assistants, which
have been found upon the island of
Lesbos and have never before been
translated, were recently interpreted
by Professor Hempl. From this latest
work it has been learned that the
Etruscans worshipped certain gods
and that their reverence partook of
a sacrificial nature, with some of the
Customs at least, similar to the relig
ious sacrifices of tbe Romans. The
domestic life and the more specific
history of the nation will not be antic
ipated unless another manuscript is
uncovered in the excavations that are
now progressing in these historical
spots, or some larger tablet, with more
than a sentence or two inscribed upon
it. conies to jight. Only one such doc
ument is, now in existence.
During the lecture many facsimiles
of the epitaphs and inscribed sen
wnces. found principally in the Aege

;in Islands and throughout northwest
ern Italy, which was at one time in
habited by these peoples, were used by
the lecturer in illustrating the work
done by him in this field.

after an exhaustive research, that cer
tain vowels were omitted and implied
after consonants at different periods.
This defect was supplied by the stu
dent, and, as a result, many words
can now be formed and by their sim
ilarity to the Latin and by their use
can be translated. According to Pro
fessor Hempl, the language is some
what similar to the XJmbrian and Sa
binic as well as Latin, but the dis
tinction is made by him that they are
related in the position of distant cous
ins. The semblance is somewhat vague
and undefined, although fundamental
ly similar. After the language was
superseded by the Latin, the Etruscan
words were used in a liturgical sense,
and as such existed for some time
after the advent of Christ. At the
present day, there are only twenty or
thirty words upon which the philolog
ists can rely as being absolutely cor
rect.
The common conception among stu
dents along this line and in the
schools of philologists has been that
the Etruscan language is not related
to any speech known today, but the
interpretation put upon the runes by
Professor Hempl shows a marked sem
blance to the modern and archaic
Latin.
Inscriptions upon the tombstones of
priests and their assistants, which
have been found upon the island of
Lesbos and have never before been
translated, were recently interpreted
by Professor Hempl. From this latest
work it has been learned that the
Etruscans worshipped certain gods
and that their reverence partook of
a sacrificial nature, with some of the
Customs at least, similar to the relig
ious sacrifices of tbe Romans. The
domestic life and the more specific
history of the nation will not be antic
ipated unless another manuscript is
uncovered in the excavations that are
now progressing in these historical
spots, or some larger tablet, with more
than a sentence or two inscribed upon
it. conies to jight. Only one such doc
ument is, now in existence.
During the lecture many facsimiles
of the epitaphs and inscribed sen
wnces. found principally in the Aege

;in Islands and throughout northwest
ern Italy, which was at one time in
habited by these peoples, were used by
the lecturer in illustrating the work
done by him in this field.
