Arrangements have recently been
made by which Stanford will have a
new eight-oared shell. It is farther
stated that the craft chosen for the
use of our oarsmen will be identical
with the one purchased by the repre
sentative of the University of Califor
nia. These facts are equally gratifying.
Beyond a doubt, another shell is
needed here, if crews are to be trained
satisfactorily. With intercollegiate
competition upon the basis of varsity
and freshman eights, two crews must
he coached and conditioned, and to do
this in one shell was found next to
an impossibility last year. Again, the
shell of the past two seasons has al
most outlived its usefulness. Eastern
universities do not use the shell in ac
tual competition more than one season
at the most.
Believing that a shell was necessary
for Cardinal oarsmen, the fact that a
similar one will be used by Berkeley
will make competition fair beyond a
shadow of a doubt. When the race is
over and the winning crew has crossed
the line, it will simply be a case of
one boat containing more skill and
brawn. The mechanical factor intro
duced by the shell will not be a cause
tor regret.
