# MINSTREL DATE SET
## COMBINED CLUB TO APPEAR IN SHOW FEBRUARY 20. More Men Are Needed and Meeting of Candidates Is Called for Tomorrow. 
### 
The minstrel show of the combined
musical clubs will take place on Sat
urday night, February lit), in the As
sembly Hall. Tomorrow afternoon at
i!: 30 there will be n meeting of all
those interested in the show at the
Sigma Nu house. The members of
the Glee and Mandolin clubs extend
an invitation to any member of the
community, who would like to take
part in the show, to meet with the
committee.
Several more men are wanted for
chorus work in the semi-circle. There
is also a position for a good end man.
The Glee and Mandolin clubs also
need an interlocuter for their produc
tion. The committee would also like
to confer with any people who would
like to stage a short skit or present
any other vaudeville feature, as there
is need of a few more such acts in the
part of the performance that follows
the black-face chorus work. The
meeting tomorrow afternoon is not a
tryout or a sizing-up of those who are
interested in this sort of work, but
rather is intended to be an opportu
nity for the committee to get ac
quainted with those who would like
to co-operate with the musical clubs.
The show that the clubs gave last
year occurred during the first sem
ester. There were forty-eight in the
semi-circle, six end men and an inter
locuter. The olio had eight vaudeville
acts that included skits, monologues
and musical numbers
P N. Hartzell, ex-07, who made one
of the hits as end man last year, may
be able to assist the club in this year's
undertaking. He is at present in Seat
tle, coaching a minstrel troupe.
