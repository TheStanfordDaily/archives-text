# MANY MEETS ASSURED
## NEGOTIATIONS FOR TRACK CONTESTS ARE SUCCESSFUL. Definite Dates to Be Determined Upon Return of Captain Horton. 
### 
Although a definite schedule of track
meets for this season has not as yet
been worked out, Manager Stewart
has received advices from the best of
the Coast teams which indicate that
an unusually complete program of
events can be arranged. No definite
dates can be set until the return of
Captain Horton, but at that time a
complete schedule will be made out.
During the season the Cardinal ath
letes will meet teams from Pomona
College, the University of Southern
California, the Olympic Club and the
University of California. There will
be two contests with the University of
Southern California, one to be held in
Los Angeles and one on the campus.
The southern institution desires the
meets to be held about the first of
April, but - this is thought to be too
late a date for the Stanford athletes,
and it is probable that the contests
will take place some time in March.
The Freshman team will be pitted
against the representatives of the local
high schools and also against St.
Mary's. The latter institution will put
a team in the field this season for the
first time in its history. The material
there is said to be very promising, and
this meet should afford the first-year
men some valuable training. A defi
nite schedule of m sets will be an
nounced by Manager Stewart some
time next week.
