# RESERVE FUND FOR ENTRY.
## Pasadena Tournament of Roses Club Makes Provision for Stanford Float Next Year. 
### 
The Pasadena Tournament of Roses
Club held its tirst meeting yesterday
afternoon, and it was unanimously
voted to use as much as necessary of
the cash prize won by the Stanford
automobile entry to pay expenses, and
to deposit the remainder in the Palo
Alto Bank, to be used toward a Stan
ford entry next New Year's.
The Stanford machine won the first
prize in the automobile class, and the
committee in charge had their choice
between a silver loviug cup or a sum
of money. After some discussion, they
chose the latter, owing to Stanford's
lack of a suitable place for trophies.
However, the banner, accompanying
the first prize, will be given to the Uni
versity.
With such a successful beginning,
the club hopes to be able to put a
larger entry in next year's tournament
and bring more trophies to the Uni
versity. The hearty approval of the
South toward this movement on the
part of Stanford students is expressed
by the following letter received by A.
C. Stelle, *10, president of the Tour
nament Club:
