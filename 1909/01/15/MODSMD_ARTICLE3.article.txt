# CREWS ON WATER TOMORROW.
## Lake Filling Rapidly.â€”Varsity to Be Heavy This Year, and Good Freshman Fight Anticipated. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon will mark the
beginning of the work on the water
for the boating men. The four-oared
shell and one-paired barge will be put
in use for the first time this season.
The water in Lagunita will probably
be up to the required height by Sun
day. Coach Murphy has just finished
varnishing the boats and everything is
in readiness for the rowers.
The old men as well as the new will
begin work at once on the six rowing
machines which have been installed at
the boathouse. Murphy will be on hand
from early morning until after dark
to work with the men when they are
able to putin the time.
The indications so far are that the
Cardinal will have a fast, heavy crew,
weighing considerably more than the
1908 Varsity. The prospects for a good
Freshman eight are good.
The following names have been add
ed to the original list: A. A. Stein
berger, '09, J. C. Hnston, '10, N. C.
Wilson, '12, and P. D. Nowell, '12.
