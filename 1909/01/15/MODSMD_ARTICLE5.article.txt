# LAW SCHOOL CREATED
## LEGAL DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED BY NEW NAME. Faculty Makes Use of Authority Conferred by the Hoard of Trustees. 
### 
The faculty of the Law department
has announced that, under the author-*
ity recently conferred by the Board of
Trustees, the professional course lead
ing to the degree of Juris Doctor will
be designated hereafter as "The Law
School of Stanford University." The
undergraduate course leading to the
degree of Bachelor of Arts will be
named "The Pre-legal Course."
This involves no change in the or
ganization of the faculty of the de
partment nor in the relation of the
faculty to the Academic Council and
the Board of Trustees. It is simply
a recognition of the fact that the grad
uate work is of such scope and charac
ter as to constitute what is generally
known as a graduate law school.
This also serves to emphasize the
distinction between students who are
taking undergraduate work in prepar
ation for the study of law and those
who have actually entered upon their
graduate professional studies.
As in the past, Pre-legal Majors will
be permitted to count one year of law
toward the A.B. degree, and thus to
complete their professional training in
six years after entering the University.
