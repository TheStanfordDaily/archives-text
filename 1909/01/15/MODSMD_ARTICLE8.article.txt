Fifty-two men, including seven vet
erans of intercollegiate baseball con
tests, signed up this afternoon for
practice in response to the call of Cap
tain Sampson. This is a trifle smaller
squad than that of a year ago, but the
list will doubtless be augmented with
in the next few days. Several men
who have announced their intention of
trying out for positions on the Varsity
and class teams failed to sign up this
afternoon.
Coach Presley in a short talk out
lined to the men the plans to be fol
lowed in the work of the present sea
son. Beginning with next Monday
afternoon, practice will be held daily
during the week at 4:30. The prelim
inary practices are to be held on the
old Varsity diamond on gymnasium
field. Training rules will be announced
at an early date and strict adherence
to them 011 the part of all candidates
required thereafter.
Former Varsity players and substi
tutes will constitute the Varsity squad
for the present. In the competition
for places, barring pitching and catch
ing positions, 011 the various teams,
the batting, base running and fielding
ability of the candidates will be con
sidered in the order named.
The members of the Varsity squad
will not be permitted to participate in
the interclass championship series.
Nor will any player be selected for a
position 011 a class team who has not
practiced daily under the direction of
Coach Presley and assistants. Follow
