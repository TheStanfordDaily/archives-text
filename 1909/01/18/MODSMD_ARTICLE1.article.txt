# MME. GADSKI PLEASES
## WORLD-FAMOUS SINGER CAPTIVATES LARUE AUDIENCE. First Concert of Semester Held in Assembly Hall Friday Night a Big Success. 
### 
Gadski more than equaled the ex
pectations of an enthusiastic audience
that nearly filled Assembly Hall last
Friday evening. She was applauded at
every opportunity. Her tones, rich
and of a liquid sweetness in the lower
and middle registers, were always
kept pure by that nice enunciation
which has often been remarked. Her
program allowed Mme. Gadski to dis
play a pleasing degree of varsatility,
and her interpretation of each song
was thoroughly convincing.
Haydn's "My Mother Bids Me Bind
My Hair" was the classical opening
number, and was so well received as
to be repeated. Several songs were
done twice. Great finesse character
ized the rendition of "Phillis Has Such
Charming Graces," and after"The
Lass with the Delicate Air," it was
but natural for the audience to asso
ciate these attributes with Mme. Gad
ski herself. She gave a powerful in
terpretation of the "Erlking."
Gadski's German songs were espe
cially good. Brahms' "Message" she
sang with the requisite degree of col
oring and "With the Water Lily" of
Grieg with rare delicacy. Two artistic
compositions by Frank La Forge, "Ex
pectancy" and"In (\er Abendstille,"
received liberal applause.
Browning's Song, an encore, was
gratifying.
In solo, Mr. La Forge was not so
great a success as in composition and
accompaniment. In the last art he
achieved almost perfest sympathy.
Gadski reached the climax of her
artistic powers in her Wagnerian
numbers. Hardly more could be wish
ed for in dramatic interpretation than
what she gave in 'Elsa's Dream"
("Lohengrin") and in "Dich theure
Halle" ("Tannhauser ').
The special train that brought the
people from San Jose arrived late.
Gadski would not commence until they
had taken their seats, but stood for
several minutes, wailing with admir
able patience, and from the moment
that she beckoned the late-comers for
ward until the final encore, the cry
of the Valkyrie, the audience was with
her.
