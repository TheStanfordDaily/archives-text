Players of basketball at the Univer
sity of California are anxious to place
this sport upon an intercollegiate ba
sis and have secured the sanction of
the Executive Committee of their stu
dent body. A repre jentative visited
the campus yesterday with the idea
of bringing the matter before the
proper authorities heie. This has led
to a consideration of this branch of
athletics by local men who have play
ed the game, and tomorrow afternoon
a meeting of all who are interested
will be held.
Basketball is a sport which has been
rated upon an intercollegiate basis by
the universities of the Atlantic States.
The inauguration of the game here
has the sanction and enthusiastic sup
port of Coach Presley, who is an old
player and appreciates the good which
can result from a revival of this
branch of competition.
Manager Stewart believes the sport
is worthy of an intercollegiate foot
ing, and it seems that all that is nec
essary to launch the game upon a
recognized basis between the Cardi
nal and the Blue and Gold is the sup
port of able players. When the meet
ing is called tomorrow, all men who
have played the game prior to coming
to college and who understand the
points of the sport, should be 011 hand.
It is safe to say enough men will show
up to insure a series of games, but
California has a good team, and the
initial quintet which bears the name
of Stanford should be a worthy one.
