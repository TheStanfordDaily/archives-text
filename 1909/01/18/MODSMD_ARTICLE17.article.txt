# PREACHES ON FAITH
## REV. D. CHARLES GARDNER OCCUPIES PULPIT. Chaplain Emphasizes Relation of Faith and Reason and Value of Roth to Religion. 
### 
The subject of ''Faith" was the
theme chosen by the Reverend D.
Charles Gardner when he preached be
fore a well-tilled Chapel at yesterday
morning's service. Taking the thir
teenth verse of the thirteenth chapter
of First Corinthians, "And now abid
eth faith, hope and love, these three;
but the greatest of these is love," as
a text, the chaplain preached a strong
sermon 011 the basic value of faith in
all phases of human activity and the
inadequacy of reason alone as a help
in the pursuit of a successful life.
Rev. Gardner said in part:
"Guided by reason alone, we blind
ly grope our way along the path of
life, but with faith in Jesus Christ as
the guiding influence, we are rightly
directed to our destination. Loyalty
to the personality of the Lowly Naz
arine empowers man to the noblest ef
fort. Nothing breaks down faith bet
ter than sin.
"This age has been called an age
of doubt. This is a mistake, for men
of today do not live in the scholastic
age, and it is well that we weave and
think and ask advice. Men who do
this do not necessarily doubt. Rea
son does nothing more than define
and develop faith, but faith is not
founded on reason. Faith is an in
tuition of the soul, and the soul is the
well-spring of life. Christianity is a
rational religion, because it is found
ed on faith. Faith is the basis of all
religions, and it connects man with
God and the whole spiritual king
dom."
