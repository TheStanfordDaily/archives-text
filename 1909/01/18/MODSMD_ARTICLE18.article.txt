# Y.W.C.A. Secure Well-Known Teacher.
## 
### 
The Y. W. C. A. have secured Dr.
Castor for the speaker at the next
regular meeting, to be held Tuesday
afternoon at 4:30 in the Chapel. Dr.
Castor, who is at the head of the De
partment of the New Testament in the
Pacific Theological Seminary, in
Berkeley, is well known on the camp
us. During the present college year
he will lead a Bible class, under the
auspices of the Stanford Young Wo
men's Christian Association, in the
study of the Gospel of John.
As special music has been provided,
and Dr. Castor's speech will be a
good one, the meeting promises to be
one of the best. Every woman in the
University is invited.
