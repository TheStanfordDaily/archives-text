Interest in the University Y. M. C.
A. seems to have been greatly revived
by the recent lectures of E. C. Mercer.
D. W. Wiest, the secietary of the as
sociation, reports that at least twenty
classes for Bible study have been or
ganized by students living in Encina,
Palo Alto and the Terrace.
Each class contains from six to
twelve members. The groups are
mainly taught by one of the members,
although in some cases outside teach
ers have been engaged.
The association gives all the credit
for this good work to the suggestions
and practical advice of the lecturer,
and hopes to obtain the services of
more good speakers along this line to
keep up the present enthusiasm.
