# CREWS PRACTICE ON WATER.
## Varsity and Freshman Oarsmen Rom Saturday for the First Time This Season. 
### 
The crew squads began active work
011 the water last Saturday afternoon.
Coach Murphy had the men out in the
four- and two-oared \jarges and some
spirited practicing was indulged in
by the varsity and Freshman rowers.
The water in Laguuita is up to the
required height, and the fountain in
the middle of the lake has been turned
on. The four-oared shell that was
used at Redwood la. 6 t year is at the
boathouse now, and will be in use
soon.
All the Freshman rowers are re
quested from now on to be at the boat
house every morning at 6 o'clock, so
that Coach Murphy will have more
time to devote to the perfecting of a
1912 crew.
Four rowing machines have been
installed in the training quarters, and
three more are expected within the
next few days.
