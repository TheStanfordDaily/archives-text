# TO PLAY BASKET-BALL
## CALIFORNIA ANXIOUS FOR REVIVAL OF THE SPORT. Proposal Meets Favor of Players, Coach Presley and Manager Stewart. —Meeting Tomorrow. 
### 
There is a possibility of another
sport being added to the list of inter
collegiate contests. A representative
of the University of California was on
the campus yesterday, endeavoring to
make arrangements for a series of
basketball games between teams from
the two institutions. California is anx
ious to take up the &port, and is cer
tain to put out a strong team, if the
contest is agreed upon. There have
been interclass basketball games for
several years past at Berkeley, and a
team representing the University has
played many outside games.
Basketball is an extremely popular
game in the eastern colleges and uni
versities, and is considered to be on
the same status as other intercolle
giate contests, the men playing on the
teams receiving their varsity letters.
A considerable degree of interest
has been aroused over the prospect of
a revival of the intercollegiate games,
and Coach Presley, who played bas
ketball here several years ago, is
strongly in favor of the game. He has
signified his willingness to assist in
coaching the team as much as his time
will permit.
Those who are promoting the sport
are desirous of obtainng the privilege
to be called the Stanford team, and
it is quite probable that the Execu
tive Committee will grant their re
quest. There is good material in the
University for a strong team, among
the experienced players being C. C.
Terrill, '09, who has played in San
Francisco; W. H. Masters, '09, Port
land, who was a member of the team
here several years ago; G. B. Bush,
'09, of Riverside; M. M. Mitchell, '10,
of Los Angeles.
There will be a meeting of all those
interested in the game tomorrow af
ternoon at 5 o'clock «'n Encina Gym
nasium.
