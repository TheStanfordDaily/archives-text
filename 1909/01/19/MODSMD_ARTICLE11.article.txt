London, England, who is here at the
invitation of the Committee on Public
Entertainments and the Stanford Art

"Handicrafts and Socialism," and will
tell of the work that is being done

Ashbee has won international fame
as an architect, artist and author as
well as a social service worker, and
his subject deals with this work. The

sities of this country, and his lectures
have been attractive.

pate.
