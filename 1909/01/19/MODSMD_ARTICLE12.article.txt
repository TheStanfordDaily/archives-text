# ENGLISH CLUB ANNUAL PLANS.
## Hoard of Editors Commences Work of Compiling Year-Book.â€”To Hold Reception. 
### 
Though the English Club has not
held a regular meeting yet this sem
ester, some important organization
business has been transacted.
Miss H. V. Campbell has been ap
pointed to the board of editors of the
Stanford Year-Book, in place of L. S.
Walbridge, '08, who graduated last
semester.
The Year Book is a publication of
local fiction, poems, farces and edito
rials, which the club plans to publish,
providing enough material is sub
mitted.
The club is very desirous of having
the stories sent in promptly. The vol
ume will be inclusive in its scope, and
the stories are to be chosen by the
board of editors from all material that
may be submitted in competition.
Upton Sinclair, the noted writer and
author of "The Jungle," has promised
to speak before the club at some early
date before he leaves Palo Alto, where
he has been working on a new play.
The officers of the English Club
have completed arrangements for the
entertainment of Miss Katherine Ev
erts, the well-known dramatic imper
sonator, following her performance in
Assembly Hall, February 6. A recep
tion will be tendered Miss Everts at
the Kappa Kappa Gamma house.
Sword and Sandals and the Maskers
will also be guests of the club. Miss
L. B. Mirrielees, '08, Miss C. A. Good
hue, '09, and H. L. Rixford, '09, will
have charge of the function.
The club will meet next Wednesday
evening to discuss the question of
bringing out a new edition of the
"First Year at Stanford," for which
there is a heavy demand.
