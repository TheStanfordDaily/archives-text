Every man who can run or jump or
is capable of contesting in a weight
event will be needed upon the track
this semester, if Stanford is to win
intercollegiate honors in this branch
of athletics. The annual rally will
be held in Encina Club-room tomor
row night, at which Dad Moulton will
ask all candidates to place their
names on the training list. This an
nouncement should be sufficient to in
sure the full representation of avail
able talent in the University.
It is safe to say the number of old
men who respond to the call will be
large, but for the sake of those who
have never worn a spiked shoe in
competition here, it is well that the
necessity of a large squad be brought
to their notice.
Annually we are pitted against the
University of California in the most
important meet of the season. From
the very nature of the universities,
the Blue and Gold has a handicap,
which we must overcome. The reg
istration of the State institution is
practically twice the size of the Stan
ford Student Body. Again, the loca
tion of Berkeley gives our competi
tors an opportunity to draw more
largely upon the best high school tal
ent of the cities about the Bay.
These two factors —and they are
only two of the number that the Card
inal must contend with—should make
it evident to those who are new to
this University of the need that will
be felt on the track.
Dad Moulton will tell tomorrow
night what he will want of the can
didates this year, and upon the con
clusion of the rally the training list
should read like a roll call.
