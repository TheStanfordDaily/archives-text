# Rugby to Become Leader on Coast.
## 
### 
A very important, step in relation to
the playing of Rugby football is soon
to be taken. A special meeting will
be called, with representatives from
all local high schools, from Stanford,
California, the Olympic and Barbarian
organizations. At this meeting the
merits of American and Rugby foot
ball will be discussed, tending to a
complete invasion of Rugby into the
schools and colleges not yet playing
it. The date for the meeting has not
yet been set, but it is expected that
it will be called in the near future.
