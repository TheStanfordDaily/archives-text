# NOTED ARCHITECT SPEAKS.
## Origin and Work of Guild of Handicrafts Form Substance of Interesting Speech. 
### 
In a comprehensive lecture last
evening in the Assembly Hall, C. R.
Ashbee of London, England, outlined
the growth and gave a resume of the
work accomplished by the Guild of
Handicrafts. Ashbee is now en route
on a tour throughout America in an
endeavor to discover to what extent
the teachers of this country have in
terested themselves in this method of
educating.
Ashbee told how, with Ruskin as
the pioneer, and W. Morris acting as
a principal promoter of the movement,
the Guild has taken for its object the
making of useful things by hand. Un
der his leadership, a community of
workers has been established in a
small village in Gloucestershire. With
one hundred and fifty persons in the
village, an effort is being made to
revive some of the guild spirit of the
Middle Ages, which resulted in such
excellent workmanship.
The work has advanced to a sci
entific basis, from which machinery
and its aids to labor are now studied
with a view to determining their eco
nomic and human efficiency in the la
bor world.
The address was illustrated by ster
eopticon views depicting the work ac
complished by the organization dur
ing the eighteen years of its exist
ence.
