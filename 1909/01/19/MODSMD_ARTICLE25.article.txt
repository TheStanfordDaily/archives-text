A regular meeting of the Education
Club was called to order last evening
by President H. V. Greenwood, 'OS,
who gave an interesting talk on "The
Personal Qualities of an Administra
tive Officer in Education," in which
he brought out the necessity of pos
sessing characteristics such as tact,
good-breeding and knowledge of hu
man nature, in a position of leader
ship in work of instruction.
The members of the club then had
a round-table discussion on the gen
eral and professional training that is
also necessary to make one a really
valuable educator.
