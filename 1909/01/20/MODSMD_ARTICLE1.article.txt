# TALKS ON HANDICRAFT
## ASHBEE ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY ON "ARTS AND CRAFTS." Noted Architect Explains Craftsmanship Movement as Socialistic Rebellion Against Machinery. 
### 
C. R. Ashbee's address before the
Assembly this morning was an inter
esting exposition of a phase of So
cialism that has received but little at
tention from socialistic thinkers in
this country. He explained the sig
nificance of the Arts and Crafts move
ment in connection with the general
Socialist propaganda, and gave an
ethical and altruistic interpretation to
the Marxian doctlines.
"Socialism is a faith, whose objec
tive is the betterment of society, by
which it is sought to arrive at a thor
ough and more equitable distribution,
based upon a more collective produc
tion of wealth, the sanction for which
rests upon the scientific, historical
and ethical principles." With the
above definition as a text for his re
marks, the speaker pictured the state
of industry and society that would re
sult from the application ot' the prin
ciples for which he stands.
He characterized this as an age ot
mechanical prowess and machine pro
duction, the prevailing spirit of which
is to eliminate all regard for the
finer human feelings of the workers
and to subjugate their personality to
a cold-blooded commercialism. Of
late, however, a feeling has been ap
parent in all classes of society that
this system of industry which has
grown up as a result of the indus
trial revolution is at fault, and that
somethng is needed to remedy it.
The Socialism which Ashbee advo
cates does not contemplate the "shar
ing of wealth, or the interference
with trade or politics." which seems
to be the prevailing idea of the social
reformers of today. The ideal state
of society which he set forth was one
where unrestrained and lawless com
petition for the mere necessities of life
would be eliminated and each individ
ual worked at those occupations which
he took pleasure in.
In explaining the influence which
the Arts and Crafts movement has
had upon Socialism, he defined Arts
and Crafts as "those occupations and
pursuits, in the practice of which the
individual comes into direct contact
with his material and is enabled to
give expression to his own fancy, in
vention and imagination. The object
of the craftsman is to impress his own
individuality upon the products of his
labor and to emphasize the human
istic and artistic side of production in
distinction to the crude uniformity
and inartistic appearance of the ma
chine products." In his scheme of
society the producer works for the
enjoyment of creating an artistic and
line article and not for commercial
gain.
The speaker did not urge an imme
diate or a radical change from pres
ent conditions, but stated as his be
lief that the reform should be grad
ual and at the same time permanent.
In this way there would result "an
ideal democracy and civilization
wherein all men would be placed on
an equal basis in the material things
of life, and the only competition would
be to excel in higher things. In this

sort of a social scheme," said the
speaker, "civilization would not he
tested by the great railway systems of
;i country nor hy the fineness of its
nickel bath fittings, but by the finer
things, by the beauty of its cities, the
greatness of its universities, the stan
dard of excellence attained in its art
and literature, and by a finer Chris
tian feeling."
During the Assembly the candidates
for the position of a assistant yell
leader were given tryouts in order to
enable the Executive Committee t;>
judge of their relative merits for tho
position.

this system of industry which has
grown up as a result of the indus
trial revolution is at fault, and that
somethng is needed to remedy it.
The Socialism which Ashbee advo
cates does not contemplate the "shar
ing of wealth, or the interference
with trade or politics." which seems
to be the prevailing idea of the social
reformers of today. The ideal state
of society which he set forth was one
where unrestrained and lawless com
petition for the mere necessities of life
would be eliminated and each individ
ual worked at those occupations which
he took pleasure in.
In explaining the influence which
the Arts and Crafts movement has
had upon Socialism, he defined Arts
and Crafts as "those occupations and
pursuits, in the practice of which the
individual comes into direct contact
with his material and is enabled to
give expression to his own fancy, in
vention and imagination. The object
of the craftsman is to impress his own
individuality upon the products of his
labor and to emphasize the human
istic and artistic side of production in
distinction to the crude uniformity
and inartistic appearance of the ma
chine products." In his scheme of
society the producer works for the
enjoyment of creating an artistic and
line article and not for commercial
gain.
The speaker did not urge an imme
diate or a radical change from pres
ent conditions, but stated as his be
lief that the reform should be grad
ual and at the same time permanent.
In this way there would result "an
ideal democracy and civilization
wherein all men would be placed on
an equal basis in the material things
of life, and the only competition would
be to excel in higher things. In this

sort of a social scheme," said the
speaker, "civilization would not he
tested by the great railway systems of
;i country nor hy the fineness of its
nickel bath fittings, but by the finer
things, by the beauty of its cities, the
greatness of its universities, the stan
dard of excellence attained in its art
and literature, and by a finer Chris
tian feeling."
During the Assembly the candidates
for the position of a assistant yell

C. R. Ashbee's address before the
Assembly this morning was an inter
esting exposition of a phase of So
cialism that has received but little at
tention from socialistic thinkers in
this country. He explained the sig
nificance of the Arts and Crafts move
ment in connection with the general
Socialist propaganda, and gave an
ethical and altruistic interpretation to
the Marxian doctlines.
"Socialism is a faith, whose objec
tive is the betterment of society, by
which it is sought to arrive at a thor
ough and more equitable distribution,
based upon a more collective produc
tion of wealth, the sanction for which
rests upon the scientific, historical
and ethical principles." With the
above definition as a text for his re
marks, the speaker pictured the state
of industry and society that would re
sult from the application ot' the prin
ciples for which he stands.
He characterized this as an age ot
mechanical prowess and machine pro
duction, the prevailing spirit of which
is to eliminate all regard for the
finer human feelings of the workers
and to subjugate their personality to
a cold-blooded commercialism. Of
late, however, a feeling has been ap
parent in all classes of society that
this system of industry which has
grown up as a result of the indus
trial revolution is at fault, and that
somethng is needed to remedy it.
