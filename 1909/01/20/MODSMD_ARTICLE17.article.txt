# Mandolin Club Elects Four Men.
## 
### 
The Mandolin Club elected four
men to their organization as the re
sult of a tryout held last evening. The
men who were successful were E. F.
Farnsworth, '11, M. W. Strong, '11, L.
Garat, '11, and E. L. Dickover, '11.
Strong, of the quartet that made the
club, will play first mandolin, and
the other three second mandolin. The
club would like to have any men that
play guitars or 'cellos arrange for a
tryout, for the reason that a few more
players on these instruments may be
taken into the club.
