# New Chandeliers for Encina Clubroom
## 
### 
Encina Club is continuing its policy
of refurnishing the clubroom by se
curing from Treasurer Lathrop the
permission to replace the old chande
liers with new ones, to be purchased
by the club. It is largely through the
persona] efforts of President J. P.
Hemphill, '09, that the required per
mission was granted.
The chandeliers to be installed are
of the popular mission style, with
brass fixtures and chains. It is plan
ned to purchase one large, central
chandelier and eight other smaller
ones, to be installed along the sides
of the room and in the corner. All
of them will be in use shortly.
The board of directors at its last
meeting, besides ordering the chande
liers, also subscribed for a number
of new magazines and ordered twenty
five new magazine binders for use in
the clubroom.
