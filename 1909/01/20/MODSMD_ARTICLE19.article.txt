# Business Men Visit Campus.
## 
### 
The Business Men's League of
Walla-Walla, Wash., today passed
through I'alo Alto, on their tour of
the State. The special train stopped
long enough to allow the tourists to
make a trip about the campus. Their
journey will continue through the
southern part of the State.
