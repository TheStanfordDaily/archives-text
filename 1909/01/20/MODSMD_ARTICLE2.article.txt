# ANNOUNCES TRY-OUTS
## INTERCLASS TEN MS SINGLES NEXT SATURDAY. Committee Will Held Separate Tournaments for Singles and Doubles Matches. 
### 
The committee in charge of the
tennis tournaments has scheduled the
interclass singles for next Saturday
morning. Last year this event took
place during the fall semester, and
was completed in the spring. This
method has been found unsatisfactory,
so the present change was decided up
on. On account of the small number
of entries, the committee has decided
to separate the singles from the dou
bles tournament, charging a 50-cent
fee for each.
No prizes have been offered, but it
iÂ« expected that the low entrance fee
and the fact that class sweaters are
awarded to the winners of the inter
class series in both singles and dou
bles will be sufficient inducement to all
tennis enthusiasts. A number of last
semester's players are at present oc
cupied with other athletic activities,
but they will probably enter the var
sity tryouts later in the season.
The drawing for the singles tour
nament will be held next Friday night
and play will commence the following
morning. There is an elimination try
out for all of the classes, and the vic
tors of each challenge the successful
contestants of the next lower class.
A. J. Gowan, '09, and E. Jordan,
'09, have entered as the Senior team;
T. C. Henry, '10, and H. Mann, '10, as
Juniors, and it is probable that E.
Canterbury, '12, S. C. Kennedy, '12,
and W. E. Ferguson, '12, will repre
sent the Freshmen. The sophomores
have not as yet designated their team.
The Tennis Club plans to have a
number of San Francisco players here
to practice with varsity candidates af
ter the completion of the interclass
tournament.
