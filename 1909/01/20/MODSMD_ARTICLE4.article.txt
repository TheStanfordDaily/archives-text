# OUTLINES QUAD PLANS
## 1916 BOARD TO FOLLOW IDEAS OF FORMER EDITOR. Many Important Innovations Arranged.â€”Art Work to Be Main Feature of Publication. 
### 
Active work in the preparation of
the material for the 1910 Quad was
begun last evening, when the Quad
Hoard met for the first time this sem
ester. Plans for the publication of
the book were discussed and agreed
upon, while the gathering of material
was reapportioned among the mem
bers of the board in such a manner
that work in nearly every department
is either already under way or will
be begun immediately and the first
copy ready for the printer within a
few days.
As far as possible, it is the inten
tion of the board to carry out the
plans of former Editor F. A. Adams,
and with this end in view, a slight
change will be made in the arrange
ment ot the order of the various de
partments of the annual. This is for
the purpose of putting the more im
portant sections nearer th front of the
book. The department of the college
year, inaugurated in the 1908 annual,
proved so important a department last
year that it will be amde the special
feature of the 1910 book, and will be
more fully illustrated than before.
Special attention will be paid to the
art work, and it is planned to make
this a leading feature of the book. A
considerable amount of work has al
ready been completed by the art staff,
under the direction of J. M. Wads
worth, and much of this material is
ready for the engraver. This depart
ment will also contain work done by
the best artists now in the University
and several former students promi
nent for their "illustrative work." In
the literary department, also, much of
the material will be contributed by
graduates who have established a rep
utation for their work in the literary
or journalistic field.
A new department will be inaugu
rated in this year's annual, which will
be devoted to women's athletics and
the various organizations connected
with these activities.
The Quad Board as now organized
is as follows:
Debating and Athletics, S. A. Lin
dauer and C. H. Hails: Dramatics and
Music, Miss M. Howell and C. I'.
Happy; Women's Department and
Sororities, Miss M. Howell and Miss
