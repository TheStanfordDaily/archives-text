11. Hilton, '11, N. C. Wilson, '12. The
general subject of the Carnot debate
has been in the bands of these can
didates during the past month, and
an exhaustive study of the question
has been pursued by. them in antici
pation of the tryouts and the final
contest.
The judges who will officiate to
morrow evening have been secured,
and consist of Professor F. C. Wood
ward, the head of the Law School;
Assistant Professor C. A. Huston,
from the same department of instruc
tion, and R. M. Alden, Assistant Pro
fessor in the Department of English.
Although the list of candidates this
year does not include that of W. C.
Shelton, '08, who was successful in
winning the Carnot medal for Stan
ford last February, the aggregation
is a strong one. Two of the con
testants were upon the Carnot trio
in last year's struggle against the
representatives from the University of
California, both Boyd and Shelton act
ing as members of that team. They
are also experienced intercollegiate
debaters. Among the others, there are
men who have represented their
classes in interclass debates, both
Hilton and Wilson during the present
semester having taken part in debat
ing along this line. Practically the
entire list is composed of active par
ticipants in the debating circles of
the University. In reviewing the sit
uation, Stanford is certain of again
putting into the field against Cali
fornia a strong trio, with bright pros
pects of capturing a sixth victory.
At 6 o'clock tomorrow evening the
contestants will be given the sealed
envelopes at the Chapel with the spe
cific question for each candidate's
speech, and it is urged by the com
mittee in charge that all upon the
list be there promptly. The remain
ing two hours is allowed to the
speakers to arrange their subjects
and to formulate their speeches. The
committee which has charge of this
selection is made up of Professor C.
H. Huberich of the Law School, Pro
fessor A. L. Guerard from the De
partment of Romantic Languages, and
Professor E. D. Adams, the head of
the History department.

with the condition that at least four
minutes be given to one of the divi
sions that he is allowed to make in

his address. The general subject for
