## Singles Tennis Tournament to Be Held for Silver Golf Cup.â€” Games with Mills. 
### 
At a meeting of the women's ten
nis board yesterday, definite plans
were made for the semester. The
Stanford Golf Club, upon its dissolu
tion, presented to women's tennis its
large silver loving cup. The board
decided to hold this cup as a perma
nent challenge trophy, which will be
kept one year by the winner.
In March the singles tournament
will take place, and the winner of this
will be awarded the cup. Hereafter,
however, this tournament will be
played off in the fall semester, when
the doubles match takes place.
The committee discussed dates for
the various contests, and decided to
have an intercollegiate match with
Mills College, preliminary to the one
with California. The tryout for the
intercollegiate team will be held en
tirely separate from the champion
ship match.
The committee is endeavoring to
get a coach to begin work before the
intercollegiate matches, but as yet no
one has been obtained. It is expected
that the more extensive plans for ten
nis work this semester will result in
the active interest of the University
women.
