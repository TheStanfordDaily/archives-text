# MANY TRACK MEN ANSWER CALL
## One Hundred and Thirty-five Athletes Come Out For Track After Enthusiastic Rally.—Few Veterans Signed at Present. 
### 
"We need every man —the
small man as well as (lie large,
husky athlete—and every man
who conies out helps lo in
crease the interest among the
athletes. He helps himself, as
he has a good chance to im
prove and win his letter. At any
rate, do something, and don't
leave all the work and grind to
a few men. There will always
he some one to help and in
struct new men, and after you
do your best, it is 110 disgrace
to lose out,"—Dad Moulton.

One hundred and thirty-five men
signed up for track work last even
ing at the rally, which ushered in the
season of 1909, and the clubroom of
Encina Hall was filled with an enthu
siastic audience wlrch cheered the
speakers vigorously. While the num
ber of men signed up is somewhat
less than last season, when one hun
dred and fifty-four candidates an
swered the call for material, there
are a number of the varsity men who
have not yet signed, and many were
undoubtedly kept away by the incle
ment weather, so that the list will
probably be materially increased
within a few days.
Forty-six of the men who have sig
nified their intention of coming out
for track work this season are Fresh
men, and among the first-year men
there are several having good prepar
atory school records in their various
events, who may be expected to make
an excellent showing under the
coaching of Trainer Moulton.
A. E. Roth, president of the student
body, was the first speaker of the eve
ning, and emphatically urged all not
engaged in other branches of spring
athletics to come out this season and
help till the places on the team which
have been left vacant. He brought
out the point that previous experi
ence was unnecessary, and illustrat
ed his remarks by several examples of
piominent Stanford athletes who
made their "S" by hard work, though
apparently ordinary material at first.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton made a di
rect appeal to every man to come out
and help to increase the interest. He
said, in part: "We need every man
—the small man as well as the large,
husky athlete —and every man who
comes out helps to increase the inter
est among the athletes. He helps
himself, as he has a good chance to
improve and win his letter. At any
rate, do something, and don't leave
all the work and grind to a few men.
There will always be some one to
help and instruct new men, and af
ter you have tried your best, it is no
disgrace to lose out."
Captain Horton summed up the
prospects for the season very brief
ly, urging Freshmen to get out and

take the places of the men lost last
year. He outlined the plans for the
year, stating that Trainer Moulton
would be at the track every afternoon
and Tuesday and Thursday mornings,
for the purpose of aiding all who
wished his advice. Training rules
will not be strictly enforced until af
ter February 1, though every one is
expected to work out regularly from
this time on.
