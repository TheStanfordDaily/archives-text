No attempt has been made up to
date to organize the University Or
chestra. A meeting of this organi
zation will probably be held soon,
and, judging from expressions of opin
ion made by members of orchestra, a
motion for disbandment is probable.
Any step in this direction should be
discouraged.
The difficulties which confront the
members of the organization are not
to be belittled, but the urgent need
of the Orchestra during the present
semester is even greater. To be
forced to pay professional musicians
to render music at the class produc
tions and functions which will be held
in Assembly Hall would reflect most
seriously upon the University.
The situation calls for enthusiastic
and united effort upon the part of
the old members of the Orchestra. A
determination to sustain this Stan
ford institution in the face of diffi
culties is sure of hearty support from
the members of the Studnet Body.
