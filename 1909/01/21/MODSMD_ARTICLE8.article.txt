The number of debators who have
signed up to try for places on the
Carnot trio that will meet the picked
speakers of the Blue and Gold in the
annual forensic medal contest is up
to record. This is encouraging. While
the interest of perhaps the majority
is centered upon the outcome of the
Cardinal athletic teams, the import
ance of supremacy in debating is not
to be underestimated.
Stanford has always held a high
place in this branch of competition,
and the report of a large number of
able speakers, two of which com
prised the winning team of last year,
ready to contest for places, augurs
well for our chance of again annex
ing this intercollegiate event. The
debators deserve support from the
Student Body, and a good attendance
at. the tryouts tomorrow evening
would be an excellent way to show
our appreciation of their efforts.
