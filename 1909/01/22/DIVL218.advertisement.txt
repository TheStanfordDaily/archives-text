THE
RED CROSS SHOE
FOR WOMEN
" IT BENDS WITH THE FOOT "
This is the only shoe with a flexible
welt sole which can be bent double
when new. This "Bending With the
Foot" eliminates ninety-five per cent

Come in and see them, bend them
and walk in them, and see what a
wonderful difference the sole makes.
