# MAY TEACH FORESTRY
## BOTANY STUDENTS WANT SCHOOL OF TECHNICAL FORESTRY. Are Now Circulating Petition Asking for More Instruction in That Subject. 
### 
There is a movement on foot, in
stituted by the Forestry Club, to have
a Forestry Department established in
the University. The club has circu
lated a petition among the students
interested in forestry work, asking for
a school of technical forestry, in
which they state that: "We desire a
knowledge of this subject on account
of its present and future importance
to the nation and to the Pacific Coast.
Practical forestry as a profession is
now opening to young men many po
sitions of usefulness, and the United
States Forestry Service needs more
trained foresterers than it can ob
tain."
There are about twenty students in
the Botany department who are tak
ing as much forestry work as is pos
sible at present in this University.
They have formed the Forestry Club,
which has been holding meetings this
year. At these gatherings several able
men have spoken to the members
concerning their branch of study.
These students all wish for more work
in forestry, but, owing to the limited
work which they can do in this Uni
versity, must take the little they can
get, and then go to some eastern uni
versity or leave their preparations un
finished. For this reason, many men
who wish to take up forestry work,
pick some eastern university, when
otherwise they would attend Stanford.
It is also urged bv the petitioners
that forestry as taupht in an eastern
institution does not give a satisfactory
training for work on this Slope. The
characters of the eastern and western
ranges are different.
The government is at present in
great need of trained foresters to care
for the public forests on the Pacific
Slope, which cover 127,000.000 acres,
an area equal to that of all the New
England States. In view of this great
demand for foresters and the impor
tance of this forest preservation, the
forestry students and member of the
faculty, believe it would raise the
standard of Stanford University, in
addition to being a great aid to tha
government.
