# WILL CONSIDER CHANGES.
## Intercollegiate Athletic Agreement Committee to Meet Tomorrow Night in San Francisco. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Athletic Agree
ment Committee, composed of three
representatives from each university,
wjll meet tomorrow night in San
Francisco to consider changes in th 3
existing agreement. It is probable
that the only matter for discussion
will be the change proposed by Stan
ford, which would prevent all Fresh
men from competing in an intercol
legiate contest who have not fifteen
entrance credits. California has pro
posed no changes, and, according to
an agreement, all proposals must be
submitted to the university at
least one week before the meeting of
the Committee. As the Executive
Committee has received no word from
California, only the one change will
be considered.
The object of the proposed amend
ment is to prevent Freshmen who
enter at Christmas with partial stand
ing from participating in the spring
events. As California admits students
on partial standing and Stanford doe?
not, the Blue and Gold is thus given
an advantage under the present sys
tem.
The following men will represent
Stanford tomorrow night: R. W.
Barrett, '04, G. J. Presley, '07, and
A. E. Roth, '09.
