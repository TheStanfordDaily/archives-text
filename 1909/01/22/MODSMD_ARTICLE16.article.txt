The announcement made recently
that the Board of Trustees has de
cided to open the Museum as soon as
possible should be welcome news to
all connected with the University.
This building, which was the center
of attraction for many visitors an J
an object of interest t'o undergradu
ates, has been inaccessible since the
eve of the earthquake, three years
ago.
With the exception of the members
of the 1909 class, none of the under
graduates of the University have had
an opportunity to view the many rel
ics and instructive collections of spec
imens which were gathered and pro
vided for by the founders of this in
stitution.
With the Museum again open to th 3
public, tourists and outsiders, who
would, perhaps, not otherwise be at
tracted to Stanford, will visit the
campus and will serve to bring the
name of Stanford University be
fore many communities. It is an
acknowledged fact that many have
come to the campus in the past
prompted by curiosity, only to return,
or send their friends, to become in
terested members of the institution
The Museum and the Church, when
completed, will be valuable assets to
Stanford.
The appointment of two assistant
yell leaders from the Junior class is
a step worthy oi' commendation, ami
the plan by which the two directors
were selected one which possesses
permanency. It has often been a
problem to fill the vacancies caused
by the graduation of yell leaders. This
has been due to the fact that 110 pro
vision had been made previously.
The two men just appointed will be
given an opportunity to become
known to the undergraduates and to
become familiar with their duties.
Next semester, when the football sea
son starts, we will have experienced
leaders.
