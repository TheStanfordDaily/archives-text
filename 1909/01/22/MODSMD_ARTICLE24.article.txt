# VALUABLE GIFT TO E.E. DEPT.
## Northern Commercial Company Donates Cable Terminal Facilities Salvages From Shipwreck. 
### 
The Electrical Engineering depart
ment is in receipt ot a valuable gift
in the shape of $3000 worth of land
cable apparatus from Trustee Leon
Sloss, acting on behalf of the North
ern Commercial Company. The goods
enclosed in eleven large cases arrived
recently and are now being unpacked.
They constitute the complete equip
ment for the terminal offices of the
standard Wheatstone automatic du
plex system of a land-line cable.
In 1900 the government purchased
the apparatus for the establishment of
a telegraph system in Alaska. While
being shipped up the Coast, the ves
sel carrying them was wrecked and
the whole cargo lost. It was only a
few months ago that the Northern
Commercial Company raised the goods
to dry land again. The government,
having been fully recompensed by in
surance in the meantime, however, be
sides adopting the wireless method of
telegraphy, refused to repurchase the
salvaged goods, hence the gift to
Stanford University. The Electrical
Engineering department will use the
apparatus for exhibition purposes at
present.
