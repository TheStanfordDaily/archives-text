# Lake Close to Overflow.
## 
### 
On account of the incessant rains
of the past few days, it was found
necessary to place a guard on the dam
at Lake Lagunita last night.
The water in the lake has been ris
ing steadily during the week. The in
rush could not be carried off rapidly
enough, and for a time it looked as
if the floodgate would have to be open
ed. Treasurer Lathrop stationed a
man to stand guard last evening be
cause of the danger arising from nu
merous gopher holes near the top of
the dam. If the water should get the
least headway, starting through one
of these holes, it would not take long
to eat away a good portion of the
dam. The water is now falling, how
ever, and it is believed all danger is
past.
