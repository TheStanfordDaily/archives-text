# EXPLAINS MOVEMENT
## REVEREND ELWOOD WORCESTER SPEAKS IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Before Largo Audience Yesterday Tells of Emmanuel Movement and Its Significance. 
### 
Despite the inclement weather, a
large crowd, which filled the entire
lower floor of Assembly Hall, heard
the message yesterday morning which
the Rev. Elwood Worcester came
across the continent to give to the
Pacific Coast. It was here that he
gave his first public utterance in the
West, and, judging from the close at
tention which was shown the speak
er, his words created a profound im
pression upon the auditors.
Owing to the shortness of time, Rev.
Worcester was unable to explain fully
the practical application of the Em
manuel Movement. He gave, how
ever, in his masterful and fascinating
manner, the essence of its nature and
the growing demand by a strenuous
society of a different attitude toward
life and religion.
He said in opening that he was
glad to speak before a college au
dience, since the Emmanuel Move
ment had started among college grad
uates. He urged every one to take
as much psychology in his university
work as possible, since, according to
the speaker, it is the coming science
of successful people, and, together
with Christian faith, is the prime ele
ment back of the Emmanuel Move
ment. Dr. Worcester said that
through his acquired knowledge of
psychology he was able to accom
plish twice as much work and work
twice as long as when he was ig
norant of the subject. "By psychol
ogy, we discover the powers within
and without the soul of man, which
exceed those that we call upon in or
dinary life."
The speaker declared that since
society in all its affairs had become
so complex and materialistic, a re
action must come about or dire con
sequences would follow. The thing
demanded is a simpler life and a sim
pler religion. "We must find a way
to pacify our lives, if we are going
to keep our sanity. We must keep
away anger and live calmer and more
peaceful lives. We must destroy fear,
man's worst enemy."
"it is the object of the Emmanuel
Movement to give a practical faith
without fear; a different moral and
mental attitude toward human con
duct. We must make a greater study
of the individual and find what has
been lost in the Christian faith. We
will find that it is the direct contact
of the human with the divine, as ex
emplified by .Tesus Christ. The Christ
like life is the panacea for all our
ills."
In closing Rev. Worcester spoke of
the necessity of guarding children
from great mental shocks and fear,
for "there is nothing more delicate
than the mind and nervous system of
the child, and nothing should be treat
ed with more care," declared the
speaker.
Rev. Elwood Worcester is an ex
ceptionally engaging speaker, whose
every word bespeaks the great mes
sage he has to deliver and the intense
earnestness he feels toward its signifi
cance.
