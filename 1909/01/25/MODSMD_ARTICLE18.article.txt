### 
No formal action was taken at, the
meeting of the Intercollegiate Athletic
Agreement Committee, which was held
in San Francisco last Saturday even
ing. The only proposition to come
up for official consideration was Stan
ford's proposal that no Freshman be
allowed to compete unless he had
full entrance standing, and, as the
California representatives showed that
no students are admitted to the Berke
ley institution who have less than lif
teen credits, the matter was dropped.
Although California had no formal
proposal to make, the Blue and Gold
representatives brought up for un
official discussion the advisability of
entering into an agreement relative to
intercollegiate basketball matches.
Such a proposition is favored by the
Californians, but, owing to the fact
that it had not been communicated to
Stanford within the stipulated time,
prior to the meeting of the Commit
tee, no official action could be taken
The Executive Committee does not at
present favor placing this sport on
the list of intercollegiate contests,
and it is very probable that nothing
