# STRONG CARNOT TEAM IS SELECTED
## D.C. Boyd, J.E. Shelton and G.F. Morgan Compose Trio that Will Contest with California's Representatives on February 5. 
### 
In a highly satisfactory tryout for
places upon the debating team that is
to represent Stanford in the coming
Carnot medal contest with the Uni
versity of California, three men and
an alternate were selected by the
judges last Friday night. Those who
successfully competed were D. C
Boyd, gr., J. E. Shelton, '10, and tÂ».
F. Morgan, '10, while N. C. Wilson, '12,
will act as the alternate and will til!
any vacancy that might occur. This
choice of a Freshman is interesting,
in view of the fact that a first-year
man has been selected to speak upon
the team that will contest for Cali
fornia. G. B. Bush,>'o9, president of
the Intersociety Committee, officiated
as the presiding officer of the even
ing.
The choice was made from a field of
ten candidates, all of whom showed
marked ability and among whom were
many surpises. Also, the facts that
two of the team that has been picked
are former Carnot debaters would
seem to assure Stanford of her sixth
victory in the list of Carnot debates.
The specific question that was
evolved from the general subject of
"France and Her Relation to Her Col
onies and Dependencies" was worded
as follows: "Resolved, That it should
be the policy of France to establish
the foundations of a self-governing
colony in Indo-China." The framing
of this pertinent topic for discussion
was in the hands of C. A. Houston
of the Law School, Professor E. D.
Adams, the head of the History de
partment, and A. L. Guerard, assist
ant professor in the Department of
Romantic Languages. The genera i
trend of the arguments offered by
the upholders of this proposition was
to the effect that the inhabitants of
this French dependency were not in
a state sufficiently civilized to be able
to grasp the problems that would de
volve upon them under a system of
self-reliance and government. In at
tempting to overbalance these conten
tions, the negative was strong in the
denunciation of the present colonial
policy of France and dwelt upon its
inability to properly foster the well
being of any colony.
The candidates received the an
nouncement of the specific question in
the Chapel at f> o'clock, and imme
diately chose the sides which they
wished to uphold. During the re
maining two hours before the debate,
the speeches were arranged and form
ulated. They were limited to fifteen
minutes and could be divided between
the main body and the rebuttal, with
the one provision that four minutes
at least must be devoted to one
speech. The order and the sides up
on which the contestants spoke fol
low: F. B. Wood, '10, F. H. Hilton,
'11, G. F. Morgan, '10, R. M. Ford
'09, and C. C. Shoemaker, '10, com
posed the team that was to uphold
the affirmative, while N. C. Wilson, '12,
R. B. Murphey, gr., T. T. Bennett, '08,
J. E. Shelton, '10, and D. C. Boyd,
gr., opposed them as the negative.
The men who fulfilled the require

ments imposed by the judges are all
well known in the debating circles of
the University, and it is assuring to
find two names prominently identified
with Carnot contests. J. E. Shelton
has acquired a reputation as a relia
ble representative in the debating
field. He has had experience as a
member of the Carnot team last year
and one of the trio who spoke in the
intercollegiate debate. Shelton was a
member of his class teams, both in
bis Freshman and his Sophomore
years. He is a member of Euphronia
Debating Society and is a Law major
from San Jose. The style of this
speaker is dominated by his appar
ent experience in the debating world,
both in regard to his stage presence
and in the method of arrangement of
his speech. His powers of refutation
are excellent, as evidenced by the
strong rebuttal given by him in his
tryout.
D. C. Boyd, the second veteran on
the team, is very closely identified
with the debating interests at Stan
lord, and has long been known for his
excellent and assiduous work along
this line. A logical sequence of prem
ises and conclusions, with a marked
ability to present his material in a
fluent style, is characteristic of
Boyd's speaking. Boyd was a mem
ber of the Carnot team of last year.
This second member of the team is
a graduate student in the Department
of Economics, and is enrolled as a
member of Nestoria Debating Society.
With the most natural command
of words of the trio and as a speaper
who puts personality into his speak
ing, Morgan deserved his place upon
the team. His advent into the debat
ing world here is recent, although ho
has been a prominent member of Nes
toria Debating Society during the past
year and has interested himself in
forensics in college. A direct method
of speaking and an adeptness at the
art of extemporaneous talking makes
his presence upon the team invalua
ble. Morgan is a member of the staff
of the Chaparral.
Wilson represented the Freshman
class upon the team that contested
with the Sophomore class last sem
ester for the under-class supremacy,
and it was then that he won recog
nition for his fluent and argumenta
tive delivery. Wilson is a member of
the Delta Tan Delta fraternity, and
registers from Oakland in the Depart
ment of Economics.
The intercollegiate contest to de
cide to whom the medal shall be
awarded will be held in the Assem
bly Hall on the evening of February
5. The committee that will confer
with the representatives from the Uni
versity of California as to the final se
lection of the question to be then
discussed are Assistant Professor C.
A. Huston from the Law School and
R. M. Alden of the Department of Eng
lish.
The team that will represent Cali
fornia is as follows: H. D. Hoover,
'09, A. R. Morgan, '09, and N. Dru
ry, '12.
