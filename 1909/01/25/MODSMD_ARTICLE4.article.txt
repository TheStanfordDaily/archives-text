# WEALTH IN FISHERIES
## CHIEF OF PHILIPPINE FISHERIES DEPARTMENT HERE. Alvin Scale, '96, Tells of Great Undeveloped Wealth in Island Possessions. 
### 
Alvin Seale, '96, Chief of the Fish
eries Department of the Philippine
Islands, arrived here recently from a
visit to Washington and New York.
He will remain several months, while
he is classifying 10,000 specimens ot"
Philippine fish for his department in
the islands.
During his tenure of office, Seale
has been discovering and developing
the sponge, coral and pearl fisheries
of the Philippines. He has found
great wealth there and tells .amazing
stories of the treasures still unde
veloped. This means that these arti
cles, which have heretofore been im
ported from foreign countries, can
now be obtained from within the do
mains of the United States. This will
give us our own supply, and, accord
ing to what has already been dis
covered, a rich surplus for export.
For the last two years he has been
conducting sponge fisheries, and last
year shipped from Singapore a total
of 30,000 sponges. These sponges
have been pronounced as good as the
Florida and Mediterranean varieties;
and while in the East Seale received
a large order from New York mer
chants for sponges.
Seale was the discoverer of the first
red coral fisheries ever found in the
Philippines. He believes this will
prove to be a very valuable fishery,
as Japan ships annually $200,000
worth of coral. The supply he has
found will exceed that of the Jap
anese. He has also discovered a
blue coral of a turquoise color, which
eastern jewelers declare will become
very popular.
At Davao, P. 1., the government has
found in three months $00,000 worth
of shell and several thousand dollars'
worth of pearl in a bay only 200 yards
across. In addition to this, which is
an entirely new ground, many new
ones are expected to be opened in the
near future.
