## 
### 
At a meeting of the Chess Club
held last Friday night, it was decided
to begin the tryouts for the Stanford
chess team at once, and continue
them until two days after the Easter
vacation. In order to gain practice,
the club has attempted to get a match
with E. Clarke of Palo Alto, who is
supposed to he one of the best play
ers on the Coast. This tournament
will be public, in order to give the
participants a chance to get over all
symptoms of stage fright., which was
the cause of last year's defeat. As
the constitution of the club allowed
for only fourteen members, an amend
ment was made, giving the club pow
er to take in as many new men as ic
sees fit this semester. This was done
in order to stimulate interest in the
tryouts.
