# LOCAL BILL FAVORED
## LAW GRADUATES MAY BE EXEMPTED FROM BAR EXES. Professor F.A. Woodward Returns from Sacramento and Reports Measure Should Pass. 
### 
At the request of the faculty of the
Law School, Senator Black has intro
duced a bill in the Legislature, pro
viding that "any person who shall
have satisfactorily completed the three
years' course of law study prescribed
by the Department of Law of LelanO
Stanford Junior University, as evi
denced by the certificate of the exec
utive head or of the secretary of the
faculty of said Department of Law,
shall be entitled to a license to prac
tice law in all the courts of this State,
without undergoing examination.
The purpose of the bill is not to
make it easier for the graduates of
the Law School to gain admission to
the bar. So far as is known, no grad
uate has failed to pass the examina
tions. The purpose is to induce the
students in the law school to com
plete their professional training be
fore entering upon the practice of
law, instead of taking the bar ex
aminations at the close of the first
or second years of study, and, if suc
cessful, of entering upon the practice
at once.
In most of the Eastern States, all
candidates for admission to the bar
are required to study law three years
and then to take a thorough written
examination, uniform throughout the
State. It is hoped that before the
Legislature meets again, a strong
movement for the adoption of such a
statute in this State may be organized.
If the movement is successful, the
faculty of the Law School will ask
that graduates of law schools, as well
as all other candidates, be required to
take the examinations. In the mean
time, it is believed that the bill now
before the Legislature will accomplish
something in the right direction by
offering to students an inducement to
remain in the Law School for three
years before undertaking to practice.
The privilege which is sought from
the Legislature is already enjoyed by
graduates of the Hastings College of
Law and the Law School of the Uni
versity of Southern California, and it
is understood that the Department of
Jurisprudence of the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley is asking that its
graduates be included in the provi
sions of the pending bill.
Professor Woodward appeared last
week before the Senate Committee on
Education to which tho bill had been
referred, and advocated its enactment.
It has since been reported favorably
to the Senate, and will probably come
up for passage in a few days.
