# SOPHOMORE CAST ACTIVE.
## Numerous Rehearsals Held and Paris Are Committed.â€”P.M. Ogilvie on Cast. 
### 
The members of the Sophomore
play east are earnestly at work study
ing and rehearsing their parts pre
paratory to the production of "7-20-8"
on the evening of February 26. Al
ready this semester Coach Mathieu
has held half a dozen rehearsals. The
members have their parts committed,
and Coach Mathieu is now drilling
them in the "business" and details of
the play.
The personnel of the cast, which
will enact the comedy stands intact,
as originally chosen from the exten
sive tryouts last semester, with the
exception of one second male part. W.
S. Porter has been obliged to give up
his part as Hollyhock, which has been
assumed by P. M. Ogilvie.
The management of this year's class
play will forego the usual advertising
program, in deference to the resolu
tion passed by the Executive Commit
tee.
