Within a short time the question of
management and control of the 1911
Quad will come before the Sophomore
class. While it is a problem which
concerns the 191! class most, it also
is of importance to the University at
large, and should be decided in a man
ner which will tend to improve the
year-book and give to collegiate pos
terity a system that is worthy of per
petuating. The first step taken toward
this end was made by the present Ju
nior class. The ultimate success of
the plan adopted by 1910 is still to
be determined.
The manner of issuing the 1910
Quad, as outlined and adopted by
this class, is beyond criticism, when
considered from the thoretical stand
point. It is an ideal system. Wheth
er conditions are favorable here to
permit of this ideal in practice will
be settled only when the 1910 edition
is off the presses and in the hands
of the buyers.
Many are skeptical—this is espe
cially true among the Sophomores—
as to the wisdom of the system by
which the position of manager is cre
ated purely as an honorary one. P
has been said that the manager should
receive sufficient compensation from
the proceeds of the book to make up
for the task of gathering the adver
tisements and otherwise directing the
edition. Those who are of this belief
further argue that the manager does
not receive the same recognition for
his services as is shown his co-work
er, the editor, and that he must re
ceive financial solace.
The solution of the question may,
or may not, lie finally reached by the
class of 1911, but if, in deciding upon
a plan by which their annual shall be
directed, close observance of the Ideal
is followed, the error can only be on
the side of safety.
We believe that the plan as pur
sued by 1910 may be too great a tran
siiton from the old system. That the

honor conferred upon the manager at
the present time is not equal to that
of the editor's, and until it is he
should he provided for otherwise.
What should be strived for is to
make the honor as great for the man
ager as is consistent, and in this way
make the necessity of financial com
pensation correspondingly small. This
will lead to the ideal. To reach this
goal and gradually better the Stan
ford Quads, consideration should be
shown to the powerful hold that prec
edent has upon the community.
Hasty decisions are seldom sound
ones. 1911 should see to the appoint
ment of an unbiased and clear-think
ing committee, empowered to confer
and draw up an outline of a feasible
plan. The sooner this is done, the
blighter are the prospects for a last
ing decision.
