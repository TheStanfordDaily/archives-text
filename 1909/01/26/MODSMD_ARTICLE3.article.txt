# FRESHMEN RECEIVE CHALLENGE.
## First-Year Debaters at California Desire Contest with Local Representatives. 
### 
A challenge has been forwarded by
the debaters of the Freshman class of
the University of California to M. E.
Grimes, president of the Freshmen
here, in which a forensic contest be
tween the classes was asked for. This
action was referred to the commit
tees governing intercollegiate debat
ing, who advised that the challenge
be refused. In counselling an answer
of this character, those in charge of
debating interests followed the prec
edents established during the past
three years. During this time similar
challenges have been forwarded to
the first-year classes here and have
always been refused. If any further
advice is sought, the matter will be
laid before the Executive Committee,
but in all probability the challenge
will be refused by the Freshmen.
