# MEETS ARE ARRANGED
## TRACK SCHEDULE IS COMPLETED BY MANAGER STEWART. Five Preliminary Contests for Cardinal Teams.—Baseball Season Tickets on Sale Tomorrow. 
### 
The return of Track Captain Mor
ton has enabled Manager Stewart to
complete the schedule of track events
for this spring. Two contests with
the University of Southern California
and one with the Olympic Club of San
Francisco constitute the preliminary
meets for the varsity team, while the
Freshmen will probably be pitted
against the St. Mary's team in two
meets prior to the intercollegiate
Freshman contest. The dates for
these meets have not yet been fixed,
but they will probably occur early in
March.
The following is the schedule as
prepared by Manager Stewart:
March 13 —Varsity vs. University of
Southern California, at Los Angeles.
March 20—Varsity vs. Olympic Club,
on the campus.
March 27, morning—Varsity vs.
University of Southern California on
the campus. Afternoon—lntercolle
giate Freshman meet, on the campus.
April 17 —Intercollegiate Track
meet, California Field.
As announced last week, the season
tickets for the series of baseball
games will be on sale at the Rook
store tomorrow. The tickets will be
sold for $2.50, and will admit to all
games except the intercollegiate se
ries. A condition by which the re
duced rate is granted is that the tick
ets are strictly non-transferable.
