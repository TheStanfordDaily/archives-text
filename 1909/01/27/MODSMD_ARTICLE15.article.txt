# No Season Tickets Are Sold.
## 
### 
Yesterday morning the season tick
ets for baseball were placed on sale
at the Book Store. All day yesterday
and until a late hour this afternoon
not a single ticket had been sold.
Manager Stewart is at a loss to ac
count for the failure of the tickets
to sell, but expects interest has not
yet been aroused in athletics, due to
the recent wet weather.
