### 
More than the usHal amount of
business was transacted at the Fresh
man class meeting held this after
noon at 1:10 in room 214.
The most important matter of the
meeting was the vote taken by the
class not to accept the challenge of
the Freshman class of the University
of California to an intercollegiate
Freshman debate. This action was
carried through in view of the prece
dents of former years. The class sec
retary was Instructed to write the Cal
ifornia secretary of the decision.
It was found by the treasurer's re
port that the class has a very small
balance in the liank of Palo Alto. An
auditing committee of three will be
appointed to examine the books
Chairman Grimes of the committee
appointed to order pins for the Fresh
man debating team, reported that the
pins will arrive next week from
Shreve & Co. of San Francisco. The
total cost is $18.
The class secretary and treasurer
were authorized to purchase books to
preserve the minutes of the class
meetings and the class accounts.
