# DESIGN FOR CHURCH IS SUBMITTED
## Plans Considered by Trustees Eliminate Famous Chimes and Clock and Substitute Statues.â€”Alumni Object. 
### 
The Memorial Church, built by Mrs.
Stanford in memory of her husband,
completed just ;i short time prior to
the earthquake, is now practically
leveled, and in planning to recon
struct the building, the Hoard of Trus-

tees has considered a design sub
mited by well-known San Francisco
architects.
The outlines of the new Church will
be much the same as formerly, as far
as the building proper is considered
It will be built of the same buff sand
stone. but will be reinforced through
out by steel and concrete. Other in
novations in construction will be
made, and the so-called "flying but
tresses" omitted.
The report of the engineers and
architects, who viewed the wreck pre
paratory to the razing of the build
ing, advocated the rebuilding along
the old lines. This was especially
true in the reconstruction of the tow
er. In the design submitted, the base
of the tower is similar, but in the

upper finishing the difference is
marked. In fact, the digression front
lhe old outlines has called forth se
vere comment already from promi
nent members of the Alumni. Accord
ing to the plans, the famous chimes,

which formerly marked the hours,
half-hours and quarters, together
with the four-faced clock, will be
I omitted.
It is not known why this step has
| been taken. The place of the clock
| will be filled, according to the design,
! by a set of white images, placed in
niches around the top and surmounted
Iby a row of small windows. The apex
I of the tower will be surmounted by a
| cross.
I Just when the contract for the
church will be let and when the
present site will be cleared sufficient
ly to proceed with the rebuilding, is
not known at this time, but it is ex
pected considerable will be accom
plished before the end of the present
semester.
