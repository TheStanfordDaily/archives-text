# SOPHOMORES DISCUSS "QUAD."
## Committee Appointed with Instructions to Plan Ways of Compensating Manager and Editor. 
### 
A meeting of the Sophomore class
was called by President F. H. Hilton
today for the primary purpose of dis
cussing the plans upon which the
Quad of that class should be pub
lished. The meeting was marked by
several interesting speeches upon this
subject, which revealed the fact that
there was a difference of opinion as
to whether both the manager and the
editor should receive remuneration. It
was generally conceded by those who
\oiced their ideas and plans for the
editing of the book that the manager
should be compensated in some way,
although no expression of the meth
od by which this should be accom
plished was formally advanced.
As a result of the discussion, a com
mittee of five was appointed by Pres

ident Hilton, whose purpose is to in
vestigate the most suitable plans for
compensating the manager and editor
of the Quad. This committee is com
posed of R. J. Miller, chairman; G.
A. Ditz, K. Chamberlain, J. A. Visel
and W. U. Fletcher. The findings of
this body will be presented to the
Sophomore class in a week, when the
next meeting will be held.
The class decided to levy an assess
ment of fifty cents to cover the nec
essary expenses of both the Play Com
mitter! and to pay for the debating
pins that were ordered for the mem
bers of the Sophomore team. The au
diting Committee reported that, the
books were reviewed and that a bal
ance of $14.58 was on hand. In view
of the fact that the present Sopho
more class is the only one that has
ever realized upon the Sophomore
Cotillion, a vote of thanks was voted
to the dance committee for its man
agement.
