# BRYCE WILL LECTURE
## ENGLISH AMBASSADOR TO VISIT STANFORD. Accepts Invitation of Dr. Jordan to Speak at University Assembly Some Time in March. 
### 
That the Right Honorable James
Bryce, English Ambassador to the
United States, is to visit Stanford is
now an assured fact, as be has prom
ised Dr. Jordan to accept bis invita
tion to spend a day 011 the campus.
The Ambassador is to come to the
Coast during the latter part of March,
when be will give an address on the
Charter Day at the University of Cal
ifornia. He has also been secured
to give a course of lectures there,
and it is probably during bis stay
at Berkeley that he will arrange to
visit Stanford. Dr. Jordan has said
that no matter what time he gets
here, an Assembly will be called to
have him speak.
Bryce is well known to the Amer
ican public as the author of "The
American Commonwealth," which is
considered as one of the best author
ities on the American and British gov
ernments, one scholar going so far
as to say that he knows of no single
study that so effectually helps the
American to know his own country
as this volume. He is often called
our greatest critic, and also one of
our greatest admirers. It is an in
treesting fact that he is entitled to
write more letters after his name than
any man in the recent Ministry, he
hnving some six degrees.
