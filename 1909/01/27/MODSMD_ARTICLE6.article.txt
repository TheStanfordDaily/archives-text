# WEATHER PERMITS PRACTICE,
## Baseball Men Out Yesterday.â€”First Game Saturday with St. aMry's College. 
### 
Owing to the inclement weather
that has prevailed this month, yes
terday was the first afternoon for two
weeks that the varsity baseball team
has been able to practice. The first
same of the season is scheduled to
take place next Saturday afternoon
with the St. Mary's team, and, barring
rain, this game will be played accord
ing to schedule. As the weather gives
promise of being fair for the next
few days, the varsity will have an
opportunity to round into form for the
contest.
The new uniforms for the nine,
which were ordered some time ago,
are expected to arrive in time for
Saturday's game. The new suits are
made of white flannel, trimmed with
maroon. The stockings and sleeves
of the jersey are of this color, as is
the coat, which is in turn trimmed
with white cuffs and buttons. The
contrast of colors and the style of
the suits make them the most pleas
ing and effective uniforms ever worn
by a Stanford nine. The many trips
which the team makes to outside
points amply justified llie expenditure
in the eyes of the Executive Commit
tee, and accordingly the uniforms
were ordered.
