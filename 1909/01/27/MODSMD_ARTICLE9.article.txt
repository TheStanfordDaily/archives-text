In another portion of this issue
will be found a reproduction of the
design submitted for the reconstruc
tion of the Memorial Church. The
plans have already called forth con
siderable comment from prominent
alumni, and The Alumnus in a recent
number makes the following com
ment, referring to a published photo
graph of the design:
' This is the design which has been
submitted to the trustees for the re
construction of the Memorial Church.
It. will arouse vigorous protest, sure
ly, from all Stanford people to whom
the clock and chimes became a vital
part of campus life and sentiment.
For these features, this design sub
stitutes more of those white figures
against a background of yellow sand
stone, which to many eyes are liko
the 'Ghastly Greeks' on the Museum.
Space for only a few small windows
is thus left at the top of the tower.
This change must be based entirely
upon esthetic considerations, since the
commission of architects and engi
neers recommended the reconstruction
of the tower upon its original lines,
with the addition of a steel frame.
Whether these features are more in
harmony with the architectural
scheme of the quadrangles than are
the lines of Richardson's Trinity
Church may be debatable, but there
should be no uncertainty as to the
necessity for the clock and its quar
ter-hourly music."
We agree heartily with The Alum
nus in wishing for the restoration
of the tower with the old chimes and
clock. Of the Student Body, only the
members of the 1909 class have had
an opportunity to appreciate their
loss. We cannot understand why the
clock and chimes are to be omitted.
If the architects could not agree to
return the clock to its former posi
tion, it does not seem that it would be
out of place to have the chimes in
stalled at least. We hope, when tlie
church is rebuilt, the present plans

will be modified to this extent. Alum
ni members are better able to ad
vance this idea with effect than un
dergraduates, and we extend them our
support and co-operation.
