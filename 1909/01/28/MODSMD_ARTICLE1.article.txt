# DISPUTE OVER SHELL
## CALIFORNIA CLAIMS CRAFT DESIRED BY STANFORD. Executive Committee Decided to Toss Coin to Decide Ownership of Cornell Boat. 
### 
The Executive Committee last night
disposed of an odd situation in a nov
el manner. It was decided to flip a
coin with the University of California
to determine which institution shall
have the choice of two crew shells
that Cornell is anxious to sell.
The situation has arisen out of the
efforts of both Coast universities to
purchase new boats to be used in the
aquatic contests this spring. In the
course of his investigations, Manager
Stewart learned that Cornell Univer
sity was seeking a purchaser for two
shells in her possession, one of which
had not been used and the other hav
ing been manned by the Eastern oars
men on only a few occasions. Six
hundred dollars was the price placed
upon the former, while four hundred
dollars was asked for the latter.
After having been advised of the
above terms and the adaptibility of
the Cornell boats for the local crew
work, Stewart notified California of
the negotiations and requested a Cali
fornia representative, then traveling
in the East, to visit Cornell and ex
amine the shells on behalf of Stanford.
The Californian complied with the re
quest, and was so well pleased with
the newer shell that the California
management now wants to buy it on
the basis of the visit. In view of these
facts, Stanford proposes to flip a coin
for the choice of the two shells, or to
demand the newer boat, basing her
claim upon prior negotiations for the
purchase of the boat. Both shells
have already been shipped and the
manner of determining which Univer
sity shall have the option of choosing
one of them now rests with the Blue
and Cold management.
After considerable discussion, Man
ager Stewart was authorized to make
investigations looking to the estab
lishment of a permanent trophy room.
Inasmuch as an early reopening of the
Museum is now an assured fact, it has
been suggested that certain cases in
the Museum be set aside as a repos
itory for trophies. The want of a tro
phy room, such as other universities
have, has long been felt here, and the
action of the Executive Committee
comes in response to this necessity.
Due to unfavorable weather, the re
cent series of football games willi
Vancouver was not as great a finan
cial success as had been anticipated,
the Northern team suffering a net loss
of $500. In view of this unavoidable
pecuniary loss, the Executive Commit
tee voted to refund the sum of $250 to
the management of the Vancouver fif
teen.
It.was decided to send a team com
posed of eight or less men to the
Olympic Club indoor track meet, to
be held some time next month.
