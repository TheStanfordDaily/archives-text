It is encouraging to note that the
Executive Committee lias taken a defi
nite step toward a Trophy Room t'or
Stanford. A trophy room is badly
needed, and the representatives of the
Student Body, in taking recognizance
of the fact, reflect the thoughts of
many, as expressed recently in meet
ings of the more important undergrad
uate organizations. We all want to
see a room fitted up for the items
which mark the glories of the Car
dinal. We want to see it this sem
ester.
A place for trophies anywhere on
the campus is far better than none
at all. Without wishing to place any
damper upon the project as launched
by the Executive Committee, we sug
gest that some more convenient place
should be selected than the Museum.
True, the first requirement for a tro
phy room is that it should be a place
where the cups, banners and memen
toes of games and contests can be
kept safely. It has another function,
however, fully as important. Trophy
rooms at other universities are so lo
cated as to he the gathering-place of
graduates, undergraduates and visit
ors upon the day of some big campus
contest. That is what our Trophy
Room should be as well as a suitable
storage apartment. Inaccessibility
can more than offset other advan
tages.
AVe suggest, not the isolated Muse
um—which is to be open but twice a
week—but the small reception cham
ber in Encina Hall, now used for a
meeting place of the Executive Com
mittee. This Trophy Room could be
guarded both at night and during the
day without additional expense to the
Business Oflice or the Student Body.
It would seem to us, that it possesses
all the points which favor the Muse
um, and, in addition, has advantages
which could never be hoped for that
location.
Perhaps the argument will be
raised that an Encina room would not

be a common ground for Row and
Hall men, and that it is not accessi-
ble to visitors. Any who are familiar
with the situation would not place
weight on the latter, and those who
entertain the first idea do not fully
comprehend what true Stanford Spirit
means. There have been times in
the past when the Student Body was
not a solid unit as at the present
time. Bitter feeling existed and fac
tions warred with one another. A Tro
phy Room in Encina would serve as
an admirable excuse for any who
might entertain this false notion to
pay frequent visits to such a display
of Stanford trophies and learn their
error.
Reiterating our statement that it
is in no spirit of hampering we make
our suggestions, we commend the Ex
ecutive Committee upon the business
like manner with which they are pro
ceeding, and feel sure whatever choice
is ultimately made, il will be a sensi
ble and unbiased one, which will be
for the best interests of Stanford.
