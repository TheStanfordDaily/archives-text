# BASEBALL MEN MAKE HEADWAY.
## Two Practice Games Played.-Varsity Develops Team Work St. Mary's Game. 
### 
Baseball work yesterday afternoon
consisted of two practice games, .Ju
niors vs. Freshmen, on the Faculty
diamond, and the Varsity vs. the Soph
omores on the old varsity field. All
men on the squads in both games had
ample chances for fielding and bat
ting. The Varsity showed evidence
of getting into shape for good team
work in the opening game with St.
Mary's, the veterans especially prov
ing that they were developing their
old form. The Freshmen succeeded
in defeating the Juniors by a good
margin, and many new men displayed
promising ability.
Now that the weather continues to
be fair, it is expected that much head
way will be made by the men, owing
to the advantage of regular practice.
