# Urge Prompt Payment of Assessments
## 
### 
Only three days remain before' the
expiration of the time in which Quad
assessments for the 1910 annual are
payable; and the management an
nounces that in order to publish the
book on time, it is absolutely essen
tial that all pictures and assessments
be handed in before February 1. They
urge that every member of the Ju
nior class make it his duty to aid in
the publication of the book, to the
extent of having his or her picture
ready before the above date, as well
as to aid it financially by the prompt
payment of the assessment.
The last date on which organiza
tion pictures may be handed in is
February 15, but the clubs are re
quested to hand them in before this
time, if possible.
