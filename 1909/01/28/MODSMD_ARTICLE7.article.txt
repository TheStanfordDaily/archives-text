# TO EDIT LAW REPORTS
## PROFESSOR HUBERICH HONORED BY EASTERN PUBLISHERS. Will Act with Famous Jurists as Associate Editor of Legal Encyclopedias. 
### 
An honor of great significance has
been conferred upon one of the fac
ulty in the Law School by an eastern
firm of publishers. Professor C. H.
Huberich has been asked by the Ed
ward Thompson Law Book Publishing
Company to act as a consulting edi
tor upon one of the most important
legal publications of its kind that has
ever been issued.
The edition in question is a new
encyclopedia of law, to be known as
the "American and English Encyclo
pedia of Law and Practice," and not
only covers the two publications of
this nature that have been edited by
this company in the past, both upon
Law and Practice, but will include
many new subjects of recent impor
tance. Sixty quarto volumes will be
issued by the publishing house, and it
is their estimate that the set will not
be completed for about ten years, so
great is the magnitude of the work.
The first result of this interesting ad
dition to the legal literature will be the
issuance of the first volume of the set
upon February 1.
Professor Huberich, by his recent
appointment, has become associated
with the most eminent legal authori
ties upon this continent, who are also
included in the list of editors writing
for this publication. Among his col
leagues upon this board are found Sir
J. A. Boyd, Chief Justice of the Prov
ince of Ontario, Canada: Chief Justice
R. Tashereau of the Province of Que
bec: Dean Lewis of the University of
Pennsylvania, Dean Kirchwey of the
Columbia Law School, and Dean
Hutchins, at the head of the Michigan
Law School.
