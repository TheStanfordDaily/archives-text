# PICKS MEN FOR GAME
## COACH PRESLEY SELECTS PLAYERS FOR WALLABIES MATCH. Woodward of Vancouver Writes That Australians are "Bunch of Husky Giants." 
### 
The men who are to face the Wal
labies in the contest on Stanford Field
cn February 10 again indulged in light
practice last night, under the direc
tion'of Coach Presley. The training
which ihe men are to undergo in prep
aration for the game will not bo
arduous, but will consist for the mosi
part in punting, dribbling, passing the
ball and other light exercises calcu
lated to limber the players up. The
men are all in first-class condition,
and for that reason the hard gruel
ling work which characterizes the fall
season will be omitted.
Coach Presley has not announced
Ihe personnel of the team as yet, but
it is probable that the places will be
tilled almost entirely by the men who
composed the varsity fifteen this year.
The following men have been called
out for practice, and from their num
ber the team will be chosen: For
wards, McGregor, Terrill, Dole, Craw
ford, Minturn, Cheda, Thorpe and Mil
ler; half, Elliott and Scott; fives,
Ganong, Mitchell; three-quarters, Hol
man, Roth, Cook; full, F. Brown and
E. Brown.
Of the above men who were not
members of this year's Varsity.
Thorpe and Minturn played on last
year's winning fifteen, and F. Brown
was the star of last season's Fresh
man aggregation and substituted for
Cadwalader at full in the intercolle
giate game.
From letters and clippings received
by Manager Stewart, something has
been learned of the ability of the Wal
labies. "Reggie" Woodward?the man
ager of the Vancouver team, writes
that we should expect to see "a husky
bunch of giants stalking around the
campus," and this seems to be the
general opinion of all the experts.
Woodward writes that great interest
is being manifested in Vancouver in
the coming of the Australian team,
and that the Northern players are
now training for the contest. Wood
ward says that "until within the last
few days it has been so cold that the
field could not be used except for
skating, but, owing to a change in the
weather, the men are now practicing
daily." After the game here on Feb
ruary 10, the Wallabies will leave for
the North, at which- time the Vancou
ver team will meet the Australians.
