We have received a communication
in the shape of a personal letter from
a graduate of this University, who was
well known and whose judgment as
an undergraduate upon Student Body
affairs was highly esteemed. He tells
a story regarding the experience of
a Freshman. We have hesitated to
publish his ideas, lest they he mis
construed and our own position upon
certain phases of college life misin
terpreted.
In publishing extracts from the
communication, we want it clearly un
derstood that we do not discounte
nance hazing— rather we approve of
it —as conducted at Stanford. What
we do not tolerate is behavior such
as described, and believe, providing
our correspondent's information was
correct, that it was the act of misin
formed undergraduates, who missed
their share of disciplining as Fresh
men. For the benefit of any of the
present Freshman class who have not
been inculcated with the correct ideas,
and in view of the other thoughts ad
vanced by the writer, in whose judg
ment we have confidence, we reprint
as follows:
"I heard a rather unpleasant story
a few days ago that I want to call
to your attention. The story comes to
me through the father of the boy in
volved —not as a complaint, but mere
ly mentioned in casual conversation
as an incident.
"The boy is a Freshman, having
entered only at the beginning of the
present term. In telling his father
of his first experiences, he said that
lie had been somewhat roughly han
dled during college hours —I inferred
while walking somewhere about the
grounds. In meeting a bunch of fel
lows, he was seized roughly, his hat
knocked off, etc. He was then chucked
along to another bunch immediately
following the first. The boy thought
that he, being a Freshman, 'everything
goes,' went along his way.
"Now, I don't mind a little hazing

in the dormitories. Tubbing or shoe- |
shining doesn't do most boys any
harm, even if it does not do them any
good. They know (hey are being
hazed; that it is a recognized cus
tom, and they take it in good part.
Put this case i cite to you was not
hazing. It amounted to nothing more
than bullying. To my mind, it is a
very bad state of affairs when even
a Freshman can't go around the
campus and attend to his work dur
ing working hours without having to
fear that any bunch of fellows he
meets may put some indignity on him.
That has not been Stanford in the
past, and 1 felt rather badly that I
had to explain to the boy's father that
this was unusual. If there is any
tendency to interfere with a Fresh
men's personal liberty or to inflict in
dignities on him, except as a regular
hazing stunt, it ought to be repressed
right at the start.
"I wish to emphasize that the boy
has made no complaint; he thinks
that is the regular thing. Neither has
his father, who thinks that the boy
can take care of himself, and a few
extra knocks won't hurt him anyway.
This is simply my personal protest
against what I consider plain lmlly
ing, if the facts as they come to me
are correct."

his father, who thinks that the boy
can take care of himself, and a few
extra knocks won't hurt him anyway.

are correct."
We have received a communication
in the shape of a personal letter from
a graduate of this University, who was
well known and whose judgment as
an undergraduate upon Student Body
affairs was highly esteemed. He tells
a story regarding the experience of
a Freshman. We have hesitated to
publish his ideas, lest they he mis
construed and our own position upon
certain phases of college life misin
terpreted.
In publishing extracts from the
communication, we want it clearly un
derstood that we do not discounte
nance hazing— rather we approve of
it —as conducted at Stanford. What
we do not tolerate is behavior such
as described, and believe, providing
our correspondent's information was
correct, that it was the act of misin
formed undergraduates, who missed
their share of disciplining as Fresh
men. For the benefit of any of the
present Freshman class who have not
been inculcated with the correct ideas,
and in view of the other thoughts ad
vanced by the writer, in whose judg
ment we have confidence, we reprint
as follows:
"I heard a rather unpleasant story
a few days ago that I want to call
to your attention. The story comes to
me through the father of the boy in
volved —not as a complaint, but mere
ly mentioned in casual conversation
as an incident.
"The boy is a Freshman, having
entered only at the beginning of the
present term. In telling his father
of his first experiences, he said that
lie had been somewhat roughly han
dled during college hours —I inferred
while walking somewhere about the
grounds. In meeting a bunch of fel
lows, he was seized roughly, his hat
knocked off, etc. He was then chucked
along to another bunch immediately
following the first. The boy thought
that he, being a Freshman, 'everything
goes,' went along his way.
"Now, I don't mind a little hazing

in the dormitories. Tubbing or shoe- |
shining doesn't do most boys any
harm, even if it does not do them any
good. They know (hey are being
hazed; that it is a recognized cus
tom, and they take it in good part.
Put this case i cite to you was not
hazing. It amounted to nothing more
than bullying. To my mind, it is a
very bad state of affairs when even
a Freshman can't go around the
campus and attend to his work dur
ing working hours without having to
fear that any bunch of fellows he
meets may put some indignity on him.
That has not been Stanford in the
past, and 1 felt rather badly that I
had to explain to the boy's father that
this was unusual. If there is any
tendency to interfere with a Fresh
men's personal liberty or to inflict in
dignities on him, except as a regular
hazing stunt, it ought to be repressed
right at the start.
"I wish to emphasize that the boy
has made no complaint; he thinks
that is the regular thing. Neither has
his father, who thinks that the boy
can take care of himself, and a few
extra knocks won't hurt him anyway.
This is simply my personal protest
against what I consider plain lmlly
ing, if the facts as they come to me
are correct."
