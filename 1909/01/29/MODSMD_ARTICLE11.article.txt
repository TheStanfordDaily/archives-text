# CHAPPIE'S SPECIAL NUMBER.
## Issue in Commemoration of Larrey Bowman Appears .Monday.â€”Noted Graduates Contribute. 
### 
The issue of the Chaparral which is
to appear Monday morning is excit
ing a great deal of interest among the
Alumni, on account of the men com
posing the editorial staff and the man
whom, the issue is to be a memorial of.
Larrey MacF. Bowman entered
Stanford in 1897, from Delphi, Ind.,
and took up liis studies in the Eng
lish department.
His work showed his genius, and
in a short time he was put on the
staff of the Sequoia, but it was from
another source that he is most lov
ingly remembered by Stanford grad
uates and students.
In 1899, liowman, in collaboration
with Bristow Adams, founded the
Chaparral. For a time the two did
all their own writing and illustrating,
but as its popularity increased, Chap
pie grew until it has reached its now
prosperous condition.
Due to overexertion on the track
team, Bowman's health failed toward
the close of his college career, and
soon after graduating lie went to Ari
zona. where he spent most of his time,
until his death in 1908.
The purpose of the Memorial Num
ber was to collect the best of Lar
rey's writing and drawings and pub
lish them, along with some Reminis
cences and Tributes from the pens of
Bowman's now famous friends.
