# DR. JORDAN IS HONORED
## ASKEW TO BE A MEMBER OF THE FUR SEAL BOARD. Naturalists Will Act Only in an Advisory Capacity with President as Chairman. 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan has been
asked to serve as chairman on an
Advisory Fur Seal Board by Secretary
Strauss of the Department of Com
merce and Labor. While he has not
received his official appointment, the
news has been received from Wash
ington that the appointment has been
made. Men likely to serve on this
board are: Dr. David Starr Jordan,
chairman; Dr. Leonard Steinegar,
Smithsonian Institute, Washington,
Mr. Hail Merriam of the Biological
Survey; Hon. Edwin W. Sims, solicitor
for the Department of Commerce and
Labor; Mr. Frederic A. Lucas, Direc
tor of the Museum of Brooklyn In
stitute, and Mr. Charles H. Townsend,
Director of the New York Aquarium.
The first Fur Seal Commission was
appointed by President Cleveland, in
1896, to make an inquiry into the con
dition and needs of the fur seal herds
of the North Pacific Ocean and the
Bering Sea. The appointment of the
commission was brought about by the
outgrowth of the belief on the part
of the United States that the regula
tions formulated by the Paris Tribu
nal of Arbitration for the protection
and preservation of the fur seal had
failed to accomplish their object.
Great Britain agreed to the proposal
of a scientific investigation of the
whole subject, to be made separately
by each nation and the results of these
investigations were to form the basis
of a reconsideration of the regula
tions at the end of the specified trial
period of five years.
President Cleveland appointed Dr.
Jordan as commissioner in charge of
the investigation, and with him were
detailed as associates Lieut.-Comman
der J. F. Moser, commanding the
United States Fish Commission steam
er Albatross; Dr. L. Stejneger, F. A.
Lucas, C. H. Townsend, G. A. Clark
and Col J. Murray.
The Commission spent the summer
of 1896 and a portion of 1897 on St.
George and St. Paul Islands of the
Pribilof group, collecting data for
their report, which was finished in
IS9B. The report covered the pres
ent condition of the seal herd, the
causes that threaten its extermination,
benefits of the acts which were passed,
based on the award by the Paris Trib
unal of Arbitration, and, lastly,
changes that are required to insure
the preservation of the seal herd.
The report has since been published
in four volumes, consisting of about
2000 pages. The report is the most
comprehensive work ever published
on the subject.
The new board will not actively in
vestigate the conditions in Bering Sea,
but will act in an advisory capacity.
Naturalists, working under its direc
tions, will visit the islands from time
to time to secure data.
