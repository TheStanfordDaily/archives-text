# FIRST GAME TOMORROW
## VARSITY MEETS ST. MARY'S ON DIAMOND AT Initial Contest Should Be Brisk. Thile, Smith and Tallant Will Occupy Box. 
### 
The first game of the baseball sea
son will be played on the old diamond
tomorrow afternoon, when the Varsity
will cross bats with the team repre
senting St. Mary's College of Oakland.
The contest will be called promptly
ai 3:30, and the regular 25-cent admis
sion will be charged.
While the line-up of the collegians
has not been announced, the aggre
gation will doubtless be a strong one.
For many years the name St. Mary's;
has been synonymous with champion
ship baseball, and the Catholic team
has always included in its line-up
some of the strongest amateur play
ers in this region. However, due to
the adoption of more stringent eligi
bility rules by the athletic manage
ment of the Oakland institution, St.
Mary's will probably be a less for
midable opponent this year than at
times in the past. Krause, the phe
nomenal pitcher, is not a member of
the St. Mary's nine this season, but
Wilcox and Hart, who are expected
to do the slab work tomorrow, are
both effective pitchers.
Varsity practice has been greatly
interfered with by continual rains
s-ince the opening of the season, but
by hard work during the last three
days, the men have rounded into fair
condition. The fact that eight of the
men who will wear a Cardinal uni
form in tomorrow's game are veter
ans is in itself a marked advantage
and augurs well for the future.
Aside from the veterans, four mem
bers of former varsity squads will ap
pear against St. Mary's, and Freshman
Canterbury will probably alternate
with Mitchell behind the bat. Sub
stitutes will be freely used, especial
ly in the outfield.
Theile, Smith and Tallant are
scheduled to do the twirling for Stan
ford.
The new Varsity uniforms will be
worn for the first time tomorrow af
ternoon. The Stanford line-up fol
lows: Theile, Smith, Tallant, pitch
ers; Mitchell, Canterbury, catchers;
Bell, first base; Cadwalader, second
base; Scott, third base; Sampson,
shortstop; Tallant, Ganong, Ball. Sco
field, McGregor, outfield.
