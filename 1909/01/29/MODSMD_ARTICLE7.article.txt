## WORK OF TRACK SQUAD FOR WEEK IS ENCOURAGING. Dad Moulton Busy Coaching Men in Field Events.â€”Good Marks Made with Weights 
### 
The track season is now fairly un
der way, and every afternoon sees the
field and track crowded with aspirants
for class and varsity places.
So far. the work that has been done
consists mainly in breaking the men
of peculiar habits and in developing
men for the field events. Starts are
being continually practiced under the
supervision of the older men.
A great deal of time is being spent
on the field events, particularly on
tne pole vault and high jump. War
ing, '11, and L. Scott, '10, have been
vaulting consistently around 11 feet,
while several Freshmen have shown
marked ability in the high jump. Dad
Moulton is devoting most of his time
to the Freshmen, of whom there are
quite a number out for the 1912 team.
In H. Sepulveda, Alameda High
School, and T. Coleman, Los Angeles
High School, the Freshmen have good
material for the sprints, as both of
these men have excellent prep school
records. There are several good
Freshmen half-milers trying out, and
Wooley, Santa Rosa High School, is
showing good form in the weight
events. Thus far he has put the shot
about 38 feet and thrown the hammer
136 feet.
D. P. Crawford, '09, winner of the
hammer throw at the conference meet
in Chicago last spring, has been
throwing the hammer 141 feet 6 in
ches and putting the shot 42 feet 1
inch. M. P. Youker, '10, best effort
with the hammer has been 135 feet.
A broad jumper of ability is lacking
for the varsity, and one must be de
veloped before the big meet.
