# SINCLAIR PLAYS PRODUCED.
## Three Dramas Lack Strength, and Author Decides to Rewrite the Lines. 
### 
Upton Sinclair, noted Socialist writ
er, did not prove such a success as a
playwright as author of readable
books, llis three one-act plays pro
duced Friday night at the Playhouse
in Palo Alto, lroxn a dramatic point
of view, were failures, with but
a single exception. The production
entitled "The Second-Story Man" was
the only one which had dramatic mer
it. "John D." was talky and too long,
and, like the "Indignant Subscriber,"
needed the addition of action and the
relief of more humor.
The dramas were listened to from
the first word to the last by a full
house, but with the generally voiced
opinion that the speeches were too
long for the amount of stage "busi
ness." The author, it is learned, has
decided to reconstruct the first and
last plays before leaving Palo Alto.
The reception accorded the dramas in
San Francisco was enthusiastic from
the viewpoint of the thoughts ex
pressed.
A striking feature of the perform
ance of Friday night was a curtain
speech by Sinclair in which be told of
his investigations of the conditions as
they exist in the Chicago packing
houses.
