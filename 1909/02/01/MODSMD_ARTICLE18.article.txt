### 
Taking the same text which he used
in his last sermon in the Chapel, "And
now abideth faith, hope and love, these
three; but the greatest of these is
love," the Rev. D. Charles Gardner
preached a strong sermon on "Hope"
yesterday morning. Dr. Gardner point
ed out especially the value of hope
in the conduct of our every-day life
and how it was the genius of all hu
manitarian movements. The chaplain
said in part:
"The life of faith is a life of hope.
We have as natural a capacity of hope
as for faith. The Christian hope,
rather than being a hazy thing, an im
pulse or a sentiment, is rather a habit
of the mind, a moving principle of life.
Christ was the living example of what
we may become through hope.
"The most desperate fear that we
have, namely, that there is no order
or rational plan in humanity, is ab
solved by a life of hope. The man who
has hope does not idly watch the
sweep of changing events or is not
acquiescent to the social wrongs of
the day. The work of the world is
being done by men and women who
have hope, who have faith in the des
tiny of mankind. The reformers of
today are teaching the gospel of clean
liness, sobriety, faith and hope. The
Church is true to her function as long
as she identifies herself with the prob
lems of humanity."
