# PLAY INTERCLASS SINGLES.
## H. Mann Wins Junior Class Championship. —Committee Urges Haste in Completion of Matches. 
### 
The bad weather last Saturday pre
vented the completion of the interclass
singles tennis tournament. A few
games were completed during the
week. H. Mann has won the cham
pionship of the Junior class, defeat
ing L. B. Mackey by a score of 4—6,
7—5, 6—2.
In the Sophomore class W. H. Mc-
Connell won from A. L. Jacobi in a
hard-fought, three-set match. The
score was 6—2, 6—B, S—6. Though
both men were out of practice, Mc-
Connell made some good ground
strokes, which proved too much for
Jacobi.
For the Freshman class, W. E. Fer
guson defeated S. C. Kennedy in a
three-set match, 6—3, » —7, 7—5, in
which there was little choice between
the two opponents. Ferguson has
many strokes, and though Kennedy
served in good style, his returns were
not accurate.
Several matches are still to be
played, and the contestants are urged
to arrange them as soon as possible.
Counts will be assigned by H. Mann,
'10, 102 Encina, for any time during
the week, and as continuous fair
weather is improbable, the committee
requests the players to hold their
matches as soon as possible. The
matches are: Seniors, E. Jordan vs.
A J. Gowan; R. A. Gott vs. F. A.
Parton. Sophomores, final: W. H. Mc-
Connell vs. R. Steinberger. Freshmen,
H. S. Morgan vs. W. E. Ferguson, the
winner of which plays winner of W. F.
Geary vs. W. R. Domaschenz in the
finals.
