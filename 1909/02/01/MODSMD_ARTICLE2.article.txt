Following is a comment upon Miss
Everts, taken from the Milwaukee
Sentinel about "My Lady's Ring":
"The delightful play, rich in pathos
and comedy, was a happy medium in
which to exploit the rare delicacy of
Miss Everts' art. The play requires
the impersonation of nine characters,
with sudden transitions from the royal
dignity of the Princess Helene to the
childlike naivette of Annina and the
crotchets of the aged men and women,
all of which Miss Everts accomplished
with a skill that betokens her an
artist of rare ability. Although she
has appeared in legitimate drama with
Otis Skinner and Ada Rehan, and her
adoption of a stage career would un
doubtedly mean a success in the
broadest and fullest sense, Miss Everts
has withdrawn from the footlights and
confines herself entirely to platform
work."
