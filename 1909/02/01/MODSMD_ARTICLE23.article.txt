### 
Those in charge of the Musical Fes
tival have issued posters which are
displayed about the Quad, calling at
tention to the rehearsals and inviting
singers to participate.
Efforts are being made to have the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra change
their date, so that, the festival will
not follow so closely the Junior Opera.
Male voices are greatly needed to com
plete the chorus.
