# NOTED MAN TO SPEAK.
## G.O. Shields, Sportsman, ex-Editor and Well-Known Writer, Will Lecture Tomorrow Night. 
### 
G. O. Shields, president of the
League of American Sportsmen, and
former editor of the Recreation, will
give an illustrated lecture tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
The speaker is well known as a lec
turer, traveler, explorer, author and
hunter. Probably no man in the coun
try has accomplished more in the cre
ation and moulding of a healthy pub
lic sentiment toward our wild animal
life. He has also been an important
factor in the movement for a proper
recognition of the value of our birds,
animals and forests.
The lantern slides will deal with the
wild animals in their native haunts.
No admission will be charged.
