# GRADUATES TO SPEAK
## ASSEMBLY WILL BE ADDRESSED BY NOTED ALUMNI. H.C. Hoover, H.A. Moran, '05, and G.O. Shields to Appear at Third Hour Tomorrow. 
### 
Three speakers of note will address
the Assembly which comes at the
third hour tomorrow, and, from the
character of the men who are to speak,
tne gathering should be one of '.he
most interesting of the semester.
The principal address will be made
by H. C. Hoover, '95, who has won for
himself an international reputation as
a mining expert. He will speak on
some topic related to the work in
which he is at present engaged.
While in college Hoover was prom
inent in undergraduate affairs. He
was a member of the pioneer class,
and it was largely through his efforts
that the foundation of the present Stu
dent Body organization was laid. He
was instrumental in the adoption oi
the constitution and in the creation of
the office which is at present known as
Graduate Manager. He was the first
one to hold this office, and during his
administration a debt of $3000 was
paid off and the Student Body finances
put upon a sound basis.
It is interesting to note that Hoove:-
is said to have been the first man to
sleep in Encina Hall.
Since leaving college Hoover has
rapidly risen in his profession, until
at the present time he is known
throughout the world as a mining ex
pert. He has for the last ten years
been in charge of vast mining oper
ations in all parts of the world, and
is at present director and manager
of companies in England, China, South
America, Australia, Mexico and Can
ada. He also has the distinction of
being a fellow of the Royal Geograph
ical Society of London.
H. A. Moran, '05, will speak on the
subject "Oxford Men." Moran grad
uated from Oxford last year, being the
first Stanford student to secure a
Rhodes scholarship. He is now en
route to China, where he intends to
take up his duties as a missionary.
G. O. Shields, well known as an
author, sportsman and magazine edi
tor, will be introduced by Dr. Jordan,
and will make a short address. Shields
has won national fame as an explor
er and lecturer, and his remarks to
morrow at the Assembly, which will
be merely introductory to the lecture
which he is scheduled to deliver in
the evening, should be highly inter
esting.
