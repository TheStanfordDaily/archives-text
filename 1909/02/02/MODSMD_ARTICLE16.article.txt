### 
A committee, consisting of W. H.
Masters, '09, J. H. Wiggins, '10, A. B.
Cox, '09, has been appointed by In
structor Long to make arrangements
for a handball tournament, to be held
some time this month.
The tournament is to be run on a
new system, devised by Long, whicn
he thinks will result in increased in
terest being taken in the game.
Men are to be selected by each fra
ternity, Encina Club, students resid
ing in Palo Alto and the commuters,
to represent them in the tournament.
It is supposed that the selection of
these men will involve the necessity
of playing minor tournaments.
The winner of the tournament will
gain the privilege of retaining in his
possession for one year the Story Belt.
This belt is the customary prize for
the handball championship, it being
necessary for any one person to win
it three times successively to retain
it permanently.
Shortly after the earthquake the be it
was stolen from the possession of A.
B. Cox, winner of the 1904 tourna
ment. Cox is having the belt repro
duced at a San Francisco jeweler's,
and it will be completed by the time
the tournament begins.
