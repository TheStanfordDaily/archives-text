Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
An enthusiastic young member of
the Woman's League expressed to me
a not unnatural wish that the men
would turn out in full force to the
benefit performance for the League
next Thursday, and, under the cir
cumstances, I would like to echo the
wish in your columns.
The circumstances are that for five
or six years the young women gave
willingly and gladly their part of the
student semester assessments to the
Training House Fund â€”their contribu
tions to the men's athletic field
amounting in this way, I presume, to
about $2000. Moreover, in gathering
the direct taxes which have from time
to time been levied for men's athletics
the tax collectors have spared age,
but not sex, and here, again, the young
women have sowed where they have
not reaped.
Incidentally, they have done their
share towards keeping up the re
ceipts of campus games, and, while
I am aware that feminine presence
on the bleachers sometimes implies a
deficit in masculine pockets, such
cases in general may, with gentle vio
lence to English, be termed mis
representative. Consequently, as a
matter of fair play and of several good
turns deserving at least one return,
I hope the men will come out in force
Thursday evening.
Frank Angell.
