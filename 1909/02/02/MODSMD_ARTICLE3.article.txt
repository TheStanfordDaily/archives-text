# THREE SPEAK BEFORE ASSEMBLY
## H.C. Hoover, '95, Outlines Plan for the Erection of $50,000 Club-House.—H.A. Moran and G.O. Shields also Make Addresses. 
### 
The much-discussed question of se
curing a men's clubhouse on the
campus was given a practical turn to
day, when H. C. Hoover, '95, in speak
ing before the Assembly, outlined a
plan which he has worked out for
financing the enterprise.
Hoover first spoke of the large and
important place which similar clubs
hold in eastern universities and how
the life of the whole community cen
ters about them. He pointed out the
need for such a gathering place at
Stanford.
The structure projected by Hoover
would cost about $50,000, and would
contain, in addition to a large club
room, a trophy room, offices and quar
ters for the various student organiza
tions and Student Body officials, and
possibly a cafe and rooms for the ac
commodations of visitors. "The club,"
said Hoover, "should be erected and
maintained by the students and alum
ni and should be entirely independent
of the University authorities. The
privileges of the club should be open
to all undergraduates, alumni and
members of the faculty."
Plans for raising the money are al
ready under way, about $10,000 hav
ing been promised by the alumni, and
a committee has been appointed to
continue the canvass. The Student
Body will also be expected to aid in
the project as soon as the plans have
been more definitely formulated. In
this way, Hoover is confident of be
ing able to secure the necessary funds
to erect the building without appeal
ing to the trustees. It is probable
that it will require a year to make all
the arrangements, but Hoover expects
that sufficient funds will be available
by that time to justify fhe beginning
of the construction work.

In speaking of the good Fhich the
club woull accomplish, Hoover said
"Such a cluohouse would serve as the
rallying point for student spirit and
organizations, and as a common
ground upon which students, faculty
and alumni could meet. It would fur
nish the facilities for the formation of
those lasting friendships which are
the most valuable result of a college
course, it would restore the solidar
ity that existed between students ml
faculty in the old days. And, despite
the general impression to the con
trary, those days were times when <u.
intimate relationship existed betweß"
faculty and students. That was the
origin of the Stanford Spirit, and Jt
is that relationship and that sp'rit
which the club would promote."
Previous to Hoover's address, G. O
Shields, the famous sportsman and
magazine editor, was introduced by
Dr. Jordan and spoke very briefly. He
told of the damage that had be?n
caused to American agriculturists ! n
all parts of the United States as ?
result of the destruction of the bin 1 -
life of the country, and made *i plea
for the preservation of the songsters.
H. A. Moran, '05, made the con
cluding address, telling of his experi
ences and impressions during his
course at Oxford. Moran was the first
Stanford student to be given a Rhodes
scholarship, and he gave an interest
ing comparison of the English and
American university methods. His
topic was "Oxford Men," and he
showed the way in which students at
the English institution are moulded
into broad-minded, useful citizens, and
told of the leading part which Oxford
men take in the affairs of Great
Britain.
