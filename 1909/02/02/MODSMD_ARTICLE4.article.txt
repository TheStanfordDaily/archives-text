# HORTON CALLS OFF TRACK MEET.
## Inclement Weather Results in Postponement of Contest.â€”Seven Men Enter Olympic Club Events. 
### 
Owing to the continued inclement
weather, Track Captain Horton has
called off the meet scheduled for to
morrow afternoon and postponed the
contest indefinitely. As it is not con
sidered advisable to hold a meet on
Saturday of this week, owing to the
fact that several men will compete
in the Olympic Club indoor meet in
San Francisco on Friday, the first of
the season's meets will not be held
before the last of next week. The cold
weather has prevented the men from
getting into as good condition as was
anticipated, and it was feared that a
meet at this time might result in a
bieakdown on some one of the squad.
Six men are entered as the Stan
ford team in the Olympic Club meet.
Captain Horton will compete in the
twelve and sixteen-pound shot events,
while C. S. Morris, '08, and B. L.
Gregg, '09, are entered in the low hur
dles. In the quarter-mile, ,T. O. Mil
ler, '08, C. S. Morris, '08, \V. M. Rawles,
'09, and W. M. Wyman, '11, will wear
the Cardinal. '
