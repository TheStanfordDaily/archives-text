# TO LECTURE ON EQUAL RIGHTS.
## Organizer of Suffrage Leagues Will Address Stanford Women on February 12. 
### 
The Stanford women are to have
the pleasure of hearing Mrs. M. W.
Park lecture on Equal Suffrage in the
Chapel 011 February 12, at 4:30. She
was an officer of the first college
Equal Suffrage League in Massachu
setts, and later was an active agent
and officer in the National College
Equal Suffrage League. Mrs. Park has
organized leagues in many colleges
of the East and Middle West. She
tLinks that all college women owe a
great deal to the pioneers in the suf
frage movement.
Mrs. Park is a fine speaker. She is
young and enthusiastic. She spoke
before the Stanford women at Rohle
Hall about a year ago, and at thai
time also before the Berkeley Assem
bly at Berkeley, being the first wo
man to have that opportunity. Mem
bers of the Women's League believe
Mrs. Park deserves the largest audi
ence that can be gathered together,
and it is hoped that the Stanford girls
will give her a royal welcome.
