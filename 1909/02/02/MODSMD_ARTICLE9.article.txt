While the matter of tlie establish
ment of a Trophy Room is under con
sideration and before any final ac
tion is taken by the Executive Com
mittee, it is opportune that we make
public information regarding trophy
rooms at other large universities
which we have gathered. We find that
the trophy rooms at four representa
tive institutions of the country arc
located either in the gymnasium or
some large building conveniently sit
uated on the campus.
Stanford would have had a Trophy
Room equal to the best had it not been
destroyed along with the remainder
ol the new Gymnasium. Now that
we must seek some other location, we
offer what information we possess in
hopes that it will aid the Executive
Committee in making a suitable selec
tion. In answer to a query as to lo
cation and character of Trophy Room,
Mr. H. N. Van Dyke of Princeton Uni
versity writes:
"I received your letter this morn
ing. The Trophy Room is in the
Gymnasium, between the front door of
the building and the main room, so
that one entering the Gymnasium by
the main entrance passes through it.
It is a large room, occupying the
whole width of the building and hav
ing stairways and balconies on each
side. The championship banners for
different years in baseball, football,
athletics, etc., are displayed there, and
also footballs and baseballs, repre
senting victories in games with differ
ent colleges."
Eugene .1. Curtis, business manager
of the Yale News, says in a commu
nication to the editor:
"Replying to your communication of
the 12th inst., I am pleased to fur
nish you the following information re
garding the Trophy Room of Yale Uni
versity. This room is located on the
second floor of the Gymnasium, ac
cess being had to it from the landing
of the large marble staircase leading

to the main floor of the building. The
room itself is about 75x35 feet in size,
and contains all trophies and ath
letic relics and records since athlet
ics became a prominent factor in col
lege activities. Among these trophies
are intercollegiate banners, cups
awarded for intercollegiate contests
or dual contests; the football or base
ball that was used in every champion
ship game; and, in fact, any and ev
erything which denotes victory :'jkl
glory to Yale in any line of athletic:?.
Perhaps the most highly prized and
revered relic contained in the room
is the stuffed body of Handsome Din,
the Boston terrier for so many years
the most famous mascot of the base
ball and the football teams."
Dean L. Kelsey, general secretly
of the Christian Association of Cor
nell University, telling of the locat'on
of the Trophy Room at that institu
tion, states:
"1 have your 'etter asking for par
ticulars regarding the Trophy Room
a' Cornell. In reply I would say tint
the Christian Association givss the
University Athletic Association oui> of
the rooms in the Christian Associa
tion building for use as a Trophy
Room. They furnish the cases and fix
tures, and we simply keep the ronr.
in order along with tlie rest of the
building, but there is no expense on
the association for the maintenance
of it."
At Harvard we learn that the Tro
phy Room is situated centrally in ihe
Harvard Union, and is at all time;? ihe
center of interest.

awarded for intercollegiate contests
or dual contests; the football or base
ball that was used in every champion
ship game; and, in fact, any and ev
erything which denotes victory :'jkl
glory to Yale in any line of athletic:?.
Perhaps the most highly prized and
revered relic contained in the room
is the stuffed body of Handsome Din,
the Boston terrier for so many years
the most famous mascot of the base
ball and the football teams."
Dean L. Kelsey, general secretly
of the Christian Association of Cor
nell University, telling of the locat'on
of the Trophy Room at that institu
tion, states:
"1 have your 'etter asking for par
ticulars regarding the Trophy Room
a' Cornell. In reply I would say tint
the Christian Association givss the
University Athletic Association oui> of
the rooms in the Christian Associa
tion building for use as a Trophy
Room. They furnish the cases and fix
tures, and we simply keep the ronr.
in order along with tlie rest of the
building, but there is no expense on
the association for the maintenance
of it."
At Harvard we learn that the Tro
phy Room is situated centrally in ihe
Harvard Union, and is at all time;? ihe
center of interest.
While the matter of tlie establish
ment of a Trophy Room is under con
sideration and before any final ac
tion is taken by the Executive Com
mittee, it is opportune that we make
public information regarding trophy
rooms at other large universities
which we have gathered. We find that
the trophy rooms at four representa
tive institutions of the country arc
located either in the gymnasium or
some large building conveniently sit
uated on the campus.
Stanford would have had a Trophy
Room equal to the best had it not been
destroyed along with the remainder
ol the new Gymnasium. Now that
we must seek some other location, we
offer what information we possess in
hopes that it will aid the Executive
Committee in making a suitable selec
tion. In answer to a query as to lo
cation and character of Trophy Room,
Mr. H. N. Van Dyke of Princeton Uni
versity writes:
"I received your letter this morn
ing. The Trophy Room is in the
Gymnasium, between the front door of
the building and the main room, so
that one entering the Gymnasium by
the main entrance passes through it.
It is a large room, occupying the
whole width of the building and hav
ing stairways and balconies on each
side. The championship banners for
different years in baseball, football,
athletics, etc., are displayed there, and
also footballs and baseballs, repre
senting victories in games with differ
ent colleges."
Eugene .1. Curtis, business manager
of the Yale News, says in a commu
nication to the editor:
"Replying to your communication of
the 12th inst., I am pleased to fur
nish you the following information re
garding the Trophy Room of Yale Uni
versity. This room is located on the
second floor of the Gymnasium, ac
cess being had to it from the landing
of the large marble staircase leading

to the main floor of the building. The
room itself is about 75x35 feet in size,
and contains all trophies and ath
letic relics and records since athlet
ics became a prominent factor in col
lege activities. Among these trophies
are intercollegiate banners, cups
awarded for intercollegiate contests
or dual contests; the football or base
ball that was used in every champion
ship game; and, in fact, any and ev
erything which denotes victory :'jkl
glory to Yale in any line of athletic:?.
