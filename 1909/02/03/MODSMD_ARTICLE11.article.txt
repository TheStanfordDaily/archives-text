# CROSS BATS TOMORROW
## VARSITY TO MEET SANTA CLARA ON LOCAL GROUNDS. Collegians Expected with Strong Nine. Stanford to Be Represented by Team Picked for Saturday. 
### 
The Varsity diamond will tomorrow
afternoon be the scene of the first of
a series of games scheduled with the
Santa Clara College nine, providing
that inclement weather does not again
prohibit the use of the diamond. Noth
ing is known of the strength of the
team representing the neighboring
college this year, Manager Stewart not
having been informed of the line-up
of the team. Santa Clara has, how
ever, always in the past produced
strong aggregations, and a hotly con
tested series is anticipated.
Rain continues to make regular and
effective practice 011 the part of the
Varsity squad impossible. Coach
ley has had his men in the Gymnasi
um on several occasions of late, where
they were able to indulge in short
catching practices. This has been the
extent of the work of the squad to
date, except on rare occasions, when
the use of the diamond has been prac
ticable.
The dates for the interclass series
have not been arranged as yet, but
they will probably be announced
shortly.
Tomorrow's game will begin
promptly at 4, and the customary 25-
cent admission will be charged. The
Varsity players will don their new
uniforms for the first time in the con
test with Santa Clara.
The Varsity line-up will be the same
as that which was to have faced St.
Mary's last Saturday. Theile, Smith
and Tallant will do the twirling for
Stanford. The probable line-up of the
Varsity follows: Theile, Smith, Tal
lant, pitchers; Mitchell, Canterbury,
catchers; Bell, first base; Cadwalader,
second base; Scott, third base; Samp
son, shortstop; Tallant, Ganong, Ball,
Scofield, McGregor, outfield.
