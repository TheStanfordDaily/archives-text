Dr. Frank Angell in his commu
nication, printed in our columns last
night, expresses our sentiments pre
cisely when he urges that support he
given the production of "My Lady's
Ring." In the past, when de
serving benefits have been announc
ed, a good turn-out has been the
result. We suggest that it would not
be out of place to institute a united
movement to this end. It is true, "pa
rades" in general have been discoun
tenanced, but we doubt if one esti
mated at 50 cents per member would
be refused admittance at Assembly
Hall tomorrow evening. The show is
a good one, and the cause a deserv
ing one.
No one can gainsay the good that
will come from the establishment of
a clubhouse on the campus, and, in
congratulating Mr. Hoover on taking
the initiative in this movement, we be
lieve that we voice the unanimous sen
timent of the community. A clubhouse
of the type that is proposed has been
found essential in the college life of
all the larger universities of the East
and of inestimable value in serving
to keep the entire community a unit.
A clubhouse here has been broached
and discussed by the president of the
University, members of the faculty
and certain undergraduate organiza
tions. It remains to the credit of our
noted alumnus, however, to take a
hand in the situation and focus all
plans into concrete action.
The actual work of constructing the
building cannot be started too soon
We learn that the project has met
with universal favor with the trustees
and that a site can be obtained upon
the campus which would be admirably
suited for the establishment. To have
the ownership of the building vested
in the graduates and undergraduates
is. indeed, a worthy idea. If the pro
moter of the clubhouse believes that
sufficient money can be raised in this

manner, we concur heartily with him;
but, if there is any doubt as to tho
raising of a sufficient sum in an ex
peditious manner from ibis source
and the trustees are ready to advance
enough to insure practically an im
mediate construction of the clubhouse,
it might be the best policy to pro
ceed at once and lift our obligation
to the directors of this institution
as the profits accrue and we enjoy
the advantages of the establishment
These are our ideas on the matter,
but doubtless before making known
his plans, Mr. Hoover has gone over
the situation with far greater care
and wisdom and whatever conclusion
he l as arrived at should meet with
unanimous support, both financial and
moral.
