# NOTED HUNTER TALKS
## G.O. SHIELDS GIVES LECTURE UPON INTERESTING TOPICS. Experiences of Prominent Explorer Illustrated by Exceptional Photographs. 
### 
G. O. Shields, who has become well
known as an explorer, hunter, author
and especially as a photographer of
wild animals in their native state,
delivered an intensely interesting lec
ture before a large audience in the
Chapel last evening. The main fea
ture of the talk was the exhibition of
an unexcelled collection of stereopti
con views of animal life that are the
result of the extensive use of the
camera by the author upon his nu
merous expeditions within the past
thirty years.
Shields explained how the efforts
of those who are interested in the
preservation of the wild creatures of
the country have secured laws that
are even now prolific in the accom
plishment of their purposes. These
provisions have applied especially to
leathered animal life that has been
useful in the extermination of par
asitic life. Through the energies of
Shields and his associates, all States
have been induced to enact laws that
are tending to protect and aid in the
re-establishment of the antelope.
The agricultural value of the squir
rel, the quail and animals of this
class that have been practically ex
terminated in some portions of the
country, was dealt with by the lec
turer from a financial and commer
cial point of view. Many interesting
as well as exciting personal experi
ences of the lecturer were given with
suitable slides, depicting his encoun
ters with wild animals.
