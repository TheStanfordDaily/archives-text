# NO TRIP FOR PLAYERS
## STEWART UNABLE TO SCHEDULE GAMES WITH ST. VINCENT'S. Dates Conflict and St. Ignatius Will Probably Be Substituted for Los Angeles Nine. 
### 
It now appears improbable that St.
Vincent's will be included in the base
ball schedule for this semester. Man
ager Stewart has been unable to find
any open dates which coincide with
cf St. Vincent's. If no satis
factory arrangement can be made, the
trip South must be declared off, and
the baseball team will not leave tha
campus for any extended time this
year.
As it has been the custom, the last
several years, for the games to ba
p.ayed with the Los Angeles team, it
i-i a regrettable fact that they will
probably have to be abandoned this
reason.
Instead of the contests with St. V<n
cent. a game with St. Ignatius, and
an extra game with the Olympics will
probably be played. Both of
teams have put strong line-ups on the
field in the past, and the games wil!
no doubt he hard fought.
As regards a game with the "Whit;;
Sox," who will be on the Coast this
spring, Manager Stewart has sail
that the Stanford team will not meet
them. Their manager asks such a
large guarantee that to pay it would
eat up most of the profits of the oth
er games. California will probaoly
take the same stand on this matter
and content themselves with less-ra
nowned opponents.
The game with St. Mary's, whioh
was to be played last Saturday, but
was declared off on account of the
inclemency of the weather, will be
played some time in the near future,
so that all those holding season tick
ets will get the full value on their
money.
Active training for the game witn
the Wallabies is now regularly held.
The Executive Committee is to meet
tonight to decide as to the entertain
ment of the Australian champions.
They will also be entertained in San
Francisco, where a banquet theater
party and other festivities have al
ready been arranged.
