# Minstrel Show Date Changed.
## 
### 
The date for the Combined Clubs'
Minstrel Show, which was to have
been given February 20, has been defi
nitely changed to April 23. The Glee
men found that a successful presenta
tion in February or March would re
quire more time than they could spare,
and for a while thought of abandon
ing the project. So much work had
already been done that the latter date
was finally chosen. This choice is
particularly good, as it is the night
before the regatta.
