# DESIGN NOT FAVORED
## MEMORIAL CHURCH TO RETAIN OLD CLOCK AND CHIMES. Submitted Plan for New Building Not Likely to Be Accepted by Board of Trustees. 
### 
The Memorial Church, when rebuilt,
will in all probability not differ radi
cally from its original form, and, fur
thermore, will have in its tower the
old-time clock and chimes.
Dr. .Jordan states that the design,
of which a cut was printed in The
Daily Palo Alto January 27, and which
was submitted by a firm of San Fran
cisco architects, has not great chance
(;f being accepted by the Board of
Trustees of the University.
This plan, which would have called
for the doing away with of the "fly
ing-buttresses" and the reconstruction
of the tower on lines greatly differ
ing from those of the original build
ing, was not well received by members
of the Alumni or of the undergraduate
body. Dr. Jordan says that he him
self dislikes it, and is sure that it has
not been found satisfactory by the
members of the board.
All who ever saw the Memorial
Church before its destruction by the
earthquake recognize" the beauty of
that old style and are desirous of hav
ing it retained as much as possible
The chief causes of their objection to
the new plan are found in the design
of the tower and in the fact that the
old four-faced dial, with its quarter
hour chimes, was to be eliminated. Dr.
Jordan states positively, however, that
in any plan that is finally accepted
by the board, the old timepiece will
be retained.
