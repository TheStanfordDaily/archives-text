# Wants Students to Aid Poor of City.
## 
### 
In response to an appeal made by
Dr. Gardner, members of the Studenr
Body recently contributed a large box
of cast-off clothing, hats and shoes
for the work of the Nurses' Settle
ment in San Francisco.
Miss Briggs, tlie head of the Set
tlement, acknowledges the gift to Dr.
Gardner in these terms: "It is the
best ever. Such good things, and ev
ery one of them can be put to the best
possible use for the best possible peo
ple now! The nurse assures me the
things will soon be all distributed;
that she is making them reach out as
far as she can. Thank you so much,
and thank the young men and women
who are inspired to help these needy
others."
Dr. Gardner says: "More donations
are needed. If students will send
whatever they can to the Bookstore,
or to my residence, I will undertake
to pack and dispatch them to Miss
Briggs."
