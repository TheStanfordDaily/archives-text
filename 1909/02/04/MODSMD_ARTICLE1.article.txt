# VARSITY IS DEFEATED
## SANTA CLAIM NINE VICOTRS BY SCORE OF 2 TO 1. Fast Playing Is Made Difficult by Muddy Field.—Stanford Scores in First Inning. 
### 
in the opening game of the season,
the Varsity this afternoon went down
to defeat before the Santa Clara Col
lege nine by a score of 2 to 1. Th*
game was played on a muddy diamond,
and fast play w*s impossible. The
defeat of the Varsity was due largely
to the inability «of the Cardinal hats
men to conmu't effectively with
Friene's delivery. Smith, on the 'other
hand, was Mt freely by the Colle
gians. Strong support prevented fur
ther scoring ion the part of Santa
Clara. 'Considering the sfcow condi
tion of the grounds and lack of prac
tice on account of the recent rains,
the Varsity made an excellent show
ing this afternoon.
Friene's pitching and hitting and
Scott's fielding were the features of
the contest. The former Struck out
eleven men and was credited with
three clean hits. Scott stopped Wal
terstein's hard drive in the third in
n.'ng, and in the fourth handled Jac
obs' liner in fast style. The three hits
credited to Stanford were made by
Scott, Bell and Sampson.
The scoring began in the first in
ning, when Stanford secured its first
and only tally. Scott, the first man
to face Friene, singled, reached sec
ond on Bell's sacrifice, and stole home,
after getting to third on Friene's fum
ble of Sampson's bingle.
Santa Clara obtained both runs in
the fourth. Shal'er singled, reached
third on two consecutive steals and
came home on Jacob's bunt. The
winning score was made by Donovan,
who reached first on a fielder's choice,
was advanced on Friene's single and
tallied on an error.
The summary follows: R. H. E.
Stanford 1 3 1
