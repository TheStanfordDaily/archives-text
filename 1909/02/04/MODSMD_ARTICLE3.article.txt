# CARNOT FRIDAY NIGHT
## INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE TO BE HELD IN ASSEMBLY HALL. Stanford Is Well Represented and Outlook Points Toward Another Victory.â€”Judges Chosen. 
### 
The Stanford debators have com
pleted the preliminary preparations
for the fifteenth annual Carnot de
bate, which is to be held in the As
sembly Hall tomorrow evening, and
are now ready for the contest, as far
as work upon the general question is
concerned. Those who will represent
the Cardinal comprise a strong team,
and, from their demonstrations of abil
ity, the outcome is very favorable to
the retention of the medal at Stan
ford. The team is made up of D. C.
Boyd, gr., J. E. Shelton, '30, and G.
F. Morgan, '10, while N. C. Wilson,
'12, will assume the place of any of
the trio as alternate should they be
come incapacitated. California will
send as her contestants H. D. Hoover,
'09, A. R. Morgan, 'OS, and N. Drury,
'12, who constitute a formidable ar
ray of speakers.
The specific question that will be
the subject of the debate tomorrow
evening will be chosen by the faculty
committee that has this matter in
hand the general topic, "France and
Her Relation to Her Colonies and De
pendencies." In choosing this ques
tion, the Stanford committee, com
posed of Assistant Professor C. A.
Huston of the Law School and R. M.
Alden from the Department of Eng
lish, will consult with C. W. Wells
and M. C. Flaherty of the University
of California. The results of the de
liberations of this joint board of se
lection will be opened before the con
testants two hours before the debate
and given to them as the topic upon
which they must speak. The candi
date, however, is allowed to choose
the side of the question that he
wishes to uphold, regardless of the
fact that possibly one or two men
from the team representing the rival
university may be upon the same side
of the discussion. The order in which
the various speakers will debate will
be determined by lot, each assuming
his place upon the side to which he
is assigned in the order of the num
ber that he draws.
Stanford enters the contest under
the best of auspices and with the
realization that she has the material
upon the team that represents her
that should bring another victory
here. Six medals have been awarded
to Stanford men during the period in
which this unique plan of debating
has been instituted here, and it is very
probable that another name will be
added to that list. The team that de
bated last year in the name of Stan
ford was composed of W. C. Shelton,
J. E. Shelton and D. C. Boyd, the win
ner being picked by the judges as
W. C. Shelton.
Boyd, as a veteran of the Carnot
trio of last year, is a fluent, interest
ing speaker, who arranges his mate
rial in a clear, logical fashion, put
ting special stress upon the manner
in which the various points that ho
makes lead up to the culminating con
clusion. Boyd has been closely iden
tified with debating interests at Stan
ford for the past four years, and is a
