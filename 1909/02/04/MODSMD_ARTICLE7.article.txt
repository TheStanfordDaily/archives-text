# GAME IS NOT FAVORED
## STANFORD WILL NOT ENTER TRYOUT FOR ALL-STAR TEAM. Plans of Rugby Union Objected to By Coach Presley and Local Veterans. 
### 
The Cardinal veterans will not take
part in the practice game to be played
in San Francisco next Sunday, to de
termine who shall compose the All-
California team that is to meet the
Australians on February 13. The ar
ticle which appeared in the San Fran
c'sco papers this morning to that ef
fect was denied by Coach Presley and
many of the players today. Accord
ing to the report, two picked teams,
composed of the best players in the
SLate, have been chosen by the Ref
erees' Union of San Francisco, and
are scheduled to play a practice con
test in San Francisco next. Sunday,
following which a team will be picked
from the thirty men to represent Cal
ifornia in the international contest.
The line-ups as published in this
morning's dailies include fourteen of
the Stanford veterans.
In speaking of the game, Coach
Presley said that while he would not
attempt to keep any of the Cardinal
players from participating Sunday,
he does not favor the plan, as he
desires that the men be in the best
possible shape for Wednesday's con
test with the Wallabies and fears that
some might incur injuries which
would lessen Stanford's chances in the
contest with the Australians. Most of
the players whose names were men
tioned in this connection have ex
pressed themselves as agreeing with
Coach Presley's views and have stated
that, while they might enter the in
ternational contest, if asked to do so,
they will not enter the preliminary
game. Both coach and men feel that
the work of the Cardinal players is
sufficiently well known to the Ref
erees' Union to enable them to judge
oi the relative merits of the players
without any further tryout, and so
consider it unnecessary to enter Sun
day's game.
The rainy weather has prevented ac
tive practice during the last few days,
but the men are observing strict train
ing rules, and Coach Presley is. con
fident of having them in good condi
tion for Wednesday's game. Although
Stanford Field is somewhat soggy, a
few days' sunshine will put it in
splendid shape again.
The date for the game has been set
for Wednesday afternoon, and, unless
the Wallabies are unexpectedly de
layed in reaching the Coast, no change
will be made in the schedule time. A
telegram received at San Francisco
Tuesday conveyed the information
that the Australians will arrive there
on Friday evening at 8:20, and will
thus be able to meet California on
Saturday afternoon. If the visitors
should not reach the Coast in time
to play on Saturday, the contest with
the Blue and Gold will be held on
Tuesday, and the contest with Stan
ford will be postponed until Thurs
day.
