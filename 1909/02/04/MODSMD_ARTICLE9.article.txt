It is to be regretted that Stanford
will not meet St. Vincent on the base
ball diamond this season. We under
stand the difficulty is due to no fault
oi the management, but failure of the
Los Angeles team to agree to any of
the numerous dates offered. While
the players of St. Vincent do not rank
as high as several more local teams,
the trip away from the campus has
served in years past as a pleasant
and beneficial break in the season of
training. The gap in the off-campus
schedule will probably not occur an
other year, as experience shows that
more reliable opponents are necessary.
