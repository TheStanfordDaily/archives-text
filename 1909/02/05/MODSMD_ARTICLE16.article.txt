## H.C. HOOVER GIVES INTERESTING FAREWELL LECTURE. Noted Graduate Tolls of Rise of Profession and Outlines Prerequisites of Success. 
### 
A* large gathering of engineering
sludents listened to H. C. Hoover, '95,
this morning, when he delivered his
final lecture of the series which he
has been giving in the Engineering
department here. He spoke on "The
Requirements of the Engineering Pro
fession."
In introduction, Hoover spoke of the
levolution which has come about ui
the engineering profession in the last
twenty years. "For now," he said
"the engineer is not the dirty techni
cian, who sits in a back office :vnd
draws up blue-prints, but he has risen
to an executive position and to a field
the demands of which are commercial.
"The profession was first composed
of elevated artisans, but in the last
forty years university training has be
come a necessity. An engineer is not
an engine driver, but engineering is
the application of science to industry,
and industry is business."
He also pointed out that the engi
neer must first of all have the "en
gineering sense," which he defined as
a mental endowment, elevating engi
neering to a profession. Continuing,
Hoover said: "The engineer must
have executive ability, the capacity to
co-ordinate and control the best efforts
of other people." When undertaking
any great work, the engineer must
consider four important phases. First,
the value of the project, which in
volves the financial sense; for pri
marily all projects must pay. Sec
ond, the method of attack and the risk
of the unknown, for a new undertak
iiig has numbers of unknown factors,
as nature always has something up
her sleeve. Third, the delineation of
details, requiring technical training.
And, lastly, the actual work, calling
forth the executive ability.
"Engineering work is the best paid
of all professions, due to scarcity of
the combined qualities of training,
honesty and ability. It is a battle
with nature, and usually leads to a
compromise. Railroads and mines are
for the most part in the mountains,
away from the centers of civilization,
and the engineer is therefore on an
outpost of duty. A real engineer does
not advertise himself, and today the
world does not know who did much of
our engineering work. But in the fu
ture the world will ask, Who did the
v.ork?' and not 'Who paid for it?' En
gineering is the profession of creation
and construction."
