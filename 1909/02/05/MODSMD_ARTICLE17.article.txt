ing the proposition for a School of
Forestry at their meeting last Friday,
regarded the matter in a favorable
light. After an extended discussion,
the proposition was referred to Pres
ident Jordan for detailed information.
This will require a report on the cost
of such a school and the number of
students who would take a course in
Forestry if the department were or
ganized. The board also requested Dr.
