# BENEFIT IS A SUCCESS
## "MY LADY'S RING" NETS PROFIT TO CLUBHOUSE FUND. Miss Everts Pleases Audience with Clever Impersonations.-—Clear $159 on Production. 
### 
Katherine Jewell Everts' rendition
ot "My Lady's Ring," in Assembly Hall
last evening, merited a much larger
audience than turned out to see the
comedy, which was written by Alice
Brown. The theater was about one
fourth full.
Miss Everts has achieved an envia
ble place in the art of reading, of
which she realizes the dramatic pos
sibilities to a high degree. Despite
the concentration of action which her
method embraces, she impersonates
nine characters in a remarkably con
vincing manner.
Before commencing "My Lady's
Ring," Miss Everts spoke a word of
gratitude to the audience. She is a.
young woman of magnetic presenca
and attractive appearance. Her voice
is quite flexible and her speech sent
every word so distinctly that it would
he surprising if the most distant lis
teners had difficulty in hearing.
In and about Nice "My Lady'a
Ring" is laid; the time is the present.
Helene Romanoff returns from a drive
without a turquoise ring which her
husband bought her. In explanation,
she tells him that she placed the ring
on the finger of a beautiful peasant
girl, whom she saw asleep on the steps
of a church. The suspicious jealousy
of Prince Romanoff—who is twenty
years her senior—will not allow him
to accept the story as truth. When
Ippolito, the lover of Annina, sees the
ring on her finger, he charges her
with duplicity. The girl is at a loss
to account for the ring, and flings
it in the road in front of her father's
house. Princess Helene and Annina
take refuge in the same convent from
the wrath of their men. Tornelli, the
jeweler, finds the ring, both the Prince
and Ippolito claiming it. Romanoff is
convinced that his wife is enamoured
of the young man, who feels equally
certain that the Prince has used the
ring to win away Annina. Final ex
planation by the Princess effects a
happy reconciliation for each couple.
Although four characters are at
times taking part in the action, Miss
Everts keeps all of the nine in per
spective. Her portrayal of the charm
ing Helene is adequate and that of
Romanoff strong. The representations
of Annina's parents and Gazagnaire,
the solicitor, with a penchant for ro
mance, are effective character-acting.
Ippolito is an ardent and enthusiastic
lover of a simple peasant girl.
In addition to raising $159 net
for the benefit of the Women's Club
house, the Women's League pro
vided an evening profitable to the Uni
versity community. Undoubtedly, many
of those who bought tickets and re
mained away from the performance
will regret that they missed one of
the most unique and artistic enter
tainments given at Stanford for some
years.
