Manager Stewart has asked that cer
tain l'acts lie brought before the Stu
dent Body in regard to the conduct
at campus baseball games, and his
sentiments are echoed by Coach Pres
ley, Captain Sampson and all of the
varsity squad. We believe that what
ever is said in this regard be not
construed to dampen attendance or
spirit, but to direct it along lines of
best advantage and to eliminate ob
jectionable features.
It costs cents—and even less,
under the season-ticket rate—to wit
ness a baseball game, yet yesterday,
when collectors sought to extract this
sum from the large crowd which
thronged the sidelines, interfered with
the players on the field and general
ly making it unpleasant for those on
the bleachers, they were met with a
blunt refusal in nine out of ten cases.
The place for every one is on the
bleachers. The support of the team
is essential, if we are to have a win
ning nine. The management needs the
admissions, and evaders of ibis small
fee not only fail to do their share,
but detract from the paid admission
at future contests.
It, is not conducive to large tick* i
sales when one may cheerfully pay
the price of admission only to seen e
his seat and see any number of his ac
quaintances squatting along the side
lines, enjoying the game and refus'.i g
to pay.
The management believes, as we do,
that it has been largely unintentional
on the part of the great majority.
Manager Stewart has decided to have
additional ticket-takers on the grounds
at the next game, and will ask all
spectators to take seats in the bleach
ers. He believes that when the mat
ter has been called to the attention of
the undergraduates he will meet with
co-operation. We hope we have the
right to assure him he is correct. The
conduct at. the next game will tell.
