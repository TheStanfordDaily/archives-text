# CREW CAPTAIN ELECTED
## R.H. REYNOLDS OF JUNIOR CLASS WILL LEAD VARSITY EIGHT. Resignation of H.B. Patrick Necessitates Election of Leader.â€”.Murphy Pleased with Development. 
### 
R. H. Reynolds of the Junior class
was today elected captain of the var
sity crew. Due to the resignation of
H. B. Patrick, '10, elected captain of
the crew, the end of the last rowing
season, but who is now confined to his
bed in the Guild Hospital, it was nec
essary to select a new leader. Six of
the nine men who were in the eight
that rowed against the University of
California last year attended the meet
ing and elected Reynolds to fill the va
cated position. At the present time,
the captain-elect is the only member
of last year's varsity eight who is out
for crew this semester.
Reynolds registers in the Law de
partment from Pasadena, and belongs
to the Zeta Psi fraternity r . He is also
a member of the Phi Delta Phi law
fraternity, and played in the front
rank on his Freshman team. During
the football seasons of 1907 and 1908
he was a member of the varsity squad,
and won his letter by playing against
the Blue and Gold fifteen in the 21-11
game. Reynolds went North to Wash
ington with the varsity crew two years
ago, and has been identified with row
ing ever since entering the Univer
sity, captaining his Freshman crew
against Berkeley.
The crew men did not journey to
Redwood last Saturday, on account of
the inclement weather and roughness
of the water in the bay. Some very
spirited practicing was indulged in on
Lagunita and Coach Murphy is very
much pleased with the way the men
are working, and looks forward to de
veloping two good crews.
