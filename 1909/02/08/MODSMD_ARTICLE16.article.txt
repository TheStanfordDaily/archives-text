### 
At the Chapel service Sunday morn
ing, the Rev. D. C. Gardner asked the
prayers of all the congregation for
Miss Edith Jordan owing to her recent
bereavement.
Speaking of the Lincoln Day cele
bration, Dr. Gardner urged students to
co-operate loyally with the proposal
and to attend the Assembly.
The chaplain preached l'rom the
text, "And now abideth Faith, Hope
and Love, these three; but the great
est of these is Love."
The preacher proved Love to be na
tive to man. He spoke of mother-love;
the love of home and family. "But
the true object of love is God. Love
in its perfection, exhibited in the life
of Christ, is a life of harmony with
God and of loving service to human
ity. By love we enter upon our in
heritance as children of God. Brother
hood is the practical expression of
love."
Dr. Gardner continued: "I fancy
some of you think of love as some
thing not fitted for every-day use. You
miss the genius of practical Chris
tianity if you do." He quoted from
the Apostle Paul, St. Francis, Glad
stone, Lincoln and Phillips Brooks as
"lovers of the race." Love is not mere
emotion. Love means action. It must
be expressed in terms of service."
"Some one has exquisitely said, 'To
love' is the perfect of the verb, 'to
live.' That is true. For love lifts us
above our lower selves. It gives our
nature new dignity and new power; it
sanctifies our existence; it sweetens
service; it teaches us to live with mal
ice toward none, with charity for all."
Before the sermon, Miss J. Johnson,
'09, sang the solo part to the anthem,
"Oh, For a Closer Walk with God,'
while Miss G. L. Barker rendered
Schuman's "Evening Song" as a vio
lin solo.
