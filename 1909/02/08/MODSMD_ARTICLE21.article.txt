# San Jose Wins First Game of Season.

### 
San Jose Normal School defeated
Stanford Saturday morning in the first
basketball game of the season by the
score of 11 to 4. The visiting team
won an easy victory, scoring on fouls.
This was due to the fact that tho
Stanford team had had but little op
portunity to practice on account of
the weather during the past month.
There were no unusual plays, but the
work of the San Jose jumping center
was good. The second of this series
will be played next Saturday on the
Normal School court at San Jose.

lows: San Jose—Forwards, Miss O.
Reed (captain), Miss A. McCall, Miss
