# No Game with St. Mary's Saturday.
## 
### 
The baseball game scheduled with
St. Mary's College at Oakland last
Saturday afternoon was postponed on
account of rain. The two teams had
slight preliminary practice on the
Oakland diamond, however, before the
postponement of the game. It is hoped
that the unplayed contest can be made
up for at some future date.
Owing to the fact that the Wallabies
game is to be played on Wednesday
afternoon, Coach Presley wishes to an
nounce that the game scheduled for
that date has been called off.
