# STANFORD AGAIN AWARDED MEDAL
## J.E. Shelton, '10 Succeeds in Annexing Seventh Carnot Victory for Cardinal.â€”Excellence of Speeches Pronounced. 
### 
The seventh Carnot medal to be
awarded to a representative of the
Cardinal was last Friday evening pre
sented to J. E. Shelton, '10, who won
the prize from a field of six contest
ants. The successful candidate is well
known in college as a debater of
marked ability and one who has prov
en his aptitude in the long series oi'
forensic contests that he has engaged
in during his attendance at Stanford.
Shelton was a member of the class
teams that represented both his Fresh
man and Sophomore years, while ho
was one of the successful candidates
who made the Carnot trio last year.
As a part of the winning aggregation
that made up the intercollegiate de
bating team representing Stanford
last April, Shelton was a valuable ad
dition to that group of debaters. He
i3 enrolled as a member of Euphronia
Debating Society and the Phi Alpha
Tau debating fraternity. He has act
ed as a representative of his class
upon the Executive Committee, and is
at present upon the board that is edit
ing the 1910 Quad. Shelton is reg
istered as a Pre-legal student from
San Jose.
This year the topic chosen for the
debate of the evening was selected by
the committee in charge from the gen
et al question, "France: Her Relation
to Her Colonies and Dependencies."
Those who made the choice were As
sistant Professor C. A. Huston from
the Law School and R. M. Alden of th<>
Department of English, who collabor
ated with Professors T. R. Bacon, M.
C. Flaherty and C. W. Wells from the
faculty of the University of Califor
nia, and the result of their delibera
tions was the subject for discussion,
"Resolved, That France should ente:*
into negotiations with England, look
ing toward the exchange of French
Indo-China for the West Africa pos
sessions of England." This was a
question unlooked for by the contest
ants, and was for that reason mad-?
more interesting, as it precluded the
general knowledge of the West Af
rican possessions of Great Britain.
This topic was delivered to the can
didates in the Chapel at 6 o'clock,
and the choice of the sides that the
speakers wished to uphold was left
to their selection. This resulted in
the entire Stanford contingent plac
ing themselves upon the negative of
the question, with only one California
man to argue for the affirmative. To
balance this discrepancy, it was de
cided by lot that G. F. Morgan should
speak in collaboration with the lat
ter. The order of the speeches was
also decided by lot, and resulted in
arranging the individuals as follows -
G. F. Morgan, '10, Stanford; D. C.
Boyd, '08, Stanford; B. N. Drury, '12,
California; H. D. Hoover, '09, Califor
nia; A. R. Morgan, '09, California, and
J E. Shelton, *10, Stanford. * G. F.
Morgan and H. D. Hoover proposed the
question from the affirmative point of
view, while the remaining contestants
were aligned upon the opposite side.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen
minutes within which to deliver his
speech, a division of which could be

made, with the one provision that ono
of the speeches must occupy at least
four minutes.
The entire Stanford trio showed
their superiority, both in delivery and
ir; the substance of the arguments
that they advanced, to such an ex
tent that the fight for the coveted
honor was early narrowed to the three
who were representing the Cardinal.
In comparing the methods of the two
types of debating that were advanced
last Friday evening, Stanford will look
forward to another victory in the in
tercollegiate debate, should material
of the same caliber be produced by
the respective institutions at that,
time.
in arguing for the affirmative, G.
F Morgan advanced the contention
that this exchange would not mate
rially benefit the nations involved
commercially and that the transfer
was without peradventure, a politi
cal necessity. As the various coun
tries surrounding these colonies wer<j
all subject to the rule or the surveil
lance of these home nations, the trans
fer would consolidate and unify their
territorial possessions.
As the first speaker upon the neg
ative, Boyd argued that France must
possess some colony into which her
manufactured products can be intro
duced, and that, as Indo-China was
the only dependency that France had
been successful with, that she should
retain it for that purpose.
Drury held that politically and stra
tegically, the exchange would not
benefit either nation or strengthen
their hold upon the colonies now in
their possession. He also argued that
Indo-China was the most important
dependency of France, and for that
reason should be retained.
The next speaker upon the affirm
ative was H. D. Hoover, who main
tained that a balance of power should
be observed in Europe and that this
could be secured by a convenient dis
position of the various colonies under
the control of the nations involved.
A. R. Morgan claimed that the status
quo of the European powers should
be kept at their present standing and
that any such plan as advanced would
overthrow political relations upon the
continent.
As the last speaker upon the nega
tive, Shelton held that France could
not colonize West African territory,
both on account of the climate and
the lack of surplus population in
France. He also contended that
France had expended too much dur
ing the period following the Franco-
Prussian War and that her most ur
gent work now was the proper ad
ministering of these large, but poorlv
governed, territories. Tndo-China,
Shelton claimed, was the most highly
developed, both commercially and po
litically, of all these newly acquired
possessions, and that that territory
should remain French for that reason.
Those who officiated as judges dur
ing the evening were S. G. Tompkins
of San Jose, Rev. Bradford Leavitt
and Philip Bancroft from San Fran
cisco. Professor R. M. Alden presided

didates in the Chapel at 6 o'clock,
and the choice of the sides that the
speakers wished to uphold was left
to their selection. This resulted in
the entire Stanford contingent plac
ing themselves upon the negative of
the question, with only one California
man to argue for the affirmative. To
balance this discrepancy, it was de
cided by lot that G. F. Morgan should
speak in collaboration with the lat
ter. The order of the speeches was
also decided by lot, and resulted in
arranging the individuals as follows -
G. F. Morgan, '10, Stanford; D. C.
Boyd, '08, Stanford; B. N. Drury, '12,
California; H. D. Hoover, '09, Califor
nia; A. R. Morgan, '09, California, and
J E. Shelton, *10, Stanford. * G. F.
Morgan and H. D. Hoover proposed the
question from the affirmative point of
view, while the remaining contestants
were aligned upon the opposite side.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen
minutes within which to deliver his
speech, a division of which could be

made, with the one provision that ono
of the speeches must occupy at least
four minutes.
The entire Stanford trio showed
their superiority, both in delivery and
ir; the substance of the arguments
that they advanced, to such an ex
tent that the fight for the coveted
honor was early narrowed to the three
who were representing the Cardinal.
In comparing the methods of the two
types of debating that were advanced
last Friday evening, Stanford will look
forward to another victory in the in
tercollegiate debate, should material
of the same caliber be produced by
the respective institutions at that,
time.
in arguing for the affirmative, G.
F Morgan advanced the contention
that this exchange would not mate
rially benefit the nations involved
commercially and that the transfer
was without peradventure, a politi
cal necessity. As the various coun
tries surrounding these colonies wer<j
all subject to the rule or the surveil
lance of these home nations, the trans
fer would consolidate and unify their
territorial possessions.
As the first speaker upon the neg
ative, Boyd argued that France must
possess some colony into which her
manufactured products can be intro
duced, and that, as Indo-China was
the only dependency that France had
been successful with, that she should
retain it for that purpose.
Drury held that politically and stra
tegically, the exchange would not
benefit either nation or strengthen
their hold upon the colonies now in
their possession. He also argued that
Indo-China was the most important
dependency of France, and for that
reason should be retained.
The next speaker upon the affirm
ative was H. D. Hoover, who main
tained that a balance of power should
be observed in Europe and that this
could be secured by a convenient dis
position of the various colonies under
the control of the nations involved.
A. R. Morgan claimed that the status
quo of the European powers should
be kept at their present standing and
that any such plan as advanced would
overthrow political relations upon the
continent.
As the last speaker upon the nega
tive, Shelton held that France could
not colonize West African territory,
both on account of the climate and
the lack of surplus population in
France. He also contended that
France had expended too much dur
ing the period following the Franco-
Prussian War and that her most ur
gent work now was the proper ad
ministering of these large, but poorlv
governed, territories. Tndo-China,
Shelton claimed, was the most highly
developed, both commercially and po
litically, of all these newly acquired
possessions, and that that territory
should remain French for that reason.
Those who officiated as judges dur
ing the evening were S. G. Tompkins
of San Jose, Rev. Bradford Leavitt
and Philip Bancroft from San Fran
cisco. Professor R. M. Alden presided
The seventh Carnot medal to be
awarded to a representative of the
Cardinal was last Friday evening pre
sented to J. E. Shelton, '10, who won
the prize from a field of six contest
ants. The successful candidate is well
known in college as a debater of
marked ability and one who has prov
en his aptitude in the long series oi'
forensic contests that he has engaged
in during his attendance at Stanford.
Shelton was a member of the class
teams that represented both his Fresh
man and Sophomore years, while ho
was one of the successful candidates
who made the Carnot trio last year.
As a part of the winning aggregation
that made up the intercollegiate de
bating team representing Stanford
last April, Shelton was a valuable ad
dition to that group of debaters. He
i3 enrolled as a member of Euphronia
Debating Society and the Phi Alpha
Tau debating fraternity. He has act
ed as a representative of his class
upon the Executive Committee, and is
at present upon the board that is edit
ing the 1910 Quad. Shelton is reg
istered as a Pre-legal student from
San Jose.
This year the topic chosen for the
debate of the evening was selected by
the committee in charge from the gen
et al question, "France: Her Relation
to Her Colonies and Dependencies."
Those who made the choice were As
sistant Professor C. A. Huston from
the Law School and R. M. Alden of th<>
Department of English, who collabor
ated with Professors T. R. Bacon, M.
C. Flaherty and C. W. Wells from the
faculty of the University of Califor
nia, and the result of their delibera
tions was the subject for discussion,
"Resolved, That France should ente:*
into negotiations with England, look
ing toward the exchange of French
Indo-China for the West Africa pos
sessions of England." This was a
question unlooked for by the contest
ants, and was for that reason mad-?
more interesting, as it precluded the
general knowledge of the West Af
rican possessions of Great Britain.
