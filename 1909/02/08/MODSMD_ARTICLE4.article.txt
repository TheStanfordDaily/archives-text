# CRACK PLAYERS WIN
## WALLABIES DEFEAT CALIFORNIA BY SCORE OF 27-0. Tricky Game Played by Clever Australian Team.â€”Swift Passing Feature of Contest. 
### 
The crack Wallabies fifteen of Aus
tralia made their first appearance in
America last Saturday afternoon on
California Field, in a good game of
Rugby with the University of Califor
nia team. Although the muddy field
and heavy downpour were very un
favorable to a fast game, a flue exhi
bition of Rugby was witnessed, and
the University players were forced to
take the short end of a 27-0 score.
Most of the scoring was made in
the first half, as California rallied af
ter half-time, putting up a fine de
fence and falling on the ball at op
portune moments. Although the Cali
fornia team threatened the Wallabies'
line, they lacked the scoring ability.
The clever, tricky work and accurate
passing of the Australians proved a
feature of the contest. The speed with
which the Wallabies covered the
ground, despite the condition of the'
field and the excellent punting was a
surprise to all.
In spite of the fact that a heavv
rain was falling while the game was
in progress, a good crowd witnessed
the contest. Among this number were
Coach G. Presley, ex-Coach J. F. Lan
agan, Captain-elect M. Mitchell and
other members of the varsity squad.
A light practice will be held this
afternoon by the varsity in prepara
tion for Wednesday's game.
The showing made by the Wallabies
last Saturday has created much dis
cussion as to the relative merits of
the two teams. Experts in San Fran
cisco state that on a dry field the
score for Wednesday should be as
large as that of the first game, but on
a wet field it is expected that the var
sity will be able to hold them down
better than the California team, which
was not as strong as their varsity of
last semester, owing to the fact that
it was largely made up of Freshmen.
Although the local men do not wish
to make any prediction as to the out
come of the game, it is the general
consensus of opinion that Stanford
should cross the Wallabies' line at
least once. The varsity will be able
to put up a strong defence, and it is
believed that the pack is heavy enough
to hold the Australians down.
