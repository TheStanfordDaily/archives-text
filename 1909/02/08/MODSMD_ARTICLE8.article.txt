In adopting the plan for the con
trol of the 1911 Quad, it would ap
pear that a scheme has been fount
that should work out to advantage.
In their choice, the present Sopho
more class has eliminated several of
the undesirable features of past
Quads and has placed the entire com
pilation upon a basis which is tar
more businesslike than any yet tried
The success or failure of the plan
will depend largely, however, upon the
individuals chosen and elected to fill
the created positions. In the choice
of the editor and manager, probably
the greatest interest will center, but
the importance of selecting an unbi
ased and thoroughly competent Hoard
ol Control should not be forgotten.
This body is vested with large powers,
and if in accord with both manager
and editor of the book can do a great
amount of good.
