# MAY ENTER NEW MEET
## STANFORD INVITED TO SEND TEAM TO SEATTLE. Alaska-Yukon Exposition Authorities Want Cardinal Represented at Track Meet in June. 
### 
In addition it) a repetition of the
trip to the Chicago Conference meet
in June, which, from the success of
test spring, will doubtless be repeated
this summer, the track athletes are
now considering the possibility of en
tering a Stanford team in the inter
collegiate track meet in Seattle, whic>i
is to form an important feature of
the athletic division of the Alaska-
Yukon-Pacific Exposition.
Track Captain Horton is in receipt
of a communication from Milnor Rob
erts, chairman of the sub-committee
on college athletics, urging that Stan
ford send a team ito compete in the
regular track meet, which will be held
some time in June., the date to be
fixed to suit ihe convenience of the
majority of those wSUo signify their
intention of entering.
The track men are desirous of ar
ranging the schedule <of the eastern
trip, so that the return coald be made
by way of Seattle in time to partici
jtfite in the track events there, where
the Cardinal athletes would again
meet some of the best men on the Pa
cific Coast and from the Middle West,
in addition to a number of eastern
athletes who have expressed their in
tention of attending the meet. If the
date of the Seattle contest is placed
late enough to enable the Stanford
contingent to include this stop in its
itinerary on the return trip from the
Western Conference meet, there would
be little additional expense entailed
in entering this contest.
The Exposition meet will be exclu
sively for college men. but the en
tries are open to individuals as weli
as regularly constituted university
teams. In addition to the standard
track and field events, there will be
several special features in the way of
relay and cross-country races, base
ball, basketball and tennis matches,
besides boxing and wrestling. Special
individual medals will be awarded in
all events as well as the regular team
cups.
As there is little doubt that there
will be two or more Stanford crews
entered in the intercollegiate boat
races, which will form a part of the
aquatic carnival upon the opening
days of the Exposition, the presence
of a Stanford track team a few weeks
later would enable the University to
bo well represented throughout the
larger part of the four weeks of ath
letics planned for the Exposition.
If present weather conditions con
tinue, the (irst preliminary track meet,
which was indefinitely postponed from
last Wednesday, will be held next
Tuesday afternoon.
