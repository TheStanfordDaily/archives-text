## 
### 
President David Starr Jordan lias
sent a communication to all the fra
ternities suggesting various plans by
which the standard of scholarship can
lie raised. He quotes rules which have
been advanced at other universities,
;lnd suggests, among other things, that
local fraternities adopt some plan by
which new members shall be selected
only from those whose scholarship
standing has been determined in the
University, il the standard of the
chapter has fallen below that of the
remainder of the University. The let
ter was considered by several chap
ters last night, but nothing definite
has been done in regard to the com
munication as yet.
