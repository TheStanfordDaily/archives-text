# SANTA CLARA GAME ON FRIDAY.
## Varsity Will Face College Team Away from Campus.â€”Class Games Will Start Soon. 
### 
An important change has been made
in the program of baseball games for
this week. Manager Stewart has can
celled the game with St. Mary's Col
lege scheduled for tomorrow after
noon, on account of its conflicting with
the Wallabies Rugby game. He has
also changed the game with Santo,
Clara, set for next Saturday afternoon,
to Friday afternoon at Santa Clara.
This arrangement leaves Saturday free
fiom all athletic contests, in order
that students may attend the All-Cali
fornia-Wallabies match in San Fran
cisco.
It has been the desire of Manager
Stewart to give the Student Body as
many games on the campus as pos
sible this season. All games can
celled or lost on account of weather
conditions will be made up, and a few
extra matches added, if they can be
arranged.
Coach Presley has set the first of
the interclass baseball games for next
week. The series will be played on
the Faculty diamond, and the first
teams to face each other will be tho
Sophomores and Freshmen. The full
schedule of games has not yet been
made out.
