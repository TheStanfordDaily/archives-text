# PLAY INTERCLASS SINGLES.
## Tournament Nearing Close.â€”Drawing for Doubles Matches to Be Held Thursday. 
### 
Two more matches of the interclass
tennis singles were played off last Sat
urday. W. R. Domaschenz, '12, de
feated W. F. Geary, '12, in the Fresh
man singles by a score of 6-4, 7-5. The
contestants were evenly matched and
some exciting rallies resulted. H. S.
Morgan, '12, defeated W. E. Ferguson,
'12, by a score of 6-4, 6-8, 6-2. Fergu
son was handicapped by being out of
practice, but put up a game contest.
He made many fine returns in the sec
ond set, using forehand and back
hand drives with equal facility. Mor
gan's superior steadiness was respon
sible for his victory in the deciding
set of the match.
Only the finals now remain to be
played in the Freshman class, Mor
gan being scheduled to meet Doma
schenz. This match is likely to be a
close one, for, although Domaschenz
has not a great variety of strokes, he
hits the ball hard and places his shots
well.
In the Sophomore finals W. H. Mc-
Connell, '11, meets R. Steinbergh, '11.
In the Senior class, R. A. Gott, '09,
will meet F. A. Parton, '09, the winner
of which match will play the success
ful contestant of the match between
A J. Gowan, '09, and E. Jordan. H.
Mann, '10, has already won the Junior
class match, and will meet the Senior
champion.
The tournament committee has de
cided to close the doubles entries
Thursday night, when the drawing
will be held. This will enable the
men to play the doubles matches
without loss of time, in the event of
fair weather from Friday to Monday.
