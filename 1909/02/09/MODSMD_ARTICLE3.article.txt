# VARSITY AND WALLABIES MEET ON STANFORD FIELD
## Expert Australians Will Contest With Local Holders of Coast International Rugby Championship. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 on
Stanford Field ihe Wallaby team, Rug
hy champions of the Antipodes, will
.meet the varsity fifteen, Rugby cham
pions of America, in an international
.contest. The game will begin prompt
ly at 3:30, as ihe Wallabies desire to
return to San Francisco on an early
train.
Unusual interest is being manifest
' eel in tomorrow's game, owing to the
' ifact that it is an international con
[ .test and also to the fame of the vis
| itors. The Wallabies are an all-star
aggregation, being the pick of all the
Australian teams. Every man in the
ljue-up has won his place only by the
most brilliant sort of playing. In ad
dition to the fact that each player is
an individual star, the fifteen has de
veloped team work to a remarkable
degree, the play of the Wallabies be
ing clock'like in its accuracy and pre
cision. The speed and aggressiveness
of the visitors, combined with their
weight and cleverness in executing
trick plays, has given them a fore
most place among the Rugby teams of
the world. The ability of the team is
clearly indicated by the fact that out
of 33 games which the Wallabies have
played during their tour of the world,
they have won 25 and lost but 5, and
tied 1, 2 being abandoned on account
of adverse weather conditions.
The formation affected by the Aus
tralians is one that is new to the fol
lowers of the game in California, al
though it is used quite largely in Eng
land, Wales and Australia. No wing
forward is played, all the forwards
being used in the scrum. Thus, an
eight-man scrum is played, arranged
as follows: Three men at front raiiK,
two at lock and three at, rear rank
The arrangement in the back field is
also somewhat different from ours,
the difference being that but one mar.
is played at five, and four are placed
in the three-quarter line, which plan
is said to possess many advantages
in the execution of the passing rushes
for which the Australians are famous.
A comparison of the Wallabies with
the Varsity shows that while the visit
ors outweigh the local players but
little in the forward division, they
have a decided advantage in the back
field. Both packs average 185 pounds,
but tlie Cardinal backs are lighter by
JO pounds to the man than their op
ponents. This difference in weigh:
will give the Wallabies a decided ad
vantage in offensive playing, hut the
speed and aggressiveness of the Car
dinal backs will do much to offset this
difference in weight. With but on»>
exception, the line-up of the Australi
ans will be tlie same as in the contest
with California.
The Varsity is'in splendid condition
and is ready to give the Wallabies a
hard, close fight . Coach Presley ha -
decided to retain the formation that
lias been used by Stanford in the past,
he believes that, a seven-man scrum
is more effective in getting the ball
out to the backs than is the eight

man formation. With the pack com
posed of Terrill, McGregor, Dole,
Crawford, Minturn, Thorpe, Cheda and
Miller, Stanford should have an even
break with the visitors in the forward
division. The backfleld will be made
up of Scott, Mitchell, Ganong, Roth,
Holman, Cook, and F. Brown —a back
field that has demonstrated its abil
ity to make gains against even the
strongest defense. The Wallabies are
anticipating one of the hardest strug
gles that they have encountered dur
ing their trip, and the line-up of the
Varsity is sufficient guarantee that the
visitors will not be disappointed in
this regard.
The plans for entertaining the vis
itors have been completed by Manage.
Stewart. The team will arrive in Palo
Alto tomorrow morning about 10, and
will be met at the station and driven
around the campus during the remain
der of the forenoon. In the evening
the visitors will be taken to San Fran
cisco and entertained at a theater par
ty at the Orpheum.
The game will be refereed by Cap
tain H. E. Elliott of the Barbarian
team, while A. H. Moverly and J.
Woods, both of San Francisco, will act
as linesmen. An admission of fifty
cents will lie charged.
The line-ups:
Stanford—Terrill, McGregor, front
rank; Dole, lock; Crawford, Minturn,
side rank; Thorpe, Cheda, rear rank,
Miller, wing forward; Scott, half;
Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Roth, center;
Cook, Holman, wings; F. Brown, full.
Wallabies—Richards, Gavin, Row,
Middleton, McCue, Griffin, Harnett
Hammond, forwards; McKevatt, half.
McCabe, five; Dix, Hickey, Prentice,
Russell, three-quarters; Carmichae),
full.
Manager Stewart states that the
game will i>e held as scheduled, in
spite of rain, hail or snow, and ex
pects a large crowd down from San
Francisco, as the number who wit
j nessed the match at Berkeley last
I Saturday, when the weather conditions
were extremely adverse, was large.

aggregation, being the pick of all the
Australian teams. Every man in the
ljue-up has won his place only by the
most brilliant sort of playing. In ad
dition to the fact that each player is
an individual star, the fifteen has de
veloped team work to a remarkable
degree, the play of the Wallabies be
ing clock'like in its accuracy and pre
cision. The speed and aggressiveness
of the visitors, combined with their
weight and cleverness in executing
trick plays, has given them a fore
most place among the Rugby teams of
the world. The ability of the team is
clearly indicated by the fact that out
of 33 games which the Wallabies have
played during their tour of the world,
they have won 25 and lost but 5, and
tied 1, 2 being abandoned on account
of adverse weather conditions.
The formation affected by the Aus
tralians is one that is new to the fol
lowers of the game in California, al
though it is used quite largely in Eng
land, Wales and Australia. No wing
forward is played, all the forwards
being used in the scrum. Thus, an
eight-man scrum is played, arranged
as follows: Three men at front raiiK,
two at lock and three at, rear rank
The arrangement in the back field is
also somewhat different from ours,
the difference being that but one mar.
is played at five, and four are placed
in the three-quarter line, which plan
is said to possess many advantages
in the execution of the passing rushes
for which the Australians are famous.
A comparison of the Wallabies with
the Varsity shows that while the visit
ors outweigh the local players but
little in the forward division, they
have a decided advantage in the back
field. Both packs average 185 pounds,
but tlie Cardinal backs are lighter by
JO pounds to the man than their op
ponents. This difference in weigh:
will give the Wallabies a decided ad
vantage in offensive playing, hut the
speed and aggressiveness of the Car
dinal backs will do much to offset this
difference in weight. With but on»>
exception, the line-up of the Australi
ans will be tlie same as in the contest
with California.
The Varsity is'in splendid condition
and is ready to give the Wallabies a
hard, close fight . Coach Presley ha -
decided to retain the formation that
lias been used by Stanford in the past,
he believes that, a seven-man scrum
is more effective in getting the ball
out to the backs than is the eight

man formation. With the pack com
posed of Terrill, McGregor, Dole,
Crawford, Minturn, Thorpe, Cheda and
Miller, Stanford should have an even
break with the visitors in the forward
division. The backfleld will be made
up of Scott, Mitchell, Ganong, Roth,
Holman, Cook, and F. Brown —a back
field that has demonstrated its abil
ity to make gains against even the
strongest defense. The Wallabies are
anticipating one of the hardest strug
gles that they have encountered dur
ing their trip, and the line-up of the
Varsity is sufficient guarantee that the
visitors will not be disappointed in
this regard.
The plans for entertaining the vis
itors have been completed by Manage.
Stewart. The team will arrive in Palo
Alto tomorrow morning about 10, and
will be met at the station and driven
around the campus during the remain
der of the forenoon. In the evening
the visitors will be taken to San Fran
cisco and entertained at a theater par
ty at the Orpheum.
The game will be refereed by Cap
tain H. E. Elliott of the Barbarian
team, while A. H. Moverly and J.
Woods, both of San Francisco, will act
as linesmen. An admission of fifty
cents will lie charged.
The line-ups:
Stanford—Terrill, McGregor, front
rank; Dole, lock; Crawford, Minturn,
side rank; Thorpe, Cheda, rear rank,
Miller, wing forward; Scott, half;
Mitchell, Ganong, fives; Roth, center;
Cook, Holman, wings; F. Brown, full.
Wallabies—Richards, Gavin, Row,
Middleton, McCue, Griffin, Harnett
Hammond, forwards; McKevatt, half.
McCabe, five; Dix, Hickey, Prentice,
Russell, three-quarters; Carmichae),
full.
Manager Stewart states that the
game will i>e held as scheduled, in
spite of rain, hail or snow, and ex
pects a large crowd down from San
Francisco, as the number who wit
j nessed the match at Berkeley last
I Saturday, when the weather conditions
were extremely adverse, was large.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 on
Stanford Field ihe Wallaby team, Rug
hy champions of the Antipodes, will
.meet the varsity fifteen, Rugby cham
pions of America, in an international
.contest. The game will begin prompt
ly at 3:30, as ihe Wallabies desire to
return to San Francisco on an early
train.
