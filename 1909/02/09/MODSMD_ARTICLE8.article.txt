Tomorrow is a notable date in
the football history of t'his State and,
technically speaking, of the United
States. The fifteen men who wear
the Cardinal constitute probably the
best team of this country, and tha
Wallabies are the recognized experts
of Australia. The occasion calls for a
large attendance upon the part of the
Student Body.
We have been told by the coach and
trainer that the men are in good con
dition, and it is also believed that the
visitors are not invincible, as it was
first supposed when they landed on
this continent.
The men who fight for Stanford
compose one of the best fifteens ever
turned out here. The men are all tried
and capable. They realize that they
have the hardest kind of a struggle
before them and the most optimistic
is loath to predict anything resem
bling a victory ov even a tie. The duty
of the undergraduates and members
of the community is to be on the
bleachers and encourage the men on
beyond their present expectations.
Stanford has not the weight or
speed, perhaps, nor the experience in
Rugby of our opponents. We have
spirit, a good working knowledge of
the game and a training acquired from
years of the old game, which, when
used as the men have been instructed,
should serve to offset the tricks of our
visitors.
In short, the varsity is to fight a
game tomorrow which will he all up
hill from the start. Let them have
support worthy of their efforts.
