# ARRANGES NEW DATES
## MANAGER STEWART COMPILING PROGRAM FOR FRESHMEN. Meet with St. Mary's College Fixed and Two Other Institutions on Probable List. 
### 
The Freshman track squad will, as
in the past, have the advantage of one,
and probably two or three, prelimin
ary meets before its contest with the
State University's class of 1912. Man
ager Stewart today stated he has
made definite arrangements with St.
Mary's College for a meet to take
place on March 6. This is inviting a
r.ew competitor, as it is the first time
a Freshman team has ever met. ath
letes from that college on the cinders.
The manager of the Oakland High
School has asked for February 27 as
a date for his men, and a satisfactory
reply has been sent by Manager Stew
art, but as yet no definite arrange
ments have been made. In all prob
ability, however, this prospect will
become a reality and the Freshmen
will be pitted against the preparatory
school men.
Manager Stewart has also written to
the University of the Pacific, with the
intention of securing March 17 as .i
date for a third meet, but has as yet
received no reply.
If these contests are successfully
arranged, they will complete the
Freshman schedule for the season, as
there is neither time nor necessity for
more. In case these negotiations with
Oakland High School and the Univer
sity of the Pacific are not made defi
nite, an attempt will probably be
made to arrange meets with some
other local schools.
