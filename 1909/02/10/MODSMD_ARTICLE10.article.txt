The amount of attention which is
given to music in this University is
.shockingly small, as compared with
that at any other large institution
of learning and culture in this coun
try. The opportunities afforded un
dergraduates to hear good music us
produced by outside talent is practi
cally nil 1, the only exception beint,
two or three concerts during th«•
course of a year. This is regret
table, but, at the same time it is doubt
ful if possible of an immediate rem
edy. What we do believe, however,
that more encouragement should be
extended to the musically inclined to
follow their pursuit at. Stanford and
that members of the community should
give more support to any who may
seek this end.
We learn that an attempt is being
made by a number to inaugurate .1
festival of music during the coming
semester, and that the amount, of sup
port received from local individuals is
discouraging. This attempt to have a
big gathering of musicions and a pro
duction of harmonies is but a start
toward a wider musical education, an 1
if the idea is given encouragement
it will undoubtedly lead to that most
necessary constituent of perfect cul
ture —music.
.lust to. point out specifically how
far behind other institutions Stanford
is in this respect, we would call at
tention to our rival university at

Berkeley. Here, a department is main
tained by the regents, and scarcely u
holiday or Sunday passes that
musical treat is not offered. It is cor
rect that the facilities of the Greek
Theater are conducive to elaborate
performances, and the proximity to
San Francisco, to frequent ones; bin,
nevertheless, if we had the true de
sire and fostered it conscientiously in
this community, we would soon have
the Assembly Hall a center of a mu
sical circle that would have, first, a
beneficial effect, tending toward re
finement, on the local community, and
would, secondly, propagate the name
of Stanford as a true University to
many who now have little interest in
the institution.
It is a large question to solve, and
and as such should be attacked im
mediately and at the most vulnerable
point. We offer our support to the
coming festival, to the musical organ
izations of the Student Body and shov,
to the trustees and others in charge
that the community is ready and de
serving of more and immediate atten
tion in this department of education.
