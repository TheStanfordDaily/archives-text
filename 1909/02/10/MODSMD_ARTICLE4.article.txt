# WALLABIES 13: STANFORD 3
## AUSTRALIANS WIN HARDFOUGHT RUGBY CONTEST International Experts Out-point Varsity in Close Game Played on Slippery Field in Pouring Rain. 
### 
In a driving rain and on a field thar.
resembled a lake, the Varsity battled
for eighty minutes this afternoon
against the world-famous Wallaby
team of Australia, and was only re
turned a loser by the small score of
13 to 3. From the initial kick-off un
til the gun ended the contest, the
struggle raged up and down the field
with unremitting fierceness. The slop
py condition of the field made the
game altogether a contest between
the opposing packs, and made it im
possible for the respective back fields
to participate in any continuous pass
ing rushes.
As an exhibition of the Rugby game,
the contest was disappointing. This
was due to the inclement weather,
which prevented both fifteens from ex
hibiting their customary form. The
muddiness of the field made a fast,
snappy game impossible and reduced
the contest to a rough and tumble fight
between the rival forwards. The
whirlwind passing, rushes and bril
liant runs, which would have occurred
on a dry field, were out of the ques
tion. But in spite of these drawbacks,
the international game will long be
remembered as one of the most excit
ing and fiercely contested matches
ever held on Stanford Field.
The score is not an accurate index
of the relative playing of the two
teams, for the contest was much clos
er than the final tallies would indi
cate. After the first few moments of
play, the Cardinal players struck their
gait, and from that time on played a
strong offensive as well as defensive
game. Although outweighed by their
more seasoned opponents, they forced
the play time and again into the ene
mies' territory, and on several occa
sions the Australians were forced to
touch-down. The game today clearly
indicated that with a little more ex
perience. the varsity could compete
with the crack fifteens of the world.
The showing made by the Cardinal
players today places the Stanford fif
teen, even with its limited experience
of the game, on a favorable interna
tional footing.
It would, indeed, be hard to pick out
the individual stars of the two teams,
for every member of the respective
fifteens played a strong, aggressive
game. The brunt of the battle fell
largely on the forward divisions, but
both backfields did valiant work in
supporting their comrades. Only the
highest praise can be given to the
men of both teams today for their
effective work under the extremely un
favorable conditions that prevailed.
Stanford played a wonderful defen
sive game. The game, by plays, fol
