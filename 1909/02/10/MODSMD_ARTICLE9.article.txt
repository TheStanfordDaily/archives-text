The men of Stanford, who fought
under most adverse conditions this
afternoon and succeeded in holding
down and forcing an all-star team to
play their utmost for every inch of
tlie slippery field, are worthy of the
highest praise. They have placed the
name of their University before the
world as a capable exponent of a game
which, three years ago, was entirely
new here. As champions of this Coast,
the men of our Varsity ably defended
their position.
