# AWARD CARNOT FOBS
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE GRANTS EMBLEMS TO DEBATE US. Student Body President and Junior Representative to Be Ex-Officio Members of Clubhouse Board. 
### 
The absence of several members in
San Francisco prevented the Executive
Committee from transacting any im
portant business at its regular weekly
meeting last night. Unofficial cogniz
ance was taken, however, of some
matters that will come up for con
sideration at the next few meetings
of the committee.
Medals, in the form of the regula
tion watch fob, were awarded to the
men who represented Stanford in the
recent Car not contest with the Univer
sity of California: D. C. Boyd, '08, G.
F. Morgan, '10, and J. E. Shelton, '10.
A suggestion that these emblems be
cast somewhat heavier than in the
past was made to the Graduate Man
ager.
Following out the idea outlined by
H C. Hoover, '95, for the organization
of a permanent board, having as its
object the advancement of the club
house project, the Executive Commit
tee formulated a plan under which the
two student members of that body will
be selected. The Student Body pres
ident and the Junior representative
on the Executive Committee, who is
chosen at the first semester election,
will be ex-officio members of the Club
house Committee. Accordingly, A. E.
Roth, '09, and C. H. Hails, '10, will be
associated this year with the three
alumni and two faculty members, who
complete the board. This body will
take up the active work of securing
the fund necessary to the erection of
the proposed clubhouse as soon as
its organization has been perfected.
Several matters pertaining to the
intercollegiate Regatta next April
v ere discussed, but no definite action
was taken. Whether or not the crew
races are to be held ou the Oakland
Estuary will be decided shortly. Fi
nancial considerations seem to favor
the estuary over the old Sausolito
course, and the technical objections to
the former are not as strong as in the
past. Both courses will be traversed
by a Student Body representative and
their relative merits reported on.
