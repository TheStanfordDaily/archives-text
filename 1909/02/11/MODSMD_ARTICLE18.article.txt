# FIX DATES FOR TRYOUTS.
## Cast and Chorus for Junior Opera to Be Selected Next Week. 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior Opera
Committee held last night at the Pi
Beta Phi house, the dates for the Opera
tryouts were definitely settled.
The women's tryouts will be held
Tuesday, February 16, from 4 to 6
1). m., in the Chapel, and on Wednes
day, February 17, from 1 to 3 p. m.,
at the same place. The men's try
outs will be held Wednesday, Febru
ary 17, from 3 to G p. m., in the Chap
el. All participants are asked to bring
their own accompanist. For those
who cannot do so, the committee will
provide one.
Everybody trying out, whether for
chorus or cast, is requested to be on
hand as early as possible, because the
committee would prefer to have all
tryouts through with by Thursday,
thus being able to commence rehear
sals by the first of the following week.
Several new manuscripts were sub
mitted last night, and a number of the
authors were present and read selec
tions from their operas to the com
mittee. The committee has on hand
two or three very creditable books,
with music which is both original and
from the best of this year's New York
opera successes.
The committee has just about de
cided upon a professional coach of
wide experience, whose name will be
announced later. He will direct both
the dramatic and the musical part of
the opera.
Friday night, February 12, is the
final date set by the committee for
consideration of manuscripts.
