# ST. VINCENT'S WANTS GAMES.
## Southern College Sends G. Stoney to Secure Baseball Dates with Stanford Varsity. 
### 
George Stoney, a prominent ath
lete of St. Vincent's College, is on the
campus for the purpose of securing
some baseball dates for his college
with the Stanford team.
When the baseball schedule was
first announced by Manager Stewart,
St. Vincent's was given three games,
one in Los Angeles and two on the
campus. These dates were subse
quently found to conflict with the
southern college's arrangements, and
sr. were called off and the idea of the
Varsity taking its annual trip to Lou
Angeles was given up. If, however,
Stoney and Manager Stewart can fin 1
some mutually satisfactory dates,
some games will probably be ar
ranged and the team will get its
southern trip. Stoney also intends
visiting California for a purpose sim
ilar to his here.
