# College Terrace Scene of Fire.
## 
### 
A Are of accidental origin last night
destroyed the house formerly occupied
by the Cardinal Club at College Ter
race. The overturning of a gasoline
stove in the cottage adjoining started
the blaze, and before the Mayfield Vol
unteer Fire Department could reach
the scene, the house was more than
half destroyed. Fortunately, the build
ing was uninhabited, and the loss is
confined solely to the structure itself.
