# Miss Everts Reads in Class.

### 
Miss Everts was kind enough to give
Dr. Anderson's English 10 a reading
from Shakespeare yesterday afternoon
at the hour of the usual lecture. Miss
Everts' selection, "Twelfth Night,"
was especially appropriate, as the
class has just finished the study of this
play. Owing to the time, Miss Everts
was able to read only through the
third act, even then devoting more
than an hour to the class. Her ren
dering of the comedy was, as usual,
beyond criticism, and her interpreta
tion of the characters faultless.
