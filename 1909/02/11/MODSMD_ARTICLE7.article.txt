# Statistic Cards Have Arrived.
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office has received
a delayed shipment of blanks from the
Immigration Commission, known as
the cards for the "Educational In
quiry" at Washington. These cards
are being sent to all the colleges and
universities in the United States, and
when filled out will be a complete re
port of the vital statistics of all uni
versity students in the country.
The cards were to have been here
on Registration day, January 5, but
either through a misunderstanding or
a delay in transit, they did not get
here until this morning. The original
plan was that they were to be filled
out at the same time that registration
was being made for the second sem
ester.
As the cards are now in the Regis
trar's Office, the request is made thac
every student call and fill out one at.
his earliest convenience.
