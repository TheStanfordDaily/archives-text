### 
The Sophomore class met today for
the purpose of nominating Quad offi
cers. A contest for the editorship re
sulted, but only one candidate was
nominated for manager. The nomina
tions were: Editor, L. L. Hill, by G.
Holcomb, and E. C. Matlhais, by G.
Bevier; Manager, C. A. Christ!tl, by J.
E. Thompson. The election will be
held next Tuesday on the Quad, from
11:15 to 2:30 o'clock.
It was decided by a majority vote
that only those who have paid this
semester's assessment will lie permit
ted to vote at the coming election. A
question of the legality of the Quad
contract between the manager and the
class was discussed. Two articles
were reconstructed. A clause of Ar
ticle II was revised to read: "All Quae
expenses of the editor, . . ." The
clause of Article IV, which called for
$1000 to be expended for cuts, was
revised so that the cost of organiza
tion cuts may now be included in the
$1000 to be expended.
The treasurer's report was read,
which showed that only $41.45 has
been collected of the last assessment
and a balance of $9.45 in the treasury.
President F. H. Hilton urged every
body to pay immediately.
