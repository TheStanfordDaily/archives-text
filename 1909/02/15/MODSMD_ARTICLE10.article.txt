The same difficulty which has been
experienced previously in turning out
the best possible Freshman eight will
confront Coach Dan Murphy this year,
ii: the number of men who have thus
far responded to try for places in the
first-year boat is not augmented. Last
year Stanford had a winning Fresh
man eight, but all during the season
the final result was a matter of the
gravest concern to the coaches be
cause of the fact that only enough
Freshmen turned out to afford a very
small possibility of choice in picking
the crew.
Thus far the number of men who
have signed up for rowing from the
1012 class is entirely inadequate. With
the list as small as it is at present,
siml as a certain number of aspirants
are bound to be found unable to fill
the exactions of the season, the sit
uation demands attention.
The season is not far advanced, and
any who can be induced to join the
ranks should make up their minds to
come out now and get the full benefit
of Dan Murphy's preliminary instruc
tions. There are plenty of likely can
didates in the 1912 class, and thev
should be seen in the squad tomor
row night.
