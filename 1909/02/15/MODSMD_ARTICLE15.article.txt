mon from the Unitarian standpoint.

Dr. Crooker said in part: "I asic
no more for the basis of my altar
than is necessary for the scientist as
he interprets nature. It is tlie as
sumption of every discoverer that he
can find an intelligent reason for ev
erything, and that is all 1 need as a
basis for my religion.
"At the very heart of things there
ir, a throb of Love. The great thing
of all is not the far-off star, but the
human soul at this end of the tele
scope. We must have an interpretation
of the universe that is large enough
to include the human soul.
"A more glorious gospel, a more
blessed God, is that which we neeil
to enlarge us, to distend us, to puri
fy us, to clarify us and prepare us
i'or the tasks of the twentieth century,
so that we may serve God and Man
as we ought. This is the foundation
in the nature of things of a more
blessed gospel and a more blessed
God."
