# Opera Tryouts in Assembly Hall.
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Opera Commit
tee- held today it was decided tlwit the
tryouts would be conducted along the
same general lines as last year. Those
trying out for principals are asked
to bring an accompanist, and will be
expected to sing a solo. Those try
ing for chorus places may sing in
groups. The place for the tryouts has
l.een changed from the Chapel to the
Assembly Hall. The committee has
postponed the selection of the manu
script for a few days, and rehearsals
will commence Saturday, February 20.
