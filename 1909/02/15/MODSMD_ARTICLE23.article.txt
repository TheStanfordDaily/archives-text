# DEFEAT SANTA CLARA
## VARSITY WINS SATURDAY GAME BY SCORE OF 2 TO 1. Fast Match Held on Collegians' Diamond Marked by Heavy Hitting by Local Batters. 
### 
The second game between the Var
sity and the Santa Clara College nine,
played on the latter's diamond last
Saturday afternoon, resulted in a vic
tory for Stanford by the score of %
to 1. Heavy hitting and accurate
fielding on the part of both sides char
acterized the contest, which required
but one hour and thirty minutes to
conclude. The excellent condition of
the grounds made fast play possible.
Smith, who officiated in the box for
the Varsity, was accorded strong sup
port, particularly by the infielders. His
pitching was effective, and after
first inning, when the Santa Clarans
gleaned three hits from his delivery,
he allowed but two bingles. The Var
sity secured seven scattered hits from
the offerings of Friene, but inability
to bunch these prevented a larger
score.
Captain Sampson played his usual
star game at shortstop, and further
distinguished himself by hitting safe
three times out of four at bat. Fresh
man Canterbury, who substituted for
Mitchell behind the bat, acquitted him
self creditably. Aside from Mitchell's
absence, the respective line-ups were
the same as in the initial game of the
season.
For Santa Clara, Peters and Friene
succeeded in upholding their reputa
tion as hard hitters, each one hav
ing procured two hits.
Santa Clara initiated the scoring
in the first inning. Peters, the first
man to face Smith, reached third on
a triple and came home on Shaefer's
clean single. This ended the run
getting for the Collegians.
Stanford tallied once in the fourth
and again in the fifth frame. In the
fourth inning Ball singled, advanced
to third on two steals and reached
home on Reem's error. The winning
run was made by Bell in the follow
ing inning. The Cardinal first base
man was able to reach first on Dono
van's error. He stole second, and
tallied on Sampson's hit and a timely
sacrifice by Ball.
The summary follows: R. H. E.
Stanford 2 7 1
Santa Clara 1 5 2
Struck out—By Smith, 1; by Friene,
7 Umpire—Walters. Time of game—
1 hour and 30 minutes.
