# HONOR MEMORY OF LINCOLN
## EXERCISES OF FRIDAY HOLIDAY IS MARKED BY IMPRESSIVE ASSEMBLY. Appropriate Speeches and Program Given at Unique Student Body Gathering. 
### 
Stanford's first Assembly in com
memoration of Lincoln Day was fit
tingly held at Assembly Hall last Fri
day morning, February 12. A majority
of the Student Body gathered to do
honor to one of America's two great
est men. A program of seven num
bers, arranged by President Roth, in
cluded the singing of "America" by
the Assembly, and tributes tÂ«o Lincoln
by several speakers, from both the
faculty and the Student Body.
The spirit of the Assembly was best
evidenced when President Roth asked
that the dedication of the gathering
be expressed by that simple, yet pow
erful, address made by Lincoln over
fifty years ago on the battlefield of
Gettysburg.
The principal address of the day
was made by President David Starr
Jordan, who opened his speech by the
significant words: "One hundred
years ago today two of the greatest
men in the last century were born.
One was born in a manor house in
England; the other in a log cabin any
where in the woods of Kentucky. Dar
win stood for the democracy of truth
and Lincoln for the democracy of man.
Just fifty years ago we hear of the
'Origin of Species' and of Lincoln's
being nominated for the Presidency."
President Jordan spoke for some
time reminiscently about war times,
John Brown and Abraham Lincoln.
Continuing, he said: "Lincoln be
lieved that the troubles between the
North and the South could be settled
by law or by some other means, with
out recourse to arms. The Civil War
was a war between manhood and spe
cial privilege. This country was
founded as a revolt against special
privilege. The founders wished to
build up a nation which would look
up to no man as superior to them
selves. The reason that they came
to the new world was to get rid of the
abuses of the old. Let us set aside all
thought of a superior and inferior
race. If you are superior, show it
by your helpfulness to fellow man.
"Lincoln hated war. He was forced
to fight a war in which 650,000 men
gave up their lives. He never lost
sight of the final end towards which
he was working."
"Above all, Lincoln was one of the
people," said Dr. Jordan. "Lincoln
understood the common American
man. As a statesman he knew how to
look forward to final results. The
people loved him. He was too great
to scheme for himself.
"Would the work of Darwin and
Lincoln have been done if they had
not done it? The work of Darwin
would have been accomplished, but
that of Lincoln would not have been
done without the aid of Abraham Lin
coln. The thirty years of floundering
after his death shows it."
The speakers were introduced by
President Roth. W. C. Shelton, '08,
