# TELLS ABOUT HIS LIFE
## REV. C.E. DOLE TAKES SUBJECT FOR HIS ADDRESS. Visiting Divine Appears at Gathering This Morning and Further Eulogizes Great President. 
### 
The Assembly at the fourth hour
this morning was addressed by the
Rev. Charles E. Dole of Jamaica
Plains, Mass., who spoke on the life
of Abraham Lincoln and the lessons
it has for the present generation.
The speaker was introduced by Dr.
.Jordan, Mho made a few remarks con
cerning the legislation at present
pending before the California Legisla
ture. He called attention to some of
the bills which are now under consid
eration and urged students to take an
active interest in the proceedings of
the lawmaking body and to write to
their representatives, expressing their
opinions of Ihe various measures be
fore the Legislature.
Dole took for his text a quotation
from Kant. "Nothing can be conceiv
ed in this or any other world which
can be called good without qualifica
tion except good-will."
"Good-will," the speaker said, "is
the root of all the virtues, all other
good qualities being by-products of
this trait. The possession of this qual
ity was the secret of Lincoln's suc
cess, for it tempered and dominated
his every action." The speaker brief
ly sketched Lincoln's early struggles
and then went on to show the quali
ties which enabled him to withstand
opposition and lead the nation out of
peril to safety. In addition to the
sterner traits of warlike bravery and
devotion to country, he was possessed
of a splendid moral courage, gener
osity and the most tender regard for
humanity.
"Judged from the materialistic
standpoint, which holds success to be
the acquisition of wealth and power,
Lincoln could not be called a success
ful man, but measured by the great
ness of his character and achieve
ments, he is one of the greatest figures
in history. A man's value should be
measured by his service to the race,
and no one can estimate what Lin
coln did for his country.
"The lesson to be learned from
Lincoln's life," continued Dole, "is
that success and happiness in life do
not consist in the mere acquisition of
wealth, honor and power, but in the
expression of power, beauty and good
will—which is the highest form of
power—in a man's life and achieve
ments. The accomplishment is that
which really counts. Who cares what
Homer received for his poems? Who
cares to know the amount of Shake
speare's income, or who wants to
know what it cost to build the Par
thenon?
"As university students, we should
take as our world the whole universe
and should learn to live as citizens
o', the universe, to acquire the quality
of good-will which embraces the traits
of justice, heroism, truth, fidelity and
humanity. There is no other solvent
of the tremendous problems in life
than this good-will, which students
should acquire during their under

graduate life. The most fundamental
differences in the nations of the world
are due to the measure of good-will
which they possess."
