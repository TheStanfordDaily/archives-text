# Crew Men Journey to Redwood.
## 
### 
The crew men journeyed to Red
wood City on Saturday afternoon for
the purpose of getting the eight-oared
shell, which has been stored in one
of the warehouses of the Redwood Cod
Fishery Company during the winter.
On account of several of the oarlocks
being out of order, the men had to
abandon practice for the day, but their
time was profitably spent in repair
ing the boathouse and getting the
eight into condition.
The two eight-oared shells pur
chased from the Cornell Boat Club
are on their way to the Coast and are
expected any day. Just which shell
will come to Stanford has not been
determined as yet, but Manager Stew
art and Coach Witter of the Univer
sity of California will meet after the
arrival of the above boats and a set
tlement, will then be made.
