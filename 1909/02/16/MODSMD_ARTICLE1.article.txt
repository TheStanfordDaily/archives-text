# OBJECT TO THE POSTERS
## "7-20-8" DODGERS GET FOUR SOPHOMORES INTO TROUBLE. Arrested and Fined for Violating Obsolete Town Ordinance of Palo Alto. 
### 
The latest advertising stunt of the
Sophomore Play Committee took an
unexpected turn today, when an obso
lete town ordinance of Palo Alto was
brushed up and Chairman J. E.
Thompson and three classmates, C. A.
Christin, L. Mann and R. J. Miller,
were arrested and fined $7.50 each for
sticking dodgers upon poles, fenses
and sidewalks of the town.
The trouble began at an early hour
this morning, when the four Sopho
mores began their task of placing the
dodgers for the purpose of advertis
ing the coming production of "7-20-8."
They were found at work by Consta
ble Mathison, who tore down the
posters and gave chase to the stu
dents. Escaping from the town offi
cial, the advertisers renewed their
task in another part of the city, only
to complete the campaign by repast
ing the torn posters.
As the four were returning to
the campus, they were confronted
by Constable Mathison, who, with
a drawn pistol, told them to sur
render to arrest. The official escorted
them to the "lock-up," and allowed
Thompson to come out to the campus
to secure bonds. This was accom
plished by a personal canvass of En
cina Hall, and the $80 required was
turned over to the town officer. The
prisoners were released, but told to
report for a hearing before Recorder
Monroe Thomas this afternoon at 1:30.
At the specified time the students
appeared and were represented by W.
C. Shelton, '08, as a legal adviser.
Thomas told the students that they
had violated an ordinance and that
they were subject to fine or impris
onment. He set the penalty at $30 for
the four, fining Mann and Miller $10
and Thompson and Christin $5 each,
with the understanding the amount
would be pooled. The fine was
promptly paid and the advertisers set
free.
That the ordinance was an ancient
one is admitted in Palo Alto, and the
arrest and fine has occasioned consid
erable surprise in the town and
among the undergraduates.
