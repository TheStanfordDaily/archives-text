We have been asked by those in
charge of the Music Festival to ex
plain the nature of this event, which
is to be one of the most elaborate an 1
interesting of its kind ever held here.
In this connection, we have received a
communication from Mr. G. C. Buehrer,
University Organist, which tells of
the purpose and aims of the Festi
val. His communication is:
As there seems to be a great deal
oi inquiry regarding the coming Stan
ford Music Festival, I wish to ask you
for space in your paper in order to
outline briefly the scope and purpose
of the Festival.
In the first place, permit me to say
that a music festival, or "Saenger
fest," as the German calls it, holds
the same place in the musical world
as a field-day does in the matter of
athletics and sports. It serves to
create and maintain interest in the de
velopment of music by stimulating its
study and practice, thereby dissemin
ating a more general understanding
and appreciation of what is best. Usu
ally, the choral element predominates,
as that enables a large number of
persons to take part. In the East,
where music enjoys a considerably
better developed state than out West,
these festivals have become common
and are annual institutions. Especial
ly have the universities done a great
deal in bringing about results along
this line, and have incorporated the
"festival" among the events of col
lege life.
The Stanford Music Festival will be
the first festival attempted in this sec
tion of the country. The main de
tails of it are as follows: It will be
held in the latter end of April. The
Chicago Symphony Orchestra of sixty
musicians, Rosenbecker, conductor,
has been engaged for it. The orches
tra carries soloists both vocal and
instrumental. There will be three con
certs in all. The first, an evening
concert, will consist of short choral
numbers, rendered by the individual
choral societies taking part, and the
artists of the Chicago Orchestra will
appear as soloists between these chor
al numbers. The choral societies from
San Mateo to San Jose, inclusive, are
taking part. The combined choral so
cieties will make a chorus of about
four hundred voices.

The second concert will be a sym
phony concert by the Chicago Orches
tra, and will take place in the after
noon of the second day.
Rossini's oratoria, "Stabat Mater,'
rendered by the chorus of 400 voices
tmd the Chicago Orchestra, will con
stitute the third concert, and will be
given in the evening of the second
day.
The expense of the festival will to-
Lal considerably over $2000, and will
Le met by selling a season ticket, ad
mitting the holder to all three con
certs for $1.50. This ticket will be
reserved for a charge of 50 cents
more. Formerly a good seat for one
concert by the same orchestra had to
be sold here for $2. The concerts
will take place in Assembly Hall. The
stage will be built up for the chorus
and enough of the front seats removed
to create space for the orchestra.
Every one should help to make thin
a success. The Stanford Student
liody and community can insure suc
cess. Singers may help by singing in
the chorus. Others may assist by in
ducing singers to take part, or at
least speak in its favor and help to
create enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is
the "sine qua non" of success in this
as well as in everything else.

the purpose and aims of the Festi
val. His communication is:
As there seems to be a great deal
oi inquiry regarding the coming Stan
ford Music Festival, I wish to ask you
for space in your paper in order to
outline briefly the scope and purpose
of the Festival.
In the first place, permit me to say
that a music festival, or "Saenger
fest," as the German calls it, holds
the same place in the musical world
as a field-day does in the matter of
athletics and sports. It serves to
create and maintain interest in the de
velopment of music by stimulating its
study and practice, thereby dissemin
ating a more general understanding
and appreciation of what is best. Usu
ally, the choral element predominates,
as that enables a large number of
persons to take part. In the East,
where music enjoys a considerably
better developed state than out West,
these festivals have become common
and are annual institutions. Especial
ly have the universities done a great
deal in bringing about results along
this line, and have incorporated the
"festival" among the events of col
lege life.
The Stanford Music Festival will be
the first festival attempted in this sec
tion of the country. The main de
tails of it are as follows: It will be
held in the latter end of April. The
Chicago Symphony Orchestra of sixty
musicians, Rosenbecker, conductor,
has been engaged for it. The orches
tra carries soloists both vocal and
instrumental. There will be three con
certs in all. The first, an evening
concert, will consist of short choral
numbers, rendered by the individual
choral societies taking part, and the
artists of the Chicago Orchestra will
appear as soloists between these chor
al numbers. The choral societies from
San Mateo to San Jose, inclusive, are
taking part. The combined choral so
cieties will make a chorus of about
four hundred voices.

The second concert will be a sym
phony concert by the Chicago Orches
tra, and will take place in the after
noon of the second day.
Rossini's oratoria, "Stabat Mater,'
rendered by the chorus of 400 voices
tmd the Chicago Orchestra, will con
stitute the third concert, and will be
given in the evening of the second
day.
The expense of the festival will to-
Lal considerably over $2000, and will
Le met by selling a season ticket, ad
mitting the holder to all three con
certs for $1.50. This ticket will be
reserved for a charge of 50 cents
more. Formerly a good seat for one
concert by the same orchestra had to
be sold here for $2. The concerts
will take place in Assembly Hall. The
stage will be built up for the chorus
and enough of the front seats removed
to create space for the orchestra.
Every one should help to make thin
a success. The Stanford Student
liody and community can insure suc
cess. Singers may help by singing in
the chorus. Others may assist by in
ducing singers to take part, or at
least speak in its favor and help to
create enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is
the "sine qua non" of success in this
as well as in everything else.

We have been asked by those in
charge of the Music Festival to ex
plain the nature of this event, which
is to be one of the most elaborate an 1
interesting of its kind ever held here.
In this connection, we have received a
communication from Mr. G. C. Buehrer,
University Organist, which tells of
the purpose and aims of the Festi
val. His communication is:
