President David Starr Jordan has
submitted a communication to The
Daily Palo Alto, which he believes will
be of interest to fraternity men. We
print it as follows:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: I would call the atten
tion of fraternity men, interested in
the larger problems of fraternities,
to a book in the Library called "In
dividual Training in the Colleges," by
Clarence F. Birdseye, an Amherst
man, a prominent lawyer of New
York, and one who has taken a large
part in shaping the policy of his fra
ternity, the Phi Gamma Delta. Chap
ters 33 to 37 treat of fraternity re
forms. David S. Jordan.
