# Claim Wallabies Are Professionals.

### 
The recent round-the-world tour of
the Australian Rugby team, the Wal
labies, is causing discussion in the
Scotch and British Rugby unions over
the question of professionalism.
When the Australian and New Zea
land teams visited the mother country,
every member of the team was allowed
three shillings (72 cents) per day as
pocket money. The members of the
Scotch Union assert that these pay
ments practically constitute profes
sionalism. They claim the officials of
the British Union were aware of this',
but took no action.
