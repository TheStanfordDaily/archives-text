# OUTLINES CONCLUSIONS
## DR. JORDAN ISSUES FIRST PAGES OF FISHERIES REPORT. Condemns Lack of Uniformity in State Laws and Suggests Interstate Legislation by Congress. 
### 
President David Starr Jordan lias
issued the lirst advance pages ol" his
findings in the international fisheries
investigation. The report is not com
pleted, hut will be added to and then
submitted to President Taft in June.
The preliminary statements of Dr.
Jordan are of importance. He outlines
what the measures of the fisheries leg
islation should be, and tells of the
rapid destruction of fish under the ex
isting regulations. He specifically
condemns the laws which have per
mitted the destruction to go on in the
Pacific Coast waters. He advances the
doctrine of interstate fisheries legisla
tion, upon the same basis as interstate
commerce legislation. His report is
111 part as follows:
"To protect for their greatest use
fulness the varying groups of fishes,
in all the lakes, rivers and seas of
our northern boundary, is the task of
the International Fisheries Commis
sion. If the work is successful, it
should furnish models for the statutes
of the different States and provinces
which have like problems and like
interests.
"If the international project is car
ried out satisfactorily, the same rem
edy should be applied to the difficul
ties arising from the migration of
fishes in interstate waters. The con
ditions are the same in Lake Michigan,
controlled by the variant statutes of
four States, as in Lake Erie, with her
five States and provinces.
"The problems of the Columbia,
with its magnificent fisheries at the
mercy of the inadequate, greedy and
variant States of Oregon, Washington
and Idaho, is far more difficult and
more hopeless than that of the Fraz
er River and Paget Sound.
"Twenty-eight years ago, in my re
port on the salmon fisheries of the
Columbia, I called attention to the
fact that these fisheries would be de
pleted or destroyed unless the gov
ernment of the United States could
intervene between Oregon and Wash
ington. In each State fishermen try
to take all they can get, and the twef
Legislatures can never agree on join;
action of any kind adequate for the
protection of the species.
"This has gone on from bad to
worse, until the Columbia fisheries are
but a fraction of what they were in
1880. At the present time, under the
referendum laws of Oregon, all fishing
above tidewater is forbidden in Ore
gon, and all gill-net fishing by night
below tidewater limit is also prohib
ited. This practically closes all fish
ing on the Oregon side, while on the
Washington side and up the river in
Idaho there is no limit of any kind.
These statutes may be set aside by
the courts—one or both of them—but
meanwhile very few fishes reach the
spawning grounds, and the fisheries
four years hence will amount to noth
ing. All this comes from a struggle
carried into politics, between the as
sociated (gill-net) fishermen on the
one hand, and the owners of the fish
wheels up the river, on the other.

"The fisheries in the other boun
dary waters—Lake Michigan, the Mis
sissippi, the Ohio and the Potomac —
are all in similar bad way. For this
there is no remedy except for the
United States to take control of all
migratory animals of commercial
value and to control and legislate foi
the interstate fisheries, as it does for
the interstate commerce. Matters of
importance, which no particular State
can manage, must be taken in hand
uy the United States. Problems which
seesawing Legislatures find insoluble
are easy enough to a national com
mission. In this case, the machinery
for investigation and control (and all
control must be based upon scientific
investigation) already exists in the
United States Bureau of Fisheries."
