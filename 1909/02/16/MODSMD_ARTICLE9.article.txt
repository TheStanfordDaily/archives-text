# Change Name of Organization.

The regular meeting of the Palo
Alto League was held last Saturday
afternoon at the home of Mrs. C. B.
Wing. The business of the day con
sisted of arrangements for various
entertainments to be held by the
league this semester, and the appoint
ing of committees for the same.
Owing to the confusion arising
from the similarity of the names "Wo
men's League" and "Palo Alto League
of Stanford Women," a new name was
adopted by the girls. "La Leana of
Palo Alto" was the name chosen, hav
ing been suggested to the league by
President Jordan as appropriate.
Following the business meeting,
Miss R. Woods gave a clever reading
from Mark Twain. This did its share
in making the meeting one of the most
pleasant of the year. It is hoped that
as many faculty women as possible
will be present at the next meeting,
which will be held on the second Sat
urday in March.
