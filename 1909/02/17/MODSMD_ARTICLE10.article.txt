We have learned that Frenchman's
Lake, one of the most picturesque
spots in the neighboring country and
one which has figured largely in the
traditions and history of Stanford
University, will soon be nothing but
a memory. The debris from the
wrecked University buildings is being
carted and dumped into the little lake.
If the filling is continued at the pres
ent rate, it will not take long to com
pletely obliterate all traces of what
was once a charming place.
It is not known to us why such a
step was ever taken by those in
charge of the hauling; but we do think
that if the fact was called to the at
tention of the proper authorities it
could be stopped. It does not seem
that it would be difficult to find some
other dumping ground that would
serve the purpose just as well. To
cart broken bricks and plaster to one
of the most pleasing localities in the
adjacent country, just because a fair
ly good road leads to this destination,
does not seem logical.
We would suggest that members of
the Student Body take some recogni
tion of the fact. It would not be out
cf order for the Executive Commit
tee to consider the question and ap
point some one to meet those in au
thority and point out the desirability
of preserving the lake. It must be
that the order was given by some one
in subordinate charge, and, if called
to the attention of the proper party,
the damage would be stopped before
it has proceeded further. Only prompt
action can be effective.
