# OPERA COACH IS CHOSEN.
## I.B. Wilkinson, Director of Wide Experience, Chosen to Take Charge of 1910 Production. 
### 
At. a meeting of the Junior Opera
Committee held today, I. It. Wilkinson
was appointed stage director. Wilkin
son will take charge of the music and
the dancing, as well as the dramatic
side of the production. He is a man
of wide experience, especially along
musical lines, having been stage man
ager for Weber and Field and also
having staged some of the biggest mu
sical hits of recent years. The com
mittee considers itself fortunate in se
curing a coach who is capable of di
recting all parts of the opera.
The number of women trying out
has been much larger than was ex
pected. Yesterday over thirty were
heard, and with those of today the to
tal number is between fifty and sixty.
Several of the last year's principals
and chorus are in the number. The
manuscript has not yet been selected.
The committee will, however, an
nounce its choice in the course of a
few days.
