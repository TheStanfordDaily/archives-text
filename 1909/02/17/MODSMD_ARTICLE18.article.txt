# WISH PLACE FOR TROPHY ROOM.
## Encina Club Would Put Cups and Banners and Books in Vacant Rooms. 
### 
An important meeting of Encina
Club was held yesterday evening at
which President J. P. Hemphill, '09,
outlined a progressive program for the
semester and matters of vital impor
tance to the club were discussed.
The main matter settled was the ap
proval of a recent letter sent to Treas
urer Lathrop, asking for permission to
open up the two small rooms to the
left and right of the clubroom.
It is the desire of the club to use
these rooms for both its and the Uni
versity's benefit, and it is therefore
proposed to open the room to the left
as a committee and trophy room and
the one to the right as a library,
where books of fiction may be kept.
The club feels that these rooms
could be put ot good use, for at pres
ent there is no settled place for the
Encina committees to meet, nor is
there any place on the campus where
modern works of fiction may be se
cured.
It is thought that the expense of al
tering the rooms for the purpose in
tended will not be a great deal, as it
will only be necessary to close up the
stairways, and do other small details
of this character.
After the consideration of this plan,
other matters of interest to the club
were brought up and discussed.
Among these was the eating-club
problem, and it was voted to appoint a
committee to investigate this matter.
