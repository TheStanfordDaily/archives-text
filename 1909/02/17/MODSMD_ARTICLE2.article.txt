# REGATTA DATE IS SET
## OAKLAND ESTUARY WILL PROBABLY BE SCENE OF CONTEST. Intercollegiate Field Day and Boat Races to Be Held on April 17. Shells Expected Soon. 
### 
Several important changes in the
conducting of the intercollegiate re
gatta will be made this year. The date
will be changed to the morning of the
intercollegiate held day, which takes
place on Saturday, April 17, providing
the new shell from the East arrives
on time, and the course will in all
probability be that of the Oakland Es
tuary instead of Richardson's Bay,
where the race has been held the last
few years.
It has not been definitely decided
as yet whether or not the estuary will
be the scene of this year's rowing
struggle, but from present indications
everything seems to indicate such a
decision. Coach Dan Murphy will send
a crew up to Oakland to give the es
tuary a tryout and to familiarize the
men with the currents and tides. As
the University of California crew is
practicing daily on this body of water,
i r . will have some slight advantage in
the picking of a course.
In selecting the morning of the in
tercollegiate field day, which takes
place at Berkeley this year, the man
agement thought it would give a grea;
many of the students, especially of
Stanford, an opportunity of witness
ing the races who could not attend
if held later in the season. In hav
ing the races on this day, the people
who go up to Berkeley will be able
to see the boat races in the morning
and the track meet in the afternoon.
The Southern Pacific Company will
have special observation trains, which
will be run on the track from Oak
land to the Oakland Mole or vice
versa, according as the course is laid
out. Every one holding a ticket will
be given a seat, and the accommoda
tions will be far better than in pre
vious years.
Financially, the universities will be
benefited, as the facilities for reaching
the estuary and viewing the races are
the best that can be found in this
part of the State, and the easy access
to the Oakland Mole will draw a great
many people from the surrounding
bay counties.
