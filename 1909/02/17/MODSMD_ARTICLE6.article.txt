# HOLDS INITIAL MEET
## PRELIMINARY TRACK CONTEST HAS MANY ENTRIES. Close Competition Characterizes First of Local Meets and Performances Up to Average. 
### 
The first track meet of the season,
held 011 the new track yesterday af
ternoon, resulted in some close com
petition among a large number of en
tries. Though, on the whole, the per
formances were not of a high aver
age, this was probably due as much
to the fact that the continued rainy
weather has prevented the men from
geting into condition as to any ab
sence of good material. Many of the
varsity men did not compete in this
preliminary meet, so that the perform
ances recorded are not always the best
of which the members of the team are
capable at this date. In the quarter
mile W. iM. Rawles, '09, suffered an
injury to a muscle, which will keep
him off the track for some days.
The best performances of the day
were in the field events, where H. R.
Stolz, '09, cleared 21 feet 5 1-2 inches
in the broad jump, and J. E. Wooley,
'12, took first in the hammer, with a
throw of 131 feet 10 inches, defeating
M. P. Youker, '10, by 4 feet 11 inches.
H. L. Horton, '08, took the shot, with
a toss of 41 feet 6 inches. The track
events were, in general, closely con
tested, but with few exceptions the
time was slow for shortened distances.
E. A. McGregor, '08, won the three
lap event in 4:22:3, while W. M. Wy
man, '11, covered 600 yards in 1:36.
The sprints were all slow, with the
exception of the first heat of the 100-
yard dash, which H. Smitheruni, '11,
won in : 10:4.
Some of the Freshmen showed abil
ity which makes them available for
the intercollegiate team, but there was
a very noticeable weakness among the
first-year athletes in certain events. L.
Arrell, '12, made a good showing by
placing second in the low hurdles and
third in the shot put and broad jump.

The first track meet of the season,

to the fact that the continued rainy

geting into condition as to any ab

preliminary meet, so that the perform

of which the members of the team are
