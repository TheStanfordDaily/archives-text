# VARSITY IS DEFEATED
## INDEPENDENTS ARE VICIOUS BY SCORE OF 5 TO 4. Goslinsky Pitches Steady Game and Is Given Strong Support.â€”Errors Are Numerous. 
### 
In a listless contest, devoid of spec
tacular play, Ireland's Independents
vanquished the Varsity this afternoon
by a score of 5 to 4. The loss of the
game was due largely to the inabil
ity of the Stanford players to connect
safely with Goslinsky's curves. The
latter was accorded strong support by
his teammates and pitched a steady
game.
Scofield, who was tried out in the
box by Coach Presley, was hit freely
by the Independents. The Cardinal
fielders were guilty of five inexcus
able errors, several of which resulted
in runs for the visitors. Captain
Sampson was responsible for two of
these, while Scott, Cadwalader and
Ganong are charged with the other
three. Scott redeemed himself by his
one-handed stop of Perrine's hot liner
in the fifth inning. Bell's batting was
a feature of the contest. He secured
three clean singles out of five times
at bat.
For the visitors, Spencer, Mertes
and Eagon each hit sofely twice.
Mertes also fielded in fast style.
The four Cardinal tallies were se
cured in the second, eighth and ninth
innings, two being recorded in the lat
ter session. Eight men were left on
bases.
The visitors registered their scores,
one each in the first, third and sev
enth innings, and two in the fourth.
Of these runs, Spencer contributed
two.
The summary follows: R. H. E.
Stanford 4 6 5
Independents 5 9 1
