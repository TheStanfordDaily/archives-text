The plan by which the intercolle
giate regatta and track meet will be
held on the same day and in the same
localit> is a good one. The support
given rowing in the past has been
light because of the poor facilities ot
tered spectators. The trip to Sausa
lito to witness the race was not con
dncive to large attendance from here,
especially when a big turn-out had re
sulted .the week preceding, because
ol the intercollegiate track meet.
The course laid out in the Oakland
Estuary seems to offer many possibil
ities. The tides and currents, with
which the Berkeley men will be more
or less famililar, are, perhaps, the onlv
objections and if these peculiarities
can be studied by the local oarsmen
for a few days prior to the race, i'.
would seem they could be overcome.
Such a change as proposed can only
result in increased interest and pop
ularity in boating and will aid mate
rially to place this sport on the foot
ing enjoyed in the Eastern universi
ties.
