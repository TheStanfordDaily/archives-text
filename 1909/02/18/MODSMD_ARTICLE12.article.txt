Upton Sinclair, the author of "'"P'
Jungle," delivered a very interesting
talk on "The Economic Interpretation
of Literature." Mr. Sinclair said tin
the writer of the past had always be r :i
dependent upon some patron for nitf
livelihood, until the time of Dr. John
son, when, in tlie eighteenth century,
a new class rose up in society, who
were able to read and purchase books,
and therefore to give to the author a
chance to earn a living. From that
time to the present there has existed
what llie speaker called a "bourgeois
literature," in that it was the middle
ciass, the merchant class, traders,
professional men and all those who
were neither of the aristocracy nor of
the proletariat, who provided the
writer with a living by buying his
books. The next step was the appear
ance, as supporters of a new litera
ture and art, of the working class.
