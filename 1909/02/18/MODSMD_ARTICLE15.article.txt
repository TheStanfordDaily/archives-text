The Daily Palo Alto is in receipt of
the following communication from
Trainer "Dad" Moulton, in which he
emphasizes the need of more material
on the track and appeals to every
man to get out and try for something
in order to strengthen the weakest
department of spring athletics:
Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
"Stanford has good reason to bo
proud of her athletic teams. First, of
the football team for the splendid
showing which they made during the
entire semester and the wonderful ex
hibition against the Wallabies. Had
our team met the Australians in the
same condition in which they faced
California in November, there would
have been a great surprise in the last
ten minutes of the game. Being more
fully matured, the visitors were sliu.ht
|> stronger at the close of the match,
though both teams were almost com
pletely exhausted. I visited both
dressing rooms, and from what I
heard and saw am assured that the
Australian players had not anticipat
ed such able opponents.
In baseball we stand in the front
rank, while in boating and tennis the
name of the University has been suc
cessfully upheld. In track we have
won three and lost three out of the
last six meets. This is an even break
and a good showing, but we can do
still better, if everybody would turn
out and try for something. The track
needs men. There are many already
out. but more are needed if a success
fi:l team is to be turned out. Candi
dates are needed for many events, in
cluding broad jump, high jump,
sprints and mile. Every one should
come out and see what he can do.
Ability can never be developed un
less you try. If you try and fail it
is not your faullt. You are needed
on the track this spring more than
in any other time or place. Stanford
Spirit calls you to do your part.
"Still, if you do not wish to do
track work, try something else and
do something to help uphold the ath
letic prestige of this University. Any
one can do athletic work and yet keep
i'!» his regular University work. Even
in the intercollegiate meet, eight men
can start in each event, so that there
is room for all, and every one will be
given a chance. An especially urgent
need exists in the broad jump. This
event requires little time and no one
can tell his ability without trying.
Once more, I urge every one to stir
himself into action, come out and help
brace up our weakest point—that is
Stanford Spirit.
"Trainer E. W. Moulton."
