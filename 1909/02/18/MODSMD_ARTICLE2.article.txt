# POSTPONE OPENING OF MUSEUM.
## Change Made in Plans for Repairs. Will Reopen Building About May 1. 
### 
It has been found impracticable to
reopen the Museum before May 1. The
plan which was at first proposed was
that the students should lie admitted
to the building, upon certain days of
each week, before all of the repairs
were completed. However, after an
examination of the walls, it has been
decided that it will he necessary to
retint them before the Museum is
thrown open to the public. This pro
cess of repairing has necessitated the
removal of all the pictures and other
exhibits.
The scaffolding for the work is be
ing rapidly raised and the actual work
of tinting the walls will be com •
menced as soon as this is completed.
Dr. Jordan stated yesterday that, al
though the walls were in a fairly good
condition, it had been thought to be a
better plan in the long run to repair
them in this manner. The postpone
ment of the opening of the building
will come as a disappointment to
those students who have never seen
the interior, but those in charge of the
work have stated definitely that ev
erything will be in readiness for a re
opening by the first of May.
