# TICKETS GO ON SALE TOMORROW
## Seats for Sophomore Comedy 7-20-8, will be Placed Before Public at 8 O'clock in Palo Alto and at Bookstore. 
### 
The tickets for the Sophomore com
edy, "7-20-8," will be placed on sale
tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock at the
Bookstore and the Stanford Phar
macy in Palo Alto. The show has

been probably more widely advertised
than any production given here in re
cent years. This has been especially
true in the neighboring towns of Red
wood City, Palo Alto, Mayfield, Moun
tain View and even in the cities of
San Francisco and San Jose. Be
cause of this publicity and also due
to numerous communications received
by the play committee, the advance
sale is expected to be heavy. The cus
tomary prices will prevail, however,
in spite of the demand and all seats
will be reserved at $1, 75 and 50 cents.
The task of coaching the cast is
now practically complete, so that,
with the production but a week away.
Coach Mathieu has only to instruct
the players in the fine points of the
stage "business." During the next few

I c1nys dress rehearsals will he held and
the cast thoroughly acquainted with
I he entrances and arrangement of the
scenes in Assembly Hall.
The scenery for the production is

due on the campus within a few days.
I< is being made at the Columbia
studio in San Francisco. Many of the
old frames in the possession of Sword
and Sandals have been utilized, but
will be recovered and repainted. The
costumes have been received.
Among the novel methods of adver
tising adopted by the Sophomore Com
mittee, probably the most unique is
that of the numerals of the show
which were planted in the grain field
east of the Delta Tau Delta house.
The music for the occasion will be
furnished this year by professionals,
as the University Orchestra has not
reorganized. Programs for the pro
duction have been contributed and will
be handsome souvenirs of the occa
sion.
