# MORE WORK ON TRACK
## BETTER WEATHER ENABLES MEN TO TRAIN REGULARLY. Second Preliminary Meet to Be Held Next Week Will Be Handicap Events 
### 
The advent of warmer weather has
enabled the track men to do much
more regular and consistent training
than has been possible during the past
few weeks. The last two afternoons
have witnessed a large number of men
out, and Trainer Moulton Is kept busy
giving instructions to the new men
and coaching those who are attempt
ing new events. The cinderpath is in
fine shape and the men are in good
condition, as the soft track has caused
very few cases of shin-splints, which
are so usual in the early part of the
season.
The cold-weather period resulted in
two breakdowns which will keep the
men off the track for some time. The
injury to W. M. Rawles, '09, received
in the meet Tuesday, has proven to be
epiite a complete breakdown, so that
he will be compelled to refrain from
running for two or three weeks. R.
L. Wheeler, '11, has also torn a mus
cle, which was injured a second time
before completely healed, so that he
will be unable to run for at least two
weeks.
Strict training rules for the track
athletes will go into effect on March
1, and at that time the track men who
were on the spring football squad and
have not yet gone into training for
track work will begin strict observ
ance of rules. The second preliminary
meet will be held early next week
and will probably be a handicap event,
the handicaps to be based on the per
formances of the contest on last Tues
day. If the date for the meet be
tween the Freshmen and Oakland High
School remains as tentatively sched
uled, on February 27, the handicap
contest of next week and a tryout.
during the following week will be the
only means of selecting the men who
will compete against the preparatory
school athletes, while not a great
lpngth of time is available for training
before the contest with St. Mary's Col
lege on March 6. The first regularly
scheduled meet for the varsity is with
the University of Southern California,
to be held in Los Angeles on March
13. According to the results of the
preliminary meets, there are a num
ber of good athletes at the southern
institution this year who should give
the Stanford varsity a good contest,
especially on a track where the IT. S.
(!. men will have the advantage of
familiarity.
In addition to the routine work,
Trainer Moulton is now devoting es
pecial attention to the men in the
field events and sprints, giving the
latter athletes constant practice in
starting, and coaching the broad and
high jumpers on the take-off and tech
nical matters of form. The pole vault
is also causing "Dad" no small amount
of worry, and he is thoroughly work
ing-out and coaching every candidate
for this event in an endeavor to find
some one who will prove available
materia] for the varsity team.
