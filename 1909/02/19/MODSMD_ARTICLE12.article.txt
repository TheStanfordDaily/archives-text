The plea of Trainer "Dad" Moulton,
printed in these columns last night,
should be received in the spirit it, was
intended. "Dad" is little given to
making appeals during the course ol
a season when it is not necessary,
and the fact that he has seen fit to
call for more men is ample proof
that additional material is needed if
Stanford is to win the intercollegiate
track meet.
"Dad" has spoken primarily with the
idea of getting out men for the track
team, because at this time it is on
the cinderpath that we are the weak
est. He has not, however, confined his
request to this branch of athletics, but
suggests that men should come out
for other sports. In this he is abso
lutely correct. In this community
there is, this year, an apathy toward
athletics such as has not existed in
the past. Perhaps the rain and small
opportunity offered for training has
discouraged many. It would only be
natural for some who signed up at the
start of the season to drop out, but
it should be borne clearly in mind if
we allow our interest to wane at this
time, it will prove difficult to make up
lost ground later.
It can't be that we are suffering
any lapse in spirit. There is simply a
growing inclination among members
of the Student Body to let a certain
number do all the work. In the up
per classes, in particular, there are
any number of men who, by example
and actual result, could do much to
enthuse the entire community into its
once energetic, enthusiastic and earn
est frame of mind. "Dad" is right.
It's up to everybody to get into mo
tion. Rain or no rain, we must be
"up and doing," or we will only be
able to count defeats this season.
