Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: May I be privileged to
ask by what right the Junior Opera
Committee first calls for an under
graduate play, and then gives the cake
to an alumnus? Why did they not
state that Hie competition was open
to the alumni and that undergraduates
need not waste time, ink and soul In
trying to run that seventy-five bill to
earth? There are enough students
with unpaid tailor's bills on the camp
us without chasing around the Middle
West for men who have nothing else
to do but write, and who are able to
go to the theater twice a day to get
their material, and who have alreads
had their whack at ihe Stanford honor
roll. Not but what it is a fine thing
to encourage alumni to take an in
terest in college affairs, or to have
them write for the stage, but this
should be understood before the pistol
goes off, so that starters may know
how many heavyweights they're run
ning against. It is perhaps safe to
say that at least $500 worth of work
has been done on operas which would
never have been attempted had it
been known that the prize was to be
given to an alumnus.
Suppose Harvard was to offer, say,
$200 for a play, and then consider
alumnus dope. It would be like in
viting New England to compete, and
the studes might as well quit and turn
their attention to something else, such
as a beer-bust or their college work.
It takes a lot of time, gall and carbon
paper to compose an opera, although
the committee may feel that there
was more fun in the writing of the
jokes than in the listening to them.
