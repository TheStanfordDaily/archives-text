# Ferrero Not to Appear at Assembly.
## 
### 
Professor Gughelmo Ferrero, the
famous Italian historian and man of
letters, will not keep his engagement
to speak before the students here,
as he lias decided to return to his
home in Italy.
Professor B. E. Howard of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises states it is
a regret able fact that the college
community will not be able to hear
Ferrero, as he is not only a man of
great learning, but also a deep-think
ing critic, who says what he thinks.
While he was giving a lecture course
at the University of Chicago, he cre
ated quite a sensation by his radical
statements.
