# JUNIOR OPERA CHOSEN
## "IN TANGIERS," BY D.H. CLIFT. '07, IS TITLE OK SHOW. Manuscript Has Clever Plot and Contains Several of New York's Latest Song Hits. 
### 
"In Tangiers" is the title of the Ju
nior Opera for this year, and D. H.
Ciift, '07, is the author of the win
ning manuscript. It is a play in two
acts, with the scenes laid in Tangiers.
There are sixteen principal parts to
the cast, and a chorus which will com
prise forty people.
The author has had considerable ex
perience with comic operas, having
written, in co-operation with L. Levy,
'OS, last year's opera. He was editor
of the Chaparral in 1907, and at the
present time is in newspaper work in
San Francisco. The committee found
it necessary to make some changes in
the original manuscript, but the plot
as a whole was quite satisfactory.
The music of "In Tangiers" is equal
to that of the "Butterfly Isle" of last
year, which was considered one of
the biggest musical successes ever giv
en at Stanford. The songs are the
cream of this year's comic opera hits
in New York, and none of the music
has as yet been heard on this Coast.
The committee considers the play su
perior to anything produced here in
the past, containing as it does a care
fully devised plot and numerous com
edy situations. Under the able direc
tion of I. B. Wilkinson, a finished and
a unified performance is assured, and
ne has expressed himself as sanguine
the material which has appeared.
Photographs recently procured in
New York will furnish the manage
ment with ideas concerning the cos
tumes worn in Tangiers, and, as the
coach has made a specialty of work
ing out such details, the pictures are
considered a very valuable asset.
H. W. Thompson, chairman of the
committee, has empowered H. Rittig
stein to carry out all necessary busi
ness transactions connected with the
opera. Entirely new costumes for
both chorus and principals will be
procured for this occasion. They will
in all probability be made by one of
the large costumers of San Francisco.
It will be necessary to have some
new scenery for the performance,
though, it is found that several of the
s<>ts which are on hand can be used
very satisfactorily. The music will
be furnished by a San Francisco Or
chestra.
