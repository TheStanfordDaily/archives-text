# Liquor Bill Now in Committee.
## 
### 
The bill prohibiting the retailing of
liquor within a radius of one mile
and a half of Stanford, as introduced
by State Senator Black of Palo Alto
iii the upper house of the State Leg
islature, is now before a. committee
that is considering its constitutional
ity. The bill originally was worded
so as to legislate for a distinct place,
but as it has been changed and placed
before the committee now consider
ing it, there is every possibility that
the bill will be reported favorably
to the Senate. In this case, the pro
vision will undoubtedly become law,
according to State Senator V. R. Rose
berry, who is now upon the campus.
The Senate is favorable to its pas
sage, and the Assembly also has sig
nified its approval of the measure.
