# INITIAL STEPS TAKEN
## PRELIMINARY PLANS FOR CLUBHOUSE DISCUSSED. Committee Takes Action at First Meeting in Anticipating Further Progress. 
### 
The first steps were taken last Sat
urday evening, at a meeting of the
preliminary committee for the carry
ing out of the plans inaugurated by
H. C. Hoover, looking toward the
erection of a building upon the camp
us for a Stanford club or union. The
members of the committee present
were George E. Crotliers, Charles K.
Field and Dr. R. L. Wilbur, from the
alumni; A. E. Roth, '09, and C. H.
Hails, '10, from the Student Body,
and E. D. Adams from the faculty.
It was decided at this meeting that
the essential thing at present was to
perfect a temporary organization,
making possible the beginning of a
definite campaign to secure funds, and
while some general details of the
purposes and character of the union
or club were discussed, it was felt
that these questions must be deferred
until a more permanent organization
was possible.
The committee organized itself into
a provisional club, having for its pur
pose the placing of matters upon such
a basis that definite proposals might
soon be issued to the alumin and to
the Student Body, asking their sup
port by subscriptions and in other
ways in the collection of a building
fund.
H. C. Hoover, was elected president
of this temporary organization, and
Professor C. D. Marx, vice-president.
The choice of a secretary-treasurer
was deferred until a future meeting.
It is fairly certain that the project
can count upon early initial subscrip
tions to about $10,000. Beyond this,
the money necessary for the erection
of a building will have to come by
means of smaller subscriptions from
the alumni, from students and from
the faculty.
Members of the committee have
expressed the opinion that if the
alumni and students are united
in their desire to see such a
club established, it should be possible
to secure the necessary funds, but
that this will mean, especially upon
the part of the Student Body, a real
enthusiasm in the matter, and a will
ingness to set aside for the building
fund profits derived from the enter
tainments of various organizations, as
well, perhaps, as some definite annual
appropriations to be made from Stu
dent Body sources. The success of the
whole plan, according to this prelim
inary board, will depend upon a unit
ed effort upon the part of everybody
to see tlie matter carried through.
The immediate plan of the commit
tee is to secure information from oth
er universities, on all points connect
ed with the financing and use of sim
ilar unions, and as soon as possible to
work out definite proposals to the
alumni for subscriptions and to the
Student Body for other aid. Sugges
tions as to methods will be enter
tained by the committee from every
one, and as soon as possible it hopes
that a permanent organization may
be organized, so that practically ev
ery one interested may have a hand
in carrying the plan through.
