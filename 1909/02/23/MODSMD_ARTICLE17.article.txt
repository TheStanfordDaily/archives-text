# GIVES STRONG SERMON
## REV. D. CHARLES GARDNER CONDEMNS TOLERATION OF SIN. Memorial Services for Mr. Stanford Next Sunday.â€”Lent Will Not Be Observed. 
### 
The pulpit of the University Chapei
was occupied Sunday hy the Reverend
1). Charles Gardner, who delivered a
forceful sermon in which he con
demned any toleration of sin, ano
urged a life characterized by self-dis
cipline, self-consecration and self
sacrifice.
Previous to the sermon, Miss J. T.
Johnson rendered a solo. Dr. Gard
ner announced that memorial services
for Mrs. Leland Stanford will be held
next Sunday morning in the Chapel
and also that Lent will not be formally
observed by the University congrega
tion.
In delivering the sermon the preach
er said in part: "No one is satisfied
with himself. My conscience tells me
I am not the man I ought to be. i
cannot stand in the presence of the
gospel and not but feel my own weak
ness. Most of us recognize our own
faults, our base impulses and our mor
al temptations.
"Many young people urge that our
baser impulses being from our ani
mal natures, are natural; that indul
gences are natural and cannot be
charged to our moral account."
Dr. Gardner in answer to this stated
that no one who argues this is true
to himself, and that it is a crude phi
losophy which defends evil on the ba
ois of moral depravity. "A conscience
which is not warped tells us that evil
is something which violates the just
order of the universe.
"Sin is not mere badness; it is our
will directed to bad ends. If we per
sist in sin, the result is a breakdown
in our moral faculties. If you are
honest, you feel the results in your
own life."
The medicine for sin is not neces
sarily social service, nor hazy human
itarianism, but rather a life of self-dis
cipline, self-consecration and self-sac
rifice, founded on a religion whose
function it is to maintain harmony be
tween the sonl and God.
