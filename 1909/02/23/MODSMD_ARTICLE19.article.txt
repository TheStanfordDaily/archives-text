# Settlement Worker to Speak Here.
## 
### 
Miss Schenck, head worker of the
North Park district, San Francisco,
will address the Y. W. C. A. Tuesday
afternoon at 4:30 in the Chapel. The
subject of Miss Schenck's talk will
be her work and personal experiences
in the slums of the city. This talk
should prove very interesting to all,
as settlement work has received so
much attention of late. Special music
will be provided. Every woman of
the University is welcome.
