# WIN FROM MILLS COLLEGE.
## Stanford Women Are-Victorious in Basketball Game.â€”Urge Support at Contests Here. 
### 
The Stanford basketball team de
feated Mills College Saturday morn
ing by the score of 29-14. This game,
however, is not to be counted as one
of the series of three, but rather as a
practice game, because it, was played
in the gymnasium on account of the
bad weather. The Stanford team, al
though used to playing on an outdoor
court, showed its supremacy from the
start. The score at the end of the first
half was 14-4.
The team work of the entire Stan
ford team was remarkable, and the
forwards did some unusually good
work, making many spectacular bas
kets from many different positions.
The first game of the series with
Mills College will be played on the
Stanford court next Saturday. At the
game last week there was a large
and enthusiastic audience of Mills stu
dents, and it is to be hoped that, the
women students of this University
will give their team an equal support
on the 27th.
The line-up was as follows: For
wards, Miss S. Bundy, '10 (captain);
Miss V. Swift, '08, Miss B. Haig, '11;
centers, Miss B. Whelan. '12, Miss M.
Monteith, 'OS, Miss F. Woodhead, '11:
guards, Miss E. Hayward. '10, Miss H.
Hardison, '11, Miss L. Woodhead. '11.
In the second half Miss S. Hunter, '10,
played guard and Miss M. Hunter, *12,
P?ayed center.
