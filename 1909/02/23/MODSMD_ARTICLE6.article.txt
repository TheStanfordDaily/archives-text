# OLYMPICS DEFEAT VARSITY.
## San Francisco Nine Takes Lead in Ragged Game.â€”Score 8 to 4. 
### 
The Olympic Club nine of San Fran
cisco won a ragged game of baseball
from the varsity yesterday afternoon
on the local diamond by the score of
8 to 4. Smith's ascension in the sev
enth inning, when the visitors ac
quired sjx runs, coupled with exceed
ingly poor support on the part of the
Stanford players, was responsible for
the easy victory of the opposing team.
Scott. Cadwalader and Bell were the
worst offenders in the way of costly
errors, and the varsity as a whole
played in an indifferent, manner.
Tbeile, the veteran pitcher, appeared
for the first time this season in yes
terday's contest. He was relieved in
the fourth by Smith, after allowing
the Olympics to score one run in the
third inning. Smith twirled effective
ly until the seventh inning, when two
s ngles and a series of glaring mis-
Tlays netted the winning aggregation

six tallies. The eighth score of the
Olympics resulted from Watson's
three-bagger, aided by an error in the
next to last inning.
All of the Cardinal tallies were
made in the eighth session. Girot
walked Smith. Scofield and Cadwala
der successively and Captain Samp
son's timely home run then scored
tr.em as well as himself. With the
exception of this period, Girot pitched
steady ball and kept hits well scat
tered. He was given perfect support,
and was himself guilty of the one er
ror charged to his side. Sampson's
oi.e-handed stop of McMillan's swift
grounder in the fifth and Crawford's
difficult catch of two long flies by
Scott and Sampson were the features
of an otherwise uninteresting game.
Following is the summary of the
play: R. H. E.
Stanford 4 6 10
Olympics 8 8 1
Rain compelled the cancellation of
the game which had been scheduled
with the Olympics for last Saturday.
