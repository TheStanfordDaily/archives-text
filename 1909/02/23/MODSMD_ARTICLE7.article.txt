# PROM. PLANS OUTLINED
## CHANGES TO BE INTRODUCED IN MANAGEMENT OF DANCE. Two Supper Intermissions and Refreshments Will Be Served in Encina Hall. 
### 
Preliminary plans for the Junior
Prom took shape at a recent meeting
of the committee having the function
in charge. A number of radical
changes will be made in the arrange
ments as carried out in former years.
Chief among these will be the serving
of the supper on the second floor of
Encina Hall instead of at the Inn. The
h.tter place has been found too small
in the past to properly accommodate
the large crowds which usually attend
the third-year dance, and for this rea
son Manager W. C. Shelton has de
cided not to submit a bid for the sup
per contract. An outside caterer will
be specially engaged for the occasion
and extensive preparations made for
the suitable arrangement of the floor
which will be used for the purposes of
the supper.
In connection with this new depart
ure, a variation is to be made in the
program of dances. There will be
fourteen regular numbers and two in
termissions. The latter will come be
tween the eighth and ninth and elev
enth and twelfth dances, respectively.
The impossibility of conveniently pro
viding for all the diners at once made
the two intermissions necessary. Half
of the number of danceTs will be
served at the time of the first interim
and the remainder during the second
one. The tickets will give sufficient
instructions to enable the holders to
determine to which section they be
long.
The Prom committee is also con
sidering the advisability of commenc
ing the grand march at an early hour,
with a view of increasing the length
of the intermissions. Music is to be
dispensed by the orchestra during the
supper intermissions. Encina Club
room will be elaborately decorated for
the event.
Tickets for the Prom will go on
sale on the Quad March 1. The cus
tomary price of $5 will be charged.
The date will be as originally set, on
March 26.
