In the advance sale of the tickets
for the Sophomore comedy, "7-20-8,"
considerable dissatisfaction was evi
denced. This was largely due to the
fact that of the number who stoo 1
in line at the Bookstore, several hold
ing places in the first part of the Him
accepted orders from friends or en
tered the list with the intention of so
curing more than the usual numb-i
of tickets. Purchasers who permitted
or participated in the first-mentioned
p'-actice must have known at the time
this was unfair and unjustifiable.
The root of the evil is not, however,
to be found in the conduct of the buy
ers, but more properly in the system
of the management. Under no cir
cumstances shoulc any one purchase' 1
have been allowed to secure more than
ten tickets, or some number not great
ly in excess of this. This limit has
generally been recognized by manag
ers of past undergraduate perform
ances and upon the face of the mat
ter the justice of such a measure is
evident.
We have investigated the difficulty
arising from the recent sale for the
purpose of offering our findings and
conclusions to members of the Stu
dent Body, to prevent, if possible, a
repetition of the trouble and not u
censure the present committee of
Sophomores. Its intentions were above
reproach in this regard. The mem
bers of this committee were misin
formed by one in authority, who evi
dently did not know his business.
The Sophomore committee was told
that in the past no limit had been
placed on the sale of tickets to an in
dividual. Accordingly, no limit was
fixed.
The Sword and Sandals Society has
lie en act ive in advocating various re
forms in the method of selling tickets,
and the general scheme adopted by
this organization is the one we believe
should be followed by all managers.
This plan calls for the issuing of

coupons to all entitled to complimen
tary tickets and restriction of the num
ber of tickets which any individual cu'i
purchase to ten. No mention is madi 1
ol the possibility of late-comers pass
ing their money to more enterprising
friends. It probably never occurred
to the originators of the plan to make
any special provision for this unheard
of practice.
