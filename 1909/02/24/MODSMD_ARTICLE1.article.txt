# TO PLAY CAMPUS GAME
## VARSITY AND SANTA CLARA MEET AGAIN TOMORROW. Radical Changes to Be Made in Cardinal Line-up.—Mitchell Shifted to Third Base. 
### 
Barring inclement weather, the
third game of the season's series with
Santa Clara College will be played
on the local grounds tomorrow af
ternoon. Play will be called at 3:30
and the usual 25-cent admission fee
will be exacted.
The two games that have already
been played between the varsity and
Santa Clara have not disclosed any
marked advantage in favor of eithe.*
team. The two aggregations have
played in even style, the first game
going to the Collegians by a 2 to l
score and Stanford reversing the ta
bles in the second contest.
Manager Stewart has not been in
formed of any change in the line-up
of the Santa Clara nine, and the same
palyers as opposed the varsity on the
two former occasions will probably
be seen in action tomorrow. The bat
tery will be composed of Friene and
Shafer. Friene has proven himself to
be a reliable pitcher as well as a con
sistent hitter.
While the personnel of the Cardinal
line-up will be practically the same
as in all the games played thus far,
several notable changes are to be
made in a number of the positions.
Mitchell will be stationed at third
base, his place behind the bat being
filled by Canterbury. Scott, in turn,
will resume his old position at sec
ond. while Cadwalader will be shifted
t«> the center garden in the outfield,
where he played in the 1906 intercol
legiate series. Ganong and Ball will
alternate in right field.
The varsity line-up follows:
Pitchers, Tlieile, Smith, Scofield;
catcher, Canterbury; first base, Bell;
second base, Scott; third base, Mitch
ell; shortstop, Sampson; left field,
Tallant; center field, Cadwalader;
right field. Ball, Ganong.
