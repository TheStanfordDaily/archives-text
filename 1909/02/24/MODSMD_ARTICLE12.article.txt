with recently and the effect of the ad
vertisement spoiled with no benefit to

struction of the numerals planted in

and the removing ol' paper figures
posted in a conspicuous place on an

pretend to know who chose to molest
these legitimate forms of advertising,
but we do think that such action was
totally unwarranted and contrary to
local sentiment.

ers, if this precedent is allowed to
stand unchallenged, advertising may
be attacked in the future, with the
result that it will be practically im
possible for any legitimate stunt to
be carried out. It's all right to show
lots of class spirit. We believe in
such, but would see it vented in prop
er manner.
