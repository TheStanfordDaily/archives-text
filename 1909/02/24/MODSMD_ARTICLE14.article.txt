# To Entertain Members Visiting Fair.
## 
### 
During the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific
Exposition at Seattle this summer, a
majority of the fraternity and soror
ity houses of the University of Wash
ington will keep open for the accom
modation of the members who will
visit the fair. Although all have not
announced their plans as yet, the
movement is well started and doubt
less all will soon fall into line. Nine
national fraternities are represented
at Washington and six sororities, so
if all decide to remain open, pleasant
accommodations are assured for the
members who come to Seattle this
summer.
