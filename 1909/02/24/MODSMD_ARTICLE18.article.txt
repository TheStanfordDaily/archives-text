# SALE OF SEATS CONTINUES.
## Tickets for "7-20-8" Disposed of to Extent of Nearly $1000.â€”Dress Rehearsal Tonight. 
### 
The seat sale for the Sophomore
comedy, "7-20-8," has approached the
$1000 mark. On the campus, $450 has
been taken in, while in Palo Alto the
sale has been greater, contrary to past
experience. This is undoubtedly due
to the extensive advertising the com
mittee has done in the near-by towns.
While the seats are not all sold yet,
Ihe proprietor of the Stanford Phar
macy, who has charge of the Palo Alto
sale, states that it is the largest ad
vance sale he knows of, and believes
every ticket will be disposed of by
Friday noon. The majority of the
seats not yet sold are the dollar ones.
Tbei,*e are still some good ones left.
The scenery for the third and fourth
acts, which was sent to San Fran
cisco to be painted, lias arrived at the
campus, and will, with the rest of the
fixtures, be held in readiness for next
Friday evening.
Chairman J. E. Thompson has also
completed negotiations for a set of
new furniture for the same acts,
which will lie loaned by a Palo Alto
merchant. The fixings for this scene,
which is laid in a New York apart
ment house, are probably the best ever
used in Assembly Hall.
Monday the entire forenoon and two
hours of the afternoon were spent in
a thorough rehearsal on the Assembly
Hall stage. Coach Mathieu devoted
his time in perfecting the details and
finer points of acting, and yesterday
excused the cast, from practice. The
first dress rehearsal will be tonight.
