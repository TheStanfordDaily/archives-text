# FRESHMEN GO TO REDWOOD.
## 1912 Candidates Have First Preliminary Tryout in the Eight-Oared Shell. 
### 
The Freshman crew, accompanied
by F. W. Turner, '08, journeyed to
Redwood City this afternoon on the
4:151 train, to have their first prelim
inary tr.vout of the season in tlie eight
oared shell. Up to the present time,
the 1912 candidates have been prac
ticing on the lake in the two and four
orred barges, and as they have been
making very rapid strides in the ma
nipulation of the oars, Coach Murphy
thought it advisable to send a picked
crew tip to Redwood today, so thai
they could .uot accustomed to the eight
and the water in the bay.
The Freshman crew this year will
be about the same weight as last
year's, but their average height and
lfach will exceed that, of the 1911
ciew. Although a little early in the
season to make any predictions as to
the outcome of this year's Freshman
r;«ce, from present indications every
thing points to a good 1912 crew.
The new eight, which is on the way
from the East, is expected almost any
day.and, with the addition of an
other shell to the boating house at

Redwood, the present handicap of
coaching t.wo crews in one boat will
be greatly overcome.
The following men accompanied
Turner to Redwood: H. L. Dietterle,
.1 P. Partridge. €. U Schaupp, R. W.
Clyde, H. B. Post, R. R. Gilmore, R.
R. Hails and R. H. Seward.
