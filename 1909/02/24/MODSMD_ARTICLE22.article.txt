# PLAY CONTINUES IN TOURNAMENT.
## Interclass Series to Be Completed This Week.â€”Hard-Fought Matches Held. 
### 
The interclass singles and doubles
tennis matches were played oft' as far
as? possible yesterday, the wet weather
having interfered with the games last
week. In the singles H. Mann, '10,
has reached the finals, and will play
the winner of the match between R. B.
Steinberger, '11, and H. S. Morgan, '12.
In the doubles A. J. Gowan, '09, and
E Jordan have reached the Senior
finals.
One of the hardest fought contests
was that between Jordan for the Se
niors and Mann for the Juniors. After
Mann had reached 5-3 and 40-15 in
the first set, Jordan evened up by a
succession of brilliant smashes and
drives, but finally lost to Mann's
steady play by a score of 8-6. In the
second set Mann made the games 6-0,
but nearly every game was deuce.
The doubles match between Gowan
and Jordan and Delano and Gott was
one of exciting rallies. The team work
of Gowan and Jordan won the match
finally by a score of 6-2, 6-3.
