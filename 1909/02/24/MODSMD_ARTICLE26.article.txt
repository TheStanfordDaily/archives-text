# 1912 Shell Capsizes at California.
## 
### 
The Freshman four-oared shell at
California capsized in the Oakland
Estuary, Wednesday afternoon. The
accident was caused by the breaking
of No. 4's oar. Two men were slight
ly injured, and other entangled in the
outriggers. A row boat nearby pre
vented a serious accident. The brok
en oar opened a large hole in the bot
tom of the shell.
