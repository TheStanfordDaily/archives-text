# QUESTION IS CHOSEN
## TOPIC FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE SUBMITTED. University of California Will Select Side of Question Before March 7. 
### 
The Intercollegiate Debating Com
mittee has finally made a choice of
the question that will be debated up
on in the intercollegiate contest next
April, and has already submitted the
topic to the debating representatives
of the University of California. Stan
ford has the privilege this year of
drawing up and presenting the ques
tion for debate, while the selection of
the side remains in the hands of the
State institution. The answer may be
returned by California at any time be
fore March 7.
"Resolved, That our legislation
should be shaped toward the gradual
abandonment of the protective tariff."
is the comprehensive subject selected
by the committee that has the six
teenth annual debate in charge. This
board is composed of three under
graduatesâ€”D. C. Boyd, '08, L. Craven,
09, and J. E. Shelton, '10.
With the revived interest in debat
ing and the excellent material ad
vanced by the recent Carnot tryouts,
a large list of names of those whj
will contest for a place upon the
team will undoubtedly be submitted
to the committee in charge of the try
outs. Places upon the squad that will
represent Stanford this year will be
closely contested as has already been
signified by the number of men who
have announced their intention of try
ing for a position in the trio. D. C.
Boyd, 'OS, L. Craven, '09, G. B. Bush,
'09 G. F. Morgan, '10, .T. E. Shelton,
'10, and P. J. Batkin, '10, are among
those who will probably be contest
ants for the team. All those who de
sire to enter the tryouts must hand in
their names to the members of the
committee which has this tryout in
charge on or before next Friday, Feb
ruary 26. This committee consists of
G. B. Bush, '09, and J. E. Shelton, '10,
and it is desired by them that enough
names be turned in so that two sets
of tryouts can be held. The subject
for these preliminary debates will be
the intercollegiate question and will
form the experimental topic for dis
cussion in the debating societies wi-th
in the next few weeks. According to
the present plans of the committee,
the tryouts will be held during the
latter week in March.
