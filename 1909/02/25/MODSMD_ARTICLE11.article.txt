# MAY DEBATE WITH NEVADA.
## Executive Committee Favors Second Team Contest.â€”Other .Matters Considered. 
### 
Debating occupied the undivided at
tention of the Executive Committee
lfr.st night, at its regular weekly ses
sion, as far as definite action was con
cerned. Several other important mat
ters, including the boating policy,
were discussed at length, but no de
cision was reached in regard to them.
It was decided to award permanent
ly the Interscholastic Debating Cup,
which is competed for annually by the
high schools of this region, to that in
stitution into whose possession it first
conies for the third time. Three con
sccutive victories will not be neces
sary to tlu j permanent acquisition of
the trophy. The team representing the
California Institute for the Blind has
twice annexed the cup, and a victory
this year would entitle that school
to its perpetual possession. The Ex
ecutive Committee further voted to
offer a new cup, under similar con
ditions, whenever the existing one
shall have been won by any compet
ing school.
In response to the growing agita
tion in debating circles for a renewal
of the second-team debates with the
University of Nevada, the Executive
Committee decided to ask the local
literary societies to propose practical
plans for financing and managing
such contests as are desired. Com
mittees will be appointed by the local
clubs to prepare the information
celled for by the Executive Commit
tee. The wealth of varsity debating
material now available at Stanford,
the evident desire of the Nevada de
leters for the projected contests and
several other considerations favor the
revival of the annual debates between
the two universities, which were dis
continued some four years ago.
