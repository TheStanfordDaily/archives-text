# INTERCLASS MARATHON
## THIRTEEN-MILE RELAY TO BE HELD ON MARCH 17. Quadrangle Club Plans Big Event and Offers Cup and Medals.â€”104 Entries Required. 
### 
The Marathon epidemic, which has
been so widely experienced in all
parts of the country in the past tew
months, has reached Stanford. The
members of the Quadrangle Club last
night decided to hold, on March 17,
St. Patrick's Day, the biggest event of
the kind yet attempted in this local
ity. An interclass relay Marathon of
thirteen miles is the proposal of the
members of the Senior organization,
and it calls for competition on the
part of four teams representing each
of the undergraduate classes. The
teams are to be composed of twenty
six men, who will run a half-mile
each.
The proposal has met with the au
imous favor of Dad Moulton, ' Aain
H L. Horton and the men of track
squad and of the various o' grouns
ot varsity candidates.
To the natural zest which would
arise from the interclass competition,
tbe members of the Quadrangle Club
have decided to offer a handsome cup
to tbe winning class team, which will
become the property of the class and
will be placed in the proposed trophy
room. Three handsome medals will
also be awarded to the three men
whose time for the two laps excels
that of the other competitors.
Captain Horton has stated that the
most feasible date for the race is that
of St. Patrick's Day, March 17, and
it is probable that University work
may be shortened upon that afternoon
tc allow time for the race.
Arrangements are now being made
by members of the Quadrangle Club
toward making the affair of carnival
aspect. The University Band will
probably be on hand, as well as that
of the Palo Alto Boys' Club of Palo
Alto, if it can be obtained. The event
is to be widely advertised in San
Francisco, San Jose and tbe neigh
boring towns, with the idea of ob
taining a record crowd. The affair,
including as it will 104 runners,
should attarck wide interest.
The support of the classes will be
appealed to at meetings within a few
days, and each team will be asked
to pay a small entrance fee to par
tially defray the expenses of adver
tising. A nominal admission will also
be charged spectators to aid in the
paying for the cup and medals.
Definite plans for the entering of
teams in the meet will be worked out
within a few days. It is entirely prob
able that this may be left to the
classes.
