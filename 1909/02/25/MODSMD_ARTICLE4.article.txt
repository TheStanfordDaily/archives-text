the production this year being one of
Augustin Daly's best plays, "7-20-8
or "Casting the Boomerang."
Every possible effort has been ex
erted by the play committee to equal,
if not to surpass, any class play eve"
produced at Stanford. The training
of the cast has been done by Frame
Mathieu, one of the best-known pro
fessional coaches and stage directors
of San Francisco. Coach Mathieu has
had a wide experience in this line of
work and bis work in connection with
"His Excellency The Governor,'

first Sophomore comedy in several
years that has been coached by a pro

The Daly play was chosen only af
ter several weeks of laborious play
reading, and Coach Mathieu, as well as
the committee, believing it to be the
best, comedy that could have been
chosen. The personnel of the cast
v as left entirely in the hands of the
coach. Extensive tryouts were hell
last semester, and out of 112 candi
dates. the 11 characters were selected.
The only disruption in the whole cast
occurred in a second male part. W.
S. Porter was originally chosen to
play the part of Paul, hut owing to
pressure of other work, he was obliged
to relinquish it to P. M. Ogilvie. The
rehearsals have been going on all this
semester, the coach coming down from
San Francisco two or three times ev
ery week.

An elaborate stage setting, which
was painted in an art studio in San

Furniture Company, while the electric
fixtures were secured through the
courtesy of the Palo Alto Electrical
Works.
The customary advertising program

Committee in regard to soliciting ad
vertisements. Instead, an attractive
souvenir program has been gotten out
bv the committee at the expense of
L I). Kelly, a merchant tailor in Palo
Alto, who has generously offered to
pay the expense of printing them.
The plot of "7-20-8, or Casting the
Boomerang," presents an unconven
tional romance, and depicts the trou
bles of a father who is the prey of
las wife's foolish aspirations and hob
by. The young lover, Courtney Cor

Tomorrow evening at 8:15 in Assem
bly Hall, (he class of 1911 will pre
vent the aiinual Sophomore conu'lv,
the production this year being one of
Augustin Daly's best plays, "7-20-8
or "Casting the Boomerang."
Every possible effort has been ex
erted by the play committee to equal,
if not to surpass, any class play eve"
produced at Stanford. The training
of the cast has been done by Frame
Mathieu, one of the best-known pro
fessional coaches and stage directors
of San Francisco. Coach Mathieu has
had a wide experience in this line of
work and bis work in connection with
"His Excellency The Governor,'
which was given last semester by
Sword and Sandals, amply demon
strated his ability. This will be the
first Sophomore comedy in several
years that has been coached by a pro
fessional.
The Daly play was chosen only af
ter several weeks of laborious play
reading, and Coach Mathieu, as well as
the committee, believing it to be the
best, comedy that could have been
chosen. The personnel of the cast
v as left entirely in the hands of the
coach. Extensive tryouts were hell
last semester, and out of 112 candi
dates. the 11 characters were selected.
The only disruption in the whole cast
occurred in a second male part. W.
S. Porter was originally chosen to
play the part of Paul, hut owing to
pressure of other work, he was obliged
to relinquish it to P. M. Ogilvie. The
rehearsals have been going on all this
semester, the coach coming down from
San Francisco two or three times ev
ery week.

An elaborate stage setting, which
was painted in an art studio in San
Francisco, will be used in tlie fash
ionable New York apartment scenes.
Some costly furniture for the same
;i<ls iias been loaned by the McKibbon
Furniture Company, while the electric
fixtures were secured through the
courtesy of the Palo Alto Electrical
Works.
The customary advertising program
lias been omitted, in order to comply

with the resolution of the Executive
Committee in regard to soliciting ad
vertisements. Instead, an attractive
souvenir program has been gotten out
bv the committee at the expense of
L I). Kelly, a merchant tailor in Palo
Alto, who has generously offered to
pay the expense of printing them.
The plot of "7-20-8, or Casting the
Boomerang," presents an unconven
tional romance, and depicts the trou
bles of a father who is the prey of
las wife's foolish aspirations and hob
by. The young lover, Courtney Cor
liss, a well-to-do theorist, is in searcli
o' the original of a portrait, numbered
7-20-8. He finds her —"charminglv

ently unsophisticated girl.
