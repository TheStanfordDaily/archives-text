The women's fencing classes, which
have been practicing last semester as
well as this, have planned to give sev
eral exhibition bouts this semester.
There are twenty-five members of
these classes, ten of whom are in the
advanced section.
Between the two halves of the bas
ketball game with the University of
Cj 'fornia, which has been scheduled
loi Saturday, March 6, at Stanford,

the advanced women's fencing class
will have several exhibition bouts for
the entertainment of the Berkeley vis
itors. Arrangements are also being
made to have some friendly bouts be
tween the Stanford and the Berkeley
women at the same time.
At an early date, which has not as
vet been decided upon, a fencing tour
nament will be held between all the
members of the fencing classes, to de
cide the individual championship of
the University. The first three win
ners of this contest will be awarded
medals. In addition to this, there
will probably be a match between the
two teams of the advanced and sec
ondary classes and a medal will be
awarded to the winning team.

these medals for the women's cham
pionship, has sent to Paris to have
them made.
To stimulate interest in this sport,
a mixed friendly bout will be held at
Iloble gymnasium Saturday, March I.">.
All men and women students who are
interested in fencing are eligible to
