# MARATHON IS POPULAR
## MANY NEW MEN WILL TRAIN FOR NOVEL RACE. Trainer Moulton Strongly Favors Proposed Contest and Expects New Material to Be Developed. 
### 
The idea of a relay Marathon race
as proposed by the Quadrangle Club
for March 17 has met with instant
popular approval and a very decided
interest is being shown in the event,
enthusiasm, engendered through class
rivalry, reaching many who have done
no previous track work. Already a
number of men have started training
for the event, and many others have
signified their intention of competing.
In order that the race may be a real
ly spirited athletic competition, Train
er Moulton and Captain Horton urge
all who intend to compete to con
tinue in training from this time on,
in order to be in condition for the
contest.
In order to increase the competition
and eliminate any advantage whicn
ivight accrue to 1909 through enter
ing all Seniors in one team, those
originally of the class of 190S have
decided to enter as a separate team
in the race, if a sufficient number can
be found to compete. Many have al
ready signified their willingness to run
in the 1908 team, and, in order that
it may be definitely known if the
requisite number can be secured, all
who will run are requested to notify
P O. Box 71.
The number of men who have be
come actively interested in the Irish
Marathon to the extent of already be
ginning active training has been -i
distinct surprise to even those who
were supporting the plan. From pres
ent appearances, there will be a full
team from every class, and competi
tion will be close for places on some
o. the class teams.
Trainer Moulton has expressed his
unqualified approval of the plan and
is becoming enthusiastic over the pos
sibilities of the race as a means of
developing varsity track material.
Even in the short time since the race
was first announced, men have come
out in whom "Dad" sees good ma
terial for the track team, though they
have not previously been out for this
branch of athletics.
A change is proposed in the manner
of awarding the medals to the indi
vidual runners who make, the best
tune. Of the three medals awarded,
only txne will go W> a former varsity
r.iii*k man, the other two being given
to the 'new men who maJte the best
time for the two laps.
