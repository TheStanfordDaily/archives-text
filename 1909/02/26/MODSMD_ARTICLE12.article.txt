The organization of numerous de
partment nines, together with the ex
pressed desire of many players who
took part in the recent class games
that they be given further opportu
nity to play the game before taking
their seats among the rooters, sug
gests to us that we should have a sec
ond varsity baseball squad. In fact,
we wonder why such provision has not
been made in the past for men who
are, perhaps, not good enough for the
varsity nine, but who have, neverthe
less, the making of good players witli
more practice.
In training our Rugby varsities a
second and even third team is kept
out on the field during the greater
part of the season. As baseball takes
even more experience than football
or Rugby, it would seem that second
team men would be especially desirable
in this branch of athletics. A good ball
player is the result of long practice.
Many good players come to Stanford,
but are not developed until they have
been here for several years; others
<lf.nbtless come to this University and
are never developed.
Second teams are encouraged at oth
er institutions, especially at the Cath
olic colleges, which have proven such
worthy opponents of Stanford, is this
true. Surely the securing of games
with outside opponents would not be
difficult. The very fact that our var
sity opponents have second teams is
proof of this.
Therefore, taking this view of the
situation, we believe that, now the in
terchips games are over, a second
group should be formed. The exper
iment does not involve either time or
expense. The results may be great.
Why not try it?
