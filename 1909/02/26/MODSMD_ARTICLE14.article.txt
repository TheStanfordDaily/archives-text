### 
The Prom Committee has disposed
of several important matters connect
ed with the holding of the Junior
dance. It lias been decided to place
the tickets on sale next Monday, March
1, and they can be purchased there
after on the Quad on Mondays, Wed
nesdays and Fridays, from 11:15 to
12:15, and on Tuesdays and Thurs
days, from 1:30 to 2:30. The price,
as formerly, will be $5.
Each of the two intermissions for
supper will be of half an hour's dura
tion. The tickets will be numbered
first or second intermission, and pur
chasers, in order to prevent confu
sion, must take supper at the time
stated on the ticket. A choice of in
termissions will not be given when
buying. The committee has made this
rule in order to give every one an
equal chance. The orchestra will con
tinue to play during both intermis
sions, in order that those who desire
to dance may do so.
Brohaska's Orchestra of San Jose,
consisting of fifteen pieces, has been
secured for the occasion by the com
mittee.
Chairman W. W. Southard stated
today that the grand march will com
mence promptly at 7:30, so that suf
ficient time may be had for the in
termissions.
