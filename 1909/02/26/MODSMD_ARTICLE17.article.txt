P. 15. l)e Witt, a special student in
the Department of Civil Engineering,
claims that lie has solved the problem
o! sending wireless messages under
water. He has been interested in
submarine wireless work for some
time, and asserts that, as a climax
l<i his experiments, he succeeded last

tance of five miles under the waters
of Shu Francisco Hay. The inventor
is very sanguine as to the results of
his invention, thinking that it will rev
olutionize the system of marine dan
ger signals and will be of great use in
connection with submarine warfare.
I)v! Witt wil continue his operations
in Puget. Sound this summer, and will
