### 
A novel plan of advertising the
Sophomore comedy was carried out
last evening in the way of a phantas
magoric parade. About forty Sopho
mores, each bearing a large box lan
tern with the illuminated numbers "7-
20-8," organized shortly after 7:30
o'clock and marched up the Row,
thence to Palo Alto and Miss Har
ker's School, and back again to the
campus.
Accompanied by much clamor and
tlie beating of all sorts of improvised
noise-makers, the procession attracted
considerable attention along the line
of march.
