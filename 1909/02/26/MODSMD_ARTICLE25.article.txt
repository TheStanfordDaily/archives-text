# HANDBALL TOURNEY DELAYED.
## Committee Postpones Closing of Tournament.-Few Games Played Up to Present Time. 
### 
Owing to the delay in playing off the
preliminary games in the handball
tournament, the committee in charge
has decided to indefinitely extend tho
time within which the games must be
played.
Should the players be unable to find
any member of the committee to offi
ciate at their games, they may choose
any impartial person as referee, an J
the results of the games will be ac
cepted as official.
If, under these conditions, the games
are not played off within a reason
able length of time, the committee
will take the entire matter of fixing
dates under its charge and assign a
time for each contest to be played. Any
games not held at the designated time,
owing to the absence of one of the
contestants, will be declared forfeited
to the other.
By means of these regulations, it is
hoped to eliminate any more unneces
sary delay due to the carelessness or
forgetfulness of the men.
The following games have been
played during the last few days: A.
B Cox, '09, defeated H. S. Morgan,
'12, 21-2, 21-18; J. A. Macready, '12,
defeated W. J. Crook, Ml. 211. 21-14.
At 3 on Saturday a doubles game
will be played, the contestants be
ing H. Flinn, '11, and H. V. Poor, '10,
vs. CJ. W. Waugh, '11, and.1. H. Wig
gins, '10.
