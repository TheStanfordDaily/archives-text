# COURSE IS LENGTHENED
## THREE MILES WILL BE ROWED BY VARSITY CREW. Fight This Year Will Be Heavier Than Last.â€”Crew Practice at Redwood. 
### 
The intercollegiate regatta this
year will be rowed over a three-mile
course instead of two miles, as in
previous years. Last year the course
was about two and one-half miles,
which was longer than was anticipated
by the crew men. Changing the
course to three miles this season will
mean an extra amount of work for
the men, and longer distances will be
rowed in the eight while practicing.
On the estuary at Oakland the distance
can be easily measured off, and this
will do away with the uncertainty
experienced on Richardson's I lay.
The varsity crew men went to Red
wood City yesterday afternoon for the
second time this season, and from
now on they will go up three or four
times a week until the arrival of the
new shell, at which time the whole
squad will go every afternoon.
Captain Reynolds had charge of the
eight yesterday and put the men
through their first hard work of the
season. They rowed three and a half
miles out on the bay and then spurt
ed the last half-mile coming back.
The varsity crew this year will be
a great deal heavier than that of last,
and from present indications they will
undoubtedly be a stronger aggrega
tion.
The men who have been showing up
to great advantage thus far this sea
son are: J. C. Huston, '10, who
rowed on the varsity crew in his
Freshman year, and is one of the big
gest men in the eight; It. H. Reynolds,
'10, who rowed on last year's varsity
eight and is the only member of last
year's crew; J. W. Fitting, '10, who
rowed on his Freshman crew and
stroked for Coach Murphy on a Port
land Club crew last year; F. L. Wilde,
who rowed on the 1910 Freshman
crew, and K. Dole, J. A. Killian, N. M.
Day and K. Chamberlain, all of whom
rcwed on last year's victorious Fresh
man crew. S. G. Sweet, '09, is an
other candidate who may be fig
ured on.
