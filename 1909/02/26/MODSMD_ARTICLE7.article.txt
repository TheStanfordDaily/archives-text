# PLAN NEW QUARTERS
## TO BUILD NEW TRAINING HOUSE AND COMPLETE BLEACH ERS. Work to Begin During Summer Vacation and Improvements Will Be Completed in Autumn. 
### 
Another training-house will be add
ed to the equipment of the new ath
letic fields if the present plans of the
Board of Control are carried out to
a successful conclusion.
The new structure is proposed for
the use of the track men, and will
he, in all probability, located at the
southern end of the new oval. It is
intended to make the building an ex
act counterpart of the present train
ing-house, which was built at the
same time as the football bleachers.
According to Professor C. B. Wing of
the Department of Structural Engi
neering, the total cost of the bleachers
and training-house was in the neigh
borhood of $13,000. This would place
the cost of the training-house proper
Hi the proximity of $2000, which will
most likely approximate the cost of
the projected additional structure-
Furthermore, the gap in the bleacfr
f.rs on the northwest corner of the
football field will be filled in with nesv
bleachers.
The training-house will probably not
be built until next autumn, but the
bleachers will be constructed during
the summer vacation, so they will be
ready for the first games of the foot
ball season.
The desirability of having such a
building as the new track training
house has long been felt by those in
control of the affairs of the athletic
fields, and the move has been in con
templation for some time.
The present plans call for a build
ing with a broad porch from which
the track men may view the events
taking place on the cinder path or
field without intruding on the grounds.
This, while being a great convenience
to the men, will obviate difficulties
which have arisen in the past.
Tt will also be a great help in the
football season, as the present quar
ters scarcely accommodate the play
ei s, when there is both a Freshman
and a varsity game on the same day.
