# GOOD MARKS ARE MADE
## H.V. POOR '10, SHOWS FINE FORM IN THE JUMPS. 1912 Truck Men Capture Many Events. Meet Brings Out Some Promising Material. 
### 
The performances at the track
meet held Saturday showed a marked
improvement in the condition of the
men. While the time made in th> dif
ferent events was not up to tint mide
in meets held a', a corresponding iiiit
last year, yet good marks were set,
considering the amount of condition
ing the men have had.
Probably the greatest' surprise of
the day was the running of O B.
Smart, '12, a man hitherto unknown
on the track. Smart ran a remarkably
strong race in the mile, finishing with
a god sprint, easily taking thin;
place. The race was run in 4:45.4,
which makes Smart's showing all the
more commendable.
The second heat of the low hurdles
developed one of the prettiest races
of the day, all of the men clearing
the last row of hurdles almost simul
taneously, and at the finish only a
few inches separated the first three
men. C. S. Morris, '08, won the event,
breasting the tape barely an inch in
front of Captain Horton, who was
closely pressed by B. L. Gregg, '09,
for second place.
The 1912 track men showed to good
advantage in the meet, taking seven
first, six second and six third places.
Coleman, Peake and Wooley were the
particular stars for the Freshmen.
Coleman won his heat in the 220-yard
dash in the fast time of 23.1, and in
addition took his heat in the hundred
and won the final a shade under 10.3.
Peake won the pole vault at the
height of 10 feet 6 inches, besides tak
ing third in the hammer throw.
Wooley has developed wonderfully in
his hammer throwing and is rapidly
rounding into form. The hammer
throw was won by him with a heave
ot 135.8. In practice he has done
much better than this, his best mark
being about 141 feet.
Probably the most gratifying result
ol the meet was the discovery of a
broad jumper of ability in H. V. Poor,
*10. who won the broad jump with a
leap of 21 feet 1 inch. Poor also
cleared the bar at 5 feet 9 3-4 inches
in the jump. This will add an
other good man in events in which
Stanford was lamentably weak.
In the broad jump H. P. Brether
ton, '12, seriously sprained his knee,
and will be compelled to remain off
the track for some time. R. B. Wheel
er, '11, who has been recuperating
from the effects of straining a liga
ment in his leg some time ago, has
resumed light training and is expected
to be soon in good form again.

being about 141 feet.
Probably the most gratifying result
ol the meet was the discovery of a
broad jumper of ability in H. V. Poor,
*10. who won the broad jump with a
leap of 21 feet 1 inch. Poor also
cleared the bar at 5 feet 9 3-4 inches
in the jump. This will add an
other good man in events in which
Stanford was lamentably weak.
In the broad jump H. P. Brether
ton, '12, seriously sprained his knee,
and will be compelled to remain off
the track for some time. R. B. Wheel
er, '11, who has been recuperating
from the effects of straining a liga

resumed light training and is expected
to be soon in good form again.

The tryouts for the Freshman track
team, which is to meet Hip St. Mary's
team on Saturday, will be held tomor
row afternoon.
The performances at the track
meet held Saturday showed a marked
improvement in the condition of the
men. While the time made in th> dif
ferent events was not up to tint mide
in meets held a', a corresponding iiiit
last year, yet good marks were set,
considering the amount of condition
ing the men have had.
Probably the greatest' surprise of
the day was the running of O B.
Smart, '12, a man hitherto unknown
on the track. Smart ran a remarkably
strong race in the mile, finishing with
a god sprint, easily taking thin;
place. The race was run in 4:45.4,
which makes Smart's showing all the
more commendable.
The second heat of the low hurdles
developed one of the prettiest races
of the day, all of the men clearing
the last row of hurdles almost simul
taneously, and at the finish only a
few inches separated the first three
men. C. S. Morris, '08, won the event,
breasting the tape barely an inch in
front of Captain Horton, who was
closely pressed by B. L. Gregg, '09,
for second place.
The 1912 track men showed to good
advantage in the meet, taking seven
first, six second and six third places.
Coleman, Peake and Wooley were the
particular stars for the Freshmen.
Coleman won his heat in the 220-yard
dash in the fast time of 23.1, and in
addition took his heat in the hundred
and won the final a shade under 10.3.
Peake won the pole vault at the
height of 10 feet 6 inches, besides tak
ing third in the hammer throw.
Wooley has developed wonderfully in
his hammer throwing and is rapidly
rounding into form. The hammer
throw was won by him with a heave
ot 135.8. In practice he has done
much better than this, his best mark
being about 141 feet.

The tryouts for the Freshman track
team, which is to meet Hip St. Mary's
team on Saturday, will be held tomor
row afternoon.
The performances at the track
meet held Saturday showed a marked
improvement in the condition of the
men. While the time made in th> dif
ferent events was not up to tint mide
in meets held a', a corresponding iiiit
last year, yet good marks were set,
considering the amount of condition
ing the men have had.
Probably the greatest' surprise of
the day was the running of O B.
Smart, '12, a man hitherto unknown
on the track. Smart ran a remarkably
strong race in the mile, finishing with
a god sprint, easily taking thin;
place. The race was run in 4:45.4,
which makes Smart's showing all the
more commendable.
The second heat of the low hurdles
developed one of the prettiest races
of the day, all of the men clearing
the last row of hurdles almost simul
taneously, and at the finish only a
few inches separated the first three
men. C. S. Morris, '08, won the event,
breasting the tape barely an inch in
front of Captain Horton, who was
closely pressed by B. L. Gregg, '09,
for second place.
The 1912 track men showed to good
advantage in the meet, taking seven
first, six second and six third places.
Coleman, Peake and Wooley were the
particular stars for the Freshmen.
Coleman won his heat in the 220-yard
dash in the fast time of 23.1, and in
addition took his heat in the hundred
and won the final a shade under 10.3.
Peake won the pole vault at the
height of 10 feet 6 inches, besides tak
ing third in the hammer throw.
Wooley has developed wonderfully in
his hammer throwing and is rapidly
rounding into form. The hammer
throw was won by him with a heave
ot 135.8. In practice he has done
much better than this, his best mark
being about 141 feet.
Probably the most gratifying result
ol the meet was the discovery of a
broad jumper of ability in H. V. Poor,
*10. who won the broad jump with a
leap of 21 feet 1 inch. Poor also
cleared the bar at 5 feet 9 3-4 inches
in the jump. This will add an
other good man in events in which
Stanford was lamentably weak.
In the broad jump H. P. Brether
ton, '12, seriously sprained his knee,
and will be compelled to remain off
the track for some time. R. B. Wheel
er, '11, who has been recuperating
from the effects of straining a liga
ment in his leg some time ago, has
resumed light training and is expected
to be soon in good form again.
