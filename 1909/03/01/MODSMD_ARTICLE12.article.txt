# REV. MATT HUGHES PREACHES
## Pasadena Pastor Speaks at Memorial Services in Chapel Yesterday. 
### 
A particularly strong and forceful
sermon was preached yesterday morn
ing in the Chapel by the Rev. Matt
Hughes, pastor of the First Methodist
Church of Pasadena, who spoke on
the position occupied by the Christian
Church in modern reform movements.
Rev. Hughes' main contention was
that permanent reform can come
through the individual rather than
through an institution, and that since
the Church works through the indi
vidual, it. is in reality a more radical
reformer than any of our political
leaders.
The preacher characterized Jesus
Christ as the ideal and the greatest
reformer in the world's history, and
recommended that our so-called moral
crusaders of today study His life and
His methods.
Previous to the sermon, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner spoke shortly of the
life and character of Mrs. Jane Stan
ford, in whose memory the services
were conducted Sunday, and urged his
auditors to keep her high ideals in
mind in all their actions.
The choir, under the leadership of
Organist Tiuehrer, rendered a pleasing
ant hem.
