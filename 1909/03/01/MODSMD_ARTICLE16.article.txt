# Mills Basketball Team Defeated.
## 
### 
The Stanford basketball team de
feated Mills College Saturday in 1 lie
first of the series of intercollegiate
games, by the score 20-4. From the
first the Stanford team showed a su
premacy over its opponents, and at the
end of the first half the score was 7-1.
The work of the Stanford forwards
was unusually good, but it is due to
the excellent team work that the game
was so decisive. The ball was car
ried by mechanical clockwork down
tl-.e field and into the basket time af
ter time. The centers of the Mills
team, were good, but the forward*
were weak on throwing baskets. The
team had very good team work, how
ever, and put up a plucky and con
sistent fight to the end.
After the game the visitors were
served luncheon at Madrono Hall, and
left in the early part of the afternoon
for the city.
The Stanford team this week will
probably have a practice game with
Palo Alto High School Tuesday at
4:30, and also one with Redwood Hign
Wednesday. The first of the inter
collegiate games with California w'M
be played Saturday at Roble court.
