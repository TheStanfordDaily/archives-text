# THE 						SOPHOMORE THESPIANS SCORE
## Capable Acting and Numerous Situations Impress Large Audience at Production of "7-20-8." Play Is Plotless. 
### 
A large and responsive audience
filled the Assembly Hall Friday even
ing, when the Sophomore class pre
sented the humorous comedy, "7-20-8."
The play itself was decidedly farcical,
with small plot, depending almost en
tirely upon the situations. It is per
haps to be deplored that a play such
as this should have been selected. Ii
ib indeed brimful of laughs from the
audience, with .its exaggerated and
burlesque situations, but gives small
opportunity for the best sort of act
ing, especially that of character. To
meet the demands of such a play as
"7-20-8," certain characters must
reeds be exaggerated. The third act
contained the climax, and had this
proved the end, the performance would
have been much stronger.
The part of Mrs. Hypatia Bargiss
was well handled and ably portrayed.
In "Arms and the Man" last semes
ter, Miss M. Wilson showed good abil
ity, but in this play she is seen to
even better advantage. She acts with
force and finished style, and shows
herself particularly at ease on the
siage. In "7-20-S" she was the most
finished of the performers and upheld
every situation with rare and enjoy
able acting.
Assuredly, Miss E. Porter, playing
the part of Flos —the wilfull, childish,
but adorable, heroine of the play—
showed talent in an attractive ingenue
pert. Her voice was especially pleas
ing and under perfect control through
out most of the performance. Her
most effective scene came during the
third act. Nothing could have been
more realistic than her portrayal of
the terrified girl—afraid of the dark
and loneliness, who allowed her pride
to slip from her long enough to call
her lover to her side.
W. R. Pittinger played the part of
the lover, Courtney Corliss, with en
ergy and directness that made him
very acceptable. The difficult role of
love-making before the college audi
ence was assumed with dignity and
success by the young moralist and
knight-errant, who realized that, in
casting his boomerang, be might ob
tain for bis trouble the naive and win
some little coquette. Flos.
R. Woodville made an effective
father —weak when the alluring idea
of fame appeared; easy prey to the
mercenary literary impostor, Gasleigh,
find glad end to return to his
own quiet farm. His character-acting
112 bowed to advantage in its reserved

and quiet form in comparison to the
| exaggerations lent to the part of Sig
| nor Tamborini of Charles Christin and
, that, of Prof. Gasleigh ol K. Chamber-
I lain. He did not, however, make the
part as strong a one as it might have
been, sometimes not quite rising to
the situations.
C. A. Christin was decidedly clever,
and the exaggerations, which both he
and Chamberlain showed in their char
acter parts, were justified in the type
of the play—the farcical comedy.
Breezy, graceful, truly Italian, he
skipped on and off' the stage amid
bursts of applause from the convulsed
audience. His balancing feat on top
of the chair, his graceful dance with
the little maid and his mock suicide
in the end were indeed worthy of
praise. The play called for the ex
treme eccentricity which Christin
gave the part.
K. Chamberlain gave the appear
ance of the villain of the melodrama
rather than a real comedy character.
His makeup was the date of Charles
Dickins, instead of the period cov
ered by the play. His acting, how
ever, showed dramatic ability, with a
consistent idea of the character.
P. M. Ogilvie and Miss I). M. Glea
son as Mr. and Mrs. Hollyhock were
fairly successful in rather colorless
parts, showing to better advantage in
Act lit than in the first part of the
play.
As Jessie, the Maid, Miss R. A.
Sampson was vivacious and self-pos
sissed, with some opportunities for
acting well taken.
With Jobbins, the gardener, taken
by J. E. Higgins, and the Postman, by
C. C. Wheaton, the cast was com
plete.
As a whole, the play showed the
result of hard and concentrated work
on the part of the cast. Frank Ma
tl-ieu, acting as coach, has again
proved his ability to the Stanford au
dience.
It is to be hoped that the Sopho
more classes of the future will not
continue with this sort of farce-com
edy hereafter, but will rather follow
the precedent of the Sophomore play
o' '09, "You Never Can Tell," by Ber
nard Shaw, a decidedly strong and
effective comedy, with better situa
tions, more plot, sparkling dialogue
and stronger character parts than the
present type of play affords. The '09
class play was not better done, but
better worth doing, than "7-20-8."
