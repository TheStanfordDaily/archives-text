# Varsity Men Practice at Redwood.
## 
### 
The varsity crew men journeyed to
Redwood City on Friday afternoon to
practice in the eight-oared shell. The
weather was ideal and not a ripple
disturbed the surface of the water.
The men were able to spend a very
profitable day in the boat and the first
real hard work of the season was ex
perienced.
From now on a varsity or a Fresh
man crew will go up to Redwood ev
ery day to work-out in the eight.
