test being held on the grounds of tl»3
latter last Saturday afternoon. It was
a £,ame devoid of sensational inci
dents, yet interesting throughout, ow
ing to the even article ol' ball put up
I'y the opposing sides. Except in the
first inning, when a triple, followed
by a single, enabled Wilkeson to
earn the only run of the game, neither
team threatened to seny any one over
the plate. Scofield was sent in to do
the pitching for Stanford, and he jus
tified his choice by allowing the heavy
hitting Phoenix batters only two scat
tered safeties after the first period. He
was afforded strong support, barring
three careless, though inconsequential,
etrors He struck out three opposing
batters and issued no passes. The Var
sity i gain failed to hit with any de
gree of success, only two hits being
gathered off Leonard's delivery in the
entire nine innings. Ten Cardinal
hatsmen fell victims to the twirling
of the St. Mary's box artist. These
numerous strike-outs were the only
discouraging feature of the Varsity
showing. Bell and Tallant alone were
able to connect safely, the former ob
taining a clean two-bagger and ihe
h-tter p single.
