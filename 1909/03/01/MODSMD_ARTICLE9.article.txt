The question of securing advertis
ing from outside merchants is one
which is vital to the success of all
local publications and as such is a
matter for the consideration of the
community. The problem of under
graduate managers has been called
to the attention of the Executive Com
mittee, and the resolutions eliminating
advertising from all class programs
and similar mediums is the result.
This step taken by the executives of
the Student Body was a good one and
has aided materially in making the
efforts of the solicitors of advertising
more remunerative. The situation is
far from being solved, however. Stu
dents who have been engaged in so
liciting advertisements in near-by
cities state that, the difficulties to be
met are growing greater each year.
Their experience has been that the
merchants are loath to advertise in
local publications, principally because
they believe that money so spent is
not bringing them the returns that it
once did. We do not believe this is
so, and would suggest that members
Ol the community take it upon them
selves as individuals to aid Stanford
institutions by not only patronizing
advertisers, but by letting the adver
tisers know that their advertisements
are read. This can be done without
any inconvenience to any one. It is
only a matter of thoughtfulness, and
ii observed can do much to aid insti
tutions which work for the common
good of Stanford.
