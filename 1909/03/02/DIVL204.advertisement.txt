Clean shaving is a part of the
college man's gospel. It goes with
the exercise and outdoor life—with
good spirits and good health.
Five minutes a day spent with the Gillette
Safety Razor keeps the face shipshape. The
skin is soft and clear.
The Gillette Safety Razor lias a big following among College
men. The best shaved men on the campus use the GILLETTE.
The GILLETTE is kind to the face—the keenest and smoothest
shaving edge ever devised. Any man can give himself a clean, satis
fying shave with the GILLETTE —despite tough beard and tender
skin.
The GILLETTE is handy—no stropping, no honing. A saver of
time and money—$30.00 a year, ami tips.
There's no razor like the GILLETTE or that will do the work
of I he GILLETTE.
The Gillette Safety Razor is sold by thousands of dealers. A man
can get blades anywhere on the civilized globe.
Standard sets. $5.00.
