The interest that members of the
Junior Class have taken in the pro
posed Marathon race is encouraging
and the promptness with which the"
have signified their intention of enter
ing a team is commendable. The other
classes should follow at once and
elect or appoint some one to take
charge of the organizing of a set of
runners from each division of under
graduates.
The prospects of the Marathon be
coming a most successful interclass
event are growing better every day,
as many men who have never been
out for track have recently put spikes
on for the first time. To get the best
results, however, teams should be or
ganized and some systematic training
conducted.
