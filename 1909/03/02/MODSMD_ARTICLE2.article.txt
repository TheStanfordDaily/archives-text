# Set Definite Schedule for Games.
## 
### 
Owing to the delay in playing off
the remaining games in the handball
tournament, the committee has taken
the matter in its own hands, and has
assigned dates when the contests
must be played. If one of the con
testants fails to be on hand at the ap
pointed time, the series will be for
feited. This applies if both contestants
fail to keep the appointment, and they
will be eliminated from the tourna
ment.
As the semi-finals will begin on
next Saturday, the committee has ar
ranged the following schedule of the
remaining games, which must be
played off before that time:
Wednesday, March 3, at 3: A. H.
Myer, '10, vs. J. D. Beman, '12. Thurs
day, at 2:30: A. A. Burlingame vs. H.
Flinn, '11; at 3:30: E. L. McKeown
vs. G. I. Harnett, '12. Friday at 2:30:
H. S. Lyne, '10, vs. B. Wallace, '12; at
3:30: W. H. Newman, '12, vs. N. C.
Wilson, '12.
