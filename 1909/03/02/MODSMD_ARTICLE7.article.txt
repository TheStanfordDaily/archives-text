cided upon as Junior Day. Upon that
date the water tournament, which has
in previous years been the distin
guishing feature of the day, will be
held on Lagunita.
The program announced by Chair
man T. C. Henry consists of nine
events. Most prominent among these
is the interclass regatta. Each class
four-oared crew will race against time
over a course marked out by buoys,
and the crew which makes the fastest
time will receive numerals. The
course will be about three-quarters of
a mile in length.
A new feature introduced by the
IPIO committee will be high diving.
For this event, the present stand in
the lake will be raised to a height of

The swimming events will consist
of an interclass distance and relay

teams will cover the distance of fifty

to award prizes to the winners of each
e\ent, which should assure a large
number of entries.
