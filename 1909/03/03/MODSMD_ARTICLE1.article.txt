# CONTEST AT OAKLAND
## FRESHMEN WILL MEET ST. MARY'S COLLEGE SATURDAY F. M. Varsity Track Trials for Southern Trip to Be Held on Same Date. 
### 
The first contest of the 1912 track
team with outside athletes will take
piace next Saturday, when the Fresh
men journey to Oakland to meet the
St. Mary's College track men.
Only fifteen athletes will be taken
up to Oakland, and as a consequence
it is difficult for Trainer Moulton
and Captain Horton to name the men
who will compose the team.
The results of the tryouts yesterday
and of trials run during the next few
days will probably determine the per
sonnel of the team, which will be an
nounced in the latter part of the
week.
A lield day will be held on the track
Saturday morning, beginning at 9:45
sharp. This meet will be for the pur
pose of determining the Varsity men
who will go South on March 11, to
compete in the meet with the Univer
sity of Southern California. As ex
penses for only fifteen men, including
manager and coach, are allowed for
this trip, every man who will be tak
en must be good for more than one
event, and although a man may make
a good showing in one event in the
trial meet, it will not necessitate his
making the team.
Full distance will be run in all the
events and no handicaps allowed.
When seen this afternoon concern
ing the prediction, made by Trainer
Christie of California, that Stanford
would win the varsity intercollegiate
meet, Captain Horton said: "Christie
is altogether too sanguine of our vic
tory. He reckons his results on last
year's meet, while many of our point
winners of a year ago are not in col
lege at present, or, if they are, will
riot, compete.
"His statements have undoubtedly
served their purpose of reducing over
confidence among the California ath
letes and student body, but his inten
tions are so evident that he has de
ceived no one who has carefully read
the prophecy."
Through an oversight, the following
men were left off the rubbino list,
published last night: C. Coonan, '09,
W. M. Rawles, '10, W. W. Adams, '09,
A. E. Roth, '09.
