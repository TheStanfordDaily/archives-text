# STUDENT ADVISOR IS APPOINTED
## New Position Created by Dr. Jordan, and President A. E. Roth of Student Body Named for Important Postâ€”To Help New Men. 
### 
The inability of Dr. Thomas A.
Clark, Dean of Men at the University
of Illinois, to accept a similar posi
tion at Stanford has resulted in the
establishment here of a new office as
a substitute for the deanship. A. E.
Roth, '09, president of the Stanford
Student Body and prominently iden
tified with many branches of college
activities, has been chosen by Presi
dent Jordan to till the newly created
position and he has accepted. Roth
vill be known as "Students' Advisor,"
and it will be his duty to counsel stu
dents in all matters connected witn
their general welfare. His efforts
will be devoted mainly to underclass
men, and it is President Jordan's be
lief that Roth's most valuable services
will be rendered by instilling desir
able ideals into the minds of entering
students and in assisting them to "get
on to the ropes" in the proper manner.
As Students' Advisor, Roth will
wield no disciplinary powers, and he
will not be responsible in any way to
faculty committees. The position was
created at the instance of Dr. Jordan,
and the work of the new officer will
be carried on under the supervision
of the president.
When Roth assumes his new duties
next, fall, he will not be bound by any
rules or precedents, and the problems
with which he will meet will be dealt
with as they arise in the way that
may seem most expedient and wise.
The present plans are in an entirely
formative stage. Roth will be pro
vided with an office, where students
will be free to meet with him at all
times. A card catalogue of all Fresh
men and Sophomores is to be main

tained, and he will keep in personal
touch with these men, thus filling a
long-felt want. Freshmen especially
are to be the objects of individual at
tention on the part of the advisor, ad
vice being given them along scholastic
lines as well as in all affairs that are
related to their University career.
The office of "Students' Advisor"
Las already received the approval of
tlie Advisory Hoard of the Faculty
and the University Committee of the
Board of Trustees, and the Board of
Trustees will officially establish the
position at the regular monthly meet
ing next Friday afternoon.
In speaking of Roth's appointment,
Dr. Jordan said:
"Mr. Almon E. Roth will be ap
poitned on Friday by the Board of
Trustees as "Students' Advisor" for
next year. It is expected that, he will
become acquainted with all the low
er-class men, advising them in all
their difficulties, and especially trying
to give to the new students the proper
ideals of work and conduct, helping to
nuke of them the right kind of Stan
turd men. It is expected that he will
work out his own plans and use his
own methods, taking in time the place
which in many Eastern institutions is
called 'Dean of Undergraduates.' He
will begin with no precedents and few
instructions, and he is expected to do
the best things he can in the best
ways he can. The Faculty has en
tile confidence in his good sense and
sound judgment, and I am sure that
the Student Body shares this feeling
in the fullest degree. We shall all
pledge him, I am sure, our strongest
support."
