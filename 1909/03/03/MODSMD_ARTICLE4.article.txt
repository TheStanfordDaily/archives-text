# DURAND PERFECTS SEISMOGRAPH
## Invention Invaluable to Building Trades.â€”Measures Force of Earthquake Shocks. 
### 
Professor W. F. Durand of the Me
chanical Engineering department has
perfected on improvement of the seis
mograph, the earthquake measurer.
His invention, if it is as big a suc
cess as he hopes and expects, will
he of enormous usefulness in the con
struction of stone, brick and steel
buildings. The original seismograph
measured merely the direction of the
earthquake shock, while by means o f
Professor Durand's improvement, a
very important factor will enter into
earthquake calculations hereafter,
since the actual destroying force of
the shock at a certain place can be
exactly ascertained. Such a modifica
tion of the already immensely useful
seismograph has never before been
attempted, and, when completed, will
bo of measureless value to construct
ing engineers, particularly in San
Francisco, where a whole city is being
built up on foundations to be made es
pecially strong in anticipation of a
lepetition of the disaster of 190G.
The idea first came to Professor Du
rand when he was investigating the
buildings on the campus, demolished
by the earthquake. The machine will
be completed in the spring, and a

ptactical test of its value made. In
case it. is successful, models will be
set up in the Mt. Hamilton Observa
tory and Professor Morris' Observa
tory at. Berkeley.
