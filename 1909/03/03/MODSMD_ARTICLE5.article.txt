# NO PRIZE FOR SENIOR FARCE.
## Committee Will Probably Select Professional Play.—Will Consider Prof. Gray's Manuscript.

At a meeting of the Senior Farce
Committee held last night at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house, it was decided
that 110 prize will be offered for an
original manuscript this year. This
will in all probability necessitate the
selection of a professional play for
the occasion. Chairman G. N. Rich
ardson stated today that any definite
action in the choice of a play has been
postponed until the committee hears
the reading of an original play by
Professor H. G. Gray, "The People's
Choice." Professor Gray will read his
rlay tonight before the English Club
at the Pi Beta Phi house.
Another meeting of the committee
will be held on Friday afternoon at !"•
o'clock. The matter will be finally set
tled at this meeting.
