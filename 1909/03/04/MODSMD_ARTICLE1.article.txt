# TEAM LEAVES CAMPUS
## BASEBALL MEN OFF FOR GAMES IN LON ANGELES. Varsity to Engage St. Vincent's in Two Contests in South.— First Match Tomorrow. 
### 
The entire Varsity baseball squad,
with the exception of Pitcher Theile,
accompanied by Coach Presley, de
parted for lios Angeles this afternoon
on the 4:22 Coast line limited. Two
games, one tomorrow afternoon and
one on Saturday, are scheduled to be
played in the southern metropolis with
the St. Vincent's College nine. The
Cardinal players will arrive in Los
Angeles tomorrow morning. Leaving
for home immediately after the sec
ond game, (lie team will complete the
c.rcuit next Sunday morning, when
the campus will be reached.
Theile remains on the campus be
cause of the unsatisfactory condition
of his twirling arm, which has both
ered him for some time past. A torn
li'uscle lias interfered materially with
the effective use of his arm, and it
is thought that an extended rest may
relieve the trouble.
In the game tomorrow, Scofield and
Canterbury will officiate as the Cardi
nal battery, while the concluding con
test will find Smith in the box. Coach
Presley has not yet determined whom
to putin at the receiving end on that
o< casion. The members of the Var
sity squad making the southern trip
and the positions they will play are
as follows: Pitchers, Smith, Scofield;
catcher, Canterbury; first base. Hell;
second base, Scott; shortstop, Samp
son; third base. Mitchell; left field,
Tall ant; center field, Cadwalader;
right field. Ball. Ganong, McGregor.
St. Vincent's is credited with a
strong aggregation this year, and some
fast exhibitions of baseball should re
sult when bats are crossed with the
Varsity. When the University of Cal
ifornia team met the southerners,
about a fortnight ago, the series ended
in an even break. St. Vincent's won
the first game by a to 3 score, while
the Blue and Gold returned the com
pliment by annexing the second con
test to the tune of 8 to 3. Only three
ol the St. Vincent's players will be
remembered as participants in the se
ries held a year ago—Ybarando, Cal
lahan and O'Connor. In addition, G.
Kennedy, who figured prominently in
the Santa Clara line-up last spring,
appears on the St. Vincent's list this
season. Following are the men who
appeared in the series with California:
Schute. Workman, C. Kennedy, Sulli
v.m, Callahan, Ybarando. G. Kennedy,
O'Connor. Buckets.
