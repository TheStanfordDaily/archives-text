It is now several weeks since the
Executive Committee took up the mat
ter of a Trophy Room for Stanford,
and it appears that unless a greater
degree of activity is displayed by tin.'
members <>112 the committee instructed
to look into the possibility of the es
tablishment of such an institution, the
question will be no nearer a solu
tion than in years past. We dislike
to harp upon any one subject, as wu
may possibly be accused in this in
stance, but we do want to see a Tro
phy Room installed here before an
other semester has elapsed.
It was announced that the investi
gating committee of the executives
had met with a fair degree of success
in securing the option 011 several lo
cations which seem feasible for a tem
porary Trophy Room. With this much
gained at the outset, we would regret
to see further action on the part of
the Executive Committee delayed. It!
it. is, the rush of business which come-J
with the athletic season will make it
difficult to give the matter just con
s'deration. Other executive committees
1 ave considered the Trophy Room and
allowed the proposition to serve as
nothing more than an interesting topic
for discussion on meeting nights when
there was nothing else to talk about.
Is this to be repeated?
