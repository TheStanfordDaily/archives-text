# Law Students to Play Baseball.
## 
### 
The members of the Arcade Moot
Court have challenged the Court of
Abbots Inn to a match game of base
ball to be played tomorrow afternoon
on the Varsity diamond at 1:30. Th>?
challenge was drawn up in the form
of a legal summons, and posted on
the bulletin board of the Law Library.
By way of acceptance, the members
ei' Abbots Inn have placed on the
same board an equally formal answer.
Much interest has been manifested by
the law students in the contents of
the challenges and the impending con
tost. The umpires who have been chos
en to officiate during the struggle for
supremacy are Professors F. C. Wood
ward and J. W. Bingham of the Law
department.
