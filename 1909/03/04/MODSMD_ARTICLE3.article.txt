# SPEAKERS TELL OF SOCIAL SERVICE
## Sir Wilfred Grenfell, of Labrador, and Rev. Cecil Marack, '01, of San Francisco, Make Strong Addresses at Assembly This Morning. 
### 
This morning's third-hour Assembly,
which was conducted under the aus
pices of the Social Service Club, fur
nished the occasion for two interest
ing and forceful speeches dealing
with social service work and ideals.
Sir Wilfred Grenfell, who is noted
as an explorer, author and worker
among the Labrador fishermen, told
of the work that is being done anions
these northern people in the way of
bettering the conditions under which
they live. During the twenty years
that he has been working among the
people of Labrador, the saloons and
many of the other evil influences have
been to a large extent removed and
hospitals and churches erected. Co
operative supply stores have been es
tablished and many of the comforts
of civilization have been introduced
into the rough life of these people.
In addition to relating the history
ol' the work in Labrador, Sir Grenfell
spoke at some length on the ideals
which college men should carry with
them into life and of the "joy of so
cial service." "The measure of the
success of a man's life," said the
speaker, "is not to be found in the
clothing he wears, nor in his social
standing or in his intellectual emi
nence, but in the service which he
renders to humanity. Success is
measured by what we do and not by
what we have. The lives of all great
men were lives of social service. Thera
is a real pleasure and inspiration
to be found in aiding others, and
that is the 'Joy of Social Service.' "
The speaker made a strong appeal
for college men to enter upon this
work as their life occupation, saying
"Social service opens to the young
man or woman a splendid field of
achievement, which can be developed
in proportion as the worker puts his
energy and life into the work. The
real value of life lies in the accom
plishment of some worthy purpose.
The man who really counts is the
one who does things. I would rather
be one of the players who is carried
off the football field with head smash
ed in than be one of the thousands

who do nothing but look on and talk
about the players. There is a limit
less opportunity for achievement and
a great need for strong, virile men
to carry on the work that has been
so well begun."
Cecil Marack, '01, preceded Sir
Grenfell, and told in a forceful and
graphic manner of the existing condi
tions in San Francisco and the efforts
that, are being made to remedy them.
Marack was prominent during his un
dergraduate career, being identified
with many college activities and es
pecially with debating. Since leaving
college he has been engaged in min
isterial work in San Francisco.
"Social Service in the Cities" was
the subject of Marack's address, and
he told of the problems which are to
be met in the great cities and said
that the efforts of future reformers
must first be directed to betterment of
tne conditions which obtain in the
centers of population.
The first among the specific prob
lems in the cities is the need for prop
er care of the poor who are sick. In
particular, the spread of consumption
should be guarded against in a sys
tematic and scientific manner. In this
connection, Marack said that the deatii
rate in San Francisco from this dis
ease is the highest of any city of its
t;ize in the United States.
Second in importance to the con
servatism of the health of the commu
nity conies the need for a rational
treatment for drunkenness. The speak
er drew a very graphic picture of the
conditions which obtain in San Fran
cisco, where, he said, there are 3001
saloons and the treatment for chronic
alcoholism is "barbarous and medie-
Aal," in that drunkards are "impris
oned instead of being given medical
attention." The problems connected
with the unemployed and with home
less children are also pressing in the
metropolis, and little or no effort Is
being made to better conditions. "The
college man," said Marack, in conclu
sion, "should go out into life pre
pared to fight the organized influences
cif evil."
