# No Trip for Sophomore Cast.
## 
### 
As has been the custom of Sopho
more players in the past, it was the
intention of the cast of "7-20-8" to
take a trip away from the campus
during the spring vacation. The plan
has been given up, however, due to
the failure to receive the sanction of
the Student Affairs Committee. In
denying the trip, the committee passed
the following resolution to print to
day:
"The Student Affairs Committee
holds desirable the policy to refuse
permission to all dramatic companies
to perform away from the University.
Therefore, the request of the manager
of the Sophomore play, '7-20-B,' to
arrange for a southern trip, is denied."
