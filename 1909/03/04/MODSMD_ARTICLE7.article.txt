# TRACK MEN ARE ACTIVE
## WORK PROGRESSING WELL.-NEW POLES FOR VAULTERS. Officials for Meet Saturday Are Named Old Men to Sign Up Soon. 
### 
As a result of the trip of the Stan
ford track team to the conference
meet at Chicago last summer, and S.
H. Bellah's experiences in the Olym
pic games in London, an innovation
has been made in the style of pole
used in the vault here. During the
past few weeks a bamboo pole has
been given a trial by the van Iters, and
has proved such an unqualified suc
cess that Captain Horton has ordered
two more of the same kind, and will
possibly buy a third, if it meets with
the approval of L. Scott, '10, who is
lo inspect it.
These poles were first brought into
the notice of the athletic world
through the fact that Gilbert of Yale,
winner of the pole vault at the Olytn
pic games in London and world's
champion, used bamboo poles exclu
sively. One great advantage in their
use over that of the old-fashioned pole
i-i they are just as strong, while be
ing much lighter in weight.
The pleasant weather of the last few
veeks has materially aided in condi
tioning the men, who are now begin
ning to do some good work in the vari
ous events. Last evening J. O. Miller,
'08, was timed, covering the half-mile
ir. 2:02.1, while E. A. McGregor, 'OS,
ran the same distance in only one-fifth
o< a second slower time.
Several of the old track men, point
winners in past meets and good for
points in the intercollegiate contest,
have signified their intentions of
starting training soon. They will be
a welcome addition to the track squad
and will raise the slim chances of a
Cardinal victory a little higher.
Captain Horton wants all the men
out for the Marathon of St. Patrick's
Day to hand in their names to the
respective class captains, in order to
complete the arrangements for the
meet. All the members of the class
of 1908 who wish to enter the race
will meet at the track on Saturday
morning, before the trials, to elect a
captain for their team.
The tryouts for the southern trip
will be held at 9:45 Saturday morning.
