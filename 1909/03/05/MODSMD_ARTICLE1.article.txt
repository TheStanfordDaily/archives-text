# WILL MEET BERKELEY
## FIRST INTERCOLLEGIATE BASKETBALL GAME TOMORROW. Stanford Five in Good Condition.—California Has Advantage in Size and Weight. 
### 
The first, of the series of three in
torcollegate basketball games with
the University of California will be
played at Roble courts tomorrow
morning at II o'clock. No admission
will be charged, and all the women
students are urged to attend the game
and contribute their support to the
team.
Practice has been held, in spite of
the poor weather, regularly all this
semester as well as last, and the team
in unusually good playing form.
Miss S, E. Bundy, '10, this year's
captain, played on the 1907 and the
19on teams. She has generally played
center previous to this year, but is
now playing forward. She has the
confidence of the entire team. Mis.
Kundy registers from Los Angeles in
'he Department of English, and is a
member of the Gamma Phi Beta so
rority. Miss Edna Hayward, '10, th 1
manager, is a player of two years' pre
vious experience. She registers from
San Carlos, in the German depart
ment. Five other members of the team
are veterans of intercollegiate con
tests.
The team this year is in better con
dition than in either 1907 or 1908. The
work of the forwards has been par
ticularly good. There are no star
players in the Cardinal line-up, but the
team work is almost perfect. In the
preliminary games the team has play
ed with the greatest precision and ac
curacy.
The California team has the advan
tage of size and weight, the touch
center being much taller than the cor
responding Stanford player. If Cali
fornia wins the game tomorrow, it
will probably be due to this fact, ;is
the Stanford team undoubtedly has i
better knowledge of the game. In the
preliminary games, California defeat
ed Mills College by the score of 13-
X, while Stanford won from the same
team. 27-14 and 20-4. In the othe 1
practice games, Stanford has been
uniformly successful.
Between the halves of the game to
morrow there will be several exhibi
tion fencing matches.
The team will not be chosen until
just before the game, but the entire
squad is as follows: Miss S. E. Bundy
MO, captain; Miss E. Hayward, '10.
manager: Miss F. Swift, '08. Miss B
Haig, '10, Miss R. Sampson, '10. Miss
M Monteith. 'OS, Miss F. Woodhead,
'11, Miss L. Woodhead, '11, Miss S.
Hunter, '10, Miss M. Hunter. '12, Miss
H. Hardison, '10, and Miss B. Whe
l«in. '12.
