Dr. Grenfell did not ask for money,
lie is no beggar. He does his work
in faitli. And his work is the regen
eration of ihe people of a coast. Ii
is sane, practical, humanitarian work.
I fancy Stanford would like to help
him, as Harvard and Yale and Ox
ford have helped. I do not wish to
begin a personal canvass. But I shall
he glad to receive any amounts, great
or small, which students or faculty
would like to give. I want to send
Dr. Grenfell $100. I have already $15.
Who will help? The money will go
toward the support of a bed for crip
pled children in St. Anthony's Hospi
tal, of which Dr. Grenfell spoke. Who
will help? Send checks or cash to
me, or to the Bookstore, marked, "For
Dr. Grenfell."
