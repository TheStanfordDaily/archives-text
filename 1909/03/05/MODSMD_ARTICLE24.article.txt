## 
### 
Work has commenced 011 the con
struction of three new tennis courts
:n the field directly in front of En
c'na Hall. These courts were ordered
some time ago by the Board of Con
trol, and would have been in use now
had it not been for the heavy rains.
They will only have a dirt surface at
present, but it is expected that they
will be regraded and oiled next sum
mer, after the spring rains have hard
ened and packed them down.
