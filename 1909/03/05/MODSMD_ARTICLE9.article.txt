We are not alone in our desire to
have a club for men organized and i
building erected on the campus. At
the University of Illinois the formation
of an organization and the building
of this sort of a meeting place has
ben decided upon and an actual start
made. The methods utilized by the
alumni and students at the institution
to put the proposition on a working
basis may be considered, we believe,
with profit here.
The keynote of the procedure oi'
our contemporaries in the East has
been immediate action. To this end
they formed an organization and
drew up a constitution and by-laws,
elected officials and set about collect
ing funds. In this last-named partic
ular the plan adopted by the Illinois
men might be worked out here to ad
vantage. Every member of the Stu
dent Body desirous of becoming a
member of the Union, as the organi
zation is termed, is requested to pay
annual dues, dating from the adop
tion of the constitution, until the
building is complete. The amount is
purely nominal—2s cents in this
case—but the returns from the stu
dents interested, when totaled over a
year or more, will help defray a num
ber of the minor expenses necessary
to the construction of the clubhouse.
The committee appointed to look
into the matter of a local clubhouse
has not as yet announced any plan by
which revenue can be derived from
(lie undergraduates, and we submit
this scheme as a feasible one. The
amount charged each year would prob
ably have to be increased here be
cause of the smaller number of stu
dents.
