A poster announcing the Junior Op- j
era was maliciously destroyed last
evening, after it had been pasted on
the small brick building adjacent to
the Inn. While we believe that the
practice of placing notices on this
structure is one that should be dis
couraged, we do not think that the act
of destruction was in any way jus
tified in view of precedent.
