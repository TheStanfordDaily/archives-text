# VARSITY AND ST. IGNATIUS WILL MEET AT 2:20.
## Victory Expected for Cardinal Nine. Scofield Will Start the Game in the Box. 
### 
Tomorrow, Founders' Day, the Var
sity nine will meet St. Ignatius on the
Varsity diamond. The game will start
at 2:30, with tlie usual charge for ad
mission.
In past years the Varsity has found
the college team to lie easy prey,
and it is thought that tomorrow will
add another victory to the Cardinal
string.
Stanford's battery will be made up of
of Scofield or L. Smith, and Canter
bury behind the bat. Scofield will
probably start the game, in recogni
tion of the good work he did against
St. Vincent's last Friday.
The Varsity line-up is: Catcher,
Canterbury; pitchers, Scofield and L
Smith; first base, Pell: second base,
Scott; shortstop, Sampson; third base,
Mitchell; outfielders, Tallant, Cadwal
ader, MacGregor, Ball.
