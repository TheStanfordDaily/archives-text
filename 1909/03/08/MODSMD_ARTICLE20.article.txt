# LOSE GAME TO CALIFORNIA.
## Basketball Team Is Defeated in First Contest of Intercollegiate Series. 
### 
The University of California won
the first of the series of basketball
games scheduled with Stanford, by the
score of 18-7. The court was so wet,
and muddy that the Stanford team
had little chance against the superior
weight and size of the opposing team.
During the first few seconds of
play, Stanford scored, but later the
ball was in California territory the
greater part of the time, and at the
end of the first half the score stool
11-2.
The work of Miss W. Kendrick, '11,
who played forward for California, was
remarkable, and the centers also
played a good game. Stanford relied
upon consistent and steady team work
rather than upon star plays, and was
unable to succeed on account of the
slippery court. The California touch
cc liter was much taller than her op
ponent, and was almost always able
tc. send the ball to the California for
wards.
In spite of the rain, the game was
well attended, quite a delegation com
ing from Berkeley. Stanford was rep
resented by a large and enthusiastic
number of students, who gave the team
steady support.
Miss A. Egy of Mills College acted
as referee. Miss S. Hyatt, '07, Miss
M. James, '10, Miss B. Gluckman, '10,

judges.
