# VARSITY BREAKS EVEN
## STANFORD BESTS ST. VINCENT'S IN INITIAL CONTEST. Heavy Rain Precludes Conclusion of Second Game, Which Goes to Southerners, Score 7-0. 
### 
The Varsity baseball squad, accom
panied by Coach Presley, returned to
the campus yesterday morning, after
having broken even in the two-game
series with St. Vincent's College at
Los Angeles.
In the first game, which took place
last Friday afternoon on the Saints'
diamond, the Varsity secured a well
errned victory after nine innings of
i c'ose play, the score being G to 4. Sco
il eld's heady pitching was easily the
feature of the game, and it was large
ly his steadiness at critical stages
that prevented St. Vincent's from
scoring more runs. Ten Southerners
fanned the air in an endeavor to con
nect with Scofield's plentiful store of
curves. Captain Sampson also dis
tinguished himself by slamming out a
three-bagger in the fifth inning, when
tbe bases were full. This gave Stan
lord a lead of two runs, which tho
Collegians were unable to overcome.
The second contest was rendered
unsatisfactory, in that it was ended
by a heavy downpour of rain, the Los
Angeles players being credited with a
7-0 victory at the close of five innings
of play. Up to the time of the fifth
inning, neither team had gained any
appreciable advantage. In their half
of this period, the opposing players
piled up five runs as the result of two
singles and an epidemic of unavoid
able errors on the Stanford side. The
rain fell in torrents at this time and
accurate handling of the elusive leath
er sphere was practically impossible.
Effective pitching became out of the
question. Prior to the last half-inning
of the game, both teams fielded in er
rorless fashion, and had unfavorable
weather not interfered, a different re
sult might have been recorded.
FIRST GAME
All of the Varsity runs were made
in two consecutive innings by Scott,
tne first man up in the fourth, who
singled, stole second, advanced to
third on Cadwalader's safety and came
•home on Sampson's high fly to center
field. Clever base-running and Bell's
sacrifice served to send Cadwalader
across the plate with the second tally.
Fn the following inning, four addi
t'onal runs were obtained. With
Seofield, Canterbury and Scott 011 the
bases. Buckles walked Cadwalader,
forcing in a run. At this opportune
moment, Sampson lined out a three
bagger, scoring Canterbury, Scott and
Cadwalader.
St. Vincent's made its four tallies,
one each in the first two frames and
two in the fourth.
The summary: R. H. E.
Stanford 6 5 5
St. Vincent's 4 4 3
SECOND GAME.
At 110 time in the second contest
were the Cardinal batsmen able to hit
French safely, and strong support
prevented any approach to the homo
plate.
St. Vincent's opened the scoring in
the third session, when West and
French succeeded in bringing in two
tallies. Five runs were added in the

fifth, the slippery condition of the
diamond and ball being largely re
sponsible for the scores.
The line-ups of the two teams were
substantially the same in both games.
Smith replaced Scofield on the sec
ond occasion, while for St. Vincent's
French officiated on the mound in
place of Buckles. Carrigan substi
tuted for Hickson in center garden.

diamond, the Varsity secured a well
errned victory after nine innings of
i c'ose play, the score being G to 4. Sco
il eld's heady pitching was easily the
feature of the game, and it was large
ly his steadiness at critical stages
that prevented St. Vincent's from
scoring more runs. Ten Southerners
fanned the air in an endeavor to con
nect with Scofield's plentiful store of
curves. Captain Sampson also dis
tinguished himself by slamming out a
three-bagger in the fifth inning, when
tbe bases were full. This gave Stan
lord a lead of two runs, which tho
Collegians were unable to overcome.
The second contest was rendered
unsatisfactory, in that it was ended
by a heavy downpour of rain, the Los
Angeles players being credited with a
7-0 victory at the close of five innings
of play. Up to the time of the fifth
inning, neither team had gained any
appreciable advantage. In their half
of this period, the opposing players
piled up five runs as the result of two
singles and an epidemic of unavoid
able errors on the Stanford side. The
rain fell in torrents at this time and
accurate handling of the elusive leath
er sphere was practically impossible.
Effective pitching became out of the
question. Prior to the last half-inning
of the game, both teams fielded in er
rorless fashion, and had unfavorable
weather not interfered, a different re
sult might have been recorded.
FIRST GAME
All of the Varsity runs were made
in two consecutive innings by Scott,
tne first man up in the fourth, who
singled, stole second, advanced to
third on Cadwalader's safety and came
•home on Sampson's high fly to center
field. Clever base-running and Bell's
sacrifice served to send Cadwalader
across the plate with the second tally.
Fn the following inning, four addi
t'onal runs were obtained. With
Seofield, Canterbury and Scott 011 the
bases. Buckles walked Cadwalader,
forcing in a run. At this opportune
moment, Sampson lined out a three
bagger, scoring Canterbury, Scott and
Cadwalader.
St. Vincent's made its four tallies,
one each in the first two frames and
two in the fourth.
The summary: R. H. E.
Stanford 6 5 5
St. Vincent's 4 4 3
SECOND GAME.
At 110 time in the second contest
were the Cardinal batsmen able to hit
French safely, and strong support
prevented any approach to the homo
plate.
St. Vincent's opened the scoring in
the third session, when West and
French succeeded in bringing in two
tallies. Five runs were added in the

fifth, the slippery condition of the
diamond and ball being largely re
sponsible for the scores.
The line-ups of the two teams were
substantially the same in both games.
Smith replaced Scofield on the sec
ond occasion, while for St. Vincent's
French officiated on the mound in
place of Buckles. Carrigan substi
tuted for Hickson in center garden.
The summary: R. H. E.
Stanford 0 2 7
St. Vincent's 7 4 0
