The 1912 track team easily defeated
St. Mary's College on Saturday by a
score of 78 to 44. This score, while
not quite as large as that rolled up by
the California Freshmen, shows good
work by the Cardinal team.
Captain Horton, who was a specta
tor at the meet, states that the men
ran very good races and performed
satisfactorily in all the events. Times
were poor, as the track was very small
and not in the best of condition.

poned Saturday on account of the rain,
will be held tomorrow afternoon at 1

the same as announced in last Thurs
day's paper.
Although many of the old men who
are to be taken South with the track
team have been practically decided
upon, the meet Saturday will serve a.s
a basis for a decision in several cases,
particularly in the 100 and 220-vard
dashes and the one and two-mile runs.
J. R. Holman. '09, today made his
appearance on the track for the first
time this year. The addition of this
point-winner to the list of track ath
letes will materially increase the
chances for a Stanford victory this
spring.
L. Scott, '10, cleared the bar in the
pole vault today at a height of 11 feet
4 inches, and was only prevented from
clearing 11.7 by his unfamiliaritv with
the bamboo pole used.
