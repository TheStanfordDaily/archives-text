# FOUNDERS EULOGIZED
## DR. JORDAN PAYS HIGH TRIBUTE TO MRS. JANE L. STANFORD. Anniversary Assembly Is Also Addressed by Professor A.C. Miller of Berkeley. 
### 
The anniversary of Founders' Day
was fittingly observed yesterday at a
special Assembly, which occurred at
the third hour. Addresses were made
by Dr. Jordan and by Professor A. C.
Miller of the University of California.
A feature of the gathering was the
special music rendered by the choir.
Dr. Jordan's discourse was a eulogy
of the life and work of Mrs. Jane
Lathrop Stanford and a narration of
the history of the University during
t lie so-called "dark days," between
1893 and 1899, when the ultimate fate
of the institution was in constant
doubt.
Dr. Jordan related the history of
the University from its inception and
endowment in 1891 by Senator Lelanu
Stanford. The new institution pros
pered the first two years of its his
tory, but the death of Senator Stan
ford in 1893 plunged it into a multi
tude of difficulties. The vast estate
fell into the hands of the courts and,
pending a settlement, it was impos
sitle to secure'from it any funds with
which to carry on the University. Va
rious expedients were resorted to in
this extremity in order to provide suf
ficient money to pay the running ex
penses of the institution. The exper
iment farms, which had hitherto been
run at a loss, were made, under the
careful supervision of Mrs. Stanford,
to yield a considerable annual prof
it Mrs. Stanford also devoted the
major part of her personal allowance
to the payment of the more pressing
of the University expenses, thus de
piiving herself that the college might
be maintained. /
At the time when the estate was
about to be settled up and the finan
cial difficulties seemed to be practi
cally past, a new complication arose.
The government sued on an injunction
which tied tip all the property of the
estate. The government had ad
vanced money to the Southern Pacific
Crmpany, when its transcontinental
line was built, and although this
money was not yet due, the officials
sought to secure the payment by levy
ing on the Stanford properties.
After carrying the case through aii
the lower tribunals to the Supreme
Court of the United States, the gov
ernment was finally defeated, and the
properties were turned over to Mrs.
Stanford, who in turn conveyed them
to the University.
Dr. Jordan narrated the struggles
which were undergone during this
lime, and showed how Mrs. Stanford
bad, by her unselfish devotion and
sacrifices, made possible the continued
existence of the University. An ex
tract from a letter written by her to
Dr. Jordan on September 3, 1898,
shows very clearly her devotion to
the University. She said: "Every
dollar I can rightfully call mine is
sacredly laid upon the altar of my
lcve for the University, and thus it
ever shall be."
In conclusion Dr. Jordan said:
"Hers was a life of the most, perfect
devotion to both her own and her hus-
