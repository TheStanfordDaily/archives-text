Our attention has been called to tlio
fact that certain individuals who are
engaged in studying and preparing
lor debates have been in the habit of
taking books from the stacks of the
Library for their own use and keep
ing them for upwards of a week, to
the decided inconvenience of other
students attempting to prepare on
similar topics. This is a form of self
ishness which no one will attempt to
defend, and it should be eliminated.
