# MAKE FURTHER PLANS FOR PROM.
## Bismarck Cafe Will Furnish Supper. New Idea for Programs,â€”Patrons and Patronesses Invited. 
### 
The Junior Prom Committee held a
meeting recently at the Alpha Phi
house, and several important matters
connected with the holding of the
dance were disposed of. It was de
cided to give the contract for the ca
tering to the Bismarck Cafe of San
Francisco. A number of innovations
will be introduced at the supper,
which should excel those served at
previous Proms. One of these innova
tions will be the serving of ice cream
molded in various original forms.
The contract for the programs was
given the Bookstore. The cards will
be of an entirely new form, the idea
being taken from the programs of a
recent Cornell Prom. The space op
posite each dance will be divided into
two parts, allowing room not only for
the lady's name, but also for that of
her escort. This idea will have the
great advantage of doing away with
any confusion that might otherwise
arise.
The following have been invited by
the committee to act as patrons and
patronesses: Dr. and Mrs. David
Starr Jordan, Dr. and Mrs. J. C. Bran
ner, Dr. and Mrs. F. Angel 1, Dr. and
Mrs. W. F. Durand, Mr. and Mrs. C. D.
Marx, Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Ryan and
Mrs. E. Allan.
Up to yesterday afternoon 78 of the
125 tickets to be disposed of had been
sold, and the rest are expected to go
rapidly. Those who intend to pur
chase a ticket should do so at once,
in order not to be disappointed, as the
committee has set an absolute limit
of 125 on the number to be sold.
