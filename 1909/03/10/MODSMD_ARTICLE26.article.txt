# "CHAPPIE" APPEARS TOMORROW
## Editorials Play Up Lent and the Irish. Good Take-Off on Sophomore Play. 
### 
The Chaparral will appear toraor
iow. The issue is rich with writings
and drawing's of the entire staff and
many outside contributors. The edi
torials deal with Lent, the Stanford
Marathon on St. Patrick's Day and the
Irish. The "Now That" on "Lent" is
an amusing composition, capably han
dling an abundant play of words on
"Lent."
The feature article is "7 Come 11,"
a witty, satirical take-off on the Soph
omore comedy. Another worthy-of
nention pieceâ€”"Care of the Baby,
from Hie Homely Ladies' Journal," is
a pathetic bit of realism.
The best art contribution is a se
ries of eight drawings. They are truly
clever and original. The series, with
their accompanying verses, portray in
cidents of Stanford life through the
medium of playing cards.
F. M. Ackley, '10, contributes a
beautiful half-tone of Chappie's fa
vorite in Lent. Good drawings by
Freshmen contributors, A. T. King and
S Dixon, and A. L. Kocker's. '09, clev
er bookplate No. 2, make up the rest
of the art work.
The longer articles are not signed
ir- this issue for reasons not yet
stated. The comic paper will be on
s; le at 8:15 tomorrow morning.
