# VICTORY FOR VARSITY
## ST. IGNATIUS OVERWHELMED BY DECISIVE SCORE, 13-5. Stanford Registers Seventeen Hits. Scofield Pitches Well, Allowing But One Single. 
### 
In a game made up of a bewilder
ing succession of hits and runs, Stan
ford won from the St. Ignatius nine
by the score of 13-5 yesterday after
noon on the Varsity diamond. The
Varsity scored runs in all innings in
which it was at bat, with the ex
ception of the first. St. Ignatius gave
a poor exhibition of baseball, and was
decidedly below the standard of the
Cardinal team. The visiting nine
changed pitchers several times dur
ing the game, but was unable to hold
down the Stanford batters, practical
ly every one of whom made at least
one hit. The total hits mounted up to
seventeen, of which two were two
baggers, both made by Scofield. Be
sides batting well, Scofield pitched a
steady game, allowing only one hit.
St. Ignatius scored four of its runs
in the second inning, almost entire
ly on errors by the home team, Cap
tain Sampson being noticeably below
grade in this respect.
