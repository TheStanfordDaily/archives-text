# VARSITY TO MEET SANTA CLARA.
## Local Players Are Now Hitting the Ball Hard, and Close Game Should Result. 
### 
There will be another ball game be
tween the Varsity and the Santa Clara
ball-tossers on the local diamond to
morrow afternoon, commencing at
3:45. This will be the fourth meet
ing of the two teams, the results to
date being somewhat in favor of the
Catholic nine. Judging by the past
few games, the Cardinal batters have
at last emerged from their prolonged
hitting slump, and they are confident
that they will even up the record with
the collegians in tomorrow's contest.
Friene, who yesterday held the Chi
cago White Sox down to a 3-0 score,
will probably occupy the mound for
the visitors.
The line-ups of the two teams will
1c in large part the same as in the
former clashes. Smith is schedule!
to twirl for the Stanford side, and
McGregor, in Canterbury's enforced
absence, will don the protector. The
customary admission fee will be
charged.
