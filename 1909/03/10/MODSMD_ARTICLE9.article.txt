The proposition submitted to the
men of the University yesterday by
Piesident A. E. Roth of the Student
Body appears to contain the elements
ol a feasible plan of student control,
and, as such, it is to be welcomed by
every one who has the welfare of the
institution at heart. We do not be
lieve the organization contemplated
will give to undergraduates any great
quantity of power. That could not be
expected at the outset. It does, how
ever, provide for some recognized
body of students which can meet the
members of the Faculty, and by pre
senting the viewpoint of the under
graduate, hope to bring about perfect,
harmony.
To us it would seem to be the first
stepping-stone to the desirable end —
student control. Believing this, wj
would see the constitution of the
'University Conference of Leland
Stanford .Junior University," first, ac
cepted unanimously, and then lived
up to in every particular. A com
plete copy of the document is to be
found in other columns of this pa
per. and it should be carefully read
and considered before a Student Hody
meeting is called.
