# VARSITY HITS WELL
## FAST GAME WON FROM SANTA CLAIM COLLEGIANS. Numerous Hits Made on Both Sides But Good Support Holds Down Score. 
### 
The Varsity evened up matters with
the Santa Clara nine this afternoon by
capturing one of the fastest and most
interesting games that has been seen
here this season. The final score was
4-2. Though errors were frequent,
the playing was snappy throughout
the nine innings and sensational field
ing was the order of the day. The
Varsity continued its hitting streak,
and found little difficulty in solving
Friene's delivery. Seven hits were
I gathered off the latter and all but
two of the local players fattened their
batting averages. Smith, who was in
the box for Stanford, allowed the vis
iters five safeties. However, he was
hit rather freely.
For Stanford, Sampson, Cadwalader
and Ganong figured prominently in
the field and covered a large amount
oi territory. Cadwalader's stop of
Ream's terrific liner in the eighth and
Ganong's catch of Donovan's fly over
shortstop in the ninth were particu
larly noteworthy. Mitchell had an off
day on the third bag, and was guilty
o. four errors out of eight chances.
Salberg played the best game of the
day, hitting safely twice and accepting
fi\e hard chances at second. His one
banded stop of Smith's swift grounder
in the seventh was the feature of the
game.
Cadwalader, the first man to face
Friene in the initial inning, completed
the circuit as the result of Donovan's
!'; ilure to catch bis high fly between
!elt and center. The second score was
I made by Ganong'in the fifth on a
ciean hit, pitcher's error and Smith's
single. In the seventh, Mitchell drow
a smashing single through short, ad
vanced to second on Ganong's pretty
sacrifice bunt and tallied on Ball's
hot fly to center. Cadwalader added
the fourth run in the eighth on a
clean single, a steal and Bell's two
bagger.
Santa Clara's two runs were made
by McGovern and Donovan in the
sixth and seventh frames. The Car
dinal lead was never seriously men
aced after the seventh inning. Sal
berg was deprived of a homer by
failing to touch the third bag in the
last inning.
