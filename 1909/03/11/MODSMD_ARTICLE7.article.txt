The movement for the establishment,
of a permanent trophy room at this
University has finally borne tangible
results. At its weekly meeting last
night, Ihe Executive Committee ac
cepted the offer of a room in the Li
brary for use as a temporary trophy
depository. The quarters which have
lately served as a reading room for
members of the faculty were selected
as the most suitable location for the
purpose in view. Situated on the
ground floor of Hie Library, imme
diately adjoining one of the front en
trances, it will afford all the con
veniences that are to be desired for
a trophy room. Interested person-s
v/ill be privileged to view the collec
tion of emblems without being forced
to go far out of their way.
Manager Stewart was instructed to
purchase whatever glass cases and
other fittings that may be deemed nec
essary for the proper exhibition of the
Clips and other trophies in the posses
sion of the Student Body. Stewart
will make arrangements for an early
installation of this equipmeV. and the
trophies will be opened to p iblic in
spection as soon as the cases arrive.
Banners and pictures will be hung on
the walls of the room.
