Choosing a Tie
NOW IS THE TIME
We wish we had a telephone
hitched to the ear of every man
in town. We have such a beau
tiful display of spring NECK
WEAR, that we want to tell all
our friends about it. The man
who finds it a bore to hunt Ties
certainly has not been here.
Come in with as many particu
lar notions as you please, and
you will go out smiling, and
with two or three Scarfs in your
pocket and one around your
neck.
It's easy to lasso men, when
you have the right sort of lasso.
