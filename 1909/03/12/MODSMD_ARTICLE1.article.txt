# FAVOR VARSITY FOURS
## MURPHY AND REYNOLDS WOULD SEE REGATTA INCREASED. Boating Men Think Addition of Race Next Year Will Make Regatta More Important. 
### 
The intercollegiate regatta this year
with the University of California
promises to be the most important
event of its kind held on the Coast
in many years, but the plans which
are favored by local boating men con
template even greater improvement in
succeeding seasons. The plan which
Dan Murphy favors and Captain Rey
nolds is anxious to see put into ef
fcct before long is that of instituting
a varsity four, in addition to the var
sity eight and Freshman eight. It is
his idea this will add to the interest
oi rowing here and among the peo
ple of the cities about the bay, and
eventually lead to the same enthusi
asm which marks the big aquatic
events in the East. Dan favors the
ii'ea because it will tend to increase
the squad and give him valuable ma
terial for the eight. His ideas are
best told in an interview given recent
ly. He said:
"I have spoken to several of the
boys regarding an extra race in the
regatta, and they are all in favor of
it. At the present time, we have
enough men out of which T can pick
a good crew, but at the end of the
season, when the eight is practically
picked, the other men quit, and this
Raves us in a bad way. If soAMething
happened a day or so before the race
tv) any of the men, we would not have
a suitable substitute. In putting a
four-oared race in the regatta 1 would
always have two substitutes for either
side of the eight, by taking out the
men from the four-oared shell. In
case this should happen, Freshmen
could take the place or places left
vacant in the four, as their race would
be the first and they would have plen
ty of time to recuperate by the time
the four was ready to row."
Captain Reynolds expressed himself
as follows:
"I am in favor of adding another
race, but we cannot attempt it this
year. In the first place, it is too late
in the season, and secondly, we will
need at the least one extra four-oared
shell. There is no reason why the
Intercollegiate Regatta should not
arouse the interest it does in the East,
and I think with a four-oared race in
the regatta next year we will have
more men out training, and from a
spectator's point of view, three races
will he very much more interesting."
