A young university is always poor
in traditions. Stanford is no excep
tion to this rule, although the ('Di
versity may well lie proud of some of
the distinctive features of its life.
Time will undoubtedly remedy any de
ficiency which exists in this respect
and innovations should always be
looked upon with suspicion. They
n-11 st stand the test of time. Within
the last few weeks, however, there
has grown up a movement with which
v\e are heartily in accord and which
\\o desire to urge upon the graduat
ing class. This is the so-called cus
tom of Senior singing. At many col
leges* in the United States the men
of the Senior class gather once a
week at a common meeting place and
ypend a half-hour together with their
college songs. Alumni of these insti
tutions have a warm feeling for this
simple tradition, it sent them out into
1 !i p world close together, and in many
its influence lasted through l'fe.
The custom of Senior singing is one
which may be introduced with confi
deuce, and it is worthy of a serious
consideration by the Senior class.
