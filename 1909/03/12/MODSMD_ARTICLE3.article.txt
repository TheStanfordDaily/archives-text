# TO PLAY AWAY FROM CAMPUS.
## Varsity and Santa Clara Teams Will Meet on College Diamond Tomorrow Afternoon. 
### 
The Santa Clara College diamond
will be the scene of the fifth game of
the series between the Varsity and
Santa Clarans tomorrow afternoon.
The local players will leave Palo Alto
at 12:40, and the contest is scheduled
to begin at 2:30.
With two victories now standing to
the credit of each nine, a hotly eon
tested game should result tomorrow.
The Varsity has been hitting the ball
hard of late and with a little im
provement in the quality of fielding
should secure the long end of the
s< ore.
The Cardinal battery will probably
consist of Theile and Canterbury. Sco
field and McGregor may be substituted
during the course of the afternoon.
Theile's arm has improved somewhat
and he is now in fairly good pitching
form. In Scott's absence Cadwalader
will again cover second base. The
complete line-up of the Stanford team
fellows: Pitchers, Theile, Scofield;
catchers, Canterbury, McGregor; first
base, Bell; second base, Cadwalader;
third base, Mitchell; shortstop, Samp
son; left field, Tallant; center field,
Ganong; right field, Ball.
