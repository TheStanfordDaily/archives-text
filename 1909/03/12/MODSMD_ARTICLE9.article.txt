### 
At a meeting of the German Club
held last night at the home of C. C.
Wheaton of Palo Alto, the scenes of
"Pyramis and Thisbe," from the "Mid

si-mmer Night's Dream," were given.
Those who took part were A. Cobert,
'08, H. Rosse, '10, R. N. Wooster, '10.
A L. Siefert, '11, C. C. Wheaton, '11.
and C. Schaupp, '12.
The play was given for the mem
bers of the German Club and their
guests. This style of entertainment
has proven successful not only for the
amusement given, but also from the
practice in German (hat the players
receive.
The women of the club are planning
to give a similar skit some time in the
near fature.
