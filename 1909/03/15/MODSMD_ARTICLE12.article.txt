Representatives of this University
won a well-earned victory over the
ISlue and Gold 011 Saturday. The Stan
ford women's basketball team is to be
commended on the result of the sec
ond intercollegiate match. A season
which has been marked by more con
sistent and hard practice cannot prob
ably be found in the annals of the
University than the one now nearing
its close. The spirit shown by the
women of the University reflects most
favorably on the name of Stanford.
