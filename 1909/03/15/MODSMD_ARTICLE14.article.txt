# BISPHAM PLEASES IN CONCERT
## Famous Baritone Baritone Renders Excellent Program in Assembly Hall Friday Night. 
### 
David Bispham demonstrated Friday
evening that, despite his years, 11 i
voice retained its power to please. The
splendid baritone entertained an au
dience much smaller than he deserved,
there being many seats in Assembly
Hall that were unoccupied.
No group of his selections, which
were arranged under the heads "OKI
Songs," "Songs by Classical Compos
trs," "Operatic Songs" and "Modern
Songs," can be said to have been as
h whole more effective than any oth
er, as the audience showed its pleas
ure at various songs of each kind.
Handel's "Where'er You Walk," the
opening number, was well received.
Bispham made a short speech, explain
ing "The Frost Scene," from Purcell's
opera "King Arthur," after which his
rendition of the selection realized in
the highest possible degree the awak
ening in the snow of the Spirit of the
North. "Down Among the Dead Men,"
an old Jacobin song, had a hearty,
n.Uicking character, which Bispham
used to fine advantage.
Bispham achieved a distinct con
tract with good effect, in the tender
ness and ruthlessness of "The Pau
per's Drive," by Sidney Homer. "The
Poat Song," Harriet Ware, was given
with much grace. Graham Feel's
"Ballad of Little Billee," the words by
Thackeray, made the audience shake
with laughter.
Bispham's encores, "The Pretty Cre
ature," "Hark, Hark, the Lark," and
"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes,"
iii which he displayed exceptional del

icacy of shading, were among the most
delightful numbers.
Harold Osborn Smith, who accom
panied Bispham, served very well. For
bis solo, he played Chopin's Polonaise
in A flat minor, and a Nocturne in B
flat major, as an encore, to the merited
enjoyment of the audience.
