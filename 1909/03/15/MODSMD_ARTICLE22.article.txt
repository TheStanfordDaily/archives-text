## "JUDAISM IN THE WORLD'S PROGRESS," IS THEME. Jewish Divine Delivers Strong Sermon Before Large Congregation in University Chapel. 
### 
A large congregation was present
jesterday morning to hear Rabbi Ber
nard Kaplan of San Francisco speak
in the Chapel on "Judaism in the
World's Progress." The rabbi proved
an able speaker and delivered a strong
sermon, which contained much of
value to his listeners.
The speaker devoted the greater
part of his sermon to a recital of the
various contributions of Judaism to
the world's philosophy, speaking of
the Jews' first expounding the mono
theistic belief and the philosophy of
Spinoza.
"The .Jews were the first cham
pions of liberty," said the rabbi. "All
the champions of freedom in the Ref
ormation based their claims on the
Old Testament, while those who stood
for the divine right of kings based
their claims on the New Testament.
The Golden Rule as propounded by
Jesus Christ was first taught by Con
fucius and by Rabbi Hillel, the teacher
of Gamaliel. Gamaliel was the teacher
of Christ and taught Him the great
mle, which in time will be the religion
of the world."
