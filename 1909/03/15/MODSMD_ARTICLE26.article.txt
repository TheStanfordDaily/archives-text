other members of the alumni.

magazines and some of the metropol
itan newspapers. The room is to be
open at all times to the faculty and
to all men students. It will also serve
aÂ« a headquarters for the secretary oi
the Y. M. C. A., the information and
employment bureaus.
H. C. Hoover, '95, started the fund
for the fitting up of the room by do
nating $200, which was followed by
gifts of $25 from J. IT. Winninger, M.
Cvummey, G. Crothers, C. E. Childs,
IT-r. R. L. Wilbur, D. A. Curry and Mrs.
G. A. Buffum, while smaller amounts
have swelled the total to $500.
