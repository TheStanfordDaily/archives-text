# STEVENSON PROGRAM IS GOOD

affair bids fair to be the most impor
tant of the nature held in some time.
The program for the evening is to be
all interesting one.
After a few opening remarks by
Professor L. E. Hassett, the presiding
officer, two songs, "The Land of Nod"
and"The Wind," will be rendered by
Miss R. A. Roberts, '09.

Celestial Surgeon" and "My Shadow"

A lecture entitled "Tusitala in Sa
moa" will then be given by Dr. Jor
dan. This lecture, which will be fully
illustrated by stereopticon views, will
deal with the intimate details of Stev
enson's life hitherto unknown. Dr.
Jordan had an unusually good chance
to become acquainted with the subject
by living for several years in Samoa,
next door to Stevenson, and knowing
the family personally.
The program will be closed by a
song. "Dark Brown Is the River," ren
dered by Mrs. Charles Read. '04.
