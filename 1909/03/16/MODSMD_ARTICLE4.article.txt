# MARATHON AT 3 O'CLOCK TOMORROW
## Interclass Race of Quadrangle Club Promises To Be Closely Contested.— Start Will Be Made Promptly at Specified Time. 
### 
Promptly at 3 o'clock tomorrow af
ternoon at the Stanford Oval, the
starter's pistol will inaugurate what
pi onuses to he one of the most unique
athletic events in the history of Stan
ford—the Interclass Marathon Relay
Pace, which is to be held under the
auspices of the Quadrangle Club. Five
classes will enter teams, which will
be composed of 20 men, each of whom
will run one-half mile, making a total
('L 130 men who will compete.
The greatest interest has been
evinced by the undergraduates in the
coming race, with the result that a
large number of athletes have tried foi
places on the team and close compe
tition has made possible the selection
of a fast lot of runners to represen
the classes tomorrow. The time made
by the contestants is exceptionally
good, considering the fact that, many
of those competing have never before
engaged in track work. A conserva
tive estimate of the time required to
run the 13 miles places it close to
58 minutes. The teams are so evenly
matched that it is impossible to pre
dict the outcome, and a hard light
should result between the represen
tatives of the several classes.
The men of the classes will sit to
gether in sections, the Seniors occu
pying the section of the bleachers
near the tape and the other classes
next to them in order of precedence.
An attractive souvenir program is be
ing prepared and will be distributed
among the spectators. A cup for the
winning team and medals for individ
uals have been offered by the Quad
rangle Club and will be awarded as
announced In a recent issue of The
Daily Palo Alto.
In addition to the list of officials
already published, Instructor L. W.
P.ahney will act. as inspector and A.
E. Roth, '09, and T. R. Cadwalader,
'09, will act as timers. The inspectors
will see that the rules are strictly en
forced and that no one is allowed on
the Held except runners and officials.
The captains are expected to be at
the training-house gate early enough
to arrange the order in which they
wish to run their men and to see that
no confusion results during the prog
ress of the race. All officials are re
quested to enter the track through the
training-house gate, where they will
receive badges and instructions. Both
participants and officials should be on
hand before 3 o'clock, so that there

will be no delay in starting the Mara
thon.
As has been announced, an admis
sion fee of 25 cents will be charged.

Promptly at 3 o'clock tomorrow af
ternoon at the Stanford Oval, the
starter's pistol will inaugurate what
pi onuses to he one of the most unique
athletic events in the history of Stan
ford—the Interclass Marathon Relay
Pace, which is to be held under the
auspices of the Quadrangle Club. Five
classes will enter teams, which will
be composed of 20 men, each of whom
will run one-half mile, making a total
('L 130 men who will compete.
The greatest interest has been
evinced by the undergraduates in the
coming race, with the result that a
large number of athletes have tried foi
places on the team and close compe
tition has made possible the selection
of a fast lot of runners to represen
the classes tomorrow. The time made
by the contestants is exceptionally
good, considering the fact that, many
of those competing have never before
engaged in track work. A conserva
tive estimate of the time required to
run the 13 miles places it close to
58 minutes. The teams are so evenly
matched that it is impossible to pre
dict the outcome, and a hard light
should result between the represen
tatives of the several classes.
The men of the classes will sit to
gether in sections, the Seniors occu
pying the section of the bleachers
near the tape and the other classes
next to them in order of precedence.
An attractive souvenir program is be
ing prepared and will be distributed
among the spectators. A cup for the
winning team and medals for individ
uals have been offered by the Quad
rangle Club and will be awarded as
announced In a recent issue of The
Daily Palo Alto.
In addition to the list of officials
