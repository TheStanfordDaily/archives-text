# PROM PLANS DISCUSSED
## COMING DANCE WILL BE UNUSUALLY ELABORATE AFFAIR. Report of Chairman Southard to Junior Class Discloses Small Ticket Sale to Date. 
### 
A special meeting of the Junior
class was held this afternoon to con
sider business pertaining to the Ju
r.ior Prom. Chairman W. W. South
ard submitted the report of the com
mittee having the function in charge,
and, following a number of enthusi
astic speeches from the floor, the class
determined to sanction the course of
the committee as outlined by the
chairman.
It appeared from the statement of
Southard that the Prom Committee
has not met with encouraging success
thus far in the sale of tickets for the
annual social function. Members of
the Junior class in particular have
failed to come to the support of the
committee to the extent that was ex
pected. This general apathetic atti
tude toward one of the really distinc
tive events of the college year has
been accounted for partly by the facf
that an unprecedented number of ath
letes are in strict training this spring.
Only seventy tickets had been sold up
to this noon. However, this relative
ly small sale, Southard expects, will
be somewhat increased in the ten re
maining days.
Despite the apparently poor support
being accorded the committee, elab
orate arrangements are being made
for the Prom, and the plans call for
the most pretentious affair of the kind
that has ever been held at Stanford.
Encina Club-room will be profusely
decorated, and a special scheme of il
lumination will be carried out for the
occasion. Brohaska's Orchestra has
contracted to furnish the musical
numbers. The catering will be done
by Wilson, the Palo Alto confectioner.
Chairman Southard, in speaking of
the Prom arrangements, said: "The
plans of our committee call for the
most elaborate dance that has ever
been held here. All details have been
decided and the present intentions of
the Prom Committee will be fulfilled
regardless of outside considerations.'"
