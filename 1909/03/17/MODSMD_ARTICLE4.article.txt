by the class of 1910, in the fast time
of 58:25.2 for the 13 miles. 1911 took
second place with the time of 58:55.4,
while 1909 was third, its time being

ii an accurate index of the interest
that has been manifested in the event.

sentatives of the 1908 class.

In the thirteenth lap 1908 took to a
bicycle as the only means of obtain
ing a lead, and C. N. Leach placed the
"hold-overs" ahead by four laps of
strenuous riding, leaving 1911 a poor
last. From this time on 1908 ran a
clown race, some men only covering
cne lap, and the real contest settled

the advantage held by 1910 never fell
below 40 yards, and, after the eigh

by the class of 1910, in the fast time
of 58:25.2 for the 13 miles. 1911 took
second place with the time of 58:55.4,
while 1909 was third, its time being
59:10.4. The average time made by
the runners of the winning team was
2:14.4, which is fast, considering the
fact that a majority of the men were
ncvices in track work.
C. B. Bradford, '09, won the medal
for the fastest time made by an in
dividual, running the course in 2:04.2.
H. H. Maundrell, '10, and J. P. Hemp

athletic events held at Stanford. The
attendance is estimated at 1200, which
ii an accurate index of the interest
that has been manifested in the event.
It has undoubtedly served its primary
purpose, namely, the stimulation of

"hold-overs" ahead by four laps of
strenuous riding, leaving 1911 a poor
last. From this time on 1908 ran a

The Interclass Marathon Relay Race
held this afternoon under the direc
tion of the Quadrangle Club was won
by the class of 1910, in the fast time
of 58:25.2 for the 13 miles. 1911 took
second place with the time of 58:55.4,
while 1909 was third, its time being
59:10.4. The average time made by
the runners of the winning team was
2:14.4, which is fast, considering the
fact that a majority of the men were
ncvices in track work.
C. B. Bradford, '09, won the medal
for the fastest time made by an in
dividual, running the course in 2:04.2.
H. H. Maundrell, '10, and J. P. Hemp
hill, '09, were the two fastest men
among the second class, which con
sisted of those who had not made their
"S" on track, the former running in
2:05, and the latter in 2:05.1. The
"Loob" prize for the slowest runner,
which consisted of a subscription to
the Chaparral for the remainder of the
semester, was annexed by D. H. Ferry,
'OS. The Quadrangle Club also offered
a silver cup to the winning team and
this will be awarded to the Junior
ciass.
The race was a success in every
particular, and proved to be one of
the most interesting and spectacular
athletic events held at Stanford. The
attendance is estimated at 1200, which
ii an accurate index of the interest
that has been manifested in the event.
It has undoubtedly served its primary
purpose, namely, the stimulation of
interest in track athletics, and many
men appeared who should prove good
material for this year's team.
A feature of the race was the gro
tesque costumes affected by the repre
sentatives of the 1908 class.
When the race was called, the men
lined up across the track for the first
relay were G. Wallace, OS, G. Costar,

start, then the pistol cracked and the
runners were off and the excitement
started. Carter took the lead and held
i: for the first la]). McFadden fought
hard at the finish, and the second
Freshman runner was sent away with
oily a slight lead, with the Junior
and Senior contestants following close
while 1908 and the Sophomore run
ner fell behind. The 1912 man was
given a six-yard lead in the third re
lay, with Adams, '09, second, while
Clark, '10, was several yards in the
rear.
Adams passed Arrell, '12, on the
fust lap, and finished 30 yards ahead,
while the Junior runner was a poor
third, with 1908 and 1911 holding the
same relative positions. Beman, '12,
lessened the Senior lead to 15 yards,
which Swickard maintained for 1909
during the fifth relay, though Meston,
MO, materially lessened the advantage
of 1912. In the sixth, Morrell in

place. Marchant put 1910 in second
place in the eighth and cut down the
distance between first and second to

The Freshmen took the lead in t.hp
tenth through the splendid running of
Dickinson, who finished 25 yards

enkranz, '10, third by a scant three
yards. Doron held this lead for a lap,
but was passed on second lap by Up
son, '10, and Abright, '09. Upson fin
ished first by 35 yards and gave the
Junior team a lead which was main
tained to the end of the race. Cook
increased this advantage to 90 in the
twelfth, with the Seniors 40 yards be
hind the Freshmen.
In the thirteenth lap 1908 took to a
bicycle as the only means of obtain
ing a lead, and C. N. Leach placed the
"hold-overs" ahead by four laps of
strenuous riding, leaving 1911 a poor
last. From this time on 1908 ran a
clown race, some men only covering
cne lap, and the real contest settled
down to a fight for second place, as
the advantage held by 1910 never fell
below 40 yards, and, after the eigh
teenth relay grew steadily great"''.
The Seniors maintained second pUee
until the eighteenth, when Newman
i ut the Freshmen ahead of 1909 by 30
yards. In the twenty-first relay, Por
