Vandals perpetrated an outrage las':
night, the inconceivable sniallness of
which passes our comprehension. The
posters placed in the windows of the
Quadrangle and tacked in several in
s'ances on bulletin boards, were either
stolen or mutilated beyond recognition
within thirty minutes after the tini. j
they were left by members of the
Junior Opera Committee last evening.
We would not have believed that this
community harbored any person or
persons who would be guilty of such
i n act. It can only be attributed to
a mind warped by the idea of revenge.
That the party guilty of the offense
was conversant with the plans of the
committee is evident. The â€¢ students
in placing the posters have reason to
believe that their every move was
watched last night, and immediately
their backs had been turned, the pos
ters were stolen from their places
and taken away. That the act was
not prompted by the mere desire to
obtain the posters, is shown by the
remains of posters, which were se
curely nailed to public bulletin boards.
lr every instance where the posters
were so iixed, the cards were slashed
and torn and destroyed completely.
This is the second case of a similar
nature which has been called to our
attention within the last few weeks.
The individual or individuals who
would do such a trick surely have no
place at Stanford, no matter what they
imagine may be their wrongs, and the
sooner they find this out, the better
r.lf the community will be.
