# VARSITY VS. OLYMPICS
## CLUBMEN TO MEET CARDINAL ATHLETES SATURDAY. California Eligible List Faulty. Names of Men Entering from Other Institutions Included. 
### 
The first campus meet of the Var
sity track team this season will be
held Saturday afternoon, when a team
of picked athletes, representing the
Olympic Club of San Francisco, will
try-out the Varsity material.
Considerable interest is being
e\iuced in the outcome of this meet,
a the visiting team will be composed
01 twenty-five men, including many ol'
the most noted track men on the
Coast, Glarner, Craig, Cheek, Rose and
Snedigar being among the list.
That all the events will be closely
contested is a foregone conclusion,
but the event which promises to be
the most exciting of the day will
be the half-mile, if both Glarner and
Miller enter that race. It is quite
possible that the rivalry between the
two will cause the Coast record to be
broken.
In the mile run it looks as if Craig
will have everything his own way, if
past performances count for anything.
He has covered the distance in less
than 4:.'>5 several times this year, and
his time of 4:32, recently made at an
indoor meet, shows hint to be in the
best of condition.
Included in the list of possible en
tiies for the Olympic Club are the
names of several old Stanford men,
among whom are F. R. Lanagan, ex
'oB, and D. Martin, ex-'OB.
The chances of a Varsity victory
aie lessened by the inability of sev
eral men to compete, owing to illness.
The team will be weakened in the
pele vault, as L. Scott, '10, is not yet
recovered from the injury to his an
kle received in Los Angeles. Another
name was added to the already long
list of disabled track men today, when
A. Crary, '11, was taken to the Guild
Hospital, suffering from appendicitis.
In regard to the Freshman eligible
list submitted by the University of
California, Captain Horton said today
that it has evidently been their custom
to send the names of men who have
attended other colleges, but who are
just entering the University of Cali
fornia. The name of a graduate of St.
Ignatius College was found in this
year's list. To help in discovering
any more of these names, it is sug
gested to members of the Student
Body that they inspect the list of eli
gibles published in the Daily Palo
Alto of March 10, and report to Cap
tain Horton the name of any one
whom they know has attended a col
li ge elsewhere, as such men are not
eligible for the Freshman meet.
