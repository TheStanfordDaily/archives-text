# STEVENSON HONORED
## NOTED WHITER IS SUBJECT OF ENGLISH CLUB PROGRAM. Dr. Jordan Relates Personal Experiences Upon Island Made Famous by Author. 
### 
Under the auspices ol" the English
Club, an interesting and Instructive
program was given last evening in
the Assembly Hall. Taking the au
thor, R. L. Stevenson, as a topic, the
entire evening was devoted to the
study of his work.
Professor L. E. Bassett of the Eng
lish department, representing the Eng
lish Club, delivered an introductory
address upon the success of the fa
mous writer, and introduced those
who took part in the program. Miss
P. Roberts, '0.9, rendered two vocal
selections, the words of which were
the product of the pen of Stevenson.
These were "The Land of Nod" and
"The Wind."
Several poems by Stevenson were
interpreted in dramatic readings by
Miss A. Ellerbeck, '09, among them
being "Even Song," "The Vagabond,"
"The Celestial Surgeon," and some
children's verses.
"Tusitala in Samoa" was the title
given by Dr. Jordan to the lecture de
livered by himself as the main num
ber of the evening. Based upon a
personal visit to the South Sea Isl
ands, in which Stevenson spent many
years in search of health, the lecturer
<(<alt in an exhaustive way with the
topography of the islands, the people
with whom Stevenson had lived, their
customs, mode of life and especially
their relations with the well-known
writer. International relations occu
pied a part in the talk, while much
stress was laid upon the description
and the traditions of the celebrated
"Valema," the home of Stevenson
while on the island upon which he
lived during his sojourn in the South
Seas.
The narration of facts of the life
ol! Stevenson that have not hitherto
been known was made more interest
ing by the excellent collection of ster
eopticon views that were shown in
the course of the lecture as the re
sult of the efforts of Mrs. Jordan
while in the island with her husband.
