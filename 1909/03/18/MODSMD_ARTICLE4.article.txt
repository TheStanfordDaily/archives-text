# Pemberton Will Act as Referee.
## 
### 
J. R. Pemberton, '08, has consented
to act as referee of the boxing con
tests to be held in Encina Gymnasium
during the first week in April.
Attention is called to the 145-pound
special class, which has been arrang
ed in order to accommodate the large
number of students not eligible to
enter one of the other classes. This
tournament is not confined to the
membership of the various gymnasium
classes, but is open to all students of
the University. All those desiring to
enter should hand their names to In
structor Maloney in Encina Gymnasi
um as early as possible, in order that
h< may arrange for the drawings.
