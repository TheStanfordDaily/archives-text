The Varsity track team and a team
representing the Olympic Club of San
Francisco will tomorrow engage in a
dual meet, which, with the exception
of the intercollegiate, will be the most
important track meet of the season.
The team which the San Francis
co club will send down consists of
an aggregation of stars whose worth
is known to every follower of track
athletics. These men will cause the
Varsity team to exert every effort to
secure a victory, and a closely con
tested meet is expected, as with the
privilege of bringing down twenty-five
athletes, the clubmen will have plenty
of second and third-place men to help
roll up the score.
With such point-winners as Ralph
Rose, Snedigar, Glarner and Cheek

made and the Varsity men will have
an opportunity to extend themselves.

ance at the meet and will furnish the
