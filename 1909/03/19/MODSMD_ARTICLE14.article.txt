For a class which entered the Uni
versity greater in numbers than any
which preceded it, and larger than
any which has followed, and one which
at this time enrolls as many under
graduates as the average graduating
division of the Student Body, the
showing made at an important meet
ing of the Senior class held yesterday
can only be attributed to one thing—
lack of class spirit.
By count, not more than a dozen
men and half this number of women
were present yesterday at a gathering
publicly announced and generally un
derstood as a session at which impor
tant affairs of the class would he dis
cussed. The occurrence is inexcus
able.
Even if the members of 1909 are
of one mind on many subjects—which
we doubt —and are ready to allow a
few to do all the legislating, it is
not justice to the University or the
individuals concerned to take the
present apathetic attitude. It is the
duty of the men and women who have
attended this institution for seven
semesters to remain united by the
common bond of class spirit. If be
fore college is left the disintegration
o" the class is to begin, what will be
the effect when all common ties are
sundered? We need not go into de
tail to point out the evil effect it will
h;ive on the University.
Senior singing has been practical
ly adopted by the class as represented
by eighteen or twenty; and this, we
believe, offers an excellent opportu
nity for the men to become better
acquainted before leaving. The wo
men may chose a similar plan with
advantage. The main point at issue
that, enthusiasm is needed where
now exists indifference. 1909 must
get together.
