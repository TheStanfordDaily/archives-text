number of the men who had placed
their names upon the list as trying
out for places upon the intercollegi
ate debating teams have withdrawn,
the preliminary tryouts have been
abandoned. With the original number
amounting to over twenty persons, a
preliminary series of debates had been
scheduled, and the places assigned to
ti«e various contestants. Those suc
cessful in this group of speeches were
to debate in a tinal tryout, which was
t'i be held in the Chapel on Wednes
day evening, March 24, at 7 o'clock.
This second series will still be given,
but in the nature of a single tryout
fir the selection of the men to repre
sent Stanford next April.

by the committee that any who find
