# JACOB RIIS LECTURES
## NOTED REFORMER SPEAKS IN ASSEMBLY HALL. "The Battle with the Slums" Subject of Address Under Auspices of Social Service Club. 
### 
Jacob A. Riis, the noted reformer of
New York, spoke last evening in As
sembly Hall, under the auspices of
the Social Service Club, on "The Hat
tie with the Slums." Dr. Jordan in
troduced the speaker with a few re
marks on the great work which he has
accomplished.
Mr. Riis first spoke of the nature
of the work among the slums and
the conditions which are encountered
in working among the crowded tene
ments. He told of his work as a news
paper reporter detailed on police cases
which took him into the slums.
The fight for the uplifting of the
slums was begun about twenty years
ago. The speaker told how he first
became acquainted with Theodore
Roosevelt, who was and is the most
fearless slum worker of all who have
undertaken that kind of social service
work.
After his introductory remarks, the
speaker showed a large number of
lantern slides, illustrating conditions
in the slums as they existed before
ti:e crusade of cleanliness, and as
(bey look today, after many of the old
rookeries have been removed, and
new buildings, parks and playgrounds
substituted for them.
Mr. Riis said in part: "The wealth
of our nation does not consist in
mines, harvests, oil fields and manu
factures, but in the boys and girls or
today. The slums make for unright
eousness and the corruption of our
youth. The fight against the slums
concerns the life of the nation. The
reason for the slums is the excessive
rents charged by the greedy tene
ment. owners. A census, made after
the law regulating the building of
tenement houses was passed, showed
Hat 361,000 dark rooms, which re
ceived no light from the outside, ex
isted in the rookeries of New York
City. These rooms harbored the boys
and girls who were to grow up to be
the backbone of the nation. Under
such conditions, the safeguard of the
country, the home, cannot exist. The
fight with the slums is for all the re
public in which all the people are con
cerned."
The lecture was very well attended,
several hundred people being present.
The proceeds of the lecture were de
voted to the athletic fund of the Palo
Alto schools.
Mr. Riis was entertained at an in
formal dinner in the Inn by Professor
IT F. Hlichfeldt, associate professor in
the Mathematics department.
