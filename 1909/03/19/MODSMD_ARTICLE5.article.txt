# TO PLAY SANTA CLARA
## VARSITY MEETS COLLEGIANS OFF CAMPUS TOMORROW. Batting Averages Are Compiled and Remaining Games of Schedule Announced. 
### 
What will probably be the last game
to be played with the Santa Clara nine
this season will take place 011 the col
lege grounds tomorrow afternoon at
2:30. The members of the local team,
accompanied by Coach Presley, will
leave Palo Alto at 12:40.
Of the four contests that have been
settled thus far between the two teams
two have been won by each aggrega
tion. Tomorrow's game will therefore
dccide the season's series, and, unless
a special game is arranged with the
collegians later 011 in the spring, they
will not again try conclusions with
the Varsity.
Theile and Canterbury will act as
tiie Stanford battery, while Friene and
Shafer will probably act in a similar
capacity for Santa Clara. Theile has
only appeared in one previous game,
his injured arm compelling him to
retire in favor of Smith after three
innings. His arm is now in fairly good
condition and his showing against
Santa Clara will be watched with a
great deal of interest. Canterbury
also returns to the line-up after an
extended absence on account of dis
abled fingers.
The Varsity has thus far partici
pated ir twelve games, winning five
and losing seven. Most of these con
tests resulted in close scores, and the
proportion of games won is almost
exactly the same as at a similar time
a year ago.
With the first intercollegiate game
just two weeks away, the Varsity
players are hitting the ball in satis
factory style, though the averages of
the leaders are somewhat below those
of last year. The team batting aver
age, however, which is .199, exceeds
last year's record taken at about this
stage of the season.
The averages of the memberse of
the Varsity squad follow:
A.B H. Avg.
McGregor 14 4 .286
Scofield 20 5 .250
