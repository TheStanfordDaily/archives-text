# DECISIVE GAME TOMORROW.
## California and Stanford Women to Settle Intercollegiate Supremacy on Mills College Courts. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock the
deciding game of the series will lie
played at Mills College between the
Stanford and California basketball
teams. The first game was won by
California by the score 18-7, and the
second was won by Stanford by the
score 15-7, so there is much interest
concerning the outcome of the game
tomorrow.
If the weather is good, there is ev
ery indication that the Stanford team
\\ill be the victor, but if it rains, their
superior weight will give the victory
to California in all probability. The
Stanford team has a better general
knowledge of the game, uses the short
pass and excellent team work. It re
lies upon quickness and accurate
playing. The California team uses the
long pass and depends more upon star
playing. The line-up will not be
known until tomorrow.
