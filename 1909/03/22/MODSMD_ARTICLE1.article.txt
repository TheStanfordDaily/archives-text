# WILL MEET WHITE SOX
## FAMOUS CHICAGO AGGREGATION APPEARS HERE TOMORROW. Some of America's Diamond Stars to Be Seen in Action on Local Grounds—Smith to Pitch. 
### 
Local baseball enthusiasts will be
privileged to see one of America's most
famous ball teams in action tomorrow
afternoon, when the Varsity is sched
uled to cross bats with the Chicago
W'hite Sox. Three o'clock has been sef
for the opening of the contest, which
will be played on the Varsity diamond.
The admission price will be 50 cents.
The White Sox have played a num
ber of practice games with California
nines during the past few weeks, and
their record is too well known to re
quire a detail account here. The pitch
ing staff contains some of the most
notable box artists in professional
baseball, among them being Altrock
and White, who played an important
part in the world's championship se
ries two years ago. Among the men
that will be tried out by the Chicago
management tomorrow are Zeider.
Beall, Purtell, Flanagan and Welday.
Flanagan was once the star player of
the Northwest League, while Beall and
Welday have good reputations as hit
ters. Welday has been getting two or
three hits in every game played. Pur
tell captains the easterners, and Zei
der will be remembered as the crack
shortstop of last year's San Francisco
nine.
Coach Presley will send Smith in to
do the twirling for the Varsity, and
Canterbury will do the receiving.
While the exact personnel of the two
teams has not been divulged, the prob
able line-ups are:
White Sox —Pitcher, Altrock, White,
Olmstead, Spencer, Lange, Manuel;
catcher, Shaw, Payne; first base,
Beall; second base, Davis; third base,
Purtell; shortstop, Zeider; left field,
Welday; center field, Flanagan; right
field, Dalton.
Stanford —Pitcher, Smith; catcher,
Canterbury; first base, Bell; second
base, Cadwalader; third base, Mitch
ell; shortstop, Sampson; outfielders,
Tallant, Scofield, Ganong, Ball, Mc-
Gregor.
Santa Clara Wins Rasebail Series.
Despite the fact, that the Varsity
made more hits and fewer errors than
the opposing players in the deciding
game with Santa Clara College last
Saturday afternoon, the latter won
the victory, and with it the series,
by the score of 4-0. Theile pitched
the full nine innings, and, though he
had a great variety of curves, coupled
with plenty of speed, the veteran
pitcher was unable to control the ball.
He issued seven walks. The loss of
the game is charegable to this un
steadiness and wildness. Friene, on
the other hand, was effective at crit
ical moments and extricated himself
from several tight holes.
Several fast plays relieved the mo
notony. Scofield, playing in center
field, made a sensational catch of a
hard drive by Peters in the fourth
inning. Santa Clara pulled off two
fast double plays, oue in the third
and again in the fourth. With no
outs, Stanford had Theile, Cadwala
der and Tallant on the bases in the
third, when Sampson flied out to Doo

ling, who tfirew to Peters in time to
catch Tallant at first base. Bell's
long fly to left was bagged by Walter
stein, thus ending Stanford's most fa
vorable opportunity of scoring. Santa
Clara scored one tally in its half of
the first, third, fourth and fifth in
nings.
