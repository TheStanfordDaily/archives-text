# CHANGES IN JUNIOR OPERA CAST
## Crew Work Causes Withdrawal of K. Chamberlain, '11, and H. Seward. '12, from Cast. 
### 
Owing to crew work, H. Seward,
'12, who lias been playing the part
ol "The man who could not go home,"
in the Junior Opera, and K. Chamber
lain, '11, who was playing the part
of the "Negro," in the same produc
tion, have been forced to give up
their roles.
W. B. Cohen, '12, who has had the
part of "The First Soldier over the
Wall," will take Seward's place. He
will be remembered for his work as
the "Butler" in "His Excellency the
Governor."
Chamberlain's part will be taken
by G. F. Morgan, '10, who has had
considerable experience in minstrel
shows as a negro impersonator. R. H.
Brown, '10, will take the part of the
"Soldier" which Cohen left vacant.
The committee considers itself fortu
nate in securing substitutes who are
so exceptionally qualified to till the
places left vacant.
An all-day rehearsal was held Sat
urday, and under the direction of Cae
sar Brandt, who was down for the
day, the whole show was put together
for the first time. Brandt was very
optimistic about, the performance, as
the cast is rapidly getting into the
spirit and atmosphere of the play.
A rehearsal of the cast will be held
tonight. The remainder of the week
will be spent in the finishing touches
and in getting used to the stage
properties.
