In the best track meet of the sea
eon, Stanford defeated the Olympic
Club track team on Saturday by a
score of 69 1-3 to 52 2-3.

sible fourteen first places, the club
men were too weak in second and
third men to secure a victory.
The best race of the day was run
by J. O. Miller in the half-mile. The
veteran middle-distance man was in
excellent condition, and, despite the
cold day made a phenomenal show
ing, for this time of the year, by break
ing the Coast record of 1:58.3, held by
Glarner of the Olympic Club, by 1-5
of a second.
The quarter-mile was hotly contest
ed between Glarner and Wyman. The
former, holding back until the curve
into the stretch was reached, when he
sprinted and by a of speed closed
the gap of 15 yards that separated
them, beating Wyman to the tape in
51.3.
The two-mile was run in the fast
time of 10.8. Newman, '12, set the
pace for the first few laps, but was
compelled to relinquish his lead to
Garvin of the Olympics, who held it
io the finish, although closely pressed
in the sprint by Worthington.
Rose showed his usual form in the
weight events, easily winning both.
The discus throw was an added event
for the benefit of the Olympic Club
competitors and its results did not
count in the meet.
