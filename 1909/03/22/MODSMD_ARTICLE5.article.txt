# WINS INTERCOLLEGIATE SERIES.
## Basketball Team of Stanford Triumphs for First Time in History of Contests. 
### 
Saturday the Stanford basketball
team defeated the University of Cali
fornia by the score 15-12. This is the
first time in the history of the Uni
versity that the women have won a
series from California. Two or three
times the score has been left witli
one game in favor of each University,
but never before has Stanford won
the series.
This game was played at Mills Col
lege and was well attended by rep
resentatives from Stanford. About 150
Berkeley women attended.
The game was exciting and closely
fought from start to finish. In the
first half Stanford scored 5 points
before California made any score, but
at the end of the half the score stood
7.-5 in favor of Stanford. During the
second half the score wavered back
and forth, point by point, and a few
seconds before time was called the
score Avas 12-11 in favor of California.
In the face of almost sure defeat, the
Stanford team rallied and 4 more
po>'nts were made before the end of
the half.
Many points were made on fouls,
winch were caused by the slippery
court, but the game was particularly
clean and well-played. There was
very little fumbling, and the playing
on both sides was accurate and sure.
The game was one of the most spec
tacular and sportsmanlike games that
have ever been played on this Coast.
The Stanford team used their suc
cessful team work and the short pass.
The California team played a far
better game than last week. Well
worked-up team work was used, par
ticularly by the forwards. Had it not
been for the excellent work of the
Stanford guards, the California score
would have been undoubtedly much
higher. The game was characterized
by a splendid spirit between the two
teams, and only the best feeling was
prevalent.
