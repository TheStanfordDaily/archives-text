' The Liars," by Henry Arthur Jones,
has been selected by the Senior Farce
Committee as the play to be present
ed during the festivities of Senior
Week. The play is a comedy drama,
in four acts. A greater part of it was
originally written by Oscar Wilde;
however, the work of retouching and
finishing fell to Henry Arthur Jones,
who published it under his name.
Other well-known plays by this au
thor are: "The Masqueraders," "The
Manoeuvers of Jane," "Mrs. Dare's
Defense," and"The Tempter."
The plot centers around English
society life of today. The action con
sists in the events of three or four
days. There are ten male and six
female parts. The play was first
produced in London, where it ran with
great success for over a year, and the
next year was reproduced in New
York, with Henry Miller in the leading
role. This second production ran for
another year with as great success as
it had achieved in England.
The committee in charge has as
sured the success of the play by se
curing the services of F. Mathieu as
coach. The cast has been partially se
lected. and is not limited to Seniors,
though the leads will be taken by
members of the 1909 class. A public
tiyout is not being conducted. The
committee is sending invitations to
those that it desires to have compete.
The selections for Hie parts are being
made by the Senior Farce Committee
and Mathieu. The cast will be pub
lished as soon as completed, probably
some time next week. Rehearsals
will commence Friday morning.
