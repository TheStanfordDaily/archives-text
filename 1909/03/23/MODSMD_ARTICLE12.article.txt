We have been asked to call the at
tention of the men of the University
to the boxing exhibition which is to
be given by the classes of Encina
Gymnasium, under the direction of In
structor Maloney. We believe that
the "manly art" should be cultivated
and the movement given the support
it deserves.
Boxing is a clean, beneficial sport,
and is entitled to the same considera
tion as tennis, handball and other
sports of this general type.
We note with pleasure that the
amended bill which practically ex
empts graduates of the Stanford Law
School from taking the bar examina
tions of this State, has been passed
by both divisons of the Legislature and
is now ready for the signature of the
Governor. As the objections offered
by Governor Gillett to the former bill
have been removed, his approval is
row expected. The law will do much
to improve Ihe standing of the local
Law School, and the members of the
faculty who have aided in placing the
bill before the Legislature deserve
much credit for their efforts.
