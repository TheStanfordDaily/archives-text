Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: If I have not been too
Iroublesome already, may I use your
paper to (ell the neighbors that. I am
today sending to the Grenfell Asso
ciation of New England the sum of
? 153.50 as a Stanford contribution to
Dr. Grenfell's work. The money will
probably go to the upkeep of a bed
in St. Anthony's hospital. To endow
a warm bed seems much more prac
tical than to save one's money for a
cold tombstone. Alas! less than six
male students of the University have
helped this good cause, a sharp con
trast to the spirit of Harvard and
Yale. D. Charles Gardner.
