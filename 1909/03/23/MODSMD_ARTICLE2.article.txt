# Debaters to Hold Tryouts.
## 
### 
Two debating teams will be selected
tomorrow evening in the Chapel, to
represent Stanford both in the annual
contest, with the University of Cali
fornia and in debates with other col
leges that are now anticipated. This
choice will be made from a field of
twenty candidates who are trying out
and who have been divided into squads
and sides. Each of the four divisions
will lake the intercollegiate question
as the topic for their discussions, and
will debate this in separate debates.
As originally planned by the Inter
society Debating League, a prelimin
ary tryout was to lie held, excluding
those who have been successful in the
pÂ£.st in securing places upon varsity
debating teams. Hut on account of
the number who were unable to con
tinue in the tryouts, it was decided to
make the contest one event.
.1. E. Shelton, '10, as a member of
the Intersociety Debating League,
which has the tryouts in charge, will
preside during the evening. The hour
oT the tryouts has been set for seven
o'clock.
