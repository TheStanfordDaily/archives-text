Threatening weather did not damp
er. the ardor of local baseball fol
lowers, and a considerable crowd saw
the Chicago White Sox take the Var
sity into camp this afternoon by the
score of 0 to 1. The game was played
in exceptionally fast time, just one
hour and eleven minutes elapsing from
the time that Welday stepped to the
bat in the first inning to Sampson's
fly-out in the last half of the ninth.
The big leaguers scored their first
run in the first period and were never
headed by the Varsity.
Twelve hits were gathered off
Smith's delivery, but snappy and
somewhat brilliant fielding on the part
of the Cardinal players held the score
down. Features were noticeably alt
sent. Captain Sampson's work at.
shortstop was of the brilliant variety,
while Tallant played in his usually re
liable style in left field. Only one er
ror was credited to each side, Smith
and Davis being responsible for these.
I .el I and Ganong secured the only two
hits that were garnered from Olni
stead's offerings. The diamond was
exceedingly slow.
Sampson was responsible for the
lone Cardinal tally. The Stanford
captain stepped to bat after two of his
teem mates had filed out in quick suc
cession. He reached the initial sack
on Davis' fumble of his fast grounder,
advanced to second on Bell's safety
| and sped home on Ganong's swift.
| drive to deep center, which was han
dled in slow shape by Flanagan.
Everything considered, the Varsity
1 made a most creditable showing
against the visitors, the fielding being
particularly good.
