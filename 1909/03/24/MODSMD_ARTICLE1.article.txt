# TOPIC CHOSEN TIMELY
## PROFESSOR W.F. CHENEY TALKS ON "RELIGION AND MEDICINE" "Emmanuel Movement" Among Others Discussed This Morning.—Assembly Hall Is Well Filled. 
### 
Professor W. F. Cheney of the re
cently affiliated Cooper Medical Col
lege addressed the students of the
University in Assembly this morning
at 10:15. The hall was well filled,
and the subject of Professor Cheney's
talk was of unusual timeliness and
interest. He spoke on "Religion and
Medicine," the two great, and neces
sary workers for human nature in the
world.
The speaker in introduction to his
address told how this generation has
seen the springing up of numerous new
creeds and faiths, established to coun
teract the well-known materialism of
the medicine profession. Also, to
what extent, people have hungered for
something out of the old rut of mat
ter-of-fact medicine, and where proof
of this is found in the vast recruiting
of the ranks of the Christian Scient
ists, Dr. Worcester's "Emmanuel
Movement," and others.
"And good there must certainly be
in Mrs. Eddy's teachings," said Pro
fessor Cheney, "since countless thous
ands are yearly taking up the Scientist
belief, with no compulsion or revival
meetings on the part of the Eddy
forces. "Christian Science makes re
ligion the basis of its cures. Christ
Himself was known as the 'Great Phy
sician,' as well as the 'Great Teacher.'
"What is the matter with medicine
and the church? That is the great
question that is agitating the mod
ern world of thinkers. The answer to
it is that 'soul and body are so inti
mately combined that one suffers si
multaneously with the other. It is the
fault of both the doctor and the priest
that a man should be diseased, wheth
er in mind or body. Medicine and
tne church have heretofore not co
operated to alleviate the sufferings of
the world. It is time for medicine to
fall into line and adopt any and every
possible means to lessen the ills of
humanity, whether these means on
the surface seem foolish or not."
Professor Cheney discussed Dr.
Worcester's "Emmanuel Movement"
at some length. He said that Dr.
Worcester thought that drugs, elictric
ity, sunlight, etc., have their value in
certain cases, such as organic trou
bles, but that, in certain other cases
they were absolutely useless. In ner
vous diseases suggestion must be em
ployed for cures. Medicine here could
be of no use. Likewise in organic
troubles, Dr. Worcester has said that
not one cure lias been effected by
nerely moral influences. Psychology
lies at, the bottom of all the work done
by the followers of the "Emmanuel
Movement."
In conclusion, Dr. Cheney said that
"medicine and religion can do this
work," of helping mankind in sick
ness, "hand in hand. They are not
enemies. Doctors in the future must
make use, not only of material • reme
dies, but of spiritual as well."
Dr. Jordan also introduced to the
Assembly Professor Cote, assistant
professor of History in the Univer
sity of Christiania, Norway, a well
known European scholar, now visiting
America.
