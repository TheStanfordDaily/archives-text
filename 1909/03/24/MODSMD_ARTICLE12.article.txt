Meetings have been scheduled for
upperclass men students of all the de
partments of the University for to
morrow afternoon. These gatherings
are important. The success or failure
or the plan of control, as outlined in
the constitution of the University Con
ference and recently adopted by the
Student Body, will hang largely in
the balance as a result of the amount
of interest evidenced tomorrow. To
give the scheme a fair opportunity, the
original representatives must be care
fully chosen, and should be men who
are earnest and competent to hold the
trust which will be turned over to
them.
The men of the various departments
should take care to note where their
respective meetings are to be held
and lie present, in order to make the
best and most representative choice.
The plan, we believe, offers posibil
ities which should not be neglected or
overlooked, and it is to the interests
of all the men of the Student Hoelv to
see it creditably inaugurated.
