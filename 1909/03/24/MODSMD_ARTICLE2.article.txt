# "IN TANGIERS" TOMORROW NIGHT
## Production of Clever Opera in Assembly Hall Will Open the Festivities of Junior Week for the Class of 1910. 
### 
Junior week festivities for the class
of 1910 will be inaugurated tomorrow
evening in Assembly Hall, when the
curtain will rise on "In Tangiers,"
the Junior Opera for this year.
Everything is in readiness for the
performance. The costumes arrived
today, and the dress rehearsals will
be held tonight and all day tomorrow.
Caesar Brandt will bring down a pro
fessional orchestra for the rehearsal
tomorrow.
The cast, which includes many of
Stanford's best actors, are ready, un
der the able coaching of Wilkinson
and Kelly, to do justice to what prom
ises to be as clever an opera as has
ever been produced on the Stanford
stage.
Miss M. L. Ozier, '11, as Gayety
Vance, the girl who majored in queen
ii g, is said to be exceptionally pleas
ing. This is her first appearance here,
but her voice and clever acting amply
assures her success.
C. H. Bradford, '09, of minstrel ex
perience, as Tommy Taylor, a college
man by proxy, makes an ideal light
comedian. He is alse> something of a
quick-change artist, for in the first
act, arrayed in a Mother Hubbard, he
poses as a, tamer of wild beasts, lions
a specialty, and in the second act,
dressed in a Scottish costume, he
makes a creditable Scottish chief.
Miss M. T. Howell, '10, who has tak
en part in productions here in differ
ent roles, has an altogether new part.
She is a winsome French lady, who
is not at all above flirting, and rather
enjoys being mixed up in Tangerian
politics.
Aunt Pussi, as played by Miss M.
Wilson, '11, is expected to be a hit.
T. A. De Bolt, '10, as Captain De
roux of the foreign legation, has a
part which offers splendid opportuni
ties and which he makes the most of.
The Man Who Could Not Go Home,
the part which H. Seward, '12, was
forced to give up, has fallen into good
hands. W. B. Cohen, '12, a man who
has had considerable experience, gives
in this character the only touch of
seriousness in the whole play.
Abdul iz Afterit, the Bey of Tan
giers, as played by P. F. Pettigrew,
'10, represents a man who is qualified

to do many things, and whose great
est fault is his love for mineral drinks.
The rest of the parts are well cast,
and as far as the chorus is concerned,
nothing more could be desired.
The cast follows:

Junior week festivities for the class
of 1910 will be inaugurated tomorrow
evening in Assembly Hall, when the
curtain will rise on "In Tangiers,"
the Junior Opera for this year.
Everything is in readiness for the
performance. The costumes arrived
today, and the dress rehearsals will
be held tonight and all day tomorrow.
Caesar Brandt will bring down a pro
fessional orchestra for the rehearsal
tomorrow.
The cast, which includes many of
Stanford's best actors, are ready, un
der the able coaching of Wilkinson
and Kelly, to do justice to what prom
ises to be as clever an opera as has
ever been produced on the Stanford
stage.
Miss M. L. Ozier, '11, as Gayety
Vance, the girl who majored in queen
ii g, is said to be exceptionally pleas
ing. This is her first appearance here,
but her voice and clever acting amply
assures her success.
C. H. Bradford, '09, of minstrel ex
perience, as Tommy Taylor, a college
man by proxy, makes an ideal light
comedian. He is alse> something of a
quick-change artist, for in the first
act, arrayed in a Mother Hubbard, he
poses as a, tamer of wild beasts, lions
a specialty, and in the second act,
dressed in a Scottish costume, he
makes a creditable Scottish chief.
Miss M. T. Howell, '10, who has tak
en part in productions here in differ
ent roles, has an altogether new part.
She is a winsome French lady, who
is not at all above flirting, and rather
enjoys being mixed up in Tangerian
politics.
Aunt Pussi, as played by Miss M.
Wilson, '11, is expected to be a hit.
T. A. De Bolt, '10, as Captain De
roux of the foreign legation, has a
part which offers splendid opportuni
ties and which he makes the most of.
The Man Who Could Not Go Home,
the part which H. Seward, '12, was
forced to give up, has fallen into good
hands. W. B. Cohen, '12, a man who
has had considerable experience, gives
in this character the only touch of
seriousness in the whole play.
Abdul iz Afterit, the Bey of Tan
giers, as played by P. F. Pettigrew,
'10, represents a man who is qualified

to do many things, and whose great
est fault is his love for mineral drinks.
The rest of the parts are well cast,
and as far as the chorus is concerned,
nothing more could be desired.
The cast follows:
Tommy Taylor, a college man by
