Dr. Gardner announces that the
next meeting of the Social Service
Club will be held in the Chapel on
Monday evening, April 5, at 7:30.
Colonel C. Miles, the head of the
Salvation Army on the Pacific Coast,
will give a lecture on "Practical Phil
anthropy," which will be illustrated
by a remarkable set of three hundred
stereopticon views. Colonel Miles
has worked among the dependent and
degenerate classes in New York, Lon
don, Cape Town, Johannesburg, St.
Louis, Chicago and other large cities
with wonderful results. The rescue
work of the Army, the shelters, colo
nies and orphanages will be illustrat
ed, and the colonel will tell of his
personal experiences in social service
work and of the methods used in the
fight for the uplifting of the down
trodden classes.
The meeting will be an open one
and all are invited to attend.
