# TO PLAY SOUTHERNERS
## VARSITY WILL OPPOSE ST. VINCENT'S NINE TOMORROW. Game Will Be the Deciding One of Series, if Weather Permits Playing. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock
the Varsity will meet the St. Vincent's
College nine, on the Varsity diamond,
weather permitting. The field is soggy
from the recent rains, but, in case
there is no rain tomorrow, the match
will be played. Otherwise the game
will have to be indefinitely postponed,
since the Los Angeles team has its
northern schedule filled.

nature of a deciding ope, since both
teams have won a game, in the series
played recently at Los Angeles on
Stanford's southern trip.
