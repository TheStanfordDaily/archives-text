Instructor Maloney of Encina Gym
nasium in all the gymnasium classes
today explained the rules and regula
tions of the coming boxing and fenc
ing competitions. He requested all
men who have had any boxing what
ever to enter this contest, and em
phasized the fact that both competi
tions are open to all men of the Uni
versity and not necessarily to those
interested in gymnasium work. To
cover certain expenses, an entrance
lee of fifty cents will be charged.
