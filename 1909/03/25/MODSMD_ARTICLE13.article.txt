Members of the class of 1910 will
celebrate tonight, tomorrow and Sat
urday the most important epoch thus
far passed over in their career at this
University, and we wish to offer them
all success in observing Junior Week.
In making ready for the festivities,
many obstacles have been encountered
and overcome by the various commit
tees, and we believe that in the Opera,
Aquatic Sports and Prom the members
of the present Junior class will estab
lish a record for excellence which
will be in keeping with performances
and exercises of past classes.
