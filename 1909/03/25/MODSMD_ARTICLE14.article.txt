# Issue Book of "Fish Stories."
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan, collaborating with Chas,
F. Holder, the eminent author and
sportsman, has recently written a very,
interesting collection of "Fish Sto
nes." The book was published in
February by Henry Holt & Co., and
contains many instructive and amus
ing accounts of some of the varied
?nd unusual exploits of the two au
thors. In the preface to the volume.
Dr. Jordan sets forth no claims as to
the entire veracity of the stories, but
reminds the reader of the universal
agreement that "It is better to lie
about your great catch of trout than
to make it." The incidents which are
related have in them a good propor
tion of wholesome humor, and at the
same time give many instructive ami
important facts concerning the den
izens of the deep. Forty narratives
are included in the book, and these
are well illustrated by twenty-eight
full-paged illustrations. Both of the
v.lit ers are Californians and are
thought to be probably the most prom
inent amateur and professional ich
thyologists in the country. As would
l>e supposed, many of the stories
pertain to fish found within the wa
ters along the Pacific Coast.
