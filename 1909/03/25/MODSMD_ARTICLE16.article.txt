# SHELL ARRIVES AT BOATHOUSE.
## Varsity and Freshman Eights Will Practice and Row Against One Another from Now On. 
### 
The freighter Nonpariel arrived at
Redwood City from Oakland yester
day afternoon with the new eight
oared shell on board. The crew men
were taken out in a launch to the dock
and towed the shell hack to the boat
house.
Coach Dan Murphy went lip to Red
wood City this morning and will put
on the outriggers himself. He ex
pects to have I lie new shell out on the
water by tomorrow, and everything
will be in readiness for the Varsity
men to give the boat its first tryout.
From now on a great deal of compe
tition will be indulged in between
crews of the two eight-oared shells,
pnd some spirited races should result.
