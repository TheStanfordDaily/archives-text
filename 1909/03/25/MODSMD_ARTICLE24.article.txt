# Will Fight Invasion of Rugby.
## 
### 
The American Football Association,
organized to counteract the invasion
of Rugby, is carrying on an extensive
campaign to keep Rugby* out of the
California secondary schools.
"Bill" Reid, the great Harvard
coach, is leading the association
forces. Many high schools will play
Rugby next fall, and many will try
both games.
