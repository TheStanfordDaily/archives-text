# Y.W.C.A. CONFERENCE
## YOUNG WOMEN WILL HOLD CONVENTION AT CAPITOLA. Large Delegations to Go from Stanford and California.—Prominent Leaders to Be There. 
### 
The annual conference of the Young
Women's Christian Associations of the
West is to be held as usual at. Capi
tola, beginning Saturday, March 27.
This is but one of the similar confer
ences throughout the world —one to
be held at this time in Ceylon, where
the same Bible courses will be taken.
Capitola is a large hotel, situated on
ilie very rim of the sea, near the pines.
For the week the entire place will
be turned over to the association. Miss
M. S. Squire, '07, and Miss S. Hyatt,
'06, will act as business managers,
having filled the same position at the
last conference.
The Stanford delegation already
numbers over forty, and includes as
faculty members Mrs. Russell, Mrs.
Allen and Mrs. Green.
The members are promised partic
ularly good opportunities this year, in
that besides such western leaders as
John Willis Baer of Los Angeles and
Dr. Boyle of Evanston, 111., the Na
tional Board is sending out five na
tional secretaries instead of one as
heretofore, thus affording the women
a chance to know personally some of
the great leaders of the work. Many
of these men and women are of the
finest type of intellectual depth and
magnetic personalities, and one can
only become stronger and broader
through knowing them.
Considerable interest in the confer
ence has been aroused at the Univer
sity of California, and a body of wo
men students there will be in attend
ance at the spring convention during
the latter part of the week.
