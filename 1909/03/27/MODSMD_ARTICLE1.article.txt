# CALIFORNIA FRESHMEN WIN
## VARSITY WINS MEET BY A SCORE OF 92½-29½ Smallness of Team Causes Overwhelming Defeat of Southern Athletes—Crawford Shows Good Form. 
### 
In this morning's meet the Varsity
team easily defeated the University of
Southern California track team by a
■score of 92 1-2 to 29 1-2.
Owing to the small number of men
which were brought up from the South
io represent the Los Angeles college,
the men were compelled to enter too
many events to do justice to them
selves. No entries were made in the
two-mile event, and in several others
there was but one representative.
Some of the best performances of
the day were the shot and hammer
throws. Crawford eclipsed all com
petitors in these events and showed
a complete return to his old form. His
hurl of 142 feet with the hammer is the
best mark of the season in this event
as also is the distance of 43 feet 10 1-2
i;iches to which he heaved the shot.
Hemphill ran a beautiful race in the
mile, allowing Bradford to set the
pace for the first three laps, himself
taking the lead in the last lap, winning
easily by a good margin, covering the
distance in the line time of 4:35.4. Tn
addition to this, Hemphill took second
place in the half-mile, which was won
by J. O. Miller in 1:59.2. Miller is
running this distance consistently un
der twt) minutes and should break the
intercollegiate record for this event in
the big meet.
As no entries were made by the
southern University in the two-mile
run. all three places went to Stanford.
The race was won by Worthington in
10:18, and although closely pressed
by Adams in the stretch, he had suffi
cient reserve strength and easily fin
ished in the lead.
