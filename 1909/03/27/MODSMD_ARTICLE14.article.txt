# TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## VARSITY WILL CONTEND WITH U.C. NINE FOR SUPREMACY. Berkeley Diamond Will Be Scene of First Intercollegiate Ball Game Next Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
One week from today, Saturday,
April 3, the nines representing the
Cardinal and the Blue and Gold will
cross bats 011 the California diamond
in the first game of the intercollegiate
series. Promptly at 2:30 the umpire,
who has not been agreed upon as yet,
will give the "play-ball" signal, and
the annual championship struggle will
be on.
While the personnel of the Varsity
has not been definitely settled, the fact
mat eight veterans of past series with
California answered the call of Coach
Presley at the inception of the pres
ent season, and have continued 011 the
squad in the preliminary games
loaves small room for conjecture as to
.lie final line-up. And, although bad
v eather conditions have interfered
materially with the schedule and prac
tice of the Varsity, the approach of
the crucial series finds the local team
fit to put up a superior article of ball
against the players from across the
bay. The prospects for a Stanford
victory are most encouraging. An ap
parent weakness in the hitting an i
fielding departments during the earlier
games has gradually disappeared un
til today accurate handling of the
leather sphere and a satisfactory rec
ord with the willow marks the work
•»f the Varsity.
Theile and Scofield constitute Stan
ford's twirling department for the
games with the State university, and
Canterbury and McGregor have been
the receiving members of the battery.
Theile has already participated in two
intercollegiate series and his experi
ence should stand him in good stead,
Scofield pitched a heady brand of ball
ip several of the preparatory contest.-,
with outside aggregations. Canter
bury, who is the only Freshman 011
the squad, has acquitted himself cred
itably behind the bat in those games
in which he has taken part. The
same may be said of McGregor. Both
of these men are somewhat slow in
winging the ball to the bases.
At the last moment it has been dis
covered that Smith, one of the pitch
ing mainstays, is inelegible to com
pete against the Californians because
of the one-year rule. He registered ai
the University of California for a few
months during the spring semester o''
1908, though without receiving credit
for the work, and for this reason Dr.
Angell and Coach Presley have with
drawn his name from the eligibility
list recently submitted to the athletic
authorities of the State institution.
In the field Stanford will be repre
sented by one of the strongest combi
nations that has ever gone to make
up a Cardinal Varsity. Bell. Cadwal
ader, Sampson and Mitchell, all vet
erans, will probably be seen in the
positions which they have covered
during the past few contests. Should
Scott recover sufficiently from his
painful ankle injury, suffered by him
in the Southern California track meet,
he will also figure in the line-up. The
presence of Tallant, Scofield, Ganong

mid Ball assures an almost impreg
nable outfield.
Next Monday the Varsity will travel
to the California campus to induce
in a short practice on the scene of the
first argument with the Rue and Gobi
The following day, the St. Mary's n n ■
will arrive on the local diamond for a
final game with the Cardinal team,
2:30 being the time set for the open
ing inning.
The California Varsity has under
gone varying vicissitudes of fortune
uuring the season drawing to a close.
Internal dissensions recently resulted
in the withdrawal of Coach Causle.v
pnd Captain Myers, the star lirst base
man. However, a good showing has
been made against opposing teams,
and in spite of the fact that but two
veterans are available, California will
doubtless present a strong line-up .1
ueek from today.
