The Stanford Freshmen met defeat
before the Blue and Gold this after
noon by the score of 79 to 43, though
the one-sided score does not fairly ex
press the game fight which the Card
inal athletes put up against the Cali
fornia entries, who outnumbered them
j in nearly every event. The result was
(he predicted outcome and very near
previous calculations, as Captain Hor
ton had estimated the Stanford score
fit, 40 points.
The competition was close in nearly
every event, and the performances
were uniformly good. Two Freshman
records were broken and both by con
siderable margins. W. H. Newman
ran the star race of the day for Stan
ford in the two-mile, defeating Mar
tin (C.) by 12") yards, after running
the nine and Gold entry off his feet
in the last two laps. The time of
10:11 set in this race is 17 seconds
better than the former record held
h v L. Thompson of California. The
other record to be changed was the
hammer throw, where the mark of 140
feet 9 inches, set by Munn last year,
was bettered by Captain Gabbert, who
tossed the weight 141 feet 1 inch, de
feating Wooiley by about fi feet.
Coleman did all that was expected
of him in the sprints, winning both
events with ease and showing splen
did form. Argabrite secured third in
the hundred after a hard fight in both
heat and finals, though he was beat
en by inches by Riley (C.) for the
same place in the longer dash. Supel
veda suffered a severe breakdown in
(he hundred. California took a large
majority of the points in the hurdles,
though Whitney took a second over
the low barriers and Doron a third in
(he high hurdles, while Arrell secured
a tie for third in the low.
Moth middle-distance events went
to California, with Stanford securing
only one placc. Butler and Chase
were too fast for Wallacli and King
in the quarter, the former winning in
51.4. Dickinson ran himself out in
the first lap of the half and was beat
en out, for third at the tape by Brown.
r lbe mile brought out, a surprise in
Johnson, who fought McPherson for
the lead all the last lap. and lost by

only a few feet in 4:48. Levy, who
set a hot pace at first, was third.
In the weights Captain Gabbert (C.>
and Woolley fought a close contest, the
Californian winning in the hammer,
but losing to the Cardinal entry in
(he shot, though Woolley's toss was
only 38.1f» feet. Peake was at his besc
in the pole, winning at 10 feet 10 1-4
inches. In the jumps Stanford took
more points than had been expected.
Arrell took a third in the broad; Do.-
ion captured second in the high and
Van Dyke tied for third in the same
event.
The relay was an interesting con
test, though California had a consid
erable lead from the first lap, and
though Coleman cut this down to a
few yards in the last lap, he was un
able to win from Butler.

The Stanford Freshmen met defeat
before the Blue and Gold this after
noon by the score of 79 to 43, though
the one-sided score does not fairly ex
press the game fight which the Card
inal athletes put up against the Cali
fornia entries, who outnumbered them
j in nearly every event. The result was
(he predicted outcome and very near
previous calculations, as Captain Hor
ton had estimated the Stanford score
fit, 40 points.
The competition was close in nearly
every event, and the performances
were uniformly good. Two Freshman
records were broken and both by con
siderable margins. W. H. Newman
ran the star race of the day for Stan
ford in the two-mile, defeating Mar
tin (C.) by 12") yards, after running
the nine and Gold entry off his feet
in the last two laps. The time of
10:11 set in this race is 17 seconds
better than the former record held
h v L. Thompson of California. The
other record to be changed was the
hammer throw, where the mark of 140
feet 9 inches, set by Munn last year,
was bettered by Captain Gabbert, who
tossed the weight 141 feet 1 inch, de
feating Wooiley by about fi feet.
Coleman did all that was expected
of him in the sprints, winning both
events with ease and showing splen
did form. Argabrite secured third in
the hundred after a hard fight in both
heat and finals, though he was beat
en by inches by Riley (C.) for the
same place in the longer dash. Supel
veda suffered a severe breakdown in
(he hundred. California took a large
majority of the points in the hurdles,
though Whitney took a second over
the low barriers and Doron a third in
(he high hurdles, while Arrell secured
a tie for third in the low.
Moth middle-distance events went
to California, with Stanford securing
only one placc. Butler and Chase
were too fast for Wallacli and King
in the quarter, the former winning in
51.4. Dickinson ran himself out in
the first lap of the half and was beat
en out, for third at the tape by Brown.
r lbe mile brought out, a surprise in
Johnson, who fought McPherson for
the lead all the last lap. and lost by

only a few feet in 4:48. Levy, who
set a hot pace at first, was third.
In the weights Captain Gabbert (C.>
and Woolley fought a close contest, the
Californian winning in the hammer,
but losing to the Cardinal entry in
(he shot, though Woolley's toss was
only 38.1f» feet. Peake was at his besc
in the pole, winning at 10 feet 10 1-4
inches. In the jumps Stanford took
more points than had been expected.
Arrell took a third in the broad; Do.-

The relay was an interesting con

before the Blue and Gold this after
noon by the score of 79 to 43, though
the one-sided score does not fairly ex
press the game fight which the Card
inal athletes put up against the Cali
fornia entries, who outnumbered them
j in nearly every event. The result was
(he predicted outcome and very near
previous calculations, as Captain Hor
ton had estimated the Stanford score
fit, 40 points.
The competition was close in nearly
every event, and the performances
were uniformly good. Two Freshman
records were broken and both by con
siderable margins. W. H. Newman
ran the star race of the day for Stan
ford in the two-mile, defeating Mar
tin (C.) by 12") yards, after running
the nine and Gold entry off his feet
in the last two laps. The time of
10:11 set in this race is 17 seconds
better than the former record held
h v L. Thompson of California. The
other record to be changed was the
hammer throw, where the mark of 140
feet 9 inches, set by Munn last year,
was bettered by Captain Gabbert, who
tossed the weight 141 feet 1 inch, de
feating Wooiley by about fi feet.
Coleman did all that was expected
of him in the sprints, winning both
events with ease and showing splen
did form. Argabrite secured third in
the hundred after a hard fight in both
heat and finals, though he was beat
en by inches by Riley (C.) for the
same place in the longer dash. Supel
veda suffered a severe breakdown in
(he hundred. California took a large
majority of the points in the hurdles,
though Whitney took a second over
the low barriers and Doron a third in
(he high hurdles, while Arrell secured
a tie for third in the low.
Moth middle-distance events went
to California, with Stanford securing
only one placc. Butler and Chase
were too fast for Wallacli and King
in the quarter, the former winning in
51.4. Dickinson ran himself out in
the first lap of the half and was beat
en out, for third at the tape by Brown.
r lbe mile brought out, a surprise in
Johnson, who fought McPherson for
the lead all the last lap. and lost by

only a few feet in 4:48. Levy, who
set a hot pace at first, was third.
In the weights Captain Gabbert (C.>
and Woolley fought a close contest, the
Californian winning in the hammer,
but losing to the Cardinal entry in
(he shot, though Woolley's toss was
only 38.1f» feet. Peake was at his besc
in the pole, winning at 10 feet 10 1-4
inches. In the jumps Stanford took
more points than had been expected.
Arrell took a third in the broad; Do.-
ion captured second in the high and
Van Dyke tied for third in the same
event.
The relay was an interesting con
test, though California had a consid
erable lead from the first lap, and
though Coleman cut this down to a
few yards in the last lap, he was un
able to win from Butler.
