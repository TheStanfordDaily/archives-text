# BLIND TO DEBATE LOWELL.
## Interesting Forensic Contest to Be Held in Chapel Between Preparatory Schools. 
### 
Next Saturday evening, April 10, a
debate of interscholastic importance
will be held in the chapel at 8 o'clock,
between the Lowell High School of
San Francisco and the California In
stitute for the Blind of Berkeley.
This contest will be for the posses
sion of the Stanford cup (hat has been
offered by the University to the winner
of the series of debates carried on by
the Debating League of Northern Cali
fornia. Retaining possession of the
trophy three times will allow the suc
cessful school perpetual ownership in
the cup and as the Institute for the
Blind has won the prize twice, much
ir.terest attaches itself to this coming
debate.
According to the articles originat
ing the contests, three Stanford pro
fessors will officiate as the judges for
the evening, while A. E. Roth, '09, will
preside as President of the Student
Body.
Stanford has placed a similar cup
in the southern part of the state to
be won under the same conditions by
any school in the Debating League
of Southern California,
