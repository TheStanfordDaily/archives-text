### 
On Tuesday, March 30, the Varsit

Mary's nine, defeating ihem 1-0. Bod
teams played a fine class of ball
Theile pitched four innings and di
not allow a hit. Scofield was 011 thr
mound for the remaining five inning
and was touched up for two meage'
singles. It is difficult, to explain th*'
reversal of form shown by the Var
sily in (he first intercollegiate game
when the article of ball displayed ir
the game with St. Mary's is consid
ered.
