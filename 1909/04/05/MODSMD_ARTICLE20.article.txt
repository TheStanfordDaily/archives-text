The Greater Norris C. Rowe circus
ynd menagerie will exhibit in Palo
Aito next Thursday, April 8, afternoon

new to the people of this section.
Norris & Rowe have been coming here
for years, pleasing large audiences.
This year the show is bigger than
ever before as a giraffe has been added
to the large menagerie. The animal
has been christened "Nosey" on ac
count of his extraordinary length of
neck, which enables him to feed off
the tops of trees. The funny clowns,
the daring acrobats and bareback
riders, the animals, and the gorgeous
paraphenalia all make this circus a
f'.rs.t-class one.
