# CALIFORNIA WINS FIRST BALL GAME
## Stanford Nine Defeated 5 to 3 by Blue and Gold in Sensational Match at Berkeley.—Poor Playing in Second Inning. 
### 
The first game of the intei*collegiate
baseball series, played on the Berkeley
diamond last Saturday afternoon, was
an unexpected exhibition of the na
tional sport. Contrary to general ex
pectations, the Blue and Gold nine,
was able to wrest a 5-3 victory from
the veteran Varsity, in one of the most
desultory, spasmodic games that has
ever marked the diamond struggles of
the two universities. Most of the ac
tion and attendant excitement brewed
hi both halves of the second inning
when the opposing pitchers fairly vied
with each other in taking aerial {lights.
In the first half of this fatal period,
Stanford initiated the scoring by send
ing two men across the plate. Tallant
opened the inning with a single to
third baseman Smith and beat out the
perfect throw to first. Foraker hes
itated in handling Ganong's sacrifice
bunt and the latter reached the key
stone bag in safety. Canterbury fol
lowed with a bunt and negotiated the
initial sack as the result of Forker's
poor headwork, thus filling the bases.
Mitchell walked, forcing Tallant home
with the first run. Theile then forced
Ganong out ot the plate with a poor
hunt. Scott knocked a long sacrifice
fly to center, Canterbury tallying.
Cadwalader was retired at first by
Porker on a dinky hit. The California
rooters breathed easier.
At this point came the most, start
ling performance of the afternoon.
Bases on balls, errors, and misplay.-
followed each other with 'confusing
rapidity and California scored four
runs during the course of the last half
I of the inning without getting one hit
This proved sufficient to win the game
Brady was allowed free transporta
tion to first but would have been
caught stealing second, had not Samp
son dropped Thelle's low throw of
Steele's bunt, who rested safely at
Prst. The bases filled when Bell
dropped Mitchell's accurate throw in
in effort, to retire Anthony. At this
crucial juncture, Theile 'forced a run
'n by hitting batter Stoner. Brady
ambling home. To add to the dlscom-
Iturt; of the Stanford rooters, Theile
walked Forker and thus brought about
be second run, Steele completing thr
~ircitit. Christen Hew out to Ganong.
Vnthorry sprinting home on the sac
••'tice. Forker was enabled on an
\ttempted steal to second. Sampson
hrew the ball over Canterbury's
'lead and permitted Stoner to trot
""cross the pan with the fourth run.
,: !mit'h lifted a fly to Ganong and the
igony was ever.
Anthony muffed Cadwalader's pop
' v in th<"» ftf'h period and the third
Cardinal run resulted. The Varsity
second baseman made second on
stone's impossible throw and Captain
Si'mnson scored him with a beautiful
diive over shortstop. Tn its half of
this session. California renlied in kind
<>v send in? Sm'th around the bases in
"onsernieicp of Sampson's futile en
deavor to pocket an outfield fly, a
-tolen bn~e a"d Lewis' clean two bag
,r er. After this Inning neither team
a?ain annroached scoring. The game
devolved almost wholly on the pitchers

and infielders, and the steadiness of
Theile and Forker for the remainder
of the contest precluded additional
run getting. Barring, the second in
ning ascension, Theile twirled most
effectively against the Californians.
All of the Stanford misplays except
one occurred in that period and the
ragged character of the play marred
on otherwise interesting struggle for
supremacy.
The five hits garnered off Forker's
delivery were widely scattered though
two of them figured in the scoring.
Six Stanford runners were left on the
bases. In the outfield Tallant, Scott,
and Ganong accepted the few chances
perfectly, the latter in particular mak
ing three good catches.
Mitchell, at third, was the undoubted
fielding star of the day and once more
demonstrated his versatility as a ball
player. He made two sensational one
l'.anded stops of terrific liners thereby
depriving Brady and Stoner of almost
ccrtain hits. None the less brilliant
were his inarrelously speedy and ac
curate throws to Bell. Smith, playing
the same position for the California
nine, also exhibited some clever field
ing. Scott, the first man to step to
the plate in the opening inning, began
auspiciously by connecting for a clean
hit over third with the first pitched
ball. Catcher Canterbury justified
Coach Presley's confidence on him.
'5y exceptional exertion he retired one
tatter by catching a foul fly.
The usual good spirit prevailed in
| the respective rooting sections and
i four thousand spectators enjoyed the
contest throughout. The enthusiasm
of the partisans kept pace with the
alternating and somewhat uncertain
fortunes of the contending aggrega
tions. The summary:
