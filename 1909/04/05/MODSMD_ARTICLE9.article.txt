Stanford suffered.an unexpected de
feat on tlie baseball diamond Saturday
ior which we are all sorry. The spirit
of defeat should not, however, prevade
ihe campus. The Stanford team dur
ing the exception of one crucial in
ning, clearly demonstrated that it was
mere than a match for our opponents
end with consistent and hard playing,
together with plenty of support of the
Sludent Body should be able to turn
the ultimate outcome of the series
from defeat to victory. The de
feat was assuredly a disappointment
but the team needs encouragment and
not criticism.
