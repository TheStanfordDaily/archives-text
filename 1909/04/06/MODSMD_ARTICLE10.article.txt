Much has been done in the past few
years to better and increase the equip
ment of the various athletic teams o."
Stanford, and while the disbursements
have been made with an eye to give
each branch its proportionate amount
it would appear that in this respect
the importance of providing for the
members of the boating squad lias
been underestimated.
At practically every large institu
tion where rowing 's conducted as an
intercollegiate sport, the crews are
more amply provided for than they
are here. The equipment here is ex
tremely meager and inadequate if
rowing is to be placed on as popular
a basis as is anticipated. To itemize
the present apparatus is convincing
of this point. Outside of the two
eight-oar shells, one four-oar shall,
one four-oar barge and pair-oar barge
little remains to mention except two
ramshackle boathouses and a few ex
tra oars and a rowing machine which
belongs to the University. At the
University of California the equipment
is large comparatively speaking. With
the old ferry steamer as a boat house,
three eight-oar shells, a number of
fours, barges of various descriptions
and an excellent coaching power boat
their equipment is such as to give
them many advantages.
While we realize that up to within
recently the Student Hody lias been
beset with debts it is proper, we be
lieve, with the addition of other im
provements to the track, football
and baseball equipments, that some
provision should lie made for the oars
men, both at Lagunita and Redwood
City.
We have been told that the oarsmen
would appreciate such small conven
iences as the installation of showers
and locker rooms. Perhaps even these
changes could be realized this season,
but before another has begun we be
lieve more elaborate provision should
be made for the crews.
