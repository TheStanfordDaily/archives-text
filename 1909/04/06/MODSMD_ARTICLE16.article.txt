# No Student Rates for Vacation.
## 
### 
The Southern Pacific as well as the
other railroads of the state have de
cided to discontinue excursion rates
which they have previously granted
to students for their trip home during
summer vacation.
This action was taken by the rail
roads last week, but the Registrar's
office did not receive word from the
local Southern Pacific office until yes
terday.
Nothing has been sa'd about stu
dent rates which have been given for
the other vacations durimr the college
year, so it is presumed that they will
not be affected by the new ruling.
