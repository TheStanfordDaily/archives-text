# INTERCLASS TRACK MEET AT 3:30
## Contest Will Not Be as Close as in Past Years.—Seniors Should Win, with Struggle for Second Place Between Lower Classes. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon at 3:30 the an
nual Inter-class track meet will be
held. While (he meet will not be as
close as in previous years good con
tests are expected in most of the
events, it seems almost certain that
the outcome of the meet will be a
victory for the class of 1909 with the
Sophomores and Freshmen contesting
for second place.
With Miller, Horton, Morris, and
McGregor competing with the Senior
team, first place in every event entered
with (he exception of (he two-mile run
and (he dashes should go to 1909.
However, since Miller is just recover
ing from an attack of la grippe it is
possible that he may not be sufficently
strong to capture (he 440 and SSO yard
dashes in which case 1911 will make
a strong bid for first in the quarter
mile with Wyman.
Crawford and Horton between them
should take the majority of points in
the weight events while Stolz and
Morris will be strong competitors in
the broad jump. No entries were
made by the Seniors in either the
pole vault or high jump. The 1909
relay team is unusually strong and
should capture that event with ease
The mile run will undoubtedly bring
out a close contest between Bradford.
McGregor and Fletcher as Hemphill
is unable to run, being incapacitated
by an attack of water-on-the-knee.
While suffering no great pain from his
injury, the accident, has prevented
Hemphill from training for a few days
and will lie a serious set- back for him
in getting into condition for the In
tercollegiate meet.
Coleman should take both sprints,
as ho is running in fine form now, and
Woolley will probably secure some
more points for the Freshman in the
weight events. If Scott, '10. does not :
filter tbe vault, first place should go]
•o A. Peake, '12, whose work in the j
Freshman meet shows great promise, j
H. E. Reed, '10, will compete in the j
100 and 220 yard dashes to-morrow,
but bis points will not lie counted as
he is ineligible.

To-morrow afternoon at 3:30 the an

held. While (he meet will not be as
close as in previous years good con
tests are expected in most of the
events, it seems almost certain that
the outcome of the meet will be a
victory for the class of 1909 with the
Sophomores and Freshmen contesting
for second place.
With Miller, Horton, Morris, and
McGregor competing with the Senior
team, first place in every event entered
with (he exception of (he two-mile run
and (he dashes should go to 1909.
However, since Miller is just recover
ing from an attack of la grippe it is
possible that he may not be sufficently
strong to capture (he 440 and SSO yard
dashes in which case 1911 will make
a strong bid for first in the quarter
mile with Wyman.
Crawford and Horton between them
should take the majority of points in
the weight events while Stolz and
Morris will be strong competitors in
the broad jump. No entries were
made by the Seniors in either the
pole vault or high jump. The 1909
relay team is unusually strong and
should capture that event with ease
The mile run will undoubtedly bring
out a close contest between Bradford.
McGregor and Fletcher as Hemphill
is unable to run, being incapacitated
by an attack of water-on-the-knee.
While suffering no great pain from his
injury, the accident, has prevented
Hemphill from training for a few days
and will lie a serious set- back for him
in getting into condition for the In
tercollegiate meet.
Coleman should take both sprints,
