In the last number of the Independ
ent, E. HI Slosson, associate editor of
that magazine, lias written an inter
esting article giving some of the im
pressions he received while visiting
Stanford last fall.
At the outset the writer declares
that the buildings and environs of
this university as well as the stu
dent body are distinctly different
p rom those universities throughout the
East and Middle West. Another im
portant contrast Mr. Slosson makes is
in regard to the method Dr. Jordan
has adopted of so frequently choosing
comparatively young but promising
men to fill professorships, whereas
such positions in other universities

are given to men of a more mature
age.
Speaking of (he Stanford scholar
ship, the editor illustrates both by
j diagrams and statistics the extremely
I high standard which is set here and
I attributes it. to Ihe fact that the fac
ulty are desirous of obtaining a good
quality rather than a large quantity
of students.
In conclusion, Slosson treats briefly
of four crises which have confronted
Stanford, beginning with the financial
J stress at the time of the founding and
ending with discussion of last spring.
He declares himself as highly pleased
with the conditions which prevail here
now and predicts a promising career
for an already great institution of
learning.
