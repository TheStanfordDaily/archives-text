# VARSITY AGAIN LOSES
## GAME GOES TO ST. MARY'S NINE BY 13-6 SCORE. Slump of Stanford Players Continues Though Adverse Conditions Cause Errors. 
### 
The Varsity continued its surprising
slump this afternoon, and for the third
time this season lost to the St. Mary's
College nine, the final score being 13
to 6. The game was played on the
University of California diamond un
der most unfavorable weather and
lield conditions. Errors were numer
ous, particularly in the uniformly re
liable outfield. An exceedingly high
wind largely accounts for this appar
ently poor showing as it was difficult
to judge the high flies. Almost the
entire Cardinal line-up figured in the
misplays that marred the game.
Theile and Scofield both were tried
out in the box and between them per
mitted the collegians to get away with
tew hits. Canterbury caught the en
tire nine innings.
The summary follows:
R H E
Stanford 6 5 7
St. Mary's 13 10 4
Struck out: by Theile 2; by Scofield
2; by Wilcox 3. Batteries: Stanford,
Theile, Scofield and Canterbury; St.
Mary's, Wilcox, Sheely and Simpson.
Umpire, Polkney. Time of game, 1:45.
The last reports from Berkeley state
that in the match between St. Mary's
and California the Blue and Gold var
sity has a lead of one run. The game
was in the third inning. Score 1-0.
