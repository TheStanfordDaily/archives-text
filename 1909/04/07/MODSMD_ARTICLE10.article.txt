Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop by his
generous gift of a trophy cup for in
tercollegiate competition between var
sity crews, has shown conclusively his
interest in affairs of the Student Body.
In expressing our appreciation of the
gift, we believe we reflect not only the
sentiments of the undergraduates of
this University, but of the University
of California.
Boating is comparatively a new
sport on this coast. Its struggle to
its present intercollegiate position has
been fraught with obstacles which
have been overcome by the sacrifice
and enthusiasm of a few. Surely any
thing that can be done to encourage
rowing is to be well received.
It is needless to say that the presen
tation of the cup by Treasurer Lathrop
will give additional zest to the race.
This will be, however, more in the
way of calling the attention of the
undergraduates of the two student
bodies, and less interested spectators,
to the importance of the race and the
merit of the sport, than inciting the
crews to greater effort. To uphold the
name of the University has always
proven a reward sufficient to bring
forth the extending of every ounce of
brawn. We believe the cup will do
much to help rowing to the desired
nitche. and we admire the spirit of
generosity and interest which Mr.
Lathrop has shown.
