## University of Washington Guarantees $300 for Expenses.â€”Course to Be Three Miles. 
### 
Assistant Granduate Manager Tur
ner to-day received a communication
from the graduate manager of Wash
ington University, guaranteeing the
winner of the Varsity Intercollegiate
regatta $MOO, as their share of (he ex
penses in sending the crew North dur
ing the summer vacation. They have
also agreed to row over a three-mile
course, the same as will be rowed on
the Oakland Estuary. The only thing
remaining to he done is to settle upon
a date for this race.
The northern manager has also
asked Stanford to consider the advisa
bility of forming a Pacific Coast Row
ing Association, composed of Califor
nia, Stanford and Washington and to
make the code of laws similar to that
of the Poughkeepsie Association in the
east. Stanford and California have
not acted on this suggestion as yet,
but in all probability some association
for the three colleges may be formed.
