The annual Interclass track meet
held on Stanford oval this afternoon
was won by the class of 1909, which
scored 56 points. 1912 came second
with 36 tallies, 1911 third with 19
points, while 1910 was fourth, making
11 points.
The weather conditions were ideal
and the performances in every event
were of a very high order, one record
being broken and others being equalled
or very closely approached. The
showing made to-day makes the out
look for the Intercollegiate meet more
encouraging than it has been this sea
son.
The only record broken was that
of the Stanford 440-yard dash, which
was run by W. M. Wyman, '11, in
the fast time of ."ill seconds, beating
Ihe previous record held by 11. Brown,
'11, by 3-5 of a second. This race
proved to be the best one of the day.
The contest between Wyman and .Mil
ler being so close that the outcome
was in doubt until the very last when
Wyman made a tremendous spurt and
reached the tape at least 3 feet, ahead
of his opponent.
The hundred also proved to be one
of the closest contests of the meet,
Reed tying the previous record by
running it in 10:1. Owing to the fact
that Reed was inelegible, first place
was given to Coleman whose time was
10:2. Holman had the misfortune to
tear a muscle in Ibis race, and while
his injury is not thought to be serious,
it will probably keep him off the track
for a few days.
The work of Morris over the "sticks"
was remarkably good, the time being
the best this year. His time of :2. r >,3
in the low hurdles is within a fifth of
a second of the intercollegiate record
held by Horton. In the 120-yard
hurdles, he equalled the Intercollegi
ate record by covering the distance in
the fast time of 15:4.
The two-mile and mile runs both
developed hard-fought, contests. In the
former Sweet and Worthington ran
together the entire distance, the latter
winning only by a spurt at the finish.
In the mile run the contest between
Bradford and Fletcher was extremely
close, but Fletcher managed to reach
the tape just ahead.
Coleman showed splendid form in
the 220-yard dash, his time of :22.3

being within a fifth of a second of the
Stanford record.
In the weight events, the best per
formance was that of Wooley, who
threw the hammer 146 feet, 3 inches.
This is three feet better than has been
done in any of the trials this season.
