# SUGGESTS SOLUTION OF NATIONAL RACE PROBLEM
## John Graham Brooks Addresses Assembly Urging More Sympathetic Understanding of Aliens. 
### 
This morning's fourth hour Assem
bly was the occasion for a most in
teresting address by .John Graham
| Brooks, who spoke on "The Race
1 Problem in the United States." The
speaker is a man of wide literary at
tainments, being a member of the
I Harvard faculty as well as the author
! of many standard works on economic
and social topics arid his remarks
were of special value owing to his
exhaustive knowledge of his subject
and the original point of view adopted
I by him in dealing with the race prob
i lent.
As a preface to his address Brooks
I stated that his remarks did not apply
particularly to the local racial condi
j tions but to the national problem
which the nation as a whole must
j solve in the near future. The fact that
J sixty-two nationalities are to be found
in ibis country to-day makes the
question of how these different races
can be amalgamated and assimilated
lone of vital importance.
"This problem is caused," said the
j speaker, "by the lack of sympathy
and understanding between various
races, and this in turn leads to racial
(antagonism and difficulties of various
I kinds. The solution is to be found
in a wider knowledge of the charac
teristics of the foreigners and this
I study will lead to a respect and ad
miration which will replace the dis-
I like and prejudice that formerly ex
isted." In proof of this statement
Brooks pointed out the fact that at
every stage of our history the coming
of every different shade of nation
ality has led to difficulties. Later,
when a more intimate knowledge of

the newcomers had caused us to dis
miss our prejudices, the merits oC
the foreigners were recognized, and
they were welcomed into our social
organism.
To harmonize the races that are
found in the United States, Americans
must first adopt a different attitude
than that held at present which merely
values the foreigners in proportion to
the use to which they can be put.
This is the first step toward a mutual
understanding, and if followed by a
sympathetic study of the foreigners,
a large degree of harmony can be
attained. Every race, no matter how
undesirable it may appear at first, has
qualities which if properly encouraged
will make it a valuable asset to this
country. By this he does not advocate
unlimited immigration, but believes
that it should be carefully regulated
and restricted but that those who do
come should be made an integral part
of our society instead of being made
outcasts as at present.
"We will never live in harmony with
these races," said Brooks, "until we
allow them to work out their lives
in their own way. Harmony is de
pendent upon a deep knowledge of
these people which can only come
through a wide human sympathy,
Just as long as we can deal with im
migrants and aliens in a fair, open
minded spirit, willing to learn what
these people have to teach us and
willing to treat them as fellow men
rather than as tools to be used for
our own personal gain, so long as we
display that temper and that purpose,
we need not have the slighest fear for
the safety of the Republic."
