# WILL ATTEND CHICAGO MEET.

The Hoard of Directors of the In
tercollegiate Conference Meet which
is held annually in Chicago, have com
municated with Manager Stewart re
garding tlu j sending of a Stanford
track team to the 1909 meet. The
Conference is composed of all the
leading universities of the Middle
West, and its annual meet is the most
important contest of the season. If
a team is tent this year it will be the
third time in which a Stanford team
lias entered the meet. Our team was
sent several years ago while last
year's team tied for second place with
the University of Wisconsin.
The cardinal team would stand a
good chance of securing first place as
at present there are men on the track
team who would make a close fight
for first in any meet. The question
of sending a team will probably not
hinge on the result of the Intercol
legiate Meet, as our weakness in field
events, outside of weights, will be a
great factor in determining a dual
contest, while in a conference meet
this would make no difference.
Miller and Wyman should capture
eight points in the quarter, if a com
parison of times is a reliable criterion,
while Miller should encounter no
trouble in winning the 880. Crawford
and Horton in the weight events
should annex 10 points at. least. If
Morris continues to improve in his
work over the hurdles he will be a
factor in those races. From past per
formances, Worthington may be good
for some points in the two-mile, as
it is conceded that with more training
he will cut his time close to 10 min
utes. The sprints will be a source
of trouble as the time made at the
meet is usually 10 seconds or better
in the hundred and around 22.1 in
the longer dash.
An attempt is now under way to
arrange an itinerary for the Eastern
trip. The University of Utah having
agreed to pay $300 for a meet at Salt
Lake City, while the Universities of
Colorado at Boulder, of Denver at Den
ver. and of lowa at Ames have signified
their willingness to meet the Varsity
team in dual contests, but as yet have
made no definite propositions.
