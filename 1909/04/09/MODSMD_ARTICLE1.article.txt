# TO PLAY SECOND GAME
## VARSITIES WILL MEET ON LOCAL DIAMOND TO-MORROW. Baseball Match with California Culled on Old Field at 2:30.—Same Lineup as Before. 
### 
Whether or not the determination
of the intercollegiate baseball cham
pionship for 1909 will require a third
game will be settled to-morrow after
noon, when the Stanford Varsity meets
the Californians in the second game
of the annual series. Contrary to the
plans of the graduate manager earlier
in the semester, to-morrow's contest
will be played on the old Varsity
diamond instead of on Stanford field.
Inability to put the latter field in
satisfactory condition makes it neces
sary that at, least one more battle for
baseball supremacy with the Blue and
Gold be fought out on the scene of
so many former struggles. The um
pire will call the first batter to the
plate promptly at 2:30.
Stanford opened the series on the
University of California grounds last
Saturday afternoon, losing to the Blue
and Gold nine by a 5-3 score. Medio
cre baseball characterized the play of
both sides and the local players were
less fortunate than their opponents
in that practically all of their mis
plays piled uj) in one inning. How
ever, the intervening week, despite the
somewhat ragged showing against
St. Mary's, has served to greatly
strengthen the Cardinal chances for
carrying off the series. The surpris
ing effectiveness of the rival aggrega
tion has invested the local practices
with unusual zest during the past
few days and when the Varsity trots
out. on the diamond to-morrow after
noon it will be prepared to put up a
winning article of ball.
There will be few, if any, changes
in the respective line-ups of the two
teams. Tbeile in the box will face
a California varsity for the eight time
in his career. He is now in better
shape than at any time during the
present season and the visiting team
should find it no easy matter to solve
his delivery. Canterbury is scheduled
to do the receiving.
Forker and Stoner will again do
the battery work for California.
Greenlaw and Moult.on may be given
an opportunity to appear in the out
field. lii no other respect is the state
university nine likely to be attired.
The customary fifty cent admission
will be charged.

Stanford —pitchers, Theile, Scofield:
catchers, Canterbury, McGregor: first
base. Bell; second base, Cadwalader:
shortstop, Sampson: third base, Mit
