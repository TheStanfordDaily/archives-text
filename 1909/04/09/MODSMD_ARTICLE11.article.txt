# CREWS ROUNDING INTO FORM.
## Intercollegiate Regatta to Take Place on Oakland Estuary on Morning of Track Meet. 
### 
The crew men are rounding into
shape very fast and with tlie next
week of training, they will lie in the
best possible condition for their raco
against the University of California
on Saturday.
The Varsity men have been rowing
together considerably all season and
there only remains one place to be
filled in the eight. Although starting
out at the beginning of the present
season with only one veteran from
last, years varsity eight, Coach Dan
Murphy has developed a crew which
is undoubtedly the fastest that has
ever been coached at Stanford Uni
versity.
The Freshman crew has been show
ing up to great advantage all season
and in a recent race with the Varsity,
over a four mile course with a fifteen
second handicap they managed to
cross the line a half a length ahead
of their more experienced rivals.
The Oakland Estliary has been def
initely selected for this year's strug
gle in the Intercollegiate Boat racet'.
Arrangements are being made with
the Southern Pacific Company for a
special observation train. In case
a train is provided the spectators
will have an opportunity of seeing
the entire race, as the course will
be from the Webster Street bridge to
ihe end of the mole. The Government
Revenue Cutters will prevent the sail
ing of any craft on the estuary during
the race.
A special train will leave the cam
pus at the bookstore, on next Saturday
morning, April 17th. and will take its
passengers direct, to the Oakland
mole.
