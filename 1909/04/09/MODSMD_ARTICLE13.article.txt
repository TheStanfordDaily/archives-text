# INTERESTING DEBATE FOR CUP.
## Institution for the Blind to Meet Lowell To-morrow Evening in Chapel. 
### 
Interesting because ot' the unique
character of the contest, an unusual
debate will take place to-morrow eve
ning in the Chapel at eight o'clock.
Berkeley Ecclesia of the California
Institution for the Blind will send
representatives here to compete with
the Lowell High School of San Fran
cisco for the Stanford cup, offered by
the Student Body of the University in
1900 and for medals to be given by
the Debating League of California to
the members of the winning team.
Permanent ownership of the main
trophy is to be secured by three suc
cessful contests by one school, and in
view of the fact that the School for
the Blind has now won two series,
this deciding contest should be very
close.
"Resolved, That the United States
Should Annex Cuba, Conceding that
the Latter Is Willing to Be Annexed"
is the question for debate. Lowell
High School will uphold the affirma
tive of the question, while the Berke
ley institution will oppose them upon
the negative.
Student Body President A. E. Roth,
'09, will act as the presiding officer
of the evening, while three members
of the faculty will officiate as judges.
