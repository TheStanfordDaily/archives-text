# SWEEPING CHANGE MADE IN SCHOLARSHIP RULES
## Academic Council Approves Changes Which Will Practically Do Away With Old "Flunk-Out" System. IMPORTANT CHANGE IN SCHOLARSHIP REGULATIONS. 
### 
"A student who receives passing grades in less than half the work
for which he is registered during his first semester, or in less than
two-thirds during amy subsequent semester, shall he deemed to have
tailed in his studies. After a tirst failure, unless unusually seri
ous, a student may, with the approval of the major department,
again register iu the University, hut Khali be placed on probation
for one semester. A second failure shall result in withdrawal from
the University."

At a meeting of the Academic Coun
cil, the governing body of the Faculty,
held late yesterday, the rules concern
ing failures in scholarship were modi
fied in one important particular. Un
der the regulations heretofore in force
a student deficient in scholarship has
been entitled to two (rials; but before
these two trials there has been a
semester of enforced absence. The
effect of the revised regulations is, in
all ordinary cases to do away with
this period of enforced absence.
This unexpected step was taken by
the Academic Council upon a recom
mendation handed in by the present
Committee on Delinquent Scholarship,
and was so suggested after a careful
study of the situation extending over
many months.
The action taken still allows the
Committee the right to place a student
upon probation at any time, or to sus
pend a student, but the last step is
reserved for flagrant cases, and no
longer applies to all students who fail
in the required number of credits,
which is the same as before.
The change will go into effect at
once and will be used as a basis in
action at the end of the present
semester. Its effect on student af
fairs will date from its passing. In
athletic affairs its effect will be great.
While it is understood that a student
who would formerly have "flunked
out" but is now placed on probation
for a semester and allowed to attend
the University, will be kept out of
athletics because of the retention of
the old probation clause, it will
shorten the length of time that an
athlete is prevented from competition
one half. This means that if a stu
dent is placed on probation for one
semester, the next he will be allowed
to compete, whereas formerly two
semesters were lost; one while the
athlete was out of college, and the
other when registered but on proba
tion.
11 is stated on good authority that
the new plan has been under consider
ation by the Scholarship Committee
for several months, and if was upon
the recommendation of the committee
that the Academic Council approved
I he change.
Under the change it appears that
the mid-semester reports will be re
ceived as before and students doing
unsatisfactory work will be notified
of their deficiencies, the important
change being in the end semester
delinquencies. In this regard thfÂ»
required units of successful work will

j remain the same; namely, at least one
I half of the required work for the first
j semester students and at. least two
| thirds for all other students. The
j students who fail to meet these re
j quirements will be considered to have
| failed in their studies, but instead of
! being compelled to withdraw from the
I University for one semester, will lie
| allowed, unless the work has been
| completely neglected, to register in
the University upon the approval of
the major professor and the consider
ation that the student will be con
sidered on strict probation. A second
failure will mean that, a student is
requested to withdraw from the Uni
versity, this being considered as a sec
ond "flunk-out."
The new regulations covering the ta -
king of leaves-of-absence provide that
j students on probation will not gener
! Tilly be granted the privilege and much
the same procedure will be followei
j in the future regarding the other see-
Jtions of the scholarship regulations
which have not been materially al
tered.
As the regulations now stand they
I read:
1. Mid-semester reports on scholar
ship shall be obtained from all in
structors, and students reported as do
ing unsatisfactory work shall be noti
fied of their deficiencies.
2. A student whose work is unsat
isfactory may be placed on probation
at any time.
3. At the middle and at the end of
the semester each Department shall
lie notified of all serious deficiencies
in scholarship affecting students
whose major work is in that depart
ment.
4. A student who receives passing
grades in less than half the work for
which he is registered during his first
semester, or in less than two-third
during any subsequent semester, shall
be deemed to have failed in his stud
ies. After a first failure, unless un
I usually serious, a student may. will
the approval of the major department,
j again register in the University, bill
! shall be placed on probation for one
j semester. A. second failure shall re
sult in withdrawal from the Univet -
sity.
5. A student whose delinquency is
unusually serious, or is the result ot
persistent neglect, may be require'l
to withdraw from the University at
any time.
fi. Leave of absence will not gener
ally lie granted to a student on pro
bation, nor to any student whose work

during the current semester is unsat
isfactory, unless applied for at least
six weeks before the end of the se
mester.
7. A student on probation shall not

take part in any intercollegiate con
test. nor represent the University in
any way, whether individually or in
connection with an athletic, literary,
musical, dramatic or other organiza
tion.
8. When a student is seriously de
linquent in scholarship the fact shall
be communicated to bis parent or
guardian.
