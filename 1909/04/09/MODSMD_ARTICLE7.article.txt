The action of the Academic Council
of the Faculty yesterday evening is
undeniably one of (he moat impor
tant .steps taken in the control of af
fairs at this University in recent years.
My the practical abolishment of the
"flunk-out" system the Faculty have
assumed a stand, which if properly
supported by the undergraduates, will
lead to a much greater University.
We regard the step taken by the
Academic Council as one of the larg
est concessions ever made members of
the Student Hody and as such the
privileges allowed should not be
abused. With the posibilities of force
able withdrawal reduced to a mini
mum, it will remain to be seen whether
the members of the Student Hody are
willing and capable of maintaining the
required standard without the pres
ence of figurative "axe."
The concession made is so large,
and the restrictions formerly imposed
of such a rigorous nature, that we
would caution against the natural ef
fect which such a grant may liav*
upon the less responsible members o<
the community.
This semester three important
changes have been made which we be
lieve point conclusively to Studen'
Control, lu the appointment of a Stu
dent. Advisor, the organization of the
University Conference of undergrad
uates and lastly, in the removal of t
rigid "flunk-out.," system, it would seem
that we. had ample proof of better
things to come.
It. is now up (o the members of the
Student Hody to realize and appreciate
the change. A spirit whoch would
result in a large number of students
being placed on probation could only
be construed to mean that the fear of
flunking must, ever l:e present in ei
der that, the work required shall be
accomplished. This we do not be
lieve, and think the Faculty is of the
same opinion. The plan is now an

experiment, and as such the members
ot' the Student body are on test. Stan
ford spirit has long been a bye won!
which has enabled many obstacles to
to be overcome and should now be
utilized to keep the scholarship stand
ing ui) to the mark and justify the
confidence imposed.
We believe that, to the members of
the present Scholarship Committee
much credit for the change is due. It
was upon the suggestion of the mem
bers ol' this Committee that the ac
tion was based, and, as originators
and promoters of a policy which will
result in a broader and greater Uni
versity, the appreciation and thanks
of the Student Body should be ten
dered.
