# DISCUSS SENIOR WEEK PLANS.
## Memorial Function to Be Revived.-First Senior Singing a Decided Success. 
### 
The chairmen of the various Senior
Week Committees met last Friday eve
ning and discussed plans for the fes
tivities from both the financial and
social standpoints. From present in
dications the celebration will be the
most elaborate and successful ever
held. To insure the financial success
of the undertaking, an assessment will
probably be levied on the class.
A special feature of the Senior Week
will be the revival of the Memorial
function, which was originated by
President A. Trowbridge of the class
of '05. This function consists of the
entire Senior class marching in a body
to the Mausoleum, after the laying
of the class plate, and depositing llow
ers for the last time. After the cere
mony the Senior President will turn
over the flower trust to the Junior
class president.
Further plans for Senior Week will
be discussed at a class meeting to be
held Wednesday afternoon.
The custom of Senior singing was
inaugurated last Sunday by the men
of the class. Between sixty and sev
enty men assembled on the shore of
Lagunita for a half hour of singing
The singing was led by C. B. Bradford,
'09, and was a decided success. The
time and place of the next gathering
will be decided at the class meeting
on Wednesday.
