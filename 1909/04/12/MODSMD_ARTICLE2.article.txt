# SECOND GAME IS WON BY VARSITY
## Stanford Nine Victorious in Loosely Played Contest by Score of 13-7.— California Uses Fourteen Men, Who Make Many Errors. 
### 
II 1 the first intercollegiate baseball
game with California was mediocre,
then there is no word to adequately
describe the second one of the series
which was won by the Varsity on the
local diamond Saturday afternoon by
the one sided score of 13 to 7. Had
the Varsity not permitted the Cali
fornians to pile up five runs in the
first of the eighth, the contest might
have been called an exhibition of base
ball on at least one side, but in that
period the Cardinal infield committed
a succession of glaring errors which
gave their opponents the opportunity
of romping around the bases with
great ease. Forker, the far-heralded
Freshman pitcher, was not the enig
ma for the local batsman that he
seemed to be on the preceding Satur
day and during the two and a half
innings that he officiated as slabster
for the Blue and Gold, he issued seven
free trips to the keystone sack and
allowed one hit. White replaced him
in the middle of the third inning and
for a time bid fair to do even worse,
giving two walks and two safeties,
which brought in three more runs,
before retiring the side.
California opened the scoring in the
first of the second, Lewis crossing the
plate with the lone tally as the re
sult of a walk, two sacrifices and some
poor headwork on first base in an
effort to throw Steele out at that
station. Not until its half of the eighth
did the Californians again seriously
threaten to tally. In that period, For
ker, the first batter to face Theile,
walked. Then for a few moments, the
Stanford players indulged in some
costly playing. Errors by Cadwalader,
Sampson and Bell, coupled with a sin
gle and a two bagger, yielded five runs
to the Berkeleyites, Forker, White,
Smith, Allen and Steele being the men
who scored largely on the misplays.
In the ninth, Gulyes, one of the five
substitutes used by the California
coach in a desperate effort to stem the
tide, drew a pass, stole second and
sprinted home on Smith's beautiful
triple to left fielt. One of the most
perfect relays that has ever been seen
here enabled Canterbury to touch
Smith out at the plate. Tallant and
Sampson also took part in the play.
Space forbids a detailed account of
the manner in which the thirteen
Stanford runs were scored. Suffice it
to say that six tallies were registered
in the third session alone, while in
four other innings runners were sent
around the circuit. In the second
Ganong enthused the Stanford adher
ents by scoring from second base on
Canterbury's beautiful single over
Anthony. Canterbury continued on to
second, when Allen attempted to "nail"
Ganong at the plate, reached third on
Lewis' fumble of Scott's grounder and
ambled home on Cadwalader's sacri
fice fly to center. The real entertain
ment. took place in the next inning,
however, when Sampson, Tallant, Ga
nong, Canterbury, Theile and Scott, all
made the full circuit of the diamond.
Five walks, two sacrifices, and two
safeties represent the activity of the j
Varsity players during the combined I

regimes of Forker aiul White' in this
inning. The game degenerated into
a foot race and the Cardinals sprinted
around the bases amid the noisy ap
proval and glee of the rooters. In the
fifth, Theile added another tally on a
walk, Scott's single over second and
Steele's failure to stop the rolling
sphere. Ganong made his third trip
around the diamond in the seventh.
He was hit by White, stole second and
trotted home when Forker let Theile's
single go between his legs. The three
last runs were made in the eighth
inning, Sampson contributing a single
and errors by Smith, Anthony and Al
len doing the rest.
There were few Hashes of superior
ball playing during the two hours and
twenty-four minutes of the game.
Theile pitched in something like his
old time form and prevented the op
posing batters from connecting effec
tively. His hitting averaged a thou
sand as he walked thrice and singled
once. Scott, Ganong and Canterbury
played hard, consistent baseball at all
times, in the field and at bat.
The California line-up disclosed no
"stars." Practically every man on the
team made an error and did little to
redeem the farcical playing. One or
two of the Blue and Gold men added
Questionable tactics to their already
bad performances.
Large delegations of rooters cheered
on the recpective nines. Vociferous
applause greeted every play, good or
bad, and the onlookers seemed to
thoroughly enjoy the afternoon in spite
of the somewhat loose article of ball
played.

station. Not until its half of the eighth
did the Californians again seriously
threaten to tally. In that period, For
ker, the first batter to face Theile,
walked. Then for a few moments, the
Stanford players indulged in some
costly playing. Errors by Cadwalader,
Sampson and Bell, coupled with a sin
gle and a two bagger, yielded five runs
to the Berkeleyites, Forker, White,
Smith, Allen and Steele being the men
who scored largely on the misplays.
In the ninth, Gulyes, one of the five
substitutes used by the California
coach in a desperate effort to stem the
tide, drew a pass, stole second and
sprinted home on Smith's beautiful
triple to left fielt. One of the most
perfect relays that has ever been seen
here enabled Canterbury to touch
Smith out at the plate. Tallant and
Sampson also took part in the play.
Space forbids a detailed account of
the manner in which the thirteen
Stanford runs were scored. Suffice it
to say that six tallies were registered
in the third session alone, while in
four other innings runners were sent
around the circuit. In the second
Ganong enthused the Stanford adher
ents by scoring from second base on
Canterbury's beautiful single over
Anthony. Canterbury continued on to
second, when Allen attempted to "nail"
Ganong at the plate, reached third on
Lewis' fumble of Scott's grounder and
ambled home on Cadwalader's sacri
fice fly to center. The real entertain
ment. took place in the next inning,
however, when Sampson, Tallant, Ga
nong, Canterbury, Theile and Scott, all
made the full circuit of the diamond.
Five walks, two sacrifices, and two
safeties represent the activity of the j
Varsity players during the combined I

regimes of Forker aiul White' in this
inning. The game degenerated into
a foot race and the Cardinals sprinted
around the bases amid the noisy ap
proval and glee of the rooters. In the
fifth, Theile added another tally on a
walk, Scott's single over second and
Steele's failure to stop the rolling
sphere. Ganong made his third trip
around the diamond in the seventh.
He was hit by White, stole second and
trotted home when Forker let Theile's
single go between his legs. The three
last runs were made in the eighth
inning, Sampson contributing a single
and errors by Smith, Anthony and Al
len doing the rest.
There were few Hashes of superior
ball playing during the two hours and
twenty-four minutes of the game.
Theile pitched in something like his
old time form and prevented the op
posing batters from connecting effec
tively. His hitting averaged a thou
sand as he walked thrice and singled
once. Scott, Ganong and Canterbury
played hard, consistent baseball at all
times, in the field and at bat.
The California line-up disclosed no
"stars." Practically every man on the
team made an error and did little to
redeem the farcical playing. One or
two of the Blue and Gold men added
Questionable tactics to their already
bad performances.
Large delegations of rooters cheered
on the recpective nines. Vociferous
applause greeted every play, good or
bad, and the onlookers seemed to
thoroughly enjoy the afternoon in spite
of the somewhat loose article of ball
played.

II 1 the first intercollegiate baseball

then there is no word to adequately
describe the second one of the series
which was won by the Varsity on the

the one sided score of 13 to 7. Had
the Varsity not permitted the Cali
fornians to pile up five runs in the
first of the eighth, the contest might
have been called an exhibition of base
ball on at least one side, but in that
period the Cardinal infield committed
a succession of glaring errors which
gave their opponents the opportunity
of romping around the bases with
great ease. Forker, the far-heralded
Freshman pitcher, was not the enig
ma for the local batsman that he
seemed to be on the preceding Satur
day and during the two and a half
innings that he officiated as slabster
for the Blue and Gold, he issued seven
free trips to the keystone sack and
allowed one hit. White replaced him
in the middle of the third inning and
for a time bid fair to do even worse,
giving two walks and two safeties,
which brought in three more runs,
before retiring the side.
California opened the scoring in the
first of the second, Lewis crossing the
plate with the lone tally as the re
sult of a walk, two sacrifices and some

fice fly to center. The real entertain
ment. took place in the next inning,
however, when Sampson, Tallant, Ga
nong, Canterbury, Theile and Scott, all
made the full circuit of the diamond.
Five walks, two sacrifices, and two
safeties represent the activity of the j
Varsity players during the combined I

regimes of Forker aiul White' in this
inning. The game degenerated into
a foot race and the Cardinals sprinted
around the bases amid the noisy ap
proval and glee of the rooters. In the
fifth, Theile added another tally on a
walk, Scott's single over second and
Steele's failure to stop the rolling
sphere. Ganong made his third trip
around the diamond in the seventh.
He was hit by White, stole second and
trotted home when Forker let Theile's
single go between his legs. The three
last runs were made in the eighth
inning, Sampson contributing a single
and errors by Smith, Anthony and Al
len doing the rest.
There were few Hashes of superior
ball playing during the two hours and
twenty-four minutes of the game.
Theile pitched in something like his
old time form and prevented the op
posing batters from connecting effec
tively. His hitting averaged a thou
sand as he walked thrice and singled
once. Scott, Ganong and Canterbury
played hard, consistent baseball at all
times, in the field and at bat.
The California line-up disclosed no
"stars." Practically every man on the
team made an error and did little to
redeem the farcical playing. One or
two of the Blue and Gold men added
Questionable tactics to their already
bad performances.
Large delegations of rooters cheered
on the recpective nines. Vociferous
applause greeted every play, good or
bad, and the onlookers seemed to
thoroughly enjoy the afternoon in spite
of the somewhat loose article of ball
played.

II 1 the first intercollegiate baseball
game with California was mediocre,
then there is no word to adequately
describe the second one of the series
which was won by the Varsity on the
local diamond Saturday afternoon by
the one sided score of 13 to 7. Had
the Varsity not permitted the Cali
fornians to pile up five runs in the
first of the eighth, the contest might
have been called an exhibition of base
ball on at least one side, but in that
period the Cardinal infield committed
a succession of glaring errors which
gave their opponents the opportunity
of romping around the bases with
great ease. Forker, the far-heralded
Freshman pitcher, was not the enig
ma for the local batsman that he
seemed to be on the preceding Satur
day and during the two and a half
innings that he officiated as slabster
for the Blue and Gold, he issued seven
free trips to the keystone sack and
allowed one hit. White replaced him
in the middle of the third inning and
for a time bid fair to do even worse,
giving two walks and two safeties,
which brought in three more runs,
before retiring the side.
California opened the scoring in the
first of the second, Lewis crossing the
plate with the lone tally as the re
sult of a walk, two sacrifices and some
poor headwork on first base in an
effort to throw Steele out at that
station. Not until its half of the eighth
did the Californians again seriously
threaten to tally. In that period, For
ker, the first batter to face Theile,
walked. Then for a few moments, the
Stanford players indulged in some
costly playing. Errors by Cadwalader,
Sampson and Bell, coupled with a sin
gle and a two bagger, yielded five runs
to the Berkeleyites, Forker, White,
Smith, Allen and Steele being the men
who scored largely on the misplays.
In the ninth, Gulyes, one of the five
substitutes used by the California
coach in a desperate effort to stem the
tide, drew a pass, stole second and
sprinted home on Smith's beautiful
triple to left fielt. One of the most
perfect relays that has ever been seen
here enabled Canterbury to touch
Smith out at the plate. Tallant and
Sampson also took part in the play.
Space forbids a detailed account of
the manner in which the thirteen
Stanford runs were scored. Suffice it
to say that six tallies were registered
in the third session alone, while in
four other innings runners were sent
around the circuit. In the second
Ganong enthused the Stanford adher
ents by scoring from second base on
Canterbury's beautiful single over
Anthony. Canterbury continued on to
second, when Allen attempted to "nail"
Ganong at the plate, reached third on
Lewis' fumble of Scott's grounder and
ambled home on Cadwalader's sacri
fice fly to center. The real entertain
ment. took place in the next inning,
however, when Sampson, Tallant, Ga
nong, Canterbury, Theile and Scott, all
made the full circuit of the diamond.
