Coach Dan Murphy to-day an
nounced both the varsity and fresh
man crews with the single exception
of the varsity coxswain, who will he
chosen the latter part of the week.
The crews picked by Murphy repre
sent the best possible rowing material
available and the men have all trained
consistently and hard during the en
tire season.
The eight men to represent the
cardinal in Saturday morning's var
sity race have been generally known
by the University public with the ex
ception of No. 3 which seat will be
filled by P. L. Wilde, '10. R. S. Rey
nolds, '10, W. Fitting, '10, F. L.
Wilde, '10, and T. Huston, '10, have all
rowed in their freshman year and are
well qualified for their respective
places in the eight. Last year's vic
torious 1911 freshman crew gives the
varsity four very strong and good
oarsmen in K. Chamberlain, '11, N. M.
Day, '11, K. L. Dole, '11, and J. A.
Killian, '11. L. E. Dußois, '11, will act
as substitute for the varsity while F.
L. Guerena, '11, or J. W. Roberts, '10,
will be chosen as coxswain.
The personnel of the freshmen eight
will be as follows: R. W. Clyde, H. L.
Dietterle, R. R. Gilmore, J. F. Part
ridge, H. B. Post, A. M. Sanborn, C.
L. Schaupp, R. H. Seward, and R. R.
Hails, substitute. J. W. Howell will
steer the 1912 men.
The two crews will leave the cam
pus shortly for the Oakland Estuary
where accommodations have been
made for the rooming and boarding of
the men in close proximity -to the
University of California Boathouse.
The two shells will be shipped so that
the crews can have competition during
their training on the estuary. Flags
and land-marks will be placed on the
shores of the course to enable the men
to know their distance when nearing
the finishing line.
