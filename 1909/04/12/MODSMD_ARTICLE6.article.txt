Perhaps it takes longer to make the
necessary cases and procure the
proper furnishings for a trophy room
than we anticipated, but it would
surely seem that sufficient time has
elasped since it was decided to have
such an institution here, to allow those
in charge to make some visible move
toward the realization of this much
needed adjunct to the present equip
meut.
To properly place the trophies now
on hand is going to take considerable
time and the work will not be done
if the fitting of the Trophy Room is
delayed until the final examination
week. While we realize that many
matters naturally occupy the attention
of the management at this season, we
believe the installation of the Trophy
Room of sufficient importance to re
ceive immediate consideration.
