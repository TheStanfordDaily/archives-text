Presenting a program peculiarly
adapted to the accentuation of his
wonderful touch and replete with evi
dences of the tonic superiority of his
music, Ossip Gabrilovitsch played last
Saturday evening before a large audi
ence in Ihe Assembly Hall.

Twelve preludes by Chopin was the
Twelve numbers by Chopin made up
the third number upon the program,
while one of the pianist's own compo
sitions, "If I Were a Bird," by Henselt,
and the popular "Rhapsodie, Op. 119"
as written by Brahms completed the
concert.
