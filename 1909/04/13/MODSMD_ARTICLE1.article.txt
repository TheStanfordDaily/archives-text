# NAME CREW COXSWAIN
## C.L. SCHAUPP ELECTED CAPTAIN OF FRESHMAN CREW. Officials for Intercollegiate Regatta Appointed.â€”Varsity Race to Start at 10:15 a.m. Saturday. 
### 
The position of varsity coxswain
was finally settled last evening when
F. L. Guerena, '11, won the position
from J. W. Roberts, '10, by the flipping
of a coin. From the start of the pres
ent rowing season both candidates
have been showing a great deal of
skill and headworlc in the steering of
the boats and it was found impossible
for either Coach Dan Murphy or Cap
tain Reynolds to select this year's cox
swain and do justice to both the men
and themselves, the merits of the two
steerers being equal. It was finally
decided to flip a coin and Guerena
won the call.
C. L. Schaupp, of Santa Rosa, was
elected last evening to captain the
1912 crew in this year's freshman in
tercollegiate race. The captain-elect
is very popular with the men on his
crew and is a powerful rower. He
will occupy seat No. 4, and registers
in the Physiology Department. He is
also a member of the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity.
The regatta will start at 10:15 on
Saturday morning and the varsity race
will be rowed first. The freshman will
follow immediately after the varsity.
The varsity course has been laid
off on the estuary and will be a little
less than three miles. The freshman
distance has finally been settled and
will be only two miles. The repre
sentatives of both Stanford and the
University of California have decided
that any breakage in the boats, oars
or fixtures of the boats, before the
first twenty-five strokes are made, will
result in the calling back of the eights.
It has not been definitely settled
as yet, whether an observation train
can be secured, but in any case, a
grandstand will be situated at, the
finish line for the convenience of tho
spectators.
The officials of the regatta have
been chosen as follows: Referee, Van
derlyn Stow, a former Harvard crew
man: head time keeper, Professor
Durand, Stanford; assistant time
keepers, Professor Magee, U. C.; J. R.
Pemberton, S.; judge of finish, Pat
O'Dae, University of Wisconsin; flag
judge, President Wheeler. U. C.; clerk
of course, to be chosen by University
of California.
Weather forecaster McAddie pre
dicts a calm day for both the morning
and afternoon.
The freshmen and varsity crews
left the campus this morning on the
12:02 train for their new training
quarters in West Oakland where they
will remain until Saturday and be
come familiar with the course. The
shells were shipped yesterday even
ing on the freighter from Redwood
City.
