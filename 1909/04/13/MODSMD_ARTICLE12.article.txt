In choosing the coxswain for the
varsity eight on the fling of a coin
it would appear to any one not fami
liar with the conditions attendant ro
the decision that a decided injustice
had been done the two candidates
concerned. Under ordinary circum
stances we believe this would be true
and the action taken by Coach Murphy
and Captain Reynolds should not bear
the weight of precedent.
The facts of the case, however, ap
pear to justify the decision. We learn
that Coach Murphy was totally at a
loss to make a choice; Captain Rey
nolds. in his official position, was in
a like quandry, and the members of
the crew divided upon the selection,
rather tor class reasons, than other
wise.
In the selection of F. L. Guerena
to steer the shell. Stanford will have
a man who has the confidence of the
crew and Coach Murphy. While J. W.
Roberts will not be in the boat the
same may be said of him. The ef
forts of this last named athlete who
has devoted himself so conscientiously
to the squad deserve recognition.
