# Steamship Company Makes Rate.
## 
### 
As in past years, the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company will make a rate
of one and one-half fares to Stanford
students for the round trip between
San Francisco and any of their ports
of call.
To obtain this rate, students will
pay full fare going home, taking a
receipt for the same. At the end of
the vacation, presentation of this re
ceipt, together with registration card
in the University, will secure from any
of the company's agents a ticket from
any of the company's ports of call at
half fare.
As the travel is very heavy this year,
reservations for berths should be made
at once, and covered either by a de
posit or the purchase of tickets.
