# ANNOUNCE CHESS TEAM
## STANFORD HAS STRONG TEAM OUTCOME UNCERTAIN. Professor Rice Offers Perpetual Trophy Cup.â€”Plans for Its Disposal Not Complete. 
### 
The intercollegiate chess match will
take place in California Hall at the
University of California on Friday
evening, April IG, at 8:30 o'clock. The
try-outs for places on the team have
been completed, and resulted in the
following men being chosen to repre
sent Stanford: T. R. W. F. Figg-
Hoblyn, 'OS, champion, E. J. Cum
mings, OS, J. H. Pratt, '09, A. S. Otis,
'10, W. M. Davidson, '10. h. Mann,
'10, and W. O. Smith, '11. J. W.
Hough, '08, has been chosen alternate.
A hard fight is anticipated among
the followers of chess, and the out
come is very uncertain. There are
lour veterans on the Stanford team,
Figg-Hoblyn, Cummings, Pratr and
Davidson. California has the same
number of veterans, of whom Cook
has twice been champion. Egenhoff
has played in three previous inter
collegiate matches, and won his game
each time. Strong was captain of the
'06 team and De Fremery is thought
to be a likely point winner. Grewer,
champion of Lowell high of San Fran
cisco, and winner of the fall tourna
ment at California, is another danger
ous man.
Prof. Isaac L. Rice of New York
has offered a perpetual trophy cup
on similar conditions to those regard
ing trophies presented by him to
Princeton and Cornell and Yale and
Harvard. The idea of the cup is to
encourage chess in the West. Profes
sor llice is one of the greatest living
patrons of chess and takes a great
interest in intercollegiate contests.
Up to the present, he has confined his
patronage to Princeton, Cornell, Yale
and Harvard. The offer of donating
the cup was brought about mainly
through the efforts of E. J. Clark, a
local chess player of prominence, who
engaged in the simultaneous match
with tlie chess club about a month
ago in Encina Club Room.
Definite details regarding the dis
posal of the cup have not been made
as yet. One plan that was suggested
was to engrave the names of the win
ning team upon it each year until no
space remained, and then to have it
revert to the university having the
greatest number of victories to its
credit.
