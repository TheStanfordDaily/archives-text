# YEAR-BOOK OUT SOON
## ENGLISH CLUB SETS MAY FIRST AS BATE OF SALE. Limited Publication to Contain Best Fiction, Essays, and Verse Contributed from Students. 
### 
A new departure in Stanford liter
ary matters will be inaugurated on
the first of May, when the first volume
of the English Club's Annual Year
book will be placed on sale. The club
has been working since early last fall
to make the volume a worthy one,
and the result will fully justify their
efforts. The committee in charge has
consisted of Mrs. T. P. Russell, Prof.
S. S. Seward, and Assistant Prof. R.
M. Alden, from the faculty, and Miss
H. V. Campbell, gr., P. F. Valentine,
'.09, and S. N. Hillyard, '11, chairman.
The volume will consist of thiry
thousand words of fiction, essays and
verse, and will be well bound in board
covers with a neat cover design.
Among the contributors are Miss H.
V. Campbell, grâ€ž Miss A. Ellerbeck, 'OS.
Miss Iva Miller, Miss A. Shinn, '09,
Miss A. Kimball, '04, Miss Richards,
H. C. Fislce, '09, R. L. Duffus, '10, B.
Bliven, '11, S. N. Hillyard, '11, F. E.
Hill, '11, F. W. Weymouth, '09, and
E. .T. Hopkins, '11. None of the work
in this volume has ever been published
before, and the committee believes
that they have a volume which is an
accurate record of Stanford literary
activities of the year. In order to
insure a favorable reception of this
new venture by the college public, the
price of the volume will be only one
dollar, which does not cover the cost
of printing. Only an extremely small
edition has been ordered, and there
will be no further supply when this
is exhausted. In view of ibis fact
there will probably be a large ad
vance sale. Those desiring copies
should make reservations at once at
the bookstore, to make sure of getting
them. The books will be placed on
sale on the campus and in Palo Alto
on May Day at one dollar each.
