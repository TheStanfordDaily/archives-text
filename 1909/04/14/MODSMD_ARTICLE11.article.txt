We are in accord with the move
ment broached at class meetings held
to-day, whereby it is hoped that the
jeering which marked the intercol
legiate ball game of last Saturday may
be eliminated. It is admitted that the
tendency to "rattle" the pitchers in
the last game was increased by cer
tain incidents which marred the play
but it is our opinion that this should
not be allowed to occur again.
Rooting at a baseball game is nat
ural and permissible, provided it is
of the right kind. Stanford rooters
have never before been guilty of the
tactics of Saturday though in past
years the representatives of the Uni
versity of California have not been so
careful. Undeniably, there were miti
gating circumstances attendant to the
game Saturday, but when the players
from the Berkeley appear Friday an
entirely different reception should be
accorded them.
