Through the efforts of a number of
the women students of the University
the fruit peddler, who has his stand
at the corner of the Quad, has been
enabled to start in business again. A
number of the young women living
near the bookstore learned that the
fruit man was in debt, owing to hav
ing been sick in the hospital. Without
his knowledge they took up a sub
scription to pay his bills and restock
his wagon. Through their efforts and
the generosity of other women, the
sum collected amounted to about
twenty-seven dollars, which was more
than enough to put the man on his
feet again.
