# QUAD COPY COMPLETE
## COMPOSITION AND ACTUAL PRINT OF ANNUAL ALONE REMAINS. Magnificent, Colored Plates an Innovation in 1910 Year Book. 
### 
All material for the 1910 annual
has been placed in the hands of the
printers, and the composition and ac
tual printing is all that remains to be
done. An unavoidable delay has been
caused by the inability of the cut
makers to complete their work at the
stipulated time. This will materially
interfere with the plans of the edi
tors to place the book on sale at an
early date, but unless further delays
are encountered, there is still a pos
sibility of the sale commencing May 1.
From present indications the 1910
Quad will contain some of the clever
est art work that has ever appeared in
any of the former college publications.
A large number of the local artists
have submitted many excellent and
clever productions which will be used
throughout the book. No pains have
been spared to add artistic touches
to the various illustrations. The pub
lishers are fortunate in having se
cured well made cuts which will
greatly add to the excellent appear
ance of the book. The half tones
are tastefully decorated with artistic
borders.
A long intended innovation has been
carried out by the publishers in the
form of full-page three and four col
ored illustrations. Owing to the ex
cellent workmanship these illustra
trations alone will represent an out
lay of some hundreds of dollars.
A second innovation will be found
in the addition of a new section to be
known as the "Women's Department."
Under this head will be bound the
various women's organizations as well
as a short resume of women's ath
letics.
The literary department will be not
able for the contributions of some well
known alumni, among whom are Wal
lace Irwin, ex '00, and Ike Russell,
'03. Both of these contributors are
at present members of the staff of
Collier's Weekly. These stories will
be concerned with incidents of Stan
ford history aroung which traditions
have been built.
The Josh Section will be unique in
respect to the notable absence of fac
ulty joshes. However, the editors have
amply made up in other directions.
Throughout the department will be
found interesting reproductions of ac
tual photographs from life.
