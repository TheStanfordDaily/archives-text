# FAVORS CHICAGO TRIP
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SANCTION PLAN OF TRACK TEAM. Money for Eastern Journey Largely Guaranteed.â€”No Collections from Student Body Necessary. 
### 
The Executive Committee last night
registered its approval of ilie plan to
again enter a picked track team in
the Conference Meet to be held at
Chicago. However, there are still sev
eral contingencies upon which the pro
posed trip depends. The consent ol'
the University authorities must be ob
tained and a sufficient amount of
money subscribed before any definite
steps can be taken in the matter.
Manager Stewart has already received
guaranties of sums aggregating $1,100
from institutions located along the
route to Chicago for meets with their
teams. Last year such dual competi
tionc were held with the Universities
of Utah and Colorado. About $1,000
additional will be necessary before a
team can be sent to the big Chicago
meet. The Executive Committee de
cided that no contributions should be
solicited from members of the Student
Body as was done a year ago. Several
prominent alumni have volunteered to
seek financial suport from the grad
uates, and it is probable that a large
enough fund will be realized from this
and one or two other outside sources
to assure the success of the present,
plans.
A special committee composed of F.

make all necessary arrangements for
the Intercollegiate Chess matches to

fornia team on Friday evening.
Business Manager Glendenning of
the Daily Palo Alto submitted a state
ment fo the financial condition of that
publication up to and including April
1, and an auditing committee was
named to examine the accounts.
A communication was read from
President Kuma, Stanford, '03, of the
Japanese Organization of America, re
questing that Stanford entertain a
number of Japanese who are serving
on two Nipponese training ships which
are soon to arrive in San Francisco.
R. B. Wheeler, '11, B. L. Gregg, '09,
and W. S. Porter, '11, were constituted
a committee of three to investigate the
feasibility of complying with Kuma's
suggestion.
