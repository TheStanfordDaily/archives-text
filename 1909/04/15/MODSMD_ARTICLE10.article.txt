To-day T. A. Rickard, editor of the
"Mining and Scientific Press," gave an
exceedingly polished lecture before the
mining men on the subject of "Mine
Valuations." The speaker told of the
best methods of ore sampling, and
the precautions to be taken in figur
ing assayed returns when estimating
mines. Also the care to be taken
against "salting" of mines, which
though infrequent and sometimes
unintentional, must be guarded
