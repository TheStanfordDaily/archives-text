This week will see the determina
tion of six intercollegiate events and
in the game to-morrow men will have
in the game to-morrow the base ball
men will have the opportunity
to inaugurate the season success
fully. We believe that the var
sity nine is in a position to win
the series. That the first two games
have not been up to the expected
standard is attributable to a slump
such has seldom been experienced at
the conclusion of the season. Indi
cations now point, however, that this
period of poor playing has been passed
over.
The team should have the support
of the bleachers to-morrow in no less
degree than on Saturday. The game
will be completed to-morrow in suf
ficient time to allow any who may de
sire to leave for San Francisco.
Our attention has been called to
the excellent spirit manifested by the
contestants in the preliminary boxing
bouts held recently in Encina Gym
nasium. Instructor Maloney has re
marked of this expression of the true
spirit of the University and it was
evident to all who witnessed the ini
tial tournament that while the boxers
were eager to be accorded a win, no
infringement of the rigid rules oc
curred.
We have at hand a communication
from I). H. Clift, '07, in which lie
requests that we make known cer
tain facts to the Student Body rela
tive to the changes made in the manu
script of the Junior Opera. "In Tan
giers." His statement is to the ef
fect that the book of the opera as ori
ginally submitted contained no por
tion of the lines of any other produc
tion, but that the Coach of the opera
persuaded the Junior Opera Commit
tee to make alterations.
We believe that the pro and con
of the matter has been amply ex- j
ploited by our contemporaries and that j
further discussion can only result in !
personalities.
