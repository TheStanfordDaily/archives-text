# Dr. Jordan Issues New Book.
## 
### 
In a very unique and interesting
manner, Dr. Jordan has recently ex
pressed his opposition to protection
ism through the medium of a timely
little book entitled "The Fate of Icio
dorum." The greater part of the ma
terial which is incorporated under this
title was printed for the Popular
Monthly in August, 18SS, and was at
that time for the most part pro
phetic in its nature. In this last edi
tion the writer has appended several
amendments to the text and notes
illustrative of "the fulfilment of the
prophecy." Dr. Jordan's arguments
against the protective tariff are given
in his predictions as to the disturbed
condition of a small town in France,
resulting from the adoption of this
form of revenue.
The author places especial empha
sis upon the evil results of over pro
duction to the laborer and the manu
facturer and shows how such a condi
tion is so frequently the outcome of
protectionism. Another important
point which he makes against such
a form of income is that often those
products which are not protected are
neglected and that high prices are the
consequence.
A good proposition of lively humor
adds a great deal to the enjoyment of
the book.
