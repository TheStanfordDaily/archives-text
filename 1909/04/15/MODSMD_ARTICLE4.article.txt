# RIVAL NINES IN FINAL STRUGGLE TOMORROW
## Varsity Will Meet Blue and Gold Batsmen in Deciding Game of Series on Old Diamond at 2:30. 
### 
The final act in the 190!) baseball
season will take place to-morrow
afternoon on the old Varsity diamond
when the nines representing the Uni
versity of California and Stanford are
to strive for supremacy in the national
sport. Twice already have these two
nines met with the result that the
question of final superiority still re
main unsettled. Each has won one
game, the Californians being victori
ous In the opening contest by a 5-3
score and the Cardinal easily gaining
the long end of a 13-7 score on the
second occasion. The third and de
ciding game is scheduled to commence
at 2:30. Uupire Nealon will probably
again preside with the indicator.
Judging from past performances and
the personnel of the two aggregations,
the outcome of to-morrow's game
should be a triumph for the Cardinal.
It is true that the optimistic calcula
tions of Stanford adherents suffered
an upset when the initial match oc
curred; yet this reverse may be as
cribed to a sudden slump into which
the Stanford players suddenly dropped

and the last few practices, together
with the recent defeat of the crack
Santa Clarans, indicate a return to
winning form. Every man on the team
in now playing his position in most
encouraging style. Theile, too, has
fully recovered the control and variety
of curves that have bafiled Blue and
Gold batsmen through three seasons.
With a consistent array of batters, a
reliable outfield and infield and a
strong battery, Stanford supporters
have reason to feel confident on the
eve of the crucial game.
The strength of the California line
up, on the other hand, must not be
wholly underestimated. Tt contains a
fairly dependable list of fielders and
an uncertain battery.
Manager Stewart has placed the dia
mond in the best possible shape for
the game and the fielders will not be
hampered by the ruts that have re
cently dotted the field.
No changes have been announced in
the line-ups, but there is a liltlihood
that substitutes will he given an op
portunity to participate.
