# VARSITY MEN INJURED.
## Chances of Victory Lessened.â€”Gardiner Suffers Break-Down and Worthington Injures Foot. 
### 
Last night brought more misfortune
to the Varsity track team which may
lessen the chance for a cardinal vic
tory on Saturday. R. S. Worthington,
'12, the two-miler had his foot run
over by a baggage truck at the
Southern Pacific depot, and while the
injury is not very serious it may prove
a handicap to him in his gruelling
event.
Out of the seven Varsity entries
for the sprints, there are but three
left in first-class condition. W. H.
Gardner, '09, sustained what appears
to be a break-down while running a
trial heat last night, and P. K. Pome
roy, '11, is suffering from an attack
of tonsilitis. J. R. Holman has ap
parently recovered from his break
down of a few weeks ago, but it is
a question whether he will be able
to stand the strain of the short
dashes.
The men otherwise are in a first
class condition with the exception of
Captain Horton, who strained a liga
ment in his leg while training yes
terday. This will probably keep Hor
ton out of the high hurdles.
