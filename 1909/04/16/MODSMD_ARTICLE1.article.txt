# CALIFORNIA WINS IN SEVENTEENTH
## 1909 SERIES IS LOST SENSATIONAL GAME ENDS IN SCORE OF 4-3. College Baseball Record Established In Closest Contest In History of Rival Universities. 
### 
After a nerve-racking contest of
seventeen innings, Stanford was
forced to relinquish honors in the
third and deciding game of the inter
collegiate series to California this
afternoon, 4-3. This creates a record
of the longest intercollegiate game in
the United States, while it required
three exciting hours to complete it.
The tie score began in the fourth in
ning, after which the game went along
until the seventeenth, almost every
inning seeing runners on bases, and a
likely end to the game. Hits were
well scattered and this accounts part
ly for the length of the match. Theile,
the cardinal pitcher, displayed un
varying good form, allowing but eight
hits in the seventeen innings. Forker,
the opposing box man, gave the Car
dinals thirteen hits, and showed up
well in the strikeout column.
By all odds the most brilliant player
in the field during the afternoon was
Tallant, the Cardinal left-fielder.
Time and again hits were snatched
from the California batters by his
speed and judgment.
The game in details follows:
The second inning saw California's
first tally. Steel, after his two pre
decessors on the list had struck out,
knocked one of the three three-base
hits of the game. He scord on Anth
ony's safe hit. Score, 1-0.
The third proved another red-letter
inning for the Blue and Gold. With
one out, White hit a low fly to
right, where it slipped through Gan
ong's fingers, and was lost in the
thick grass. The play lasted long
enough for White to score. Smith hit
in turn and got to second on Scott's
error. He scored on Allen's hit. Score,
3-0.
The fourth gave Stanford a tie
score, and a chance to win. Ganong
and Mitchell walked, Ganong stole
second, and both scored on Scott's
beautiful three-bagger to right, which
White, the fielder, failed to see until
it struck. Scott scored on Cadwalder's
hit.
The winning came on a hit and a
man hit by a pitched ball. Brady hit,
was advanced to second when Steel
was hit by the pitcher, and scored on
a squeeze play, Stoner bunting. Final
score,—Stanford. 3; California, 4.

The second inning saw California's
first tally. Steel, after his two pre
decessors on the list had struck out,
knocked one of the three three-base
hits of the game. He scord on Anth
ony's safe hit. Score, 1-0.
The third proved another red-letter
inning for the Blue and Gold. With
one out, White hit a low fly to
right, where it slipped through Gan
ong's fingers, and was lost in the
thick grass. The play lasted long
enough for White to score. Smith hit
in turn and got to second on Scott's
error. He scored on Allen's hit. Score,
3-0.
The fourth gave Stanford a tie
score, and a chance to win. Ganong
and Mitchell walked, Ganong stole
second, and both scored on Scott's
beautiful three-bagger to right, which
White, the fielder, failed to see until
it struck. Scott scored on Cadwalder's
hit.
The winning came on a hit and a
man hit by a pitched ball. Brady hit,
was advanced to second when Steel
was hit by the pitcher, and scored on
a squeeze play, Stoner bunting. Final
score,—Stanford. 3; California, 4.

After a nerve-racking contest of
seventeen innings, Stanford was
forced to relinquish honors in the
third and deciding game of the inter
collegiate series to California this
afternoon, 4-3. This creates a record
of the longest intercollegiate game in
the United States, while it required
three exciting hours to complete it.
The tie score began in the fourth in
ning, after which the game went along
until the seventeenth, almost every
inning seeing runners on bases, and a
likely end to the game. Hits were
well scattered and this accounts part
ly for the length of the match. Theile,
the cardinal pitcher, displayed un
varying good form, allowing but eight
hits in the seventeen innings. Forker,
the opposing box man, gave the Car
dinals thirteen hits, and showed up
well in the strikeout column.
By all odds the most brilliant player
in the field during the afternoon was
Tallant, the Cardinal left-fielder.
Time and again hits were snatched
from the California batters by his
speed and judgment.
