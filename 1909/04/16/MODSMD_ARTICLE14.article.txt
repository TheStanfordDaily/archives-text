## HOLT ADVOCATES WOULD PEACE IN STRONG SPEECH. Editor of "Independent" Magazine Talks at Assembly On Hague Conference and National Arbitration. 
### 
Hamilton Holt, well known as the
editor of the Independent Magazine
and as a publicist, delivered a strong
address at this morning's Assembly,
taking as his topic, "The Peace Alove
ment and the Hague Conference."
Holt's intimate knowledge of the in
side of international politics, his flu
ency and witty style of address make
his speech one of the most interest
ing of the year.
The speaker first pointed out the
apparent paradox between a national
peace movement and the fact that the
nations are continually increasing
their armament and said that peace
can only come through a federation
of the nations, and until that time
no nation would disarm.
"The world," said Holt, "has learned
to substitute law for war within the
nation but in the international realm
the only way for a nation to secure
its rights is by force and that means
war. But we are coming to the end
of the war era and are at the begin
ning of the law era. The two eras
necessarily impinge on each other.
We never can have universal peace
until the world is politically organized
and the time is now ripe for such an
organization. In fact a long step has
already been taken in that direction.
Although such a union of the nations
may seem to some a Utopian dream,
yet as a matter of fact, it does at this
very moment exist in the Hague Court
which is the germ of a Supreme Court
of the world and in the recurrence of
the Hague Conference which is the
germ of the world legislature."
