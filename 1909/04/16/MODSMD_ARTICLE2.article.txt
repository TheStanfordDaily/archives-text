# WELL BALANCED TRIO
## CARDINAL DEBATORS COMPRISE STRONG TEAM. Intercollegiate Contest to Be Held in Harmon Gymnasium To-morrow Evening. 
### 
Tomorrow evening the team that is
to represent Stanford in the annual
intercollegiate debate will meet the
University of California speakers in
Harmon Gymnasium at 8 o'clock.
Stanford goes into this contest with
but one veteran debator on her team,
but the fact that the other two are
reliable in every respect, as has been
manifest by the work done by them in
debating circles here in the past, gives
an assurance of a strong representa
tion for the Cardinal.
A. C. Steele, '09, who now makes
an intercollegiate debating team for
the first time, is the most forceful
speaker upon the team, and his debat
ing is always marked by a directness
of style that is a valuable attribute to
a debator. Steele is president of Eu
phronia Debating Society and is a
member of the Phi Alpha Tau debat
ing fraternity. He is a member of
the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and
registers in Law from Pasadena.
As the only man upon the trio who
has taken part in a debate of inter
collegiate importance, G. F. Morgan,
'10, will supply the experience and
the weight that a former appearance
in a contest of this character carries
with it. He posseses a remarkable
command of words, while his ability
to logically arrange the material
handled by him in his speech, will
make his presence a valuable asset
for the team on Saturday night. Mor
gan has taken a foremost part in be
bating work for the past year and
is a member of both Nestoria Literary
Society and the Phi Alpha Tau debat
ing fraternity. Morgan is a member
of the Hammer and Coffin Society,' re
gistering from Los Angeles in the
English department.
P. J. Batkin, '10, as the third mem
ber of the team, has manifested his
debating ability in the past, especi
ally in applying a directness to his
delivery that is effective, while the
logic employed in his speech is always
to bo relied upon. Batkin is a member
of Euphronia Debating Society, and is
enrolled as a Phi Alpha Tau, while he
also holds membership in the Delta
Chi law fraternity. Batkin is a mem
ber of Encina Club, registering in the
Prelegal department of the Law School
