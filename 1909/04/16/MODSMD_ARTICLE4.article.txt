# CREWS READY TO RACE
## VARSITY AND FRESHMAN EIGHTS STRONG THIS YEAR. Regatta to Take Place on Oakland Estuary To-morrow Morning at 10:15 Sharp. 
### 
The fifth annual intercollegiate re
gatta, between the eights of the Uni
will take place on the Oakland Es
tuary to-morrow morning at 10:15
sharp.
After three months of hard and
consistent training the Varsity and
Freshman crews are ready for one
of the most spectacular contests that
has ever been witnessed on the Pacific
Coast in rowing circles. Both of the
Cardinal crews are in the pink of
condition, and while the varsity that
will row against the Blue and Gold is,
no doubt, at least twenty per cent
better than last year's eight, the Cal
ifornia crew is perhaps the best that
has ever represented the State Institu
tion.
The crews have been on theesturay
the last few days getting accustomed
to the course and doing light work
preliminary to to-morrow's races.
Stanford's style of rowing will be the
same as it has been in the past, while
the California's oarsmen will use the
stroke that is rowed at Cornell. New
oars have been received from the East,
where they were made under the di
rections of Coach Murphy. They are
narrower than the oars that will be
used by our opponents, but they can
be drawn through, the water faster
and send the boat along at about the
same velocity. Coach Murphy is very
much pleased with the condition of the
men and thinks we have a good chance
to win.
R. H. Reynolds, '10, who captains
the varsity is one of the most ex
perienced men in the boat and the
only man who rowed on last year's
eight. He has had the benefit of two
years' training under Coach Murphy
and is a strong representative of the
latter's style of rowing. Reynolds
pulls No. 2 in the boat, where he is
in a good position to watch the men
and encourage them during the race
He has succeeded admirably in keep
ing his men together during the sea
son and the crew have every confider.cn
in him. He is a member of the Zetf>
Psi Fraternity.
J. W. Fitting, 'JO. holds perhaps
the most important position in
the eight. He is one of the best
strokes ever trained by Murphy at
Stanford, and Hie coach and men have
perfect confidence in his ability to
follow or lead any crew. He has all
the esentials of a good stroke and can
be depended upon to increase the num
ber of strokes per minute at any time.
Fitting occupied Ibis same position
on his freshman crew and rowed with
the varsity at Washington. He is a
member of the Encina Club.
J. Huston, '10, made his varsity "S"
in his freshman year when he rowed
on the varsity eight. He is especially
valuable in a close race, where hard
and fast work is necessary. He will
occupy seat No. 7.
