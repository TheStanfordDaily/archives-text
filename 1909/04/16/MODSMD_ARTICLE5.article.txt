# MEET WILL BE CLOSE
## EXPECTS HARD FIGHT TO SECURE A VARSITY TRACK VICTORY. Field Events to Begin at 2 O'clock, Track Events at 2:30.â€”All Injured Men Will Enter. 
### 
To-morrow afternoon on California
field will be reached the culmination
of a season's hard and consistent work
by the varsity track men. The team
will enter the meet under the handi
cap of having several men suffering
from injuries received during the last
few days, although none of the men
should be prevented from competing.
Trainer Moulton and Captain Hor
ton are well satisfied with the condi
tion of the men and look forward to a
Cardinal victory. In speaking of the
contest on Saturday Moulton said, "I
think it will be a close meet, but we
have a fighting chance and that is all
we want." Captain Horton also stated
his belief in the ability of the team
to win though it would require the
best efforts of the men.
The meet should start off with a
victory for Stanford in the first event,
the mile run. It looks like Hemphill
or Bradford wil fight it out for first
place as both of these men are
stronger than Smith of California. Mc-
Gregor and Fletcher should also make
a strong fight in this race for some
points. Any one of this quartet may
get first place.
Coleman, Cline, and Smitherum will
be the mainstays in the dashes as the
other sprinters are not in the best of
condition. Coleman with his records
of 10.1 in the hundred and 22.3 in the
longer distance is likely to capture
first place in one; possibly in both.
Cline and Smitherum are both consist
ent runners and should aid in the
point winning.
The quarter with Wyman and Miller
entered will in all probability be the
fastest race of the day as both are
capable of traveling the distance under
"50," if pressed. Dowd will have his
work cut out for him if he intends
to defeat Miller or Johnston in the
half and this race looks like it will add
six points at least to the Stanford
score. Hemphill, if he is not too tired
from the mile, will make a strong
fight for a place in this race also, as
he is good for very close to even time.
Worthington and Newman will prob
ably finish the two-mile run in the
order named, with Adams and Sweet
not far behind. Captain Horton will
not run in the high hurdlers but will
save himself for the low hurdles and
shot-put. The Cardinal hurdlers will
have a hard proposition in the 120-
yard event with such a strong trio as
Cowles, Johns, and Edwards entered.
Morris is about the only Stanford en
try traveling over the sticks fast
enough to place with this speedy
bunch, although I'easlee and Coonradt
are running well. In the longer race
Morris will be aided by Captain Hor
ton, who should figure in the points
if the injury to his leg does not prove
too much of a hindrance. In practise
at Berkeley Morris has shown fine
form in getting round the turn over
the hurdles and is counted on for
points in this event.
Tn the field events the team is not
well balanced and while unusually
strong in some events is weak in
others. Ci'awford and Wooley should
capture the majority of points in the
hammer while Horton and Crawford
should do the same in the shot-put.
Lee Scott is counted on to take a
place from the strong Berkeley group
of vaulters while Peake may also
tally. Stolz is a consistent broad
jumper and will come close to taking
first place in the meet. Poor may be
counted on for a point in the high
jump although Bull has been doing
around six l'eet. this year. If the out
come of the meet depends on the
relay race the victory will undoubt
edly be with Stanford, for, with a list
of such strong runners to pick from
as Soltz, Roth, Coonan, Wyman, Miller,
Morris, and Coleman the event can
hardly be lost.
The team will leave on the 9:31
train to-morrow morning, arriving in
Berkeley about noon. The field events
will start at 2 o'clock promptly, the
track events a half hour afterwards
on the California track.

edly be with Stanford, for, with a list
of such strong runners to pick from
as Soltz, Roth, Coonan, Wyman, Miller,
Morris, and Coleman the event can
hardly be lost.
The team will leave on the 9:31
train to-morrow morning, arriving in
Berkeley about noon. The field events
will start at 2 o'clock promptly, the
track events a half hour afterwards
on the California track.
To-morrow afternoon on California
field will be reached the culmination
of a season's hard and consistent work
by the varsity track men. The team
will enter the meet under the handi
cap of having several men suffering
from injuries received during the last
few days, although none of the men
should be prevented from competing.
Trainer Moulton and Captain Hor
ton are well satisfied with the condi
tion of the men and look forward to a
Cardinal victory. In speaking of the
contest on Saturday Moulton said, "I
think it will be a close meet, but we
have a fighting chance and that is all
we want." Captain Horton also stated
his belief in the ability of the team
to win though it would require the
best efforts of the men.
The meet should start off with a
victory for Stanford in the first event,
the mile run. It looks like Hemphill
or Bradford wil fight it out for first
place as both of these men are
stronger than Smith of California. Mc-
Gregor and Fletcher should also make
a strong fight in this race for some
points. Any one of this quartet may
get first place.
Coleman, Cline, and Smitherum will
be the mainstays in the dashes as the
other sprinters are not in the best of
condition. Coleman with his records
of 10.1 in the hundred and 22.3 in the
longer distance is likely to capture
first place in one; possibly in both.
Cline and Smitherum are both consist
ent runners and should aid in the
point winning.
The quarter with Wyman and Miller
entered will in all probability be the
fastest race of the day as both are
capable of traveling the distance under
"50," if pressed. Dowd will have his
work cut out for him if he intends
to defeat Miller or Johnston in the
half and this race looks like it will add
six points at least to the Stanford
score. Hemphill, if he is not too tired
from the mile, will make a strong
fight for a place in this race also, as
he is good for very close to even time.
Worthington and Newman will prob
ably finish the two-mile run in the
order named, with Adams and Sweet
not far behind. Captain Horton will
not run in the high hurdlers but will
save himself for the low hurdles and
shot-put. The Cardinal hurdlers will
have a hard proposition in the 120-
yard event with such a strong trio as
Cowles, Johns, and Edwards entered.
Morris is about the only Stanford en
try traveling over the sticks fast
enough to place with this speedy
bunch, although I'easlee and Coonradt
are running well. In the longer race
Morris will be aided by Captain Hor
ton, who should figure in the points
if the injury to his leg does not prove
too much of a hindrance. In practise
at Berkeley Morris has shown fine
form in getting round the turn over
the hurdles and is counted on for
points in this event.
Tn the field events the team is not
well balanced and while unusually
strong in some events is weak in
others. Ci'awford and Wooley should
capture the majority of points in the
hammer while Horton and Crawford
should do the same in the shot-put.
Lee Scott is counted on to take a
place from the strong Berkeley group
of vaulters while Peake may also
tally. Stolz is a consistent broad
jumper and will come close to taking
first place in the meet. Poor may be
counted on for a point in the high
jump although Bull has been doing
around six l'eet. this year. If the out
come of the meet depends on the
relay race the victory will undoubt
edly be with Stanford, for, with a list
of such strong runners to pick from
as Soltz, Roth, Coonan, Wyman, Miller,
Morris, and Coleman the event can
hardly be lost.
