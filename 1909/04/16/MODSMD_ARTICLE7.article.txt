Intercollegiate supremacy for this
year will be settled in four major ac
tivities to-morrow morning, afternoon
and evening when the Universities
meet in the regatta, tennis tourna
ment, field day and debate. Stanford
has every reason to believe that a
victory will be returned to the Cardi
nal in each of these events. Tn no
way have the representatives of the
University of California an advantage
that a hard fight upon the part of
our representatives will not overcome.
This is all that any Stanford man asks.
To the crew we offer the best wishes
of the Student Body and feel sure that
their efforts during the long season
have been appreciated. The tennis
men will be watched against two of the
best players on the Coast but we be
lieve that the representatives of Stan
ford will lie equal to the task. The
track team has been beset with dif
ficulties from the start but is now one
of the strongest that has ever been
turned out. The debaters will com
plete the activities of the day and we
are confident that Stanford will be
again returned a winner in this event.
That the Student Body will attend
in large and back the teams to vic
tory, goes without saying. It has been
so in the past and we feel sure that to
morrow will not be any exception, es
pecially as the spirit of the bleachers
will mean points.
