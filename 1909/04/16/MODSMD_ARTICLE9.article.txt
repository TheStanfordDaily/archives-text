# TENNIS TEAM IN GOOD FORM.
## Bright Outlok for a Victory in Intercollegiate Tournament Tomorrow. 
### 
Stanford's chances for victory in
the tennis tournament with the Uni
versity of California to-morrow morn
ing are bright, judging from the per
sonnel of the Cardinal team. The
showing made by this team at the
Ojai Valley tournament, where it was
matched against some of the champion
players of the country, argues well
for some close matches to-morrow.
Although the California representa
tives are probably the two best players
on the Coast, it is expected that the
Stanford team will spring a surpries
on them in the doubles.
H. J. Gowan, '09, who captained the
last year players, will succeed him
self as leader of the team this year.
Gowan lias been first singles man for
three years and is a member of the
champion doubles team in the inter
class tournament. He plays a strong
speedy game, being exceptionally re
liable on his serve.
E. Jordan, Jr., will be the second
man on the doubles team. This is
the first year that he has been ele
gible to compete, being a transfer from
the University of Sidney. A valuable
asset is his tournament experience.
H. S. Morgan, '12, who is likely to
be chosen a member of the singles
has shown himself to be a strong,
heady, player, both in the local
and Ojai Valley Tournaments. Mor
gan is the inter—class champion and
winner of the first handicap tourna
ment last semester.
