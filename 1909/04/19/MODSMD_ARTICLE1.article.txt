That the outcome of the sixteenth
annual track and field meet between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia would be a Cardinal victory
was not an assured fact until the last
event of the day, the pole-vault, had
had been decided. But when the game,
though injured Scott made his final
and successful vault, the score stood
6G for Stanford as against 56 for Cali
fornia, and thus concluded perhaps
the most thrilling, exciting and meri
torious meet in the history of Pacific
Coast athletics. It was a fight from
the outset and the winner was the
best team, —best by a narrow margin,
it is true, but, after all, really best.
Four intercollegiate records were
broken, all by Stanford men, and two
were equalled. Wyman negotiated the
quarter in 50:1, Miller completed the
half in 1:58:2, while Newman cap
tured the two-mile in 10:09. The
quartet of new marks was completed
by the Cardinal relay team of five
men who covered the mile in 3:18.
Captain Cowles, of the Blue and Gold
team, tied his record of 15:4 in the
high hurdles, and Coleman placed him
self on an equal footing with Hamil
ton of Stanford and Cadogan of Cali
fornia when be ran the 220 in the
clever time of 22:3.
Miller, Crawford and Coleman were
the large point winners for Stanford,
and beyond all doubt Miller was the
bright particular star of the meet. He
sides winning the 800 as he pleased in
remarkable time, he practically ran
a dead beat with Wyman in the record
breaking quarter, and then, merely to
demonstrate that lie was not the
least bit tired he gained in his relay
lap almost fifteen yards on Cheney,
one of California's fastest men over
the 352-yard course. Crawford had
little difficulty in annexing both (lie
weight events in such a manner as
to make him an extremely dangerous
man at Hie Conference Meet, should
Stanford journey to Chicago again
this summer. Coleman added ten
points to the score by two first places
in the snrints.
