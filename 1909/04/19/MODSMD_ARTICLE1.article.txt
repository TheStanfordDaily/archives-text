That the outcome of the sixteenth
annual track and field meet between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia would be a Cardinal victory
was not an assured fact until the last
event of the day, the pole-vault, had
had been decided. But when the game,
though injured Scott made his final
and successful vault, the score stood
6G for Stanford as against 56 for Cali
fornia, and thus concluded perhaps
the most thrilling, exciting and meri
torious meet in the history of Pacific
Coast athletics. It was a fight from
the outset and the winner was the
best team, —best by a narrow margin,
it is true, but, after all, really best.
Four intercollegiate records were
broken, all by Stanford men, and two
were equalled. Wyman negotiated the
quarter in 50:1, Miller completed the
half in 1:58:2, while Newman cap
tured the two-mile in 10:09. The
quartet of new marks was completed
by the Cardinal relay team of five
men who covered the mile in 3:18.
Captain Cowles, of the Blue and Gold
team, tied his record of 15:4 in the
high hurdles, and Coleman placed him
self on an equal footing with Hamil
ton of Stanford and Cadogan of Cali
fornia when be ran the 220 in the
clever time of 22:3.
Miller, Crawford and Coleman were
the large point winners for Stanford,
and beyond all doubt Miller was the
bright particular star of the meet. He
sides winning the 800 as he pleased in
remarkable time, he practically ran
a dead beat with Wyman in the record
breaking quarter, and then, merely to
demonstrate that lie was not the
least bit tired he gained in his relay
lap almost fifteen yards on Cheney,
one of California's fastest men over
the 352-yard course. Crawford had
little difficulty in annexing both (lie
weight events in such a manner as
to make him an extremely dangerous
man at Hie Conference Meet, should
Stanford journey to Chicago again
this summer. Coleman added ten
points to the score by two first places
in the snrints.

The track events began with a blot
ter disappointment for the Cardinal

supporters, when Smith, of California,
won the mile. Of the Stanford rnilers,
McGregor, who took second place, was
the only one to run his race.
Of the six men who qualified for
the finals of the hundred, Stanford
liad but two: Coleman and Cline.
Holman started in his heat, but the
injury to his leg which he received
in the interclass meet forced him to
stop after covering but 25 or 30 yards.
Stanford's prospects received a sec
ond severe set-back when California
took tiie entire nine points in the 120-
yard hurdles. But the figures of the
prophets were borne out by the re
sults of the quarter. California en
deavored to make VVyman defeat him
self by putting in the race a 100-yard
man to set a terrific pace. Wyman,
however, refused to be disconcerted,
and in a well-judged race just won
from Miller.
The Cardinal made up for the high
hurdles by taking three places in the
two mile. During the first mile Sweet
was the pace-maker, and he was suc
ceeded by Boydsou. Soon, however,
VVorthington took the lead and held
the first position until the backet retch
of the final lap, when Newman moved
up. The two fought the battle all
tlie way, Newman just breaking the
tape a scant lew inches in front of
Worthington. Sweet was third.
'i he Blue and Gold made it 18 points
in the hurdles by finishing one, two,
three over the low flights, while Cole
man captured his second race in the
220 dash, Cline being third.
In the 880 Miller made no attempt
to take the lead until the last 120
yards. He then easily passed the
pace-makers and had no trouble in
winning by approximately six yards.
The most sensational race of the day
was the relay. Stanford was lead
ing in the meet 56 to 52, and it was
evident that the relay would he a most
important factor in determining the
result. The first three Cardinal run
ners. Sioiz, Roth and Coonan, gradu
ally fell behind, until Cheney, the
fourth California man, started with
an advantage of 15 or 20 yards over
Miller, who by maintaining a heart
breaking pace the entire lap reduced
the gap to five yards. Wyman caught
Butler after completing little more
than 100 yards and, slowly taking the
lead, won with some five yards to
spare.
Stanford now had 01 points, and the
pole-vault alone remaining, the worst
the Cardinal could get was a tie. A
single point or fraction thereof would
return them victorious. What would
ihe crippled Scott be able to do? The
crippled Scott not only placed, but
won—both Ihe pole-vault and the field
meet.
in the jumps, Stanford, as fore
casted. scored but little. Stolz was
second in the broad and Poor was
third in the high. The Cardinal, how
ever. procured 16 of the 18 points in
the weights. Besides Crawford's ex
cellent work, Captain Morton and
Wool ley ench took a second.
Holman's misfortune was not the
only piece of ill-luck suffered by
Stanford during the afternoon. While
running a heat in ihe 220 hurdles
Horton broke down.
Over 5,000 people witnessed the
races and field events, a banner crowd
in the history of intercollegiate meets.
Mad yelling and organized rooting vied
one with the other the tremendous
noise not ceasing for an instant dur
ing the running of the highly impor
tant relay.
The Cardinal won not only on the

superior excellence of her material,
but also on the superb condition of
her men. In turning out a victorious
team "Dad" Moulton accomplished
that which three months ago appeared
seemingly impossible.
