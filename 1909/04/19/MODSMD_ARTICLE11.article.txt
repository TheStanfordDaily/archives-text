# DEFEATED IN DEBATE
## STANFORD SPEAKERS LOSE TO BLUE AND GOLD. Interesting Contest Results in Victory for Representatives of University of California. 
### 
In an exceedingly interesting de
bate, the representatives of the Uni
versity of California secured a decision
over the defenders of the Cardinal last
Saturday evening, in Harmon Gymna
sium. The relative merits of the two
teams were upon opposite grounds,
those of the Stanford trio being the
force and character in the argument
advanced by them, while the home
team showed its ability more in the
presentation of their material and the
smoothness with which their talks
were advanced.
"Resolved, That our legislation
should be shaped toward the gradual
abandonment of the protective tariff,"
was the subject discussed, Stanford
upholding the negative of the ques
tion. Upon their side of the question
the Blue and Gold representatives
composed of J. A. D. Brookinan, '10,
Chauncy Eldridge, '11, and N. B.
Drury, '12, presented the protective
tariff as a benefit which has grown
into an evil and qualified the benefits
that would accrue to the nation in
the circumstances of its removal.
A. C. Stelle, '09, G. F. Morgan. '10,
and P. J. Batkin, '10, who made up
the cardinal team, opposed the propo
sition as advanced in the question,
from a business standpoint, laying
stress particularly upon the effect
upon labor and the industries now de
pendent upon the maintenance of
tariff wall against foreign competition,
if it was withdrawn.
Bishop O'Connell, O. Iv. Cushing and
Jesse Li lien thai acted as the judges
for the debate.
