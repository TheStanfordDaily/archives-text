# VARSITY AND FRESHMAN EIGHTS WIN IN RACES
## Contests on Estuary Result in Victories for Stanford Crews.—Freshmen Lead Six Lengths at Finish. 
### 
The fifth annual intercollegiate re
! gatta resulted in a victory for both
j the varsity anil freshman crews. The
j varsity race did not have the exciting
; finish of previous years, owing to tae
j swamping of the California shell about
j a mile and a quarter from the finish
but the 19113 contest held this morning
j was decisive, the Stanford crew cross
ing the line a good six lengths ahead.
The first race of the regatta, the
varsity contest held Saturday morning
was terminated when the Stanford
] crew rowing an easy stroke but with
i the boat two-thirds filled with water
crossed the line while their opponents
were being rescued from the sinking
Berkeley shell.
This fiasco was due to the unex
pected bad turn in the weather which
rendered the water of the estuary
choppy and dangerous for the light
craft.
The race started shortly after 10:40
and both crews got away even, but
California had a slight lead in the first
few lengths and at the quarter mile
had a quarter of a length advantage
Here the Cardinal stroke was raised
to thirty-six and the Stanford boat
crept up and passed the Blue and Gold
shell. At the half-mile post Stanford
| had a length to the good and was
steadily drawing away. This contin
ued until the first mile was completed
when two full lengths of clear water
separated the crews.
It was at about this time, during
the race, that the rough water com
menced to bother the California men,
and their shell was starting to ship a
little of the water. California was
rowing without washboards, while

Stanford's shell was equipped with
canvas strips,
When about one and a quarter miks
from the finish, the Blue and Gold
crew foundered, leaving Stanford to
complete the course alone. At the
time the California men down the Car
dinal crew was leading about five
lengths or 300 feet.
A quarter of a mile from the finish
Stanford dropped the stroke down to
thirty-three per minute, as it was a
question whether the finish could be
negotiated. The boat finally crossed
the line, rowing thirty-two to the min
ute. The official time was 17 minutes
and 43 seconds.
It is the opinion of experts, who saw
the race, that the California crew was
far outclassed by the Stanford oars
men.
The conditioned victory was wres
ted from the Blue and Gold by the fol
lowing men: —Killian, bow; Rey
| nolds, No. 2, Wilde, No. 3; Day, No. 4;
j Chamberlain, No. 5; Bole, No. 6; Hus
;ton. No. 7; Fitting, stroke; and Guer
1 ena, coxswain.
The California crew was composed
of: Markwart, bow; Davis, No. 2; Dig
non, No. 3; Hardy, No. 4; Ashley, No.
5; Ball, No. 6; Davidson, No. 7; Rob
ertson, stroke; McSpadder, coxswain.
The Freshman race was rowed under
perfect conditions this morning. The
surface of t lie water was smooth and the
| weather warmer than on Saturday. At
the very start Stanford jumped into the
lead. To those who witnessed the race
; the Stanford shell seemed to go ahaad
at least six feet on the first stroke and
