Stanford has good reason to be
proud of the teams which competed
against the University of California
in the numerous intercollegiate con
tests of last week. While the record
for the year will not show a complete
sweep for the Cardinal, we believe
that in the splendid victories achieved
by the track team, oarsmen and the
Rugby fifteen we have our share of
the intercollegiate glory. We feel
that we express the wish of the Siu
deut Body when we extend our con
gratulations and praise to the coaches,
captains and men who have so credit
ably aided and represented the Car
dinal during the college year.
