We note with pleasure the uctive
steps taken toward the institution of
a "Stanford Union." The plans out
lined by the directors indicate that
every effort will be made to collect
sufficient funds to insure the building
of a suitable clubhouse on the cam
pus as soon as possible.
While the appointment of R. W.
Barrett, '04, former Graduate Manager,
to collect the funds should meet with
large returns, we believe that the
members of the Student Body can aid
also by notifying any alumni of their
acquaintance of the significance of
the proposed Union.
The value of such an institution is
too well realized here to need further
amplification, but its success will
largely depend upon the amount of
publicity it receives in the proper di
rection.
