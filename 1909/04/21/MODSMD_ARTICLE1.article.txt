# DUTIES ARE OUTLINED
## UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE TO OCCUPY IMPORTANT POSITION. Recent Gathering of Representatives Devoted to Explanation of Purposes. 
### 
At a recent meeting of the dele
gates to the University Conference it
was decided to make more explicit
the functions of this newly formed
organization and to this end the Pub
licity Committee drew up a general
outline of the plans of the organiza
tion and suggested several cases which
would naturally fall to the conference
to adjust. That the duties of the mem
bers of this Conference at the present
time appear to be rather vague and
will be determined more by precedent
when cases come up rather than by
any set formulae, was the decision
agreed upon by the Conference.
From the discussion resulting of
this last gathering of the Conference,
it was the opinion of the delegates
that the Conference is to be the official
organ through which the sentiments
and desires of the Student Body may
be communicated to the President of
the University and the different ad
ministrative committees of the Fac
ulty. Also, the Conference will meet
with the faculty for general discis
sion of the relations of the admiir::-
trative committees to the Student
Body. As an example of this function
of the Conference it was suggested
that questions concerning which 'he
Student. Affairs Committee, Business
Office, or Athletic Committee would be
involved could be taken up by
Conference.
Another activity open for the Con
ference is that of dealing with ques
tions of Student Body policy or affairs
which have no connection with the
faculty and interest the students
solely. In view of the fact that this
Conference is the first, organization
of the kind that has been truly rep
resentative it was decided that the aim
would naturally be to prevent the rise
of any misunderstanding and thus
eliminate crises. This duty was con
strued to be of such a nature as to
include such questions as the proper
conduct at intercollegiate games, cam
pus conduct and similar matters which
do not come under the scope of any of
the older organizations.
Particular stress was laid upon the
duties of the Student Advisory Com
mittee. Tt was the opinion that, this
committee will be the actual working
unit, of the Conference and will re
ceive all complaints that, are to be
referred to the Conference. The com
mittee will stand ready to deal with
all specific matters that members of
the community believe should be
brought to the attention of the proper
authorities. Such affairs as sidewalks,
the filling of Frenchman's Lake and
mitigating circumstances in cases of
discipline, will be properly understood
to be a portion of the duties of the
five constituting the sub-committee of
the Conference.
Aside from outlining these functions
of the Conference, nothing further was
transacted at the gathering.
