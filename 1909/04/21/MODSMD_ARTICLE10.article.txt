nual meet of the Interscholastic As
sociation, a word as to the entertain

of the Interscliolastic Association it
appears that the number of men who
will enter the meet, this year will be
larger than that of the previous con
tests. This means that a greater num
ber of secondary school athletes will
have to be entertained.
In finding places for the high school
visitors to stay during the days before
and after the meet some difficulty has
been met in the past and misunder
standings have arisen. As soon as
it can be determined how many ath
letes will be present and how many
must be taken care of by the various
organizations, ample accommodations
should he volunteered. We have 110
