# ROOSEVELT IS DUE TO-MORROW.
## Suddenly Curtails African Trip and Will Be Guest of Press Club on Quad. 
### 
Ex-president Theodore Roosevelt,
after consulting three Hottentot witch
doctors from Somaliland, decided some
time ago to abandon his African hunt
ing trip and come buck to the United
States. In order that his return may
cause no political flurry he will enter
the country by way of San Francisco
and proceed Eastward by degrees. He
is expected to arrive in the City early
to-morrow morning on the Japanese
steamer Ginseng Maru, now three days
overdue, but which was finally located
yesterday afternoon by means of the
new wireless telegraph service.
Because of his deep personal regard
for the Press Club, Mr. Roosevelt has
consented to visit the campus, to-mor
row morning, and will speak to the
students at various places on the
Quadrangle after each of the morning
classes, while at noon he will address
a large crowd of admirers from the
post-office steps. Here he will tell
of his thrilling experiences in the Af
rican hunting Held, and will sing a
Zulu war-song written especially for
him in Germany by Richard Strauss,
the famous composer of the opera
"Salome."
After much effort on the part of the
Press Club, Mr. Roosevelt was induced
to promise to bring with him his pet
lion, the famous Growlissimus VII,
which he subdued single-handed in
the jungles of the upper Zambezi
River. Growlissimus possesses almost
human intelligence and has been
taught to accompany his master in
song. The musical treat will be es
pecially inviting, and as Mr. Roosevelt
has promised to avoid political issues
and the suffragette movement, no one
should miss his great program of to
morrow morning.
