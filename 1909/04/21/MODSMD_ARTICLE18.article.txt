# WINS WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP.
## Miss F. Burrell, '10, Acquires Silver Cup as Result of Victory in Singles Finals. 
### 
Yesterday afternoon Miss F. Burrell,
'10, defeated Miss S. Dundy, '10, in
the finals of the women's singles cham
pionship tennis tournament. The Golf
Club upon disbanding, presented wo
men's tennis with their large silver
trophy cup and Miss Burrell has won
the right to have her name inscribed
upon it and to keep it for a year.
The score was 6-1, 6-1, but the
match was more even than this in
dicates. Miss Bundy and Miss Burrell
play an entirely different style of
game, the latter not using as scien
tific a play as her opponent. Her
game is characterized by "lobbing"
and her serve although sure is weak.
She uses few brilliant strokes, but re
lies upon steadiness and quickness.
Miss Bundy uses a good serve and
back and back-hand stroke, but was
entirely unable to cope with the game
of her opponent.
The match was characterized by few
brilliant plays and the tennis form
displayed was poor as a whole.
Miss Burrell is the captain of the
tennis squad this year and has done
much to arouse interest in the sport.
Although she has never played on an
intercollegiate team before, her work
is well known here. She is a member
of the Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority
and registers from Oakland.
