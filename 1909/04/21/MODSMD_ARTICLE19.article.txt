# WILL FENCE FOR MEDAL.
## Women Students to Strive for Foil and Mask Championship Saturday Morning. 
### 
The women's fencing matches to be
held for the championship medal, will
take place Saturday morning at Roble
Gymnasium at 9:o0.
Fourteen entries have been made
and there is much speculation as to
the outcome of the matches. The
women will draw for opponents Sat
urday and the affair will be conducted
in a similar manner to the tennis
championship series. The victor will
be forced to fence four bouts before
the finals.
The judges will be the two Kehnein
brothers of Palo Alto and Professor
Ware of the History Department. The
medal to be awarded is the gift of
Instructor Maloney of Encina Gym.
It is in the form of a silver watch
fob and was designed in Paris.
After these matches there will be
several exhibition fencing matches.
The two Kehrlein brothers will fence
and later Instructor Maloney and Mr.
Kehrlein will fence with duelling
swords. Maloney will then give an
exhibition of punching the bag, work
ing blindfolded.
This is the first time that such an
exhibition has been held here, and
there has been much interest mani
fested in it. All the women students,
faculty ladies and lady friends are in
vited to be present.
