# CODE NOW COMPLETED
## CONFERENCE OF FISHERY COMMISSIONERS ENDS SATISFACTORILY. Final List of Status Is Agreed upon. Commissioner Prince Leave for Canada. 
### 
Professor E. E. Prince, the Canadian
Commissioner on International Fish
eries, returned to Canada this after
noon in company with his private sec
retary and legal adviser. Prince ar
rived upon the campus one week ago
yesterday and since then has been
holding a private and formal confer
ence with Dr. Jordan, the United States
representative, concerning a proposed
code of fishery laws.
Each agent had already drawn up a
separate list of statutes based upon
investigations made last fall and the
purpose of the meeting which just
terminated was to satisfactorily agree
upon a final code. In merging the two
lists of laws it has been necessary
to make a few changes and amend
ments, but they are now in a pract
ically permanent form.
Upon his arrival in Canada, Com
missioner Prince will present the
fishery code to the Ministry there for
inspection. However any suggestions
or modifications which may be forth
coming must receive the approval of
Dr. Jordan before they can have any
effect upon the present list of statutes.
The new enactment will receive the
official signature of the Commission
ers about the middle of May and will
be sent on to President Taft early in
June. He will submit them to Cong
ress and if they are ratified by that
"body they will become permanent and
have jurisdiction over all fish found
within waters contiguous to the United
States and Canada.
Dr. Jordan will leave for the Great
Lakes about May IS, and will be met
there by Professor Prince. The Com
missioners will then traverse some of
the doubtful waters. This investiga
tion may necessitate the making of a
few slight amendments to the code,
but it will probably be presented to
Congress in very nearly its present
form.
