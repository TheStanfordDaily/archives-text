## Professor Huberich to Take Chair of H.L. Smith, at the University of Wisconsin, Who Comes Here. 
### 
Professor C. H. Huberich, of the
Law School, has been granted a leave
of absence from Stanford for the ses
sion of 1909-10 to accept a professor
ship in the College of Law at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin for that year.
His present position will be filled by
Professor Howard L. Smith, of the
University of Wisconsin.
Professor Smith is the senior pro
fessor of law at Wisconsin and is one
of the best known legal educators in
the Middle West. He will give the
courses announced in the current cat
alogue under Professor Huberich's
name. These are Criminal and Con
stitutional Law and Conflicts of Laws.
Professor Huberich will give the same
courses at the University of Wisconsin.
The exchange of professors, thus in
augurated, is in line with the policy
of the larger universities, and was
one of the matters advanced by Pro
fessor Abbot some years ago in his
presidential address before the Asso
ciation of American Law Schools.
This policy is likewise favored
many others for the reason that .t
tends not alone toward a closer rela
tionship between the different unive>-
sities of the country, but gives the
students the broader view that comes
from study under a number of instruc
tors.
