### 
In answer to the recent reception
tendered them by Encina Club, the
faculty will on Friday, April 30, en
tertain the clubmen at the faculty
clubhouse and grounds. A very origi
nal and novel plan of entertainment
on such a scale as has not been at
tempted for several years has been
mapped out by the committee in
charge.
The "good time" will begin at 4:30
in the afternoon and will last until
8:30. A baseball game between picked
teams representing the faculty and
Encina Club will open up the program
and this will be followed by an exhi
bition of expert marksmanship by
Professors H. D. Gray and J. F. New
some. A bounteous hot "feed" will
then be served.
After dinner, bonfires will be lighted,
and in the glare of the flames a varied
and interesting vaudeville program
will be given by a number of the tal
ented faculty members. The details of
the program have not been settled but
those in charge promise that it will be
good.
At a meeting of Encina Club yester
day evening,, E. P. Tallant, '09, was
elected captain and coach of the base
ball team which will meet the Faculty
nine.
