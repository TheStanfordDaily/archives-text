No action was taken in regard to the
matter of awarding sweaters to the
crew substitutes as the Executive Com
mittee is undecided as to the style of
the emblems. A plan is under con
sideration whereby the sweaters shall
be of a different style'for the various
sports, each activity having its own
emblem, and pending the decision of
this matter the awarding of the sub
stitute sweaters was postponded.
The Intercollegiate records made by
Stanford men at the meet were al
lowed and a committee consisting of
H. L. Horton, '08, and R. B. Wheeler,
'11, were authorized to tabulate all
Stanford records to date.
The point winners in the track meet,
the crew men, baseball players, train
ers and coaches were awarded fobs.
The design has not yet been selected
but one will be chosen soon and the
fobs ordered immediately.
President Roth was authorized to
appoint a committee to prepare possi
ble amendments to the Student Body
constitution. If any changes are con
sidered, they can be submitted to the
Student Body at the coming meeting.
