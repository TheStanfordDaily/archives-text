# WILL SEND TEAM EAST
## NUMBER OF MEN TO GO DEPENDENT ON MONEY SUBSCRIBED. To Appeal to Alumni for Contributions Meet with Olympic Club on May 22. 
### 
Definite plans have been made for
the trip of the track team to the Con
ference Meet held in Chicago on June
5. While it has been decided to send
the team, the number of men who will
go East depends entirely on the
amount of money which can be ob
tained. The cost of the trip will be
about $250 or $:iOO per man, which will
mean that a team of eight men will
require a larger sum than that now
promised from various sources.
It is probable that an entertainment
will be arranged for the benefit of
the team and it is also desired that
anyone knowing any of the alumni
correspond with them for the purpose
of obtaining subscriptions. A consid
erable sum of money will also be
realized from the various meets held
on the way East.
As freshmen are barred from the
Conference, it is not known who will
run the two mile for Stanford. Try
outs will be held for this event as
well as for the mile run.
On May 22 a post-season meet will
be held in San Francisco with the
Olympic Club team. The Olympic team
is a very strong one, and will give
the men sufficient competition to put
them in readiness for the Conference.
A great many of the best men in
the Universities of the Middle West
have not returned to college this year
and while there are several athleres,
especially two-milers, who have been
doing good work, they will not be
eligible.
The team will leave San Francisco
on the night of the Olympic meet,
stopping enroute at Salt Lake for a
meet with the University of Utah.
Meets will also be held at Denver,
with the University of Denver, and
at Ames, lowa, with the University of
lowa, although the details of these
latter contests have not yet been en
tirely agreed upon.
