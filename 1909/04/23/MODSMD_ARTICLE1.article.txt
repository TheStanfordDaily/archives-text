# DIRECTORS PLAN MEET
## COMMITTEES APPOINTED TO PROVIDE FOR VISITING ATHLETES. Heats of Interscholastic to Be Held in Morning.â€”Many Entries from Schools of This State. 
### 
At a meeting of the Governing
Board of the Interscholastic Associa
tion held last evening at the Zeta Psi
house, details were arranged for the
meet on May 1. Communications from
some of the high schools were read
in which it was suggested that the
heats of the 220 and 440-yard dashes
be run off on Friday, the day preceding
the meet, but the Board decided that
this would be unfair to teams coming
from a distance. A proposal to make
the relay race one for four men in
stead of five and to change the dis
tance to 880 yards was also reported
unfavorably. It was deemed more ad
visable to run the full distance of
one mile with five men.
A committee was appointed from
Encina Club to complete the arrange
ments for the accommodations of the
visiting teams. The committee con
sists of J. P. Hemphill, '09, chairman,
H. L. Horton, '08, A. C. Coonradt, '09,
K. McKeuzie, '10, R. J. Miller, W. D.
Fletcher, '11, F. L. Guerena, '11, and
N. W. Day, '11. A reception commit
tee of the following men was also
appointed by President Ilolman: A. E.
Roth, '09, C. B. Bradford, '09, M. M.
Mitchell, 10, R. B. Wheeler, '11, H. L.
Horton, '08, and J. R. Holman, '09,
chairman.
Entries for the meet will close to
morrow, the drawings for the various
heats being held on Sunday. A num
ber of schools have already entered
but (lie number is expected to be
greatly increased by to-morrow eve
ning. Two entries have been received
from Chico, one from the high school,
the other from the State Normal school
at the same place. The Normal school
team will be weakened by the loss of
Rice, the hammer thrower, who cap
tured first place in that event last
year. Ventura will enter a team of
four men, one of whom is Argabrite
who recently captured the Southern
California championship with a leap
of G feet, 1 inch in the high jump.
