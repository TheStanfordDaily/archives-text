The significance of the Musical Fes
tival which will be held here next
week should be understood clearly.
The institution of annual gatherings
of the nature planned for this season
is an idea which is worthy of perpetu
ation.
Musical Festivals can be of great
service to the University in advertis
ing it as a center of learning and cu!-
ture. At the University of California
the uumerous excellent concerts hold
in the Greek Theater have spread the
name of that institution to many who
would otherwise not have become fain
iliar with it.
While here at Stanford we have not
the opportunities afforded for these
popular out-door concerts, a commun
ity sufficiently great to make possible
a musical program of the kind followed
at Berkeley, we can do our share to
support what does appear feasible.
If each year Stanford University is
understood to be a gathering place
for the best musical talent, it will not
be long before the name of the Uni
versity will be associated with that of
a well-rounded institution. We have
already achieved worthy recognition
in other activities and it is fitting that
we make the most of the opportunities
offered in this new direction.
