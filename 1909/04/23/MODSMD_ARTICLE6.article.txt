# SPEAK FOR EATING CLUBS.
## Hemphill and Barbur Confer with Finance Committee of Trustees on Proposed Plan. 
### 
President J. P. Memphill, '09, of En
cina Club and L. W. Barbur, '07, yes
terday appeared before the Finance
Committee of the Hoard of Trustees
and discussed with them the proposed
plan of establishing eating clubs near
FCncina dormitory. Those who have
been drawing up the plans have been
able to ascertain the desirability of
such clubs and the cost of their in -
spallation and maintenance, so that
Hemphill and Barbur were able to ex
plain the plan in its every detail.
The Board of Trustees will take the
matter under consideration at its next
meeting and will then probably give
its final decision. With regard to the
proposed opening of the old pantries
off the clubroom as a trophy room
and library, the Board at its last meet
ing gave permission for the use of
these vacant rooms for such a pur
pose, hut declined to take the financial
responsibility. If anything is done by
way of improvement the students will
have to bear the expense.
