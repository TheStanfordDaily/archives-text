### 
A very able and helpful sermon was
delivered yesterday morning before a
well-filled Chapel by the Reverend
D. Charles Gardner who spoke on the
subject of "Religion." The preacher
spoke of the various elements in re
ligion and raised the point of the
necessity of the proper appreciation
of what religion really is. He said in
part:
"For many years the Bible has been
the religious standard, but the word
"religion" is only mentioned three
times in this sacred book. In its pure
essence, religion is the life, the hap
piness, the moral life of millions. It
is to the soul, what sunshine is to
nature. Emotion, knowledge, and
morality are all essential elements of
religion. Emotion is the genius of
conversion, knowledge is necessary for
an intellectual appreciation and de
fense of religion, while morality is
conformity to the laws of right. Re
ligion, however, is more than these.
It is the uplift of the human heart to
an Almighty God and intensive desire
to put the human will in intercourse
with the divine will."
Before the sermon, Miss C. Ryan
rendered a pleasing violin solo, while
the choir sang the anthem, "The Rad
iant Morn Hath Passed Away."
