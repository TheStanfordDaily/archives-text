In the election of L. S. Scott, '10,
to captain the track team, a deserving
and competent leader has been chosen.
For three consecutive years the newly
elected captain has taken points in
intercollegiate competition and in
baseball and football is rated as one
of the most reliable of athletes. We
believe that he will aid largely in
bringing home another Cardinal vic
tory next year.
