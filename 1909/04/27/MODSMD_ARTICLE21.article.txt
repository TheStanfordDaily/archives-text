# 1910 QUAD OFF THE PRESS.
## Annual Is Now in Bindery and Should Be on Sale Next Week. 
### 
The last pages of the 1910 "Quad"
are being printed to-day and the vol
ume will go into the hands of the
hinders to-morrow. If the present
plans are carried out .the Junior an
nual will be placed on sale on the
Quad on Tuesday or Wednesday of
next week.
The rough copy of the book has been
inspected by the editors and has
proven satisfactory in every way.
In the art work, which has been made
the chief feature of the book, some ex
cellent results have been attained by
the printers both in the color plates
and the ordinary black and white cuts.
As finally made up, the 1910 Quad
will be about the same size as the
book issued last year and will con
form to the precedent set by former
issues in regard to style of paper and
binding. There has been some re
arrangement of the order of material
in the book and two additional de
partments added, giving a special sec
tion to the activities of the women
students and re-establishing the lit
erary department in which are grouped
contributions from several former
Stanford men now prominent in the
literary world.
