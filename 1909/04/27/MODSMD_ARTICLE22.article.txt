# Physiology Club Holds Picnic.
## 
### 
About twenty-five members of the
newly organized Physiology Club
gathered last evening at the Basaltic
columns, which are located about two
miles from the University, and enjoyed
a moonlight picnic. The club decided
to hold similar gatherings once a
month throughout the coming year.
