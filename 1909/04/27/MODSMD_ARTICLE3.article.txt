# SCOTT ELECTED TRACK CAPTAIN.
## Versatile Athlete Chosen to Lead by Team-mates at Meeting Held This Afternoon. 
### 
At a meeting of the track men held
this afternoon L. Scott, '10, was chosen
to lead next year's varsity team.
Scott has been a prominent athlete
ever since his entrance in college,
occupying positions on both track and
baseball teams for the last three years.
The fine work of Scott in the recent
meet, when, handicapped by a bad
ankle, he won the pole-vault and made
sure a Stanford victory, without doubt
led to his selection as captain.
Scott played center three-quarters
on last year's rugby team and is a
member of the Gym. Club. The new
captain registers from Alameda in
Architectural Drawing, and is a mem
ber of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fra
ternity.
