The completed entry list for the
Interscholastic Meet numbers one hun
dred and forty-eight contestants, rep
resenting twenty-eight different pre
paratory schools from all parts of
the Pacific Coast. New entries were
received yesterday afternoon from Hill
Military Academy of Portland, Oregon,
and from Santa Clara High School.
Secretary Miller is also in receipt of
a telegram from the Los Angeles High
School which states that, owing to
opposition on the part of the local
Board of Education, their track team
will be compelled to withdraw its en
tries. This withdrawal takes one of
the strongest teams out of the com
petition.
