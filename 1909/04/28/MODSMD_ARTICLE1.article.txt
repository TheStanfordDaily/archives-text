# PLAN TO ASSIST TEAM
## VAUDEVILLE ON STANFORD FIELD NEXT WEDNESDAY. Committee Arranges Entertainment to Raise Funds to Send Track Team to Chicago. 
### 
The committee appointed by Stu
dent Body President A. E. Roth, '09, to
plan means of increasing the fund to
send the track team to the Conference
Meet at Chicago has definitely decided
to give an out-of-door vaudeville 011
Stanford Field next Wednesday eve
ning.
Though the approaching end of the
semester has been of grave considera
tion in planning some form of bene
fit, it was decided that the program for
next Wednesday should not interfere
with time devoted to studies, as the
committee has planned to start the
performance at 7:30 o'clock, and the
duration will not be over an hour and
three-quarters or two hours.
The show will be an entirely new
"stunt" in the way of entertainment.
A large platform will be arranged di
rectly in front of one "L" of the
bleachers, thus securing the effect of
a large amphitheatre and the electric
paraphernalia of the 1908 Senior Cir
cus will be used to illuminate the
grounds.
A very excellent program has been
arranged for, in which a majority of
the local vaudeville "stars" will ap
pear in especial stunts, while there
will be several acts in which new
talent will take part. The Stanford
Band has consented to render its serv
ices during the evening.
The vaudeville program will not be
the only feature, as the committee is
planning to make the evening a con
fetti carnival and a general "jolly-up"
at which an abundance of peanuts,
popcorn and confetti will be on hand.
These will be sold in the audience by
the women students.
Graduate Manager J. E. Stewart
hopes to have the peanuts and pop
corn donated, thereby cutting expenses
to a minimum. The entire proceeds
from the entrance charge, which will
be twenty-five cents, and the sale of
the confetti, peanuts, and popcorn will
be turned into the track funds, the
amount of which will determine the
number of men sent to the Conference
Meet.
