# FESTIVAL INTRODUCED
## FIRST CONCERT OF SERIES PRESENTED LAST NIGHT. Versatile Program Offered at Initial Production of Music Feast. 
### 
A very diversified program was pre
sented last evening in Assembly Hall
at the first concert which formally
introduced the Stanford Music Festi
val. Besides the introduction of the
members from the Chicago Symphony
aggregation, who appeared as vocal
soloists, three artists were secured by
organist G. C. Buehrer to give num
bers upon the cello, violin and piano.
This trio was composed of Mr. Karl
Grienauer, who played the cello, Mr.
John Marquart with the violin and
Madame Grienauer at the piano, of
whom the cellist stood out promi
nently as the star. His rendition of
the "Dance of the Elves" by Hopper
ably manifested his ability and his
mastery of the technique of the cello,
while the melodic themes of Wag
ner's "Romanze" and a "Cantabile"
by Liszt gave Grienauer ample op
portunity to display his unusual touch
and execution.
Miss Fralnn, from the Eastern Sym
phony Chorus rendered two selections
"Stil vie de nacht," and "Shadows,"
in which she displayed a modulated
voice that was high above the aver
age. The same group of musicians
was also represented by Mr. F. A.
Preisch, one of their strongest bari
tones, the high character of his skill
being manifested in the presentation
of a group of popular baritone selec
tions.
"Ava Maria," as taken from Men
delssohn's compositions, was ably
rendered by the Pacific Grove Treble
Clef Club under the direction of Mrs.
M. W .McCauley.
Mr. John Marquart interpreted the
Sarasate "Faust" Fantaisie for the
Violin."
