The program tor Senior Week as
recently announced by the committee
having the calendar in charge is an
unusually good one. The number of
events scheduled is large and the prep
arations in course of consumation in
sure that the functions will be even
above the high average established by
prior classes. Neither time, ingenu
ity or expense has been spared by the
various committees to devise a fitting
Commencement for the Class of U)O9,
and while it is for the benefit of the
graduates principally that the festivi
ties are planned, they should be par
ticipated in by the entire University
community to as large extent as is
possible.
The natural inclination of the ma
jority of the underclassmen, and not
a few juniors and even seniors, is to
leave the campus as soon as the last
examination period has terminated.
This is often made necessary because
of financial reasons, but we believe in
many instances the date of leaving
Hie campus is optional and the hurry
ing away from the University without
waiting to take part in Commence
ment, a matter of unintentional neg
lect.
The Commencement exercises of any
University perhaps the best idea
of the actual status of the institu
tion. At the great universities of the
East the annual commencement is a
gala epoch in which not only the
alumni and graduates take part, but
the undergraduates. This interming
ling of the undergraduates and the
older men and women of the university
who have been out in the world serves
a twofold, beneficial purpose. The
men and women who have left the
university community are brought
ouce more into touch with the aca
demic atmosphere by the association
with the undergraduates. The under
graduates in turn are brought into
touch with interested individuals who
have gained experience by the ming

ling with the outside-world and are
able to give sensible aid in shaping
the careers of those who are still in
the course of preparation.
It is safe to say that as matters
now stand here, the average under
graduate upon reaching the year of
graduation has never witnessed any
of the previous Commencements. This
is obviously not right, if the Com
mencement exercises are to be im
proved from time to time as the Uni
versity advances.
Specifically, the members of the
community should begin this year to
mark a new spirit in the undergrad
uate community, and by attending the
Commencement of 1909 —attending all
of the functions or only a portion—aid
this class and benefit the University.
