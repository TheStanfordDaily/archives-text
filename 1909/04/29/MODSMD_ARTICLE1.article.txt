# EXPECT TO WIN MEET
## TRACK MEN CONFIDENT OF VICTORY AT CHICAGO. Comparison of Records Shows Possibilities of Stanford Team in Conference Meet This Year. 
### 
Basing their forecasts on the pres
ent season performances of the ath
letes who may expected to compete
in the Conference Meet in Chicago in
June, Captain Horton and the men of
the track team estimate that there is
an excellent chance of a Cardinal vic
tory over the universities of the mid
dle west.
While the showing made will de
pend to some extent on the number
of men who make the trip, indications
are that the Stanford score will be
larger than that of last year by sev
eral points.
In the hundred-yard dash H. E.
Reed, '10, who is a consistent perfor
mer at : 10.1 when in condition,
should be reasonably sure of a second
place as May, winner last year, was
recently defeated in a 10:1 race. If he
runs in the form shown last year
Reed also has a good chance for three
points in the 220-yard dash. Eight
points will come to the Cardinal in the
quarter-mile on an estimate based on
form, as the time of 50:1 and 50:2
credited to Wyman and Miller in this
distance is better than anything done
by the Conference athletes. Miller
can undoubtedly win the half again as
he has proven to be reliable at 1:58.2
if forced to run his best, while there
is reason to believe that he can lower
this time. Wyman is also able to be
considered in the 880.
Several of the Stanford milers have
done time which would entitle them
to a second place at Chicago, basing
on the performances of last year,
while Worthington is capable of plac
ing with the possibility of doing still
better in the two mile. There are
two men in the Conference running
this distance in less than ten minutes,
but there is a possibility that they will
not compete. Stanford will be weak
in the hurdles as Horton's injury will
prevent him from entering either
hurdle event.
Crawford should take both weight
events if he can duplicate his mark
of 143 feet in the hammer-throw last
year and equal his toss of 44 ft. 3 in.
in the intercollegiate meet this spring.
Horton would also take points in the
shot-put if not handicapped too se
verely by his injured leg. There would
be small chance of Stanford placing
in the jumps, but if Jacobs is out
of the competition as reported, Cap
tain-elect L. Scott, '10, would have a
chance for a first place in the pole
vault.
