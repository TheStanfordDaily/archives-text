# FIRST TEAMS ARRIVE
## INTERSCHOLASTIC CONTESTANTS REACH CAMPUS. Oakland High School Will Probably Enter Meet.—Final List of Officials Announced. 
### 
The representatives of Hill Mili
tary Academy, of Portland, Oregon,
and of Pasadena High School have
already arrived on the campus to pre
pare for the Interscholastic meet of
Saturday next. The team from the
former school, consisting of six men,
claims the distinction of being the
first aggregation to compete from out
side of this state. Seattle High School
was entered in the 1907 meet, but,
owing to delays in the train service,
did not reach the campus in time to
contest. The Hill Academy team
numbers several exceptionally good
athletes among its members and is
practically assured of places in some
of the most hotly contested events.
Burns is credited with 2:04 in the
half-mile and 4:40 in the mile and,
with his team-mate, Graham should
figure prominently in these two
races. MacGuire has a record of 16:1
in the high hurdles, and if he is able
to again reach this mark, will earn
a place in what is looked forward to
as the fastest race of the meet.
Pasadena High School sends Thomp
son as its lone entry this year, and,
judging from his past performances,
he will prove a point-winner in the
hammer-throw. The other teams will
begin to arrive to-morrow and some
of the contestants will reach the
campus as late as Saturday morning.
Owing to some misunderstanding
concerning the eligibility of members
of preparatory school fraternities to
contest in alhletics, the Oakland High
School was obliged to withhold its
entries until to-day. The list of con
testants was submitted this morning,
however, and, if allowed to compete,
the team will make an effective bid
for first place. Oakland is especially
strong in the weights, the mile run
and the hurdles.
The final list of officials for the
meet has been chosen and is as fol

The representatives of Hill Mili
tary Academy, of Portland, Oregon,
and of Pasadena High School have
already arrived on the campus to pre
pare for the Interscholastic meet of
Saturday next. The team from the
former school, consisting of six men,
claims the distinction of being the
first aggregation to compete from out
side of this state. Seattle High School
was entered in the 1907 meet, but,
owing to delays in the train service,
did not reach the campus in time to
contest. The Hill Academy team
numbers several exceptionally good
athletes among its members and is
practically assured of places in some
of the most hotly contested events.
Burns is credited with 2:04 in the
half-mile and 4:40 in the mile and,
with his team-mate, Graham should
figure prominently in these two
races. MacGuire has a record of 16:1
in the high hurdles, and if he is able
to again reach this mark, will earn
a place in what is looked forward to
as the fastest race of the meet.
Pasadena High School sends Thomp
son as its lone entry this year, and,
judging from his past performances,
he will prove a point-winner in the
hammer-throw. The other teams will
begin to arrive to-morrow and some
of the contestants will reach the
campus as late as Saturday morning.
Owing to some misunderstanding
concerning the eligibility of members
of preparatory school fraternities to
contest in alhletics, the Oakland High
School was obliged to withhold its
entries until to-day. The list of con
testants was submitted this morning,
however, and, if allowed to compete,
the team will make an effective bid
for first place. Oakland is especially
strong in the weights, the mile run
and the hurdles.
The final list of officials for the
meet has been chosen and is as fol
lows:
Referee—H. W. Kerrigan, '00; Start
er—J. R. Holman, '09; Assistants—J.
O. Miller, '08; M. M. Mitchell, '10;
