# FESTIVAL CONCLUDED
## STABAT MATER CLOSES SERIES OF CONCERTS. Chicago Symphony Orchestra Presents Program Replete with Excellent Numbers. 
### 
Augmented by the Chicago Sym
phony Orchestra, with its complement
of vocal and instrumental soloists, the
chorus of four hundred voices last
evening completed the Stanford Music
Festival by giving a rendition of the
chorale parts of Rossini's "Stabat
Mater" besides the well-known "Pro
cessional" from Wagner's "Tannhau
ser." The arias in these selections
were handled ably by the quartet that
is now traveling with the orchestra,
the four parts being sung by Aida
Hernmi as first soprano, Miss Frahm,
second soprano, F. O. Preisch who
appeared as baritone, with D. B. Dug
gett in the tenor.
From the opening overture from
"Tannhauser" with its encore of
"Love's Dream After the Ball," to the
finale of the main oratorio of the eve
ning, the eastern aggregation of mu
sicians lent invaluable aid to the ulti
mate success of the entire program.
The orchestrations and finished exe
cution evidenced by the orchestra un
der the efficient leadership of Adolphe
Rosenbecker, completed and filled out
the repertoire for the evening and
afternoon to a very great extent.
In rendering Bralim's "Hungarian
Dances," with its opportunities for
rythmical tonation and orchestral
technique, the Chicago musicians man
ifested their superiority as ail or
chestra.
Equally as well presented was the
program that was offered by the man
agement of the Festival in the after
noon. An overture from Mendels
shon's interpretation of the "Midsum
mer Night's Dream" opened this sec
tion of the series of concerts. Among
the soloists, the young American
pianist, Miss Myrtle Elvin figured
prominently in her rendition of the
famous Greig- "Concerto."
Guy Woodard, who is probably one
of the best known younger American
violinists of the present day and who
has become known in Europe through
his associations with Ysaye and other
famous musicians there, interpreted
a concerto for the violin by Delcrose
with an orchestral accompaniment.
Aida Hemmi completed the soloists
who appeared, her number upon the
program being an Aria from "Der
Freischuetz" as composed by Weber.
The Festival can fully be said to
have proven a success and a credit to
those who promoted the institution.
