# SWEATERS ARE VOTED
## FRESHMAN CREW AND TRACK MEN REWARDED. Executive Committee Discusses the Raising of Funds for Eastern Trip. 
### 
Business of immediate importance
was discussed and transacted by the
members of the Executive Committee
at their weekly meeting held last
night.
Twelve sweaters were awarded to
members of the Freshman Track team
who were successful in winning points
in the intercollegiate Freshman meet
this year. The Freshmen who were
granted numerals are: J. L. Arrell,
C. C. Argabrite, A. S. Brown, T. L.
Coleman, J. W. Doron, F. M. Johnson,
P. M. Levy, W. H. Newman, A. W.
Peake, B. F. Van Dyke, J. E. Wooley
and C. C. Whitney. Nine eweaters
were also awarded to the 1912 Fresh
man crew including the following
men: R. W. Clyde, H. L. Dietterle, R.
R. Gower, J. W. Howell, J. F. Part
ridge, H. 13. Post, A. M. Sanborn, R.
H. Seward and C. L. Schaupp.
Five white German "S's" were
granted by the committee to G. Mc-
Gregor, '09, R. C. McFadden, '10, B. L.
Ball, '11, C. H. Tallant, '11, and C. W.
Scholeficld, '11, who substituted dur
ing the last baseball season.
Ways and means of financing the
eastern trip to be taken by the track
men were again discussed at length
while a prospectus of the amount now
assured in advance was presented.
This sum, being composed principally
of guarantees olfered by various col
leges and athletic clubs, amounts to
practically $1400. The University of
Utah has offered the sum of $300 to
be obtained from a meet between that
institution and the Stanford repre
sentatives, while Chicago guarantees
the same amount. Boulder, Colorado,
can defray the team's expenses by
.$2OO, while there is a possibility that
the Denver field day may be combined
with the former so as to create a
triangular meet. The results of the
meet to be held by the Olympic Club
of San Francisco and the Cardinal
athletes prior to the start, for the
East will probably raise the sum of
$400.
