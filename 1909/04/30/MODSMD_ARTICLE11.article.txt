The fourth annual meet of the Stan
ford Interscholastic Athletic Associa
tion will be held on the Stanford track
to-morrow, and from present indica
tions it should be one of the most
successful events of the kind held.
We wish to take this opportunity to
bid the many visiting athletes welcome
to Stanford and feel sure that the
members of the Student Body will
concur with us in this and aid to
their utmost in making the visit of
our guests pleasant.
It is well to mention at this time a
few facts concerning the big annual
meet which may not be fully known
to the athletes who compete for the
first time and to members of the lower
classes.
The athletes of the high schools and
preparatory institutions of this coast
are indebted largely to a small num
ber of earnest and broad-minded Stan
ford graduates for the institution of
this association which holds this
gathering each year. Especially as
sociated with (he Stanford Interscho
lastic Association is the name of VV.
H. B. Fowler, a graduate of the Class
of 1906, who first broached the idea
here and donated the handsome per
petual trophy cup which is awarded
to the winning school.
Mr. Fowler was ably seconded in
his project by men who were at (hat
time prominent in undergraduate af
fairs. ft was their intention to insti
tute a meet which would be of gen
eral interest and benefit to athletes
of all the secondary schools of (he
Coast. It is the idea of the Associa
tion to foster clean athletics. Com
petent officials have been appointed
to take charge of the contests to
morrow and we anticipate a record
breaking meet which will go down
in athletic annals as a huge success.
