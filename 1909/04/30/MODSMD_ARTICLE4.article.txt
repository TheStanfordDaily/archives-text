# INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET TOMORROW WILL BE CLOSE
## Fast Entries From Many Schools Will Furnish Exciting Competition High Hurdles Considered Best Event. 
### 
To-morrow morning at ten o'clock
the fourth annual meet, held under
the auspices of the Stanford Intersclio
lastic Athletic Association will take
place, and, according to all present in
dications, this will be the greatest
event of its kind that has ever been
witnessed on the Stanford track.
Owing to the great success of Inter
scholastic meets in the past, they have
come to be looked upon by prepara
tory schools of the Pacific Coast as
the most important track events of
the season. Each succeeding year has
seen a great increase in the amount
of territory represented, and, with
the addition of Hill Military Academy
to the list of contestants, twenty-nine
preparatory schools, ranging from
Portland, Oregon, 011 the north to
Los Angeles on the south, will com
pete for the championship on track
and field to-morrow. Fourteen events,
in which one hundred and sixty-eight
young athletes have entered will be
pulled off â€”many of them in record
breaking time, if the past perform
ances of the contestants may be taken
as a criterion of their merit. The
discus-throw, a comparatively new
event in this part of the country, will
not count in the final score, but will
furnish exciting competition for the
men who handle the weights. The
relay race is another event which does
not help the winner toward a victory
in the meet but always furnishes
excitement, as one of the most valu
able cups is captured by the victori
ous team.
Owing to the fact that there is
such an immense number of unknown
entries, any attempt to predict the
winner of the meet would necessarily
be based on guess work. Los Angeles
High School seemed at first to have
the most promising outlook, but they
were lately compelled to withdraw, as
the local Board of Education would
not allow the team to take the north
ern trip. The re-entry of Oakland
High School with a team of twenty
two men gives them an excellent
chance to capture the meet with Ber
keley High their closest rivals. What
ever the outcome, the score of the
winning team will probably be low.
for several of the smaller schools have
one and two-man teams which are
practically assured of first place and
these will prevent any great amount
of scoring by one aggregation.
Campbell, of Modesto High, will
probably prove to be the highest in
dividual point-winner, as he is the
most versatile athlete among the en
tries. Campbell is to compete in the
three dashes, the high hurdles, the
high jump, shot-put, a,nd 'lammer
throw. He has a record of ten ( ans
one-fifth seconds in the
dash, twenty-two and three-fifths
onds in the two-twenty and is credited
with fifty-two and one-fifth seconds' In
the quarter. The last-named race
should prove exciting with Campbell,
and Macaulay of Alameda fighting for
first place.

Any estimate of the outcome of the
hundred must be based on a compari
son of previous records of the con
testants, as few of them have been
seen together before this time. Crooks,
Benicia High School's entry is cred
ited with ten and one-fifth seconds,
and stands well for first place. Cald
well and Hollis of Cogswell Poly-,
technic are very consistent perform
ers in fast company and should be
able to take two places in the event.
The winner of the two-twenty yard
dash will probably have to cover the
distance in twenty-two and three
fifths seconds as there are several
entries with this mark to their credit.
Macaulay is strong in this event and
will undoubtedly take either first or
second.
The quarter should be a very fast
event, and bring out some of the best
class of the day. Macaulay figures
strongly to win, but he will have three
strong adversaries in Campbell of
Modesto, Rogers of Harvard, and
Meyer of Lowell High. The latter has
done fifty-two and one-fifth seconds
and should improve this time if
pressed.
Since the withdrawal of McCiure of
Los Angeles High, the outcome of the
half-mile run is doubtful. But few
of last year's performers are entered
in the race and little is known of the
new men. Burns of Hill Military
Academy has covered the two laps in
two minutes and four seconds, and his
team-mate, Graham, is also fast for
the distance. ' Fitzgerald of Vallejo is
another good entry.
The best chances for a victory in
the mile run seem to lie with Vallely
of Harvard. Vallely is consistent and
has been improving greatly during the
past two years. Rathburn of Berkeley
High is very good in the distances,
and is expected to do well in the mile
to-morrow. Burns, who is also en
tered in the half for Hill Military
Academy should take a place in this
event if he can equal his past perfor
mances.
The high hurdle race shows promise
of being the fastest and most hotly
contested event of the day. The en
tries are large and are, without an
exception, excellent performers in the
event. Kern of Berkeley has been
running this race in consistent fashion
this year in the fast time of sixteen
and two-fifths seconds. MacGuire of
Hill Military Academy, and Maclise
of Oakland High, will probably fight
it out, with Kern for first place. In
addition to these men, Lee of Chico
and Beeson of Healdsburg are excep
tionally good.
The two-twenty hurdles, while not
so promising as the shorter race, will
furnish excitement in the final heats.
The distance should be covered in less
than twenty-six seconds.
t VOf the field events, the weights will
bring out the hardest competition with
entries from several of the smaller
schools fighting for places. Coolidge
