# 1910 QUAD WEDNESDAY
## EDITORS OF JUNIOR ANNUAL ANNOUNCE DATE. Grout Interest Aroused in Novel Josh Department.â€”Colored Plates Decided Success. 
### 
Definite arrangements have been
completed by the managers of the 1910
Quad to commence the sale of the an
nual on Wednesday morning, May 5,
at 9 o'clock on the inner Quadrangle.
The sale will last throughout the day
after which time books can bo ob
tained at campus and Palo Alto book
stores. The price charged will be the
same as in former years, $2.50. All
juniors who have paid their assess
ment will be charged $1.50 upon pre
sentment of their receipt from the
business manager. Owing to the fact
that an unusually large number of
alumni have signified their intention
of purchasing the book, the managers
have decided to place the publication
on sale at the various bookstores in
San Francisco where a big sale is ex
pected.
In order to be certain that this Quad
will be well bound, it has been de
cided to leave the book in the bindery
for a week, this being twice as long
as has been allowed for any previous
publications. An unusually large
number of pages will be contained in
this issue, 450 being the exact number.
The three and four colored plates
which have been mentioned as a spe
cial feature of the '10 Quad have all
turned out successfully and will be a
marked improvement over former pub
lications. The plates, seven in num
ber, are inserted in various parts
throughout the book. The addition
of extra pages has made it possible
to devote more space to half-tone cuts
than would have been otherwise pos
sible.
Great interest has been aroused con
cerning the Josh Department, due to
persistent rumors that cartoons of sev
eral prominent men have been in
cluded under this head. Much time
and labor has been devoted to this
section by noted campus artists and
other members of the university in
order to surpass all other such de
partments in former Quads.
