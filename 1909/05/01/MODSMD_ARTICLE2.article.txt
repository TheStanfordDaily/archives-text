petition in practically every event,
Healdsburg High School captured
first place in the Fourth Annual Inter
scholastic track meet.. The final score
gives twenty points to the winners
and in addition to these Healdsburg
took first and second places in the
discus-throw, an event which is not
figured toward winning the meet. In
addition to the honor of taking first
place, Healdsburg claims in its team,
the man who carries away the Encina
Club Cup, given to the highest indivi
dual point-winner. The successful
man today was Beeson, who took first
place handily in the two-twenty hur
dles, second place in the high-jump,
and a well-deserved second in the
shorter hurdle race. To Young, of
Healdsburg, goes the honor of pulling
his school out. of a tie with Alameda
for first place. Young was the only
Healdsburg entry left in the meet
when the pole-vault was contested,
and the four points which he took by
tying for first place in this event
gave his team a winning margin. In
addition to Beeson's eleven points
and Young's four, Coolidge added five
to Healdsburg's final score a first
place in the hammer-throw. The vic
tors will take with them the Stanford
cup and the Sigma Sigma Trophy, the
former being a perpetual challenge
and the latter a thrice-trial cup.

Alameda High School with a final
score of sixteen points. Of these, ten
were contributed by the game little
runner, Macaulay, who took first
place in the two-twenty after winning

ter-scholastic record. The remaining
six points which went to Alameda
were taken by Cummins, who cap
tured second in the two-twenty and
Thorpe, who finished close to Burns,

fourth lap and increasing it to five
yards at the finish. Vallely, who
looked to be the winner of this event

his field at the last hurdle and picked
up a lead of three yards before the
finish tape was broken. Beeson, of
Healdsburg, and Case, of Chico State
Normal, finished second and third re

banner place. Heath covered the dis
