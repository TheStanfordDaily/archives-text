The fourth annual track and field
meet of the Stanford Interscholastic
Athletic Association has passed into
history. After many spectacular, and
even sensational trials ot' strength
and speed the honor and glory of
victory fell to the best team. Every
school and every man was in to win.
All fought gamely and squarely. Not
a single incident occured to mar the
day's sport or to detract from the
conquest of the Healdsburg High
School track team. In bidding adieu
to our guests, we trust that we may
welcome them all back to the Stanford
campus on the occasion of the fifth
annual Interscholastic Meet just
twelve months hence.
