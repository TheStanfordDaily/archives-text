Within a few days the 1910 edition
of The Quad will appear on the cam
pus. We believe that this edition of
the book will be in keeping with the
average set by former publications
and would call attention to the place
of The Quad among Stanford publi
cations.
The Quad is essentially a record
book. As such it is valuable now and
will be more so in years to come.
Each edition of The Quad covers every
event worthy of mention from one
year to another and each book is com
plete in itself. By purchasing one
book in the course of four years spent
here but a quarter of the record is
obtained.
This is especially pertinent to
Freshmen and Sophomores. Seniors
recognize the worth of the year book
irrespective of class, but it is neces
sary, we believe, to emphasize the
worth to the underclassmen. While
the book may not represent such in
trinsic worth at the present time as
hard cash, money will not be able to
purchase this record in later years
when associations have become in
valuable.
We do not offer these suggestions
with the view of increasing the sales
of the 1910 Quad. It is our opinion,
however, that The Quad as a Stanford
institution should receive good sup
port in order that it may be improved
from year to year. Having been con
ducted entirely upon the honor basis,
we believe the 1910 Quad is more de
serving, perhaps, than any book hith
erto issued.
