siling year. Both the Glee and Mando
lin Clubs are in a flourishing condi
tion. Next season they will make their

shine the success of two years ago.
if the original plans had been carried
out the show would have occurred this
semester but training prevented many
who would have played prominent
roles in the blackface production from
being able to take part, consequently
the show was postponed until next
semester.
That the Glee and Mandolin clubs
have been doing good work this se
mester was shown by the offer the
clubs received from the Santa Fe Co.
to take a trip to Chicago with all ex
penses paid and from numerous other
generous offers they received during
the past year. It is hoped that the dif
ficulties that prevented ihe club from
from accepting any proposition will
hot effect any that may be received
next fall.
With the addition of several old men
who have been members of previous
clubs the outlook for next season is
very bright. A large stock of music
has been received from the Cornell
Glee Club which lias been memorized,
and as work has processed in a desul
tory manner all spring on the Min
strel show, a few weeks of active
work will make the clubs put on a
very interesting entertainment.
