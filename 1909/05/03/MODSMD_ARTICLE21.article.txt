# SCORES SINFUL WAYS
## REV. A.J. McCARTNEY CONDEMNS DISREGARD FOR SIN. In University Chapel Yesterday Young Preacher Deals Strongly with Modern Business Tendencies. 
### 
The modern tendency of consider
ing sin amenable only to law was
strongly condemned yesterday morn
ing at the Chapel service by the
Reverend A. J. McCartney who
tilled the pulpit. The young pas
tor preached one of the strongest
sermons heard in the Chapel this
semester in which he dealt with many
of the practices of a worldly people
in a straight-forward manner. Tak
ing as his text, the fourteenth verse
of the sixth chapter of Romans, "What
shall we say then? Shall we sin
because we are under law, but under
grace? God forbid." He spoke in
part as follows:
"Righteousness of life is not to be
achieved by conformity to any external
law or creed, but by faith in God. To
the mind of the average man it is
the law that restrains. He believes
that if there are no external barriers
against human conduct we can sin
without detection. To the believer,
the supreme motive for righteousness
is not fear of law, but the love and
honor of God. Grace leads not to
sin, but to holiness.
"Many believe that stealing is a
sin when convicted of it. In fact,
whenever the strength of the law is
removed there is danger of a tendency
to moral deterioration. However, a
true conformity to right is secured
only by a common love of Jesus Christ
which must be the passion for a man's
discipleship to God."
