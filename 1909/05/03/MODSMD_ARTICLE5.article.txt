# FRESHMEN ADDED TO SQUAD.
## Four 1912 Men Trying Out for Varsity Eight.â€”Leave Campus May 15. 
### 
The varsity crew men are training
regularly in an endeavor to get into
the best possible shape for their
northern trip. Four freshmen have
been added to the varsity squad and
will try for positions on the eight.
The men comprising the squad at
present are: J. C. Huston, '10, L. E.
Du Bois, '11, J. W. Fitting, '10, K.
Chamberlain, '11, J. A. Killian, '11, N.
M. Day, '11, J. F. Partridge, '12, H.
L. Dietterle, '12, R. R. Gilmore, '12,
R. H. Seward, '12, and F. L. Guerena,
'11. Captain Relph Reynolds may not
be able to take his place in the varsity
crew on account of his present sick
ness, which is keeping him from
training.
The captaincy of the crew for next
year will be settled during the present
week, the delay having been caused
by the serious illness of F. L. Wilde,
'10, who rowed No. 3.
The squad will leave the campus
the day after the final examination
and will race on Lake Washington on
May 29, against the Universities of
Washington and California.
