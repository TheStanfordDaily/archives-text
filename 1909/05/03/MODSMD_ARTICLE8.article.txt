# TRACK FUNDS NEEDED
## MONEY COMING IN SLOWLY FOR EASTERN TRIP. Subscription List May Be Started Among the Students.â€”H.E. Reed, '10, Receives Injury. 
### 
The task of financing the Eastern
trip of the track team is not progress
ing as successfully as anticipated.
There is only about $800 in sight from
dual meets en route, as unforseen
circumstances have compelled the va
rious institutions to modify their prop
ositions. Instead of $350 which the
University of Colorado gave last year,
it will only pay $200 this year and
as there is a minor conference meet
in Denver on May 29, the day set Ra
the Stanford-University of Denver
meet, the latter must be abandoned
although there is a possibility of se
curing a contest on the following
Monday with the victorious team.
Captain Horton states that to secure
the required funds it will be necessary
to start a subscription list among the
students as it would be unfortunate
to deprive the team of the privilege
of competing when it has such an ex
cellent chance of carrying off the
honors of the meet.
Upon the financial success of the
stunts night, Horton says
the trip* of the team depends in a large
measure, and it is up to the mem
bers of the Student Body to support
it.
The loss of H. S. Reed, '10, in the
sprints may make considerable dif
ference in the results of the various
meets. Reed broke down yesterday
while training and it is a question
whether in three weeks he can suf
ficiently round into form to accompany
the team.
If he is unable to compete it is likely
that H. R. Stolz, '09, will be a member
of the team as he can cover the 100-
yard dash in fast time as well as
doing 22 feet in the broad jump.
Stolz should take a place in the lat
ter event if he can repeat this distance
as 22 feet easily took second last
year.
