# QUAD OUT TOMORROW
## 1910 ANNUAL WILL FEATURE COLOR WORK AND JOSHES. Editors Expect Excellency of Art Work Will Make This Year's Book Up to Standard. 
### 
Tlie 1910 "Quad" will be placed on
sale to-morrow morning at 9:15 at the
usual stand on the Quadrangle.. This
date for the sale of the current an
nual lias been announced by Mana
ger C. W. Mason, and all arrange
ments have been completed for hav
ing the books oil the campus so that
there should be no delay in opening
the sale. The present Junior annual
is a larger volume than that published
last year and is more substantially
bound than previous Quads have been.
It is the tirst of the annuals to in
clude color plates in the art work and
the success of this innovation has
caused the management to anticipate
a heavy sale to-morrow.
While the space devoted to the dif
ferent departments has been rear
ranged with a view to giving greater
prominence to the "College Year" and
"Athletics" departments, the general
precedents of previous issues have not
been changed. The one exception to
this is the separation of the purely
statistical matter in the athletic sec
tion from the reading-matter and the
relegation of the former to a section
in the back of the book given over
to an appendix of statistics for each
branch of sports.
The greatest local interest in the
book is centered in the "josh" de
partment where thirty-two pages are
given over to sketches and cartoons
from the pens of some of the most
clever satirists in the University. A
secret beauty contest conducted by the
josh editors of the 1910 annual is
one of the features of this section
which is awakening no little curiosity
among those whose photographs are
reported to occupy a prominent place
on these pages. Several of the more
prominent undergraduates are joshed
in a style which has resulted in sev
eral attempts to steal the pictures and
copy from the josh editors.
Rut outside of these two special
features the real foundation of the
book is the art work, which is uni
formly good and above the average of
such publications. All of the best,
artists in the University are contribu
tors to this department and under the
direction of .T. M. Wadsworth, '10,
this section has maintained a high
standard throughout the book. More
than the usual space has been devoted
to full-page drawings and department
heads, and the half-tone illustrations
have been carefully proportioned to
the text.
In compiling the material for the
present "Quad." the editors have fol
lowed the policy of having the various
departments and articles in cnarge of
specialists in their particular field, so
that the subject-matter throughout the
book furnishes interesting reading.
