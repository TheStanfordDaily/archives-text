It is safe to say that 110 one in the
Student Body doubts the sincerity of
purpose which prompts the vaudeville
performance on Stanford Feild to
morrow night or questions the need of
more money for the team that is to
represent the University at the Con
ference Meet in Chicago. We think
that some may be under the inipres
snio, however, that the performance
to-morrow night will be a drawn-out
affair and designed strictly as a bene
lit for the track team and without
consideration of the audience.
It is this impression we wish to dis
pel and correct if such exists. We
have the assurance of the committee
in charge that the vaudeville will be
one of the most representative of the
talent in the University. It is one
that is entered into with enthusiasm
and is meritous from first to last, it
contains original and unique stunts.
Also, it is to be started early and will
be rushed through so that no time will
be consumed between numbers.
That the attendance of the entire
Student Body is desired hardly needs
further reiteration. The women as
well as the men are invited to con
tribute to the cause and in return
witness one of the best shows planned
here in some time.
By attending the performance in
large numbers a happy means of
avoiding a general assessment is pro
vided and should be appreciated fully.
