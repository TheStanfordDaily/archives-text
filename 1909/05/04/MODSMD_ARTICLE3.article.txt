At the final business meeting of the

held at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house
last night, the officers were elected

President, F. W. Weymouth, '09; Vice-
President, Miss E. L. Buckingham, '09;
Treasurer, A. F. Beaufait, '11; Sec
retary, Miss H. Campbell, '11; Faculty
Member of Executive Committee, Pro
fessor H. D. Gray and new member,
F. W. Weymouth.
The new president of the English
Club is a member of the Phi Beta
Kappa and Sigma Xi scholarship
honor societies.
New members were elected to the
club last night. They are: C. H. Hails,
'10; G. F. Morgan, '10; E. J. Hopkins,
'11; E. M. Leaf, '10; J. D. Houser, '10;
Miss S. E. Bundy, '10; Miss A. Shinn,
'08; Miss R. A. Sampson, '11; Miss
H. Ely, '11; Miss E. C. Porter, '11.
After the business meeting an ex
cellent dramatic program filled up the
remainder of the evening. The amus
ing farce, "Who's Who?" was played
with great spirit by G. F. Morgan, '10,
P. F. O'Gilvie, '11, Miss F. Wendling,
'12, and Miss H. Campbell, '11.
The clever one-act play by George
Bernard Shaw, entitled "How He Lied
to Her Husband," followed, and was
represented in a manner and with an
understanding not often seen in draw
ing-room play. "He" has no easy
task in being poet and prize-fighter,
and in growing fifteen years in as
many minutes before your eyes.
â– "She" was the lady of aesthetic and
ultra-spiritual grace, and woman-of
the-Ivensington-World alternately, and
with almost no preparation whatever
Miss A. ISllerbeck, '08, played this re
markable Shavian role almost as per
fectly as she looked it. "Her Hus
band," the third character in the play,
was very well done by R. Wood
ville, '11.
