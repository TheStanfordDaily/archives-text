# BIG CROWD IS WANTED
## COMMITTEE DESIRES LARGE ATTENDANCE AT BENEFIT. Program Is an Exceptional One and Will Begin at 7:30.—Ten Numbers Included. 
### 
All is in readiness for the vaudeville
track fund benefit which will be held
on Stanford Field to-morrow night
at 7:30. Talent has been volunteered
from practically every division of the
community and the show will be one
of the best and most entertaining held
here in some time. The committee
which has had the affair in hand has
erected a platform stage on the field
at the west end and will string several
hundred electric globes.
The price of admission has been
fixed at the nominal sum of twenty
five cents and the committee has ex
pressed the wish that a large crowd
turn out, women being invited as well
as men, assuring that the performance
will be well worth seeing and will not
be dragged out but will proceed rap
idly from one number to another, tak
ing little over an hour and a half for
the complete rendering.
After a week of consistent work
the committee will be able to present
the following vaudeville program:
1. Selection by Stanford Band.

edy Company.
