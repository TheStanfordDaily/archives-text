# 1910 QUAD APPEARS
## JUNIOR ANNUAL IS AN ESPECIALLY GOOD EDITION. Art Work Ranks Book as One of Best Ever Published.—Carefully Edited. 
### 
It has appeared on the campus as
advertised, been laughed over and ad
mired and is truly a remarkable
book. Under normal conditions the
1910 Quad would be highly creditable
duced. Considering the difficulties at
tendant to publication it is especially
noteworthy. In the tone of excellence,
made evident by the careful arrange
ment of matter, selection and placing
of cuts, pains taken in binding and gen
eral conscientious effort represented,
the 1910 Quad excells rather than in
ovations. Under this summation the
book qualifies as a true Stanford Quad,
perpetuating and improving all that
has been found good in former edi
tions.
The 1910 Quad will hold its posi
tion among the other annuals of the
University principally for the excel
lent art work. Tn this respect it is
several years ahead of any past edi
tion. Cuts have been used wherever
it was possible and the addition of five
colored plates is an innovation which
is more than distinctive. The art work
is not only noticeable because of the
amount and excellence, but because
of the representative source. It ap
pears that practically every artist in
college is represented.
Athletically, the Quad treats of the
past season in a creditable manner.
Stanford did not make as good a
record during the year reviewed as
the seasons of 1907-08. but the events
are well written and the cuts clear
and well selected. Tn the clearness
of the reproductions the Quad is par
ticularly fortunate.
The arrangement of the 1910 Quad
is good. This is noticeable in the
segregation of the women's depart
ments from those of tho men and the
placing of the College Year section
toward the front and the relegation
of the mere statistical matter to place •
of lesser importance.
The literary department is worthy
of favorable comment. The repre
sentative graduate authors who have
contributed, make tho book addition
ally valuable. This department is one
which has, perhaps, never included
a better list of storie:- and article;;.
The joshes of the 1 r )10 Quad are
numerous and are distinctive beeauxe
of the fact that the Faculty has l:e ]
left, entirely ont of the book. The
bitting personal stalls are also a neg
ligible quantity which speaks well for
the judgment of those in charge and
will give more durable properties.
In size and evident outlay of money
the 1910 Quad is slightly ahead of the
hooks of former classes. Its general
appearance is favorable, though per
haps the cover design is not quite as
effective as that, of some past editions.
It, is a well bound edition and one
which will bear handling in a much
greater degree than the ordinary run
of Quads.
