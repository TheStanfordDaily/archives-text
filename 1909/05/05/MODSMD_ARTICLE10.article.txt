## 
### 
Delta Kappa Epsilon defeated Kappa
Sigma in baseball yesterday by the
score of 8 to 5. This is the last game
of the semi-finals of the interfrater
nity series. The batteries for the
game were: Delta Kappa Epsilon—
Scott, Sampson and Richardson; Kap
pa Sigma—Ball and Mac Comber.
As a result of this game the struggle
for the championship lies between
Delta Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsi
lon. This will probably lie played on
Friday.
