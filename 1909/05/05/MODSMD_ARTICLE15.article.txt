By way of becoming better ac
quainted and fostering the best of
interclass spirit, the men of the Soph
omore and Freshman classes held a
joint camp-fire smoker and ,iolly-up
near the football field late yesterday
evening. A big feed was the feature
of the nocturnal fun, although a jol\\3
time was spent around the fire in
singing college songs, giving yells, and
doing stunts. Such an enjoyable time
was spent by the 250 men present tliat
; many favored the holding' of snc h an
affair annually by the Underclassmen.
