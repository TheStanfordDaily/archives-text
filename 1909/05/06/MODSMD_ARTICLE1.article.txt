When interviewed to-day, Coach
Frank Mathieu said that the Senior
Class showed great wisdom in its
choice of a play. "The Liars" be con
siders the most brilliant play of mod
ern times. It. is a comedy of the
highest character and sparkles with
witty dialogue. It abounds in scenes
of a highly amusing and dramatic
character.
"The Liars" is a comedy of modern
social life and conditions in England.
A young wife, inclined to be frivolous
and flirtatious, commences a flirta
tion with a man whose attentions to
ward her are most serious. This
leads to complications which the lady's
intimate circle of friends attempt to
straighten out by a long system of
lies. The most amusing situation is
in the third act, where everyone as
sists in the telling of the lie. Serious
results are averted by the common
sense and advice of a mutual friend.
The reconciliation between the surly
husband, who promises to be more
cheerful and considerate In the future,
and his tharming wife, brings the
play to a logical and normal termina
tion.

made to the cast:
