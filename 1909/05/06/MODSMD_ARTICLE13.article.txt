# TEAM WILL GO EAST
## TRIP ASSUMED BY CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT. Quadrangle Club Donates $50.â€”Team Leaves May 22, Meeting Three Universities in Contests. 
### 
It has been definitely decided *to
send the track meet East to the Con
ference Meet in Chicago in June. Suf
ficient funds have been forthcoming
to guarantee the trip although not
enough has yet been secured to cover
the entire expense.
The Quadrangle Club last night
voted $50 towards the fund while the
Executive Committee at its meeting
yesterday decided to lend its assist
ance towards financing the trip. It
will allow the team all of the money
which is still oweing by members of
the football and track squads who
have not yet settled their accounts
with the training table. Captain Hor
ton wishes to announce that this
money will be gratefully received at
any tinje. The entertainment for the
benefit of the track team netted $188
and an outside donation of $20 has
been received. These various sums
in addition to the amounts which will
be received from the different dual
meets on the way assure the trip.
Training will start to-morrow and
the customary rules of the post-season
Rugby squad will be followed. The
men who will constitute the team are
as follows: ,T. O. Miller, '08, W. M.
Wyman, '11, D. P. Crawford, '09, L.
Scott, '10, and H. R. Stolz, '09. A
miler and two-miler who have not yet
been picked will fill out the team.
If sufficient funds are gathered to
gether, H. V. Poor, '10, will be taken
to compete in the high jump.
The meet with the Olympic Club
will take place in San Francisco on
May 22, and immediately following it
the team will leave for the East. On
the 26th a dual meet will be held at
Salt Lake City with the University of
Utah. During the ensuing week it is
likely that two meets will be held in
Colorado with the Universities of Den
ver and Colorado at Boulder.
As the meet with the Olympic Club
will be held only shortly after college
closes. Captain Morton states that any
one who has done track work will be
given a chance in this contest if they
commence training now. Horton de
sires that all men who will remain
at the university after the end of the
semester enter this meet.
From Eastern newspapers received
recently it is seen that there is some
posibility of including the relay race
in the point-winning events of the
Conference meet.
If this move is decided upon it will
be an advantage to the Varsity team
as it contains a group of quarter
milers as good if not better than the
average that holds in the Middle West
ern institutions.
