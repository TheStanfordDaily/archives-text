# Football the Only Paying Sport.

### 
Manager Stewart has prepared a
statement which shows the compara
tive receipts and disbursements ol' the
four branches of intercollegiate ath
letics. Football is the only money
making sport, all the rest causing
financial losses. Baseball is almost
self-supporting at present, and both it
and track would be so were it not
for the expense of coaches. The pur
chase of the new boat this year caused
crew which brings in no receipts to
have an exceptionally large disburse
ment.
The list, as compiled by Manager
Stewart is as follows:
