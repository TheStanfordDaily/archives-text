# APRIL ALUMNUS APPEARS.
## Issue Reviews Dramatics of the Year. May Issue Will Score the Sequoia's Policy. 
### 
The April issue of the Stanford
Alumnus appeared this week and is
on sale at the Stanford Bookstore.
The leading article reviews the dra
matic productions this year under the
caption "Over the Footlights at Stan
ford." Comment is made upon all the
plays given this year and comparisons
made with past work.
The May number of the Alumnus
will be issued early this month. The
principal article in this issue will deal
with the work of the Stanford pub
lications this year, and will estimate
the work and progress of the Daily,
Chaparral and Sequoia. One feature
of the article is a severe criticism of
the Sequoia's policy this year, which,
the articles declares, has not been a
credit to the University. The Se
quoia's editorial relative to the women
of the University and the busmen is
vigorously scored, the recent attack
on the Junior Opera is dealt with, and
the "socialistic tendency," as tho
Alumnus terms the Sequoia's policy,
is criticized. Other articles will deal
with the Stanford Union and the Alum
ni meeting during Senior Week.
