# SENIORS TO PLANT IVY SUNDAY.
## Ceremony Will Take Place at All Saints Church, Palo Alto, According to Custom. 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior Class,
held this afternoon, it was decided to
wear the caps and gowns on Com
mencement Day, Class Day and Bac
calaurate Sunday, instead of one day
as was previously voted. President
Coonan stated in view of the fact that
(he Engineers have decided not to
wear Cap and Gowns, that all other
students follow the custom, so as to
make as creditable a showing as pos
sible.
Instead of planting the Ivy on Bac
calaurate Sunday, as has been done in
the previous years, it was decided to
have the ceremony this Sunday, be
cause of the fact that the rector of
All Saints Church of Palo Alto is go
ing East. The planting will take place
at All Saints Church, Palo Alto, at
4 o'clock, and the Senior singing for
this week will be omitted.
