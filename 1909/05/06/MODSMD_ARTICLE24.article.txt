Professor A. G. Newcomer of the
English department has reviewed the
book as follows:
"This is a Stanford Fairy Book with
Stanford quite left out. Such, at any
rate, is the chief inmpression gained
by to hours' reading in its pages.
Apart from one essay, I think there is
not a student, not a professor, not
a fraternity pin, not the distant gleam
of a red tile, nor the faintest idea of
a college yell, between its red and
gray covers."
"Yet there is discreet variety of
matter for all tastes, and most fas
tidious should be able to find some
thing to suit. If you like a Bret Harte
lining camp, it is here. If you pre
fer an Italian villa, that is here also.
Or if you have never yet, seen an
automobile party precipitated into the
jiresence of St. Peter, you may have
hat novel pleasure. But, as intimated
above, Fairyland looms largest; and
if you wish t.o forget the distractions
of the day, take this book into a quiet
corner and you will have your wish.
"The poems, I suspect, are of the
kind to make the casual reader won
der why they were ever written. But
T trust I have been no casual reader.
I find them nearly all exceptionally
good, and one or two would do credit
to the most conservative mazagines
published to-day.
1 should be added that the tone of
the book is to a rare degree whole
some. The mere sentimentalist, or
the devotee of cleverness and sensa
tionalism. will not like it. To the
worldly minded it may seem a trifle
thin and airy. Yet airiness is better
than grossness,—it is one of the qual
ities of youth: and the book as a whole
is a valuable document to confirm our
faith in the essential nobleness of the
dreams of youth.
