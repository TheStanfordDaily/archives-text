## DANCE WILL BE EVENT SENIOR BALL COMMITTE PLANS LARGE FUNCTION. Supper to Be Served at the Inn. Table May Be Reserved by Parties of 4 and 8. 
### 
Arrangements are being rapidly
i completed for the Senior Ball, which
! will be given in Encina Clubroom on
Monday evening, May 17. This will
j be the last dance of the College year
and it is confidently expected that it
| will surpass all those whicli have been
held so far.
The committee in charge has spared
neither time nor expense in planning
| this function. It will mark the last
jof the dances given by the Class of
j 1909.
The grand march will start prompt
ly at 7:45, and it is hoped that all
dancers will be on the floor at that
time. Merzbach and Kamler's orches
tra of San Francisco will furnish the
music. The program will consist of
the latest song and dance music, in
terspersed with some of the older
favorites. The programs will be dis
tributed as soon as they are ready.
The contract for supper has been
given to Shelton & Shelton, and will
be served at the Inn after the last
dance. The wide porches of the lrn
[will be burlapped, so that the dancers
j can sit out in the air. The collation
j will be more elaborate than in former
years and during its service the or
chestra will render a program of pop
ular airs.
The committee has decided to re
serve a limited number of supper ta
bles seating four and eight people
for parties wishing them. These
tables may be reserved if the parties
will hand their names to the chair
man of the committee, who will make
proper arrangements. This is an en
tirely new innovation at Stanford, and
it is believed that, if will result in
I doing away with the unnecessary
rush from the dance to the supper
room. Unless tables are reserved,
couples will have to sit as they are
ushered, as it is only in this way that
confusion can be avoided.
According io custom, the commit
tee has decided to issue complimentary
tickets to the Student Body President,
the Class President, the President of
Encina Club, the Editor of The Daily
Palo Alto and the Class Treasurer.
Tickets are now on sale at he
Bookstore at live dollars each. All
I tickets must be presented at the door,
I as no one will be permitted to enter
without one. It is desired that all
who intend going purchase their tick
ets now, so that the committee can
finish their arrangements.
