# PROM TO BE ELABORATE
## UNPRECEDENTED ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR FESTIVITY. Senior Committee Guarantees Good Program for Tuesday Night, May 18. 
### 
Through the efforts of the members
of the Senior Prom Committee, the
final festivity of Senior Week will be
unprecedented in magnitude and ex
cellence. This Tuesday evening spent
on the Inner Quadrangle will be a
fitting close to the preceding week of
exercises' and various functions.
Arrangements have been made by
the Seniors in charge of the Prom
to have upon the Quadrangle a por
tion of one of the regimental bands
from the Presidio, in San Francisco.
This martial aggregation will consist
of sixteen pieces and will furnish the
music for the eighteen separate num
bers upon the program. A band of
this magnitude has never before ap
peared at a Senior Prom.,
One of the features of the evening
will consist of the booths, at which
refreshments are to be dispensed
throughout the festivity, every stand
containing some different refreshment
for the promenaders. There will be
ten booths all of which are to be under
the supervision of the various sorori
'ies.
The entire Inner Quadrangle is to
be enclosed, while it is the plan of
the committee to have the booths sit
uated in the various entrances into
that area from the Outer Quadrangle.
As a feature heretofore absent from
Senior Proms, decorations of different
kinds are to be used in making the
Quadrangle and the stands for the
| refreshments as attractive as possible
As an additional innovation, the
I Seniors who are managing the festiv
ity have provided for an extensive
j electrical lighting system for the oc
i casion, using in the construction of
: this some two hundred lights.
Souvenir programs, upon which the
; promenaders are to note their part
| ners for the eighteen separate prom
; enades, will be furnished for the
I entire festivity, as no admission is
jto be taken for attendance at the
| Prom.
Chairman Sampson has guaranteed
an unprecedented Prom surpassing in
| its introduction of innovations and
i elaborateness any function of this na
| lure that has ever been given here.
