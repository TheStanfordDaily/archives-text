# DECISION IS POSTPONED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TAKES NO ACTION ON BOATING. Status of Romg to Be Settled at Special Meeting.—Money Voted to Track Team. 
### 
The attention of the executive Com-
Imittee at (lie regular meeting last
evening was largely taken up with a
I discussion of the advisability of re
gaining boating as an intercollegiate
sport. This branch of athletics has
, presented such a serious financial
j problem during the past year that it
! lias been a matter of debate for some
jtime whether it would be possible to
continue rowing on a regular inter
collegiate status.
The lack of adequate facilities, the
physical strain on the men, the slight
degree in which the Student Body par
ticipates in the sport and the tendency
to specialize were advanced as argu
ments for the discontinuance of row
ing, but after a thorough discussion,
the matter was placed on the table
until a special meeting of the commit
tee on Thursday, May 13. A sub
committee composed of Manager J.
E. Stewart and R. H. Reynolds, '10,
was appointed by President Roth to
confer with the Faculty Committee on
this subject and that of retaining Dan
Murphy as coach if no change is made
in the status of rowing.
All the money owed on unsettled
training table accounts of this season's
track and football squads was voted
jto the fund for the Eastern trip of
the track team.
A resolution was passed that the
regular block "S" be retained as the
varsity emblem, but that varsity men
be allowed the privilege of wearing
their emblem on white sweater vests.
German "S" sewaters were voted tc
the four crew substitutes to be named
by Coach Murphy and Captain P ey _
nolds.
The following communication bear
ing on intercollegiate sports and espe
cially the rowing situation, was sub
mitted by D. F. Angell, chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee.
Secretary Executive Committee Asso
ciated Students, Stanford University.
Dear Sir:
I desire to submit to the Execu
tive Committee through you, certain
considerations touching the present
status of baseball and rowing at this
University.
BASE BALL
For a good many years prominent
Varsity ball players have been solic
ited to play during the summer on
town or commercial teams. In some
cases (he men have refused to play,
in some T have warned them against
playing and in some they have played
without my knowledge. From talks
wilh the men who have played on
these Summer teams, T have learned
that they sometimes received compen
sation for business employment and
played ball en Sundays. From corre
spondence which I have seen, T have
learned that the players sometimes
received salaried business positions to
3r wiih ;i bonus for playing ball,
lonally. I fail to see much differ
ence whether a ball player who sets
a summer business job as a player,
receives his salary from the manager
of the business house or from the
manager of the base ball team. It;
ise, I find that to protect the
ur standard of athletics in this
■rsity I shall have to take
stand which the Intercollegiate
erence Athletic Association have
d it. necessary to take; viz., to
regard men playing in games outside
Ihe University jurisdiction where gate
money is taken as having forfeited
their amateur standing. We cannot

tolerate a double standard of ama
teurism in the University—one stand
ard for ball players and another for
the rest of the teams. In addition, [
do not consider it. fair that candidates
for positions on the Varsity team who
do not or will not play on commercial
ized teams should have to compete
with men who directly or indirectly
receive compensation for playing ball
through the summer. There is no ob
jection to a man whose baseball abili
ties help to pay his way through the
University; there have been several
cases in the history of the University
of men who have in great part paid
their expenses by openly playing pro
fessional ball, and who, after gradua
tion, have entered on their chosen
vocations respected alike by faculty
and students. But of course these
men did not, for a moment imagine
they were eligible for varsity teams.
As against the above ruling it has
been urged that the result will be to
bar men from playing on their home
teams. It seems to me that this ar
gument has been somewhat over
worked: the men who have played
summer baseball have not, in many
cases played on home teams. For ex
ample, the so-called Coos Hay Brush
League circuit has for several years
been a resort of California ball play
ers, many of whom were not regis
tered in the colleges as coming from
the towns whose teams the players
represented.
I have been sorry to hear the ar
gument frequently used that so many
student ball players professionalize
themselves before coming to college
and that technical professionalization
in ball playing is in general, so com
mon it is more or less useless to at
tempt the requiring of the same stand
ard of amateurism in baseball that
obtains in other sports. If this is the
case, if baseball is so riddled with
professionalism that we cannot main
tain the same standard in the sport
that we have in other branches of ath
letics, then it seems to me that base
ball should be dropped from the list
of intercollegiate events. I hope that
no such treatment, will be required
for a game so intrinsically a fine sport
as baseball.
ROWING
I enclose with this a copy of a
communication from Dr. R. L. Wilbur
to Dr. Jordan. Ypu will note that Dr
Wilbur's opinion is to the effect that
in view of the physical disabilities
union? the boating men due to the
unfavorable conditions under which
boating is carried on at, Stanford, in
tercollegiate rowing be discontinued
until better facilities are within our
reach. The Faculty Athletic Commit
tee has for several years been sorry
to note the increase in expense and
in overspecialization of rowing. At
the same time the sport is in itself
so noble a one, and the character and
standing of the rowing men in the
college community was so high that
the Committee was very loath to ad
vise measures which might seem to
restrict rowing activity. But the
development of rowing at this Uni
versity during the past three years
has interfered with the health or
scholarship or both of the rowing men
to such an extent that I feel very
considerable changes must be made
in the regime if the sport is to con
tinue. In addition, boating has en
tered uiioii a stage which runs counter
to the athletic policy to which this
University is committed; viz., the
policy of a general participation in
sport. One of the main reasons for
dropping the old game of football at
this University was that what had
started as a sport had degenerated

into a more or less grinding and ex
hausting drill of relatively few men in
preparation for an intercollegiate con
test, and I fear that boating has be
gun to be subject to somewhat similar
conditions. The matter of expense is
one in which I am but indirectly con
cerned. I feel, however, 1 should em
phasize a fact which you of course
have already considered; viz., that
next year with track and football
taking place at Stanford, our income
in all probability, will be much less
than it was this year, and in case of
a rainy football day it would be very
much less.
1 have not been able to get the
Faculty Athletic Committee together
to take any formal action in the matter
of rowing, nor did 1 desire to take
any such action until the Committee
was in full possession of the facts in
the case. I would suggest the forma
tion of a sub-committee to confer with
the Faculty Committee to see what
steps should be taken to obviate the
present unfavorable conditions of the
sport; that is, in case the Executive
Committee feels warranted in appro
priating the funds necessary to carry
if on. T am
Very sincerely yours,
Frank Angel 1,
Chairman Faculty Athletic Com.
The following communication sub
mitted to President Jordan by Dr.
R. L. Wilbur lias been considered by
the Faculty Committee in their dis
cussion of boating and was submitted
to the Executive Committee for con
sideration in the discussion of the
status of boating as an intercollegiate
sport:
Dr. David Starr Jordan,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Dr. Jordan:
Before the end of the present
year, which will probably be the last
one in which I will practice medicine
on the Campus. I would like to call
your attention to the subject of inter
collegiate rowing. I speak merely as
a friend of the University, and in no
official capacity.
It is my professional opinion that
the influence of rowing upon the men
at Stanford, particularly under the dif
ficulties offered by the distance from
a proper stretch of water, is distinctly
bad. The amount of physical strain
is out of proportion to any benefit
gained. 1 have had the chance to ob
serve the effects of the athletic con
tests upon a considerable number of
the men over a series of years, and
in my opinion rowing, as carried on
here, has not had the advantages for
the individual that the other sports
have had, and has, on the contrary,
been of distinct disadvantage to a
number of the men undertaking it.
Recently five of the crew have been
critically ill as a direct result of the
recent intercollegiate contest, and one
of them is still in a dangerous con
dition.
1 would suggest that you investi
gate this matter, and call the atten
tion of the proper authorities to the
whole question of the desirability of
stopping intercollegiate rowing, at
least until such time as adequate
street-car or. other facilities permit
easier access to - a proper stretch of
water. Very truly yours,
(Signed) R. L. Wilbur.
