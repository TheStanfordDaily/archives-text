# DECISION IS POSTPONED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TAKES NO ACTION ON BOATING. Status of Romg to Be Settled at Special Meeting.â€”Money Voted to Track Team. 
### 
The attention of the executive Com-
Imittee at (lie regular meeting last
evening was largely taken up with a
I discussion of the advisability of re
gaining boating as an intercollegiate
sport. This branch of athletics has
, presented such a serious financial
j problem during the past year that it
! lias been a matter of debate for some
jtime whether it would be possible to
continue rowing on a regular inter
collegiate status.
The lack of adequate facilities, the
physical strain on the men, the slight
degree in which the Student Body par
ticipates in the sport and the tendency
to specialize were advanced as argu
ments for the discontinuance of row
ing, but after a thorough discussion,
the matter was placed on the table
until a special meeting of the commit
tee on Thursday, May 13. A sub
committee composed of Manager J.
E. Stewart and R. H. Reynolds, '10,
was appointed by President Roth to
confer with the Faculty Committee on
this subject and that of retaining Dan
Murphy as coach if no change is made
in the status of rowing.
All the money owed on unsettled
training table accounts of this season's
track and football squads was voted
jto the fund for the Eastern trip of
the track team.
A resolution was passed that the
regular block "S" be retained as the
varsity emblem, but that varsity men
be allowed the privilege of wearing
their emblem on white sweater vests.
German "S" sewaters were voted tc
the four crew substitutes to be named
by Coach Murphy and Captain P ey _
nolds.
The following communication bear
ing on intercollegiate sports and espe
cially the rowing situation, was sub
mitted by D. F. Angell, chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee.

Dear Sir:
I desire to submit to the Execu

considerations touching the present
status of baseball and rowing at this

BASE BALL
For a good many years prominent
Varsity ball players have been solic
ited to play during the summer on
town or commercial teams. In some
cases (he men have refused to play,
in some T have warned them against
playing and in some they have played
without my knowledge. From talks
wilh the men who have played on
these Summer teams, T have learned
that they sometimes received compen
sation for business employment and
played ball en Sundays. From corre
spondence which I have seen, T have
learned that the players sometimes
received salaried business positions to
