With this, the last regular issue of
The Daily Palo Alto for the semester,
the present editor feels grateful for
the opportunity which the four years
now completed have allowed him to
associate with the men who have di
rected its affairs and those who have
so willingly and conscientiously given
their time to make the paper what
it is.
It is with a feeling of satisfaction
that we relinquish the chair. All in
dications point to a brilliant future for
this University. The semester draw
ing to a close has seen the installa
tion of several innovations by the
administrative officers of the Univer
sity which can not but help to work
for the end of harmony and achieve
ment. In this we are glad. It has
always been our policy to further this
end.
Again, in more strictly Student Body
matters the even tenor of prosperity
and unity has not been broken, but
rather strengthened. The Student
Body financially is upon a sound basis
and is in good hands for the coming
yeaT. As the organ of the Student
Body it has been the endeavor of
The Daily Palo Alto to represent its
interests fairly.
These enumerated causes for satis
faction should alone he sufficient for
a retiring editor, but the knowledge
that in turning over the reins of office
to C. H. Hails, we place the control
in one so eminently fitted, the grati
fication is made more complete. Mr.
Hails has the confidence of the Stu
dent Body and has demonstrated his
ability as former editors seldom have
an opportunity, lie will have a Staff
which is exceptional. To the mem
bers of the Staff and to the new edi
tor must he accredited to a large
extent any success The Daily Palo
Alto may have achieved this semester.
