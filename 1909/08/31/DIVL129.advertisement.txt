"Value Received!"
VALUE RECEIVED"
170 University Ave. Phone 200
INCE its birth our business has given "VALl'E
RECEIVED"
JOGGERY on an article means merit.
ALWAYS striking, always up-to-date, always
natty.
NEVER sloppv, never shoddy, never "near"
right.
FOREVER ill the lead in style, in "zip"' and
"ziin."
Ol'K stock dictates price; we buy the best goods;
we give absolutely fair values.
REMEMBER, that we have had years of experi
ence in Kollege KutKoat Shirts.
DON'T fail to drop in and see our new Fall
Styles.
