# CREW WINS REGATTA
## WASHINGTON DEFEATED IN EXCITING CONTEST. In North Rough Weather Prevents Fast Time Being Made. 
### 
The Stanford oarsmen were vic
torious over those of the I niversity ot
Washington in the annual race on
Lake Michigan for the coast champion
ship, in tlie prettiest race seen in the
west. The boats alternately took the
lead until the last, mile when the
Stanford shell shot to the trout where
it remained till the finish.
Although scheduled for May 2H, the
regatta was postponed until June I
tin account of the extreme roughness
of the water. The starter's gun
sounded at ">::1S in the evening after
the crews had waited all afternoon for
the wind to die down.
The sty rt was good, both crews
catching the water at the same time.
Stanford immediately took the lead
with Ms strokes t<> the minute, hut
gradually slowed down to 3t> until ;it
the end of the first mile both crews
were almost on a parity, Washington
having a slight lead.
Increasing their stroke again to lis,
the varsity shell forged ahead at the
end of the second mile, but the north
ern crew answered the challenge with
a marvelous burst of speed regaining
the lost ground. Again increasing the
stroke, which was now 40 to the min
ute, the Cardinal crew drew away from
their rivals who were unable to re
spond to the rally and could not force
their stroke above 34 to the minute.
The varsity then drew away until on
crossing the line three lengths of
clear water separated the two boats.
The victory was a decisive one, al
though the time, 19:40, was compara
tively slow. Wind and rough water
retarded the boats to a great degree.
The Stanford crew was especially
handicapped by heavy swells coming
from the wake of excursion launches,
thus neutralizing any advantage ob
tained through having the heavier
crew to steady the boat in rough
water. Stanford averaged twenty
pounds to the man heavier than
Washington.
The men who composed the vic
torious crew were: How. J. Killian,
11; No. 2, N. M. Day, '11; No. 3,
H. Seward. '12; No. 4, R. Gilmore, '12;
No. ft, L. Du Hoise, '10; No. H. .1. Part
ridge, '12; No. 7, .1. Huston, '10:
