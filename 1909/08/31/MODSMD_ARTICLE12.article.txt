The Freshman number, the initial
j appearance of the Chapparal under the
: new regimes was placed on sale on the
i Quad to-day and is fully up to the
I old standard.
The art work is a noteworthy fea
| ture, especially the full page draw
i ing by Virgil Bellows, '09, entitled
| "Grace Notes." This drawing is dis-
I tinctly original and is probably the
i best that has appeared in a college
j publication for years.

kind containing words of advice to
Freshmen and a statement of the pa
per's policy. Matthias, '11, Bliven, '11.
