# SEQUOIA TO APPEAR TO-MORROW.
## First Issue of the Semester Will Show Marked Change in all Parts the Magazine. 
### 
The first issue of the Stanford
Sequoia is to appear to-morrow.
Editor E. M. Leaf, '10, announces that
from now on the paper is to differ
radically from its old style in form,
contents and policy. It is to be
printed in single columns on Sepia
tinted paper and will contain many
cuts and half-tones, and will widen its
field rather than remain a strictly lit
erary publication.
In to-morrow's issue L. S. Scott, '10.
will tell the story of the track team's
trip to Chicago, the article being il
lustrated by photographs of the Con
ference meet.
An account of the crew's victory in
the North is contributed by J. Huston,
'10,. There will also be an article
entitled "Student Advisor â€”the Office
and the Man," by C. H. Hails, '10. A
criticism of the policy of the honor
societies at Stanford will conclude the
number. The editorial section will
consist mainly of an outline of the
magazine's new policy, but there will
also be a few words urging a large
attendance at football practices this
semester.
