# TRACK TEAM IS STRONG IN WESTERN CONFERENCE
## Varsity Takes Second Place in Chicago Contest. Five First Places Taken in Close Competition. 
### 
The Stanford Track Team, composed
of eight men, and captained by II L.
Morton, made a splendid showing
| throughout the middle-western states
during the past summer. The team
was under a great handicap, owing
to their lack of numbers and conse
quent inability to place more than one
or two men in each event, but this
handicap was offset by the splendid
individual performances of each man.
The most important contest entered

by the team was the meet held on
Marshall Field in Chicago, under the
auspices of the Intercollegiate Con
ference Association. The Stanford
squad took second place in this meet,
scoring a total of twenty-eight points
as against thirty-six. made by the Uni
versity of Illinois which succeeded in
carrying off first honors. Crawford
and Miller were the stars of tlie meet,
and tied at ten points each for the
highest individual point-winner, l-'ive
first places were taken by Stanford
I men. Miller winning the 440-yard dash
j and the half-mile run. Crawford the
j shot-put and hammer-throw, and Scott
| the pole-vault. No records were
broken although Crawford came within
two and one-quarter inches of equal
j ling the mark of forty-six feet, ten
inches in the shot-put set by Ralph
{Rose. A victory in the mile relay
race would have given Stanford the
I meet, but Illinois gained too much of
a lead in the first two laps to be caught
by Miller and Wyman in the next
j two rounds. An unfortunate feature
of the trip was the fact that Reed
broke down before reaching Chicago
and was not able to compete in the
dashes. The most spectacular feature
| of the Chicago contest was Miller's
sensational finish in the half after he
had already won the quarter in fast
time.
Itefore leaving for the east the team
| held a dual meet, with the Olympic

Club team on the Fniversity of Cali
fornia oval. The feature of the day
was the much-heralded half-mile race
between Miller and Glamor of the
Olympics. .Miller ran darner off his
feet in this event and lowered his own
coast record to 1 :~>7.1. Reed won the
two-twenty yard dash, Wynian the
four-forty and Scott the pole-vault.
The proceeds of this meet went into
the fund gathered together to send the
Stanford men to Chicago.

Two stops were made on the east
ward journey to enable the Stanford
men to meet the athletes of Brigham
Young University at Provo, Utah, and
the University of Colorado team at
Moulder. The first meet resulted in
a victory for Stanford by a score of
sixty-nine and one-fifth to fifty and
one-half. Worthington performed well
in winning both the mile and two-mile
runs. Reed was also a star as he
won the short dash in the excellent
time of ten Hat. Miller won the low
hurdle race and Crawford took second
in the shorter hurdle event. Stanford
won the relay race with a team com
posed of Arrel. Wyman, Miller and
Reed.
The meet between Stanford and the
University of Colorado which was held
on the twenty-ninth of May, proved
rather disastrous as far as future
prospects are concerned. Reed, who
was looked upon as a sure point
winner in the dashes at Chicago, broke
down in the htidred and was unable
to finish his race. The injury kept
him out of competition in the Confer
ence meet. Wyman took lirst in the
two-twenty and four-forty and Craw
ford captured first place in the discus
and hammer-throws and second in the
shot-put, Wyman broke the tape in
the two-twenty in the fast time of
twenty-three seconds flat. Miller
again ran in the two hundred and

twenty yard hurdle race and added
three points to Stanford's total score.
The final score was Stanford 55, Uni
versity of Colorado 62.
As ;i, result of the fact that the Colo
rado met. was not sanctioned by the
local representatives of the A. C. U. (
the Stanford team was disqualified
from competition in the Chicago meet.
This disqualification was removed
shortly afterward by the efforts of
the P. A. hoard in San Francisco,
and no Interference was made with
the original entries.
The team was accompanied on the
trip by Trainer Moulton, who was
very much gratified with the results of
the meets. Seven men made the en
tire .journey, and Stolz, the eighth man,
met the team in Chicago where h
entered the Conference meet.

The Stanford Track Team, composed
of eight men, and captained by II L.
Morton, made a splendid showing
| throughout the middle-western states
during the past summer. The team
was under a great handicap, owing
to their lack of numbers and conse
quent inability to place more than one
or two men in each event, but this
handicap was offset by the splendid
individual performances of each man.
The most important contest entered

by the team was the meet held on
Marshall Field in Chicago, under the
auspices of the Intercollegiate Con
ference Association. The Stanford
squad took second place in this meet,
scoring a total of twenty-eight points
as against thirty-six. made by the Uni
versity of Illinois which succeeded in
carrying off first honors. Crawford
and Miller were the stars of tlie meet,
and tied at ten points each for the
highest individual point-winner, l-'ive
first places were taken by Stanford
I men. Miller winning the 440-yard dash
j and the half-mile run. Crawford the
j shot-put and hammer-throw, and Scott
| the pole-vault. No records were
broken although Crawford came within
two and one-quarter inches of equal
j ling the mark of forty-six feet, ten
inches in the shot-put set by Ralph
{Rose. A victory in the mile relay
race would have given Stanford the
I meet, but Illinois gained too much of
a lead in the first two laps to be caught
by Miller and Wyman in the next
j two rounds. An unfortunate feature
of the trip was the fact that Reed
broke down before reaching Chicago
and was not able to compete in the
dashes. The most spectacular feature
| of the Chicago contest was Miller's
sensational finish in the half after he
had already won the quarter in fast
time.
Itefore leaving for the east the team
| held a dual meet, with the Olympic

Club team on the Fniversity of Cali
fornia oval. The feature of the day
was the much-heralded half-mile race
between Miller and Glamor of the
Olympics. .Miller ran darner off his
feet in this event and lowered his own
coast record to 1 :~>7.1. Reed won the
two-twenty yard dash, Wynian the
four-forty and Scott the pole-vault.
The proceeds of this meet went into
the fund gathered together to send the
Stanford men to Chicago.

Two stops were made on the east
ward journey to enable the Stanford
men to meet the athletes of Brigham
Young University at Provo, Utah, and
the University of Colorado team at
Moulder. The first meet resulted in
a victory for Stanford by a score of
sixty-nine and one-fifth to fifty and
one-half. Worthington performed well
in winning both the mile and two-mile
runs. Reed was also a star as he
won the short dash in the excellent
time of ten Hat. Miller won the low
hurdle race and Crawford took second
in the shorter hurdle event. Stanford
won the relay race with a team com
posed of Arrel. Wyman, Miller and
Reed.
The meet between Stanford and the
University of Colorado which was held
on the twenty-ninth of May, proved
rather disastrous as far as future
prospects are concerned. Reed, who
was looked upon as a sure point
winner in the dashes at Chicago, broke
down in the htidred and was unable
to finish his race. The injury kept
him out of competition in the Confer
ence meet. Wyman took lirst in the
two-twenty and four-forty and Craw

and hammer-throws and second in the
shot-put, Wyman broke the tape in

The Stanford Track Team, composed
of eight men, and captained by II L.
Morton, made a splendid showing
| throughout the middle-western states
during the past summer. The team
was under a great handicap, owing
to their lack of numbers and conse
quent inability to place more than one
or two men in each event, but this
handicap was offset by the splendid
individual performances of each man.
The most important contest entered

by the team was the meet held on
Marshall Field in Chicago, under the
auspices of the Intercollegiate Con
ference Association. The Stanford
squad took second place in this meet,
scoring a total of twenty-eight points
as against thirty-six. made by the Uni
versity of Illinois which succeeded in
carrying off first honors. Crawford
and Miller were the stars of tlie meet,
and tied at ten points each for the
highest individual point-winner, l-'ive
first places were taken by Stanford
I men. Miller winning the 440-yard dash
j and the half-mile run. Crawford the
j shot-put and hammer-throw, and Scott
| the pole-vault. No records were
broken although Crawford came within
two and one-quarter inches of equal
j ling the mark of forty-six feet, ten
inches in the shot-put set by Ralph
{Rose. A victory in the mile relay
race would have given Stanford the
I meet, but Illinois gained too much of
a lead in the first two laps to be caught
by Miller and Wyman in the next
j two rounds. An unfortunate feature
of the trip was the fact that Reed
broke down before reaching Chicago
and was not able to compete in the
dashes. The most spectacular feature
| of the Chicago contest was Miller's
sensational finish in the half after he
had already won the quarter in fast
time.
Itefore leaving for the east the team
| held a dual meet, with the Olympic

Club team on the Fniversity of Cali
fornia oval. The feature of the day
was the much-heralded half-mile race
between Miller and Glamor of the
Olympics. .Miller ran darner off his
feet in this event and lowered his own
coast record to 1 :~>7.1. Reed won the
two-twenty yard dash, Wynian the
four-forty and Scott the pole-vault.
The proceeds of this meet went into
the fund gathered together to send the
Stanford men to Chicago.

Two stops were made on the east
ward journey to enable the Stanford
men to meet the athletes of Brigham
Young University at Provo, Utah, and
the University of Colorado team at
Moulder. The first meet resulted in
a victory for Stanford by a score of
sixty-nine and one-fifth to fifty and
one-half. Worthington performed well
in winning both the mile and two-mile
runs. Reed was also a star as he
won the short dash in the excellent
time of ten Hat. Miller won the low
hurdle race and Crawford took second
in the shorter hurdle event. Stanford
won the relay race with a team com
posed of Arrel. Wyman, Miller and
Reed.
The meet between Stanford and the
University of Colorado which was held
on the twenty-ninth of May, proved
rather disastrous as far as future
prospects are concerned. Reed, who
was looked upon as a sure point
winner in the dashes at Chicago, broke
down in the htidred and was unable
to finish his race. The injury kept
him out of competition in the Confer
ence meet. Wyman took lirst in the
two-twenty and four-forty and Craw
ford captured first place in the discus
and hammer-throws and second in the
shot-put, Wyman broke the tape in
the two-twenty in the fast time of
twenty-three seconds flat. Miller
again ran in the two hundred and

twenty yard hurdle race and added
three points to Stanford's total score.
The final score was Stanford 55, Uni
versity of Colorado 62.
As ;i, result of the fact that the Colo
rado met. was not sanctioned by the
local representatives of the A. C. U. (
the Stanford team was disqualified
from competition in the Chicago meet.
This disqualification was removed
shortly afterward by the efforts of
the P. A. hoard in San Francisco,
and no Interference was made with
the original entries.
The team was accompanied on the
trip by Trainer Moulton, who was
very much gratified with the results of
the meets. Seven men made the en
tire .journey, and Stolz, the eighth man,
met the team in Chicago where h
entered the Conference meet.
