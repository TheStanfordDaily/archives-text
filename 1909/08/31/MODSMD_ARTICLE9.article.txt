With this issue the Daily Palo Alto
make.-; i: ; initial appearance for the
present semester. Seventeen years < f
existence as a college newspaper have
so firmly established its place as the
official organ of the Student, Body
that editorial announcement is no
longer a necessity. The history of
Ihe paper from ils inception has been
one of progress, and a long succession
of capable editors has placed the pub
lication high among the ranks of
American college dailies. Constant
improvement in the efficiency of the
news service has been directed to
ward the goal of furnishing the col
lege public with all the news in the
shortest possible time, li will be the
aim, as well as the duty, of the pres
ent staff to endeavor to maintain the
standard set in former years, making
what improvement has been suggested
by the experience of those who have
brought the paper to its present high
degree of efficiency.
Conservatism has been the key-note
to the editorial policy of the paper.
Nor would any radical change from
this established stand be satisfactory
to the Student Body. It is the aim of
the Daily Palo Alto to continue along
the lines so plainly marked by past
editors in dealing with subjects of
interest to the University. The edi
torial columns will seek to reflect the
best views of the Student Body, and
only in so far as the opinions ex
pressed are in accord with the senti
ment of the sober minded majority of
the undergraduates, will the paper
have fulfilled its place among Stan
ford activities.
