# GRATIFYING FINANCIAL RESULTS OF EASTERN TRIP.
## Larger Guarantees Expected for Track Meets with Middle Western Colleges Next Year. 
### 
A tentative report of (he expenses
of the recent, eastern tour of the track
team shows that the cost of the en
tire trip amounted to approximately
sixteen hundred dollars and fifty dol
lars. Of this amount all but ten
dollars has been collected, and prac
tically all bills connected with the trip
have been settled by Captain Horton.
The expenses show a material de
crease from those of the preceding
summer, and this fact augurs well for
the continuance of Stanford's partici
pation in the Western Conference
meets.
As a result of the success of this
year's track team in their meets with
the middle-western colleges it is very
probable that much larger guarantees
will be given by these institutions in
future years. Brigham Young Uni
versity guaranteed but two hundred
and fifty dollars for the last meet and,
owing to the fact that this sum was
absolutely necessary to aid in finan
cing the trip the offer was accepted.
The gate receipts of the meet at Provo
were very large, and those in charge
of the contest cleared about fifteen
hundred dollars. In the face of this
success they will probably double the
guarantee next year since Stanford
teams have proven to be great draw
ing cards in that part of the country
and good management coupled with
extensive advertising has produced
gcod financial results.
Another increase of guarantee is ex
pected from the University of Colo
rado if the Stanford team can arrange
to make their appearance at Boulder
at the time of the Commencement fes
tivities. This year it was found that,
owing to the inopportune time of the
meet, the gate receipts barely covered
expenses. However, at. a later date
the management believes that they
will be able to draw as large a crowd
'v : that which lias hitherto atended
the meets at Provo.
These facts indicate mifrh greater
success in the future and insure the
faking of a large number of men on
the Eastern tours. This will also
mean a victory in future Conference
meets as this year's team was handi
capped only by lack of men to take
second and third places.
