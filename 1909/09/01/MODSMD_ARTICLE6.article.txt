## "Twelfth Night" Will Be Stagged Under the Direction of Mathieu on September 25. 
### 
Saturday evening, September 25
has been definitely set as the date for
the performance of the laughable
Shakesperean comedy, "Twelfth
Night," which is to be staged under
the auspices of the English Club. The
members of (he cast, which was ten
tatively chosen last semester, as
sembled in the History building last
night for the first regular rehearsal.
Despite the fact that the comedy will
be presented at an unusually early
date, a finished production is assured,
the lines already having been mem
orized and all preparations being well
under way. Rehearsals will be held
every day from now until the date
set for the performance.
With the exception of E. R. Pol
hennis, '11, and C. M. Ballard, '11,
who were filling the parts of Sir
Andrew Aguecheck and Valentine, re
spectively, the entire cast as selected
last spring has returned to college,
and Coach F. L. Mathieu to-day an
nounced his final selections.
Chamberlain, '11, has been named
to fill the part of Sir Andrew, while
a successor to Ballard has not as yet
been chosen.
The English Club will spare neither
labor nor expense in making "Twelfth
Night" a notable event in the annals
of Stanford theatricals. It will be
the first local production at which no
old scenery will be used. New and
elaborate stage properties are now
being made expressly for the various
acts. The retention of F. L. Mathieu
as coach in charge of the production
doubly insures its success. Not only
has Mathieu had much experience in
supervising such favorably remem
bered local plays as "His Excellency,
the Governor," "7-20-8" and"The
Liars," but he has also coached many
important theatricals in San Fran
cisco. During the past summer he
had full charge of the famous Bohe
mian .links.
