# TO REGULATE HAZING
## SUPERVISION OF ALL UNDERCLASS CONTESTS IN FUTURE. Committee of Upperclassmen Adopt Resolutions Seeking to Secure Better Regulation. 
### 
At a meeting of a committee of
upperclassmen called this morniii ; . by
Student Advisor A. E. Roth, the ques
tion of hazing and rushes between the
two lower classes was discussed and
a resolution drawn up expressing the
sentiment of the committee on the
subject.
The calling together of this commit
tee came as the result of an effort
by the Student Advisor to obtain some
means of securing upperclass super
vision of whatever clashes occur be
tween the Sophomores and Freshmen.
The control and regulation of hazing
has as yet been left in the hands of
the students by the members of the
Student Affairs Committee, and it is
the plan of the committee to secure
a more effective supervision of the
conduct of underclassmen in order to
retain this privilege which is one of
the steps toward student government.
While this action should properly
have fallen within the province of the
University Conference the fact that
the majority of that body was gradu
ated in the spring and no election has
yet been held for this semester, caused
the members of the Conference to as
sociate themselves with the general
committee for this purpose.
The resolution stating the senti
ments to which the committee desires
to call attention is as follows:
"It is desirable to call the attention
of the underclassmen to the existence
of certain traditions which have been
partially lost sight of during late years
and to formulate some expression of
upperclass sentiment on the question
of so-called "hazing stunts" and un
derclass rushes.
"The control and regulation of these
matters has always been the prerog
tive of upperclassmen, and we wish to
call attention to the fact that they
are responsible in seeing that all ob
jectionable features in present or fu
ture conditions are eradicated.
"We believe that it is the sense of
the upperclassmen that any treatment
of Freshmen which is dangerous or
which amounts to the bullying of an
innocent person or his continuous
humiliation is unmanly and not in
accordance with Stanford ideals.
"The practice of men from all parts
of the campus carrying on stunts or
participating in a rush at Encina is
undesirable since it forces the officials
of the Hall in whose hands the stu
dent control of the Hall has been
placed, to deal with men over whom
they have no jurisdiction and with
whom they are not acquainted.
"Another objectionable feature is
found in the matter of the campus
Sophomores visiting Palo Alto or Col
lege Terrace in a body and creating
a disturbance in public places or in
private boarding houses.
"When the regular Sophomore-
Freshman rush was introduced, it was
with the understanding that all other
contests between the two classes
should cease as soon as the official
rush was concluded. We wish to call
the attention of the underclassmen
to this tradition ancl ask that it lie
respected. After this date rushes in
terfere with athletics and prevent the
men from getting settled in their work,
while by intimidation the Freshmen
are prevented from participating in
student life as they might otherwise
do."

At a meeting of a committee of
upperclassmen called this morniii ; . by
Student Advisor A. E. Roth, the ques
tion of hazing and rushes between the
two lower classes was discussed and
a resolution drawn up expressing the
sentiment of the committee on the
subject.
The calling together of this commit
tee came as the result of an effort
by the Student Advisor to obtain some
means of securing upperclass super
vision of whatever clashes occur be
tween the Sophomores and Freshmen.
The control and regulation of hazing
has as yet been left in the hands of
the students by the members of the
Student Affairs Committee, and it is
the plan of the committee to secure
a more effective supervision of the
conduct of underclassmen in order to
retain this privilege which is one of
the steps toward student government.
While this action should properly
have fallen within the province of the
University Conference the fact that
the majority of that body was gradu
ated in the spring and no election has
yet been held for this semester, caused
the members of the Conference to as
sociate themselves with the general
committee for this purpose.
The resolution stating the senti
ments to which the committee desires
to call attention is as follows:
"It is desirable to call the attention
of the underclassmen to the existence
of certain traditions which have been
partially lost sight of during late years
and to formulate some expression of
upperclass sentiment on the question
of so-called "hazing stunts" and un
derclass rushes.
"The control and regulation of these
matters has always been the prerog
tive of upperclassmen, and we wish to
call attention to the fact that they
are responsible in seeing that all ob
jectionable features in present or fu
ture conditions are eradicated.
"We believe that it is the sense of
the upperclassmen that any treatment
of Freshmen which is dangerous or
which amounts to the bullying of an
innocent person or his continuous
humiliation is unmanly and not in
accordance with Stanford ideals.
"The practice of men from all parts
of the campus carrying on stunts or
participating in a rush at Encina is
undesirable since it forces the officials
of the Hall in whose hands the stu
dent control of the Hall has been
placed, to deal with men over whom
they have no jurisdiction and with
whom they are not acquainted.
"Another objectionable feature is
found in the matter of the campus
Sophomores visiting Palo Alto or Col
lege Terrace in a body and creating
a disturbance in public places or in
private boarding houses.
"When the regular Sophomore-
Freshman rush was introduced, it was
with the understanding that all other
contests between the two classes
should cease as soon as the official
rush was concluded. We wish to call
the attention of the underclassmen
to this tradition ancl ask that it lie
respected. After this date rushes in
terfere with athletics and prevent the
men from getting settled in their work,
while by intimidation the Freshmen
are prevented from participating in
student life as they might otherwise
do."
