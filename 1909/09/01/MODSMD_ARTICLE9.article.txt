Every man now in attendance at
the University should be present at
the Rugby rally in Encitia Hall to
morrow evening. Stanford's success
on the gridiron during the last few
years has been due not only to the
ability of her players but also to the
exceptional spirit, of the undergrad
uates behind those players. Both ele
ments are essential to success. The
rally on Thursday is intended primar
ily as a suitable vehicle for the de
monstration of spirit and enthusiasm.
It is then that the student body must
show l lie football men how tremend
ous is the support to be accorded
them, and to-morrow night should
prove that an undying fighting spirit
is to pervade the men on the bleachers.
We know enough of Coach Presley to
feel assured that such a spirit will
pervade the men on the field.
The movement to regulate hazing
stunts, as inaugurated by the com
mittee of upperclassmen to-day should
receive the attention and serious con
sideration of all undergraduates. Al
though opposed to all forms or hazing,
the Committee on Student Affairs has
placed the responsibility for its regu
lation entirely in the hands of the I
students themselves. If this privilege j
is properly accepted and an efficient !
and thorough supervision of all under- !
dent class contests is maintained, the |
Student Body will have made an im
portant step in the direction of stu
dent control, while a failure to take
advantage of the opportunity thus of
fered can but result in retrogression
instead of progress.
In order to effectively regulate ex
isting conditions or correct future
tendencies, it will be necessary for
upperclassmen as well as Sophomores
and Freshmen to do their part. It j
has been a tradition at Stanford,
though in late years not sufficiently I
observed, that upperclassmen. and '
preferably Seniors, should supervise
tlie actions of Sophomores in al!
clashes between the two lower classes. I
This tradition should be respected.
Upperclassmen should hold them
selves responsible for the actions of
the men of the lower classes while
the Sophomores and Freshmen should !
respect this authority and confine
their activities in the matter of class
rivalry to such practices as have the
sanction of upperclassmen.
It is not. the object of the resolu- j
tions adopted to prevent any si rug ;!" j
between the classes which may result i
from class rivalry, but rather to keep
such contests within the proper
bounds and prevent the persecution
and bullying of any individual by a

| thoughtless throng of Sophomores
where excessive zeal may result in
j injury. Only by the absence of such
excess can harmony li.e preserved.
It is especially necessary at thi:
time lo caution the Sophomore
against, any continuation of inlerclas:
contests after the regular Sophomore-
Freshman rush which is to finally do
cide class supremacy. This institu
tion was granted only on condition
that it mark the culmination o< ail
underclass contests and any deviation
from such a policy would he a dis
tinct breach of the pledge made at
that time.
Another tradition of which mention
might now be apropos is that which
decrees that Sophomores shall in no
way interfere with the freedom of a
Freshman on the night ot th>- rally.
Every man in the entering class may
feel free to attend the gathering to
morrow niglit with the assurance that
he will not be molested in any way
