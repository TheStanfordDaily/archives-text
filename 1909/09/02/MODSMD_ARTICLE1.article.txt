# HOLD RUSH TOMORROW
## ANNUAL UNDER-CLASS CONTEST FOR SUPREMACY AT 4:30 Tie-Up Will Take Place on Varsity Field. Change in Rules Will Affect Outcome. 
### 
The annual Sophomore-Freshman
rush will take place to-morrow after
noon at 4:30. The contest will be held
on the Varsity turf field, and will com
mence promptly at the time set.
In ordet to facilitate the opening oi
hostilities between the two classes,
the committee ol tipper-classmen in
charge of the rush have decided to
make a slight departure from the
rules governing last year's contest.
The classes will form in front of their
opponent's "morgues," instead of their
own as was the case last year. This
will obviate the unnecessary dela\
caused by the men attempting to re
main near their respective "morgues."
and will obviously give the advan
tage to the class that, rushes.
G. J. Presley has been selected as
"Referee," and desires all the officials
to be on the field at 4 o'clock to dis
cuss khe rules. All contestants are
requested to wear light shoes, tennis
shoes if possible.
