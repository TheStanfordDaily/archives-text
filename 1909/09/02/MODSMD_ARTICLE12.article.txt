The Sophomore-Freshman rush has
apparently become firmly established
as a Stanford custom. As a means
of settling the petty outbreaks of class
jealousy in one final struggle for su
premacy the organized rush is deser
ving of perpetuation. But unless the
rush marks the culmination of all hos
tilities between the classes its purpose
will have been defeated and there will
no longer be any excuse for its exis
tence. No aftermath of to-morrow's
contest should be tolerated by either
class.
When the whistle blows to-morrow
afternoon both classes will be on the
field in force and prepared to battle
hard to secure the victory. The strug
gle will in all probability be severe
and vigorous from the start. In the
excitement of the contest things are
often done which would never have
been attempted after sober reflection.
Each individual should remember that
even in this "rough and tumble"
struggle, he is on his honor to fight
fairly and squarely. In the rush of
last year there occurred instances
where a man was choked almost to
insensibility in order that he might
be tied more quickly. Such things are
worse than cowardly and no amount
of eagerness to win should cause a
Stanford man to adopt such tactics to
score a victory. Neither is it con
sistent with the best ideals of Stan
ford's honor for those who have been
captured and putin the "morgues" to
escape and again participate in the
contest. This was done by a score or
more last year, but should never oc
cur again. The officials are there to 1
see fair play, but the sentiment of j
the contestants themselves should
render any use of authority unnec
essary.
