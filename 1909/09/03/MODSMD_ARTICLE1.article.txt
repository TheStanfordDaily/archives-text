###

the present year last night at En
cina. Although the greater part of
the time was devoted to acquainting
the new members with the financial
condition of the Student Body and
outlining the policy of the committee
for the coming year, several matters
of considerable interest were dis
cussed.
The question of the future status
of rowing as a Varsity sport, which
was laid on tlie table last year, was
brought forward and received careful
consideration. The proposition to
place rowing on a $1,000 basis, limit

to maintain during the past year

amount.

curred by F. L. Wilde, '10, during
his illness caused by overtraining,

sity football field for the senior circus
