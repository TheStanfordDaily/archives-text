# SPIRITED RALLY OPENS FOURTH RUGBY SEASON
## Enrollment of Almost Two Hundred Men in Football Squads Exceeds All Figures of Previous Years. 
### 
Ail records were shattered at. the
Rugby rally in Encina Club Room
yesterday evening when 192 men
1 signed the roll for football practice.
This tremendous enrollment was but
a fitting climax to the enthusiastic
spirit which the Student Body exhib
ited throughout the entire affair. An
ovation was accorded each of the
speakers in turn, and the yelling was
j fiery.
The unavoidable absence of Captain
Mitchell and Dr. Angell left three men
to address the gathering: Coach Pres
| ley, Trainer Moulton and ex-Student
Body President Roth. Presley said in
part:
"Practice will begin on the supple
mentary field. Saturday afternoon at
4:45 sharp. We will commence with
| a Varsity squad and a Freshman
squad. As yet there will be no teams,
and every man will be given an equal
chance. Training rules will go into
effect when you get into your suits
on Saturday. Training rules mean in
J bed at 11 o'clock, no smoking, no
| drinking, and dancing, until further
notified, on Saturday nights only until
eleven.
"Seldom does a team win five con
secutive victories. Success depends
upon knowledge of the game, the ma
terial at hand and the spirit. We
have the knowledge of the game. We
also have good material. The old men
have shown that they will not hesi
tate to sacrifice everything to win. It
is for you to show the spirit.
"This year California has coaches
of experience, a large number of eli
gible veterans, and enough Freshmen
to compose two squads. But if every
man who can will come out and try,
and if every man who comes out will
work hard every minute of the time,
we will send those fellows back to
Berkeley and give them another year
to think it over."
Following are excerpts from the re
marks of ex-President, Roth who pre
ceded Presley:
"Four things are necessary to win
the big game. First, a good coach;
and certainly we have had that, during
the last four years. To-day we have
I the best coach on the coast. Second,
| a good trainer. We have the best, in
t lie United States. Third, men: and
wo do not have to fear on that score.
Lastly, spirit. It is against over con
! ndence that our greatest fight must
j be made. But if every fellow will try
;for the team or support the team, we
| will win again."
"Dad" Moulton, who was the final
j speaker, said in part:
"It's up to every man to come out
j and try. If a man hasn't the nerve
to try here, he will never make good
anywhere. It. does not matter if you
do not know the game. The coach
; is there to Jeach it to you. Training
oommenres when your uniform goes
on, and training is a religion with us.
The only way is to beat California
once more. It is too bad, but we have
j to do it."
I Following the rally, the Rugby can
i didates handed in their names to

Coach Presley. Of the 192 men to
sign up, 85 are eligible for the Fresh
man fifteen. In 1907, 100 joined the
squad, and of these about 75 were
first-year students, while in 1908 the
total of 145 was divided almost evenly
between old men and Freshmen.
Manager Burbank yesterday com
pleted the details of an important
change in the Rugby schedule. Ow
ing to a financial disagreement be
tween Burbank and the. manager of
the University of Nevada team, the
two games with that institution were
cancelled. As an alternative the Var
sity will journey to Los Angeles and
meet the Castaways in that city on
October 215, the Castaways coming
north to play on Stanford field one
week later. Besides the three famous
Higgins brothers, the southern fifteen
boasts in its line-up L. M. Edwards,
'07, and D. G. Heinly, ex-'O9.

Ail records were shattered at. the
Rugby rally in Encina Club Room
yesterday evening when 192 men
1 signed the roll for football practice.
This tremendous enrollment was but
a fitting climax to the enthusiastic
spirit which the Student Body exhib
ited throughout the entire affair. An
ovation was accorded each of the
speakers in turn, and the yelling was
j fiery.
The unavoidable absence of Captain
Mitchell and Dr. Angell left three men
to address the gathering: Coach Pres
| ley, Trainer Moulton and ex-Student
Body President Roth. Presley said in
part:
"Practice will begin on the supple
mentary field. Saturday afternoon at
4:45 sharp. We will commence with
| a Varsity squad and a Freshman
squad. As yet there will be no teams,
and every man will be given an equal
chance. Training rules will go into
effect when you get into your suits
on Saturday. Training rules mean in
J bed at 11 o'clock, no smoking, no
| drinking, and dancing, until further
notified, on Saturday nights only until
eleven.
"Seldom does a team win five con
secutive victories. Success depends
upon knowledge of the game, the ma
terial at hand and the spirit. We
have the knowledge of the game. We
also have good material. The old men
have shown that they will not hesi
tate to sacrifice everything to win. It
is for you to show the spirit.
"This year California has coaches
of experience, a large number of eli
gible veterans, and enough Freshmen
to compose two squads. But if every
man who can will come out and try,
and if every man who comes out will
work hard every minute of the time,
we will send those fellows back to
Berkeley and give them another year
to think it over."
Following are excerpts from the re
marks of ex-President, Roth who pre
ceded Presley:
"Four things are necessary to win
the big game. First, a good coach;
and certainly we have had that, during
the last four years. To-day we have
I the best coach on the coast. Second,
| a good trainer. We have the best, in
t lie United States. Third, men: and
wo do not have to fear on that score.
Lastly, spirit. It is against over con
! ndence that our greatest fight must
j be made. But if every fellow will try
;for the team or support the team, we
| will win again."
"Dad" Moulton, who was the final
j speaker, said in part:
"It's up to every man to come out
j and try. If a man hasn't the nerve
to try here, he will never make good
anywhere. It. does not matter if you
do not know the game. The coach
; is there to Jeach it to you. Training
oommenres when your uniform goes
on, and training is a religion with us.
The only way is to beat California
once more. It is too bad, but we have
j to do it."
I Following the rally, the Rugby can
i didates handed in their names to

Coach Presley. Of the 192 men to
sign up, 85 are eligible for the Fresh
man fifteen. In 1907, 100 joined the
squad, and of these about 75 were
first-year students, while in 1908 the
total of 145 was divided almost evenly
between old men and Freshmen.
Manager Burbank yesterday com
pleted the details of an important
change in the Rugby schedule. Ow
ing to a financial disagreement be
tween Burbank and the. manager of
the University of Nevada team, the
two games with that institution were
cancelled. As an alternative the Var
sity will journey to Los Angeles and
meet the Castaways in that city on
October 215, the Castaways coming
north to play on Stanford field one
week later. Besides the three famous
Higgins brothers, the southern fifteen
boasts in its line-up L. M. Edwards,

Ail records were shattered at. the
Rugby rally in Encina Club Room
yesterday evening when 192 men
1 signed the roll for football practice.
This tremendous enrollment was but
a fitting climax to the enthusiastic
spirit which the Student Body exhib
ited throughout the entire affair. An
ovation was accorded each of the
speakers in turn, and the yelling was
j fiery.
The unavoidable absence of Captain
Mitchell and Dr. Angell left three men
to address the gathering: Coach Pres
| ley, Trainer Moulton and ex-Student
Body President Roth. Presley said in
part:
"Practice will begin on the supple
mentary field. Saturday afternoon at
4:45 sharp. We will commence with
| a Varsity squad and a Freshman
squad. As yet there will be no teams,
and every man will be given an equal
chance. Training rules will go into
effect when you get into your suits
on Saturday. Training rules mean in
J bed at 11 o'clock, no smoking, no
| drinking, and dancing, until further
notified, on Saturday nights only until
eleven.
"Seldom does a team win five con
secutive victories. Success depends
upon knowledge of the game, the ma
terial at hand and the spirit. We
have the knowledge of the game. We
also have good material. The old men
have shown that they will not hesi
tate to sacrifice everything to win. It
is for you to show the spirit.
"This year California has coaches
of experience, a large number of eli
gible veterans, and enough Freshmen
to compose two squads. But if every
man who can will come out and try,
and if every man who comes out will
work hard every minute of the time,
we will send those fellows back to
Berkeley and give them another year
to think it over."
Following are excerpts from the re
marks of ex-President, Roth who pre
ceded Presley:
"Four things are necessary to win
the big game. First, a good coach;
and certainly we have had that, during
the last four years. To-day we have
I the best coach on the coast. Second,
| a good trainer. We have the best, in
t lie United States. Third, men: and
wo do not have to fear on that score.
Lastly, spirit. It is against over con
! ndence that our greatest fight must
j be made. But if every fellow will try
;for the team or support the team, we
| will win again."
"Dad" Moulton, who was the final
j speaker, said in part:
"It's up to every man to come out
j and try. If a man hasn't the nerve
to try here, he will never make good
anywhere. It. does not matter if you
do not know the game. The coach
; is there to Jeach it to you. Training
oommenres when your uniform goes
on, and training is a religion with us.
The only way is to beat California
once more. It is too bad, but we have
j to do it."
I Following the rally, the Rugby can
i didates handed in their names to

Coach Presley. Of the 192 men to
sign up, 85 are eligible for the Fresh
man fifteen. In 1907, 100 joined the
squad, and of these about 75 were
first-year students, while in 1908 the
total of 145 was divided almost evenly
between old men and Freshmen.
Manager Burbank yesterday com
pleted the details of an important
change in the Rugby schedule. Ow
ing to a financial disagreement be

October 215, the Castaways coming
