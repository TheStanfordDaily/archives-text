# SOPHOMORES WIN RUSH
## FRESHMEN MAKE GAME FIGHTS IN ROPE-TYING CONTESTS. Despite Disparity of Numbers, 1912 Vanquished Opponents After Forty-five Minute Battle. 
### 
After the most desperately fought
rope-tying contest yet seen tit Stan
ford, the men of 1912 this afternoon
vanquished their enemies of 1913 by
an extremely narrow margin. Just
forty-six minutes after Referee Pres
ley's gun announced the commence
ment of the struggle the last battling
Freshman was dragged into the al
ready well-filled morgue. The un
usual length of the fight was in no
measure due to any sluggishness 011
the part of the Sophomores, for they
had far greater odds to contend
against than any of their predecessors,
the Freshmen outnumbering them by
over twenty men. 211 second-year
representatives took the field at the
beginning of the rush, while the of
ficials counted but 189 Sophomores.
Both classes made free use of paint to
distinguish their members. The
Freshmen used the additional precau
tion of yellow belts and arm-bands.
Injuries forced only two men to
retire before the conclusion of the
contest. J. F. Partridge, '12, incurred
a painful wrench to his ankle, and
E. L. Peck, '13, was stunned while
at the bottom of a human heap.
