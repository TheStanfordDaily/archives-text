In the past it has been a jealously
guarded custom that all University
buildings, and especially the Quad
rangle are exempt from disfiguration
by any form of posters and announce
ments. Recent instances would in
dicate that this tradition has either
been forgotten or is being willfully
violated. We prefer to place the
blame for placing posters on the
Quadrangle and the adjacent buildings
to ignorance rather than viciousness.
Some years ago a Junior class
awakened a storm of student protest
by pasting Plug-Ugly posters on the
Quadrangle and the wall facing the
Engineering buildings. Within the
last few days several instances of
such misdirected enthusiasm have
been noticeable. A poster advertis
ing one of the university publications
was prominently placed on the en
gineering wall. This was a small of
fense and easily overlooked. But this
morning witnessed not only the wall
but the Quadrangle as well, again dis
figured by a number of the posters
published by the Sophomores. The
littering of sidewalks and porches may
be endured as a characteristic Sopho
moric prank or excused on the ground
that such places furnish the only
available means of securing sufficient
publicity for these expressions of
second year authority, but there can
be no excuse for using the Quadrangle
as a public bill board.
The tradition which makes this spot
exempt from all such uses should be
rigidly observed, and the class of 1912
should refrain from again violating
that Stanford custom which holds the
Quadrangle as a place apart, sur
rounding it with an atmosphere ap
proaching that of an object held
sacred.
