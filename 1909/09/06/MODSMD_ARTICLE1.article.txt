# RUGBY SEASON BEGINS
## LARGE SQUAD ENDURES HARD PRACTICE SATURDAY. Mitchell, Crawford and Holman Assist Presley in Drilling the Two Hundred Candidates. 
### 
For one hour and forty-five minutes
almost two hundred Rugby aspirants
took part in the lirst football practice
of the present season on Stanford
Field last Saturday afternoon. Under
the direction of Coach Presley and his
assistants the men were drilled in
merely the rudimentary points of the
game. For the more convenient hand
ling of so large a number, the squad
was split into four divisions, each of
which was, for the most part, coached
separately. Presley took charge of the
Freshman forwards; Crawford super
vised the work of the more experi
enced men, and Holman directed the
backs of the three upperclasses, while
the 1913 backs were left in the care
of Captain Mitchell.
The customary setting-up exercises
began the practice, and will continue
during the early days of the season.
The forwards were then instructed in
forming the scrum, heeling out, drib
bling and picking up the ball, while
passing, kicking and catching were
taught the backs. Following this a
fifteen composed entirely of veteran
players showed the more inexperi
enced candidates something of the
line-out and the kick-off. A spirited
run around the field concluded a fast,
though long afternoon's work.
For the next few days the work of
the squad will be very similar to that
of Saturday, the coaches working on
the rudimentary tactics only. The
first line-ups will probably occur dur
ing the latter half of t"tie present week.
Practice each day will commence at
4:45.
