# Two Students Suspended for Semester.
## 
### 
At the last meeting of the Com
mittee on Student Affairs, two stu
dents were suspended from the Uni
versity for the period of one semester.
This action was taken after the Com
mit tee was convinced that, these stu
dents had given and received aid in
an examination. The offence was
committed in the course of a final
examination given last semester. Reg
istration was refused during the coin
ing four months.
