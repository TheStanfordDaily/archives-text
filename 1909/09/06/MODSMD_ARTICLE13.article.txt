The meeting of the Senior class to
day furnished an instance of what has
become a noticeable tendency in
nearly all class affairs. The great
majority of the class either fail hi
attend meetings or, if present, ex
hibit no active interest in the pro
ceedings. Such an apathy toward
matters which are of concern to the
class as a body does not evidence the
proper sort of class spirit. Since the
day that the present Senior class en
rolled as Freshmen there has been a
keen loyalty shown in all branches
of class activity, and it would be a
poor reflection on the present mem
bership if this interest is allowed to
decline.
One means by which interest may
be shown is attendance at meetings
and an expression of opinion on mat
ters which come up for discussion.
The members of the Senior Circus
Committee to-day asked the class for
a decision as to the advisability of
having a circus in case Stanford Field
could not be secured, but so slight
an interest was taken in the matter
that the motion carried was far from
a decisive expression of class opinion.
Consequently the committee is unable
to accurately judge what is really
desired and is compelled to work
blindly, uncertain whether or not the
Seniors really wish them to continue
plans in any event. An infusion of
class spirit into meetings would be
a very desirable change.
