entering class were in attendance and
the service as a whole was in the
nature of a welcome to them. Besides
the regular sermon delivered by
Chaplain D. Charles Gardner, short
addresses were given by President
David Starr Jordan and Student Ad

were well worth hearing and were
greatly enjoyed and appreciated by
the large congregation present. Good
music was furnished by the newly or
ganized choir.
Dr. Jordan gave the first address
in which he spoke especially of the
value of a University education and
of spending four years in such an in
stitution as Stanford University. He
said in part, "The four years ahead
of you are the most important of your
lives, for it is now that you learn
what to do and how to do it. More
over you get headed in a definite di
rection. A man is just the same after
he graduates as when he' graduates,
and if good tendencies have the upper
hand during his University career they
will dominate his after-life."
Student Advisor Roth next followed
with a few well-chosen remarks of
especial value to the entering stu

livered an especially able sermon in
which he spoke of education as being
valued primarily as a developer of

services in the University Chapel. He
paid loving tribute to the late Mrs.
Ij. H. Langtree, matron of Roble Hall,
and asked the congregation to join
him in tho near future in holding
