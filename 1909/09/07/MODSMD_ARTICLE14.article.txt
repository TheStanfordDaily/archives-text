The exercises to-morrow mark the
formal opening of the Medical depart
ment at Stanford and thus commemo
rate an event of no small import in
the history of the growth of the Uni
versity. The acquisition of Cooper
Medical College and the institution of
a course for advanced work in medi
cine has been expansion and progress
which makes this institution a Uni
versity in its highest sense.
The Committee on Public Exercises
has suspended University work for
two periods to-morrow in order that
all may have an opportunity of at
tending the exercises which will for
mally announce the inauguration of
the new department. Every member
of the Student Body should evince bis
appreciation of the opportunity and
his interest in an occasion which
means much to the future of Stanford
by attendance in Assembly Hall dur
ing the program. The speakers are
men of national repute in their pro
fession, whom none should lose this
opportunity to hear.
