The resolution passed by the Ex
ecutive Committee lust year retain
ing boating as an intercollegiate sport,
but limiting the expenditure for this
branch of athletics to $1,000, in reality
left the final decision of the whole
matter to the present committee. At
present the question of the retention
of boating as an intercollegiate sport
is under consideration by the Execu
tive Committee and there should be a
free expression of undergraduate
opinion on the subject in order that
the decision reached may be to the
best interests of the Student Bod v.
There is no possible advantage to be
gained from postponing the decision
by compromise measures which only
delay the ultimate settlement of the
of the problem. Rowing should either
be placed on a regular intercollegiate
basis and every effort made to keep it
up to the standard of other branches
or it should no longer be retained as
one of the intercollegiate sports. A
speedy decision is desirable in either
case. If the sport be retained, the men
should do fall training, while the ab
sence of this training in the event the
decision is to discontinue rowing, will
enable the crew men to join the foot
ball squad with no handicap. Noth
ing but an absolute decision should be
tolerated.
From the standpoint of the Student
Body, there are several important
points which merit consideration. One
of ihese is that of finances. Owing to
the peculiar situation and lack of
proper accommodations it is impossi
ble to make boating a paying sport.
In spite of all efforts at economy
during the past three years the Stu
dent Body has been steadily going
in debt. The present year has opened
with unpaid bills amounting to nearly
$3,000 and less than $100 in the treas
ury. This, too, with the prospect of
a $r>,()00 decline in receipts over those
of last year, owing to the fact that
both intercollegiate contests will be

held on the Stanford campus, while
rainy weather would still further
diminish the receipts by several thou
sand dollars.
Under such conditions it seems im
practicable to spend $3,000 or more
on a sport which is of necessity arti
ficial, owing to the lack of facilities
consequently employing only a lim
ited number of men, and which is from
the very force of circumstances un
able to assist in its own financial sup
port. Nor is the expedient of set
ting the $1,000 limit any better finan
ceering, as it means the rapid de
terioration of equipment and ultimate
total loss with the expenditure of a
large lump sum for replacement.
The lack of adequate or even suit
able facilities for crew-training or the
intercollegiate regatta should also re
ceive attention. When the men are
required to go to Redwood City the
sport requires more time than can be
given without neglect of other work
while the present equipment of shells
and apparatus will accommodate only
a small squad if sufficient work is
to be done. When, after months of
unceasing training and the expendi
ture of a large sum of money to ad
vance the sport, the day of the race
finally arrives, there is no location
suitable for holding an intercollegiate
regatta with any certainty of favor
able weather conditions or adequate
accommodations for spectators. From
past experience the event is in the
majority of cases a fiasco, furnishing
none of the pleasures of a real con
test to the spectators and awakening
no great interest among the mem
bers of the Student Body.
The fact that the sport has resulted
in physical injury to several of the
participants is in no wise negligible.
Authorities conflict as to the prob
able resulting harm from rowing, but
there are abundant authentic static
tics to uphold any claim that the sport
is often injurious. It is certain that
at least two of last year's crew suf
fered severe physical injury as a di
rect. result of participation in the
sport. And according to the profes
sional opinion of Dr. Wilbur, who bad
ample opportunity for observation,
more injurious effects result from the
arduous conditions of training which
our facilities necessitate, than any
possible benefit can equalize.
While the men in rowing have
shown a loyalty which merits all pos
sible support, the interests of these
men should not be supported if in
opposition to the welfare of the Stu
dent Body as a whole. With the
ample equipment for large numbers
in the other branches of sport, every
man on the crew squad would have
an opportunity to make good in an
other line if this sport, be discon
tinued.
Giving all possible weight to the
merits of rowing as a sport and to
the desire to reward the men who
have so loyally supported ii in the !
past, it does not appear practicable to
continue it as an intercollegiate sport j
when consideration is given to the
liability of injury to participants, the
failure of the sport to awaken a wide i
interest in either Student Body or
public, the lack of adequate facilities
for training or contests and the ab
solute necessity for retrenchment in
expenditures under the existing con
ditions of Student Body finances.

on a sport which is of necessity arti
ficial, owing to the lack of facilities
consequently employing only a lim
ited number of men, and which is from
the very force of circumstances un
able to assist in its own financial sup
port. Nor is the expedient of set
ting the $1,000 limit any better finan
ceering, as it means the rapid de
terioration of equipment and ultimate
total loss with the expenditure of a
large lump sum for replacement.
The lack of adequate or even suit
able facilities for crew-training or the
intercollegiate regatta should also re
ceive attention. When the men are
required to go to Redwood City the
sport requires more time than can be
given without neglect of other work
while the present equipment of shells
and apparatus will accommodate only
a small squad if sufficient work is
to be done. When, after months of
unceasing training and the expendi
ture of a large sum of money to ad
vance the sport, the day of the race
finally arrives, there is no location
suitable for holding an intercollegiate
regatta with any certainty of favor
able weather conditions or adequate
accommodations for spectators. From
past experience the event is in the
majority of cases a fiasco, furnishing
none of the pleasures of a real con
test to the spectators and awakening
no great interest among the mem
bers of the Student Body.
The fact that the sport has resulted
in physical injury to several of the
participants is in no wise negligible.
Authorities conflict as to the prob
able resulting harm from rowing, but
there are abundant authentic static
tics to uphold any claim that the sport
is often injurious. It is certain that
at least two of last year's crew suf
fered severe physical injury as a di
rect. result of participation in the
sport. And according to the profes
sional opinion of Dr. Wilbur, who bad
ample opportunity for observation,
more injurious effects result from the
arduous conditions of training which
our facilities necessitate, than any
possible benefit can equalize.
While the men in rowing have
shown a loyalty which merits all pos
sible support, the interests of these
men should not be supported if in
opposition to the welfare of the Stu
dent Body as a whole. With the
ample equipment for large numbers
in the other branches of sport, every
man on the crew squad would have
an opportunity to make good in an
other line if this sport, be discon
tinued.
Giving all possible weight to the
merits of rowing as a sport and to
the desire to reward the men who
have so loyally supported ii in the !
past, it does not appear practicable to
continue it as an intercollegiate sport j
when consideration is given to the
liability of injury to participants, the
failure of the sport to awaken a wide i
interest in either Student Body or
public, the lack of adequate facilities
for training or contests and the ab
solute necessity for retrenchment in
expenditures under the existing con
ditions of Student Body finances.
The resolution passed by the Ex
ecutive Committee lust year retain
ing boating as an intercollegiate sport,
but limiting the expenditure for this
branch of athletics to $1,000, in reality
left the final decision of the whole
matter to the present committee. At
present the question of the retention
of boating as an intercollegiate sport
is under consideration by the Execu
tive Committee and there should be a
free expression of undergraduate
opinion on the subject in order that
the decision reached may be to the
best interests of the Student Bod v.
There is no possible advantage to be
gained from postponing the decision
by compromise measures which only
delay the ultimate settlement of the
of the problem. Rowing should either
be placed on a regular intercollegiate
basis and every effort made to keep it
up to the standard of other branches
or it should no longer be retained as
one of the intercollegiate sports. A
speedy decision is desirable in either
case. If the sport be retained, the men
should do fall training, while the ab
sence of this training in the event the
decision is to discontinue rowing, will
enable the crew men to join the foot
ball squad with no handicap. Noth
ing but an absolute decision should be
tolerated.
From the standpoint of the Student
Body, there are several important
points which merit consideration. One
of ihese is that of finances. Owing to
the peculiar situation and lack of
proper accommodations it is impossi
ble to make boating a paying sport.
In spite of all efforts at economy
during the past three years the Stu
dent Body has been steadily going
in debt. The present year has opened
with unpaid bills amounting to nearly
$3,000 and less than $100 in the treas
ury. This, too, with the prospect of
a $r>,()00 decline in receipts over those
of last year, owing to the fact that
both intercollegiate contests will be

held on the Stanford campus, while
rainy weather would still further
diminish the receipts by several thou
sand dollars.
