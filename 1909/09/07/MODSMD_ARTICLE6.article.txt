# CHANGE MANAGEMENT
## GUILD BOARD BENTS HOSPITAL TO PENINSULA ASSOCIATION. Student Patients to Be Received on Same Plan as Formerly.â€”To Build Contagious Ward. 
### 
A change will be made this year
in the management of the Guild Hos
pital in Palo Alto. At a meeting ot'
the Guild Board held last evening it
was decided to ratify an agreement
between the summer committee of that
board and the authorities of the new
Peninsula Hospital, whereby the latter
will take charge of the Palo Alto
institution for the present semester,
or until the completion of the new
building.
Under the new management stu
dent patients will be taken by the
Peninsula Hospital for a fee of $2.50
per day per patient, the student to
pay $1.00 and the guild to pay the
remainding $1.50. In this way the
same fee will be charged to the stu
dent as under the previous manage
ment. The agreement is to last until
the end of the semester when a joint
meeting of the two boards will be
held and satisfactory arrangements
decided upon as to the disposition of
any profits and the making tip of any
deficit that may be caused by the
above agreement.
Owing to the fact that, no contag
ious cases will be admitted at the
Palo Alto Hospital, the Guild is now
making an attempt to secure the
permission of the trustees for the es
tablishing of a contagious ward on
the University grounds. However, no
definite decision has as yet been re
ceived.
The other business transacted by
the board was the appointment of Inst.
J. P. Mitchell, of the Chemistry de
partment, to the position left vacant
j by the resignation of Dr. W. F. Snow,
i A report was heard from Dr. Gilbert
j of the business of the summer com
| mittee which showed a gain of $625.
! Hills were ordered paid to the amount
of $226.90.
