# SQUAD GROWS LARGER
## MORE CANDIDATES FOR RUGBY TEAMS APPEAR. Season's First Practice Line-Ups Will Occur on Stanford Field, Wednesday Afternoon. 
### 
Rugby practice continued yesterday
and but lew changes were noticeable in
the routine. After the usual dribbling,
kicking and passing a few minutes'
work by the backs at (he tackling bag
served to enliven the afternoon. Five
new candidates apepared on the field,
three of these being Freshmen. E. T.
Brown, '12, substitute Varsity and
1912 Freshman full, was on the field
to-day for the first time this season.
It is, of course, impossible to form
any adequate judgment of the 1913
squad this early in the year. That
their weight is up to and probably
a little above the average is, how
ever, apparent. As not more than
thirteen of all the Freshmen who
signed up had ever played Rugby
previous to entering the University,
it will be several days before they
know enough of the game to display
any ability which they might have.
Coach Presley is finding great dif
ficulty in handling so large a squad.
Consequently, in order to select the
best first-year men for the game with
Lowell High School next Saturday a
number of practice line-ups will be
necessary between the different fif
teens which compose the Freshman
squad. The first of these will take
place on Stanford Field to-morrow
afternoon.
