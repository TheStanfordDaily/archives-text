# COMMITTEES CHANGED
## DR. JORDAN ALTARS PERSONNEL OF VARIOUS BOARDS. New Names Appear in Different Divisions of Academic Council for This Year. 
### 
Numerous changes have been made
in the composition of the various Ac
ademic and Administrative Committees
for this year. Many of these changes
are due principally to leaves of ab
sence that have, been granted within
the past year and to the number of
professors that have exchanged places
with other professors from different
Universities for the coming year.

chairmanships of all committees will
remain the same as last year, al
though the personnel of the boards
