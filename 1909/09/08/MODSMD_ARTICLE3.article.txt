# MEDICAL SCHOOL FORMALLY INAUGURATED THIS MORNING
## Famed Scientists Deliver Addresses at Opening of Stanford's Latest Division of Instruction. 
### 
The Assembly Hall was filled this
morning with those who came to wit
ness the inauguration of the Medical
School as a part of the University,
and the acquisition of Cooper Medical
College as the property of Stanford.
The principal address was made by
Dr. H. A. Christian, Dean of the Har
vard Medical College, while Dr. H.
Gibbons, Jr., who at present is the
Dean of the Cooper Medical College,
spoke in behalf of that institution.
Dr. Jordan introduced the speakers
of the occasion with a few well-timed
remarks touching the field of science
in general. He spoke of the recent
and exceptionally rapid growth of the
knowledge of medicine and of the
comparatively late realization of that
profession's relation to the various
sciences that are so closely connected
with work in that study.
As the next speaker, Dr. Gibbons,
gave a very full and lucid outline of
the growth of medicine in the state
of California, laying special stress
upon the rise of Cooper Medical Col
lege in its close relation to this pro
fession as practised in California. The
present dean then traced the suc
cession of trials and various strokes
of good fortune that intermittently
affected that institution, with the
gradual growth of the curriculum and
enrollment to its present standing and
efficiency.
Dr. Christian, who was introduced
by Dr. Jordan as a "young man whose
achievements signify that his work
belongs to this age," next addressed
the assemblage. He prefaced his re
marks by lamenting the fact that there
are very few medical schools through
out the land at the present time, al
though he appreciated the powerful
influence that they have exerted upon
the medical education of the students
that are enrolled, and also the power
ful factor that they have been in the
changing of the medical instruction
to keep pace with the recent wonder

ful developments that have occurred
in medical science.
"I would have you consider medi
cine broadly as one of the biological
sciences to be entered into after a
collegiate training with some knowl
edge of others of the groups of scien
tific studies, more especially of chem
istry, physics and zoology," com
mented Dr. Christian in the course of
his speech. "Probably in no other
calling is there such an intermingling
of work for wage and work that brings
its blessing to others, and in this lies
the peculiar charm of the practice of
medicine. Many are the opportuni
ties for doing good to his fellow men,
nobly does he respond to these calls.
"Graduates of the various medical
schools go into different lines of work
when they take up their life in the
character of specialists, consulting
physicians, general practisioners and
teachers of medicine. Apropos to this
topic the speaker remarked:
"During the past five years much
progress has been made in elevating
the standard of medical education by
Increasing the entrance requirements
to our medical schools. Assuming
that a college A.B. or B.S. course is
an ideal preparation for medicine, it
has already been adopted in several
medical schools, making the period
between entrance to college and the
commencement of medicine a period
of from 8 to 10 years. At present,
after such a preparation, most men
begin medical practice too late in life.
To start them earlier in life can be
done best, I believe, by, in some way,
lowering the age entrance to college
—perhaps by changing instruction in
the preparatory schools."
The celebrated scholar discussed
at length the clinical departments of
the various colleges and advised
strongly the installation of depart
ments of this nature without stinting
the expenditure of moneys that may
be at hand.

The Assembly Hall was filled this
morning with those who came to wit
ness the inauguration of the Medical
School as a part of the University,
and the acquisition of Cooper Medical
College as the property of Stanford.
The principal address was made by
Dr. H. A. Christian, Dean of the Har
vard Medical College, while Dr. H.
Gibbons, Jr., who at present is the
Dean of the Cooper Medical College,
spoke in behalf of that institution.
Dr. Jordan introduced the speakers
of the occasion with a few well-timed
remarks touching the field of science
in general. He spoke of the recent
and exceptionally rapid growth of the
knowledge of medicine and of the
comparatively late realization of that
profession's relation to the various
sciences that are so closely connected
with work in that study.
As the next speaker, Dr. Gibbons,
gave a very full and lucid outline of
the growth of medicine in the state
of California, laying special stress
upon the rise of Cooper Medical Col
lege in its close relation to this pro
fession as practised in California. The
present dean then traced the suc
cession of trials and various strokes
of good fortune that intermittently
affected that institution, with the
gradual growth of the curriculum and
enrollment to its present standing and
efficiency.
Dr. Christian, who was introduced
by Dr. Jordan as a "young man whose
achievements signify that his work
belongs to this age," next addressed
the assemblage. He prefaced his re
marks by lamenting the fact that there
are very few medical schools through
out the land at the present time, al
though he appreciated the powerful
influence that they have exerted upon
the medical education of the students
that are enrolled, and also the power
ful factor that they have been in the
changing of the medical instruction
to keep pace with the recent wonder

ful developments that have occurred
in medical science.
"I would have you consider medi
cine broadly as one of the biological
sciences to be entered into after a
collegiate training with some knowl
edge of others of the groups of scien
tific studies, more especially of chem
istry, physics and zoology," com
mented Dr. Christian in the course of
his speech. "Probably in no other
calling is there such an intermingling
of work for wage and work that brings
its blessing to others, and in this lies
the peculiar charm of the practice of
medicine. Many are the opportuni
ties for doing good to his fellow men,
nobly does he respond to these calls.
"Graduates of the various medical
schools go into different lines of work
when they take up their life in the
character of specialists, consulting
physicians, general practisioners and
teachers of medicine. Apropos to this
topic the speaker remarked:
"During the past five years much
progress has been made in elevating
the standard of medical education by
Increasing the entrance requirements
to our medical schools. Assuming
that a college A.B. or B.S. course is
an ideal preparation for medicine, it
has already been adopted in several
medical schools, making the period
between entrance to college and the
commencement of medicine a period
of from 8 to 10 years. At present,
after such a preparation, most men
begin medical practice too late in life.
To start them earlier in life can be
done best, I believe, by, in some way,
lowering the age entrance to college
—perhaps by changing instruction in
the preparatory schools."
The celebrated scholar discussed
at length the clinical departments of
the various colleges and advised
strongly the installation of depart
ments of this nature without stinting
the expenditure of moneys that may
be at hand.
