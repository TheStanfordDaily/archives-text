# ADVISE FRESHMAN ENGINEERS.
## Professor Hoskins Tells First-Year Men of New Rulings in Mathematics Course. 
### 
Freshmen taking Course 1 in Ap
plied Mathematics were given a short
talk yesterday morning at 8 o'clock by
Professor L. M. Hoskins, head of the
department. The meeting was called
primarily for the purpose of giving
advice to the first-year men, based
on the precedents of former years.
Among other things discussed, Profes
sor Hoskins advised the men to limit

(heir hours to 15, and to do their best
work at all times. A preliminary ex
amination in the course will be given
after three weeks and is designed to
remove all men from tlie course who
can not do the work. Any student
receiving a condition at the Christmas
examinations will be compelled to re
peat. the course, unless the condition
is removed by the beginning of the
next semester. A condition incurred
in May will occasion work in summer 1
school as a make-up.
