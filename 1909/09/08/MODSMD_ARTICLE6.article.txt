# FIRST GAME SATURDAY
## PICKED TEAMS WILL PLAY BEFORE 1913 CONTEST. Seniors to Meet Juniors Next Week in First Game of Interclass Rugby Series. 
### 
Three games for a single admission
will fall to the lot of those who are
in attendance at Stanford Field next
Saturday afternoon. Besides the first
Freshman contest between the 1913
team and Lowell High School, four
fifteens composed of men from the
three upperclasses will take part in
two preliminary games. Lowell
should give the first-year players a
close light, and although it is probable
that a large number of Freshman sub
stitutes will be used during the prog
ress of the game, the afternoon's work
should give some idea of the strength
of 1913 in Rugby.
The annual interclass football series
will begin next week and will be con
cluded as soon as it. is possible to do
so. The exact date of the first game
has not as yet been definitely deter
mined. It is probable, however, that
two of the three contests will be
played during the week of September
13, leaving the final struggle to be
decided on the Monday or Tuesday
following. As in former years the first
contest of the series will be between
the Seniors and Juniors, the second
between the Sophomores and Fresh
men.
Practice yesterday varied little from
that of the first two afternoons. The
first line-up occurred to-day, and
hence forward short scrummages will
be indulged in as often as practicable.
