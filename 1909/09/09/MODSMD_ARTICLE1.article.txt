# SCRUMMAGES STARTED
## FIRST RUGBY LINE-UPS BEGIN IN GAMES WEDNESDAY. Seniors Defeat Juniors, 8 to 0, and Freshmen Do Good Work Against Sophomores. 
### 
The three one-half games played
on Stanford Field yesterday afternoon
resulted in the Seniors defeating the
Juniors, the first Freshman team best
ing the Sophomores, and the second
Freshmen tying the third 1913 fifteen.
The fastest contest was between 1910
and 1911. Passing rushes were re
sponsible for both the tries scored,
Cook going over the line for the first
tally, Mitchell doing the same soon
after. Crawford kicked one goal, the
final score standing 8 to 0.
The Freshman squad was arbitrarily
divided into three teams, that desig
nated as the first fifteen springing the
surprise of the day by winning from
the Sophomores 6 to 0. The two tries
were made in quick succession by
backfield rushes just before the close
of the game.
With only three days of practice,
the 1913 men, of necessity, knew but
little Rugby. Their plucky work
alone brought them victory.
After an uninteresting contest the
second and third fifteens battled to a
0 to 0 tie.
Beginning this afternoon all can
didates who have in previous years
played on the Varsity against Cali
fornia were placed on the rubbing
list, additions to which will be made
from time to time.
