After a transcontinental leap, "Go
ing Some," the farcial comedy or wit,
'rah 'rah and lariats by Rex Beach
and Paul Armstrong which has just
rounded out an eight months' run
at the Belasco Theatre, New York,
will be presented by Messrs. Shubert
at the Valencia Theatre, opening next
Sunday night, September 12, and con
tinuing for two weeks. "Going Some."
is described as "being the chronicle
of a certain lot of college men and
girls with a tragic strain of phono
graph and cowboys." All of its scenes
are laid in New Mexico at the Flying
Heart Ranch. The boys of that ranch
have a fe>ul with the boys of the
Centipede Ranch over a foot race won
the year before by the latter, when the
prize was a phonograph—the only one
for miles around. The story briefly is:
.7. Wallingford Speed, the hero, ar
rives with his trainer. To make a
hit, Speed declares that he is old Ely's
champion runner. When the cowboys
hear what Speed has said, they feel
that they will win back their phono
graph, not knowing of course that
Speed is a four-flusher. The role of
Speed will be played by James Spotts
wood, a graduate of Georgetown Uni
versity, of Washington. D. C.. Spotts
wood was a member of the relay team
with Arthur Duffy, who established
the 100 yard championship record.
For the part of the trainer, Eugene
O'Rourke, former manager of .T. L.
Sullivan has obtained. For once a
native son of the Golden West will be
a villian, for the bold, bad man of
"Going Some." "Berkeley Fresno,"
sometimes called the "Fresno Night
ingale," is the tenor of the Stanford
Glee Club, and he does his villiany in
whole-hearted manner. Frank Van
derlee, the original silent Murphy of
the College Widow, impersonates this
role. There are 25 actual characters,
and the piece comes direct from the
Belasco Theatre, where it has been
the biggest hit in anything like recent
memory in New York. —Advt.
