# PLAN NOTABLE COMEDY
## "TWELFTH NIGHT" WILL BE BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE. Many Rehearsals Insure Finished Production.-New Costumes and Scenery Secured. 
### 
Elaborate plans are being made by
the committee in charge of the Eng
lish Club's production of "Twelfth
Night" to make the performance of
that comedy the most notable in the
history of Stanford dramatics. Sat
urday, September 25, is the date which
has been determined upon, and as
the rehearsals already have a touch
of finish and smoothness, the two
weeks intervening before the produc
tion insure a well-acted and enjoy
able entertainment. Even now the
cast gives a pleasing rendition of the
play as a whole, and, accordingly, the
remaining rehearsals will be largely
devoted to the insertion of many clever
bits of stage "business," for which
F. L. Mathieu, the coach, is so justly
famous.
Never in the Assembly Hall has a
play been costumed as luxuriously and
tastefully as will "Twelfth Night."
For the majority of the leading char
acters entirely new costumes have
been provided by a leading San Fran
cisco firm. These will arrive on the
Campus early in the week, when
a series of pictures will be taken of
the various scenes of the comedy.
Four complete sets of scenery have
been ordered and are at present being
painted.
As the University orchestra has not
yet been organized this semester, a
professional orchestra will be heard
before the rise of the curtain and be
tween the acts, while the music in
cidental to the play will be rendered
behind the scenes by well-known col
lege musicians.
