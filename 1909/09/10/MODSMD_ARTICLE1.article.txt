contests between four fifteens selected

classes. The first of these games will
commence promptly at 2:15, the sec
ond following immediately in order

Lowell shortly after 3:30. One ad
mission will include all three contests.

tice will stand them in good stead as
against the six days' work of the Stan
ford men.
