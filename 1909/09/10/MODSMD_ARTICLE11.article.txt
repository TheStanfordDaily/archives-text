The following communication deal
ins with ihe rowing question has been
received by The Daily Palo Alto, and
is printed as submitted:
in considering questions of impor
tance to a community or an institu
tion it is always well to get other
views besides the impartial one be
fore judgment is passed. Much has
been said concerning the merits and
demerits of rowing. Many rumors
have been accepted as facts by a large
number who are not in a position to
judge for themselves. In the East,
where boating has such a firm stand
ing. it is*a regular reoccurrance with
the training season that some one
must get hysterical over the deadly
effects of rowing. Or if a man dies
before he lias completed the allotted
span and at one time in his life pulled
a sweep, it is a signal for a preach
ment against the injurious effects of
hard training. Nevertheless rowing
still seems to hold its place and prom
inence in the sporting world. After
four years' trial the accidental sick
ness of two men was a signal for a
burst of hysteria to sweep over Stan
ford.
In place of assertions the following
facts are not out of place. Dr. Mor
gan, of Oxford, published full, au
thentic statistics as to the effects of
rowing upon several generations of
Oxford oarsmen. His investigations
covered the period from 1529 to 1872,
and during those forty-three years
only five per cent suffered an ill
effect. In America, Dr. Darling made
a similar investigation covering Har
vard crews from IS9O to 1900. He
reported that "No ill effects, which
i could be reasonably attributed to
I t raining were discovered in nine
| months after stopping it." This mat
ter should be received from the proper
perspective. It seems probable that
the censor of college athletics, Dr.
Wilbur, intends to demand a certifi
cate of immortality from every man
that enters the Varsity crew.
As to the financial end of the ques
tion, there is no institution in the
country where rowing pays for it
self, even with the best accommo
dations, nor can there be little or any
return expected at Stanford. For two
years Stanford boating was supported
