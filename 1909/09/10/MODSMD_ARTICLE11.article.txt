The following communication deal
ins with ihe rowing question has been
received by The Daily Palo Alto, and
is printed as submitted:
in considering questions of impor
tance to a community or an institu
tion it is always well to get other
views besides the impartial one be
fore judgment is passed. Much has
been said concerning the merits and
demerits of rowing. Many rumors
have been accepted as facts by a large
number who are not in a position to
judge for themselves. In the East,
where boating has such a firm stand
ing. it is*a regular reoccurrance with
the training season that some one
must get hysterical over the deadly
effects of rowing. Or if a man dies
before he lias completed the allotted
span and at one time in his life pulled
a sweep, it is a signal for a preach
ment against the injurious effects of
hard training. Nevertheless rowing
still seems to hold its place and prom
inence in the sporting world. After
four years' trial the accidental sick
ness of two men was a signal for a
burst of hysteria to sweep over Stan
ford.
In place of assertions the following
facts are not out of place. Dr. Mor
gan, of Oxford, published full, au
thentic statistics as to the effects of
rowing upon several generations of
Oxford oarsmen. His investigations
covered the period from 1529 to 1872,
and during those forty-three years
only five per cent suffered an ill
effect. In America, Dr. Darling made
a similar investigation covering Har
vard crews from IS9O to 1900. He
reported that "No ill effects, which
i could be reasonably attributed to
I t raining were discovered in nine
| months after stopping it." This mat
ter should be received from the proper
perspective. It seems probable that
the censor of college athletics, Dr.
Wilbur, intends to demand a certifi
cate of immortality from every man
that enters the Varsity crew.
As to the financial end of the ques
tion, there is no institution in the
country where rowing pays for it
self, even with the best accommo
dations, nor can there be little or any
return expected at Stanford. For two
years Stanford boating was supported
by the enthusiasm of the men who
were interested in it. To men of such
spirit,—and they are still in college,—
$1,000 will be a fortune. As to re
placing equipment, there will be little
or no need of replacement for three
years. The equipment at the lake
boat-house with slight repairs for
wear and tear will last two years
more. The life of a shell is four years
at the least. The old shell will last
two more seasons and the new one
is good for four. Even should the
situation demand another shell next
season surely the student body will be
willing to come through with $500 out
of the $5,000 which the eidtor admits
will he the probable receipts over this
year's income.
Another consideration is that Mr,
Charles Lathrop spent something over
$4,000 to put the lake in shape for
training crews with the object of put
ting boating on a firm basis at Stan
lord. He has since evinced his sup
port by putting up a large silver
trophy, nor has his generosity ended
with this. The present equipment will
accommodate seventy men but compe
tition will necessarily eliminate a
great many. According to Pat O'Day,
former coach of Wisconsin, the Oak
land estuary is as fine a course as
there is in the country. As to making
a fiasco of the regatta, the weather is
in the hands of the Creator and con
sequently can not be relied upon with
any degree of certainty. Rut this
should not be lamented as the same
thing occurs in the East, and they have
not used it as an agrument. to dis
continue boating. California does not
intend to cut out this branch of sport
as evinced by her men turning out for
fall training.
In the East, colleges sent crews to
the Poughkeepsie regatta year after
year with no better results than sec
ond or third place. This, however,
does not seem to dampen their ardor.
Is Stanford to show less spirit es
pecially when her oarsmen have ac
complished such brilliant achieve
ments under circumstances not to be
compared with those enjoyed by her
rivals.
The Portola Festival Committee has
offered a large silver trophy and
medals to the winning crew or a four
oared race between Stanford and Cal
ifornia. The $1,000 limit will not only
allow of turning out a four this fall,
but two eight-oared crews next spring.
The prospects for a successful sea
son in boating are the brightest in
the history of Stanford acquatics. The
veterans of last, year's crews, with
one or two exceptions, have signified
their intention of rowing even if they
have to pay their own expenses. Sure
ly the Stanford student body will not
allow such spirit to go unaided. If
Stanford oarsmen practically unaided
can turn out a winning crew as they
did in '07. certainly with $1,000, two
boat-houses, three shells and two
work-out boats they ought to make a
showing that will make every Stan
ford man and woman feel proud of
the crew.
