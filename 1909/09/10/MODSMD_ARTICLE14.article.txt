To-morrow the Freshman Rugby
squad will play the first regularly
scheduled match of the season, when
the 1912 team lines up against the
fifteen from Lowell High School. The
men who play on the Freshman team,
as well as all the other members of
the entering class, will form their lirst
ideas of Stanford athletic spirit by the
amount of enthusiasm shown by the
bleachers in support of the team.
This first impression should be a wor
thy one. Every member of the Stu
dent Body should be on the bleachers
to support the Freshmen in their lirst
contest and demonstrate the sp'rit
which is to be typical of the entire
season.
