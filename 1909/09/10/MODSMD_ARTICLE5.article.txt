# Freshman Society to Be Organized.
## 
### 
Next Monday at 7:30 o'clock in room
22S the Freshman Debating Society
will be organized by the committee
that was appointed for that purpose
by the members of the Intel-society
Debating League at the last meeting
of that organization. This first year
society will afford to the members of
the Freshman class the opportunity
to select the debators who will event
ually represent the class of 1913 in
the interclass contest, and to become
prepared for that event.
All those members of the Freshman
class who are interested in forensics
are urgently requested by the com
mittee that has the organization of
the society in charge, to attend this
initial meeting on Monday evening that
the organization may be complete and
all first-year men profit by the advice
that individuals of this group of more
experienced debators will give to the
Freshmen.
Further particulars may be obtained
from any member of the committee,
which consists of G. F. Morgan, '10,
J. E. Shelton, '10, and C. C. Shoemaker,
'10.
