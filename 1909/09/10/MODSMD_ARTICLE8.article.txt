# SPEAK TO FRESHMEN
## TWO STRONG ADDRESSES MADE TO INCOMING CLASS. President Jordan and J.E. Shelton, '10, Talk Before First Student Assembly of Year. 
### 
Assembly Hall was the scene of the
first. Assembly of the semester this
morning, when the incoming class of
Freshmen was formally welcomed by
both L>r. Jordan, on behalf of the Uni
versity and by Student Body President
J. E. Shelton, on behalf of the Asso
ciated Students.
Dr. Jordan, who was the first speak
er, prefaced his rem ark es to the first
year men by warning them against
habits and practices that are apt to
be contracted by new students, and
explained the disadvantages of such
customs to themselves and the Uni
versity's stand against them.
In the course of his talk, I)r. Jor
dan remarked: "Education should Rive
each man the secret of power, which
is mainly made up of intelligence, a
willingness to work, the knowledge of
cooperation and a good moral charac
ter. The majority of these men who
have graduated from Stanford, those
who comprise that body of men called
the alumni, have attained the posses
sion of this secret power, and through
out the entire world we find them evin
cing this attribute.
"The standard of the Stanford grad
uate is very high throughout the coun
try, and in almost every instance we
discover them as the men of the com
munity who amount to something."
Dr. Jordan proceeded to show how
graduates of Stanford were assuming
positions in the land that represented
the best in every line of work that
graduates go into.
In commenting upon the education
afforded the student by his associa
tions in the Student Body, Dr. Jordan
stated that the Stanford Student Body
was probably bound together more
closely than any other organization of
its kind in the world and that the re
sults obtained by being an integral
part of this association was a highly
educative factor. The benefits ob
tained by a closer association with the
various professors was also empha
sized by the President.
Student Body President J. E. Shelton
also addressed the Assembly, intro
ducing the first-year men in a short
summary, to the history of the past
classes and to the benefits that they
have bestowed upon the University and
upon the responsibilities that devolved
upon these classes and the duties that
now fall upon the present generation
to uphold the high standard that the
previous men have established.
"The Freshmen are now supposed to
be an integral part of the Student
Body. If they did not thus become a
part of it the standard ot the Asso
ciated Students would retrograde and
we would not be living up to the re
sponsibilities devolving upon us to
maintain the same high standard that
has been established," said President
Shelton. "The cooperation of every
man is needed to uphold the character
of the Student Body."
