# FRESHMAN TEAM WINS
## DEFEATS LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL SATURDAY 13 to 11. Close Score Largely Due to Use of Many Substitutes.—First Year Backfield Strong. 
### 
The 1913 fifteen began the season in
an encouraging manner, when they
triumphed over the Lowell High
School team on Stanford Field, Satur
day by a score of 13 to 11. The first
half ended with ten points tallied by
the Freshmen and only three marked
up for Lowell. The wholesale changes
made by Coach Presley in the Stan
ford line-up throughout the second
period prohibited any attempt at team
play on the part of the Freshmen and
provided a far closer contest than
would otherwise have been the case.
Only the missing of an easy goal by
Flynn, of Lowell, just before the finish
of the game, prevented a tie score.
For the Freshmen Arrell, Mitchell
and Thoburn were prominent. Time
and again Arrell and Mitchell started
fast passing rushes which were re
sponsible for the first-year team's
largest gains and for two of the three
tries. With further practice and a lit
tle knowledge of the intricacies of
backfield work, the Freshman fives
and three-quarters should be a com
bination of unusual strength. The
scrum on Saturday played a hard,
steady game, following the ball well
and aggressively.
Belcher tallied for the Freshmen
early in the opening half, Mitchell go
ing over for a second try soon after.
Mitchell was sucessful in converting
on each occasion. The half closed
after Teru, for Lowell, in a ruck close
to the line suceeded in diving through
the entire 1913 pack for the high
school's first score. Arrell and Wor
sick were the only members of the or
iginal fifteen who appeared in the line
up during the second half. After Ar
rell, single-handed, had brought the
ball from the 30-yard line almost to in
goal, Chandler secured and scored.
During the remainder of the period
Hall succeeded in tallying twice for
Lowell, Flynn kicking his only goal
in the first instance and missing the
chance for a tie later.
The teams faced each other for the
initial kick-off as follows:
Freshmen — Frank, Stevens, Lull
Duryea, Laird, Merlin, Belcher, for
wards; Bly, wing forward: Cass, half:
Arrell, Mitchell, fives; Kern, center:
