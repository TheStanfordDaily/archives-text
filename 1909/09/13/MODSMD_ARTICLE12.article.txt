At the game on Saturday a fire was
started under the bleachers by a care
lessly dropped match or cigarette.
But for the prompt action of a spec
tator, serious damages might have re
sulted from the conflagration, as the
long dry season has made the bleach
ers easily inflammable.
This calls attention to a danger
against which the precaution should
be twofold. The rubbish and dry
weeds beneath the bleachers are a
constant menace to the structure and
should be removed by those having
charge of the Field before a blaze
similar to that of Saturday results
more seriously. As a further preven
tative, every spectator at the games
should exercise the greatest care lest,
any lighted match or smouldering
cigarette butt be dropped through the
seats where the dry grass beneath
furnishes every opportunity for a
blaze.
The Stanford bleachers have been
erected at so great a cost and are so
important a factor in the athletic life
of the University that it is folly to
risk their destruction when the dan
ger may be averted by a little labor
and precaution.
