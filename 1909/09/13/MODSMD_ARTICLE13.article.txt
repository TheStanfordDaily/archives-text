# Students Seriously Injured by Auto.
## 
### 
M. E. Mitchell, Ml, and J. L. Rey
nolds, '12, both met with painful as
well as serious injuries last Satur
day evening, while returning from
Palo Alto to Encina Hall. Both were
walking upon the automobile speed
way, in front of the new Gymnasium,
when a machine approached them
rapidly, carrying lights that were so
powerful that they were blinded by
the rays. A machine also came up
behind them, but on account of the
bright lights of the automobile com
ing in the opposite direction, the driv
er did not see the pedestrians, nor
did the students seem to lie aware of
the approach of the second machine.
Both were struck by the automobile
traveling in the same direction as
they were. Mitchell suffered injuries
about the head, while Reynolds was
badly lacerated about the face and
suffered from the shock. Both are
now patients at the Guild Hospital
and from the last report of their
condition, it was learned that both are
resting somewhat easier.
