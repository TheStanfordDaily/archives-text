# GIVES ABLE SERMON
## BISHOP FALLOWS SPEAKS. BEFORE LARGE CONGREGATION. Venerable Prelate Deals Strongly with Public Problems sit, Yesterday Morning's Service. 
### 
The largest congregation that has
been in the University Chapel for
over a year greeted the venerable
Bishop Fallows of the Reformed Epis
copal Church at yesterday's service,
and heard him deliver one of the able
sermons for which he is justly noted.
Gifted with a magnetic personality,
an attractive presence, and a pleas
ing and engaging delivery, the Bishop
held the closest attention of his hear
ers throughout his forty-live minute
discourse.
The subject of his sermon was
"Christian Optimism," and in develop
ing it, he spoke of Christianity as
containing all that is good and best
in all religions, of the close relation
ship between science and religion, of
the growing interest in humanitarian
movements, and of the necessity of
college students going into politics.
Speaking of the last phase he said:
"It is the rankest heresy for any min
ister to tell you to keep out of poli
tics."
The Bishop said in part: "The re
sults of science are interpreting the
purposes of deity. We have evidence
of a personal God in the works of
creation. Our conception of God con
tinually grows greater, grander, and
nobler as we study and learn more of
science, history, and literature."
Bishop Fallows closed by speaking
eloquently of the signs of a new re
ligiously optimistic age as evidenced
by the great number of new and vital
humanitarian movements. "God is to
be thanked for giving you the privilege
of living in this new land of limitless
possibilities," concluded the bishop.
