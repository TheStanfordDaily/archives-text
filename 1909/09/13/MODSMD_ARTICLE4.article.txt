Mrs. Abby Snell Burnell will pre

C. A. course at. the regular meeting
to be held in the Chapel next, Tues

speaks in the character of and Im
personating a high-class Hindu woman
"Menarchie."
For some years Mrs. Burnell lived
n Southern India, and has now
adopted a most unique way of pic
turing the life of the women of that
country. Dressed in native costume
and speaking in the first, person she
weaves together in the form of a con
tinuous story such facts and condi
tions as she became familiar with
while in India.
Since Mrs. Burnell began imper
sonating this character she has given
the story of "Menarchie" some thirteen
or fourteen hundred times. Every
woman of the University is urged to
take advantage of this opportunity.
