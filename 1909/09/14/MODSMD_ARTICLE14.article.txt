# Boating Men Start Petition.
## 
### 
Several of (he men who have been
closely connected with boating during
I lie past few years have prepared , a
petition which is now being circulated
among the student body for the pur
pose of showing the Executive Com
mittee just how large a proportion of
the student body favor the continua
tion of rowing as an intercollegiate
sport. The petition has not been in
circulation long enough to allow any
estimate to be made of the just what
proportion of the students will sign
It.
The petition is worded as follows:
"We the undersigned students and
alumni of Stanford University do by
our signatures show our hearty ap
proval of the continuation of rowing
as an intercollegiate sport." One
copy has been sent to San Francisco
for the signatures of the graduates
there who are willinc; to endorse it.
