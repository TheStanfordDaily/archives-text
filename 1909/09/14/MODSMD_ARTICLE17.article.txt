With the opening of each college
year we are annoyed by the recur
rence of a certain type of petty van
dalism which has no place on a uni
versity campus. That is the mutila
tion and theft of posters placed on the
Quad for advertisement or announce
ment purposes.
During the present semester the ad
vertising posters put out by the grad
uate manager and the managers of the
college publications have been tamp
ered with only in a few instances.
But the activity of the poster-gatherer
has become evident in other instances
where his petty thievery is still more
despicable. Last night for the second
time the bulletin board of the Young
Women's Christian Association, situ
ated at the entrance to the Library,
was broken open and the art poster
announcing the meeting of the Asso
ciation stolen. This poster was locked
behind glass doors so that the inci
dent is a case of deliberate theft.
It is to be regretted that if such
actions occur they should be directed
against an organization of the nature
of the Y. W. C. A. which is made the
victim of these thefts merely because
the posters of the Association have
possessed superior artistic merit. If
the person guilty of this or any simi
lar instance of vandalism is detected
he should receive summary action at
the hands of both students and faculty.
