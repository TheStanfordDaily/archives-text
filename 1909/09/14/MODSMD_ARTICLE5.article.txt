# CONFERENCE ELECTION DELAYED
## Lack of List of Eligible Voters Prevents Choosing of Department Delegates. 
### 
As soon as an accurate list of the
names of those in the. student body
who have fifty or more hours to
their credit, can be obtained, an elec
tion of representatives from the va
rious departments to the University
Conference will be held. The dele
gates who were elected last semester
shortly after the ratification of the
organization's constitution, retired
from oflice at the end of the semester,
and so an entirely new set of men will
have to be chosen at the coming elec
tion.
As the constitution of the Univer
sity Conference provides, each depart
ment may elect one representative for
a term of two years, for every forty
members that it has enrolled. These
delegates on coming together elect
their own officers and choose a com
mittee of five, called the Student Ad
visory Committee whose duty it is to
deal with all matters of student disci
pline, acting in such cases on behalf
of the Student Body.
The main reason for which the Uni
versity Conference was organized was
to further the interests of student con
trol at Stanford and to place the duty
of exercising this control in the hands
of the upper classmen.
