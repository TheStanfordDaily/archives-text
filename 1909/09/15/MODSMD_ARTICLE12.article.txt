The efforts of the organist (J. F.
Buehrer to establish an Orchestra an 1
Chorus should receive the support of
the entire University. It is an endea
vor to develop a phase of University
activity which has not received proper
consideration at Stanford. Interest
along all musical lines has been at
best intermittent, while at times the
student organizations have been force<l
to disband through lack of member
ship. But especially has there been
a noticeable absence of interest in or
even proper appreciation of classical
music. Among the undergraduates
attempts to secure noted musicians
for entertainments here have gradu
ally been abandoned because of the
failure to awaken any interest in such
programs.
The plan projected by Mr. Buehrer
would be a double benefit. It would
enable those already interested to ob
tain training under competent direr
lion which would constantly develop
their talent, while the presence of a !
well-organized and competent chorus
and orchestra in the student body
would have a far-reaching effect in
awakening and stimulating a more
genera] interest in the best music. I
