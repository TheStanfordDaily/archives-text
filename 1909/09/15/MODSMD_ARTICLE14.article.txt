" 'Going Some' is fast, furious and
funny—rich in characters, situations
and dialogue—quaint and novel —and
it's a laugh all the way through, don't
overlook that." —Al. C. Joy, in The
S. F. Examiner.
" 'Going Some' —with originality as
the big feature —sends house into
spasms of merriment —general opin
ion crystallized into the one word
'Immense' —fun at a tempo that comes
near breaking all theatrical records."
—Ralph E. Renaud, in The S. F.
Bulletin.

I " 'Going Some' is one long laugh—
; without a let-up for four acts —really
refreshing—something you can laugh
at without blushing." — Waldemar
i Young, in The S. F. Chronicle.
" 'Going Some' gets away quickly
' and keeps a rapid gate from start to
! finish. As a production it is worthy
'to follow 'The Witching Hour.' Its
mission is to create laughs, and it
! succeeds —situations funny to the
limit of your capacity to laugh."—
i Walter Anthony, in The S. F. Call.

Special Notice.—Friday, September 17th has been designated by
the management of "Going Some" as special College Night, when
many students of Stanford and the University of California have
signified their intention of attending in a body. Special features
will lie added on this night and the orchestral selections will be
confined to the College Glees. This will undoubtedly be one of
the biggest nights that "Going Some" will experience this season,
and Berkeley Fresno of Leland Stanford, Jr., the college villian of
"Going Some" designated as the Fresno Nightingale, is resting his
'pipes' to be in special form for this occasion.
