# MUSICIANS ORGANIZE
## WILL FORM ORATORIO CHORUS AND SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. Organist Buehrer Leads New Movement to Increase Musical Interest. 
### 
Under the direction of G. C. Bueh
rer, the University organist, plans are
rapidly approaching completion for
the installation of several musical or
ganizations. These consist of a Sym
phony Orchestra and Oratorio Chorus.
Iti addition, the University choir will
be reorganized. Mr. Buelirer, in start
ing this movement, intends that the
Orchestra and Chorus shall be per
manently established, and hopes that
the interest shown in them will be
equal to that taken in the Band, Glee.
Mandolin and other musical clubs.
The Symphony Orchestra will be
entirely distinct from the University
| Orchestra, the present plan being to
| admit able performers who are de
| sirous of keeping well in touch with
j this side of music. All students and
! residents in the neighborhood of the
| University, who can attend the re
j hearsals, are eligible. There will be a
weekly rehearsal on Thursday nights.
A symphony program will be ren
dered either this semester or the fol
lowing one, and in case there is
not a full orchestra, musicians will
be secured from San Francisco.
The Oratorio Chorus is open to all
who are interested in classical music
and in the study of the great masters.
Rehearsals will be held weekly on
Tuesday nights. The chorus will sing
in the Stanford Festival this coming
spring in conjunction with the New-
York Symphony Orchestra, better
known as the Walter Damrosch Or
chestra. Mr. Buehrer is not as yet
prepared to say what Oratorio will
be rendered. The success of the Or
atorio is expected to be even greater
than that of the one held last year.
The University choir will be reor
ganized so that two choirs will be
maintained, each singing on alternate
Sundays. They will be comprised of
members who will take the choir un
der the credit, system, and any others
who desire to help out. All those who
can do so are urged by the Univer
sity organist to offer their services.
Mr. Buehrer will be in room GS
every day for tlie rest of this week,
and any one desiring to enter one or
several of these organizations can see
him there from two to four o'clock
in the afternoon.
