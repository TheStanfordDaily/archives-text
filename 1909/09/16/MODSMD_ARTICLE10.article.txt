# New Building Adjoining Book Store.
## 
### 
Construction will commence within
the next few days on a building to
be erected adjoining to the book store
and extending toward Alvarado street.
Although the lease has not been let,
it is probable that the building will
be occupied by a confectionery store.
Several applications for the lease of
the building have been made at the
business office, but up to date no def
inite arrangements have been com
pleted.
