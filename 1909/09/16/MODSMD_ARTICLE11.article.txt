Preparations are now practically
complete for (he production of Shake
spere's "Twelfth Night" on the twen
ty-fifth of this month. The costumes,
which are especially designed for this
performance, arrived to-day and a
large number of pictures were taken
this afternoon of the principals and
of various scenes in the play. These
photos will be displayed on the Quad
beginning to-morrow and will show
the beauty of the costumes.
The scenery, which will be the most
elaborate ever used in a Stanford pro
duction, is scheduled to arrive next
Saturday. Especially noteworthy in
this connection is the fact that this is
the first time a complete set of new
scenery has been purchased for the
staging of a student play.
The arrival of the costumes and
scenery will greatly facilitate the work
of the cast, in putting the final touches
to the production as dress rehearsals
can now be held regularly next week.
From this time on the cast will de
vote their attention to developing the
finer points involved in the play.
Considerable attention is also directed
toward bringing out, to its fullest ex
tent, the element of comedy which is
to be found in the lines and situations
of "Twelfth Night." The play contains
many clever and humorous situations,
and it is the intention of the cast to
make these a strong feature of the
production.
