# TENNIS IS RECOGNIZED
## POPULAR SPORT PUT ON SAME BASIS AS TRACK. Executive Committee Grants Privilege of German "S" to Men Making Tennis Team. 
### 
The executive last night decided
to take official cognizance of tennis
as a sport by placing it on the same
basis as track. Any one making the
team will be given the privilege of
wearing a German "S," while the Var
sity letter will, as usual, be given only
to those securing a victory. The priv
ilege will be extended to all teams
since 1908. A silk playing-shirt with
a small "S," like that on the track
uppers will also be given to the men
making the team. This action by the
Executive Committee was taken on
account of the prominent place tennis
is playing in present-day athletics.
The committee appointed by the
Executive Committee to have charge
of the try-outs for yell leaders has
no powers of selection but is merely
to carry on the trials while the final
choice remains with the Executive
Committee. It was decided to extend
these try-outs for one week in order
to give every one a chance.
An Intercollegiate Debating Com
mittee consisting of P. .J. Batkin, '10,
G. F. Morgan, '10, and J. E. Shelton,
'10, was appointed to make the usual
arrangements with California as to
the annual debate.
As ne.v' situations arise the Inter
collegiate agreement develops weak
nesses and in the hope of correcting
these deficiencies A. E. Roth, '09, was
appointed to make a note of all points
which should be corrected. R. B.
Wheeler, '10, reported that all the
trophies were safely enclosed in the
cases of the visitors' room of the li
brary, and the possession of them was
turned over to the permanent cus
todian, W. D. Fletcher, '11.
