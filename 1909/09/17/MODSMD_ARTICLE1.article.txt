# TWO GAMES TOMORROW
## VARSITY FIFTEEN WILL BEGIN SEASON'S SCHEDULE. Barbarians and San Jose High School Will Meet, Cardinal Teams on Stanford Field. 
### 
With a strong, veteran scrum and
a crippled backfield the Stanford
Varsity will open their season to
morrow afternoon, when they meet
the Barbarian fifteen, of San Fran
cisco. This game will be called on
Stanford Field at 3:30, just after the
conclusion of the Freshman-San Jose
High School contest, which is sched
uled to begin at 2:15. This season
the Barbarians have their usual light,
plucky pack and their fast, sensational
backfield. Accordingly, an interest
ing struggle should result when they
meet the heavy, aggressive Cardinal
forwards.
Cheda and Fitting have been prac
tising at front rank during the last
two weeks, and will occupy those
positions Saturday. The remaining
scrum men are all veterans at their
respective places, but in the backfield
Scott, Cook, and Stolz are essaying
new positions. Cook has been shifted
from the three-quarter line to first
five-eighth, while Scott has been
changed from center to half.
The Freshman scrum remains pract
ically the same, but the 1913 backs
will be radically different. Mitchell
will reappear after an absence of a
week, Fyfe going out to center. Cass
moves from half to wing, Kern be
coming the other wing. Worswick is
shifted from wing to half, and Ellis
will be tried at full.
A minor injury to Captain Mitchell,
which has kept him off the field for
the last few days, will prohibit his
playing to-morrow. Following are the
line-up 3 of the Varsity and Freshman
teams, as they will be Saturday:
Varsity—Cheda, Fitting, Dole, Craw
ford, Minturn, Pemberton, Thorpe,
forwards; Mackenzie, wing forward:
Scott, half; Cook, Stolz, fives; San
born, center; Holman, Drew, wings;
F. Brown, full.
Freshmen —Frank, Stevens, Lull,
Duryea, Laird, Murlin, Newman, for
wards; Bly, wing forward; Worswick,
half; Arrell, Mitchell, fives; Fyfe, cen
ter; Kern, Cass, wings; Ellis, full.
