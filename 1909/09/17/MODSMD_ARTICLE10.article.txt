# TICKET SALE MONDAY
## "TWELFTH-NIGHT" SEATS MAY BE OBTAINED SEPTEMBER 20. Ten Tickets Will Be Sold to Each Person.â€”University Orchestra to Play at Performance. 
### 
Next Monday morning at 8 o'clock
seats will go on sale for the English
Club's production of Shakespeare's
merriest comedy, "Twelfth Night."
Beginning at that time and continu
ing up to the evening of the perfor
mance, Saturday, September 25, tickets
may be procured either at the Univer
sity Bookstore on the campus or at
the Stanford Pharmacy in Palo Alto.
Despite the fact that "Twelfth Night"
will be by far the most expensive
play ever staged in Assembly Hall
by local amateurs, the usual scale of
prices will prevail. Reserved seats
may be obtained for one dollar, 75
and 50 cents. In order to avoid the
disagreeable possibility of speculation
not more than ten tickets will be soli
to any one person.
The committee in charge of the pro
duction has made every endeavor to
give the public at large the entire
house to choose from, when the sale
begins on Monday morning, and con
sequently only the few complimentary
tickets necessary for the local press
have been withheld. As neither the
play committee nor the cast have been
permitted to purchase seats in antici
j pation of the regular sale, those who
undergo the trouble and disadvan
tage of standing in line on Monday
may be assured of a clean sheet from
which to make their selection.
Pictures of the different members
of the cast in the various scenes of
the play were taken yestreday and
were placed on the quad this morning,
i The many views give an excellent
idea of the rich costuming which will
J be a feature of the piece.
The results of the try-outs for the
university orchestra were so encour
aging to Leader R. M. Ford, '09, that
he at once signified his intention of
having his musicians in readiness for
the performance of "Twelfth Night."
With this purpose the orchestra is
now holding daily rehearsals and
! should be well trained by the 25th
of the month.
The work of the cast has matured
so rapidly under the direction of F.
L. Mathieu, the coach, that but few
; rehearsals will be necessary during
j the days intervening before the eve
ning of the performance. These will
be held in Assembly Hall, the final
dress rehearsal occuring on Thurs
[ day, the 23d.
