# Women Walkers to Take Trips.
## 
### 
The women's branch of the Stan
ford Trampers, the newly organized
walking club of the University, is
contemplating several jaunts to Kings
Mountain and other near-by points of
interest. The club was organized by
Mrs. Allan and prominent women of
the student body and is open to all.
Any one interested in the matter
should see Miss R. Galvin, '10, to
whom is intrusted the duty of enroll
ing new members.
