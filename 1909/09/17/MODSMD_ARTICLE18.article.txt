In the discussion of the boating
question among the undergraduates
there has been created a false impres
sion as to the condition of Student
Body finances which makes the pros
pect for the present year appear much
more auspicious than it is in reality.
The situation in brief is as stated
before in these columns. The year
opens with unpaid bills totalling in
the neighborhood of $M,OOO. This is in
fact a deficit of last season. During
the present year the receipts will be
some $5,000 less than last year ow
ing to the fact that the contests are
on the Stanford campus. Then if the
expenses this year equalled those of
last we would close the season with a
deficit of over $S,OOO. The proposed
limit of $1,000 on boating would cut
the expense by about ,000 which
would still leave a probable deficit of
$5,000.
These figures indicate the need of
retrenchment in all lines and furnish
a strong argument against the con
tinuance of boating which, even if
limited to $1,000 this year, will neces
sitate a much larger outlay the fol
lowing season in order to keep up
i lie equipment.
