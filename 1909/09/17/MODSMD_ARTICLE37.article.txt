# California Adopts New Scrum.
## 
### 
An innovation in Rugby tactics has
been adopted by Coach "Jimmy"
Schaeffer of California at the sugges
tion of Howe, the imported Australian
coach. Instead of the usual forma
tion in the scrum, California will play
the"three, two, three" scrum where
the wing forward is drawn in and
played with the pack. This is the
style of play used by the Wallabies
and the crack Australian teams. The
Freshmen will not utilize the new play
but will continue in the old style.
