# BOTH FIFTEENS WIN
## BARBARIANS AND SAN JOSE LOSE TO CARDINALS. Varsity Scores 16 to 0 Freshmen Are Victors, 23 to 0.—Both Teams Are Improved. 
### 
Both the Varsity and Freshman fif
teens defeated their opponents with
apparent ease last Saturday afternoon
on Stanford Field. The Varsity in its
first game of the season, totaled a
score of 1G to 0 against the Barbarians,
while the Freshmen rolled up twenty
three points to none for the San Jose
High School.
The exhibition of Rugby given by
the Varsity should make the present
football season a record one. Even
in the absence of several veterans, the
backfield work was good, both in pass
ing and kicking. The scrum, also,
played as good ball as could possibly
be hoped for in an opening game.
The Freshmen showed marked im
provement since their previous games.
The many changes in the back field
made by Coach Presley in the last
few days of practice were respon
sible for much of the improved play
ing. Of the backs, Mitchell was easily
the star by reason of his individual
work. Kern, Arrell and Cass played
good, consistent Rugby, as usual.
There is room for improvement in
the scrum, especially in getting the
ball out. In this respect the San
Jose forwards had the advantage.
The games in detail:
Varsity vs. Barbarians.
Each half saw eight points marked
up, two tries and a goal in each.
Crawford kicked off for the Varsity,
and within two minutes and a half
took the ball over the line for a try,
on passing by Drew and Cheda. Craw
ford also kicked goal. Towards the
end of the half, Cook, Scott and Hol
man figured in the second try, Hol
man touching the ball down. Crawford
failed to convert. Score, 8 to 0.
In the second half, Elliott kicked
off for the Barbarians. Cheda made
the first tally on a pick-up. Crawford
converted. Soon after this, Elliott, of
the Barbarians, failed in a place kick
from near the center of the field. Two
substitutes were responsible for the
last Stanford score. On ail easy pass
from Towne, Sundell went over for
a try. Crawford failed to convert.
Final score, 16 to 0.
Freshmen vs. San Jose.
The first-year men tallied fifteen
points in the first half. From near

of the San Jose line, and passed to

verted. Arrell and Mitchell marked
up the next try, Mitchell converting.

caught up the ball and scored single
handed. Mitchell completed the first
