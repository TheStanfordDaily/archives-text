The call issued by Trainer "Dad'.'
Moulton for men to do fall training
in track should bring out a large
squad of candidates. The advantage to
be gained by the personal supervision
and coaching of Stanford's trainer
should be a sufficient incentive to every
Freshman not on the football squad
who intends to do track work next
semester. For much more individual
attention can be given the men this
semester than is possible with the
larger squad in the spring.
For men who have not participated
in track athletics in preparatory
school, fall training furnishes an op
portunity to receive coaching which
will be of inestimable value in secur
ing a good start in the spring. And
it has been demonstrated many times
that men with no previous experience
have been developed into point winners
through consistent training methods.
A team can not be maintained without
men from which to select. The call
should be answered by a squad which
will furnish "Dad" with abundant ma
terial from which to develop a winning
team next spring.
