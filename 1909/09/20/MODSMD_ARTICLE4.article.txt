# EFFORTS TO LOCATE H. HOOKER ABE UNAVAILING.
## Whereabouts Unknown Since Leaving Campus on September 1.â€”Intended to Enter California. 
### 
Word has been received by students
upon the campus from Los Angeles,
asking for their cooperation in an en
deavor to locate H. Hooker, who came
to Stanford this year with the inten
tention of registering, but left after
failing to secure admission.
The last word received by his rela
tives was on August 20 and all ef
forts of his uncle, J. D. Hooker, of
Los Angeles, to locate him have so
far proven futile. No one on the cam
pus has heard from Hooker since his
departure on September 1, when, in
a conversation with R. W. Poindexter,
'10, he signified his intention of enter
ing at Berkeley. He took little money
with him and his personal effects were
left in his room on the campus.
