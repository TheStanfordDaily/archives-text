# OPEN TRACK SEASON
## SING UP FOR FALL TRAINING TOMORROW NIGHT. Truck Will Be in Good Condition by Wednesday.â€”New Men Urged to Turn Out. 
### 
The fall track season will be opened
to-morrow night by a rally held at
the training-house at which Captain
Scott and Trainer Moulton will ad
dress the men and give them advice
on training. All men who are inter
ested in track work, especially fresh
men, are urged to sign up for the
fall season as the extra training under
the supervision of "Dad" Moulton will
prove invaluable in the development
of new material.
Instead of almost completely re
building the track as had been pre
viously planned, it was decided to har
row it and put on another coat of cin
ders. This work is now almost com
pleted and it is expected that the track
will be in first-class condition to he
gin work on Wednesday morning.
No definite arrangements have as
yet been made in regard to a fall
track meet, although an invitation has
been received to enter a team in the
Portola meet to be held in San Fran
cisco during the festival. According
to Captain Scott a meet may be held
on the Varsity track, after the foot
ball season is over, in order to give
the men who have trained during the
fall a chance to compete. The rally
will commence promptly at 8, and
every one is requested to be on hand
at that time.
