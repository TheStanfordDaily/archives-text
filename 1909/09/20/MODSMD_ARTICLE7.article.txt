# CHAPEL IS FILLED IN MORNING AND EVENING.
## Dr. Jordan Speaks at Regular Service and Memorial Exercises Held for Mrs. Lanktree. 
### 
The pulpit of the University Chapel
was lilled yesterday by the Reverend
D. Charles Gardner, who preached an
excellent sermon on "Christ and Chris
tianity." "Although we may have our
doubts as to the divinity of Christ and
as to the efficacy of the Christian re
ligion, nevertheless we have to accept
Christ as a fact in history," declared
the chaplain. "The three years' active
service which Jesus gave the world
are the three greatest in our history.
The fact that he spent thirty years in
preparation for these three should
encourage us to make the most of
these our years of preparation for
life's work and not to become im
patient."
In the evening, a short memorial
service was held in memory of the
late Mrs. Lanktree, matron of Roble
Hall. Dr. D. S. Jordan, Mrs. O. L.
Elliott and Miss S. Hyatt were the
speakers, and each in turn paid high
tribute to the departed friend of the
University. In his address, Dr. Jor
dan said that the one quality of Mrs.
Lanktree which most impressed him
was her absolute faithfulness. Miss
Hyatt, on behalf of Roble Club, said
that no higher tribute could be paid
Mrs. Lanktree than that, her system of
administration was being retained by
the women of the Hall this year.
