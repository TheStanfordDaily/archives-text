# TO USE EIGHT SCRUM
## NEW FORMATION TO BE TRIED IN 1913 GAME TO-MORROW. Freshman Fifteen to Line Up Against Palo Alto.—Horton Appears for Practice. 
### 
The mid-week game to-morrow will
be between the Freshmen and Palo
Alto High School, commencing on
Stanford Field at 4:45. Besides the
fact that Palo Alto is always one of
the strongest fifteens that lines up
again against the first-year men, the
contest Wednesday should be excep
tionally interesting in that it will be
the first time that any Cardinal team
has ever used the eight pack. After
practicing the three-two-three scrum
for two afternoons, 1913 will utilize
the new formation against the high
school players to-morrow.
With the end in view of giving the
eight scrum a thorough and exhaus
tive trial, Coach Presley began yes
terday by training the entire squad
of forwards in its principals. In all
probability the three-two-three will
supplant the two-three-two pack in
both games Saturday as well as in
Wednesday's contest.
For the first time since the adop
tion of Rugby as an intercollegiate
sport, H. L. Horton appeared on the
field as a member of the Varsity squad
yesterday afternoon. In the old game
Horton was a star, being the only man
to make a Varsity position in his
Freshman year. Rugby, however, at
first failed to attract him, and until
this season no amount of persuasion
could induce him to join the squad.
Coach Presley will make no material
change in the Freshman line-up for
to-morrow's game. Practically the
same men who met San Jose last Sat
urday will start the game to-morrow.
It is probable, however, that many
substitutes will be used during the
course of the match.
The probable line-up is:
Freshmen —Frank, Stevens, Lull,
Duryea, Bly, Laird, Murlin, Newman,
forwards: Worswick, half; Arrell,
Mitchell, fives: Fyfe, center; Kern,
Cass, wings; Ellis, full.
Palo Alto — Forwards, Thoburn,
Looney, Olen-Feffer, Lockwood, Hen
ley, Boulware, Wlison; half, Darsie;
fives, Risling, Matheson; center, De
Groff; wings, Holme, Thoburn; full,
Hutchenson.
