# VALUABLE COLLECTIONS GIVEN TO UNIVERSITY.
## Extensive Additions Made to Local Specimens of Foreign and Domestic Fish. 
### 
The collection of fishes that is main
tained by the Department of Zoology
was considerably augmented this year
by the addition of some very valu
able collections and specimens that
were received during the summer
months.
J. Buelna forwarded from Monterey
the first specimen of a rare genus of
porpoise that has been seen by the
scientific departments here. The Na
tional Museum now only possesses
four speciments of this kind of fish
consisting of the skulls of the animal
only, while their appearance in pri
vate museums is very rare. This is
the first of its kind that has ever been
captured at Monterey and has been
classified by the Department of Zo
ology as the Lagenorhynchus obli
quidens.
W. H. Rich, '09, and C. Gilbert, '13,
under the direction of Associate Pro
fessor J. O. Snyder, of the Department
of Zoology, gathered a collection of
fresh-water fiph during the summer
for the United States Fish Commis
sion, amounting to about 800 speci
mens. The majority of these will be
retained by the University for the
University collection, while some are
to be forwarded to Washington.
A. Seale, who is a graduate of
Stanford, has presented Stanford with
a collection of 58G specimens of fiph
commonly found in the waters about
the Philippine Islands. Seale is now
acting for the government as a com
missioner of fisheries, and it was dur
ing his term of office as an official that
he secured this valuable collection of
tropical fishes.
