In the Interclass Tournament no
handicap is given, the men meeting

events, the singles and doubles. This

semi-finals. The winning man in the
singles and winning team in the
doubles receive class numerals. All
men taking college work are eligible.
The next handicap Singles Tourna

It is expected that the three new
courts, now in process of construction,
will be completed in time for this
tournament.
