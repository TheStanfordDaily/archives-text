# WOULD BUILD PLUNGE
## MANY FAVOR PUBLIC BATHING FACILITIES. Encina Club and Skull and Snakes Hear Plans for Proposed Swimming Tanks. 
### 
The recent warm weather has
aroused considerable agitation among
a number ot' students for the estab
lishment of public bathing facilities
on the Campus. Several plans have
been proposed, the most feasible of
which were presented yesterday eve
ning to Encina Club and to Skull and
Snakes.
The plan presented to Encina Club
is one which would make use of the
old plunge in the basement of the
wrecked Gymnasium. By the laying
of a cement floor and the establish
ment of pumping and drawing facili
ties, an excellent swimming tank could
be provided. Dr. Jordan and Treas
urer Lathrop have both expressed
themselves in favor of its establish
ment. J. P. Hemphill, *09, and In
structor W. A. Hillebrand first pro
posed the scheme and both of them
believe it feasible. Hillebrand has
undertaken to estimate the cost of the
necessary work, and, as soon as he
can determine the water supply of the
old wells near the Gynasium, and the
horse-power necessary to pump it, he
can give definite figures. Sewer con
nections would have to be installed
and lockers built according to his
plan.
The plan proposed to Skull and
Snakes favors the establishment of
an open-air tank, which later could
be roofed in. Although costing more
than the Hemphill-Hillebrand plan,
it is thought to be more desirable. A
committee will confer with the faculty
shortly and get the sentiment of that
body on the matter, as well as figures
on the cost of construction and main
tenance.
Yet another plan has been proposed
to tap the main running from Felt
Lake and fill Lake Lagunita during
the fall semester. The promoters
of this would have bath-houses built
along the shore and a competent
swimmer employed to safeguard the
bathers.
