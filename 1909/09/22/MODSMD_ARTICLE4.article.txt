# ENCINA CLUB MEETS
## IMPORTANT MATTERS DISCUSSED YESTERDAY EVENING. President Swickard Speaks to New Members and Ably States Needs of Club. 
### 
The first meeting of Encina Club
held yesterday evening was one of
considerable importance to the club
membership. President J. B. Swiek
ard, '09, who presided for the first
time, brought up several matters of
vital interest in his address and asked
the men to take them carefully under
consideration. He spoke especially to
the new members of the club, ex
plaining to them the purpose of En
cina Club, its methods of adminis
tration and what is expected of all
members.
It is the purpose of the new admin
istration to continue the efforts to
ward securing the use of the old un
used rooms to the right and left of
the club room as a committee room
and as a library. These are felt tc
be essential needs of the Hall. The
club also plans to replace the old
worn-out billiard-table with a new one
this semester. A committee was ap
pointed to investigate this matter.
The club voted in favor of the in
stallation of a public telephone pay
station in the Hall, in case the neces
sary permission can be secured from
the Business OiTice. The men find that
one telephone is inadequate, and in
convenient for long distance telephon
ing. The old phone will be retained
in case the new one is secured.
President Swiekard also asked the
men to consider the wisdom of making
use of the swimming-tank in the base
ment of the wrecked Gynasium. It
has been found that the tank was un
injured by the earthquake and it i.->
felt by many that good use could be
made of it as a public plunge.
