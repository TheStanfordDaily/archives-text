# TRACK SEASON BEGUN
## PRELIMINARY WORK IS STARTED BY BALLY. Captain Scott and Trainer Moulton Urge Men to Come Out for Fall Training. 
### 
The fall track season was opened
last, night by an informal rally in the
training house. Track Captain L. S.
Scott, '10, and Trainer Moulton gave
short talks in which all men were
urged to come out, with the result
that seventy-two men signed up for
the pre-season work. The greater
part of these were Freshmen and
Sophomores.
Scott informed the men that at
California active fall training was in
progress and that if Stanford wanted
a winning team this year, the men
here would have to turn out now and
do some good hard work. He said
that the men who trained now would
probably have the privilege of repre
senting the University in meets held
before Christmas, as several invita
tions to compete had been received.
Moulton spoke on similar lines and
laid emphasis on the advisability ol'
novices at track work coming out
for training. He pointer to the number
of men who were point-winners last
year yet who never had had experi
ence on the cinders, and said that any
Freshman who worked conscientiously
while in college was sure to be an
"S" man before graduation.
