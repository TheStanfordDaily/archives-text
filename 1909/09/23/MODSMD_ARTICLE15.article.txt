The decision of the Executive Com
mittee to offer prizes for a new sons
and yell for use on the bleachers
this year was made with the desire
to secure productions which would
possess real merit and be worthy of
a place among the best of Stanford's
songs. The response to this offer
should be general and the efforts of
the composers directed toward sub
mitting manuscripts which will be
fully up to the standard of former
years. The honor of writing a song
or yell which is to be used for years
by Stanford rooters is no slight
achievement and this contest should
result in the contribution of many
good manuscripts in order that the
committee may have a wide choice in
selecting the song and yell which are
deemed the best that Stanford writers
can produce.
