# NEITHER TEAM SCORES
## FRESHMEN AND PALO ALTO PLAY 0 TO 0 TIE CONTEST. Formation of Scrum Is Tried by Coach Presley After Two Days Practice. 
### 
With two evenly matched teams
fighting equally hard, the Freshman
and Palo Alto High School teams
played a 0 to 0 tie game yesterday
afternoon on Stanford Field. It must
be noted in favor of the Freshmen,
however, that they were under the
handicap of trying out a new forma
tion in the scrum, the "3-2-3" ar
rangement of the forwards. The chief
interest of the game lay in this new
experiment. While the Freshman for
wards secured the ball in the scrum
a good part of the game, they off-set
this advantage by heeling it out to
the half-back too fast, forcing him
to fumble repeatedly. This accounted
for the comparatively few passing
rushes started by the backs, and in
some degree for their apparent lack
of aggressiveness. This drawback in
the scrum can easily be remedied with
more practice in the new formation.
First Half.
Neither team was near to a score,
and the ball was kept in the center
of the field for a good share of the
period. After Mitchell's kick-off the
Freshmen rushed the ball to their
opponent's end of the field, and for
I a few minutes had the advantage near
(the middle of the half. Kern, at
wing, received a bad kick in the head,
necessitating his removal from the
game, Bay ley taking his place.
Second Half.
While both fifteens were within a
very narrow margin of a score after
half-time each succeeded in fighting
it off, and saving themselves by kick
ing out of danger. Soon after the
whistle, Risiing, of Palo Alto, secured
the ball and ran down the field for
25 yards to within a. few yards of the
1913 goal-line. Here the obstinacy of
the Freshmen forced the pig-skin back
and forth across the field with no ad
vance. This was perhaps the hardest
fight of the day. Palo Alto showed
her fighting spirit in the same way
along farther in the period, when the
Freshmen were almost over her line.
The line-ups:
Freshmen—Ambrose, Bly, Frank,
Duryea, Laird, Murlin, Lull, Newman,
forwards; Worswick, half; Arrell,
Mitchell, fives; Fyfe, center; Kern,
Bayley, Cass, wings; Ellis, full.
Palo Alto—Soper, Looney, Olsen,
Leffer, Henly, Ramsey, Wilson, Bill
ware, forwards; Darsey, wing for
ward; Templeton, half: Risiing, five;
Matheuson, Lockwood, center three
quarters; Howe, Thoborn, wings;
Hutchinson, full.
