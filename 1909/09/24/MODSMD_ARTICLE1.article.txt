# GOOD RUGBY PROMISED
## CARDINALS WILL MEET STRONG TEAMS TO-MORROW. Varsity vs. Olympics; Freshmen vs. St. Mary's; Olympics Have Many Stanford Men. 
### 
To-morow will bring both rugby
fifteens into action on Stanford Field.
The Varsity, for the second game of
its schedule, will line-up against the
Olympic Club team at H:MO, at the
conclusion of the first contest of the
afternoon begining at 2:30, in which
the Freshmen will meet the St.
Mary's College fifteen. Without doubt
both games will be interesting from
every standpoint. Many former Stan
ford players are included in the Olym
pic line-up. These are, Goodell, ex
'09, Laumeister, ex '07, Erb, '11!, a
member of last year's Freshman team,
Miller, '08, a veteran Varsity player,
Hickey, ex 'OS, Molfino, *07, Brennan,
'07. Freeman, one of the Olympic for
wards, was a California Varsity
player for two years. St. Mary's,
from the record the team has made
thus far this season, has an excep
tionally strong team, and promises
a hard fight for the Freshmen.
The Varsity scrum will be used for
the first, time this year in the new
"3-2-3" formation, which the Fresh
men tried on Wednesday. Among
the forwards Horton is the only re
cruit since the Barbarian game last
Saturday. Roth, after an absence of
two weeks, necessitated by a torn
muscle, will again appear in the lin
up at center three-quarters. The
other backs will be the same.
Among the Freshmen, Harrigan,
Baumgarener and Thoburn will take
their places on the tirst team, Har
rigan and Baumgartner will work to
gether at side rank, while Thoburn
is to play first five-eights, replacing
Arrell, who goes to center. Fyfe,
from the latter position, has been
moved up to front rank.

the four teams to-morrow.
