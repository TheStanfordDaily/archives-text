# Play Committee Holds Meeting.
## 
### 
The Sophomore Play Committee
met last night at the Pi Beta Phi
lioiise and discussed plans for the an
nual second-year production. The
only definite action taken was the
selection, as coach, of F. Mathieu who
has so successfully trained the casts
of most of the recent Stanford plays.
The committee has not, as yet, con
sidered any particular plays but ex
pects at its next meeting to investi
gate a number which have been sug
gested by Coach Mathieu.
