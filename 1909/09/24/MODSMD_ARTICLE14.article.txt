## 
### 
At the rehearsal of the band last
night, twenty-seven men participated,
and it is probable that several more
new men will be added to this num
ber. The band makes its first ap
pearance at the football game to
morrow afternoon, and will have a
larger membership than it has had
for several years. At the rehearsal
last night, in addition to the usual
Stanford songs, several new pieces
were practiced which will be rendered
to-morrow. In the future the band
will hold rehearsals twice every week,
on Monday and Thursday evenings.
