William Shakespeare's comedy of
"Twelfth Night," or "What You
Will," is to be produced in the
Assembly Hall to-morrow evening
under the auspices of the English
Club with a cast chosen from the
dramatic talent of the entire Uni
versity. The cast, coach, scenic
effects and costuming will make
"Twelfth Night" a fitting opening
to what promises to be a record
year in Stanford dramatics. F. L.
Matliieu has already demonstrated
his worth as a director of comedies
and light farces, and to-morrow
evening his superior efficiency in
more serious work will lie proved
to the University public as it long
ago was to the outside public. The
poetic and pictorial beauty of the
piece has been brought out to the
fullest extent as has been the rol
licking humor of the lines and
situations abounding throughout
the comedy scenes. Among his suc
cesses at Stanford, Coach Matliieu
numbers "His Excellency the Gov
ernor," "7-20-S" and"The Liars."
The curtain disclosing the open
ing scene of "Twelfth Night." will
ring up exactly at 8:15. Despite
the fact that the present acting
version requires eleven scenes
which are distributed throughout
the five acts, the rapidity with which
the changes were made at the dress
rehearsal last evening insures the
ending of the play at a seasonable
time. The many sets of scenery have
been provided by a San Francisco
studio and are all absolutely new.
Never has such pretentious costum
ing been attempted in a college pro
duction in Assembly Hall as will
characterize "Twelfth Night." Each
member of the cast has journeyed
to San Francisco to be especially
fitted, and as a result becoming cos
tumes are the unalterable rule, add
ing greatly to the convincing and
picturesque effect of the ensemble
scenes.
The University orchestra, under
the leadership of it. M. Ford, '09, will
make its first appearance this semes

ter. The orchestra now boasts o
twenty pieces, the largest organ iza
tion in its history. Incidental musk
behind the scenes will bo rendere*
by a string quintet under the directioi
or J. J. Hill, *09.
Tickets are still on sale at the [Tni
vei-sity Bookstore and the Stanfon'
I'h arm a cy. After o'clock Satur
day evening tickets may be secured at
\s:onibly Nail.
