# BOATING IS REVIEWED
## CAPTAIN J.C. HUSTON DISCUSSES OUTLOOK FOR CREW. Pres. Jordan and Dr. Angell Express Themselves as Favorable to a Regulated Sport. 
### 
Those wlio have interested them
selves in the subject of boating and
the question as to the advisability of
continuing this sport during the com
ing season, have been seeking to ar
range the conduct of the sport and
the training connected with it, in a
manner which will meet the objec
tions brought against it.
As boating was conducted last year,
many members of the faculty consid
ered the sport injurious. Acting upon
the knowledge of this sentiment, Cap
tain J. C. Huston lias taken up this
side of the question and has suc
ceeded in securing the approval of
some of those, who have so far taken
a decided stand against the contin
uance of the sport, provided that
rowing is carried 011 under proper
regulations.
Dr. Frank Angel 1, chairman of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, expressed
himself to Captain Huston as in favor
of rowing as a sport, but wishes to
see it carried 011 under sufficient reg
ulations to provide against physical
injuries to members of the crew.
Dr. Jordan stated that he had no
objections to this branch of athletics
if it was approved of by Dr. Williams.
When interviewed by Captain Huston
Dr. Williams expressed himself as a
staunch supporter of rowing and did
not consider it physically injurious,
crediting the injuries received by
members of the last Varsity crew to
other causes than the mere training.
Captain Huston has formulated
plans by which he anticipates the
reduction of expenses attendant upon
boating. To do this, he hopes to con
duct most of the training upon La
gunita, while he would also reduce
the number of trips to Redwood to
only two a week. Training upon the
Oakland Estuary would also be
eliminated according to his plans.
He further expresses himself as
anticipating a greater Student Body
interest in this sport during the com
ing season, 011 account of the fre
quency of regattas that have been
planned. He hopes to arrange for
three races during the year instead
of one as has been the program in the
past, one to be held at Redwood, one
at Richardson's Inlet and the third
upon the Oakland Estuary.
