## STANFORD UNION ASSURED SUM APPROXIMATING $17,000. Funds Secured by Efforts of Present Officers to Be Augmented by Student Body. 
### 
Due to the efforts of those now in
charge of the collection of funds for
the Stanford Union Clubhouse and to
I lie interest taken in the movement by
the alumni, the campaign for sub
scriptions during the past four months
lias met with much greater success
than was anticipated by the officers
of the Union. The present actual or
ganization and work upon the plans
have only been in operation for four
months, yet the resulting figures show
that a working basis has almost been
secured and that with an active co
operation by the Student Body, ac
tual construction is not very far dis
tant.
About $17,000 has been subscribed
so far, while to constitute a working
basis $25,000 is needed. When this
figure has been reached the present
plans of the officers of the Union are
to start actual construction upon the
building.
These excellent results have been
due to a great extent to the interest
taken by the alumni, and as they have
so generously assisted in the collec
tion of the necessary funds, the com
mittee in charge now has turned to
the Student Body for asistance to
complete the amount necessary. Stu
dent Body President Shelton will ap
point a committee of eight or ten to
canvass the campus in an endeavor
to raise a sum by subscription within
a few days.
To further aid in the completion of
this fund, the committee has planned
for a benefit Rugby game to be played
within the next two weeks between
the Varsity and a team to be picked
from the Alumni. This fifteen will
include such former stars as C. F.
Ijaumeister, '07, G. J. Presley, '07, and
S. Vail, 'OS.
Future benefit games have also been
contemplated during the Rushy sea
son and during the baseball season.
