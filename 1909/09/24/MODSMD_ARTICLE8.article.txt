The report ot' the subscriptions al
ready made to the Stanford Union
should be sufficient to awaken a new
interest in the project among the
members of the student body. Such
a response from the alumni not only
assures the ultimate success of the
plan for the erection of a clubhouse
on the campus, but also indicates that
the proposed Stanford Union may l>e
a reality within a very short time.
The original estimate was for a
building to cost $50,000, but it was
planned to start construction as soon
as half of this amount had been raised,
the remainder being secured tempor
arily as a loan from the Hoard of
Trustees. Within four months $17,000
have been raised among alumni and
faculty alone so that only a small
part of the $25,000 required is still
to be subscribed before the work on
the building begins. The result is
a strong evidence of the loyalty and
interest of the alumni in all that per
tains to the welfare of the University.
It is now the time for the members
of the Student Body to do their share
in the raising of funds for the Union.
The alumni have shown a spirit which
is worthy of emulation by the under
graduates. After such a response by
the past generation of Stanford men
it is but just that those now in col
lege should assist in the movement
for the advantages of the Stanford
Union which will be of much more
direct benefit to those on tho campus
than to the graduates who have been
away for a number of years.
When the students have shown an
active and substantial interest in
raising the funds necessary to con
struct this building which will do so
much to unite and harmonize the in
terests of the undergraduates, the
alumni will be still more willing to
assist in the work. When the com
mittee to be appointed by President
Shelton takes up the work of raising
funds in the Student I tody there
should be a willing and generous re
sponse.
