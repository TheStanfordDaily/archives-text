# SCORE TWO VICTORIES
## OLYMPICS DEFEATED, 3 TO 0; ST. MARY'S LOSE. 23 TO 0. Both Varsity and Freshmen Win on Saturday.—Freshmen Are Much Improved. 
### 
Two victories were scored by Stan
ford rugby teams last Saturday. The
Varsity defeated tlie Olympic fifteen
by the the narrow margin of I! points
to nothing, while the Freshmen reg
istered a decisive victory over St.
Mary's College by the score of 23
points to nothing. Both games were
played in a drizzling rain, with the
ball and field slippery. Despite this
fact the playing was remarkably fast,
honors in this respect going to the
first-year men, who displayed vastly
improved form, and who fought hard
throughout their game with the San
Franciscans. The Freshmen forwards
were particularly agi'essive, both in
following up and in advancing the
ball. They stopped not a few of St.
Mary's chances for passing rushes.
It, must be said, however, that each
member of the Freshman team con
tributed his share to defeating St.
Mary's.
Varsity vs. Olympics.
The only score of the contest was
made soon after Crawford's kick-off
in the first half. Dribbling was the
means employed for getting the ball
over the Olympic line. The Cardinal
forwards securing the ball, rushed
it through half the Olympic team
for thirty yards, Cheda figuring prom
inently and finally carrying it over
for the first and only try. Crawford
failed to kick a fairly easy goal. Sev
eral times after this Stanford was
within a very short margin of scoring,
only the inaccurate passing of her
backs, and the touch-kicking of Briggs
and Freeman of the Olympics prevent
ing the tally.
Freshmen vs. St. Mary's.
Mitchell kicked off for the Fresh
men, and for some time the ball was
played in St. Mary's territory. The
only score of the first half was made
in the middle of the period. After
the ball had been heeled for a free
kick, Mitchell scored a clean goal
from near the center of the field.
Score, 3-0.
The second half saw four trys ant;
conversions. The first try came afte •
a plucky run by Thoburn through
several opposing players. He passed
to Mitchell near the line. Mitchell
converted. Thoburn, Mitchell and
Kern figured in the next tally. .Mit
chell almost, scored single-handed,
but within a few yards of the goal
line was tackeled, and had to pass to
Kern, who scored. Mitchell again
converted. The next tiiree points
came when Harrigan caught a short
kick, advanced a few yards, and
passed to Murlin, who scored. The
conversion was by Mitchell.
The last try was made by last play
ing on the part of the backfield. Mit
chell secured the ball, and had a clear
field ahead for a try. He dropped the
ball, however, but Cass caught it up
from the ground and scored easily.
Mitchell finished the count by a goal.
Final score, 23-0.
