# SHOW IS A SUCCESS
## ENGLISH CLUB PRODUCTION IS FAVORABLY RECEIVED. Largea nd Appreciative Audience Witnesses Shakespears' "Twelfth Night Saturday Evening. 
### 
That a little touch of Shakespeare
now and then isn't such a bitter
pill after all for a college audience
to swallow was thoroughly demon
strated by the manner in which
"Twelfth Night" was received by the
packed house which greeted the an
nual play of the English Club on Sat
urday evening. As was to lie expected
nothing occurred which in any way
tended to mar the traditions of the
Stanford stage. The omnipresent
Palo Alto boy with his dog were there
in all their glory; great numbers of
"queeners'" came trooping in through
out the greater part of the first act;
the customary boquet had to be passed
up over the footlights, and the usual
laughter greeted the love-making of
certain characters. But taking it all
in all, the performance was most ac
ceptable. The scenery was good, the
orchestra was excellent (for the most
part), and the players were thoroughly
at home upon tlie stage. Great, cred
it. is due Mr. Mathieu for the ex
cellent "business" in which he so
ably coached his proteges and which
did so much to bring out the humor
of the lines. The stage pictures were
beautifully done and were greatly
helped by the rich costuming of the
characters.
To criticize the individual charac
ters is a thankless task, and at best,
presents the ideas of but one indivi
dual, tlie writer. As a whole, how
ever, they are to be congratulated
upon the showing which they made.
The audience seldom expects to hear
or know what a Shakespearian actor
is trying to say, but. is does expect that
the actors themselves shall know,
in the play of Saturday evening, with
but one exception, namely, Malvolio,
iliev did not seem to realize the true
I
! meaning of the lines which they were
; delivering. (!. F. Morgan who handled
jtliat. individual's destiny upon the
boards, seemed to have had some con
ception of what his lines called for.
His playing was consistently excel
lent, and never failed to bring down
the house. As Vialo, Miss Porter was
good only in the straight-away por
tions of the part; the remainder had
a tendency to become too tragic and
melodramatic. C. A. Christ in. as
Feste the clown, was Tambourine of
"7-20-8" through and through, not only
in actions and gestures, but also in
his quick, jerky, and exceedingly in
distinct enunciation. Practically all
of his witty sayings were losl upon
the audience. Miss Ozier, as .Mar'a.
did much to carry forward the action
of the play. The jovial, rough and
mischief-loving Sir Toby was tak'Hi
care of by R. Woodville in a. : o o
what too blustering manner which ' ft
but little opportunity for climaxes,
lie was good throughout. K. Cham
berlain as Sir Andrew failed to make
his lines heard. W. Cohen as Orsino
was a true Shakespearian actor, slow,
dignified and in love with his part.
Miss Marshall, as Olivia, made a stri
king and beautifully dignified picture
upon the stage, but failed to live up
to the possibilities of the part. The
minor characters were as follows:

Fabian, H. A. Lewis; Valentine, P. M.
Ogilvie; Sebastian. W. 1\ Fuller;
Curio, C. M. Albright; Sea Captian, F.
Hilton; First Officer, R. J. Miller;
Ladies in waiting by the Misses A. K.
Shinn, M. B. Barlow, A. L. Chapman,
and H. Sobey; Attendants on the
Duke, Second Sailor and Second Of
ficer by J. C. Huston, J. A. Killian,
N. M. Day, H. Ilarle, M. Y. Malone,
I and Iv. C. Woodcock.
A word of praise must be spoken for
the orchestra, which under the able
leadership of R. Ford, did exception
ally well, considering the short time
it has been organized.
