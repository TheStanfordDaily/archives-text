# Receipts from "Twelfth Night" Large.

### 
The production of "Twelfth Night,"
even with the elaborate costuming and
expenditure for new scenery, will
Drove a profitable venture to the Eng
lish Club, as the receipts at the box
ofice for the play Saturday evening
totalled $894.75. This amount is just
$200 in excess of the amount taken
in when the English Club produced
"Arms and the Man" lasi year, but
the larger expense' for staging the
Shakespearean comedy will make the
net proceeds no larger than for the
former production. The proceeds from
"Twelfth Night" were also materially
lessened by the unfortunate occur
rence of inclement weather on Sat
urday.
