# MUCH INTEREST SHOWN
## MAW STUDENTS TO TRY FOR BONNHEIM PRIZES. Work on Essays Has Been Berlin by Some and Others Still to Come Out. 
### 
Much interest, has already been dis
played in the Bonnheim Dissertation
for this year. Several have already
announced their intention of trying for
the tempting cash prizes offered, and
from the number of inquiries made
to Professor Alden of the English
department who has charge of the
matter, it is conjectured that several
others have it under consideration.
The subject this year offers excel
lent opportunities, being upon the
subject "Moral Aspects of Public vs.
Private Control of Public Utilities."
There are prizes both for manuscripts
and for a public oratorical contest.
There will be five prizes of $25 each
for the five best essays, and one prize
of $125 for the public discussion. The
manuscripts will be due on October
25, and the public discussion will be
held on December 3.
An outline of the manuscript, set
ting forth clearly the method of treat
ment, is to be handed in at the same
time as the manuscript, both enclosed
in a sealed envelope under a nom de
plume to secure absolute fairness of
judgment. The manuscripts must
contain not less than 8,000 nor more
than 12,000 words. In the oratorical
contest the decision is to be both on
material and delivery.
