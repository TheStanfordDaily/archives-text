### 
The amount of advantage there is
in a week of practice, with an im
proved scrum, was shown this after
noon, when the Freshmen sent the
Palo Alto High School team to de
feat, 14 points to 0. A week ago
Palo Alto held the first-year men
to a 0-0 score. The Freshmen dis
played a better knowledge of the
game to-day, and played more accu
rately. They fought hard throughout
the first half, but in the second ap
peared satisfied with the eleven points
already scored and did not fight as
hard as before.
Three tries were made in the first
period. After fifteen seconds of play
Murlin caught up the ball and scored.
Mitchell did not convert. With the
ball any one's, apparently, Thoburn
secured it and ran 15 yards, finally
passing to Fyfe, who made the second
try. Mitchell converted. Mitchell
scored three points on a pass from
Thoburn, after both had dodged sev
eral men. Mitchell failed to convert.
The second half saw no score until
the last half minute of play. A drib
bling rush took the ball to the Palo
Alto line, where Thoburn passed to
Mitchell for the final score. Mitchell
did not convert. Final score, 14-0.
