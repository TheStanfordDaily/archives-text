### 
The Mandolin Club held its first
meeting and practice last evening.
The club was organized with ten first
mandolins, ten seconds and seven
guitars. The members decided to
start practicing right away and made
the provision that a fine of twenty
five cents would be levied on every
player absent at practice. An assess
ment of one dollar was also made on
each member to buy new music.
