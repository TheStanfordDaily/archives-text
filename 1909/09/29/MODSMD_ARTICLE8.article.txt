At the meeting of the Civil En
gineering Society last evening, an
important resolution was adopted
which will require all future mem
bers to present a paper on some en
gineering subject. This new action
will no doubt produce a tendency to
raise the society to a higher scholar
ship basis. Several talks by members
of the society followd the regular
session.
