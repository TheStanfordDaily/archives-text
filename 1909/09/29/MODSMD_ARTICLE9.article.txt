# CRITICISM ATTACKED
## REVIEW OF "TWELFTH NIGHT" AROUSES PROTEST. Attitude of Critic of English Club Play Scored in Communication by F.E. Hill, '11. 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I am taking the privilege which
a student of the University possesses
of expressing himself through your
columns, to state a few things con
cerning the review of the English
Club Play, "Twelfth Night," which
appeared in your columns last Mon
day. I should not venture to offer
objections against the article to which
I refer did I not believe that the
larger portion of the University felt
toward it as 1 do, and, in addition,
If it were not my conviction that the
first Stanford Shakespearean produc
tion in the last five years should not
be stamped by the report of it as
unsuccessful, when in reality it was
considered by most who saw it to be
one of the best efforts that local
dramatic talent has made for some
time. The heading, to be sure, and
portions of the critique, stated that
"Twelfth Night" was a success, but
the impression left with the reader
was contradictory to such an an
nouncement.
All will agree, 1 believe, that there
are good plays and bad in university
dramatics, just as there are in pro
fessional, and that productions which
measure up as highy successful in the
former class, should be given credit,
and not the severer scrutiny which
might fit an offering of the regular
stage. I mean, that if "Twelfth Night"
stands high with "Arms and the Man,"
"His Excellency the Governor," "7-20-
8," etc.. it should be given credit for
doing so, and not rated as though it
should match up to the dramas given
by high caste companies in New York
or San Francisco. As a college pro
duction, "Twelfth Night" w r as gener
ally considered a success; its review
did not give it credit for being one.
The flawless standard apparently
set by the critic for this performance
is in itself not fair, but this attitude
was not the only injustice done it.
The report states that with a single
exception the characters did not seem
to understand their lines, and, in fact,
gives credit to but one performer of
the entire cast. Even if judged by
the professional ideals seemingly
adopted, the players of last Saturday
night's play would scarcely merit such
a criticism. If possessing other faults
attributed to them, surely not all the
cast, one excepted, can be accused of
not giving a correct interpretation of
their parts. The critic seems alone
in his opinion, as several faculty mem
bers and others of a qualified nature,
expressed themselves as particularly
impressed with the insight shown by
those who have been characterized
as "boisterous," "melodramatic," and
merely "forwarding the action of the
play." It would seem that either the
critic was embittered against the per
formance as a whole, or was not him
self aware of what should be the
correct rendition of (he lines.
This is not intended as a defense
of "Twelfth Night;" it is a protest
against a misleading report of it. If
the play had not been an artistic suc
cess, 1 would be the last to voice a
protest of this kind. But judged by '

other Stanford productions, this per
formance was generally considered
highly successful. Its cast was made
up largely of the most finished players
of last year's performances, and T
believe they sustained their respective
previous reputations. There were
certainly weak spots, as pointed out
in the review, but the production, as
a piece of college staging, did not
merit the attitude adopted toward it,
and, even if judged by professional
standards, can not be said to have
been misinterpreted in general, al
though imperfections were evident.
