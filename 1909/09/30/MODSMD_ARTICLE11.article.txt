severe disappointment to the men who
are interested in the sport, but in the
present condition of boating facilities
and Student Body finances is for the
best interests of the Associated Stu
dents.
In the consideration and final de
cision of the matter, it has been dif
ficult to harmonize the actual, pract
ical necessity of maintaining ;i sound

men who have proven their interest
and loyalty in it.

real Stanford Spirit has been fur
nished in recent years than that evi
denced in the loyolty evinced by the
coterie of boating men. Before being
taken over by the Associated Students
the sport was supported entirely by
the membership of the Boat Club with
an exhibition of sacrifice not dupli
cated in our athletic history. Since
that time the men engaged in boat
ing have been no less loyal in their
