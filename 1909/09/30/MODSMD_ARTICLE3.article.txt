# BOATING DROPPED AS INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORT
## Executive Committee Adopts Resolution Which Formally Marks Discontinuance of Boating on Intercollegiate Basis. 
### 
The existence of boating as
an intercollegiate sport was
ended by action of the Executive
Committee last evening by the
adoption of the following: "He
solved, That boating at Stan
ford be dropped from the list
of intercollegiate sports."

Boating was formally dropped
from the list of intercollegiate sports
by action of the Executive Committee
at the regular session last evening,
after a discussion and agitation of
the matter occupying a large part of
the time in every meeting of that body
since the regatta of last spring. By
the resolution adopted last night, the
sport will 110 longer be conducted
under the auspices or sanction of the
Associated Students.
At the meeting last evening Cap
tain .J. C. Huston, '10, appeared before
the committee and set forth the plans
of the boating men, furnishing esti
mates of the necessary expenditures
for the coming season, as well as out
lining several modilications in the
training methods designed to meet the
objections directed against the sport
in the past. Following this report,
a two-hour discussion ended in the
adoption of the resolution discon
tinuing boating on an intercollegiate
basis.
The formal action of the committee
was unanimously as follows: "lie
solved. That boating at Stanford be |
dropped from the list of intercolleg
iate sports."
In conjunction with this official
resolution the committee adopted the
following memorial, setting forth the
standpoint from which the question
had been considered.
"The Executive Committee has been
influenced in its decision by the fol
lowing considerations:
"The continuance of boating under
existing conditions is impractical in
the present or prospective state of
Student, Body Finances. Within eiirht
years a replacement fund of $2F>,000
will be necessary for the bleachers
on Stanford Field, which, according
to expert engineering opinion, can not

be expected to last beyond that time.
This calls for a yearly payment to
the sinking fund of from $.'5,000 to
$4,000 in debt and is also paying
eight per cent interest on a $500 loan
made to meet current expenses at
the beginning of the year. Last year,
with boating, the deficit was over
$3,000. Temporary provisions by re
striction of the boating budget would
be ineffective as the need of new
equipment would ultimately increase
this budget indefinitely.
"Owing to the natural conditions of
situation, boating can never be other
than an artificial and fostered sport
at this University. The expenditure
of a sum sufficient to carry on the
sport properly would take an undue
proportion of the money available for
the use of the entire Student Body,
devoting it to the advantage of an
extremely small minority.
"While the conditions under which
boating is conducted may become
more advantageous at some future
time, the Executive Committee does
not feel justified in mortagaging the
resources of the Student Body for an
indefinite period in order to main
tain the sport until it may be estab
lished on a better basis.
"Notwithstanding a conflict of med
ical opinion on the subject, it is the
belief of the Executive Committee,
gathered from observation of local
conditions, that the sport has proven
injurious to a larger proportion of
participants therein than any other
branch of athletics.
"Participation in crew under exist
ing conditions necessitates the sac
rifice of an undue amount of time to
the sport, resulting in neglect of Uni
versity work to a far greater degree
than is possible under any other
branch of sport."
In regar<i to flic action of the Kx
ccutive Committee hist night, crew
e:i|!t>in J. C linrtop, '!(>. said: "Until
the crew men have been called to
gether it would not he known .iiist
what they would do regarding boating.
If it is favored by the men, a boat
chib maj he organised similar to the
one which existed here before row
wast ikon over by the Student
Body."
