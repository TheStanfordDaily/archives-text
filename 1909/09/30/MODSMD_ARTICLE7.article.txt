# TO PLAY FOR BENEFIT
## STANFORD UNION FUND TO BE INCREASED BY RUGBY GAME. Varsity and Picked Team Will Contest October 15.—Receipts for Student Contribution. 
### 
Plans are on foot for the playing
of a rugby game on Friday, October
15, the gate-receipts from which will
be added to the fund representing
the student body contribution to the
Stanford Union. Two strong teams
will contest, the Varsity and a fifteen
picked from alumni and Varsity sub
stitutes. The Varsity will play pract
ically in its present line-up, since
Coach Presley does not wish the for
mation to be broken up. As many
tickets will be sold as possible at an
advance sale conducted by the com
mittee in charge of raising funds
for the Union.
Seven Varsity players and two sub
stitutes are at present on the injured
list —a remarkably number for any
one time. Practically the entire back
field is suffering from inaction from
more or less serious hurts. Captain
Mitchell and Cook, the veteran play
ers at five-eights, are inactive, as
well as Holman and Reed, wings.
Scott, at half, has been absent from
practice for several days. These play
ers are either suffering from minor
injuries or are just recovering from
a serious hurt. They may be ex
pected back in the game at any time.
In the pack, Cheda and Minturn will
not be able to play for an indefinite
period, but are the first men the
scrum has lost. In the varsity prac
tice yesterday, O'Bear and Elliott, two
who have been substituting for the
position of half, were injured in
tackling, and will be out of the game
for several days, at least.
