# MORGAN WINS TOURNAMENT.
## Final Match of Handicap Tennis Event Is Won in Three Straight Sets, 6-1, 7-5, 6-1. 
### 
The final match in the Handicap
Tennis Tournament, was won yesterday
afternoon by H. S. Morgan, '12, who
defeated R. L. Murray, '13, three
straight sets, winning 6-1, 7-5, 6-1.
Murray played a consistent game in
the preliminary rounds and with his
handicap of % of 15 against Morgan
who owed 15% was expected to make
a close contest, in the finals, but be
ing unaccustomed to tournament play
he was not able to meet the steady,
accurate play of Morgan who is at his
best in tournament competition.
Morgan was the winner of the inter
class championship last year and was
substitute player for the team which
competed in the intercollegiate
matches with California last spring.
Several entries for the interclass
tournament have been received dur
ing the past week but the representa
tion is not yet as large as was ex
pected.
