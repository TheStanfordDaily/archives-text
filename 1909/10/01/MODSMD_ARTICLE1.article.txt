# GAMES WILL BE CLOSE
## BARBARIANS AND SANTA CLAIM TO MEET CARDINAL. Varsity and Freshmen Are Crippled and Both Contests Should Be Even. 
### 
Two Rugby games will agaiu be
contested on Stanford Field to-morrow
afternoon, commencing at 2:30 o'clock.
The first game which will be between
the Freshmen and the Santa Clara
college team will be followed imme
diately by the contest between the
Varsity and the Barbarians. Both the
Barbarians and Santa Clara have met
the Stanford fifteens once before dur
ing the present season. The 1913 team
bested the collegians 3 to 0, while
Captain Elliott's men were vanquished
by the Cardinal Varsity 16 to 0. To
morrow the closeness of the Fresh
man game should be a feature, and
a far more even fight should be made
by the Barbarians, because of the fact
that both the Stanford fifteens will
be materially weaker than in the
previous games. The lengthy list of
injured men will do much to decrease
the effectiveness of the Varsity, while
the absence of Mitchell and Kern will
be a severe blow to the 1913 team.
These two Freshmen will be used on
the Varsity because of the otherwise
crippled condition of its regular five
eighth and three-quarter line. Even
with this radical change in the line
up the first-year men, aided by two
weeks' additional practice, should be
able to hold Santa Clara.
To-morrow afternoon Referee Laf
ferty will make his first appearance
on Stanford Field this fall, officiating
in the Varsity-Barbarian game. Laf
ferty's extremely efficient work during
past seasons has earned him the repu
tation of being the most expert referee
available in this state.
