# PLAN TO RAISE FUNDS
## COMMITTEE IN FIRST MEETING OUTLINES CAMPAIGN. Benefit Game for Raising of Funds for Stanford Union Set for October 15. 
### 
Definite plans were formulated this
afternoon at. the first meeting of the
committee that has charge of the cam
paign for the raising of funds upon
the campus in aid of the Stanford
Union. This effort that is to be made
upon the part of the Student Body,
follows the laudable results that have
been obtained by the Alumni in the
same cause and is the beninning of
an endeavor to raise the $7,000 that
is now needed to complete the amount
necessary for a working basis.
Friday afternoon, October 15, was
the date set by the committee for the
holding of the Rugby match between
the Varsity fifteen and the team that is
to be selected from the Alumni, the
receipts of which are to be added to
the general fund. Tickets for this
game will be placed upon sale im
mediately, while an additional num
ber of men have been appointed by
Chairman H. R. Stolz, '09, to assist
in the selling of these admittances.
The regular charge of fifty cents will
be made for the tickets.
It. is hoped by the committee that
tickets may not only be sold to those
residing upon the campus, but that
a large number may be forwarded to
friends and students who now reside
away from the University, in order
that the fund that is to be obtained
from this event may be as large as
possible.
All those who were appointed to
assist in the sale of these tickets
have been requested by Chairman
Stolz to meet, with the committee in
room 50, on Monday, October 4 at 1:15
o'clock to receive their instructions
and the tickets that are to be sold
by them.
