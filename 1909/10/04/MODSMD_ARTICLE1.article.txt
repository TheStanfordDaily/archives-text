# STANFORD WINS TWICE
## VARSITY AND FRESHMEN BEST OPPONENTS SATURDAY. Barbarians Cleverly Defeated 11 to 0. Santa Clara Overwhelmed by 22 to 0 Score. 
### 
The Barbarian fifteen, a team which
vanquished California only a week ago,
went down to decisive defeat before
the Cardinal Varsity in a hotly con
tested game on Stanford Field Satur
day afternoon. The final score of the
struggle was 11 to 0. Preliminary to
this contest the Freshmen triumphed
cleverly and easily over the Santa
Clara College team by a score of
22 to 0.
Considering their extremely infer
ior weight in I lie pack, the San Fran
ciscans did remarkably well in thi:
department of the game, and it was
chiefly through the backfield that the
various tallies were secured. Roth,
playing at first, five, outdid himself
from liie start, while Mitchell and
Kern showed true Varsity caliber.
Mitchell was in the midst of every
passing rush and was largely respon
sible for the tallies. The Stanford
pack showed encouraging improve
ment, particularly in the loose, and
with another month's practice should
be invincible.
Less than half a minute after the
initial kick-off the Cardinal registered
a try. Elliott secured and deftly
passed to Mitchell, who covered the
2. r > yards to the line. Mitchell nar
rowly missed a difficult goal.
The second try was scored late in
the first period, Roth and Mitchell
carrying the ball well down into Bar-
Barian territory. The latter soon al
ter forced his way free of the three
quarter line, and when but a few
yards from a tally passed into the
van of the forwards, Pemberton drib
bling over. Crawford's conversion
brought the total up to S points.
Sharpe's run of fifty yards, the long
est of the day, closed the first half.
The second period was bitterly con
tested, most of the play occurring in
the Barbarians' half of the field. Their
line was often dangerously threatened,
only the clever finding of touch avoid
ing a materially .larger score. Drib
bling advances by the pack and bril
liant rushes on the part of the backs
kept the visitors busy on defense.
The game was drawing to a close
when Cate was penalized for holding
the ball. This gave Mitchell the op
portunity to send (he oval squarely
between the posts on a kick from
placement.
The Stanford line continued to re
main safe during the remainder of
the game, play centering around mid
field.
The Freshmen divided Iheir points
evenly throughout each half, eleven
being secured before and a like num
ber after the interval. Following :i
dribbling rush, Thoburn obtained pot
session and registered the first tally.
Lull made the only successful conver
sion of the opening half. Thoburn war.
also responsible for the second try.
In tliis instance he received the pass
from Worswick and forced his way
through the array of opposing back.
A spectacular rally by Thoburn, Vick
ery and Arrell carried the pigskin
across the Santa Clara line for the
third time.

Indecisive play' in neutral territory
followed the interval. Finally the
1913 pack rushed the ball close to
the line, Murlin securing and scoring.
Baumgartner registered the fifth try.
Santa Clara strove desperately to
score but was effectually stopped near
the goal by tlie Freshman pack. Laird
and Houghton later dribbled carefully
down the field, Thoburn tallying the
sixth and last try. Cass converted.

initial kick-off the Cardinal registered
a try. Elliott secured and deftly
passed to Mitchell, who covered the
2. r > yards to the line. Mitchell nar
rowly missed a difficult goal.
The second try was scored late in
the first period, Roth and Mitchell
carrying the ball well down into Bar-
Barian territory. The latter soon al
ter forced his way free of the three
quarter line, and when but a few
yards from a tally passed into the
van of the forwards, Pemberton drib
bling over. Crawford's conversion
brought the total up to S points.
Sharpe's run of fifty yards, the long
est of the day, closed the first half.
The second period was bitterly con
tested, most of the play occurring in
the Barbarians' half of the field. Their
line was often dangerously threatened,
only the clever finding of touch avoid
ing a materially .larger score. Drib
bling advances by the pack and bril
liant rushes on the part of the backs
kept the visitors busy on defense.
The game was drawing to a close
when Cate was penalized for holding
the ball. This gave Mitchell the op
portunity to send (he oval squarely
between the posts on a kick from
placement.
The Stanford line continued to re
main safe during the remainder of
the game, play centering around mid
field.
The Freshmen divided Iheir points
evenly throughout each half, eleven
being secured before and a like num
ber after the interval. Following :i
dribbling rush, Thoburn obtained pot
session and registered the first tally.
Lull made the only successful conver
sion of the opening half. Thoburn war.
also responsible for the second try.
In tliis instance he received the pass
from Worswick and forced his way
through the array of opposing back.
A spectacular rally by Thoburn, Vick
ery and Arrell carried the pigskin
across the Santa Clara line for the
third time.

Indecisive play' in neutral territory
followed the interval. Finally the
1913 pack rushed the ball close to
the line, Murlin securing and scoring.
Baumgartner registered the fifth try.
Santa Clara strove desperately to
score but was effectually stopped near
the goal by tlie Freshman pack. Laird
and Houghton later dribbled carefully
down the field, Thoburn tallying the
sixth and last try. Cass converted.

The Barbarian fifteen, a team which
vanquished California only a week ago,
went down to decisive defeat before
the Cardinal Varsity in a hotly con
tested game on Stanford Field Satur
day afternoon. The final score of the
struggle was 11 to 0. Preliminary to
this contest the Freshmen triumphed
cleverly and easily over the Santa
Clara College team by a score of
22 to 0.
Considering their extremely infer
ior weight in I lie pack, the San Fran
ciscans did remarkably well in thi:
department of the game, and it was
chiefly through the backfield that the
various tallies were secured. Roth,
playing at first, five, outdid himself
from liie start, while Mitchell and
Kern showed true Varsity caliber.
Mitchell was in the midst of every
passing rush and was largely respon
sible for the tallies. The Stanford
pack showed encouraging improve
ment, particularly in the loose, and
with another month's practice should
be invincible.
