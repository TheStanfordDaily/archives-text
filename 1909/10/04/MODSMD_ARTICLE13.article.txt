As a means of raising funds for the
erection of the Stanford Union, the
work of the committee engaged in
distributing tickets fort lie benefit
rugby game should receive the sup
port of every member of the Student
Body and Faculty. This furnishes an
opportunity for aiding the movement
for the clubhouse by subscriptions o!'
a very small amount, enabling overs
one to contribute to Ihe fund which
has been, as yet, raised entirely by
ihe alumni. As the advantages of
the Union when completed will Ik
enjoyed by the campus community,
the response to this call for aid in
raising the $7,000 now needed in order
to start building operations, should be
of a character to demonstrate a real
and active interest in the project on
the part of the undergraduates.
The proposed plan of sending tick
ets to those interested in the institu
tion and thus inviting contributions
from many who would not be reached
by those in charge of the regular
subscription list, should also consid
erably augment ihe money raised by
the local sale, if this idea is carried
out by every member of the committee.
