# Physiology Club Holds Meeting.
## 
### 
Last Friday afternoon in the Physi
ology building the Physiology Club
held its first social meeting of the year
with an attendance of nearly forty, in
cluding visitors. An informal pro
gram consisting of games and "stunts"
afforded the entertainment, after which
supper was served. It had been
planned to have this meeting in the
hills, but weather conditions made this
impossible and the Physiology build
ing was used instead.
