## Men Will Be Called out for Fall Work on Diamond Within the Next Week. 
### 
Fall baseball practice will start
within ;i week, and it is probable that
next Friday or Monday will see the
first call for candidates by Coach
Presley. The lateness of the fall work
this year is accounted for by the fact
that more baseball men than usual
have been engaged in football play
ing. Consequently, it was thought ad
visable to wait until the rugby sea
sou had progressed somewhat, and the
candidates had been thinned out. The
men signing up will report three
times a week under the leadership of
two of the older men on the Varsity
squad, and players of all classes will
be asked to report at this time. The
usual work will continue for about
a month as a preparation for the base
ball season beginning in February.
