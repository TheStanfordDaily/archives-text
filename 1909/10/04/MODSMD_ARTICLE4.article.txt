# TALKS ON GAMBLING
## GARDNER SCORES PRACTICE IN STRONG SERMON Speaks of Its Effect upon Individual and Society and Urges Its Discouragement.

"is Gambling Immoral?" was the
subject of an especially strong ser
mon by the Reverend I). Charles Gard
ner in the University Chapel yester
day morning. •> Taking a comprehen
sive view of the subject, the preacher
traced the gambling spirit from its
origin to its final development, and
urged it upon the congregation to do
all in its power to stamp out the prac
tice. He said in part:
"We find the root of the gambling
spirit in the very nature of us. We
are naturally a people given to con
quest, to invention, and to exploration
and it is a perversion of this human
instinct for the excitement gained
from personal aggrandizement that we
gamble. This instinct is so developed
that gambling degrades into a mere
desire of getting something for noth
ing. If then, we wish to ascertain
the moral status of gambling, we only
have to look to its effect upon the in
dividual and upon society.
"Individually, the chief harm is
that gambling destroys the finer sen
ses and blunts the higher faculties.
At best, gambling arouses unnatural
passions and inflames the emotions,
and the terrible fascination from such
excitement paralyzes the will.
Socially, gambling affects the re
lation of man to man. Friendship is
based upon confidence, esteem, and
affection, and it can only thrive in
j an atmosphere of love and good will.
Gamblers can not be the best of
friends, for confidence between them
does not exist. Gambling adopts
; chance as a means of distributing
I wealth. It. adds nothing to the com
mon-wealth, destroys the spirit of
brotherhood and reverence, and leads
! to lying, cheating, libeling, fraud and
insincerity. It cultivates chance in
| stead of thrift.
"There is enough of enjoyment in
sports without adding the excitement
of gambling. It is a poor sportsman
who needs the feeling of personal gain
to stimulate his interest in an athletic
contest. Cheating in examination is
closely related to gambling. Playing
for a prize in a card game is another
i form of the practice.
"So in consideration of all its dele
(terious influences it. is our duty to
j stamp out the practice of gambling,,
and thereby keep our sports clean,
our social life gracious, and our na
tional life sound."
