# RESOLUTION ADOPTED
## STUDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE CONSIDERS HAZING. Recent Breach of Upperclass Regulations Results in Action by Members of Conference. 
### 
The active step toward putting into
operation the machinery for student
control was taken to-day when the
Student Advisory Committee of the
University Conference met to consider
cases which had been called to the
attention of its members, and adopted
resolutions which place the committee
on record as definitely undertaking to
control the actions of the undergrad
uates in matters of conduct affecting
the University as a whole.
The initial meeting of the commit
tee was called to consider the question
of hazing and disturbances between
the underclasses, as there have lately
been several breaches of the regula
tions passed by the committee of up
perclassmen early in the semester in
which hazing or any interclass dis
turbance after the rush was strongly
disapproved. The immediate occasion
bringing the matter under consider
ation was the practice of campus Soph
omores going to Palo Alto in a body
creating disturbances and carrying on
hazing practices.
At the meeting to-day several of the
men who have been taking part on
these occasions were called before the
Advisory Committee and told of the
attitude taken 011 this question as
embodied in the following resolution:
"The Student Advisory Committee
approves of the regulations in remird
to hazing embodied in the resolutions
of the committee of upperclnssiuen
early in the semester and will con
sider further disturbances between
underclassmen or hazing as breaches
of good order and as matters calling
for action by this committee."
Owing to the manifest misunder
standing on the part of the under
classmen as to the scope and inten
tion of the regulations adopted by the
committee of upperclassmen, which
was called at that time in the ab
sence of any organization of the Uni
versity Conference, the Advisory Com
mittee postponed any action 011 the
special cases which have occurred up
to the present time and were under
consideration by that body. However,
(he attitude of the committee was
fully explained to (he men to-day and
further continuance of the breach of
the rules regulating the relations of
(he two lower classes will result in
an investigation of (he case by the
Advisory Committee.
The committee has full authority to
deal wilh this situation and has taken
(he initiative in an endeavor to put an
end to the objectionable features con
nected with clashes between the two
lower classes. The Student. Advisor
was instructed to personally inform
as many as possible of (he under
classmen of the attitude of the Ad
visory Committee in order that, there
may be 110 misunderstanding of the
resolution adopted at to-day's meeting.
Other cases dealing with (he under
graduates have been referred to the
Advisory Committee and are now un
der consideration.
