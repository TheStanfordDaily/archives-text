By taking the initiative in dealing
with cases of student discipline
brought to its attention the Student
Advisory Committee lias taken a def
inite stand as willing to undertake the
responsibilities incurred in attempt
ing to inaugurate a system including
a greater degree of student control.
The action of to-day was the first step
in a policy in the pursuance of which
the committee will assume the con
trol necessary to deal with situations
called to their attention. Such a
policy, sanctioned and supported by
faculty and students alike, will ulti
mately result in the establishment of
an effective system of student govern
ment.
The specific action in regard to haz
ing needs little comment, as the at
titude of the large majority of the
Student Body is identical with that of
the committee. The upperclassmen
have expressed themselves as opposed
to any underclass disturbances after
the annual rush, and there is no legiti
mate excuse for a breach of this reg
ulation, as such practices in the na
ture of hazing interfere with univer
sity work, create disturbances and ill
feeling and prevent the development
of a spirit of united interest among
the entire membership of the Student
Body.
