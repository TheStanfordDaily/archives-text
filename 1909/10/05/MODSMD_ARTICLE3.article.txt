# WILL NOT GIVE MINSTREL SHOW ON NIGHT OF VARSITY GAME.
## Combined Musical Clubs' Production Will Take Place Early Next Semester. 
### 
The committee appointed to consider
the question of a football show for
the night of the big game met yes
terday afternoon. It was the opinion
of the committee that a musical farce
or burlesque would be more appro
priate for the occasion than the min
strel show which had been planned
by the Combined Musical Clubs. This
leaves the clubs without an open date
for the minstrels, as the Schubert
Club and the Masquers have an
nounced performances for October
: and November. At a meeting of the
I club directors last night, therefore.
| it was decided to postpone the min
strel show until January 28, thus ma
king it the opening event of the spring
semester. Both clubs have started
work on their minstrel material, and
the show promises to outdo anything
of the sort previously given.
Tryouts will be held in a few days
to select, stunt and end men, the de
tails of which will be announced later.
It is still the intention of the club to
donate the entire proceeds to a fund
with which to send the track team
ea/st next summer. If no trip is
planned, the money will be devoted
to some other student activity.
