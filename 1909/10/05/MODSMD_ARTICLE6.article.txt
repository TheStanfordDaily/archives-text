# 1913 PLAYS TOMORROW
## FRESHMEN TO MEET ST. MARY'S IN SECOND CONTEST. Mitchell and Kern Will Again Appear in Backfield Division of First-Year Fifteen. 
### 
The Freshman fifteen, strengthened
materially by the reappearance in its
line-up of Mitchell and Kern, will
again face the St. Mary's team on
Stanford Field to-morrow afternoon at
4:45. Although in their first en
counter the 1913 men were the win
ners by a score of 23 to 0, the St.
Mary's fifteen is among the most for
midable aggregations which have op
posed the Cardinal first-year players
during the season. The Oakland col
legians vanquished the California
Freshmen 13 to 0 and last Saturday
held the Nevada Varsity to a 20 to 0
score. Practically the same men who
composed the team in those games
will appear in the line-up to-morrow.
Save for the addition of Mitchell
at second five and Kern at wing, the
personnel of the 1913 fifteen will prob
ably be identical with that of Sat
urday when Santa Clara was defeated.
The fact that the two backs who
figured so prominently 011 the Varsity
against the Barbarians will play with
the Freshmen will add greatly to the
speed, strength and combination of
the backfield as a whole. The for
wards have shown rapid and steady
improvement especially in their work
in the loose. Consequently, the team
should be surprisingly effective in the
contest to-morrow. The probable line
hips follow:
Freshmen—Bly, Frank. Fyfe, Duryea,
Baumgartner, Murlin, Belcher, Lull,
j forwards; Worswick. half; Thobnrn,
Mitchell, fives: Arrell, center: Kern,
Cass, wings; Ellis, full.
St. Mary's—Smith, Clinton, Bell,
O'Connell, Bonnetti. Greely, Malloy,
Sheehy, forwards; Diavola, half;
Grundell, Gallagher, fives; Dickson,
Reordon, Hughes, Starrett, three
quarters; Lehnhardt, full.
