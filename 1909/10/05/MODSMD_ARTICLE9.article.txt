concerning the schedule on which they
will run their cars on the newly com

opened between the campus and Palo
Alto. The general manager of the
railway, F. E. Chapin, of San Jose,
paid a visit to the campus to-day to
look over and inspect the work that
is being done on the track. Although
no date has been set for the day when
the company will inaugurate its regu
lar service, it will be in the near fu
ture as Chapin intimated that it would
be before the ballasting of the road
is completed. Not until to-morrow
will the announcement, of the open
ing day be made by Chapin. as he
desires to go over the tracks again
before making the decision.
The company will start their serv
ice to the campus on a fifteen-minute
schedule. The cars will run from
the bookstore to the Embarcadero
Road, the present terminus of the
Waverly Street line. Transfers will
be given to the University Avenue
line. The general manager has also
promised an additional car to bring
the students out from trains which
the regular cars will not meet.
The cars will take on and let off
passengers at all places in the Uni
versity grounds where signs will be
placed by the trolly company, read
ing, "Cars stop here on signal." The
first car will leave the corner of
Emerson and University Avenue at
6:20 a.m. At 6:30 cars will leave the
Campus, Embarcadero Road and Uni
versity Avenue and will thereafter
leave the three terminals at 5, 20, 35,
and 50 minutes past the hour until
10:20, when the last, cars will leave
the terminals for Emerson and Uni
versity Avenue. Cars will leave the
Southern Pacific station in Palo Alto
at 1.2%, 271/2, 42V 2 , 57% minutes past,
the hour. In Palo Alto as hereto
fore the company will stop on the
near side of the street to take on and
let off passengers.
The company is also going to build
a spur towards the football field so
that they may have cars on hand to
carry rush travel after football games
and track contests. A crew of men
have been busy for the past few days
putting the trolly wires in place, but
this afternoon they completed their
work. Another gang of 10 men have
been devoting their energies towards
straightening the track and leveling
it up to grade but they can not com
plete their work until after the track
has been ballasted.
