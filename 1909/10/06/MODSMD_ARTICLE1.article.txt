# ST. MARY'S LOSE AGAIN
## 1913 WINS SLOW GAME FROM COLLEGIANS BY 6-0 SCORE. Mitchell and Murlin Aid Freshmen by Spectacular Work.—Visitors Have Improved. 
### 
A penalty goal and a try made up
the small margin by which the Fresh
men won from the St. Mary's Rugby
fifteen this afternoon on Stanford
Field. The feature of the game was
the mediocre playing of both teams,
the game as a whole being rather slow.
St. Mary's displayed a better knowl
edge of the game than two weeks
ago, and her forwards were particu
larly aggressive and fast in following
up the play. This is responsible i'or
the smallness of the score as com
pared with that of the first game with
the San Franciscans, when they weiv
defeated 23-0. To the Freshmen musi
be laid the charge of poor passing
and remarkable slowness in following
up. At critical points near their own
goal line they showed a strong power
for retrieving. Mitchell, while not
doing as well in passing rushes, was
up to his standard in kicking, and he
is responsible for the first three points
of the game. Murlin, among the for
wards, was in almost every play, and
did good work in dribbling.
First Half.
Three points made up the only score
for the first half. Mitchell marked
this up by a pretty goal from an easy
after St. Mary's had been pen
alized for taking the ball from the
scrum. Outside of this the playing
was to neither side's advantage, and
centered about midfield. Team work
was at a premium, and passing rushes
were few and for the most part un
successful. .lust before the goal
kicking the only good work of the
half was done by Thoburn, Mitchell
and Kern, • who advanced the ball
cleverly. Score, 3-0.
Second 11 a It'.
For several minutes after the whis
tle St. Mary's had a short-lived ad
vantage, and the Freshmen were
forced to play a strong defensive
game. Finally, after indecisive line
outs, Mitchell brought his team-mates
out of danger by a long kick into St.
Mary's territory. Here the ball re
mained for the rest of the period, with
several exchanges of kicks by both
full-backs playing a prominent part
in the struggle. With two minutes to
play, Mitchell secured and single
handed, advonced 30 yards. There a
scrum was called, and the forwards
carried the ball over, with Frank as
the leader of the rush. Mitchell did
not convert. Final score, 6-0.

For several minutes after the whis
tle St. Mary's had a short-lived ad
vantage, and the Freshmen were
forced to play a strong defensive
game. Finally, after indecisive line
outs, Mitchell brought his team-mates
out of danger by a long kick into St.
Mary's territory. Here the ball re
mained for the rest of the period, with
several exchanges of kicks by both
full-backs playing a prominent part
in the struggle. With two minutes to
play, Mitchell secured and single
handed, advonced 30 yards. There a
scrum was called, and the forwards
carried the ball over, with Frank as
the leader of the rush. Mitchell did
not convert. Final score, 6-0.
