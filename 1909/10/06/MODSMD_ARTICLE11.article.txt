At the last session of the Executive
Committee the Trophy Committee was
instructed to procure as many pic
tures as possible of former Stanford
athletic teams, so that they may be
in readiness for the trophy room of
the Stanford Union. This feature oi'
the proposed trophy room will be
one of no slight interest to both un
dergraduates and visitors if the plan
is carried out.
In procuring these pictures of for
mer varsity teams the Trophy Com
mittee must have assistance, for the
task of collecting these old pictures
can not be performed by any one in
dividual, owing to the varied sources
from which the photographs must lie
gathered. Every one who has in his
possession or knows the whereabouts
of a picture which might lie added to
the collection should notify some mem
ber of the Trophy Committee or the
Executive Committee. The various
fraternities can be of especial as
sistance in this movement as in nearly
every house are many pictures of the
teams of former years which are un
used owing to duplication or lack of
space, which could he advantageously
used to complete (he 'iles on the walls
of the Union.
