### 
Permission has been refused by the
Board of Trustees for the erection of
a contagious ward as a branch of the
Guild Hospital, on (he University
grounds. This decision was an
nounced at a meeting of the Guild
Board held last evening. It will,
therefore be necessary to quarantine
all such contagious cases in the place
where I hey occur, as their removal
to Palo Alto is prohibited by law. The
financial standing of the board is very
good. At present only one of three
large debts remains unpaid. The last
debt paid was one for $1,000, payment
on which was made last week.
The board retains control of two
cottages in Palo Alto, adjacent to the
former Guild Hospital. It was decided
to place one of these in the hands of
a real estate dealer and reserve the
other for overflows from the main
hospital.
