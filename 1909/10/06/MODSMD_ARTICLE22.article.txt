# Reports on Student Body Finances.
## 
### 
Graduate Manager D. W. Burbank,
'09, has issued a statement which coin
pares in a general way the Student
Body's financial condition on May
15, 1909, and at the present time. At
the end of .T. E. Stewart's regime as
graduate manager, the hills payable
amounted to $2,69G.14 and the balance
on hand was $319. 29. The bills now
payable sum up to $6,679.80 and there
is $1,959.94 in cast on hand.
According to these figures the Stu
dent Body's deficit on May 15 was
$2,376.85 and is now $1,719.86. This
seemingly large indebtedness has been
caused by the necessary initial foot
ball expenditures.
