# VARSITY SCORES FIVE TRIES.
## Second Team Shows Fight in Short Game Yesterday.â€”Reed Played Scram Half. 
### 
Five tries were the result of the
Varsity's efforts against the second
team during two short halves yester
day. Each try was made in the vicin
ity of the touch lines, and conse
quently none was successfully con
verted. Considering the weight of the
Varsity pack and the number of sub
stitutes used on the second fifteen
during the last period, the latter team
held their opponents exceptionally
well.
Owing to the fact that Scott will be
absent from the squad throughout the
remainder of the season, Coach Pres
ley is again attempting to solve the
problems of finding a Varsity scrum
half. H. E. Reed, '10, the speedy
wing, was yesterday used at that posi
tion. The line-up of the Varsity was
as follows:
Fitting, McGregor. Horton, Pem
berton, Hubbard, Dole, Crawford,
Thorpe,, forwards; Elliott, Reed, half;
Roth, Stolz, fives; Towne, center;
Holman, Drew, Avings; Brown, full.
Charles S. Dole, '99, has entered the
field of journalism in Hawaii. He is
at present editor and manager of
"The Garden Island," which is pub
lished at Lihue, on the island of
Kauai.
