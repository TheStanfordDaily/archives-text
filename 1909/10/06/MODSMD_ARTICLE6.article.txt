# HENEY IS ENDORSED
## NESTORIA AND EUPHRONIA WILL SUPPORT PROSECUTOR. Good Government League Desires Students to Work at Polls Election Day. 
### 
The candidacy of Francis J. Heney
for district-attorney of San Fran
cisco received strong endorsement
yesterday evening at the hands of
Nestoria and Euphronia Literary so
cieties, which formally passed reso
lutions commending the reform move
ment in San Francisco and pledging
their hearty support to the graft pro
secutor's cause. The Nestoria resolu
tion is as follows:
"Whereas, We believe that it is a
fundamental principle of the Ameri
can Government, insuring the pro
tection of life and property, that all
offenders against the Law, whether
rich or poor, should he brought to the
bar of justice to answer for their
crimes; and,
"Whereas, The enforcement of this
basic principle of government has he
come a national problem, demanding
the serious attention of every law
abiding citizen of the United States,
by reason of the impunity with which
the laws are violated by certain of
fenders, fortified by political influence
and financial position; and,
"Whereas, The present campaign for
district attorney of San Francisco
must decide for the people of that city
whether this principle of Equality Be
fore the Law shall be enforced, or
whether immunity from prosecution
be granted offenders at the discretion
of the district attorney; and,
"Whereas, We believe that the elec
tion of Francis J. Heney will best
serve to enforce the unprejudiced
prosecution of all criminals alike, in
San Francisco, whatever their posi
tion may be; therefore,
"Be ft Resolved, By Nestoria Literary
Society of Stanford University, that
the Graft Prosecution in San Fran
cisco and the candidacy of Francis J.
Heney for district attorney be and is
hereby endorsed, â€”
"That a copy of this resolution be
spread upon the minutes and a copy
be forwarded to the Heney Club of
San Francisco."
This resolution which was intro
duced by It. B. Murphy, '08, was
unanimously adopted by the society.
J. E. Shelton, '10, introduced with a
very able speech, a similar but much
shorter resolution in Euphronia,
which was heartily seconded by sev
eral others. The Euphronia resolu
tion as adopted, is:
"Resolved, That the Euphronia Lit
erary Society at Stanford University
does hereby endorse the reform move
ment in San Francisco and extends
its hearty support to Francis J. Heney
in his candidacy for district attorney."
The adoption of these resolutions
is the first feature of a Heney cam
paign which will he carried on on the
campus, having for its object the se
en ral of a small army of student
workers at the polls November 2. L.
('. Pickering, 'Oft. has charge of en
rolling those who are willing to go to
San Francisco election day. The Good
Government League of San Francisco
has charge of the Heney campaign,
and will pay the expenses of those
electioneering. Quite a number of stu
dents have volunteered their services

.already, but Pickering desires to add
many more names to the list.
