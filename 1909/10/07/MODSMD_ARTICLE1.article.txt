# WOULD TEST LEGALITY
## PRESIDENT JORDAN BELIEVES LIQUOR LAW LEGAL. Declares Arguments Against Act Have Little Merit.â€”Citizens of San Mateo to Make Fight. 
### 
President Jordan when interviewed
late yesterday afternoon in regard to
the sale of alcoholic liquors in Menlo
Park, gave the opinion that the valid
ity of the law passed by the state leg
islature last spring to prevent the
sale of liquor within a mile and a
half of the University should be set
tled as soon as possible by the Su
preme Court. He further said tliat ho
thought the arguments declaring the
campus ending at the Museum and
the special legislation argument had
very little merit. He believes that test [
cases will necessarily have to be made
to bring the question of ihe legality of
the bill before the courts.
The saloons that are open now in
Menlo Park were granted licenses this
summer by the Supervisors of San Ma
tao County in violation of the law, de
clared President Jordan yesterday,
and that at the present time one other
license is pending. He also said that
the citizens of San Mateo County in
terested in law enforcement, have em
ployed Attorney George C. Ross to
see that the law is respected in that
county.
Dr. Jordan has prepared a brief
statement of flie puitns of the sale of
alcoholic beverages in Menlo L'ark
which follows:
"After the closing of the saloons in
Mayfleld, the one most offensive of
these, because lilted especially for stu
dent patronage, was removed to Menlo
Park., an unincorporated village in
the edge of San Mateo County. There
were a dozen or more saloons already
in this haniiet, and in time there- j
lation oL those to the University body i
became intolerable.
"In 1907, the President, assisted by
a body of students and citizens, made
a protest against the further licencing
of the saloon of Charles Meyer. The
Board of Supervisors paid no heed to
this protest. Later a student, return
ing from this saloon, was shot as a
burglar. This marked the turning
point in the matter, and strong efforts
were made to rid the University of
all men who frequented this resort.
"The last legislature framed a law
forbidding the sale of liquor within a
mile and a half of 'the grounds or
campus' of any university having 1.000
students, five hundred of them resident
on the grounds. This statute was
drawn up by the Senate Committee and
in general terms as the state consti
tution requires.
"The supervisors of San Maeo
County, in violation of law, have
granted licenses to some of these sa
loons, and one more application is i
pending, fti disregard of law those,
saloons have now been open for over |
a month.
"The citizens of San IMateo County j
interested in law enforcement hav>
employed Mr. George Ross as ;it- !
torney for the purpose of seeing thai
the law is respected.
"Probably test eases will be made
to prove the validity of the law. II
is claimed that there being but one i
such university, the statute is really i
special although drawn up in general '

terms. It is claimed also that the !
campus ends at the Museum, not at
San Francisquito Creek, as all Uni- j
vorsity peo])le had hitherto supposed j
to be the case.
"IJoth these claims should be set
tled by the Supreme Court. The tir.st
has apparently little merit; the second
has certainly none."
