There 'appears in another colum 1
of this issue an admirably clear and
lucid exposition of the present status 1
of the sale of alcoholic beverages in |
Menlo Park. Of this statement I'i\: 1
ident Jordan is ihe author. The
Daily Palo Alto heartily agrees with
the President that either the recently
passed law should be immediately en
forced or its unconstitutionality de
termined. Accordingly, it is gratify
ing to note that the adjudication of a
test case will he a matter of the near
future. Legislation has been enacted
If that legislation conforms to th"
provisions of the constitution and the
courts decide that legally the campus I
doe: extend to San Francisquito Creek,
the Menlo Park saloons should be
closed, and in as short a time a*- pos
sible. If, on the other hand, that leg
islation does not conform to tbe pro
visions of the constitution or in the
opinion of the courts campus ,
not. extend to San Francisquito Creek,
the saloons should remain open with
out fear of immediate or ultimate ir- ;
terference under this act. it is t.j the
interest of l)oth sides that, a decision i
he rendered without unnecessary dei
lay. \y Dr. Jordan says it is a mal.
ter fort lie courts, and especially for
the Supreme Court, to determine.
May they son he given the opportunity
so to do.
