Mary Adele Case.
Accompanist Augusta M. Upham
Loi don "Standard."
It is such an appearance as that
of Mary Adile Case at Aeolian Hall
last night that goes far to establish
our faith in the artistic sincerity of
ihe new world. Miss Case has a voice
of real beauty and artistic ability far
beyond the usual singer of her age.
fn fact Miss Case has little to fear
in her temerity to court, the critical
opinion of the London critics.
The Paris critics in speaking of
Miss Case's voice gave her credit of
being the singer of the age "with
tears in her voice." The power to
hold and sway at her will
