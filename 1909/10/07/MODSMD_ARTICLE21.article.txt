# MUSICAL CLUBS WILL PICK MEN FOR MINSTREL SHOW.
## Membership in Clubs Is Not Necessary to Try-Out.â€”Freshmen Are Urged to Compete. 
### 
Try-outs for tlie Minstrel Show,
which will be given on January 28
by the Combined Musical Clubs, will
be held the week alter next. Notice
is given this far in advance in order
to permit all persons who desire to
try-out to prepare their material.
These try-outs will be open to all,
whether they are members of the
musical clubs at the present time or
not. Freshmen are particularly urged
to compete for places. The main ob
ject of this try-out will be to pick
soloists, end men and stunt men.
For the solo work, the committee in
charge urges persons who can sing
standard music to compete. In ad
dition to this, men are wanted who
can sing comic, or rag-time, music.
All soloists are requested to bring
their accompaniment with them, al
though a pianist will be present for
the benefit of those who are without
one.
Among the stunt men desired, are
musical soloists, such as trombone,
cornet, banjo, guitar, saxophone, etc.,
players. Players on freak instru
ments, as musical glasses, bells or
xylophones are also needed. In addi
tion to these, stunts in the way of
monologues, dialect sketches in Dutch,
Irish, Hebrew or Negro dialect, and
short and active playlets can be made
use of. Men intending to give play
lets are not expected to be prepared
in their actual performances, but are
requested to attend the meeting. Men
adept at juggling, clown acrobatic
work, sleight-of-hand and clog dan
cing are urged to turn out.
Men who are clever at dialect, and
those who show ability at handling
minstrel material will be chosen to fill
ihe positions of end men. Ability to
sing will not be considered as an es
sential requisite. Minstrel material
will be supplied to those trying-out
under this head.
The last local minstrel show given
at Stanford took place two years ago,
and can boast of a very successful
performance. The committee in charge
plans to make this show a much more
eloborate affair than the last, by the
introduction of many stunts, songs,
monologues and playlets. The actual
date upon which the try-out will take
place will be announced sometime
during the coming week through the
columns of the Daily Palo Alto.
