# 1913 SEASON WANES
## FINAL PRELIMINARY GAME TO BE PLAYED SATURDAY. Majority of Injured Men on Varsity Squad Will Soon Reappear in Cardinal Line-up. 
### 
But one more preliminary game is
scheduled for 'the lid 3 team previous
to the intercollegiate Freshman con
test with the Blue and Gold on Oc
tober 16. Next Saturday the Cardinal
Freshmen will meet the fifteen from
the University of the Pacific. Practice
during the following week will be ex
ceedingly light save on Wednesday
afternoon when the first-year men will
face the second team for their last
line-up.
As for the work of the Varsity, as
far as practicable, short scrummages
are being held on Tuesdays and Thurs
days with merely routine practices on
Mondays and Fridays. Heretofore,
when the Freshmen have played on
Wednesday afternoon, the Varsity has
been excused on that day.
As a whole, the injured men have
been convalescing rapidly.' Cheda ap
peared on the field to-day and will
undoubtedly be seen in the line-up of
the Varsity when they meet the Olym
pic Club on Saturday. Minturn's dis
abled ankle is fast healing, and he will
probably make his reappearance in the
Stanford Union benefit game on Oc
tober 15. Captain Mitchell's shoulder
continues to trouble him. Mitchell
may be able to play in the benefit con
test, but it is possible that his next
game will be against the Castaways in
Los Angeles on October 23. Holman
is again practicing with the squad,
but it will be several days before he
will undertake any severe work.
Reed's ankle is once more in shape,
and he will probably be seen at half
in the Olympic game.
The latest addition to the crippled
squad is Roth. An injured leg will
keep him off the field for two or three
days.
