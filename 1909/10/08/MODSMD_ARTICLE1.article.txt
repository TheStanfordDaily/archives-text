# LAST GAME TOMORROW
## 1913 ENDS PRELIMINARY PRELIMINARY SEASON WITH COLLEGE TEAM. University of Pacific Will Face Freshmen. —Varsity Meets Olympics. 
### 
A final opportunity of viewing the
Freshman team in action on Stanford
Field, will be afforded the college
public Saturday afternoon, when the
1913 players are scheduled to face
the University of the Pacific. Follow
ing this game a second contest be
tween the Varsity and the Olympic
Club will be decided. The first en
counter will begin at 2:30, the last
at 3:45.
The Olympic fifteen will go on the
field with substantially the same
line-up as was the case when they
were defeated by the Varsity 3 to 0
on September 25. On the other hand
the Cardinal backfield will be in a
rather crippled condition. Conse
quently, a close score should result.
With the exception of Minturn, who
is still on the disabled list, the pack
will be composed of the regular vet
erans. Hubbard will substitute for
Minturn. Behind the scrum a few
changes will be apparent. Reed will
be seen at half for the first time,
and his work at that position will be
watched with extreme interest. If
his injury allows, Roth will again
be played at first five. As Mitchell
and Kern will both appear in the
1913 line-up, it is probable that Stolz
will be the Varsity second five, with
Towne at center and Holman and
Drew on the wings. If in condition,
Cook will be used in the three-quar
ter line.
Contrary to previous preliminary
games, the Freshmen to-morrow will

versity of the Pacific team. The pack
