### 
The membership of the Stanford
Gymnasium Club was augmented at
a meeting last evening by the election
of five new members who have shown
themselves proficient in one or more
of the branches of gymnastics.
The men elected were: H. It. Stolz,
'00, R. H. .lessen, '11, H. A. Macready,
'12, E. P. Ely, '13, and A. H. Frank, '13.
Regular practice meetings of the
club are being held every Thursday
evening in the Gymnasium, wnere the
members are working up new feats
and "stunts," both individual anil
combined, with the purpose of giving
a successful and enlivened entertain
ment this year, as well as being in
shape at any notice to put on an act
at any University entertainment. The
first appearance will probably be at
the smoker given in honor of the Van
couver team on November 6.
