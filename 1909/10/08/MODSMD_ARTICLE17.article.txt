Tomorrow afternoon Stanford Field
will be the scene of the last Fresh
man Rugby game preliminary to the
intercollegiate contest on California
Field a week later. The entire stu
dent body should be in attendance.
For the first time in four years the
Stanford Freshmen apparently have
an even chance for victory. The rela
tive support of the respective stu
dent bodies will be highly effective in
-determining the result. To-morrow
the undergraduates will be afforded
an ample opportunity to demonstrate
how forceful their support will be.
