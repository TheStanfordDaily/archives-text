# Favor Intercollegiate Basketball.

### 
California basketball men are again
agitating the matter of an intercol
legiate basketball series. Last year
they obtained the sanction of their
agreement committee for such con
tests, but as they met no cooperation
at Stanford, the matter was dropped.
This semester they have organized a
squad, elected a captain and begun
training, and if the Stanford enthu
siasts who intend to meet in the
Encina Gymnasium Monday afternoon
and plan for the season show up well,
there is at least, a possibility of having
intercollegiate basketball games here,
as in the eastern colleges.
