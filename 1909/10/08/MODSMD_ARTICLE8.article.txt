# WILL START MONDAY
## FALL PRACTICE TO BRING OCT BASEBALL MEN. Work Will Proceed under Direction of Upperclassmen.â€”Few Varsity Players Return. 
### 
Monday afternoon will see the first
gathering of baseball men for the pre
liminary work of the 1910 season,
when fall practice begins on the Var
sity diamond. All men who intend
trying for the nine next spring, who
are not taking part in football, will
be expected to sign the practice list
on the field at 4:30. Names only will
be asked for, not positions. Coach
Presley will not be able to give his
personal attention to the men, on ac
count, of the football season being at
its height now. Through lack of a
captain also, occasioned by the non
return of T. R. Cadwalader, '09, cap
tain-elect of last spring, there will be
no recognized leader of the practice
this fall. Two upperclassmen of the
Varsity squad of last year, however,
will be given full charge, and will
take the men through the usual prep
aration for the formal opening of the
baseball season next spring. The
work will consist mainly in short
practice games between the men di
vided into teams. Mondays, Wednes
days, and Fridays are set for the re
| porting of the players, continuing well
: towards the end of the semester.
Seldom has a college team been
presented with the problem now con
fronting the cardinal coaches of dev
eloping a Varsity nine. But two vet
erans will lie available this year, these
| being M. M. Mitchell, '10, and C. F.
Ganong. '10, members of last year's
: nine. L. S. Scott, '10, though still
eligible, will have his time taken np
with track work and can not be seen
on the diamond. These are the only
first-team men who have returned
this year eligible to play. The out
look, however, is much brightened by
the fact, that there are a number of
last year's second nine men, who
should make Varsity material this sea
son. These are M. O'ltear, '12, C. H.
Tallant, '11, R. C. McFadden, '10, and
B. L. Ball, '11. Members of last year's
class teams should help, also, in mak
ing a strong squad and may be devel
oped into suitable caliber. Several
Sophomores, who were unable to ap
pear last year on account of scholar
ship conditions, will sign up this fall.
The entering class may be looked to
to furnish several promising players,
many of whom are at present on the
football squad, but who will probably
be seen on the diamond after the In
tercollegiate Freshman Game. The
election of a baseball captain will be
postponed until the acutal beginning
of the season.
