To-morrow morning at 11:15 o'clock,
the second Assembly of the semester
will be held in Assembly Hall, under
the auspices of the Committee on
Public Exercises. As the speaker of
the occasion, the committee has se
cured W. McArthur, of San Francisco,
who has been prominently identified

the labor party of that city. At pres

in-chief of the "Coast Seamans' Jour
nal," a newspaper that has been dedi
cated to the interests of the working
man.
During the recent campaign against
corruption that was carried on in San
Francisco, McArthur took a promi
nent position as a strong supporter
of the movement. The speaker is at
the head of the Seamans' Union of
San Francisco, and is well known as
an authority upon questions dealing
with labor and its relations with cap
ital upon t lie Pacific Coast. He is also
recognized as a writer of numerous
articles upon this same subject and
upon matters appertaining to the posi
tion of labor unions in the west, of
which he is a staunch supporter.
McArthur has selected as a topic
for his speech to-morrow, the subject
of "Learning and Labor," upon which
question his wide experience in his
particular field of work has made him
a recognized authority.
