# Will Be no Increase of .Bus Rates.
## 
### 
The current rumor that an increase
in bus rates would become effective
upon inauguration of the railway serv
ice. is declared by Palo Alto liverymen
to be unfounded. Many carriages will
be withdrawn from the bus line serv

ice. but several firms will continue
the usual service as an experiment.
Others will confine themselves solely
1o the livery business. Rates for both
bus fare and night service will remain
the same.
