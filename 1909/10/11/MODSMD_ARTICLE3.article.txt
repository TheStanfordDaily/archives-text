# PARADE STARTS LAST NIGHT.
## Spontaneous Gathering Results from Noisy Demonstration.â€”Crowd Soon Disperses. 
### 
Springing up spontaneously with ap
parently no motive or reason for exist
ence, a parade was organized on the
campus at a late hour last, evening
and noisily traversed a section of the
Row, dispersing as quickly and with
as little visible cause as the original
organization was effected. Originating
with a noisy demonstration in another
part of the campus a small parade
started on the How and augmented
as it proceeded, grew until probably
150 men were in line, serpentining
and shouting, when the gathering was
disbanded. With no objective purpose
in view the life of the jubilee was
short.
Owing to the lateness of the hour,
the shooting of firearms and the fact
that the disturbance occurred on Sun
day evening, the incident was inves
tigated by Chairman Clark of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee, but no action
was taken and no meeting of the
committee is anticipated before the
regular session on Wednesday.
The Advisory Committee of the Uni
versity Conference took no definite ac
tion on the occurrence at its regular
session to-day.
