# VARSITY AND FRESHMEN WIN DECISIVE VICTORIES
## In Fast Battle, Olympic Club Worsted 15-0. First-Year Fifteen Slaughters University of Pacific 58-0. 
### 
From the Rugby viewpoint, Satur
day was a great day. Both visiting
teams suffered heavily under the ag
gressive onslaughts of the Cardinal
players, the Olympic Club men losing
a 15 to 0 contest to the Varsity and
the University of the Pacific enduring
an overwhelming 58 to 0 defeat at the
hands of the Freshmen. For the sound
beating administered to the San Fran
ciscans the Varsity with its crippled
scoring division needs to be com
mended. The 1913 team, however, in
its monotonous one-sided struggle en
countered but little opposition worth
the name.
The Stanford scrum, practically in
tact, 'was the bulwark of the Varsity
fifteen throughout, while spasmodic
ally the disorganized backfield would
reai> large gains, more often through
individual ability than through com
bined effort; successful team play
could scare be expected by men who
seldom practiced together and many
of whom were strangers to their re
spective positions.
Captain Mitchell is still disabled
and his brother was used in the Fresh
man line-up. This caused the reten
tion of Roth at first five and the sub
stitution of Stolz at second. Roth
was always in evidence, his heady
swerving in the open netting many
yards. Holman played brilliantly on
the wing, always doing the right
thing at the right time and contin
ually aiding the less experienced backs
with his timely coaching. Reed is a
born half. This was his first real op
portunity at the position, and he
proved that he possessed every qual
ification which the place demands.
Brown, at full, played his best game
thus far this season, excelling even
his accurate and spectacular form of
two years ago.
For the Olympics scrum half, Par
ker was in the midst of every forma
tion. Miller was continually strong
and Goodell was extremely effective
No sooner had Crawford kicked off
than Roth secured on a line-out and
passed to Stolz who transferred to
Cook, the latter scoring. The ball
continued to threaten the visitors'
goal. Finally, a passing rally in
which nearly the entire team indulged,
ended in the grounding of the ball on
the 1-yard line. From the ensuing
scrum Holman was given possession
and easily crossed for a try. The
Olympic backs then succeeded in for
cing the play into the territory of the
Cardinal. The Stanford goal was in
no imminent peril, however, and the
end of the period found the oval in
midfleld.

The first tally of the second half
was made by Pemberton who received
from Holman after the latter had
swiftly and prettily advanced many
yards through a scattered field. The
way to the next three points was
opened by Reed and Roth in a clever
advance movement. The transference
to Thorpe was followed by a quickly
executed pass to Holman who again
tallied. Reed, Holman, Pemberton and
Cook handled the ball in the order
named preparatory to the registering
of the final score. Of the five tries,
several were at a difficult angle, Craw
ford succeeding in converting none
Freshmen vs.
The Freshmen scored so rapidly
on their opponents that the game be
came completely uninteresting and
monotonous. Whatever ability the
1913 men may have, they had little
or no chance to display it Saturday.
After the opening minutes of play it
was simply a case of since at first
you did succeed, try, try again. As
soon as a Freshman back would get
nj) sufficient speed to appear formid
able, the University of Pacific men
would clear a passage for his advance,
and thus the tallying went merrily
on. The contest did not even afford
the Freshmen good practice.
Of the fourteen tries registered dur
ing the game, eight were made in the
first and six in the second period.
Mitchell's record of eight conversions
is an exceedingly good one, as the
great majority of his kicks were at
acute angles. One of Mitchell's con
versions was from a placement within
two feet of the touch lines, a feat
seldom accomplished. Following are
the line-ups:
Varsity — Fitting, Cheda, Horton,
Hubbard, Crawford,, Dole, Thorpe,
Pemberton, Partridge, forwards; Reed,
half; Roth, Stolz, Towne, fives; Cook,
center; Holman, Kern, wings; Brown,
full.
Olympic Club—Molfino, Hickey, Tul
ler, Wallfish, Brown, Webster, Aguirre,
forwards; Skov, wing forward; Par
ker. half; Cavanaugh, Laumeister,
'fives; Miller. Goodell, Briggs, three
j quarters; Erb, full.
Freshmen—Fyfe, Bly, Frank, Dur
yea, Baumgartner, Murlin, Belcher.
Lull, forwards; Worswick, half; Tho
burn, Mitchell, fives; Arrell, center;
Bayley, Cass, wings; Ellis, full.
University of the Pacific—Keyset-,

ification which the place demands.
Brown, at full, played his best game
thus far this season, excelling even
his accurate and spectacular form of
two years ago.
For the Olympics scrum half, Par
ker was in the midst of every forma
tion. Miller was continually strong
and Goodell was extremely effective
No sooner had Crawford kicked off
than Roth secured on a line-out and
passed to Stolz who transferred to
Cook, the latter scoring. The ball
continued to threaten the visitors'
goal. Finally, a passing rally in
which nearly the entire team indulged,
ended in the grounding of the ball on
the 1-yard line. From the ensuing
scrum Holman was given possession
and easily crossed for a try. The
Olympic backs then succeeded in for
cing the play into the territory of the
Cardinal. The Stanford goal was in
no imminent peril, however, and the
end of the period found the oval in
midfleld.

The first tally of the second half
was made by Pemberton who received
from Holman after the latter had
swiftly and prettily advanced many
yards through a scattered field. The
way to the next three points was
opened by Reed and Roth in a clever
advance movement. The transference
to Thorpe was followed by a quickly
executed pass to Holman who again
tallied. Reed, Holman, Pemberton and
Cook handled the ball in the order
named preparatory to the registering
of the final score. Of the five tries,
several were at a difficult angle, Craw
ford succeeding in converting none
Freshmen vs.
The Freshmen scored so rapidly
on their opponents that the game be
came completely uninteresting and
monotonous. Whatever ability the
1913 men may have, they had little
or no chance to display it Saturday.
After the opening minutes of play it
was simply a case of since at first
you did succeed, try, try again. As
soon as a Freshman back would get
nj) sufficient speed to appear formid
able, the University of Pacific men
would clear a passage for his advance,
and thus the tallying went merrily
on. The contest did not even afford
the Freshmen good practice.
Of the fourteen tries registered dur
ing the game, eight were made in the
first and six in the second period.
Mitchell's record of eight conversions
is an exceedingly good one, as the
great majority of his kicks were at
acute angles. One of Mitchell's con
versions was from a placement within
two feet of the touch lines, a feat
seldom accomplished. Following are
the line-ups:
Varsity — Fitting, Cheda, Horton,
Hubbard, Crawford,, Dole, Thorpe,
Pemberton, Partridge, forwards; Reed,
half; Roth, Stolz, Towne, fives; Cook,
center; Holman, Kern, wings; Brown,
full.
Olympic Club—Molfino, Hickey, Tul
ler, Wallfish, Brown, Webster, Aguirre,
forwards; Skov, wing forward; Par
ker. half; Cavanaugh, Laumeister,
'fives; Miller. Goodell, Briggs, three
j quarters; Erb, full.
Freshmen—Fyfe, Bly, Frank, Dur
yea, Baumgartner, Murlin, Belcher.
Lull, forwards; Worswick, half; Tho
burn, Mitchell, fives; Arrell, center;
Bayley, Cass, wings; Ellis, full.
University of the Pacific—Keyset-,
Rutherford, Fickes, Read, Slant.
Welsh, Tapp, Jereza, forwards: Tur
ner, half; Withrow, Needhani, fives;
Douglas, Stonier, McNair. three-quar
ters; Sturges, full.
From the Rugby viewpoint, Satur
day was a great day. Both visiting
teams suffered heavily under the ag
gressive onslaughts of the Cardinal
players, the Olympic Club men losing
a 15 to 0 contest to the Varsity and
the University of the Pacific enduring
an overwhelming 58 to 0 defeat at the
hands of the Freshmen. For the sound
beating administered to the San Fran
ciscans the Varsity with its crippled
scoring division needs to be com
mended. The 1913 team, however, in
its monotonous one-sided struggle en
countered but little opposition worth
the name.
The Stanford scrum, practically in
tact, 'was the bulwark of the Varsity
fifteen throughout, while spasmodic
ally the disorganized backfield would
reai> large gains, more often through
individual ability than through com
bined effort; successful team play
could scare be expected by men who
seldom practiced together and many
of whom were strangers to their re
spective positions.
Captain Mitchell is still disabled
and his brother was used in the Fresh
man line-up. This caused the reten
tion of Roth at first five and the sub
stitution of Stolz at second. Roth
was always in evidence, his heady
swerving in the open netting many
yards. Holman played brilliantly on
the wing, always doing the right
thing at the right time and contin
ually aiding the less experienced backs
with his timely coaching. Reed is a
born half. This was his first real op
portunity at the position, and he
proved that he possessed every qual
ification which the place demands.
Brown, at full, played his best game
thus far this season, excelling even
