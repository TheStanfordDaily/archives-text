The parade of last night has beu.i
the subject of' investigation by boili
the Student Affairs Committee and the
Advisory Committee of the University
Conference. The incident appears to
have been spontaneous, with no vic
ious motive whatever and thus from
the general student point of view open
to criticism only because of tb.' late
houi and the unusual noise.
However, there is another attitude
which may be taken in viewing the
matter which places the apparently
harmless occurrence in a more ser
ious position. The faculty has ex
pressed itself as opposed to any de
monstration of exuberant spirits in
such a manner as "parades" except on
usual and accustomed occasions.
Viewed thus, the parade of last night
was a disturbance which savored of
the features of the objectionable in
cidents of a year ago.
While we do not agree with this
interpretation of such an incident as
that of last evening, neither do we
concur in the idea that such outbursts
are necessary to the continuance of
a healthy student spirit. Knowing the
attitude of the University officials on
such matters it is not advantageous
to the interests of the Student Body
or the movement for student control
that such incidents should occur.
