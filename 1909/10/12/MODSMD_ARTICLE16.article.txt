# ANNOUNCE PLUG UGLY PLANS.
## Junior Farce Will Staged on Baseball Diamond the Evening of November 
### 
What may have approved an inani
mated lull in interest in the Junior
Plug Ugly has in reality been a ses
sion of planning by the committee in
charge. The time and place have
finally been decided. The extrava
ganza will be presented Friday eve
ning, November 5, on the varsity base
ball diamond. Permission has been
received from the Student Affairs
Committee, which sanctions the pre
sentation of a proper farce. The Plug
Ugly Committee will in turn stage a
piece that will be wholly inoffensive
to all. Farces in the past which might
have appeared somewhat risque, will
this year be replaced by a skit, which,
while amusing and unprudish, will be
entirely unobjectionable.
Presentation of the Plug Ugly on the
baseball diamond, upon which a stage
will be erected, is a return to the old
custom from which the 1909 class de
parted on account of the continued
rains of the winter of 1907, which
obliged the class to hold the show in
doors.
The committee has requested those
intending to submit manuscripts to
confer with any member of the com
mittee at some time previous to next
Wednesday. The committee has in
mind certain plans and believes it may
be advantageous to inform the aspir
ants of their ideas.
The sum of $25 will be awarded by
the committee for a suitable manu
script.
