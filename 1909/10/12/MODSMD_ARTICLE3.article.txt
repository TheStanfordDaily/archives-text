# STRONG ADDRESSES IN ASSEMBLY
## W. MacArthur Discusses Labor Conditions. Local Speakers Present Question of Student Control. 
### 
Interesting in all its aspects, the
second Assembly of the year was held
in Assembly Hall this morning, under
the auspices of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises. The speaker of the oc
casion, W. Mac Arthur, of San Fran
cisco, held the interest of the audi
ence by his earnestness. As he has
been identified for years with the labor
interests upon the Pacific Coast and
especially with the affairs of the sea
men in this division of the country,
he spoke with authority and a knowl
edge of his subject. Prof. A. B. Clark,
chairman of the Student Affairs Com
mittee and A. E. Roth, Student Ad
visor, spoke briefly upon the subject
of student control, explaining the
present and future status of the move
ment.
Prof. A. B. Clark spoke briefly upon
the subject of student control and
upon the possibility of its introduction
into the University. In part, Profes
sor Clark said: "The University is at
present ready to let the students use
student control, but the results ob
tained under that system will decide
the question as to whether the auth
orities can see the way clear to allow
the institution to be introduced en
tirely. Because the students have a
liking for spontaneous outbursts upon
the campus, that is no reason that
they have a right to hold these. The
professors have a right to live peace
ably upon the campus while the older
inhabitants are averse to such noisy
and untimely demonstrations. The
students must have the ability to curb
their actions as individuals and it is
now before the student body as a
question as to whether they are go
ing to show themselves willing to do
this and to express their desire for
self-government in that way."
Dr. Jordan introduced Mac Arthur as
the next speaker as a man of inde
pendence of thought and action. The
speaker chose for the subject of his
address the topic, "Learning and La
bor." In substance, Mac Arthur re
marked :
"By theory every person is born
free and equal, but in actual practice
existing conditions often make for the
determination of career.
"Education along good solid lines
is the best gift, after good health, that
one can enjoy, and it Is for the in
dividual to decide as to whether this
gift shall be used for himself or for
the benefit, of bis fellow men.
"Learning and labor are two things
in form, but only one in fact, for
learning is obtained that it might be
applied to increase profit from labor.
There should be good will between the
two classes, while in fact there is a
partition and the world of labor is

( not as sympathetic toward the college
j world as it should be to produce the
: best results.
"The main reason for this latter
j state of affairs is the fact that stu
dents enter the industrial field and act
as strike-breakers, thus bringing down
the enmity of the laboring classes in
volved in the movement. There are
many strikes where the striker is not
apparently in the right, but connected
with every disturbance of this char
acter there is a deep, underlying prin
ciple that is being evinced by the
strikers. Every strike typifies an ef
fort by a considerable number of peo
ple to secure a more equitable divi
sion of the products of their labor.
"Man has been from time imme
morial animated by one common
thought, that of the equality of man
under God.
"This is shown by the history of
the world. First, there sprang up a
religious equality among men at the
time of the birth of Christ, which was
in time followed by a political equal
ity as evidenced by such documents as
the Declaration of Independence and
English historical records. Final
equality is sought in an industrial
equality. The fact that a man has
religious and political liberty will
not be of any advantage to him if he
works hedged about by inequality and
discrimination, for a man must live."
The speaker then illustrated his
point by the citation of the conditions
upon the Great Lakes, where college
men have been employed by the in
j terests of combined capital in an en
j deavor to stamp out labor organiza
| tions in that district. The unpopu
j larity of college men with the labor
| ing classes of that district is quoted
I by Mac Arthur as a definitive illus
| tration of the effects that this entry
into the industrial field against the
laborer will have against the college
graduate.
Student Advisor A. E. Roth spoke
! to the men after the Assembly, upon
! the subject of student control, point
| ing out that the students are now in
j a position where they must decide
I whether or not they desire this
i form of government. He emphasized
j strongly the position that the Stu
dent Body must assume with relation
to the committee that will take charge
of the government under this system.
He also recited how the Student
Affairs Committee gave to the Ad
visory Committee of the University
Conference entire executive powers
over two cases of student disturbances
and in both instances the action of the
latter committee has met with success,
"rt. is now for the students," said
