Fall practice brought out sixty-two
baseball men yesterday afternoon on
on the varsity diamond. This is per
haps a record-breaking response to
the call of the coaches for prelimi
nary work. Last year at this time
but twenty-eight players were signed
up for practice. The outlook for a
successful year in baseball is, there
fore, very encouraging, despite the
fact that so few veterans will be avail
able for the creation of a winning
team. Among the men on the field
yesterday were several players, in
eligible this year, second-team men of
last season, class nine members, and
a good representation of Freshmen,
who promise to give the older players
a close fight for places on the team.
Two members of the 1909 varsity
squad have been given charge of the
work, C. H. Tallant, '11, and R. C.
McFadden, '10. Neither of the two
varsity men eligible this year, M. M.
Mitchell, '10, and C. F. Ganong, '10,
were present on the opening day.
Mitchell will probably not be seen
on the diamond until spring on ac
count of the football work taking up
his time during the period of fall
work. Ganong is expected to appear
in a suit for practice on Wednesday.
