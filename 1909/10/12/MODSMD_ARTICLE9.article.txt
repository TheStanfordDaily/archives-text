The statements made by Chairman
Clark and Student Advisor Roth in
regard to the movement for student '
control epitomize the whole situation, j
The faculty and university officials I
stand ready to grant the authority
necessary for student control and give
the plan a thorough opportunity to
justify its existence. But at the same
time the undergraduates must conduct
themselves in a manner which war
rants this privilege.
When the Student Body accepts the j
privilege of control, it must also take I
over its responsibilities. A sentiment j
of support for the actions of The men ;
chosen as representatives is what will !
be accepted by faculty and students;
alike as a willingness to assume these |
responsibilities. The plan is as yet
an experiment and for Its ultimate '
success depends upon united action.
Any attempt to belittle its effective
ness before a thorough trial, is to
hamper the efficiency of a movement
which may mean much to the Stanford !
Student Body.
