# Cotillion Not to Be En Masque.
## 
### 
A persistent rumor, which has per
vaded the campus, to the effect that
the Sophomore Cotillion was to be
en masque has been emphatically de
nied by the committee in charge. The
dance will be of the same nature as
heretofore and will not be a costume
affair.
