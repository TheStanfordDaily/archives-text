# Date for Sophomore Play Chosen.
## 
### 
That the annual Sophomore Play
should be held February 25, 1910, was
the decision reached by the Sopho
more Play Committee at a recent
meeting held at the Gamma Phi Beta
house. This date is practically the
same as that of the second-year pro
duction of last year and will fall
just, one month after the Combined
Club's Minstrel Show and the Sword
and Sandals play.
