# MASKERS SELECT PLAY
## "THE ROAD TO YESTERDAY" TO BE STAGED IN NOVEMBER. Prominent Thespians to Present Comedy in Assembly Hall under Mathieu's Direction. 
### 
The Maskers in their meeting to
day decided upon "The Road to Yes
terday," by Beulah Dix and Evelyn
Sutherland as the comedy which they
will stage in Assembly Hall on the
evening of November 19. This play
has created a great deal of interest
in the East and has never been pro
duced by amateurs. It has been se
cured for production here at great ex
pense and will be given under the di
rection of F. Mathieu, whose efficiency
as a coach is well recognized by the
student body.
The play is described in Current
Literature as "a fantasy of reincar
nation," which embodies the tlieosoph
ical theory of Karma and reincarna
tion. According to the Hindu defini
tion, Karma means the aggregate ef
fect of our acts in one life upon our
status in the next. In spite of this
apparently deep significance, the ac
tion of the play is on the comedy
order and concerns the story of Els
peth Tyrell, a romantic young lady
who after dining on Cheshire cheese
travels in a nightmare down the road
to the past. The four acts extend
over a period from the present to
ICO9 and back again. From the de
scription the character of the play will
be seen to be different from anything
ever given here.
The cast has not been fully decided
on as yet. but will be announced later
and will include in its make-up some
of the leading thespians in college.
Rehearsals will commence Monday
afternoon in Assembly Hall.
