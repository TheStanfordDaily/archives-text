charge of the latter half of the eve

Instructor IVfaloney expresses him
self as being heartily in favor of the
event and has promised to give one
of his famous blindfolded bag-punch
ing contests, which was the sensation
of the big Y. M. C. A. exhibition in
Pasadena five years ago. Pyramid and
tumbling work will be presented by
the entire club, besides specialties by
the best boxers, wrestlers and fencing
artists of the college.
It is particularly announced that
this entertainment, though under the
