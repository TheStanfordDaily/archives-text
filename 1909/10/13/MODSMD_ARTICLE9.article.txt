No action whs taken to-day by the
Student Affairs Committee in their
regular session outside the transac
tion of routine business. Chairman
A. H. Clark 'lias stated that, nothing
was done concerning the parade of
Sunday and Monday nights, and no
action by the committee is anticipated
in the future.
Cases of this character that may
now arise will fall within the province
of the Advisory Committee and this
committee will have the opportunity
to investigate and act, if it is deemed
necessary.
