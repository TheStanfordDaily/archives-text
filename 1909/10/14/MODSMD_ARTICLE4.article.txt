The fifteen Freshman Rugby players
who will battle for the Cardinal against
the .Blue and Gold on Saturday, were
announced late this afternoon by
Coach Presley. The six substitutes
who will be on the side-lines ready
for service were also selected. The
team as chosen is wholly as expected,
no changes being made in the line-up
that has been accepted as final dur
ing the last two weeks.
The captain and second five-eights
of the team will be Standish Low Mit
chell, of Los Angeles. Mitchell is be
yond a doubt the most effective Rugby
player on the 1913 squad, and bids
fair to attain varsity honors. At sec
ond five, he has been the mainstay of
the strongest Freshman backlield that
Stanford has ever possessed. Fast and
sure on offence, he is Impassible on
defence. Furthermore, his punting is
at once rangy and precise, while his
goal kicking is accurate. Mitchell
weighs ISO pounds, is 5 ft. lO 1 in.
in height and 21 years of age. He
majors in Economics and is a mem
ber of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
Probably the sturdiest man on the
fifteen is Andrew Douglas Fyfe, who is
at the same time the most diminutive.
Fyfe appears in the front rank. From
start to finish he is on top of the ball
in the loose. He uses his head at all
times and hooks with precision. De
spite the fact that he weighs but 145
and is only 5 ft. SV& in tall, there is
no more valuable player in the pack.
Fyfe is 19 years old, and registers
from Los Angeles in Electrical En
gineering.
In the middle of the front rank
there will be another small lighter,
E. P. Bly, who tips the scales at 150
and is but 5 ft. Gin in height. Illy
is ii strong hooker and fearless in
the ruck. He never stops. In nearly
every preliminary game ho played
himself to a standstill. Bly is 19
years of age, hails from Los Angeles
and majors in Civil Engineering.
The third man in the front rank of
the Stanford scrum will be Alvin H.
Frank, also of Los Angeles. Frank
has been practically assured of his
position from the very outset of the
season. lie won his place through
his never-ending fighting spirit. Frank.
Bly. and Fyfe form a trio that are al
ways battling in the very midst of (ho
game. Frank weights 150, is 19 years
old and 5 ft. 7 in.in height. He ma

jors in I-listory and is a member of
Encina Club.
Edward Charles Baumgartner, the
heaviest man on the team, will be the
second middle ranker. Although
Baumgartner did not appear for
practice until quite late in the sea
son, he immediately made his way to
the first fifteen by reason of his Rugby
experience and bis determined work
in all departments of the forward
game. Baumgartner comes from San
Jose and registers in Electrical En
gineering. He is 20 years of age, is
5 ft. 11% in tall and weighs 192
pounds.
The fifth man in the pack will be
Robert Francis Duryea in the middle
row. In weight Duryea is second to
Baumgartner, balancing the beam at
180. He is strong and consistent,'and
bis unusual height, 6 ft. 3 in., renders
him extremely serviceable in the line
out. Duryea is 19 years of age, reg
isters from Palo Alto in Civil Engi
neering and belongs to the Delta Up
silon fraternity.
Perhaps the strongest individual
player in the pack is Lane Burdine
Murlin in the rear rank. Although
far below the average of the scrum in
weight, the ready manner in which
Murlin adapted himself to Rugby and
his inherent football ability make him
a dangerous opponent. He has an
annoying faculty of suddenly appear
ing as an extra man in the midst of
a passing rush. Murlin weighs 152. is
5 ft. lIV 2 in. tall and is 19 years of
age. He is taking the pre-legal
course, hails from Long Beach and
belongs to the Phi Gamma D<Mta fra
ternity.
Linford C. Lull, Jr., another Los
Angelean, is the lock. Lull's build
is admirable for the position, and his
fighting qualities make him a valu
able forward. He has endured keen
competition for the place, but his vic
tory is clearly merited. Lull's height
is an even six feet, his weight 172
and his age 18. He majors in the de
partment of Electrical Engineering
and is a member of the Sigma Nu
fraternity.
The third member of the trio of
rear rankers is Frank Baker Belcher,
of Pomona. Belcher is one of the
few Freshmen who previous to this
fall had had some Rugby experience.
His work is never spectacular, but for
hard, consistent work he has few
peers. Belcher is a member of Theta
Delta Chi and is registered as a pre
legal student. He is 5 ft. 11 in. tall.
18 years old and weighs 118.
Scrum half, George Draper Wors
wick gained his knowledge of Rugby
as a wing three-quarter on the San
Jose High School fifteen. With a few
days of practice he appeared equally
at home at half, and consequently was
retained in that position. Worswick
is fkst and cool and bis passing ac
curate. He finds touch cleverly in
crucial moments. He belongs to the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and
majors in Economics. He is 20 years
of age. weighs 152 and is 5 ft. !> in.
in height.

Harold Thoburn, of Palo Alto, will
lie the first five-eighth. 111 former
seasons, Thoburn played at wing and
early Ibis fall he was tried at full.
He failed to do justice to himself,
however, until given a chance at five,
where be at once proved himself a
consistent and untiring ground-gainer.
Thoburn's reliable receiving and pas
sing enable him to inaugurate many
an effective rush. He is 19 years of
age, 5 ft. 11*4 it), in height and weighs
151. He majors in Psysiology and is
a member of the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity.
The center three-quarter will be
James Lee Arrell, of Moline, Illinois.
Arrell has suffered several injuries
during the season, but is at last in
excellent, condition. Although not as
formidable an offensive player as
| Captain Mitchell, he fully equals the
j latter on defense. In gaining yards
! the California center will have ;t stal-
I wart difficulty to overcome. Arrell
belongs to the Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity and registers in Economics.
He weighs 170 pounds, is 21 years of
age and 5 ft. IOVa in. tall.
Louis Cass, of Los Angeles, i:-i slated
for the position of right wing three
quarter. Cass was first used at scrum
hali', but was soon shifted to wing,
where he lost no time in making good.
Cass' work is not of the spectacular
sort; his reliability is his strongest
asset. Rut whenever the opportunity
offers, he will be in exactly the right
spot. Cass majors in Economics and
is a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
He is 19 years of age, 5 ft. 10 in.in
hight and weighs 150 pounds.
The left wing three-quarter will be
Eugene Kern. Like Mitchell, Kern has
displayed varsity caliber and as a re
sult was played in the varsity line-up
on several occasions. The dash and
grit of his work always attracts at
tention. He is speedy and invariably
disputes every inch. Kern belongs to
the Beta Theta Pi fraternity and reg
isters from Berkeley in the Economics
department. He weighs 16S, is 20
years of age and 5 ft. 11 Vz in. tall.
As full-back, Sidney Hemenway El
lis, Jr., will be the Cardinal's last de
fence. Although Ellis is excessively
cool and an accurate punter, his sure
tackling is probably his strongest
point. To pass Ellis a California back
will have to be a marvel in a scattered
field. Ellis registers from La Canada
in the Department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of the Zeta Psi
fraternity. He is 19 years of age,
I weighs 168 and is 5 ft. 10 in.in height.
The six substitutes will he Arthur
j Warren Ambrose, of Lockeford, Wil-
I liam Aiken Laird, of Lindsay, John
j Hand Harrigan, of Los Angeles, John
R. Berryman, Jr., of Los Angeles, Wil
liam W. Vickery, of Los Angeles, and
! George Harold Bayly, of Los Angeles.
1 Should it be necessary, Ambrose, Har
| rigan and Laird will be used in the
j pack, Berryman at half, Vickery at
: five and Bavley in the three-quarter
i line.

Probably the sturdiest man on the
fifteen is Andrew Douglas Fyfe, who is
at the same time the most diminutive.
Fyfe appears in the front rank. From
start to finish he is on top of the ball
in the loose. He uses his head at all
times and hooks with precision. De
spite the fact that he weighs but 145
and is only 5 ft. SV& in tall, there is
no more valuable player in the pack.
Fyfe is 19 years old, and registers
from Los Angeles in Electrical En
gineering.
In the middle of the front rank
there will be another small lighter,
E. P. Bly, who tips the scales at 150
and is but 5 ft. Gin in height. Illy
is ii strong hooker and fearless in
the ruck. He never stops. In nearly
every preliminary game ho played
himself to a standstill. Bly is 19
years of age, hails from Los Angeles
and majors in Civil Engineering.
The third man in the front rank of
the Stanford scrum will be Alvin H.
Frank, also of Los Angeles. Frank
has been practically assured of his
position from the very outset of the
season. lie won his place through
his never-ending fighting spirit. Frank.
Bly. and Fyfe form a trio that are al
ways battling in the very midst of (ho
game. Frank weights 150, is 19 years
old and 5 ft. 7 in.in height. He ma

jors in I-listory and is a member of
Encina Club.
Edward Charles Baumgartner, the
heaviest man on the team, will be the
second middle ranker. Although
Baumgartner did not appear for
practice until quite late in the sea
son, he immediately made his way to
the first fifteen by reason of his Rugby
experience and bis determined work
in all departments of the forward
game. Baumgartner comes from San
Jose and registers in Electrical En
gineering. He is 20 years of age, is
5 ft. 11% in tall and weighs 192
pounds.
The fifth man in the pack will be
Robert Francis Duryea in the middle
row. In weight Duryea is second to
Baumgartner, balancing the beam at
180. He is strong and consistent,'and
bis unusual height, 6 ft. 3 in., renders
him extremely serviceable in the line
out. Duryea is 19 years of age, reg
isters from Palo Alto in Civil Engi
neering and belongs to the Delta Up
silon fraternity.
Perhaps the strongest individual
player in the pack is Lane Burdine
Murlin in the rear rank. Although
far below the average of the scrum in
weight, the ready manner in which
Murlin adapted himself to Rugby and
his inherent football ability make him
a dangerous opponent. He has an
annoying faculty of suddenly appear
ing as an extra man in the midst of
a passing rush. Murlin weighs 152. is
5 ft. lIV 2 in. tall and is 19 years of
age. He is taking the pre-legal
course, hails from Long Beach and
belongs to the Phi Gamma D<Mta fra
ternity.
Linford C. Lull, Jr., another Los
Angelean, is the lock. Lull's build
is admirable for the position, and his
fighting qualities make him a valu
able forward. He has endured keen
competition for the place, but his vic
tory is clearly merited. Lull's height
is an even six feet, his weight 172
and his age 18. He majors in the de
partment of Electrical Engineering
and is a member of the Sigma Nu
fraternity.
The third member of the trio of
rear rankers is Frank Baker Belcher,
of Pomona. Belcher is one of the
few Freshmen who previous to this
fall had had some Rugby experience.
His work is never spectacular, but for
hard, consistent work he has few
peers. Belcher is a member of Theta
Delta Chi and is registered as a pre
legal student. He is 5 ft. 11 in. tall.
18 years old and weighs 118.
Scrum half, George Draper Wors
wick gained his knowledge of Rugby
as a wing three-quarter on the San
Jose High School fifteen. With a few
days of practice he appeared equally
at home at half, and consequently was
retained in that position. Worswick
is fkst and cool and bis passing ac
curate. He finds touch cleverly in
crucial moments. He belongs to the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and
majors in Economics. He is 20 years
of age. weighs 152 and is 5 ft. !> in.
in height.

Harold Thoburn, of Palo Alto, will
lie the first five-eighth. 111 former
seasons, Thoburn played at wing and
early Ibis fall he was tried at full.
He failed to do justice to himself,
however, until given a chance at five,
where be at once proved himself a
consistent and untiring ground-gainer.
Thoburn's reliable receiving and pas
sing enable him to inaugurate many
an effective rush. He is 19 years of
age, 5 ft. 11*4 it), in height and weighs
151. He majors in Psysiology and is
a member of the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity.
The center three-quarter will be
James Lee Arrell, of Moline, Illinois.
Arrell has suffered several injuries
during the season, but is at last in
excellent, condition. Although not as
formidable an offensive player as
| Captain Mitchell, he fully equals the
j latter on defense. In gaining yards
! the California center will have ;t stal-
I wart difficulty to overcome. Arrell
belongs to the Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity and registers in Economics.
He weighs 170 pounds, is 21 years of
age and 5 ft. IOVa in. tall.
Louis Cass, of Los Angeles, i:-i slated
for the position of right wing three
quarter. Cass was first used at scrum
hali', but was soon shifted to wing,
where he lost no time in making good.
Cass' work is not of the spectacular
sort; his reliability is his strongest
asset. Rut whenever the opportunity
offers, he will be in exactly the right
spot. Cass majors in Economics and
is a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
He is 19 years of age, 5 ft. 10 in.in
hight and weighs 150 pounds.
The left wing three-quarter will be
Eugene Kern. Like Mitchell, Kern has
displayed varsity caliber and as a re
sult was played in the varsity line-up
on several occasions. The dash and
grit of his work always attracts at
tention. He is speedy and invariably
disputes every inch. Kern belongs to
the Beta Theta Pi fraternity and reg
isters from Berkeley in the Economics
department. He weighs 16S, is 20
years of age and 5 ft. 11 Vz in. tall.
As full-back, Sidney Hemenway El
lis, Jr., will be the Cardinal's last de
fence. Although Ellis is excessively
cool and an accurate punter, his sure
tackling is probably his strongest
point. To pass Ellis a California back
will have to be a marvel in a scattered
field. Ellis registers from La Canada
in the Department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of the Zeta Psi
fraternity. He is 19 years of age,
I weighs 168 and is 5 ft. 10 in.in height.
The six substitutes will he Arthur

R. Berryman, Jr., of Los Angeles, Wil

Stanford has ever possessed. Fast and
sure on offence, he is Impassible on
defence. Furthermore, his punting is

The fifth man in the pack will be
Robert Francis Duryea in the middle
row. In weight Duryea is second to
Baumgartner, balancing the beam at
180. He is strong and consistent,'and
bis unusual height, 6 ft. 3 in., renders
him extremely serviceable in the line
out. Duryea is 19 years of age, reg
isters from Palo Alto in Civil Engi
neering and belongs to the Delta Up
silon fraternity.
Perhaps the strongest individual
player in the pack is Lane Burdine
Murlin in the rear rank. Although
far below the average of the scrum in
weight, the ready manner in which
Murlin adapted himself to Rugby and
his inherent football ability make him
a dangerous opponent. He has an
annoying faculty of suddenly appear
ing as an extra man in the midst of
a passing rush. Murlin weighs 152. is
5 ft. lIV 2 in. tall and is 19 years of
age. He is taking the pre-legal
course, hails from Long Beach and
belongs to the Phi Gamma D<Mta fra
ternity.
Linford C. Lull, Jr., another Los
Angelean, is the lock. Lull's build
is admirable for the position, and his
fighting qualities make him a valu
able forward. He has endured keen
competition for the place, but his vic
tory is clearly merited. Lull's height
is an even six feet, his weight 172
and his age 18. He majors in the de
partment of Electrical Engineering
and is a member of the Sigma Nu
fraternity.
The third member of the trio of
rear rankers is Frank Baker Belcher,
of Pomona. Belcher is one of the
few Freshmen who previous to this
fall had had some Rugby experience.
His work is never spectacular, but for
hard, consistent work he has few
peers. Belcher is a member of Theta
Delta Chi and is registered as a pre
legal student. He is 5 ft. 11 in. tall.
18 years old and weighs 118.
Scrum half, George Draper Wors
wick gained his knowledge of Rugby
as a wing three-quarter on the San
Jose High School fifteen. With a few
days of practice he appeared equally
at home at half, and consequently was
retained in that position. Worswick
is fkst and cool and bis passing ac
curate. He finds touch cleverly in
crucial moments. He belongs to the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and
majors in Economics. He is 20 years
of age. weighs 152 and is 5 ft. !> in.
in height.

Harold Thoburn, of Palo Alto, will
lie the first five-eighth. 111 former
seasons, Thoburn played at wing and
early Ibis fall he was tried at full.
He failed to do justice to himself,
however, until given a chance at five,
where be at once proved himself a
consistent and untiring ground-gainer.
Thoburn's reliable receiving and pas
sing enable him to inaugurate many
an effective rush. He is 19 years of
age, 5 ft. 11*4 it), in height and weighs
151. He majors in Psysiology and is
a member of the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity.
The center three-quarter will be
James Lee Arrell, of Moline, Illinois.
Arrell has suffered several injuries
during the season, but is at last in
excellent, condition. Although not as
formidable an offensive player as
| Captain Mitchell, he fully equals the
j latter on defense. In gaining yards
! the California center will have ;t stal-
I wart difficulty to overcome. Arrell
belongs to the Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity and registers in Economics.
He weighs 170 pounds, is 21 years of
age and 5 ft. IOVa in. tall.
Louis Cass, of Los Angeles, i:-i slated
for the position of right wing three
quarter. Cass was first used at scrum
hali', but was soon shifted to wing,
where he lost no time in making good.
Cass' work is not of the spectacular
sort; his reliability is his strongest
asset. Rut whenever the opportunity
offers, he will be in exactly the right
spot. Cass majors in Economics and
is a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
He is 19 years of age, 5 ft. 10 in.in
hight and weighs 150 pounds.
The left wing three-quarter will be
Eugene Kern. Like Mitchell, Kern has
displayed varsity caliber and as a re
sult was played in the varsity line-up
on several occasions. The dash and
grit of his work always attracts at
tention. He is speedy and invariably
disputes every inch. Kern belongs to
the Beta Theta Pi fraternity and reg
isters from Berkeley in the Economics
department. He weighs 16S, is 20
years of age and 5 ft. 11 Vz in. tall.
As full-back, Sidney Hemenway El
lis, Jr., will be the Cardinal's last de
fence. Although Ellis is excessively
cool and an accurate punter, his sure
tackling is probably his strongest
point. To pass Ellis a California back
will have to be a marvel in a scattered
field. Ellis registers from La Canada
in the Department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of the Zeta Psi
fraternity. He is 19 years of age,
I weighs 168 and is 5 ft. 10 in.in height.

The fifteen Freshman Rugby players
who will battle for the Cardinal against
the .Blue and Gold on Saturday, were
announced late this afternoon by
Coach Presley. The six substitutes
who will be on the side-lines ready
for service were also selected. The
team as chosen is wholly as expected,
no changes being made in the line-up
that has been accepted as final dur
ing the last two weeks.
The captain and second five-eights
of the team will be Standish Low Mit
chell, of Los Angeles. Mitchell is be
yond a doubt the most effective Rugby
player on the 1913 squad, and bids
fair to attain varsity honors. At sec
ond five, he has been the mainstay of
the strongest Freshman backlield that
Stanford has ever possessed. Fast and
sure on offence, he is Impassible on
defence. Furthermore, his punting is
at once rangy and precise, while his
goal kicking is accurate. Mitchell
weighs ISO pounds, is 5 ft. lO 1 in.
in height and 21 years of age. He
majors in Economics and is a mem
ber of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
Probably the sturdiest man on the
fifteen is Andrew Douglas Fyfe, who is
at the same time the most diminutive.
Fyfe appears in the front rank. From
start to finish he is on top of the ball
in the loose. He uses his head at all
times and hooks with precision. De
spite the fact that he weighs but 145
and is only 5 ft. SV& in tall, there is
no more valuable player in the pack.
Fyfe is 19 years old, and registers
from Los Angeles in Electrical En
gineering.
In the middle of the front rank
there will be another small lighter,
E. P. Bly, who tips the scales at 150
and is but 5 ft. Gin in height. Illy
is ii strong hooker and fearless in
the ruck. He never stops. In nearly
every preliminary game ho played
himself to a standstill. Bly is 19
years of age, hails from Los Angeles
and majors in Civil Engineering.
The third man in the front rank of
the Stanford scrum will be Alvin H.
Frank, also of Los Angeles. Frank
has been practically assured of his
position from the very outset of the
season. lie won his place through
his never-ending fighting spirit. Frank.
Bly. and Fyfe form a trio that are al
ways battling in the very midst of (ho
game. Frank weights 150, is 19 years
old and 5 ft. 7 in.in height. He ma

jors in I-listory and is a member of
Encina Club.
Edward Charles Baumgartner, the
heaviest man on the team, will be the
second middle ranker. Although
Baumgartner did not appear for
practice until quite late in the sea
son, he immediately made his way to
the first fifteen by reason of his Rugby
experience and bis determined work
in all departments of the forward
game. Baumgartner comes from San
Jose and registers in Electrical En
gineering. He is 20 years of age, is
5 ft. 11% in tall and weighs 192

18 years old and weighs 118.
Scrum half, George Draper Wors
wick gained his knowledge of Rugby
as a wing three-quarter on the San
Jose High School fifteen. With a few
days of practice he appeared equally
at home at half, and consequently was
retained in that position. Worswick
is fkst and cool and bis passing ac
curate. He finds touch cleverly in
crucial moments. He belongs to the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and
majors in Economics. He is 20 years
of age. weighs 152 and is 5 ft. !> in.
in height.

Harold Thoburn, of Palo Alto, will
lie the first five-eighth. 111 former
seasons, Thoburn played at wing and
early Ibis fall he was tried at full.
He failed to do justice to himself,
however, until given a chance at five,
where be at once proved himself a
consistent and untiring ground-gainer.
Thoburn's reliable receiving and pas
sing enable him to inaugurate many
an effective rush. He is 19 years of
age, 5 ft. 11*4 it), in height and weighs
151. He majors in Psysiology and is
a member of the Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity.
The center three-quarter will be
James Lee Arrell, of Moline, Illinois.
Arrell has suffered several injuries
during the season, but is at last in
excellent, condition. Although not as
formidable an offensive player as
| Captain Mitchell, he fully equals the
j latter on defense. In gaining yards
! the California center will have ;t stal-
I wart difficulty to overcome. Arrell
belongs to the Phi Gamma Delta fra
ternity and registers in Economics.
He weighs 170 pounds, is 21 years of
age and 5 ft. IOVa in. tall.
Louis Cass, of Los Angeles, i:-i slated
for the position of right wing three
quarter. Cass was first used at scrum
hali', but was soon shifted to wing,
where he lost no time in making good.
Cass' work is not of the spectacular
sort; his reliability is his strongest
asset. Rut whenever the opportunity
offers, he will be in exactly the right
spot. Cass majors in Economics and
is a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
He is 19 years of age, 5 ft. 10 in.in
hight and weighs 150 pounds.
The left wing three-quarter will be
Eugene Kern. Like Mitchell, Kern has
displayed varsity caliber and as a re
sult was played in the varsity line-up
on several occasions. The dash and
grit of his work always attracts at
tention. He is speedy and invariably
disputes every inch. Kern belongs to
the Beta Theta Pi fraternity and reg
isters from Berkeley in the Economics
department. He weighs 16S, is 20
years of age and 5 ft. 11 Vz in. tall.
As full-back, Sidney Hemenway El
lis, Jr., will be the Cardinal's last de
fence. Although Ellis is excessively
cool and an accurate punter, his sure
tackling is probably his strongest
point. To pass Ellis a California back
will have to be a marvel in a scattered
field. Ellis registers from La Canada
in the Department of Geology and Min
ing and is a member of the Zeta Psi
fraternity. He is 19 years of age,
I weighs 168 and is 5 ft. 10 in.in height.

The fifteen Freshman Rugby players
who will battle for the Cardinal against
the .Blue and Gold on Saturday, were
announced late this afternoon by
Coach Presley. The six substitutes
who will be on the side-lines ready
for service were also selected. The
team as chosen is wholly as expected,
no changes being made in the line-up
that has been accepted as final dur
ing the last two weeks.
The captain and second five-eights
of the team will be Standish Low Mit
chell, of Los Angeles. Mitchell is be
yond a doubt the most effective Rugby
player on the 1913 squad, and bids
fair to attain varsity honors. At sec
ond five, he has been the mainstay of
the strongest Freshman backlield that
Stanford has ever possessed. Fast and
sure on offence, he is Impassible on
defence. Furthermore, his punting is
at once rangy and precise, while his
goal kicking is accurate. Mitchell
weighs ISO pounds, is 5 ft. lO 1 in.
in height and 21 years of age. He
majors in Economics and is a mem
ber of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
Probably the sturdiest man on the
fifteen is Andrew Douglas Fyfe, who is
at the same time the most diminutive.
Fyfe appears in the front rank. From
start to finish he is on top of the ball
in the loose. He uses his head at all
times and hooks with precision. De
spite the fact that he weighs but 145
and is only 5 ft. SV& in tall, there is
no more valuable player in the pack.
Fyfe is 19 years old, and registers
from Los Angeles in Electrical En
gineering.
In the middle of the front rank
there will be another small lighter,
E. P. Bly, who tips the scales at 150
and is but 5 ft. Gin in height. Illy
is ii strong hooker and fearless in
the ruck. He never stops. In nearly
every preliminary game ho played
himself to a standstill. Bly is 19
years of age, hails from Los Angeles
and majors in Civil Engineering.
The third man in the front rank of
the Stanford scrum will be Alvin H.
Frank, also of Los Angeles. Frank
has been practically assured of his
position from the very outset of the
season. lie won his place through
his never-ending fighting spirit. Frank.
Bly. and Fyfe form a trio that are al
ways battling in the very midst of (ho
game. Frank weights 150, is 19 years
old and 5 ft. 7 in.in height. He ma

jors in I-listory and is a member of
Encina Club.
Edward Charles Baumgartner, the
heaviest man on the team, will be the
second middle ranker. Although
Baumgartner did not appear for
practice until quite late in the sea
son, he immediately made his way to
the first fifteen by reason of his Rugby
experience and bis determined work
in all departments of the forward
game. Baumgartner comes from San
Jose and registers in Electrical En
gineering. He is 20 years of age, is
5 ft. 11% in tall and weighs 192
pounds.
The fifth man in the pack will be
Robert Francis Duryea in the middle
row. In weight Duryea is second to
Baumgartner, balancing the beam at
180. He is strong and consistent,'and
bis unusual height, 6 ft. 3 in., renders
him extremely serviceable in the line
out. Duryea is 19 years of age, reg
isters from Palo Alto in Civil Engi
neering and belongs to the Delta Up
silon fraternity.
Perhaps the strongest individual
player in the pack is Lane Burdine
Murlin in the rear rank. Although
far below the average of the scrum in
weight, the ready manner in which
Murlin adapted himself to Rugby and
his inherent football ability make him
a dangerous opponent. He has an
annoying faculty of suddenly appear
ing as an extra man in the midst of
a passing rush. Murlin weighs 152. is
5 ft. lIV 2 in. tall and is 19 years of
age. He is taking the pre-legal
course, hails from Long Beach and
belongs to the Phi Gamma D<Mta fra
ternity.
Linford C. Lull, Jr., another Los
Angelean, is the lock. Lull's build
is admirable for the position, and his
fighting qualities make him a valu
able forward. He has endured keen
competition for the place, but his vic
tory is clearly merited. Lull's height
is an even six feet, his weight 172
and his age 18. He majors in the de
partment of Electrical Engineering
and is a member of the Sigma Nu
fraternity.
The third member of the trio of
rear rankers is Frank Baker Belcher,
of Pomona. Belcher is one of the
few Freshmen who previous to this
fall had had some Rugby experience.
His work is never spectacular, but for
hard, consistent work he has few
peers. Belcher is a member of Theta
Delta Chi and is registered as a pre
legal student. He is 5 ft. 11 in. tall.
18 years old and weighs 118.
