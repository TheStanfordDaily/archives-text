The proceeds of the rugby game
to-morrow will be devoted to the
Stanford Union and will be the first
contribution to this fund by the un
dergraduates. A substantial addi
tion to the money now on hand should
result from this source. The advance
sale of tickets has been well carried
on, but there are still many members
of the Student Body who have not
contributed in this manner. The ob
ject in view and the worth of the con
test itself would appear to justify the
attendance of every undergraduate at
this match.
