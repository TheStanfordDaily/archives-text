The invitation from the Seniors at
California extending the accomoda
tions of Senior Hall to the Stanford
Seniors on Saturday, will be appre
ciated by the men here. This privi
lege will afford the upperclassmen of
the two universities an excellent op
portunity to become better acquainted
and will do much to further a more
harmonious spirit between the un
dergraduates.
