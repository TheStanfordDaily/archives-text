## WILD DEMONSTRATION AT SENDOFF TO FRESHMEN. Packed Hall Noisily Applauds Various Speakers.â€”Tremendous Serpentine at Conclusion. 
### 
The greatest crowd that has ever
gathered in Assembly Hall for a Fresh
man rally last night noisily wished the
1913 fifteen the best of luck and suc
cess in Saturday's intercollegiate
rugby contest. The singing was good,
the cheering hearty and the speeches
excellent. Never has a larger ser
pentine been seen on the inner quad
than that which concluded the rally
yesterday evening.
To i he accompaniment of the stir
ring "Old Colonial" march, snappily
rendered by the University Hand, En
cina Club entered the Hall in a body
about 7:30 o'clock. Soon afterwards
the entrance of the Freshman team,
headed by Coach Presley, brought
forth a wild demonstration lasting
several minutes. The first speaker,
the llev. D. C. Gardner, was then
called to the stage. He was followed
by Professor B. E. Howard, "Dad"
Moulton, and Student Advisor A. E.
Roth, '0!).
