# GREAT RALLY FOR 1913
## WILD DEMONSTRATION AT SENDOFF TO FRESHMEN. Packed Hall Noisily Applauds Various Speakers.—Tremendous Serpentine at Conclusion. 
### 
The greatest crowd that has ever
gathered in Assembly Hall for a Fresh
man rally last night noisily wished the
1913 fifteen the best of luck and suc
cess in Saturday's intercollegiate
rugby contest. The singing was good,
the cheering hearty and the speeches
excellent. Never has a larger ser
pentine been seen on the inner quad
than that which concluded the rally
yesterday evening.
To i he accompaniment of the stir
ring "Old Colonial" march, snappily
rendered by the University Hand, En
cina Club entered the Hall in a body
about 7:30 o'clock. Soon afterwards
the entrance of the Freshman team,
headed by Coach Presley, brought
forth a wild demonstration lasting
several minutes. The first speaker,
the llev. D. C. Gardner, was then
called to the stage. He was followed
by Professor B. E. Howard, "Dad"
Moulton, and Student Advisor A. E.
Roth, '0!).
Dr. Gardner said in part: "Do your
best and you must win. The rule that
all things come to him who waits
is absolutely untrue as regards foot
ball."
Following are a few of the remarks
of Dr. Howard: "It's the man behind
the ball that counts every time. But
remember that there is a tradition
here that Stanford is a synonym for
clean sport. If we can not win
cleanly, we will not win by any other
method. Fight, fight, fight harder
the last minute than you did the first.
You will win, but if you should lose,
we will erect a little tombstone to
you and inscribe upon it the epitaph,
"He done his d d —t, angels could
do no more."
"Dad" Moulton had this to say
about the chances of t lie team:
"This is the best Freshman fifteen we
have ever had at Stanford. A gamer
hunch of men 1 never saw. They are
in tiae condition, it is going to be a
great game, and I really believe they
are positive winners without a doubt."
The last speaker was Roth, who
said: "We have given you, Freshmen,
a lot of things. We have given you
the best coach we could find. We have
given you a trainer who has trained
you in the same way that he has
trained five consecutive winning var
sities. We expect something in re
turn. We expect a Freshman victory
and a decisive one."
