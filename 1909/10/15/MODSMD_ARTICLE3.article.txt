The bleachers of California Field
thronged with gay enthusiastic sup
porters decked in their partisan ar
ray; the Blue and Gold rooters with
the Cardinal hosts opposite, each
seeking to excel the other in noisy
and thunderous demonstration: the
fifteen heros of Stanford and the tit

rushes; Referee Cameron's whistle
sounds a prolonged and ominous note;
a nervous awful stillness on the
bleachers; and the sixteenth annual
intercollegiate football game between
the Freshman teams of the two uni

Then will come the turning of one
more page in the annals of Stanford
history. Will the page record a fifth
successive defeat or the long-awaited
victory at last become a reality?

Such is the merit of "Dad" Moul

Furthermore, a Stanford triumph is
prophesied by pracitcally all the ref
erees and Rugby writers of San Fran
cisco. Such expert officials as Red
ding and Lafferty some weeks ago de
cided unquestionably in favor of the
Cardinal, and with time they have
become firm in their opinion, while
