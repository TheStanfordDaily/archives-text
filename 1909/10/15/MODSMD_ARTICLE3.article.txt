'We always lime light mi'rhtj
hiird to beat Berkeley and thut is what
lite Freshmen will have to di> Sit
urday."—Coach George Presley.
The bleachers of California Field
thronged with gay enthusiastic sup
porters decked in their partisan ar
ray; the Blue and Gold rooters with
the Cardinal hosts opposite, each
seeking to excel the other in noisy
and thunderous demonstration: the
fifteen heros of Stanford and the tit
teen heroes of California sprint rap
idly down the field in practice passing
rushes; Referee Cameron's whistle
sounds a prolonged and ominous note;
a nervous awful stillness on the
bleachers; and the sixteenth annual
intercollegiate football game between
the Freshman teams of the two uni
versities will be a present and deadly
issue. The mighty struggle will be
short. The two halves will seem bul
an instant to the frenzied rooters.
Then will come the turning of one
more page in the annals of Stanford
history. Will the page record a fifth
successive defeat or the long-awaited
victory at last become a reality?

| For the first time in years a predic
i tion of success is not only excused,
but heartily justified. As "Dad"
j Moulton remarked, the 1913 Freshman
I fifteen is the best first -year team
! which Stanford has ever been able to
boast. Back and forward, on offense
and defense, the players who will
! defend the Cardinal to-morrow are
l strong, reliable and heady fighters.
: The 1913 Rugby squad. as an entirety,
| was unusually formidable. Many 'a
'man who will he on the side-lines to
; morrow and some who have not even
j been chosen as substitutes would have
| won for themselves positions on the
| 1911 or 191 li fifteens with relative ease.
Such is the merit of "Dad" Moul
ton's "best Freshman team."
Furthermore, a Stanford triumph is
prophesied by pracitcally all the ref
erees and Rugby writers of San Fran
cisco. Such expert officials as Red
ding and Lafferty some weeks ago de
cided unquestionably in favor of the
Cardinal, and with time they have
become firm in their opinion, while
\V. Unmack who originally declared
for California has now joined the
majority and admits the imminence of
a Stanford victory, although prob
ably a narrow one. Douglas Erskine,
the well-known authority, picks Cap
tain Mitchell's team, and "Bobs," of
tlio Chronicle, is so radical on the
subject that he swears his career us a
Rugby enthusiast is ended, should the
Blue and Gold win.
Save for the games with the Lowell
High School team, the scores of the
preliminary contests give all the ad
vantage to Stanford, and although
comparisons are far from important,
a little weight can nut be denied them.
Following are the complete reseults
of tlie various games played by both
Freshman fifteens during the season:
Stanford scores —Freshmen 13, Low
ell 11; Freshmen 3, Santa Clara 0;
Freshmen 2?., San Jose 0; Freshmen 0,
