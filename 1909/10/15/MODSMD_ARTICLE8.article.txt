Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I note with some regret that it has
been determined to permit hawking
and peddling at the Big Game. The
question of doing this eon of thing
has risen from time to time during the
past fifteen years, hut preceding stu
dent bodies have held that catch
penny devices which might be fitting
lor circuses and professional ball
games were out of place in contests
between universities. A similar view
has been taken by the fnterscholastic
"Hoard of Governors in regard to the
Interscholastic Meet.
Very truly,
Frank Angell.
