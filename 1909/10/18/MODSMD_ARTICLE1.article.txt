At lust Stanford lias won a Fresh
man game. Over on California Field
Saturday afternoon the fifteen Car
dinal players representing the Class
of 191u managed to wrest a scant and
narrow victory from the Blue and
Gold hosts in the sixteenth annual
contest between the first-year teams.
But although scant and narrow, yet
it was a real victory withal, for the
best team won. The score was 5 to 0.
The Stanford Freshmen faced a
task more difficult than the most
pessimistic had ever prognosticated
when they lined up against Califor
nia. 'The men who wore the bfue
jerseys of the state institution put
up as game and desperate a fight as
might have been expected from a vet
eran varsity. They realized full well
their offensive weakness and sought
to concentrate all their mighty ef
forts on an effectual defense. Ilow
near they came to complete success
the score clearly illustrates. Stanford
deserved to win. Her men knew the
most, and played the best, rugby. And
for these reasons all the more tribute
should go to the California men for
their brilliant showing.
The eight pack used by Stanford
had little difficulty in securing pos
session from the seven pack played
by the Blue and Gold. But. on the
other hand, the California breakaways
and wing-forward, made possible by
the two-three-two formation, succeeded
in constantly smothering the Cardinal
half and preventing him from making
any use of the ball, no matter how
often his scrum heeled it out. In this
way California made the contest, more
of a forward game than probably any
rugby match previosuly seen on the
coast. Little or no opportunity for
advances were afforded the Cardinal
backfield upon which so much re
liance had been placed. But two clean
passing rushes were started by Stan
ford during the entire game, and the
first of these resulted in Mitchell
registering tbe only try of the after
noon.
Consequently, the rugby played Sat- I
urday was not of the spectacular j
brand, but ii was rugby, and good j
rugby nevertheless. The California '
fifteen executed wonderfully a care- ;
fully planned scheme of defense. The .
Stanford pack, taken unawares by the
new and clever tactics, and fighting !

against a strange formation, were
suddenly surprised by neing thorn
selves suddenly thrown upon the de
fensive. Under these unexpected con
ditions their stubborn struggle should
receive the more praise.
Between the opposing scrums there
was no appreciable advantage. Both
packs held their own and no more.
In short, Stanford won because her
backfleld was able to turn into a try
the single good opportunity offered
During the first half the oval was
kept for the most part on California's
side of the field, while the greater
portion of the second period found the
ball in Stanford territory. It was
inside their own 25-yard line that the
Cardinal players struggled most vali
antly, the backs' defense being es
pecially strong in the vicinity of then
goal. Several times during the second
half the Stanford supporters had right
eous cause for nervousness, when
rucks drew near the line, for a try
and conversion would have equalled
the Cardinal's five points which were
secured rather early in the first period.
The final call of time came only
after a desperate forward game of
several minutes duration with the ball
in the Cardinal's 2-yard line.
The sole try was tallied by Mitchell
on a passing rush started by Wors
vvick and Thoburn from a line-out
1." yards from the goal. The difficult
kick, which Mitchell had to attempt
went fairly over the bar.

Stanford's best men were Mitchell,
Frank, Fyfe, Baumgartner, Ellis and
Worswick. Captain Mitchell was a
bulwark all the way through. Baum
gartner followed the ball aggressively,
and there was no scrappier pair on
the field than Frank and the midget
Fyfe, who was finally forced to re
tire in favor of Ambrose, the only sub
stitute used by either team. Ellis, at
full, was cool and reliable. Worswick
was severely handicapped in that
Stanford had no wing forward to corn
bar the tireless onslaughts of Peart
and the Blue and Gold breakaways.
Worswick's best work was in finding
touch on defense.
California's stars were Captain
Stroud, Peart, Graff, Lalne and Mini.
The first lour bear the chief respon
sibility for Stanford's inability to in
augurate backfield rushes.
Referee Cameron is not to be criti
cized. He was continually alert and
eminently fair. The California wing
forward may have appeared con
stantly off-side, but the rule of one
i foot behind the ball was his sal
vation in nearly every instance.
The crowd was large, about 7500
| people being present. The Cardinal
| rooters were more numerous than us
| ual at a Freshmen game in Berkeley
land their efforts were correspondingly
j effective.
During the intermission a dlminu
j five "S" appeared by the side of the
I huge "C" 011 the hill. A large num
ber of California Freshmen immedi
| ately started up the ascent in an at
j tempt, to dislodge the intruders and
their work, but shortly before their
arrival the "S" disappeared in smoke
as quickly as it had been originally
displayed.

liance had been placed. But two clean
passing rushes were started by Stan
ford during the entire game, and the
first of these resulted in Mitchell
registering tbe only try of the after
noon.
Consequently, the rugby played Sat- I
urday was not of the spectacular j
brand, but ii was rugby, and good j
rugby nevertheless. The California '
fifteen executed wonderfully a care- ;
fully planned scheme of defense. The .
Stanford pack, taken unawares by the
new and clever tactics, and fighting !

against a strange formation, were
suddenly surprised by neing thorn
selves suddenly thrown upon the de
fensive. Under these unexpected con
ditions their stubborn struggle should
receive the more praise.
Between the opposing scrums there
was no appreciable advantage. Both
packs held their own and no more.
In short, Stanford won because her
backfleld was able to turn into a try
the single good opportunity offered
During the first half the oval was
kept for the most part on California's
side of the field, while the greater
portion of the second period found the
ball in Stanford territory. It was
inside their own 25-yard line that the
Cardinal players struggled most vali
antly, the backs' defense being es
pecially strong in the vicinity of then
goal. Several times during the second
half the Stanford supporters had right
eous cause for nervousness, when
rucks drew near the line, for a try
and conversion would have equalled
the Cardinal's five points which were
secured rather early in the first period.
The final call of time came only
after a desperate forward game of
several minutes duration with the ball
in the Cardinal's 2-yard line.
The sole try was tallied by Mitchell
on a passing rush started by Wors
vvick and Thoburn from a line-out
1." yards from the goal. The difficult
kick, which Mitchell had to attempt
went fairly over the bar.

Stanford's best men were Mitchell,
Frank, Fyfe, Baumgartner, Ellis and
Worswick. Captain Mitchell was a
bulwark all the way through. Baum
gartner followed the ball aggressively,
and there was no scrappier pair on
the field than Frank and the midget
Fyfe, who was finally forced to re
tire in favor of Ambrose, the only sub
stitute used by either team. Ellis, at
full, was cool and reliable. Worswick
was severely handicapped in that
Stanford had no wing forward to corn
bar the tireless onslaughts of Peart
and the Blue and Gold breakaways.
Worswick's best work was in finding
touch on defense.
California's stars were Captain
Stroud, Peart, Graff, Lalne and Mini.
The first lour bear the chief respon
sibility for Stanford's inability to in
augurate backfield rushes.
Referee Cameron is not to be criti
cized. He was continually alert and
eminently fair. The California wing
forward may have appeared con
stantly off-side, but the rule of one
i foot behind the ball was his sal
vation in nearly every instance.

was severely handicapped in that
Stanford had no wing forward to corn
bar the tireless onslaughts of Peart
and the Blue and Gold breakaways.
Worswick's best work was in finding
touch on defense.
California's stars were Captain
Stroud, Peart, Graff, Lalne and Mini.
The first lour bear the chief respon
sibility for Stanford's inability to in
augurate backfield rushes.
Referee Cameron is not to be criti
cized. He was continually alert and
eminently fair. The California wing
forward may have appeared con
stantly off-side, but the rule of one
i foot behind the ball was his sal
vation in nearly every instance.
The crowd was large, about 7500
| people being present. The Cardinal
| rooters were more numerous than us
| ual at a Freshmen game in Berkeley
land their efforts were correspondingly
j effective.
During the intermission a dlminu
j five "S" appeared by the side of the
I huge "C" 011 the hill. A large num
ber of California Freshmen immedi
| ately started up the ascent in an at
j tempt, to dislodge the intruders and
their work, but shortly before their
arrival the "S" disappeared in smoke
as quickly as it had been originally
displayed.
