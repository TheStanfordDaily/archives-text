# Arrange Cotillion Program.
## 
### 
The Sophomore Cotillion Committee
at their meeting lust evening decided
that the program would consist of
twelve regular dances, two extras,
and two favor dances. The committee
wishes to request that the men who
intend going refrain from filling out
their cards until November 1. Tickets
will go in sale at the Bookstore No
vember 19, at the customary price of
$2.50. This is fully two weeks befoiv
the dance which as previously an
nounced will take place in Enciria
Hall the evening of December 3.
The music will be furnished by
Brohaska's orchestra of San Jose, and
will be picked from the latest and
most popular airs.
The decorations will be in the na
ture of something entirely new and
original and will represent a con
siderable outlay of money. It is hoped
to surpass all previous cotillions in
this regard.
The committee will meet again on
Thursday evening, October 21, at the j
Kappa Alpha Theta house at S o'clock. J
