# ATTACKS MODERN TENDENCIES
## Bishop Spaulding of Utah Speaks Ably from Chapel Pulpit to Large Congregation. 
### 
A highly instructive and helpful
sermon was delivered yesterday morn
ing in the University Chapel by Bishop
F. P. Spanieling, of the Episcopal
Church of Utah. Taking for his sub
ject, the Bible text, "The Strength of
Sin Is the Law," the bishop took oc
casion to flay in no uncertain terms
modern tendencies of law-making and
law observance and assented that the
Christian plan of life is not by law,
but by love. He said in part:
"Because we live up to the require
ments of present law, we see our
selves acquitted in all things and do
as we wish within the limits of the
law. We make our little set of stat
utes and obey them, but we do all
this not because we love to do it, but
we are afraid to do otherwise. A life
of self-control is too narrow and irk
some to most of us.
"It is not for us to offer the rewards
of heaven or the tortures of hell, be
cause both heaven and hell begin here.
If men were sent to hell they would
not know it, because they have been
living such a hellish code here, that
when they came to a land where that
law is pre-eminent, they would be sat
isfield.
"We forget the value of character.
We look upon a man for the work he
does, not for what he is. An occupa
tion is popular in so far as it yields
material results at the expense of
personality and self.
