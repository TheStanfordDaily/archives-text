# OBJECT TO CRAWFORD
## U.C. ALLEGES INELIGIBILITY Of CARDINAL FORWARD. California Relies on Four-Year Rule to Crawford from Lineup of Varsity Fifteen. 
### 
The rugby authorities of the Univer
sity of California have signified their
intention to object against allowing
D. P. Crawford, '09, to compete in the
varsity intercollegiate football game
on November IU. California bases
her objection on the "four-year rule"
of the athletic agreement between the
two institutions, which states that a
man will be permitted to participate
in intercollegiate events for four col
lege years only.
Although Crawford entered Stan
ford in the fall of 1905 with the class
of 1909, he has been registered but
eight semesters. In his freshman year
he competed against California on the
varsity eleven, but in the spring and
fall of 1906 he took part in no inter
collegiate event, either football or
track. 11' these two consecutive se
mesters, beginning and ending at
Christmas, constitute a college year,
Crawford is now eligible, for then this
would be only his fourth college year
as a varsity man.
Several seasons ago a similar ques
tion was presented for decision when
O. Overall, the former Blue and Gold
athlete and present National League
pitcher, was in his fifth year at Cali
fornia. At that time, much to Over
all's benefit, the phrase "college year"
was defined as two consecutive se
mesters. The same ruling was made
for Stanford in the case of "Savage"
Dole. It is probable that this meaning
would attach now.
The determination of the point is
practically in the hands of Dr. F.
Angel 1, the chairman of the committee,
for once that chairman passes favor
ably upon the eligibility of any player,
that player may be protested by the
other institution solely on the grounds
of professionalism. It is Dr. Angell's
impression thut. any two consecutive
semesters will make a college year,
and he takes this position in the
statement made to-day.
