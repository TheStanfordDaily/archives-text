the very able minister who filled the
Chapel pulpit Sunday. He is a force
ful, direct speaker who holds the close
attention of his audience throughout
his entire discourse. e√üing an Epis
copalean divine and a radical Social

interest.

pal Church to report on the subject,
"Christianity and Socialism." The lec
ture will begin at 7:30.
