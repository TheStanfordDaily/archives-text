Editor Daily Palo Alto:
1 am a Stanford man antl have have
seen every Freshman game for tlx:
last live years, i have never heard
it :-aid before that Berkeley surpassed
Stanford in extending all due court
esy to a rival team. This is exactly
what they did to-day on the Califor
nia field. When we were through
serpentining and had gathered to sing
"Hail, Stanford Hail," the California
yell-leaders maintained strict silence
among their rooters, who also re
moved their hats. V-hen we had fin
ished with our song and were dis
persing, the Berkeley bleachers arose
and commenced their hymn.
The least the Stanford men could
have done, after the consideration
just shown them, would have been to
have maintained silence. Instead of
this, indiscriminate cat-calls and hoots
were given, while not a Stanford hat
was removed. We have been good
losers. Can we afford to be poor
winners?
The idea of the Stanford spirit, it
seems to me, has never been to rub
it into the other fellow when we have
him down. More attention should be
paid to the feelings of the other fellow,
when it comes to singing his college
hymn, a thing that stands for a great
deal to any loyal collegian.
A Stanford Man.
