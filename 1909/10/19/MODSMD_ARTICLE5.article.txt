# PRACTICE GAMES EACH WEEK.
## Baseball Men Have Line-ups on Wednesdays.â€”Work Will Continue into November. 
### 
The baseball men the past week
have been given practice in games
with the faculty nine. Wednesdays are
usually devoted to these matches, and
one is seheduled for to-morrow at
4:30 on the Faculty diamond. Only
a small percentage of the squad take
part in the line-up, the other men con
tinuing the routine work on the var
sity diamond. It. is probable that the
fall practice will extend well into
November, and that, the sixty-two men
who are at present on the squad will
be kept on the lists until the end. No
particular department of the game is
being emphasized, though batting is
receiving its usual careful attention.
Fall practice at the University of
California includes a full schedule of
games with outside teams, for strictly
practice purposes. The work there
will probably continue until Christmas.
