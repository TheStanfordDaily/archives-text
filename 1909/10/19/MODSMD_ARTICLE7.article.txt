# TO USE LOCAL BARGE
## CHEW SELECTS STANFORD BOAT FOR PORTOLA RACE. Decide to Row in Accustomed Craft After Tryout of Proffered Racing Barge. 
### 
The Portola Committee which has
charge of the regatta to be held on
the bay next Saturday, wrote some
days ago to Captain Huston, '10, of
fering to supply a barge for the use
of the Stanford crew. This would save
the expense and inconvenience of
shipping one of the local barges to the
city and having it returned. Hut after
a subsequent investigation the men de
cided to row in one of the heavier
local boats.
The chief objection to the use of
the boat offered by the San Francisco
Committee is that the Stanford oars
men accustomed to rowing in the local
barge would be compelled to change
their entire form of rowing in order
to adapt themselves to the San Fran
cisco barge.
Last Saturday morning, however,
the members of the crew went to San
Francisco to make a thorough tryout
of the proffered boats. A row of a few
miles convinced them that they would
be seriously handicapped if they were
to enter next Saturday's contest in a
boat constructed so differently from
the accustomed craft, and it, was de
cided to use the Stanford boat in the
race.
The boats used by the clubs on the
bay are much wider than the men
are accustomed to here. Each man
instead of sitting in the middle of the
boat sits on the opposite side of the
boat from that which he rows on. The
oars are also of a different pattern,
the oars of the stroke and the bowman
being much shorter than the oars of
the other two men. Another striking
difference between the barges is the
fact that the lighter barge of the type
which the South End Rowing Club and
other rowing clubs around the bay use,
skim over the water instead of plow
ing through it as does the heavier
Stanford craft.
Followers of boating, including ex-
Coach Garnett, of the University of
California, say that the Stanford crew
would have unusually good chances of
carrying off the honors next Saturday
if we had had the opportunity to train
in a racing barge. In the short time
remaining before the race nothing
could be done towards changing boats
as it would take at least a week of
practice before our men could ac
custom themselves to the wider craft.
The men are now training regularly
on the water at Redwood and on the
machines in the Gymnasium, in addi
tion to road work.
