That famous old opera, "The Chimes

| direction of \V. B. Bartlett, of Oakland.
[Around the bay Bartlett has as en
viable a reputation as a director of
| musical shows us has F. L. Mathieu
in straight dramatic performances.
| He devotes by far the greater portion
i of his time to the staging of standard
j comic operas. He has supervised more
j than a dozen amateur productions of
"The Chimes of Normandy," and now
knows perfectly every measure and
line. Several years ago, Bartlett
j staged "Patience" and"The Princess
Oenone" in Assembly Hall with the
greatest success.
Long ago when the celebrated "Bos
j tonians" were in their prime, Bart-
I lett. played leading roles with them
J for many seasons.
On the night of the performance the
j coach will direct the University Or
chestra, which has been steadily prac
ticing the great number of musical
| numbers included in"The Chimes."
Rehearsals of both principals and
chorus are being held daily, and every
thing will be in complete readiness
by October 29.
