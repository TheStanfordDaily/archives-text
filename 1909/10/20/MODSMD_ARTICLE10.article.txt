Under the joint auspices of the Nes
toria and Euphronia' debating socie
ties, Hiram \V. Johnson, the eloquent
San Francisco attorney and champion
of civic righteousness, will speak in
Assembly Hail next Tuesday evening.
His subject will deal with special ref
erence to existing conditions in San
I Francisco. Detailed arrangements for
| the meeting are now being made by
| representatives of Hie two literary or-
I sanitations.
The invitation to address ilit: local
public was extend; <1 to Johnson be
cause of his intimati association with
ihe small group oi reformers who have
battled incessantly for the political re
generation oi San Francisco. There
is, perhaps, 110 one better qualified to
give an accurate account of the count
less evils that threatened San Fran
cisco's municipal government than
Hiram Johnson. As lawyer and as cit
izen he has at all times lent his sup
port to the cause of governmental re
form in the effort to perpetuate Amer
ican institutions, free from the influ
ences of corruption. Second only to
Francis J. Heney has been his ac
tive participation in the prosecution
of the graft cases in San Francisco
during the past few years. Jn the face
of powerful opposition, Johnson has
frequently travelled into the cities
tributary to San Francisco as the de
fender of the past and present policy
of the "prosecution" and in doing so
has maintained public confidence in
the ultimate triumph of civic decency,
of students at the University of Cali
of student at the University of Cali
fornia, an institution in which he
matriculated with the Class of '88.
Johnson's address will be of un
usual interest at this time in view of
the approaching election in San Fran
cisco. In the campaign he has aligned
himself 011 the side of Heney and other
candidates in opposition to the nomi
nees of his own political party. In
his local address, Johnson will prob
ably indicate the nature of the policy
to be followed by the "prosecution"
in the event of a successful termina
tion of the campaign.
In procurring the services of John
son as the principal speaker next
Tuesday evening, the literary societies
are continuing a policy inaugurated
several weeks ago. At that time un
equivocal resolutions in support of the
graft "prosecution" were adopted.
Johnson's talk will explain the con
ditions that led to this affirmative at
titude towards the approaching elec
tion.
The meeting will be open to the
university public as well as to the citi
zens of Palo Alto, in addition to
Johnson's address, it is possible that
some San Franciscan, representing the
party opposing Heney will set forth
his views. An invitation to speak on
this occasion has been extended to a
prominent San Francisco attorney,
who is opposed to the "prosecution"
forces but as yet he has not accepted.

Johnson's talk will explain the con
ditions that led to this affirmative at
titude towards the approaching elec
tion.
The meeting will be open to the
university public as well as to the citi
zens of Palo Alto, in addition to
Johnson's address, it is possible that
some San Franciscan, representing the
party opposing Heney will set forth
his views. An invitation to speak on
this occasion has been extended to a
prominent San Francisco attorney,
who is opposed to the "prosecution"
forces but as yet he has not accepted.
