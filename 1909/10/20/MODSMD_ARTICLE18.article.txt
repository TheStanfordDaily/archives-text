Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I am sorry to have appeared so un
compromising as my statement pub
lished in last night's "Daily Palo Alto"
would seem to imply. While tl\e In
tercollegiate Agreement provides that
no formal protest against a player's
eligibility may be made, except in
questions of amateur standing, it goes
â– without saying, that any objections
whatever raised under the Agreement
by either university receive the same
consideration, whether formal protests
or not. Very truly,
F. Angell.
