# Campaign Speeches Before Nestoria.
## 
### 
Nestoria Literary Society enjoyed a
brief respite from the regular run of
debating programs yesterday evening,
when it resolved itself into a political
meeting and listened to campaign
speeches favoring the various candi
dates now running for municipal of
fices of San Francisco. All the candi
dates from the Republican to the So
cialist nominees found champions, and
ureat. enthusiasm was aroused over the
political issues involved.
