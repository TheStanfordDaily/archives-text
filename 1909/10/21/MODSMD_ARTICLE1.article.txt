# FAST CREW TO RACE
## STANFORD FOUR WILL COMPETE WITH CRACK OARSMEN. Race Will Occur In China Basin at One O'clock, Saturday.â€”One Mile and a Half Course. 
### 
Next Saturday the last crew that
will row under the name ol' Stanford,
under the present ruling of the Execu
tive Committee, will compete with the
crack crews of three private boating
clubs, over a mile and half course on
San Francisco Bay. The four men that
will compose the crew representing
Stanford are men who are in every
way qualified to represent the Car
dinal, as they have all rowed on
either winning varsity or freshmen
crews against the Blue and Gold.
Three of i lie members of the Four
rowed on the crew that went north
last spring and defeated for the first
time the crew of the University of
Washington. The oarsmen have been
training for the past month for the
event and are all in good condition.
Captain J. C. Huston, '10, who will
row number three needs no introduc
tion, as he has long been connected
with rowing at Stanford, having rowed
on two intercollegiate varsity races
and captained the victorious crew that
took the laurels in the Stanford-Wash
ington regatta at Seattle. C. L.
Schaupp, '12, who will stroke the four,
was captain of last year's winning
freshman crew. R. R. Gilmore, '12,
and R. H. Seward, '12, who will row
number two and bow respectively both
rowed on their freshman crew and
were members of the crew that won
from Washington. F. L. Guerena, '11,
will be coxswain.
The race will be rowed in Chiiu
Basin which is but a short walk from
the Third and Townsend Street depot
of the Southern Pacific. The time
which is announced for the start by
the Portola Committee for the first
race, the one in which Stanford's four
will be one of the starters, is sched
uled for one o'clock.
The race has been so arranged that
both the start and finish can be seen
with ease from any of the many van
tage places along the shores of China
Basin as the start and finish will tie
at. the same place.
When the Stanford Four was en
tered, it was understood that the
course was to be a straightaway and
it was on this condition that our crew
was entered. The committee saw lit
to change the course as has been
stated and this has been a contested
point between Captain Huston and
Chairman Hammersmith. The reason
why our crew was so decidedly in
favor of a coruse without a turn is
that the boats that will be used by
the other crews can be turned about
much more easily than our heavier
barge.
The course which has been chosen
for the race is a mile and a half long.
Three-quarters of a mile to a turn
ing post and return to the start. The
length of the course is what our men
hope to win on as they expect, to out
last. their opponents and make tip the
distance they will loose at the turn
by their longer and more scientific
rowing strokes.
The other entries for the race are
the crews of the Alameda Boat Club,
the Dolphin Rowing Club and the
South End Boat Club. These clubs i

have rowed together for sometime
and will set a fast, pace for the winner.
